I take a step forward and place my hand on the cold stone. Mary’s always going to be a big part of my life, but in the last two years I found myself thinking about and missing her less and less. As cruel as it sounds, time really does heal every wound. And it’s not like we were the perfect couple when she died. I step back and leave the graveyard without looking behind.
“Fine. That’s… good,” Sherlock replies. He smiles at me but somehow seems sad while saying so. Christ, he’s definitely still upset because of Irene. I should probably say something, as his friend.
John slowly turns the key in the front door, his hand trembling the way Sherlock’s did only three days ago. It seems like an eternity has passed since then. He inhales another deep breath and enters his house. The hallway is quiet at first, but he knows Mary’s at home. He already texted her from the train saying that he’ll be back soon and that they’d need to talk. John places his luggage next to his shoes before taking off his coat. He finally hears someone rummaging around in the kitchen, so he fights the impulse to turn around and run away from the ruins of his marriage, and steps into the sitting area, instead.
But just because Sherlock knows that they cannot be together, doesn’t mean he can choose not to love John.
“No,” Sherlock replies quickly. He walks back into the living room and takes a seat in his chair, then points the violin bow to the empty chair opposite of him.
My words seem to convince her, as she looks over her shoulder before nodding. She follows us into the cab and back to Mr. Simon’s flat. Her husband’s face goes white once he sees her, but as he tries to hug his wife she takes a step back.
I can’t possibly wait any longer, so I lean forward and kiss him. How much time did we lose because of our insecurities? In the end, it really doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we finally figured it out. But there’s one more thing…
I wake up from a weird dream that I forget immediately. I sit up in bed and automatically look over at Rosie’s crib. She seems to still be asleep. I lay back down and stare at the ceiling of 221B. It felt natural to move back in after everything that happened with Sherlock’s sister. I spent most of my time at Baker Street, anyway, and kept going back and forth between my flat, the clinic and this flat. Rosie babbles in her sleep and I notice it with a heavy heart. She’s going to be two years old in May, which is still a semi-appropriate age for a parent and a child to share a room. At the age of four and five and thirteen, however, it’s not going to be. I keep wondering what I’m going to do about it. Maybe I can sleep on the couch, at first, and when Rosie’s old enough she can move to 221C. I can already feel the back pain thinking about sleeping on the couch for the next 16 years. It’s not really an option.
“Yes. I had already made a vow before once and had called it my first and last one, but it turned out that I was wrong, which I never am – ”
going to die and that John just told him that he loves him six times and that everything Sherlock ever wanted is right in front of him.
On the sixth day, they had managed to go through with their arrangement without any major incidents. Sherlock had told Mrs. Hudson on Sunday when he had gone down for tea and John had texted most of the people he thought would notice and question them in Rosie’s presence. Rosie had been as happy as ever and Sherlock and John had been fine. Apart from a couple of stares from some Mums at kindergarten, nothing had actually changed.
“Yeah, I figured after I threw out the last one because of the hole right in the middle, it’d be nice to have a new board on hand if we ever feel like playing again.”
“I’m going to head back for a kip while Sherlock’s in there,” John told Melissa, who looked a bit guilty, “in case he’s looking for me after.”
John shook his head and rolled his eyes.  “Damn you,” he said affectionately to Sherlock.  “Next time, let me help you.  Now, let’s see about that cheek.”
Sometime around 2am, Mycroft arrived by helicopter, and the violin ceased.  Unable to keep his eyes open any longer, John finally fell asleep in the armchair.  He dreamed of secrets and ladders, plums and roses, locked gardens and happy endings.
knowing that John would see them.  His phone would be with his clothes - the only way John could communicate with him would be to go and find him - likely Sherlock’s intention.  Well, Sherlock had said he liked to swim.
Sherlock’s carefully schooled features twisted, nostrils flaring.  He looked positively furious, twin spots of colour blossoming on his cheeks. He swallowed, once, twice, his mouth working.  “How
She really was, thought John.  He hadn’t been the best of brothers in the past decade, however, either.  He could declare a temporary truce.
“You’re an evil person,” said John, who, once again, was on the way to sporting a hard on.  God, how he loved this man.
What he wanted to say was something along the lines of, “Christ almighty, I am not actually seeing this” or “What in God’s name are you doing?” or “That’s
He actually did use the toilet and thought about sending off a text to Sherlock while the tap was running.  He didn’t dare, however, in case Sherlock was still in the house and his text alert gave him away.
“She’s driven, certainly.  And very clever.  She has impeccable taste and I wouldn’t be surprised if she were well-versed in feng shui.  She knows what will make her clients feel at ease and how to cater to the wealthy.”
She smiled apologetically.  “I supposed I’m not.  That’s why I’m here, of course.”  John gave her a questioning look.  “For the ‘Fountain of Youth.’  Silly name, I know.  But it’s the only thing that seems to make me relax.  I’ve been so incredibly stressed out and Lillian is so good.  I must look a mess.”
They stared at each other for a long moment.  Sherlock looked impeccable, as if he’d dressed for the occasion, in black trousers and a crisp, dove-grey shirt.  John’s heart beat faster at the very sight of him.  How on earth was he ever going to platonically share a flat with the man?  Good God, he was gorgeous.
The men tucked into their breakfasts as Mrs. Hudson regaled her employer with the latest local gossip.
“Connected,” corrected John, lifting up his head to kiss Sherlock’s perfect mouth some more, running his tongue over that impossible cupid’s bow.  How did a man even
“It’s not like you’re predictable.  How am I to know what’s going on up there?  You probably have a whole wing devoted to sex acts in that brilliant mind palace of yours.”
He gave Sherlock’s nipple one final tease before sliding his hand down, tracing his ribs, and stopping at his trousers.  Sherlock’s breathing quickened.
He liked the simple act of sex, but always found it more intense when augmented by emotional attachment.  One of the reasons he simply wasn’t satisfied with keeping their relationship platonic was because he wanted Sherlock to feel how much he meant to him, wanted him to know all of the things he could not say but could convey through his hands, lips, and body.  He wanted Sherlock to know he was loved, and loved well.  He wanted to hold him, clasp him tight, stake his claim, render him pliant, drive him wild.  And if penetration was what drove Sherlock wild, John aimed to drive him right round the bend.
My orgasm rips through me.  I am in two places: here, in the shower, my toes digging into the tiny mosaic tiles of the floor as my body arcs with the power of it.  I push my cock into my stomach with the flat of my palm as I come, and it feels like it does in my mind, against John’s back as he shouts obscenities that echo off the walls and into the dark, shadowed corners of the pool area.  As I attempt to catch my breath, penis still twitching and groin tight, I realise the noise might have been me, and I might have some explaining to do when I finish.
Then, still in his coat, he crossed the room and sat on the coffee table, folded his hands under his chin, and looked somberly at his lover (who at least had the decency to look embarrassed beneath his fading arousal).
Again, infinite thanks to BettySwallocks.  She's spent more time helping me on this than she probably should.
Sherlock shifts away from the window and assumes a more neutral posture.  “I wouldn’t have thought that would embarrass you,” he says.
“Why is it so important?” He didn’t look away from the microscope, which was lighting up his eyes (pale, prone to early cataracts, John thought, inability to make eye contact, emotional discomfort).  “Sex.  Nudity.  Bodies touching.”  He paused.  “You’re the doctor.  Biology?”
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.  If John didn’t take that moment, that beautiful moment where Sherlock had bared his skin and his soul, he knew he was never going to get another one.  His heart in his throat, John took Sherlock’s head in his wet hands, pulled him close, and kissed him.
“Oh,” she said, smiling.  “You know what he did?  His PGCE. He’s a primary school teacher in Cardiff.”
“Don’t know.  I’m not an archeologist, and the church that housed all of the records burned down in 1748.  It’s been empty for a very, very long time.  Come on.”  Sherlock elegantly skipped from one stone to the other, making his way over to one of the towers.  John could see a spiral stone staircase within.
His throat is dry and his heart races.  He rubs his brow.  Sherlock had given him the disc she’d left for him, and John had taken both of them and never watched them again.  He’d tried binning them once, but found he couldn’t.  “How?” he manages.  They haven’t used a DVD player in fifteen years.
Apparently not, for Sherlock pulled away and took off his coat.  “I’m going to have a bath,” he said, rubbing his prickly chin.  “I’m dying for a shave.”
John ducked through once what was a portcullis, its iron gate long gone, and into the structure’s interior. The inner courtyard looked like some exotic movie set, all green, creeping ivy, ancient stone, and sunlight beaming overhead.  He cautiously moved over slippery stones, avoiding stagnant, shallow pools of water, to Sherlock’s side.
Towelling off, I wonder what the rest of this weekend will bring.  Sex is a distinct possibility.  I shave, fix my hair, put on deodorant, try to negotiate my body’s desires (no, Sherlock, so much more than your body, you fool).  Even know, my mind is racing in directions I’ve never allowed it: John and physical intimacy.  What will he enjoy?  Even allow?  Can I touch him?  Anywhere?  What would he think if I fell to my knees in front of him, desperate to taste him, to take him in my mouth and suck him hard?  There are so many things I want to do, so many experiences I want with him.  Then it hits me - this goes both ways.  How will he touch me?  How will I react to his lips, his fingers, the feel of his skin pressed against mine?  Will he want to perform fellatio?  Should I ejaculate in his mouth, or is that off-limits?  What about penetrative sex?  Will he be slow and thorough or quick and dirty?  I want to know his body (all of it, every inch, and then some more).  Will he want to know mine?  I’m not a complete novice, but this emotion is completely unprecedented and John has been someone’s lover before, knows the intimate and mysterious dance of bodies and hearts.
“Any friend of yours is a friend of mine,” Mike said amiably.  “I’ll check out his blog.  Would you like to see the trauma centre?”
a nice room.  Very welcoming and warm.  So unlike his room at Headley Court, sterile and cold and so very...beige.
John stares at the tiles, the pattern of water droplets from where his hand swiped still visible.  The water is getting in his eyes so he closes them and as he does so he realises that his penis, so disinterested a moment ago, is well on its way to becoming spectacularly hard.
John approached carefully, unsure of how Sherlock would react.  It was bound to be an emotional experience, whether the man wanted to admit it or not.  “Um, did I do it wrong?  I pruned them, and fertilized them in early April.  They had aphids, so Molly brought ladybirds and we used a special soap.  Nasty thorns on these...did you engineer those, too?”
“Morning,” he mumbles.  He pushes me out of the way just enough to yawn and stretch with his arms above his head.  His mouth works in a funny little circle (rabbit chewing) before he lowers an arm to rub at his face before gathering me close to him.  I throw a leg over his body and continue my slow rutting.
If Sherlock was impressed by their surroundings, he didn’t let on.  John, however, was appropriately astounded.  The spa itself was an elegant building at the back of the original hall, connected to the mansion by a garden in which water cascaded from one stone pool to another.  In quiet corners, water lilies bloomed and the golden bodies of ancient koi carp swam slowly between their stalks.  The climbing roses covering the trellis that acted as a natural roof were just beginning to bloom; one or two more days of sun and the place would be a riot of colour and scent.  John was so entranced by the garden he nearly let Sherlock be the one to enter the spa first - and that was just not going to do.
Sherlock looks at the large mouthpiece (a Miraphone TU39: Very Deep, 1.803" Cup Depth, 0.339" Bore, 1.260" Cup Diameter, Gold Finish) in John’s small, capable hand before taking it.  Their fingers brush.  He wraps his own large palm around the mouthpiece, testing the weight, feeling how it was warmed by John’s body.
“Dr. Watson?  You’re home in the UK. I’m Dr Janice Fellows, one of the trauma doctors at QEH.  May I call you John?”
By the time they’d finished, it had gone 4 o’clock.  John, having had one of his best days in ages, found himself not ready to go back to Holmes Hall.  “While we’re here, is there anywhere else you’d like to go?”  He hoped he didn’t sound too eager.
Sherlock loved him, but he’d decided when Sherlock had initially asked about John’s feelings back at Willow Cross that it would be fine if Sherlock never wanted to express it aloud.  He figured that if he did choose to, it would be followed by words of caution:
“Tell me if it’s too much,” John said, leaning down to press a kiss between the blades of Sherlock’s shoulders, inadvertently brushing his genitals over the swell of Sherlock’s buttocks as he did so.  Very nice.
John figured he wasn’t doing much good sitting around waiting for Sherlock to come to an epiphany, so he took the list and cycled into town to have tea with Mr. Chapman.
He plugged his laptop in to charge and turned off the bedside lamp.  Sherlock was still sitting by the fire, illuminated by the glow of the computer screen and the soft flicker of the flames.  John climbed into that glorious bed, burrowing himself down under layers of satiny-smooth sheets and soft duvets.  He’d likely kick them all off later, but for now, it was perfect.  He rubbed his bare feet together, noticing how soft they felt.  He felt full and warm and exhausted.  Yawning, John said goodnight to Sherlock and to one of the most bizarre days he’d had in a very, very long time.
“So pointless,” he was saying.  “And ugly.  These are not going back on this bed.  Neither is this,” he said, tugging at the enormous damask duvet.  Too hot.  Too bloody...fluffy.  But these sheets” - he ran his hands over them after wresting the giant duvet to the ground - “these sheets will do quite nicely.  For tonight, at least.”
Sighing, John returned to the brochure.  Too much longer and he was going to text Sherlock and go find some dinner.  He was trying to make sense of “vajazzling” when something that sounded like an angry flock of seagulls erupted from somewhere behind the velvet curtain and a rather befuddled-looking Sherlock came stumbling out, sporting the distinct redness of face that comes after being backhanded.
John couldn’t think of anything coherent to say to that, so he simply said “Thank you,” and tried very hard not to break down.
“I’ll never solve this case if I cannot think, and I cannot think because of you.  You’re driving me mad.”
John tried; he couldn’t without completely submerging his head.  He frowned, then began his splash attack with renewed vigour.
Years later, when they would look back at this particular event as one of their...more interesting...sexual experiences, John would maintain that he really didn’t plan for a particular object to see a bit of Holmes-Watson shenanigans.  He certainly didn’t
Mycroft Holmes looked vaguely impressed, closed the dossier, and sipped at his own tea before he spoke again.
“I know.  Saw them when I was last here, so I brought these.”  She reached into her bag and brought out a small, clear plastic bin.  “Two-spot ladybirds.   You can buy them on the internet.”
Sherlock used the opportunity to recapture the handwarmer.  “Don’t worry,” he said after John eyed the thing dubiously, “I’ll be gentle.”
Sherlock looked momentarily uncomfortable.  “Nothing important.  I was simply disagreeing.  The author suggests...  Here, see for yourself.”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirked.  “Perish the thought, John.  As far as a proper lab is concerned, I’d really just like a decent place to do a decent PCR and access to a centrifuge and incubator.”
If he were proportionate, which, if John’s experience in the medical field was any indicator, he would be; Sherlock’s penis was simply bound to be bigger than John’s.  What if Sherlock were
John dared to look, then, and saw Sherlock, cheeks pink from the warm summer day, his eyes full of trepidation...and affection.  Sherlock held what was left of a daisy, turning it this way and that before bringing up his other hand to pull off one of the remaining petals.
“I’m sure you were,” John said darkly.   His hand clenched around the vial in his pocket before pulling it out and holding it between his thumb and forefinger.  “So,” he continued, “whose idea was it to tip the needles?  Robert’s?  Or yours?”
John took a deep breath through his nose and let it out through his mouth.  His lover was nothing if unpredictable, and John loved that about him, but if Sherlock was going to lose interest in the current proceedings and take a shining to studying scrotums of all types for the next week - well, that simply wouldn’t do.  Not after all that talk about vanilla and the fellatio and the thing with the fingernails…
Molly blushed and fiddled with her empty bottle.  “You know,” she said, almost embarrassed.  “Sherlock.”
“Burns?  Petree?”  He kept asking, the names flowing from his parched tongue although he already knew the answer.
On 3 February Harry turned up.  “Congratulations, Johnny,” she said as she came in and looked around, her eyebrows drawn together and mouth pulled into a frown.  “You’ve officially managed to scare the shit out of me.  Pack your things. You’re coming home with me.”
Sherlock’s presence there, feel his eyes on his face, his feet, roving over his body, could practically
No, love is not a pathogen, but, as John has given me reason to believe, a gift; not a parasite but a symbiont, here, somewhere in my groin, my kidneys, my heart, my head.  I feel rather alive at the moment.  Overwhelmingly in love.  And horribly, horribly distracted.
“Go ahead,” said Lestrade, attacking a particularly recalcitrant mass of tangled, dead foliage.  “Just don’t pull anything green without checking with me first, OK?  Bloody stuff’s as stubborn as the ex,” he muttered.  “You ever been married?”
“Your phone.  You’re a soldier recently invalided home.  This model of this particular phone is a year old now.  It’s been used without a protective cover...see these scratches?  You haven’t had it long enough to put them there.  So it’s been kept in a handbag with keys and coins.  That, and the general lack of care the device has had indicate that whoever purchased it didn’t find the device as sentimental as it was supposed to have been, as it was obviously a gift. The engraving on the back,
“I was sorting out the linen cupboard and found the old DVD player and a load of movies on the top shelf.  I was bored, Dad.  You two were off...doing
“Yes.”  Sherlock looked at the ladder and climbed up to the second to the top rung, then outstretched his arms as if he were pruning an invisible tree.  “Shake it,” he said over his shoulder.
“You do realise that any of those things you were taking kill brain cells, right? Bit counterintuitive.”
In addition, he’d been particularly brilliant in front of Lestrade and his team, and John had said “fantastic!” not once but twice.  John had been acting strangely all day, in fact.  Staring, more than usual that was, at Sherlock’s mouth.
They end up eating at a tiny, quirky Korean restaurant somewhere near Kingston.  Sherlock steals most of John’s Be Bin Bap and they fall into their regular easy camaraderie.  It’s fun: John appreciates the company.
Exhausted, John let his head fall back against the chair.  “Jesus,” he said.  “Sherlock, that was...that was...Jesus.”
As I replay our midnight tryst in my mind, all rational thought goes offline.  I find myself with my back up against the side wall of the shower, tiles now warm against my shoulders, spreading my legs and fucking my fist with one hand and playing with my balls with the other.  It’s not slippery enough, and my few endeavors of masturbating with soap have been less than pleasant.  It burns.  So I stop long enough to look around - conditioner will do the trick - before resuming.  It’s not going to take long.
Sherlock looks around as if the room wasn’t a disaster, then brings the instrument back to his lips to play the last portion of the piece as quickly as he can.  He looks daggers at Mycroft all the while.
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest and surveyed his childhood room.  “Bit of a mess,” he admitted.  He wove his way through the boxes and disappeared from view; John followed round to find Sherlock pushing the heavy, brocade curtains away from the tall windows.  He unlatched one and opened it, leaned on the casement, and took a deep breath of cool night air.  John shivered and sidled up next to him.
“It will take you that long to solve it?” John asked with a smile as he crammed the last of the scone into his mouth.
Sherlock is lying flat on his back, one arm tucked under his head, the other around John, who is snuggled into his side, tracing patterns on Sherlock’s chest with his left hand.  His fingers eventually wander up toward Sherlock’s lips, where they trace the curves and dips.
“Synthetic fur. I hate it.”  He pursed his lips in disgust and frowned, then shuddered, a full-body affair.  “Ugh.  Vile texture.  Do
Though, when John thought about it, he’d probably chase right after him...and enjoy whatever mischief they got up to.
And maybe, if he’d admit it to himself, the garden was analogous to himself, to all that he had blocked off and tucked away, walled up over the years.  Like his heart, after Mary.  Mary, who had been unable to wait, who had found someone so quickly after John began his first tour of duty.  He’d been cast aside for someone ‘safe’, who wasn’t going to galavant all over the world (no, just Afghanistan) in some deluded attempt at patriotism.  It had been so hard to leave her, too.  Mary, with her bright blue eyes, infectious laugh, and clever mind.  Who loved pub night and crap telly and sex.  They’d talked about children, once.  John shook his head.  Children.  With Mary.  The woman whom he’d loved so dearly.  Jesus.  It was for the better, he supposed.  If he were being honest with himself, he knew that living with a wife and two kids in the suburbs, living a mundane and routine life, would have left him bored and yearning for something more.
Eventually the subtle aftershocks of his orgasm began to fade.  Oddly enough, the weird feeling on his chest wasn’t waning, and neither was a strange sensation on his cock.  Intense orgasm, indeed.
And when he was confused, angry, or otherwise emotional, John did what he usually did: he went for a walk.
Sherlock came up behind John and wrapped his arms around him.  “Let the dead stay with the dead, John,” he said softly.  “I prefer to be alive.”
Sherlock considered it, drawing his feet up under him.  “Fine,” he said, then turned his attention to the fire.
John opened his mouth and then closed it again.  “It’s not generally polite to insult one’s friends,” he settled on.
I have to think about this, remember my brother lording over the dessert table and my success at eating the slimy thing.  I would have preferred the chocolate, enjoyed it melting on my tongue, the balance between the bitterness of the cocoa and richness of the butter.  The sensuality of it.  But the oyster was sensual in its own way; it was then an intellectual triumph, my mind’s mastery of the transport.
John heard Sherlock swallow.  “That,” he said softly.  “What this must be.  I’m not…”  He swallowed again, pushing down emotion.  “I don’t know…”
John had always appreciated the line of a strong back; Sherlock’s was longer and stronger than any woman’s.  And he’d always appreciated the curvature of the gluteus maximus; Sherlock’s arse was beautifully made.  But what lay between those rounded cheeks...Good God.  Sherlock
Waging a war with oneself is an interesting exercise.  I have conquered more tenacious beasts than love.  If I must continue with metaphors, then I am willingly surrendering to this.  John has invaded Afghanistan and a territory far more secluded and dangerous: my heart.
me.  Let Mycroft scoff at that.  He is alone by choice, and I am no longer willing to live as he does.  He has not loved and lost, as both John and I have.  He does not know the strong bonds of friendship, of affection, outside of the ‘duty’ he feels toward me.  And if he does, or has, he has not shared that information with me.  I pity him, sometimes.  Insufferable wanker he may be, but he is still my brother and, I suppose, he deserves someone interesting to render him a bit more human.  No one looks at him the way John looks at me.  No one snores against cab windows when he returns home.
John smiled to himself.  He imagined himself in Sherlock’s room, in his bed, Sherlock between his legs.  “I’d love to suck you,” said Fantasy Sherlock.  “May I?”  John sighed and adjusted his grip on his cock, his left hand twisting around the head of his prick.  “Lovely,” said Fantasy Sherlock.  “And now, let me lick your hole.  Yes, that’s it.  Relax.  Hmmm.”
“Then why hide it?  That’s a great skill to have - it should have been on her CV.  Leybourne said nothing about it.”
John laughed out loud, nervously, and rolled over.  Actually, the thought of someone rubbing their face on him seemed rather erotic.  He imagined a scenario: something dirty and unsafe.  A club, then.  Toilet stall.  Back against the cold metal.  Someone kneeling.  Not sucking, not yet, but rubbing his cock all over their face, mouthing it, breathing on it, kissing his groin, leaving traces of fairy-dust on the soft, smooth skin above his pubic hair while a rhythmic bass line thumped through the wall.
“It’s okay,” says John, voice quiet, calming.  “Stress hormone release.  You’re exhausted.  It’s all right.”
Something in the tone made him turn around to see Sherlock sitting on the bed, looking a right mess.  Any resolve John had managed to muster quickly dissolved.
“Aren’t you going to ask me to come with you?” asked Sherlock as John shrugged into his coat and found his gloves.  It was bloody cold out there.
It’s nearly midnight by the time they reach the cottage.  The darkness has a different quality in the country, a velvety softness that John likes.  They have to use a torch to fit the key in the lock.
It takes a couple of attempts -- John drawing a breath and giggling instead -- before he manages.  Babies have done better.  Sherlock sighs.  “Try again.  No, stick them out a bit more.  More.  Now, blow.  Vibrate them.”
“Hmm, go on...” I murmur against his skin as I bend down to get closer to him, maybe mouth at his testicles a bit; they’re drawing up, so tight and full, his legs are beginning to shake.
John took pity on him and climbed back into bed.  He had five minutes to spare.  Something was clearly eating at Sherlock.  “Are you trying to tell me sex isn’t so mundane after all?”
John placed the plate on what was now the only clear surface of the room -- the bedside table.  “Was this your childhood room?” he asked, rolling up his shirtsleeves.  It didn’t look as if it had been redecorated.  The room lacked the formality of the others he’d seen.  No sleek paintings hung from the walls, and the furniture was plain and functional, from the desk to the chairs.  The bedframe was ornately carved but made up with a plain grey duvet.  He tried to imagine the space as a child’s room, complete with plastic trucks, cars, Lego, model dinosaurs and board games.  What kind of toys would Sherlock have played with?  Or did he favour the outdoors as a child?  Did he play sports or hide-and-seek in the garden?  John doubted it.
John didn’t know what to say, so he said nothing.  He watched some nonsense in which washed up celebrities attempted to eat caterpillars  and forced himself to eat the microwave popcorn she’d made.  Harry brought him a blanket and pillow and then sat on the sofa next him and cried.  “I’m sorry,” she said.  “I’m so sorry.  I’m a lousy sister.”
“This is not how this works, Sherlock.” John says, reminding Sherlock of the very beginning of their journey towards dominance and submission. “When I punish you in this way, it's for your pleasure as well as mine. It's not... it's not a real penalty. I don't believe in beating people because they did something I perceive as wrong, you know.”
Sherlock swallows, relaxes. Mycroft's touch is soothing, it anchors him, brings him back from the edge. He takes a deep breath and nods. His face must look a right mess, covered in half dried come and spit, with a tube up his nose. Sherlock understands why they want to cover it up.
Mycroft rakes his right hand down again and gropes Sherlock's groin. “Oh, you horny slut. You just can't get enough, can you? Last night, we were gracious enough to let you climax, but don't get used to that. I'm not sure it will be a habit we'll let take hold.” Sherlock can hear the cruel smile in Mycroft's tone.
“God, that bitch truly loves its come.” Ginger laughs appreciatively, and warmth spreads through Sherlock's body as he can see John's proud expression. He revels in the men's attention, trying hard to be a good obedient slut - for John. He'll do anything for John.
Now it dawns on him. The room is full of sweaty, red-faced men. Inebriated men. Aroused men. They stare at him as if they want to rip him apart and eat him alive. Quite possibly, they will.
At least Sherlock is allowed to use a cloth to wipe the floor. Only when the oak parquet is gleaming does Mycroft send him into the bathroom, wrinkling his nose in disgust. Sherlock washes himself quick yet efficiently.
Sherlock had been swirling around the bedroom, manically gesturing while rapidly firing off his deduction. His cheeks are now flushed an even deeper crimson, and while Dimmock might attribute this to the rather embarrassing circumstances that poor sod on the bed kicked it while felating a rubber dildo, John knows that Sherlock's rosy complexion has to do with another toy altogether.
“So, she wasn't raped. That's at least something.” He tells Sherlock, trying to cheer him up a bit, while the detective is brooding gloomily over yet another crime scene report.
“Hmm, that's very... considerate of you.” John chuckles. Sherlock's hips starts to buck as he fucks himself on John's fingers.
Sherlock isn't even screaming anymore, just panting and snivelling. His eyes are closed as tears run down his face, almost as red as his backside.
“Look.” Lestrade says to John, handing him a paper cup of what passes off for coffee at NSY. With his other hand, the DI points at the computer screen, showing somewhat distorted black and white footage of the corner of Irene's street. John watches a car turn, then stop. Three people get out, two tall, one significantly smaller. The timestamp shows 20:08.
John's large cock blocks his windpipe. The lack of air makes Sherlock dizzy, especially as John stays deep inside him for long moments, cutting off his air supply. In addition, Sherlock starts drooling copiously because he can't swallow. His spit drips onto his chest, reminding him of the weights still attached to his nipples.
It is too hot to be outside. Despite, Sherlock's worn out. After their night in the Giardino, John had made him come numerous times over the past two days, keeping him literally chained to the bed with handcuffs, naked.
As if to emphasize this point, John grabs Kate's hips more firmly. She gives a crude moan as John plunges deep into her and throws her head back, eyes closed, mouth open. Her long red hair cascades enticingly down her back.
John laughs. “Your brain didn't complain when you sucked my cock all morning. And I'm not sure I like your idea of... diversion.”
John lifts his chin and forces Sherlock to look up at him. “That's right. You just drowned a whole pint of your own piss. Did you like that?”
Sherlock stares at the piece of metal in John's hand. He remembers the first time they did this, back in London. It had been good, but this device looks like a medieval torture instrument.
“I'd really love to piss on you again, Sherlock, but I doubt that's advisable regarding the sensitive state of your body?” Mycroft looks over to John.
John is equally fascinated, entranced. He touches his index finger to Sherlock's ring of muscle and encircles the fluttering rim tenderly.
Then he walks over to the chest of drawers and opens it. “I watched you, Mr Sacker. Despite the alluring display of sexual deviances out there, you didn't seem to find what you were looking for. Not even the spanking did it for you, though he, “Acri indicates for Sherlock, “seemed pretty turned on by the hot wax game. Therefore, I conclude that you are into the more intense kind of play.”
“God, you still don't have enough, do you?” Mycroft murmurs, pinching Sherlock's purpling, bloodied cheek before ripping the plug out in one swift move. Sherlock yells at the top of his lungs like a wounded animal.
“Not so fast.” It's John who's grabbing him by the hair. “I can see that you made her open and wet for me. Now it's your turn to watch.”
They step behind the black velvet curtain, separating the busy shop from a more private area. A dimly lit corridor leads to the back of the building, into a small room that looks more like a lab or a surgery than something Sherlock would have expected at a somewhat seedy tattoo parlour in SoHo. Everything looks neat and very clean. There's a stretcher covered in plastic foil, as is the equipment. Sherlock can't identify most of the instruments but is sure that they are needed to inject ink beneath the epidermis.
Sherlock is so hard it looks outright painful, his purplish cock poking upwards from his concave abdomen, blotchy with arousal. His pubic hair is growing back, and the base of his cock is surrounded by a halo of short black fur, a nice contrast to the blond hair on his head. His foreskin is fully retracted, allowing the precome to drip freely down his shaft.
Sherlock sucks in his breath at the first sensation of the touch and almost loses his balance. The rope doesn't tear forcefully at his piercings, but still his nipples are nicely stimulated. Sherlock moans softly at the back of his throat as he steadies himself.
Come is dripping from Sherlock's mouth by now. He feels full but can't get enough. Each condom tastes different. The spoon adds a special note of lewdness to it, like he's having an exceptionally sordid dessert in a posh restaurant.
“Lick.” He orders, and Sherlock's tongue darts out and dips right in. He circles John's hole a few times, tasting him, before swiping his wet tongue greedily through John's crack from just behind his balls up to his tailbone. As John's musky taste fills his mouth and he hums in appreciation.
“Molly!” John sighs. “They are all over poor Molly. As if it hadn't been bad enough for her alre...”
John reaches out and tenderly touches his thumb to Sherlock's lower lip, stroking it, spreading the sticky, wet remnants. Sherlock bucks his hips and arches his spine and sound and plug move inside him in unison, setting his whole body alight with arousal. His pierced nipples peak, the rings gleaming in the candle light.
Sherlock is breathing hard, and it is humiliating, but oh god, at the same time, it feels so good to let go. Warm wetness fills the bag.
But Acri had just given a little nod, his eyes dark and hard, and the newcomer had shuffled behind the blonde and pushed in alongside the other two much paler arms.
The angel is awkward as Sherlock is lying on his belly but he manages to put his index finger inside him up to the second knuckle. He plays with his hole, rotating his finger, and can feel John's come inside himself. He hears John behind him, taking another swig of beer and removing the gloves before he starts fisting his cock hard and fast.
Afterwards, John takes Sherlock to the bathroom, washes him carefully with lukewarm water, paying especially tender attention to his groin and arse to remove all the residue of the tiger balm before patching his wounds up again.
His leaking cock twitches in response. He needs to be tied up, otherwise he won’t be able to withstand the impulse to wank himself into oblivion. Thank god that John is taking care of him, or he would rut himself raw against the carpet like a bitch in heat.
“I found this hoe in the shed and thought I use it to built my own fucking machine.” John says, his voice low and sultry. He's standing between Sherlock's spread legs and the tree trunk. As he pulls Sherlock's suspended body back, the rounded wooden handle of the hoe slides deep inside Sherlock's hole, brushing over his prostate. He moans despite the pain from the thorny branches wound around his legs and head constricting with the movement. The stones attached to his nipples and balls start swinging, and Sherlock's whole body lights up in pain, a white hot bolt shooting through his abused limbs.
Sherlock can sense both men standing close behind him, feeling their body heat, listening to the whisper of their clothes. He feels exposed, vulnerable, being totally naked in their presence, and the thought makes his swollen cock jerk between his legs as a thick bead of precome wells up from the slit. The heavy chain pulls at his nipples, the pain sweet and agonising, toned down to a throbbing numbness, only now and then interrupted by a sharp spark that goes straight to Sherlock's groin.
The temperature in the room falls several degrees as the smile is instantly wiped from Mycroft's face.
John just grins when he sees the utter confusion on Sherlock's face. “I'll explain it later. Just for now, we struck a deal, your brother and I, when he first abducted me. He didn't really offer me money, it was something much more intimate. Because, like you, he doesn't consult amateurs.”
John starts to fuck him slow and deep while the bag around Sherlock's head starts to fill with carbon dioxide. He's almost pulled up into John's lap as John rotates his hips, brushing his prostate. It feels glorious, especially as Sherlock's body starts to go limp due to the spreading hypoxia. His chest is still heaving as almost all his other muscles weaken, the fight for air becoming the sole purpose, the centre of his attention. The plastic sticks to his face, and only the nasogastric tube prevents it from completely blocking his airways. As his head starts to loll, John presses the gun harder against the side of his face, starting to caress Sherlock with the cold steel. He rubs it over Sherlock's plastic covered cheeks and mouth, down his neck, until he rests the nozzle just below Sherlock's chin.
Finally, when Sherlock's whole back is smarting from the thorough thrashing he's received and his screams have died down to low whimpers, John puts the tawse down.
John mostly does it in the evenings, wearing a cock ring that prevents him from coming, so he can keep going for hours. After he's been fucked deep and long, John likes to indulge in another of his favourite activities: fisting. Sherlock has to kneel in front of the couch, head on the floor, arse in the air, while John pushes his hand inside him up to his elbow. Lube and come are dripping out of Sherlock as John feels and moves inside him, stroking his warm walls. He can do that for an eternity.
He's kneeling on their kitchen floor, tugging at his cock while his own urine seeps through his trouser legs, all the while looking up at John with wide eyes, unblinking. John would normally be sure that Sherlock is storing all this away in his mind palace for future reference, only, he seems almost gone, reduced to basic human needs, like any other man wanking. The realisation that Sherlock is just like him in this moment, desperately chasing his orgasm while his higher brain functions are shut off, giving way and releasing blood to perform much more carnal acts, makes John brave and bold. He has to watch Sherlock come apart.
After a few minutes, John stuffs a towel into Sherlock's mouth to silence his wailing. His rim is bright red by now; his body strains and contorts in pain. The cleaner inside Sherlock’s rectum has started to lather and is spilling out of him, its sharp acerbic smell mixed with the copper scent of blood filling the small bathroom.
Sherlock has to keep the soiled shirt on as John makes him collect the take-away from downstairs as the delivery man rings. His face is burning with shame while his erection is tenting his trousers – and John simply loves it.
He kneels instead down next to Sherlock, taking off his jacket to wrap it scantily around bony shoulders, gathering the obviously perturbed man up into his arms.
He's not tied up, he could have ended his ordeal any time. He's here voluntarily. Knowing that makes John's cock again strain against his denim confines. He's doing this to Sherlock Holmes, who's by now not only willing but rather eager to submit to him, reduced to a panting cock slut. His panting cock slut.
“Oh, John, don't be so dull and decent. It really doesn't suit you.” Sherlock saunters past him into the bathroom. “I'm in desperate need of a shower.”
“Take a deep breath, Sherlock.” He commands, and Sherlock obeys, afraid he might not be able to get enough air later. It's a disgusting feeling as the hose slides down his throat, pushed into his oesophagus. Sherlock gags as it passes his tonsils and Mycroft has to steady his head again, holding it in a death grip to prevent Sherlock from shifting and thereby impeding the procedure.
“Sherlock...?” But there's a knock on the door, and then the guard puts his head inside the room and signals with a stern look that John's time is up.
With a curd nod John goes back over to where Sherlock is still waiting for him. A pair who'd been making out on a nearby chaise-lounge has noticed him and is eyeing him predatorily while shoving their tongues deep inside each other's mouth. They are not fully naked but quickly getting there while trying to attract Sherlock's attention.
First, Sherlock's feet are put into some kind of sewed-in foot bag at the bottom of the sack, securing them.
By now, Sherlock is drooling heavily, unable to stop it, just the way John likes it. His face will soon be glistening with spit. Sherlock renders control to John, who wonders how far they are both prepared to go.
Sherlock closes his eyes and leans slightly forward, gripping John's shoulders as he feels a nudge at his rim. But it's definitely too small to be Mycroft’s cock. Ah, another finger first, to test the waters, so to speak. Sherlock appreciates the consideration.
Reality intrudes far too quickly. They are woken next morning by a call from Mycroft, announcing his arrival for the same evening. Promising a surprise.
Sherlock almost screams when John finally pushes in. His own cock is still almost entirely trapped inside those tight panties, neglected, yet hard and leaking. John even stuffs his glans back inside the knickers before grabbing Sherlock's hips again to brutally fuck him.
John had only met Sherlock’s parents once. They'd been in town to see a musical and had visited 221b before. They had struck John as surprisingly ordinary. Nice, a bit boring, just typical English pensioners. How they could have produced children like Sherlock and Mycroft is totally beyond John.
“You think you've earned that? After what you did?” John's voice is firm. Sherlock visibly shudders.
First of all, he has to serve another man. His tongue fucking and the other boy's cock sucking finally push the German over the edge. He comes down the Asian's throat with a deep sigh, holding his face in place while Sherlock can feel his hole flutter against his lips.
Despite still being a little shaky from his orgasm, John takes his phone out with trembling fingers and snaps one last picture of Sherlock, dishevelled, covered in come, slightly off kilter, his hair a mess, his eyes red, still a visible mark on his throat where John had tightened his belt.
Kate hurries to obey, exposing her shaven cunt. Her vulva is glistening pink. Sherlock remembers licking her and shivers. John senses his unease and leans over. “No, look at her, Sherlock.” He murmurs in Sherlock's ear.
“I told you I had a surprise for you, remember? It's in your bedroom. Dress up in the garments on your bed. I'll be with you in fifteen minutes.”
Sherlock nods. John's hands reach around his upper arms and squeeze his biceps. Sherlock has to bite down on his lower lip until he can taste blood, his scream dying in his throat. He rocks slightly back and forth, his body squirming in agony until John starts to suck on his right earlobe. Despite the pain Sherlock can feel himself getting hard again. He calms down a fraction, enjoying the rare tenderness.
He's still bruised from last night's activities. And John is big. Sherlock's face contorts in discomfort, but he doesn't stop, forcing himself down, engulfing John’s erection. When John is fully seated, Sherlock takes a moment to catch his breath and adjust.
“He's been with me the longest, you know. I got him eight years back when he was just fifteen. Used him hard and well. Now, as you can see, he's a little tattered and worn. His bowels fall out easily. That's what comes with being able to fit anything up your arse. Anything. Isn't that so, pig?”
Sherlock starts to loose time, mercifully sinking more and more frequently into numb darkness. He’s only pulled back to the surface when sharp pain shoots through his body as a result of a truly vicious attack. The burns, for example, are hard to ignore. He is told to spread his legs, lying on his back, allowing for the glowing cigar ends to be pressed against his most delicate skin. They ask him if he likes it, if he wants more, and he nods, spreading his legs wider.
It takes some time until Mycroft in satisfied with the fit. Eventually, Sherlock's body has been transformed into an hourglass figure, his bruised plump bottom protruding lushly from beneath the shiny rubber, stiff with metal boning. The corset ends beneath his nipples, and the lacing is so tight that it almost seems as if Sherlock, despite being thin as a willow, has tiny breasts swelling over the rubber rim.
“It was a bit better this afternoon. But you kept nagging me about wanting to come. Again, this is not about you, Sherlock. You have to understand that. You have to truly embrace the idea that you are just for me to use. You are in no position to demand anything.”
“Hands behind your head.” John orders quietly, and Sherlock raises his arms and folds his hands at his nape. The clothes pins John has put on the soft skin of his upper and lower arms rattle with the movement. As the skin beneath them tightens, Sherlock groans in delicious anguish. John's finger flick the pins playfully, and Sherlock's breath catches as he moans in response.
“Get the fuck on with it!” Moriarty suddenly yells. “I'll count to three, and if you are not licking at his tonsils when I'm finished, little Kitty will have a field day. Three – two – one... ok, Sherlock, you asked for it.”
“What on earth...” John begins, getting up and raking his hands through his hair. Sherlock quietens him with a cough and a minute shake of his head. There are surely cameras and microphones in the interview room, recording their reactions. John sits back down again. They both wait in silence.
“Sorry, excuse us.” John mumbles as he gently steers Sherlock back into his room. Sherlock's father somewhat gapes at them, but doesn't say a word as he slowly enters the bathroom and closes the door behind himself.
If Sherlock had thought that the insertion of the hose had been painful and humiliating, the actual feeding process is even more horrible. John's been mixing a thick mush from powder and water from the tab in the corner. It's in a transparent beaker, so Sherlock can see that it contains around 35 fl oz.
After another ten minutes of unbelievable suffering, the pressure on his stomach slowly starts to dissipate. Digestion is setting in. Some of the mush is leaving his stomach to flow down into his Duodenum, Jejunum and Ileum before entering his colon. His breathing starts to calm as the most acute pain slowly abides. What bliss!
John glances over at Sherlock, who's slumped into his seat, only half-conscious, his head lolling from left to right. Dried blood obscures his features as he curls up on himself, pulling his knees up to his chest, wincing. Fuck the seat belt, John thinks, as he rips away the tape covering Sherlock's mouth before stepping onto the accelerator.
Leaving the whipping room behind, they enter what seems to be the last chamber. It's slightly larger than the others, with some kind of podium at its far side, on which is set a huge four poster bed like on a stage. As they get closer, Sherlock sees a very handsome middle-aged man lounge on it – fit, short brown hair, wearing a purple silk dressing gown (Sherlock longingly remembers his own he'd had to leave back in London...). He's surrounded by four absolutely stunning boys – they can't be older than twenty – stroking his skin, kissing him in turns or sucking at his nipples through the cool thin fabric covering his body.
Sherlock longs to wrap his lips around Johns cock head, to taste and suck him, but John seems to have other plans. He turns away from Sherlock and puts one foot onto the seat of the chair. Holding his cock in his left hand, he grabs the backrest with the right, looking back over his shoulder. With a tilt of his head, John beckons Sherlock's over, and Sherlock shuffles forward on his knees as far as the leash allows, until his face is mere inches away from John's arse, the cheeks spread because of his pulled up leg. Sherlock can see the fair dusting of golden hair down John's cleft, leading towards his furled, dark pink entrance. John leans forward, bracing himself on the backrest, exposing himself further by pushing his bottom right in Sherlock's face.
“Maybe Irene told him? They are old acquaintances. He also knew that John had an interest in the place.”
John feels like someone has landed a punch to his gut. It's a physical pain, spreading from his abdomen into his chest cavity, making him feel icy cold all over.
“Can you lie down on your side for me?” John asks after a few minutes, during which he's been palming himself almost absent-mindedly through his jeans. Sherlock gives a slow nod. But John has to help him crouch down into a foetal position. The spikes sink into his skin all over his left side, from his shoulder down to his calves. He trembles and shrieks. John strokes his hair to calm him and prevent further damage from erratic shaking. Eventually, the shudders subside. Sherlock can feel blood pool beneath him. Thank god that he's become so lithe and thin.
To heighten the sensation, John walks over into the sitting room and takes Sherlock's 'Wiley's Encyclopaedia of Forensic Science' from the shelves. The five volumes weigh around eleven pounds. John slowly places one book after the other in Sherlock's lap, steadily increasing the pressure on his sore arse and stiff cock. As Sherlock's body is weighed down, the pain spikes up, sharp and searing. He groans.
“So, what do you have so far?” It's Anderson asking, leaning against the mantelpiece, glass of Whisky in hand. Sherlock completely ignores him and directly addresses Irene.
The cellar is nothing like Irene's basement dungeon. Instead, the roughly plastered walls are painted a blazing white, though the ceiling is low and Sherlock almost knocks his head against the stone because he's even taller now in his plateau shoes than usual.
He sincerely hopes he'll not be subjected to the feeding hose again! The thought alone makes him recoil.
“Sherlock, stop that!” He shrieks, swatting Sherlock's long fingers away. “How do you feel?” He asks, turning serious.
If you are interested in sounding, do your research. Only use clean, properly disinfected sounding rods, otherwise you risk infection. And don't use glycerin based lube. The sugar in it can be a breeding ground for germs, leading to infections.
When John's gaze reaches her face, it's just in time to catch her remove her sunglasses. As their eyes meet, John gasps, because he's sure he'd recognise those eyes anywhere: pale silver-blue with a splash of green, large, expressive, slightly almond-shaped. Only, the last time he looked into them, they'd been lifelessly staring back at him from a head fractured by a bullet.
Thanks to the drug and alcohol soaring through his bloodstream, Sherlock is only partly aware of the things done to him at this stage. The blank spaces in his mind grow as his awareness becomes more and more patchy. As if through thick fog, he can hear himself making distressed, helpless sounds; is that him, sobbing? It doesn't feel like him, this boneless, naked, bleeding pile of abused flesh folded over the coffee table.
Having arrived at this conclusion, their eyes had locked over their drinks. John's hadn't wavered, even as Sherlock had felt the uncharacteristic need to reassure himself. John suddenly felt quite sure that he could drown into those pale silver eyes if he'd not be careful.
After a moment, it's John who breaks the silence. “Well, I think we should talk to Kate again. What do you reckon, Sherlock?”
Mycroft gives him a look. “Well, I'll tell you anyway. Apparently, he'd been kind of disowned by his organisation, after risking some of their biggest operations just to get to you. Especially the loss of the Vermeer wasn't met with approval.”
When the stream runs dry eventually, he continues to lick and lap until the DS  is clean, suckling at her labia, even nestling his nose and cheeks into her black curls to be marked with her scent.
The next moment, a calloused hand starts to kneed his buttocks, pulling them apart, exposing his rosy pucker.
Sherlock seems frozen, paralysed. He stares at his brother for a long moment before very deliberately taking a step back and sitting down into one of the flowery armchairs, crossing his legs primly. John can't suppress a smug smirk as he lowers himself onto the armrest.
The skin on Sherlock’s knees and shins has started to peel off by now, the price for sitting in Hydrochloride Acid. He’s so exhausted that he fears to pass out. The cramps are getting worse by the minute as his stomach gurgles loudly. Eventually, he starts throwing up. It’s just water and bile but the effort it takes to bring it up enhances the pressure on his bowels, sharply heightening the ache with every wave of nausea. Sherlock tries to keep it down, pressing a trembling hand to his mouth, until the watery phlegm forcefully erupts out of him, seeping between his fingers, dripping down into the slurry he's forced to kneel in. He coughs and splutters, mortified by his failing body.
Willow Cross was Britain's premier hotel and spa resort, winning awards left and right for accommodation and spa services.  The hotel itself was a nineteenth-century mansion and a Grade II listed building set on a sprawling 30-acre wooded estate.  Their prices were staggering.  Even if relaxing spa weekends were John’s thing - which they weren’t - he would have never been able to afford it.
And yes, I went there.  I'm so sorry.  With all the stuff going down in our world today, maybe it's good just to take a step back and laugh at our own humanity in the face of how barbaric we humans can be.
John looks at the ground; he’s emotional.  They’re both out of practice; the familiar easiness they once had seems just out of reach.  It’s worth striving for.
John’s not sure if he believes it, but he supposes it doesn’t matter, anyway.  “She’s old enough to stay alone.”
Swearing, John reached down and tenderly probed the offended area: moments before the attempted insertion, his anus had been soft and ready; now it was sore and puffy and Jesus fuck, was he bleeding?  Fucking hell.  He gingerly climbed out of bed, retrieved the dildo, shoved it back in the shoebox (he’d clean it later when he stopped hating it), and pulled on a pair of loose sweatpants.  He needed a hot bath.  And then maybe an ice pack.  And a drink.
Sherlock reached for John’s hand, pulled him closer.  “That was the first time we’d done that,” he said.  “Came together.”
It really shouldn’t have been arousing, but in the time they’d been together, John found that Sherlock could do something as human as sneeze and somehow his body would find it sexy as hell.  He wondered if the novelty of their relationship as lovers would ever wear off.
“Thanks.  Do you really manage all of this on your own?  I mean, Jesus.  What a job!  This place is massive.”
His cries went unheeded, however; they were taking heavy fire from enemy 50-calibre rounds.  Dust and plaster rained down on him from above.  Not too far away, the sound of something exploding.   And then, the pain.  Jesus, the pain.
Mycroft ignored the comment and continued.  “Our mother refused to listen to Sherlock then.  She was mad with grief and frustrated at Sherlock’s apparent lack of it.  She never said so, but of course she blamed him for what happened.  I did too, for a time.  Altruism isn’t one of Sherlock’s more salient personality traits.  It wouldn’t have taken much for him to pull himself away for half an hour to hold a ladder.”
“I don’t.  We’re eating  together, John.  I have no intentions of propositioning you, if you’re concerned about it.”
Sherlock stared at the book, eyebrows drawn together, before crossing to John and taking it in his big hands.
John giggled.  Ridiculous.  This whole thing was just ridiculous.  Sherlock chuckled along side him and nuzzled at his neck.  “God.  I just - you’re mad.  Sherlock Holmes: reluctant masturbator and owner of sex toys.  You’re a study of contradictions.”
Sherlock opened the windows to let in the night breeze, and they climbed back into Sherlock’s big bed.  Sherlock rolled to his side and drew John’s arms around him.
It was an intense orgasm to say the least.  Maybe it was the novel position, maybe Sherlock was hitting something inside him that had never been hit before, but John felt like even his very
, Archibald Holmes’ beloved plum tree, the one Sherlock should have helped prune and that Mycroft hacked down in a fit of grief and rage.
Sherlock continued.  “You left behind your boots, but you also took something with you.  Something sentimental, something to remember him by.  After all, you did love him.”
“Miles Donovan does not use social media,” Sherlock said, getting under the covers. “I doubt he’s in Leeds.  There’s a Miles Donovan in Camber Sands and another in Accrington.  I called Mycroft.  He can have one of his minions run a DBS check on him so we can see his criminal history.”
I like John’s armpits.  I like the golden hair there, how fine it is.  Like a tiny tuft of lion’s mane, not a grey hair whatsoever.  The skin under his arms is delicate and soft.  John finds my fascination amusing.  He always affectionately tells me I’m mad and then lets me nuzzle in, even when he hasn’t recently showered.
Sherlock stared at the fire, thinking, before setting his glass down, too.  He stood, deliberately, and then dropped his robe to the ground.  John swallowed, watching the firelight play off the angles of his body.  He looked like a damn statue.  Sherlock knelt then, before him, almost supplicant.  “Intensely,” he said without wavering, those strange and beautiful eyes locked on John’s own, before laying his head in John’s lap.  John’s hands came up of their own accord, fingers smoothing through dark curls.
“Look.  We’ll get dressed and go back to the suite.  I’ve got something to show you from Lillian’s room, anyhow.  She’s made a fucking
“I would hope my reputation as a detective precedes that of my musical talent,” Sherlock says.  He schools his features.  As intriguing as Moriarty is, Sherlock understands that he is incredibly dangerous.  And right now he’s touching something Sherlock considers an extension of himself; it’s too personal and his skin crawls.
He twists himself away from John to face the window of the cab so he can run his tongue over his teeth without scrutiny.  Yes, there, he can feel it.  His tongue isn’t enough, and he’s well above picking at his teeth in the back of a cab, so he will have to sit, defeated, for ten more minutes, stupid, stupid, thinking that John wanted to kiss him, wanted to put his mouth so close to one that was harboring the most hateful, offensive, tiny black microscopicly kidney-bean shaped seed known to man…
Refusing to feel sorry for himself any longer, John lifted his bag onto the bed and unzipped it.  He piled his three pairs of trousers (jeans, green cotton, and brown corduroy), four shirts (two tartan, a long-sleeve striped lightweight jumper, and a grey cardigan), five pairs of underpants (standard white briefs), five pairs of socks (a selection from the Marks and Spencer sale), and five vests.  He also had two mystery novels, a shaving kit, the loathsome rubber resistance band, a pair of pyjama bottoms, and some trainers.  That was it.  John Watson in a bag.
Sherlock’s narrative, peppered with unnecessary facts and figures, explained how he had to go ‘undercover’ and post a few videos of his own, along with learning some rudimentary hacking techniques, to figure out who had started a massive online attack against a university student and keen rugby player who posted a video on his Twitter in which he repeatedly slammed a fluffy grey cat against a wall.  The vigilante sent the video to every major animal rights activist group he or she could find, and the student was bombarded with hate mail and even had the door to his flat smeared with cat excrement.  None of that troubled Sherlock in the least.  What finally piqued his interest was that the rugby lad eventually landed himself in the hospital with a mysterious illness after the vigilante posted a tweet that read, “Brandon will finally respect pussy.”
“I’ve worn this ring for seventeen years,” he says to the fire before setting his glass down on the side table.  He twists the bit of metal with his right hand.  “I don’t think it would even come off now.”
“No!  Just...don’t.  That would be...” John trailed off, surprised at his own reaction.  “All wrong,” he settled for at last.  “It would make you less recognisable, though.”
Canolacrush did a smash-up beta job, and Bettyswallocks, as usual, is my go-to girl for everything British.
to be intrigued, but you’d never guess.  John risks a glance to find his friend emptying the spit valve all over their rug (John grimaces, but Mycroft nearly gags).
“I want to check his criminal record before we go looking for him.  Let’s eat here and then head home.”
He was reaching into his pack for morphine and an epipen when he noticed Murray, across the narrow street, take a hit in the arm.
“That’s the thing,” said John as they walked down the hallway.  “It’s not a trick.  It’s…”  He couldn’t think of the words.  “It’s just Sherlock,” he settled on.  “Thanks for letting him in.  I don’t suppose it will be a regular thing.  He’s not got the best people skills, I’ll warn you.”
“This is the main pool, kept at 28 degrees for comfort but not too warm for swimming.  It took nearly a year to lay the tiles,” she added, indicating the millions of tiny turquoise glass squares.  “The lions” - lion heads were carved into the pillars and water spouted from their mouths - “are in homage to Harold Leybourne’s, the founder of the estate, coat-of-arms.  His great-grandson owns it now.”  John had seen the coat-of-arms and the founder’s portrait in the Hall’s main entry, followed by formal portraits of the Leybourne patriarchs up until the current owner, Phillip Leybourne, who’d clearly inherited Harold’s weak chin and short legs, too.
Once she’d shown them the main room, they walked back to the reception area, past a room used as a beauty salon and another very busy area devoted to feet and hands.  Finally they reached a corridor flanked by potted rose bushes.  These were in bloom and smelled heavenly.  “Through here are our massage rooms and VIP areas,” explained Lillian.  “Each room is themed - not too overtly, of course - but we’ve tried to incorporate beauty and relaxation practices from all over the world, and thought it would be appropriate to reflect that philosophy into the decor.”
John narrowed his eyes.  There were two arrivals via helicopter last night, he was sure of it.  He opened his mouth to protest, but was cut off.
“Luke and Mitchell came in and out, sure. But they were mainly outside, mowing, clipping.  They’d eat lunch inside. Lilly insisted that she would provide lunch.  You’d never know they had such an inheritance if you just met them, and they were so generous with what they had.”
You may have noticed the rating has gone up.  Haven't decided if this fic will get explicit yet, but there will be some sexytimes, for sure.
Sherlock was particularly fond of rimming and was stunningly good at it.  John had done it a dozen or so times with his previous female lovers, and the few times one of his partners had been kinky enough to reciprocate didn’t last for very long.  Sherlock, though.  Sherlock would keep licking and sucking for ages --until his jaw had to ache and his face was covered with saliva-- and enjoy every moment.  And God help him if it wasn’t the sexiest, most thrilling thing they’d done in the bedroom so far.
“And then she said that if I really wanted to live somewhere else, it could be arranged.  They were so furious with me that they sent me to stay with my Aunt Jean for a week.  I didn’t leave home again until I was officially allowed.”  John laughed, remembering.
He resolved to talk to her within the week.  Sherlock was wrong.  Life wasn’t futile.  He’d had his peace and quiet: it was time again to make some noise.
Sherlock was examining a package that looked like it contained several livers.  John should have found it macabre.  He didn’t.  “Of course.  They’re usually quite a bit smarter than the average criminal.  It would be an interesting challenge.  Getting into the mind of a killer, outsmarting him.  Most are men.  Statistically.  All sorts of motives, too.  And methods of murder.  There’s your ritualistic killer, usually some sort of zealot, the truly psychotic killer, unpredictable and dangerous, the greedy killer, who will eventually make a mistake: that’s Shipman for you.  There’s always the element of time involved, for a serial killer will kill again.  It’s an elaborate game between the killer and those who want to catch him.”
“Melissa, see if you can clear up something for them tomorrow,” she said.  “A two-hour couple’s block, if you can get it.”
“Anyhow,” said Sherlock, moving on from the pig parts to again assembling his chemical apparatus, “you don’t think my brother will mind too terribly much if I accidentally ruined his carpet, do you?  One of the bags seems to have sprung a leak.”
John allowed himself to relax even more, to concentrate on the heat of Sherlock behind him, the way he kissed his hole much like he kissed his mouth: he licked and nibbled, nipped and lipped, darted his tongue out, swiped it up and down, massaged in small circles, and went all out, fucking John’s arse with it.  It was wet and messy and utterly sexual, especially with Sherlock moaning away under there.  They were much alike that way: both got off on getting his partner off.
do you have sex toys?  Wait, I thought you said you know, um, didn’t have any desire to, you know, until I came along.”
The early afternoon was spent checking into at the Premier Inn and then figuring out the bus route to Sarah’s surgery.
John and trusted him to take care of his little brother.  John was sure the elder Holmes also knew his deeper feelings for Sherlock, but if he did, he never let on.  John wished he could put more faith in Mycroft, but his allegiances were devoted to Sherlock, no matter how good Mycroft’s intentions were.  The brothers used each other as they saw fit.  John sometimes felt a bit of pity at their estrangement, but, as he knew from experience, sibling relationships were far from easy.  Especially when one of them was a brilliant addict and the other wielded an enormous amount of power.
Sherlock smiled and brought his hands up, one roaming over John’s thigh as the other took hold of the fur-lined object.  The sensation of fur against the sensitive skin of his penis was almost ticklish, but not quite; instead, he could best describe it as soft, soft and warm, but not in the way a hand or mouth was.  Keeping his eyes closed, he focused on the different sensations produced by various pressures and speeds; moving the muff up and down on his cock felt a bit different from actually thrusting up into it.  It wasn’t tight by any means, and he wouldn’t be able to actually achieve orgasm from the act, but it was intensely arousing.  He was vaguely aware that John was touching his legs, running his palms over the hair on his calves up to the fleshy part of his thighs and then inward to fondle his testicles.  The inside of the muff was beginning to get slightly damp and he was ready to abandon it for something
“I’m inthatiable,” replied Sherlock, frowning when he realised his tongue wasn’t behaving.  “In-sa-tiable,” he clarified.  “Addictive personality.”
“Don’t bother.  This is likely the best room this place has.  If you’re brother’s footing the bill, then I say we spend liberally and make him wish he’d never asked you for favours in the first place.”
before manoeuvring himself so he was propped up semi-supine against the headboard, supported by pillows.  He spread his legs and helped John position himself between them so they were facing each other and close enough to kiss.
Sherlock shrugged, clearly proud of himself for making John laugh.  “How’s your shoulder?” he asked.
In which John gains his bearings and begins to feel like himself again.  But is he alone at Holmes Hall?
But what if he didn’t?  John could hear it now:  “Yes, John, I concur that we should progress our relationship into the realm of romantic as I do find you pleasant enough and of sufficient, if fairly average, intelligence that I would be willing to remove my clothes so we may achieve mutual orgasm.”
John agreed wholeheartedly.  He had envisioned some frilly women-only terrain.  This was nothing he could have imagined.  No wonder his ex was so keen to come, or why Mycroft was a regular.  He would never mock the man for that again.
“Reverse psychology is not going to work, John,” grumbled Sherlock at the same time his stomach protested its lack of sustenance -- loudly.  “Traitor,” he said to it, lifting his head off the pillow.
John manoeuvred through a group of people, using his stature to his advantage, and came out right in front of the startled, blue-faced runner.  He pivoted to dodge him, then leapt over a small hedge.
They stood there, leaning against the open casement and staring out into the dark, the playful mood of moments ago given way to quiet solemnity.  Eventually, John yawned.
“Yeah,” said John.  “Every day.”  He wanted to say more, he really did, but the words were stuck.  Lestrade seemed to understand, though, and so they worked in fairly companionable silence for the rest of the afternoon.  By the time they cleared the entire bed and carted the mess over to the compost heap, John was sore and sweaty and felt wonderful.  He ate a cold supper by himself, took a swim, and then retired to his room where he composed a short but rather funny (he thought, anyway) entry about spring fever in his blog.
“Well, don’t think too hard about it.  You ought to go visit Mr. Chapman some time.  I think he’d like to see you.”
The violinist was extraordinary.  Even without any real musical training, John could tell that the piece was intricate and challenging.  Sometime during the first movement, John risked a glance at his flatmate, who suspiciously was showing none of his usual signs of being forced to be still: no jittery legs, tapping fingers, gnashing of teeth.  In the darkness, Sherlock sat with his eyes closed.  He looked like a statue.  Asleep, even.  Well, if he wanted to sleep through the thing, so be it.
“And do what?  Go for a walk?  Have a look at the horses?  Roam around the library?  Have scintillating conversation with the housekeeper? Dull.  Dull, dull, dull.”
“Are we still doing innuendo?” Sherlock asked, taking a moment to rub their cocks together, “because if so, I’m rather eager to be plundered.”
First he walked away from the house to the north-west, where a stream marked the western boundary of the property.  Several acres of pheasant run bordered the south of the property; John stood next to the tall, dead grass and watched the withered stalks blow in the breeze.  HIs grandfather had been an avid pheasant and upland game hunter.  As a child, John had visited his grandparents rarely, but he remembered the smell of his grandfather’s pipe and his thick Scottish brogue.  Grandma would cook the rich, dark meat with onions and potatoes, turnips and carrots until everything was tender and delicious.  Harry hated it and complained loudly about animal rights.  John would suck every piece off the bones, loudly, just to see her squirm.  Sometimes his grandfather would even let young John accompany him on a shoot, to handle the dog or carry the bag of birds once the men had shot their limit.  There were no pheasants in the deserts of Afghanistan.  There were spiders as big as his fist, and scorpions that could cause necrosis within hours.  He still longed for his pack and pistol, but if he never saw another camel spider again, he would be eternally grateful.
At some point during their extended snogging session (Sherlock was currently going to town on John’s earlobe and neck), they had ended up on the bench at the far side of the warm pool, and John saw now that indeed the earth had been revolving; the dark of night was giving way.  It wasn’t light by far, but the skylights, which had been completely lost in the gloom of the vaulted ceilings, were now just visible.
There were a few items of interest, particularly a mouse that someone had placed in an ancient tin of sweets, but that, too, was not a cure for boredom.  The leather jacket was more stimulating.  It was vintage, late 1960s, with a red satin lining.  Someone had taken fairly good care of it; the leather was still supple.  Sherlock slipped off his dressing gown and tried it on; it fit perfectly.  He peered at himself in the mirror, holding his hair back with his hands.  He turned this way and that, decided the the jacket was worth keeping as a disguise, shrugged it off, and bent down to pick up the owl, which immediately lost its other wing.  He examined it thoroughly, deducing.  (Tawny Owl,
They quickly line up behind the gaping arse. The position looks a bit awkward, with one man kneeling behind the pig and the other squatting over him, but it works quite well. Soon, two large cocks slide in and out of the pig's wet hole.
John hugs Sherlock from behind, kissing his neck, before resting his chin on Sherlock's bony shoulder to watch the two women in front of them. Sally has by now dropped the riding crop and is instead holding tight to Kate's hair, almost breaking the woman's nose as she humps the maid's face, glistening with cunt juice and saliva. They both moan and pant until Sally goes rigid, her usually stern features for a moment softening in pure bliss.
“Come on, line me up.” John growls as he starts to pinch Kate's nipples, which makes her gasp out in pleasure. Sherlock gets on his knees again and grabs John's cock by the root, adjusting it until the head brushes against Kate's swollen vulva. Sherlock's fingers keep John's cook steady as Kate sinks slowly down on it, engulfing John in slippery heat.
The pain is like nothing Sherlock has ever felt. It's not just the burn and stretch, it's the unfamiliar intrusion that frightens Sherlock as well. His body screams at him that this is not right and fights this object inserted into him, into a place where it's not meant to be. John works it in regardless.
“I'm yours.” Sherlock breaths as he turns his head to catch John's eyes before kissing his yaw. “You can do what you want with me. Anything you want. I'll let you. I'm yours.”
It feels like his balls might actually explode when, instead of the expected large, firm device something soft and wet brushes over his hole. It takes Sherlock approximately ten seconds to realise that John is actually licking his arsehole. It's so good, Sherlock can't believe this is happening. As John pushes his tongue inside Sherlock's exquisitely stretched rectum his eyes roll back in his head and a keening whine escapes his throat.
He licks and licks while John slowly opens wider and wider, fisting his cock. He's panting. When Sherlock insistently laps over the sensitive ring of muscle, John groans and presses back. Sherlock nibbles and sucks until he can feel John's rim give way. Everything is slippery with saliva, the blond hair darkened with spit, clinging to the smooth skin of John's arse cheeks.
“Here, the police asks for anyone attending last night's party to come forward. I doubt our presence went unnoticed.” Sherlock arches an eyebrow. “People will mention us. And we've been to his private quarters as well. Surely we left… evidence. So, obviously we should come forward. Only, this will put us on their files.”
When John did manage to return home after another gruelling shift, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.  John did notice the smell right away, but once properly in the flat the lemony smell was replaced with something a bit more chemical-y.  Apparently Sherlock had not only gone to town with his chemistry set, but the entire kitchen, sink, counters, and hob were a complete wreck.  It looked like had been distilling something at one point, and a pot full of some dark green liquid was balanced precariously on a burner.  John bent down and sniffed it - something pine, astringent, minty.
“Sherlock Holmes.  There’s something not right with him.  He lives for things like this.  Gets off on it.  It’s sick.”
Another flock of geese flew overhead, their V formation breaking up.  “Geese don’t choose a leader,” John said at last.  “One bird takes the lead, and then when it tires, another one takes its place.  There’s no communication.  The lead bird doesn’t send a text to the rest of the flock saying, ‘Take over, mate, I’m knackered.’  The birds just
John forgot about the violinist.  The rest of the concert he marvelled at his friend, his bizarre, complex, brilliant friend, completely losing it over...music.  Sherlock was emotionally responsive to music, John knew, but not like this.  He wondered whether his flatmate wept when he played in those dark and haunted hours of the morning, if the music quieted the riot of his brain, calmed the raging beast, or if it were more invigorating, like opening a floodgate that Sherlock had trained himself to keep closed: emotion -- repress at all costs.  Was it the piece?  Was he remembering something from his childhood?  A former lover, perhaps?  Maybe a music tutor?  John hadn’t the foggiest, and he was suddenly sad that he didn’t know, that he wasn’t privy to all of Sherlock’s secrets.
“Robert Leybourne had to have known the risks,” said Sherlock, having paused his deliberate crunching.  “I’ll be interested to know exactly what else he’s been working on.”
Mycroft nodded at his brother, who nodded back, then went to collect his umbrella and coat.  “I’ll send a car in half an hour.  Your help is appreciated.”
It pains me to say it, and I will deny it if questioned, but this place is romantic.  It’s beautiful, has a fascinating history, the garden has been intelligently planted with several bee-friendly varieties of rose, and I really do enjoy swimming.  It has provided me the perfect opportunity to force the issue, much to my initial discomfort.  I’m not sure if he knows what he would have done to me if I were met with rejection.  I might have just broken.  Right there, dissolved into atoms and become one with that salted water.  Sherlock Holmes, deceased, cause of death: molecular disintegration from a broken heart.
Sherlock nodded again, and John found himself smiling on the way back to his room.  He showered and changed his clothes before heading to the kitchen to make something to eat, adding an extra sandwich and an apple.  By the time he got back to the east wing, Sherlock’s unpacking was well underway.  The door was open, so John let himself in.  Books were everywhere.
The crowd parted to let the ambulance through.  Some officials from the race had joined the scene, too.  They, too, were covered in coloured powder, but were distinguishable from the racers by their caps, radios, and what-once-were-red polo shirts.   “Anaphylaxis,” John told the paramedics as they helped Barbara onto a stretcher and attached a blood pressure cuff.  “Allergy to pistachios.  Although I can’t imagine she’d ingest one while...”
John cosied up behind him, pulling the duvet over them both.  “That was lovely,” he said, kissing Sherlock between his shoulder blades.
As soon as she was out of sight, Sherlock steered John over to the windows overlooking the garden.  “You were flirting with her,” he accused under his breath.
“I”ll text you.”  And then, Sherlock was off, leaving John standing in the dark.  He fumbled in his jacket for a miniature torch, and waited until his eyes adjusted enough to find his way to the large pool area before turning it on.
They’d experimented with different positions; but John could tell, right now, that Sherlock wanted to move.  How the man had the energy John would never know.
Sherlock frowned and gathered an armful of textbooks.  “It wasn’t like that.  My parents, for all the money, were exceedingly
“Of course, John,”  Sherlock sighed, frowning.  Perhaps he didn’t want to play this game after all, but John was going to take what he could get.
They hadn’t done it in a chair before, unless you count the blowjobs they’d given each other on Mycroft’s sofa.  So far their episodes of penetrative sex were limited to the bedroom.  Sherlock didn’t speak much of his sexual history, but from what John could gather it was limited and experimental.  Either that, or done in exchange for drugs.  Sickened at the prospect of anyone causing the man he loved harm or using him, John vowed to make every time they had sex meaningful, loving, nurturing, and safe.  (At least, John figured, until they had reached a point where they’d grown comfortable communicating their needs and desires with one another.)  So, sex had been in a safe and cosy bed, where afterward they could lie entwined, breathing each other’s air and holding on to one another, two men clinging to driftwood in an ocean.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide and he windmilled about.  John immediately let go of the ladder as Sherlock’s feet pushed it forward and braced himself to catch Sherlock himself as he toppled backward.  The ladder clattered to the ground.  John’s shoulder protested at the strain of catching a heavy body; he bit his lip against the pain and kept Sherlock from knocking both of them over.
Mycroft is undaunted, and John finds his interest piqued as the older Holmes details the case.  Sherlock
“I haven’t slept for almost 72 hours, either. I don’t sleep much as it is, but I’d rather be sleeping than rolling around in my own sweat.”  He plucked at his t-shirt.  “Disgusting.”
John slid two nicotine patches under the door.  He took the rest back to his room, pulled on his old clothes, which had now been relegated to gardening attire, tucked the keys to the hidden garden into his pocket and headed out.
“Christ, I knew you’d want to know.  Fine.  If you want to stick it under a microscope, go ahead.  I just don’t want to know about it.  No spreadsheets.”
John huffed a dry laugh.  “No.  I don’t.  In fact I rather like you, although I’ll be damned if I know why.”
Sherlock showed no signs of leaving.  John wasn’t quite sure what to do, so he stood there stupidly before putting the kettle on.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A robin flew down and landed on the upper tier of the fountain, bathing itself momentarily before flitting off again.  “I think that bird’s been keeping tabs on me,” said John.
“What?” said John, lingering in the doorway.  “No dramatic arrival?  Did you teleport here?  Didn’t want to warn me of your arrival?”
“I know,” John said, and kissed Sherlock in response, a soft and tender kiss that spoke the depths of his own affection.
John steered her toward a chair at the table and took over, flinging a kitchen towel over his shoulder and rolling up his shirtsleeves.  He flipped the eggs and poked at the sausages a bit before beginning to clean up the mess.
“I don’t feel brave.  In fact, I’m really fucking nervous.”  John laughed a bit.  He held up his hands as proof - they were trembling, slightly.  “Take those off,” he said to Sherlock, a smile in his voice, “because there’s no way I’m going to get your shoes untied in this state.”
John kept his touch light as he spread the oil; Sherlock’s cock leapt in his hands.  John marvelled at its weight and heat.  Gorgeous.  Simply gorgeous.
He, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson had delightful roast pheasant for supper, and after a game of snooker with the two of them (turned out Mrs. Hudson wasn’t half bad), John retired for the night.
The wind continued to blow.  A flock of geese flew overhead, heading toward the pond they’d walked by earlier.  Birds sang and squirrels scurried and John’s heart pounded with new knowledge.  He stood, ready to head back, when Sherlock grabbed his hand and pulled him back down.
Hands it would remain, then, and John smiled down at his lover, who was beginning to lift his hips clean off the bed.  Seeing Sherlock like this was so incredibly special - Sherlock, whose brain never seemed to stop, whose body was always so full of nervous energy, was now reined in, so beautifully human.  Yet at the same time, John felt that he held something truly remarkable in his hands, something more than human, something divine and just for him.  He had never loved anyone this way, or so much.  He would spend the rest of his life showing Sherlock just how much he loved him, with his words, his lips, his tongue, his fingers.  There would be so much time for exploring, for breaking out those toys (good God), for quick and dirty sex under the sweep of the Belstaff, a blowjob in an alleyway, groping in a cab.  But now, John just wanted to Sherlock to understand, really, truly understand, just how treasured and loved he was.  He’d always considered his hands tools of his trade; healer’s hands, those that fixed broken things.  Sherlock Holmes was far from broken, but he could still benefit from a healing touch, one that would soothe his manic highs and deliver him from his depressive lows, touch that would help ground him on a human plane, one in which the physical manifestation of their love for each other could exist, boundless.
Several hours later he woke up from a night terror, sweating and shaking.  He got up, used the toilet, washed his face, and tugged on his slippers and dressing gown.  It was 4am.
John began to walk to the back patio, where he could take a look at the fountain and swimming pool, when he heard Lestrade call back.
“Oh, John, please come quickly.  You’ve got to stop him.”  She is generally capable of handling anything Sherlock can dish out without batting an eyelash, but Mrs. Hudson sounds truly distressed.
He slept the two and half hour journey -- the rocking of the train somehow reminding him of military transport over uneven terrain.  Transport was frequently one of the only times when he
The first contact of his erection against the smooth skin of Sherlock’s abdomen was nearly too much to bear.  John deepened the kiss, meeting Sherlock’s tongue, hot and wet.  He heard himself groan, a needy, plaintive sound.  Sherlock pulled back a bit, gazed at John with hooded eyes, whispered, “More,” and eagerly went about getting what he wanted.
John perused the documents and found nothing.  “If he does have flat feet,” he said, “it must not have troubled him enough for him to need orthotics.  What we really need is to see one of his shoes.  How do we do that?”
John took his time standing -- her appearance had given him quite a fright and now his leg was acting up -- and led her to the area he’d been working on near the stump of the plum tree.  He’d cleared the area completely, and had begun loosening the soil.  “I thought I’d plant these here.”
There was a long pause as Sherlock processed this information.  “So we ‘christen’ the new place.  Are you suggesting we say goodbye to Holmes Hall in much the same manner?”
“Go and get me one of those now,” said Mr. Chapman, and John retrieved a jar of the golden liquid from its display.  “Crusty bugger yells at me every day about eating it myself and forgetting to pay.  Helps with allergies, you know.”  He winked.  “Sherlock used to love the stuff.  Archibald bought a jar nearly every week.”
Our lips meet, again and again.  Kissing was always easy between us, from the very first time we closed the gap between our faces.  I rub my nose over his, cradle his cheeks with my hands, lick into his mouth and let him lick into mine.  Sometimes he sucks at my tongue, other times he nibbles at my lower lip.  The taste of his saliva, morning breath and all, is incredibly provocative to me.  We both have stubble this morning; his grows faster than mine does.  I like the contrast of the smoothness of his lips.  I’m half on him now, our hips moving together as I kiss him again and again until we are both panting.  When I need air, I kiss his beloved temple, his earlobe, his eyelids, the tip of his nose, until he slots our mouths together again.  I have to admit that I never truly found this aspect of lovemaking all that worthwhile until John.  My former lovers were perfunctory kissers at best.  One tried to eat my face, I’m quite sure (rather unpleasant).  John has taught me a thing or two about how to do it properly, how to do this slick and intimate dance.
Mike opened the door to a room marked “Lab 4” and switched on the lights.  It was a small standard classroom, with several workstations, two chemical hoods on each side, and metal stools surrounding a central lab table. It was clean and gleaming, newly remodeled.
He stroked the fur a few times with the palm of his hand.  It was soft, exceptionally so, its various shades of grey, very light silver to nearly smoky blue, pleasing to the eye.  Chinchilla, then.  He held it to his nose, breathed deeply.  No foul odour -- slightly dusty from being in storage, but kept away from damp.  He held it to his cheek, savoured its softness.  He plunged his hands inside it, held it in front of him like a proper lady.  His hands were too big; it was meant for small, delicate digits, but the silk was so smooth and the inside was so warm and suddenly Sherlock was overcome with a compulsion to see how the rest of his skin would react to the sensation of soft fur gliding across it.
John cracked his knuckles before reaching for the door.  He inched it open as quietly as possible.  Just to look, just to see.  Sherlock and the man were talking close together midway down the alley. John exhaled a shaky breath, so very relieved that he didn’t interrupt anything sexual, for if he’d seen Sherlock on his knees for that man, he probably would have vomited.
They were two bodies, sharing space, living together, behaving badly together, learning from one another.  A strange but very strong friendship.
could!  I’ll bet you a fiver we have had our first gay couple consummating their marriage.  That would explain the abundance of oil.  And the abundance of, um, semen.  Whatever would the old fart upstairs think?”
After a moment of speculation, Sherlock sat up, twisted himself around as best he could now that he was trapped between John, the blanket, and the couch.  He worried his lower lip a moment before deciding John wasn’t teasing, and then leaned in expectantly for a kiss, which John obliged until he himself was feeling a little breathless.
“They were a purple limited edition,” Sherlock explains as if that were the best justification in the world.  He’s serious, too.
“He loves me,” said Sherlock, voice deep and evocative.  He licked his lips nervously before tossing the petal away.  “He loves me not.”
“We’re not finished,” John said as they started to stroll slowly along the path.  “And we’re not going to, not before the place sells.  It’s just too much work for two people.  But we’ve done enough, I think.”
John tried to hide his embarrassment but felt the heat creep into his face in spite of himself.  “I am incredibly uptight,” he said with a laugh.  “That, and I’m not sure I’ll ever enjoy anal sex.  Had a bit of an unfortunate experience with a substantial rubber cock.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock whispered.  “Christ, John.  I can feel you in me, so hard.  So...hot.  You’re so beautiful.  More.”  He reached his own hand down between them to touch himself, softly at first.  John had to change positions a bit to accommodate him.  He’d begun to rotate his hips a bit on every thrust in, encouraged by the grunts of pleasure Sherlock was making.  John had known Sherlock would be vocal in bed, but there was something so masculine, nearly animal in nature - not the breathy pants or orgasmic screams of a woman, but the sounds of a man lost in the throes of pleasure.  Just thinking about it would get John hard years into the future: Sherlock’s own sex soundtrack.
“Look,” he said, and pointed.  There, on the ivy that climbed the garden walls, was the robin, singing her farewells.
With a sigh, John hauled himself up, dusted his knees, and left the garden, carefully shutting and locking the door behind him and sneaking out from the curtain of ivy.
“Oh.  John.  Hi.  These things.  Hybrid tea roses.  Pain in the arse.  If they don’t have bugs, they have mould.  If they don’t have mould, they have bugs.  And this one?  This one hasn’t bloomed in years and I’ll be damned if I can’t figure out why.  It’s starting to bud, here, see?  But these will just rot and fall off in a few weeks and that’s that.”
“I’m ambivalent about facial hair, John, but I thought...”  he looked shy all of a sudden, and swam back in the pool a bit so that they weren’t touching anymore.  “...I thought you would find it off-putting.  And I was hoping...that one day... one day you might kiss me and I didn’t want you to...feel so different...with a man and...so I shaved every morning, every single morning...just in case.”  Sherlock trailed off, looked down, and ran his hands over the surface of the water.
John rolled over, tucked his arms under his head, and looked at the ornate ceiling.  “Of course.  But you know, Sherlock, I find that I can’t really be arsed.  You’ve got a case, I’m going to relax, have a nice massage, eat like a pig, and we’re going to have a proper holiday.  I couldn’t give a fuck about what anyone thinks right now.”
“Well, I was attempting to make a name for myself as a consulting detective.   Someone the police can turn to when they are stumped, which is always, because most of them are idiots.  Maybe I’d take private clients.  I have a website,” he added proudly.
“There’s no growth at all,” remarked John, brain back online.  “And if it was within the past twenty-four hours, I’d expect some degree of irritation, even if his denuding was routine.  Oh God.  Do you think it was done post-mortem?”
“So why the tuba?” John asks, sitting at the table with a late breakfast of poached eggs on toast.  He’s halfheartedly reading the
John flushed the toilet and stared at the bottle before turning the shower on.  Like as not Sherlock was intently listening to his movements; nothing was sacred.  With the shower running, Sherlock was less likely to hear John take the bottle and examine it; it didn’t look like any had been used, but the seal had indeed been broken.  He unscrewed the cap and tentatively sniffed - it really was a lovely smell.  Not too feminine or masculine, very natural, vaguely redolent of the tropics.  Holding his finger over the top of the bottle, he tipped it upside down and right side up again, then licked what remained.  Nearly tasteless, too.  Based on its simple ingredients, he didn’t really expect much.  Nutty, maybe.  How had Sherlock known that this was the one he had been looking at?
Like her private grotto, Lillian’s office was perfectly tailored to her tastes, an eclectic blend of Western modern and Eastern exotic.  John noticed right away the absence of diplomas on the wall; most professionals framed and hung theirs.
Tell him?  Tell him what?  What was it he wanted to hear?  John, holding on to Sherlock with every ounce of his strength, could think of nothing coherent to say, except for the words that were already there, ready to tumble out of his mouth. One final thrust, deep, and John was coming -- again -- as he clung to Sherlock’s trembling form.
), my need dissolving into the drivel on the pages of a romance novel (turgid flesh, engorged member, throbbing cock).  Yet it is what it is: He has a gorgeous arse.  I want to put my cock in it.  I want to be inside him, want to part his cheeks and penetrate him, watch his anus stretch around me, feel his heat.
“It’s so nice to cook for someone else again,” she tittered as she dipped bread into eggs.  “Lestrade’s a nice man, but he so rarely stays for supper unless Mycroft is around.  Meals used to be such a special time, and we’d all gather together in here -- not in that stuffy old dining room unless we had some special guests, mind you -- and we’d talk and drink nice wine and it was lovely.”
John realized Sherlock was correct - it was possible to go off just by the act itself, the giving of pleasure; his own body felt the pull of orgasm, the familiar build deep in his pelvis - and tried to reach down to touch himself when Sherlock suddenly sat up, eyes dark, wide, and wild.  He slapped both of his hands to John’s face, kissed him deeply, and then threw himself over on all fours, arse in the air.  “Just put us together,” he commanded roughly.
There were a long few minutes where the two Holmes brothers engaged in an entire mental conversation to which John was not privy.
Afraid to even breathe, John looked up.  He was oddly aware of the rapid increase of his pulse.  A strange sensation in his chest made him briefly wonder if he was having a heart attack.  Sherlock’s eyes were still closed.  “Please continue,” he said.
“Of course I am!” Sherlock yelled dramatically, his voice ringing through the dark hallway.  “Although I did have an uncle who dressed as a woman every so often; as far as I know, I am only the second homosexual Holmes.”  He frowned at himself and tested the words together again, amused by the alliteration.
He would have liked to have said it was a dream, that some horrible buggy-eyed, drooling monster was advancing upon him.  Or that he thought there was an animal in the room, some rabid raccoon.  Or that it was a nightmare about Afghanistan, that the sound was reminiscent of a 50-calibre machine gun.
John chewed, swallowed, and looked across at Mycroft dubiously.  “Really?  You’re offering me congratulations?”
John’s stomach growls loudly.  Sherlock stares at the stick, must equate it with sustenance, and offers it to John.  John shrugs.  Accepts it.  They sit on the sofa.
Sherlock relaxed.  John tucked his face between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, inhaling the scent of his skin.  He smelled a bit like the garden, John supposed, earthy and sweet, the way the soil did after he’d tilled it by hand.  It was an appropriate metaphor for the current phase of his life.  A new beginning: breaking up the old, the dry and useless, to establish a new purpose, fresh soil for new seeds.  Sherlock had already insinuated himself into John’s life and put down roots, deep and strong. John wondered what would bloom.  Whatever it would be, it would be strange, wonderful, and theirs.
He awakened the next morning to find the electricity was back on. He showered, shaved, and got ready for work, thankful that the trains were all running on time and that the storm hadn’t caused any delays for morning commuters.
When John unties the leash from the desk leg and tells Sherlock to lie down on his back, Sherlock almost melts onto the floor, hands stretched out above his head. John keeps the leash in one fist as he squats over Sherlock's face, his feet on either side of Sherlock's head as he lowers his arse right onto Sherlock’s waiting mouth.
“Please, don't.” Sherlock whispers. Mycroft squeezes his balls so hard that he sees stars and has to sharply suck in a breath.
“I have to feel confined and abandoned... left behind, for this to do things to me. Please, John, trust me with this.” Sherlock begs until John finally relents. He knows it's crazy and irresponsible – but that's how they are.
John allows Sherlock to take off his ruined knickers - only to stuff them into his mouth to muffle his cries. It takes some time, effort, and a lot more lube, but finally the toy sits in place, positively filling Sherlock to the rim.
“Please, lets go out. My brain is rotting. I need some diversion.” Sherlock begs, his voice like molten chocolate.
John  senses Sherlock slowly approaching, his bare feet hardly making any noise on the carpet. He stops and lingers in the doorway, leaning against the frame as John turns again to face him. Sherlock smiles invitingly, looking positively pornographic with his clingy silk robe hugging his pale, lithe body, his dishevelled curls a dark halo against the light; a debauched fallen angel, watching John from hooded eyes.
John's eyes travel down his flushed torso. Sherlock's cock stands proud between his legs, hard and leaking. John smiles. “You like that as well.” He states. Sherlock's nods, his eyes still closed.
After getting started it becomes easier. He just lets it flow, quickly kneeling in a puddle of cooling piss. John gets a teatowel and starts to mop up a bit of the urine, only to wring the cloth out above Sherlock's head. Piss starts to drip down his face as John repeats it again and again. Sherlock pants and opens his mouth to catch some drops. His dish had been very spicy; Sherlock is thirsty.
“John, please...” Sherlock whispers, almost choking on his embarrassment because he knows that he will do what John wants from him regardless; but the shame is so intense that he desperately tries to bargain nonetheless.
“You have a dead, castrated paedophile in your basement, who was killed while engaging in sexual activities with a minor. As both are tied up, there must have been a third party present.”
“You forget that I still have the video.” John says, wiping that cheeky grin off Mycroft's face in an instant. “The one in which you fuck your brother so hard he almost passes out. The one in which you beat and strangle him. Imagine your parents having to watch that.”
Because that’s for him to do! Not for some random stranger. John is his. Tasting his cock is his reward and privilege for submitting to his every whim without hesitation.
John doesn't care. He pounds into Sherlock's mouth, holding him by his curls while grunting in encouragement. Thankfully, it doesn't take long for him to come down Sherlock's throat. After pulling out, he holds Sherlock's chin up in a vice-like grip for long moments, watching come and spit drip from Sherlock's swollen lips. All the while, Sherlock keeps his fingertip inside his glans as John hasn't allowed him to remove it.
Mycroft shakes his head. This is bordering on obsessiveness. Yet he can't let go, at least not without being absolutely certain. It tortures him. Who'd thought his little brother would be able to extort such power over him after his death? It's ridiculous...
It seems that Mycroft has brought a bunch of people. Colleagues? Friends? Adversaries? They are all well-groomed, dressed to the ninth, middle aged men. One of them, a balding yet fit looking bloke in his early fifties, holds a Great Dane on a leash.
Back at the flat, John invites his guest – his name is Mark – to pour himself a drink while he gets Sherlock from the cupboard, placing him in the middle of the bedroom floor. The light is dimmed but Sherlock squints nonetheless after the darkness in the wardrobe. He's not sure what's about to happen next and tenses a little. John, sensing his uneasiness, brushes a dark curl from his forehead and smiles down at him assuringly.
John only stops when his arm starts to hurt. He breathes hard through his nose and rolls his shoulder to calm down a fraction. The only other sound in the kitchen is Sherlock quietly sobbing while blood drips from his face onto the linoleum. His eyes are closed as he waits for John to continue his punishment.
The sounds Sherlock makes are outright obscene as he laps and slurps, drinks down and swallows and swallows, grunting, gurgling, until the floor is finally almost dry and clean. His face and hair are wet with piss when he's finished, dripping onto his t-shirt as John pulls him up on his knees by his short blond spikes.
John just hums and turns onto the M40. They only stop once again at the outskirts of High Wycombe for Sherlock to call his parents and inform them of their imminent arrival. John can hear how worried Sherlock's mum sounds even over the phone. Her son almost never calls. He must be in deep if he does voluntarily.
Sherlock moans and does as he's told. John pushes into his hot, wet mouth. Deep. Deeper. Sherlock chokes and gags. But he swallows, sucks, otherwise keeping perfectly still. He's just a soggy hole. As John's cock hits the back of his throat he retches, but John grabs his head and vicelike holds him in place.
Sherlock opens his eyes again and just stares back at Moriarty, frozen in horror. There's nothing he can do but listen as that sweet Irish lilt continues: “You know, I've got contacts with the press. There's a lovely little journalist, named Kitty Riley, writing for one of the big tabloids. She's very keen. What do you think she would do with a tip-off like this. I can already see the headlines: Famous consulting detective engages in perverse sex games with older sibling. Perhaps they'd put it a tit more fanciful, though. You know, employ some four letter words...” Suddenly, Moriarty's face is only inches away from Sherlock's, who can feel the other man's spit hit his face as he hisses: “This would not only ruin you, it would kill your brother's career as well. Did he tell you what was done to me on behalf of the British government?” Sherlock minutely shakes his head, staring up at the enraged grimace hovering over him, desperately trying to hide how terrified he truly is behind a blank face.
Another fierce nod, accompanied by a low moan. Sherlock blushes, a pink flush spreading all the way down his torso.
John stands up and turns Sherlock towards himself, his body shaking because of the endorphins released. There's a kind look in John's eyes as he takes the needle from Sherlock's trembling fingers before carefully applying antiseptic to Sherlock's aching lips, wiping them with a soft cotton pad. Sherlock can only growl at the burning pain, cringing, but John cradles his head in his hand and holds his face in place until the blood has been cleaned away.
And suddenly there are five fingers inside Sherlock, pressing, rubbing, fucking him. He feels filled to the brim but somehow it's still not enough. The pain has receded and he therefore spreads his legs wider and pushes up his arse, inviting the intrusion, seeking to be good for John. He's offering himself up on a plate, all for John to take and claim.
Sherlock hadn’t expected this. He’s more than a little helpless in the face of John’s devastation. Unsure of what else to do, he crawls over to a little table by the sole window. There’s a bottle on top of it, which he passes to John, staying an arm-length away. John just sets it to his lips and takes a large swig. It burns, restoring some warmth to his frozen body.. Cognac. John takes another sip, coughs, wipes his mouth with the back of one shaking hand.
“A text from Molly. Apparently, she found something on the dead girl... she wants me to come to Bart's to take a look myself.” He's already shrugging on his Belstaff.
He's so far gone that at first it doesn't register that Ginger has taken his flaccid cock in hand and is lazily pissing over Sherlock's shoulders and back. Soon, the other three men join him, glazing Sherlock's body in hot yellow urine. They aim for his face and crotch alike, and Sherlock squirms and opens his mouth while spreading his legs to allow their piss access to all parts of his body. The yellow liquid hits Sherlock's chest and arse, splatters onto the floor, and it's so unbelievably hot that Sherlock can't control his body any longer, despite his want to prolong this sweet humiliation. His orgasm crashes over him as he throws his head back, baring his throat, eyes wide open, and then he shoots load after load over the kitchen floor, gasping while making inarticulate keening noises.
“Clean him as well. But tenderly.” John tells Sherlock, who dives forward and buries his face between the pig's spread cheeks.
“They'd reserved the room for two hours. When they didn't check out in time, Kate came to me and informed me. We gave them another quarter of an hour, but then I went downstairs to have a look. I do have a master key in cases of... emergency. That's when I found them.” Her face stays calm and collected. Sherlock is suddenly sure that it hasn't  been the first time that Irene Adler had encountered violent death. “I instructed Kate to let the fire alarm go off. That quickly cleared the premises. We have some very discreet security guards on hand. They ensured all parties left with the very minimum of fuss. When everyone was gone I called your brother.”
John makes himself some coffee while he listens to Sherlock's deep voice scolding some unfortunate caller.
And so Sherlock greedily swallows his own piss down from a bottle he'd just had up his arse, blushing furiously, tasting his salty urine while John watches, smiling.
“Not by name, no. But as they always arrived as a party of three, I thought they were father, daughter and mother. I certainly knew Lord Saint Clair. He was recommended by another member. The girl never spoke.”
With a small sigh Sherlock sinks onto his knees in the middle of their living room. His back and upper arms are covered in gauze dressings. His cock is still sore from the beating with the belt. A bandage is wrapped around his left knee. His body looks like a battlefield.
John touches his nipples, and fastens something to his left nipple ring. A piece of twine? Yes, it must be, for as John repeats whatever he's doing on Sherlock's right nipple, there's suddenly a heavy weight attached to the rings.
Sherlock's lips close around the rubber glans as he moans in appreciation. He'd love to do that for John.
When John finally unties the ropes, Sherlock is allowed to crawl over to the chest of drawers and decide on the plug he'll be stuffed with tonight. His kimono hangs open, one suspender has come loose and the stocking starts to roll down his leg, yet he still looks sexy as hell as he kneels onto the floor, gazing at the toys lined up for him. He seems to waver between a very large black cone-shaped silicone dildo or a string of extremely big anal beads until his eyes settle on something that looks like some kind of hollow cuff made of corrugated black rubber.
That night Sherlock looks up some of the websites John has been browsing. He expects the usual amount of slightly disturbing kinky stuff but it's all rather low key and stylish, with some quite aesthetic but very harmless pictures of artfully tied up bodies. Most sites offer private sessions to cater for the specific tastes of the customers. The services provided sound almost businesslike (medical, corporal punishment, sensation play). Honestly, it doesn't do much for Sherlock. For the first time he thinks John might be right about him.
“Tell me how much you liked it.” Moriarty's demands, slowly removing whatever he pushed up Sherlock's arse.
“God, this looks beautiful.” John whispers and kneads Sherlock's buttocks before taking two short hemp ropes t to tie Sherlock's ankles to the table legs. Sherlock is openly crying by now, his whole body jerking in spasms.
“Sherlock...,” he whispers, reaching out a trembling hand before toppling over, falling to his knees, vomiting all over the concrete.
Both his Mum and Dad start to fuss over Sherlock, asking questions simultaneously, offering assistance, but their son just shakes his head and asks for his old room.
“John, please, I know it's a shock, but you have to calm down. You are attracting attention.” The voice mumbles, suddenly shockingly near John’s left ear, warm breath ghosting over prickling skin. Do hallucinations always feel this real?
“I told you I could arrange for a body to be found and identified as yours.” Sherlock half turns around, looking up at John from under his lashes, utterly debauched.
They just stare at each other. John wants to fuck Sherlock until he screams his name but they have an important appointment today that is not to be missed. There are preparations to be made. And John will take care of that.
“About that party tonight...,” John says as he shimmies up Sherlock's body until he's squatting with spread knees over Sherlock's face, presenting his hole to be licked, “we could go...”
John smiles: “Get on your hands and knees.” As Sherlock bends forwards, he moans as the weights dangle from his chest, pulling at his nipples, stretching the skin. He's thin and doesn't sport much body fat, however, therefore they don't droop much. Sherlock's head is bowed so that he can watch. His cock juts out between his legs, twitching and leaking. His breathing is speeding up.
Sherlock's nipple rings shimmer in the candlelight as they step from the changing room. candelabras are everywhere, the fluttering flames of what must be thousands of candles dancing over the painted walls of the house as Sherlock and John ascend the broad staircase to reach the first floor where the ballroom is situated.
Sherlock desperately tries to relax and briefly closes his eyes. John pinches his cock rather brutally to get his attention back to the task at hand and, surprised by the pain, Sherlock opens his eyes in shock and manages to dribble a few droplets of piss into the jar. He gasps in disgust but now that the floodgates are open it's rather easy to just let it flow from his body until the jar is nearly full. Despite an appreciative low moan of encouragement from John Sherlock's face is still flushed bright red as John screws the lid shut and puts the jar on the table next to the blood sample.
“Did you prepare yourself as I told you?” John groans between kisses, holding Sherlock's wrists with his left hand above his head in a death-grip.
He starts to float on the pain, eventually rolling onto his back and stretching himself out, savouring the new sensation of different parts of his skin being ripped open. He feels almost high, wriggling in his metal bounds, hugging him like a bespoke cage.
Sherlock licks his lips before answering in a low, pleading voice: “Yes, fuck me, John. Please. It's been so long.”
“That's right, Sherlock, you are my slut. And I'll decide what's best for you. Now, take that hand of your cock before I'll break your fingers.”
On a tablet on the counter lie two small silver rings in a sealed plastic bag. Sherlock swallows as Toby pulls on latex gloves. He flinches when Toby disinfects his left nipple with a cotton puff dabbed in alcohol.
Suddenly, Moriarty moves away again and starts to roam the morgue. “You know, this is getting boring. I always liked or little tete-a-tetes. You were rather amusing sometimes.” Moriarty lifts a sheet, covering another gurney, preens under it, than puts it back down, smiling. “How about I remove that gag from your mouth? You only speak when asked, of course. Otherwise I'll send those pics to my friend. Agreed?”
The boy hadn't come yet, Sherlock remembers, giving as good as he gets while the boys hard-on pokes him in the chest. As they moan into each other's mouth, sharing spit and come, Acri chuckles, playing with his sub's nipples. Then he whispers something in his ear.
He fails to observe what exactly is tattooed into his skin. He's fairly certain that it's a word, but can't make out enough of it to guess what it might say. After about half an hour, it's finished. Toby wipes away blood and excessive ink before covering the fresh tattoo with a piece of cling film.
The burns are the worst; the blisters have started oozing. The cuts are horrible to look at as well. They seem to form words which John isn't sorry not being able to read. Luckily, no bones seem to be fractured, yet parts of Sherlock's face have turned a dark purple. His eyes are red and swollen. And he smells.
“I won't fuck you today again, then.” John says gently and Sherlock's sigh in response is equal part sorry and relieved. “But I've been so hard all afternoon I have to come again. And you are so beautiful like this.” John's finger caresses Sherlock's perineum. He has put cloth pins on Sherlock's ballsack again and teasingly flips against them. Sherlock moans. He's still hard as well.
But cut off his cock, give him breasts or remove his teeth? How far would they go? And would Sherlock let them?
While Sherlock crawls up the steps, John's eyes are fixed on the black tattoo above Sherlock's wiggling bum. They'll have to do something about that. The words seem disgusting now. John desperately wants Sherlock to forget what was done to him by his own flesh and blood.
“Now, urine.” John takes one of the jars from the table and opens it. Sherlock blushes bright crimson.
Sherlock stares up at John and is shocked by the cruel determination he sees in his face. He slowly reaches out for the tin; John releases his hand.
“Are you sure you don't want something else?” Sherlock whispers, looking up at John from beneath heavy eyelids while his right hand trails down his chest and comes to rest on his stomach just above his groin. John can feel his cock swelling in his jeans.
“Lovely... so lovely”, Greg praises him. “I'm going to put some stuff inside you now, Sherlock. I'm sure you don't mind me taking pictures, do you?”
It's still warm when the sun has set, bathing the garden in an almost violet glow. The city beneath them emanates orange light, bright enough to illuminate the grove, yet the tree branches swaying in the breeze suddenly look like thin arms, reaching out. The sudden eerie silence is filled with the sounds of the night: an owl howling, cicadas chirping, the call of a the toads living in the ponds... It rustled and crackles below the hedges and shrubberies as the nightly predators came out to hunt. Sherlock smiles. He likes the idea of slaughter all around them, invisible to the human eye like so many other things ordinary people miss.
John takes his chin between thumb and forefinger before he can wipe them away. Sherlock feels unmoored, reeling, and is unable to hide his disturbed state as John stares right into his eyes, deep down into his soul.
John, being a good doctor, has doubts. He knows it could be dangerous to leave Sherlock alone when bound so tightly, totally immobilised. He might get dehydrated or suffer from insufficient oxygen supply. Yet it seems to be the thing Sherlock wants. And who is John to deny Sherlock what he wants?
John watches the muscles in Sherlock's wiry arms work beneath his skin. It's usually perfect alabaster. Now, however, there are purple bruises covering his forearms, and John is reminded of what had been done to his lover. Anger wells up inside him, mixed with a fierce protectiveness that threatens to choke him. He moans softly, and Sherlock looks questioningly up at him, uncertainty in his eyes. John forces a smile onto his face as he tenderly cups Sherlock's face and strokes his cheekbone with his thumb. Sherlock relaxes visibly. John closes his eyes and tries to ignore the cuts and wounds and concentrates instead on enjoying Sherlock's touch.
