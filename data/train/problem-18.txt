She led him into the teacher’s bedroom and sat him in the chair next to the bed. The bed that still contained the sleeping woman. Irene sat on the bed and crossed one leg over the other and folded her arms, for which Sherlock was grateful.
Five mugs of the stuff later, the lower sixth meandered upstairs, trying with all their might not to spill anything on the carpet. John felt like he was eight again, sleeping over at his mate’s house, trying to laugh silently so as not to wake the grown-ups and struggling to make it to midnight.
John was sketching placidly when, a few minutes later, the door to the room swung open as if some mighty tornado had been the one responsible. Sherlock, the next best thing, marched in, clambered up onto his bed, fell back onto his duvet, and descended into full sulk mode.
“Why do you think?” John said, before turning back to Kitty. “If you don’t tell me who it is, I swear to god - ” Someone was making a
The boys seemed to be surrounding something, and as they parted to let John through, Sherlock saw that it was Lestrade, a piece of paper and a pencil in his hand. The crowd began to close up again, but Sherlock felt a hand grasp his arm, and he was pulled through to the front.
“– we require him or you to correspond with Ella within the week to arrange a meeting at the earliest opportunity, or we will be sending a community support officer to the address registered with us.’ What do you have to say for yourself, John?”
“Not uncensored, if at all,” John explained, and Sherlock seemed somewhat pacified. John turned up the volume, clapping along.
He brought his hands up to rub at his face, the action making the lights flick on again. He couldn’t move. It was taking all his energy to stop himself reaching for the bags, leaving no energy to even contemplate taking a step backwards, let alone leaving the room.
There was a split second in it. The boy from Dickens slapped the side of the pool a blink of an eye before Sherlock did, but John did not care a jot. Neither, it seemed, did Doyle, the house clapping and cheering.
He filled two tall glasses with water, two with orange juice, and fetched two doses of aspirin from the medicine cupboard. Rehydration, sugar, pain relief. The Watson family recipe for the prevention of throbbing hangovers, passed down from generation to generation.
’ but Sherlock continued before he could. “I knew she was Sarah’s roommate, that was obvious as well. So there was a reasonable likelihood that she would be trying to find us.”
Eddie was staring at him with something like disbelieving awe which made John a little uncomfortable. John addressed him. “With your permission, obviously,”
“So I tried again, a little more calmly this time, and we crunched forward on the gravel and everyone cheered and I was on such a high, Sherlock. God, it was good. I got more and more confident and in no time, I was driving in circles round the tree in the middle of the drive and feeling like the king of the universe.
“Now, boys, we didn’t win, but – ” Lestrade began, interrupted by noises of upset from the boys. Sherlock watched John for a reaction, but his friend’s expression was neutral. Lestrade shushed the house. “Let me finish. We didn’t win, Green did,
John shook his head and made to sit back down. “There’s a kitchen down the corridor, first on your right.”
“I had to put this old tabby down at work today,” Mrs Watson sighed. “And thank you for your sympathy, Sherlock – it’s never a pleasant thing to do,”
The connection was sound. The ball flew on wings unseen through the grey air, spinning towards the arms of the H, raised skyward. Not one person dared breathe, lest their exhalation disturb its flight.
“You know when you sent Nadia to check her brother’s emails, what did you think she was going to find?”
After a moment, Sherlock dimly wondered whether he should do something with his arms, which were still behind him, propping him up, but before he could work out what exactly, John pulled away.
Sherlock frowned and turned back to the game. The Boscombe players had retreated to the goal line they were defending, and St Bart’s had gathered together in a bunch, seemingly negotiating something.
He raised his eyes from where they’d fallen to the concrete and as those in front of him moved away, he saw John. John, standing with his hands in his pockets, waiting for him.
The duvet was soft against his bare calves where his trousers had rucked up during the night. The bed linen smelled of the airing cupboard where John had got it from the night before, dust and stale air.
“You obviously don’t know me very well,” Sherlock said. “I don’t care about people dying, people do that all the time. What if I refuse to play?”
After Gregson dismissed them, John caught up with Mike. “I have questions. What’s the spring ball and what happened last year?”
In answer, Sherlock opened the door and got out, rounding the back of the car and waiting for John on the pavement.
“One each,” Victor replied. He laughed at Sherlock’s expression. “Oh, come on, I haven’t been high with you in ages, it’ll be fun.”
As John and the secretary came back into the room, Sherlock returned his gaze to his work. He continued writing the essay he had been given to copy, and heard John continue writing as well.
He settled on the sofa in between his mother and his sister, phone in one hand, hot chocolate in the other, and it was almost perfect. If John closed his eyes, he could imagine his father sitting in the arm chair just over there, feet stretched out and sock-clad, smiling at the TV.
John nodded and followed, despite wanting to stay standing at the top of that hill until the snow thawed and the seasons changed and the trees grew and died once more. He wanted to see how each season painted the view, how the sun set and rose amongst those hills.
“So Sherlock Holmes actually has an interest in something?’ John said, mock-surprised. He knew it would annoy Sherlock, but he didn’t really care. “Goodness gracious, I didn’t think those words would ever escape my mouth,”
John wasn’t really in the mood for this. He had been travelling all afternoon and he was tired and hungry.
“Nah, Sarah’s pretty chilled, you wait and see,” John went back to fidgeting with his appearance in the mirror. Simple as that.
He stood up and stretched, and Sherlock took that as permission for him to do the same. He grabbed his half-full cup of water from his desk.
“Not all the time, no,” conceded Mike. “Sometimes he’s nice enough, and can be decent company – occasionally, if you catch him in the right mood, he can even be funny. But most of the time, he a sarcastic, rude, manipulative arsehole. You can’t deny it.”
It was something Sherlock had never done before – willingly reveal details of his own life to somebody without being forced. Other people seemed to do it incessantly, which was something that annoyed Sherlock greatly. Why the constant need to blurt out the first half-formed thing that drifted idly into their vacant skulls? But this boy, this John Watson, hadn’t done so as yet. Beside the details Sherlock had deduced from him, he was private, insular almost. This, Sherlock supposed, was understandable, seeing as John’s home life didn’t seem to have been particularly pleasant recently.
“No, we should – I need to check with Molly,” Sherlock said, beginning to walk towards the science block. John followed. “I could be…”
Time passed in its regular fashion for – as far as Sherlock could tell – he didn’t think he’d gone away but he could never be sure – around fifteen minutes before John spoke.
John watched the boy out of the corner of his eye as he entered him on the database. He had both hands resting on the desktop, which was about chest height for him. The sleeves of his blazer, even with his hands raised, brushed the first knuckles of his thumbs. He turned his head and suddenly John thought he’d seen him before, but couldn’t put his finger on where. It was like he was a ghost, a face glimpsed in a crowd while looking for someone else, a broken chord of a song heard through a wall.
John nodded, thinking. “I don’t know,” he began haltingly, worrying what he was about to say would sound moronic. “It’s almost like we were tipped off, or something,” Sherlock was looking at him, but John couldn’t read anything in his expression. Emboldened by the fact that Sherlock hadn’t dismissed him, he continued cautiously. “We never found Mrs Turner’s necklace, so maybe someone stole it to draw our attention to the family. And someone obviously sent us those earrings to draw us to Nadia… I wonder who it is. They should get some credit for helping, at least…” he trailed off, so deep in thought that he didn’t realise Sherlock had stopped walking until he heard a small “Oh,” from behind him.
They were silent for a while, Sherlock sorting his socks out in the bottom of the trunk, John leaving neatly folded shirts beside him on the floor.
. Stamford's predicament was obvious. That haircut of his is new, but not done at a barber's. The jaggedness of the cut above his ears and at the nape of his neck made it painfully obvious. I thought even an idiot like you would have been able to see it.”
“Hello, Sherlock, dear – oh, are you alright, love? You look a bit peaky. What’s all that muck on your face? And who’s this handsome young chap? It’s lovely to meet you, I’m Mrs Hudson, Sherlock’s – ”
“I… I see,” Lestrade said. “Anyway, time to get ready – fifteen minutes ‘til we meet downstairs, boys, yes?”
Directly ahead of him was a closed door, behind which was Mrs Watson’s bedroom, Sherlock assumed. The sister’s room was immediately to his right, the door open a crack affording a view of a cluttered floor and a lava lamp bubbling gently on a desk. John’s room lay to the right of Harry’s, the door open wide.
“Oh,” John said. “Well, the underside of your chin and your neck and a bit of your chest. I mean, if that’s okay? Because if you’re not okay with it I don’t have to – ”
John began the story and felt himself smiling at the memory of a time more simple. Before long, John heard a quiet snuffle from Sherlock’s bed. He trailed off, not bothering to finish his sentence, and listened to Sherlock’s breathing. How strange that in a matter of days, they’d be back to sleeping in silent rooms with only their own breaths for company. How strange that John felt sleeping alone to be the exception to the norm, now. That he missed Sherlock’s quiet company when they slept apart.
“Oh, Christ,” Bradstreet repeated. “That’s my wife and kids – I’ll have to go and…” he said, getting up and smoothing a hand through his hair. “I’ll just…” he said, walking into a corridor as if he’d forgotten where it went.
He caught up with Sherlock and fell into step beside him, their breathing falling into a shared rhythm beat out by the pounding of their feet on the concrete.
“The marks are there on all of the animals,” he was saying. “Small punctures just at the base of the neck. The injection was done clumsily enough to leave a mark - who-ever it was was certainly inexperienced. The dried blood around the marks means they were made before their deaths.”
Sherlock got dressed into his pyjamas and half-heartedly did the bare minimum of his anthropology homework before asking again.
He straightened his legs, his backside rising, ducking his head. John gripped the edge of the railing.
“What does my presence matter?” Sherlock said, now having given up with his spoon and dipping his finger into the milk.
He would have been perfectly content to stand in the corridor and be a passive spectator the entire night, but that would have been too perfect.
John and Mike continued on their descent, the laptop’s view safely back on their faces, John explaining about the plan for Doyle’s performance in the coming competition. At the bottom of the stairs John said goodbye to Mike, who left through an old and very heavy-looking door. The laptop’s microphone was picking up a few muted strains of music which got louder as John crossed the foyer.
John had tried to find Sherlock to apologise, but it was as if the boy had been wiped from the face of the earth. There was no guarantee he was even in Doyle, and John checked his watch as the seconds ticked down to ten and the subsequent locking of the doors. Ten came and went and still no Sherlock.
Mrs Hudson was saying something to Sherlock about helping her with passing out the canapés, and John marvelled at the way he allowed her to order him around, at the look in his eyes, as if he felt deeply for her, and John supposed he would. From what he understood, Mrs Hudson had lived in this house since Sherlock’s mother had inherited it, and so Sherlock must have grown up with Mrs Hudson as an honorary grandmother. He looked like a little boy in her presence, despite his being almost a foot taller than her.
“Yeah, no shit!” Vlad exclaimed. “Details, please – did he go to your old school or what? Did you fuck him?”
John watched Sherlock through the metal bars of his bed until he could no longer keep his eyes open.
“Sorry. I’ll shut up now.” He turned away, shifting a little, shoulder beginning to protest a little at keeping his hands behind him for so long.
John followed Sherlock through a short corridor and into what John assumed to be the library. He took a moment to take in the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, the armchairs and sofas, the rugs and lamps, before turning his attention to the people.
“And what question would that be?” Sherlock called over his shoulder as he turned the corner and went through the door.
Sherlock scrutinised her for a moment, before humming and turning back to the scuff mark. He pulled out a small magnifying glass from his pocket – on the first go this time – and started investigating. John glanced at the earrings clasped in Nadia’s hand, then did a double take – the gems in the earrings matched the one in Nadia’s ring, and the band was made of the same delicate metal, glinting in the sunlight.
Lestrade addressed the house with his usual, good-natured exasperation, perhaps looking a bit more hallowed than usual, while John struggled to keep his eyes open. Morning registration was hard enough at such an ungodly hour as it was, but when your roommate had refused to let you turn the lights off until he was done burning something in the middle of the floor, the acrid smell of which was still in your hair despite two vigorous washes already that day, and especially when it was Monday, it was hell.
John imitated him, voice high and reedy – “Why should I? I’m Sherlock Holmes and I wear proper shirts all the time and I’m far too important to get my head out of my own arse and do something fun for once in my superior-in-every-way life.”
John neither confirmed nor denied it, but Sherlock knew he was right, and tried not to over-analyse the lack of his usual post-deduction satisfaction.
Except his brain was mostly refusing to co-operate, so his rationalisation of the way his stomach flipped every time he remembered dancing with John was –
“Oh, for-” he began, doubling back and taking the canvas from John. “Put as many things as you can in your pockets,” he advised, unfurling the umbrella. John did as he said. “We have two minutes. Ready?”
Then John began talking about his late-night conversations with the boy, and Sherlock felt a strange twinge of something in his chest, something like jealousy for something that could never have been, and hatred for someone he didn’t know.
“What do you think of Dave?” John asked him, but there was no smile there – he wasn’t asking for an opinion.
“And he keeps switching into Beethoven’s sixth half way through,” said the boy at the drum kit, waving his sticks accusingly.
Sherlock stepped to his left; John stepped to his right. Sherlock stepped to his right; John stepped to his left. Sherlock made an exasperated noise. “It’s not important, John. Forget I said anything.”
“You know I can’t hear a word you’re saying,” John said over his shoulder. It was partly true; the acoustics of the room made conversation very difficult when seven hundred other people were trying to talk over one another. That, and the fact that he hadn’t slept very well the night before and so was finding it hard to muster up any interest for anything that didn’t involve his bed.
He got a few shrugs in reply, and, seemingly taking that as a yes, squeezed his way through the mob of boys and sat at the piano.
“Waiting for you to play me something,” John replied, leaning his head back and making himself comfortable.
As his smile fell slowly away, he was aware that as soon as they got out of bed, this moment would be lost. This moment of peace in the light of morning.
Sorry I lifted so much dialogue from the show in this chapter, I felt it had to be done, and I will avoid it (in this quantity) at all costs in the future, I promise!
“Tell Molly Hooper to meet us in the store room on the physics floor of the science block,” Sherlock said. “It’s an emergency.”
“I will bloody swear all I fucking want, you piece of shit, now sit your arse down and let me have a goddamn look at you!”
John paused, then shook himself and continued taking his shoes off. “When was the last time you ate?” he asked.
The boy looked as if he was fighting with himself, fidgeting. He opened and shut his mouth at least three times before finally forcing out, “I know we’re not… friends. Or whatever. But my friends don’t… they’re not very helpful with this kind of thing and – ”
After the ensemble had played through the song a couple of times, John slipped out of the room with the laptop. Once they were back in room twenty-one, he set the machine down on his desk again and settled in front of it.
“Sherlock, just a random question.” John asked, rummaging through his bag for his lunch, “What happened to the secret admirer?”
Hi, a little awkward but did you just like one of my pictures from last year? Were you cyber stalking me?
Sherlock swallowed his saliva as he considered his next response, shrugging to himself, he decided to just do the one thing that may just get him through this: be himself.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and screeched at Harry. The Detective was now perched in the middle of the seat, both hands raised upwards as if he was about to take flight. (The buttons on his suits were straining and both Watsons may or may not be wanting for one of them to split open) Simultaneously, John had let out a strangled noise and clenched his fist tightly around the poor throw pillow.
Sherlock had a perfectly crafted look to react to the note; he didn’t do anything. He opened the note, ignored the silly wishful leap in his heart and slipped the note in his pocket.
Based on that very famous tumblr prompt of Teenlock online stalking John and then accidentally liking a photo about 50 weeks in.
“Hiya, Sherlock! How are you?” John grinned his usual winning smile, the one that made Sherlock swoon internally every time he witnessed it.
Unfortunately, Sherlock’s foot had hooked onto John’s calf and sent the both of them tumbling to the ground. The result was both of them in a very compromising position, with the  fluffy blanket discarded by the side.
As soon as they were in the kitchen, Harry’s eyes lit up and a flood of questions escaped her lips. “He’s so hot. Are you dating? You can’t tell me you guy are not dating. Have you seen that shirt? His eyes? His cheekbones? Oh my god the cheekbones-“
John choked on his tea, snorting it up his nose. He scowled at Sherlock, slouching terribly in his chair and trying not to think of a rather disturbing image that involved a shirtless Sherlock wearing army gear. My, what a luscious sight that would be. John bit his lip in thought, it would definitely be a sight John would prize.
Mycroft was holed up in his office as usual, exhausted after an intense argument with the MI6 director. He was just about to sent a brutal letter to the Queen when Anthea knocked on the door.
“Argh, right there! There...perfect...” Mycroft babbled as he twisted his head to the side, biting his lips to prevent himself from yelling.
“I’ll...wait...” Mycroft muttered, eyes already lighting up in anticipation of what was going to happen next.
“Her and her? A romance novel? Well, I wouldn’t put it past you John, since you’re such a romantic. But aren’t you ‘not gay’?” Sherlock tried to suppress a giggle and failed miserably.
Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, Watson. You should know that I use my Instagram for fact collection. -SH
It was perhaps Mycroft’s frustration that had clouded his skills of observation. If he had looked a little closely, he would also see tiny scuff lines made by tiny fingers. He would also had noticed a tiny pair of toddler shoes that were neatly tucked into the shoe rack.
“Too much blood on my shirt, so I threw it away. The coat helped me cover up.” Sherlock mumbled as he stared at the book in John’s hand.
“What did my Brother do this time?” Mycroft hummed, tapping the other side of the desk to tell Greg to sit.
(Meanwhile, Harry’s just having the time of her life, teasing the great Sherlock Holmes into saying that he wouldn’t mind stripping. She’s not even drunk, mind you, but she bet that she  could goad Sherlock into stripping if she were drunk.)
When he zoned back in, Sherlock was staring at the empty hall, cheeks burning with a naughty shade of crimson.
“Here.” Watson’s eyes shone gleefully as he peeled the star off his forehead and pasted it onto Sherlock’s cheek, “A star!”
Dear Sherlock, I’ve decided to tell you who I am. Three guesses? I just wanted you to know. Because I like you. A lot. I have been wanting to tell you because every time we talk I can barely string a line of coherent words together. Every time you tell me how you are able to deduce people, I want to tell you that you’re more than brilliant, more than amazing. Since I’ve gotten to know you, I’ve liked you more, your personality didn’t drive me away like you said. I do want us to be something, even if you’re not sure. Because I liek everything about you Sherlock (yes, even the annoying bits). I just like you.  Love, your secret admirer.(John H. Watson)
“You could say that...” Mycroft groaned as he sat on the couch across Greg. He leaned backwards and swung his umbrella dramatically to the side, looking rather discontent.
“You are a female, your anatomy does not include a male appendage. Therefore I cannot be a ‘cockblocker’. Honestly, I taught you better than this.” Sherlock pouted, swishing his coat in a dramatic flurry before exiting the room.
“Okay, Myc, I’m going to, calm down, it’s okay.” Greg shushed Mycroft as he petted the other’s leg awkwardly, trying to get him to relax a little. It works and Mycroft manages the tiniest of nods to showcase consent.
“Do you want to smell like me too?” John snorted, reaching a hand up to massage Sherlock’s scalp gently.
Holmes jumped, like a skittish deer being yelled at. John grinned and waved back, his spare hand dropping down to the curve of Sherlock’s arse.
“You daft angel! You made me think that you didn’t want to marry me, you complete idiot!” John laughed as he tried to scold Sherlock, effectively looking like a madman.
Asher shook his head and chuckled one of those weird chuckles where the person looks like they might shit their pants. “My intentions are pure, I wouldn’t want to offend or hurt your daughter’s feelings.” He paused to exchange a sweet smile with Rosie, who beamed at him like he was the center of her universe.
Greg smiled as he surveyed Mycroft. He was lying on the couch with his legs spread wide open like an invitation to fuck him, his little pink hole clenching at the mere thought of being filled. So pretty, so vulnerable and sensitive, so goddam perfect.
Both Sherlock at John retreated to their rooms for the night. They refuse to reconcile and talk for three days until Sherlock breaks the silence by screaming for tea. According to John, such effects always come hand in hand when Harry visits his friends.
“Er...no. It wasn’t.” John whispered, relishing the hot air that came with Sherlock’s quiet breaths. The Detective smelled like toast and tea, two very welcoming scents that made John want to just lean into his shirt and breath it all in.
“I’m not...” Mycroft sighed as Greg’s lips crashed into his, arching his back towards the other in a lewd manner.
Sherlock sighed from his position under the shady tree, he honestly doesn’t know what to do about it. He hasn’t talked to Irene about it because her responses are totally flawed. She would suggest something like “Find them and snog them.”
“Hmm...I’ll wait for you at home.” Greg winked, all signs of fatigue disappearing, a terribly cheeky look overcoming his features.
John walked carefully to Sherlock’s room, balancing a food tray laden with tea, biscuits, medicine, a cold towel and some science magazines for Sherlock to indulge in. He also brought his romance novel along, seeing that he might have to watch over Sherlock for a while.
When Sherlock woke up later in the evening, he had no idea why John was blushing so much. (And also why he was sleeping ever so closely to his face)
“What do you like about me? Name twelve reasons.” Greg asked, head lying rather comfortably on Mycroft’s lap. Mycroft was stroked the inspector’s hair thoughtfully, almost lost in his thoughts.
“God, you know I love you.” Mycroft gasped, throwing his head back as Greg unbuttoned his shirt to kiss his neck.
“Aha!” Mycroft exclaimed through the earpieces, making John release a string of very inappropriate expletives. “Name, Ashlee Lee. Age, seventeen, one year older than our little Rosie. Lives at 56 Am-“
They pulled away, lips swollen and red. A trail of saliva links the both of their lips as they part. Their eyes are both unbelievably clouded with lust and longing. Sherlock is the first the break the deafening silence.
The shirt looked so tight and luxurious. It was probably tailored to Sherlock’s size. Pearly buttons held everything together, protecting the lithe and delicate skin underneath. It was all a perfect little package of beauty. John gulped as his eyes travelled downwards to Sherlock’s pants.
6. His unusually deep understanding about my woes and concerns, of which shouldn’t ever concern him but it does, anyway.
“Oi! Whatcha up to Sherly boy?” A tall boy named Charles Magnussen (affectionately called Charlie by his mates) slapped Sherlock’s back with force, causing Sherlock to drop his books.
Speaking of roommates, where was Sherlock? The man had disappeared for an hour and his morgue runs usually take about 30 minutes. (Not that John was counting)
“No! That wasn’t my intention!” Sherlock’s eyes widened in amusement as he shook his head. His voice lowered considerably as he said, “My answer is a yes.”
John leaned forward and captured Sherlock’s sweet lips in his own (which were jabbering about a man cheating on his Wife). He wanted to show Sherlock that he loved him, that he just wanted to hold him and hug him and accept him, deductions and all.
John smiled and used his fingers to raise Sherlock’s chin upwards to face him. Leaning forward, he marvelled the way Sherlock’s breath quickened when he was about to be kissed. His lips crashed into Sherlock’s, the Cupid bow mouth moving frantically against his own, mouthing his name in a way that sounded like heaven.
Eyeing John’s hand warily, Sherlock shook his head. He was not a child and refused to be treated as such. He covered his forehead with his hands to try and prevent John from taking his temperature, “I’m not si— “
They separated, eyes heavily clouded with lust. Greg smirked as he looked down at their matching hard ons before saying, “Now, don’t you want to know why the higher ups can just go fuck themselves?”
Greg twisted and stretched Mycroft’s hole mercilessly, allowing Mycroft to slowly become a melting heap of whimpers and moans. As soon as Lestrade inserted two long, nimble digits into his arse, he hooked them upwards expertly, finding Mycroft prostate.
“You could write back.” John smiled, the tips of his ears turning a slight pink. (Must be from the heat of the sun....)
“I am not...aware...” John replied, giving Rosie a pointed look. A slight frown pervaded his features as Rosie rolled her eyes at them, already about to protest.
John pushed the door open quietly, cursing under his breath as it creaked. “Sherlock?” John whispered, “I’m here.”
“Well, it’s hard to pay attention to spelling when I’m so close to you, isn’t it?” John whispered, sneaky fingers tracing teasing circles on Sherlock’s arm.
“Ding dong!” The bell rang throughout the apartment, prompting John to pull open the door with rehearsed movements. The smile on his face was so artificial that it physically pained Sherlock to look at him.
“What...happened? Do I want to know?” John grumbled as he tried to pull his attention to his book. (But his damn eyes just wanted to stare at Sherlock’s body)
The setting was almost perfect, they were situated in a cosy corner at Angelo’s, a candle burning merrily in between them. Yet, somehow, John couldn’t find any opportunity to ask the four magic words.
“Do you...think so? I don’t know. I may have an infatuation with this person but if I want to allow my feelings to grow, I want to know who it is.” Sherlock complained, feeing the weight of the newest letter burn in his pocket.
“Anyway.” John resumed. “I didn’t see the burn at first because he was sitting in such a way that I could only see right side of his face, but it looked really raw and red, so my thoughts were that he must have only just got out of hospital. The next time I went to therapy, he was there again, and we smiled again, and the week after that, and the week after that, and so on. One week – ” John really didn’t want to continue with his story, hoped Sherlock would come bursting in and drag him away, but nothing happened. He steeled himself and went on. “One week I came out kind of, um, in tears, because – well, that’s irrelevant.”
, John.” His smile faded. “Nobody seemed the least bit affected when I told them that he’d been missing for five days. Nobody deserves that lack of empathy, not even him. And seeing someone lying there like they’re dead, that’s enough to make anyone… even if you don’t like the person, they’re a real person, you know? With their own thoughts and worries and…” He faltered. “God, I sound sappy.” He laughed.
John was thrown by that, and felt heat rising to his cheeks. “I – ” he began, unsure of what he was going to say. Luckily, Sherlock chose that moment to walk up and join their conversation.
Comfortably exhausted after his second day of lessons, John was ambling back to house with Mike, since they had had maths together, when he remembered the jangling change in his trouser pocket.
John had shown no sign that he had even heard the music, and Sherlock had played for longer than he had ever remembered playing for someone else, so when he stopped, he thought John had fallen asleep. But just as Sherlock put the violin back on the desk, John mumbled something from beneath his duvet.
“You know I will always believe you,” John found himself replying, so quiet it was almost a whisper in the falling night. “Right?”
“I think… I think… you’re fine there. Just, if something doesn’t feel right, just suck it up and go to the san – don’t give me that look – because we don’t want you having internal bruising. Turn around so I can do the cuts on your head.”
By the time Vlad returned with his laptop, the room had been cleared and a couple of people had left to get more duvets and cushions. The laptop was placed precariously upon a pile of pillows and Sherlock and John settled on their stomachs in front of it, others behind them, some sitting with their backs against the door, some on the bunk beds looking down.
“John,” Sherlock said, and John dragged his eyes away from the boys. Sherlock’s arms were cradling several bottles of mouthwash. “Found it. It was three for two. Let’s go.”
As the final note faded out, the applause was almost instantaneous. In the dark, John could see Sherlock stand up and move to join the rest of the house as they moved forward to take their bows. John grabbed him and pulled him into the line beside him just before the lights came up again and the applause renewed its strength, and he heard some cheers in there as well – one sounded suspiciously like Irene Adler, and John smiled. He and Sherlock were shoulder to shoulder as they bowed, once, twice, three times, then waited as the rest of the musicians took their bows.
“Great joke,” John said sarcastically, and Sherlock huffed again, throwing himself back onto the bed. He curled on his side, watching John bustle about in the waiting area. He was rearranging a pin board full of posters, and Sherlock could feel himself falling asleep.
His brother’s old mantra, his only piece of advice when Sherlock had left home for Bart’s at thirteen, with too much hair and not enough people to care about.
His only memories of Sherlock from before the Rising had been glimpses of a tall figure stalking through the corridors with a girl who had the aura of an empress. Both of them had looked as if they were sculpted out of marble.
A tangle of limbs underwater, and John opened his eyes to see Sherlock looking back at him. John raised his middle finger as the bubbles around them cleared, and Sherlock raised his own in return. John felt himself grin as he let himself float to the surface.
John shook his head – her question was falling on deaf ears. “It’s a long and very weird story,” he explained. “But we really did not steal them, I promise.”
John cleared his throat and followed Sherlock’s cue to leave the conversation be for now. “She would have needed access to your medical records, and not just your school ones. Do you think she hacked into some database?”
“No, no, dear, not at all,” Mrs Hudson dismissed. “I just wanted to come and say goodnight to you both.”
Sherlock was no longer on top of the fridge. He was lying on his back on his bed, fully dressed. John immediately dampened down the spark of hope that flared at the sight of his friend looking relatively normal, because if there was one thing he’d learned in Sherlock’s company, nothing was ever as it first appeared.
“Your family was just telling me about your talent on the rugby pitch,” Mycroft began, and John made as quick work of the ensuing small talk as possible, glancing at Sherlock every now and again.
John had never spoken to her, had only seen her once or twice. And yet he knew he could draw her face from memory if he wanted to.
He wasn’t going to wake up Sherlock, that was a given. And he himself wasn’t going to go to lessons – no way in hell.
John was sitting next to the girl on one of the pews, and she was laughing at something he’d said, a hand resting lightly on his arm, as if her laughter was so earth-shattering she had to steady herself. She was pretty, hair done up in a high bun, tall. Taller than John, but then again, all the girls John had shown in interest in were.
Breathe. In, and out. In, and out. He wasn’t going to panic. He was going to stand up straighter, he was going to go to Sherlock’s bed, drag down his duvet, and wrap it around his friend. He wasn’t going to worry when Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. He was going to go into the kitchen, treading quietly on the squeaky floorboards. He was not going to fall down the stairs. He was going to grip onto the banister until his knuckles turned white, but he was not going to trip.
As Harry passed the halfway mark of his final length, Sherlock ducked his head and John’s heart skipped a beat. Five metres to go, and Karim slapped him on his back. Sherlock straightened his legs, and John could see the tension in every muscle in his back.
John stood up as the crowd shouted back to Beyoncé, and knew he was dancing in ways he’d probably regret if he was sober, but he wasn’t, so he continued to thrust his hips and gyrate, much to Sherlock’s shocked horror.
Sherlock nodded once. “Do it here, don’t go back to Frank, save time. Take a picture of anything suspicious with your phone - not a screenshot, those can be faked…” he took off down the stairs, John hastily finishing and sending the text and hurrying after him. “Meet us in the storage room when you’re done!” he called up to Nadia, who nodded and disappeared through another door.
John almost smirked at Sherlock’s fumbling insistence. He wanted to hug him. He did not. He had to try to get this conversation back on track. “Thank you,” he said. “But still. I can’t accept one of your offers.”
When John flipped off the last remaining light, his customary “Night, Sherlock,” was greeted with silence, except for a quiet, sleepy snuffle, and John smiled to himself.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows before getting up and going to his bookshelf. He heard John follow him.
Sherlock nodded after a moment. “Local lads. Dean Webb and Thomas Fitzjames. Cousins, apparently. Fourteen years old. The police have been closing in on this drug ring for a while now. They suspected that the main guy wasn’t dealing himself, he was using family members, but they never suspected he was blackmailing his nephews into it.”
It wasn’t fair - he was only trying to help! All the adults thought he was useless because he was ‘only five’, but in fact he was nearly six and a lot cleverer than most of them anyway. But when mummy looked at him like that, his will to be mean went away, so he went back to bed. But he did make sure to pout and stomp so that she knew he wasn’t happy about it.
He didn’t move until the faint and indistinct shouts of Moran to come to attention and the stamping started, signalling the end of John and Lottie’s conversation.
“I don’t know why I even have to be there,” Sherlock complained from off screen. “I know it, they know I do. I don’t see what the logic is in practising when I
Sherlock turned around. John looked at him steadily. Sherlock had said something to that effect only once before, and John had looked the term up online afterwards. He’d found that it hadn’t been used by psychiatrists in decades.
, John thought suddenly, surprising himself. What he said was, “There’s a lot I don’t know about me yet, too.”
Aside from the practical, Sherlock had also bought himself a new journal. He had almost forgotten about his journals, being so wrapped up in re-assimilating as he had been. This new one had thick pages and a maroon cover, and Sherlock held it in his hands, feeling its weight.
“Just thought it might be your kind of thing,” Mike said, stepping inside. “See – here,” he pointed at a poster, the same one that John had noticed before he had strode out into the night om his pyjamas to find Sherlock.
“I have to say, I felt so bad last year when it was decided that you, a poor, innocent new kid, would be rooming with him, but to be honest, everyone, myself included, was just so relieved to not have to share a dorm with him anymore.” Mike confessed.
He locked his phone again and sat back in his chair, eavesdropping a little on the conversations that had broken out around him. They seemed only to have one subject.
“Oh, okay, that’s easy, no precision involved,” Sherlock said dismissively. “Although Mycroft did make me stop doing it a few years ago, so I may be a little out of practise.”
Sherlock looked at John. He was sitting quietly, watching the people around him. Someone on the other side of the aisle called his name, and John’s face instantly split into a smile, genuine as ever, and Sherlock watched as he chatted away merrily. John sometimes talked to him like that. Which was odd because Sherlock didn’t give him much of a response when he talked about menial things. John knew that he would get that response, but he chatted to him anyway. Odd.
John tried not to let his exasperation filter into his tone of voice – they’d talked about this the night before: Sherlock was still restless about the fact that they still hadn’t caught the murderer. “There’s nothing more you can do – it’s with the police now and the pets have been buried. I still don’t see how you can find anything more out about it.”
It was just gone two in the morning when the boys crawled into their beds. John had panicked for a moment about which side of the bed he should take, but the problem was solved when Sherlock, without a moment of hesitation, slid under the covers on the left hand side.
“Breathe, John, come on,” Sherlock urged. “Breathe, now –“ he exaggerated his own breathing to illustrate. “- In through the nose, come on, out through the mouth, come on, now, John,”
“Ah,” said Molly, hugging her diary to her. “Okay. Well - if he changes his mind, could you tell him… actually, never mind,” she said, looking down and making to leave. John swore he saw her flush slightly pink.
“Yes,” Anderson insisted. When John only looked at him, Anderson said, “I know guys miss things, and I’ve missed things before, but this time I’m certain.”
Finally, John managed to get himself under control, and Sherlock felt as if he were fizzing, and it was probably a combination of the cold and the sugar.
“Me and Harry come every Christmas,” John explained. “Hey, there you go! You’ve got the theory of it, anyway,”
Sherlock had found them both coats and more beer, and within three minutes they were sneaking out the back door of Mrs Hudson’s house.
John was swept away in the atmosphere, yelling at the top of his lungs with the rest of the boys, screaming the names of those swimming. For such a short race, it felt like it went on forever. Doyle came fourth.
John logged his entry time and the reason for his visit and told him to wait on one of the pews. He watched him hobble over, one leg stiff, the sound his crutch made on the floor making John’s left leg ache. He sat as if someone was pushing on his shoulders, folded in on himself, hands clasped in his lap. John found himself wanting to sit down next to him and rub his back, like one would stroke a frightened pet.
Once the door had finally swung shut, Sherlock whipped around to John. “We have to find Carl’s shoes.”
John sighed in frustration. “I didn’t mean it like that. You just get a bit… logical sometimes, especially in situations like that.”
John whirled around to the source of the noise - a teacher striding towards them through the darkness. Or, towards John alone, because Sherlock had taken off running, disappearing into the night.
The rest of that day, John felt listless and restless, feeling as if he were a loose end waiting to be tied up. He watched an indeterminate amount of Christmas movies playing on the TV, made an indeterminate amount of cups of tea. Sherlock texted him updates of an experiment he was doing, which just about kept John’s brain from rotting. He went on a walk, almost got lost in a labyrinth of back-alleys. He cooked dinner; ate it. Time seemed to be moving slower than usual, each second dripping like treacle off a spoon. He went to bed at around eight thirty, knowing that time would pass quicker when he was asleep.
"Not sure he misses you, though," John replied, laughing when Sherlock shot him an exasperated look.
“Just one tiny ‘please’,” John coaxed. Sherlock opened his mouth, but quickly shut it again. “Come on, say it with me,”
“Everyone on the porch kept shouting ‘Go on the lane! Go on the lane!’ and dad asked me if I wanted to and I shouted ‘HELL FUCKING YEAH’ because I was really fucking excited and mum yelled at me from the porch because she heard. Dad laughed and said ‘All right then, John, when you’re ready, just ease out and the road is yours.’
Sherlock was sitting on the countertop, watching John as he spoke with his sister, phone pressed between his ear and his shoulder, hands occupied with washing his knife under the tap. They’d finished chopping all the vegetables for the stir fry and now John was trying to communicate with his far-flung family, trying to call them home.
Sherlock hadn’t moved, but had finally opened his eyes, and as soon as the book was in reaching distance, he snatched it and opened the front cover. His eyes lingered for a moment before he slammed it shut again.
At the end of the song, John looked over at his friend, and there were the beginnings of a smile in his expression. While Dickens took their seats and Frank got up and disappeared backstage, John said, “That was better than I could ever have imagined.”
“He hasn’t composed in such a long time. He used to a lot when he was younger, but he stopped when he went away to school.” She smiled at him. “It’s good he’s back to it.”
He opened his eyes. A few inches in front of him, an arm dangled limply from the bed. Sherlock’s skin was alabaster-pale in the weak morning light. John stretched where he lay, and pushed the duvet off himself. After a pause, he stood up, looking down at the boy in his bed.
“Fuzzy, yes, I know,” John finished. “But you’re going to get drunk at some point in your life, right? And I always think it’s best to do new things for the first time with people you trust.” John raised an eyebrow. “You trust me, don’t you?”
Sarah curled her legs up as they talked, knees now almost resting on his thigh. Her smile was enchanting, her laughter mesmerising. Her hair framed her face perfectly, and John thought he might kiss her.
“Then who the fuck is it?” John yelled, his voice bouncing around the quadrangle. He felt Sarah’s hand come to his arm: a warning.
He was so busy trying to tidy up in there that he didn’t realise that he’d walked out of the bathroom with only a towel wrapped around his midriff. The knock at the living room door that made him look up was the feeling of eyes on his stomach.
“So am I,” Richie said. “My uncle is a new teacher. We moved up here from London at the beginning of summer.”
John walked slowly in the vague direction of the goal Doyle was aiming for. He had mud splattered up the backs of his legs, smeared down his front, smudged across his skin. Brown now joined the stripes of blue and maroon on his cheeks. There was a bruise blossoming on his left thigh where someone had fallen onto him, elbow making contact with skin, and Sherlock had flinched. His hair was sticking up every which way, messy from the mud and rain and sweat and his hands raking through it every so often, to get it off his forehead, or, as now, in despair or frustration or suspense.
The weekend came and went uneventfully. On Saturday, John played his first match of the football season. They won easily, and John searched the sidelines for a long, black greatcoat, but to no avail. On Sunday, John overslept, Sherlock absent when he woke. He found him sitting on the bench beside Doyle’s front door when he and a few others left for church.
Sherlock was walking across a great field. The sea of grass stretched as far as he could see, empty as a promise, and he was barefoot, the short blades tickling the soles of his feet as he went.
“It very much bloody is,” John said, grabbing him by the shoulders. “Do you have a younger sibling you’ve never told me about?” Sherlock stared daggers at John. “We’re skipping bio,” John decided. “Come on.”
The next thing he knew, Sherlock was climbing back into the room, hair sopping wet and smelling of chlorine.
Mrs Watson was standing in the kitchen in deep thought when John entered. She was still in her pyjamas, wrapped in a bathrobe and clutching a cup of coffee.
John was about to question what he meant when the door banged open to reveal Lestrade’s haggard face. “Sherlock bloody Holmes. You can’t let me have one easy day, can you?”
“You don’t need me to tell you that it’s impolite to…” the man began, but Sherlock barely heard the rest of it. John had tugged on his shoulder to make him crouch a little, and had shoved his head next to Sherlock’s own in order to hear what Mycroft was saying. The shell of John’s ear was cold against Sherlock’s hand where it held his phone, and he could feel John’s breath on his wrist. It was as if everything else had shut down except for the sensory neurons beneath his skin, alight with John John John –
“I can’t come down,” Sherlock said. John’s heart seized in his chest. “I’m just going to have to do it like this.”
“You should have seen him, John. He was lying there on the roof as if he’d been shot. He looked like it too, minus a wound, like all the blood had been drained from his body. He was barefoot and was only wearing his school trousers and shirt. I yelled his name, but he didn’t react. That was the first time in my life that I had ever felt panic. True panic. My mind went into overdrive and shutdown all at once but my body somehow knew what to do. I put my fingers to his neck and I think I started crying when I felt a pulse. It was so faint, and so sporadic, but it was there. I think I must have called Molly and told her to get Lestrade and phone an ambulance. I don’t remember what happened after that.”
“Oh, that’s alright then,” John said sarcastically. “But yeah, I’ll play. Do you think we stand a good chance?”
“J– oh my god, John,” she said upon seeing him. “It’s gone eleven and you’re still fully dressed, what are you doing? I can hear you laughing from my room,”
“Eddie ambushed me as I was coming up the stairs. I said I refused. He said that that was not going to happen. I told him that he might want to invest in a better nail varnish remover. His ears went quite red. I walked away. And here we are.”
“Yeah. I had just found out I had got into Bart’s, actually. I remember telling him.” John sighed. “Anyway, he invited me to this house his family had in the Essex countryside for a weekend. It was gorgeous, this tiny cottage and no other people for miles. Both his parents came and we had a lovely time. Barbeques, late mornings, walks in the fields.”
The referee walked onto the pitch and raised his hand, looking at his watch, and then – three long, high notes. The game was over.
“One thirty will do,” John said. “I’m afraid our shitty microwave isn’t accurate enough for your standards.”
Sherlock frowned, but didn’t have any more time to think about it as something rippled through the crowd, and then a cheer started up as the teams processed back onto the pitch.
“Oh, don’t be alarmed, John. There’ll be no need for that. I’m not going to kidnap you, although it is well within my power to do so.” The man had a voice like silk, expensive silk, and suits and fountain pens and debit cards and hired assassins. “No, I just want a chat. Take a seat.” He ambled over to John, twirling his umbrella.
He scrubbed his hands over his face, the cool water icy against his hot skin. He exhaled a shaky breath. This was very, very bad indeed. Sherlock was his best friend and losing him would break John. But despite the guilt, despite the questions and the regret and the shame, that thrill felt - well, it felt
Sherlock was watching Angelo. He was no different on the rugby pitch to off it: big, hulking, not particularly quick-witted, or quick full stop. He was a defender, and used his size to his advantage, and for the first few minutes, Sherlock thought that Doyle were going to have a hard time of scoring anything in the short match.
“Oh, sorry!” John exclaimed, bending down to rub Sherlock’s foot, hearing his friend laugh. He got up again, and it took conscious effort not to fall over. “My fave sexy Beyoncé song, though, is even better than this. Give me one second.”
John was standing in the foyer of the house, looking at the crowd of boys in dungarees. He could feel the prickling of the adrenaline in the air on his skin. Someone was playing some sort of dance track on their phone, and Lestrade was standing on the stairs, trying to count the moving heads. John knew he would come up one short.
John was free. The lane was stretching out ahead of him, the headlights only capturing a little of the darkness ahead, leaving so much unknown, so much waiting to be discovered. The stars were out, the moon clear and heavy, not yet risen to its full height, still weighing down on the horizon. He felt powerful and in control. He knew where they were going, and where they had come from, and he felt as if the future was tangible. It was cheesy, he knew that, but he couldn’t stop the grin from blossoming on his face as he turned to the passenger seat. His father gave him an encouraging smile in return, before his face changed, turning in a second. John felt as if all was in slow motion. He knew what was coming, but had no power to stop it. The blinding light, the wail of crunching metal, the pain, the heat, the screams - oh, God, the screams - sounds that were not human, that no human should ever hear, that he knew were his own, and his father’s, the one who was always so calm, so collected, so steady, screaming in the dark like an animal.
“You’re way cooler than Sherlock,” the one who had a mouth full of tiny pastries said, almost unintelligibly. “Who are you?”
He was escorted to isolation, a disused, bare-walled, windowless classroom supervised by a disgruntled secretary. He was told to stay there until the end of detention.
He’d forgotten the clanging of the rising bell, every morning at seven on the dot. He’d forgotten the monotony of lessons, the queues at meal times, the constant exhaustion.
His home looked like a faded photograph; the off-white walls, the once-bright red door, the greying weeds in tangles in the tiny front garden. John had only been away a week, but the contrast between the extravagance of Bart’s and the simplicity of his home was great and gaping and John couldn’t ignore it.
in that house. He remembered back to a plan he had come up with while high once, a plan to run away. It had been the first time he had been high with another person. Victor had told Sherlock to trust him. Had convinced him to stay in his flat. And Sherlock had talked and talked and talked.
The frigid air was like a slap to the face, and as he shut the door behind him and heard the car move away, he took a deep breath of it, feeling it chill his insides.
Sherlock got changed, struggling a little with his trousers, finding his balance to not quite be what he had hoped, and falling over whilst trying to get them off. Luckily, he’d managed to get up and change into his pyjama bottoms before John had returned. However, he had just taken his shirt off as the door opened, and he froze.
Molly opened her mouth to continue their conversation, but the door to the classroom opened and they dutifully filed in.
They lay in silence for an indeterminate amount of time, and John felt himself dropping off to sleep when Harry spoke again, quietly, sleepily.
“No,” she replied, moving past John towards a shelf on the other side of the room, “I left my diary here the other day, just popping in to get it.”
John looked up as he noticed Sherlock in the doorway. Sherlock thought he must have looked like a lost child, with a bundle of clothes in his arms and bare feet.
“Us and Tadpole,” Sally replied, then corrected herself upon seeing John’s confusion. “Percy, us and Percy. We’d just come in from a walk, and Percy was coming to get a drink, and we all walked into the common room at the same time, and there he was, just…”
“She’s ambushed me on several occasions, tried to get an interview for her precious newspaper – ” his tone suggested he thought it more of a parish council newsletter “ – but she hasn’t succeeded yet.”
Sherlock was translating a passage in Latin, something dull and dry about ancient Roman governance, when he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket.
get any seniority?” John whispered to Sherlock, also tracking Moriarty’s journey onto the stage. And then Moriarty seemed to look across the sea of heads right at John, holding his gaze for a millisecond before casting it leisurely around the room. As the hall sat back down, John tried to shake himself back into discomfort over the heat, into boredom over the headmaster’s speech, but it took some time before he could shake off the feeling of those dark eyes on him.
A heavy silence pushed itself between them, punctuated only by the smooth sound of Sherlock’s fingers against the touchpad as he scrolled.
“Could it be that you have put your trust in Sherlock Holmes, of all people?” The man mused, ignoring John’s question.
Nothing. He needed to salvage this. “We’re having bets at home, me and my mum, on when she’s going to ask her best friend out.” Another lie, but never mind. “I say by Christmas, she says New Year’s,”
“None of your business. I have to go,” Sherlock replied under his breath, making to walk away again, but Victor held fast.
He hummed a reply that he hoped would mean ‘go on’, ‘I remember’ and ‘what about them?’ all at once, conscious of the fact that he couldn’t move an inch, not even to speak, lest John’s proportions be thrown off.
John sighed. “Never mind.” He began getting to his feet and tried not to smile at how quickly Sherlock reached out to help him. “We’d better get going.”
John had no idea why his mum still insisted on performing this childish ritual, but was, in a way, intensely grateful that she did.
“Look, John,” Sherlock urged, directing John’s gaze to the teachers’ bench. “See how the ginger and the balding history teachers keep sneaking glances at each other, and the way the art teacher-”
John heard his mum’s breaths slow until they settled into an comforting rhythm that was as familiar to him as the sound of his own. He eased the mug from her hands and set it down on the coffee table as softly as he could. He guided her heavy head into a more comfortable position that wouldn’t give her neck ache when she woke up. He left the film playing so as not to disturb her while he fetched a blanket from the cupboard under the stairs. When he returned, he was a little taken aback by how small and vulnerable she looked, so much like Harry, but the world had carved weary fault lines into her skin, folding it like a scrunched-up poem, or mountains seen from above.
He left the room, and Sherlock could hear him on the floor above, talking to Harry. He returned with a DVD case in his hand, the colours too bright, the font of the title simplistic, the actors grinning with whitened teeth and bronzed skin out at the world.
“Okay, you’ve got to be quiet now,” he said, his voice low, as he turned the laptop around. Harry saw as her brother’s hand closed around the dented handle of another door, turning slowly. He pushed it open ever so slowly, gradually revealing what Harry guessed to be a common room. She saw the counter of a kitchenette first as John slipped through. A sink, a fridge, a toaster, with more appliances she was sure, but John had begun to walk towards a cluster of sofas clad in worn maroon or blue covers. A few people were sitting on them, on their phones or playing a video game on mute. The music stopped and there was some talking off screen about bars and beats that Harry didn’t understand. John walked up to a sofa and sat down on it, placing the laptop in front of but facing away from him and angling the screen so that Harry and her mother could watch the musicians.
“Yeah, I did, actually,” Nadia said, looking at them in her hands. “I guess they didn’t do the trick for you, hey?” she said, smirking a little.
Sherlock didn’t answer except for turning the fine adjustment knob of the microscope ever so slightly. “Possibly,”
Kay’s performance was slick but uneventful, no matter that Irene took centre stage, her hair down for once and moving like something fluid. However, John was glad that Molly looked like she was enjoying herself, and even more so to see Angelica up and mobile again.
John must have been able to see this on his face, because he laughed, the seriousness smoothed away.
The last word drove a spike of apprehension through Harry. The two hadn’t been on speaking terms for the last couple of days. That morning had been a little better, though; at least that morning they had acknowledged each other’s presence by wordlessly passing one another the milk at the breakfast table.
They watched as a paramedic checked over the man on the utility room floor. When John caught himself mentally taking notes, he asked quietly, “What did you do to him?”
“I don’t,” Sherlock replied. “Not really. I begged my parents to let me have lessons, then realised I hated it and after five, begged to quit and took up violin instead. I still teach myself pieces sometimes, though.”
John was right, but Sherlock had known Mrs Watson wouldn’t take him seriously. “I thought honesty was a good thing,” Sherlock said, knowing he was being obtuse.
The school buildings loomed ahead, their windows bright squares of light in the darkness. Two figures were walking across the grass ahead, facing away from him. One female, one male, joined at the hands. One of them was John. Even from this distance, Sherlock recognised his gait. The female figure was Sarah. Her gait was familiar too, but not as much.
“No, that’s okay, I have the index number. I’m really sorry, but I know you from somewhere and I just can’t place it.” John prompted.
“It was during the under-fifteens’ twenty-five metre backstroke. He just started thrashing around in the water, and by the time the lifeguard got to him, he was already unconscious. And then they started making people leave but something… something isn’t right about this, John. Something made me suspicious. So, in the confusion, I managed to get into the changing rooms. He’d been changing right next to me earlier so I knew where his stuff would have been. And that’s when I called you. Because his shoes were missing.”
“He gave it to me!” she said, jabbing her chin in God’s direction. “And he can have it back, for all I care.”
They jogged through back-alleys and residential areas, avoiding populated streets. The black bile was beginning to dribble through Sherlock’s fingers.
Doyle was just the same as usual, full of sound and movement as the boys returned. As John walked down the Lower Sixth corridor, he greeted the squeaking of the floorboards like an old friend. He could hear Glen yelling about something already, and some rapid German from behind somebody’s door.
Harry was standing in the doorway, head cocked to one side. She was wearing eyeliner. Quite a bit of it. She was watching their mum, too. John wondered how many nights Harry had spent watching over her mother since John hadn’t been there. It had only been a week, just a meagre seven days, almost to the hour, since John had walked out of that door and into another world. But a lot can happen in seven days.
, and I have updated the notes of the very first chapter to advertise it there too. Like I said, it's a work in progress - I will definitely be finished with it by the time I upload the next chapter. If there’s anything I can be doing better on that front, please let me know. I truly do care deeply about all of you, and so hope this helps in some way.
“Okay,” John said, watching Sherlock as he spun, faster and faster - and John reached out to stay him. He held him by the arms. “Sherlock, stop.”
John smiled to himself. He knew exactly where he would be. Lestrade was gearing up to announce the results of the head of house election, but John already knew what he was going to say, so he slipped out of the crowd and into Doyle.
“Sit back, you can’t breathe curled up,” Sherlock kept pushing until John rocked back into a more natural position, never mind that he kept his knees drawn up in front of his chest, never mind, it was progress.
He took his violin from the table and went downstairs, turning left into the old cottage that was attached to the main house.
“It’s not ruined, John. That was an unnecessary hyperbole.” He tossed the pad back to John and sauntered over to the fridge. John gritted his teeth at the treatment of his sketchpad, but said nothing.
Those blue eyes, bluer than usual under the stolen light, watched him so solemnly, and, yea, he felt he was swimming in still waters – but that was wrong, too. Surely.
After a moment of hesitation, John’s reply came rushing out in almost one breath. “That’s the thing – he just won’t talk to me. About anything. About whatever’s going on in that head of his. All he says is ‘
Those therapist sessions were always the same. The same supposedly innocent questions, the same unfailingly accurate inferences from his answers. Trust issues. Duty. Guilt. Introversion. Afraid. Having trouble moving on. Psychosomatic. PTSD. All jabs with sharp needles at his life, each one hitting the veins anew each time.
The look of confusion that overcame Mike’s face made John bark out a short laugh. Then he seemed to find clarity. Which wiped John’s smile from his face.
Eventually she did, saying nothing more. The line of light thinned until it was gone, and John was alone again.
Sherlock swallowed. “It was… surprisingly okay,” he said, and John laughed. Then that look in his eyes, that prelude to mischief, appeared, and he opened his mouth and took a breath.
So it was only logical he slipped through the window. Took off his coat and shoes. Walked to the bathroom.
“I am knackered,” John yawned as the police car drove away and they began to walk up to the front door of Doyle.
John pressed send; didn't bother saving the new number. His eyes were drawn again to watching the world rush past him outside the taxi window. Or was it him doing the rushing? It was difficult to tell.
John turned away from watching Lestrade fan himself with a clipboard and looked to see who was competing for Doyle.
was, because he had initially thought that John was simply staring at a statue made of snow, which was illogical on too many levels for Sherlock to count.
,” Bill mocked, voice high and nasal in his impression, circling him. “Poor ickle Johnny – go home and cry to your daddy,”
John had stormed away from the science block almost blind with fury, and was still fuming when Sherlock returned to their room at break time.
win,” John said to Claus, who glowered at him for a moment, before reluctantly shoving his hand in his pocket and thrusting the fiver back towards Glen, who took it eagerly.
“A couple of horses,” John answered for him. He wasn’t going to let Sherlock use conversation as an excuse to otherwise occupy his mouth.
. John picked this up and screwed it back on the bottle. He faced away from Sherlock with the wine in his hand. His shoulders were hard beneath his woollen jumper. After a moment of pause, he opened the door that led into the tiny garden, opened the bottle, poured the liquid onto the damp grass and dumped the empty glass vessel in the bin.
“Ex-wife,” Sherlock whispered to John in explanation, as if he’d heard his thoughts, sheathing and unsheathing a pen knife he’d acquired from god-knows-where.
“It’s true." Mike said, then lowered his voice to a whisper. "That’s one of the reasons why he was so difficult to find a roommate for." John's concern at that statement must have been visible on his face, because Mike's expression also fell. "Ah. You didn't know that. It's no biggie - "
Then it struck him; it was the first time John had seen his roommate asleep. At school, Sherlock invariably went to bed later and woke up earlier than John, and John hadn’t noticed that he had fallen asleep until the film had ended last night, at which point he’d woken him up.
His suspicions were confirmed when, as hand collided with blazer, there was an unmistakable squishing sound. Anderson’s friends erupted into guffaws again, as Anderson removed his hand to reveal a squashed tomato now stuck to the fabric, seeds and juice dripping pitifully down Sherlock’s back.
As they came to the bridge of the song, the singing dissolved into full-on shouting, and Sherlock shouted along with them, and he didn’t even think to be self-conscious with John’s hand gripping his waist – but he could barely feel it through all his layers, he wished he could feel each digit pressed into his skin – “
“And?” Sherlock retorted. “I did you a favour – it’s not irritating you anymore, is it? You kept fiddling with it yesterday and it was annoying me.”
“Oh, hello, John,” Sherlock said, not looking up as he received another message. “No, this is the man who I think may be holding Muhammad.”
The front door opened and Sherlock’s reverie was broken. He picked up the plates and shut the cupboard doors, busying himself with arranging the crockery on the table.
Victor opened his mouth to reply, but at that moment, John finally appeared at Sherlock’s side. “Sherlock, the coach is going to leave without us, let’s go.”
“Mum and Harry were very impressed with your violin,” John said, closing the laptop and handing it back to his friend, who had his face stuck to a microscope and waved a hand to communicate ‘
“Except it’s not just on Instagram, is it?” John gushed suddenly. “It’s everywhere we go, people look at us and yell shit after us and - ” John swallowed against a lump that was forming in his throat. They walked into the quadrangle in silence. It was mostly deserted, save for two figures walking across it from the other side. John recognised them instantly as the person he was looking for - Kitty Riley - and Anderson’s freckled friend, Charlie.
Sherlock had never had a friend. Victor had been right about that. And he had never expected he ever would. Sherlock had been
“The other car had mainly hit the passenger side of ours, and I couldn’t feel any pain at all at that point – epinephrine and all that – so I tried to get dad out of his seat but it took me a while to realise that I was still strapped in. So I undid my seat belt and it was a little difficult to get my legs out of the foot space because it was crushed up, but not enough to hurt me more than a great gash down my leg. I unclipped dad and got him under the arms and tried to lift him out, but he just kept screaming and that was my - ” John's voice wavered " - my
He let his arms swing heavily back to his sides, the movement catching his eye in the mirror. He met his own gaze and felt his heart sink.
John didn’t get an answer to that, but he wasn’t expecting one.  He went back to his maths, and had spent around five minutes writing numbers and then crossing them out when Sherlock piped up again.
“I can’t see anything,” he told Sherlock. “Like, at all. He’d definitely dead, but I can’t tell how.”
She was silent for a moment, and Sherlock thought she was finished, but then he felt a hand on his arm.
Sherlock left the room to shower and returned smelling of his body wash, dressed only in a towel tied about his hips. Even though John didn’t take his eyes off his computer, Sherlock still felt proud of himself. It was the first time he’d walked all the way back from the bathroom topless.
Vlad put up his hands in an appeasing gesture and John sighed. He wanted the ground to swallow him whole.
“You know, I think you’re checking me out when you look at me like that, Sherly,” Anderson said. John silently begged Sherlock not to rise to the bait.
“Okay,” John said, a sharp bolt of panic forcing him to his feet. Something was off in Sherlock’s tone. “Are you all right? Shall I come back up?”
He began to think about dates that Sherlock could come over, and things they could do, and was still lightly pondering the subject when his phone buzzed.
Mrs Watson and Harry continued walking towards the taxi, and Mycroft and Anthea did the same towards the car that was waiting for them. Sherlock and John stopped.
“I don’t want this to change anything,” John was saying, heart hammering his ribs as if it was trying to flee from what it knew was coming. From its own shattering. “Being your friend has been the best thing that has ever happened to me - ” John swallowed against the lump in his throat - “and I don’t want - ”
An hour later, homework finished, John was sitting on his bed, doodling in his sketch pad. He wasn’t fully concentrating and was humming along to the music softly crooning at him from his laptop. Night had well and truly fallen, smothering the world in an inky blackness, penetrated only by the eerie calls of owls from afar.
. The keynote speaker spoke for a little too long about his school days; the heads of school mumbled through words written for them about how much they and the rest of the upper sixth would miss the school after they left. By the time the awards section rolled around, John was glad that clapping would give Sherlock something to do with his hands other than tapping his fingers on his knee as he had been for the previous half hour.
He had stopped shaking on the train to London, the last of the cocktail of drugs finally leaving his system. He was still clawing his way out of the depths of a mood swing, and still itched beneath his flesh for another hit, just one more, and then he’d stop forever, but one more, oh,
“You’d better not be, Sherlock Holmes,” Lestrade returned, moving into his doorway. “Else I will find you.”
“I couldn’t have been more wrong. When we returned to school in September, last September this is, he looked like he was on the verge of collapse. He looked as if he hadn’t slept all summer, or eaten, for that matter. It was a miracle that he could still support the weight of his own head on his neck. We moved into a new dorm, but this time, his things didn’t migrate into it with us. His area was bare until we came to a silent agreement amongst ourselves that we would use it for storage.
“Do you still talk to him?” Mike asked softly, and from his tone of voice John knew that Mike knew everything that he hadn’t said aloud, and he wasn’t sure how to feel about that.
He closed his eyes and lay back in the water as his hand began to throb. He didn’t know where he’d come – the entire hall was screaming still.
He reached up and blindly felt about on his bed for the homework, finding his phone in the process. Bringing it to eye level, he was irritated to find it flashing with three unread texts – Mycroft, Victor Trevor and Sebastian Wilkes. Smarmy morons, the lot of them. Mycroft nagging about something trivial, Victor making lewd suggestions, Sebastian begging to know the answers to the Latin. All perfectly ignorable.
Sherlock was awake when John returned to their room. He turned to him when John entered, and John could have sworn his eyes flicked down to his bare torso for a split second before he declared,
“That has to be rectified this instant,” Sherlock said, lifting a hand to point towards the heavens. “Orion. The easiest one to spot, typically.”
Kitty waved her hand in front of her. “No, no, I don’t want to hear it. Of course you’re good enough. And Dr Day likes you. Says you’ve written some really interesting pieces. I tend to agree with him,” she said casually, inspecting her nails. “You know the editor has a say in who takes over from them?”
“Okay, we’ll leave you to it,” John said hastily as Sherlock began to walk off. “Good luck, I guess,” he said to God. He heard Angelo and Eliza’s voices pick up again as John caught up with Sherlock.
Over the course of the morning, a couple of other kids were sent out of their lessons and joined Sherlock in isolation. They were all PDS.
The Doyle boys turned all of their eyes on John and Sherlock when they entered the garden, but Mike bounded over to them, slinging an arm around John, and John watched the boys’ eyes slide away.
The talking continued for a few moments, before the boy at the piano counted down from four and Sherlock tucked his violin under his chin and began to play.
“Now, I know this dog didn’t belong to any of the people in this room, but he - and he’s a he, Sherlock, not an it - belonged to the family who live through that door,”
Sherlock laughed, and John felt his heart lift. Sherlock’s laugh was beautiful, he thought – rare, but full of teeth and so low and rumbling, and the way it made his eyes wrinkle –
John closed his eyes as his mother began walking heavily down the corridor. She walked straight past the door of the lounge, not even glancing inside.
A couple of hours later, Sherlock was playing around with a few chords on his violin when John returned from Army.
John watched Sherlock reply, watched the way his delicate fingers held the pen, tried not to think about how they’d feel laced with his.
“Well, there’s room for improvement,” Sherlock teased, and John pretended to be offended, putting a hand over his heart, before rolling his eyes.
“Sherlock, the whole reason you’re here is so that you eat,” John reminded him after a couple of mouthfuls.
John was standing with Sherlock by the piano in the drawing room in a companionable silence. Sherlock had been deducing a little, as the increasing alcohol content of the guests made more and more things visible to his sharp eyes. But now they had reached a natural lull, and were simply gazing out into the room.
The two crept down stairs and into the laundry room. They foraged in the lost-and-found bin until John came across a pair of floral swimming shorts that bore the name label of a boy who had been in the Upper Sixth when Sherlock had been a Year Nine.
John had to close his eyes and count to ten before responding. “I have not been in school since midday, Sherlock.”
“When I’m not at school, Mrs Hudson, primarily. She was a good friend of my mother’s and has been our housekeeper for as long as I can remember. My brother pays for my school fees and everything else, so one could say he looks after me too, but from afar.”
A low chuckling came from behind Charlie’s hands, raised to shield his face. “My goodness, John,” he was saying. “I’ve really been bothering you, haven’t I?”
“I’m in the rugby team. The first team, so that’s pretty good… I’m also in the Combined Cadet Force, which is great… Erm, that’s pretty much it. Jesus, it sounds like nothing's been happening, but I've been so busy you wouldn't even believe, but I can't think of anything interesting to say.”
He was thinking about Sherlock. How many layers of him there were. Surface: smooth and cold, metallic. Logic and reasoning. But then John had seen him play his violin, and all of that had dissolved. But even now, John was still learning more and more about his best friend with each passing day.
The sounds of the carriage were muffled. The two women opposite him were talking about one of their ex-husbands. The man sitting next to him was reading a cheap crime thriller. At one of the stops, the doors opened and a large group of men in their early twenties piled on, loud and raucous. John kept his eyes on the little map on the ceiling, mentally following the train’s progress through stops he’d barely heard of before as it went further and further into the outskirts of the city, eventually leaving it completely.
The second night, they had ended up falling asleep on the sofa. John had dropped off first, while they had been watching Jeremy Kyle. His feet had been pressing into Sherlock’s thigh. When the program had finished, Sherlock had been unsure of what to do. Wake John? Go upstairs alone? But in the end, he had simply slotted himself around John’s legs and had rested his head on the other arm of the sofa. They had woken the next morning in a tangle of legs and feet, and had laughed about it.
“Ridiculous,” Sherlock finished quietly. “Unfortunately, I think our killer has a bit of a penchant for ridiculous things.”
John felt himself grinning as he looked up at his friend’s face – it was so good to see those green eyes again. “Hello,”
The soft, strong sound of Sherlock’s violin made John smile to himself. He abandoned all pretence of revising and drew one knee up to his chest, resting his chin on it and casting his glance over to where Sherlock was playing in front of the window. The sun had only just set, silhouetting Sherlock against the silken light pushing past the branches of the old oak and in through their window.
“So you saw the circle, then?” Muhammad said with a small smile. “I hoped someone would. It was a small hope, but still.”
“I’m fine, John, get off,” Eric said, trying to shake the hand off, but in doing so nearly walked into a wall.
When John entered room twenty-one, Sherlock was sitting cross-legged atop his bunk, eyes closed, hands pressed together against his chin. If John didn’t know better, he would have said that he was praying.
“Excuse me, I wasn’t finished,” Sally said, and John’s respect for her surged a little. She had made Sherlock look sheepish. “So that just leaves old-fashioned straight-up intentional murder. But why would someone want to murder a dog, a cat, and a Guinea pig all at the same time?”
“No, you’re not, it’s your go now,” Mike beamed at him, holding out the remote. “Winner stays on, so you’re against Charlie.”
John sat up a little straighter, and saw Sherlock’s hands twisting in his lap out of the corner of his eye.
John heard his phone smash as he dropped it. He pulled the door open so hard he felt a stab of pain in the old injury in his shoulder. The ancient floorboards squeaked under his feet as he ran. There were a couple of people on the stairs. He pushed past them. The quickest way to the road on which the oak tree stood was through his house master's garden. He scrambled through Lestrade’s kitchen, out through his back door, felt heads turn to him as he tore through the crowd, felt the rough wood of Lestrade’s gate give him a splinter as he wrenched it open. He turned.
When they finally let him out of the hospital bed, Sherlock ran on his short legs into the corridor. Mycroft stood at the end of it - not smiling, but something close to it. He bent down and unclipped the lead and in a scratching of claws on the polished floor the dog was bounding towards him –
At eight thirty, the whole house joined the rest of the school in the main hall. It was a big, draughty building, with a stage at one end. Assembly was deathly boring. The head master spoke in a droning voice that couldn’t have been more lacking in interest if he tried and John was glad to see the back of the entire affair. Leaving the hall, John quickly caught up with his roommate.
The bed was just as comfortable as it had looked, and the duvet was light and thick, making John feel as if he were lying in a cloud, a thought which he articulated to Sherlock, earning him a low laugh.
A memory flared briefly: the first time he had kissed Victor. They had taken the same pill, and Sherlock had tasted the same chemical tang on Victor’s tongue as he had tasted on his own.
“You should have thought of this earlier,” Sherlock grumbled. John had been struck by an idea on the walk back to Doyle from the san and had dragged Sherlock into the art block with him while he found some charcoal. Once had had got back to their room, he had put his headphones in and not spoken for forty minutes as he went over certain areas of his piece for the house art competition, which he was still not allowing Sherlock to see. And now he needed to set it, and for that he needed to go back to the art block for setting spray.
John fell back onto his pillow with a groan. “Take a day off, Sherlock,” he saw Sherlock open his mouth to argue, but interrupted. “I know you
“Not sure,” Sherlock replied, turning around to face John, who had his hands in his pockets and was leaning against the doorjamb.
“But you can still look forward to seeing someone in a swim suit,” Mike joked, and John laughed and didn’t reply. The conversation was beginning to annoy him.
“Sorry, sir, we were – ” John began, but his excuse was drowned under an eruption of wolf-whistles and laughter from the class. John took a breath and scanned the room for Mike. He was sitting next to Molly, who was trying to hide her smile and abruptly looked down when she caught John’s eye. Mike simply shrugged, and John could hear exactly what he would be saying –
They had certainly improved since the first rehearsal John had eavesdropped on – still not perfect, a few slipped notes here and there, the timing a little off in places, but as the song went on, John could see Sherlock becoming visibly more comfortable. Someone started up some clapping at one point, bringing a smile to Eddie’s nervous features. He even thought he saw the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitch when Mike whooped after he pulled off a fast, vigorous section with a trademark flourish of his bow.
“So, without further ado, the winner of this year’s house music competition is…” The man paused for effect, and John saw Lestrade rub his hand over his mouth.
But then a flash of maroon and blue streaked up the wing, within metres of Sherlock, and the boy had the ball held in front of him, and there was a wall of defenders in front of him and it seemed he was on a kamikaze mission, heading straight for them – but at the very last second he passed. If the defenders had been quicker, they could have caught it, but they weren’t, and they didn’t, and the ball was gone, carried by someone else up the pitch. But Sherlock’s attention was still on the boy who’d made the run, who had slowed to a halt in front of the dumbstruck Dickens players, who were glaring at him. But the boy gave them a radiant, triumphant smile, and Sherlock realised – it was John.
He could feel an impending storm hovering at the edge of his thoughts, and knew that if it broke shore, it would wreak havoc. His mind palace wasn’t built to withstand such things. The walls were thin, the mortar weak.
When they burst into the common room - how different it looked now to when John had found Mike and Ollie in it just hours previously - they came across a middle-aged, dough-faced, balding man sitting in one of the softer sofas, looking as if he was going to sink down the back of it any second. Three other boys were seated on the sofa opposite, looking smug at John and the others' late arrival. Their expressions made John's stomach sink in anticipation.
For the most part, John was quiet. Breathing steadily, sipping from his mug every now and then. He shifted, and Sherlock could feel the heat from his feet against his own. Not touching, but close.
. John couldn’t tell if Sherlock had understood, but he gave his arm a squeeze as punctuation and dropped it, resigning himself to torturing himself with regret until he could get Sherlock alone again.
“I would say otherwise.” Said the man with finality. “If you decide to… persevere with current arrangements, I would be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever been in here before,” John mused, looking around. It was filled with books and stacks of paper, an ancient computer sitting on a desk so cluttered John was having trouble imagining Lestrade actually using it.
“You should have seen the look on his face when Nadia hugged him, it was priceless,” John laughed, grinning at a tight-lipped Sherlock.
“So way above my pay grade, then,” John assumed. “Couldn’t you just get Mycroft to get them for you for your birthday or something? Avoid paying for them yourself?”
John hadn’t known Sherlock was impossibly clever, but he was quickly learning by experience as the boy repeatedly annihilated him in round after round of hangman.
John grinned as someone in Doyle howled, “DOOOOOOYY-YLE!” in response, and the announcer blew his whistle irately. Silence fell once more.
He shoved Sherlock, who was walking closest to the edge of the pool. Sherlock toppled, and John opened his mouth to laugh, but felt a hand close around his forearm.
Sherlock pointed to a door, eyes unfocussed, before he doubled over with a pained grunt. John ran into the bathroom, opening every cabinet in sight before finding the syringe. Luckily, there was a bottle already clipped into place, so John gingerly lifted the thing down and returned to Sherlock.
Once he’d managed the entire song once through, he turned to Sherlock with such an expression of triumph that Sherlock couldn’t help grinning back.
John grinned, obviously taking that for consent. “I’ll be back in a few,” he said, leaving the room. Just before the door closed, he poked his head back in and warned, “Don’t look. I’ll know if you have.”
He had intended just to poke his head in, but the sight of the Hulk standing inches from a defiant Sherlock had John at his roommate’s side in seconds.
– and left it at that. It would have been their business. But he hadn’t just met two adults. They were fourteen year old boys, fifteen at most. They didn’t deserve to be in that kind of life. That was no life for a child. No life at all. It was a death. And it was no death for a child.
Both his brain and tongue faltered, then, running dry. So he swallowed. He lowered his gaze to the board and began to move his own knight to demonstrate. “Knights go in L-shapes and can move in any direction.”
He looked up from a text from Jeannette and tried to think of a reply. Something appropriately sweet but with a hint of the wry humour he knew she liked…
“Sometimes… I don’t know. Sometimes I feel like everyone can see straight through me. And they’re whispering about what I did -”
“Hey, lovebirds.” Three smirking boys who had been sitting in the café earlier stood at the end of an aisle perpendicular to the ones John and Sherlock were in, the tallest one doing the talking. “The lube’s over here.”
It was early, but not so early that John could persuade himself that he could stay in bed. It being a Saturday, the first Saturday of the Christmas holidays for Harry, John suspected his family would want a lazy morning. So he shuffled his way downstairs and made himself a cup of tea.
Sherlock wanted to read over it again, and again, and take a cutting, and keep it, and he hadn’t felt this need to hoard since he was small and collecting interesting-looking stones to put on his bookshelves. It made him feel as if he was sitting on a table in the library in the dead of night again, reading by phone-light, but everything was different, in ways he couldn’t ever have imagined or explained, but in ways that made his blood feel a little hotter, his pulse a little faster. He was scared, for a moment, but it was alright. It was okay. Because there was someone else beside him, someone who had written about him so openly and unabashedly in a newspaper hundreds of other people would read, someone who didn’t care about those hundreds of other people at all, and who had waited to read it until they were together, and who was now asking his opinion, as if it was the only one that mattered.
Update July 2020: converting all the texting in this chapter into the new text layout absolutely killed me. I only have myself to blame but it still sucked lol.
“Sherlock!” John protested, but his friend paid no heed. John muttered apologies to the people he was barging through by proxy, Sherlock’s grip on his arm unyielding. John was always surprised when Sherlock touched him, simply because the tall boy was such a self-contained entity. The only times John had seen him initiate any physical contact with other people were with the purpose of manipulation. Technically, every time Sherlock tugged John by the arm, John was being manipulated as well. But somehow it didn’t feel the same.
“Uh,” John said, not sure what half of those instructions even meant, but Sherlock was tugging on his arm.
Sherlock, having taken up his favourite spot in front of the window again, turned to him, mouth twisting into the beginning of a smile, before turning back to the view.
’ until Sherlock did so, not particularly courteously, but he did flick through it very quickly when he thought nobody was watching.
John remembered the whispered conversation, their heads on their pillows, the poem he couldn’t understand but felt all the same.
John hummed an agreement and loaded his plate with battered cod, chips and peas, and was about to move away when he remembered that Sherlock hadn’t eaten in days, and the boy never ate his own food on the rare occasion that he did come to a meal, preferring to steal John’s, and so John piled on another scoop of chips for good measure.
Then John appeared out of nowhere, jogging up to Sherlock, still standing on the sideline, and his face was vibrant with pride.
“When are you going to be home? Can you make it earlier? Because Sherlock and I are – yeah, sure, that’s fine with me, but did you ask mum? Yeah, but you should ask anyway, Harry.”
John finished painting the stem and the heads of the pins, using up a good handful of the small bottles of nail varnish in the process. He had no idea why Harry had so many – something to do with her and Clara and a meticulously planned practical joke that never came to be. He felt a little light-headed from the fumes, but Sherlock didn’t seem to have noticed how noxious the air had become –
“It’ll only take a second,” John bargained, hearing one of Muhammad’s friends whisper something to another one.
“Mainly. Lyrics are distracting.” Sherlock replied. “Plus Mycroft went through a punk phase when he was my age and that is something I do not want becoming a family tradition.”
Sherlock’s face cracked open. John had never seen him smile so widely, seen his eyes crinkle that much. Sherlock quickly looked away, at his dangling feet, and fought it with all his might, but John had seen it, and the memory of it made his entire body feel like it was glowing.
The two lessons that morning passed in agonising length. In biology, the final one, John and Mike kept exchanging looks. Nervous grins. Miming throwing a ball to each other. Sherlock had to keep flicking John’s wrist to get him to stop tapping his pen on the desk.
He sat at the head of the table in the darkness, listening to the hushed voices coming from the kitchen.
Greg being banished to the opposite side of the room, Sherlock quickly grew bored. He tried tapping out messages in Morse code on the desk with his pen but Greg didn’t respond.
“You’ve got tomorrow,” Mike replied. “And basically nobody else from house is entering, so you’re kind of our only hope, mate.”
Sherlock sighed and lowered his gun. “Fine. But you do the same.” He flicked the safety on, crouched, placed the gun on the tiles, and kicked it, sending it skittering off towards a pile of woggles. Seeing the red beams vanish, he stood again. “Thank you.”
The echoes of their shoes scuffing against the grimy tiles faded away until there was silence between them again.
“No, of course not,” Sherlock said. “So the way you look at your friends in their rugby uniforms, that’s all platonic? I understand now.”
“Let John have a go, Sherlock,” Mike reasoned. “Besides, when was the last time anything was yours or John’s anyway.”
After a couple of minutes of radio silence from both, he had resorted to scrolling through his contacts to see who else he could text. The list was quite short.
John’s mind skipped back over that sentence, faltering slightly – did Sherlock just say he had nice arms? John was suddenly hyper-aware of every brush of Sherlock’s skin on his own. It was so rare for his friend to compliment him, it was a shock each time. It was a reminder that Sherlock noticed him – noticed different parts of him for different reasons; sometimes it felt like he didn’t even realise he was there at all, so those little acknowledgements didn’t come often enough. A small thought half-formed underneath all of that, however, a small thought about
Except that John and Sherlock were fully clothed beneath their duvets. As soon as the door closed, John ripped back his covers and sat up. “It’s hotter under there than I’d thought, Jesus,”
“Lights out, you two,” Lestrade said, and John obeyed, switching off the one by his head. Sherlock continued to scroll through something on his phone. “Sherlock. Come on.” Reluctantly, Sherlock reached up and turned off his light as well. “Goodnight, boys,” Lestrade said as he left the room.
Sherlock had competed in the senior fifty metres breaststroke, and John had nearly fallen over the railing as he cheered for him. He again came second, as was expected – the winner was a sports prefect from the year above – and again, Doyle was audibly delighted.
Why did he just take another sip of tea? It was vile, he’d just tried it and thought that it was and then took another sip. Idiot.
“Never mind. Let’s just get to biology and hope no-one else is hurt because of your little outburst.”
John half-laughed as he entered the room. “He was just as awful as you said – patronising, and grumpy as fuck. And you got his lecture right almost word for word… Oh, I’ve got your timetable for you, by the way.”
“John, it doesn’t mean anything necessarily,” Sherlock began quietly, stepping closer to his friend.
He walked back towards Mycroft, a slow smirk spreading on his mouth as he reached to grab Mycroft’s silk tie, weaving his fingers around it.        Tugging gently, he used his other hand to caress Mycroft’s face.
John was, quite frankly, about to scream. Hearing Greg mutter the words, “Why the heck is he so near her...” didn’t make it any better. He could almost foresee this... tattooed, evil boy influence his little angel’s future by breaking her fragile little heart.
“Well...um...shall we?” John muttered, walking forward to button up the rest of the shirt, blushing as Sherlock smirked down at him.
John laughed as he unconsciously felt the rings in his pocket, “Why don’t you go ahead and put the groceries in the food fridge and I’ll go clean her up.” (I’m going to just interject as the writer that Sherlock and John now have two fridges, for food and experiments because I can imagine them agreeing to this.)
“Yes,” John replied, and was confused at the looks upon his friends’ faces. “Because he was one of my closest friends.” There was little change in the expressions of his peers, so he sighed. “If you assume that every gay person has ulterior motives with you, then I can assure you that no gay person has ulterior motives with you because you’re a prick.”
“Yes, well, it changes. But, uh, he always says the same thing to me, I think. Sometimes I don’t even remember waking up, in the morning, that is. But I know I do.”
“Oh, yeah,” Mike said casually. “He’ll be on top of the world one minute, and the next, he’ll be picking fights with anyone who even breathes too loud.”
“All right, just asking,” muttered John under his breath as Clara pushed past him. He heard the door shut downstairs and then turned back to Harry.
John kept turning over Mike’s concerned face in his mind. He had been the first person to show both Sherlock and John any kindness at St. Bart’s, under two very different sets of circumstances. John wondered absently if he should go to Lestrade and take himself out of the running for head of house; Mike would certainly do a better job than John, who had been ready to pulverise a fellow housemate in the common room not a few hours ago.
How about the clothes? There was a whitish stain on the jumper, right in the middle. Toothpaste seemed the most likely explanation – maybe he’d rushed his exit from home this morning. When the man turned his head, John could see smudges all over the glasses as they caught the light. The ends of the man’s coat sleeves were discoloured from years of stains.
John exhaled. "Okay. Good." And then he realised Sherlock had called her Lottie instead of Charlotte, and something about that small loss of formality made John smile.
He turned his attention back to the world beyond the window and closed his eyes. The red glow of his eyelids was a blank canvas splashed with memories, some recent, some fading, some barely there at all.
The singular soft clap had come from where John was sitting, but Sherlock forced himself to be critical – he could have got it wrong, could have misjudged, they could have switched places – but no. The voice that followed, joking as if it was a common thing, kissing boys, was John’s.
Sherlock turned to the door. His friend was standing on the threshold, rugby boots in one hand and a sports bag in the other.
Sherlock was frowning at him. “Nothing could change my mind,” he said, and John felt himself shaking with each punch of his heartbeat.
Sherlock gave him a condescending look that only infuriated John even more. “If you must know, I was recording and analysing the post-mortem effects of common household aerosols on various insects.”
He came back into his room from the bathroom after having brushed his teeth and saw his phone sitting on his bed. He smiled for a moment, then found his headphones and flopped onto his bed, plugged them in, turned the volume up to the maximum, and scrolled through his and Sherlock’s texts, found his present, his waltz, and pressed play, closing his eyes.
“All right. Good luck, I guess,” she laughed one last time, then entered the tuck shop. Through the frosted glass windows, the remaining two could make out her form finding a table and sitting, facing the counter.
“Aw, she’s out,” Harry sang, bouncing down the stairs. “Where you been all day, Johhny? I missed you,”
The boys in the pool were starting to stagger. Doyle, Dickens and Golding were in the lead, with Green at the very back.
He looked awful – there was mud streaked down his back, and he was pale. He seemed a little dazed, blinking slowly.
The house was quiet in a way John had never experienced. He trailed his hand up the banister as he climbed the stairs, listening to his own footsteps and realising that he was alone in Doyle for the first and, most likely, last time. When he reached the top floor, he gave the banister a squeeze for good luck before moving away down the corridor towards the upturned laundry basket underneath the open attic door. He had decided what he wanted to say to Sherlock.
The film was, indeed, as John had put it, ‘shitty’. The acting was of school Nativity standards, the script had no continuity and the score seemed vaguely familiar. The plot involved a family conflict –
“How’re you feeling?” he asked, standing up. It was ambitious of him to hope for a reply, and he wasn’t given one. “Hey.” He stepped closer to Sherlock, and repeated, softer this time, “How’re you feeling?”
“Obviously not,” John said seriously. “But just take it, I don’t want to go back still holding two beers.”
“Do you remember in the last week of last term, when you walked in on the meeting about house swimming?”
He had reluctantly let his therapist flick through his drawings on his last visit. She had nodded and made approving sounds every now and again, and had questioned whether this was becoming more of a visual diary than a record of how he was feeling, and he had pointed out how the two things were barely indistinguishable from each other, and she had given it back to him. What she had said was true, to some extent; as he looked back over the pages since he’d started at Bart’s, certain events did jump out at him. There was the tube of paint he’d thrown at Sherlock, there were the studs of his army boot caked in mud – that hadn’t been a good day. Sherlock’s violin, after his panic attack; the school crest on the day that he’d played his first rugby match – they’d lost, but respectably. John smiled at the memory of Mike doing a spectacular double forward roll as he tripped over one of the other players – they still hadn’t let him live that down.
“Oh my god,” he giggled. He started swinging his arms and stamping his sock-clad feet in quite an alarming manner.
Without giving him a chance to finish, Sherlock stalked off down the alleyway, leaving John to his very confused thoughts.
The boy had finally turned around. His shirt was muddy and ripped across the front; he had a bruise forming on his cheek and a split lip. He looked as if he had been in some sort of pub brawl; he had cuts everywhere, and one particularly worrying one horribly close to his left eye.
“John would kill me if I didn’t,” Sherlock confessed, breaking his butler act and making Mrs Watson laugh. The boy had a way with people, Harry would give him that.
, nothing more, because Sherlock had not actually said anything. That was all John had to go off, a facial expression, fleeting and ambiguous. Could John even remember it right? Was the image he clung to real, or was it what he wanted to be real?
“Yes, let’s,” Sherlock replied, not taking his eyes off Victor, who was glaring at him with a malignant half-smile. “If you’ll excuse me.”
He settled in his chair and shoved his backpack under the table. As he looked up again, he noticed a figure he didn’t recognise sitting in the seat in front of him.
“Listen, mate, I’m only trying to help.” John said in what he hoped was a soothing tone, putting up his hands in defeat.
“You just… disappear sometimes,” John elaborated, looking back down to his paper again and sketching a large curve. “It’s like you can’t hear me or see me or anything.”
“True that,” agreed Harry. “And you’ve got to take stupid amounts of selfies and spend hours talking about boys and do each other’s hair and paint each other’s toes,”
Unfortunately, John did. His own desperate thoughts had turned to this option more than once, when the immensity of the hungry, wanting thing in him felt too much, like he was going to burst.
“He only brings people in here for serious stuff,” Mike said, settling himself on a worn sofa. “Did he not bring you in here when you decked someone within, like, a month of getting here?”
He took John into a room to do a couple of checks, telling Sherlock to sit on a pew and wait. The sudden space on the left side of his body felt foreign.
Sherlock stood beneath Raz’s window, set into the second floor of Dickens, throwing pebbles at the aforementioned panes of glass in a rhythm just irregular enough to annoy the occupants into waking.
“Well… yeah,” John said, “all girls want to get dressed up with their boyfriend. To be asked formally. To be romanced.”
“Is it?” John said, and Sherlock saw a red mark appear on John’s forehead. He turned around, aiming his gun at the direction from which the beams seemed to be coming, up towards the viewing gallery.
Sherlock felt a twitch of annoyance. “I have,” he said, and realised he sounded like a child. He persisted. “Muhammad.”
“I just don’t really like the taste,” Sherlock said reasonably. “Plus, alcohol is like looking through clouded glass, it makes people stupid. I don’t do stupid.”
Once they were both ready, they made their way to the front door. Sherlock put a gloved hand on the handle, pushed down, and pulled.
His eye was caught by a small, empty box in his bin. He reached out, took it, and dumped everything inside it. He then found some sellotape and sealed the box tight, using up nearly all the roll in the process. Box inside plastic bag inside plastic bag inside plastic bag, taped at the opening.
“Come here, Sherlock, love,” she invited, holding out her arms. Sherlock walked into her, folding into her embrace much more… pliably than Harry had thought he would. “Thank you for helping us organise this little outing.”
She came to a stop next to him. John looked up at her, watching her peer at his lap. He met her gaze, knowing (
“No,” John said, quickly drawing the sketch pad out of Sherlock’s reach. “I’ll show you when they’re done.”
John was speechless. The man looked both boys in the eye before turning and leaving the room as silently as he’d come, clicking the door shut behind him.
Sherlock was putting his violin down and moving across the shimmering space and John was on his feet and Sherlock was moving their chairs away from their desks to in front of their door to clear space and then Sherlock was there, right there.
Three words, big brother. We have three words in Latin. We have a missing can of American spray paint. We have no witnesses. We have handwriting that tells us nothing about the person who wrote it. Not even gender. The letters were androgynous. We have an hour spent interrogating the boy who told Irene to go to the bike sheds that night. To no avail. To the boy saying a sheet of paper under had seen slipped under his door with the words ‘garages’ and ‘eleven’ and ‘Tuesday’ and nothing else in size sixteen Calibri font. To the boy saying he’d put the paper in the recycling.
If he did this, he knew he wouldn’t be able to go back again. He would be back on the roof again but this time no one would be coming to drag him off.
“Sherlock, that was the most – like, I’m standing on my back doorstep and it’s fucking freezing but I couldn’t text you because I couldn’t even think, and I can’t even think now, Jesus, Sherlock,
Sherlock could feel John recovering, as his steps grew surer and the weight around Sherlock’s neck grew lighter. But the arm remained, as did Sherlock’s.
“Of course I miss some parts of it, yeah. But not as much as I thought I would. It’s not as… scary as I’d imagined.”
“I feel like death warmed up,” he mumbled, and John could see his eyelids were already drooping again.
He turned over and then he and Sherlock were facing each other and John tried not to think about how intimate this felt.
The morning slipped into afternoon. John didn’t go to lunch; rather, he stayed in Doyle with Sherlock and ate toast. Sherlock seemed full of energy; John tried to get him to direct it into tidying their room and packing for the half term holiday, but Sherlock didn’t even dignify him with a response.
Harry’s mother employed her best skill: small talk, while Harry couldn’t help but let her eyes wander. She could see straight up to the top of the house thanks to the huge spiral staircase that stretched up above her. Boys were coming and going through the doors that led off, presumably, to a rabbit warren of corridors and rooms that Harry would probably never see. She wondered what life was like there, to live at school. She didn’t think she would be able to stand it. But her brother was the most adaptable person she knew.
The walk back to Doyle was unpleasant. The sub-zero air chilled him to the bone, and he wished he’d dried his hair a little more.
“Don’t worry,” Habiba told John. “We’ll kill him for you!” She and the other girls raised their wands and Sherlock very nearly panicked. They pointed them at Sherlock and Habiba shouted “Avada Kedavra!”
“None of your beeswax.” Mike responded, voice too jovial to be natural. There was a heavy pause in which Mike regained his composure, the other boy –
One of the upper sixth started up a chant, and John couldn’t help joining in, having to work quite hard to keep up with the pace of the group. Sherlock was having no trouble, however, as he strode silently beside him.
Sherlock pretended not to notice the small sting of insult in the last word and began. “From the conversation of your friends, I’d say she is a former romantic attachment, ex-girlfriend most likely. It was serious, obviously. She went to your old school and... and...”
I know I say this every single chapter, but I really do intend to update more often now. I found this chapter a little tricky, which is partly why it took so long.
John rounded the corner into Sherlock’s former bedroom and let out a breath at the sight of Sherlock’s silhouette through the open window. He stepped out into the unyielding darkness and sat down next to his friend.
John did as she said, slipping his arms into the sleeves and shifting and adjusting the coat until it felt just right. It was fitted and John could tell it would be perfectly cosy during the winter, the cotton durable and long-lasting.
A small boy was sitting on the ground, angrily wiping at his eyes and sniffling. Two other boys, the twins, John struggled to remember their names at that moment, were standing next to him awkwardly, unsure of what to do.
Sherlock seemed to be making a beeline for Angelo, marching through the entire first rugby team, who all gradually ceased their drills and stared as this stranger made his way through their midst.
“I don’t care,” John said, and surprised himself with the truth of it. “I’m going to be a doctor. This is training.”
by Sherlock’s deductions, and there was another emotion there that Sherlock hadn’t been able to place at the time. Upon reflection, Sherlock realised that he’d misjudged that other dominant emotion showing itself through John’s body language. It wasn't sadness; it was relief. This intrigued Sherlock. It was an inconsequential detail, but it was different, and different wasn’t dull.
“I’m nearly done,” Sherlock said, but John grabbed the phone out of his fingers and both boys ignored the warmth of each other’s hands. “Hey!”
While he was making the teas – plural; if he put it down within Sherlock’s reach, hopefully he’d drink it when John wasn’t looking – his phone buzzed.
“Yeah, pretty much,” John replied, putting his phone back in his pocket and returning his attention to the pasta.
On Monday morning, Lestrade called him and Mike up to the front of the common room during registration.
Opening doors was a little tricky, but carrying Sherlock back to their room was easier than John had expected. It was helped by Sherlock’s refusal to eat like a normal human, of course, and all the rigorous rugby training and gym sessions Mike had dragged John to. With each step, John forced himself to calm, calm, calm – he had someone to look after.
It was a photo of God Staunton - his student profile picture, by the look of it - overlaid with the text:
A few moments passed, John cursing as he scrubbed at his face with his sister’s make up remover. Sherlock sat cross-legged on John’s bed, wandering through his head space.
“Go, Sherlock!” he screamed, before joining in with Doyle’s chants of “SHER-LOCK! SHER-LOCK! SHER-LOCK!”
Sherlock didn’t answer and John looked closer at him. There was a strange set to his mouth, his lips parted, turned downwards, and his eyes were wide in the low light. He was breathing hard, like he’d been running. John stepped towards him. “Are you okay?”
“Harry?” John called as his sister began to walk away. “Not too much alcohol, yeah? Don’t do anything stupid.”
“This game is way more fun when you’re drunk,” John said suddenly, ripping the paper off his forehead and doing the same to Sherlock’s before he had a chance to look at what was written there. He scrunched the names up into a ball and dropped them into the bin under his desk.
John smiled. “As for Sherlock, why don’t you ask his highness himself?” he got up and appeared to be tugging at someone, and Sherlock was pulled into frame, tieless, jumperless, and holding a pair of forceps.
He put her down in front of the bathroom door, and turned the shower on. Once it was at the right temperature, he turned to her.
Sherlock laughed again. John thought he heard him sniff. Was he crying? “I told you, John, that day we met. I looked at the list to see who was to be roomed with me. Once I had your name, I researched you. I found out everything I could to impress you.”
It was always busy along the banks of the Thames, and that day was no different. He stood leaning on a railing, mesmerised by the murky water slapping against some rotted-looking pontoons and the stone that kept it where it was supposed to be.
He looked up, but it was impossible to see anything in the evening light. But there – another cold something landed on his cheek, then his nose, then in his eye, and he held out a hand.
John perched on the plastic bench and shivered. He tried to subtly bury his face in his scarf but to no avail, opting to ball his fists in his blazer pockets and make himself as small as possible, thankful for the shelter of the bus stop from the biting breeze.
John paused, trying to place the high pitched sound that had just erupted behind him. He quickly eliminated the impossible, and turned around to face the improbable with a frown.
John woke early on a frigid Thursday morning three days later. He had fallen asleep while texting Sherlock again, but he had temporarily forgotten that, and he regarded, bewildered, the still-on bedside lamp for a few moments before registering the feeling of a block of metal digging into his hip and realising what had happened.
The card game the boys were playing is called ‘Bullshit’ (or 'Liar', when you're in polite company...!) and it involves lying about what cards you have. It’s great fun and Sherlock would win every single time.
John glanced at Sherlock, who was watching him. “Sounds a bit like – I mean, I know you can’t tell, but, could it have been a heart attack?”
Sherlock looked at the dining table. Six people. He felt as if he was in an embrace, sitting there. He felt as if he was part of a hastily-assembled family of sorts. The Watsons and their satellites.
John made a tutting sound, and rolled his eyes. He took the newspaper off Sherlock’s leg, and that brush and then absence of paper made Sherlock feel as if something was slipping away from him.
Sherlock’s phone rang, and he answered it with the sigh that meant ‘Mycroft’. “I’m on my way to the station. No. No! Jesus Christ, Mycroft, you know full well – do you think I care?” Sherlock hung up, then saw John was looking at him. “What?”
“Er… not really, went to my cousins’ for a few days, went to a house party – got off with this girl with
“Ooh, he’ll be in an awful mood when you get back to house at break… mind you, he looks magnificent when he’s angry, all moody and-” Molly stopped, mortified. “Did I just say that out loud?” John nodded, biting back a laugh. “Oh, God…” Molly turned around again, red flushing her cheeks.
The crunch of their shoes in the snow and the swish-swish-swish of their coats and the rustle of the bag full of pastry.
“Stay?” John finished. This was not right. Not right at all. “You don’t need to ask.” John opened the door to the bathroom and flicked on the light. “Go and wash your face. You look like hell.”
anything.” They’d been over that point many times, and John had grown very tired very quickly of it, and so, this time, ignored her and carried on.
“He said I was trespassing or something,” Sherlock said airily, disappearing inside room twenty-one, leaving John to half-jog the last few metres.
Somehow, they ended up with another bottle of beer each, and Sherlock hated the taste, but kept drinking it, because it made the warmth in his belly more ambiguous. Somehow, they ended up in the drawing room, standing by a wall.
During the winter holidays, when John had recounted his tales of school, he had forgotten that not all his time was spent on adventures with Sherlock. Boy, would that have been nice.
“Sherlock – ” John began, but when his friend looked up at him, the words died on his tongue. “I brought you this as well,” he said instead, showing him the rosin.
“Yes, you do. We’ve met. And we will meet again. But only once you’ve proven to me that you’re clever enough.”
John’s mind raced through all those he had called his best friend in his lifetime. It wasn’t a particularly long race, and he finished it with a growing sense of apprehension.
The walk to the village church was long anyway, but on that Sunday, it stretched out into a tortuous eternity. Sherlock was still nowhere to be seen, so John had no choice but to walk with Mike and the others and make conversation.
Sherlock’s car followed their taxi out of the school gates and through the village, slipping into the lane next to them at a roundabout as the traffic slowed to a crawl. John tried to see through the tinted windows but it was like trying to see through a brick wall.
Sherlock didn’t wait to hear his brother’s reply, storming out of the kitchen and wishing he could feel the grain of the wood beneath his fingers as he pulled his bedroom door shut.
Seb Moran was lying on his front, reloading a rifle pointed in the direction of a row of targets at the far end of the room. John shouted his name to get his attention, and Seb pushed his ear defenders off his head and turned to him.
“Most people have, John,” Sherlock said, and it was true. He was used to people knowing his name, though he was less used to his name being followed by another. He was still adjusting to the you-plural.
John would need water to get him through the mammoth task of remembering which of the items in room twenty-one belonged to him and which belonged to Sherlock, so he took himself downstairs to the common room. He got as far as stepping towards the kitchenette before a familiar voice called his name.
John exhaled, and his next breath joined in with the cheers of his housemates. He saw Eddie shakily get to his feet and begin walking to the stage, following the heads of Collins and Funke, the latter of whom looked more than a little miffed to have been usurped from their throne by such an underdog.
The thing came closer. John quit his frantic movements, knowing it was hopeless as his survival instinct kicked in, telling him to shut the hell up. The doctor bit down on his tongue and looked away, watching his breath as it turned white and disappeared in front of him. The air was cold and so was John, but that problem was so soon forgotten that it felt as if it hadn't been a problem in the first place. For fuck's sakes, there was a ginormous wolf staring him down, cold was nothing compared to the fear in John's heart. Call it a fear, call it a phobia, but wolves were more than a simple nightmare to the doctor.
And then what? What had Sherlock planned to do then? Or before? If John had never found out, would it have still continued on? For how long? Even after John looked up through dark blue eyes, kneeled on his good knee with a velvet box in his hand?
John told himself this, tried to reassure himself as his eyes closed again. Immediately, he reopened them with panic as he felt himself being moved, tugged into the space between Sherlock's fore and hind legs, his head being awkwardly forced to rest on the thing's limb as what-should-be-Sherlock's-left-arm circled the tiny man's waist. John was pinned, wrapped in a cocoon of warm with one of the most dangerous and most confusion-inducing creatures holding him in place. Their even breaths were quiet in the night, and the doctor had to admit, his Sherlock was rather comfortable like this, cuddly and no sharp bones, replaced by thick black fur. John ran his hands through the fur that was closest to him, working on small knots and tangles while listening to Sherlock's purrs before he eventually lost himself to a content sleep.
John's forced himself to concentrate, using the vodka to clean the wound before ordering Sherlock to thread the thread into the needle. He reached over with his left had to grab it, his face turning red with effort. Around him, there was a puddle of blood- Max's and John's combined. The doctor ignored it and made his shot arm come up, holding the needle in it with force as he used his uninjured left hand to hold the wound shut as best as he could. After what felt like
i should've probably done trigger warnings but i also consider trigger warnings to be spoilers. and aren't tags enough of a warning? you know what you're getting yourself into when you come into our angst-ridden world. 🍯 here's some honey for you, you poor things.
"I'll stay the night at Sarah's if you want-," John thought to himself, his eyes lighting up excitedly for a minute. "She's gotten married, hasn't she? That bloke- her fianceé, nice couple. We should visit soon." And as soon as the words slipped out, John frowned to himself. There was no
Sherlock covered his mouth as the horror of the situation punched him in the stomach. He left the room, ran in others, trying to find... Something.
Sherlock was growing worried as he didn't get any answer to his texts. Slowly, he walked toward Baker Street. There was no point in pacing randomly in London's streets, without any clues about where John was. "Don't do anything stupid. SH" He climbed up the stairs to his flat. Max was dressed, his clothes rumpled from the hurry. He tried to kiss the detective, but Sherlock shook his head. "Thanks for the biscuits. SH" Swallowing thickly, he sat down in his armchair, looking John's. "...You can leave for now." He said softly to Max.
Sherlock scrambled, emitting a shout, at least he hoped it was a shout, it could’ve been easily a cry. Panic crept into his heart, forcing it out or rhythm before it seeped into his lungs, preventing him from breathing. The worst of it was the sobs that were threatening to bubble out. The tears pricked at the corners of his eyes as he gasped, the creature holding a paw over his torso as if to steady him, its eyes worried. But of course, the detective didn’t notice that. He could only see himself being trapped, held down by the monster as it tried to hurt him. "Please," he murmured. A beg. Sherlock Holmes never begged, and yet, his voice was small, barely there, and desperate. The large ear of the animal twitched, its face moving and expressing something akin to surprise.
"Doctor Watson." Mycroft said quietly. It wouldn't be much difficult to push John away if he tried to hurt him. He was perhaps a soldier, but Mycroft was a Holmes. And not sounding calm would only make him feel angrier anyway. "Of course, I knew. I just didn't see the point to tell you. It's my brother's privacy, after all." He  said it with a smirk. Privacy was an abstract concept for anyone who knew either Mycroft or Sherlock. "Should I add that your relationship with him made my brother happy?" It wasn't about this. Obviously, it wasn't. Sherlock thought Max had just been a random lover, but Mycroft knew better than that. He had read him, found his other identities. And that, he hadn't told his brother about. "You truly shouldn't be angry like this. It's just sex.”
And. Thank you for all the wonderful, beautiful comments. Thank you for reading and spending your time on this ride of an rp.

Sherlock never begged anyone. "John, I.... Please." He didn't try to touch him again, fearing to hurt his ex lover. "I love you. Not him.”
He could grieve and move on after Max, even if it was going to be horribly painful. But not for John. For John, he'd actually go mad with pain, and he would possibly go through with his “faux” threat to kill. Including himself.
John felt trapped. A prison of sleep underlined by pure, fiery pain. His eyes moved behind his eyelids, frantic and trying their best to wake up. The doctor was losing blood and his wounds were open to the grimly floor- open to infections. He forced himself to move, trying to do anything to ground himself before he succumbed fully to the shock and pain, feeling nothing except for the hint of cool metal in his hand.
It didn't matter. John stayed kneeling, gritting his teeth as harshly as he could, knowing full well that he had the perfect amount of time before he went into hemorrhagic shock. The room spun as John used his right hand to pull up the left, earning himself a pained shout. There was no one else to do it. Hell, if Sherlock actually had retained the information in his mind- the detective not really caring of anyone other than himself.
Mycroft Holmes. John closed the door without a word, deciding that moist pants and trousers were better than no pants and trousers. He pulled on the vest as well, not wanting the British Government to see his mangled shoulder. John didn't have the energy for another piteous look. He opened the door agin, but didn't allow the man invitation to enter in. "Mycroft." The other man smiled dryly and pushed his way in anyway, "Hello, John." He pulled out a box from his pocket, handing it to John. "The sim card's been miraculously saved, Doctor. I'd recommend not to throw it in a river again- not sure it will stand." John took it, staring down with hate at it before chucking it onto the bed.
He felt his lips tingle lightly, feeling the kiss that would've proceeded those words. John blinked again, forcing himself out of his daydream and back into his broken, scarred reality.
John woke to a warm body beside him and a head resting on top of his. Of course, he panicked immediately but forced himself to calm. Sherlock. The man was breathtaking when he wasn't actively trying to kill John. And perhaps- he was breathtaking even then. John's shoulder ached as he moved the tiniest bit, earning a rough growl out of the doctor before forcing it stifled.
The sparkle of sadness he saw in John's eyes disappeared almost immediately. But it was enough. Enough for the detective to know the doctor still loved him, somehow, a small glimmer of it stayed in the man’s eye, despite his best effort to wall up his feelings. "Please."
John’s mind filled with Sherlock’s familiar voice. The same voice that had coaxed him through nightmares before. He exhaled slowly, unconsciously as he calmed. Instead, his dreams filled with Sherlock. Baking. John smiled, seeing the small strip of flour that he’d managed to get on his ridiculously high cheekbones. He watched himself move closer and use his thumb to wipe it away before playfully smacking the man. “I though chemists were supposed to have steady hands and all.” He watched himself check on the pastry while Sherlock whisked another batch. He sighed, content as he turned in his sleep, facing Sherlock unknowingly as he did so, the smallest, serenest of smiles gracing his face.
Sherlock was trembling from desire. Finally, finally, Max had managed to reach him. To frustrate his body enough for his mind to be blurry in arousal. For the time being, he didn't think about John. He thought about his lover's hands, slowly teasing his transport, touching and kissing and always avoiding the places he needed the most. Sherlock's thighs were shaking, but he didn't beg, his jaw locked as his eyelids fluttered rapidly, unable to hold still. His hands clenched the sheets under him, and he muted his moans by biting down his lip. Max laughed jokingly, and Sherlock felt something breaking inside him. His body tensed up without anymore contact, curling up around nothing, and a ruined, disappointing orgasm was ripped through him. "Aaah-Ah." He breathed out heavily.
Sherlock had caused all this. It was his fault. But if the detective left, if he didn’t take up the bad-guy in the game by pretending he’d kill in the if so situation, the doctor would see no point in staying alive. And if there was one thing Sherlock could never be able to take, it was John's death.
Sherlock hunched over his microscope, watching his slow-moving microorganisms. Frustration growled through him, annoyance sparking as they gave out and died. For what? For what reason? He exhaled loudly, running his fingers through his hair. Cold— was it cold? When did it turn cold? No wonder the creatures had died, some imbecile (John) had forgotten to turn the heating on. Where was he anyway? Gone for a
John felt his eyes roll back as he began falling down, the whole room silent all of a sudden- six words ringing through his head as he did so.
Mycroft rubbed his expensive suit, making sure John hadn't ruined it. "You really shouldn't threaten me, Doctor Watson. It would be unwise." The eldest Holmes said, getting closer to the door. "I clearly see you aren't in the mood to listen to what I have to say, and I can't afford to let his kind of information down onto a deaf ear. I’ll be in touch." He tilted his head. "Don't judge my brother too harshly. I know what you did with that woman, and I can assure your dirty little secrets make it nearly impossible for you to judge my brother." Then he left.
And catch up on all the comments. Sorry, guys, Camille and I love your comments I've just been too busy and she doesn't have an acc. Hugs to all of you, thank you for reading our crazy, crazy story.
And once inside the door of their own flat, Sherlock had shoved John away-- an exact and utter opposite from how he'd practically been a second skin to the doctor before. He half crawled, half stumbled to his bedroom and slammed the door shut behind him.
“John!” The man threw open his eyes almost guiltily, as if he’d been caught sleeping in after an alarm clock had sounded. He tried his best to move but felt more or less that he was weighed down on his left sideline nothing except for a wild flash of white and red pain twisting together. “Sher-“ John took in a deep breath, letting out a low, harsh shout when he felt his shoulder. He looked down at it confusedly, not understanding why it was being so immobile.
"John!" He screamed. "Oh, God. John!" He crouched close to the doctor, while Max was pitifully turning pale. "Don't die. The both of you. Don't die!" He cut the thick ropes as quickly as he could.
Sensing an opportunity, Sherlock kicked, catching the thing in the shoulder before finding his feet and running towards the door of the flat, only to find it locked. He fumbled with the lock, trying to open it, but to no avail. He felt his knees give out as the creature tugged on the base of his pants, throwing the detective off balance. He hit the floor with a smack to his head, further disoriented by the shock of falling and the panic of the thing still in the room. There was really no point anymore. The detective curled in on himself, drawing into himself like a child hiding from the dark as the creatures growled lightly behind him, its claws making scratching noises as it paced.
John smirked sadly and rolled his eyes before he closed them. As if. As if there was anyone to love him. To like him. To care for him. Hell, there wasn't anyone for him to love, to like, or to care for. "No- you wouldn't have. You don't get off on committing murders." He sniffed a bit, eyes tearing up as his bandaged back faced Sherlock. His words were much quieter when he opened his mouth again. "Just get off on hurting people." He pushed the sidebar with the morphine amount indication to high as he settled back and for the first time since leaving Sherlock, he felt safe enough to sleep.
Sherlock hurried to close John’s bullet wound. It would be an ugly scar without any doubt, but he wasn't worrying over that right now. He just needed to close the injury before John would bleed out. "I can't lose you, I can't... John!" He felt life leaving his love, as well as his oxygen. His mouth pressed against John's in the least romantic way, and he shared his breath, tears rolling down his cheeks and falling all over John's.
John slept restlessly, despite the drugs that were running through him. He shifted, head moving from time to side and limbs slowly and resistantly flailing. Moriarty, Sherlock, Max. He felt the sheen of sweat forming over his forehead as he moaned silently, eyes scrunched together. Mistake. Sleeping was a mistake. John had nightmares combined with the war, Moriarty grinning, leaning over him as their bodies pressed together unwillingly, John’s wounded back pressing into the desert sand as a line of men waited to take the soldier’s arse . He the groans were louder, now, the smallest of tears running behind his eyes. He was trapped in his head once more, and it felt as if he wasn’t ever getting out again.
John poke out so much that he shut up, relaxing in the thought he could buy whatever he needed again. But when the doctor came back with the razors, and threw them away along with Sherlock's evils, he understood he couldn't. He couldn't find the strength inside him to break that silent vow. Sherlock stared to the toilets, then to the floor.
in front of Sherlock- who could read the doctor as clearly as John could read a pulse. He would do it within the privacy of loneliness. Do it when he dreamt. He would do it when he was dead. But not now.
John got up before Mycroft could say anything, pouring his last bit of energy into the movement. He didn't have the energy to talk. To deal with this. To even walk- or simply keep breathing. "Look, if you stop by again, you'll be very thankful that I don't have my gun with me." He forced the man out of the suit, locking it before propping a chair under the door knob. God knew that Mycroft could pick a simply hotel room lock. He was the clever one.
"Sher-" He couldn't say the man's name. Not when he'd dreamt it all those nights when Moriarty had broken him. Not when he'd had the syllables had reverberated through his every time that he'd been tied and taken. He closed his eyes, feeling the phantom pain that broke through him. "Never.
The smile on John's face was beautiful. Sherlock leaned over, just breathing close to them. He didn't kiss the man, wouldn't do this without his consent, not after everything that had happened between them, not while knowing John no longer loved him. But feeling his breathing, his heart beating. It was beautiful. Sherlock stepped back after a while, pulling the blanket a bit higher, just as John had done when The Woman had drugged him- and for the many nights they’d shared together after John had finally figured out that he was not not gay. He kept talking softly, saying nonsense, creating fakes days from actual memories he had. He sat there, next to John's bed, watching the man, unable to look away.
John leant tired back against the sofa, eyes closing as a sigh escaped quiet lips. He knew it was needless to be silent, that Sherlock was in his post-case fatigue and was most likely sleeping like the dead. Still, the doctor couldn't help the instinctive need to stay quiet, just in case the ridiculous man woke and attempted to throw the ironing box again. It was still very much raining outside, and it just happened that the heating indoors wasn't cutting it, despite the fact that the exhausted man had set it to nearly eighty degrees. Another shudder ran through the drenched man-- who frowned, hearing the furnace sputter and give out. There were tears threatening his eyes, each of him feeling more and more miserable as the seconds ticked by. He had just wanted some takeaway and to buy some blankets, but no!
Dog tags.They were dog tags. Sherlock let out a harsh breath, trying to make sense of anything, though fear was still clouding him, making it nearly impossible. He slowly reached up, flinching as the thing growled, freezing as it continued before continuing his actions as it stopped. He read the words and numbers on the metal, his mind fighting and racing against the thick emotions that surrounded him as it attempted to register the information.
For fucks sakes, the man was bleeding out but was trying his best to save another. Ever the soldier... Ever the romantic. This man-
Max waited until his boss left the room. Then, a shaky breath escaped his lips. He left John alone, hurrying as quickly as he could toward the cell holding Sherlock.
He looked up at Sherlock with unreadable, hatred-filled eyes, though it wasn’t known if the hatred was for Sherlock, Max, or Moriarty himself. He looked at the man in Sherlock’s hands- who was holding him possessively. John, even though his body on fire, put up his walls, eyes turning into a shielded fortress from vulnerability. “Mycroft-“ John forced himself to concentrate, straining, “Mycroft can’t reach us here- I can,” The doctor took in a deep breath, biting on his tongue in attempt to find some sense of control. “Find stitches. Or floss and a needle, anything. He’s losing too much blood too fast. Something to disinfect if you can manage.” John forced himself to push his way to the wall, using it to push himself to a crouching position- back against it as he managed to push himself half a foot before he fell back down. He closed his eyes, a moan interlaced with pain escaping him.
Oh, there was that threat of Sherlock turning into a serial killer as well, but to be fair, hadn't that always been there?
Sherlock had insisted (threatened) that they make their way home, but it was only when he started stumbling, slurring his words did John start to worry and finally give in. In the cab, he had leant against John, excess warmth radiating off the detective as he cuddled in closer to his flatmate, burrowing his nose into the doctor's neck. John had looked up into the rear-view mirror, catching the cabbie's eye-- which shone with a certain look that held amusement and an odd twinkle. John knew that look. It was a sign, his mind automatically sending signals to sigh and reply with a tired hiss of, "I'm not gay." And once they had gotten in front 221 Baker Street, Sherlock had clung to John, sniffing him oddly while the doctor had paid the fare. "Not gay, my arse," the cabbie had said.
, John managed to fix the man up, checking for his pulse and breathing as he did so. Faint. But still there. "Hospital- he needs to go to hospital." The doctor exhaled, feeling each and every muscle in his body give up, not having enough oxygen delivered to them as he finally collapsed, his own pulse erratic and what seemed to be final words mumbled at Sherlock. "You bloody bastard. I hate you so much. There you go, I've patched up the man you love. Bye, you
OTHERWISE, THANK MY AMAZING CO-WRITER CAMILLE AND FRIEND FOR WHOOPING MY ASS IN LINE AND REMINDING ME TO UPDATE BECAUSE I TRULY AM TERRIBLE.
Sherlock protested when John took his box away from him. Or he would have if the doctor's touch hadn't been so gentle. He craved to see bits of the old John-
It joined him, dragging its tail across Sherlock’s trembling body as its large figure circled him, reading him.
Written with Camilllllee. We're almost done with the actual rp, I just need to dig through email and put them together. And then we'll be done with the story.
He stood, wanting to run, hide- anything to get away from his complex mix of emotions. "I'll be gone out of the flat by tomorrow- sorry it's taking so long. I don't want to..." John searched for the right word, "contaminate your home." He said it with absolutely no retortion. It was just information. An explanation.
