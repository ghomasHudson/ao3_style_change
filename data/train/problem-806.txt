"That sounds so pedestrian. Anyhow, you enjoy looking for murderers and now I'm presenting you with one."
John’s cock had begun leaking sometime around Sherlock’s “anything you want” moan and he knew without a doubt that he needed to have his cock embraced by Sherlock’s tight heat. John removed his fingers and;
Elizabeth beamed up at Bob, knowing in her heart that with Bob’s acceptance of John Hamish Watson, things were going to be alright.
“No! I’m not safe wording out! I’m more than capable of, of,” Sherlock nodded at John’s cock with his head, “taking all of that! What are you waiting for? Stick it in me and get it over with so I can go home.”
Moriarty has decided to stop waiting for Sherlock to find him so he sets up a meeting at the local diner in the middle of the night. A disagreement ensues - as you'd expect.
“Look. A week and a half ago, I’d never even heard of a Dhamphir much less Sherlock Holmes. Not to mention the fact that vampires exist! With as much time as he spends in the morgue, you’d think that I might have met him before now.”
“Sherlock, I’m going to ask you one more time to leave and then I’m going to take you outside and kick your arse six ways to Sunday,” John said belligerently.
“Oh. Well, that’s good then. Isn’t it? I mean, unless you don’t like ivy. Do you? Like ivy, I mean?” John asked anxiously.
“Now, about that injection…just leave it by the bed for me and I’ll give it to him myself after he’s rested awhile. You wouldn’t want to disappoint me, now, would you?”
John placed the head of his cock against Sherlock’s hole again and began slowly pressing inward until he was completely sheathed in Sherlock’s tight arse.
“Yes. I forgive you and I’m glad that you won’t remember any of this in the morning. Here. Let’s get you out of these clothes and into bed,” Sebastian said, pulling Moriarty out of the chair by both of his arms.
“Shush,” John said, holding his head then reaching for the water and paracetamol which he was just discovering that he desperately needed.
I know that you’ve been very busy in your new position but I was wondering if you might be available to have tea with me at the coffee shop across the road from Bart’s.
“Yes. He’s a former army surgeon. Very good with his hands. Gentle or rough per the clients requests. You should really ask him to show you his technique.” Irene said, a wicked smile on her lips.
Giving Sherlock a remorseful look, John pulled the script up and flipping to the last page, began to read aloud;
“Don’t be ridiculous. Doctor Watson just asked me how old I was and you know I don’t remember pointless information like that but I know that you do. So…ah…well, I was close,” Sherlock said and disconnected the call without saying anything else.
“Prove it,” Sherlock said. “Let’s go home. I’ll let you take care of this,” he said, nodding down, “there. Ok?”
All of John’s anger quickly drained out of him as he took a good look at Sherlock realizing how pale he was and the grimace of pain on his face and instantly put on his doctor persona.
“I don’t remember seeing those. How could I miss a tray of scones sitting out for three days?” There was a note on top with his name on it. He picked it up and began to read…
“Well, first of all, the body doesn’t belong to you and secondly, Doctor John Watson is the chief coroner at St Bart’s who just happened to be on site when the body was literally dropped at the door. And he hasn’t touched the body until now.”
“Propofol. It was the safest thing to give him to keep him asleep for the three days,” Moran replied.
“This probably isn’t the best place to stand, John. There’s water from the falls all over the walkway. I don’t think that it was meant for guests to use. It’s just for looks.”
For those of you who've waited for over a year for me to finish this, I really appreciate your patience. There were times that I felt that I'd never be able to get back to it but I did and here were are.
“I can assure you, Doctor…John, that I’m not trying to seduce you. If I wanted you in my bed, we’d already be there.”
“I’d like to see today’s total,” Sherlock said while John was fighting with the arm of his coat now caught on the chair rail.
“You’re trying to get me to lose my temper so I’ll make a mistake but it won’t work. I’m very disciplined. You won’t get to me but I’m flattered that you tried.”
“At this moment, that would be you, John. The other victim is deceased, they’re already taken care of at moment.”
John stopped and put his head back and rolled his eyes. Giving an exasperated sigh, he turned back to Sherlock and said;
“That’s what I like to hear,” Becca leaned over, held Irene’s chin in the palm of her hand and kissed her slowly with a promise of things to come later.
“That’s my name, don’t wear it out!” Jim giggled, eyes still closed but with a goofy smile on his face.
“Your member also seems average to me. Honestly, John. I think that you’re obsessed with this…this…I think you’re what I’ve heard called…a ‘size queen.’”
“If he can’t take a little fall like that, he’s no son of mine!” Mr Watson huffed, giving a covert wink and a smile to Harry.
“Given the tone of the previous 24 pages,  That seems sort of…generous, doesn’t it?” John had planned to get Sherlock off anyhow but hadn’t expected an ending where Sherlock any kind of relief after the proceedings. He looked quizzically at Sherlock.
Jim opened his eyes and squinted around the lights to try to take a look at John but gave up when all he could see was glare.
“I don’t doubt it,” John snorted. “Can’t it wait until morning? I’ll be more than willing to help you with your,” he nodded his head in the direction of Sherlock’s lap, “‘experiment’ tomorrow.”
“Ok. Now where was I…oh, yeah! Blue is ‘nila’ and represents the color of Krishna’s face as well as the sky and oceans.
He’d figured that the anger had stemmed from being invalided out from the service but his therapist, Ella, had told him that she felt he had past traumas from childhood that he’d never dealt with. John had just laughed in her face and told her that he was there for the emotional therapy that the military required all injured and decommissioned service members to attend once they’d gone home. He was there to address that one thing and be cleared to leave.
“But. On the banks of the Thames? The smell must have been atrocious at low tide,” Sherlock interrupted.
“Maybe you two just need to take a few days apart. You know. To think it over. You might miss him more than you realize.” Sebastian said, pulling the cart back into the aisle.
“I gave him some pain medication. The incision site is bothering him. It’s one of the opioids with the flavor you enjoy so much.” Moran said, eager to please, as always.
He didn’t want this night to ever end. There was something about this man. He felt as if he’d known him forever. This didn’t feel like business which was worrisome because he had no idea if Sherlock felt the same way. Not that he’d ask!
“OH! John. Why didn’t you just say that in the first place? I don’t care about all of this Alpha/Omega business. I just want John. It doesn’t matter what he is.”
“Have you ever had your arse eaten? I’m assuming not since you haven’t let a cock in there but I could be wrong. Am I?” John asked.
“Oh, god. You look so delicious laying there waiting for me already!” Becca leaned over and gave Irene a lip smacking kiss.
“There’s also…fisting…” John said with a nervous gulp. He’d always wanted to do that but had never mustered up enough courage to ask. He didn’t know how Sherlock would react.
John removed his kerchief from his morning suit and used it to gently wipe the tears away from Sherlock’s eyes.
“Never mind, just briefly breaking the fourth wall to let people know that the writer realizes the “but I’m not gay” trope has been done to death in these fics.”
I'm not thrilled with this chapter. Everything happened as it was supposed to happen, I'm just not happy with the flow. Who knows, I may come back and obsessively tweak it later. I've done that before.
John, you’ve been the best thing that’s ever happened to Sherlock and I know that he wouldn’t be alive today had you two not met. Please take care of him and yourself. I’ll be watching.
“You shouldn’t,” John said, twisting Sherlock’s wrist behind him then pulling his other arm to join it behind his back.
“Very amusing, John. Well, now that you’ve lumbered up the hill, let’s go see the body - again. I’d like to get your reaction.”
“And why would that be, Jim?” Sebastian asked, running the chilled blood under hot water and moving the bag back and forth to spread the warmth around.
“Indeed. None of this is in the least bit normal. I’m well aware of that. I think that we’d make a great team though, John. And you’d have your own room with the option to share my bed at any time. Permanently, if you desired. It’s not like you’d be a prisoner. You can move out of the flat at any time you’d like.” Sherlock looked into John’s eyes anxiously.
Pulling a nearby sterile operating tray next to John, Sebastian began laying out everything that he’d require for the surgery and started opening the sterile packages in which they were enclosed.
“You need, ah hem, should there be more? I would think that the message is pretty clear at this point. I mean, if you’re right and there’s a message to be had in all of…this…,” John gestured vaguely to the flower boxes.
At first I just tried fantasizing about different sexual situations and although that caused my penis to become erect, I was unable to orgasm. It was very frustrating.”
“Yes. I know and I’m sorry but I’m out of my depth here and could really use your help. God forbid that Sherlock Holmes’ mate should die at Jim’s hand. There wouldn’t be any hole deep enough to hide from him.”
“Well, silly secret knocks are usually followed by silly secret handshakes. I was just wondering if you two children had progressed that far in your paranoia.”
“Woah, woah, woah. Tranquilizer, remember?” John said, rushing to Sherlock’s side and wrapping an arm around his waist, steadying him.
In the background, beneath the pillow Mycroft could be heard shouting, “Gregory! I’m coming! I’m coming!” but the two men playing doctor didn’t hear anything but themselves for quite a while.
When they’d exhausted those stories, they began to go further back in time and although it was from four different perspectives, they all had a common theme; sexual assault. They had an uncanny knack for finding men who for whatever reason, wouldn’t or couldn’t report them.
“Or what?” Anderson sneered, placing the palm of his hand on John’s chest, preparing to give him a shove.
“I’ll be right back with those pillows!” Sebastian said, pushing the bar and exiting the morgue quickly.
“Ah! There it goes! Now watch!” Sherlock said, his attention riveted on his still untouched cock which had begun to rapidly thicken.
“It’s no secret; the butler did it. Mycroft knew the butler did it. The butler SAID he did it. The butler ALWAYS does it and I told him so before we’d even arrived. Took one look at the butler’s shoes, proclaimed ‘The butler did it!’ and turned around to get back into the car only to see the taillights disappearing into the foggy gloom as I watched.”
John felt a little more hopeful now that his mother was there and not screaming at him. She wasn’t doing anything about Harry standing on him but she was holding her back from throwing that heavy pot.
“None of that. I want to hear you. How does it make you feel when I do this?” John began kissing Sherlock’s cock, ending with a nip at the corona.
“Please. I want to feel something else besides this heartbreak. Even if it’s only for an hour or two. Please John?” Sherlock looked into his eyes and John knew that he could deny this man nothing.
“John, you know how much I despise repeating myself but I’ll say it again: Is that all? I prefer to, as you say, ‘take it up the arse’ so you’re getting excited over nothing.”
They made love facing each other and kissing for what seemed like forever but was over all too quickly.
Pulling Sherlock’s back against him, and hugging him tightly, pressing his nose against his silky curls. Sherlock leaned his head to the side, exposing his neck which John took as the invitation it was meant to be and began softly pressing kisses down his neck until reaching the juncture where his neck met his shoulder. Here he sucked until a deep pink love bite appeared. John wasn’t normally so possessive of Sherlock but tonight he felt the need to mark his territory. Leave visible evidence the Sherlock was taken. Well taken.
“John is new to this life. So far he’s only been able to tell when I’m around. He doesn’t have the experience and knowledge that we have. That vampire just sat in here, sipping coffee with John, biding his time while spinning his web.”
Following Sherlock, John shut the door quietly behind him and saw that he was lightly touching random objects in the room. The doilies that Mrs Hudson had crocheted to dress up the back of her couch. The light beside her favorite chair that was somehow still on. Clearly, no one had been here since the medics had been called and taken her away.
Lestrade stared between Sherlock and John, sipping his beer like he was watching the most fascinating tennis match ever.
“You’re a bit of a voyeur, aren’t you Mycroft. Are you enjoying this? Listening to me bang your brother while saying your name? This will make for some interesting talk in the conference room, don’t you think? You’re name being mentioned while I shag your brother raw. What will people think? Mycroft…still listening?” John’s mobile chimed and he help onto Sherlock’s hip while he leaned over to answer it putting it on speaker.
I was wonder if you might be available for a late lunch tomorrow. I’m afraid that it will have to be sandwiches at the coffee shop but as you’ve already proved, their food is delicious Tea last month was lovely but rushed. I would like nothing better than to sit down and spend more time with you. Will 2pm work for you?
“Know what for certain?” Sherlock asked as he entered the flat. He studied the placement of both John and Mrs Hudson’s heads and recognized a conspiracy when he saw one.
“I imagine that your first question is about how I could possibly know so much about you. That’s easy; I’ve been waiting for a new coroner to be hired at St Bart’s for months now. The minute that you were hired, I had your background investigated. Although it said nothing of your being a Dhamphir. My brother will hear from me over this lack of critical information.” Sherlock frowned.
Sliding closely behind John, Sherlock spread his legs open entwining first one leg then the other around John’s waist.
“KILL A BEE!! Are you insane?! Where is it?!” Sherlock bellowed dashing towards the windowsill where a bee was buzzing happily in an upside down glass, a playing card beneath the opening.
“Your reaction seems to be a little over the top for an army medical doctor. Seen a lot of action, have you?”
“Best not to,” Sherlock said with a smile, pulling back the top sheet and getting into bed next to John.
Sighing, Sherlock said, “If you insist on interrupting me every time you don’t understand something, this is going to take a considerable amount of time. Time I’m not willing to waste.”
“Well, fuck face? What’s so bloody important that it can’t wait until morning, you insufferable twat?”
“Be careful out there. You never know who or what you might run into, in the dark. It can be dangerous to be on your own at night.”
Sherlock could hear the smile in his voice. His arse already stung and he was beginning to feel the first hint of worry.
“Because I read his file and he’s perfect for you. Definitely has the patience of a saint and lord knows that’s the only way you’ll ever get an Omega,” Mycroft said, his eyebrow raised.
John had paused all activity while he’d been thinking and realized that Sherlock was tense. That was good. He could use that.
“Don’t worry, John. He’d have known that the bees were for me and what this entire gift would mean to me. It IS a gift, isn’t it?”
“You’re actually deigning to call me, brother? To what do I owe the honor?” Mycroft answered condescendingly.
John could smell the cigarette smoke as soon as he opened the front door. Racing up the stairs, he entered the flat, eyes instantly going to Sherlock’s favorite smoking spot but he wasn’t there.
“My pronunciation isn’t the best, and I’m probably saying these wrong but to the best of my recollection…” John began.
“Really, and in, what? Something around 15 hours you know my life story? What riveting piece of information could you possibly have that I don’t already know?”
“Well, the thing about ‘pila’ is,” and here John caught Sherlock’s eye and giving him a triumphant grin, “that it’s the color of knowledge and learning. It symbolizes happiness, meditation, and peace. That sounds like something you’d be interested in, doesn’t it, Sherlock?” John asked, one brow raised.
Reaching into his pocket, Sebastian pulled out a syringe, removed the cap, quickly rid it of any air bubbles and injected John in the area that he’d just cleaned.
“Propofol? Why would I have been given that?” John asked, the pain from the site of the incision making him catch his breath.
“You feel that? You feel me coming inside of you? Making you mine? Come for me, Sherlock. Come. For. Me!” Sherlock’s cock pulsed into John’s palm, once, twice, three times, by the fourth and final time, he felt completely boneless and leaned back against John with a sigh.
Taking Sherlock’s cock in one hand, John guided it slowly into his mouth, enjoying the silky feel of his skin as it moved past his lips, across his tongue until he has taken it in as far as possible.
“Could you please hurry up with your clever deductions? As you can see,” Sherlock gestured towards the commode filled with the remains of his cigarettes, “I’ve been waiting quite a long time for you to return home. You can lecture me later. At the moment, I’m in quite a bit of pain so if you could move it along and use your healing powers, I’d be much obliged.”
“I don’t want to hear it, Sherlock. No one is making you walk me home every night after work. Actually, I’d prefer it if you stopped showing up at all,” John said, picking up his pace a little. The sooner he got home, the sooner he could be rid of Sherlock.
“Yeah. I’m going to probably take a few more sips and then I think I’m going to have to throw in the towel before it burns a hole in my stomach.” John admitted somewhat sheepishly.
They walked down the long hallway, Irene stopping at the third door on the left and giving it a sharp rap. The door was immediately opened by a man with sandy blond hair that had gone completely white in the front. Sherlock sized him up in an instant.
“I’m not saying this is an ideal situation. It’s awful thing for a young Omega such as yourself, to lose your childbearing capabilities but they were able to remove your uterus without major surgery. They were able to save your ovaries…”
“Yeah but there’s always something else to do. I’m just done in tonight. It’ll still be here in the morning and I don’t have anything critical going on at the moment so, yeah, I’m going to leave on time for once,” John said with a laugh.
I really would have liked to have faced you for your first time but we have a problem; you can’t be trusted so, over you go!” John said as he grabbed the wrist and thigh straps, pulled him away from the headboard and pushed him onto his stomach.
“What “relationship?” We haven’t even known each other for more than ten days. I don’t know about your brother but I’m not in a relationship with anyone.”
Kissing his way back up, John stopped to nibble on Sherlock’s ear and neck causing him to moan. John had thought he was hard before but that moan just about did him in and he grabbed his own cock, squeezing it tightly and ordering it to not go off prematurely.
“Nope. Not anymore. I believe that the case has been solved and I’ve had plans for you ever since we walked through the door.” Johns pupils were large and dark and he gave Sherlock the impression of a starving man looking at a steak.
“I’ve never questioned John’s intelligence but this is like a bonus. I want to hear it. Go on, John. What are the colors in Hindi?”
“What was that? I can’t hear you.” Then he ran his hand roughly over Sherlock’s red and swollen cheeks, viciously pinching one.
“Looks like you’re losing in the most injured category. And you cheat! I’m very disappointed in you. Disappointed but very happy.”
Mycroft’s mobile chirped and he took it out of his pocket immediately checking caller ID. “Caller unknown.” He answered.
“On a quick pass I’d say that the foot in his mouth meant that he said something he shouldn’t have and the chicken shears are obvious.”
“That he is so I’ve finally decided to take matters into my own hands and pursue you directly,” Moriarty said, abruptly brushing all of the sugar to the floor.
“Your birth was the result of a vampire - whose identity is unknown because Mycroft is incompetent - raping your mother. Somehow, your mother survived the birth. Then came the decision as to what to do with you.
“Nothing to do with me? I have friends, mum! How long do you think I’ll have them when they find out that my brother's a slag.”
“How do you know she didn’t suffer?! You weren’t here! I wasn’t here! I should have been here. I knew that she was old. She wasn’t going to last forever. I should have known.” Sherlock said, placing his head in his hands and beginning to sob quietly. John’s heart was breaking for him and he didn’t know what to do about it. It was different when Sherlock had “died.” He’d committed “suicide” in front of John but he’d come back, eventually. Mrs Hudson wasn’t coming back. Sherlock had been in despair. Obviously the suicide was faked but the despair was real. John heard it in his voice that day. Sherlock hadn’t even been 34 when he’d jumped. John still had nightmares about it.
“No. Sooner or later someone would find out and then the gossip would be everywhere with people talking behind my back wanting to know why I got special treatment. Making snide remarks as I passed by. I don’t need the money that badly to put up with that kind of shite.”
John nodded, clearly not believing a word of what this maniac was telling him. His mother was no longer alive and his father and Harriet avoided speaking with him at all costs, which was fine with him, so he guessed that he’d just have to bite the bullet and talk to his sister, Harriet. Just out of curiosity and not because any of this fantasy could possibly be true.
“Um, that’s ok.” Was this that Moriarty character that Sherlock had warned him about? Pretty ballsy to try and pick him up right at the entrance of St Bart’s.
John skimmed to the bottom of the page and read, “‘The End.’” That’s it. Oh, wait. There’s a post script at the bottom in small print.” John squinted at it trying to make it out.
“I see that you’ve already begun the autopsy. Shouldn’t the body have been checked for evidence, blood samples, etc, before you began cutting it up? I don’t see the Forensic Pathologist around to take care of all of the work necessary to prepare the body to be examined.” Sherlock said with the attitude of someone who thinks they’ve caught someone in a mistake.
Sebastian closed Jim’s door and leaned his back against it followed by knocking his head against it a few times for good measure too.
Using the palm of his hands, Sherlock stopped John and pushed him away until his cock slid out of his mouth.
Four men had been found murdered in as many weeks; throats torn out and almost completely drained of blood. While draining a body of blood was a bit…unusual, it had occurred before so it wasn’t unheard of. However, the difference here was the fact that the victims appeared to have been killed in situ - it wasn’t a body dump. That and each victim had died with a distinctly happy, almost post-coital smile on their face.
“Much.” They smiled and followed each other down the fire escape and into Sherlock’s room where the bed was big, the pillows fluffy, and the hearts were light.
“What in god’s name is your brother involved in that he follows you so closely? He’s not mobbed up, is he?”
The chauffeur had gotten out of the car and opened the door so that Mycroft and John could enter. The door closed behind them and John turned to Mycroft and asked;
Moran set about adding an IV bag to the Port in John’s chest. Hanging the bag on the nearby pole, he patted John’s shoulder saying;
Forty years ago, record keeping wasn’t automated and Harriet had had the baby in a Catholic hospital which was scandalous enough for an unmarried woman. So when it came time to sign the birth certificate, everyone looked the other way as Bob and Elizabeth signed their names and ages to it. Not one person questioned it. That’s how these things were handled, after all.
“Thanks. I was dated this Indian bird once and she taught me all about Holi. We went to market and there were open sacks of colorful powders and she told me what each one meant only she didn’t say them in English so I also learned the name of the colors in Hindi as well. Some stuff just sticks with you, I guess.”
“That was easy. I just told each one independent of the others, that they were the best I’d ever had. That I’d suck their cocks for free if they promised not to tell the others. Easy. I told them that if they spilled the secret, no more blow jobs from me in private OR the at the brothel. They readily agreed. It fed into their belief that they were somehow better than other people, including each other.”
And so John and St Bart’s were both satisfied with his addition to the department. John was especially grateful that, with the exception of the Forensic Pathologist, Molly Hooper, he had the autopsy room all to himself. He found it difficult to maintain the facade of being happy go lucky John Watson for long periods of time so the less time spent with people the better.
“I…don’t know, Sherlock. I’m just trying to find a polite way of saying that you’re not putting that monster cock up my arse.”
“Well, what do expect? Without meds, I’m not going to improve. And here the Mistress keeps going on and on about how smart you are. If you weren’t a man and a passing fancy of something unobtainable, I might be forced to slice up that beautiful face of yours,” Becca said, showing the scalpel she held in one hand.
He was about to stand and begin gathering everything to get dressed when Sherlock reached over and pulled him back down into a sitting position on the side of the bed.
Treading lightly up the 17 stairs, she put a hand out, grabbed the doorknob, took a deep breath and went inside.
I knew that would hold them for a bit but that their egos wouldn’t let them keep that score to themselves for long. Criminals always think that they’re smarter than everyone else. Each thought that they could get the rest to keep the secret and I’d never find out. So I added a little glamor for insurance using their egos against them. They were more than happy and smug to have something that the others hadn’t. As each one died, they’d come to me cry the entire time that I was blowing them. I probably would have spread the killings out over a longer period of time if I hadn’t become angrier with each meeting. They sickened me and I couldn’t wait for it to be over.”
“I’m not psychic. Read it out loud and I’ll pull the appropriate items from the box. Now, Sherlock.”
Giving a cursory glance at the baby, Bob turned his head away only to immediately turn around giving the baby a second look.
“If I know Jim, and I do, he’ll all but killed out poor Doctor Watson and I can’t have Sherlock broken like that. I’m not sure he could live without that man and I just heard of him,” Irene finished.
In the morning, they’d discuss Sherlock leaving the wet flannels in the middle of the bed ending with them both waking up on the wet spot before John realized what had happened.
“Always,” said Greg. Reaching into his other pocket, he brought out bottled water and put that in John’s good hand.
Mycroft nodded in the direction of the staircase where a slightly disheveled John and Sherlock were making their way to the exit.
“Just, go lay face down on the bed. Put this towel beneath you to catch any blood,” John said, pulling a towel off the rack and handing it to Sherlock.
Becca held her hand out to Sebastian who looked at it in puzzlement before reaching out to shake it. Becca quickly pulled her hand back.
“Please. I just need to see him. I can’t have my last image be of his broken body laying at the bottom of the staircase while he lost the baby. Please?”
Between the sucking and stroking, Sherlock couldn’t hold on any longer, spending himself on his stomach with a satisfied sigh.
Sliding another finger in, he pumped Sherlock’s hole several times until Sherlock set his own rhythm, fucking John’s mouth and on the withdrawal, fucking John’s fingers.
“I’m going to fuck you again, right now. How does that sound?” John asked, looking into Sherlock’s eyes and holding his gaze.
“Really?” John asked, curling his fingers against Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock moaned and pressed his cock against the duvet.
“Well, he would be wouldn’t he, being 15 years younger after all. For a lazy man, he has amazing stamina,” Lestrade replied not offended.
John eased his hand into Sherlock’s trouser pocket until he’d found the head of his cock. Well, yes. That was an impressive hard on alright.
“That’s a fairly brief summary of what my psych eval said on my exit interview at University. So sad about that professor and his paperwork. Everything went up in flames and of course the students were so distraught by his horrible death that they passed everyone’s psychological evaluation.  No proof that says I’m not qualified to get my medical degree. Easy peasey. That poor professor though. Yikes!”
Clients weren’t declined often and had, so far, had no effect to her establishment’s reputation or her bottom line. So long as everyone paid for their rooms as well as a percentage of their income per client, her employees were pretty much left to their own devices. She wasn’t a pimp and should someone compare her to one, even in jest, they were no longer a customer. She was a business woman and sex sells. That was a fact.
“Right. Well, anyhow, for Jim, narcotics are his choice of salt. They make Dhamphir blood even yummier. And, well, one thing led to another and even though Jim knew that John was very low on blood, he injected him with more narcotics and John’s heart stopped. Wait!” Becca said. “He’s fine now. Moriarty’s assistant arrived just in time to revive him and setup two full bore IVs with blood to, you know, top John off, as it were. He’s almost fine now. Will be fine.” Becca patted his hand. Becca was giving Moron credit for all this but she was fine with that. It was better that Sherlock not know that not only had she been there but that John was lucky she’d shown up. She was certain he’d have been dead otherwise. Those idiots.
“Never!” Sherlock burst up, using his forearms to force John to let him go. He then flipped him over and John now found himself pinned to the floor. He was grinning.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about and stop interrupting me or this is going to take forever.” Sherlock said, irritated.
“All I care about right now is that I’M the boss in this relationship. Come on.” John reached up and proceeded to pull Sherlock along by the collar until he finally gave up resisting and went willingly, albeit reluctantly, cooperating.
“I’m not sure about that,” Sherlock said, voice muffled by the collar of his robe that had slipped down to cover his head.
Reducing his feeding to a slow trickle, John began grinding his cock agains the mattress, simultaneously stroking Sherlock with his free hand.
“That’s what I thought. Tah, darling. Try not to kill John,” Becca said, closing the door behind her.
“That’s very amusing. I guess we know who the boss is in that relationship.” Sherlock said with a smirk.
Many members of this group weren’t actually gay - or so they told themselves - and mainly went to be seen and get a blowjob under the ‘all cats are grey in the dark’ system as well as maintaining their ‘cover.’ Sherlock despised posers so the victims had already started out with one strike against them.
Although laying down flat had made the pain worse at first, the dizziness that followed hit John full force and he felt that he might vomit. The pain was wearing him out, he could feel a certain kind of lassitude falling over him. He couldn’t move on his own if he had to.
“I’m sorry, it’s just that I’m exhausted and all I want to do is turn in. Could we please do this in the morning?” Now he felt guilty about putting Sherlock off. John knew that if Sherlock decided to press his case, he’d would drag his tired arse over to where he was sitting and dutifully listen while Sherlock droned on and on about the latest type of fuzz he’d discovered. It was complete and utter shite, is what it was. He was a pushover where Sherlock was concerned.
“…however, I see no reason to do so. Not to mention the fact that I suspect that Doctor Watson would be quite vocal and uncooperative regarding a shift change made for - what would seem to him - no justifiable reason. I can’t very well tell the Board that Doctor Watson must have daylight hours in order to avoid being taken by vampires. Use that brilliant mind of yours and try being reasonable - for a change. In any event, I have agents watching Bart’s. I have agents watching his flat. I have agents following him to and from those locations. I even have agents watching the pub he frequents and since your flat is constantly being monitored, the good doctor’s trips there - of which there has been exactly one - are also being monitored. I assure you that he is being well protected.”
I feel very awkward accepting such an expensive gift but you’re right; there’s nothing like it here and it will be very useful in monitoring my patients stats electronically. Thank you for the gift.
“We’re on page 15, I believe. Read the prop list so that I can make sure that we have everything for the scene.”
“And the red that’s on his hands is a symbol of passion and fertility. I’m guessing that the victim might have been having an affair with the murderer’s significant other.”
“So, it’s hospital for you next time? Got it.” John smiled as he cleaned the few things he’d used to work on Sherlock’s back.
“No,” Sherlock said quickly. “He doesn’t need a hospital. Nothing’s broken. I can take much better care of him than some overworked, undereducated A & E physician and he’ll have the benefit of my undivided attention.”
“Sherlock, this is John Watson. I’m sure that you’ll have a pleasurable night. Champagne is on the house, a chilled bottle is being sent up as we speak. Enjoy yourselves gentlemen,” she said, turning to leave.
“Why? This is going to be good. A test of wills and all that. My money’s on Watson. Hey! Ow! That’s going to leave a mark!” Mycroft said, rubbing his bicep.
Unzipping the bag, Sebastian started at John’s feet until he’d been completely slipped into the bag. John hadn’t even moved a muscle. It seemed pointless. He’d just bide his time until he could escape or until Sherlock found him.
“Well, if they’re so bad, why is there a pack always hidden somewhere in the flat?” Sherlock asked logically, squinting his eyes as it was now beginning to feel like his back was on fire.
“I’m just going to help you wash your back. It’s very messy,” Sherlock said, trying his best to look innocent.
“I wasn’t kidding, Doctor Watson. Hurt my brother in any way and you’ll be dead by morning. And it won’t be an easy or quick death. I’ll personally see to it.”
“I’ll be there in 20. That’s the best I can do so I suggest you keep him warm and alive while you’re waiting for me. Oh. I’m assuming that you have blood and a blood warmer.”
“Besides, there are no rules about sexuality when it comes to vampires and Dhamphirs. Your Soul Mate is your Soul Mate so you just need to stop acting like a child and get over it.”
“I can assure you that he did not. He’s been going on instinct rather than intellect. He’ll consider it a weakness of his transport - and he’d be right. He’ll hate that. I can’t wait to tell him,” Mycroft said, smirking.
“You two should be ashamed of yourselves! Do you know how important bees are to the environment? Charles the Second’s Royal Beekeeper once said; "A Bee is an exquisite Chemist" and no truer words have ever been spoken!”
Sherlock had said all of that, not looking up from his lap once. What the hell was he…”Christ! Why is your cock out? More importantly, why is it rock hard? Have you been masturbating all day? Is THAT the great achievement because, I hate to break it to you but you’ve enough experience to turn pro at this point. In fact, you could teach a course. You took to jerking off like a duck to water.”
“Ivy is not plain. It symbolizes fidelity. Ivy is deceptively strong; once it’s attached itself to something it won’t easily let go. Reminds me of someone.”
"Oh. Right. Not very sanitary. Sorry, dear." Mrs Hudson said, bustling over the table and setting the biscuits down. She made it to the front door to the flat, pausing on the threshold.
“Your ovaries will keep producing the hormones necessary to cause you to go into heat and create lubrication for easier…”
“Not exactly. My partner is pressuring me to move in with him but we haven’t been seeing each for long so…”
“It’s easy to tell who the ‘man’ in this relationship is! Here’s a hint: It’s not you! All you’re good for is playing doctor and sucking his cock!”
“You know I’d never have called you unless it was an emergency,” Sebastian said anxiously, looking down at John.
Bringing the tubing up to his lips again and taking another deep swallow of John’s blood, Moriarty said;
“Harriet. Use your mobile and call emergency services.  I think that John’s losing the baby! He’s hemorrhaging!”
Reaching inside, John slowly withdrew Sherlock’s cock from his trousers. Sherlock gave a sharp intake of breath as the cold air touched his cock.
“Wait. Why? You haven’t won the bet. You’re unlikely to win the bet. Don’t get overconfident. You’re only setting yourself up for disappointment.”
“I can see why Mistress wants you so badly. Now, get on the bed and I’ll tell you a story. It’s all about John and what that mean old man, Moriarty, has been doing to him.”
“Taking off my clothes, unless you’d rather I fuck you whilst wearing them. I wouldn’t recommend that for a first time though.” John waited to see if Sherlock would say anything but he just remained stubbornly silent so he continued removing his clothes until he was completely naked.
“Yes, you do. Me doctor, you…henchman. Now go away so I can finish with this and get back to Irene.”
“It’s just a little deeper than I thought. All that means is that I won’t be able to make the shallow cuts that I’d planned. And you’ll need stitches. That’s all.”
“It’s true. I saw the pee stick myself. He’s pregnant and here’s what else I found out: he doesn’t even know who the father is!” Harry waited for the explosion and wasn’t disappointed.
John and Sherlock each took an unplanned step towards the other until the were suddenly in each other’s arms, placing passionate kisses over every bare patch of skin ending with their lips.
“Baby cakes! You know I’m here for you! I’ll be right over. Blow job when I get there? My treat. Mycroft. Mycroft?” Becca looked at Irene who was rolling around on the bed laughing.
“Don’t you want to talk about where you’ve been for the past week? How was that hush hush job that you were working on for Mycroft?”
“I know, da. John’s always been such a disappointment. I do have an idea though, if you’re interested…” Harriet said placing her hand on her father’s arm and giving him her patented (only worked on her father) sweet and innocent look.
Sherlock looked up again. Did…yes, Watson was closer now and Sherlock hadn’t seen him move. That was…disturbing. How could he have missed that?
“Oh, this is marvelous! I do love a good threat. Sit down, NOW!” Moriarty demanded. Sherlock reluctantly complied.
“Exactly. I will not be penetrated willingly. You will have to take me against my will and, I’m sorry, but I don’t have much faith in your ability to get the job done.”
He’d hitched a ride with Lestrade back to the hospital who’d dropped him off at the door assuming that John was just going in to make sure that the body was stored properly so that he could begin examining it after he’d had some sleep. But John had no intention of going home. What for? It’s not like he had anything better to do or that he was able to sleep for more than an hour at a time anyway, so he just followed the med techs as they wheeled the body into the morgue and placed it on the table.
“It says, “I knew that you always wanted to try this but had been too shy to ask so I decided to put a little play together for you. Happy Birthday, John. You mean the world to me and I love you with all of my heart. — Sherlock”
“Becca,” Irene placated. “You know that my heart and…other bits, belong only to you. Still, a three way? Four way if Doctor Watson insists,” Irene said, semi-seriously.
John reached in front of Sherlock to pull the loosely tied sash of his robe through the loops with a flourish.
“Don’t worry about it. You good for it,” said John, following through with original attack and forcing Sherlock down on his back.
“Don’t try to figure him out, dumpling. It’ll only give you a headache. From what I gathered from your side of the conversation, you’re going to need enough drugs to keep Sherlock out for at least two days? He’s going to be really mad.”
“Do you have anyone out front in the waiting room who would like to see the baby?” The nurse asked, trying to remain calm but her forced cheerfulness was starting to crack around the edges.
John ran his hand down Sherlock’s back and, upon reaching his tense arse, pinched it between his thumb and forefinger firmly.
“That’s Sherlock. Only focused on what he’s interested in and that murderer was all he was thinking about. I apologize on his behalf. I’ll send him round to apologize properly, if you’ll give me your address.”
“Just give me one chance and if you get hurt in any way, you can quit and I won’t bother you again.”
“I only had hot water to warm it up and I was afraid that it would clot if I tried to heat it in the microwave,” Sebastian said nervously.
“When? When does it get better, John? Truly, this is awful. I want her back so much and she’s gone. She’s gone and I wasn’t even here when you found her.” Sherlock sobbed.
“It’s just a cuddle. A cuddle never hurt anyone,” John said, hooking his index fingers into Sherlock’s belt loops.
“A little although the pain hasn’t really improved, just shifted. It’s the dizziness that won’t stop; I feel like I’m about to pass out,” John said through gritted teeth, not opening his eyes.
“Wait,” John held out his jacket. He couldn’t wear it now so he just folded it in half and hung it over his forearm.
“It just feels awkward mentioning it now…” Mike seemed to suddenly have trouble meeting John’s gaze.
“I wanted you to fuck me in public. No warning. No prep. No…uh…ohhhh…request…just…thissssssss….” Sherlock sighed.
I hear that congratulations are in order. Can we expect a happy announcement some time in the near future?
Sebastian made the cut and then began feeding the catheter through the vein towards John’s heart. Pausing, he looked John in the eyes and said;
John stalked back to Sherlock, grabbed the sleeve of his coat and twisted his arm behind his back, pushing him towards the exit.
“I swear to god, if you start singing ‘American Pie’ I won’t be responsible for the beating you’re going to get.” John said, annoyed anew.
“It’s not supposed to be enjoyable for you. You’re not being submissive so much as subsumed by my character’s need to abuse you.” John removed his hand and sat back waiting for Sherlock to say something. Anything.
“You’re very talkative for someone I’ve glamoured. Usually the person doesn’t care about things like facts or their work and they’re never so animated during a consultation. I wish that I could let you remember all of this but I can’t take the risk of being locked up in a small prison cell. I’d go insane.”
“What’s the problem then? We’ve participated in each other’s fantasies before and most times they’ve been quite…invigorating.”
Sherlock could have made more of an effort to procure what he wanted but it was just too much bother. And so he lay on his couch in 221b and thought up new and clever insults to throw at his brother the next time he decided to step his fat foot over the threshold.
Eventually, daddy developed a temper. He went to work angry and came home later and later, smelling funny. The one thing that John knew was not to get his father's attention. He’d been beaten with a belt several times and on other occasions, the wooden cutting board because it was the closest thing to hand. John was black and blue constantly and no one questioned how it had happened anymore. It became ‘normal’.
“That’s too bad. Could have been fun,” John said, opening the front of Sherlock’s coat and sliding his hands around his waist.
“How lovely for you,” John said, getting his wallet out and throwing a few pounds on the table for the coffee and the breakfast that had yet to come.
“Well, that would have been useful three weeks ago. Bollocks to those ridiculous gifts. I want John to take me seriously. I know exactly what to get for him.”
“Don’t bother calling the cops. They’re all in cahoots. Hah! Funny word. “Cahoots”,” John laughed as Sherlock finally got him into a standing position.
“Oh, and look how dedicated he is. Sorry, doc, this is the one that got away but by all means, give it your best shot,” Jim said, laughing again.
“I’ve had Mycroft looking for an assistant for me with a medical background and a willingness to put himself into dangerous situations. Clearly you enjoy danger. After all, you went to a pub with someone who was basically a stranger and then agreed to follow someone whom I believe you called a “maniac,” around. And even after all the irritation, you still came back to my flat with me.”
“Please, John. Fuck me with your fist. I want it. I need it. OOH! FUCK!!” Sherlock suddenly exclaimed as John unceremoniously thrust his fist into Sherlock’s rectum.
“Are you safe wording out? I won’t force myself on you outside of the game. Are you done then?” John asked, feeling incredibly disappointed for some reason.
“And he’s walking around with an umbrella on a perfectly clear night. You ask me, there’s something wrong with him.”
Sherlock walked back to John who had succeeded in detaching his sleeve from the chair but his coat was still over the back of said chair which was being dragged with him every time he tried to move.
“Indeed. Unless there’s a sign saying ‘He did it’ and pointing at the culprit, the NSY couldn’t detect their way out of a wet paper bag with a razor blade.”
He needed to get to John. Warn him. Convince him to move into 221B. Whatever it took. No one was going to touch John Watson. No one but him.
But finally! A case! Not just any case either. A case worthy of Sherlock’s time and intellect. The corner of his mouth pulled up, a smile almost, but not quite, lighting his eyes. The average person would never recognize it as such. It was better described as a smirk that a shark would give you. Right before they ate you. If sharks could smirk, that is.
“Oh. There’s a saying that goes something along the lines of ‘A stiff prick has no conscience. Now if you wouldn’t mind. The clock’s ticking and all.”
“Yes. I’d like that but I’m working on this case,” Sherlock replied as if this was a normal conversation. He tried to stop answering John’s questions but it was almost as if he was compelled to not only answer, but answer honestly. Nothing good could come of this.
“I wish you’d let me have my way with you, Sherlock. I know that I could satisfy you. Let me know if you change your mind,” she added before he could reject her again.
The kitchen was quiet for a moment, the only sounds were newspaper pages being turned and tea being sipped.
“What else do you see, Doctor Watson?” Sherlock asked, now truly curious. Maybe this Dhamphir knew what he was talking about although it was obvious from his reactions that he seemed to be unaware of the fact that he was, albeit a young one, clearly a Dhamphir. Curious.
Wearing bells is just a figure of speech meaning that I’m excited to see you again. Unless you request it, I will not be wearing bells.
“Um…I don’t know what you had planned but I can assure you that I’m not interested. Not that you’re not an attractive man but I’m not gay,” John said.
Mycroft needed to get to John lest Sherlock wakeup before he’d gotten him back. And it wasn’t like he didn’t care about John - he cared, a little. If Sherlock woke up and still didn’t have John, there’d be hell to pay.
“At first they were unhappy because his contract is  Oral Sex Only. You can imagine how well that news was received.”
“God fucking dammit, John!” Sherlock stopped to lean against a damp brick wall, hand pressed firmly against his groin.
He didn’t open the door completely; just enough to squeeze himself through the narrow opening he’d made. Why he thought that would make a difference, he didn’t know.
“As part the British government, he keeps a tight grip on my whereabouts at any given moment. Wouldn’t want me to embarrass him…I’ll understand if you’ve changed your mind. I don’t want to be around him either but I can’t seem to escape.” Sherlock said bitterly.
‘John Watson, you, my friend, are a complete and utter moron with no sense of self preservation,’ he thought to himself.
“I could easily get to your brother - if he wasn’t surrounded by so many body guards. Clever man. And he’s very serious about his vetting process. Oh, I could eventually get past all that but why bother when you’re the one that I really want and you have absolutely no protection.”
“So. That’s it, then? I’m stuck with Sherlock whether I like it or not? And I’m stuck with your goons following my every move?” John demanded.
The woman turned her head towards the nurse and gave her such an angry glare that the nurse actually stepped back a few feet.
“I wanted to tell you that if you touch my anus again anytime in the near future, you’ll be left with a hand that will be functionally useless,” Sherlock finished.
“That only happens when two people haven’t been able to find their true Soul Mate and settle for friendship. I already have a Soul Mate, and I don’t have, want or need friends. If that’s all, I have better things to do than talking to a half crazed vampire.” Sherlock stood up to leave.
Sherlock was curious but feigned disinterest. What could this man possibly have on John that he didn’t already know.
He was also simultaneously hoping that Sherlock would be out there just so that he could administer a well deserved arse kicking but kept that dark thought pushed down without examining it too closely. Conversely, he also hoped that Sherlock hadn’t listened to him and had come anyhow. As much as he hated to admit it, he looked forward to their nightly walks. There was something about being surrounded by the dark and walking home in companionable (if he was lucky) silence with someone that he enjoyed. He really did care about Sherlock. They’d had this almost instant connection and John admitted to himself that it actually felt good. Not that he’d tell Sherlock that. Hopefully, they’d be able to work this out before either one or both of them were sectioned.
Sliding against as close as possible until he was testicles to testicles with John he began pressing in slowly, as deeply as possible, leisurely fucking John and making sure that he rubbed against John’s prostate with the head of his cock on every other thrust. John lifted his left leg a little higher and thrust down on Sherlock’s cock.
Sherlock pressed his hips against John’s and could feel his arousal. He slid his clothed cock against John’s who was quickly wondering what was so wrong with being gay.
“Right. Of course you were because you’re a sneaky bastard and didn’t want to get caught with the evidence.”
“Ooh. Look at Sherlock’s tense shoulders! The doctor seems to be angry too! Just look at the red face and his readiness to throw a punch! It’d be a bonus if they get into a physical altercation…” said Jim only to be disappointed when they both knelt down and began looking at the body.
“You’ve hidden it here somewhere and I’m going to find it, my lovable menace.” John commenced looking under the bed. Between the mattress and boxspring; there were only so many places that Sherlock could have hidden it before John had gotten him into bed.
“Well, first of all, one of the stage directions is to force you face down on the floor and enter you all in one push,” John waited.
Sherlock felt a soft touch on his hip and saw that John had placed his hand there. He was in Sherlock’s personal space now and how had THAT happened? Why hadn’t he caught that?
“I don’t need people. I never have and so when you were all but dropped into my lap. At first, it didn’t seem remotely possible that despite how I felt, you might be my Soul Mate so I went onto the internet to find out what that meant.”
John ran his hand down the back of Sherlock’s coat until he’d reached the split at the bottom. Sliding inside, he moved his hand over Sherlock’s firm arse to his sharp hipbone searching for…ah! There it was!
“No. Only a male vampire mating with a human woman can do that. And a vampire can only be created by another vampire by draining that person’s blood and then letting that person feed from them.”
“I’m nobody. I don’t require protection or we wouldn’t be here alone, casually drinking coffee in the middle of the night with no other patrons.”
“Well, that was quite a fall he took. How did it happen?” The doctor asked, looking at Mr Watson who instantly replied;
“Sherlock, Mrs Hudson knew that you cared about her. She knew and accepted you for the arse that you are,” John said, eliciting the slight smile that he was going for.
Sherlock looked up through his curls and said, “Are you sure, John? I hate to beat a dead horse but I had stroke of genius and finally discovered what I was missing. I’ve had the experiment in hand ever since,” Sherlock said, a slight quirk to his lips.
Sherlock slept on, oblivious to the problems of Neely and the rest. It all looked very domestic. Sherlock would have hated it. And Mycroft? Well, Mycroft might have enjoyed seeing Becca again although he’d never admit it.
“Well, what if I don’t want to live with your brother? Will I die from a broken heart? We live in the same city. That’s close enough. I’ll see him in the morgue a lot now that he’s no longer hiding from me.”
“Then there’s the Bellis Prennis or common daisy. Its color, red, meaning love and romance.” Sherlock continued trailing his fingers along the flowers as if cataloging them and perhaps he was.
“Yes. Mycroft can be repetitive. Just ignore him. Most of what he says is nonsense anyway.” Sherlock replied, his mobile chiming immediately. He threw it down on his jacket.
Sherlock stretched luxuriously, arranging himself on the bed properly, taking John’s hand and pulling him into the bed with him.
“That was completely unintentional, truly. Ok, get closer. You need to almost be on top of me to completely appreciate the…I did it again right there, didn’t I?”
John withdrew from Sherlock and removed a handkerchief from his pocket, wiping his hands off and then putting the soiled material back in his pocket.
“Don’t tell me that you’re having second thoughts? I thought we’d resolved all that last night,” Sherlock said, lightly sniffing at John’s neck where his pulse was rapidly picking up speed.
“Yes. Fine. Whatever. John?” Sherlock didn’t wait to see if John was following. He was in too much agony at this point and he just wanted to get home and take care of…this.
“NO!” John said, stomping to the door to the flat, slamming it so hard that the panes of glass rattled in their frames.
Setting her purse on the nearest table top, Becca came over and checking the almost empty pint of blood, drew her hand back immediately as if she’d been burned.
“Yes. Honestly, the last employee only followed through because he’d dared number four to give it a go. Unfortunately, his trade was that, should number four be unsuccessful, he was up next. Not negotiable.”
“Oh. Oh. Of course. I don’t really think of the plant at all.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John but continued his list.
“Don’t think that that sad voice is going to work on me!” John said as he entered the loo and walked into a wall of smoke to find Sherlock sitting on the side of the tub, chain smoking. The commode seat up and filled with cigarette butts.
“The freak shot you?!” Sally said a little too gleefully if John was any judge and right now he probably wasn’t the best judge of anything.
Irene herself rarely took a client unless there was something about them that she found irresistible. And even then, she only entertained women now. She’d done her time pandering to male vanity while coming up in the business and once she’d started to feel resentful and bitter, she’d stopped seeing men altogether. But Sherlock? He was different. It didn’t hurt that he was androgynous, beautiful, and sexy as hell. She found him irresistible but the feeling, other than a mutual respect - he appreciated her as an intellectual equal - were not returned. His tendencies didn’t lean that way and there was nothing that would persuade him otherwise. And she’d really tried. Pity.
Suddenly, without further warning, John plunged his fangs into Sherlock’s femoral artery, drinking deeply.
“None will be given. Ready?” And John sprang into action, kicking Sherlock’s feet from underneath him and pinning him to the floor.
- The first step in wooing your Omega is to start small. Omegas are easily startled and shouldn’t be overwhelmed with extravagant gifts.
John turned around to find that Sherlock had changed into pajamas and what looked to be a satin robe.
“I don’t want to see you at St Bart’s tomorrow night. If you’re there when I come out. It’s over.” John said.
John stopped stirring, carefully set his spoon on the saucer and looked at Sherlock. Really looked and realized that Sherlock believed this load of horseshit. Great. He finally meets someone he gets along with and he’s insane.
After a slight struggle between John trying to stop sucking and Sherlock refusing to let him go, John was able to pull his mouth off of Sherlock with a pop.
He walked around, looking at the titles on the books, killing time while Sherlock had gone into his bedroom for…what he didn’t know.
“Lorazepam. Roll up your sleeve.” John said, walking towards the chair then getting on his knees before Sherlock.
“Yes! God, yes! John. Anything. Anything you want!’ Sherlock gasped out. “Just, fuck me some more, please?” Sherlock asked, wiggling his hips for emphasis.
“Nope. They’re so sure that Watson was gone that they pulled surveillance late last night. I just went into the empty lab tonight, opened the drawer, zipped the bag up and rolled him right out of there. Not one person stopped me to ask a question. I was concerned that I might run into someone who knew that I was supposed to be on vacation but nope, not another soul around,” Sebastian said with a grin.
“Did you know this bloke before? Gone out with him before? No one becomes this attached to someone they’ve never even met before,” John asked, surprised to find that he was jealous.
John became an excellent doctor and surgeon eventually rising to the rank of Captain. He was very popular amongst the other troop members. They’d lay down their lives for him. People actually respected him. Asked for and cared about his opinion. He’d finally found a place where he fit in perfectly. It was the happiest he’d ever been in his life.
He’d tried to figure out what made Lawrence so special. Everyone doted on him. Even when he did things like throw his toys or knock his plate of food off of the table, they just laughed and said “oh, you!” And proceeded to clean up after him. Lawrence was never held accountable for any of the things he did and John couldn’t understand why.
“You were waiting for five minutes. I’d planned on addressing you if you made it through minute nine but, well…”
“Let’s move against the far wall between those crates. If someone is watching, the most they’ll be able to see will be our heads and shoulders. Come on.” John began walking backwards across the alley, tugging Sherlock along by his belt loops.
Opening the file and giving the contents a cursory glance, Sherlock closed the folder and pushed it back across the table.
“I’m afraid that’s unacceptable, John,” Sherlock said, trying to pull John’s legs apart at which he was only slightly successful. John’s cock wasn’t even remotely interested in the proceedings!
“Sherlock. Don’t start that…” Lestrade said wearily, as if they’d been over this thousands of times before - which they had.
“You’re probably right. I didn’t even realize that this was a long weekend. I would have probably shown up right on time Monday evening and then been cross with myself for not paying attention. Thanks for that and thank you for the coffee,” John said, saluting Sebastian with his cup before taking a sip. Vending machine coffee was horrible but it made their impromptu chats a bit more comfortable while getting to know each other.
Taking a minute to survey the damage, Mrs Hudson gave Sherlock a stern look and said, “ You know that you’re not supposed to smoke. It’s bad for your health.” She admonished.
“I hate that stuff. It doesn’t work on me anyhow,” Sherlock whined sounding a little like his old self.
“Oh, yes. I know. He can’t be let loose on the general population when he’s worried about John. We already know where John is and I hear that the paramedics are there now getting him ready for transport. Your delicious DI Lestrade is there too.” Irene said knowingly.
“That’s nothing compared to what I’m going to do to him! I’m going to beat that bastard right out of him!”
“Someone did their research. Chrysanthemums. Bees don’t really care for them but they repel insects which keeps the other plants safe. See how there are several strategically placed amongst the wooden beds? All red. Interesting. I wonder if that means anything…” Sherlock paused as if waiting for John to say something but was met only with silence so he continued.
“Are they very different because, if not, I’ll just keep it. No big deal.” John said, taking another sip and shuddering.
And Sherlock closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep while Becca picked up the book she’d brought then threw it across the room. Oh no, I only bottom for the Mistress. I’d kick Christian’s ass so hard, he’d be spitting shoe leather for weeks. Let’s see what John has to read because I know that Sherlock only has dusty old tomes.”
“You know, you really do have the most perfect arse,” John said, running a hand lightly over Sherlock’s plump left cheek.
“If you insist,” Sherlock stepped up his game paying particular attention to working John’s prostate on the downstroke of Sherlock’s hand on his penis.
“That’s more like it. See how easy that was? Well, go on. Get moving. Jackie boy doesn’t have all day, you know,” Jim said, laughing at his own comment.
“No,” John said again, “We’re finishing it right now. You wouldn’t want to skew the data by not seeing this through to the end now, would you?”
Mycroft, making a show of lifting the pocket watch chained to his vest, popped the cover open, glanced at the time before closing it with an audible snap and arranging it neatly from whence it came.
I knew that. I was trying to be humorous and failing miserably. Can’t wait to see you Friday night. XOXO
“God! Fine. I’m sorry that I ran into you in a place where you shouldn’t have been in the first place. Supposedly re-injured your already injured shoulder which seems to have been miraculously cured, by the way. And now you require an infantile apology rather than assist on a murder case where the victim is only getting colder by the minute. How’s that? Does that satisfy your delicate sensibilities.”
Everything had been taken away from him in less than a second by a bullet that had left shrapnel behind destroying so much bone and tissue that they’d had to leave some of the metal inside of him or risk decreasing his already limited mobility. It was hoped that physical therapy could offer him some improvement and less pain. John wasn’t optimistic but then, he usually wasn’t…anymore.
“I’ve been waiting for you to wake up for hours. Even after your IV was disconnected, you slept on. You were exhausted.”
“‘Is that all’?” That’s a big deal to me. That’s my final frontier. You might even say that I’m a virgin.”
“You did say that. Well, I guess there’s no harm in telling you since you won’t remember any of this anyhow;
“Uh huh. So…you’re one of these ‘Dhamphirs’ then?” John asked, trying to keep a straight face as he stirred his coffee.
“The boss doesn’t know how long he’s going to keep you and frankly, he loves Dhamphir blood so I’m basically installing a tap so that he can drink directly from the source. Don’t worry, I can perform this procedure in about 20 minutes. I’ve had plenty of experience. You’ll be fine.
“I don’t need to look at you to talk to you, John. I need to have one more orgasm tonight and then I’ll be satisfied.”
“I’d hate to have to kill you but I’d hate it even more to allow someone else to have you. We would be great together. How can you not see that?”
Swabbing the surgical location with betadine, Sebastian paused, holding the scalpel over the planned incision site. Giving John a sympathetic look, he said;
“We’ll get back to that. You have plenty of time left,” John said, reaching his hand into Sherlock’s pants and grasping his cock.
“Ah. Is it this then?” John sucked the skin of Sherlock’s thigh hard enough to leave a bruise and then looked up at Sherlock expectantly. He was running out of ideas.
“Um…yeah, sure. I’ll be in touch when I know anything else.” Lestrade said, and waited for Sherlock to make use of the insult he’d left in that statement.
“John, you’ve just drunk an entire bottle of scotch in under an hour. Maybe you should take a break,” the bartender put in tentatively.
“You’re this great detective. I shouldn’t have to tell you not to lay on a back that was recently operated on. You big dope.” John said fondly, sitting on the side of the bed.
“I can deal with it for one script. It’s not like there’s a lot to this one. It’s barely 25 pages long. It’s more of a ‘get right to the point’ kind of thing. Sometimes those are better.”
“I just answered that one! No. Silver cannot harm you. Let’s get back to the Soul. What do you think it means?”
“The yellow powder represents knowledge and learning and the victim’s head is covered in it,” John continued.
“I don’t need a babysitter. I’ll call you when I get home.” John walked through the bedroom door, picked up his coat from the coat rack without even a backwards glance at Sherlock.
The man was new; he’d only had the job for a month but John had been impressed right away by his dedication to keeping the labs and offices pristine and sanitized. The hazardous waste containers were emptied every night - that seemed obvious in an area where biohazards were handled daily but John had worked in places where the sharps boxes were over flowing with discarded needles and bloody laundry still waiting to be picked up. No. Even though this man was “just doing his job” he was exceptionally thorough and John sincerely appreciated it.
“How did it go so wrong, Neely…” Becca said and began to read again looking for all the world like she belonged right where she was sitting. She looked up.
“You don’t want to start anything with me, Watson, because after I finish kicking your arse, I’m going to break your boyfriend’s nose just for the satisfaction of it. Oh, and I won’t be pulling any punches like I would with a cripple.”
“One other thing. I want you to express yourself vocally. I want to hear your excitement, your passion, it’s nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about. I want to hear you moan and beg. Can you do that for me, Sherlock?”
“Not together. They were at either end of the alley although I didn’t see Anderson so that was a bit of a surprise.”
John suspected that the nightly visits were due in part to his being the only other person on the floor working the nightshift.While John enjoyed working alone, he knew that for others, it could be lonely working in the middle of the night in an empty building five days a week and John was usually the only one remaining at that hour so he’d seemed to be a natural choice for the man to begin talking to and before John new it, it’d become an almost nightly thing.
Pulling down Sherlock’s pajama bottoms, the iPad was tucked firmly against his backside. John laughed and reached out to take the now very warm device leaving Sherlock’s pale, pert arse exposed.
“I’m taking you to bed,” John said, grasping Sherlock’s right hand with his left, “Off you go,” he said following that up with a gentle tug.
“He’s the DI in charge of homicide. He’s quite good, actually but if you tell him I said that I’ll call you a liar. His first name is ‘Greg’ but I’ll never give him the satisfaction of acknowledging that. Keep that to yourself as well.”
“Lay down, please. I don’t have all night to do this. Well, I do but I don’t think you’d like picking up a corpse if you don’t behave. Now. Lay. Down.” Becca patted the bed.
“Fine. You can buy the cheap vending machine coffee for an entire week after I return from vacation. Deal?”
“Ok. Off to get my kit. It’s hidden in the hazmat cart, secure in a sealed container so you don’t have to worry about cross contamination and obviously, I’ll be wearing surgical gloves but then, you’ve probably already anticipated that. Be right back,” Sebastian said, giving John’s shoulder a brief pat before he left.
“None of your business!” Sherlock exclaimed and pushed his back against the door, effectively slamming it in John’s face. John could swear that he heard voices again.
“Once upon a time there was a man who met and fell in love with a gorgeous, brilliant man. People told the man not to trust the genius but the man couldn’t help himself; it was love at first sight.
“No. Thank you. That won’t be necessary.” Sherlock said, subtly shifting his leg trying to get his stiffening cock into a more comfortable position.
“It’s not really ‘hitting’ you with my fist so much as…entering you,” John looked at Sherlock expectantly hoping that he’d get it so that he didn’t have to go into detail.
“Sherlock. There’s a man here pretending to be your brother and he expects me to get in his car with him. Not happening.”
When several minutes had passed, and Sherlock’s cock had finished spasming, he looked at John triumphantly and waited for the praise that was sure to follow such a performance. His cock was now completely limp, looking like nothing so much as an empty balloon that had been overinflated and was now empty.
“Sadly, no whips or paddles were specified. Only the use of my hand. Don’t worry though. I’ll make sure that you don’t feel cheated in the pain department,” John said, sitting on the sofa and patting his lap.
“That’s the point of this exercise. You DON’T think. You DO. Which in this case is; whatever I tell you to do. Got it?” John snapped, tugging at Sherlock’s hair again.
“You don’t appreciate it? Really? Some of us have to work for a living. We don’t get to sit about the flat all day working on a new method of destruction,” John said angrily. No one could make him loose his temper faster than Sherlock. He knew it, and Sherlock not only knew it but enjoyed it. Immensely.
“No. I want you to personally lick it up as a favor to me. You wouldn’t want to disappoint me, would you?”
“Come on, John. I don’t want to hurt you. How would that look? Me beating up a cripple? I don’t even have a problem with you.”
Omegaverse that is not a popular thing to do. You can either have your own babies or your useless to an Alpha. The Omega can still go into heat because of the ovaries still existing and they can still bond but without a womb, they feel worthless. Omegaverse society's making that rule. At least in this fic. Oh, and good luck getting your baby back from an Omega who's carried it for nine months.
“A cheater? What a surprise. My turn.” Then John balled up his fist and nailed Anderson in the shoulder right between the joints. Anderson’s arm immediately went numb.
Still, he kept a tiny spark of hope alive in a room in the Palace set aside for the things that he considered to be too ridiculous allow himself think about. But in the back of his mind, a little voice whispered ‘what if they aren’t ridiculous?’ So they remained intentionally hidden from himself but readily accessible just incase the day should come where something surprised him. Because of this, it was a very small room.
If Moriarty had been watching Sherlock’s habits, he’d have known that his thug had at best, until 2am to get John out of there before Sherlock went in after him. Which meant that, logically, they had to have implemented their plan well before 2am to ensure that there wasn’t a chance of Sherlock realizing that John had already been long gone by then.
Moriarty was planning something and it was something for which Sherlock was preparing himself in equal parts excitement and dread.
“It was fantastic! Fulfilled every dream I’d ever had and then some! Is that what you want to hear?”
Truth be told, Sherlock enjoyed their little sparring matches. They both did. They were evenly matched in wit and intellect and had yet to find anyone that met either of those requirements, much less someone who had both. Not that they’d actually looked.
“There once was a detective who was a right proper cock. Never listened to anyone. Never did what he was told. Always got himself into trouble requiring his best friend…”
“Closed for repairs,” John said when Sherlock attempted to snuggle him. Unable to unlock John’s arms, he rolled over to his side of the bed an promptly fell asleep.
I will edit live later, as usual although the story won't change, just the spellos and any continuity issues. (Don't bother commenting that 'spello' isn't a word. I'm aware of that, I just like it better than 'typo' and I make up words, so there! NAH!)
When Sherlock had first started patronizing her establishment, he’d given Irene a list of what he was looking for and it was very specific. At the time, she thought that maybe one or two visits and Sherlock would be satisfied, but she should have known better. Here he was on visit number six and he always left unhappy. Irene was fairly certain that if tonight proved to be a disappointment as well, Sherlock would no longer come here and she’d be forced to go back to stalking him via text. Not very satisfying considering the fact that she knew he read them but rarely responded. She felt certain that she’d be able succeed in fulfilling his fantasy where others had failed…if only she had a cock. That in itself was an indication of how much she wanted to fuck Sherlock Holmes. She’d never felt even the slightly inkling of penis envy before but as soon as he'd walked into the door and rejected her advances, all she could think about was bending him over and dominating him with the largest cock available.
“But you’d never met me yet you were willing to go to a strange man’s house - whose sanity you’d questioned several times - to work on a case that you allegedly didn’t care about in the first place.” Sherlock smiled again.
“Sherlock. You may feel like you know John from reading his file but he doesn’t know you at all. One day? Really? That case was a four at best. You just wanted an excuse to actually spend the day with him. Taking someone to see a dead body is not exactly a date, brother mine.”
“Here you go.” Lestrade walked up, exam gloves in a sterile wrapper and handing them to John who had reached for them at the same time as Sherlock Holmes. Both held onto opposite ends of the packet trying to stare the other down.
“Valley of the Dolls. Oh John. You scamp! I haven’t read this in years! Good trash choice,” Becca said, fanning the pages of the book while she set herself down next to a peacefully sleeping Sherlock. She patted him on the shoulder.
He realized that he’d only told Sherlock not to wait for him to walk John home. Not to let John SEE him. But he’d never actually warned him off of just being in the area when John left work. He was keeping his promise, literally.
Once he certain that Sherlock was completely lost, he thrust his tongue inside and then leisurely began licking him out. Sherlock’s moans were making him even harder. John was fairly certain that there was no blood flow to his brain at the moment and he didn’t care.
Many people think that if you’re a sex worker, you don’t matter. That you can tell us anything and we’ll just listen and admire how amazing, rich, and cruel you are.
“It means that things can go back to normal now. He can come home and heal for a few days…” Mr Watson started.
“Just stay down. The numbness should be wearing off any second now. You’re going only going to wind up there again anyhow.”
TRIGGER WARNINGS: Mentions of rape (not detailed), child abuse (detailed). Heed the trigger warnings up top. They will definitely change as the story progresses.
“Well, too late now. Any other secrets that I should know about?” John asked but Sherlock remained quiet.
“You’re barely tight enough to make me come! Stop moving!” John made it to four thrusts before he was coming deeply inside of Sherlock.
“That you’d…that you’d…penetrate me with your fist,” and here he lowered his voice as if someone was listening in, “In my anus?” He finished lamely.
Eventually, Elizabeth started noticing that John had begun having accidents around the house - often. The only one who was ever around to see what had happened was Harriet who blamed the child for being clumsy.
“I was hoping that maybe someone who is supposedly more competent than I am in this area, had come up with something new,” Sherlock replied.
‘Damn, damn, and double damn! How could she know that?!’ Despite being the greatest, and only, Consulting Detective In The World, Sherlock wasn’t as self-aware as he seemed to think that he was.
“Mycroft is overly concerned with where I am and what I’m doing at any given moment. It’s not like I’m followed everywhere.”
“Ah. That won’t be necessary. This is strictly a conversation. No sex required.” Christ. He was blushing again. Still!
“That’s it! John! I’ve solved it! John?” Sherlock looked around and realized that John wasn’t there to share his brilliance. He’d really stayed in bed rather than step up to watch his genius journey to the solution. No one else could solve these mysteries. Certainly not NSY!
Stuffing his mobile back into his inside jacket pocket, Sherlock stared intently at the hospital entrance from his vantage point across the street where he’d been sitting for hours. ‘I’m not breaking any rules,’ he told himself. John said that he didn’t to be walked home for awhile and he was honoring that request while taking advantage of a loophole: John had said that he didn’t want to see Sherlock for awhile but he hadn’t said anything about Sherlock being in the area and so Sherlock would remain unseen.
“Luck?! Get off me! You said that if you hurt me, I could go. You just hurt me. And not for the first time either. I don’t know why I let you talk me into doing these sort of things,” John said, exasperation clear in his voice.
John still has one pesky keyword to figure out. One more chapter and it's over. I hope that you're enjoying this bit of fluff.
"You must like it because you keep losing," John said, trying but failing to suppress another smile. He patted the coffee table.
Still no sound from Sherlock other than the occasional sigh and moan. John removed his mouth from Sherlock’s cock.
“You’ve actually gone out into the field and checked those bodies in person, Mycroft? Because I don’t trust your incompetent agents to do it on their own. They seem to need supervision.”
“That sounds great. I’m relatively new here so I won’t be taking off any time in the near future,” John said as he headed towards the exit.
“Gregory! Wait! I’m on my way!” Mycroft yelled, shoving his mobile into a pocket, appearing in the bedroom doorway in the blink of an eye.
The fourth chapter turned out to have almost 5k words so I've broken it in two and there will now be five chapters. The fifth one is written and I'm polishing it right now.
“I’ll just get myself ready, shall I?” Sherlock said and with a wicked smile, turned onto his stomach, lifted up his arse and tore his pajama bottoms down until he could kick them to the floor. He then lay back down, sinuously moving his hips and rubbing cock against the bedding.
John turned and walked away. When he’d gone far enough that Anderson didn’t think he’d come back, he yelled;
“Give that information to Three Continents Watson? You might start out just wanting to try it once, but then it’d turn into an abuse of power and I can’t allow that to happen.”
Sherlock didn't win the following night, or the next…he never won, not even once. John knew that Sherlock was throwing the game but never said a word. He was more than happy to have that sweet arse bent over various items in the flat and never said a word. And Sherlock? Well, he just let John enjoy the fantasy that he was getting one over on Sherlock.
“Ok but only for a few minutes. He won’t be awake at all tonight. Perhaps leaving Mr Watson and your daughter at home when it comes to visiting, might be a good idea,” the doctor said gently.
“Oh god!” Sherlock exclaimed as John bit down on his earlobe and thrusting his cock all the way in simultaneously.
“Just,” Sherlock gestured around the room, “all of her things are still here. How can they still be here and yet she’s gone. It’s as if she could walk in the door at any minute. I don’t understand,” Sherlock threw himself down in one of the chairs.
“Well, then. You have nothing to lose. It’s not like I’m going to force myself on you. How insulting.”
“They were obnoxious trust fund babies. All four of them had violent tempers. My employees always came away with deep purple bruises on their bodies, the pain obvious in their walk.”
“It would be more accurate to say that I feel that it’s a phobia that I need to overcome. Many have tried, none have succeeded, some are still in hospital.”
“Yeah, a Dhamphir friends with a vampire? I don’t think so. Why were you even there?” Sherlock demanded.
“I’d hardly call giving you an antihistamine drugging you. You should have looked at the pills before swallowing them,” John said placidly.
“John. Fancy meeting you here,” DI Greg Lestrade said. “The coroner doesn’t usually get here BEFORE the Yard. Pub crawling, were you?” Lestrade smiled down at John. They’d become friendly bordering on friends, in the six months since John had become the senior coroner at St Bart’s.
The genius was constantly getting himself into trouble and the man felt that he finally had a purpose; he’d take care of this genius and protect him from all harm.
“John. John, what are you doing? I need you to fuck me.” Sherlock said, rocking back against John’s cock.
“What was that? Can’t hear you. My goodness, you’re thirstier than I thought,” John said, tipping the bottle up to empty the rest of the water into Sherlock’s mouth.
This went on for several minutes, unfortunately, we were both too excited to last much longer and there was a sudden eruption during which time I shot my load between Sherlock's arse cheeks and he came in his robe that was between us.
“Honestly. Pick a name then. Is it ‘Moron’ or ‘idiot?’ I can’t be expected to remember such minor details.”
“This stupid cunt’s gone and gotten himself knocked up!” Harry screamed, foot still on John’s stomach.
"Oh, brother dear. Would it kill you to keep up with pop culture? Just a little bit? You know, to keep up with the times?"
Suddenly, a man pushed his way through the throng of people yelling; “Let me through, I’m a doctor!”
“He holds a ‘minor’ position in the government and his fingers are in many pies, both figuratively and literally.” Sherlock said the last sarcastically.
“How could you be sure that they wouldn’t tell each other? They were so competitive, I’d think that they’d want to brag to each other about it.”
“So, if they became repeat customers, I assume that they were satisfied with Doctor Watson’s…ah…service?”
“Hurt me. I don’t care! I want you now…AH!!” Sherlock sighed as he felt four fingers enter him, pushing himself back on them as John fucked him.
“Stop fiddling with that. I’ll get to it. Not really sterile but this is as good as it gets since I forgot my tray,” Becca said, pouting.
“Really? I must say that you hide your intelligence very well. One would never guess that you had something going on in that silver head of yours.”
He put the kettle on and told Sherlock he’d “be right back.” Then went to the lav, opened his medical bag, unwrapped a syringe and picked up a bottle that he only used in emergencies. Drawing up enough Lorazepam to knock out a horse he went back to the living room and stood before Sherlock, syringe held openly in his hand.
John laughed, “I do indeed. Still, I am sorry about it. Not enough to take it all back but, not without some residual guilt hanging on. I’ll make it up to you, what can I do? Name it?”
“After a day spent trying to solve a crime - a crime which you’d apparently already solved - you’re suddenly acting completely out of character. What’s wrong with you?”
John, who had been shifting on the balls of his feet, preparing his attack, suddenly stood stock still, giving Sherlock an angry glare.
“Fisting? So I fight you off and you dominate me. We’ve wrestled before. Honestly, John. You’re being childish.”
When he’d recovered, he said, “Sir. You know that I despise Sherlock Holmes. Can’t stand the sight of him.”
‘Well, that didn’t go as expected. I guess the mythological honeymoon is over…still.’ Sherlock thought, sitting up and wrapping his robe about himself as if it was a mantle.
“Indeed I have not forgotten,” Sherlock said indignantly. “I’ve given, WE’VE given you all the clues now it’s your turn to find the culprit. John’s in pain. We’re leaving.” Sherlock grabbed John’s good arm and turned to leave. He was going to drag John out of there if he had to. Under no circumstances was John going to say  colors in Hindi!
“I don’t know.” Seemed like the safest answer to John. He wasn’t getting Bill involved in this. He didn’t even know that John was pregnant. Harry had only found out because she walked in on him in his bedroom while he was looking at the blue result on the test stick and that was it. The fireworks started.
‘Good thing I know where Mrs Hudson keeps her herbal soothers,’ and gave a wicked smile before finally allowing himself to enjoy John’s work.
“Hmmm…that’s a good idea and Jack is a nickname for John, after all. I like it! What do you think, Jack?” Moriarty asked John while taking a long pull on John’s blood.
“You can see if my parents are out there. After all, they’re the ones who insisted that I bring that bastard into the world. Give it to them. Let them figure out what to do with it.”
“Go fix the Doctor, don’t dawdle. I’ll keep her warm for you,” Irene reached down and held her naked vagina in her hand. Throwing her head back, Irene moaned;
“No, John. Wait. The crack investigative staff is going to photograph the scene and I’d like to see them, then the body will be off to the morgue where we’ll be waiting for it.” Sherlock said with barely contained glee.”
"Then why must you persist in seeking out the people causing these pointless murders? You're only saving people who are going to die anyway. Isn't that what you're saying? Hmmm?"
Sherlock watched as John entered his building giving a sigh of relief. Although he’d prefer to actually walk with John rather than following him, at least this way he could still keep an eye on him. Still. Something felt wrong. Why hadn’t Moriarty made a move? Something was coming and Sherlock was determined to be ready for it.
“It’s ok, sweetheart. I have something better for us. I want, no. I need to fuck you, will you let me? I promise you that it’ll feel wonderful.”
The first thing that Sherlock noticed as he began searching the lab was an odor he hadn’t expected: Vampire! Then he smelled blood and knew that it was John’s. He began searching for the source of the blood and found a bin with two empty coffee cups, two used syringes, which should have been disposed of in the sharps box, and wads of bloody gauze. They’d obviously been left there for him to find.
“No offense but the only thing that I know about you is that your name is Lestrade and that Sherlock is faster than you.”
“Nope. Nope. That’s not going to fit. I release you from our contract!” Sherlock said magnanimously.
“Oh, and about that other thing that you mentioned. I’m Sherlock’s “weakness?” I haven’t asked him for a thing, nor will I ask anything of him. I’ve only just met him for Christ’s sake. I don’t see how I could be his weakness; whatever that means.” John demanded.
‘I know he’s hidden my cigs around here somewhere. He’d never throw them out. I just need to think like John. That’ll take five minutes at most.’
“She shouldn’t have been standing in the middle of the walkway. A blind spot no less. That goes for you too, John, is it? Besides, I knew you’d eventually come huffing and puffing around the corner and do whatever needed to be done,” Sherlock looked John up and down, “which appears to have been nothing and you’ve just wasted my time. Time that could be better spent elsewhere solving yet another one of your crimes.”
Suddenly, a shadow blocked John’s light and he looked up to see a tall young man in a long coat with a mane of black, curly hair. Instantly feeling a chill run up his spine, both examined each other in an awkward silence for a few minutes.
"Ah, but then, I'm well known for being obnoxious so it doesn't count. As to why I'm standing here; I've recently discovered your interest in my buttocks so I thought that, rather than sit on it, I'd put it on display for your enjoyment," he finished calmly. The bloody bastard had yet to turn around and was intentionally flexing his arse for my benefit.
“I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. I don’t do ‘puns.’ You’re making it hard to concentrate, could you please leave.”
“Neither. I’m completely serious. Since the hospital is waking up, let’s you and I step out for some coffee and talk this over. I have a few things to tell you about yourself that I don’t think you’re aware of,” Sherlock said, standing up.
John began squeezing the handle of the speculum, slowly ratcheting it open. This wasn’t done to limit any discomfort for Sherlock. John was so turned on just watching Sherlock be mechanically opened for his use that he wanted to savor it. Savor using Sherlock without a care for his comfort.
“I’ve been standing here staring at you for the past 10 minutes waiting for you to open your eyes and talk to me. There’s no way that you didn’t notice me, closed eyes or no.”
“Looks like I’m going to have to start timing the thermometer all over again,” John said in mock annoyance.
“I see that your attitude hasn’t been improved by the pain. You’re still as big a jerk as usual, albeit it, a bit more subdued.” John said, pulling his small kit of scalpels.
“Have it your way,” John said, holding Sherlock’s nose closed until he opened his mouth and emptied the entire glass in one measured pour.
Sherlock had had plenty of anal sex in his life but only as a giver, never as a receiver. He was still a virgin in that area and he desperately wanted to lose said virginity but not really.
“How can Sherlock have a brother? I thought that Dhamphirs could only be created by a vampire having sex with a human woman.”
