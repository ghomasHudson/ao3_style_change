"Has that thing been recording the whole time?" Dean wonders.
"Yeah," Sam huffs, sparing the details from Jess' ears. If Sam remembers right, and he knows he does, their dad had cursed them both out and threatened to take the dog out to Bobby's and shoot it.
"I didn't have anything in mind yet." Cas shifts back on his feet, leaning close enough for Dean to breathe on his neck. Cas has his coat back on, Dean notices.
”Do not worry, Dean. I am not dying.”
"What are you doing out here?" Cas asks.
Sam thinks about telling Dean, but Miss Novak probably texted him, too. His phone buzzes again.
”Yeah.” He leaves the door locked behind him and follows Cas to the car.
”Hello, Sam.” Cas gives his usual crooked smile.
Eventually, Dean hops back onto the bed, and Cas follows. The mattress creaks under their weight. They sit shoulder to shoulder, Dean balancing the laptop on his knees. As Dean navigates the computer, a dozen questions pop up in Cas' head. But he bites his tongue, remembering the conversation they had weeks ago;
this week, and you know him when he’s grumpy.”
The stone walkway underneath his feet is almost painfully cold to the touch. He's careful not to step on any stray bugs. There's something satisfying in the way the dead leaves crunch under his toes. A tiny brown creature scurries across in front of him, over to the pointy hemlock tree right next to the door. Castiel blinks, missing where the creature goes. So he keeps walking.
They make a turn, and oh shit, Dean gets dipped. Cas’ arms are sturdy, holding him there for a second longer than necessary. If Dean’s heart wasn’t throbbing before…
”There’s a big plot in the back of the cemetery. Say hi to Anna for me.”
Dean parks across the street from the high school. The wind nips at his face when he shuts the door behind him. He checks his watch: he's got more than enough time. He watches his breath curl like smoke towards the sun, and spends a moment craving a swig of his dad's Jack Daniel's. He can never do Monday mornings. Something about today makes his chest feel particularly full.
"Come on Sammy, live a little!" Dean laughs, hitting the gas.
"Sam." Castiel cuts in, derailing whatever tangent Dean was going down. Sam looks at Cas: his eyes are dark and the shadows make them look like they've already sunk deep into their sockets. "I have cystic fibrosis."
It’s nice.
Castiel does not understand the voice, so he doesn’t answer.
“No, Sam. Thank you.”
He feels
"Hello, Dean." Castiel leans the phone away to take another deep breath. He coughs instead.
”Okay.” Dean takes a deep breath, not looking away from Cas. “I’m so fuckin’ stoked to see Charlie!” The buzz in his chest turns to a boil. “I mean, the way money’s been lately, with Sam’s glasses and all my school shit, I figured I wouldn’t be seeing her ‘til at least next summer. And now I get to see her in a few weeks, and it’s just in time for the tournament! Oh man, Cas. I’m fuckin’ thrilled!” Cas only tilts his head. “Shit, right. Sorry, do you know what LARPing is?” Cas shakes his head. Dean catches himself grinning again. “Well you’re in for it now.”
“My mom, uh, wanted to send you guys a cake or something. Tran special,” Kevin says, shouting a little over the noise of the lunch room. Sam imagines him picking at the nub where his pinky should be, as he does when he’s nervous. Sam flashes a smile, although they can’t see it.
"Of course."
”How dare you make me choose?” Charlie mumbles.
"Cas, you wanna be part of our ugly sweater tradition?" There's something different about Dean's voice, something soft. He has a hopeful smile playing at his lips.
"Okay, pseudo-uncle, sue me."
“Yes. Okay.” Castiel says. He takes a long, slow drink of water. His head clears a good bit. “Mother?” He says as she starts to leave.
Dean considers chucking his fork at the kid.
Dean wonders. He huffs.
"It's the eve before Christmas Eve! So, it's Christmas Eve Eve, get it?" Dean explains.
”Um,” Dean looks like he’s going to bite on his tongue. “Yeah, what’s… What’s the matter?”
"Fine, but when
“We got into a fight with our dad,” Sam offers, not looking at either of them. “We left, and Dean just wound up here.”
"Yeah, yeah." Dean dismisses, but Cas catches his smile before he turns away. The fountain in the middle of the garden is still burbling in full force, as frigid as the water may be. The angel on top has the lightest dusting of snow across it's wings. Cas stops to admire it, how it shines in the fading sunlight.
"Are you kidding, Jess? This is fantastic."
He turns onto the street without thinking. The houses in Cas' neighborhood are a lot larger than Dean's used to. Even Bobby's place is small compared to this part of town.
“Yeah, well that makes you a bitch.”
She lights up. “Perfect. Dad made peanut butter balls the other day.”
”If I hear that damn song one more time, Sammy,” Dean swears, “I’ll--”
“I got a ride home,” he answers bluntly, tucking his coattails under him as he sits. His mother tells him that she's heading to work once she finishes making her dinner. “You have the night shift?”
Dean smiles. He laughs. Castiel was here. Castiel was here.
Dean looks up to the front of the room. It’s a sleek, rich wooden casket, with light blue cushioning inside. Around it is half a dozen bouquets of flowers, all different kinds. Ribbons hang down from one, although Dean can’t make out what’s written on them. And in the coffin lies Castiel, his hands folded together on his stomach, a sleek blue tie around his neck. Dean pauses, expecting Castiel to open his eyes and squint at the flourescent light. To turn to Dean and reach out his hand to say
Jo hands everyone a plastic fork for the cake. Dean hands one to Castiel, and leaves his arm lying on the table. Castiel puts his own arm right up next to Dean’s. The cake, Castiel decides, is not the best cake he has had in his life. Although little can compare to the food he got the chance to eat in Italy when he was young. But it is sweet and tastes like raspberries, and that is enough.
“I was thinking about… Just two weeks ago we had a movie night, me and the Winchesters, and Jo, and Ash, and Ash decided to reenact a scene from Titanic, and he broke the Winchester’s coffee table. And, I don’t recall ever laughing harder. I don’t know what to think any more.” Castiel is silent for a moment, his fingers fiddling an unstarted prayer. “I feel as if I’m holding a funeral for what might have been.”
”Well, the Daphnes are more vibrant in the winter, but the Scilla always bloom early.”
”You’re early! I’m not done yet!”
The shattering glass sounds nothing like relief.
"You're still up, aren't you?"
Castiel can not say he’s ever hated himself before, but the next time Dean glances over to him, he looks away.
"What would she say?"
that?"
”A bedtime story, duh,” Dean chuckles.”
”Thanks, Dad.” Dean wants to say more, but he blames the syrup. It’s as good an excuse as any.
Air, it seems, is the last thing that wants to be inside Castiel’s lungs.
"That is not your fault," Cas assures him. Dean only grunts. Cas stares at him, hard, until he looks up from the ground.
A tremble rises from Dean’s knees where they’re digging into the bench. It rises to his hips and his chest, out to his jaw and his hands, where they hover over Castiel’s body. Castiel is dead. Dean hasn’t cried yet. Castiel is dead. Here, kneeling before Castiel’s body, Dean succumbs to his grief. Castiel is dead. Dean shakes and heaves. His throat grows sore; His sleeves, stained with tears. He cries. He cries, until there’s nothing left inside him to cry out. Castiel is dead.
”Hello to you too, Dean.” Dean is suddenly very aware of how he looks: the red vest that’s a little too big, the pants with a tear in the knee. But Cas doesn’t seem to notice, he only holds the flowers out to him: they’re fresh, a couple whose petals fade from white to blue-violet, with a yellow center, and a cluster of pink ones that look like four-pointed stars with orange centers. “Siberian squill, and Daphne odora.” Cas points to the purple and pink flowers, respectively. “Fresh from Eden.”
"Sir," Dean greets his dad with a smile, even though he knows John can't see. Dean's posture corrects itself so he's nearly standing at attention, when John opens his mouth to speak.
Castiel enters his English class with a stifled groan. The desks have all been moved into groups of two or three, with index card nametags on each. Mrs. Leonard is apologizing for all the index cards, and assures everyone that the projector should be working again by next week. The lights flicker overhead. Excited murmurs spring up and ripple across the class. Castiel finds the seat unfortunately labeled
"You're both up early," Sam notes. Dean just gives him a look and hands him a mug. It smells bitter and it makes his fingertips tingle with heat. "What's this, coffee?"
”Whatever, it’s your paycheck.”
”Dean.” Charlie snaps her fingers at him. “You remember that knob I was telling you about a month or so ago, Gerry?”
"No; this was meant to be a surprise for you."
“I’m so sorry,” Castiel says again. Dean whispers something into Castiel’s shoulder. “Hm?” Cas asks.
"Of course," Cas nods, moving his rook out a couple spaces. Sam pushes his glasses up his nose, and takes his eyes off the game board for a second to check the time: nearly midnight.
"Oh, gross, Dean!" Sam wrinkles his nose. "At least help me set the table before you dive in." Dean grumbles something that Cas doesn't catch, and he's not sure he would want to.
”Not Quinto? Have you seen him?”
He did not make from nails and drywall,
”There was once an angel,” Cas repeats, “who, one day, decided to come down to earth. He had never been down before, only watched passively from up in heaven. He had always been curious, however. Curious about who the humans were, why God was so keen on protecting them.
The back of the envelope is filled with lazy scribbles in a bight purple pen; the front is addressed to a
Dean curses. From downstairs, Rummy barks. The basement stairs creak when Bobby comes back up. Dean slides down next to Sam, sitting on the stairs. The bottom of his boots are caked with dried mud.
Castiel is silent for a long time. The wind rustles some budding petals loose. They swirl to the ground and stop at Dean and Cas’ feet.
Hey nerds I'm so sorry this took so long. First month of college, hooray! But also holy shit.
Enjoy
“You are.”
But Dean seems to understand. He hooks an arm under one of Castiel’s own, eases him gently away from the sink.
It’s a large room. There are rows of chairs sitting in the stomach, and little desks with pads of paper and tissue boxes on the sides. Two tall, pale blue boards stand on the far wall, each covered with photographs. The coffin is up front. Dean doesn’t look at that yet. He drops Adra’s hand and makes a beeline for the photo boards. He’s seen a few of the photos before, from the Novak’s living room. A couple of baby photos. Toddler Castiel sitting in a pumpkin patch. Pimple-faced Cas grimacing for a school picture. Some of the photos are new: Castiel, pimple-faced but less so, kneeling before a priest. Something shiny slides down from Castiel’s forehead. He closed his eyes, but he has a small smile.
He tosses his backpack down on the couch and hits the lights. Sam files in behind him, setting his bags down on the table. He goes over to the cabinet and digs a can of tuna from the back, sniffing it before setting it on the floor. The cat chows on it and gives Sam a thankful mew. Dean sneezes again.
”Just hop on the sarcasm bus with me and it’ll be a smooth ride.”
“Ellen called me,” John explains, gruff. Dean stares. John still doesn’t look at him. Dean swallows.
He takes a deep breath, feeling the air pounding, thick-but-not-thick-enough, against his lungs.
The door to the men's room slams shut behind him. His lungs feel empty, too empty, and his eyes are watering to the point that the sink in front of him is nothing but a blur. His jacket smells like rain. Violent coughs. His tongue tastes like salt. A mouthful of mucus falls into the sink. He spits. His rose runs; more salt. His knuckles are white on the sink's edge. A couple cold tears start to stream down his cheeks. More coughs erupt. His lungs are empty, his mouth is full. There's a metallic tang coating his tongue, now. The spots in the sink turn red. Air! He needs air. His bottom lip quivers. Air.
He doesn't realize how cold he is until he's driving down the street without his jacket.
“How much looonger, Deeean?” Sam asks.
Eventually, Cas gets a call from Adra that he needs to head home. Before he leaves, he pulls Sam aside to ask him something that Dean doesn’t quite catch. Dean drives Cas back home, chatting all the way. He feels like they’ll never run out of things to say.
The familiar curl of the iron gate greets them, silhouetted with the orange glare of the setting sun. Out of habit, Dean begins to hum Metallica, to try and stop feeling like his ribs are made of charcoal. He never likes coming here, but he's always felt like he has to. Like healing and reopening an old wound at the same time. He tried to explain it to Sam once, and Sammy did the best he can, but he couldn't really get what Dean wanted to say. It's Sam, though, the kid understood him anyway. That's fine.
Dean turns back to his brother, who's glaring at him with cheeks pink not only from the cold.
Cas, as it turns out, got Sam some old books. They’re too worn for Dean to read the cover properly from where he’s sitting. Brown and a dull green, both cracking like they haven’t been touched in years. Dean thinks Sam’s smile is the best present of them all.
Dean wrings out the towel in his hands, although it’s nearly bone dry by now. He stares at himself hard in the mirror: he has a rounder face than Cas’, with a fresh shaving nick just below his jaw. His eyes are wide and they look heavy, like he hasn’t been sleeping. He runs a hand through his hair for the thousandth time that evening.
Dean finishes sweeping up and then he finds the bin of garden supplies, including a pair of thick gloves. He picks the dirt from his nails, laughing at himself. Back inside, it’s warmer, sending a leftover shiver up Dean’s back as he ties his jacket around his waist. Adra sits at the island, her legs crossed at the ankles, petting a Gabe who’s sprawled on his back, exposing his fat, fluffy tummy. What a beautiful slut. Dean is gonna to miss him. Dean goes and gets a cup out of the pantry and fills it under the tap.
Dean huffs. “Whatever, Cas. What do you want to do for your special day, anyway?”
“You’re free to go,” the secretary waves them off. They bolt.
Sam shivers when he walks, the cold latching onto any bare skin it can find. There’s a short stone path to the graveyard behind the church. After crunching over long-dead leaves for a few minutes, Sam asks what exactly they’re doing.
Sam's room has a bookshelf pushed up under the windowsill, in the same place Dean has a stack of beer cans and an old pair of jeans. Dean tosses some books up onto the bed, straightening up the rest of the books that are spilling off the shelf.
His writing is neat, written in all capital letters and a neat calligraphy, the same way it's been since he was young. As he's setting his pen down, he hears an unexpected knock at his door. He tells them to come in. The trap door latch is unhooked and the ladder tumbles down to the floor below. There's some fumbling, the clink of china, and a muttered curse or two, before the guest sticks her head in.
Yeah, Dean guesses, that’s something.
”You deserve them more than I do.” Sam stops.
This is not true. Dean is, in fact, sitting on Castiel's bed saying he's sorry for at least the fourth time since they came up to the bedroom. He helped wring out Cas' coat and got him a spare shirt from the drawer, all while Cas coughed all the water out into the bathroom sink the floor below. Cas needed an extra hand on the trap door, and Dean didn't let his wrist go until they were all the way over to Cas' bed. His eyes are trained on Cas as he strips his shirt off. Cas tries to pretend his shiver is from the cold.
Sam glares at him across the table.
“Yeah, I thought so, too,” He says, “Would you, uh, come with me? When I get it done?”
Whatever Sam thought Jess was going to say is gone now. He has to stop for a second.
"Well you failed," Dean grumps, sitting up. "The fuck are you doing?"
The garage is a poorly lit room with a concrete floor that seeps cold through Dean’s shoes no matter what time of year it is. Rain drums the roof. An old radio sits in the corner, it’s antenna sticking up at a precise angle, perfectly functional but turned off. On one side of the garage is a variety of wheels, bolts, other tools one might need to fix up a car. Dean parked the Impala on the other side of the garage that has garden shears, a rake, a wheelbarrow, and some mulch growing old in the corner. Things Bobby’s wife left behind before she died, that Bobby hadn’t the energy to box away. It smells like Eden. Sweat gleans down Dean’s back. There’s a crowbar near one of the Impala’s wheels, almost completely under the car. Dean grits his teeth and slides the crowbar out from where it’s been tucked away.
Cas huffs, mostly at himself.
Sam and Cas sit at opposite sides of the table, a cheap wooden chess set between them. Dean is at the head, hands folded in front of him, watching intently.
“Thank you for coming,” Cas says.
"Hey," Dean says, scooting over on his unmade bed.
"Hey Dean, hey Castiel," Sam says, giving Castiel a smile before focusing back on Dean. "Looks, I know we just got here and all, but it looks like the storm's getting bad." As if on cue, the library lights flicker. "See what I mean? We ought to head out before it gets any worse."
Dean nearly snorts.
He drops his bag like a bomb, strolling up to Mrs. Leonard, who's sitting alone at her desk. Ms. Nisbet is absent, too.
Castiel hasn't heard Adra laugh in years, until then.
"I'll let you know once I get the batteries back in." Sam tells him.
”Spending time with you is gift enough.”
The brothers sink back into the couch, waiting for the last person to reach into the remaining pile.
"Yeah, that's Adra's kid. I used to go to church with them. You should give him a chance, he ain't all that bad." Bobby says. Dean shrugs again. He doubts it, but he doesn't tell Bobby that.
Someone calls for Ru, an old woman with long white-grey dreadlocks. Ru gives Cas a quick, one-arm hug and goes to his grandmother. They talk for a minute and Grandmomma gives Cas a smile.
Well, perhaps I'll get to that later.
”It’s your birthday! The big one-eight! What did you have in mind?” Oh. Not Valentine’s Day.
He grimaces, knowing she won't take a lie.
“I’m sorry for barging in without warning,” Dean says, looking from Adra to Castiel with a grimace.
he thinks, standing up. He throws his book back into his bag, muttering something about them meeting up tomorrow. And then he's gone.
Castiel puts a hand on Sam’s shoulder again.
”You know what? You get it.” Sam declares. “I don’t know what exactly it is, but you get it, Cas. You understand that thing about life.”
"Cool. It's not bad, I mean, it's just different. Never seen anyone do it like that before."
"Yeah!" Sam smiles. "We started it in school this week, but I always like to read ahead." Dean stops walking at the back end of a boxy, black car.
Sam thinks, his heart sounding like it's going to beat right out of his chest. Her lips are sticky, like chapstick but sweeter, and when he puts a hand up to cup her cheek, her face is still cold. She shivers to his touch, pulling her lips away. She laughs, and he swears the whole world is golden.
And yet…
He didn't answer his phone when Dean came to pick him up this morning, so Dean had to leave without him. Of course. No wonder.
Dean cheers.
Cas is aware of Dean's presence on the couch, with his now more prominent snoring and occasional shift in position. He shuts his eyes and tries to wash the feeling away, but it continues to buzz at the back of his head.
“M’sorry, Sammy,” Dean shrugs, “I didn’t wanna be the one to tell you.”
The principal's office is at the front of the building, a room Dean got very well-acquainted with his freshman year. They burst through the door and the short, lunch-lady like secretary with too much lipstick gives them a quick, professional smile. Ash is here. Beside him, speaking in frantic whispers with the principle, is Adra Novak. Her hair is falling out of it’s bun, and her eyes are steely. Dean freezes when the pair turns to them.
“Hm?” Dean says, “What, hum? I don’t remember when I started. I just always… did it.”
A few long-dead leaves twist around in the air outside. Castiel has to blink a few times to see them properly. He glances at the thermometer on the wall, which is much harder to see in the new darkness. It's cold. He grabs his coat from the wardrobe. Several thudding heartbeats pass through his chest before the wind dies down. The sky that's normally littered with pinprick stars, tonight is shrouded in heavy grey clouds. There is a steady breeze that patters Castiel's chest when he unlatches the window.
Gilda tenses.
Sam looks at him, his eyes wide open, his mouth slightly ajar. He nods rapidly. His glasses fall to his nose.
“Boyfriend,” Dean admits, and it hurts, like an arrow piercing through his chest. His free hand he moves up to wipe his face, for the millionth time this weekend. The woman nods.
is sitting on top.
"You do?" The relief is tangible on Dean's tongue. It tastes like salt.
,” Dean sighs out.
Or wither.
"Cas, you okay?" Dean's voice is muffled through the door. "Can I come in?"
Cas slings his backpack into the back seat. He stalls before walking over to the open passenger's side door and sitting down. Some song Cas doesn't recognize blares through the car's radio. As always, he asks if Dean can turn it down, and as always, Dean tells him that the driver picks the music. After they get onto the main road, Cas turns it off anyway. Dean stops to shoot him a glare, but doesn't try to turn the radio back on.
Tonight, he is leaning over paper on his desk, twirling an electric blue pen between his fingers. He pulls phrases out of the air, and ideas from the burrow in his chest. The click of his pen echoes.
"Yes." Castiel takes a deep breath, very glad he is no longer hooked up to a heart monitor. The clock on the wall ticks forward. "I was wondering if you would like to spend the night with me on Friday." There's a pause.
There's a blue lighter in the box, buried beneath an envelope.
His phone buzzes in his pocket.
"Hey, Cas," Dean smiles at him. Maybe it's the fluid clinging to his lungs as well, but Cas finds it very hard to breathe. He had not realized just how badly he missed the boy until right then.
Sam's cheeks jump up ten degrees as Jess snakes her arms around his shoulders. Even through her poofy jacket, Sam can feel the heat pouring off her. If his heart wasn't pounding before, it certainly is now.
More kids file in at the front of the room. M. Balter pulls up their PowerPoint entitled
"What a baby." Dean snorts, although he, too starts to yawn. He plops back down on the couch, gesturing for Cas to come join him.
“Yeah, dude, y’know,” Jake stutters, “if you, y’know, need anything...”
Hours drip past quicker than Cas can process. He plays through several games of chess with Sam. Dean stays with them through the first two, until he decides he's too utterly bored to carry on. After lunch, Cas finds Dean in his room, putzing around on his laptop.
At one point, Dean says something under his breath. Cas hmms for him to repeat it.
"Ugh!" She rolls her eyes. "Boys!" Jess turns back to the front board.
Dean hears his phone buzz. The cat, who Sam discovers is male, mews when Dean stands up.
John doesn’t say anything else before leaving. Dean digs into his food again after a long beat of silence.
He thinks. Back on the mantle the frames go.
"Shit, I'm with Cas. What's up?"
The phone rings on the wall, ripping Dean’s attention away from the rabbit hole it’s spiraling into. The group up front pauses, and Nisbet answers the call.
. He feels it run like electricity up from his ankle where Cas is touching him, straight to his spine and back down. Dean puts his hand over Cas’.
Silence.
”But this story is about Gabriel. He was… Always getting into trouble. Once, he turned all of his nurses’ hands purple. To this day, I do not know how he got away with it. But he was an experience, to put it lightly. They had trouble at home. I never found out the details, but what I do remember was that Luc had always been the one to bring Gabe in for his appointments. He made every single one on time.
Then he dusts off the picture frames themselves. The photographs inside two of them have been turned over, leaving only the white gloss shine to face Castiel. The other one is entirely empty. Furrowing his brow, Castiel checks the date scribbled onto the back of the empty one.
More running. Dean opens his eyes. He didn’t realize they were shut.
”More photos?”
The couch could be a mirror reflecting right down the middle, with Sammy on one side and Cas on the other. Sammy's sitting with a book in his lap, and Cas is scrawling away in the first pages of his notebook. Dean almost asks what he's writing, but he figures Cas will tell him if it's important. The sun has risen a great deal since Dean stumbled out of bed; now the whole living room is brightly lit. Snow is still falling heavily outside. Sam yawns, shifting in his seat. Dean kicks his feet up to rest on the table, his hands behind his head. Stew sits comfortably in his stomach, spreading the warmth to all of his limbs.
The obnoxious chime of the school bell smashes into his thoughts. He hardly remembers to grab his bag before leaving.
Bobby is anything but surprised when Dean calls. They make it to his place in record time. Sam goes off to scour Bobby's library for new lore, while Dean hangs back to chat with the man.
His hands are shaking so bad that it takes him three tries to get his shirt on over his head. The shirt is dark purple, with a skinny greyhound across the chest; A lousy Christmas present from his dad last year. The clock on the wall behind him seems to tick slower the harder he listens. He shifts from foot to foot. Runs a hand through his hair. He scans around the room, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
“I’m not… I don’t care about that.” It’s Bobby’s turn to blink, give Dean a once-over, and drop his arms back to his sides. He steps back.
Does she know she has such a short time to live? Or is she simply following her instincts, because she knows no better? How many flowers will she see by the time she leaves? He wants to know how dazzling the flowers are to her in the muted November light. Does she spot them from far away because they're so bright? Or is she being a good soldier, just following orders? Trying to survive another day, another hour, to keep her kind alive? He wonders if she even knows she exists at all.
"Who are those for?" Cas asks, pointing. Dean turns to give him a look.
all-encompassing.
“Fuck you! You haven’t been our fucking dad since mom died! We don’t owe you shit!”
He chews the fruit thoughtfully, glad that on most days, hamburgers are an acceptable breakfast food. But they ran out of hamburger meat a few days ago, so he has to settle for something lighter. He takes another bite of his apple and heads out the back door. There's a garden that spreads around his backyard, complete with a stone path that winds around all the fauna. Early morning light streams through the tops of the trees, trees that curve to make a tunnel over Castiel. Ivy vines creep up the walls that run around the outer edges of the yard, a few hugging themselves against the trunks of the trees. Bushes and flowers spread out among the rest of the yard, the only space between them being the stone pathway. In the middle, underneath an archway sits a fountain with an angel poised on top. Even through the chill of the fall morning, the yard is still warm. Castiel strolls through, keeping one hand behind his back as the other clasps his apple. When he was younger, he always imagined this as a small patch of the Garden of Eden, and he himself an angel strolling through.
"A restless god," Sam echoes, "Kinda reminds me of Dean, you know?" Sam leans over, his chin parallel with the chess board. He quiets his voice even more, like he's telling a secret. "Dean always talks about Mom like she was some kind of... Golden woman, like she could do no wrong. I mean, sometimes I think he forgets she was just a person, like the rest of us." Castiel nods.
”Hell no, dude, you’re comin’ with me.” Dean sounds insistent. Something in Cas’ sleepy heart shudders. He swallows, standing up on shaky legs. Dean stands up next to him, stretching and scratching at his stomach. Without warning, Dean strips his shirt off and tosses it on top of his duffel bag in the corner. Cas looks away. His face is hot. “Now we’re even.” Cas looks back at the boy, who gestures to Cas’ bare torso.
His hand shakes, still bright red from the cold, when he grabs a bottle of painkillers and stuffs it into his empty pocket. He thinks about finding his inhaler, but he forgets about it the moment he hears his mother creak by on the stairs.
, just barely. In just a moment, he becomes aware that someone is standing very close to him. His entire body feels too heavy to act on the sudden pull of fear in his stomach.
“Can I take it, then?” Dean looks up when he asks, eyes gentle but pleading.
“Shut up,” Dean doesn’t realize it’s his own voice speaking until John snaps his head up and glares at him. That look is enough. Something in Dean’s chest breaks. It boils. He slams a fist down on the arm of the couch. “Shut the fuck up, Dad.”
”Don’t tell me you like this crap, too?” Dean gestures to the human-vampire couple now balancing on the top of a very unstable-looking tree.
Sam manages to keep his pace with Brady for the first lap, until Brady falls behind to save his energy. Sam's hands turn bright red before he's halfway done, but he keeps going. Miraculously, he manages to be one of the first to finish the run. Ice congratulates him with a warm water bottle that feels like liquid gold on the way down Sam's throat.
There are the typical movie trailers before whatever Dean picked out begins. Castiel sits in the middle of the loveseat, which isn’t new but looks it, and a Winchester brother flanks him on either side. Castiel’s glass he sets between his feet, taking sips occasionally. The movie opens with a very familiar tune, one that Castiel has heard Dean humming quietly on several occasions. Then, there’s an explosion of yellow texts across the screen.
"For the last time, it's Sam." There's more heat in his voice than Dean expects. He lets off the gas enough to pull over.
”I knew there was a reason I keep coming back.”
“Okay, tiger. Can I--” Dean starts.
The house around him creaks under the strain of the storm, not nothing more than a light shower.  A stray car or two passes by the street outside. Dean falls back on his pillow, hardly remembering to kick the boots off the end of his mattress. His eyes shut slowly.
“Nothin’,” Dean answers automatically. No, that's not cool. He clears his throat and starts over, “Just… Cas. He had a doctor’s appointment today, and, and, you’ve seen him. I’m worried, man.”
The bell chimes again, and Dean heads off to lunch.
“Cas,” Sam mumbles, “Cas, Cas, Cas. Castiel.” His name is a prayer, coming from Sam’s mouth. Castiel reaches up and pets Sam’s hair, careful not to snag his glasses. Sam’s hair is down to his shoulders. A gust of wind rustles and a few petals flutter into the fountain water. Sam is shaking little sobs.
Castiel sighs. Focusing on the boy won't get the book read any faster.
He feels like someone twisted up his stomach.
“Cas,” Dean says, his voice coming from very far away. Castiel crosses two fingers of his free hand and sticks it up to Dean. Sign language R. He moves his hand into a loose, flat fist, with his fingers resting on his thumb. E. He points one finger up. D. Dean dives to the dresser and the cool plastic of Cas’ inhaler is being pressed into Castiel’s hand. Cas fights a cough, and puffs once, twice, and his shoulders drop. His red inhaler falls to his lap. He breathes.
Ash shrugs, in a friendly sort of way. “What did I tell you?”
is in written in the Marlboro script. Ruby catches him looking; she looks sad.
Castiel has unexpected guests
“Mother…” Cas starts, then stops to take a puff of his inhaler, then another. He leans on Dean’s open arm. His lungs open, the cool, sticky medicine pumping through him. “Dean and I are dating.”
With us he would shrivel,
"Good. I will see you there."
”Is this date etiquette?” The word ‘date’ coming from Cas’ mouth makes Dean’s throat go dry.
__________
Something hits Dean in his chest, something big and surprisingly gentle.
Dean looks away at last, taking the fork with him. Just in time for Jo to shove a present under his nose. Dean winces when she drops it on the table.
”The whole night?”
”Yes, your Majesty?” He feels like he does when Mrs. Leonard calls on him during class.
The empty soda can drops with a hollow clink into the trash can. Dean makes a mental note to put the trash out before school tomorrow. The countertop is sticky and smells like alcohol when he runs his hand over it. He grabs some paper towels, cleaning up the spill that Dad probably didn't notice. Sam's eyes bore into him from across the room, but he doesn't say a word.
”I can’t say I understand,” Cas says finally. “I’ve never danced at all.”
A hundred different emotions swarm Castiel's chest, making his throat feel suddenly very small. Dean doesn't seem to notice, gesturing around the rest of the house broadly.
to stop Dean from thinking about his dream.
Castiel waits by the fountain while Sam takes a minute to marvel. He pushes his glasses up and squints across the yard, through the evergreens, to the rose bushes, and the tiger lilies. His mouth falls open. Dean stays behind him, treading carefully over the cobblestone. Castiel knows the moment Sam looks at him, because his jaw goes from slack with wonder, to clamped tight. Castiel gestures for Sam to join him. The rough edge of the fountain is still seeping warmth from the last tendrils of the sunlight. Dean stands on Castiel’s other side.
”Cas!” Her eyes light up when she sees him. She pats the part of the seat next to her. “Have a seat! It’s great to see you again!”
Sam wakes up with no feeling in his toes. He doesn't think he should be surprised, considering the sheet of ice that's covering all the windows.
Dean looks at him, pursing his lips.
Much like Dean's chess skills, when it comes to Cas knowing where things are in the Winchester's kitchen, he has no clue what he's doing. It takes him all of two minutes before whispering frantically to Dean about where he can find whatever he needs.
There aren’t a lot of places for privacy in Dean’s neighborhood, especially on nice nights like tonight, but that doesn’t really bother Dean. It isn’t until his palm starts sweating that he realizes they’ve been holding hands.
. She’s a cold glass of water on a hot afternoon.
“Dean…” Castiel starts. His voice is heavy in his throat. Dean plunks down beside Cas, slinging his arm over the back of the bench so he can finger at the neck of Cas’ coat. Cas turns to him. His eyes, as blue and as serious as the sky, are wet. Cas’ hand comes up, cups Dean’s jaw. “Oh, Dean.”
“Uh. I’ve already met her, dude.”
"Just," Dean says, making Sam turn back to him, "don't make me regret this."
"Eve Eve?" Castiel puzzles, "Isn't that redundant?"
"And then, when I did wake up, hell. It didn't feel real. You didn't feel real. I had now way of knowing you weren't just going to disappear on me again." Dean didn't realize his grip on Sam's shoulder had gone white; Sam hadn't said a thing, if he had noticed.
It hits Dean, huge like a wave or like a thunderclap or like a boy up to his neck in grief. Castiel. The stiff, awkward way he holds himself. The way he stares at Dean like he’s looking through him. His righteous, powerful anger. It's gone. Castiel is dead.
EDITED 2 JULY 2014
“Hi,” He says. A couple classmates say hi back. The bad pronouncer guy smiles at him, nodding a little in a way that says you got this, dude. “Uh, I’m Dean Winchester. My partner Cas...tiel Novak is out sick today, the bastard-- oops. Sorry, teach.” That gets a couple laughs. “Honestly I think he planned it. Getting sick the one day we have to present.” Cas has been out all week, but they don’t need to know that.
She's a thin, spidery woman with a few grey hairs, wearing an outfit that looks more fit for a law firm than a midnight hot cocoa snack. Her eyes are cloudy with the same slant to them as Castiel's. Her eyes always remind Castiel of the weather this time of year: waiting impatiently for an oncoming storm.
Charlie hardly waits to snatch the phone from Dean. Her eager smile melts into a more sincere one the more she reads.
Sam sneers at his homework.
”As many of you may know, the human brain takes about twenty-five years to develop entirely.” Mr. Fueler begins, clicking away idly at his laptop screen. “So those of us around the world who are prone to disease, or starvation, whose lifespans are ultimately shorter, are often unable to develop in the same capacity as the average person.”
A couple of thoughts about this chapter. First, Castiel's conversation with his mother was one of those things that just came out as I was writing the chapter. I had originally fucked up and started writing this chapter from Dean's point of view, so I had to scrap it and start over. Hence, Castiel has a Sad Cry Talk with his mother.
Sam looks over the papers spread across the island. The pale funeral home brochure in front of Castiel. The doctor’s phone numbers. The newsletter from his church, unfolded with information circled in red. Sam pales. Over his shoulder, Dean pales, too.
Dean looks at him. He really looks at Castiel, with wide green eyes and an open mouth. He looks like Castiel is an angel, or more, like Castiel is God Himself. Adra looks at Castiel, with eyes sunk into her head like a dug, waiting grave. Her smile is tight-lipped, but there.
Dean Winchester does what Dean Winchester does: he hits back, fist to Cas’ bony arm.
“Uh. Sort of,” He says. He pulls his phone out, flipping through his photos until he finds it. An outline from the tattoo artist. It’s a pair of wings, spreading from his shoulder blades out to his biceps, but instead of feathers it’s flowers, all different colors, all from different generations of Eden. Hydrangeas, big blue ones, budding closest to his spine. Slender lilies of varying shades, veiny orchids, rich lavender. Several others speckled in with the rest. And forget-me-nots tapering down to his elbow. Vines twine them together.  Castiel’s life project, embedded into Dean’s skin. Adra scans it for a moment, mouthing a few words.
”I am okay, now.” Is the first thing he says, after a very long pause. “Thank you, Dean.”
Sam's voice carries through from the kitchen. He's growing loud, followed by Dad's voice, even louder.
He drops to his knees, reaching under the bed. He gropes around, finding a cardboard box and pulling it out into the light.
”Anna was very,” Castiel stops, tasting his words, “Influential. She often told me she didn’t understand why I followed so many orders. And in turn, I told her I didn’t understand why she didn’t.
”I would certainly hope not.”
“Hey, Ash,” Dean says. His throat is hoarse. Ash sits up, “What’s that joke about the pregnant woman and the duck?” Ash lights up. He dives into the explanation: it was a joke he heard from his brother’s friend at a college party. Jo blows her nose and turns her full attention to Ash. Sam does the same, sitting on the hospital floor cross-legged in front of him. The joke isn’t that good, but it’s something to take everyone’s mind off of, well, everything else. Ash is about to deliver the punchline when he falls silent, staring at a point behind Dean. Dean turns his head around. A tall, unshaven man with a stained grey shirt ambles over.
Dean fights the urge to roll his eyes.

”Yes, ma’am. You got any siblings?”
Charlie offers Jo a hug and Jo leans into it. Charlie murmurs something like, you did good, and rubs Jo’s shoulder. Dean leans behind Charlie and presses his hand into Jo’s back. She is shaking. Sam steps up to the stand, a little blue book in his hand.
”Yeah, he would.” Dean says, thinking for a moment. “I dunno, I guess it’s never been that important to me.” He smiles again; Cas never wants him to stop smiling. The feeling hits Cas in a very real way.
"Shut up, jerk." Sam sticks his tongue out.
When he plops back down, Jo grabs the bottle from him and takes a drink herself, before passing it off to Ash. Sam shoots his brother a disapproving look, and Dean shrugs out an apology. A couple more swallows from the bottle erases his apology completely.
Dean saunters into class a few minutes later, despite leaving Shop at the same time as Castiel. Castiel pointedly doesn't notice him come in, having already engrossed himself into the book. That doesn't stop Castiel from praying, silently, that Dean won't try to make conversation with him.
Dean freezes. His hands fall back to their sides. Cas has turned bright red, looking up at Dean without moving a muscle. Dean sits back down with a
The library is quiet, but not in an eerie way; more that the silence is a constant the building would feel strange without. Dean feels the weight of the silence through the glass door. He sighs, taking a long drag on his cigarette, loving the lightheadedness the smoke gives him. No one else is around, so he takes a couple more lazy puffs. The jittering under his skin cools after the second one, but he finishes the rest of the cig anyway. He stubs the butt out into the ashtray, spits into a nearby bush, and goes inside.
Yeah," Dean sounds far away. There's some shuffling and some background static through the phone line. "Hey, Cas, buddy, I've got to go, my shift is starting." Oh. Something akin to disappointment tugs at Castiel's navel.
Cas does look okay.
“My, my mom used to do this,” Dean says between long, hot breaths over their fingers, “I would throw a damn fit every time it got cold out, so she’d take my hands and blow on ‘em til I could feel my fingers again.” Dean snorts. Castiel gives a small smile, and looks away. Castiel looks back, staring, and tightens his grip on Dean’s hand. He opens his mouth to say something.
"Well I am here. How are you gonna feed it? Where's it gonna go to the bathroom? And what about when Dad gets back?"
The rain is much quieter in the three-story house than it is in a tiny metal car. Through the rain-streaked glass of the front door, he watches the headlights disappear, and he's left alone.
The shot glasses on the counter glisten. Castiel’s heart wrings itself out as he reaches forward to take his shot. Dean is standing a couple of feet away from him, a glint in his eye. He grins at Cas.
”Hang on, Cas, let’s go-- yeah, just-- careful now.” Dean mutters, more to himself than to Castiel, as they shift around so Dean can lean his back against the wall with Cas between his knees. Castiel feels Dean’s breathing in his whole body. His head swims, but Dean is there. Solid.
“Dean,” Castiel sighs and leans up to kiss him. Mine, he thinks. Dean is mine. There’s a moment of hesitation from Dean, but then they’re kissing, moving together. Cas’ lips are chapped and stick to Dean’s, who is sporting a tender blue bruise. Cas kisses it lightly. “I’m sorry,” He murmurs to the bruise.
"Well, fuck me." Dean lets out a low whistle. Cas' cheeks burn. Dean blinks at him, turning red. "It's an expression."
Dean leaves them in the garden.
“Can I…” Dean starts, words sticking in his throat. The couch by the window has a coat slung over the back, “I want to work on the car.” His voice is small, barely above a whisper. Nothing else will come out. Bobby pauses, thinking.
and a seraphim with no voice.
"You know what's weird?" Jess looks at him with wide eyes, not waiting for an answer. "Boys! I swear, I'll never understand boys!"
There’s a moment of shuffle between the first act and the second. Cas steps out, and into the men’s bathroom down the hall. He doesn’t have long. He feels for the inhaler in his pocket, the blue one, and takes a puff. Then the green. In the mirror, his hair is lost the battle with the gel he tried to glob onto it this morning, with one clump sticking up like a ducktail or a low-budget anime protagonist. His cheeks have hollowed. His eyes are his mother’s.
"You, me, Mary Jane. We gonna do this?" She asks, not moving her hand. To answer, Dean kisses her.
”Wow,” Dean mocks offended. “Right when I was gonna be a great brother and pay for your dinner.”
“Dean,” Cas’ voice cuts through the bullshit. Castiel holds his hand out. “Come here.” Castiel is exhausted.
”Hell yeah I am. You should come with us!”
”What?” If the boy is going to be any more difficult, Castiel might just… Well, he doesn’t know what he would do.
He wanders out into the kitchen, where it’s as quiet as a tomb. John hasn’t been around since they got back last night, although Sam vaguely remembers him pulling a red shirt out of the drier, so he’s probably at work for once in his life. It’s a miracle he hasn’t been fired. Sam sighs, blowing hair out of his eyes. His stomach hurts. He hasn’t eaten since they scarfed down something from the hospital cafe after, well, after it happened. At least his salad had been green; Dean’s burger was mushy and Ash’s shake had tasted like spoiled milk. None of them had really had an appetite, anyway.
“Yeah,” Dean says, “I know where to find you.” Bobby hugs him a bit too tight, and then moves on to Sam.
There's a crash from the kitchen, Bobby's dropped something. Or John has.
Dean laughs.
”Dean?” Gilda asks once Ruby is out of earshot, “Isn’t Bobby your uncle?”
Dean sighs. He takes his hands off Cas’ knee and pinches his nose.
His stomach growls, embarrassingly loud under the table. It was early this morning the last time he ate, he realizes. He looks at Cas, who’s blowing on his spoon gently before shoving a very large glob of macaroni in his mouth. He gets some cheese on his lip. Dean swallows.
"Very well."
“Yes, I suppose,” He decides.
He figures it's as good a time as any to get ready. His hands shake as he roots through his dresser drawers, not purely from the cold. His mind strays to Jess, sending a jolt of excited electricity through his whole body. Jess' small laugh, and the way she curls her hands into fists when she's excited about something, fill his mind.
"It was..." Sam falters, "It was stupid, honestly. A nightmare, a freakin' nightmare. But I wouldn't wake up. We were in this little town. Dad took us there once, the place with that lame mystery shack? We were walking down the street, and you... There was a car, came out of nowhere." Sam inhales sharply. "It happened so many times. It was a car, or a safe dropped on you, or you got shot, or-- I couldn't wake up.
”I didn’t know your uncle was in charge of your punishments.” Cas says.
“Then there is no ‘might’ about it, Castiel. You have them. They are yours, now and forever.”
“Does he have a name?” Adra asks, holding her fingers out to the cat. Here is where Dean flushes.
Jo, as it turns out, is the third act, not the first. The first is a large woman in a suit similar to Ellen’s, playing a flute duet with a much smaller pianist in plain, concert black. It’s a lovely piece, and Cas is so enraptured he almost forgets to clap at the end.
“The doctor said I have an infection,” Cas says, choosing his words carefully, “Burkholderia cenocepacia. In a healthy person, this would be nothing. But in someone, someone like me…”
places,” he remarks, smirking. “Yeah, just shut up and eat it, kiddo.” He mocks, in a voice that sounds more like his father than he wants to admit.
Dean takes his hand. It’s cold. Castiel twines their fingers together. Dean brings them up to his mouth and blows hot air on both of them.
“Dean,” Dean bites,  “Castiel’s, uh, friend.” Luke’s eyes widen a fraction, then settle, as if he understands what Dean means. Dean swallows.
Castiel, the love of Dean’s damn life.
Sam smiles. Gabe mews.
“Well hey,” Dean interjects, flipping his phone out of his pocket, “Ash and Jo are coming over tonight, so we won't be totally alone.” Sam perks up. Dean squats down next to him, flinching when the cat rubs its face against his knee. “And you know, if you're good I may just let you stay with us.” They both smile, “But, y'know, not next to Jo or anything. Don't want to make Jess jealous.” Sam turns away, trying to hide the blush creeping up his cheeks.
"Well, Merry Christmas." He says.
"You alright, boy?" Bobby takes a pause to look up at Dean, who unwittingly takes a step back.
"Hey Sam." Jess' voice is quiet. She leans closer to him and Sam's heart starts to beat faster. There's an edge in her tone. "You know you're not a freak, right?"
Dean stands. He pushes down on the table like he can tether their conversation to the ground if he pushes hard enough.
"Hello?" The voice on the other end of the line is quiet. She sounds tired.
But Dean isn’t the one dying here, even though he feels like it.
”Lay it on me, Sammy,” Dean says, patting his tummy.
Castiel looks away before Dean does. He breathes. Short, regulated. Like a soldier. He swallows his cough back into his throat.
Usually, Dean spends a few minutes walking around all the shaky plots of land, considering headstones or family graves. But with Sam beside him and the distinct chill in the air, he doesn't bother. The plot they head to is one of the least worn; Mary didn't have a whole lot of family when she was alive, anyway. Her headstone is still smooth.
Oh. Dean stops. He really doesn't know what to say.
. Castiel stops himself from clenching his fist. Thankfully, the cough only lasts just as long. Castiel breathes in: sawdust and apathy. Holds it for one, two, three seconds before breathing out. It feels nothing like relief. He takes a long sweep around the room with his eyes: no one seems the least bit disturbed. He feels as if something in his chest desperately wants to shake loose. With a frustrated sigh, he folds the sheet of looseleaf in half and drops it in the recycling.
”Have a bite,” he insists, “For me.”
She walks away. Castiel holds his breath.
It’s not like Dean’s never had a sex dream before. If anything, he’s the master of having sex dreams. Celebrities, attractive people on the street, Jace, have all shown up in his head before. That’s nothing new. But never like this. Not like this.
Dean takes the seat next to Jo, bumping elbows with her when he sits down. Across from him, Sam and Jess both give him a look. Dean's phone buzzes in his pocket.
”When he died, I… Everywhere I turned, there was mourning. I couldn’t escape it. It made me realize that I did not want anyone to feel that way because of me, I wouldn’t be able to handle it.” Castiel feels like the weight of an entire ocean has drained out of him. “I did not want to cause any more pain.”
“I’ve been thinking about a tattoo,” Dean admits, leaning away from Adra. It’s been more than thinking. Adra blinks and nods him on. Dean’s chest tightens, “Uh. For Castiel. I really like going through Eden and like, seeing all the work he put in. He used to say Eden would outlast him, you know? And I want to immortalize that.”
One of the girls patrolling stops at their table. Castiel recognizes her from Shop; her name is Jace.
Dean gets up from his chair, stretching. Sam stirs in his sleep, but Cas remains still. As quietly as he can manage, Dean treads softly over to the living room. Cas' journal lays on his chest, flipped closed. He has a blue pen that's slipping slowly from between his two middle fingers. Dean holds his breath and takes the pen, setting it down on the coffee table. He looks back at Cas: the crinkles on the edges of his eyes are more relaxed, his lips are parted just so. Standing so close to him, Dean can feel the heat rolling off him.
Dean isn’t sure how long he sits there studying Cas, but before he knows it, Sam is setting a very large bowl of macaroni down in front of him. The gooey cheese on top is shining; Dean can nearly see his reflection in it. He digs in, and almost immediately spits it back out.
”Hang on, Cas. I’m not done yet,” Sam smiles. “Anyway, flash forward to Dean’s birthday this year. I’m flipping through the paper, like I do, and guess what I see?” Cas raises his eyebrows. “An article. Seventeen-year-old Megara Masters, given a full ride to some nursing program out in Cali. That night at the bus station, she had told me she was gonna find her cause and serve it. And I guess she did.” Meg’s eyes had been green.
"Yes, sir."
Flowers sprung from his hands where he worked.
The lights drop, and all conversation hushes.
"Christmas, duh. Everyone else gets one."
”I swear, these things are half of why I started working here.”
"It's been a very long time." Cas shifts uncomfortably, shoving his hands into his coat pockets. They clasp around his inhaler. "But in light of recent events it seems I'm back to my old habit." He digs his hands deeper into his pockets. It isn't until he catches Dean's mournful look that he realizes just how much sorrow he must have held in his voice. Snow clings to Dean's hair like it's meant to be there. He puts a hand on Cas' shoulder, and it's then that Cas first wants to kiss him.
Out in the parking lot, he finds Dean leaning back on the hood of the Impala, idly flicking a lighter on and off. The heat makes a small ripple in the air above him, although Dean is more fixated on the flame. Cas stands in silence for a moment, watching his friend's thumb glide back and forth over the safety.
The heat makes him shift uncomfortably; it's growing close to the point where he'll have to take his coat off. Inside, he cringes.
Dean stands in the doorway to the Novak's house with a ratty duffel bag under one arm and stack of papers under the other. His clothes are dirty and his hair is a mess. Castiel's heart stops when he opens the door for Dean.
Dean rolls his eyes and gropes around for a tissue. Gabe bats around at something on the floor. It feels like there's a ball of lead in Dean's stomach, watching Gabe jump up and down and pounce on the old pizza crust.
”Your date.” Sam looks up from the recipe book and makes a motion towards the table. Oh. Dean turns.
”What?” Dean echoes. “That’s ridiculous!” He stands up. “Get up!”
Castiel lowers himself back onto the bed. He puts his inhaler on top of the book, lest he need it again. Dean positions himself over Castiel again, but lower, so his mouth is parallel with the bright scar climbing Castiel’s hipbone. Dean’s breath is warm over Cas’ damaged skin. He kisses a long, slow line from the top of Cas’ hip to the edge of his pants. Cas takes the hint and shimmies out of them, leaving only his blue boxers and the cool night air between them. Dean kisses down the sharp line of Cas’ hips, tonguing at Cas’ scar a little more until Cas bucks his hips against Dean’s throat.
Not the most eloquent, but he figures he should bring it up sooner or later.
"I said shut up, Dean!"
Cas thinks. One of Dean’s arms is tucked under the pillow, the other falls over his side and hangs there, knuckles brushing the blankets. His whole body loosens when he sighs. Cas lies on his back, shifting his shoulders towards Dean.
Hi all! I hope you're surviving well. This is a quick end note -- I have begun rewriting this fic! I'n publishing it under the title "65 Roses" which you can find
”Castiel, you really need to talk some manners into this boy! Interrupting a lady while she’s talking, what a cretin!”
Castiel tells himself, breathing in all the way down to the bottom of his lungs and back out. His stomach pangs again, and with a jolt, he realizes it isn't only nerves. He slides his hands up and down the lapels of his coat, wringing his hands.
, the red-yellow stained sink taunts.
”Shut the fuck up,” Dean rolls his eyes. He feels some of the tension bleed out from his shoulders. He turns back to the Harvelle’s, clapping his hands together. “I seriously… I can’t thank you guys enough.”
is written on the inside. He closes it again; the look he’s getting from Cas tells him he should wait. The CDs are all new, not stolen from thrift store like all his others.
chapter warnings: coughing fits, mucus/unsanitary conditions, sickness, and slight unreality
"That will not be necessary." Cas says, flipping a couple of pages in a large 3-ring binder.
Dean thinks.
Charlie snatches the phone and answers it before Dean can even put his burger down.
”Alright, easy girl, easy,” Charlie coaxes, pulling Leia off him. “Save some for the rest of us.”
“Ch’yeah it is. She’s not too keen on most people knowing, but she wanted you guys to come.” Ellen’s eyes sparkle. “Ash, too, but he had a thing.”
“Dean. We are… in the middle of something,” Adra says uncertainly. Castiel can see his mother’s hand clench and unclench as she decides what to do. She looks back at Castiel. Cas nods minutely, “But it can wait. Come in, boys. ”
"Dean, get me some ibuprofen."
“I’m glad you asked,” Castiel says, “I had accompanied my mother on one of her business trips. This time we were in France. It was my first time, and it was a really lovely experience. But I got sick, as I am wont to do. It was only a cold, but I was the most miserable bastard on the whole continent. So, my mother cut her trip short and took me home.
Sam pays attention most of class, until his phone buzzes in his pocket.
"Cas!" Dean calls, rolling down the passenger side window. Cas turns to him, startled like a deer in headlights.
as if she's whistling through her teeth, “A bad one, as far as I can tell.” She peers over to Castiel's desk, squinting slightly as she tries to make out what's scrawled on the paper. “What are you writing?” Castiel's chest clenches, and he wants, juvenilely, to cover the paper with his arms.
”Oh, hey Cas,” Sam waves. Cas waves back, sheepish. “Not long, just gonna get some stuff and then we’re heading back out. Jess’ mom is waiting outside.”
He progresses to the kitchen, where Gabe is sleeping on the table and Sam is petting him with one hand. A baseball game plays on the TV; Dean recognizes the announcer’s voice, but doesn’t process anything he’s saying. John is on the couch with his feet up on the new coffee table, nursing a beer.
“I can drop you off.” Dean says. This catches Castiel by surprise. Dean glaces to Sam for confirmation. “C'mon.” He gestures to Castiel's soggy umbrella. "You really think that thing is gonna keep you dry?"
"Yes." Dean holds his between his first two, Cas notes.
”Samandriel was…” The past tense hurts Cas in a way he had all but forgotten. “Everyone loved him. That was just a fact. He was very kind. I do not think there was a single day that passed when I did not see him smiling. He was a writer, too. I was in recovery for an appendectomy, and he would visit my room as often as he could. We would write together, share stories. We visited each other outside of the hospital, too. That was the first time I ever really had someone. We spent much of our time in Eden.” And the second photograph comes out: two boys standing in Eden, both with their arms around the other’s shoulders. Samandriel has a blue rosary hanging around his neck, and Castiel has his new trenchcoat on. Samandriel has a peach fuzz layer of hair, now. Castiel’s face is flushed.
and .
”So Jo helped you out?”
“Sammy,” He says. Jo whips out her phone.
Sam plops down on his bed, keeping one eye on the clock beside him, and dives into the book. The spine cracks and the smell of worn-out pages fills him.
Ash leans over the arm of the couch to grab a forgotten slice of pizza, and nearly falls over. Dean puts a hand on his shoulder to steady him.
”S’chicken soup. Canned. Not as good as you coulda made, I’m sure.” Dean chuckles to himself. “I had to call Sammy for help. Don’t tell anyone, I wouldn’t live it down.”
It's nearly ten minutes into the drive that Dean realizes he turned the wrong way coming out.
"Outside?" Brady asks, stretching one arm behind his head.
“It’s fine, Sam,” Cas says. He gives Sam a long look. Sam rubs one of his eyes with the heel of his hand. “Sam,” Castiel breathes, “I would like you to pray with me.”
He swaggers into the lunch room and the familiar aroma of shitty food and teenagers greets him. He spots Jo at their usual table in the corner, listening half-heartedly to one of Ash's alien abduction theories. Ash is a year older than them, and has been sporting a mullet since seventh grade. Today, he's tied the 'party' part into a short braid. When Dean slides up, Ash is busy telling Jo that the pyramids were built by aliens. "No, seriously."
"Didn't mean to! Right, yeah, like I haven't heard that one before."
”Hell yeah I did. I wouldn’t miss this for the world.”
Only a handful of stars can be seen through all the city lights. Laying back in his seat, Dean looks out the side window. Beside him, he feels Cas move his seat back and do the same, until they're both leaning back and looking at the stars.
win, you're gonna let me cook dinner for a week."
“Hey, Adra,” Dean asks, swallowing his pasta. He puts his fork down and spins his ring. Adra looks at him, “I was wondering about your tattoo.” Dean gestures to the curling script around Adra’s wrist. She has a dark green bracelet on, covering some of it up. Rosary beads. Adra slides the beads down closer to the cuff of her shirt.
”I do remember Gabriel talking about it, but to be honest, I tuned him out much of the time.” Cas looks sheepish. “A ten-year-old Castiel could only take so much Gabriel.”
Castiel grins.
”Aren’t you working now?” Charlie reminds her.
“She’d be sick! You know that, don’t you?” Dean asks. He doesn’t give his father time to answer. A single tear has started to leak out. “Fuck you. He doesn’t deserves this.” Dean chokes.
“Y-yeah. Yeah, I’d like that.”
“Jo,” Castiel says. He doesn’t move to touch her, but he looks at her intently. Jo squeezes her eyes shut, “I am glad I got to see you play.”
“Don’t start without me.” He must’ve sounded tired, because Adra’s face appears at the bottom of the stairs, lips pursed and arms crossed.
"I was trying to make breakfast."
Sammy is sitting on the front steps of the school entrance when Dean pulls up. Dean doesn't even try, just hands Sam the bouquet: roses, and something Susan or another. Mary always liked yellow flowers.
Dean sits, looking over all the photographs that have been laid out. Castiel sits, looking at Dean.
When it gets to the scene at prom, with all the glowing lanterns and short, frilly dresses, Dean is rather unhappy.
"Yeah," Dean crinkles his nose, "We ran out of hot chocolate." Cas turns to Dean and gives him a look.
“Jessica,” Sam says. He barely hears himself. It’s Castiel. It’s Castiel. It’s
"Dean." Cas tries to make a point, but it falls flat.
"That's just Brady being Brady. He's a dick, yeah, but I live with it. It's like Dean--"
"Your two favorite ladies." Dean laughs.
Once the heat's turned down and the macaroni is cooking away, he puts his hands into his pockets.
"Hey Cas! Merry Christmas!" Castiel doesn't want to point out that Christmas isn't for another couple of days, so he simply smiles back. Without warning, Dean takes Cas' messenger bag out of his hand and throws it down on the couch right where Sam is laying. Sam coils inward with an
Sam mumbles something that Cas doesn’t catch. The boys shuffle in.
There is a creak behind him, of someone opening the stall door and standing behind him. Castiel shudders, his eyes shut tight, listening to the boy’s breathing. The boy crouches down.
”Man, you know who’d love these?” He asks through a mouthful of peanut butter, “Cas. He adores all these sweets, I think he got it from --” He swallows, not realizing what he was about to say. Charlie looks at him.
"Neither of us saw the bookshelf," Sam apologizes, scratching Rummy behind the ears. Dean gives him a look.
Sam turns back to his friend, who’s pulling something out from under his shirt. His rosary, blue and glittering in the light. He passes it over to Sam, crucifix swinging like a pendulum. There are letters etched into the beads.
Dean looks. The kitchen is empty.
"Do you
“Hello, Dean, Jo,” Castiel coughs, “Ash,” Dean can’t move. His feet have been cemented to the floor. He thought he’d gotten used to the sight of Castiel in the hospital bed, his body disappearing into the scratchy sheets and the paper gown. But now, Dean thinks with a lump rising in his throat, Castiel looks so, so tired. “I feel remarkably human,” Castiel half-chuckles, half-coughs.
"I would love to help."
Mine. Castiel lets the word sit in his mouth. Without warning, thunder by way of a sob opens in Cas’ throat. Thunder, and enough rain to water all of Eden. He did not think he was in drought. His friends are his. They are his.
”Dad can give you the recipe, if you want.”
“Hey, don't look at me! I gave it to Dean for his birthday!” Jo defends. Ash just shakes his head, disappointed. Dean thinks he hears the guy mutter 'typical'. Which, really, it shouldn't be a surprise any more. Every movie or video game that got handed to one of them was passed through all of them at least twice. Dean remembers his birthday, and wondering why the DVD case looked so used.
”That’s okay, I’m here for Sam and Gabe anyway.”
Dean’s chest hurts in an unexpected way typing that reply. Something in him aches for Castiel.
”I--” Dean pauses. “I know, I’m just helping you out. Date etiquette.”
"Since we're already up." Sam adds. Dean stretches, his spine cracking against the back of the chair. Sam flips the lights on.
“It’ll be done when it’s done,” Sam snaps from his place at the table. Dean tenses.
“Yeah,” Dean says. His voice is hollow, “Thanks.” He starts towards the open door.
"Yeah. Yeah, sure. No problem," Dean checks his watch. "You okay? Are you ready to head back?" He raises his eyebrows again. Castiel draws in a breath slowly, wiping his hands on a paper towel.
“It is now. We… We have just made up,” he says.
He poured sunshine into every corner,
In all honestly, Castiel is not sure how he got to be lying down on the couch. The only thing he is really aware of is that the couch smells like
Chapter contains mentions of smoking (cigarettes), terminal disease, and other related themes.
”Dean,” Cas starts, clearing his throat. Dean turns to face Cas, winding up with his back against the countertop. Heat is pooling off both of them. Castiel tilts his head, leaning closer. “The flowers.” His voice is little more than a whisper. It does not have to be any louder, with how close they are. “Why did you…” Cas’ heart is thumping in his chest; He can feel Dean’s breath ghosting across him. Sweet, he smells sweet, and very Dean. Cas goes up on his tip-toes to get that much closer.
and that’s all Dean needs to know.
It's well passed midnight by the time Dean sneaks Sam's present out to the living room. Despite having only a burned nub of a tree left, Dean still manages to put his presents under it. There are already a couple presents there, wrapped carefully in old newspaper comics. Outside, it's still snowing; moonlight streams into the window through the white, fluffy haze. Cas watches Dean put the presents under the tree carefully, then rub his eyes and let out a large yawn.
"Nice of you to show up, John."
he looks at the calendar hanging above his desk. It’s February ninth.
“Yeah, I’ve seen him. But it’s just Cas, dude. Your --” Sam darts a look at the TV, “best friend. He’ll be fine.”
"What's it look like?" Dean chuckles, "We're making breakfast, duh." Sam glares at him.
Dean seems to see the board at the same instant Castiel does. They make eye contact, shuffling closer together. Dean gives Castiel a once-over, and Castiel does his best not to stare. They drop their book-bags down at the closest pair of desks, keeping a good two feet between each other. It's the first time Castiel has to study the boy up close, so he takes a moment to look at him: his leather jacket is more worn up close, although Castiel is in no position to judge him for his fashion choices. It looks as if Dean has a perpetual sneer set in his face. A chill runs down Castiel when Dean looks up at him.
"Yes." He looks Dean up and down quickly. "Is there a problem?" Dean waves his hand dismissively.
"I didn't know that you smoked."
“No buts. Go.” Dean crosses his arms. Dejected, Sam scoffs at him. The door slams. “And dad.
"Could you be any more of a baby?" Dean chides, getting into the car.
"Huh? Yeah, no, I'm fine," he insists. He drives.
runs through Sam.
Dean tries to glare, but he’s caught by another cough. He doesn’t loosen his grip on Cas’ shoulder.
“Is this the whole family?” He asks, glancing at Dean and Sam. The crease between his brows deepens.
The air is sprinkled with a few drops of cold rain, enough for the hairs on his neck to stand up. He feels at ease, climbing out onto the rooftop, even when he starts to shiver. Something light and rectangular bumps against his hip from inside the pocket of his coat. His phone, he supposes. He shrugs it off. He sits down on the already damp rooftop, the rough gravel shingles sticking pebbles to his palm.
"So, Dean," Castiel starts, then tells his friend what he overheard on the way to the car.
One of the trailers in Dean’s neighborhood still has their Christmas lights up, dangling unlit in the late afternoon light. Cas treads slowly between the houses. He coughs several times along the way, even stopping once to collect himself. His hand never leaves Dean’s arm. It’s years of slow, trudging steps until they reach the bench, shrouded in trees. It’s the same bench they sat at months ago, when Castiel admitted the first time he was sick. Where they went after their first date. Dean would take the frosty cold, the wind stuck in his throat. Anything,
Cas pauses, considering the red-faced, shaky Dean in front of him. He considers the weight looming in his chest, the way he feels
Dean turns back. Opens his mouth, pauses, and closes it. But Castiel watches Dean's hand's move, digging into his pocket and pulling out a square of paper. He holds it out for Castiel.
“I was laid up in my bed for two weeks, maybe more. I don’t recall. I had a view of the backyard from my bed, and all day I would spend staring at it, wondering what that barren place would look like full of life. I thought that that was how God felt when He created His garden. So when I was better, I named it Eden and I got to work.”
." He huffs. "And trust me, I know a lot about not being okay." But Dean doesn't know. He has no idea, not like this.
"Fine." Dean nearly spits the word out of his mouth. "The cat can stay." Sam's anger evaporates instantaneously. "But you've gotta be the one to take care of him. And he's only here 'til Dad gets back."
"Heya Sammy," Dean greets his brother. And sure enough, Sam slides into Castiel's view with a stack of six or seven books in tow.
Castiel isn’t in class the Wednesday they have to present the project. Dean expected this. The only contact he’d gotten from Cas the last week was an email sent at three in the morning, with the essay they’d written attached, and nothing else. Cas usually had a signature, one of those automatic ones, and Dean chuckles to think Cas went through the effort to delete it before sending.
The rain on Castiel’s face from Jo’s recital reappears and falls to the back of his bruised hands.
"Hey, it's almost the New Year, do you want to call your mom?" He asks his friend. Cas thinks for a moment.
"Shut it." Sam warns. Dean ignores him.
Castiel wishes him a good evening anyway, when Dean pulls up into the driveway.
"Sam," He figures that's as good a place to start as any. "What do you say we head to the Roadhouse? Or Bobby's?" Jo's mom, Ellen, owns the Roadhouse Bar and Grill a few miles down the road that they frequent when their dad is out. "We can give dad time to cool off." Sam nods, more to the book in his lap than to Dean. He'll take it. "Cool. Alright, get a bag. I'll give Bobby a call."
"Who's your pastor? Wait-- did you go to church with Bobby?"
Dean ambles back to the coffin room a little while later, feeling lighter. Sam nods to him as he takes his place back in line. At one point, a kid a few years older than Dean joins the queue. He’s tall and skinny, with golden-brown hair and a sharp scowl. Dean’s stomach squeezes as the young man sweeps his eyes over the crowd, and the coffin, but Dean can’t figure out why. He keeps an eye on the man as he makes his way through the queue. Adra gives him a long look, too, and makes a face when Dean looks over at her. Dean shrugs. At the casket, the man says a short prayer and whispers something to Castiel, touches his hand.
A Sam interlude.
Castiel. Castiel is inside this pale coffin of a building. It doesn’t seem possible. Dean halts with one foot on a stair and one on the ground. Sam bumps into him. Adra turns around. She has the same downturned eyes that Castiel does. Did. But hers sink in her head and are grey like the clouds looming above them. She holds out her hand. Dean sighs all the way down in his stomach. He wants to run. He steps up and takes her slender, veiny hand.
"Hey, Castiel," Sam says with a smile, still a little flushed.
He swallows the unpleasant thought and looks at Sam, grimaces in solidarity. Dean insisted he stay the night last night, despite Cas having an appointment that afternoon and wanting nothing more than the warmth of his own bed. Dean even helped Cas pack a bag, although Cas now suspects it was less out of goodwill and more out of Dean’s cunning plan to get them all into, as Sam called them, monkey suits. Dean woke both Sam and him up as the sun was coming up, with coffee and burnt eggs, saying they had to look their absolute best for today. Mr. Winchester had said something to Dean over coffee that Castiel couldn’t hear, and it put Dean in a bad mood for all of five minutes, until he was reminded what
"What, did you finally run out of your own clothes?" Sam asks Cas. Cas looks up from his cup, startled, as if he didn't notice Sam come in.
"Hey, Sammy," Dean puts his hands down on the table and leans on them. His spine pops pleasantly. "You wanna play a round of poker?" Sam's grin could split his face in two.
The trees are tall, too. For a moment, they look like they're bending inward, like going through a tunnel. A tunnel of tall trees and large houses.
(See the end of the chapter for
from where Dean’s standing in the living room.
Jess comes into the room, holding Sam's gift in her hands.
"Alright, Sam. Go to your room."
"You know that was an accident, right, Cas?" He asks, not taking his eyes off the tree.
Dean kisses him like it’s the first time.
," Castiel says.
Unsure of what to say, Dean just watches him walk up the steps into his house.
sits very warmly in his chest.
The cigarette itself is much less stale and bitter than the one Cas had earlier. It makes him feel full. Or maybe it's just Dean beside him that does that.
And all at once, the attention is on Castiel. He stands still with his hands at his side while both pairs of eyes in the room appraise him. Cas' heart lurches in his throat when he meets Dean's eyes.
“No, it’s fine.” He says. His chest feels tight. “I’m sorry, Cas.”
He throws himself up to a standing ovation. Others stand as well. Dean whistles. Jo beams, and flushes when she catches Cas’ eye. Then she bows, and exits.
He gets neither, standing up and walking over to the kitchen, his inhaler bumping against his leg. Sam is hanging tiny Christmas trees on the drawer handles.
”Shit,” Dean swears. It’s more disbelief than anything; Gerry was a mean one, if Charlie’s tales rang true. Doing experiments on rats and spending-all-day-on-4chan kind of mean.
“I love you,” one of them murmurs, although for the life of him Castiel could not say who.
“Not all the time,” He says, finally, “Not forever.” With a grimace, Dean takes the toolbox outside.
“Sorry I'm late,” Dean lies. Castiel makes eye contact and sets down his book.
“This entire book is something Victor says.” Dean huffs. He closes his book and slides off the bed on Cas’ side. Cas twiddles with his pen, his tongue sticking between his teeth. Dean doesn’t like how skeletal Cas’ whole face has looked lately, but that flash of pink lets him shove off that thought for later. Cas is sitting cross-legged, as usual, and Dean slides his hands up to Cas’ knees. “C’mon, a break.” He raises his eyebrows when Cas finally looks up at him. Cas stops what he’s doing and closes the book. Dean breaks into a crooked smile.
"I should call Bobby," Dean comments, moving his hand off of Sam's shoulder to dig his phone out. He doesn't bother to pause the movie. "Gotta find out what Dad's doing about this storm."
If Dean could have his way, his birthday would have come and gone without so much as a mention. But of course, he has no such luck. Being related to Sam will do that to you.
It starts slow, a one-handed melody almost like a scale with a few extras thrown in. Then it builds, bringing both her gloved hands onto the keys. Up and down, fluttering, flying over the piano. All the while her face is set in a concentrated frown, her dark eyebrows tight, but her shoulders relaxed. The song makes Castiel think of children, running in a garden of a big stone house, screeching in laughter, as they are eventually caught in the rain. They’re not discouraged, though, they only laugh harder and kick the mud up around their knees.
Being shirtless in front of Dean Winchester is a much different experience when Dean himself is also sans shirt. Dean is not lean, Cas notices, possessing a very square figure. He has more than a few scars littering his chest and abdomen. Absently, Cas rubs a spot across his own lower stomach.
Castiel feels Dean hesitate on the last group, rubbing his thumb along the pale blue flowers as if he knows already what they mean. A cluster of blue flowers each with five petals and a ring of bright yellow in the center.
"Whatever, Doctor Bad Ass. What are we gonna watch on Friday?" Jo looks over to Dean and Castiel. Castiel only looks at her, confused, until Dean turns towards him.
He steals a swig of water from a sleeping orc’s canteen. The air in the tent is sticky. He swirls the water around in his mouth before swallowing. There’s quiet chatting throughout the tent. The handsome elf waves Dean over.
"Dean, you finished the--"
“Dean, get your feet off the table, come on,” The teacher barks at the student. That's his name-- Dean. Castiel hadn't known. Dean, rolls his eyes and swings his legs down. He catches Castiel's gaze for a moment. Castiel can feel his blood sting in his veins. Something about him rubs Castiel the wrong way. Not that it really matters to him; by this time tomorrow they would be erased entirely to each other and would move on with their lives.
staring at him when he opens the bag. Cracking open the worn cover, he takes his pen out and clicks it three times before writing his name on the title page. He runs his thumb down the flimsy page. It crinkles under his touch. Across the field, a small gaggle of kids are making their way over to the shop building.
"Yes." Castiel nods. Dean hesitates before he turns away, as if there's something more he meant to say. "Is there something else, Dean?"
Dean makes another few rounds from table to washing machine, when Adra’s car finally, finally pulls up. Dean yanks the door open almost before Cas gets up the steps. There’s a pleasant breeze wafting through the trailer park, whipping one of the neighbor kid’s hair back as he circles around his house on his bike. Castiel is bound in a thick, dark grey sweatshirt, and his trenchcoat. He isn’t smiling.
he thinks. Silence hangs in front of him. He hears John shift in his sleep and snore.
Dean can hear Cas breath out slowly.
“It is upstairs, in his room.” Castiel’s room. The one place Dean hasn’t been back to. Dean nods, thumbing at his ring, “I will not be offended if you went now. I have to get ready for work soon.” Dean glances at his watch. Adra doesn’t leave for another hour. Adra looks at Dean, her eyes crinkled around the edges. She’s giving him an opportunity. She’ll be here if he needs it. Dean nods.
”Yeah, why?”
Dean has his ratty bookbag, no doubt empty of all books, slung over one shoulder. He discards it at the foot of Cas’ bed and Castiel has time to blink before Dean is hovering over him, his hands on either side of Cas’ body. There is a yellowing bruise just under Dean’s eye, and an angry red scab overlapping it. Dean’s breath is warm on Cas’ face.
"That reminds me," Sam looks up, "are we gonna get a tree this year?"
watching
“Yeah. Thanks, dude,” Sam says. The calendar on his wall hasn’t been changed yet.
“Xopenex.”
"No." Castiel squints at the boy. Dean leans back, giving Castiel room to breathe. "Thank you, though." He adds.
“That was Jim,” Adra says, clicking her phone off and setting it down on the island. She stares at it’s dark face for a long moment, and then up to Castiel, “He can come by this Friday.  I figured you would want to do it here, and not a stuffy hospital room.”
God, everything feels good. Dean's teeth start to buzz when he passes the bowl over to Jace, who takes a long inhale, blowing a smoke ring up to the ceiling.
“Hey dad,” Dean calls, grabbing a couple of Cokes out of the fridge and handing one to Sammy. Dad, he realizes, is fast asleep.  A half-empty beer can rests between his elbow and the arm of the couch.  Dean grimaces, setting the can on the coffee table.
“What else is family for, dude?” Ash asks, his voice breaking. They stay like that for a minute. Slowly, he lets his hand fall from Castiel’s. Jo steps up. She keeps her hands by her side, clenching them into a fist. Castiel coughs. Some of the monitors beep.
"Uh, I think so? That's when your lungs--"
"Well," Dean thinks for a second, "His name's Castiel,--" Bobby raises an eyebrow-- "and he kinda stares a lot, you know? Seems really arrogant, too. He's just weird."
”Hey Sammy. Uh, how long are you here for?”
Brady isn't the last to finish the run, despite having to go twice as far. Once Brady finishes and can breathe again, he wolf-whistles Sam's ponytail; the two boys chit chat idly, both praying to go back inside soon.
Thunder explodes in the sky over the house.
“Dean,” Castiel says. He squeezes Dean’s hand, hard, not at all comforting. He coughs. “Shut up.”
Dean sighs, giving Cas a long look. "You remember that school back in Maryland? The one we were at for like, two weeks?" Sam squints. He remembers, barely. The school had a bunch of yellow and blue jump ropes in the gym. "Anyway, they had a fund-raiser for cystic fibrosis, and I stole that stuffed bear for you 'cause you didn't win anything."
“Oh. Yeah. I can do that,” He says.
There’s a woman with graying hair and a red scarf sitting in the front seat. It’s been a while since Sam’s seen anyone but Dean next to Cas in the car.
He tries to get his attention back on the book, which lasts all of thirty seconds before he checks his phone, or the clock, or the cute librarian. Once, his glance skirts over Castiel, who's also looking up at him from his book. Their eye contact holds for much longer than necessary. Dean sets his jaw, forces himself to look away. The jingling of his keys gets louder.
English is one of the few dual-taught classes Dean has run into during his three years in high school. Ms. Nisbet and Mrs. Leonard are both fresh out of college and have an inane passion for literature. As Dean walks in, the class is already chatty and someone's stuck a cucumber to the front chalkboard. Dean takes the seat two rows behind his friend Jo.
“Yes?” Nisbet says into the receiver. She glances in Dean’s direction, “Uh, yes, they’re here. What? What? Well... Fine. Okay. Yes. Thank you.” She hangs up. Nisbet turns to the class, but her eyes hone in on Dean.
"What's up?" Dean asks, folding his arms over his chest.
"Good morning, Sam," Cas whispers, his voice rough with lack of sleep. Sam startles, jumping and turning to face Castiel.
“It sucked,” Sam says, scowling, scratching Gabe’s butt, “But at least no one was fighting. Or drunk.” He points out. Mary’s funeral had been a disaster. Bobby had to escort a belligerent, drunk and swearing John out of the chapel halfway through. They finished the funeral without him.
Sam waves him a goodbye when they get to the school, a couple of his friends already waiting on the front steps for him. Dropping Sam off at the middle school is the only reason Dean gets up so early in the morning. He doesn't bother much with his own classes, he usually takes a smoke break out by the Seven-Eleven before sauntering into Shop halfway through the lesson. When Sam is too sick to get out of bed, Dean doesn't show up at all. The teachers hardly expect anything more from him.
"It's fine," Jace rolls her eyes, "You okay today?" Her tone is sweet and it doesn't suit her. Dean feels himself bristle.
Shit, shit. Dean’s back aches.
”That old white church in town, the one off Winter’s Lane?”
Jo waves to Dean and Cas, and Ash gives Dean a fist-bump before heading down the hall. Dean bumps Cas' shoulder, and walks with him.
Standing, his knees creak. He swears, and it echoes in the empty space. On Castiel’s desk, he sees it. A handful of blue pens in a wire basket. In front of it, a black leather journal, the one Dean gave Cas for Christmas. On top is a sticky note, in Cas’ handwriting. To Dean. Dean goes over, hands shaking, heart hammering. The spine cracks like it’s been waiting for him. It’s heavier than when Dean gifted it; the pages are bursting, some sticky notes and a paperclip jut from the edges. Dean opens to the first page. In neat, blue letters:
Goes back into the kitchen anyway.
Standing to stretch makes Castiel's chest feel heavy, but he shrugs it off and slips his book into his jacket pocket.
”Damn, Cas, I should take you out more often, if Sam’s feeding us like this.”
”Been real good,” he nods.
. Shadows pass in front of him. Boots churn up the dirt. Running. A voice. Charlie. Charlie’s voice.
”The one last weekend? It went fine, although I am on a higher dosage of a couple of my medicines, now.”
Before anyone has the chance to say anything else, Bobby comes out holding a pot of soup between two mismatched oven mitts. Rummy, sitting at Jo's feet, whines. Whatever conversations had been developing are put on hold while everyone slurps their soup. Hasn't changed in five minutes, Dean thinks thankfully, digging in.
”Thank you, Jo.” He feels himself relax a fraction. He sits down and unzips his lunch bag, taking out some overcooked tortellini and incredibly rubbery string beans, his addition to the potluck.
"Sorry, Sammy. Just--" He chuckles some more, apparently unable to contain himself. "Jeez, Cas." He shakes his head. Castiel smiles, despite not quite knowing what's so funny.
”Are you ready to tear this movie a new one with me?”
"Very well." She turns to go. Dean gives Cas a thumbs up and ushers him in to the house.
A tentative revival to this story.
Everyone sits down, Cas at Dean’s right and Sam at Dean’s left. Jo gives him a look that he ignores. Sam cuts the first slice of cake for Dean. It’s not as good as Bobby’s cake, but nothing’s ever as good as Bobby’s cake. Even John, who hates sweets, takes up a slice. Cas is staring at his cake with a distant expression. Dean’s heart squeezes.
Castiel sighs. He picks at a scar on the kitchen table, balances the salt shaker on the back of his good hand.
”Awesome.”
Dean wants to say something else, but he closes his phone and picks his book back up.
“And they know you, don’t they?” Adra asks.
He grabs his phone off the floor.
Dean makes a noise like a question and Cas replies in affirmation.
They both eat in silence, the heater in the corner blasting white noise and far-too-hot air around their house. Once they finish eating, they find themselves sliding into the front seats of their '67 Chevy Impala, Dean's pride and joy. He got it from his dad when he turned sixteen. The car is his baby, as he reminds his brother any time he can.
