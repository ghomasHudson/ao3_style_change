"He should be the one giving the orders," Donovan said softly, pointing to Lestrade. She was concerned about the state of Sherlock's mind, more so than usual.
“Thank you for putting yourself on the line again.” He whispered, nuzzling into John’s shoulder. “I know it will be…”
“I have nothing else to do, so I’d better be.” He laughed as he replied.
against him, and a deep breath that sent shivers through his body greeted John when he slowly felt himself come awake. He was surprised as he listened to the slow, rhythmic breathing. It was the first time in a very long time that he'd slept so soundly that nightmares hadn't woken him. He knew that pattern of breath before he even opened his eyes. He'd listened for it so many nights, trying to be sure Sherlock was actually asleep and not just pretending. He almost didn't want to get out of the bed, but he knew he needed to before his back started to cramp. He wondered what had happened during the night that had drawn him so close to Sherlock's body, but didn't pull away. It took him some time to realize an arm was thrown around him and he was cuddled against Sherlock. The embrace was so comfortable and warm, John couldn't be sure he'd ever be tempted to actually leave bed again. Sherlock shifted slightly, tightening his arm around John as he moved. John felt his breath catch.
"How are you feeling?" John asked quietly, moving over to him anyways and picking up his wrist to take his pulse.
"SILENCE!" He backhanded her, growling. "You will answer every question asked of you, you will not move, and you may rest assured you will pay for this." His voice was so low and dark, even Mycroft was somewhat unnerved by it.
"If you insist on continuing to apologizing for the very thing I need from you, I may have to punish you." Sherlock said with a smirk. He pulled back so he could look in John's eyes but was still close to him.
"You're forgiven." He said softly and Hamish threw his arms around his neck with a squeal of joy. He sighed and tightened his arms around his nephew. Greg couldn't hold out and dissolved into giggles.
"You would pick there." John licked his bottom lip and noticed how the action seemed to draw Sherlock's attention. "What now?"
"It's a woman."
"Did you just tell off Lestrade so you could be alone with me?" He asked with a smirk, stepping closer to Sherlock.
"I love him!" Mycroft snapped, his temper flaring higher than before. He froze, his eyes going wide as they both realized what he had said. Ringing silence followed his words as the brothers each took in the confession that had so carelessly fallen from Mycroft's lips. They stood panting for breath as they slowly stepped apart and turned to tentatively look at John. Mycroft let out a soft sigh of relief, noting that John was still deeply asleep. Their breath was ragged as it move through their chests, their anger cooling rapidly in the face of a much bigger conundrum.
Mycroft kissed them both softly before allowing Anthea to lead him away, though he could not stop the dark gnawing feeling in his chest. One he now knew John shared. Sherlock however could not be happier with their ‘misfortune.’ After informing one of the servants to alert them the moment the wheel was fixed he took John in the house, to their room, and locked the door.
"There you are." John smiled warmly as he slowly pulled himself from his sleepy state. Mycroft gently released his arm from around John's waist.
"Johnny, walk out with me please? I'd like to speak with you alone." Jacob smiled softly as he asked but tensed some as both he and Sherlock watched John assume his mechanical motions.
He sat straight up in bed and threw his robe around himself. His nightclothes clinging to him as he hurried. Anthea sat up and looked at him. She looked moderately alarmed by the anger on his face, so she stood hurriedly, throwing her dressing gown around her shoulders.
This chapter is a bit shorter (I'm sorry!) and I am sorry for the delay in getting it out to you. The next chapter will be back up to the usual length and we'll see where we are when it's done!
"What did it say?" Mycroft continued on, turning his eye back to John. John sighed.
***TRIGGER WARNING***
“Yes love, there you are. Use my fingers to gain your own pleasure.” John crooned, groaning as Sherlock ground down on the two fingers inside of him.
"I was going to say that having friends and allies was a worthy endeavor." Mycroft smirked slightly. "I'm going to have them bring a second bed in for you."
son keeping secrets." He smirked, his eyes flashing with possessiveness and inspiring indecent thoughts to obliterate John's train of thought. John coughed slightly and looked away, blushing a bit. Hamish was being a bit restless in Sherlock's arms, but he sat up suddenly and looked at them both.
"You are perfectly well my lovely cousin. You are with a child." He smiled and she gasped in surprise.
John grunted as he slowly woke again, judging by the physical sensations he was suffering he had been out for just under half an hour. The markers for the poison were clear. Right now his blood felt like fire in his veins. He could feel his pulse almost as if it was a drum pounding in his body. That was stage one of the poisoning. Stage two would be much worse. Kitty was arguing with a guard not far from him and when she noticed he was awake she smirked and came back to him. She straddled him and leaned her arms on his chest so her face was merely inches from his.
Once they were gone Meaghan took John to his room and tended to him as she always did, however as she did when her father was away she gave him a bit more blood than normal. She stayed with him until dayfall, when she retreated to her own room. John sank down on the bed, scrubbing his hand over his face. Five years Sherlock had been here, five years he’d been within reach and yet further than ever. John stood and walked over to the window, nearly shouting when arms wrapped around him from behind. A hand pressed over his mouth and in the dim daylight that filtered into the room he looked up at the silver eyes looking back at him, his body trembling involuntarily as the grief of seeing those eyes looking so blankly at him devoured his heart.
"Oh, well then..." He sighed. So that was that? Everything was just 'normal' again? The
"I apologize for the delay, I was looking over your horses. Beautiful creatures." Moriarty grinned, his voice betraying a bit of his nature as he bounded into the room. “Lord Holmes, it is a pleasure.” He said with forced sentiment, glaring at Mycroft. His attention then easily shifting to where John and Sherlock stood close enough together to provide a clue as to their relationship. "And my," He said with a smirk in his voice and a dark look in his eyes, "What a pretty picture you two are." He smirked again purring the words like a child at Christmas.
"Very, very good John." He purred but John held up three fingers.
rather pleasing to the eye, he conceded, noting that he would like to explore the reactions his brother made in response to certain stimuli. Perhaps he could compare them to John's. Before he could progress much farther in his musings however Mycroft's mouth was on his, his tongue plunging into explore the cavern of his mouth when he moaned in surprise. Sherlock flowed back as Mycroft pressed him down into the bed, their mouths moving furiously against one another. Sherlock's mind blanked as he clawed into his brother's shoulders, one hand moving to brace against the headboard. He froze, his entire body going rigid and Mycroft opened his eyes with confusion and concern. Sherlock pulled his hand out from under the pillow both of them growling darkly as they realized his hand had tightened around something metal.
is here and suddenly your attention is fully removed from the man who almost killed himself because of longing for you. Instead you turn your attention back to a woman who preferred you to believe she played with your feelings! And look what happened! " Mycroft's tone was actually just as dark as Sherlock's, the tension growing so tight that both Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade feared an actual physical fight would break out.
“I’ll explain later.” Sherlock sighed. “This is just like the others, except that he was coming to see
“I need to know, John. There is a rift in the coven and before it grows wider I need to understand what it was that happened that made the brothers become so distant and what transpired that made you turn away from Mycroft?” He finished softly, leaning back in his chair. John sighed and stared into the fire for a moment.
"It is Lord Moran." John responded and Sherlock tensed anew. They reluctantly pulled themselves up out of bed. He watched John as he hesitantly moved around the room, seemingly quite concerned about their guest.
"Some of that writing looks like Sherlock's." Greg exclaimed in soft surprise as he leaned over looking at it. John felt a protective urge well up in his chest and he moved the book just slightly. Greg smiled warmly and sat back, but John blushed.
"Y-yes." John forced out, burying his face against Mycroft's chest. "It is like losing him all over again." He whispered.
"Okay." Hamish seemed content enough with the arrangement and he let John carry him as the two men straightened their hair and went downstairs.
"Agreeable indeed,
-Warehouse, smell of something like sulfur, metallic taste in the air, the smell of scorched material maybe from welding -
bare chest,
"Jesus Sherlock," John grunted, clawing into his back as he continued to lathe kisses and nips up and down John's neck. "Why have you waited so bloody long?" John's voice was desperate as Sherlock bit down hard, he groaned and shouted Sherlock's name.
"What is this feeling?" John asked him as they pulled apart again. "This pulsing thread between us, what is it?" He tilted his head slightly, unknowingly exposing his neck.
“And you have carried this knowledge in your heart for nearly a century.” Sherlock whispered, his hand slowly coming up to cup John’s cheek. He could not find the words he needed to express to John what he was. They simply did not exist. “Though I do not deserve it, will you allow me to court you again? To rebuild our love?”
“Then why are we still out here?” Sherlock forced out, his voice quivering as his arousal soared and his body seemed to thrum with his desire. John smirked, somehow knowing that though Sherlock was trying to seem in control, he was quivering with need.
consulting detective. You  want to be the one on top. The world's
John grunted as he woke and realized he was alone in the large bed. It was comfortable and warm but the lack of Sherlock or a warm spot where Sherlock had recently been next to him made him pull himself from the soft blankets and out into the weak sunlight. It was half nine and he was surprised by the stillness the house had as he slowly let all of his senses take in the morning. Sherlock must be outside and judging by the stillness around him Hamish was with him. He could never explain it to anyone who asked him but he always knew whether or not Sherlock or Hamish were in a particular location just by the feel of it. There was a particular energy that his husband and son gave whatever building they were occupying. He sighed softly and walked over to the suitcase rummaging around until he found his favorite shirt, a jumper, clean pants, and trousers. He then grabbed his toiletries bag and headed for the bathroom to begin his morning routine. Just as he finished up in the shower and stepped out he heard the soft thump-thump of shoes hitting the carpet just beyond the bed in the bedroom proper and felt the energy of both of his loves as they snuggled into the bed together. He could hear the excited whispers of the two drifting into the bathroom as they pretended to snuggle in like they'd been there all along. John didn't hurry, instead he moved a bit more slowly before stepping out of the bathroom and looking at Hamish and Sherlock where they were both covered up to their necks by the blankets. He could tell just by looking that Hamish was hiding something under the blankets with him and smirked. Both of them were fully dressed and looked wild as if they had just run a race.
"Something is wrong." Sherlock whispered, coming to stand in front of him. He narrowed his eyes, focusing his attention on John to analyze every detail about his face and posture.
"Hamish..." Sherlock scolded gently. She waved Sherlock's scolding off and smiled at Hamish.
"As I spoke when I found you, you are not tainted my love. I have no want of another save you. You are the only being in this world I wish to cherish." He enjoyed how John was relaxed, returning his hand to card through John's sandy blonde hair with a soft sigh.
"It's okay, I know you have to get better first." He hummed happily as John ran his hands through his hair, snuggling him closer.
“True, however if I did not torment him he would get bored.” Sherlock giggled and John laughed with him.
"And then?" John's voice was quiet.
Meaghan looked up as they entered Mycroft’s study, her own glass of blood shivering slightly in her hands. She waited, knowing it was not proper for her to address Mycroft, as Mycroft pulled a robe around himself and sat down across from her. He watched her, noting how terrified she looked. He smiled a bit and saw how it warmed her a bit, her body relaxing as she watched him. He bowed his head to her, his eyes on the floor as he spoke.
The conversation between John and Jacob boils down to explanations about why they are both at Pendergrass Estate and Jacob explaining that he is being chased by John's father. Jacob leaves John with a warning that both John and Hamish are in danger. John responds saying he knows they are and that he has seen his father somewhere on the Pendergrass Estate grounds.
“And you have come yourself to deliver it.” John purred softly, sitting up and letting his eyes remain on his Sire. “Are you quite certain you had no ulterior motive in coming to us?” His tone was teasing and yet flirting as he drank down a large glass of blood, enjoying how Mycroft’s eyes seemed transfixed on how the motion caused his throat to move. “I owe you an apology, Mycroft.” He said softly as he slipped out of the bed and moved to sit next to his Sire on the couch. He smiled as their gazes met. “My distance was as painful to you as it was to Sherlock and I am quite certain you suffered doubly so as it kept not only me but Sherlock as well out of your reach for a time. I had no intentions of causing such a rift between any of us and I am deeply sorry it occurred.” Mycroft smiled as he placed his hand over John’s, which widened when the mender did not pull away.
"Good evening my love." John purred against his mouth, not pulling away. "I want you." He whispered, claiming Sherlock's mouth in another feverish kiss. "I want to be inside you."
"Ja aber es ist sicherer, wenn ich nicht." He seemed to plead softly.
"It is slightly alarming how much you have become like my brother." Mycroft said softly, the two breaking apart and blushing just slightly. "Though I suppose it was to be expected with your relationship. You are a quick learner John, which meant that it was only a matter of time before you began to become a sort of detective in your own right. The two of you seem to have truly considered every angle on this so though it goes against my better judgment I shall concede that my arguments are defeated and simply offer to help in whatever way I can following the event in question."
"I didn't hurt him, but he wasn't exactly cooperating. You wouldn't have either." Marcus Watson exclaimed. "I'm protecting you."
So every time I say I think we're headed out of Tudor England the boys bring me another plot bunny. Clever bastards.
“Sh… Sherlock.” John groaned, grabbing for the other but Sherlock slipped out of his grasp. Sherlock crawled back down the bed, determination clear as he watched every movement his lover made.
"You've already given it. Consider it repayment for borrowed time." She didn't meet his eyes as she spoke, a cool edge to her voice.
"Yes, you have the same allure as he does, but with you I feel safe. With you I feel like all the ages of the world stretch before and behind me." John turned to look up at Sherlock just as the moon cleared the trees. Sherlock felt his breath hitch in his chest. John looked even more striking in this light and he could feel that string tightening more in his chest. This man had to be his, but he felt a pang. He wanted it to be willingly and he was already unsure of whether or not he'd drawn him in.
He didn't get to finish because at that moment, John using his grip on Sherlock's hair pulled him into himself and kissed him with all he had. The atmosphere of the room changed in an instant and they were all
-Powder on his fingers, from a gun.
"There is a gentleman here to see you, Lord Holmes." She said curtly.
"You to sit down here." John motioned to the seat beside him on the couch.
"Daddy loves Papa a lot." Hamish hummed happily.
"Oh God Sherlock," John whimpered, clawing into the mattress.
“I do not like this.” Mycroft whispered in reply, his brow furrowed. Sherlock looked between them, tilting his head slightly like a puppy might.
"Yes, of course.” Greg blushed slightly. Mycroft finally stepped into the room fully, having dispatched their car. John leaned back and slowly sank back down into his chair with a smirk.
"Oh he is perfect." Sherlock whispered in awe as John lay panting against him.
"Oh listen to him brother, he likes this." Mycroft's voice was dark and thick with possessive arousal. "He likes seeing you pinned between us, gasping like a whore." He rolled his hips forward again, forcing Sherlock forward into John and enjoying their joint moans. Just like this it was terribly easy for him to own both his lovers.
“It must have been some of Moriarty’s men,” Greg answered curtly, looking towards the shadows. “I saw him talking to them just before Sherlock came up to speak with you, Mycroft. It is no longer safe for us out here tonight; let us return to your manor.”
"You two look beautiful cuddled together, I am surprised by the sight." Sherlock whispered and smiled as John blushed.
"Mycroft," Sherlock stood as he finished bandaging John's shoulder, allowing him to pull on his shirt.
"Sherlock?" Mycroft asked, his attention returning to the trembling form in his lap.
"Lying!" Hamish announced proudly and the room burst into giggles.
John grunted awake his head felt like it was split in two pieces. His vision swam in front of his eyes for a few minutes as he tried to recall what had happened. Right, someone had drugged Hamish and hit in him the back of the head. No, not just any someone had hurt him and his son, no his God forsaken
"We're going to Mycroft's, not Antarctica. It's not like we won't be able to retrieve things." John offered, handing him the bag.
"Fuck me Sherlock, please!" The words flew out of his mouth and stunned both of them into silence for a moment.
"That's not a good enough reason, John. In fact as far as reasons to walk away from a man like John Watson-Holmes go it's the most childish and stupid." Sherlock smirked as John blushed. "I know I will never be able to make that mistake up to you. That I just walked away from you like that. You needed me, maybe more than you'd ever needed me in our relationship to that point. I took so much from you over and over again throughout the years of our relationship. Demanding that you drop everything to help me no matter what it was for, expecting you to accept my actions at face value even when they almost ripped your heart from your body, and encouraging you to feel but then chastising you for doing just that. The biggest problem of your life fell into your lap and I acted like a selfish child instead of a supportive husband. He broke his gaze away for a moment, fighting with the growing shame in his chest. John's soft murmur of comfort drew Sherlock's gaze back to his and he met his eyes again. "It was so hard for me to be there, to watch how you were falling apart. You were pushing yourself so hard." His voice cracked slightly and John felt himself flush more. If he ever stopped feeling that flutter in his chest when Sherlock confessed how important he was, it would kill him. "Not eating or sleeping, barely making time to bathe and take care of yourself. I was losing you to your own stubbornness, to the very thing I loved about you. Your ability to care." He slowly took John's hand. "I couldn't handle it, I didn't know what to do or say. We were fighting at every turn because you were trying to push me away, desperate for me to fight back and prove that I would stay there no matter what. You didn't want me to suffer anymore but you didn't know how to ask for the help you needed. So injured as I was by my pride, I took what I thought was your intended meaning and I left. I went to Mycroft's, which was stupid because that was where we'd spent those three months before you so selflessly allowed yourself to be captured and tortured for me. I fought against myself. I found myself outside the damn flat over and over again wanting to come in and sweep you in my arms. Watching you as you stood in my window and played your violin because you had no idea what else to do. I begged Greg to tell me I should do and he had nothing for me. He told me you wouldn't talk about it but that Harry eventually told him that she couldn't be sure you weren't beginning to turn to drinking yourself. She told him you were worse than before I left, always exhausted looking, never sleeping, and that it had been almost a week since she'd seen you eat. I knew if Harry, knee deep in her recovery, could see how bad you were there was only one person who could fix it. The problem was that I was still too full of pride to come home so Greg appealed to Mycroft. Mycroft brought me this," He held up the key which he had slipped around his neck. "He told me that I was killing both of us because I wasn't being a proper man. I wasn't caring for you as I had given my word to do. I was breaking my promise." John shook with emotion and Sherlock pulled him closed. "So I had no choice, I knew I had to fix things."
"Thanks, very kind of you. Thank you for coming and airing my entire life in front of two of my closest friends." John retorted, anger clear.
"Hello cousin." He forced out timidly.
"I'm sorry." Greg offered and John blushed.
“Get him the files and shut up! Everyone shut up!” Sherlock growled, using his normal impertinence to cover up the fact he didn’t want Greg mentioning his personal goal of solving those cases. It was John's turn to be confused and he turned to watch Sherlock work, why would Sherlock be interested in those cases?
"My apologies mother, I have been busy with my training. I was unable to contact you." John replied gently, her eyes going wide.
"We'll need to do what we can on the grounds today, if I remember correctly there is usually a good amount of rain around this time of year and according to the weather app on my phone there's a front moving in tonight." John said as he entered the room with plates.
John was weaker than he had been in ages. He spent most of his first week in his bed, barely able to stand. Mycroft was not far from him, often perched on the sofa in the room watching for signs of discomfort. The second week John started moving around his room, touching the paintings, carvings, and even the woodwork that adorned the walls to ensure that this was still real. Mycroft was pulled away from the menders side for a while, tending to matters of the coven, so Meaghan stayed with him. They spent a week together before she felt prepared to approach Greg’s old coven and left the manor. With the careful tending of his coven members John gained more and more strength but worry filled him. Meaghan had told him Sherlock had not been long behind, however he had yet to reach the manor. John was sitting idly at the top of the stairs watching Anthea and Mycroft at the table below, idly listening to them discuss the finances of the coven. He shivered as he felt the energy of the house shift and stood just as the front doors burst open and Sherlock appeared with a wild look on his face.
"Sie auch, Jacob." John's voice was quiet as his thoughts drifted.
"I... You..." John tried to speak, moving to stand and falling. As he fell Sherlock moved, almost fluidly, to catch him and help him back down on the couch. The feel of Sherlock's hand on his arm was too much. John fainted.
“Your blood always did taste sweeter than any other.” He purred, slowly licking the blood from his fingernail. His eyes darkening as thirst swept through him. “I will destroy you.” He promised. There was a growing need to have more of the Mender’s blood and it made his mind go foggy.
"When did you sleep last?" John asked still in his quiet sleepy voice. He couldn't stop himself as he reached forward and gently pushed those curly locks off Sherlock's cheeks, caressing his cheek slowly as he moved.
“You could have been a soldier, you are a warrior doctor. Willing to stand beside me against the rage of anyone, even your Sire.” John groaned and arched as Sherlock’s lips and teeth teased his sensitive thighs. “Loyal to me beyond sanity, loving me far beyond rationality, and willing to journey into the very mouth of hell to stay at my side.” He licked back up John’s legs, spending several minutes licking and sucking at the sensitive head of the others’ cock. It did not take long for John to shout Sherlock’s name and spill over, his entire body shaking as Sherlock came back up and kissed him again. He hovered there, knowing John was not sated and still wanted more. His eyes burning down into the others. “You are far more than I deserve and I shall destroy everything to keep you at my side.”
"Yes, but that was the first time in my life I felt truly happy. Just being there with you, looking at a dark sky full of little lights." His voice pulled Sherlock's gaze back to his eyes as he whispered his words. "It was the moment I realized that John was okay, that I was allowed to be me. That's why it hurt so bloody much to have that ripped away from me. Because suddenly John was all wrong again."
At half five Sherlock woke John with a gentle kiss giving him a moment to pull himself from the fog of sleep. He cleaned up the uneaten food and made sure the flat was much tidier than they normally would have left it. Just as the clock ticked to five they heard the buzzer. The two men who'd taken Sherlock to Buckingham Palace nodded curtly as they entered the room and began picking up their bags. Sherlock helped John into his coat before sliding on his own and fixing his scarf in its usual way. He saw John looking at the various flower arrangements on the table and smiled. He tapped John on the shoulder, motioning for him to go down to Mrs. Hudson and moved over to grab the first aid kit and John's pills. While John was talking to Mrs. Hudson, Sherlock swept in and out of the door several times before coming to join them just at the bottom of the stairs. Mrs. Hudson walked John back out towards the door and received a hug and a kiss on the cheek from Sherlock.
When she left the room and entered the hallway a hand clamped over her mouth and she was shoved back into the wall of the dark hallway. She was surprised when she looked up to see Sherlock glaring down at her, possessiveness shining in his eyes. When he was sure she would remain quiet he slowly removed his hand, glancing quickly towards the stairs before back to her.
? Es ist nicht der Hütte." Jacob's eyes betrayed his confusion.
"You see Hamish, Prince Erik wanted to make the fastest ship in the world. He wanted to be a pirate who invented things, he wanted to find interesting places and explore them, and he wanted to do all of that with all of the freedom a Pirate Prince deserved so he needed a first mate who could take care of his pirates. Someone that he felt he could trust with his life and the lives of his men and almost as soon as he saw Captain John commanding his troops he decided that he was the man for the job. Now normally Prince Erik would be called Captain, and John mentioned that to him but he didn't care. He was already Prince, so Erik said Captain John would be just fine and once he said it - it was law. The soldiers were forgotten that afternoon as Prince Erik told Captain John all about his family: about the evil King Izzod who was his father and was always angry and his evil brother Prince Croft." Mycroft huffed a sigh, Greg giggled, and Sherlock smirked. "Captain John told Prince Erik all about the evil General Now and how his family was tied to King James. They talked for hours and hours and were late to tea, where Lady Georgina told them she would pack them some food for dinner so they could roam the estate. Prince Erik told Captain John that John was actually the only reason the Prince had come to Pendergrass and it made little John far happier than it should have. They became great friends and had many adventures in the Kings' lands but the most important adventure of all was the case involving the Beast of Pendergrass." A low chuckle broke free as Greg started laughing again and this time John blushed, caught red handed with his penchant for romantic names. If only Greg knew about the leather bound journal in John's bag. "It was bas business, little Prince. That summer the kindly King James was murdered and it tore the friendship between the General, King Izzod, and the Pendergrass family apart. The General accused King Izzod of the murder and because of that the Prince and the Captain were not allowed to see each other anymore." John whispered softly, pain in his voice. "Izzod took his sons and left Pendergrass estate a month before the end of summer and John did not see him again for a long time. But three years later Captain John got a package. Lady Georgina brought it to him at his home and the shipping packaging had been removed. She said it had been sent to Pendergrass estate to ensure it made it to Captain John and was for him alone. When Captain John finally opened it late that night he found Prince Erik's pirate gear and a letter inside. A letter telling him..."
"John, I told you I'm not leaving your side." He'd said it as firmly as he could manage in the moment, but he had been panting slightly from the internal struggle he was facing. He didn't like to lose, no that was an understatement. He hated to lose and now he was in a no win situation.
“You and that mouth.” The other purred, pulling Sherlock back towards the bed and pushing him down on it. He began removing Sherlock’s trousers and undergarments, taking his time as he did.
"Yea, we're out of milk. Again," He laughed and she smiled. "I'm just going to pop over to the grocer. Do you need anything?"
"I don't care, Lestrade." Sherlock looked at one of the pages and flicked it. It was then John realized he was looking over some form of the Kama sutra. He choked on tea again, noting the small smirk that caught the edge of Sherlock's lips. So Sherlock was purely showing off just for him.
"Touch me, John.
"I'm sorry too Hamish." John said quietly. They sat that way for awhile before Sherlock got up to help Greg. They set everything on the table and John enjoyed the feel of his son in his arms. He took him to the table and they all sat and chatted for awhile, relaxing in the moment.
? Suddenly John was speaking again. "So whatever he did that made you jump destroyed me. I didn't want to go on without you. Without the bloody work. I got a new flat and a new job, but I didn't try to date anyone. Then one day our nurse quits, for no reason. Just gets up and walks out. The next day Mary was there and she looked me right in the eyes and asked me how I was. And she
long thought dead." He crossed his hands over the top of his umbrella, leaning forward. His attention completely focused on John. Mycroft did nothing to mask his intentions or his meaning and John was somewhat flustered.
"Don't say that name right now, please." John almost begged. He grunted as a flashback rolled over him, Sherlock bracing him and gently guiding him down on the bed.
“Is that what has been plaguing you for the last several months?” He looked to the other with more understanding.
to his memory, to him, was almost too much for Sherlock to handle.
"Do you like that idea, Captain? The idea of me punishing you for everything you've done wrong? Insubordination bears a heavy fine..." He purred, pulling something else out of the bag. It turned out to be his rope. He fussed around at the end of the bed and John felt pressure on his right ankle.
Three months later Kitty was remanded to a mental institution after being declared mentally unfit for trial. It was a small amount of closure for John who bore many new scars from her game but he was happy enough to have the entire situation behind them. He and Sherlock made their union official and as Sherlock enjoyed telling Lestrade repeatedly they were now consulting husbands, Sherlock refusing to go on any case if Anderson was doing forensics and insisting instead that John do all of the forensic work. Mycroft pressed them to take an extended honeymoon which they readily agreed to, although to his displeasure they chose his guest manor as their destination.
"He's one; you can correct his speech when he's older." Hamish drank the medicine but he made a face.
“It is a letter from John.” He flinched when both men turned their gazes on him and it felt as though the force of the sun shone on him.
" Sherlock sighed.
"Lord Moran will be present as he has been Moriarty's guardian for the majority of his life. Please do not make a fool of us." Sherlock's gaze hardened.
"I ALREADY AM HAPPY!" Hamish whimpered and John tried to quell his rage. "I love him; he is the person I chose to marry. Just because you can't accept..."
There was no sign off but they didn’t need one. It was the message they had been expecting for awhile. The message that John knew Sherlock ached for every time his phone chimed. John didn't even try to hide the blush or argue with the fact he'd been the one given the hyphenated name. That was likely to be how it would work after all, he was the sentimental one. John cleared the notification, barely noting that it came from a blocked number and musing over whether or not Mycroft would try to trace it for just a moment before turning his attention to Sherlock. He had not expected the conflicted look on Sherlock's face, so easily taken aback by the emotion that the detective could no longer hide when the two of them were alone. He looked afraid, as if waiting for some expected reaction from John. Sherlock's eyes burned into John's face reading and deducing every inch of him to find an answer to the question burning in his mind.
Mycroft fell silent as he watched Sherlock reach over and tighten his grip on John’s hand just as John began to fall asleep. Sherlock followed John shortly after and Mycroft and Greg remained only to keep a watchful eye on the three of them, concern evident on both of their faces.
"What are you doing here?" His voice cracked, betraying his heart.
"Hm," Sherlock grunted, "The tooth again?"
"Its fine John, we've got him. You have fun." Greg's smirk was one of knowing, his eyes barely flicking towards Sherlock.
“What a noble fool you continue to be. Even after being shown your nobility is naught but weak. You willingly hand me the keys to a kingdom that could be yours, just to save little Sherlock’s life?” Moriarty’s grin grew as he stepped closer and circled John. “Oh my, my… What is this? Has the kitten lost his collar?” His hand was instantly wrapped around John’s neck, squeezing tightly. John, however, did not flinch.
“I am not a child.” Sherlock snapped in response, his eyes dark.
, I would not expect you to act as you always have." He looked up when Sherlock sat down on his other side, raising an eyebrow. “I have missed you both terribly however I have understood the distance.” He watched as Sherlock looked to John, seemingly asking for permission for something. “I feel I have missed a discussion of an important nature between the two of you.” He smirked, feeling how the air in the room shifted.
Neither knew how to explain it but suddenly Baker Street felt alive and thriving. The cool silence melted away as the flat filled with the golden glow of life. The life of Sherlock Holmes and
“He was coming to see us.” John held out the paper, it had their address written on it. Along with a note scrawled along the bottom, hastily with a smear of blood on it read: 'John, Harry was retaliation.'
"Which is where I should interject." Mycroft spoke softly but firmly. "You will have to remain inside this manor for the first month. While you get your feet under you as it were. The sun will weaken you too much initially for you to be able to adequately protect yourself. There is to be a dinner gathering at your Uncles near the end of the month, you and Sherlock will attend on our behalf and you shall, my little mender, ask your Uncle for permission to be courted by Sherlock. He will of course grant you permission and when you return I will have everything prepared for your journey to Paris." Mycroft helped John sit up as Sherlock adjusted the pillows for him. He slowly looked between them for a moment.
"Ignore her." Sherlock hissed out of the side of his mouth. Slowly sliding his hand to rest on the middle of John's back. It was a clear motion and it made John shiver.
“Do not tarry long. Mycroft’s heart will not weather it well.” Anthea chided.
"You realize," John said as he felt the envelope in the chest pocket of Sherlock's coat, "That we still have a lot to talk about." His voice was soft, but not timid.
"We're getting married. Well I'm going to ask anyway." John looked down, away from that empty chair.
"Yea! Daddies tell me a story!" Hamish giggled, settling down in Sherlock's lap. Sherlock gently ran a finger over the small golden key around his neck - smirking as John's caught the light around his neck.
"It is of little consequence to have the physical document." John furrowed his brow, why was Mycroft being so
“John, it is the middle of the night. Why have you asked me to meet you here alone?” He sighed. “You have been behaving very oddly and it is driving your lover mad.”
"Do you realize how incredibly
“Do not give up.” He heard a whisper; he tried to turn his head but could not move. “We will be free soon.” Sherlock hoped his mind was reaching the menders, he could feel how close to the edge he was. “Please John…”
"It's good to know you're still attracted to me after my miserable showing last night." John's smirk didn't slip as he got up to get dressed, wearing only his boxers.
“Good, I shall go prepare the sleeping chambers in the other flat for you.” John stepped from the room.
"Why should I trust either of you?" He demanded, his voice oozing with anger.
"I missed you as well, however I was well attended to." He smiled. Mycroft leaned down and claimed his mouth in a powerful kiss, grinning as John whimpered softly.
BOOM!
-Darkened eyes, refusing to look at him for more than a moment -
"John, let the ghosts of the past go." His voice was soft, he pressed John more tightly against himself, one hand slipping up to cradle his head. "We'll be okay. If anyone attacks us we'll be okay. I promise..."
“Haste is of importance in this situation Sherlock. You should know the Pendergrass family was once strongly connected to ours. I am sure Lady Pendergrass mentioned it in her letter. Though we haven’t seen them since you were… Seven I think.” He paused looking thoughtful as he sought a memory.
"Oh John,
“The only markings are these two little punctures on the side of his neck.” Greg motioned, pointing them out. Both of them had of course already examined them.
"I did. I knew however he did not want me to tell you. And you may rest assured,
. He moved quickly and downed the next sniper, noting that Jacob had taken down the other two. He had to get down and somehow convince John that this was all a bluff.
Alexandra was trying her best not to cry, though tears ran down her face. She threw some of the blood soaked sheets in the fire and turned back to survey Elizabeth and John with a tight face. Sherlock swept through the room, taking in every detail he could see. There was blood everywhere, Elizabeth was hemorrhaging and must have been for some time. Each servant who attended to her tracking some blood to somewhere new. He turned to face Alexandra as she rested at his side.
"I know!" Sherlock snapped defensively, but frozen in his pacing. His voice was elevated.
Mycroft stalked out, traveling briskly down the port until he saw the other boat. He hid himself behind some crates and listened as several soldiers explained how a man had just shown up with his injured mate and declared he would buy the boat if he must however he needed to return to England right away. Mycroft was considering his options when he felt his brother reach his mind.
"Because I am the one who has to see the dark look that sweeps over his face when he sees you walk past without so much as turning your head to him. I am the one who has seen how he has faltered in his confidence because just as he was gaining surety that he held both our hearts he has been seemingly told by you that you hold no concern for him. I am the one who must watch as he carefully tries to hide his hurting heart for fear of my jealousy and anger. I cannot control how I feel, I cannot stop my jealousy however I have tried to put it aside for him. Because I love him and it kills him to see how far away you are." Sherlock softened and stepped back, his brow furrowed.
“Left something for me?” John whispered and he knew he and Sherlock both wouldn’t be able to eat until they investigated. So the two of them immediately scaled the stairs, almost running for the room. John went there straight by memory, without worrying about the path. What he didn't notice was that Sherlock seemed to know exactly where he was going as well.
" His eyes shifted slightly, as he cuddled closer. "
"So she is alive but sleeping?" John asked but Sherlock knew he was deflecting the moment he had to confess to the question lingering before them.
"You are worth more than you know, my beloved." Sherlock smiled and he climbed into the bed with them, pressing passionate kisses to his lovers mouth. Kisses that pleaded for forgiveness even as they inspired lust.
it was.
me." John wanted to groan again as Sherlock said it with a predatory growl and clear intent. There was some very threatening darkness in his words, but instead of putting the fear in John it only encouraged him.
"Except for his heart." Sherlock said groggily from the stairs. He had on his pajamas, a bathrobe, and had a sheet wrapped around himself. John moved to get up and help him sit down but he waved him off, moving to sit down himself. Hamish pouted and shifted into Elaine's lap, looking over his father's with his ever watchful stare.
“And… And what say you, brother?” Mycroft groaned, pulling his mouth and body away from John to survey his brother.
"Sherlock to your task." Mycroft commanded his voice dark and thick with hunger as he watched John and Sherlock collide for a heated kiss. John melted easily into Sherlock's guidance even though he could feel Sherlock's jealousy pooling inside of his own stomach. Sherlock kissed him and continued undressing him, doing his best to not let his emotion show. John's eyes flashed to his, promising and reassuring as they could be in a moment like this.
"Georgie bat uns zu bleiben. Sie bat uns die Morde zu lösen." John's voice revealed the information with purpose, even though Sherlock didn't understand what all he was saying.
A short while the three men returned to the main room where John was sitting comfortably on the couch listening to Sally talk about a case the Yard had recently completed. Molly and Mrs. Hudson were sitting in dining room chairs on one side of the living room watching the room carefully.
"Oh! Yes!" Hamish exclaimed exceptionally excited. His giggle didn't stop for a few minutes.
"They both have." John motioned to Hamish who had fallen asleep with one leg hanging off the couch. "They haven't slept in two days."
"You want to drink of me..." John said softly, searching Sherlock's eyes. "The rumors are true are they not? You are one of the undead, a vampire?" Sherlock was surprised because John sounded interested not afraid.
“Are you finally considering my offer? Oh, that would be so lovely if you would. I promised to repay you for what you have done for me and I intend to make good on it. Please just come when you are ready. I shall be here.” She smiled broadly, and it had taken John longer than he expected to realize that she was a vampire like they were, only turned when she was much older.
“Boys settle down.” Lestrade said softly, putting his hand on both John and Mycroft’s shoulders. “Mycroft we both know John has considered all the options. I’m sure if he and Sherlock couldn’t figure out something different then there wasn’t another option. I will have ambulances ready to take anyone who needs to straight to hospital. John will be fine.”
"Sherlock, that was..."
"Speaking of thinking..." John said in a gruff voice about half an hour later.
“Good afternoon are you Detective Lestrade?” Gregory opened the door to reveal a young boy who had an envelope in his hand. When Greg nodded that he was the body nodded once as well. “Yesterday Doctor Watson gave me this letter and bid me give you if he did not make it through the night, my father just informed me that the good Doctor passed this morning. So I made sure to bring this right away” He handed the letter to Gregory before turning and running off. A letter from John?
He stood there for a moment in the dwindling afternoon light, sighing with a bit of relief. Knowing that Elizabeth's mind had not been her own was a greater relief than he expected to find it. He turned to reenter the house and almost shouted in surprise when he found Lord Moran standing directly behind him. He stumbled slightly and Sebastian caught him, helping to right him.
"I expected as much, truthfully." Mycroft yawned a bit and carded his hand through John's hair. John smiled up at him tiredly from Sherlock's arms.
"Yes. I have lived for over two hundred years." He found himself letting the words fall easily from his lips. He trusted this man, implicitly. "My brother and I were turned by a woman just after I passed my twentieth year. Yet in all that time no one has drawn me in so quickly as you."
“N-no my Lord,” John forced out weakly. “I merely bumped into another vampire while on my allowed walk this evening. I apologize.” He kept his eyes down, shivering violently as he did.
"You said the things you did?" John finished for him, clearing his throat slightly. Sherlock nodded, looking over his face as he answered. "Yea, I figured that part out immediately." He swallowed hard. "You were trying to make me angry. You were trying to push me away so I wouldn't be hurt by what you were going to do. But..." His breathing grew rapid again and he clenched his hands, grunting as he did. Sherlock tightened his hands over John's. "What you said after that wouldn't have allowed me to believe it, if I had, even for an instant." His voice cracked again as he tried not to let the memories overwhelm him.
"I would never want to disappoint
"You're my brother, don't be an idiot."
"Yes." Their eyes met and John's breath hitched in his chest.
"I have been trying vainly to meeting with you over the course of the last few weeks. I am saddened to say that my attempts have been thwarted by your keepers. I seek you in urgency as I must beg a favor of you.” His voice took on an urgency, his tone softening to draw out the mender’s empathy. “Despite all my efforts to protect my kin it seems that they are once again becoming ill and the likely source is a new herb our servants are using that was brought back by one of my coven from the far East. They have been growing it in our garden for sometime without ill effect, however when the mortals began using it some strange happenings began with my kin. I was hoping that you, clever mender, would do me the honor of investigate this herb in the way only you seem competent of. I have here a bundle containing what little information we could gather and several samples of the herb and the seeds it grows from. Please John, you are the only one I can trust to assist with this and keep my the best interest of my kin at heart.” Moran looked down.
mine. Fledglings created from my family. This one is my grandson, she is some riffraff that seemed to show potential. I now see that was a misguided belief." Sebastian's jaw was tight and his rage had not calmed in the slightest. Every soft whimper that the mender issued forth made something twitch in the man's face.
"It's alright John, it's alright." Sherlock tried to put his hand on John's but realized he was using his right arm. He grunted and switched to the left side not responding to anything else anyone said until John seemed to settle down.
But John didn't answer instead he extended his left hand and let his palm come to rest over the dog tags under Sherlock's shirt, pressing them into his skin. Pressing his ring finger into the tags and giving him a knowing look. Sherlock relaxed instantly and a soft smile swept over his face.
“I…” Sherlock sank down on one knee, shaking hard. “
"Maybe to you," John smirked slightly but Sherlock didn't soften. "Sherlock, I'm trying to be patient with you. I'm trying to give you space and let you be who you are, but if we're going to share this love…"
"Oh piss off, tattletale." John said softly, looking down, but he blushed and looked somewhat pleased.
"Of course, Dear!"
"There's no need for all of that." He blushed again. "Just tell me what's going on."
They came together again kissing each other as Sherlock pushed John's hands into the wall above his head. There were tears, but smiles played at the corners of their lips as the two of them dissolved into a mess of desire and moans. Sherlock decided that the moment was becoming too dangerous to be continued in their current position and still provide them privacy, so he pulled John down onto the couch. It wasn't entirely the right decision as Sherlock found himself kissing John more intensely as they went but he eventually broke the kiss heaving for air. Sherlock almost groaned, John had his thinking face on. Sherlock didn't want to think, he just wanted to strip him down and claim him.
have done." There was a pure threat in John's tone and Mycroft's brows quirked up a bit.
"He's been sleeping a lot lately, I think that tooth was getting pretty bad." John said softly, moving over to look at Hamish's mouth. "It looks like it's healing okay though." Hamish reached out for John, who easily took the sleepy boy into his own arms.
“The leaves are going to change soon.” John said quietly, looking up from his book where he sat in the gazebo. Sherlock was a few feet away staring intently at the bark of one of the trees. “This winter is going to be a harsh one.”
“I have been through the fires of hell and lived, I know now that I am stronger than I have been given credit for, smarter than anyone thinks, and completely worthy of accepting the challenge of being your mate.” He growled as he latched on to one of Sherlock’s nipples, moaning as Sherlock shouted.
- heart, hunters...
"Why are you telling me this?" John asked softly as they came to rest at the end of the walk, in front of a fountain. "Why do you trust me?"
Sherlock has too much energy so the two set off to see if there are any clues left at Pendergrass Estate, what they find provides them more information than they expected and sends Sherlock a little off the deep end.
"I'm alright Hamish, don't you worry about it, love." John blushed but he hugged Hamish, sandwiching the boy between the two of them. Greg was chuckling softly.
! Then it's just Hi, I'm alive, back to work!" He was shaking so much harder as the emotion tried to break free. Sherlock straightened up and put his hands on John's shoulders, again drawing his attention.
coat. He rubbed the fabric between his fingers like a child might, as if trying to prove it was real. Then he did something that completely floored Sherlock. He picked it up and buried his face in it, smelling it. He fought the tears but his back shook with them. A pained look spread over Sherlock's face.
"It does, because it helps you when you can't say the words yourself. We'll get Hamish to the dentist tomorrow and then I'll see if Greg or Molly can watch him for a few days. We can take a holiday..."
"Listen to him whine like a whore. He has been here like this for three days and he is still as firm as a young boy. How many times has he released and he still craves more." A man's voice taunted, punctuated by more whimpers and moans from John. John shouted but his words were unintelligible.
“I apologize that I did not announce my plan to call on you all ahead of time, however after learning the recent news I felt it was prudent that I stop in sooner rather than later.” Mycroft wanted to erase the fear he could feel his fledgling struggling under, but knew he could not. John did not speak immediately, rather he stepped back and let Mycroft enter. John watched the other closely, not sure what to make of his intentions and finding more concern evident in Mycroft’s eyes than he expected. He tried to find the right thing to say but was saved the need by Sherlock loudly clearing his throat.
"I... God I never imagined the two of you..." John writhed again. "Touch me more, please! Use me! Please." Mycroft smirked.
"He did!" She insisted.
"That brings up the question..." John looked down and Sherlock sighed impatiently.
- There was a small spatter of John's blood near the door but no other signs of struggle.
"Benutzen Sie mich!" John shouted, using the only trick he had left. Sherlock growled and bit harder, John jolting as he did.
"No, running away from our home isn’t going to help. It’s not his fault I think of her when I hold him, he’s the greatest gift she ever gave me." John whispered but pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock wrapped around him deepening the kiss and chuckling lightly when John moaned.
"I know you better than anyone." He promised as their mouths were inexplicably drawn together again. Sherlock's hand slid immediately into his hair, deepening the kiss.
"Oh Lord, Lestrade. You took his files? Are you trying to kill me?" Sherlock clicked his tongue, not appreciating the joke. "He'll be bored to tears in five," John's voice contained a smirk but Sherlock spoke over him.
John felt the edges of panic sweeping through his body. He heard Sherlock talking and the words were clear but he couldn't absorb them. Hamish and Sherlock were in danger, in danger from his father. Sherlock was once again at the edge of potentially being ripped from his life by those hands. Those hands that had hit in anger, beat because of intolerance, and tore at flesh because of hatred. Those hands that should have raised a boy to become a man and instead taught him to hide from everything that made him who he was. He shivered violently and just barely kept the tea cup from rattling against the plate. He set it down as Jacob answered Sherlock's question.
“You have brought this on your ‘mate.’ Using your research I created the perfect weapon: a hollow pointed knife full of a mixture of herbs that will make Sherlock forget you ever breathed.” James growled in John’s ear, holding him roughly. The bolt was still caught in his body, blood trickling down as his body attempted to heal around it. James yanked on it, enjoying the painful shout it tore from John’s throat.
"'S going on?" John asked softly, sitting up. Greg smirked.
"Where did they go?" He whispered and Sherlock looked around quickly.
The door led straight into a living room that was a large open room. Straight across from the entrance was a pair of sliding glass doors that lead out onto a veranda and into the garden John had noticed previously. To the right end of the house was a large formal dining room that looked out over the pond. The kitchen offset from the dining room was much larger than the one at 221, including room for a smaller dining table. In fact it was almost as big as the living room and kitchen combined at Baker Street. The living room opened up again to the left, including a fire place in the corner. A hallway branched directly off their left from the living room leading first to a bathroom, then to a room clearly designed as an office. The hallway branched to the left just beyond the office and led to the first bedroom, while taking the hallway straight on lead to the master suite complete with a large private bathroom. John barely had time to register all of that before the breath was sucked out of his chest. His jaw clenched.
"With me?" Mycroft looked confused, his mind working quickly. It dawned on him, every time he'd turned John away it had been on a fortnight cycle. If he hadn't returned to Sherlock where was he. "He did not return to you?" His concern filtered through his voice.
“I’ve seen this before.” Both Sherlock and John said at the same time, both of them turning to look at the other with a confused look.  There was a tense silence as the two of them tried to size the other up. This was not something they had ever discussed and it was clear that somewhere in the heart of this was something that both of them were keen to keep private.
“Lady Moriarty has sent for you,” She whispered softly. “She apparently took ill this morning while she was in the garden. She wants you as her doctor and will accept no other.”
"I know, it's one on my father..." John growled and Sherlock's face tensed into an almost Mycroft like sneer.
"Yes, morning it is. Incidentally John, I wasn't aware your family had any connections with someone the likes of the Pendergrass family." Mycroft was not as rigid as he usually was, moving easily into the room and surveying the breakfasting family.
"Even now you trust me enough to have complete power over you." John whispered, swallowing down Sherlock's seed before kissing his way back up to snuggle against him again. "Even when my mind could have been tampered with."
"You are part of my work, John. A very integral part, in fact." John blushed again. Sherlock smirked and pulled his mobile out to check the time.
"Quite, now please be silent. I already told you I need to prepare." The other man snapped back.
"So tell me Johnny Boy why hasn't your Master shown up yet?" She laughed when John just glared refusing to answer her. "Oh be boring then. I'll just tell you. It's because he is still in the hospital." She said joyously. "Maybe he died! Wouldn't that be ever so disappointing for you? That would mean you would die all alone. Too bad," She got up and walked a bit away to a table, fiddling with something on it.
"I'll murder you right here in front of him." Marcus grinned. “Then your poor son will be all alone.” Marcus stood and moved over to John, grabbing a hand full of his hair. “Say goodbye to your
"They will help you heal love, please." James begged, again tipping the cup to his lips. Sherlock fought as long as he could but the darkness that came when he lost control returned and he knew nothing of the world for a long time.
"James was gay?" Sherlock asked softly, furrowing his brow the way he always did when he was presented with something he'd missed.
"I'm sorry that I didn't tell you what was bothering me. Mycroft's sudden appearance wasn't helpful." John sighed.
"You can feel it again?" Sherlock's voice was breathless, full of lust.
"You could help, you know!" He snapped as his anger got the better of him.
"Oh, of course I will, dear!" Mrs. Hudson smiled. She saw Sherlock's look and grinned. "I'll just leave you two to your packing. If you need anything, just shout..." She made her way back out of the flat, muttering to herself as she did. Sherlock's gaze must have lingered because John suddenly looked to him and blushed.
"I'm not a doctor John. I can't..." Sherlock had been acting in a way that made him seem clingy to John, for the entire hospital stay and it was starting to grate on his nerves.
"Not entire," John mumbled. "Georgina, James' wife is still alive and James had a nephew he left everything to." John's voice held sentiment, it intrigued Sherlock but he knew John well enough to realize he wasn't about to get answers.
"That is very sweet of you, John." Mycroft said darkly, looking up at him. "However I am afraid I cannot do that. I have quite a bit of work to complete and I must go visit the Duke tomorrow. Is Sherlock brooding?" He kept his voice sharp because he wanted to melt under the disappointment that shone in John's eyes. He wanted to sweep up from behind his desk and kiss away the sorrow that was building behind John's eyes, but he could not. He could not allow himself to do this.
Two men in crisp black pants, both seemingly more angles and lines than any softness or flexibility sat silent for the moment as the car rolled past building after building. The silence was tense, heavy, and littered with unspoken words and angry feelings. Mycroft Holmes held one hand tightly on the handle of his black umbrella, surveying the other man with tightly pursed lips and a grim look. The other man sat in silence, his thoughts clearly occupied and having no interest in conversing with the man staring at him so intently.
"I mean thank you." Sherlock said quietly, looking directly at John.
“There is something about this case…” Sherlock mumbled as he peered over the documents. “Something so familiar.” He was pacing their room, as it turned out a snow storm blew up the next morning and they were unable to go into town.
“My father and I fear so.”
"Because I trust you." John forced out.
"Sherlock..." John's voice cracked and he tugged tighter on the cloak as if trying to pull Sherlock back towards the estate.
” Sherlock’s voice was weak, cutting in and out.
"I do not understand how he is able to affect me so easily. He simply looked me in the eyes and everything went blank." John whispered. "He is so different than you."
"Anthea have you been following me?" John asked her quietly as he tightly wrapped the cloak around himself.
"Yes. You did make an appointment for him tomorrow, right?" John asked in a reprimanding tone as he gently set Hamish down on Sherlock’s chest. Hamish instantly cuddled into Sherlock, wrapping one hand in his shirt and making happy cooing noises as he did. Sherlock tried valiantly to appear unaffected but he slowly wrapped his long arms around his son, holding him tightly to his own chest.
" John's voice was husky in Sherlock's mind, filling him to the brink. Their arousal swirling and humming in their bond until Sherlock could not focus on anything else.
"You utter imbecile! It serves the purpose of protecting him for the ages of the world! It serves the purpose of him becoming a full-fledged member of our society. Do you know what he has done for you? The way he has suffered for you this last week? For Gods' sake Sherlock, he tried to mind link with you!" Mycroft jabbed a finger against Sherlock's chest. "All because he was determined to free you from some mental torment he believed you were enduring! All because you did not warn him about your brooding! And he garnered mind sickness from it because of the confusion of your mind palace!"
"I went out this morning to work in the garden, we are not due to travel to France for some time and I wanted to ensure the house was well prepared for our absence. When the sunlight fell on me I fainted and woke here in this room." She sighed as she shivered.
"As always taking care of us." Sherlock smirked, teasing. He turned to look at John with a very intent glance, something unspoken passing between them.
"Oh he is precious." Mycroft growled and moved closer.  "There is but one thing left to do say."
In the darkness of the manor time passed without much marking. Days became weeks which became months. Sherlock watched with a growing hatred in his chest, as every evening John was led down to the main room where Sebastian would begin by forcing John to use his body to provide Sebastian pleasure. Often while the most powerful of the coven sat by and tried their best to ignore what was happening. He would often call attention to his actions, humiliating the mender as he used him in whatever method pleased him that day. As each of these moments came to pass hatred grew in Sherlock’s heart, along with a possessive jealousy that he had not expected. It did not take him long to realize the man that haunted his dreams was this broken pet that Sebastian tormented. Nor did it take him long to decide that he would free the man, take him home to his coven, and keep him as his own. Shortly after their arrival Sherlock learned where John was kept, though he had yet to find an opportunity to be with the man on his own. He knew today however that would change.
"We should go to Pendergrass Manor, I can e-mail Georgina." John offered.
"For your abilities." Mycroft conceded, crossing his arms and leaning back as he sat back down.
"Busted," Sherlock conceded, sighing.
"Y-Yes it was." John muttered his head still swimming. "An alliance with another family... Does our family even make those?" John was fingering the envelope gently, absentmindedly. His body thrumming with desire for Sherlock.
"My brother will take him home." Sherlock said suddenly. Mycroft looked alarmed and John looked confused. "I will remain here and see if we can sort out who attempted to ruin Elizabeth's joy." His voice was firm. "Lord Moran would you assist me in repairing this dinner party?" He asked it firmly and Sebastian easily understood.
"No, there has been no opportunity to do so as he refuses my presence. As the evidence suggests he no longer wishes to be my mate I shall simply do this and thus make it easier for him. He will not have to say the words that will injure my heart and I shall not have to endure the pain of those words. He will be free to pursue his healing and his bonds with the coven family as he sees fit, without fear that I shall be lurking around each corner waiting to pounce on him. While I hope that when your leadership does bring the coven to Germany I shall gain his affections again I have resolved myself fully to accept that I may never again share that treasured space within his heart." Sherlock's shoulders sagged and Mycroft felt his own face tighten in confused pain.
"Yes. I have been able to heal at least some wounds of your kind since I was a child. I first discovered it when I happened upon Anthea in our apple orchard when I was approximately five." John replied softly.
"Are you sure you want this, my little one?" Mycroft asked softly, leaning down to kiss him with a bruising force.
“For my brother,” He handed Mycroft a small box. “I was going to buy you a new umbrella, since you seem so keen on using the old one as a walking stick - but I was told that was bad form. So instead I bought you this.” It was a pair of cuff links that were Union Jacks. They were rather tacky which made Lestrade laugh. “For Lestrade, a new watch to replace the one I broke by throwing it into the Thames in a fit. For which I am supposed to apologize and perhaps one day shall.” Sherlock offered the box, Lestrade was definitely giggling now. “For Molly a bracelet as a token of esteem and for her help in many ways, seen and unseen.” Molly blushed slightly taking her box. “Mrs. Hudson, a necklace to replace the one I experimented on, for which I should have apologized and asked permission but didn't." Sherlock's lines sounded rehearsed and each new gift made them all giggle more. "Sally, I know that you think I am a freak and that I don't notice anything positive about you, but I do. This is just a small token of my appreciation for all that you have done for John and for putting up with my insults." He handed her a card, it was a gift card for her favorite store. She blushed slightly. "Honestly I had chosen better gifts, but John assured me they were all rude and uncalled for so you should direct your thanks to him." Sherlock raised an eyebrow and John blushed.
"Only if you actually cook this time, no experiments." He countered.
"I was sleeping rather peacefully until it felt as if my mind was invaded by a horde of angry bees. I have told you before that when you are communicating it affects me. You have come to see your handiwork and here it is." John's grin was wide but he moved to cuddle closer to Sherlock.
- A scent of lemon wafted off of Hamish as he giggled -
"When he started shouting at you in it, because the look on your face would have been priceless." John shrugged and Greg laughed loudly.
"Sherlock, this sudden change in behavior is alarming." Mycroft said softly, as they stepped into the office and Lestrade closed the door.
"Is it John?" He barely breathed.
" Sherlock's voice was a bit timid and full of exhaustion.
"I was shot at, Sherlock. There were bullets and bombs and you never knew who would be taken down next. But it was nothing compared to this." He took a deep breath, his voice shaking. Sherlock could feel the fear gnawing away at John as he tried to keep his breathing even. He was on the verge of a panic attack.
“Do you have any blood wine? Sherlock and I remained in our room for most of the day and ran out early on.” John smirked as if remembering something enjoyable.
“I wondered how long it would take for you to wake, my love.” The other grinned down at him, his eyes dark with passion. “You have been gone too long and I need to reclaim what is mine.”
"Yes Inspector." She turned and halfway to the door she stopped and looked back. "Sherlock," Donovan's raised voice snapped his attention away from John. "I don't care if your foolishness gets you hurt, but that man cares for you more than anything else. Don't let him get hurt again." Her voice was almost lethal as she walked out of the room. Sherlock was puzzled for a moment but distracted from it when a short, dark haired doctor entered the room.
." Sherlock growled in response.
"Sherlock Holmes,
The entire flat shook, debris flew everywhere and the men were thrown in opposite directions. Sherlock slammed into Lestrade and the two of them collided with the wall in the kitchen. John was thrown hard into the couch and lay sprawled on the floor unconscious. Sherlock looked up, his forehead bleeding and his body ached everywhere. He couldn't get up, his body not responding with as disoriented as he was. Lestrade was out cold but didn't seem to be bleeding too much. But John was clear across the room and looked bad. He tried to make himself get up, struggling as his head swam and his vision came and went. Within minutes there were sirens. Sherlock saw two figured run into the room, dressed as medical staff but something was off. He knew then the game was on, but he still struggled. He still tried to get to John, desperate to keep him safe. They had John on a stretcher and out of the flat before Sherlock even got to his knees, but the sirens had only just arrived. He tried to say something as Donovan came in the room but everything went black.
"You won't answer and I'll be fine, but thank you." His words were spoken with a coldness, "Be careful and let me know when you're on your way back." Sherlock moved to kiss John, but John moved away. He went into his room and slammed the door.
Sherlock was often alone during this time and he found he preferred it that way, as he was haunted. Haunted by a man he could not place, a memory that refused to settle, and a name that gnawed at his soul to be discovered. For years now Sherlock had been plagued by horrible nightmares of a sandy haired man being tortured, raped, and beaten. Sometimes he witnessed the events themselves and others only the aftermath – a broken man sobbing for some past he felt was lost for good. Sherlock had tried on many occasions to speak to the man in his dream, feeling certain that he was real, only to find it made the man break. There was a growing ache in Sherlock’s soul and he knew this man was the key. He looked up as the forest finally gave way to a large, old stone manor. It felt vaguely familiar, like something from a story he’d heard as a child, yet he knew he had never visited it. James perked up from beside him, grasping Moran’s hand with a smile.
“Yes my little Prince we are.” Sherlock said softly, content to remain where he was and finish his breakfast.
"What exactly do you think you're doing, letting
of Sherlock that were left. He needed something tangible.
"Did you pack the mobile chargers?" He started rummaging through the dresser drawers and the closet.
"We love you too." They said together and smiled as they followed Greg out to his car.
In the hallway Mycroft leaned his face into Greg’s chest, not seeing the small smile that played out on his lover's face. Greg was only too happy knowing John was home safely. It meant the coven would be rebuilding but it also meant his love might relax more now. Might actually let himself enjoy living again. He also knew what Mycroft did not, that Sherlock may be coming along shortly. He did not want to speak that hope however as he remembered how distraught both John and Mycroft had been when last Sherlock was thought to be free. Anthea appeared beside them and hurried into the room, gently tending to John by ensuring he was dressed and warm. She combed out his hair, humming gently as she did and smiling as the mender sank more deeply to sleep. Mycroft was tempted to remain beside the mender; however Greg knew they needed to deal with Meaghan. He slowly led Mycroft back to his study, leaving his lover in his small reverie until they entered.
"It was John's idea." Sherlock cut him off. "He has a fairly logical point about it as well. If we stay here out of sight and out of reach it gives the controller a chance to change the plan. She's not clever enough on her own, but if she connects with enough of the right people we may lose our advantage. If we seemingly play into her plan, then we gain the upper hand on her."
Grunting, John had been in danger, Moriarty had known Sherlock was partial to John.
“One of us has to stay with Hamish.” John hadn’t budged, crossing his arms.
"Oh, I've thought of that already. Angelo has a small room he uses for private situations. He's going to have it prepared for us before we arrive." A small smirk toyed with the corners of his mouth, but his eyes fixated on John's every movement.
“Okay, seriously stop.” Greg sighed, trying to snap them back into the moment. It was bad enough having them flirting, this was positively terrifying.
Two days after Christmas the boys began to prepare for their return to Baker Street. John was especially excited to be going home and had been possessed of almost manic energy for the last two days. They, well he, started packing immediately knowing how difficult it would be to get Sherlock to pitch in. Sherlock had been the exact opposite of John for the last two days. And lethargic for most of the last twenty four hours, simply sprawled out over the edge of the couch barely moving and not speaking. John really felt he had every right to be angry about it but he wasn't, because he was just so glad to be going home. It also didn't hurt (if he left himself be honest) that every time he looked down at his hands he was reminded of just how Sherlock felt about him. Just how much Sherlock Holmes had suffered and gone through to allow John to be safe and happy. John reached up to card his hand through his hair absentmindedly, as he plotted how to pack Sherlock's things without garnering his anger. He was about to move when he Sherlock's eyes actually flicked over to him. The first movement the man had made in hours. John turned pausing with his hand in his hair and smirked as he followed Sherlock's gaze silently. He was reminding himself too, his attention focused on the ring. Then he snapped back to staring at the ceiling. John let him alone for another hour or so before walking over and straddling the detective on the couch. Sherlock gave him his annoyed look and clicked his tongue but John wasn't put off.
"I am so relieved you are well." John whispered, leaning heavily against Sherlock.
"Nothing like you though."
John wouldn't command his troops so efficiently. Just John wouldn't stand so firm and straight ready to charge into battle, and
" Sherlock focused on Mycroft, his thoughts fluttering into his brother's mind. His voice still sounding small and terrified.
"How long has he been at the Moriarty estate?" Mycroft demanded and Anthea answered as firmly as she could.
The next chapter will be smut and fluff while the epilogue will set up the Kid!Lock I will eventually write that will go back and explain everything that happened the summer the Pirate Prince and the Captain met.
"Excuse me?" He couldn't hide his surprise so well this time. John almost smirked as he caught it.
“Previous military experience, judging by the evenness of his stride.” Sherlock continued on. “He attacked from a close distance but the victim was concerned about his, he was turned slightly away from him. Victim died slowly, but there is no blood to suggest he bled out. Likely he was administered a poison to continue the snake bite theory that has pervaded these cases. In his last moments he wrote a note to John, because he was coming to Baker Street to see us. He is the second son of James Pendergrass, and with his daughter Elisa also dead his entire heritage has been destroyed."
"See you in your dreams." He whispered in his ear, pulling his hair gently.
"And that's it?" Lestrade's confusion was clear. "You're just okay with this?"
"Yes milord. I have served her since she was a child." She shivered.
"Of course I did."
“Hey there my little detective,” Greg smirked, pulling Hamish up into his arms.
"Mycroft is sleeping." Sherlock chuckled lowly.
- His tan was darker and he had calluses on his fingers -
"I guessed as much..." John smiled.
"I love you Sherlock Holmes." John whispered as he let himself sink to sleep. He didn't go for the letter in John's jacket and he had no way of knowing that in the hallway Mycroft stood perfectly still, watching them through the doorway.
"I can't believe that this time last year..." Lestrade's voice was tight.
They stepped into the crisp night, their eyes sharpening as their anger grew. They were just about to their gate when they were met by Sebastian. He had been on his way to look in on the newly wedded couple and contented himself to stop by the Holmes estate on the way. He saw the look on their faces however and easily fell into stride beside them. However neither of them were prepared for the low dark growl that issued forth from the ancient vampire when he realized John's shield was in Sherlock's hand.
"How horrible." Molly whispered softly, looking positively awed at John. "Having to hide your heart like that."
The next morning dawned cool and grey, John waking with the sun and immediately setting to his chores. His two younger sisters joining him as they worked with servants to prepare the house. Once the sun rose a bit higher John took his leave of the house, slipping off into the forest near his house to study. He made it easily to his usual place, a darkened clearing where he could rest easily on the low branches of a tree. He settled himself in his usual place, pulling out a sheaf of parchment. He unrolled it and began to read the notes contained therein. He knew Sherlock could walk during the day, he set his quill and ink on the ground and began to scrawl notes on the parchment with the small amount of information provided to him the night before. He then rolled the parchment and pulled out a small leather bound volume he'd made himself. He began to scrawl in details of the night before, before pausing and looking up. Sherlock was thinking about him, he could tell because he felt a flutter in his chest.
"Am I?" John was denied a chance to answer by the waiter making an appearance. They confirmed their food choices and thanked him for their drinks. Then silence descended again. This time it was Sherlock who spoke first. "John," He paused, choosing his words carefully. A look of concentration evident on his face as he did. John fought not to finish the sentence for him, but to let him speak. "What are we now?" His voice was softer, but his eyes did not change, watching every minute movement John made as he reacted to the question.
"You see, your Papa had been very mean but he really thought the boy was beautiful. He desperately wanted to know him better and when he found him and saw how he commanded his troops, your Papa knew he had to have this man in his life. He was very lucky that you Daddy wandered back into it so many years later." He smiled as he finished, finally looking down at Hamish.
"He's been muttering about you since he came in. I'm Doctor Lee; he'll be fine over all. His wounds aren't terrible." The doctor spoke very fast, obviously uncomfortable. "That shoulder wound is going to require a lot of care but we've already stitched it up. It'll likely take him awhile to be able to do anything with it. A few weeks and he'll be ready to start doing some physical therapy, but it may take up to six months for him to regain full use of it. Our records say he's a doctor, so if you'd prefer to have him released sooner rather than later I'm fine with releasing him to go home once we're sure he hasn't sustained any brain injuries. All the tests seem to suggest he's okay but without him being awake to ask, I want to keep him here overnight to be sure." The doctor was friendly and trying to lighten the look on Sherlock's face, but Sherlock didn't even look at him.
"Oh stop it!" Sherlock grunted, finally breaking from his thoughts. "Stop being so damn sentimental." Hamish grunted and Sherlock looked sheepish.
"Oh. He is magnificent is he not? His family thinks very little of him. He spends his time in books and tending to the wounds of their animals and their servants. They believe him to be dull and that he will be nothing but a bane on their family as they try to wed him off. Imagine their surprise if Sherlock Holmes, Lord of this estate waltzes in just days after their first conversation and asks for his hand." Mycroft's words were cold, Sherlock had a terrible fear his brother was going to deny him this.
- Hamish's hair was wet and there was a faint rose scent in the room -
"We did go to war with the kitchen." Sherlock said and tried to look very serious as he did. "That's what making breakfast is about if your behavior during the course of these endeavors is to be believed. But we didn't lose, we don't lose. What are we Hamish?" Sherlock grinned, sweeping over to his son and scooping him up.
They remained locked in the embrace as silence fell, both of them unwilling to let go. Both of them thinking and feeling a thousand things and hardly daring to breath for fear of proving them to be imagined. After a long time, Sherlock finally spoke again but his voice was still a soft whisper against John's ear.
"After we have had rest." He cupped John's cheek in his hand, forcing John to meet his eyes. "I am sorry John, I owe you a great number of apologies for not warning you."
"It's been two years," John protested weakly, his eyes betraying how much he wanted to say yes. How much he knew it would hurt Mary but how his heart begged for everything Sherlock was offering him.
"My power over you is still strong... If not stronger." He purred as John moved.

." Sherlock climbed over John, kissing him and pushing him relentlessly forward towards the head of the bed.
"Greg?!" He shouted and a slight grunt let him know Greg was off to the side behind the couch. He had a nasty bump on his head.
"I owe you the world and more, John Watson-Holmes." Sherlock whispered against his ear. "Because you gave me a heart not once, but twice."
"He is due to return at any moment, my Lord." The servant spoke swiftly.
“Oh spoil my fun.” He sighed as a pout but smiled.
"A mender to be sure." Mycroft purred.
It's off to Mycroft's manor to find relaxation, rest, and a final goodbye.
"Can you two please just stop it. I’m nervous enough without the two of you at each others’ throats. They could be hurt!" Greg finally spoke; he was deeply unnerved by the intensity of the darkness in the two men's voices. Mycroft took a deep breath and straightened himself out. It was then Sherlock noted he was wearing his cufflinks, the ones he wore specifically for Order business. “Greg you are to address me as if you were just the Detective Inspector and not my husband. Do not betray any familiarity, it’s important.” Greg nodded softly.
John couldn't help but feel proud and a little embarrassed that Sherlock's coat was around him as they walked, it dragging on the floor just slightly. He looked up to survey Sherlock's face, trying to learn to read him the way he was so adept at reading John. His features were tightened, protective, and angry. The jacket was a sign to one and all, he was not going to let this happen again. John was
“I am going to have you now, then while we are traveling I am going to make our companions think the vessel is coming apart as I unmake you.” Sherlock promised darkly, dragging John over to the bed.
“You seem relieved by that,” Sherlock demanded, confused.
"What does that stupid card have to do with this Mycroft?! Don't try my patience! It's thin enough as it is!" Sherlock was aware his emotion was showing, that he was utterly incapable of being completely rational in the moment but he didn't care. John had been hurt and he
The boy smiled as Sherlock finished the story but he was almost completely asleep again. Sherlock sighed as he realized that Hamish now had carrot mashed into his hair. He looked over at John and saw that he was awake but looked utterly exhausted. Sherlock hoisted Hamish up and walked over to the door, opening it and walking to the landing.
"Yes." Sherlock didn't ask how he knew. His attention now back on John.
“More lies?! Was he right about you?!” Sherlock demanded, freezing when John let out a wounded noise. He frowned, his heart aching at the noises coming from the mender but unable to stop the rage brewing in his heart. As he turned he realized the room was covered in pictures and other items that shouted memories of his happy life with John at him. He shuddered violently, none of the memories coming into his mind. He shouted in frustration and tore from the room, slamming the heavy door to the library loudly.
"You've been sick a lot over the last year. I think Hamish is sharing too many germs with you." Sherlock sighed softly.
. I owe you a grave debt, John. You still seem not to grasp that I would have lost my entire coven, my whole family. Thus far you have refused every method of repayment I have offered. And though I believe all means I have at my disposal are not enough to repay the debt owed to you, I believe I have finally found something you will accept. I have spent many a night wondering what I may offer you, that you may finally accept, and this is the solution. I am quite certain you will accept this offer." He slowly reached into his coat and slipped out a parchment envelope, sealed. He held it out to John, "Give this letter to your clan father, to Lord Mycroft. It is an offer of truce between our clans, guaranteed so long as
The writing bug has come back and I am hoping that it will stick around for a bit.
"You cried so hard you passed out, Greg and I had to carry you up here." John realized Sherlock was taking his pulse and looked even more confused. "You're catching a cold. You've had a fever since this morning but you didn't seem to be showing any signs of illness until after I brought you upstairs. In fact I think you and Hamish both may have it. Greg says Mycroft should be back next weekend so I'm going to stay here and care for the two of you until then, then I'll figure out how to proceed with the case alone if you're still feeling ill."
" Sherlock almost moaned as he felt how gently John accessed his aura. It was unlike any other mind link he had experienced. A fact he should have expected. John was unlike any other person he had ever encountered. His eyes fluttered closed as he sank into his mind palace, the building he used to house all of his memories and thoughts. "
“Oh come on John, we all want to hear it.” Mrs. Hudson said encouraging him.
“We can’t. We’ve missed so much with Hamish already. I want to go to the dentist with him.”
“No one,” He forced out as he looked down.
“And you.” His father nodded softly, with a sort of look of defeat as he followed them.
"Yes, I suppose they do. But - what do
Sherlock could not fight the wave of heat building inside his body. This display of possessiveness from John was more than Sherlock could have ever imagined. He groaned as he softened and gave himself over to his mates’ actions, moaning loudly when John toyed with his nipples again. His hands scrambled, trying to get John’s trousers off but failing due to the trembling of his body. John chuckled softly against his chest before sliding them off. John leaned down to kissed Sherlock and shouted into his mouth when Sherlock used his legs to slam their bodies together. Their erections brushing against each other as they did.
"Oh. Oh Sherlock!" He whispered, clawing weakly into his lovers shoulders. "I can hear the blood in your veins... Your fingers feel amazing..."
"Is with Greg having breakfast in the cafeteria, honestly relax. He is fine. They gave him a little too much sedative but he is okay." Mycroft started to smile.
“Yes, it turns out that it may be..." Greg started but John cut him off.
We're nearing the first time jump though, so stay tuned!
"So you bed him well then..." Sherlock's voice purred low, he could feel the arousal that was still swimming in John's blood. The arousal that hummed across their bond and began to stir inside his own body. The possessiveness welled up in his chest, along with a powerful need to reclaim what was his.
Each mans' body grew rigid and prepared for danger as they approached the derelict stable. Mycroft's anger skyrocketed as they heard voices followed closely by an anguished cry that could only have come from the mouth of the missing mender. Mycroft held up a hand to still the other three men as a snippet of conversation floated out to them.
"John, I meant every word I ever spoke to you. I... It is like dying. I do not like this. This has been the worst experience of my life and the only person whom I could seek comfort from denied me." He forced the words out, trying to stop himself from clamping down on the normally restrained sentiment.
"The hunger is inside of you, born into you by your birth..." He whispered darkly. "Let it free. Let it find a home in the truth you are desperate to feel." He coaxed. Sherlock let his touch flutter over John's body as John weakly latched on to Mycroft's wrist and drank slowly but steadily.
“Where is my husband?” James asked one of the servants who was relieving him of his burdens, the younger Sebastian growling softly at the term.
"Oh yes, brother. He wishes to have a
"Because our fathers went to war basically." John paused and closed his eyes as the memory came back. "The afternoon after James was killed we'd both snuck out of our wings of the house and met in the drawing room. We were planning to run away because we weren't going to be allowed to be friends anymore. We overheard an argument downstairs and we crept out to the railing to listen. Our dads were shouting. My dad said that the only clear evidence was that Daddy Holmes had killed my Uncle. He screamed and screamed about it while Daddy Holmes simply screamed back that he had been up late with Mycroft and then asleep so his whereabouts were accounted for while the house staff couldn't account for my Dad's. Mycroft snuck up on us while we weren't paying attention and yanked us up by our collars before taking us in the drawing room. He'd just put together that we'd been out on the grounds the night before and he demanded to know what we saw. We told him everything about the man we saw attack Uncle James and he promptly paraded down and told his father we'd witnessed something. We were questioned by the police first together and then individually, but they didn't believe us at all. They tried to say we were lying and we were both rather upset because we knew if they didn't believe us we wouldn't get to stay friends. Dad interrupted the interview I had because I was describing the man who killed my Uncle and I didn't realize it then but I was describing my father. He locked me in my room and told me I was never to speak to Erik again. The next morning the Holmes started making preparations to leave. I shot out the tire of the car and tried to do a bunch of things to delay them leaving but it became clear it was rather inevitable. Mycroft guarded Sherlock's room like a watch dog so there was no way we could talk to each other. So the night before they were supposed to leave I snuck out of the house. I had decided I would go find clues to prove who committed the murder, but a torrential rain blew up and I got stranded near the gardener's cottage under this huge rock. Luckily the storm also kept the Holmes men from leaving because it was bad. One of the worst storms in years. I think I was gone for about a day and a half before anyone even noticed and Georgina was very worried. She seemed to have pieced together that I had been gone longer than just the next morning when I didn't show up to breakfast and in her panic she let it slip to Mycroft that I was missing. Sherlock overheard him telling his father and came to find me. He forced me to take his rain coat so we could walk back to the house and because of it he caught an awful cold. His family was forced to remain a week to wait for him to get better." He sighed, a tear in the corner of his eye.
"I will stop when I need to. I promise." John continued his work trailing kisses down Sherlock's legs and then back up.
emotions, John. They're dangerous. They cause failures, mistakes, and make people falter. It terrifies me that I already have let them sway me so much that
"It's alright John, well it's not but you know what I am trying to say." Sherlock snapped quickly, somewhat irritated at having to explain himself. He softened some however, moving closer to John. "I just don't think you understand how strongly you affect me." They were very close together, mouths only a small space apart. The heat burning in both their eyes as their gazes locked. "It has been a long time since I felt so dangerously close to losing control and taking something I so desperately want."
" He panted, his eyes locking with Sherlock's.
wishes to see
“To mending the hurts of the past.” John toasted slightly, sipping his wine.
"Yes it is. James Pendergrass was my uncle on my mother's side. I didn't know Sherlock was Erik because I blocked the whole summer from my mind, especially after Afghanistan. So I didn't remember his face and since he lied about his name..." John shrugged.
"Should I even bother to ask how you know that?!" John turned to him, his eyes dangerous. "So what? You watched me too, with Mycroft? All this time?! You saw how I was..."
"No." Sherlock cut him off with a sigh. "Mycroft gave me periodic updates, hoping I would..." He paused, his face tightening. It was still too much. He didn't want to admit that he held back because he was terrified. If he kept his emotion away maybe John would be safe again. Deep down he knew that John had never been safe, not from the moment they'd made eye contact. But he wanted to feel like it was safe again. To feel that invincible feeling he'd gotten when they'd chased that cab, so long ago.
A sudden loud noise, like a shrill whistle, startled the two men attacking him and they scattered. Silence descended on the alley as he tried to survey his wounds. His shoulder was bleeding profusely; as were his other wounds. He could feel the darkness trying to press down on him. He needed Sherlock. He shoved his hand into his pockets as best he could, trying to find his phone before he collapsed all the way to the ground.
"John, I... This is not like..." Sherlock tried to force out, but John bit him gently.
John was rooted in place, he wanted nothing more than to call out to Sherlock, to somehow promise their safety or demand the detective prove that he was wrong. He could not find his words, his voice frozen inside as a wall of panic threatened to overtake him. He had nearly prayed he was reading the signs wrong, yet every moment drove them towards the darkness ahead. He opened and closed his mouth a few times, preparing himself to speak. He was denied the opportunity though, as Sherlock found what he was looking for. He clutched the piece of paper, staring at it as if to burn through it, and then darted down the stairs and out the door without a word. The silence that descended around the Mender was heavy and did nothing to help his mood.
"Do not try to patronize me, Mycroft. You don't realize what you've done." Sherlock turned back from him, focusing again on John. John blushed as he watched the emotion in Sherlock's eyes change so rapidly.
“How did you guess what I was thinking?”
"I know. Which is why I will release myself fully into your care tomorrow." John smiled. Sherlock looked surprised but John just shook his head. "This life holds nothing for me... Especially nothing so wonderful as a life with you will. I do not wish to continue this charade, your tutelage can teach me to be more than I ever can as a mortal. Please consider it." John kissed him once more and turned to walk in the house. Just inside the door Sherlock called his name, making him turn back. "Yes?"
"It got worse." John sighed, of course it did. "The next year I got the letter from Sherlock saying that he wasn't going to be a pirate anymore because he was going to become a detective so that we could be friends again. It reopened the wound and I ran away from home for a week because no matter how I tried to fight it, I couldn't hide how badly it hurt me. Harry let me stay with her at the risk of her getting kicked out of her place. We talked a lot but she was still angry with me because I was still lying to myself about what I felt. By then I was so convinced I had lied to myself that I had a furious row with her. I asked her to guard the box of memories from that last summer here and she promised me she would. She put it in a safety deposit box but she lost the key because she was already a heavy drinker. Meanwhile I was being shipped off to Germany every summer to see my cousins, so we lost touch again for awhile. By the time I was seventeen I'd had enough of being there in that fucking house," John sighed when Sherlock tutted at him. "My parents were pressuring me to find a girl to marry and I'd already had at least fifteen girlfriends. I didn't want to get married, I didn't want the life they were trying to shove down my throat. But by then I had so disconnected from my own truth I didn't connect it with Dad's homophobia. I just knew I had to get out of the house. Harry had gone to an addiction center and she put me in contact with her old counselor who helped me file the paperwork to become my own guardian and I stayed in a hostel and worked part time until I could get into Uni. I got full scholarships because of my grades and I went straight from school into the military. No time for stopping, no time for second guesses. Harry and I became even more distant because I refused to accept her drinking and she refused to accept my lack of respect for myself. She hated how I'd found someone I loved so much and now I was reduced to a new girl every week, shagging her, and then leaving her because she wasn't good enough. I couldn't sustain a long term relationship..." He flushed a bit with shame and embarrassment because they were all looking at him with awe, pity, and some sort of adoration.
"Where is John?" Mycroft demanded loudly, stopping Sherlock from speaking out. Sherlock's knuckles were white as he clenched his hand around the Oaken Shield.
“Alright, alright…” He stood, blushing very red as he took up his violin. He refused to look at Sherlock for a long moment, checking the tune of his strings instead. But Sherlock moved so he was directly in front of John, forcing him to look up.
"Another carefully constructed falsehood." Sherlock barked, digging through his clothes.
"Very well then. Why are you here Sebastian?" John asked quietly.
"Well you love him, so that's a step in the right direction." He smiled.
"Yes sir, urgent." The young man nodded. “From Pendergrass Estate, Sir.”
John didn't show weakness like this.
"What's going on?" John asked softly, sitting up some. The room was darker than before, it must be late afternoon.
As always errors, comments, kudos, etc appreciated.
“Moriarty…” John whispered angrily, clenching his fist and going still in his chair.
"I at least thought I did. When we were out on the grounds yesterday, I saw a shadow that looked to be about the right size and shape for his build when we were near the forest." John crossed his arms and Sherlock rounded on him, Hamish confused and sort of stuck in his arms.
"Oh I did, however only in so much as watching you drink another's blood can be. I do not enjoy your bond with my brother. I also know I cannot stop it." Their lips met again with bruising passion as Sherlock slowly, painfully slowly worked in his lover.
"It's alright, I get it. We both have no clue what we are doing." He sighed. He didn't want this tension between them. He needed peace and calm, he needed things to be okay. "But don't get to thinking that mouth of yours will get you out of everything."
"Are you truly wanting of a child? When last we spoke on the matter you seemed to state that you did not wish for them." John asked hesitantly. His mind felt a bit fuzzy, he wondered why James had been able to approach the room without John being able to sense it. He made a mental note to add that as a symptom of the herb. He watched as James took a sip of his wine and made a motion for John to enjoy his.
"Yes he is like you." She nodded.
"How wrong I was," Sherlock whispered, stopping in his paces just before John. Their eyes locked and thousands of unspoken things passing between them.
"Yes, she and I did." She chuckled a bit as the confused expression that deepened on his face. "When you and Sherlock took her in she made it a point to call me at least once a week to update me on her progress. Most of the time though she told me everything she could about you and how you were doing. The first thing she told me was that she was amazed at how easy you were with Sherlock." She leaned back as she spoke, keeping her hand in John's. "She told me she'd never seen two people who looked so much like they belonged together. To her it was like watching a perfect waltz, how you moved in sync with him. I think the worst moment for her was when she slipped up and you and Sherlock had the row that made him leave. She felt like she'd betrayed you. She couldn't believe that she had put you in a position where you would have had to choose between the two of them and she definitely didn't understand why you would choose her and not him. She told me how it broke you and I reminded her that she was the only family you had. That you had lost everything because of your father. I remember how much she cried as she told me how hurt you were, how much you were suffering. I wanted to come to you then, to be with you while you were in your darkest moment - but she told me that the mere suggestion of calling me made you angry. Then your father found out I was speaking to her and came home threatening to murder me if I didn't cut off contact." John gasped.
"Sherlock..." His eyes darkened, his emotion threatening to drown them both.
"You don't think it's too sudden?"
"He told me who he was. He said he was taking his son and grandson to 'set things right' and that he was going to make sure they were protected from their evil sins." Greg grunted and coughed slightly. "I'm sorry..."
“I am happy for your visit.” He motioned for her to join him and they passed several hours simply chatting.
“The facts are glaringly obvious Mycroft. We know what’s going to happen. So now we have to act accordingly. So if you don’t mind John and I have some unpacking to do we meet for dinner to celebrate our engagement this evening.” Sherlock swept off into his room, taking both suitcases with him. John blushed but didn’t react otherwise.
John went to reply but suddenly Sherlock's hot, wet mouth was sweeping over his aching length. He held John's hips down firmly as he worked, John utterly frozen by the sheer sensation sweeping through him. All at once he was pulled down onto Sherlock's lap, their cocks brushing against each other as Sherlock wrapped them both in his hand. Sherlock's eyes burned into John's as he bucked his hips in time with the earnest rhythm John's own desperation set. Their mouths collided in another fiercely hot kiss as John shouted into Sherlock and came hard. Sherlock not long after. Sherlock leaned back against the wall, gasping some at the coldness of it but allowing John to rest against his chest.
“He…” John grunted as his strength ebbed and he collapsed against the bed.
"You always kick me out when you go to your..."
Sherlock crossed his arms and looked at his brother with anger; while this was the most logical thing for them to do it put them in a corner. If they remained in London, Moriarty might have a chance to gain an upper hand on them. If they went, however, they would be forced to remain with the Coven. He slowly turned to look at the Mender whose hands were clenched into the arms of his chair, he could feel the thoughts racing through their bond. The moment slowed and seemed to stretch before Sherlock nodding, turning back to his brother. They would have to go, it would be safest for the Mender and ensure they did not lose any ground for the two enemies to join forces again. John had to be safe.
“Certainly. Where is Gregory? I have not seen him about the manor for a few days.” John’s voice was conversational as he returned to his work, not saying anything when Mycroft’s hand came to rest on his thigh.
"Show him..." Sherlock whispered commandingly and John moved forward very tentatively to put his hand on Mycroft's chest. Every move he made was an example of surrender, culminating only when John's body was only inches from Mycroft's. Mycroft could do nothing but watch with rapt attention as John surrendered to the will of the two men. John's final action was to gently tilt his head to the side, exposing his neck to Mycroft's desperate intentions. Mycroft felt pride, hunger, and something akin to lust flare inside his stomach.
“How could I?” John’s question was bitter but valid. “They will not rest until the seize upon some way to feel they have regained control. There is no way this time. I shall not let fear consume me as it did before and I shall not ever allow Sherlock to fall into Moriarty’s grasp again.” His eyes flashed in the low light of the nearby torches and Gregory could not help but think he looked deadly.
"As he wishes." Sherlock said in a grumbled voice, pulled John up and kissing him. "Come now my beloved, let me show you what it means to belong to a Holmes."
"'M, you think so?" He asked darkly, his face betraying him.
"Yes, they have the transcripts from the actual investigation. They have been involved in this investigation since the beginning but Marcus is too clever with the evidence for them to charge him formally. He accused the elder Holmes of the murder in the hopes it would force Uthur further away from the Order and to separate you two. When the Order last saw Marcus he was possessed of a manic desire to free his children from the clutches of James 'disease.' He has carefully executed every member of James' line and killed Uthur's only son Dominic."
"If you don't tell me about colds how can I believe you'll ever tell me about anything important? What about injuries?" His voice was tight and John felt his eyes sweep back up to meet them.
- Weight - down at least twenty if not thirty pounds. John wasn't eating. His PTSD and depression were devouring him from the inside. He didn't care about his health because he felt he had nothing left to live for.
"Your own foolishness has brought you to this point,
"You started a war and then gave the enemy the information it needed!" Sherlock was shouting and John was taken aback but his throat was still stuck with the realization that Sherlock had heard him trying to threaten Mycroft.
- Irene's voice fluttered through Sherlock's mind. He furrowed his brow as he thought back to the pool.
(See the end of the chapter for
. He bit back the words afraid of what they meant to both of them. Afraid to let that much sentiment out into the world just yet. He sighed heavily and changed his tack. "What happens if you get hurt?!" There was a sort of desperate quality hidden behind his angry tone that made John sag. John returned his gaze to the floor fighting another wave of shame and trying to calm his anger.
"Too bad," John replied almost instantly.
"Brother this is..." He paused several silent heartbeats passing before he spoke again. "J-John?" He asked timidly, as if doubting his own eyes.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for sticking with me this far!
"You told Mycroft a fortnight." John countered.
Notes on Vampiric abilities:
John sputtered, as if he had been doused with freezing water, his mind suddenly pulling back from the hazy place it had been sent to. As his eyes focused he found Sherlock in his focus and not Mycroft, causing him to frown in confusion. Mycroft growled from across the room, pulling himself up from where he had smacked into the wall.
"You're awful heavy, John." He chided, sinking down beside him on the bed and pulling John's wrist in his hand.
"No, this is definitely more than an ego boost. Those are what he gets when you compliment him at crime scenes." Lestrade laughed and John giggled.
"We're nutters, the both of us." He conceded, looking over at John.
"Mycroft this is not…"
"I know you hate it but Mycroft is right about this place." John's eyes were closed by his voice cut straight through Sherlock's musings.
“Alright…”
"I do, Lord Holmes. I realize how terribly I injured my dearest cousin though I understand how you may believe otherwise. I have received news through my servants who have spoken with yours in the markets and other places to learn the whole of the knife I so carelessly wielded. I have sought out the details of the depths of sorrow that I brought your family with so careless intention.  Only the fear I am experiencing would draw me to even attempt to beg forgiveness from my cousin now as I certainly am not deserving of receiving it. John," She turned to him, her eyes full of dread. "I do not feel safe. I do not feel well. I beg of you, please help me in the final stages of this pregnancy. I fear that my husband is some how desirous of an end to this pregnancy without the birth of a healthy child."
***Trigger warning***
"I believe the opposite is true, my little love. I believe that he cares deeply for you and yet does not want to give you more torment by having you torn between us. I shall endeavor to be better, John. I do not want you hiding in the thatch any more. I want you to return to me and allow me to help you through the sea of your emotion. I am not the best at it, but I wish to try for you." He leaned down and claimed John's mouth in a gentle kiss, tightening his hold on him until their bodies were flush together. John shivered as his emotion tried to break free and Sherlock kept kissing him until he felt John melt into the comfort of their embrace.
"You'll catch cold." Sherlock scolded him, draping his own coat around his husband's shoulders. John turned to face him but his eyes refused to focus.
"Sherlock, I can't do this right now!" John had felt like he was going to explode, rage and anxiety clawing at his chest as he watched Sherlock drop right back into case mode without regard for the feelings either of them were having.
"Aside from half drowned in this cup of tea, I'm... Getting there." John proffered, trying to actually drink his tea this time.
, to poison you?" His words were so... So full of emotion that it deflated John's anger and disarmed him. Their eyes locked as words poured free of both of them.
"He's come for you John. He thinks that your history with women makes you easily swayed. He thinks he can save you from your 'wicked nature' and he intends to force you if you don't listen. He will hurt you if you're not careful." Jacob warned.
"I want to claim you again." Mycroft demanded, slipping his shirt off.
"Ja, ich fürchte, so." Jacob put his hand on his shoulder. "Und du bist auch."
Hello my beautiful readers. I know it has been an age (seriously I took a Sherlockian hiatus there) but this store is most assuredly #NotDead and I do intend to keep to a 2-3 month update cycle now that I have wrapped up some other responsibilities in my life.
"Chelation," Sherlock finally whispered, but his focus was still missing. "Chelation and mineral supplements…" Lestrade moved to say something when John shouted.
"Oh but you are." Mycroft purred and kissed over the back of his neck. John groaned, falling back against Mycroft's chest.
"Flu." Sherlock corrected him and hovered.
"God," John groaned as fire bloomed in his stomach. Mycroft closed the door to his room, turning to face John. "Y-you love me?" He asked in a shaking voice.
"I will, I promise." Sherlock smiled but his anxiety still rolled through both of their chests. John nodded understanding the feeling they were sharing and slowly sat up.
could feel this much." He sighed again, clenching his teeth. "She was
“A mortal male was found dead, however there is no evidence of how he was killed. He is alone in an abandoned house.”
"I can feel your need, the need in both of you." John whimpered, his eyes closed. Mycroft shifted out of his sleeping clothes and his under things so the three of them were naked in the bed together. John perfectly between them.
"I already know this. I saw it all in your blood." He whispered, shivering slightly. "These observations you have made are incredible. You have found many of the truths hidden by our kind."
“It doesn’t matter; you’ll never see him again. I’m taking you away. I’ve arranged it all. You’d better say your goodbyes. Your son won’t be coming with you.” Marcus grinned looking down at his phone.
"Through the hunter of course. A week later the hunter returned to the city with three guards and Lord Moran in tow. Lord Moran had himself seen the evidence of the hunter's story of his healing by looking to his blood memory. He had come to Summer straight away as he himself was quite ill. He beseeched me for my assistance, promising me all manner of rewards if I would accept his offer. He offered the type of rewards that made my young mind hazy with desire. However before satisfactory arrangements could be made between Sebastian and my uncle the full affliction took him and he became gravely ill. I worked diligently to cure him, despite my uncle's continued protests and spent the better part of a week caring for him and sharing my blood with him." Sherlock growled darkly and jumped up, moving to pace through the room.
“He is my son; I can do whatever I want. If I kill him it’s none of your concern.” Mycroft went to say something else when Sherlock suddenly appeared in front of Marcus, leaping gracefully down and landing perfectly in front of him. "A trick?!" He growled and snapped but no sniper sights came.
"I promise, Mycroft. If for some reason something should happen to Sherlock or if he crosses any lines I shall come to you." His voice was thick as their eyes locked. John could read how Mycroft yearned for him and he wanted to unite their mouths but he hesitated.
John couldn't tear his eyes away from how Sherlock Holmes, the great emotionless detective, seemed to just melt under his fingers. He'd always wanted to touch him like this. He'd imagined it over and over again. His heart pounded in his chest as their eyes met again. His feelings for this man weren't proper, they weren't right, but they were unstoppable. He'd tried to deny them after his death. Tried to tell himself it was just normal grief.
"He took them both." Greg forced out.
"Hamish Gwegowy Watson-Holmes!" Hamish said loudly, puffing his chest out proudly.
“The investigator described the blood found at the scene as having two distinct characteristics. The first, clearly the blood of the mortal woman found there, was just beginning to coagulate when they arrived, that is part of how they were able to determine the time she died. The other pools of blood were dark black, only enough to have clearly come from defensive wounds, thus showing the blood of the killer. When shed from the body, vampire blood behaves in certain characteristic ways, including turning black shortly after exposure to the air. As it had not yet hardened the time frame fits and the killer was not injured enough to have stopped him or her from moving about in the daylight.” John replied conversationally, he flicked through a few pages of the document as he did, trying to ignore the piercing gaze that was bearing down on him.
Hours later when darkness had set in Sebastian pushed the carriage over. He bit down on his wrist, offering it to the mender who drank a bit but was too weak to feed much. He took the broken body into his arms and mounted his horse, riding full speed for the coast. Mycroft was on his way to the forest when they met, John’s body still covered in dried blood and his wounds still only partially healed.
"If you need anything, just call." John told her and she nodded.
"It has." His lover conceded, his mouth sliding across John's jaw and down onto his shoulders, his tongue putting just enough pressure on the love bite there to make John arch. "My mind can't stop, but I have been woefully neglectful of you and our son. I mean to remedy that as soon as this case is closed." The tongue pressed in again and John softly cried out.
"Oh I was merely testing his desire to learn. I am most pleased and will dispatch someone to his parents on the morrow to inform them he will come under our wing. We shall move him here and teach him the ways of the world." Mycroft smirked as John flushed.
"Baker Street? He isn't there anymore." Mycroft's voice betrayed his slight amusement as Sherlock looked at him incredulously. "Why would he be? It's been two years. He's got on with his life."
"I should help." John smiled and kissed Sherlock's cheek.
took all of your attention, your focus, your time. Completely blinding you while he fell all over himself to try and support you!" They were speaking softly but Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson could clearly hear each and every word. "When she was finally taken down I put that choice to him of what to tell you. The truth and a lie, and he chose to lie to you. Knowing just as I do that you would know clearly that he was lying. He tried because he wanted, needed you to have closure! He
"I don't guess."
"Hamish and I had settled down in his room to watch a movie so John could get some sleep. Just about ten minutes in I heard a loud crash. I heard John shouting at someone and I realized he was trying to convince someone that he was alone in the house. I figured that meant trouble so I picked Hamish up and took him down to one of the unused rooms and we locked ourselves in a closet. It took them about an hour but they found us and they hauled us out. One of the men pinned my arms in place and they took Hamish away from me. He screamed and screamed, trying to bite and kick at them. Eventually one of the men gave him an injection of something, I think a sedative. John came flying down the stairs in a rage when he saw that, he managed to take out two of the guys before this big tall man walked up and backhanded him so hard I thought his head might come off. He started cursing him out, shouting about how he was going to cure him. John was just revving up to fight the man when the guy behind him pistol whipped him in the back of the head and he went down in a heap. Then the idiot with the gun on me hit me with the butt of his gun and they hauled John and Hamish out of the house."
"There is no correct or incorrect way to feel right now, our mender. If you wish to be alone or if you wish us to remain close either is natural and acceptable." Mycroft offered, keeping a bit of distance but offering warmth and comfort in his words and actions. "If you wish us to remain near you we are able and willing. If you wish us to let you rest alone, we shall. Whatever you need from us is what you shall get."
Before either of them was aware of it the heat of the moment swept them up, Sherlock could not stand the wait long and was begging for John to put more fingers in him far before he was truly ready. John did his best to stay rational and not give into their passion, however, it did not last. Sherlock shouted half in pain and half in pleasure as he used his legs to force John to sink inside of him in one desperate motion. John shouted and clawed into Sherlock’s shoulders, nearly overwhelmed by the sensation of being surrounded by his mate. He slowly pulled out and pushed back in, resisting Sherlock’s whimpers and pleas to speed up as best he could. Then when he felt Sherlock beginning to tighten he sank his teeth into his mates’ neck and drank deeply from him, groaning when he felt Sherlock’s teeth sink into his chest over the scar. The sensation sent him spiraling through his own release and both could only drink for a moment before collapsing in a heap.
"John hush," Mycroft's voice was soft and he moved closer to him. "What is the poison?"
“While that may be true, especially when it related to the things you might say, I do not think calling on me while he has been away this past fortnight is necessarily the best choice you could have made. It certainly does not provide me comfort, given the circumstances of our last meeting.” He kept his voice calm, but his fight or flight mechanisms kicked in, making his muscles tense. Mycroft frowned, and then let out a soft sigh when he saw how rigid the others’ body was. After a moment he let out a forced breath to clear his mind and allow him to focus, his mask of anger shifting to reveal something softer, vulnerable, and anxious underneath.
"Then why did you tie me up? Because both know that when I'm restrained you,
"What is going on?" She demanded as she looked at the state of the four of them. She was still chuckling slightly as she noticed not only John but Sherlock and Greg had bandanas on and that Greg and John were still holding pokers. They looked a sight, their sleeves rolled up to their elbows and white and blue bits of sheet tied around their heads. Hamish was flush from excitement but looked down as he pouted in the way he only could have learned from his detective father.
"No!" John shouted from the other side of the door, his voice hoarse and filled with pain. "I am not going to let you in here, Sherlock!"
"When what?" The tongue click again. John would need more time become reacquainted with it.
brought into my life. I was so content on being alone and isolated before we met. He would have had no leverage over me." He mused softly, still pacing. His brow furrowed with both confusion and intent. "But you came into my life and I suddenly had people I cared about, people who mattered. But none more than you. And he knew that. My death was necessary, in order to protect you. That was his condition. If I lived you died. If I died,
"I guess that's part of my charm isn't it?" They both laughed, trying to keep their voices down as they did. “I keep doing the things you don’t expect me to do.” Sherlock kissed John softly as they kept trying not to laugh louder.
As always comments are appreciated!
"Stop thinking," He snapped, his fingers finding the clasp on Johns belt. Suddenly his trousers were gone and he was almost completely naked while Sherlock was still completely clothed. John groaned in protest but he received a swift smack on the ass for that. He grunted. "No, John, I'm doing this how I want to." John groaned as Sherlock's hand slid down, taking his pants with them. Those long fingers pressing into every inch of skin on his legs.
"Look at you," Mycroft groaned, now shifting out of his trousers. "So desperate for this... For me... Even though you and Sherlock have done little else aside from bond for months now." His tone was dark, demanding and dominating. A hint of jealousy rolling through his eyes and reverberating in John's body.
"Oh all right, that's enough of that!" He laughed.
"Just let go." Sherlock whispered, moving so he could kiss John's jaw and nibble his ear. "Let me see how I get to you." His voice was part commanding, part pleading. It had been so long since John had even wanted someone to touch him like this and the fact that it was Sherlock wasn't helping his resistance.
"Clever mender," He purred, pushing him back down and joining their lips in a heated kiss.
"You've repaired an old wound, you two. And not just for me. The Order can now begin to rebuild its' image and protect the rights of its' members in new ways. I cannot express to you how vindicating it is to know that James' true murderer has been brought to justice. I think if he would be most pleased to know that it was the two of you that ended this mess. To know that his favorite nephew and the man that stole his heart before he even knew what it meant overcame so much to bring the past to a close. I can never repay you for what you've given me. You've avenged my heart, my children, and the children of my heart. If you ever need anything, anything at all please write to me John. James would be so proud of the men you've become." He sighed and Jacob smiled. "I am returning home to mourn my children and my lover. Perhaps you can come visit sometime." Uthur smiled and he stood, bowing curtly before walking out.
But Sherlock was already up, remembering the little box. He grabbed the salve and the box, setting the box down where John could reach it. He gently applied the salve to the welts. He washed his hands and returned with a glass of water for them box, dragging John up to sitting position. He opened the box to reveal two gold chains with two small key shaped pendants on them. He blushed a bit as John took one.
"I love you Daddys! Get those bad guys!" Hamish giggled.
"What's a Solvanar?" Sherlock asked curiously, looking to his brother.
"You're not like him!" John shouted in a low angry whisper that was full of emotion. His grip relaxed but did not release Sherlock. After which Sherlock allowed himself to meet his eyes again. They both were silent for a moment as if catching their breath.
"We should go home." John laughed and Sherlock mocked surprise.
"Yes. You need to rest and recover." He sat up slightly, looking down at John. "You need somewhere that my full attention can be on you and you don't have to worry so much about what happens next. I need you safe. Mycroft can give us all of those things. Just don't expect any family dinners."
"That's a boring and ordinary question. The answer isn't very helpful to what you do, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps you would prefer to ask the proper question?" Jacob said sternly crossing his legs and sitting back. Sherlock had the awareness to look miffed. "You want to know more about the history between the three families and the murders that have come to tear them apart. So I will have to start at the beginning." He cracked his neck.
"You two be careful." Mrs. Hudson said softly as John walked over and knelt down to look at Hamish.
"This sounds a lot like you're going back to London too." John's brow was furrowed with worry.
"He is rather occupied at the moment and I am quite loath to disturb him. I do appreciate your concern however and I am quite sure he would offer you the same compliment were he available. I am rather curious however as you have yet to respond to my several entreaties seeking satisfaction that those who brought this darkness to him have been properly handled." Mycroft propped his elbows on the desk, crossing his fingers under his chin. He kept his eyes soft but his guard was raised.
Sherlock watched dispassionately as James fussed about fixing the younger Sebastian’s shirt and cuffs, his eyes dulled from a week of abusing words and violent fights with James. James barely acknowledged Sherlock as Sebastian rejoined them, heading for the door without so much as a glance back as his husband. As soon as their carriage was out of sight Sherlock headed for John’s room, growling when he found nothing in the room to suggest John had even been there recently.
"I never betrayed him!" She shouted, but looked worried.
"Good." She noted his face as he though. "The same but not, a criminal and a detective," Her voice was soft, full of meaning.
"Look, I wasn't trying to upset you. I know you want him to stay beside you for work and I know why you're doing it. I know what it's meant to say. I know it's meant to be a sign to the world not to mess with John Watson because you will get the violent end of Sherlock Holmes' temper. But maybe you could get him a necklace or a ring or something. Something a little more permanent that doesn't equate to you hurting him or remind us all that you two are shagging each other senseless," He finished his coffee and looked up at Sherlock.
"Mmhmm..." He grumbled.  “Make it better.” He demanded and John chuckled slightly. Their little Prince was so much like his father.
Sherlock directed the driver where to go but his mind was racing; it was racing faster than it normally did when he was chasing criminals. Trying to process the insane amount of data he was trying to sort through while ignoring the sinking feeling in his gut. He was worried; the guilt nagging at his stomach was too much for him to allow himself to relax. He'd lost two hours; which meant John had suffered for two hours. He would already be in the next stage of the poison's course and it would be immensely painful. This was a failure on his part and he wanted to make sure it didn't continue on longer than necessary. When the car pulled up to the alleyway about a block from the warehouse, Sherlock jumped out before it came to a complete stop; Lestrade was waiting for him, his team in dark clothing and concealing their weapons just as Sherlock caught up to them. Sherlock moved quickly around, surveying the situation and gathering data – but the way he moved was disjointed and distracted a far cry from his normal behavior. He turned to Lestrade, who was concerned by the look on his face. He'd never dealt with an emotional Sherlock and it was rather frightening.
"Yes, I am afraid I had to call you from your thrilling bout of doing nothing because the Duke has responded. He gives his blessing to your marriage and has called for a dinner in your honor this evening. The three of us shall be going, then tomorrow we shall finalize the plans for your ceremony. It is my hope that within a fortnight you two will be on your way to Paris.
"John, please." Sherlock said softly, moving to sit beside him. Sherlock didn't want him to be angry and in a moment John's feelings pierced the rage growing inside of him, forcing his face to become concerned and sorrow filled in an instant. John's own anger faded, seeing the truth in Sherlock's face.
"Nor do I, but I believe that John's logic in this instance is sound. Just tell me what you need." Mycroft sighed.
"So that's why you went to Sherlock for a story?" She whipped around. "Or why he went to
Mycroft was the first to wake several hours after sunrise. He knew the time by the noise of the servants moving throughout the house. He slowly looked over and saw that Sherlock was also awake, his eyes focused on Mycroft with a sort of deep stare - as if trying to look through him. Mycroft bore his attention simply as he pulled himself out of the bed. John barely shifted, in a deep comfortable sleep as his body processed the next stages of his rebirth. Mycroft gently caressed John's cheek before pulling his dressing gown on. Sherlock sat up, noting that John barely registered his shift and pulled his own robe on. He stretched and Mycroft walked over to the desk area, sitting down in a large arm chair. Sherlock took the one across from him, both of them able to watch John.
"Yes, that's what it does. Which means I'll be stuck in the house with you and Hamish with only old case files to occupy you," John teased, clearly hinting that he was the one worse off in the situation. "Greg, when do you head back to London?"
Sherlock lead John through the flat, helping him as they showered and changed. They finished preparing just as Mycroft's rap echoed in the hallway downstairs. Mrs. Hudson let him in and they had a short conversation before made his way up to the flat. When he entered John was sitting on the couch, his shirt only on at the wrists and a cup of tea on the table in front of him. A first aid kit was open next to a cup of black tea for Sherlock, who was sitting on John's right side cutting away the old bandage from his shoulder. They were talking softly with their eyes focused on each other, not even looking up until Mycroft spoke.
"I need to go to my mind palace." John snorted with laugher and just took the glare Sherlock gave him.
"Yes my little mender?"
" He chuckled softly as Sherlock flushed. "
"You are stripped of your title and you are to remove yourself from my city!" The Duke shouted.
"Let me in!" Sherlock demanded, his voice echoing off the walls of the hallway as he shouted. His voice shook with exhaustion and emotion but he remained firm.
"Get away from me." He tried to say firmly but his voice shook, his body responding to James' touch. He tried to struggle but James pinned him harder, enjoying the fight.
"Nor I. Least of all with a Moriarty present." Mycroft's scowl was not hidden.
"What?" The detective demanded as he slowly sat up, he was observing John - trying to deduce how John had hidden that plan from him. "You knew he was going to kidnap you?"
"What?" Sherlock suddenly realized the gravity of what he'd just revealed and he actually blushed slightly.
"Come on my little one," Mycroft said soothingly. "You are okay, you are with me." He promised as he carried John out of the room without bothering to close the door. His entire being focused on the shivering vampire in his arms.
Sherlock sighed softly as the carriage drove along, another residence abandoned and yet another move for ‘safety.’ James had long since stopped pretending to care what happened to his husband and Sherlock knew it was only a sense of foolish pride that made it so James refused to allow him to return to his coven. Their relationship was strained and Sherlock, having grown bored with his life, had begun experimenting; some of his experiments causing their residences to require their immediate vacancy and one particularly memorable experiment almost costing the life of the young Sebastian Moran, a deed which did not go unpunished. James was no longer cautious about hiding his romantic feelings or intentions for Moran and the small coven that James was building often talked about how Sherlock must be unworthy. Those words began to gnaw away at Sherlock until he became moody and distant, refusing to speak to anyone. When he did, he often proclaimed every detail about the person until they slunk away in a fit of shame - a habit which was quickly making him the enemy of James’ coven and on the brink of costing James everything. James had begun negotiating a truce with his Sire, Sebastian, especially once he discovered that Sebastian now had a pet of his own.
I have most of the chapters written in my head, it's just getting them on the page. I just got a new laptop for traveling so I should be able to get the next chapter out within less than 6 months. Fingers crossed!
"Of course." Mycroft smiled and took John to feed.
"Another new one? What did the last one do?" Lestrade laughed as he sat down.
"Very well, I'll dress and go at once. Will you inform them when they wake?" He asked quickly.
Sherlock was finally able to begin doing normal activity just in time for Christmas. Mycroft, Greg, Molly, and Mrs. Hudson joined them at the estate and the eight of them had a magnificent time. Sherlock announced his plans for taking his family on holiday - first a ten day trip for Hamish, John, and himself and then a five day long weekend trip with just John. Greg and Mycroft agreed to watch Hamish so the two of them could go and just before New Years the family finally returned to Baker Street. Sherlock had a case to attend to and so it wasn't until February that Sherlock  was finally able to take his family on their vacation to Disney World. Hamish had the time of his life and by the time they returned home he was absolutely obsessed with every Disney movie he could get his hands on, much to Sherlock's displeasure. But Sherlock knew what he'd really been looking forward to was now on the horizon. He'd waited almost two months and now he was finally going to have John
"I am well fed and strong, do not tempt my jealousy now." He warned but he kissed John again all the same.
Mycroft set the soap down, his hands finding their way into John's hair and wrapping him in a strong embrace. He kept their mouths moving together, a sort of frenzied passion building between them as their bodies absorbed the warmth of the water and flushed with their efforts. Mycroft tugged on his hair, exposing his neck which he covered with kisses. A low feral sort of growl rumbled from John's throat as he first struggled and then consented to Mycroft's work.  He groaned as his little fledgling gave him dominance and continued to kiss all over his neck, chest, and jaw before finding his lips and claiming them anew. He felt John's erection hardening between them and brushing against his own reawakened cock. It did not take long before the two of them were bucking against each other, their mouths moving furiously as they did.
"Oh God... You are incredible." Mycroft purred in his ear.
"Mycroft, will you join me this evening?" Sherlock asked him, the three men sitting around the table as John descended the stairs. Hamish was on the couch watching some television show.
"Oh, yes." John leaned forward and sorted through the small stack of papers on the table with a furrowed brow. "It was right here." He continued looking as his confusion grew. Mycroft looked at Sherlock. Sherlock looked out the window and when he turned back there was a clear but unspoken conversation between the brothers. John raised his eyes from the table to Sherlock, who was looking firmly at Mycroft and did not see the look that passed on John's face. Mycroft however, did not miss it and asked his brother a silent question, raising his eyebrows.
"Ah finally you’ve arrived Mr. Holmes." Marcus smirked and stepped away from John. "I didn't ask you your opinion on how I discipline my son."
"It's the only thing he likes to watch when he's sick..."
"It's not your fault Greg." Sherlock said softly but he stood. "NO ONE MOVE!" He shouted and everyone froze.
“What is it?” Mycroft’s voice trembled as he asked, not comforted by the look on his lover's face as he closed the door and returned to the room.
"Sherlock!" John shouted, struggling against the shirt that held him.
"Sherlock? John?" She called out quietly. "Detective?!"
"I just wanted to be sure he was okay... Where's the 'Government?'"
“I do not understand.”
"You have no idea what you've done, Marcus." John spat the word at him and he flinched. "You've brought a hell down on yourself you can never be prepared for. My husband is not a man you want to mess with. I hope you’ve made your peace."
"Oh,  it is warm." John said stupidly and Mycroft ran his fingers through his hair.
"Use me to pleasure yourself! Touch my cock, please, Master." John dissolved and just gave in. He was too desperate to feel Sherlock working him over.
-The panic inside his heart, unable to do anything.
"Yes. I would do anything for Sherlock." He replied sternly.
"Do not trouble yourself with more than that, your Excellence. I shall see that he is properly punished in light of all his crimes. As you know we have our own laws when it comes to violations against mortals. I am terribly sorry for your loss and to know one of my kin caused it deeply grieves me. I had hoped this bond would strengthen our ties not ruin them.” Moran sighed darkly, turning to face Moriarty. “Fledgling on your knees." He growled, his aura rising and pushing down on those of all present. Moriarty trembled but slowly sank to his knees under the control of his Sire.
John poured the two cups of tea and sat down at the table while Sherlock opened the tin and set two biscuits down in front of John, taking one himself as a show of solidarity. John tried to focus and make himself eat his, but the effort didn't go well. He hadn't had anything solid in three days, making his stomach a bit confused at the sudden addition of sugary cookie. He looked up and caught the intensity with which Sherlock was watching him, fascination evident on his face. John blushed.
"John..." Sherlock had gone to the door and come back, his impatience only growing.
“You are no better than a whore like this.” Sebastian growled darkly, leaning forward and watching the mender shudder as his energy washed over him.
"What's wrong? We both know resting will help you heal faster."
"You're so pathetic," Marcus voice growled near his ear. He was strung up on some sort of board, his hands and feet bound tighter than they should be. There were several small hooks pressed against his skin so that if he moved they would bury themselves in his flesh and cut at him.
The next morning dawned overcast and grey matching John's mood as he pulled himself from bed. Sherlock had rolled over during the night, likely during some dream and was now splayed across two thirds of the soft mattress. John got up and pulled a fresh pair of pants, trousers, and a t-shirt from the dresser before slipping them on. Just as he was about to head into the living room he heard Sherlock mumble. It wasn’t very often that Sherlock talked during dreams, so he easily held John’s fascination as he did so now.
"Oh don't be an idiot, I told you as much." John looked pained and Sherlock ran his hands gently over his back to calm him. "That's why dad was so angry about our friendship. That's why I stopped thinking about boys that way. It's stupid to think I was a ten year old boy and knew that I would never feel that way about another human being in my life, no matter how hard I tried."
"Don't be sentimental." Sherlock chided, John sighed. "It means I love you too."
“Something has happened.” She gasped out as she ran inside, closing the door on the daylight. She was panting from her ride. “Their carriage was attacked.”
“You should not…” John began.
"Where are we?" John croaked out, taking the blood wine Mycroft offered with a shaking hand.
- How could he have been so blind? John had ruined Moriarty's plan and in that one moment, that first moment become a target.
"Yes, I believe they call it a 'Dom Mark' or so I am told. It's very crude of you."
“I will not. There is nothing that can take me from you now. We are safe, and we are home, together.” He whispered, his voice full of emotion. “Please my love, go feed and I shall meet you in our room. I need to talk to Mycroft for just a moment.” He promised.
are you doing?" John crossed his arms again stepping into the room and giving off his very best 'this is not okay' look, Sherlock sagged a bit with a pout.
"Mum, we went through this already. You're talking yourself in circles. I forgave you, I mean it." John put his hand on her arm before standing up. He gave Sherlock a gentle kiss over the arm of the couch, Sherlock leaning his head back to meet him.
"Yes." John sighed as he admitted it. "I had a friend when I was younger but I can't remember what his face looked like."
will?" Mycroft barely breathed as he leaned over John to inhale the scent coming off of him. He pressed his nose gently against the crease of his neck, groaning. John groaned softly himself, the power of Mycroft's need cutting off the rationality of his thought.
"John!" He shouted, arching but finding his hips forced back down onto the bed by John's eager hands. John increased the pressure on those pale hips, digging his fingers in as his mouth and tongue worked eagerly over the shivering, burning flesh in his mouth. It was not much longer before Sherlock cried out, his release spilling into John's mouth and his body going utterly limp underneath him.
"Our mender needs mending." Sherlock replied simply and hoisted John into his arms, carrying him into the room.
"Well I suppose there are several of us who have John's safety as our priority." Mycroft stood and paced towards the window, looking out over the weakly lit afternoon. "John what do you think of this truce?"
"That seems to be something you're exceptionally good at, misinterpreting others intentions." John's eyes burned into Mycroft's but neither revealed the true depth of their emotion. "But no it won't happen again because she's resigned herself to die. But
"Oh fuck..." Sherlock's mouth hitched into a wry smirk as he saw John react to his words.
He sank down into his old, dusty armchair, pinching the bridge of his nose. He took a deep breath as her footsteps disappeared and the silence swallowed him whole, his eyes falling on the empty chair across from him. His face tightened, his hands clenching against the arms of his chair as he tried to quell the storm rioting in his chest. He didn't want to admit it. To admit how much this dusty old flat, even now after two years of echoing silence, felt more like home than his own sparse, clean one. He'd come to say goodbye. He knew Mary would have come with him if he had told her the truth, but just now he didn't want her with him. Not here. Not in this place...
" It was a childish reply but Sherlock was angry and sulking.
"Out with it my little mender." Mycroft said gently, moving to cup his cheek. Sherlock froze.
"This is not a joke Mycroft. Every fortnight for months now he has come to spend the day with you. He has not returned and was not expected to return to me until sunset!" Panic filtered through Sherlock's mind, if John hadn't been with Mycroft where had he been all those days?
"Oh..." He said softly after opening and closing his mouth a few times. "Well I suppose I did something right then." It was a weak reply but he did not have anything better to offer. His mind already rife with the possibilities that lay before him. As soon as this very evening he would be with his beloved, permanently.
." Sherlock teased.
"Really?" John asked in an exasperated voice. "We're going to do this again?" He motioned between the two of them with his good arm. Sherlock refocused his full attention on John's wound, applying the cleaning solution and medications as required. It was a long tense moment before he spoke again.
“Easy my love, he cannot harm you now.” James whispered, guiding Sherlock away. He nodded and another bolt tore through John’s stomach, falling on the ground behind him. He sank to his knees, trembling.
“You!” John growled.
“Actually it is, see if you intend to harm him I’ll have to cancel our arrangement. I cannot have you hurting him; it will damage my brother’s heart too significantly. He’ll come looking for you.” Mycroft’s tone was terse.
“No goodbyes? Oh well, I guess regret will keep you then.” He turned fully back to Sherlock a pistol firmly in his hand and pointed at Sherlock. It was only at waist level when the sound of a sniper rifle punctuated the room.
