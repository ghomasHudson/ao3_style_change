"It's not that I don't want you around." Dean said. "The opposite, actually. It's just, I don't like when you growl and snarl for no reason. There's nothing you can do, you've gotta accept that."
"Is there a name you would prefer me to call you?" Castiel asked. He couldn't think of a shorter version of 'Dean,' but it wouldn't hurt to ask.
Michael smiled, though there was no sincerity in his expression. He shifted weight from one leg to the other, almost lazily.
"What is this?!" Castiel demanded, yanking his head up to stare at Dean. Dean stared back at him with wide, panicked eyes.
Claire giggled and Dean smirked and Castiel realized they were just teasing him. He offered a hesitant smile and left to wash up and get changed into more comfortable clothes.
"They will be dearly missed." Castiel said, grief beginning to outweigh his anger so the full effects were felt. Castiel dropped until he was sitting with his legs out in front of him and he back straight against the walls.
He leaned forward so he was resting his head on the spare space on Dean’s chest next to Jack. He felt Dean’s free arm wrap around his shoulders.
"It started off a little rough, but it got better." Dean answered. "Claire didn't want to put her things away, and so I asked her why she didn't want to when she knew it was the rules. She said that she just didn't want to, and I told her about how when I get mad or upset I sometimes do things that I feel bad about later. That at least softened her up a bit, then I told her I would time her so she can see how quickly she does it every day, like a game. She found that much more enjoyable.
Castiel was ashamed to admit that everything after that went a little fuzzy. He could feel Dean squeezing his hand. He knew Dean was shouting. He could hear himself speaking softly to Dean. But it was like he was watching everything from a different point of view than his own.
Castiel let go of Dean’s dorsal fin and moved to the caudal fin. Its shape was more of a fan, rather than the whale-like tail that humans typically assumed. Castiel brushed his fingers over the fin.
Castiel listened to his mate hum. Dean moved leisurely from the hall to the living room before he finally came into view of the dining room. He froze when he caught sight of everything.
Castiel felt his wings flittering nervously (as much as they could). He didn't understand what Dean was trying to say.
Castiel just said goodbye and left with Claire. He didn't want to think about what Gabriel said, it was pointless.
It wasn't a complete lie. Castiel already knew Dean was a Nephilim, but that didn't completely explain why the demons wanted him, but there wasn't much that the demons could do with that information alone. There could be more to uncover.
Dean couldn’t stop himself from shivering at the timbre of Castiel’s tone. He found himself desperate to continue on with this toying banter, to rile up the alpha.
"After you." Castiel said, gesturing. Dean grinned at him and stepped out of the elevator. Castiel followed close behind. He nodded at the desk workers and security guards as he and Dean exited the building.
Castiel was stiff and uncomfortable throughout his first meeting, though it went well overall. He was practically sweating when Naomi stepped foot in his office.
There was a sharp crack from somewhere outside of the bedroom, but Castiel did not flinch. He ended his call with Gabriel and dropped the phone down on the bed.
There’s a post-it note on the fridge when Dean walks by in the morning. He pauses to glance over the familiar writing.
Dean was already struggling to continue on. He had to stop often because he felt terribly sick. Castiel offered to carry him, but Dean always refused and insisted Castiel save his strength. It was horrible to have to watch Dean stumble to his knees and retch onto the ground, his body trembling in an attempt to rid itself of everything.
Ellen squinted at him, then grabbed his arm and pulled him into a hug. Castiel couldn’t help but melt into her touch. He blinked against the sudden wetness in his eyes.
They stared at one another, almost tenderly, until Dean cleared his throat. "Is there anything else the demons said?"
"You're fifth." Castiel spat, his tone low and cold. "You bring so much pain to Dean. He deserves to treated with respect and love."
Not knowing what else to do, Castiel reached for his phone, which he had left on his nightstand that morning.
Castiel felt a pang deep in his chest and a lump form in his throat. “Now, Claire, I am sure that your mother loved you-”
The horse shimmered and was replaced by a black and white magpie. Dean flew into the air, not too high above them, and then dive-bombed towards Gabriel. Gabriel yelped and ducked as Dean swooped low and warbled angrily. Castiel observed it all with a smile.
He pushed the order through with just a bit of magic, hoping to get his point across more. Once again, Castiel felt his magic rebound against something and the ferret hissed.
He held out his arms. With more care than he was usually capable of, Gabe put the small pup into Castiel’s arms.
Castiel listened to Dean’s breathing and did his best to match. It took some time, but he eventually got to the stage where he was only hiccoughing on his cries.
Dean stopped at the receptionist desk at the first floor and politely asked the alpha receptionist for directions to Charlie.
"You are not a danger magnet." Castiel said. "It is not your fault that you are powerful. I swear to you, Dean, no matter who comes for you, you will always be able to rely on me to stand with you."
Pasta could be made with broccoli, so Dean would do that before he had to go for his shift. He ruffled both Sam's and Adam's hair, delighting in how they both pulled away and grumbled at him.
The angel was much too careful as he tore the wrapping paper. He frowned at the white box that was revealed, probably curious as to what it would be. He opened the box and moved the additional tissue paper to look at the material inside.
Castiel was very pleased that Dean had agreed to stay with him for a few hours. Dean had been uncharacteristically glum that afternoon and Castiel was itching to ask him about it. Castiel was not good at subtlety, but he tried his best when he worked up the courage to talk to Dean.
"Too late, I have beaten you to it." Castiel said with a huff. He was beginning to get frustrated with Gabriel for not treating the situation seriously.
hopefully this wasn't too ooc or different from how it's been building up. and I kind of struggle with Cas's narrating but I hope that it came across he's feeling very conflicted and trying to do what's best by everyone. Also I didn't read through this so hopefully it makes sense and it's not too much of a garble of words
“That’s what you’re concerned about?” Cas asks, amused. “Not being able to have sex with me if Sam kills me?”
A shrill cry had Castiel jerking and Claire jumping from his lap with a disgruntled meow. Castiel blinked rapidly, his heartbeat racing.
The ferret's tail lowered, though its teeth were still bared. At least he was listening to Castiel. Some of Castiel's magic had to have worked, then, if the ferret was able to understand him.
The boy turned, still holding Castiel’s hand, and waved at the group of students. Castiel could see them rolling their eyes and flipping off the boy. The boy laughed.
"It sounds lovely." Castiel said softly, pressing his hand gently against Dean's. He felt his stomach flutter when Dean's right hand flipped so his palm was next to the back of Castiel's hand.
There was movement underneath Dean's shirt, so Castiel crouched down and moved it away to reveal a tiny harvest mouse.
Dean swallows and gives himself a little shake. He smiles again and waits for the man to say something.
"There is no reason for you to lie about your condition." Castiel tried to keep his tone as gentle and comforting as possible. "I know what Alastair has done and I think-"
They fell into routine easily. Throughout the day, Dean would help Castiel around the garden and shop. While in the shop, Dean would help out and pretend to be an employee. In the afternoons, after Castiel had closed up the shop, he and Dean spent more time relaxing in the garden or in the living room. Dean cooked the two of them every meal. Breakfast usually consisted of eggs and bacon, though lunch and dinner varied. Dean was particularly fond of meat-based meals, which Castiel had no problem with. It was a bit strange to think that he was an elemental witch that ate meat, but he also knew that animals ate other animals - it was nature. Not to say that he had anything against vegetarians or vegans, but he wasn't planning on giving up his burgers anytime soon.
"Understandable." Castiel said. "I'm the same way with tea. I'm absolutely useless until I have a cup."
"We're going to have to walk a ways away." Gabriel said. "You didn't give me an exact address, after all."
It has everything to do with who it was with and nothing with how it was done. Not that their night was bad. Cas is fucking amazing at sex, but still.
Dean blushed at the thought. He’d said “I love you” to Cas several times, but it was still hard for him to get the words out of his mouth. He did love Cas, of course, and Cas knew it too, but it was sometimes too much for Dean to admit something so vulnerable and honest. Castiel, on the other hand, had no problem with telling Dean exactly how much he loved him. Dean felt guilty about it, sometimes, because he could never say it back the same way, even if he wanted to.
They were silent for some time after that. Castiel expected for Dean to fall asleep again, but instead the omega moved about restlessly. It was only when Castiel heard Dean's teeth chattering that he understood. Dean was an angel, and normally the angelic body was able to maintain a homeostatic temperature with ease. But Dean had been severely malnourished for awhile, and his body must have lost this ability in order to conserve energy. Dean was cold. It would likely be months until Castiel started to feel chilled.
"Now you listen to me," Bobby said, voice sharp, "I have no obligation to tell you anything 'bout John 'n Mary. It wasn't my relationship and it's not yours, so it's none of your damn business."
"Well, I'll leave you two to your day." Castiel said, inching away. "I should leave for work soon. Dean, I forgot yesterday, but there's a spare key on the kitchen counter in case you want to take Claire to the park, or something."
“Here.” Castiel offered his hand for Dean to hold and promptly lost his breath when Dean squeezed it with all of his might.
"I trust you, Dean." Castiel replied, holding Dean's gaze. He saw the surprise flicker across Dean's face and felt it flare through the bond. Dean ducked his head.
Dean trembled. “You betrayed me, Cas. You let me believe for months something that was not true. I’m so mad, Cas, so fucking mad, but I can’t stop loving you. I know that you are a good man, an honourable alpha, despite your mistakes, and I can’t help but love you.
The turn around the corner led to another door, which Jo opened and walked through. Castiel went through right after her. He was met with the sight of a tavern. It surprised him for some reason, even though Jo had told him about it. There were four other people in the tavern. Three men at the bar counter and a woman behind it. The woman looked a bit like Jo, except with brown hair.
Castiel pushed himself up and helped Dean to stand. They fell into line, treading obediently forward. Castiel watched Dean carefully from the corner of his eye, noticing how Dean was still shirtless. The bruises and cuts seemed to stand out even more in the sunlight.
Castiel and Dean stared at one another for a moment, rather awkwardly, until Castiel swallowed and turned to start cooking. He was hyper-aware as he got the eggs from the fridge and started up the stove. It wasn't often that he had company, and Castiel didn't think that he had ever made someone breakfast.
"Robert Singer knocked some sense into me." Castiel answered. "Please, don't leave. I don't need you to forgive me, Dean, but I can't let you go. It's too dangerous. Please, for the safety of our child-"
They waited for the next carriage to come down. The current group exited and a ride worker ushered Dean and Castiel into the empty space. Dean sat down, and Cas took a seat next to him. Dean waited, a bit anxious, for the worker to bring in more riders. Surprisingly though, the worker started closing the door to the carriage.
"I apologize." Castiel said. "I just wanted to make sure that you were well, and I didn't understand the magical barrier."
Castiel’s chest twisted. He was conflicted. Mr. Kelly was obviously one of those people who saw alphas alone as the breadwinners and providers. Castiel didn’t agree, but he had a certain behavior expected of him, just as he had had with Amelia.
The beatings did not let up. Like clockwork, the demons would arrive at the same time (according to Castiel's inner clock) and take him to be tortured by Alastair. The demon was creative, Castiel would give him that, and he seemed to be enjoying Castiel's mute protest. He began to question Castiel on basically everything: strategies, tactics, war secrets, and the likes. Castiel remained strong and stone-faced, though. The thought of his fallen comrades, their blood and wings marring the terrain, helped him to keep his strength. Dean, too.
The ferret sneezed. It shook itself off, sending droplets of water flying. Its fur stood up on end, rather cutely.
Dean shifted. “Cas, I know we haven’t talked about it a lot, and I’m sorry if it’s not something you want right now, but I think that this is something I want and-”
"Isn't that interesting?" He said. He gripped his chin thoughtfully. "What's to stop me from just killing Dean if you don't tell me what I want, since you are willing to sacrifice so much for him anyways?"
The demons were quick to pull him back, but not before he was able to land a few powerful blows on Alastair.
“I suppose you can’t.” Castiel said. “It’s a blessing and a curse, I think. On one hand, no one can control how you feel about something, which is good, but sometimes one’s opinions are hurtful towards others.”
a normal day with Cas, and not even because it was the day before his wedding. Castiel had set up a picnic for them in the gardens, which was something they hadn’t done before. There were fruits and sandwiches and tarts and honey cakes and other various treats all carefully placed upon a spread-out blanket.
Dean was very rigid and stiff at first because he was all-too aware of Castiel’s presence. But a few minutes passed without incident and Dean began to relax. He listened to Castiel’s gentle and even breathing and found himself growing sleepier.
Castiel and Dean entered the shop through the back door. Dean instantly went to sit down on the chair pushed into one of the corners of the room while Castiel twitched the 'closed' sign to 'open' on the front door. Surprisingly, there was already someone waiting outside the door. Castiel opened it for the customer.
“I know that.” Dean replied, full of certainty. “He’s likely the best I’ve ever had the honor of knowing.”
Dean groaned again, catching Castiel's attention. Castiel whirled around towards Dean and nearly fell in the process. A hand braced him.
“I have no quarrel with my cousin.” He assured Dean. “He could call me a ‘lying piece of shit’ for all I care, and I would applaud him for swearing.”
"Thank you." Benny replied, though his eyes were focused on Dean. "Dean, you know your wings have changed?"
“Jack.” Gabe said. “When you’re discharged, the others will be excited to see you. They’re worried.”
Claire loved watching the lions as they ate. The meat wasn't recognizable as any type of animal, thankfully, and it wasn't very bloody. They stuck around even after the feeding ended just to watch the lions play. There were just a few females and one male. Claire gave each one of them a name (and Dean conveniently forgot to mention that they already had names).
“It won’t be as bad as the Tower of Terror.” Castiel assured him. He took Dean’s hand, and it practically felt natural by that point.
“Ugh. I hate that movie. You’re not allowed to mention it on my birthday. Besides, our boat isn’t going to sink the way that the Titanic did, because we’re not going to crash it into an iceberg.”
“We’re very happy to have you here tonight.” Mr. Kelly said. “I know it’s difficult for alphas to find time away from work.”
Castiel learned about Dean’s family. Mostly, he talked about his younger brother, Sammy, and how smart and capable Sam was. Sometimes Dean would mention his uncle, aunt, and cousin, and Castiel got the impression Dean and Sam were living with them. Only a few times, when their tutoring session went late because they got caught up talking, did Dean mention his mom.
They played Candyland, and Sam came in last for a third time. After that, Sam claimed he’d forgotten to do work and left to get his laptop, leaving Dean and the kids snickering.
"Straight to the point." The demon said, smirking. "I like you, Squirrel. The catch is that I reserve another favor from you."
He was led out of the dungeon and upstairs. Castiel took advantage of the opportunity to scope out the layout of the building. It was large, very large, and had many doors and hallways. The walls and floor were barren, grey, and smooth, perhaps some sort of concrete or stone. There were no windows and everything looked the same, making it difficult for Castiel to keep track of where they went.
"I focus most of my magic on maintaining my garden and monitoring the weather." Castiel answered with a hum. He turned towards the back door and started for it. "Would you like to come with me?"
"She did." Castiel said, nodding. "I pointed this out to her, along with the fact that Claire has yet to adjust."
It was completely illogical, of course. Even if Castiel managed to break Dean and himself out of here, Castiel would have to return to his garrison and Dean would return to his family. If Dean did not have any family, Castiel would escort him back to the center of heaven, the capital of the angels' territory, and make sure that Dean got settled. But then he and Dean would part ways. Castiel had no time for a mate and family, and Dean would probably desire consistency and support, two things Castiel could not offer.
The demons returned Castiel to his cell without another word. They seemed to be satisfied from his beatings.
"For everything that happened with Alastair and," he hesitated, sounding ashamed, "and with my heat."
"Do you think you will be able to get a babysitter for Claire some of the time?" April asked. "I don't think she would enjoy it when we go wine tasting."
"Do you mean Center Heaven?" Castiel asked. "It is busy and crowded. I do not enjoy it much. As a fledgling, my brother would sometimes take me to the outer rims of heaven. I always enjoyed it more there."
“Great.” Sam replied, smiling. “Then we go clockwise, so it’ll be Jack, Gabe, me, Charlie, and Dean can go last.”
"I shall endeavor not to be one." Castiel replied grimly. The pain in his chest still burned uncomfortably against his skin. "Please start the spell."
Then, for just a moment, the rumpled, hoodie-clad Cas in front of him is replaced by the hazy memory of a different Cas. A Cas with a vacant, bitter grin, wreathed in the musky, heady scent of weed and patchouli and stale sweat. The guy who popped amphetamines like tic-tacs, living high to high, lover to lover.
“Tell them the short version,” Cas murmurs, his eyes never leaving Dean. Jack nods and bounces a little bit on the balls of his feet, practically vibrating with excitement.
Dean’s still grumbling about his pancakes when they head out, and doesn’t stop for the rest of the day, but they actually do manage to get some good information out of the two women they talk to. It’s definitely a ghost; salt n’ burn tonight, and they’ll be on their way home tomorrow.
He wakes sluggishly, like he’s wading through mud, and with each inch he claws his way towards consciousness he collects a new symptom: dry mouth. Nausea. Headache.
“Aw, c’mon,” he says, because he has no sense of self-preservation. “Nobody does it right on the first try. You just gotta practice.”
“Because what?” Sam interrupts, his voice cracking around his exasperation. “Because you won’t even try? I thought you said that was what you wanted to do to honour Cas’ sacrifice.
and he’d been warm and drowsy enough that he’d looked down at Cas, tucked snugly against his side, and just whispered it to him.
He repeats the process, tapping the centre of Cas’ chest when it’s time for him to breathe in. Cas inhales, but doesn’t move away; he stays close, his lips pressed to Dean’s as he holds the smoke in his lungs. He’s stroking his thumb along the outside seam of Dean’s jeans, and Dean. Dean is doing everything in his power to stop himself from crawling into Cas’ lap right here and now.
“Can we go to bed?” he asks, so low and muffled against Cas’ shoulder he’s not sure Cas even heard it.
He grabs a couple blankets and a sleeping bag from his closet, because April nights are still pretty cool and the concrete roof of the Bunker isn’t gonna be very comfortable without a little padding
Sam leans across the table and Dean spares the paper a sideways glance, both of them reading the swirly red script. Dean rolls his eyes. “Nah, man,” he drawls, nudging Cas with his elbow. “People barely even read newspapers anymore. That kind of sentimental shit only goes down in rom-coms.”
Huh. That’s it? Dean didn’t even feel anything weird. Well, that’s good. He turns to Cas to say as much and is taken aback to find Cas blushing up a storm. He’s not looking at Dean.
Now that they’re at the edge of the dance floor, though, and Cas’ hand is leaving Dean’s hip to encircle his wrist and pull him onto it, the reality of dancing is a lot less appealing than the idea. Dean feels exposed, watched, and he— he kinda hates it. He really hates it. This, for him — being seen as a guy who likes other guys — has always been confined to dingy bar bathrooms, the cabs of trucks, shadowed alleyways. Maybe, if he’s very,
What Dean had liked about the sleep aids, in the beginning, was that they didn’t really leave him feeling hungover.
A tiny groan trickles out of his throat as he pushes himself up, looking around warily. Everything feels crisp and pristine, like someone’s gone over the world with a pressure washer. Hell,
But then he feels the press of lips to the side of his head, Cas’ stubble against the shell of his ear; and at that, Dean manages a small smile.
“Alright,” Cas says softly, and his fingers are wound into the sleeve of Dean’s flannel, his knuckles white. “I won’t go.”
Cas closes his eyes for a moment, his hands dangling in his lap. “I don’t— Dean. Is it broken?” He shrugs, small and helpless. “I think this might be the only way.”
“No can do,” he says airily, tossing the coat and then the suit jacket aside before loosening Cas’ tie and starting to roll up the sleeves of his dress shirt. “I kinda need a vessel out here, guys, and I don’t see either of you offering. Unless…?” He adds hopefully, turning a hungry gaze on Sam. Dean
is his sign. Here he is, being told by the man he trusts most that he has lost sight of the path. Perhaps this is God’s way of making his will known: sending the erstwhile Righteous Man to speak to Cas on His behalf. This would not be the most mysterious way He has spread His word.
And just like that, all the little pieces Sam’s picked up over the past six months slot together, coalesce into an instantly recognizable whole. He can see what they add up to. He knows.
Then after the walk they separate, do their own thing. Dean puts on music, or pulls a paperback off the bookshelf, or watches Netflix. Sam… Dean doesn’t know what Sam does. He doesn’t really care. Most days someone’ll come by: Eileen or Charlie, usually, and that’s fine. Eileen wipes the floor with him at cards, and Charlie brings Miracle and her Nintendo.
Dean laughs, a little shakily. Holy shit. Holy— he’s gonna suggest this. He’s actually gonna suggest this. Shit. “Nah, it’s… you don’t have to take a drag. It’s called, uh. Shotgunning.”
“No,” Cas says, all bitchy and uncompromising. “If you sleep on the couch you’ll be a nightmare tomorrow. You won’t sleep well and your back will hurt.”
good, but his patience only extends so far, and talking about Valentine’s Day definitely shortens that marker by a long shot. As far as Dean’s concerned, the only good thing about it is the plethora of hopeful women that haunt the bars. That, and the discount chocolate afterwards.
Sam shrugs. “Well, I was thinking the other day, we could… we could have a little ceremony or something. Get Claire and the girls involved. It might be good for them. For us.”
Maybe... maybe something’s finally changing. Maybe Dean’s slowly coming towards some kind of revelation.
Dean, no matter how hard you try to convince me otherwise. That shit you pulled back there? ‘Just let me die, it’s my time’? You were trying to tell me why it was okay to let you go while I was on the phone with the fucking ambulance.” Dean opens his mouth, but Sam just keeps talking over him. “And I’ve been thinking back over that fight. A lot, actually. The thing is, I don’t know how this could’ve happened unless you
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas says back. His voice is soft and low, and it sends a minute shiver skittering down Dean’s spine.
Point is, waking up screaming for his dead best friend probably isn’t gonna do him any favours with the staff. And if Sam finds out then there’s
Sam’s sitting at one of the tables, his almost-empty beer from dinner next to him as he reads a newspaper.
Dean thinks he might be as surprised as Michael looks; he hadn’t meant to let that slip out, and the shame of it is already crowding up inside his chest. “Please,” he croaks again anyways. “I can’t… I need him. At least tell me you’ll give him a chance.”
Cas presses the button again and shows Dean the bear. “It sings Whitney Houston.” He pauses, then adds, “And it’s soft.”
But he was stupid. He doesn’t know what the hell came over him earlier, but he drank just enough that it’s making him sleepy. Like he said.
Rain patters gently against the window, and a figure comes up next to Dean. A hand reaches for the coffee pot. Dean zeroes his attention back in on the pancakes and flips the rest of them with robotic precision.
So, they go for walks. It’s pathetic, the first couple days: Dean only gets about fifteen feet from the cabin. He hates this, hates that his body is betraying him. Sam just silently turns him around and helps him back inside.
“It’s an honour,” Cas says quietly, looking at Dean. Dean looks at him, then back at Magda. He sighs.
bad Hell memories. The awful smell that had filled his nose as he ran from their burning house, cuddling his baby brother close.
He also looks like he’s trying to pretend he’s not feeling every single positive emotion there is as he regards Sam and Dean. (Mostly Dean.)
The outlines of Jack’s body are starting to vibrate with a frenetic glow, and a low, uncomfortable hum that’s slowly climbing in register and intensity is rumbling through Dean’s marrow. “Jack?” Dean tries again, raising his voice. “Jack, c’mon, you’ve gotta snap out of it. I know you’re in there, kid, you’ve got this.”
And then there are the bad days. The ones where Cas wakes up alone, to cold sheets, if he ended up in Dean’s room at all in the first place. Or the ones where Dean goes stiff and wooden under Cas’ hands, paralyzed by his touch for no identifiable reason. Or the ones where he stumbles away from Cas, apologies and explanations he won’t be able to say swelling in his mouth, choking him into silence.
As he slowly starts to answer Cas’ question, Sam files the odd reaction away in the same mental folder as the teddy bear debacle, and he wonders.
tearfully ask if he’s okay, but that’s just because he’s Garth. Not because he thinks Dean has a deathwish.
“Sugar,” Cas confirms, and it’s almost a challenge, the way he says it. “You only drink black coffee because it’s convenient for other people. And possibly because it’s one of the things you think you are expected to do.”
Dean. But there was… it wasn’t sudden, this time. You guys must’ve talked, right? Before it happened. C’mon. I know there’s more you didn’t tell us.”
and Dean is— Dean is flying up the steps two at a time, shaking, vibrating out of his skin, because Cas is hurt but he’s
it, and it drives Dean crazy. Why won’t he fight? Why won’t he demand an explanation? It doesn’t make any damn sense.
Dean snorts. “Uh, yeah. But they’re hilarious, so. Consider it a reminder of the evils of our society or somethin’. Enjoy.”
There’s something hunted and on-edge about his expression, and Dean’s stomach flops sickeningly. He’s got a bad feeling that it’s his fault Cas looks like that.
I’d be happy to let you work it out. You’re distracted, big boy, and we can’t have that. Gotta have your eyes on the prize.”
stirs and rolls over, scrubbing a hand over his eyes. He freezes when he sees who it is in the doorway.
Unfortunately, though, his second hit doesn’t go any better than his first. His expression looks properly sour, now, and Dean’s almost afraid he’ll beg off and go back inside, so he puts a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Hey, you good?”
Castiel felt Dean shrug as he answered. “Uh, I’m tired, but besides that I’m fine. What the hell happened?”
!” Gabe crowed. “What? A goodnight kiss? Did you hold hands while taking your kids trick-or-treating? What was it?!”
Castiel took his bags and practically jogged up to Gabe's house. Claire was there to open the door when he knocked, and she flung herself at him.
The demon guards returned a few hours later. Castiel stood and readied himself, only to be surprised when they opened Dean's cell instead.
By the end of the week, Castiel felt hollow and depressed, which only fueled his guilt, of course. Why couldn’t he be just a little happy to have Jack with him? He really did not want to go to the weekly family lunch that Ellen hosted, but if he didn’t go she would tear him a new one. Plus, he knew the others would want some Jack time.
Castiel went straight into Dean's cell and wrapped his arms and wings around the omega. Dean cried out and arched into him. His face was flushed and his eyes were glaze, only adding the rocky pit in Castiel's stomach.
At least Gabriel was happy. His shop had done so well that he'd opened two more locations, each about an hour away from the original. They were named the Darn Delicious Desserts, but only so Gabriel could tell adults that it was actually named the Damn Delicious Desserts. Castiel did not think it particularly clever, but Gabriel did enjoy cussing, so it suited him.
heavier and bigger than it should have been. Castiel went toppling to the ground and grunted. A large weight landed on his chest, knocking the wind out of him.
"I don't need you to protect me!" Dean screamed suddenly and with such ferocity that Castiel flinched and stepped back. Dean stayed sitting in his corner.
He wanted to save Dean. He wanted to hold the omega next to him and cradle his face and heal him of his wounds, inside and out.
At first, Dean does this because he finds the guy so odd and is curious about him. As time goes on, however, Dean begins to realize he’s not just doing this to learn more about Cas’s weirdness, he’s also doing this because he’s actually interested in Cas’s life and what he has to say.
"Yes, I am," Castiel said, the pieces falling into place, "I believe you know my friend. His name is Dean Winchester. His parents' names were Mary and John. Does that ring a bell?"
"Hello, Gabriel." Castiel forced out. He did not move away from Dean, still standing protectively in front of the pregnant omega.
“That doesn’t mean anything.” Dean growled. “There could still be some monster waiting for you guys to lower your guards.”
Castiel obediently brought his baby up to his neck. He felt more than heard the little snuffles the baby made before he cooed. Castiel lowered his arms again and met his pup’s inquisitive gaze.
There was something more, too, something almost familiar. Dean's face was white and his eyes were wide when Castiel met his gaze. He obviously recognized something, too.
A little before lunch, Castiel sat down in a bare patch of grass and watched Dean wander around. It was insanely cute to see a guinea pig nibbling at grass stems and flower petals. Dean paused, mid-bite, to watch a butterfly float by. Then, his little mouth went back to chomping.
themselves with one another before going back to sleep. They woke in the morning to the smell of eggs and bacon, curtesy of Gabriel.
Castiel carefully picked Claire up from his lap and put her back down on the couch. She meowed in protest but Castiel stood before she could try to climb back onto him. He took a second to stretch out his limbs, then he crossed over to the door and opened it.
Castiel stood and picked up the baby seat. He moved to the nursery and tried his best to ignore all the little things that Dean had thought to add. Jack was already getting sleepy, so Castiel gently moved him from the seat and to the crib. Jack blinked tiredy up at him.
“He can be all of these things, Cas, but to me he will always be the man that bought me and took me from my home. He is to be my Master first and my Husband second. Perhaps he will be kind and good to me, but I will forever remember that he is the reason I was separated from my family and why I am now alone.”
“Fine.” Castiel sighed. “But you have to promise me that you won’t make me get into the water. I’m serious, Balth.”
Dean had been ready to go back home as soon as he heard the news, but now he was feeling sort of attached. It was weird and pretty freaky what was happening to him, and Dean seriously missed his past body (which he was beginning to think would never return).
Would Dean even want to leave Earth now that he was reunited with his family? Surely he would help Castiel end the war, right?
The police come and take his prints. Dean is sent to a therapist and a psychologist and a doctor. He goes door to door, asking if anyone recognizes him.
Castiel dropped Dean’s hand when they entered the kitchen. He went around taking items out to prepare a meal. Dean watched, still stunned into silence. He barely registered that Castiel was talking.
"Believe what you want." Bobby said. "None of us are going to keep you from running back to Heaven, but we will fight tooth and nail to keep Dean safe. His baby too. Never forget that."
Castiel took a moment to ponder why he cared about the scent bond at all. He wasn't often attracted to other angels, and he couldn't figure out why he would be attracted to Dean now. In the end, Castiel decided it was their mutual situation that made Castiel so clingy.
Over the next few days, Castiel realized that Dean was not deteriorating at a slower rate. He just hadn't realized what was happening. Dean was getting physically sick. He'd gone past the point of weakened to ill. His skin felt hot and clammy against Castiel's when the cuddled. It concerned Castiel, greatly.
It was nice to be with everyone again under good conditions. Castiel had faithfully attended the get-togethers his family had had while Dean was unconscious, but none of them felt right.
“Gabe feeds the dog too many treats and he thinks I’m crazy for wanting to take the dog jogging with me.”
“Yeah.” Sam answers. “He’s your best friend. Well, he was. I’m not sure he’ll still be that when he tells you the truth.”
Dean cringed at the title. He didn’t stop Castiel as the guard left, despite the gnawing loneliness that began to make itself known.
"Shit, I'm so sorry. I'm such a fucking idiot. I misread the situation, dammit, I'm so fucking sorry, man." Dean cheeks were flushed and his eyes were wide and panicked. He turned away and crossed his arms, practically curling into himself. Castiel could only stare blankly as Dean continued to ramble, "I'm really sorry, Cas. Fuck. We can just pretend this never happened, right?"
“Of course not.” Cas scoffed. “I’d be flattered. I find it flattering to be the object of someone’s attention, don’t you, Dean?”
Claire pouted but nodded her head. Adam stood and took Dean’s offered hand. Dean went back to the front of the room and sat down with Adam beside him. The alpha and his son were seated across from Dean and Adam.
“I seem to have forgotten myself.” Castiel said, sounding embarrassed, “I should leave before I make a bigger fool of myself. My greatest apologies, Your Highness.”
“Mr. Walker!” Lisa snapped, her scent flaring with indignation. “That type of language is not allowed on school premises!”
“Okay.” She said, head ducking. “I love you guys, too. Dad, I’m sorry for what I said. It’s not true. You have always been my dad.”
Castiel backed up and summoned all the magic within himself, pulling heavily from Dean's reserves. Dean was running low, too. This would have to be enough.
Castiel glanced over his shoulder and found that Dean looked every bit uncertain and curious as Gabriel felt.
speeding laws as he drove Dean to the hospital, which was saying a lot because he hated speeding. They were lucky that no cops pulled them over, though Castiel had  reasoned they could make it off with a warning since Dean was literally in labor.
Castiel let out a frustrated noise. He should go after Dean and stop him. He could help how hurt he felt. But before Castiel could make it out the door, Bobby was entering the storage room and blocking the doorway.
Charlie was excellent at reading him, because she said, “Don’t you dare feel guilty about that, Dean Winchester. He’s had this coming a long time.”
"C'mon." Dean started off towards the town. Sam and Gabriel followed after, a little slower, and Castiel took up the back. He wanted to keep an eye on Gabriel and Sam. He did believe them, mostly, but a little suspicion would not hurt, hopefully.
"It is no problem." Castiel answered. "It's clear you care for your family immensely, and Claire could benefit from a friend her own age."
Castiel felt a horrible lurch and the world went dark around him. He had no choice but to follow the pull that was summoning him somewhere far, far away.
They fell silent then. Castiel's mind churned with new insight as he tried to determine what Alastair would gain from knowing that Dean was potentially a Nephilim. Could Dean be turned? Tortured enough to break and join leagues with the demons?
“Nah, we’ll crash here tonight.” Gabe said. “Maybe even make you breakfast before we do the walk of shame.”
"They're never taking me back there." Dean said with such a certainty that Castiel grew worried. What measures would Dean resort to in order to stay free from the demons' grasps? Likely Dean would give his life up to prevent that. Castiel did not want to see this happen.
It was becoming even more obvious that it was be extremely difficult, maybe impossible, for both Dean and Castiel to get out. Even if Castiel managed to overpower the demon guards that came for him, he would still have to find the key to Dean's cell (Castiel was almost certain that they did not carry Dean's key at the same time as they carried Castiel's, and probably because they suspected something could happen and that one of them would not abandon the other). If Castiel managed to find Dean's key, return back to the dungeons without being spotted, and unlock Dean's cell, they would still have to slip out unnoticed, and by now it was unlikely that Castiel could fly them. His wings were too neglected, and he didn't have the ability to care for them properly while he was alone. Dean could not reach between the bars and get a good grip.
"Yeah, yeah." Ellen rolled her eyes and slapped Dean's shoulder. "What are you two going to do now?"
just a small note - in the first chapter Dean says his full name but I edited that so it's only his first name
Castiel shifted his wings and tried to move into a more comfortable position that relieved his pain.
Castiel was also introduced to Dean’s uncle, Bobby, who was probably one of the most intimidating people that Castiel had ever met. Bobby turned out to be really kind, even if he had a gruff exterior.
Summary: Dean's trying to have a nice chat with his brother between Sam's classes, but there is a cute guy at the coffee shop that Dean finds very distracting.
"Whatever you think, Dean, I want to be there for you and our child. There is no family I'd rather have than this one."
Dean shifted back when he finished with his strawberries. His mouth was still red (much redder than Castiel would expect from a few berries).
It all was strange and it did not sit well with Castiel. He could not imagine why an angel couple would ever move to earth to raise their fledglings. It was absolutely reckless and dangerous. Most angels abhorred earth.
Castiel gasped again and cradled Dean's face with his spare hand, eyes roaming over Dean's lax face. His familiar's freckles stood out starkly against his pale skin.
"You're kind of an idiot, you know?" Dean said. Castiel blinked, unsure if that was a good thing or a bad thing.
Dean was surprised to receive a text from Charlie the next evening that said she had given his information to her boss who was looking for a permanent nanny, and that he was interested despite Dean's secondary gender and lack of higher education. Dean tried not to get his hopes up too much. There was always a chance that Charlie's boss just wouldn't hire him.
The hidden hallway was dark and damp. The only light came from torches the demons held. It smelled foul in the , and Castiel's nose wrinkled. The hallway was also narrow, so his wings were squished against him and brushed uncomfortably against the wall. Dean walked in front of Castiel. Because of the short chain connecting them, Castiel walked extremely close to Dean, so close he nearly leaned against Dean's wings.
It never really occurred to Castiel that Dean might have a pup. He didn't know Dean's age, but he seemed young. Apparently he was still old enough to have a six-year-old pup.
"She hasn't been adjusting well since Amelia left." Castiel admitted, head dropping in embarrassment. "She acts out and the nannies quit."
Now that Castiel thought about it, demons did die a lot in heaven, but he and the other angels had always related that to the injuries they sustained during their captivity.
Dean felt like he should bundle her up and hug all the sadness away, but instead he just kept driving. He hoped that Mr. Novak had a good reason for missing out on the zoo.
Half past five, Castiel heard the familiar purr of the Impala and saw the headlights flash in the window.
Dean's wings quivered as he nodded. He reached a trembling hand into his wings and tugged. Castiel felt his eyes widen as Dean cried out, a tawny feather held tightly between his fingers. Alastair's eyes lit up and he let out a cackle. He held out a hand, and Dean reached out and gave him the feather.
so was that too dramatic ? I took some liberties with how magic and witches and familiars work but... my fic my rules
He was quiet throughout the ride, despite Balthazar's attempts to start a conversation. Eventually Balthazar seemed to realize that Castiel was having a rough morning, and he gave up.
“Thanks for that, Dr. Winchester.” He drawls, instinctively falling back on his sarcasm. He thinks that Sam knows that Dean is taking what he said to heart, though, but Sam doesn’t make a bitchface or anything.
Dean started to panic a little. What if Cas didn’t really want to have a baby with Dean? What if he’d changed his mind about wanting a child. What if he left Dean? What was Dean supposed to do-
appreciate seeing a mother mallard and her ducklings. Dean’s class had been by the gardens that morning and so he had decided to eat his (very manly) lunch out by the pond. Unfortunately, the residing ducks seemed to think that Dean’s presence and food made it okay for them to start begging or swimming near him, which had led to a mom-duck and all of her ducklings.
"We've been through a lot together." Castiel tried to explain, though he found that he could not meet Jo's eyes. "It's possible we have scent-bonded. We are not mates, though, and we have no intention to be."
Dean slipped into the bathroom and took an, admittedly, long shower. The water pressure was fucking amazing and the water stayed hot the whole time. Whoever had paid for this awesome house could pay for that too.
I want you gone! When I get back, you’d better be the fuck out of this fucking city! I know you think you can push me around because I’m an omega. You’re wrong. If you don’t leave, I’ll kick you out myself. If you keep coming around, after I’ve kicked your ass, I’ll let Bobby know. You’d better get the fuck out right now!”
Castiel turned and walked away. He told himself he wasn’t fleeing, but he was. He needed some space between himself and April.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and forced back a tired sighed. He leaned back in his chair and reached a hand up to pinch the bridge of his nose.
It felt so, so good to have Dean back in his arms. He brushed his lips against Dean’s shoulder. Dean ran his fingers across Castiel’s arms.
"Oh." Dean looked back to Gabriel, who smiled smugly. "Er, okay, I guess. Just let me get my clothes on."
. He jogged after Cas, completely forgetting Baby’s open doors, and grabbed Cas by his shoulder so he could spin him around.
It was weird to think about how cleaning helped Dean to calm. While Dean was a teenager, cleaning up was the last thing he wanted to do,
"Let's go!" Another woman yelled. The humans urged their horses into a gallop and then they were off.
He threw a fry as an example and then Claire threw her own. Claire’s fry landed much closer to the shore and farther from the ducks than Dean’s, but the ducks just swam nearer to nibble at their treats. Claire giggled.
Castiel fell silent and stilled, his mind turning over Alastair's poisonous words. He clenched his jaw and glanced back up at Alastair. He wouldn't let the demon manipulate him like this any longer.
Dean laughed outright then, catching the young girl’s attention. She looked at him with a wide and gummy grin.
“I have high hopes for my daylilies.” Castiel was saying. “They should, hopefully, do well in this region, and their flowers are rather beautiful. I’ve also started planting up some marigolds and catmint.”
Gabriel was the first to leave, saying that he was starving. Sam picked up Jess's clothing and the two of them also went inside.
“No!” Charlie screeched, and Dean jumped (though he wouldn’t admit it). Charlie’s head whipped up to glare at Jack. “How do you do that?”
"It's true." Jo said defensively. "They're always mocking and taunting us. They don't steal our crap or attack us like the demons do, though."
He glanced at Castiel and his next words caught in his throat. The alpha was bright red and his eyes were wide. It only took Dean a quick second of observation to recognize that the alpha’s pupils were dilated.
Castiel blinked furiously. He snatched up the container and turned it around to the back. Sure enough, step-by-step directions were written out in large, clean font.
Some of you guess Dean’s predicament, so good job lol poor Dean bean and I love protective and caring Cas
Dean’s heart skipped a bit as a jolt of anxiety rushed through him. His eyes popped open and he took in a sharp breath.
“Dean will love it.” Ellen assured him. “After all, you’ve got me cooking up his favorite meal: burgers and pie.”
Castiel blinked and titled his head. "What sickness?" Dean looked up at him, his expression surprised.
"Of course." Castiel readied himself. Then, he leaned forward and allowed them to drop from the window.
"Don't be stingy." Alastair said chidingly. Castiel watched, shocked, as Dean continued to pull out three more of his feathers and give them to Alastair.
After their bond had been restored, they both took a well-deserved nap while Gabriel got rid of Michael's body. Castiel did not want to think about burying it or hiding it, so he was grateful for Gabriel's help.
It’s strange for Dean to realize that, even with everything that went on, he doesn’t feel like Cas took advantage of him at all. Dean did make the first move and Cas was very hesitant. Maybe he still shouldn’t have slept with Dean, but that’s hardly something Dean can hold against him.
"Not a fan of talking, hmm?" Alastair tsked. "Don't worry, that'll change." He nodded and the demon guards dragged Castiel forward. Alastair stood and stepped away from his throne. He moved so he stood in front of Castiel. Alastair took Castiel's chin in his hand and squeezed. Castiel spit at him.
"I don't understand." Castiel gritted out, frustration seeping into him. What was Dean trying to say?
“Nothin’,” Dean said. “Just surprised, I guess. You’re smart and funny and pretty hot. Would’ve thought you’d have someone wrapped around your finger by now.”
"Winchester." Castiel mused. He hadn't heard of any angels by the name of Winchester, so it likely wasn't a commander of some sort that set up base on earth. "What about your omega- or beta-parent's name?"
"Please, take a seat." Castiel waved to the chair in front of his desk. Naomi sauntered over and sat down, holding herself in a sort of delicate, ladylike posture that Castiel knew was an act. Naomi was an aggressive alpha, certainly not one who would be considered traditionally ladylike.
A small flare of hope tugged at Castiel's chest. The angels had come for him. They'd failed, ultimately, but they had tried.
Any other day, Dean would duck his head and escape to his bedroom, or he would leave the apartment entirely.
So, Dean loaded the cart with lots of lettuce and carrots and other healthy crap, along with a pie and some beef. He wanted to make burgers later, and a little pie never hurt anyone. Dean looked a bit longingly at the beer, but he didn't buy any. He didn't like having alcohol around Adam.
“I hate that you tricked me into becoming your friend.” Dean continued. His eyes burned with tears that started to slip down his cheeks. “I hate that you tricked me into loving you, and I hate myself for still loving you.”
"How kind of him." Castiel said, his mind beginning to connect the dots. "Happy birthday. How old are you?"
"Besides that!" Dean interrupted with an exasperated huff, and Castiel could not help but grin. He knew Dean was not truly upset and for some reason it amused Castiel to see Dean all riled up.
“I suppose that I’m thankful to be having this opportunity to spend time with you all. It’s been very refreshing to be here and not have to worry about anything supernatural. I’m grateful that I have been able to learn more about myself, as well.” Castiel said, tone soft and warm. He was such a sap.
Dean's reserve poured into Castiel, soothing his aches and refueling his magic. He forced his wards to stay strong.
“They’re hopeful. Right now, his body just might be too exhausted for him to wake. It’s only been a couple of hours. He could wake up this evening.”
"You're my savior." Dean breathed as he relaxed into Castiel's side and warmth. Castiel tightened his wing's grip on Dean. "Even if we never get out, you saved me in that dungeon."
Dean breathed in deeply, then let it out slowly. “I just don’t know. I don’t want him to act weirdly around me.”
Castiel shifted on the bed, trying not to rush Gabriel into giving him the information he quite possibly needed to save Dean.
Castiel glanced back at his garden. "I just want to use a small growth spell on these flowers, if you wouldn't mind."
Castiel said nothing, making Dean sigh and roll his eyes. “Watch some fucking movies, Cas, jeez. Where are we?"
Castiel tried to get Dean to drink some of his water, but Dean denied it and drank only his own. His fever would break for a couple of hours, then return even worse than it had been before. Dean curled up in the corner of his cell during those times and wrapped his arms tightly around his stomach, sometimes softly whimpering. His wings pushed against the bars, seemingly without Dean's conscious decision, desperately begging for contact and comfort.
Castiel waited with Claire at the table until their nails dried, then he went up and paid. Claire held his hand as they walked back to the car. The polish on his nails felt odd and smooth. Claire kept staring at her own.
In the nights, when the temperatures dropped drastically, they would huddle together in the corners of the cell, pressed together as much as the bars allowed. Their outer wings would come to encase them. It was during these times that Castiel was the most relaxed. He didn't sleep, his natural angelic grace still kept him in relatively good health, for now. Instead, Castiel would listen to Dean's quiet breathing and he would focus on the slow thumping of Dean's heart. It lured him into a trance-like state, and Castiel's instincts screamed at him to wrap the omega up in his wings and fly Dean far away. Castiel longed to build a nest and line it with his feathers, to bring Dean food and shiny things.
Castiel’s confidence shook a little when Dean’s friends, Benny Lafitte and Charlie Bradbury, looked up at him. Dean’s back was turned to him.
"By all means." Castiel said, waving his hand. He was a bit surprised by the offer, but Dean looked completely genuine. Claire led him to the bathroom so that Dean could do her hair. Castiel watched from the bathroom doorway as Dean expertly brushed out the tangles and pulled Claire's hair into pigtails.
Dean woke the following morning absolutely sweltering. He could feel Castiel pressed up against him. Cas’s arm was thrown over Dean’s waist, rather possessively. Dean didn’t want to disturb Cas, but he needed to check his phone. He was lucky enough that his jeans had ended up on the nightstand. Dean just had to reach over with one arm and fish his phone out of his pocket.
Dean lingered in the doorway a moment longer before continuing. “Well, Castiel, I think it’s time I retire. Thank you, again, for today.”
He should never have slept with Dean. There would be no way for him to keep professional without being awkward and obvious.
Michael's eyes started to glow with the power inside of him, which, to Castiel, was utterly terrifying.
Dean looked up and met Cas’s eyes. Cas’s expression was full of concern, and he brought his hand down to his side.
At the very bottom of the bag lay a bee stuffed animal. Castiel picked it up to inspect it. It wasn’t very big, maybe half a foot long and wide, but it was incredibly soft. It had two antennae that popped out of its head and bounced around when Castiel moved it. There were wings, too, that Castiel could flap around.
It made Dean a little guilty and sad to see the tension on Sam's face and disappointment in Adam's expression. He hated having to leave Sam to watch Adam. He enjoyed spending time with them, and he knew that Sam was busy with schoolwork and that he shouldn't have to watch over a pup, but there wasn't much that Dean could do about that. He already asked Bobby and Ellen to watch them far more than he wanted to. They never said anything about it, of course, but it wasn't their responsibility. Plus, they were already helping plenty with school supplies and the occasional grocery fund.
Cas’s eyes darken. “I believe you said we could come back to the idea of me bending you over the arm of a couch.”
John’s lip curled. Before he could say anything cruel, the baby monitor burst to life with Jack’s cries.
“I’m fortunate my brother was available to watch over Claire this weekend.” Castiel said. That was neutral, right?
Castiel opened his eyes, wincing against the light, and blinked several times. He moved his head in search of the source of the noise.
Castiel’s mind was fuzzy as he tried to open his eyes. He had been just about ready to start making the flower crowns for the bees.
Castiel hurried up and around to Dean’s side of the bed. He helped his mate stand and put on a pair of sweatpants, as well as a shirt.
Adam glowered at him until Dean rolled his eyes and picked him up. He could think about Mr. Novak later. Adam was much more important.
He could feel Dean through their bond again, though far closer than he could before. He reached out with his magic and grasped onto Dean just to be sure. Dean tightened his physical hold on Castiel in return.
Castiel walked Ellen to her car, flushing more when she called him a proper gentleman, and watched her leave.
"Okay, Mr. De!" Claire skipped away. Dean turned back to what Claire had been stirring and covered the top with plastic top.
Castiel gave up some ten minutes later and decided it looked fine. She was only four, after all. No one would notice or care.
Gritting his teeth, Castiel took off after the demon. He only prayed that he was able to catch up to the demon before it reached Dean. Dean must've been running the entire time for him to get so far away from Castiel.
Castiel frowned and squinted his eyes, trying to think of what they would possible find entertaining about him.
Jack was perfect, and he looked so much like Dean that it made Castiel’s heart ache. After the first adjustment when bringing him home, Jack was an easy baby. He didn’t cry much outside of when he needed something, and even then his wails never reached the shrill tone they’d had at the beginning. He was always staring at everything with wide eyes.
after presenting as an omega. He hated how often his dad left the work to Dean because of Dean’s designation.
“Fuck.” Dean said, shrinking into Castiel’s side without really meaning to. He froze when Cas slipped his arm around Dean’s waist.
Dean was suddenly hyper aware of Cas’s presence. He focused on the gravel of his voice, the way he bit his lip as he worked on making food, how his muscles flexed as he moved.
The funniest one was Cas, though, because his expression was completely blank and he was staring straight at the camera while Sam and Jack were looking down the drop.
He took his time eating the cupcake. He didn’t care for cupcakes much, but it was Ellen’s homemade red velvet with cream cheese frosting, so he made sure to savour every bite.
They moved silently throughout the forest. Alastair seemed uncomfortable, almost like he was nervous, which prickled Castiel's curiosity.
The following day, Castiel found himself bouncing his legs anxiously throughout math class. He knew Dean was sitting at the back of the room. He knew he should go talk to him.
Dean did not give the kids pie after dinner because he wanted to ask Castiel about it first. He didn’t want to give pie to Adam if Claire couldn’t have any. Dean sent a quick text to Cas, then put his phone down and set up Chutes and Ladders on the kitchen table. Sam had finished his work, so the kids convinced him to join in on their game.
Castiel didn’t want to try. If something ever happened to Dean, he wanted to carry on the way he had been while Dean was unconscious. He
It wasn't the most poetic of compliments by far, but to Castiel it was the best he had ever received. This was because Dean's compliment was accompanied with soft adoration at Dean's side of the bond. It made him feel strangely flustered and giddy. His stomach fluttered in a way that made Castiel want to duck his head and blush.
“Of course I knew!” Sam looked at Jack. “I’ve given Cas a hand over the past month. He’s so perfect, Dean.”
Just a little clarification: for the most part, familiars with multiple forms can control which one they become, but at times of high stress they have less control - for example, if a familiar could become both an eagle and a mouse they are more likely to become a mouse when they are frightened if they have the flight instinct (instead of fight or freeze), more powerful or experienced familiars have more control over what form they become when stressed but it can take a lot of practice. Additionally, a familiar with multiple forms can simply shift without choosing a form and can just allow their emotions to pick the form for them
Ellen eyed him. “You know if you needed to stay here for a while, Bobby ‘n I would be happy to have you. No one would think any less of you. Bobby and I could split time watching him, and I’m sure the others wouldn’t mind pitching in. It might give you more time to yourself. You’ve been through a traumatic event, you still need to process it.”
Ellen nodded, grim. "Figured as much. I'd say congratulations, Dean, but I'm not sure you feel the same."
If anyone ever wants to chat - my Tumblr is tale-to-tell (pretty much the same thing except hyphens and not underdashes)
“Mr. Walker!” Lisa said again. “If you cannot control your behavior, you will be required to leave.”
The doctor did arrive a few minutes later, and she promptly told Castiel and Dean that Dean’s labor could last a few more hours, much to their dismay.
"I'd thank you not to threaten me in my own home." Castiel said calmly. The man snarled, his hair puffing ever so slightly.
He ignored Gabriel's complaints and mumbles and instead focused on Dean and Jess. It was fun to watch two adorable creatures chasing one another. One would be chasing the other, then suddenly it would switch. There was no rhyme or reason that Castiel could discern, but the two familiars seemed to be in sink. They continued to play until Bobby came to tell them that their burgers were ready.
“The man that you are,” Cas continues, “You don’t like that man. You’ve made choices in the past that you’re not proud of and you’re constantly haunted by trauma. I think, and I always will think, that you’re the most beautiful thing to ever exist. It hurts that you don’t see yourself in that way too.
He stayed silent as their carriage came to the top and then started making its descent. Dean was unable to calm the twisting, butterfly feelings in his stomach.
"I've never really found a limit." Dean explained. "Whatever animal I've tried to be, I can become it."
Castiel came across an empty clearing and the demon's scent died out suddenly. Castiel whirled around, absolutely frustrated, until he caught eyes on tawny wings.
"Pretty sure I only survived because I hated the witch and the stupid bond from the start." Dean said. "As soon as I could walk, I took off. That's how I ended up here."
"I took Claire to get her nails done and she insisted I join in." Castiel explained, a bit sheepish.
Castiel’s mouth snapped shut. He gave a hesitant nod and then carefully got onto the bed next to Dean. There weren’t nearly as many wires and tubes as before, so it wasn’t too hard to shimmy into a comfortable position next to Dean.
Dean cleaned up after all of them and went to bed, but he found that he couldn't quite fall asleep. Now that he was no longer distracted, he could only think about how sad Claire had been and how hurt she must be feeling. Dean almost wished he could go back to comfort her, but it wasn't really his place to question Mr. Novak's methods of parenting. He'll, Dean was far from perfect. Every parent made mistake, it just hurt Dean to see it happen, especially with such a sweet girl.
"Understandable." Castiel said. "I'm the same way with tea. I'm absolutely useless until I have a cup."
“But it’s more than that, though.” Dean said. “We’ve been talking a lot. I think that he tells me things that he doesn’t tell other people. We’re friends. Once you sleep with your friend, you ruin everything. Either you get into a relationship, or your friendship slowly wanes into nothing due to mutual awkwardness.”
"I'm going to read some books, see if there's anything I can find to help the Dean situation. I don't think there's healing spells that would help with magic depletion and broken bonds, and if there are they're probably temporary and dangerous, but I'll look into it. You take it easy and let me know if anything changes, okay?"
"No." He said. His shirt had long since been used to stop the bleedings, but Castiel was not about to ask Dean for anything. Besides, Dean no longer had his shirt. Castiel used his bloodied shirt to stop the bleeding.
It was admittedly entertaining to watch the ducklings as they swam in tight circles around their mother and pumped their webbed feet to catch up with her when she swam around. They zoomed about the pond, oblivious to Dean’s attention. Sometimes the mother would duck her head under the water and then pull back out and shake off droplets. Then the ducklings would try to mimic her behavior. The mother would swim around and call to her children when they wandered a little too far.
Dean had calmed down a lot from Matterhorn Mountain, but he was beginning to get nervous again. The rollercoasters weren’t nearly as bad as a plane, but it still put knots in Dean’s stomach.
Castiel reached for Dean's neck, his fingers trembling as he pressed them against Dean's pulse point.
Dean hiked his legs up and around Castiel's waist, drawing him closer so they rubbed against another in the best way.
“Sweetheart,” Dean took a step towards her, “look, I know that you’re upset. It’s perfectly fine to be upset. But you can’t go taking it out on your dad like that. It’s not fair to him or you. Maybe if we just take some deep breaths-”
Castiel sighed and shut the fridge. He wandered around the house restlessly for a few moments before he collapsed onto the couch. Claire jumped up right away and meowed at him.
“You’re a fucking riot!” Balthazar exclaimed, laughing up a storm. Castiel shot a look at him and saw that he was doubling over with the force of his laughs.
They were lucky that they did not come into any conflict as they returned to the town. Castiel recognized the demonic scent that he'd followed the first time as Sam's. It settled his nerves to know that there wasn't another demon scouting about.
"I am thirty." Castiel said. "I am sorry you've been kept here so long. What do they want from you?"
Castiel was led to Alastair's torture chambers, where the lead demon was waiting. He smiled maliciously at Castiel when the angel was brought in.
Also I do not blame Gabriel or mean for him to come off as a bad person - I believe that it's okay to love someone from afar, especially if they have problems that are starting to take a toll on your own mental / physical health, but obviously it would be rough for Castiel too
"I didn't mean to put you in that position." Dean said. "I mean, you didn't really have much of a choice."
I recently started school again and I thought it would be fine because I'm taking way less classes than I usually do but I have this one class that is so hard and it's kicking my butt, but! I'm starting to find my rhythm again (3 months of nothing and suddenly being bombarded with work is hard, gosh)
Dean would be back just before dinner. He spent time watching the children that couldn’t be picked up right away and then doing his work at school so he wouldn’t have to bring it home. Castiel did not mind. They always spent the evenings together, often chatting or watching television.
"Did Castiel do the same in return?" Michael asked. "Did he tell you that he's scared of himself and so he hides in the middle of nowhere like a coward?"
"One last thing," Crowley said, and Castiel could barely refrain from rolling his eyes as he looked back.
"I, er, I don't suppose it would hurt." Castiel stammered. "I have to talk to Mr. Dean for a moment, though."
“She’s not wrong, you know.” He said, his voice hoarse. Tears slipped from his eyes. “I’m not her real dad.”
Without permission, tears began to build up in Castiel’s eyes. He shook his head, hoping to force them away, but they started to trickle down his cheeks anyway.
Castiel found that he quite enjoyed that idea. He’d had a big family growing up, but, save for Gabriel, Castiel hadn’t been close to any of his family members. The idea of a close and loving family, the types portrayed in movies and books, had always been something that captivated him. He had that chance now with Dean to grow their family and experience the world together.
I don't particularly care for this chapter, but I've been kind of without inspiration for a few months so this is my first attempting at getting into a writing groove
“Yes, of course.” Castiel replied easily. Dean appreciated that he knew to give Dean space and not to push. “What would you like to talk about?”
"No!" Castiel interrupted loudly, flailing in his attempt to grab onto Dean and prevent him from leaving. Dean froze under his hold.
“Anyways,” he said, “I would like to continue tutoring you, if you’re willing to give me another chance.”
"I eating at the restaurant." Castiel said, gesturing to the building behind him. "What are you doing here?"
Castiel screamed again and Balthazar shouted in alarm. Castiel started twisting and kicking at the thing, but it only tightened its grip and pulled him more. Castiel started to slip back off the boat. Balthazar grabbed him by his arms and
“Okay, well, that’s settled!” Gabriel spun and flounced away, leaving Dean in a mixture of triumph and confusion.
There’s a mischievous twinkle in Cas’s eyes. “That’s rather rude to say to the man that’s carrying you.”
"I would move out here, if you'd let me, except that I can't bear to leave my garden behind. I might be able to transport back and forth, but I wouldn't be able to bring you with me, and it would be rather taxing on my magic. I completely understand if you want to stay here with your family. It's been a long time since you've seen them and they clearly miss you. I'd hate to be the one to drag you away. If it's a matter of our bond and you've decided that you don't want it now that you have your family back, I could try to break it. It may hurt, but if we both take the brunt of it, you should be able to survive-"
They walked back to the castle and to Dean’s room in silence. Only once Dean was in his doorway facing Castiel did he speak again.
"What is it?" Dean asked, his voice softening. He knelt down in the sand so that he was eye-level with the pup.
As Castiel stared at Ellen, he began to realize that if his own mother had been more attentive and loving, it probably would've felt like how it felt with Ellen.
They remained in a tense sort of stalemate until the ferris wheel was finally at the bottom again. The worker took one sniff and then blushed furiously.
"Is Andrea your mate?" Castiel asked. Dean and Benny blinked at Castiel, like they had forgotten he was there.
It took around an hour for Castiel to clean up downstairs. He was very thorough when he swept up the broken plates. They didn't wear shoes inside, and Castiel would hate if Claire stepped on a piece of glass.
Castiel prepared to start distancing himself from Dean, before Dean could befriend him and it would be too late, but Dean showed up to their session smiling and out of breath and he promptly handed Castiel a large chocolate muffin.
"Don't know." Bobby shrugged. "My best guess, as cheesy as it sounds, is that Mary and John truly loved each other, and somehow that let them make a baby. Man, they were ecstatic when Dean was born with wings. They thought it was safer for him that way."
"Hey, I'm going to go." Dean said quietly, feeling incredibly hurt in Claire's behalf. "I'll see you on Monday."
"Get yer ass over here and take a seat." Another man, an older one with a cap and greying beard, ordered. Castiel walked over and sat down a seat away from them so he could turn towards them without being too close.
Castiel took a moment to admire the carefree expression on the omega. No doubt it had been a while since Dean had been up in the air.
“Traditionally, yes.” Sam answered. “But you’re free to do whatever you want, despite your designation.”
"What?" Castiel felt his face scrunch up. He was utterly baffled. He had never heard of an angel that hadn't been to heaven before. "Then, where were you born? Where did you grow up?"
Dean gets through the counter and most of the booths, and then there is one last customer. He’s sitting by the window, but he’s staring down at the table. He hasn’t really looked up since he got in. Dean noticed this, ‘cause usually a depressed customer means he might not get any tip or if Dean can cheer them up he may get the usual tip plus a little extra.
"This is Dean. He was kept prisoner next to me while I was imprisoned. We escaped together." He answered. "Why are you working with a demon?" Castiel wasn't about to discuss Dean's potential of ending the war just yet, he needed to make sure he could trust Gabriel.
Claire and Dean walked back into the living room, both their scents subdued. Claire went straight down the hall, presumably to her room, without saying anything. Dean stared at the floor.
Castiel swallowed and bookmarked his book. He slowly put it down and turned on the couch to make room for Claire. He patted the space next to him.
“It was more than that, Mr. Walker,” Lisa said, “Students are encouraged, but not forced, to spend time with more students than just their friends, but that is not what happened. Gordon and Aidan worked to prevent Adam from enjoying recess at all. There was even some physical altercation between Gordon and Adam. Gordon pushed Adam.”
clean up before they opened gifts. Since he had to make breakfast before they could eat, it ended up taking three hours, which meant they were ready to open gifts by nine. Still early, but better than fucking six in the morning.
“Well, fuck.” Dean said. “So there’s no ritual or anything in this stupid universe that will get us back?”
Gabriel was an energetic and, truthfully, slightly erratic omega. He was also one of the most entertaining people that Dean had ever met (not that he’d ever admit it to Gabe).
To keep an omega locked away and mistreated was a terrible transgression. Castiel felt a crushing hate in his body, and he wanted to tear the demons limb from limb. An overwhelming protective urge had Castiel wanting to grab Dean and surround him with his wings.
A few of Castiel's customers arrived not long after opening and expressed their concern since Castiel had been unusually closed the day prior. Castiel blushed and ignored Dean smirking across the room. He explained that he and his employee had both come down with a twenty-four hour bug, but, thankfully, they were feeling much better.
Dean sighs and scratches his neck. He blinks to keep himself awake. It’s a slow day in the diner and he only managed about two hours of nightmare-free sleep last night.
“Eh, I had my fill.” Dean said. He handed Claire more of the salad, he didn’t want to get the ducklings sick on fries. Claire laughed as she chucked the pieces of lettuce and carrots and other various vegetables at the ducklings.
Once Dean finished he put on his pajamas and stepped out of the bathroom. He paused as he entered the bathroom.
In the end, Dean shouldn’t have worried so much. Castiel did not take a shift as his guard the following day, but Dean did find parchment and a quill at his door, along with a handwritten message that read, “You may not be able to see your brother, but you should be able to speak with him.”
"I'll take you there." Castiel promised spontaneously. "Once we leave this place, I'll show you around. Center Heaven is beautiful too, but it's mostly buildings instead of forests or rivers."
Castiel dutifully followed his mother into the massive house. They walked through the entrance way to the dining room, where everyone was already seated.
Heats were the worst, but at least in Novak they believed it acceptable for omegas to use toys to help alleviate the pain. Dean had only ever snuck in items to help him through his heats in the past (which, admittedly, included items that were not meant for that particular use and were probably more of a danger than a help), so it was quite a change to be provided with heat-specific toys. Dean was also offered a lot of herbal tea to help suppress the symptoms of heat, another thing that Winchester did not believe in (because alphas claimed that omegas should not try to lessen their heats and prevent their only purposes in life).
speak of the king of Novak, and your future husband, like that! I did not raise such a disrespectful omega! You are nearly twenty-five, Dean, this is long past due!”
Castiel rolled his eyes and then glared at the boat tied up to the docks. He had no idea why Balthazar would want to rent one of those for his birthdays, but he hadn’t told Castiel why they were going down to the beach until they’d already gotten there, so Castiel hadn’t been able to protest.
Ellen set Castiel to work. He took out the trash, changed the litter box, vacuumed, swept and mopped, and went to the store for groceries.
Dean ignored them both. He brushed his nose against Castiel’s left calf. There was a sweep of wet warmth against Castiel’s skin and he pulled his legs back violently when he realized Dean was
“Thank you, Dean.” Castiel took the gift bag from him and spent a second admiring the silver and gold design.
The immense amount of guilt that flooded Castiel was just as efficient as taking a cold shower. He sat straight in his bed, panting, and trying to deal with the sudden onslaught of shame he felt. How could he think such thoughts about Dean? Dean trusted him. Dean had obviously been mistreated in the past.
He raised an eyebrow at the knights, wondering if they’d just brought him straight to the King’s quarters because the King couldn’t keep it in his pants until the wedding.
"Yup." Claire said as she stabbed a piece of lettuce with her fork. "He told me all about lions and tigers today. He knows a lot!"
- more powerful than I am, but I was young and brash and determined to prove myself. I made mistakes, pushed myself too far."
Castiel murmured his agreement as he thought. He moved so he was tucked into the corner between the back wall of his cell and the bars separating him from Dean.
"I wish I could understand you." Castiel said. "I suppose that easier communication will come with our temporary bond."
"You've gotten so big." Ellen said as she pulled back. Her voice sounded watery, like she was trying not to cry. Castiel could see that Dean's eyes were tear-filled.
to admit you’re in love with someone. All those fucking romcoms (that Dean never watched, of course) were fake.
Castiel left the room for the bathroom, trusting that the familiar would just follow him. He was not disappointed.
The omega's chest rose softly with each breath. His expression was content and relaxed, which made Castiel happy. Dean's back was pressed against Castiel's chest, and Castiel had an arm wrapped protectively around Dean. It was all very domestic, and he didn't want to move.
feeling better, and it was definitely because of his conversation with Castiel. The alpha had an effect on Dean that he didn’t understand.
Another note - I know Dean doesn't like to talk about stuff but he was making an extra effort for Cas <3
Castiel waited, prickling with anxiety, as soft ticks were heard. Dean looked extremely focused. His eyes were intent on the lock and his tongue stuck out of his mouth just a bit.
Castiel merely sighed. He had expected Gabriel to disagree with their mother's involvement, though he hadn't expected Gabriel to react so angrily. Castiel supposed it made sense. Gabriel was the closest any of their siblings got to completely disobeying their mother. While Gabriel had been supposed to take a leadership role within the company, he had started a secret business on the side in which he sold treats of every type. His business had done exceedingly well, and so Gabriel revealed it to their mother and quit the company to open a shop all in one breath. Naomi had been enraged, though it hadn't taken long for her to come around. Gabriel's shop had an excellent and popular reputation, which in turn made their family look better, and the smaller sweet business made their family seem more personal. Naomi had been pleased that Gabriel had been doing well, so they had made the agreement that if he continued to do well for at least a year, then she would let him off the hook. In Castiel's opinion, it was just another way for their mother to have some sort of control. This way
"Yes, but it's safer and easier with a third, so I'll be the one to channel your conscious into his mind and monitor you both."
"Hmm." Bobby leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms, his gaze casting over Castiel and Gabriel. Castiel straightened his shoulders and held up his chin. Gabriel only smirked.
Sam went to buy the picture, and Dean was practically hopping by the time he got back because it was their turn to go to Star Wars Land.
"It's alright." Castiel said. "I'll get a sitter. Thank you for today, Claire is excited you're coming."
Ellen was waiting patiently for them when the exited the bathroom. She eyed Dean thoughtfully, her eyes flicking between the two angels.
“Not really.” Dean said. “The kid who felt bad, his dad was mostly concerned that kids should be allowed to have their own opinions. I don’t think he really meant for his kid to be mean to Adam, but I think he was too proud to really say anything. The other kid’s dad was very upset his kid was even in trouble.”
Immediately the others, Gabe included, started to thank him too. It made Dean feel at least a little better (and a lot more smug) with Gabe.
“No, I got that,” Dean assured him. “Thanks for sharing with me, it actually does make me feel better.”
“I want up too!” Claire said. Dean wrapped his free arm around Claire and hoisted her up. They both squealed in Dean’s ears as he stood.
The beta sat with his son and sent the group a sheepish grin. His son frowned and looked in no particular direction.
"I have a new idea." Alastair clapped his hands together once and smirked. "Castiel I'm giving you a choice."
“There isn’t anything we can do about that, Sammy. Well, actually the alliance between Winchester and Novak will be helpful, so I suppose I
In the evening, Dean drove Adam down to the beach. There was a good burger place down there that he knew Adam loved. He even planned on letting him get more ice-cream later.
Dean’s fins were their own story. He had two: a caudal fin and a dorsal fin. His dorsal fin began near the top of Dean’s tail and ran about half the length. The caudal fin was much wider than Castiel would’ve expected, probably around Castiel’s armspan when stretched out. The fins were a darker green than Dean’s main tail and the tips were an inky blue. The fins had a ruffled, fabric-like sort of pattern that reminded Castiel of betta fish.
Castiel tried really hard not to let his displeasure show in his scent. He was exhausted mentally, physically, and emotionally. The last thing he wanted to do was try to hold a conversation with his brother and brother-in-law.
“That’s not a thing, at least not for me. Love at first sight is based solely on physical appearance, and that doesn’t matter to me.”
"Soon." He said. The return of his grace had given him a boost, but his injuries, and Dean's additional weight, were taken a toll.
Dean let out a breath and leaned back into the tree. He stared up at the sky. There was a small area between two trees where no leaves grew, and Castiel could see the stars beyond. He figured that that was what Dean was staring at. Castiel leaned back as well. His wings were still tucked behind him, acting as a sort of padding against the bark.
It was near the end of October, so the garden was in no means near full bloom, but Castiel still enjoyed it, especially the privacy it offered. He said as much to April.
Claire’s expression morphed from shock to defiance, like she wanted to stay and keep fighting with them(and why were they even fighting in the first place?), but in the end she spun around and marched away without another word.
He’s been working here for almost two months already and he’s so very close to being able to afford an apartment. It’ll be a cheap one, that’s for sure, but Dean thinks it will be a great step in the right direction.
Castiel was sitting on the bed, under the covers, and reading a book. Dean had no idea where he’d gotten it, but that was not important. What was important was how fucking soft and domestic Castiel looked in his pajams and in bed.
Recap: Cas and Claire got their nails done, then Cas went to the restaurant for his date with April and saw Dean with Adam, who called Dean "mama"
Dean returned to his deer form for the afternoon round through the garden. There wasn't much to do. There were a few wilted plants here and there and some nibbled leaves, but nothing difficult to tend to.
also, just a heads up, I'll be having finals soon so the chapters may come later / not at all over the next few weeks but then after that I'll be in summer break !
He and Dean took their shifts diligently throughout the night, and at the first light of dawn they continued onwards.
Now, there was only the matter of figuring out who Dean's mother way. He had said her name was Mary. Off the top of his head, he couldn't think of an angel that had strangely gone missing, certainly not one with white wings.
Castiel was woken, rather rudely, by the demons dumping a bucket of water on him and Dean. They chortled and snickered as they kicked at Castiel's legs.
So Castiel had his mind made up. He relished this minute comfort while he could, but he refused to let himself get attached.
"Probably tomorrow." Dean answered, grimacing. "Wanted to thank you, Ellen, and say I missed you." He ducked his head, flushing to his ears.
Often, Castiel found himself worrying about when Dean would leave. He'd already adjusted so quickly to the familiar's presence, it would be difficult to get back to normal without Dean. But Dean never gave any indication that he wanted to leave. He never said anything about his past or his future. Castiel was a bit curious, but he respected Dean's privacy. The last thing he wanted to do was scare Dean away by asking too many intrusive questions.
“And, it didn’t feel right.” Castiel finally admitted, cheeks flaming. He wasn’t sure he’d ever been this embarrassed. He loathed speaking about personal intimate encounters, especially with Gabe.
"I suppose we can invite him." Castiel said. "Though, there's no guarantee that he'll come. He might be busy. Don't be too upset if he says he can't, okay?"
Castiel swiftly crossed the room to stand in front of Dean. He stopped when they were merely a foot apart and rose a hand to Dean's shoulder.
After Indiana Jones, they went on the Jungle Cruise (which was lame, in Dean’s opinion, but Cas seemed to enjoy it) and the Pirates of the Carribean ride (way more fun). They ate lunch at the Blue Bayou Restaurant, so they could see the ride’s boats take off as they ate. It was a very cool experience.
Dean's breathing finally began to even out, and, surprisingly, Castiel found himself relaxing. He forced himself to stay alert, though. He needed to find a way out of here, for himself and for Dean.
Sam and Gabe did stay for breakfast, and Castiel invited them to come with him and Jack to see Dean. It hurt to ask, but Castiel wanted to go with them because Dean deserved to be surrounded by family. Sam’s eyes grew a little misty, but nobody mentioned it, and Gabe and Sam agreed that they’d drive home to refresh themselves and then meet Castiel at the hospital.
They got ready for bed together in their bathroom and then changed in front of Dean’s nest. Castiel was hesitant to get in it. He had changed the sheets that were dirty after Dean’s water broke, but the nest still smelled a lot like anticipation and anxiety mixed together, only underneath were the comforting and familiar tones of Dean.
"We camp for here for the night." Alastair ordered. Several demons chained Castiel and Dean to a large tree near the center of their camp. The others set camp and got a fire going.
"I would like to take you home and bandage you. It is cold and wet out here, your injury could get infected. You may leave as soon as you would like after that."
Everything felt so mundane and boring that Castiel was practically crawling out of his skin throughout dinner. When Mr. Kelly suggested they move to the living room to have dessert or a glass of wine and to talk, Castiel felt like screaming.
Dean's lips parted against Castiel's and the witch did not hesitate in slipping in his tongue to deepen the kiss. Dean arched against him and moaned.
Castiel did not resent it or hold it against Gabriel at all. He knew that Gabriel had his own problems to deal with and having someone as miserable and cynic as Castiel around only served to trigger Gabriel, so he had needed to put some space between them. Maybe it would have been different if Castiel had taken Gabriel's advice and seen a psychic-witch.
There was a beat of silence before April spoke up. "I think that would be a fine idea, it would give us the chance to get to know her."
"It was so much fun!" Claire chimed in. "We went to the park and Uncle Gabriel let me sample his treats!"
"Castiel, it's really dangerous. If Dean dies while you're still there, you'll die. If he tries to expel you, it could kill both of you, if not seriously damage you. If something happens and I need to pull you out of his mind forcefully it could also kill you both. The only way you can safely leave is if you want to leave and he wants to release you from his mind." Gabriel explained in a strained tone.
The blonde woman, Jess, rolled her eyes and smiled. "So are you. I missed those gorgeous green eyes of yours."
"Dean." Castiel rasped, searching for his friend. Dean was unmoving behind him. The demons were drawing even closer.
“Yeah, that’s perfect.” Dean nodded. He took out his phone. “Here, uh, put your number in, if that’s alright.” God, since when was he such a fumbling mess?
Okay so I don't know a whole lot on families outside of my own, but I feel like what Dean said is mostly true - apologies if it's wrong
“Yeah, I’m not entirely sure what’s going on either.” Gabe said. “I am having a blast though. You kids want food?”
"Take them to the dungeon." Alastair commanded, not even bothering to look at the pair of angels. Castiel's hand had been holding steadily onto Dean's forearm the entire time, and his grip tightened at Alastair's order. He did not want to be separated from Dean again.
Castiel glanced back up. Dean was looking forward. His eyes had lost their blue and had returned to their green. Castiel could see the sheen of tears in Dean's eyes and make out the subtle tremors in his shoulders.
He wasn't sure what to make of that. He decided to ignore it for time being, though. No point in thinking about it if it wasn't necessary.
"I haven't seen it yet, but thank you." Castiel said. "Actually, are you available tomorrow? I have a... thing that I can't get out of."
He was a hypocrite. He wanted the other angels to accept Dean and their fledgling and he attacked them both the second he realized Dean was different than he thought.
Castiel blinked and looked up from his book. There was a boy standing in front of him, a tall boy. He had sandy brown hair and bright green eyes and a splatter of freckles across his skin. He was staring down at Castiel and smirking.
The man blinked rapidly several times, his entire stature stiffening, before he practically threw himself forward and wrapped his arms around Dean. Dean stumbled back a step before hugging the man back.
It wasn't much time before the guards returned. Castiel stood and flared his wings, ready to hurl any sort of verbal abuse he could to keep them away from Dean. But this time the demons opened the door to Castiel's cage.
"I am sorry, friends, I have nothing for you right now." Castiel said. The birds hopped a few paces near him, still eyeing his empty hands. Then they fluttered their wings unhappily and flew off.
"Thanks for bringing me home." Dean's words were warm and ticklish against Castiel's neck, and he shivered.
There was one thing he truly did love: it was free. Well, there were taxes, of course, but it still felt free. Dean couldn't even begin to imagine how expensive it would be to send Sam, and now Adam, to a private school with tuition. Dean sort of thought of the public education system as free child care. While Adam was at school learning, Dean had much more time to do things.
They’d left right away, without leaving a note or anything. Dean thought a clean cut would be for the best.
“I’m not always a saint, Dean.” Castiel says softly. “And you’re not wrong to be upset. You’ve been through something that’s incredibly traumatic.”
Castiel mustered as much energy as he could to get off of Balthazar. He pushed himself up so he was sitting, then shakily got up onto his feet.
Dean could not keep himself from moaning at the taste. He had never known how much he was missing out on by not having fresh honey.
“You don’t gotta be with me if you aren’t ready, Cas.” Dean assures him. “I shoulda asked you before I made a move. If you need time, I’ll wait, and if you still don’t want me after, then I’m not going to hold it against you. You’re my best friend, man, and I’d hate to lose you just because I can be a fucking idiot and-”
It was a small comfort given the circumstances. It lasted until Dean's heat spiked again, and then Castiel returned to hating himself.
Castiel went back to Claire's room to retrieve his daughter. She put away her toys, a bit reluctantly, and then joined him to eat in the kitchen. It may have been more proper to eat in the dining room, but Castiel thought it too formal and large for just Claire and himself. It was different back when Amelia was there, but there was nothing Castiel could do about that.
"As do you." Alastair smoothly interrupted. "After all, you have just finished sharing his heat with him, haven't you?"
Castiel could not find it in himself to pause and respond when Dean's food was so delicious and he was so very hungry.
“Oh, please.” Charlie said, rolling her eyes again. “Do you see me drooling over every male omega I see? The alpha-omega designations can only make you interested in people you’d already feel attracted to. Take it from me. You’re hot as hell, but I wouldn’t touch your dick with a twelve-foot pull.”
"You assbutts!" Castiel screamed, pushing himself against the bars and reaching for the demons as they left. "Come back here, cowards!"
“Yeah, family can be like that.” He said. “My brother can be a pain in my ass, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”
Dean wondered, briefly, if his room had been chosen this way to deter him from attempting to escape.
The local government had been great about helping Dean pay for food and other necessities and they’re willing to pay for one extra week at the motel since Dean got a job, but they’re firm that they don’t have the money in their small budget to do anything more. Dean gets paid biweekly, so the timing works out that he gets his first paycheck right before the end of his paid three-weeks stay at the motel. The paycheck isn’t a whole lot, but it’s enough for Dean to pay for another week and he won’t be begging for scraps at the diner.
Dean chose to be a guinea pig that morning, which Castiel thought was unfairly adorable. Dean's coat was tan with white banded around his back and face. Castiel walked slowly along the pathways of his garden so that Dean could keep up with him. Dean's nose twitched as he sniffed at every plant.
"Okay." Jo said as she continued to eye Castiel. "I'll take your word for it since you seem so sure. He's good right now, though?"
Castiel found that he felt stronger in the morning. The Darkness was finally leaving his system and allowing his grace to heal him. Dean looked better as well, though in the morning hours he was often sick. It was disconcerting, to say the least, but at least his bile no longer contained blood. Dean was healing.
Castiel sent him a nasty glare. “I am behind on my community service hours, not that it’s any of your business. Otherwise I’d leave you to some sorry tutor who wouldn’t teach you anything, because they’d be too busy worshipping the ground you walk on.”
“How much have you researched?” Dean asked. “Even if there isn’t any supernatural shit, there’s still folklore, right?”
There was a loud pounding at the door that had Castiel flinching and looking over his shoulder in the direction of the door.
Dean paused briefly in the doorway, still unused to seeing Charlie, original Charlie, alive and well. She was another byproduct of the Jack versus Chuck debacle. There had been a blinding flash when Jack finally Kirby-ed Chuck, and then Charlie was standing in front of them, just as shocked as they were.
In the morning, Dean woke to a tangle of limbs wrapped tightly around his torso and Christmas music blaring through the house.
"We should have told you that sooner." The older woman said. "My name's Ellen. Benny, Jo, Garth, and I, along with a few others, came and got you. Garth's the lanky one. Honestly I'm surprised he's stayed quiet for so long."
"I know." Dean said, still looking uncertain. In one fluid motion, he stepped forward and knocked loudly on the door. Then he stepped back to stand next to Castiel. Gabriel was behind them and he stayed quiet, thankfully.
Castiel strolled leisurely throughout his garden. He stopped and kneeled by a few plants that were a little wilted and sent just a bit of magic to heal them and guide them in growth. They trembled in response.
"Whatever, man." Dean sighed. "Can you at least keep it down for a bit so I can get some rest. It's been a long day and I bet those demons will be back soon."
“I want to know why my mom left.” She said again, her voice wavering only slightly. Castiel could tell she was fighting hard to keep her composure.
"Well, that was a very sweet reunion." Gabriel said. He threw his arms around Castiel, throwing Castiel off balance. "Really, I'm all warm and gooey, but I'm starting to feel a little left out."
The possibility that they were actually something to be feared, though, that terrified Castiel. He did not want to think about the chance that they were a sort of horrible, taunting vision of the future.
No one said anything. The silence was the most oppressive he’d felt in a very long time. He clenched his hands underneath the table and tried not to let his scent grow stressed or anxious.
“I don’t want to go through with it.” Dean admitted. “But I have no other options. I can’t go home and Cas… and no one else would care to stand by me should I call it off.”
“Yes. You know, when something touches a particular spot on your body in a way that makes you laugh because it feels funny?”
“If you say so.” She said, “I’ll still be by with some casseroles later. You call me if you ever need anything, even if it’s just twenty minutes to yourself so you can shower.”
"What does that matter?" Castiel argued. "I'll fly us as far as I can, then we'll run on foot. It may be harder, but we can still make it."
As soon as the bell rang, Castiel jumped up from his seat and rushed to the back of the room. He ignored the curious glances of his classmates as he approached Dean. He tried to look confident as he walked, because Gabe always said that walking with confidence would trick others into thinking that whatever you were doing was what you were supposed to be doing (though, he mostly said that whenever he was sneaking candy into the movie theater).
He couldn't help but think about how nice it would be to have a permanent job as a nanny, though. He wouldn't have to get late shifts at the Roadhouse, and he would probably be making much more money that he did as a bartender and babysitter. At the very least, his paycheck would be definite.
" 'Course it has." Bobby replied. "It's been years and he's bonded to this angel." He gestured wildly to Castiel.
Castiel took his hand and together they left the solitude of their room and joined Ellen and Charlie in the kitchen.
He took Castiel’s hand again (and by this point, Castiel suspected his heart would burst from his chest and fly away), and together they left the bedroom and went down the stairs. Dean led him to the dining room, where Castiel was greeted by the rest of Dean’s family. Dean explained the situation, so luckily Jo stopped sending Castiel death glares. Castiel was finally introduced to Sam, who looked as smug as ever when he caught sight of Castiel’s and Dean’s interlocked hands.
