“It’s a compliment, darling," Mary says. "I’m saying you look younger than you are. ‘Not a day over 40?’”
looked, in an effort to remain ignorant to the potentiality that John could want Sherlock in that way, but had never, in fact, wanted him?
the one who’d articulated his desire take things slowly. Regardless, resistance is futile, and Sherlock melts into John’s sturdy embrace, drapes his arm across John’s where it is slung protectively over Sherlock’s torso.
It was so grippingly tight--tighter than a woman--and warm inside. The added pressure to my aroused prick was unspeakably divine.
“I am well aware, thank you, John,” Mycroft says coldly. “I’ve a car on the way. Emergency business, you see. Putting out fires in Australia.”
“Yeah?” John says, breathy with want, grabbing at Sherlock’s arsecheeks and parting them, causing Sherlock’s breath to shudder. “Whatever you want. Anything you want.” John kneads Sherlock’s bum, hefts it. “God, I love your arse.”
This was my first 5+1 fic, and the longest fic I've ever written; it was a constant companion for the past several months. Hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. :))
But then John slides his hand down Sherlock’s arm, watching Sherlock with a kind of dreamy solemnity, and Sherlock turns his head, drops his eyes to watch John’s hand's journey to his forearm. From the corner of his eye, Sherlock sees John lick his lips, and Sherlock turns forward and zeroes in on the silvery spot of saliva John’s left, and then John’s eyes drop to Sherlock’s lips, his weight shifts forward, so slight, and Sherlock suddenly isn’t breathing, and they’re
John plucks the folder out of Sherlock’s hand, pulls out the deed to once again ogle at it. “Why not keep it, Sherlock? You don’t have to use it all the time.” He looks at Mycroft. “It’s all paid for, yeah?”
“We like to have a bit of a laugh with the press, keep the sorry bastards guessing,” John is telling Hafiz. “Keep things open for interpretation; it reels them in, you know? Gets them interested, wanting to see more. My blog’s been a blinding success thanks in no small part to our efforts.” He thumps Sherlock’s back chummily. “Right, Sherlock?”
They remain this way, close, until they reach their limits of discomfort and set to the formidable tasks of getting dressed and cleaning up.
“I’ll allow that,” I said jokingly, though I was stunned to hear him say so. It was not a word I would ascribe to myself.
“A pensioner with appalling fashion taste whose sole companion is a dog that might as well be the ghost of a Victorian woman? How very specific.”
Once we were both in the altogether, I took Holmes by his trim waist and pulled him close, aching to feel his body pressed against mine. With one hand, I grabbed the kissing pricks quashed between our bodies and frigged us with febrile need, and with the other hand, I kneaded Holmes’s small but pert buttock.
Once things ratchet back up to hot and heavy status with Sherlock happily sucking on John’s lovely tongue, John quite rudely pushes him away, his hand braced on Sherlock’s chest to keep him at a distance.
I did not know how to articulate a defence that would have concealed my true feelings for him, and I decided it was not worth it to strain myself in concocting lies.
Sherlock is doggedly ignoring John’s staring, poring over index cards scattered harum-scarum across the kitchen table. Index cards of rosy-hued lip prints.
“I know all relationships have their trials and tribulations but I swear to god, Sherlock Holmes, if you ruin this beautiful thing that you have--”
Sherlock needs more, so he raises his leg, cups the back of his knee, and pulls inward toward his face to allow for a better stretch of his arsehole, making an uncouth
“Agreed,” Sherlock says with a sour look on his face, equally appalled, even though John has seen the man put far more unappetising things in his mouth for the love of science.
“I don’t know why you bothered confronting him,” Sherlock says, pushing back the matted fringe off his forehead. “The more you antagonise those people, the more they come back for seconds, thirds, fourths. You’ve just fed him.”
"Looks like the tiny man outran and outsmarted you," John mutters under his breath. "Fucking cockwomble."
at all. He doesn’t know if Sherlock will turn him down or embrace him--well, embrace quite a lot more of him. Embrace
Holmes then placed a gentle hand on my forearm and hesitantly slid that hand up to my bicep. It was certainly foreign for us to touch like that, though it felt natural and incandescent; to have been deprived of any kind of intimate touch from him for all those years was a crime.
, and while John has been at 221b more and more often in the past year, it isn’t quite the same as them sharing the flat. John has nothing tethering him to his sad little flat in Chelmsford; Mary is gone, but John remains, prefers to live with her ghost rather than live with Sherlock. It cuts Sherlock to the quick more than when Mary was alive—having John back at 221b is attainable, but John elects not to return to him.
“I have it on good authority that propositions were made by you to someone who is very much not female.”
After laying out his and Rosie’s towels in the shade of the tent, John stands to the side to apply sun cream, eyes slipping sideways and catching on the generous curve of Sherlock’s arse as he bends to spread out his towel. It’s not often he gets to see Sherlock wearing so little clothing (for obvious reasons), so he’ll be damned if he’s not going to take advantage of the sights. He’s enshrouded by the secrecy of his sunglasses, anyway, so it’s the perfect opportunity to ogle without Sherlock twigging anything.
Mary is positively radiant and springy, shimmying here, gyrating there, and John zones in on her silk off-white tank top, draped flatteringly over her curves. Being in the thick of breastfeeding, there’s more heft in her breasts, which jiggle ever-so-slightly with every energetic bounce. And since the Boob Jiggle is a delicacy, and John is a man of culture, he settles in for the show, thankful that the table is covering him from the waist down.
As if sensing the renewed attention, the paparazzo is emboldened to reveal himself more fully, stepping around the fence and positioning himself a few metres away, his camera raised. “Big fan of you blokes!” he shouts chirpily. “Mind if I ask a few questions?”
The probability of crossing paths with another man like John--or even a man who is interested in Sherlock, by all meanings of the word
Like a mathematician agonising over a heretofore unsolved, but potentially paradigm-shifting equation, Sherlock shuts himself in his mind and peers at John’s words from every possible angle.
I did as requested, and he got to his knees and pulled my shirt overhead. The subsequent investigative touch of nimble fingers on my bare skin was incendiary and calming all the same--he skimmed up my chest, skated gently over my webbed scar, moved behind me to explore my back, and I closed my eyes and lost myself in his sensuous exploration. I had never been touched like I was an object of fascination; like an object worthy of reverence.
John is being deliberately slow in the extraction, lingering, and he has a weather eye on Sherlock. Assessing, almost. As if he anticipates Sherlock’s façade to crack and wants to catch him out. Sherlock finds that he rather hates the role reversal; evaluator befits him more than evaluee.
“In my defence,” Sherlock says in the way one would speak to a slow child, halting hand still held aloft, “the jump was not meant to be humorous.”
Even though it’d been an entirely unconvincing performance, Mummy eats it up and gathers John into her arms. John becomes a ragdoll, lets himself be hugged mercilessly, blinking SOS in Morse code at Sherlock, but Sherlock can only look on at the assault as a slack-jawed bystander.
And beside him, John is struggling to take off his shoes, trousers, and pants, clocking his head on the ceiling in the process.
“How many times do I have to say it until you believe me?” John laughs, an empty thing, and casts his eyes to the ceiling, intent on imparting a message to the entire universe: “Until
“Then, in that case, to be crystal clear,” John trips over himself to say before regrouping, slowing down his speech, “I need you to know that I want all of it. I want everything that implies. I want
“Why have various cultures over millenia taken a toxic plant and placed such incongruous meanings upon it? What’s the damn
Half-sedate with the euphoria engendered by his ministrations, I slurred a, “Please, yes, my god, yes. Have you an aid?”
Sherlock pops off, mouth a swollen and abstract mess, and circles his finger at John’s tip, saliva and pre-come tinted with lipstick, and uses it to sink his finger into John’s arsehole.
It’s become a tradition of sorts to throw a Christmas Eve do at 221b. Heaven knows why. Might’ve been John’s doing. And every year, against Sherlock’s will, the party becomes more and more expansive by way of decorations and guests. This year, Sherlock’s to have his parents, John, Rosie, Molly, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, Bill Wiggins, and Saville Row Satan in attendance.
“The final question to ponder,” Sherlock murmurs, deliberately busying himself with shoving the credit cards back into their pockets and clapping the wallet closed. “Is: who was that man after you?”
John half-laughs, but he notices with some urgency a fast-approaching, titanic wave so he hooks his hands under Sherlock’s armpits, hauls him to his feet, and slides a secure arm around Sherlock’s waist, holding him steady just as mother nature makes its crash landing.
Sherlock assents begrudgingly--he must be on his best behaviour for the sake of Rosie's future at this establishment (and for the sake of avoiding John's wrath)--and the woman turns around, holds the mobile above their heads.
With his free hand, John arcs an olive into his mouth and picks up a second, holding it between his index finger and thumb for Sherlock, an offering.
“Surprise,” John says, low, into his ear, holding a rectangle-shaped gift aloft at Sherlock’s eye-level. Numbly, Sherlock takes the gift, wanting very much to take John with it, to pull him down into his lap and kiss him. “But probably not really.”
Mémé was quite aloof in her parenting, for one, but it was Mémé’s affair with Flora whilst married to Sherlock’s grandfather that caused the greatest rift in mother-daughter relations, though Sherlock had always thought it a forgivable indiscretion. To be a lesbian trapped in a marriage with a man for three decades--he could do nothing but sympathise with her plight. And yet Mummy’s held a grudge for all these years.
An apology springs onto Sherlock’s tongue, but John says, “No, stop. Don’t apologise. You don’t ever have to apologise.” Then, hypocritically, adds, “Sorry.”
“Shut up,” John growls, pumping Sherlock’s cock feverishly. “Clearly, I’ve never had a good idea in my life.”
Holmes leaned down with dark eyes, but pulled back mere moments after a feather-light touch of our lips. I was alarmed to see that his expression had turned cold and distant.
turns of phrase Sherlock had never thought he’d associate with John. That John had had a relationship, or a fling, with this man that stands before them. Had had a fling with a
Sherlock darts his eyes to the right, to the left. “Not quite.” He swiftly removes his ID from his wallet, slides it across the counter. “Sherlock Holmes. I should be on the approved guardian list for Rosamund Watson.”
Sherlock withdraws the pillow from his back and tips over sideways, snuggling up to its welcoming fluffiness and stretching his legs over John’s lap. Because it seems to be the sort of thing John doesn’t mind at the moment.
“Sure,” John scathes, pushing himself up to his feet. “But I was just reminded of how many times I’ve nearly lost you. Bit of a mood killer, that.”
John clears his throat. "Well. We’ve not had many cases these days. Suppose that’s got him in a state.”
Sherlock swallows him back down and begins to piston his finger inside of John, and the dual sensations, the sight of Sherlock’s beestung, smudged lips stretching around his cock and the brush of finger over his prostate nearly has John flying over the edge.
it. But I could say the same exact bloody thing to you and...” Lestrade peers down the hall into the sitting room, then looks back at Sherlock sheepishly. “You know.”
you,” John is saying, voice rumbling with the portent of danger, as Sherlock carts Rosie away in the opposite direction. “That’s my daughter’s dead fucking mother, you disrespectful piece of shit.”
“Jesus, John, you must’ve spent a bomb on that,” Lestrade says. “Last I remember is Catherine Eddowes’s shawl going for 3 million quid a few years back. I mean, maybe this isn’t on the same level. But, still.”
“You have not visited me in many months and you live very near, so forgive me if I am sceptical of your assertion.”
. An act of kindness, a softening of a blow. At least, if this is the case, John doesn’t seem to mind. At least it will not be cause for the destruction of their friendship. Sherlock is marginally heartened that his own foolish transparency hasn’t been repellent.
Sherlock zeroes in on the ongoing situation across the room. Jamila is holding John’s hand in her lap. John seems to be engrossed in one of Mrs Hudson’s yarns about Frank Hudson and their time in Colombia, is a passive participant in Jamila’s manhandling, doesn’t react when Jamila drapes her other hand over their clasped ones in her lap.
John thrusts wildly, needily, into Sherlock’s mouth, simultaneously drawing Sherlock’s finger in deeper, and Sherlock is making all sorts of strangled noises around John’s cock, his finger slowing, becoming lazy, too distracted by John slamming into his throat, and then John is coming with a powerful shout and spasm, arse clenching around Sherlock’s finger, Sherlock swallowing down his release.
Sherlock guzzles down cake in record time (whilst everyone looks on in disgust). It is the first tactic in his grand Avoid John scheme.
“So sorry to interrupt,” Mummy says, not sounding remorseful in the least, and Sherlock feels a bit like he’s in secondary school, getting caught snogging a friend who’d come to stay for the night (all theoretical, of course; he hadn’t had friends in secondary school). “But we’re going to have cake.”
proximity. John hadn’t moved out of Sherlock’s personal space after acquiring the bottle opener, and a half-step forward would bring them flush together.
He bobs his head fast, licks and lavishes, imprinting the particular and musky taste of John to the annals of his memory--then swaps his mouth for his hand so they can kiss. From John’s lips, Sherlock can taste earthiness (himself) and the bitterness of John’s pre-come, and they kiss and kiss, sloppy and undignified and frenetic, until John is panting and moaning into Sherlock’s mouth, canting his hips up into Sherlock’s tight fist, and Sherlock thinks he’ll never tire of taking John apart like this.
Holmes made a loud noise of disapproval. "Nonsense! Never apologise for your presence, Watson." He appraised me then disappeared suddenly, leaving me bewildered, and hastily reappeared and jut his chin out in the direction of the sitting room. “Come in, my good man. Come in."
I rose from bed and padded into the sitting room to find Holmes draped over the settee, eyes closed, churchwarden pipe hanging precariously from his mouth, a miasma of smoke in cloud above his head. It was a pose I had seen him assume so many times at our old lodgings that the image appeared frozen in time and reinforced that Holmes was not only my past but my present.
After a few final pleasantries are exchanged, Hee-Eun begs off, and Sherlock sets to digging into the dregs of his kimchi-jjigae, hoping John will leave him to it.
“He was a professor; young, well, relatively young. Closeted, but new to his sexuality. Strict Nigerian immigrant parents.”
They are going to continue on like this, it seems. As if it is of no consequence that they are pressed up against each other.
Over the next half hour, Mary has the bright idea to buy John, Sherlock, and herself a few more shots, and John gets comfortably sort-of pissed. His cockles are warmed, and he’s cosy in the little U-shaped booth, Mary to his left, Sherlock to his right. His top two people. (Rosie, of course, doesn’t count. She’s a whole other kettle of fish.) And Greg, he’s here too, and he’s great, but he’s not Sherlock. Nor is he Mary. But he’s not Sherlock either.
“I’ll do it,” John interjects as he gets to his feet, straightens out his shirt, and kneels at the hearth.
Sherlock teaching John how to waltz for John’s wedding had been one of the more daunting encounters of John’s life, and John had been in the crossfire of war and had faced off with serial killers. John had dreaded the day for weeks, and he hadn’t really been sure why, at the time. The

When he looks back at Sherlock, he finds the man well-kissed and debauched, his pupils blown wide. “I could pretend to be her, if you’d like.”
easier." A quirk at the corner of his lips. "Not a brag, that. It’s just what it is. And since the world only sees who I date, it was easy to stay closeted." John holds up the whiskey tumbler, squints into the glass, perhaps hoping for drink to materalise there. “I know I fought hard for people to think I wasn't...." He swallows. "What I was. Am. But I've actually only just started thinking I should just--stop. Life could be--better. Richer. I was going to tell you, eventually; should’ve told you, before.”
“Christ.” John takes the opener from Sherlock, pries off the bottle cap. He’s standing very close; Sherlock can smell beer, lemon, chocolate, a whiff of cologne, and sweat, and it’s very much an appealing mélange, but Sherlock presses his arse against the counter hard enough to leave a bruise, is practically on his tip-toes, is nearly perched atop the counter in his effort to distance himself as much as possible from John. “My family seem like a bunch of numpties in comparison.”
John sits back in his chair, looking smug. And he has every right to be smug, because his blue and purple gingham button-up, exposing a deep vee of tanned skin dusted with blond hair, is flattering not only in colour, but in fit, clinging to his lean torso like a glove.
He must pace himself, let John lead. He will not be presumptuous. He’d done that in the past, and it had been a mistake.
At the start of the evening, we opened a bottle of whiskey and by the natural progression of things one bottle became two. I had never known Holmes to be an avid drinker of spirits and silently marvelled that he was in his cups that night.
Sherlock closes his eyes meditatively, not wanting to dwell on any “option” that doesn’t involve him. “Perhaps you had some hope that there would be a
“I don’t want her,” John says with conviction. He licks his lips, wants Sherlock to touch him. “I don’t want her.”
When John breaks off the kiss, he skims trembling hands from Sherlock’s face down the sides of his neck (throbbing pulse) until he presses them flat against Sherlock’s solid chest (drumming heartbeat).
“Oh, yes,” Hafiz says, looking between John and Sherlock and Rosie. “I was so very sorry to read about your wife. I would’ve contacted you to offer condolences, if I still had your number.”
he's an easy sell, but the buttery ease of Sherlock’s movements, the unvarnished flirtation, his tunnel vision focus on John--it’s all at once overwhelming, confusing, and enticing. Sherlock is peering over his shoulder, looking at John obliquely through heavy-lidded eyes, and John knows that someone doesn’t dance like
“Why anyone bothers to leave London is beyond me,” Sherlock murmurs. “Everywhere else is so pedestrian.”
) touch and taste and learn everything there is to know about the topography of John’s skin and about what he likes.
John slips hands underneath Sherlock’s coat to rest on Sherlock’s waist, the warmth of his hands bleeding through fabric into Sherlock’s skin, and Sherlock slides his hands over John’s ribs to his back, locking his arms around him.
Lestrade is propelled into speaking: “Ellie and I were on the rocks, and I was miserable. You were dead, and John was miserable. We got really fucking pissed--I mean
It’s fiery and intense, as it usually is, but there’s another layer there, one that makes John feel as if he is the only thing that matters, that exists. It’s the kind of look that makes John want to run headlong into a burning building and let it consume him. It’s both too much and not enough, it’s a push-and-pull that has John vibrating with frustration, so he has to look away, to the floor, but there's no escaping Sherlock's magnetism as movement in John's periphery catches his attention, causes him to drag his eyes across the floor toward Sherlock, to trace up his body. Sherlock is still squarely in his own kinesphere, behind an invisible line they aren’t meant to cross, and has his back to John, body moving like a metronome. John can’t do anything else but stare at Sherlock’s arse, pert in his tight trousers, and his mind fires off in multiple directions, picturing Sherlock beneath him, above him, in various permutations that all involve a bed (or a surface, John’s not picky) and not a shred of clothing.
John stares at it. Thinks of Sherlock in it. "Fuck it; I can think of far worse ways to die. Put it on."
Today is the happiest Sherlock has seen him in awhile. Sherlock does not want the day to end if it means no longer bearing witness to John Watson in a rare and delightfully springy state. Although, these past few months have generally seen John warming up to him, after being so remote post-Mary. John had apologised profusely for his actions that day at the morgue with Culverton Smith and Sherlock had accepted the apology, but then they’d taken (unimaginably dull) time apart until John (gloriously) asked to move back into 221b.
John proceeds to eat in philosophic silence, watching Rosie watch the boys. The tension and anger he’d carried on their walk from the Pergola has dissipated, but he’s not yet fully recovered, hasn't said much to Sherlock or to Rosie since the incident.
Thankfully, he had managed not to do anything breathtakingly stupid, even being under the influence of alcohol, hadn’t passed the point of no return and gotten obviously physical with Sherlock. At least he’d managed to practice that much self-restraint, though it’s rather a low bar. And maybe one day John will tell Mary what had transpired because even though he hadn’t done anything with Sherlock, John had wanted so much more, and that had felt like a betrayal.
John struggles to unzip his coat and fling it toward the front of the car, then crawls across the seat, anchors his left hand on Sherlock's right knee, and takes Sherlock into the velvety warmth of his mouth, Sherlock letting out a hitching gasp.
A throat is cleared, and both Wiggins and Sherlock stop glaring at each other to look at the interloper.
After some time, John, miraculously, speaks in a full sentence: “I can’t believe the gall of that bastard.”
Lestrade scrunches up his nose and mimics Sherlock (poorly) at Mrs Hudson, who giggles into her hand.
“Yes, I see that; have we made friends?” John hands over Sherlock’s scone and nods politely at the woman. “Afternoon.”
Sherlock waits to see if John’s digested any of that, but all he sees is John growing increasingly disturbed.
I moved toward Holmes and slowly lowered myself so I was seated on the edge of the table just directly in front of him. I reached out and grasped Holmes’s swollen wrist, cradling the back of the hand and fingers in my upturned palm, then leaned down to inspect it closely.
Sherlock's collapsed onto his arse, and is cradling his throbbing head in hand and cursing under his breath.
John catches Sherlock’s hand and holds it aside, his grip crunching the bones of Sherlock’s fingers together.
father; he cannot possibly fulfill the emotional needs of a child, what with having the emotional bandwidth of a child himself. And, surely, John agrees.
Sherlock watches Janine take Lestrade’s mobile and punch in what is obviously her number with a self-satisfied flourish. Lestrade rubs the back of his neck and looks at the floor. He finds Janine attractive, Sherlock hadn’t lied about that, but he doesn’t see it going any further than a fling. Perhaps that would satisfy Janine. But it wouldn’t satisfy Lestrade--the man’s yet to recover from his divorce awhile back; his various girlfriends since had never been enough. He is looking for stability.
John untangles their now sweaty-palmed hands, carefully depositing Sherlock's hand onto Sherlock’s thigh. “You should have a quick kip.”
On Psittacara holochlorus: also known as a green parakeet, this bird is indeed not native to the U.K.--it’s native to Africa. One (apocryphal) story I came across is that Jimi Hendrix released a pair of these birds on Carnaby Street in the ‘60s and caused the population boom on the Heath. I was so tickled by the idea, but a bit more digging showed that it isn't true.
“Hot toddy, anyone? Made extra,” John says as he swaggers into the sitting room, holding up two steaming mugs of the stuff, and Sherlock forgoes thoughts of slick organs (for the most part) to turn his full attention to John.
“Yes, I will take you home every so often when your father’s job necessitates it, since this went over swimmingly.” He casts a look at the receptionist, who drops her head guiltily. She’d clearly been watching his and Rosie’s entire exchange.
Everyone murmurs similar sentiments and goodbyes. She then looks at Sherlock. “And so lovely seeing you again, Sherlock.”
Sherlock glances at his watch, which reads 23:24, then glances at the state of the room. It’s surprisingly tidy for a room that’d just hosted nine people. John must have cleaned.
Sherlock puckers his lips ever-so-slightly, a tease. John attempts to close the distance, but Sherlock pulls back at the last moment.
The soft admiration on his face has taken on a distinctly murderous bent because, based on their current configuration, he is confronted with the fading scar of Mary’s bullet wound at eye-level.
“Hey, guv?” Wiggins yell-whispers at Sherlock. Sherlock pretends not to hear him, desultorily reaches over his shoulder and unshelves a book. “Guv!” Sherlock begins to read about the history of the Old Bailey. “
about you and Sherlock--I didn’t know what to believe. I thought maybe you’d decided to stay in the closet. Then I saw you got married to a woman. That put them to rest. But now they’re back at it again. So…” Hafiz smiles tentatively. “Looks like they’ve not been far from the mark?”
Kissing is suddenly not enough, so Sherlock rips off his gloves, shoves them into his pocket, and begins to undo John’s belt. Exposed to the nippy air, Sherlock’s bare hands go numb, his fingers stiff, but it doesn't matter. He may have never been more determined to see something through in his entire damn
I puzzled over her wistful--or perhaps morbid--statement as I replied, “There is no one quite like Mr Holmes, that’s for certain. But I suspect there are many years left in the old man just yet.”
This sudden performance of sexuality, after all these years of being enshrouded in the mystery of whether or not Sherlock acknowledges it, whether or not he partakes in it in any way, shape, or form, is staggering to behold.
Sherlock’s finger continues its exploration, this time running up and down over the bulge in John's trousers. John squirms a bit against the wall, pressing forward helplessly, wanting more pressure than a damn
If John had already been attracted to Sherlock, which he most certainly had, then this has brought that attraction to a fever pitch. Just watching Sherlock has made John’s cock swell in the confines of his trousers, and
currently poking holes in John's eardrums has a woman murmuring in sultry tones over a bubblegum pop beat, very possibly catering to the hen do women, who are screaming lyrics at each other in delight. It’s not exactly John's style, but that doesn’t stop Mary from running her hand up his thigh and yelling into his ear, “Dance with me.”
He makes a hasty knot of the dressing gown belt, throws open his door, and sweeps into the hallway just as John’s stomping out of the bathroom.
Sherlock had told him once. Granted, Sherlock had been referring to a serial killer, at the time, which Sherlock is most certainly not (though, that’s not to say he wouldn’t be a doyen of murder if he decided, one day, to wake up on the other side of the law), but John had recognised its dual-purpose.
She’d been shunned by family, especially after she’d come out, but that hadn’t mattered. She had found her bliss with Flora and hadn’t needed anyone else; it’d been just her and Flora against the rest of the world. Sherlock had known his grandmother’s story well, and when he was a boy, he had wished (privately,
“Look, don’t think about all that now, yeah?" John hastens to say. "It is what it is. You'll make it work. You can make it work. But right now, you've more dancing and drinking to do.” Greg swims in front of his eyes. The tequila shots are kicking in. “So sod off and enjoy your night.”
John clears his throat very loudly. “Um. Sorry. I was going to pop downstairs in a bit, was just taking a quick look at the--cleaning Sherlock’s wound.”
“I said ‘are you cold?’” I repeated, louder. “It’s rather warm in this room and yet you are wearing gloves.”
there be potential for physical intimacy, even if just for show? It’s quite sad, really, that Sherlock still thinks about last week. The damnably quaint hand-holding. Its sole purpose may have been to offer a kindness in grief. Tangible affection. But had it set a precedent?
Sherlock’s eyes slide up to meet John’s. He’s not entirely sure how to parse the look on John’s face. A curious smile, glittering eyes. As if he’s not sure what to make of Sherlock even if he’s certain he likes what he sees. They’d used to be so much better at reading each other.
John removes his finger and opens his mouth, begins to kiss and suck at Sherlock’s arsehole with obscene slurping sounds, wringing a chant of “Oh, god, oh, oh, god,” from Sherlock’s throat.
and pleasure, their lips moistening, slick with saliva, tongues in mouths and hands roaming from backs to shoulders to arms to arses.
It’d been fifteen years since Sherlock had last seen Mémé in person, and they’d spoken on the phone just eight times since, which is a shameful reality. If he’d
I learned more about motets than I ever thought I would when trying to figure out how to succinctly describe their uniqueness.... I'll be fun at parties with these titbits, for sure.
“Can’t blame us for thinking it, though, can you? You went running right back to Holmes,” Sherlock hears the paparazzo say. “Did your wife know you were gay?”
“I do not say this in jest!” I asserted, slightly offended. “I can oversee your progress, help you with exercises, and administer medication whenever necessary. Dr. Pendergast, my colleague, would be more than happy to take on my patients,” I said hastily, thinking aloud. “My flat can be sold in no time. It is located in a very central location in London, after all.” I looked at Holmes earnestly. “You must know your good health is of the utmost importance to me, Holmes."
“I am very much on, thank you,” Sherlock says sharply. He will not reveal more than he already, clearly, has. “So you may return to the astonishingly dull task of bullying my father with rugby trivia.”
I kissed his throat and my finger found its way between his buttocks. He moaned wantonly, a sound so foreign to the Holmes I knew but so entirely welcome, and bucked his hips up into my fist. Soon he was manoeuvring us toward my armchair, pushing me so that I fell down onto the cushion, then climbing onto my lap.
Greg does get talkative when he’s pissed, it’s a known fact, but John’s grateful for it this time. He's grateful for Greg’s presence in general, because it’d pulled him back from the precipice of an internal crisis that he’d almost pitched over a few times in the past few years.
Mrs Hudson places her hands on her hips and gives the sitting room a final shufti. “I think it’s nearly done, but I’ll come round tomorrow to do some final touches. Don’t make a mess of the place just yet, we’ve only three more days to go!”
Sherlock can’t see the woman’s eyes behind her overlarge, hideous heart-shaped sunglasses, so he can’t be sure if she is once again addressing her dog or Sherlock.
Sherlock closes his eyes, gnashes his teeth. They are absolutely not going to talk about Victor. Mummy isn’t even supposed to
“I’m sorry, I just thought--I assumed--I’ve been reading the papers, and they said Dr Watson moved back in with you a few months ago after his--and then you were put on the guardian list shortly after that, and now you’re
with a fey flute solo, John sighs and looks at Sherlock, hoping to find commiseration, but Sherlock is otherwise distracted with a thoughtful expression on his face, finger pointed to the ceiling.
Sherlock take John’s wandering hand by the wrist, drapes it on the side of his arsecheek, and John hefts a handful of plush flesh. Perhaps this is supposed to be a part of the fantasy. Perhaps Sherlock is trying to keep John away from all the distinctively male bits. But John doesn't
It’s their second kiss in actuality, but it’s also their true first. It’s the kiss in which they’d cast off their blinders, lifted their curtains, revealed their hearts. It is what Sherlock’s wanted for a very long time, a desire he’d kept under lock and key.
. Has never done slow. But he’s also never been with someone who’s made him want it slow and fast all at once.
John catches his bottom lip between his teeth as if to tamp down a deepening smile. “So about the other reasons. Have you also kept me around because you wanted to snog me?”
John downcasts his eyes and smiles as he reaches around Sherlock--even though there is no need, Sherlock takes up just a small portion of the counter--to deposit the bottle cap and opener on the countertop.
I had often been enraptured by Holmes’s hands, adroit, spidery, beautiful things that produced the finest (and sometimes, when Holmes was in a black mood, the most egregious) music I had ever known. These were hands that had rifled meticulously and endlessly through clues, pored through informative monographs on complex topics, that lovingly stifled the blood that trickled from a knife wound upon my person, had pressed a cool cloth to my forehead when I was ill.
Rosie doesn’t like this, of course, and screams bloody murder, pounding her fists angrily against her thighs. Her cries had lured Mrs Hudson from the kitchen to be audience to the melodrama.
The waves are more than a little distracting, erasing his train of thought, so he goes with the flow, quite literally, jumping in time with the cresting waves, feeling boyish. He lets himself be pulled out into deeper waters until his toes are barely touching the seafloor, then arcs into the water, entering a realm of ethereal quiet. He tries to stay there for as long as his lungs can stand it.
of couple. They aren’t twee, they don’t do PDA--especially not when they haven’t even told anyone that they
“Have to say,” John says, voice all gravel, voraciously watching his thumb trace the rim of Sherlock’s fluttering arsehole, “it feels a bit like my birthday too.”
"Never wanted someone as much as I want you," John says sleepily, as if drunk off their kiss, and something in Sherlock's stomach somersaults and flutters.
It is agonisingly slow, and something breaks in Sherlock as he is overcome with the base need to be fucked into oblivion.
Mary starts to clap and chant Greg’s name, and Greg is emboldened to take the centrestage of their circle, fist-pumping and hopping in time to the beat. John can’t stop grinning, and even Sherlock seems at odds with whether he should be amused or horrified by the display.
To pass the time, Sherlock challenges himself to avoid looking at John, who he had glanced at once or twice (or thrice) before instating this (impossible) challenge to confirm what he’d already known--that John looks delectable in that white undershirt and those grey shorts, muscled and compact and golden, glistening with a sheen of sweat under the dim light of the desk lamp. And even though Sherlock manages not to look, he cannot ignore the nagging desire to
John turns his head left, then right, very deliberately, so everyone understands his position on the matter. He adds a “Nope" for extra clarity.
While Sherlock is a master actor, falsifying a relationship with John could be the most difficult disguise he would ever have to assume.
“I don’t wear linen,” Sherlock says, tossing his head. “I needed to test it. It was a horrendous shirt, anyway.”
“Watson,” said Holmes softly, “you are one of the most brave, wise, kind, and charming men I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. These qualities would be exceedingly favourable for your chosen life partner.”
John is stricken silent before he says, "Sherlock. Do you really still not get it?” He huffs out a disbelieving laugh. “You’re not a stand-in. You’ve never been a stand-in
She sits in a frosty silence on the cab ride home, and John leaves her to it, at a loss. Back at their flat, she doesn’t deign to speak to him, so John resigns himself to his fate and settles in on their uncomfortable vintage sofa, hunkering down for a long night.
into the kitchen. He has to weave through Janine, Mrs Hudson, and John’s latest girlfriend, What’s Her Face, to get there (Lestrade’s gone outside to have a cigarette and Molly’s joined him, even though she doesn’t smoke) and smoothly fends off attempts at conversation. He returns to John unscathed.
“John,” he breathed, his unexpected use of my Christian name causing my heart to flutter, “I am not a traditional man.”
Sherlock scoops up and slides a heaping spoonful of pork belly, tofu, and spicy stew into his mouth, taking his sweet time to swallow and to help himself to a sip of water. “We were discussing your blog," he lies. "She spoke highly of it. Yet another ‘fan’ with questionable taste.”
John listens avidly as Sherlock holds court, and when Sherlock finally stops speaking, John says, “Everything you do is just--fucking amazing.”
The widower and married woman are now giving each other come-hither eyes as they shimmy at each other, excess skin flapping with each movement.
.” Sherlock doesn’t acknowledge John’s “that’s bloody rich!” from the kitchen. “Besides, there’s work to be done.”
“Good lad,” Dad says with restored good cheer, clapping John’s forearm before releasing him from his clutches.
Mummy flaps a hand at him as she turns back toward the warmth of the house. “Don’t be long. You boys will catch your death out here.”
, but I rather think it was to give a show to the handsome young man who did our gutters. Do you remember how red you got up there, darling? Like a lobster! Your lovely skin couldn’t handle it.”
The skin-to-skin proximity is unlike anything else and John doesn’t want to let go. Wants to live here, in Sherlock's arms. But Sherlock is squirming, disentangling himself from John, pushing up and boxing John in with his limbs on all fours.
John can practically hear the smirk in Sherlock's voice as he says, "A noble sacrifice for Queen and country."
John scoffs. “Yeah, okay, being a posh git who knows how to ballroom dance doesn’t make you a better dancer, universally.”
John looks around Lestrade at Sherlock, who’s maintaining an impressive facade, then back to Lestrade sceptically.  “...Right. Jamila needs to go, so I thought we’d all send her off.”
Mummy ignores his attempt at deflection. “Your science experiments and puzzles, they made you very happy, indeed--but this was a different happy. It seemed almost, perhaps, like love.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow, sitting down beside John and leaning back on his hands, the stone railing hot to the touch. “Fishing for compliments? How unlike you.”
“Last I checked, we’re not masquerading as an aristocratic heterosexual couple from the turn of the century. So, yes.”
" She seems over the moon by this, forgetting Sherlock’s momentary bout of rudeness earlier. Tipping her head to indicate John, she asks Sherlock, “
When John places a kiss atop Rosie’s downy head of hair, she squirms enthusiastically in his lap, lavishing the attention. Mrs Hudson makes an owl-like noise of adoration at the tender display.
Too embarrassed to call the police, afraid of staining their society reputations, they’d come to Sherlock for help.
Beneath the headline are two shoddy mobile photos from yesterday’s jaunt on the Heath: one of Sherlock, John, and Rosie picnicking, and one of two human-shaped mounds beneath a blanket (with no doubt as to the identity of the mounds).
“Yeah, so, anyway, the point of all that was: not as straight as you thought.” He adds hastily, “But don’t, for the love of god, tell him that I told you. Okay?”
to be kept away--not from any bit of Sherlock--and the hand on Sherlock’s arse slides around and over Sherlock’s clothed erection. Even then, Sherlock manages not to make a peep, committed to his role as--whatever her name is. John can't be arsed to care at the moment.
I opened my mouth to apologise for whatever it was I’d done wrong, but Holmes spoke first, in a monotone. “Once we venture down this path, I will not, under any circumstances, be able to return to a platonic state of affairs. You must be certain that you wish to expand the frontier of our relationship in this manner.”
“It was torture not being able to do anything about it,” John says, giving Sherlock a slow look-over. “Or at least thinking that you were unavailable.”
John clasps the offered hand and allows himself to be hoisted up onto his good foot with a grunt. “Fine.” He tests his weight on the sprained ankle and hisses through his teeth. It's definitely a sprain, probably a partly ruptured ligament. “It’s just a sprain.”
Sherlock would rather die the most painful of deaths than talk to his mother and Mycroft about this.
With an irritated flourish, Sherlock snatches up the coat, dons it without bothering to button up, and storms outside.
“That’s--good. I mean, it’s good that you. Feel that way. I don’t mean the torture bit. I mean, feel the same way as me, in a way. It’s all very....”
His plan seems to hold up, for a time, until he forgets himself as he stares out the window at a light snowfall, trying his very best to refit his mind back to a state of Johnlessness.
After several minutes of woolgathering and cigarette-puffing, Sherlock lolls his head to the left and finds John leaning louchely against his door and looking back at him with a drunken smile, the dim streetlamp illuminating the clear crystal blue of his eyes.
"As thoughtful as that sentiment is, some things are best left unreciprocated," Holmes murmured under his breath.
Sherlock's mouth hangs open uselessly as he wraps a hand around his cock and gives it a few strokes, knowing at once it's too much--he'll come much too fast--so he grabs a fistful of the bedsheet as a diversion.
Rosie doesn’t notice John’s departure, remains seated in her patch of grass peering studiously into her new toy, a pair of child-friendly binoculars (advertised, tweely, as “bugnoculars”), and when a breeze sweeps up, whipping her high blonde ponytail sideways in the air, she redirects the binoculars from ground to sky to watch the gently-rocking willow and ash trees, her mouth open slightly in wonder. She looks so very small and innocent, and Sherlock finds himself smiling, overcome with a fierce protectiveness and adoration.
“Sherlock, he loved his cottage pie,” Mummy tells the table at large. “Couldn’t get enough of it. I had to ship one out to Cambridge every month….”
How terribly had I miscalculated? I stepped back, ashamed, to assess the damage. Holmes's eyes were shut, expression languid, and he ran a tongue over his lips, slowly, maddeningly, tasting me, then opened his eyes.
The backseat is a bit cramped, certainly, but all it needs is a touch of creativity, so Sherlock reaches around the driver’s seat and pulls at a lever, unlocking the seat for adjustment, folding it into the dashboard.
As the song fades and transitions into something more melodic, a slew of couples enwrap themselves in each other’s arms and glide across the dance floor.
But the push-and-pull feeling recedes when John stops moving, pressed against Sherlock’s arse to the hilt, and leans down to kiss Sherlock in an incongruously chaste way, considering the state of them, just a light press of lips on lips, and Sherlock wraps his legs around John's lower back.
Sherlock changes the subject with nary a break in his step. “You’ve been trying far too hard with Lestrade. Here’s some advice: you don’t need to try. He’s attracted to you, and he’s easy to please.”
Sherlock unearths the book he’d tucked away in the sofa cushion for exactly this kind of mind-numbingly dull occasion, flicks on a lamp, and attempts to read about Cornish folklore.
The pain lances up John's foot as he flops around onto his arse, clutching at his ankle and palpating it.
While the angle is divine, John’s cock slips out twice, and when he pushes back in the second time, they soundlessly agree to manoeuver so that Sherlock is lying on his back, hips lifted, his legs in the air, while John settles on his knees between Sherlock’s legs, hands braced on either side of Sherlock’s head.
They manoeuver through a crowd having quite the knees-up (understandable, as this is the only pub in town open late on a Saturday night), and John, seeming at home, swaggers up to the bar.
This, the joining of their hands, is far less invasive than a hug. Sherlock is surprised by how much it’d affected him earlier, graveside. He’s never given the act much thought before, except for thinking it a bit twee, but perhaps that’d been reductive. It can both stake a claim and/or offer quiet support. And John offers him so little in the way of physical affection, so it is a gift.
“Oh, yes, please, John!” Mummy says enthusiastically, never one to say no to a tipple, especially one with whiskey.
and John can’t help himself, his reputation as a stoic, masculine manly-man’s man who thrives on violence, sport, and red meat be damned.
“Mind the turbulence,” Sherlock deadpans before throwing her in the air and catching her, her laughter ringing in his ears. He finds himself grinning, in turn, as he throws-and-catches, throws-and-catches.
I barked out a laugh, and in turn spilled whiskey from the glass in my hand onto my freshly laundered white nightshirt. I looked down at the offending spots of liquid detestfully.
“As the years went by, I didn’t think I’d see you like that again, and the thought broke my heart.” Mummy places a hand on Sherlock’s forearm, and her kindly voice massages out Sherlock’s tension, “I know I have been very hard on your grandmother over the years. But your grandfather was inconsolable when she’d revealed she was having an affair with Flora. He couldn’t comprehend that she’d fallen in love with a woman, and he was just so very lost. He’d loved your grandmother very much--quite a feat, I may say so--and spiraled into a depression that made me rather vengeful. For years, I felt as if she’d broken up our family and ruined my father. But it’s all just so tragic, I realise--she’d wasted so much of her life with a person she hadn’t loved. She had no other choice, and how horrific that must have been. I wish she hadn’t married my father; I wish she’d had more time with the woman she’d loved. And so you, darling, you mustn’t be complacent.
John licks his lips and runs a hand through his hair, and maybe he’s finally getting into the thrumming music, allowing his limbs and body more fluidity, pushing and rolling his hips forward, boldly offering a tiny, flirty quirk of lips as his eyes glaze over with
John throws an unreadable glance at Sherlock then engulfs a heaping forkful of cake over Rosie’s head.
John’s eyes go dark and hungry, and then he’s withdrawing his cock and shoving back in roughly, jerking Sherlock backwards. “That what you wanted?”
“I don’t know.” John raises his eyes to Sherlock’s again, and they are sparkling with promise--and maybe, just
I was tired of the rigmarole. I yearned to see him; I yearned to be in close proximity to him again, in any fashion, even if those oppressive feelings of love remained.
“Of course you didn’t hear it,” Sherlock blusters. “An average listener wouldn’t notice the key shift in Lassus’s chromatic harmonies--”
I could see that Holmes was no longer captivated by the beauty of the natural world, instead watching and waiting for my next move.
“We haven’t discussed our plans for the charade this weekend. And we all know you can’t act to save your life.”
John blows out a frustrated breath. “Just--clean this up while I’m out. I’m not going to ask you again.” John finally locates his keys, which had been nestled in a tattered
Smiling to himself, John limps his way to the bathroom. He shuts the door and draws the bath, making the temperature fairly cool.
We moved to sit side by side on the settee with a woolen blanket swathing us, Holmes resting his head on my shoulder. It was pure bliss. We had sat on that settee numerous times sharing that very same blanket, but never so close nor so spiritually connected and peaceful. I could not wait for new memories in the same vein--memories we would make together in 221b in the coming year as not only friends, but lovers.
Yet another smile, all for Sherlock, after going so long without is like being fed a feast after a famine.
“Excuse me, everyone,” she says, but it comes out too quiet, a little hoarse. A mere puff of air. No one but Sherlock’s heard. Molly straightens up, rolls her shoulders back and takes a moment to centre herself. Ever tenacious, she tries again. “Excuse me!”
“Oh, hello,” the woman says, perching her sunglasses onto her nostrils like a pince-nez, and Sherlock zeroes in on the faint jaundice of her eyes. “Is this Father?”
“What...?” John says, looking downwards as he feels the featherlight brush of something across the skin exposed by the plunging vee of his shirt. Sherlock’s finger--spidery, short-nailed--is making its descent down John's torso.
John is still stewing in his indignance, only half-aware that Greg’s still blathering on, when Mary barrels toward them, her cheeks flushed with the exertion of dance.
Sherlock stands up slowly and starts out of the room, then stops when he’s at the threshold, turns so he and John are face-to-face.
But John, as ever, bulldozes over the message. “Let me rephrase what I just said in a way you can understand: Can you piss off and let me enjoy this lovely day with my family in peace?”
“She was not a woman of science,” Sherlock says in an impressively clear voice. “I should say: it didn’t pique her interest, though she was always accommodating of my pursuits. But I can’t say with certainty she couldn’t ‘do’ any of it. If she had tried, I’d imagine that she would’ve succeeded.”
noticed Janine after being wholly absorbed in the hateful John-and-Jamila display for the past 10 minutes. She’s leaning against the window just beside him, looking insufferably smug. With a glance over at Jamila and John, she lowers her voice to say, “That’s got to be shit for you.”
After the violin’s packed away, Sherlock heads to the kitchen and makes a fresh batch of tea. He lets the soft conversation from the sitting room fill his head with a soothing buzz, melts as the whiskey he’d had sporadically throughout the day sings sweetly in his veins, and places his face close to the steam coming up from the kettle as the water roils. He feels...cosy. It’s not a typical feeling, at least not these days. He often spends too much time alone in this flat buried in the chaos of his ceaselessly moving mind. It’s a much welcomed departure from the norm.
Sherlock pulls John’s shorts and pants down--thick and flushed cock upstanding against his stomach--just enough to cradle John’s arse, and as he pulls at John’s cock, the idea of tasting John is too insistent to ignore, so Sherlock pushes John’s back against the wall and gets to his knees, his thigh lancing slightly at the aggravation.
As the song starts to die down, Mary meets Greg’s eye and does a panto of sipping a cup, then jabs a finger over Greg’s shoulder. Greg nods enthusiastically, and they head off toward the bar without a word.
His disguise screams money from his blue satin shirt to his tailored, crisp, white Savile Row trousers to his handmade oxfords--and even from his cologne to the product used to slick back his hair. Every item had been meticulously chosen by Sherlock; John would’ve been hopeless on his own. And he can't say he'd minded Sherlock's hovering--in the dressing room, when trying on clothes, Sherlock had rather liked smoothing his hands over the slippery luxury of John’s shirt, over the length and breadth of John’s chest. John had rather liked it too, so much so that he’d asked Sherlock to do it again back home at 221b,
John’s rumbling purr has Sherlock riveted. It inspires a wild thought of smearing pink frosting over his bottom lip and allowing John to lap it up with languorous tease, as if it were ice cream topping a cone. Or use his frosted lip as if it were something else: perhaps a penis? Preferably Sherlock’s. The metaphor could have been better thought out.
But Sherlock doesn’t move a muscle of his face, lest he give away how very much he wishes it were them.
, yes,” John says, mad with arousal, and curses the barrier of clothing as his hands travel wonderingly over the swell of Sherlock’s arsecheeks, feeling gluttonous and spoiled at the same time. “Turn around. Want to see you
“Sorry?” John says, confused, while Sherlock knows precisely the implication of the question, and braces for the impact.
I was unsure as to the exact translation of the French, but I didn’t want to say as much, lest I face Holmes’s chastisement, but context clues gave away his general meaning.
My thoughts stormy, I stopped before a shop’s window to distract myself and was taken by attractive enamelled gold bracelets advertised as engagement items, as in the fashion of some years standing. It was a piece of jewelry that would look most becoming on a pale, slender wrist.
And then it hits him again: that familiar pang of regret. Mémé had given him so much. Had taught him not only French and the violin, but so much about himself and the world.
It’s clear that the situation isn’t going to pivot in their favour any time soon, so Sherlock decides to make the best of it. He’s always been partial to dogs, after all.
Sherlock takes a moment, at the apex of the hill, to drink in the vista: a hodgepodge of austere Medieval buildings dwarfed by glittering skyscrapers. There is a discordance in this marrying of the old and the new, but there is also beauty, an enormity in its union. There is history, rich with art and people, though often bloodied and
A few minutes later, the bedroom door opens and John steps inside, looking every bit worried. “You all right?”
We continued our ramble over verdant land that rose and fell like waves, ostensibly sprawling out into a nothingness, until we saw a chalky promontory in the distance. As we stood near the edge, I looked at Holmes, who paid me no mind, eyes closed as he bathed in the whispering sea breeze, and I allowed my gaze to linger, admiring his sharp profile which cut a striking figure against the pearly blue sky. He was as stately and handsome as ever, like a majestic bird, even in his advanced age; the country air was good to him, though it had been just a short time that he’d dwelled there, and he looked less harsh, younger. Since I was finally allowed to openly look at Holmes in that fashion, that is, in gawking appreciation of his curious beauty, I did not know if I could ever stop.
Sherlock shoves John’s hand away. “Tickety-boo,” he says through clenched teeth, bringing himself to his feet and striding over to Hafiz, ploughing through the ebbing pain. “Apologies for my rather inelegant introduction; I’m not usually so gormless.” He sticks out his arm expectantly, and Hafiz hesitantly takes the offering. They shake, and Sherlock squeezes the life out of his hand, pinioning him with his eyes, wanting to know everything him, more than the eye can see. Wanting to know about this man (this
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “You have an untrained musical ear. In this case, that is very much par for the course with respect to the average person.”
“Or…,” John says distractedly, watching Sherlock examine himself in the full-length mirror. “Or your princess.”
John returns with his pint and Sherlock’s water in either hand, and a plastic cup of pilfered bar olives between his teeth. He unburdens himself of the cups, sliding Sherlock’s water across the table before removing and hanging up his coat.
She hesitates, but takes the leap, gets on her toes to press a kiss to Lestrade’s lips. When they part, they’re grinning stupidly at each other.
But then something shifts in him, and he looks at Sherlock, breaking into a brilliant smile that makes Sherlock's heart sing. “Tea?” he says.
“It wasn’t that. Whenever I looked at her, I couldn’t stop thinking that it was all wrong. That she wasn’t the one for me. I wanted her to be; I really did. But she just wasn’t. And I didn’t do a damn thing about it. I was going to stay, for Rosie’s sake. I wanted Rosie to have a family, wanted her to have her mother around. It was what a family should be, I thought. Now, seeing it at a distance—I had, and have, other options.”
“He had an eye for the gardener too,” Mummy persists, and Sherlock grits his teeth together in frustration. “That little vine weevil ‘experiment’ must have been to get into his good graces.”
John unearths it, a floppy bucket hat with eyes sprouting out its sides like ears and a cheshire grin in the centre. It’s a bit unsettling to look at, to be honest, so John doesn’t spare it too much scrutiny as he places it on her head and ties the strings beneath her chin.
“Behave, boys,” John says and Sherlock watches (not disinterestedly) as John upends his mug of whiskey-tea over his stuck-out tongue to catch the last few drops.
“Wanted to catch you before you swanned off,” Mummy says. “Your father and I thought we’d have you, your brother, and John over for food and drink. It’s just a couple hours' drive, you know, but you’re more than welcome to stay the night, though I know it’s last minute. I suppose we should have thought all this through before….”
“If you know me, you may know Dr John Watson,” Sherlock trips over himself to say, reverting back to English, swishing a hand in John’s direction.
had been swiftly answered when he’d placed a hand on Sherlock’s back, and Sherlock had placed a hand on John’s shoulder, other hands clasped, outstretched, palms slippery with sweat, and John could feel Sherlock’s sinewy solidity beneath his hand, could smell him, had his senses flooded blindingly with
My practice was thriving and busy but every night I would retire to a flat where only dark thoughts kept me company. It was not a dissimilar experience to the three years I had spent in mourning of Holmes’s supposed death and, in that same time frame, my dear Mary’s death.
Dad holds up his glass in John’s direction. “Yes,” he says, “a most hearty welcome to our ridiculous and remarkable little family, John.” Adds, “And a most hearty
Sherlock would love nothing more than to be Rosie’s father. To be with John, and for them to be a family. But it is unclear if John is offering all of it. Life partnership; a relationship.
John presses a kiss to Sherlock’s jaw. “Still a bit unbelievable, this. Us. Wanted it for so long. And we're finally here."
Face flushing, Sherlock clutches his mug of tea (if for no other reason but to stop himself from hurtling it Mycroft’s way). “I
Mary doesn’t speak to him for the next few days, though she leaves pithy notes if communication is crucial. John’s back becomes sore from multiple sleepless nights on their crap sofa. On Sunday, John makes an attempt to talk to her, but she tells him that she isn’t ready. He doesn’t bother trying again.
Holmes snorted loudly. “Of course not! Now, hold your elbow out more, slide the bow carefully, carefully—ah, no. It seems I will be living vicariously through your screeches. I shall have you ready to perform at St. James Hall in a century at this rate!”
“Doesn’t mean your Mum isn’t genuinely grieving. I was devastated when Mary was--,” Sherlock flinches, “when she died.” Mary is always an awkward topic of conversation, so they don’t often invoke her name. Nor do they speak of everything that came shortly After. “But my feelings for her in life were complicated, to say the least.”
Clearly, John doesn’t mind Sherlock’s unreserved attention because it validates the payoff of his exercise regimen. And maybe John has finally awoken to the fact that Sherlock is attracted to him, and is assuring him, yet again, that
After spending an additional hour at the museum, they commute home, give Rosie a bath, set her up in John’s bedroom with her toys, and settle into their respective armchairs in the sitting room.
Sherlock hums contentedly and gives John a peck on the lips. And another. And one more, while John’s smiling.
As I remained boneless in the armchair, Holmes carefully unseated himself, my eyes glazing over at the sight of my seed dripping down the back of his thigh.
“Hypothetically, if we were to say that it’s obvious you and Molly would both be receptive to professions of romantic interest, it would not be analogous to me and a certain man of our mutual acquaintance who is inordinately not attracted to men.”
There’s been a spate of cat abductions in Croydon, though not quite ordinary abductions--polite abductions, if abductions can be polite, the animals returned a day after their disappearances in fine fettle, but tagged with cryptic messages: a pithy phrase or word in Arabic. Sherlock’s Arabic is rusty, but he’s been able to make a connection to the recently-discovered Saqqara tomb and is on the verge of solving the case from this very bench.
Sherlock nods sedately, suddenly very tired. He leans heavily against John’s shoulder and closes his eyes--just to rest them. Just for a moment.
Sherlock notices Wiggins lurking under the mistletoe, leering at Molly. He couldn’t possibly be more obvious unless he stamped his affections across his forehead.
“Oi,” John says, ruffled, swaying back in, but Sherlock presses a hand to his chest to keep him away. “Okay, sorry, but I fully intend to ruin your lipstick job either now or later. So. You'll just need to take your pick when.”
of encouragement. Time passes in a syrupy lassitude during John’s ministrations, and, at some far off point, Sherlock feels an ever-so-slight burning stretch as John’s cockhead nudges past Sherlock’s tight ring of muscle, Sherlock’s body acclimatizing quickly to the intrusion.
“No,” Sherlock says firmly. Then, in an embarrassingly unwieldy sort of way, “It’s, um, quite--very, rather--fine. It’s--good. However, there’s a--we have company.”
reckless. I don’t know how not to be. But I can’t be like that anymore; I have to try to not be like that.” He looks up at Sherlock again, entreating. “And so do you.”
Sherlock tries to restore his composure. “Someone was indeed found in ‘94, but I can’t take all the credit; it was the local constabulary that dredged up the body from the Great Ouse.”
By virtue of Sherlock even considering making a romantic overture, it’s apparent that something in his perception of John has shifted. The probability of John’s receptivity may have increased, though Sherlock’s not sure when it had, exactly. It may have been increasing over the past two years, and may have catapulted to great heights this past week.
Holmes had stepped out from behind a stack of boxes, and looked genuinely surprised by my appearance.
I turned to find Holmes leaning against the closed door, still smiling, but it now took on an amused air.
Placing Sherlock’s hand aside, John raises himself onto his knees and situates himself between Sherlock’s legs. He braces both of his hands on Sherlock’s knees, looks up with a question on his face. “Can I--”
Holmes was watching me with anewed intensity, in the way he oft looked at a corpse that begot a conundrum.
When John makes a muffled noise of wakefulness, Sherlock offers a silky “Good morning” before tightening an arm around John’s chest and hooking a leg over his thigh.
Sherlock nudges his face into John’s neck, and John runs a hand up to rake through Sherlock’s hair. “Shocking news, to be sure.”
, no less--is pitifully low. And while there is significant merit in remaining unattached, Sherlock no longer wants to. (Had he ever wanted to?)
His lips were chapped and whiskey-sweet. He kissed back without hesitation and his lack of technique was made up for in fervour; he kissed like a man parched, my lips, the fountain.
John hurries over to join the scrum, adrenalin pumping in a way that has nothing to do with the game.
Sherlock blinks. He’d forgotten Molly was there. She’s watching Janine speak to Lestrade, her jaw tight.
John’s protests fall on deaf ears, and he’s effectively manhandled onto the dancefloor by Mary, Greg on his heels.
“Sorry,” John says awkwardly, half-in, half-out the door. “But you seemed a little, uh. Off. When you left. So I’m just…checking in.” He looks to his feet.
And in that sense, it was a perfect locale--something Holmes and I could consecrate and have for ourselves.
John slams the ring-box onto the table, clattering kitchenware with the impact, and the box snaps closed, catching on his index finger.
“In fact, until this very day, military personnel assist with research. I cannot discuss what kind of research is being done currently, that’s classified, of course, but I can tell you that the chemical weapons being tested supersede the lethality of nerve agents.”
Sherlock shoves her hand away and pouts. “You've framed that as if I've had one and want more." He raises his chin defiantly. "Besides, I’m not quite sure what you’re implying.”
He’d meant to be careful; to not do too much. Especially not like this, on display for strangers' eyes.
Sherlock doesn’t want to think that John’s sudden saturnine state has to do with their conversation earlier.
“Not at all,” Mummy says. “You are my guest, John. I expect nothing but for you to make yourself at home. And I know you boys set out very early this morning.”
It is so simple, yet so monumental, allowing Sherlock to see, with crystalline clarity, what he’d missed.
“You may not think yourself the marrying type, Holmes, but I think you would make a wonderful life mate,” I said, although Holmes had not asked for my opinion on the matter. “Your genius and sense of justice, your selfless concern for others: only the luckiest of persons would be tethered to you.”
Under the weight of John’s attention, Sherlock turns it up a notch, cocks his leg out to the side, rolls his body like liquid, one hand resting on the cocked leg’s upper thigh, spindly fingers brushing upward toward his hip bone in a teasing trail.
“I get we’re all brilliant here,” John says, “and that I can’t do a damn thing without you knowing about it, but have we really not yet got a handle on the whole ‘keep someone’s privacy private’ thing?”
Holmes let out a loud sigh. "Watson, Watson, Watson," he began softly, shaking his head dismally. "I am but a shell of a man since I can no longer lose myself in Paganini and Sarasate!”
In spite of himself, Sherlock is curious. He snatches up the folder, unties the string, and unsheaths a paper--
“No,” John agrees, holding back laughter. He looks up at Sherlock, who is panting above him. The man's hair is in chaos from the sea, seaweed and sand lodged and caked in his curls, water clinging to his torso, dripping droplets onto John's chest and face.
Sherlock presses a kiss behind John’s ear, nudges his nose into John’s hair, breathing in lavender and rosemary (Sherlock’s favourite shampoo, late-night shower), tracing his hand down John’s stomach and through the thatch of hair haloing his cock.
John’s brows furrow. “Now? I’m really not hungry, but if you want takeaway maybe I could get an appetizer.”
He’s not picked up Rosie from daycare before, but John’s been waylaid at the surgery and had run out of options. John had apologised profusely (unnecessarily) for “burdening” Sherlock with the task, even though Sherlock doesn’t mind, not at all. But Sherlock doesn’t know how Rosie will react to the change of routine. Her life had already been upended to the nth degree when she and John moved from Chelmsford to London; Sherlock would hate to add insult to injury. And while Rosie is comfortable with him, he’s not acted in a guardian capacity before. It could be a smidge discombobulating.
