New York doesn’t look the same.  From the sky or from the streets, the shape of the city has shifted.
He lifts the pillow for a moment and creaks one eye open, his lashes crusty and sticking together. Just one look at Pepper’s arched eyebrow and dry smile tells him she is yanking his chain.
“I hate this,” Steve murmurs brokenly, and Tony wraps an arm around his shoulders, pulls him close, and presses a kiss to his temple.
Nevertheless he is sent.  He goes.  He follows.  He watches.
“I could’ve…hell, I could’ve had you since
.  It’s a classic.”
. Beautiful, lonely Steve Rogers. I’ve been watching you, from afar, for some time now. You must know that.” He reaches up with one finger and traces the line of Steve’s frown. Steve tries not to flinch, not wanting to show Loki even one slight sign of weakness. “As much as I would love to ruin that pompous Stark, I would rather ruin you in other, more…
“Yeah, probably hard to, over your Rocky impersonation,” Tony gestures first to his own ears and then to the punching bag.  “Adrian…!” He Stallone-mumbles, even though he knows Steve won’t get it.  He tries to keep his own expression as level and easygoing as possible as he saunters toward the center of the gym where Steve stands.
“I didn’t think you’d be so worried. I’m really sorry, Buck, I should’ve thought –”
Steven Grant Rogers is beautiful.
“Seriously.
“President Eisenhower,” Tony amends around a mouthful of food.  “And did you actually know him?  Cause even I’d have to admit that’d kinda be awesome in a Forrest Gump meets JFK kind of way.”
“How many times did he come inside you?” Tony asks it so straightforwardly, like asking about the weather. He sits back for a moment, undoes his belt and unzips his own trousers. He lets out a small sigh of relief as some of the pressure on his groin is released.
invite him.  Weeks ago.  Isn’t there some statute of limitation on hospitality?”
“They're not on the payroll, Steve. They're not under contract. Why would you show our work to the competition?”
“Our custody?” Steve repeats.
“I don’t know what you want me to say.” Steve’s very quiet, his voice so low that Tony could’ve missed it had they not been twined so closely together.
Steve turns around quickly.  Tony is leaning in the open doorway, beer in one hand and his phone in the other.  He clicks something on the screen and then shoves it away into his pocket.
He loves the way he can cover Steve’s body with his, now, just as much as he’d loved how Steve’s body used to cover his.
“Oh it’s okay,” Jane assures him, bright and cheerful.  Her cheeks are rosy and her smile is sweet.  If Tony didn’t know she was fucking brilliant, he might be tempted to write her off as a chirpy dimwit.  “Only Thor and Steve do it anyway.”
Light laughter and murmured chatter flows out onto the landing deck like soothing white noise; the piano player is tinkling out some version of “Rhapsody in Blue” and someone’s turned on the big flat screen above the bar.  Times Square is a riot of color and noise; a crowd full of happy faces waiting to chime in the New Year.
“Except I really have no desire to
They freeze, holding their breath, and listen for the sound of Bucky stirring inside his bedroom.
Steve finally sits back, leaning against the blank white wall opposite Tony.
him to be caught here, between lushy Jane and lusty Darcy.
Tony’s wanted this with Steve for so long, he’d been afraid that nothing could ever live up to the expectation. But it’s more than he ever dreamed, and it’s Bucky that’s made it so.
“Sir, your friend needs assistance, would you like me to call the EMTs?” He asks Steve three times, ignoring Steve’s questions, before Steve snaps.
after all this –”
“Ty?” Again, Steve cringes inwardly.
The car disappears from his view as it rounds the final bend up toward the house. Tony considers going down to greet Steve and Happy both, but that seems too overeager, too forced. He wouldn’t do that for anyone else.
“Never heard of him.” Jane nudges Steve with her elbow lightly, conspiratorially, and relief washes over him. Her gaze ticks upward to Natasha, who must signal her own approval because a small smile curls at the edges of Jane’s mouth and Natasha’s hand relaxes on his shoulder. “And did you just imply that I’m
“Okay, Tony.” Steve is back to being half-asleep already, somehow soothed by the sound of Tony’s incessant prattling.
, has
“The thought never crossed my mind.” Bucky lowers his voice to a tight hiss that slowly climbs back up to full volume as he continues on. “Really, Nat, that never occurred to me. I’m just the one who spent his entire childhood perpetually terrified that every little cough, every damned fever, would be the death of him. It’s not like I was up at 3 a.m. calling every hospital in the city or anything.”
Barnes doesn’t ask what’s happened, which only confirms he must’ve known already.
It’s then that Steve realizes that just because he means what he says doesn’t mean Tony will
- knowing that Steve used to be weak and sickly, but finding it so hard to believe when what’s kneeling in front of him now is so strong and perfect.
“We’re having dinner.”
“I can’t imagine that with a mind like yours, you can’t count cards, Stark,” Steve snorts.
“So if Bucky doesn’t want to see me now…he really doesn’t want to see me.  And I can’t say as I blame him.”
Sam wraps up his song early, ending a verse and skipping right to the last few bars, played at twice the normal speed. A few patrons turn their heads toward the piano, curious. The layer of sound once provided by the music is noticeably absent for a long moment, but soon the murmur of conversation adjusts to fill it.
understand?”
“Yeah, yeah, I know. He says jump, you say how high. I’m goin’ inside.” He yanks open the door harshly and lets it slap closed behind him. Tony frowns, eyes tracking Bucky as he goes.
between you and me. Now…”
him before all this, as he was, before the serum and the Avengers and
He doesn’t know how much time he lets pass before he speaks but she waits patiently, knowing that he’s eventually going to have something to say.
“Or you can sub in,” Natasha suggests, already picking up her black duffel bag from by the mirrored wall.  “I’m needed at HQ at 1600.”
Around day eight, Tony decides he needs to break the unspoken rule of minimal conversation.  Steve’s been sketching for four hours already and his presence is distracting.  Tony can’t focus when Steve’s only a few feet away, biting his lip as he concentrates on whatever he’s drawing.  He’d tried turning up the music to drive Steve out but it hadn’t seemed to register.
“JARVIS helped me sort it out.”
“Can’t have that.”  Honestly, he remembers the names of every public figure discussed who “came out”, as they’re apparently calling it these days, as if they’re debutantes stepping out in fancy white dresses, hoping to catch a future husband.  Terminology aside, living openly like that…at the time he kept thinking to himself:
He ends up going to the board meeting the next day, if only to have a handy excuse to turn down Steve’s invitation to join him and Bucky at the batting cages.  The last thing he needs is an image of Steve in a baseball shirt, biceps bulging, as he makes perfect swing after perfect swing.   The pair would probably spend the time waxing nostalgic for the days of the Dodgers at Ebbets Field and gazing at one another adoringly. Tony’s not sad to miss it.
Behind him, the projector rattles. Dust motes dance in the white beam of light streaming from the back of the room. It cuts a widening swath just over his shoulder to reach the big screen he’d recently installed on the wall.
“Your director went that-a-way.”
However, it doesn’t seem to bother the man standing beside him.  Steve can hear England in his accent and suspects he may be a fashion model, but he’s been unable to focus long enough to learn much more.
“Well, he and I have some work to do.”
He felt that even before Steve lost the serum, and he feels it more acutely now.
Tony throws off his touch and storms out, slamming the door behind him so hard that the glass wall vibrates.  Glances are exchanged across the table until Bruce takes his glasses off and carefully puts them in the front pocket of his tweed blazer.
“Cap.”  Tony musters up a bright smile and a bit of manic energy, pushing away painful thoughts of Steve and Natasha in compromising positions.  “You’re here!”
“See if you can get anyone on the horn.  Banner, Hawkeye, Widow,
when it happened.”
It’s uncomfortable but it’s the only option. The mattress springs will squeak; the headboard will rock; the bed frame will creak. Steve can’t even take him up against the wall because the drywall in this place is paper-thin and the sound will travel. The blinds aren’t down and the drapes aren’t closed but Tony thinks, idly, that that can wait until after. It’s late now and dark, the moonlight nearly blocked by the jacaranda tree outside the window, and they’re on the floor already.
been present for the past two days, right?  What did you
He wants it to be true.
“C’mon, Bucky…” Steve bats him away then tries to smooth his hair back into place.  A Canarsie-bound train screeches into the station.  The car doors slide open to unleash a torrent of fellow twenty-somethings onto the Bedford Ave platform.
“You could really use a sprucing up in here, cowboy.  Or perhaps a complete tear down and remodel from the ground up.  Either or.”  Tony comments dryly as he spots the green pilled fabric on the old-fashioned love seat by the old Zenith radio –
“Dunno, I’d think of something. You sold war bonds, maybe I need your help to charm the investors, ever think of that?”
Steve shrugs off her touch and folds his arms over his chest, pulling everything back into himself that he’s let spill loose.  He steels his gaze, swallows against the crack in his voice, and sets his jaw before speaking.
That whole thing had been a mess from start-to-finish, so much so that he's surprised Steve even agreed to meet with him, much less come all the way up to Tony's place.
“Tony.  J.D. Salinger was less of a recluse.”
“Even you?” Tony mouths a betrayal at Thor, who chuckles good-naturedly.
“Tone, deck suspenders,” Bucky, always attuned to the undercurrent of tension between himself and Tony, never misses a chance to push Tony’s buttons.  Looping his arm over Steve’s shoulders, he reaches across to Tony and snaps one of his navy and red striped suspenders sharply.  Steve can practically feel the pain of its thwap against his own skin.  He doubts Tony’s white button-down dress shirt helped cushion any of the sting.
marked across the bottom corner of the personnel form is atrociously tacky.  He wonders whose job it is to make
“Steve, so great to see you,” Pepper says before he gets a word out, standing up and kissing him on the cheek, pulling him into a hug.  “You look very dashing.”
“Sure.  Thanks.”
“It can be.”
Steve gets the sense that maybe he could, that Tony might understand, but he doesn’t want to put that on Tony now. They’ve been together for one illicit, amazing night – he’s registering how his body aches now, and it is a
He’s an elegant older gentleman with a carefully groomed mustache, reminiscent of John Barrymore in
“So?” Tony fails to see the significance, but from the look on Natasha’s face, maybe he should.  “Don’t tell me I’m supposed to get him a gift.” He acts dismayed, clutching imaginary pearls at his neck and fanning his face.  “What does one get for an amnesiac assassin who has everything?  And by everything, of course, I mean absolutely nothing.”
Steve had never been to L.A. before the war, and hadn’t spent all that much time here during his time as Captain America, but even he can see the difference in the air now, can feel it when he breathes. He doesn’t know if it’s his sensitive lungs or if it’s really just growing that bad, but if it gets any worse, Steve might have to figure out a way to pack his glass nebulizer to take with him during his morning exercise.
Steve has him arm slung over Bucky’s shoulders; Bucky has his mechanical arm wrapped familiarly around Steve’s waist.  The thing looks so damn close to real now that it’s obvious SHIELD’s furnished an upgrade.  Tony can’t bring himself to care that the new tech isn’t his.  Steve and Bucky are both wearing similar blue t-shirts, looking like poster boys for the American Dream, and it’s thoroughly obnoxious.
“I appreciate that,” Tony replies, sounding not at all grateful. Jan's smile thins and her eyes narrow.
“You’re hilarious, go away.” Steve doesn’t open his eyes as he bats off the hand Tony is running through his hair.
With his slightly longer, darker hair and the full beard, Cap still doesn’t look quite like himself, but that deep, reassuring voice of his is the same.
is happening up here?”  Natasha gestures around Thor’s face, and the guy only smiles wider.  His brown plaid shirt strains across his chest as he throws his arms wide and then once again brings his heavy hands down on Steve and Clint’s shoulders.
“You have any idea why we’re being called in?”
“Who could deny a romantic offer like that?”
“And nobody says you have to like Tony either,” Natasha adds.  “Believe me, not many people do.”
At the end of the table, Thor lets out a moan that is near orgasmic.
James Barnes has no close living relatives. His sister, Rebecca, died of old age, yet she had been childless. His cousin, Robert, died in the Battle of the Bulge, while his other cousin, Thomas, met his fate on the sands of Omaha Beach. His first cousin once removed, two years old at the time of Robert’s death, had died of a drug overdose in San Francisco in 1963. There’s no way left to scientifically prove any genetic relationship with the Barnes’ line.
and holds it out to Tony.
Pepper, who is already reaching down to pick up his black bowtie, instinctively reaches for them. The second they are in hand, she freezes, the color draining from her face.
“I’ve worked with less.”
“Oh, I dunno, I think I’ll miss the sound of Thor singing in the shower.” Bruce comments idly, slowly looking up from his reading for a moment and adjusting his glasses.
“You really think so?”
“No, it's Loki's shill. It seems he's taken quite the interest in your new leading man. There's been at least a blurb, if not a full story, about Rogers near every day in
There is no sign of Tony, so Steve loiters in the lobby, feeling more uncomfortable with every passing minute. His suit is old and ill-fitted, a tad too short in the legs and tight in the arms, and a rather unfashionable shade of drab brown. He straightens his navy blue tie for what must be the third or fourth time and then shoves his nervous hands into his pockets to still them.
“Tony, this isn’t where we’re staying, are we allowed to-“
“It’s copasetic, Cap.”  Tony holds open the cab door and Steve reluctantly climbs in, half afraid Tony’s going to slam the door behind him and send him back to the hotel alone.  He may have said he could go back on his own, but he doesn’t want to leave Tony on this note.  To his relief, Tony gets in after him.
“You’re just fine, Phil, ignore Tony.” Pepper assures Phil, stepping slightly in front of Tony and extending her hand.  Given that Pepper had explicitly taken care of what he would wear for this occasion and the kind of outfits he’s seen everyone else wearing, Steve suspects that Pepper is being kind.
Tony kisses his temple, then nudges Steve’s face upward with a finger under his chin. Steve blinks up at him, comforted by Tony’s soft smile. God, he loves Tony so much.
“Cigarettes, sure.  But that’s it.”  Tony tilts his head back to look at Steve better, narrowing his eyes.  “What?”
“It’s been ready for quite a while now, months, really, but I’ve held off on telling you guys.”
“Hey, Stark, once I’m in it, I’m in it.  You gotta love
It takes a minute but eventually his pulse settles and the tightness in his chest eases off.  He and Steve continue to breathe together well after the attack has passed, Tony reveling in the security of it.  He’s never seen Steve so focused outside of battle.
Tony sighs. The lukewarm reaction is not confidence-inspiring, but he isn’t sure if the film is to blame or if Steve is merely determined to be unhelpful.
Tony crosses to the fridge and grabs a bottle of water, needing a task to keep him from colorfully expressing his frustration.
Tony starts to move, small movements at first.  Steve tries to match him, unsure.
“Hate to argue, but it is a theme, and you’re missing some classic opportunities here.”  Clint holds up his fingers to start counting them off.  “Tom Hanks night-“
“I’m beginning to think I should be glad I missed the city in the 70s.”  Steve puts
Everything that has been so, so very wrong for weeks is suddenly very right.
Bucky looks through him now as if he’s not even here.  It’s odd to feel both impossibly huge and invisible at the same time.
“You want him in you?” Bucky asks Steve over Tony’s shoulder, breath panting hot against the inviting curve of Tony’s neck. “You want him to fuck you?” Bucky pulls at Tony’s dick, thumbing the head as he twists his wrist on the upward stroke. Tony shudders and groans but tries to focus on Steve through the intense wave of pleasure, tries to read his reaction to Bucky’s words. “
Tony watches her go, his brow slightly furrowed.  He couldn’t have heard what she’d said, but it’s obvious the kiss and the whisper have his interest piqued.
listener.”
It’s what he’s been trained to do and it’s the only way he can see his way through it.
He may as well have punched Steve in the face for the reaction he gets.  Steve’s visibly stunned; he stares at Tony for a long, hard moment, his wide blue eyes eventually narrowing and his open mouth closing into a frown.
“Apology accepted.  I woke up a while ago when Tony left anyway.  Now go get into some dry clothes and get some sleep, the movie can wait for another time.” She sighs to herself, running a hand through her strawberry blond hair.  “I sound like my mother.”
“Lead the way.” Steve tips his head in the direction of the hotel. The tunnel ahead isn’t pitch black; every twenty paces or so, a bare bulb emergency light fixture casts a small pool of light. But the Chateau is far enough away, the pathway disappearing around a curve to the left, that the exit is currently something to be imagined and not seen.
“You’re hungry?” Tony is honestly surprised over Steve’s question. That settles it for Steve right then; if Tony doesn’t have these types of nightmares himself, he’s at the very least been very close with someone who has.
“I happened to know your father, during the war.”
Bucky smiles against Steve’s neck, then pulls back to look down at him with a teasing grin.
“We’re on our way, Tony.” Steve assures him, jabbing his thumb impatiently against the up button.
“Then he
handsome, yet it’s more than that. He’ll never admit it aloud, but Coulson had been right about the man’s presence onscreen. It’s difficult not to instinctively follow his every move. He’s magnetic.
“That makes me want to suck you again,” Steve says, hand stroking down to grasp, and Bucky shudders again sharply with the overload of sensation. A weak spurt of come drips from his tip onto the couch cushion between Steve’s legs.
“Pep?”
been the one to make Steve’s fantasies a reality. He’s the one who got to make Steve fall apart in his arms while the rest of the world slept on.
Barnes nods.
“I’m sorry, Dr. Banner.” Steve apologizes sheepishly, which only makes Bruce chuckle.  “Spent a lotta of time in bed as a kid.  Not much to do besides read and play board games.”
“What the
“Hey.  I love that movie.”  Natasha pipes up, brandishing the tiny, flimsy carving blade at Tony.  She manages to make it seem incredibly threatening.
“I’ve spent the whole night trying desperately hard to be a grown-up.” Tony rocks a little on his heels, antsy as he explains himself.  “One more twenty year old model or Hollywood ingénue undressing you with their eyes and I might have lost the battle.  I was about to grab some starlet’s bright red lipstick and write
He knows Tony wouldn’t like that.
“Probably,” Tony agrees. He lets himself be guided back in the direction of Washington Square.
“Buck.” Steve calls out softly, and his door is immediately thrown all the way open. Bucky is livid, his cheeks ashen and his pupils so constricted that his eyes seem only a pale, icy blue.
“So you don’t like it.”
“I liked the dog too, Thor.”  Steve smiles reassuringly.
They wind up close enough to one another that he can hear the man’s stunned gasp and heavy breathing when he stops the thrown shield cold, catching it solidly in one hand.  He stares, getting a long good look at the other man, and it’s suddenly hard for him to breathe as well.
“You’re the first to say so, Stark.  Stevie usually tells me to put a lid on it.”
“We stopped.  And then he asked for Natasha.”
He digs out his leather wallet and puts down a couple of bills for his drink. Nick swipes the money up and hands it back to him. Steve starts to protest but Nick shoots him down with flat stare.
But Tony’s got this. Bucky knows Tony will hurry Steve back inside in a moment and cuddle him up on the couch. Tony will explain that whatever occurred between him and Bucky just now was nothing for Steve to worry about.
“I’m sorry.”  Barnes says again.  “I didn’t know.”
Steve doesn’t say anything about it.  He doesn’t answer Tony’s question either.
everything.
He’s glad that Pepper and Tony have remained amicable, as he knows that SI demands much of both their time.   Steve’s not exactly jealous, but any hours Tony spends with her always pass by slower than they should.  Perhaps Pepper thought that including him would help.
“You’re welcome, fancypants,” Tony pipes over the comm, doing a quick victory swirl around Clint before jetting upward to get another full aerial view of the pieces at play.  From what he can gather, the creatures seem to have some kind of breathing apparatus over their faces, like gas masks with hoses running down to canisters on their belts.  The most important piece of that observation is that hitting those canisters makes them explode, something that Natasha has picked up on and is using to her advantage.
He doesn’t know whose sick, twisted thought it is to kill Tony when he’s underneath Steve in their bed. How he wants to kill Tony just as he comes, to see his eyes go from hazy with lust to glassy and dull, to see the life drain out of him just at the moment he thought he had it all.
*******
“Well I love Italian clothing and I
“So, you’re
with you?” Pepper hisses as she catches up to him, stopping at his side and putting a tight hand on his elbow, manicured fingernails digging into his arm. “You’re being rude, and you can’t just go wandering off. Do you want this deal or not?”
He sets the pan down with a defeated sigh.
“Be right back, stay there a sec,” Tony holds up a finger and then leaves the room quickly. He returns a moment later with one of the hotel’s fluffy white robes in hand. The robe Tony is wearing is maroon and black silk, so he clearly must have brought it from home.
Tony puts his hand on Steve’s hip but the intense pull between them has snapped and broken. The light, whatever it was, had given Steve a beat to come to his senses and even in the relative darkness, on Steve’s face Tony can see rational thought winning out over desire.
“Well.” Bucky crosses his arms over his chest, and for a moment Steve thinks he’s actually angry at this lie of omission. “Guess you’re caught out, pal - you owe me a dollar.” Steve’s brow furrows, it taking him a moment to remember the wager from so long ago. Bucky shakes his head, scoffing at Steve’s incorrect prediction. “You said we’d never even meet the man, and here you are with an engraved personal invitation to his office.”
For whatever reason, Tony has stubbornly set his mind to Steve in a starring role in whatever this picture is that he’s got lined up. Steve can’t say he entirely understands that, but he does understand that someone rich and powerful like Tony is probably used to getting what he wants.
“Oh for christ’s sake.”  Tony mumbles.  “Just one time I’d like to ask where Steve is and have someone tell me he’s watching reality TV in bed like the rest of the human race.”
“Uh, no one, Tony. This is only stuff I mess around with. I’m not…”
“It’s a minor continuity issue. Both the suits read almost the same in black and white anyway, and maybe you brushed your hair when you went off screen? Who knows? Let those imaginations fill in the blanks. Honestly, I think it’ll escape most folks’ notice.”
She manages to stand and walk toward the door, heels dangling from one finger.
“I don’t even know what happened.”
“No, Tony.  I can see it all over you.  Everyone can.  I’m okay with twelve percent of a building; I can’t make do with twelve percent of your heart.”
“It certainly feels nice, I've never owned anything like it –” Jan's light laugh interrupts him. She comes back to his side, tugging him down off the stool.
Steve cries out as he comes first, powerful and messy all over his stomach and chest. His whole body tightens, pulling Bucky closer to him, further into him, and he can feel his insides clench around Bucky, so hard and hot inside him, and then the pulse and shudder deep within as Steve wrenches a long, drawn out orgasm from Bucky. He’s never quite sure if it’s his active imagination or a real sensation, but he swears he feels the wetness and heat of Bucky emptying a load inside of him; he is sure, however, that he feels it when Bucky fucks him through it, come seeping out and catching in Bucky’s pubic hair and dripping down his thighs.
“Usually takes you all night to get through one of these, Rogers. Now you’re on to number three.” He puts the dirty glass in the sink and picks up another tumbler from the rows of clean ones lined up like obedient soldiers in front of him. He flips it in his hand once as he continues to watch Steve carefully.
“Thor’s not annoying,” Steve replies, knowing Tony doesn’t mean what he says.
Tony is smiling at him mischievously when Peter finally meets his eyes.
There’s a knock at the open doorway, and they both turn to find Natasha standing there, amused. She looks pointedly at Steve in his state of half-undress and then at Bucky, still holding Steve’s clothes in his hand.
So that someone can’t stand in the shadows and stare at you for a good long while before you even realize you have company.
“Tony wanted to bring everything from your place over, but Tasha told him not to jump the gun.”  Clint leans against the kitchen counter, watching Steve take it all in.  “But you should have everything you need to get by for now.  Y’know, soap and underwear and all the boring day-to-day stuff.  Pepper set you up before she left.”
“You know I want to. But I have to be on set at seven a.m. on Monday.”
“I know what you’re worth, I’ll hold out for a better offer.” Steve glances back over his shoulder at Tony and half-smiles crookedly, a tentative thing that seems to eke out despite his efforts to hold it back. Tony practically melts even at that timid, barely-there reaction.
He cries for everything he’s refused to cry for.  Everything he denied and repressed because he had needed to be strong and he hadn’t a choice.  He can stop pretending now, at least for this moment.
“I don’t understand how this man attracts all these dames.”
When Steve doesn’t answer, instead looking away, Tony sets his glass down.
in the future.  Apparently it'd really punch up the scene where Hamlet confronts his father's ghost."
“The lovebirds have reconciled?” Thor asks, gesturing between the pair and Natasha shrugs, shaking off James’ touch and fixing her black pork pie hat that he’d jostled askew.  “Or perhaps not.”
“It’s okay…” Bucky says comfortingly. He regrets it when he hears Steve suck in a sharp inhale. It’s a different sound than before. Steve bites his lip and keeps his eyes shut as tightly as he can, clearly fighting back tears of frustration and pain.
“And Sam’s birds chirping at five in the morning,” Clint says.
He follows the Red Car line back to West Hollywood, the streets considerably more lively as the early birds start going out for breakfast, begin heading in to work. All the nightclubs and restaurants on Sunset look sad in the morning, however, drab without their lights dazzling, and their sidewalks dirty from revels the night before.
“Yet.”  Tony echoes, as if pointing out there’s plenty of time left to learn.  Steve tilts his head to look at him and finds Tony staring right back, directly into his eyes like he’d just been waiting for Steve to turn to face him.  Tony’s eyes are wide and dark and unblinking, his expression soft, maybe even fond.  The breeze rustles gently through Tony’s dark hair and Steve curls his fingers around the wooden railing to keep himself from touching.
“Is everything a good answer?”
,” Bucky clambers up, pulling Steve to him. Steve tries to force his heart back down from this throat as Bucky’s hands cradle his face, tilting his head up toward his own. The expression Steve finds there is earnest and slightly worried. “That’s not what I…I only meant we need to be realistic.”
and you’re probably going to cry.”
“If this is the part where you suggest Russian Mob again, Stark, I may have to castrate you.  I’m not connected, I have no relatives in Little Odessa, I just happen to be a popular person.” She adjusts her black and white polka dot circle skirt, checks the seam of her red stockings with an imperious, distracted air.
and that makes this hard –
“No.”  Steve shakes his head.  “Please don’t stop.”
“Try to keep me from doing anything too stupid, okay?” He knows it’s pretty silly to ask an AI for that, but a polite reminder from time to time to keep his cool might be good if he’s really going to make a go of staying here.
“Not quite.
“Well this guest will have it on the rocks, then.”  He retreats to the living room and sits down on the arm of the loveseat, watching from a distance as Steve clinks cubes into the glass, uncaps the bottle and pours.  The apartment falls near silent.  Tony can hear the subway rattling somewhere close by.   It makes the floor vibrate.
“Yeah...something like that,” Bruce replies, his smile wistful and sad.  The door to the lab slides open with a burst of air and Pepper walks in, a bag from a nearby deli in her hand.  She looks between the two men, registering the slowly ebbing tension between them, and then sets the bag down next to the untouched breakfast she’d given Tony that morning.
.” Rhodey says pointedly, glaring at Tony in emphasis. Tony ticks his gaze from Jim to Carol, who has suspiciously found a place on the ceiling very interesting to stare at. It's entirely unlike her to avoid looking him in the eyes.
“Ok, playtime later.”
“Try growing up in the
It only reminds Tony of the cold hard truth – he and Bruce aren’t soldiers.  They weren’t ready for any of what happened to them.
Steve bites back a comment.
Natasha pads back to the bedroom and as soon as the door closes, Pepper turns to him.
“There’s more to it, but we can leave the Roger Ebert impressions for later.”
in her.”
, because he knows Tony left uneasy and wouldn’t have returned this self-assured if he hadn’t been eavesdropping.  He pauses, and Tony keeps going a few paces before realizing Steve has stopped.  Tony circles and backtracks.
.  “What did you draw?”
Perhaps time really had been slowing down.
“The kind of person who would stay with me out of duty, even if you would rather be with Barnes.” Tony replies without even thinking about it, the truth simply
Steve starts for Tony’s dark blue Coupe de Ville, making like he’s going to toss the keys to Tony so he can re-claim the wheel. Before Steve can throw them or make to cross the highway to the car, Tony stops and gestures down the road.
“So sorry, please come in.  Sorry.  Pepper, let me take your coat.”  He assists her in taking it off and then stands there stupidly holding it over his arm.  Pepper is in business attire, white blouse, black pencil skirt, like she’s just come from the office.  He hadn’t known she was in town, but then again, these days why would he.  Darkly, he wonders if she and Tony have reconciled.  He reminds himself quickly that it shouldn’t matter.  He has no claim to Tony – he’s not even sure he wants one – and Tony’s made it pretty clear that their friendship has severe limitations.
“Dammit, Steve, it’s Pepper.” A tear escapes, slipping down her cheek even as she laughs.  She quickly brushes it away.  It’s Steve who steps forward, concerned.  He takes her elbows, pulling her into a half embrace and earnestly meeting her gaze.
Pepper sighs.  Tony can practically hear her frowning over the line.  He crosses the litter-strewn parking lot and jaywalks across the nearly empty street, the sign of the Motel 6 a thoroughly depressing beacon.
worried.” Tony stares at him, desperately wishing he could better see his face, but Bucky only shrugs slightly.
“You’re not late at all, Tony. Our meeting is at noon.” Pepper smiles, looking slightly pleased with herself. Tony looks at his watch, seeing that he has a full hour before he’s expected at Paramount.
“I know you’d rather just move to the Village, but you know I can’t afford-“
Any hurt he incurred from the encounter with Captain America on the SHIELD helicarrier has faded, despite the serious nature of some of the injuries. The only history written on this body is the history of James Buchanan Barnes, and this is enough to convince him that he had, at the very least, been this man once upon a time.
“Like…for Superman?  Batman?” Tony finally prompts, proud of himself for sounding genuinely interested rather than mocking.  His default tone can sometimes be read as mocking.  Or so he’s been told.  Numerous times, by many, many different people.
“And?” Steve prompts, bending down out of sight to pull on his trousers. When he comes back up, Tony still hasn't answered. “If you're regretting casting me, I can only say I told you so.”
on this girl…”
Bucky is sweating profusely – though it’s more like glistening, that lucky fuck – and his long brown hair hangs in his face as he looks down at Steve, blocking his expression from Tony’s view. Steve looks back at Bucky with something nearing reverence, and Tony can only imagine an equal amount of desire and love on Bucky’s face.  But Steve’s a pleasure to look at for now, no imagination necessary. Steve’s mouth is bitten and kiss-swollen, his pink lips slightly parted as he gasps out labored breaths that are probably shaky from excitement and not exertion.  His usually pale cheeks are rosy, his blue eyes blown dark with arousal beneath his lush, long eyelashes.
Steve takes out the small piece of white paper stock, bent and folded and wrinkled and worn around the edges. He’s taken it out every night and considered just throwing it away, but he always places it on his night table instead, where it stays until he dresses the next morning.
He waits until Steve’s well and gone before snapping a reproachful glare Bucky’s way.
“Yeah.  We are.”
He doesn’t have to pretend he doesn’t feel this. Not anymore.
“It’s been a long week. Everyone has them, now and again, even me,” He reasons, but Nick doesn’t look at all convinced.
“It was fine,” Steve mumbles, looking down. “I made Italian. We listened to some music, played cards, drank some wine.”
“It’s not really in the budget, Mr. Stark,” Coulson pipes up from the shadows in the rear of the room. Tony hadn’t even realized he was here. The man has such a meek, unassuming presence; he tends to blend in with the walls most times. “We’ve already done two rounds. We’ve got to find a girl for the part soon.”
“Steve, thank you for coming,” Tony manages to get out a greeting, aiming for a cheerful nonchalance but the words coming out strained. He walks around the edge of the pool to close some of the space between them.
“It’ll be like
“It’s okay, Tony.”  Steve’s smile is sad and half-hearted, now.  “I know what they used me for after I was gone.  Heck, there were comics and film reels and all that before – I was part of it.  I knew what they were using me for back when I was alive.”
Tony looks at him hungrily, and Steve’s sure that same hunger is mirrored in his own expression.
“Not always about who packs the most punch when it comes to a fight,” Steve replies a bit sheepishly.  “Gotta be quick on your feet and outthink your opponent.  I’m sure I have as much to learn from you or Natasha as I would from Thor or Dr. Banner.”
“ – but Jane, you certainly recall –”
“Tony?”  His voice is even worse now, hoarse from disuse and wrecked from his crying.  Bucky turns toward the doorway as well, taking the sight of Tony in.  He looks wretched, unshaven and unkempt.   Downright wan and gaunt.  Steve wonders if he’s been drinking.
“I’m surprised you didn’t figure a way around that,” Steve replies and Tony looks contemplative.
“Take her out for a spin, Steve-o, I’m sure she’s sick of me.”
right now, and I’m fine with that, and Bucky knows I’m fine with that.”
Tony pauses, imagining this in his head and trying to decide if the prospect of it angers or excites him.
“I love you.” Tony whispers desperately against Steve’s lips, not giving Steve time to reply before kissing him again. Steve makes a small noise like a whimper and starts to pull back, but Tony chases his lips.
Rhodey thuds his head against the metal a couple of times before rolling to look back at Tony. “I should really
“Who are you?”  Steve finally gets the words out articulately, and this time she hears him.
“And you made the guy working the counter at the bodega ‘round the corner too, right?”
all the way down here?”
“Buck…” Steve groans, and Tony palms his own hard on through his jeans, feeling it twitch as it presses up urgently and uncomfortably against his zipper.  Steve moves his hands from Bucky’s ass, sliding smoothly up his back and around to his chest. His broad palms cover Bucky’s pecs and come to rest there as Bucky continues to rock over him. Steve looks up to Bucky’s face, then back to Bucky’s cock, then back to his face, and repeats the pattern again, gauging Bucky’s reactions to every single thrust.
Bucky straightens his spine and blinks away the tears.
There’s a physics textbook on the coffee table that piques his interest; it’s spread open and there’s writing along the margins, a cramped scrawl that he recognizes as Bruce’s.  There’s also a notebook next to it and the perfectly elegant old-fashioned handwriting on its pages is very much Steve’s.
"The line's actually 'You
And Steve loves him back.
“Yeah, it may not be pretty but it’s functional, and it’s where we’re going.” Fury cuts Hill off.  “It’s already been re-tasked this way.  Should be here within the hour.  Secure Barnes and then attend to your injuries.” Fury hobbles toward the door, dragging his leg behind him and gritting his teeth through the pain.
, that you just happen to have
“We’d have ironclad excuses to be around each other. No one would suspect a thing.”
“Of course, Mr. Stark. If you and the gentleman would like to follow me, I’d be happy to arrange that for you.” He catches someone’s eye across the crowded dining room and nods once, then a moment later once again.
They are near enough to one another that Tony can feel Steve’s body warm behind his, hear his quiet breathing as they move silently down the long hall. It’s not enough. He wants to look back over his shoulder and make sure of the other man’s presence, to gaze directly into those captivating blue eyes, but he’s afraid that Steve will disappear like Eurydice in the Underworld.
Tony presses his other hand flat to Steve’s stomach, feeling his steady breathing, and knows in just a moment he’ll feel it pick up under his palm.
.” Steve insists, trying not to be bothered by Tony’s harsh judgment. “Face it, Tony – Paramount’s renting you the space, the equipment…and they’re giving you the shittiest, oldest stuff they have, just because they know you don’t have a choice here. Lang’s doing the best he can with what he has to work with.”
Steve tries to adjust a falling tendril of hair curling over Alice’s shoulder, but he can’t get the feel of it right.  His whole drawing is too clunky and too tight.  If the sculptor could somehow make the metal flow and come alive, he should be able to create the illusion with pencil on paper far more easily.
.  I had a bunk with a straw mattress, and a duffel bag.  On a
He opens his mouth to tell the guys that he’ll be back shortly with what they need, but their discussion of Dum Dum’s indiscretions has escalated into a good-natured argument over who has made the biggest romantic blunders in the past. Each is sure one of the others has made far more embarrassing mistakes.
“I’m never wrong.”
Steve shudders when Tony repeats the action.
“Just wanted to point out, Boss, that you do
“Kinda figured it’d be a sore subject.”
The room is dark except for the faint moonlight drifting in through the tall, wide windows. After allowing a moment for his eyes to adjust, Tony can make out Steve’s slight form lying on the bed, tucked under the sheets and comforter, laying on his right side with his back to the bedroom door. He takes up so much less space than he used to, the California King mattress so unnecessary for his 5’4” frame. Tony tries to listen to Steve’s breathing to see if he’s asleep or not but he can’t tell from halfway across the room.
He’s shaking as he packs up his rifle.
“Steven is of the most modest sort!”  Thor’s broad palm lands on his shoulder.  “My father would hold him in the highest regard, for humility is a quality upon which he places great value.”
That perhaps sounded more bitter than he intended to let on.
“Yes, don’t sound so surprised.” Tony frowns. “Just some kid who came to me begging for a job last week. Claims to be a genius, though I have yet to see evidence of it. Bit of a wiseass.”
Tony’s phone starts buzzing.  He hears it, but he can’t process the information, all he can think about is those six words Pepper just spoke, turning over and over in his head.  He stares at Pepper, who stares back.  The buzzing stops, but quickly begins again.  Someone clearly wants to get a hold of him.
“I am not burning the
” Bucky interjects tersely.  Steve’s eyes snap back open and he blinks at Bucky, confused.
relationship advice.” Tony sits down on a packing crate and leans back lazily, looking up at Rhodey with a triumphant smirk.
“I mean, you keep saying it won’t work ’cause of the whole race thing, but come on – she was a damned WASP, you really think she’d back down from the challenge? Pretty sure she’d tell society at large to screw off if only you asked her to.”
“Hi, Steve.  We’re so sorry to drop by unannounced, but we were in the neighborhood.  I hope you’ll forgive our intrusion?”
Around floor twenty-five, Natasha breaks the silence.
“Even so.”
He can’t help cringing a little and he offers her a hand up before he can think better of it.
“Yeah, aren’t you glad I kept it to myself?”
He can also drink every one one of them under the table. That hasn’t stopped Clint and Bucky from trying, though it's only Natasha who really stands a chance. She may be slender and petite, but she’s got a stalwart constitution worthy of her Russian roots.
“Jesus Christ,” Tony mutters to himself, yanking down his zipper hurriedly and pulling himself out with shaking hands.  He’s going to come right here, from nothing but watching them fuck.
When Steve picks up the menu, Tony promptly takes it from his hands and sets it aside.  Even though he’s feeling hungry for the first time all day, Tony orders them nothing but drinks – two for him to every one for Tony – and demands that he down them as soon as they arrive at the table.
“It doesn’t matter if you
Control just as quickly shifts to Steve as soon as the door slams shut. Steve holds him against it, mouth on his and his hands roaming everywhere. His long fingers and broad palms slip through Tony’s hair, slide down his arms, smooth over his chest, before finally settling to work at the latch of his belt.
“Talk about what.”
“Being a consultant is hardly dangerous, and leaves plenty of time for me to save the world in other ways, like my awesome clean energy projects – cars are next, wait till you see the prototypes my guys are workin’ on.” Tony almost goes off on a tangent, sharing his plans with Bruce an exciting diversion, but manages to rein himself in and keep on task.  “Besides, I like the idea of bankrolling you guys, making you all neat toys and awesomely amazing uniforms.  I’m Charlie and you’re my Angels.”
“Get in.”  He clicks his jaw tensely as he pops the door and nods his head toward the inside of the car.  Steve hesitates, having a bad feeling about where this is all heading.  He wishes Tony would look at him but the other man keeps his gaze fixedly elsewhere.  Steve brushes past him and climbs into the car.
“Tony, I don’t want to be rude, but I really have no idea what I’m doing here.”
“I’m not really yours,” Tony recalls Bucky’s earlier words. “And you’re not mine.”
” He croons.
“A for effort, Thor.” Tony points to him in recognition.  “But honestly, folks,
Steve has to admit, he kind of likes it.
Maybe he has before, maybe he hasn’t.  There’s never anything before
Steve lets out a deeper, longer exhale as his eyes flutter open, letting Tony know without words that he’s awake.
“You need to go to him.” Is what she says. All she says. She sits in the non-functional kitchen of his rundown squat and stares at him like she’s the one who is owed an explanation.
“I’d give you a penny for your thoughts if I thought you’d take it.”
“Really, Rhodey?” Tony jumps up from his seat at the grand piano and crosses toward Jim and Carol, who had entered the parlor side by side, holding hands. “Carol! Finally?”
Tony waves him off.
“Wipe him and start over.”
.”  Clint suddenly vaults over the back of the couch, landing on the empty couch cushion between him and Tony.  Steve barely manages not to yelp in surprise.
“Told her what?”
“No I don’t, sir!”
Something tells him no.
a coward for turning it down – too afraid of going back, too afraid of life in the spotlight, and maybe too afraid to wrap his future so closely up with Tony’s, when all is said and done.
“We don’t have another minute, Tony.” He lifts his arm to look at his own watch, frowning. “Someone will come knocking any second now.”
Tony pulls up the chair, taking off his suit coat and throwing it over the back. He rolls up his shirtsleeves and unlatches his wristwatch, casting it off to the side.
across your chest.”
“Tony…”
Tony looks at him, eyes narrowing.
But he had, because Steve is decent and patient – and above all, professional, which is what this meeting is supposedly about. Tony had taken that tack on purpose, afraid that Steve would have a totally reasonable out if Tony asked him up for personal reasons. Instead, he’s requested Steve come for a viewing of the latest rough cut of the film so that they could discuss the new ending.
“I don’t think I
“You want me to watch?” Tony mouths over his stomach. “Watch the two of you together?”
Steve’s lips part in a silent moan, legs spreading and hips arching as Tony wraps fingers around his cock.  His length swells further in Tony’s loose grasp and it gives Tony a powerful, heady feeling that nearly makes him dizzy.
“You didn’t even tell me you had a meeting with him. Since when do you keep secrets?” Bucky runs his hand through his hair, clearly exasperated. Steve's getting there himself.
“Can’t get drunk; there is a difference,” Steve corrects, a slight smile breaking his stoic expression.  For a moment Tony thinks he might be pleased with this turn of events, but Steve backs away from the edge of comfortable familiarity as quickly as he approached it.  “This isn’t for me though.  My mother always said to be prepared to entertain guests.”
“Where’s Steve?”  She asks over the music.
go unsaid.
He can tell Natasha almost anything.
He’s found over the years that it’s all well and good to be designing and building the sets, but when it comes to dressing them, he’s better off keeping his opinions to himself. He hasn’t come across a team yet that doesn’t resent his two cents.
“Between you and Wilson, I’m running out of avian-related ammo.  If you want original insults, get a more original name.”
Steve cups the side of his face with one hand, thumb brushing over his cheek.  The other falls to Tony’s waist, steady and firm, not pushing but guiding Tony closer.
“That’s a very nice thought, Miss Van Dyne. Perhaps –“
“What?” Steve is too caught off guard by Tony actually speaking to him to process the question.
?” Steve asks. He crosses his arms over his chest, but pulling in protectively rather than aggressively standing tall. “Tony, this morning…”
“I think it’s highly probable that every time Captain America even
*******
“I don’t, really.”  Tony’s gaze travels pointedly down to the cigarette still clasped between his fingers.  Steve’s first instinct is to stub it out but he resists, feeling like it would just be a capitulation to Tony’s judgment.  “Did you need something?”
“My housemates have challenged me to a beard contest!  They are obviously fools.”
“Drew for the comics, mainly.”  Steve’s already blushing; Tony’s reaction is apparently a foregone conclusion.  If only to remain unpredictable, Tony bites back the quip that’s on the tip of his tongue and merely nods, turning the thought over in his mind a few times before speaking.  Steve seems surprised by the momentary silence.
“What?  BOOM.”  Sam makes an exploding motion, signaling the back of his head blowing out from sheer shock.  “I don’t know if I can look her in the eyes anymore.  She’s gonna know I
“That’s precisely what I mean.  I don’t usually get comfortable.  Settling in doesn’t exactly agree with me.”
“Take him again.”
“Tony—” Steve tenses up in his embrace, and Tony knows he’s only got a moment to get this out before it all goes sideways. He holds Steve close, trying to tell him with his actions that he’s not going anywhere, no matter how Steve answers what’s next.
“You’re always tryin’ to talk me out of things you talked me into in the first place – you realize that?”
The only sound in the room is their kissing, their heavy breathing. Tony feels like they are the last two people in the entire world. They might as well be, because in this moment Steve is all there is.
“Picasso’s a famous artist,” Sam chips in before Thor can ask.  Thor nods, stroking his beard as he mulls over this new information.
“What is this one, is this stereoscopic? Interesting, very interesting. 3D film tech really could use some improvements, or it’s never gonna catch on. I mean, over twenty years and still no one can quite make it easy or cheap enough to use in
Someday, Tony will pleasure Steve in front of a mirror – double-wide, full length, maybe three-way – just to make Steve watch how devastatingly gorgeous his body is, how immaculate.  He’ll show him that there’s more to his physical perfection than duty and obligation; that there are things meant for only Steve’s personal benefit.
“Dr. Ross…”
. It was only a stupid
“Tony…” Pepper sighs, as if there’s something he still doesn’t understand.  “You didn’t fall in love with him.”
“Certainly, sir.”
“What if it doesn’t work out?”
“But you are both from New York, are you not?” Steve snorts over Thor’s question; the man has a point.
type of relationship.  He’d nearly melted down when they finally moved in together, even after Steve had waited for Tony to suggest the idea on his own.
“He did.  And I think the two of you need to stop talking to everyone else and talk to each other.”
“Good.  Thank you.”  She nods once, satisfied, and leaves his side abruptly.  Tony shakes off the strange, unsettled feeling that he’s left with, and plasters a grin on his face.
“And he just…gave you his number.” Steve can hear the suspicion in Bucky’s voice.
It does smell like rain in the air. He wants to take Steve to bed and make love to him as water and wind thrashes and rattles the glass of his bedroom windows, as the waves churn below and thunder and lightning rages across the sky. He wants nothing but Steve’s warm skin against his as they become a tangle of limbs, as he makes Steve fall apart under his hands and mouth, his cries swallowed by the squall outside.
Tony doesn’t know what Barnes wants him to do here.  He’s not about to explain his reasoning to the man.  So he shrugs, takes the sketchbook Steve shoved at him and sets it aside.  There’s not much to say, so he just gives the version of the truth that seems the most obvious.
He’s glad to see her and he lets himself feel it, tired of being angry about things that aren’t really her fault.  Nat can’t help that Bucky remembers kissing her, holding her, loving
“Here…” Steve gets his hands on the hem of Bucky’s tee and pulls up. Bucky takes it over his head as Steve immediately goes to the buckle of Bucky’s belt, and then the button and zipper of his jeans. Bucky tries to start undressing him and return to kissing him at the same time, and the result is a uncoordinated tangle of arms and legs, noses bumping and teeth clacking as they both focus on doing too many things to be competent at any of them.
“That’s not at all-“
“That’s just not true.”
Not strong enough, however, to stop him from making scrambled eggs and serving them up like he’s Steve’s personal June Cleaver.  He says as much to Steve as he’s plating everything and gets a blank look in return.
JARVIS increases power to the thrusters without being told.
“We showed.  The last message I got from Hill, she was in Fury’s communications room.”  Tony points down the hall and Clint and Natasha file behind him.  If there are any enemy fighters left, he’s better equipped to take the hit.
“Right,” Tony snorts.  “And I’m the Easter Bunny.”
“Only because I first knew her as Natalie, Pepper’s assistant, and
“This is too big a deal for you, and for Stark Pictures. And I know you know that, so why –?”
“Uh, isn’t that kind of what you do?” Tony narrows his eyes at Bruce, lowering his phone for a moment.  “You haven’t stayed in one place for more than –”
So he watches from afar as Steve and Tony fight with words at the farmhouse and fight with fists at the Tower. He watches as they fight together in Sokovia, and as they make up and part ways in the aftermath.
He’s been told “real” New Yorkers now avoid Times Square like the plague, so he supposes he might still fit in here after all.
“That’s the spirit, Mr. Stark,” Maria replies dryly. Tony finally shoots her a look over his shoulder, tilting his head down to look at her over the rim of his wire frame glasses.
“Very.” Bucky agrees, setting his work bag down on the couch and tossing his suit coat over it. Steve winces, wishing Bucky would be less messy and informal when they have company, but Bucky doesn’t seem to notice or care. “And what are we having for dinner,
girl for the part soon, Phil. The
assumed.” Tony seems perturbed for a moment, but shakes it off. “He’s back in cryo anyway.”
Steve hears Natasha’s flat greeting from the kitchen and he quickly takes his pan of eggs off the stove, flipping the burner off.  In the living room he finds Pepper standing rigid just inside the doorway, looking at Natasha with obvious surprise.
He wraps his arms around Steve from behind, burying his face against his back and breathing in turpentine and sweat.
On the Tuesday morning after his return to the tower, he enters the studio to find Tony already there, studying the hologram with an interested look on his face.
He can scarcely believe Bucky is before him now, gazing down at him like
He once found New York, with its deep, stretching canyons and glorious noise, to be the fast-moving, fast-thinking kind of place that he could plug right into.  He could become one with the hustle and bustle and the near-electric flow of traffic and people.  As a child, he’d escape the elegant, cordoned off existence of his parents’ Fifth Avenue life and run the streets, ride the subways, eager to explore the nooks and crannies of the too-tiny yet endless island.
“You know, if we’d skipped brunch, I could have come home right after yoga, all stretched and
“Burnt them, Steve.  She burnt-“
The door falls gently closed, taking the noise of the nightclub with it, and Steve is left with the soundtrack of the city as somewhere a clock chimes eleven. Further in the distance, there is a mournful wail of police sirens.
“Hill mentioned Barnes – is that what this is about?” Tony asks as they move.  He should be out front but he doesn’t know his way around this place like Clint and Natasha do.  He stays between them, weapons at the ready.
“Where’s Stark been?” Sam inquires. He signals something to Nick and then stands up, tugging Steve’s sleeve. “Come on, let’s get away from the bar.” He leads Steve over to one of the booths that recently opened toward the back, the table not even clean yet. Since Sam works here, he doesn’t much care. He pushes the used glassware to the end of the table and slides in along the red leather seat. Steve sinks down across from him, his body like lead weight. He doesn’t know why they had to move from his spot at the bar, but he’s too tired to argue.
Apparently Tony’s got the market on tumult cornered.
“Barnes,” he mumbles, struggling to remain conscious.
For some reason, this makes Tony rock with laughter.  Steve doesn’t quite get why; it’s merely an honest observation.   Tony laughs loud enough that Steve’s newly adopted cat, Fiorello, stirs from sleeping on his favorite place – Steve’s stomach – and, after shooting Tony a thoroughly pissed off look, digs his claws into Steve’s side as he launches himself from the couch.
They drag themselves out of the pond and sit on its edge, legs dangling in the water.
“I am under no obligation to make your snooping easier for you.  It’s not my fault Fury downgraded your clearance level.”
“Jimmy here is more fun than you, Stevie,” she coos, and then leans toward Bucky in a jokingly confidential aside. “That boy over there blushes if you even
“I admire the way you barely conceal your disdain for me, Miss Hill. It’s refreshing.”
His awkward silence must speak louder than words.
Bucky’s eyes are bright and his color high. His tie is loose, the top button of his collar undone. His pint glass is once again empty in his hand. Beside him, Natasha is cradling a snifter of brandy, her full lips playing at a smirk as she surveys the men surrounding her table. Her dark red hair falls in perfect tight curls and her black, bead-encrusted dress hugs her curves. She looks every inch a silver screen starlet, and Steve suspects most everyone here would be surprised to discover she spends her days bent over a typewriter, entirely away from public view.
"Tony, now it sounds like you're courting me." Steve teases.
“He’s not ready to face you, Steve.”  Natasha’s voice is soft.  She sets a gentle hand on his shoulder.  “Give him time.”
“Well.”  Bucky doesn’t argue, though it seems he may want to.  “It’s just so we’re clear.  I have your back.”
Surprisingly, Tony doesn’t snap anything back.  He just leaves.
Tony changed something between them, just now, and Steve doesn’t even know how.
“I found this place, should be perfect for you.  Lots of lovely dames, it’ll be like swingin’ at the Savoy.”  Tony explains happily, gesturing for Steve to lead the way in.  Steve hesitates, debating about whether or not he should go along with this to make Tony happy, because the man’s clearly trying and he doesn’t want to be rude, not after all Tony’s done for him the past few days…
“If you weren’t injured, I’d elbow you in the gut right now.”  Natasha mumbles, keeping her eyes closed.  A small smile curves her lips though, her amusement creeping through.
“Worship beauty?” Tony supplies, smirking.  “That’s a religion of its own, Cap, especially in this city.”
, for a while.  Steve decides not to quibble over the logic with Tony.  “It was incredibly sweet of you to play matchmaker.”
“Steve, turn over, turn over.” Bucky’s voice is shaky. Tony doesn’t want Steve to move; he wants Steve to lay there on his back and let him run his hands through the streaks of come, rub it all into Steve’s skin. Tony wants to claim him.
Steve swallows around the words in his throat, pausing to re-evaluate. Bucky fills the silence.
“Blocking up patio walls at B-Bar…”
Tony remains silent beside him, but Bucky can hear him breathing, slowly, in and out, like he’s purposefully measuring them out.
“What, I work for you now?”
“Let's just say his best friend found out and he wasn't as open-minded as you, and leave it at that, shall we?” Tony lets his hands rest on the keys, the sound faint and discordant.
“Tony…he’s a good guy.  Really.”
“How many times what?”
“I told him I was in set design; he mentioned possibly having some work for me.” It’s not exactly a lie; Tony might instead be interested in him as an actor, but he
Steve raps on Bucky’s door softly, his heart in his throat.
The grass is damp under his bare feet and he can see Tony slipping and sliding, bobbing in and out of view beside him as the man struggles to keep up.  Tony falls behind as he toddles awkwardly, the blanket he has wrapped around himself restricting his pace.
Tony purposefully bumps into Steve’s shoulder as he walks to the sink and angrily slams on the tap. Steve watches him for a long moment, wondering now if the shoe had been on the other foot, if Loki had cornered Tony instead of him, would Tony have done it? Would Tony think he was worth that?
He shoves his hands in his pockets and, as he turns to go back into his trailer, kicks at a stray pebble on the pavement.
“What are you so happy about?”  Steve asks, tired but curious.  Considering Bruce is passed out in the back after days of flipping personalities, Sam’s suit is good and busted and Clint hasn’t said two words since going into stoic post-battle mode, there logically isn’t much to smile over.  Even Thor is down, staring off into space pensively and wearing a stern frown usually reserved only for his brother.
He loves Pepper, he does, but sometimes he wishes she wasn’t so willing to say what’s on her mind.
“Don’t do this to me, Tony – you can’t say that and then leave me.” Steve murmurs against Tony’s mouth, half-plea, half-anger. His hands are pushing at Tony’s shoulders, fingers grasping at the fabric of his shirt, even as he continues to answer Tony’s kisses. Steve’s own body isn’t sure what it wants to be doing.
He wishes that they hadn’t checked their coats and hats; at least then he’d have better cover.
“Need your come inside me.”  Bucky finally reaches down, using his metal hand to strip his own cock at a punishing pace.  Steve makes a small noise, one that Tony can’t translate. “Fill me up, then I’ll ride your face. Lick me out and we can do it all again.”
“I also want my friend to be happy.”
goes unsaid and Steve knows that the implied reprimand should keep her from bringing it up again, if only because she’ll be so irked at his presumption that she then won’t want to talk to him either.  If he’s managing to bear the fact that Bucky wants to see only her, the least Natasha could do is let him deal with it how he deals with it.  He’s not interfering and he’s not criticizing, and that should damn well be enough.
“Fuck, Steve, I’m always going to
It took Tony to see it, to realize it, and even then it probably never would have happened if he hadn’t lost the serum. Staring in the mirror at his old self forced him to look long and hard at what exactly he’d left behind.
“Where do you want to go?” Steve hears himself ask, frankly impressed with how unaffected he manages to sound. Inside, he’s in tumult, emotions pulling him in one direction and then the other just as fast.
“I think so.  We could definitely do that.”
“Really?” Tony arches one eyebrow, a mischievous glint in his dark brown eyes.  He never looks as handsome as he does when he’s happy and up to no good.  “Well.  How about we get on outta here and I figure out other ways to stake my claim?”
“George Michael the pop star?”
“You might. If you knew who it was.”
, Steve, of course not. That’s not what this is about.”
“I do
“You just got him back in your life, Bucky.” She steps closer to him, the hard edge of her voice softening slightly. “I don’t know what’s going on, but if you keep acting like this when he needs you most –”
“He’s like I was, he can’t catch anything…give anything…” Steve explains, suddenly wishing he had expressly cleared that with Tony before foregoing the condoms. It’s true about Bucky, but there’s still the intimacy of it, and before this weekend Tony had been the only one ever to…
“It’s to sic the Star Spangled Man with a Plan on some international crisis.  No, I have no damsels in distress in need of saving, I simply wanted to check in.”
“You’re restless, I get it.”
They shift to lie down on the bed together, a tangled mess of limbs, and Tony drifts off to sleep with the sensation of Bucky stroking his back and Steve kissing his neck.
“Ok, so if it’s not your father that’s the problem, and the guy is apparently some kind of Adonis –”
“Director Fury!  Nick, can you hear me?”
“Did you formally rescind said invitation?”  Bruce inquires, taking his glasses out of his pocket and getting back to work as Tony backs toward the door and into the hallway.
“Natasha has a habit of doing this.” Steve shrugs slightly. He’s not happy about the turn the evening has taken, but he’s grown to expect it every now and again from his friends. Honestly, he
That part of him does not win.
“I’m not making it
“You loved me then?”
“That’s easy enough, because there’s really nowhere to go but forward.” Natasha leans her head on his shoulder, tucking one arm around his elbow. Steve turns his own head and buries his nose in Natasha’s hair, breathing in her warm, flowery smell. He presses a brotherly kiss to her temple and pats her hand.
“But she’s coming
“I can sometimes be an idiot,” Tony mumbles between kisses, lips laying a claim each time they connect with a new expanse of Steve’s warm skin.  “And I’m often an ass.”  Steve laughs, broken and breathless, as Tony moves his mouth down the defined center line of his chest and abs, tongue tracing a trail south.  Steve’s hand is in his hair, fingers threading loosely through the strands.  “But I’ve never been a fool.”
“Wait, that’s not okay?”  He puts a hand on Tony’s arm, stilling him.  He tries to act stunned.  “Is it just gay sex or all types of sex?”
Just then Steve walks into the room, grey t-shirt sticking to his damp chest and a towel wrapped around his waist.
“It’s fine,” Steve assures the three of them, brushing off the unspoken concern.
“It’s just one of those pointless decorative things that us billionaires have.  It has no actual use.  I wanted a full pool but the space back here wasn’t large enough.”
“What do you want from me?” Steve turns around to face him and Tony nearly collides with him.  Steve reaches out a hand to catch him as he wavers this time and Tony pauses, breathes out a pathetic little puff of air, and then looks up at him.
The words are pushed out of Tony’s mouth like it’s painful for Tony to even say them, and that in itself makes Steve bristle.
He has to scramble to turn the projector off before the reel runs out; rewinding is so much easier when you don’t have to feed the film back in again. He only turns on one set of overhead lights, keeping the room dim and intimate, before going back toward where Steve sits, waiting.
Yesterday, he and Sam were supposed to meet some of Sam’s friends for dinner at Red Rooster Harlem and then go to Amateur Night at the Apollo.  It was supposed to be a fun night out on the town.
His falling ceases abruptly and he’s moving upward.
“Firstly – it boggles my mind that you know who Lady Gaga is; secondly, who gave you an iPod if not me; and thirdly, why the radio at all then?”
“Where are we going, anyway?”  Bucky asks as they pile into the subway car.  It’s crowded, but not too crowded; it doesn’t stop Tony from pressing every inch of his body along Steve’s, hands fisting just below the stand collar of Steve’s unzipped grey moto jacket rather than grabbing one of the overhead handrails.
“By the way, you can drop that
“Coulson, you can put the rights to the character and his library up for sale. I don’t want this hanging around my neck.” Tony tugs at his tie, suddenly uncomfortable and feeling it too tightly at his throat.
He’s not aware of anything else but that empty doorway until Bruce sets a hand on his shoulder.
“So you listened to that whole conversation, didn’t you.”  Steve doesn’t really
“Go back to work,” Pepper near whispers, then spins on her heel and pushes the button to open the lab door.  “I’ll be upstairs if you need me.”
“I have had better days,” Tony admits without actually telling the truth. “But I’ll be fine.” Before Pepper offers more observations regarding his awful appearance, Tony presses on. “I’d like you to set up a meeting with Steve Rogers. You can do that, right? You said you had his information, or something?”
However, being in the same space as Tony but feeling miles away makes him feel even lonelier.  He looks up at the skeleton of the yet unfinished new Whitney Museum stretching high above the plaza and wishes he were almost anywhere else right now.
, that’s not what I –
“Is there anything I can do?” Betty inquires.
“I have my ways,” Tony shrugs.  “It took me longer than I’d imagined though.  You’re remarkably good at disappearing, Cap, to a pretty scary degree.  Did Nat give you tips?”
“In an indirect fashion, yes it does concern HYDRA.  But it encompasses something much larger.”
“Nice try, you minx, but no.” Tony won’t let himself be distracted. Steve’s not usually the type to sidestep the hard conversations, and he also doesn’t use sex as an avoidance tactic. Those used to be Tony’s go-to moves, however, so he can spot them all too easily with others. The fact that Steve would try this now only makes Tony all the more sure he needs to force this conversation before it builds into something more, something else.
“Darcy and I don’t exactly chat and it’s not like Tony’s
“Oh please, Pepper, stop,” Tony cuts her off.  He hates it when she chooses her words carefully, tiptoeing around him.  It’s always how he knows something is really worrying her, because usually she and Rhodey are the only ones to call him on his crap and if she’s hedging...
“Don’t want to talk about Natasha right now,” Steve mutters, twisting at something that Tony can tell didn’t need to be tightened.  He wonders if Steve has the faintest clue what he’s doing.  He bends down next to him, eyeing the machinery.  He pushes up his sleeves.
He hovers in front of Bucky for a moment more and then tilts his head, surveying the force field that blocks any of them from getting too close to the opening in the ground.
Steve shoves Loki back, but it’s too late.
The next time he’s jolted from sleep, a howling pain is surging through every inch of his body.  His muscles are wrenched tight and it feels like his skin is on fire.  He lifts his head and there’s blood, blood everywhere.  His blood?  He thinks it is.  The coppery smell invades his nose, overpowering.  He can’t make sense of anything.  There’s someone else in the room.  Many someones.  Strong, rough hands are on his shoulders to force him back down.
“Hey.  Look.  Sorry I pushed so hard on the Bucky issue.  I said some things-“
“Wouldn’t dream of it. See ya, Sam.” He gives Sam his best grin and a two-finger salute before pivoting on his heel and making for the door.
“Pretty much.  Sans Wheaties.  And catharsis.”
“I have my break – we have time to talk if you want to.”
“Never thought I’d ever hear those words come outta your mouth, Cap.”
“Relax, Rogers,” she says dryly, not looking up from her reading as she sets her coffee cup back down on its saucer. “We were out late and I missed the last train back home, I opted to stay here rather than pay for a cab." She turns the page. "And I can assure you, James was a perfect gentleman.”
“I’m sorry.”  Just like that Tony’s inside and out the door before Steve can say another word, leaving him both dumbfounded and dazed.
to do and what he
“You knew, didn’t you.  What turning yourself in but refusing to see Steve would do.  You knew him better than anyone.  Knew how he would react.  You wanted him as far away from this city as possible.”
He doesn’t cry.  But after another half hour, Tony looks bored to tears so Steve takes pity. They wander the Strip for a while, Tony talking and Steve looking.  Tony has a story about almost every single establishment – a girl, a party, a drug, always something.  It’s ostensibly for Steve’s amusement, but Steve doesn’t find it all that amusing.  It’d be much better if Tony would risk being quiet and just be.
Steve pushes away from the window and turns to survey the empty room.   Legs feeling heavy, he turns off the solitary lamp that had been left on and in the darkness, sits down on the oversized couch.
. By the time they walked back into camp, Bucky knew it was never going to be the same. He'd missed his chance.
“How much access to the mission reports and debriefing sessions did you manage to get?”
“I do agree, sir.  I do however understand the inclination.  Many have expressed frustration with Master Stark.”
“Oh, Thor, those are different Madonnas.” Steve shakes his head, depressed by the very idea of confusing them.
His father had been sure they’d discovered a star, and Tony read all about it in his father’s short missives. Tony couldn't have possibly cared less at the time, and found his father’s focus on wartime propaganda frankly appalling. Howard didn’t want to go to war to save the world; he wanted war because war meant more money in his pocket, and Steve Rogers was going to help him sell the idea to the American public.
“You remember that I have to fly to London tomorrow morning? I’ll be gone for a couple of days. I want you to spend that time with Bucky.”
“It wasn’t a choice.” Steve doesn’t wait for Tony’s reaction or reply. He’s gone.
“To work, yes.  Not to me.  We’re done.”  Tony watches Steve carefully, reading the minute changes in his expression for some sign that maybe Steve’s moral code was the only thing keeping him from acknowledging whatever was happening here.
. Don’t do that.” He whirls at Tony, and whatever expression is on his face must startle Tony enough that he stumbles back. It vaguely registers, somewhere in his peripheral vision, that Steve finally notices them both together outside. He sits up straight, suddenly alert and staring out at them, his pencil coming to rest against paper.
“He’s asking for you,” he informs her quietly, sounding defeated.  He holds open the door for her but looks at the ground as she passes by and into the room.  The second she’s clear he lets the door close, and heads toward the exit like the place is on fire.
*******
“Yeah, but I’m exhausted and I could only come up with Beardy McBearderson and I think even you would’ve seen through that.” Tony leans against the doorframe and rubs his hands over his tired eyes.  Maybe it’s the conversation he just had with Pepper, but the day is suddenly weighing him down like a ton of bricks.
But right now, Steve is across from him at a table in this diner and they’re going to eat breakfast at four o’clock in the afternoon.
“I was twenty when they sent me on my first mission alongside him.  At the time it was the biggest day of my life, being sent out with the Winter Soldier.  He was the best of the best.”
Steve forces his eyes from Loki’s sneering face back to the images in hand.
At least that was where Pepper said he was on Monday when Steve finally caved and called Tony’s office, under the pretense he had some question about withholdings in his paycheck. He’d paid for his lie when Pepper transferred him to Phil Coulson and he spent the next fifteen minutes discussing tax law with one of Captain America’s biggest fans.
“You want to…wanna sit?” Bucky gestures to the couch, and Steve nods, following Bucky quietly. The couch is light blue, extra long and overstuffed, and he’d been with Bucky the day he’d picked it out. He’d helped Bucky with most of the stuff in his place, now that he thinks about it.
“Because he loves you too.”
Bucky glances at Tony, and it's immediately obvious that he didn't come out here for a breath of fresh air.
of you eat meat.  This bacon is
to stop doing this.” He coughs, sitting up.  The Hulk reaches over and shoves him back to the ground, grunting.
“It couldn’t even keep my attention, Pep. I was thinking about something else entirely.”
“I promise.”
You all are so temperamental.” He winks, assuring Steve that he’s at least
“I’m shit with hugs, Cap, give me something to work with here.”  She mumbles against his chest and he has to smile a little, he has no choice.  Tentatively, he lets his arms fall down around her.
“Barnes has been operating on behalf of the Russian government under the codename of Winter Soldier.  Agent Romanoff had contact with him in this guise prior to her involvement with SHIELD.  Before today, she was our only agent to have met the man face to face.  While working through your file after your recovery, she recognized your associate Barnes as the one we now know as the Winter Soldier and has been working to locate him since that time.”
“Apparently not.” Steve mumbles back, unable to hide his displeasure at this turn of events. Wanda plasters on a smile and leans over, tapping Tony on the shoulder and greeting him with over-played warmth, her accent growing broader as she fake-enthuses over her producer and his new paramour.
His appetite is non-existent at the moment.
“And if I knew tonight was the night that you were finally going to cave, I would have worn something better than these old rags and I would have bothered with my hair,” Darcy snaps back, touching her lustrous dark curls. To Steve, she looks perfectly beautiful, but he suspects that doesn’t actually matter.
“I don’t care if she hates my guts, Steve!  I meant what was with her, and the-“ She gestures in a circle around her upper body.  “And the-“ She gestures toward the closed bedroom door.  Steve lifts an eyebrow at her hyper behavior; he’s never seen her like this before.  “And…wait.”  Pepper stops, dropping her arms to her side as her brow furrows.   “What did she mean,
“Downloaded everything ten minutes ago.”  Steve has to laugh.  He closes his eyes against the sound of it, finding it only slightly bitter.  Tony is just so…Tony.  “And here I thought my last few months were rough.”
“Figured. It’s the only thing he doesn't mess up,” Bucky stage whispers to Jan. He pops open the fridge and grabs himself a beer.
“You wouldn’t be surprised if you saw him. Even a straight arrow like you might bend.”
“What?  Okay,
“He makes you happy, right?”
“That’s…yeah.  Okay.”  Tony processes this information, wishing he were there instead.  Right now, Nat’s probably one of the last people Steve would want to deal with.  But at least he’s in one piece.  “Okay.  Good.  But other than that…?”
“Tony, he’s not a toy.”
“Just sleep.” Tony murmurs, closing his eyes.  After a long moment, one that seems to last forever, Steve turns over and fits his body against the curve of Tony’s.
“That’s just…” Bruce ducks his head, almost abashed. “It’s just something I’ve been tinkering with.”
to tell any of you a goddamn word of this.  We could’ve just as easily kept Barnes under wraps.  I am giving Cap here the common courtesy of the truth.”
“Meaning he and Bucky had an epic smackdown.”
“Yep.”  Tony grins.  “Same thing as your shield, Cap.
“Steve Rogers?”
“Um…” Steve’s hand goes to the back of his neck and the action is so familiar that Tony hates himself a little for how much he loves it.  “I’ve been back since yesterday.  I thought you knew.”
Selznick came up through the ranks at RKO, MGM, and Paramount, and had more than proved his chops by the time he went independent. He was a movie man, not an imposter, an invader. And studio heads still resisted, still gave him trouble.
“I don’t think a broken landing gear constitutes
“I’m keeping my focus on the job.”
“That’s not what I think.  I don’t think that.”  Tony sits up and Pepper’s hand falls away.  He doesn’t look at her; he knows she’s going to have that pinched, hurt look on her face that makes him feel like the worst man on earth.  He sighs.  “I’m not punishing him for anything.  He just reminds me of things I don’t want to be reminded of.  That’s all.  I’ll get over it.  I’m
“We live with a bunch of weirdos, I don’t know-“ Clint starts.  Sam makes a small hissing noise and a jerking movement.  By the way Clint jolts, it’s clear that Sam has landed a sharp kick somewhere just out of Steve’s line of sight.  “What the-?”
“I know it’s late, I’m sorry,” He apologizes before Steve can speak, pulling his wristwatch out of his pocket. He’d been in such a rush he hadn’t even bothered to put it back on.
Tony isn’t aware of anything except Steve until he feels Bucky move into position behind him, the heat and weight of Bucky’s strong body solid against the backs of his thighs. Bucky slides his hard cock between Tony’s cheeks, the head nestled against the small of Tony’s back.
“Isn’t it?”  He replies.  He can’t describe how Steve stares at him then, but he doesn’t really like
Before Tony can help it, a genuine laugh escapes him.
Tony sidles down the row in front of Steve this time, plopping himself down in Steve’s direct line of vision. Steve blinks at him slowly, as if his own vision is just coming back into focus.
“A heads up would’ve been nice.” Tony comments as he lets the fridge door slam.  He cracks open the water, glaring at the other man as he takes a drink.  “This
“I hear you, Buck. Promise.”
“Look at you blushing, you’re adorable.” How she knows the color is rising to his cheeks, Steve’s not sure, because she still hasn’t spared him a glance.
Finding out how Sam wound up in this business will take a little hacking into SHIELD that he doesn’t have the patience or time for in present company, but from his short bio, this kid sounds like someone right up Cap’s alley.  The kind of hero Steve could readily relate to and accept.
Rhodey smirks back at him, causing Tony’s mouth to slip downward to a frown.
Tony knows he’s in trouble.
Even though Steve is clearly very upset, something akin to unbridled joy wells up within Tony out of nowhere and he is overcome with what can only be termed
Instead he wraps Steve’s legs around his torso and keeps going just like this.
“Irving died in the war. Was with the 26th at Kasserine Pass. She got the telegram about two days after you shipped out.” Steve’s fingers pull at the fabric now, tugging on a loose thread and making the hem run. “Scared the shit out of me. I felt terrible for her…but that didn’t stop me from thanking God it was him and it wasn’t you.” Steve glances up, but just as quickly looks back down. “Kinda makes me a terrible person, huh.”
“He wants to sit down, all three of us, tomorrow. Or, I guess today, rather.” He glances over Tony’s shoulder at the alarm clock on the nightstand. It’s after midnight, after all.  “We didn’t settle anything. Not until we all could talk together.”
“Didn’t ask for a shoulder to cry on,” Steve points out. “I believe all I asked for was a gin and tonic.”
“Good.”  Tony grabs his water and storms out, leaving Steve’s old best friend, lover, what the hell ever, behind.
“New security ID cards for the tower.  Come by, use the new gym, whatever.  It’s there.  We’re there.”
“I was with Tony Stark,” Steve admits, and just for a moment considers letting that lay there between them for Bucky to interpret as he may. The panic quickly surges through him, however, and he stammers forward with more information. “He wanted to talk business over dinner. Dinner turned into drinks and before I knew it, it was really late – too late – and I thought it best to take a room at the hotel rather than stumble home drunk. I didn’t want to wake you.”
!” Lensherr yells from beside the camera. “Das ist doch alles Scheiße!”  Various people snap into motion the second the camera stops rolling.
in a pretty endearing way.  He says it reminds him of witty screwball comedies like
Steve has no idea what stands in that paradoxically infinitesimal yet vast space between them.  Tony isn’t sure that he ever wants to tell him; he isn’t sure what he’d say.
Steve’s sure Tony won’t tell him the truth so he angles his own gaze through the tinted glass and watches the city go by.  So many people.  So many of them still reeling from the Chitauri invasion.  He doesn’t know how much more the city can take.
Steve finds their designated seats toward the front of the house and slumps down with relief. The worst part of the night is over; sure, the audience and critics may hate the damn picture, but it might actually be a blessing in disguise if the premiere makes no kind of splash and the film slips into obscurity. He’d much rather that than to have it be a major hit that he must keep discussing and re-living for the rest of his life.
Their intentions had been kind.  Clint, Natasha, and apparently Bruce went through a lot of pretense to bring him here tonight, but it doesn’t matter.  He’ll never fit in here without Tony.
, not higher.
“Even so…”
to get more firepower in the sky.”  He sounds incredibly disheartened.  Tony traces a thumb over his own palm, as if thinking of the repulsors lit there when he donned the Iron Man suit.  When he glances up, Steve sees barely contained regret in his brown eyes.
Sam responds with a deadpan grin, not missing a beat.
chases after.
Success being Steve.  And him.  In Oklahoma.   He doesn’t know how to do this, whatever this is that he’s doing.
As he stands, a loud clatter comes from the kitchen behind him.
Dissatisfied, he tosses it back onto the pile and picks up a couple of empty test tubes instead, rolling them between his palms.  Bruce glances at him warily.
There is a chorus of agreement and Natasha nods, and is about to say something when a look of annoyance tightens over her face.  She swears in Russian.
After throwing away the evidence of his less-than gentlemanly activities, he opens the door once more.
“Ever since you saw that photograph of Thor’s, you’ve been pestering me about him non-stop. And now here you are, the two of you, together, and what are you doing?” Jane makes a raspberry noise and makes a
“I…you didn’t have to do this.  I don’t need it.”  He says quietly, eyes averted.
It would have been risky to do too often, but surely Steve spending the night every now and again could have escaped notice or been made excuses for. They could have had some semblance of a life together, even if it wasn’t everything they really wanted it to be.
“That I do,” Sam doesn’t make him explain any further. Sam’s coped better with life after the war, but they’ve both had the nightmares. Steve just happens to get them more often, is all. Yesterday had been particularly relentless; he couldn’t so much as close his eyes without being assaulted by memories he desperately wanted to forget. Around 4am, he’d given up the ghost and went to the living room to get a jumpstart on the day’s work, tiptoeing around the apartment as not to wake Bucky.
“It sure is,” Steve smiles a little at that.
“Bucky has
have our choice of bedrooms between the two of us, I guess we can make use of
“’Sleeping with someone’ means something different now, Cap,” Natasha says.  He hadn’t meant to think aloud, but he supposes he must have.  He fights his blush and goes with it because he can’t really pretend he didn’t say it.
“You notice she’s always finding you clothes?  You’re her life size Ken doll,” Tony says as he and Steve run down the stairs, through Tony’s workshop to the connecting garage.  He hits a few buttons and the MARK VI case begins to open, pushing pieces of the suit forward as other parts of the cavernous garage begin to light up and roar to life.
“Pepper will wake up and worry where you are.”
It’s unkind to think that, he knows. A lot of people’s hard work when into the film, and Tony has his whole future in the business riding on its success. But that doesn’t stop Steve from wishing that tonight might be the last time he ever hears of it.
“All the more reason to be done with it.” Tony stands up, ending the argument by removing himself from the room. No one follows him out.
Steve’s cock is ramrod straight except a very slight curve upward just before the head. That curve, Tony knows from experience, is a curve that will naturally hit that practically perfect spot inside of him. It’s like Steve’s cock has been molded to fit Tony’s body, a god-given gift to provide Tony pleasure. Any thought of asking Steve to bottom disappears so quickly that it’s like he never considered it in the first place.
“There’s a bathroom down the hall if you want to…” Tony makes a lewd, jerking motion.
“If there’s one thing you’re not lacking, it’s charm, Tony.” Steve’s voice is fond, but Tony hears the underlying subtext. Steve has no outwardly apparent, logical reason to jet off to New York on a moment’s notice. He won’t be coming.
“This
“Why are you carrying this ratty thing around? Looks beat to hell. Is it a treasured keepsake from a lady friend, you old dog? I bet you –” Darcy stops, taking in the name written on the card. “Tony Stark? Who are you
“How much would it bother you if I…” Steve trails off, opting instead to slowly reach for Tony’s hand, giving him ample time to pull away if he wants to.  Instead, a smile spreads over Tony’s face and he folds his fingers comfortably between Steve’s.
“They’re the only ones
“Oh, Tony, he’s a doll. A peach. Easiest producer I’ve ever worked for.”
“Everyone get down.” Tony announces, red circles lining up and locking in his field of vision, targets acquired.  His missiles don’t miss and the field is cleared for a moment, allowing everyone to catch a much-needed breath before the next wave reaches their choke point.  The explosion is beautiful.
Steve moves first and just trusts Natasha will fall in line and follow.
“But you were thinking it.” Tony points at him, eyes narrowed.  He runs a hand over his goatee, making sure he hasn’t left any mess behind, and then throws his trash into a nearby can, tossing it in a perfect arc.  “3 points.”
“And now…?” Steve prompts quietly.
“God, Steve…” Tony starts, sounding for all the world that he has something more to say.
Happy senses his discomfort; Steve’s simultaneously embarrassed and grateful.
“Steve Rogers, I’ll love you 'til the day I die,” he whispers, and feels rather than hears Steve lightly laugh against him. One of the first things he did after Steve lost the serum was drop that scene from
Natasha looks surprised, but not too surprised.
“He doesn’t even know you.”
“I’ll let Fury know as soon as I work something up.”  Tony promises softly, the words choking in his throat.
Bucky is strangely breathless too, his eyes slightly wild. He’s barefoot, and his hair is down and more than a little rumpled. Tousled, like he’s been running and tugging his hands through it. His red and gray plaid shirt is untucked and unbuttoned, a loose white tee underneath with the v-neck just a little stretched, and his denims are worn soft at the knees. He looks perfect.
“You askin’ me to sign a long term contract, Tony, or are you askin’ me to go steady?” Steve is careful to keep his reply light, just in case he’s misreading the subtext.
“Well…
“Gorgeous.”  Tony hefts the pumpkin up.  “Grab those candles, Cap, and follow me.  Barnes, you come too, you can destroy your pumpkin later.”
“We’re not on our way home just yet, pal.”  It’d been a joint operation, chasing after whisperings of Arnim Zola somewhere deep in Austria.  Government involvement outside of SHIELD made Tony uneasy despite the fact that it meant Rhodey could join the team.  If SHIELD is shady, other branches of the government are living under a fucking eclipse.
Steve had excused himself and gone to bed shortly after Tony bundled him inside, wrapping him up in the throw from the couch to stave off the chill.
-” He gestures between them, trying to encompass all the strange tension that has kept them apart since Bucky returned.  “This isn’t about you not loving me.”
Tony is smirking at him.
“Tony, hello.  Didn’t hear you come in.”
Steve Rogers – how he smiles, how he talks, how his body feels under his hands – it’s too much pressure for his already strained subconscious to withstand.   He cracks a little more every time he sees Steve wake in the morning, hair mussed and his voice deliciously rough and so New York, separated from him by the mere few feet from one hotel bed to the other.  Fissures expand whenever he thinks about Steve coming out of that bathroom in only that towel or emerging dripping wet from the pond in Aspen; crevasses deepen when he recalls Steve pulling to the side of the road to help some stranger with a flat tire, or wasting precious daylight letting some old lady talk his ear off at the convenience store.
Steve asks him something, probably if he’s okay, but Tony can’t answer.
“Banner’s on seventeen.  Can you get him back to the tower safely?” Clint doesn’t wait for Tony to acquiesce before he and Natasha drag Barnes towards the door.  Natasha pauses a moment as they pass.
“Don’t drive the bike to the lot today if you’re not sleeping. Trolley will do you fine.”
“You seemed dead to the world – usually I can’t even roll over without waking you up, but those sinfully pretty eyelashes of yours didn’t so much as flutter when I came in here.” Steve can hear the teasing smile in Tony’s voice and Steve tries to keep the corner of his mouth from curling into a smile of his own. “So, I figured you must need the rest.” Tony pauses, but it seems like he has something more to say.
“You forget that I said
Bruce smiles, and Tony swears it takes ten years off the man’s face.
“Oh, okay.”  Steve frowns, wounded, and Tony feels bad, which makes him really want to punch something.  How does Steve have the power to do this to him with just a look?
“Steve Rogers for you, boss,” Happy announces. By the time Tony gets up the nerve to turn around, Happy is gone. It’s only Steve.
“All my ideas are good ideas.”  Tony retorts a bit belatedly, slipping his card back into his wallet.  He cannot remember the last time he had to buy things like these for himself.  Hell, he can’t remember being in a Walgreens before.  It’s a rather miserable place.
Most of the time, anyway.  The Other Guy kinda has his own shtick.
Bucky spins on his heel toward the other door and makes his escape, ignoring the way Steve’s plaintive call of
“I will.” Bucky hesitates, like he’s still waiting for Tony to take it all back.
“Barnes, where the hell you wandering in from?” Clint asks, smashing the silence.  Bucky steps all the way inside, shaking a few dead leaves from the bottom of his boots before walking further.  He’s carrying a large paper bag that seems heavy and is near overflowing.
He can feel Steve’s laugh rumble through him, their bodies are pressed so close.
“Speaking of Babs, don’t forget
“Course I can, but Captain America, card sharp, that’s something else.  Who’d suspect you?  We can get a little
He finds a DVD with that actor he liked from
“You really are a mess.  I can only imagine what you looked like when Ross brought you in.  I’m glad I wasn’t there to see it.”  Disentangling herself from his embrace, she turns and walks back down the hall.  Steve follows her slowly.  At his slower pace, she’s already in the living room and opening up one of the oak cabinets by the time he catches up.
“In New Mexico with Jane.”  Clint heads for the stairwell, yanking one of his arrows from the body of an enemy soldier that is strewn across the floor.  The dead man’s uniform is non-descript and Tony doesn’t recognize anything familiar about his face or anything particularly special about his weaponry.  “We couldn’t get through to him, I don’t know if Hill managed before communications were cut off.”
“Does this
useful can come out of my father’s ridiculous foray into filmmaking.”
Steve’s predictable even still.
“I’ve got Hill over here!”  He shouts, bending down and lifting the chunks of shattered concrete quickly.  Her face is stained dark with blood from a head wound and she’s wheezing, but she’s alive.
.  The sound of it sends a shudder down his spine.
That’s when Tony sees him.
Sam circles the couch and does his own quick investigation of the titles on offer, snorting in amusement.
Again, Steve’s blunt nature catches him off guard.
“At high tide, this whole beach is under five feet of water.” Steve breaks the silence that’s reigned between them since they parked the Cadillac and carefully crossed the Pacific Coast Highway, and walked down a long, steep set of concrete stairs to reach the wet sand now underfoot. The afternoon high tide has already partially receded, but the shoreline is still narrow. “All you can see are those big rocks out there. Water comes right up to the houses.”
It’s not like there’s anything there for Tony to taste, to see. Steve had made sure to wash thoroughly when he came home, but somehow Tony still knows. Maybe he and Bucky were just predictable.
, as this is all a little out of his realm of experience, but he at least wanted to look Bucky in the eyes when he, at long last, said the unsaid.

He makes a spontaneous trip to see Rhodey in D.C. for the weekend when Bucky says he’s taking Steve out to Coney Island and asks Tony if he’d like to come along.  He suspects Bucky only offers because he’s positive Tony will say no.  Of course, it turns out Rhodey is in Egypt so Tony winds up visiting the Air and Space Museum three times, alone.  He debates going to the National Gallery and picking Steve up a souvenir and decides against it.  But at the Museum of American History he breaks the rules and takes a picture of himself with the Star Spangled Banner, knowing Steve would get a kick out of it.  He never sends it.

“Fine.” Peter gulps, hoping Tony doesn’t come anywhere near him. He’s hard, and he’s sweating, and even though he’s trying so desperately to think about something,
