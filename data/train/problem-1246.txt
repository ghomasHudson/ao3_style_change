"...beautiful." John finished. "That was the most beautiful speech I have ever heard you say to me. I wish I had the capacity to say something so beautiful to you, but I can't. I'm speechless. You leave me speechless."
"Yes!" Sherlock made an inhuman noise as he came. His hand kept moving like a machine, increasing his pleasure as he came into his hand and onto the floor. He heard John come, just the slight moan he allowed himself. Sherlock took a moment to catch his breath before he spoke. "John?"
"Of course I have, don't be daft. My mother was quite fond of her fairy tales when I was younger. But that's all they are: fairy tales."
John's heart was pounding from the excitement at the possibility of having his questions answered, but now it was pounding from Sherlock's skin on his. He felt the electricity at the touch and felt a quiver in his belly. He could see Sherlock's arousal. He had peeked onto boats before and had seen the male and female of Sherlock's species doing....interesting things with each other. Running on adrenaline, and feeling emboldened by Sherlock's obvious interest, John sucked Sherlock's finger into his mouth and ran his tongue over it.
Sherlock panted, his cock searching for any sort of friction as his hips thrust wildly. "It-ah, God-it feels good. Really good."
Hearing John go from sweet to commanding never failed to make Sherlock hard. He enjoyed it immensely when John made the transformation. Even though his throbbing erection told him to obey him and give an affirmative answer, his brain still wanted to tease him a bit. "We'll see, Captain Watson. I might be preoccupied."
Sherlock gasped and bit his lip. Such a small gesture was making him harder than he could remember ever being. John released his finger and moved his tongue all over Sherlock's hand, stopping to press his lips against his palm. Sherlock's cock twitched more forcefully, dangerously close to coming in his trousers. He groaned and tried to pull John closer. He couldn't come like this, and tried to pull John up so he could catch his breath. Before he could, Sherlock was pushed to his back on the grotto floor and felt John's weight slide onto him. His mouth was plundered by John's seeking tongue, wrestling with his while John's fingers snaked into his hair. The light tug John gave had him gasping and turning his head to the side. John attacked his throat, licking behind his ear and sucking at the junction where his neck met his shoulder.
The captain shrugged again. "You hear stories every now and again of someone coming in off of the water and raving about magical mermaids who sang to them or saved their life or something like that. Wouldn't mind having a look at one myself."
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back as he continued to look at the boat; this could be a wonderful observation exercise. He could see how his guards behaved when they were free of royal responsibility, something Sherlock would never know. "How far out were you planning on going? And why are you taking a camera?" Sherlock questioned imperiously.
"John, listen to me. You. Cannot. Talk. To. Him. Just come with me, and we'll pretend that nothing happened. Okay? Please, John. Humans are bad news."
"You think I haven't exhausted all possible leads, Lestrade? That I am just sitting here on my arse eating cake all day?" Mycroft snapped the words out with more venom than he anticipated. He took a steadying breath. "Apologies."
John blushed a deeper shade of red. "Of course not, I was...preoccupied." He gave him a small smile but still couldn't look him in the eyes.
He sighed, and dove beneath the waves. His sandy blond hair plastered to his head as he dove further below. He let out another sigh.
"I know, I know. But, I can't help but think that she is right. I am ordinary. Even my tail is ordinary, I'm boring. No one wants to talk to me, no one ever wants to socialize with me. I'm just too...dull." He felt a pang of sadness go through him. The words rang true, but that didn't mean it hurt any less. His sister was right: he was just too boring. Earlier, she had laughed at his jealous expression when she was leaving to go out with her friends, and delivered the harsh words with a smile. John and Harriet had never really got on, but that didn't give her the excuse to be so cruel.
Sherlock tried to observe them, but he wondered suddenly what he had been thinking. With him on board, there was no way they were going to behave like themselves. They were going to act like they do on the palace grounds, always on alert, keeping the prince within eyesight while scoping out for danger. Sherlock sighed and rested his head in his hands. His boredom had obviously scrambled his brain, making him unable to think clearly. He sighed again; at least the weather was nice.
He stared at the shards, feeling the numbness creeping up on him. He bit his lip and picked up the television remote. He slapped it against his palm before he switched it on. He repeatedly chanted to himself "please be okay" over and over as he looked for the channel he needed. When he found it, the bottom banner scrolling across the bottom of the screen had his vision tunneling and his heart stopping. Breaking News From Afghanistan.....
Sherlock, while he was curious to find out, never let the thought slip pass the "idea" phase. He did like the captain, to an extent of course, and he did his job rather well.
Sherlock, hastily dressed, eyes wild and hair no less so, burst into Mycroft's office. Mycroft, expecting him, stood and tried to speak, but Sherlock beat him to it.
He had gotten off the phone with John a little over a week ago, painfully aroused and full of desire. He had wanted some release, but without John there to shag him until he couldn't walk straight, he had to settle with his hand. It wasn't the same as John's firm hand, stroking him until his orgasm hit him like a ton of bricks, but it was all he had until John came home. Perhaps that was why he was so edgy: he needed a proper orgasm.
Sherlock's back arched when he felt John's hand touch his cock. The air left his lungs as the hand slowly started pumping up and down, using the precome pooling at the top to lubricate the way. Sherlock wound his fingers into John's hair, tugging lightly, trying to pull him up for a kiss. John had other ideas. As Sherlock tugged on his hair, John darted his tongue out and gave a lick from root to tip.
The weeks had dragged on, and with their phone conversations becoming more and more sporadic, the weeks had seemed longer. John and Sherlock hadn't been able to talk on the phone for a while, and even his bones ached from missing his detective. He had heard the pout and worry in Sherlock's voice when John had mentioned that their phone calls would have to wait for  a while. He knew Sherlock worried, and bloody hell, sometimes John worried about himself too. But he did his best to reassure Sherlock that all would be back to its usual self before too long. Sherlock didn't like it, but he had accepted it.
He then took a good look at the man, as he now saw that it was indeed a man, and felt an unfamiliar feeling flow through his veins. The man had sandy blond hair that had water running out of it and onto his shoulders. His eyes were a deep blue, just like the sapphires in his mother's crown and had these adorable crinkles at the edge of them. Sherlock shook his head. Adorable? Since when do I use words like 'adorable?' His gaze traveled down the sun-kissed skin, the broadness of the man's shoulders. His muscles were lean, but Sherlock sensed the power beneath them. Sherlock's mouth watered a little when he thought about those muscles rippling beneath his mouth as he trailed his tongue... he shook the thought away. The other man had opened his mouth and was trying to say something.
"Yes, well, he," she gestured upstairs, "there's been an awful lot of racket coming from there. He was screaming for a while. From what I heard, I didn't think it would be wise to go in there. The whole street heard him. Why, Mrs. Turner next door called and said that she-"
Sherlock jiggled his knee obsessively as the cab seemed to crawl on its way to the hospital. Mycroft had called twenty minutes ago, saying that John was back in the country, but the wound was still serious enough that he needed to be in hospital for a longer period. Sherlock had spent approximately eight minutes and forty-seven seconds yelling at his brother for not telling him sooner that John was in the country. He had hastily gotten dressed and put his hand out for the next available taxi. On the way there, time seemed to have slowed down as they hit every single red light and every jam on their way. Sherlock blew out annoying breaths through his nose, fingers itching with the thought that he should have just called Mycroft to get him a car. They would have been there by now, and then......and then? He would have to see John, heavily injured. He had seen him injured before, of course. Scrapes, bruising, once even a broken arm. But a gun shot wound? One that was more serious than anyone was willing to let on? Sherlock's stomach rolled, and fear sliced down his spine. He swallowed and pushed the fear away. John needed him the most right now, and he was going to do everything he needed to do.
Sherlock bit his lip in anticipation. It was getting increasingly difficult to keep his hard on at bay. When Captain Watson came out, it was hard to keep from coming right then and there. He closed his eyes and bit back a moan. "Yes," he whispered.
Mycroft reached out and grasped his arm. "Sherlock, please breath. John is, well..." He cleared his throat. "Sherlock, John is very injured. He was shot in the shoulder. He's still touch and go." He didn't want to tell Sherlock everything, but he also felt that he had a right to know.
John stopped struggling and pondered her words. Forget? How could he forget this? It was finally something exciting that was happening to him! His blood was racing just thinking about how he saved the human, and he wanted to feel this feeling again and again. His curiosity was also peaked. He could finally ask some of the questions about his species that had been running around in his brain for years. He wanted to ask the man, and he wanted to ask him now. While Molly was distracted by John's pondering, he broke free of her grip and swam towards the surface. He broke through just as Molly shouted his name. He nearly collided heads with the man, who was peering over the edge anxiously. They both let out a gasp.
The captain saw him approach and called his men to attention. Sherlock waved them off and looked at the small boat. It wasn't anything fancy, just a small fishing boat with a few rods and a tackle box inside. A separate box made of styrofoam, was at the bow, presumably filled with alcoholic beverages and food. It was obvious the men were going fishing, or at least were hoping to. The weather was fine for it of course, and they looked like they needed some relaxation time. The captain had granted his men at least one day off a week, in order for them to remain "in good spirits." Whatever that meant.
Sherlock saw John struggling and tried to swim faster. The octopus had a few tentacles wrapped around him. He had no weapon, but was filled with a surprising amount of rage. Though they hadn't known each other for very long, Sherlock felt oddly protective of his newfound companion. He started tugging on the tentacle wrapped around John's waist, trying desperately to free his John. He heard John shouting, but was too full of possessiveness to make out words.
Sherlock stared at him a little harder. He had assumed that this man had been on their boat and he just hadn't noticed him. When he asked his name, he knew that he hadn't been a part of their party. But that just raised more questions. If he wasn't in the group that Sherlock tagged along with, then who was he? Where did he come from? There hadn't been any other boats for miles.
John was getting used to the extra duties that had befallen him since some of the men had caught pneumonia. He liked having things to do, he liked being useful. But more importantly, having a lot to do meant he wasn't so distracted by how much he was missing Sherlock. After their rather steamy conversation, John's need for Sherlock had been growing everyday. He found himself reaching for him in the middle of the night, and his heart ached every time he didn't grasp Sherlock. Whenever his CO was droning on and on, he heard Sherlock's voice in his head. "Dull" "boring" "not worth my time." His CO had only caught him smiling once, and had subjected John to extra PT for laughing at his efficiency campaign. John still heard Sherlock in his head, but had become an expert at keeping his face statue like.
John opened his mouth to tell Sherlock to stop acting like an idiot, then thought of a new plan. With a small grin on his face, he moved to the door and braced his back against it, making sure that no one would be able to get in. "Sherlock."
He heard a snort. "With all of your inside men, you don't know what's happening? Give me a break. Mycroft."
Sherlock interrupted once more, knowing that he needed to state his feelings before he lost the courage to do so. "You misunderstand, John. It isn't a physical pain I feel, but a psychological one. My heart is functioning perfectly, but it misses you terribly. It misses you in the night when I can't sleep, and cries out when I reach for you and you aren't there. It breaks over and over again when I return to the flat, knowing you won't be there, but still half hoping you will be, putting the kettle on, flashing me a smile, pulling me into your arms just for the sake of holding me close. It sends pain all over my body and I can't help but cry at the overwhelming feeling of loneliness that creeps up on me. Your things that are lying around the flat even bring tears to my eyes. They lie about, untouched, practically screaming at me that you are not here, and the feeling is unbearable. My heart is missing a piece of itself and it knows it won't be happy again until you, the missing piece, are home with me, safe and sound. That is the pain my heart feels, John. I miss you."
John was dizzy with arousal. Sherlock's moans were encouraging him to move on, to try and give this gorgeous man more pleasure. He felt nails dig into his back and moaned into Sherlock's neck. He tasted salty and sweet at the same time. He slid the shirt off of Sherlock, and felt the muscles bunch under his tongue as he ran it down the shoulder, down his chest and sucked a nipple into his mouth. He swirled it around his tongue, delighting in Sherlock's sharp gasps. He lightly took it in between his teeth and tugged it this way and that, while his fingers tugged at the other one. Sherlock's fingers dug into his shoulder blades as the moans came out of his mouth like a cascading waterfall. Sherlock began panting his name as John continued to lick and suckle across his chest, down to lick his navel. He fought with the trousers for a moment, desperate to get to the ultimate prize, and pulled them forcefully down Sherlock's legs. This...other garment was still in his way. It was thinner than the trousers were, and it only covered what John was seeking. John stared at this garment quizzically before hooking his fingers on the top of them and tugging them down. The cock bobbed freely, leaking against Sherlock's stomach and nearly purple with Sherlock's arousal, making John drool with his desire to taste it. He cautiously reached out to touch.
The captain blushed slightly and shrugged. "We weren't going to go much farther than a couple of leagues, and the camera is for tryin' to catch a glimpse of a mermaid."
Sherlock set the phone down on the side table, like John asked, and took his nipples in his hands. He tweaked them, gasping at how sensitive they had become. The need to be shagged, no, fucked, slammed into him and he thrust his hips into the air. He let out a small moan as continued to roll his nipples between his fingers.
"Sherlock, don't you dare come. You aren't allowed to come until I am inside you and you ask my permission." He continued to stroke and massage, while Sherlock practically bit through his lip trying to comply.
"I missed you too, love. It's wonderful to hear your voice." John had smiled when he heard Sherlock ask him what had taken so long. They had intel that said there was going to be an attack soon, so the higher ups had ordered them to move it along. They had taken everything apart and moved as ordered, and it had taken them a little while to get everything situated. He had worried constantly that Sherlock was freaking out, scared, and it made John upset. He didn't want to be so far away, but he felt it was his duty. He thought about Sherlock all the time, and had regretted missing their phone call. "Don't worry, Sherlock. We got some info that we were going to need to relocate for better helicopter access and it just took us a little longer than usual to get situated." He hated lying to Sherlock, but didn't want him to worry any more than he already was. "I'm fine, Sherlock. Perfectly fine. How are you holding up?"
Sherlock yelled for John, clambering over to the edge and trying to peer down. When he still couldn't see, he dove in after John.
Sherlock scoffed and inspected the boat again. "I should like to join you on your outing today captain, if it isn't too much trouble, of course." Sherlock batted his eyelashes at the men, knowing full well they couldn't refuse him. Without waiting for a response, he climbed into the boat, sat down, crossed his long legs, and waited. The men glanced at their captain, who then began barking out orders to find extra food, and another life jacket, which Sherlock refused to wear, then they set sail.
"I don't have that right now. I need to know what happened to a soldier. When will you know for sure?"
John struggled against Molly's grip. His anger was bubbling towards the surface, just begging to be set free. He wanted the man to see him, and he wanted to see more of the man. He wanted to talk to him, get to know him, hear his laughter, stroke those cheekbones, caress those cupids bow lips....John shook his head to steer his brain away from where he was going, and continued to struggle against Molly's grip.
"No, John. It wasn't enough. I don't want to have sex over the phone with you. I want you here, in our bed, making love with me."
Sherlock came to with a heavy thumping on his back, and just when he thought the firm hand was going to crack his spine, he vomited up an incredible amount of sea water. He rolled onto his back and struggled to catch his breath. He felt a hand stoking his cheek. It was very light, almost hesitant, and he leaned lightly into the touch and the hand continued its gentle stroking. His vision was blurry, but he could distinctly make out a form, a man going by his supposed shoulder width. He assumed it was one of his guards. As he drew breath to speak and ask where he was and how long he had been out, the figure suddenly slipped below his vision.
Sherlock glanced at John with a smile. He leaned over to John and placed a gentle kiss on his lips. John inhaled as he returned the kiss. Pulling away, Sherlock ran his thumb along John's bottom lip, looking at the daze in his eyes. Sherlock smiled. "Of course."
Mycroft's stomach did a flip as he recalled Sherlock's days of drug use. "Neither do I. I will continue my search for John, if you will please try and keep an eye on Sherlock? Make sure he doesn't do anything....rash?"
"So, nothing new I'm afraid," John continued, "just the same old routine. How did Lestrade take your news about the milk?"
"Sherlock, it's an active military zone. Even I can't allow a civilian into an active war zone. I can't do it."
Sherlock focused on nothing. Did nothing. Went nowhere. He simply lay on the floor, staring at John's chair, snarling at anyone who got too close to it. He stared at the ceiling that wavered as his eyes watered.
John, alarmed by the sudden change in mood, sat up, inspecting Sherlock for some sort of wound. "Sherlock? Did I hurt you? Shit, I'm sorry. I just wanted to feel you and-"
Sherlock wiped a tear that fell from his eye. He heard another voice over the phone speaker, probably another officer. He couldn't quite make out what John said, but his instincts told him that it was time to say goodbye. "Sherlock?"
John sighed. "Sherlock, please tell me that you were at least polite to him? I'm not there to play safety guard you know."
He picked up the phone and threw it across the room, hearing it clatter to the floor. He crawled into John's chair, wrapping his dressing gown closer around his thinner frame and curled in on himself on the chair. Through the open door, the one that Mycroft had had removed due to his concern of a relapse, he heard Mrs. Hudson's phone ring downstairs. He rolled his eyes and burrowed deeper into the chair. He heard a slamming door, feet pound up the stairs, and winded breathing.
"Good, and it's 'Yes Captain.' Now, put the phone down. I want to grab your nipples. Do it, Sherlock."
"Mrs. Hudson! I don't want to hear about my brother. Whatever he and his fat arse want, I don't care."
Sherlock sat up, though his arms shook a bit. That had been an incredibly intense orgasm, far better than any he had given himself over the last few months. "Where did you learn to do that?"
John inhaled. Oh, he did love it when Sherlock resisted him. "I'll have you know, Mr. Holmes, that when you and I got off the phone last week, I was sporting a throbbing erection. You have no idea what you did to me last week, and I only had my hand to help release myself. Since then, I have been testy because I haven't been able to have a proper shag. You have been an incredibly naughty boy, making me hard when you can't do a goddamn thing about it. You'll need to be punished. Do everything I say, understand?"
Sherlock groaned, his hands scrabbling to curl around John's shoulders. He had never been so aroused so quickly before and his head was spinning. John tugged at his shirt, trying to undo buttons while nibbling on his earlobe. Sherlock gave a breathless laugh and tried to help him with shaky fingers.
Sherlock took what he felt like was the millionth trip through his castle. He was so completely and utterly
John smirked at the cracking. He had practically screamed when he came, and it made John ridiculously proud that he had done that to someone, and that they had actually enjoyed it. "Are you always this articulate after an orgasm?"
She unwrapped her tentacle from around John. In truth, the man frightened her. A lot. She darted down, away from John and the man.
excited. But when he looked downwards to check him out, he had been flabbergasted. He had no legs. Instead, there was a long, brown, shining tail. He reached out to touch, but drew his hand back when John flinched. Without making eye contact, John motioned for him to touch his fin.
Sherlock shuddered. "Yes, Captain. I wish you were here so you could be inside me, thrusting deep until you hit that sweet spot that makes me scream."
"Ah, I'm, well...ah...." John found himself staring into the grey green eyes and finding himself at a loss for words. The man eyed him curiously, roaming over his shoulders, his face. John felt strange as he felt
"Only for you." Sherlock replied with a grin. He leaned in again, trying to pick up where they left off.
But the intensity of their love making was leaving Sherlock feeling overwhelmed. Without a moment to try and stop them, the tears flowed out of his eyes and onto John's chest, sobs starting to shake his whole body.
Sherlock watched as John bit his lip, feeling the warmth again. He had the sudden urge to draw that lip into his own mouth so he could bite it, then suck it until it was swollen and the most delicious shade of red, and then he would reach down between John's legs and stroke his-Sherlock shook his head again. His once tame libido was suddenly making an unwanted appearance due to this fair haired man.
Sherlock shouted and bucked his hips, earning a satisfied groan from John. John bobbed his head, running his tongue along the smooth, hot skin, tasting the salty flesh, listening to Sherlock fall apart above him. He pulled off of Sherlock with an audible pop and moved his hand up and down the shaft, and suddenly deciding to play dirty, started massaging his prostate from the outside. Sherlock was practically sobbing, frantically thrusting towards his finish.
It was the phone, but Sherlock ignored it. He was curled on the floor, in front John's chair. He held an old shirt of John's to his nose, trying desperately to find more of John's scent. He felt the sting in his eyes, but knew no tears would fall. His heart clenched.
Sherlock stared at John, cock twitching. That moan was so soft yet so passionate that all Sherlock wanted to do was keep hearing it over and over again. He was absolutely positive that the sound alone could make him come. He wanted to approach John to hear it again, but he was giving off the vibe of 'please don't come near me right now.' He was shy, painfully shy, but that was probably brought on by the years of self esteem issues he was clearly suffering from. Someone had hurt his self esteem.. He clearly wanted Sherlock to get off the topic of him moaning at the tail touching, so he would oblige until they could circle back around to it more comfortably.
He looked to John's face, noticing that his eyes were twitching, indicating coming out of a deep rest. Hope bloomed in his chest as he squeezed John's hand. A squeeze back. John's eyelids peeked open, just a little, but enough that he made eye contact. The scratchy, soft voice was like music to his ears.
John huffed. "He's different, I can tell already. If you saw-" He was interrupted by a splash. He looked up to see Sherlock swimming towards them. John struggled in Molly's grasp again. "Molly, let me go!"
"Thank you, Mrs. Hudson," Mycroft interrupted, "I'll of course pay for any damages done to the flat. I'd best go check on my brother." He left her at the bottom of the staircase, anxiety building in his abdomen with every step. He reached the top and placed a hesitant hand on the handle. Taking a deep breath, he turned it and pushed the door open.
John, speechless, did nothing. Said nothing. He let Sherlock cry on his shoulder, feeling all of the pain and worry flow out of him. He knew Sherlock had been holding back, he knew that's why he curled around him so closely at night, why he was watched almost every minute of every day. Sherlock was afraid that something was going to happen to him. What could he say to that? He cleared his throat. "Sherlock, love, you know I would never leave you. Not willingly anyways." Sherlock grunted and buried his face in John's neck, taking deep shuddering breaths. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock and pulled him as close as he was able without his shoulder twinging. "I mean it, Sherlock Holmes, you aren't getting rid of me that easily. I will never leave you. Never. I love you, you tosser. So much. Alright?"
Freeing his arms, Sherlock pushed away from the sink and dragged John behind him, practically running to their bedroom.
John moaned. "Pull yourself out, Sherlock." John pulled his own zipper down and freed himself. He gripped his steel hard cock, almost trying to tame it. He had fantasized about this for weeks, and he was damned if he was going to wait any longer.
Sherlock quickly obliged. He lightly gripped his cock, gasping as the heat rushed into him. "Ready, Captain."
John smiled. "You know," he said with a chuckle, "When someone introduces themselves, it's polite to introduce yourself back. Common courtesy and all that."
Phil sighed again. "We have a unit that is only a few kilometers away and the firing has decreased exceptionally. If everything goes well, and the firing stops, we should have a unit there soon. I will let you know as soon as we make contact, Mycroft, you have my word." The line went dead and Mycroft set the phone down. He cursed under his breath and ran a hand lightly over his meticulously combed hair. This wasn't good.
"I know!" She shouted back. "It's a grotto with an air pocket! Hurry!" John propelled them through the water and into the entrance. He broke the surface of the grotto and laid the man down on a rock. He wasn't breathing. John turned him over on his side and began to pound the man's back. He may have swallowed a good amount of water, and was hoping his heart was in the same place as the merfolks', so he could try and start it again.
"It's time for our cleaning duties, so I have to go. Bloody awful timing, too. I hate to get off the phone after hearing that from you."
John wasn't sure how to phrase that he was a merman without it sounding strange, so he decided that Sherlock should just see it for himself. He motioned for Sherlock to scoot back, then boosted himself onto the lip of the rock. His face flamed as he heard Sherlock gasp. He looked into the water and did his best to avoid eye contact.
Sherlock snapped at anyone who tried to clean the shattered remains of the telly, who tried to pick up the stuffing from the sofa cushions off of the floor, or who tried to pick up the letter opener.
Sherlock scoffed. "If he wasn't such an idiot, he would have figured it out for himself. You actually just missed him. He was here for a few moments."
. His brother, the fat arse that he was, had seen to it that Sherlock was not allowed in the weapons room, or on the firing range, or any where else that would have offered a reprieve from his boredom. He had only shot through the walls a few times, and that experiment where he had attached a spear to a gun? That had merely been a miscalculation that Mycroft had overreacted to......even if that guard had to be airlifted to the hospital. However, if Mycroft hadn't been interfering with his activities and hobbies, then none of that would have happened.
Sherlock was not one for primping excessively, but as he stood in front of the bathroom mirror, making sure that everything was combed or brushed thoroughly, he found that he didn't mind going that extra mile. Especially if that extra mile was for John. He glanced down at his shirt, the deep purple one that accented his lean muscles (and was John's favorite shirt on him) to make sure that there weren't any toothpaste stains on it. His black trousers were pressed, and doing a triple then quadruple check, everything was finally ready. As he walked towards the computer to get signed on for their chat, Sherlock felt excited. After weeks of barely talking, he was finally going to get to see John's face. His sandy blond hair, his deep blue eyes that could tell what Sherlock was thinking or feeling without the detective having to say anything. His smile...Sherlock sighed. He couldn't wait.
"John?" His voice was small, tight. He could feel the hope swim through his veins, trying to burst out.
Mycroft snapped his head up at the steely resolution in Sherlock's voice. "Sherlock, I can't get you there."
"Sherlock, you need to get this stuff checked out. I won't be home for a few months and I told you that you need to get examined when I am not there and-"
Sherlock paced the flat. He was right at the end of a case, and he was edgy. He had kept up hope that Lestrade would have figured out who the murderer was before Sherlock had to step in. It was transparent who had done it, and he was frustrated that no one was keeping up with him. The one man who kept him grounded, and who also kept him from lashing out at everyone for their stupid comments and questions, was thousands of miles away.
Phil sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. "Mycroft, we don't know much. All we know is that there was a patrol sent out around their perimeter, and there was an explosion. We lost contact a few minutes later after a second explosion occurred. We're trying to reach them, or any squad around them to find out what's going on. The keyword there is 'trying.' I'm afraid I can't give you more than that because that is all we know at the moment. What's the big concern?"
They both got off the phone that evening, huge smiles adorning their faces as they thought about each other.
John inhaled and bit his lip. He knew Sherlock liked being commanded as much as John liked commanding, but hearing Sherlock disobey like that drove him crazy. He adjusted himself on the wall, trying in vain to ignore the erection straining against the zipper of his pants. "God, you have no idea what you do to me. I love you, Sherlock Holmes. More than any words in any language could express."
John tugged at the tentacle again, anxiety creeping up. Sherlock's face was turning a light blue from lack of air. He didn't want Sherlock to hurt Molly, and he didn't want Molly to accidentally hurt Sherlock either. "Molly, please!"
"Stroke yourself, Sherlock. Imagine that it's my hand stroking you, only I have a firmer touch. You need to grip yourself tighter, stroke a little harder. How tight is your hand?"
"Jesus, Sherlock," John moaned, closing his eyes. Listening to that had made John unbearably hard. He could picture it perfectly, having sex with Sherlock in an incredibly public place that added the very real possibility of getting caught. Making love with Sherlock in their shared bed, listening to his lover moan and groan his name as he pleasured him for hours on end. He had imagined all sorts of new positions he wanted to try with Sherlock when he got home and knowing Sherlock was thinking the same things was enough to drive him wild.
"It's just that--I've been thinking. And I think we should." He squeezed Sherlock's hand. "I love you, Sherlock. You're my best friend. I've never felt the same way for anyone. And you're a damn good shag," he joked. Sherlock shook his head as John continued. "I've already spent most of my life with you. I want to spend the rest of it with you, too."
John sighed, ready to settle in and nod off after being thoroughly disheveled and debauched by a no longer preoccupied Sherlock, and disheveling and debauching him in return, but instead he forced himself to be the reasonable one. "Sherlock, we're going to have to sneak you back out of here soon."
“That’s…!” he began indignantly, but decided she should at least know that truth. “That’s exactly right, actually.”
Just as they'd come back around the corner, Sherlock and John froze at the same panicked, barking voice that had followed them out of the park and through the city. Slowly, they turned to face the suspect who'd chased them.
John's friend, it turned out, was in one of Sherlock's classes, and had announced an invitation to them all that Sherlock had promptly dismissed and forgotten about. But when he and John stepped through the door, Mike greeted them both jovially.
“Yeah, probably not.” John smiled and took his hand as they mounted the spiral staircase up to the stargazing platform.
As always, it was as though Sherlock’s mind had transferred all of his usual confidence to John once things had come to a certain point. John smiled warmly before bringing Sherlock’s hand to his mouth, thoroughly licking his palm, and wrapping it around them both. He guided and encouraged the first few strokes until he couldn’t anymore. His brain was beginning to short-circuit at the feeling of Sherlock touching him in a way he never had before, and although his own hand didn’t fall away completely, his grip went slack as his jaw and his eyes searched for Sherlock’s wildly. When they met, the sensations seemed to intensify tenfold, and he thrust up into Sherlock’s hand unconsciously.
“I usually just talk to Lestrade. He’s used to it. Besides, I don’t want to just snitch to you. I’d like for you to give a second opinion from time to time. It’s very valuable to me.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but didn't look up. "Would you rather I had continued to 'sulk around the flat like a three-year-old'? Your words, if I recall."
John just smirked, knowing Sherlock wouldn't be able to turn down the challenge. "First to stutter in the middle of his secret has to take one request from the winner."
John rubbed his eyes and downed two glasses of water before he could even consider thinking of what had happened as he’d woken up. He remembered with a start that he had been sleeping in Sherlock’s bed. He remembered drinking quickly, and the shards on the floor were an easy sign that he had dropped an empty bottle. He was still fully clothed—so there was nothing to worry about, right? He simply hadn’t been sober enough to make it upstairs.
John was halfway through his steak-and-kidney pie when he heard Harry’s voice. “What’s up, little brother?” she said, clapping him on the shoulder and helping herself to some chips.
John turned to the Chocolate Cauldrons and picked a package at random. On closer examination, they were filled with something called Party Punch.
If John had been drinking something, he would have coughed and sputtered. Instead he just turned to the boy lying beside him with wide eyes. Sherlock returned the gaze and shrugged.
Finally, she cleared her throat. “Mycroft, dear, tell Aunt Wendy about your forthcoming internship at the Ministry.”
It was in one such spot that they had gotten themselves into a bit of an awkward situation, when John went in behind Sherlock before realizing that it wasn’t quite big enough to hold two adolescent wizards comfortably. Unfortunately, Sherlock had neglected to mention that the wall would re-solidify behind them, so they were stuck like that for a few moments, Sherlock reaching for his wand in pitch darkness and instead finding the front of John's trousers.
“Oh my god, Sherlock, we’re going to be late! And we…well, we…” John, in his panicked state, struggled for the right words, because although he knew nothing serious had happened the night before, it felt oddly like something had.
Sherlock had gone all out with that year's costume. In fact, he had gone a bit overboard. At two in the afternoon, Mycroft had started his makeup. Three hours later, he'd been forced to redo it twice because, in Sherlock's words, it "didn't look Bowie enough." He was busy with the third application of eyeliner and cursing himself for ever taking Sherlock to see that film when there was a knock at the door.
“Yes. Uncle Rudy. He can’t ever make it to Christmas dinner, so he typically visits a few days later. He’s late this year.”
,” John said, appearing behind them, and Sherlock froze, his cheeks rapidly darkening to meet the shade of Molly’s.
"Family and friends, we are gathered here today to witness and celebrate the union of John Hamish Watson and William Sherlock Scott Holmes..."
When they got back to the castle that evening, they made a plan to meet in the same third-floor passage as before as soon as John finished dinner. Then they reluctantly separated, Sherlock headed up the stairs with the Chocolate Cauldrons and John through the doors into the Great Hall.
"Because after years of telling me you love me and kissing my arsehole and fucking me all over this bloody flat, you still couldn't admit it to your father. And before that, I had to sit there for dinner at your house at fourteen years old and hear him talk about 'that goddamned shirt lifter from the office' and pretend it was funny because we'd just snogged ten minutes before. And before
"You've brought it here for a bit of practical learning." Sherlock paused, waiting for confirmation of his theory. "Go on," he urged after a moment. A few students snickered.
Sherlock checked on his experiments in progress, but nothing needed his immediate attention, and he simply did not have the concentration to start something new. He felt antsy, his heart beating too fast. He wanted to do something, anything to get his body under control. The old itch of his previous drug use started rearing its ugly head. The faded track marks on his arms were starting to feel hot again, and he absently rubbed at them as he sighed deeply. He passed by his brother's study, door firmly shut as he heard him talking on the phone to someone. He stuck his tongue out at the door, having more than half a mind to burst in and ruin whatever trading deal Mycroft was trying to negotiate. However, the old lesson their parents had instilled in them, "Country above all," forbade him from doing so. He sighed and went to pace the castle grounds,
Sherlock's hand squeezed around his own cock, pistoning himself between John's cock and his own fist. He felt the tingle starting in his balls, moving up to tighten in stomach, then explode outward as the orgasm swamped his body. He cried out, arching his back as he shot his come all over John's stomach. John cried out and followed soon after, coming deep inside Sherlock's convulsing arse. Sherlock collapsed onto John, coating them both in sweat and come.
John took a deep breath. Before Sherlock had touched his tail, he was worked up. He wasn't sure how he was going to react, so it made him nervous. But when the prodding turned into stroking, John couldn't help but feel aroused. No one had ever touched him like that. It had felt as soothing as it was arousing. The moan had slipped out unintentionally, and he had seen Sherlock's head snap up, but Sherlock was actively ignoring it. John was grateful. "Yes, just surprised, I suppose. I've never had anyone touch my tail before."
He grabbed the man, as he now noticed his gender, around his middle and went to break for the surface, but found it too far away. He hadn't even realized how far they had sunk. He looked madly around, and saw Molly gesturing towards an entrance.
"Bad day, was it?" John turned his head and gave a small smile to his friend, Molly. The female octopus swam up beside him, her eight tentacles easily keeping up with the movement of John's tail. Her bright gaze eyed him curiously.
John sniffed, tears streaming down his cheeks. He put a hand over his mouth, refusing to start sobbing. In all of their years together, Sherlock had never said anything that beautiful to him. It was...overwhelmingly sweet. He felt his heart swell with love for his consulting detective.
"You are exactly three days, six hours, and forty minutes late calling me. What happened? Are you alright?" Sherlock silently cursed himself. He had wanted to start out with something lovey dovey, or heaven forbid, sexy, but hearing John's voice, after their usual appointment on the phone had been missed, reminded him that they were thousands of miles apart. Not hearing from John was.....torture. It made Sherlock nervous when he went too long without talking to John. His mind palace had a secret, heavily locked door that was full of all the scenarios of what could happen to John in Afghanistan. Bombings, terrorist attacks, surprise ambushes, or even being a victim of friendly fire. He heard John chuckle and was brought back to the conversation at hand.
Finally, finally, the cab pulled up to the hospital. Sherlock shoved bills at the cabbie, not even bothering to count to see if it was correct. He ran through the doors, straight to the stairs.
John stroked Sherlock's cock, adding the twist at the tip he knew would drive him crazy. Sherlock whimpered and started thrusting his hips in time with John's strokes. John continued to lick and suck at Sherlock's neck, reaching down to tug at Sherlock's balls. Sherlock groaned and wrapped his arms around John's neck. His hip thrusting became more erratic as he felt his balls and stomach tighten. And just when Sherlock was about to explode, John moved his hands out of reach, keeping him right on the edge. Sherlock groaned again, and reached down to finish the job himself, but John captured his hands and restrained him. Sherlock's hips thrust uselessly, looking for friction of any kind, but John moved far enough away to deny him.
"Oh, John. My John." He reached out and gently grabbed John's hand. "Oh, God, John...how can....someone....what.....?" John had once pointed out that when Sherlock started to stammer, it meant he was getting overwhelmed. John was always good at pulling him out of this state, but now, John was just lying there. Deep smudges under his eyes, looking so weak and frail. His strong John. Sherlock took a deep breath, and squeezed John's hand as tight as he dared. "John, my John. I know you can hear me. I need you to do something for me, please? You've always had a hard time denying me anything, especially if I add that word you always try to get me to use more often. I need you to come back to me, John, because I need you." He laid his head on the back of John's hand and closed his eyes. "I need you, John. I can't go back to how things were before you, and I don't want to even entertain the notion of a world without you inside it. No one-no one understands me like you do. No one is as suited to me as you are. I can't work, can't eat, can't sleep, I can't function without you. Please," he begged as a tear rolled down his cheek, "please don't leave me. Don't leave me. Don't leave me."
"If you weren't on the boat, then where did you come from? I honestly doubt that you were in the middle of the ocean just for recreational swimming."
A week went by and still, no one had heard anything about John. Mycroft was getting desperate. Despite his reputation as the "Iceman," Mycroft was worried and visibly so. It was starting to unnerve everyone around him. He had set up round the clock surveillance on Sherlock, and made sure someone always had eyes, to make sure that he didn't do anything drastic. Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson gave constant attention to the depressed detective, but he still continued to lose weight, and lose interest in everything: the work, the experiments, his life. He hadn't said more than a handful of words or eaten more than a few mouthfuls of food in over a week. Mycroft was buzzing with nervous energy. He knew that Sherlock had lost his will, and was soon going to lose everything unless he found John.
Sherlock's stomach dropped to his knees as his head shot up. He took in her face, the look in her eyes. Shock, fear, a small glimmer of hope through the tears in them. He swallowed.
Sherlock shoved his hand down his pajama bottoms and pulled his cock out. It was now fully erect and throbbing. He needed release, and he needed to hear John's voice as he came. But even he wouldn't dare cross Captain Watson.
"Both." At Sherlock's distressed and angry look, he sighed and rubbed a hand over the back of his neck. "Listen, I can do my best to get John home sooner than later, but I absolutely cannot allow you to go to a war zone. Do you understand?"
Mycroft continued to stare at the screen as the assistant's voice buzzed in his ear. "I don't care what you have to interrupt, but you are going to interrupt it and get me some goddamned answers. Now!" Mycroft ground his teeth as he heard the line being transferred from place to place, his frustration growing with every breath he took. Finally, he heard the line pick up.
Mycroft drummed his fingers on the table, waiting while his phone call was yet again bounced around from person to person. Phil was almost as hard to reach as Mycroft himself was. His teeth ground together as his assistant answered the phone. When Mycroft told her his name, she sputtered and he heard her rush around, trying to locate Phil. He rubbed his eyes as he waited.
After a few terrifying seconds, the man coughed and heaved up what seemed like a half gallon of water and laid on his back, trying to catch his breath.
Pulling away, John rolled onto his back. He reached over the bedside table and grabbed the small bottle of lube. Slicking up his cock, he reached over to a heavily panting Sherlock and pulled him on top of him. "I want to see you ride me," he babbled as he rubbed lube over Sherlock's entrance, "I want you to bounce on my cock after you take every hard inch inside you." Sherlock pounced onto him and lined up John's cock with his opening. Sinking down, his back arched as John moaned, feeling the tight heat enclose his cock. It felt so good, so bloody amazing, but it also felt like he was home.
Sherlock wanted to keep his eyes open, but the pleasure was too overwhelming. His eyes clenched shut as John continued to deep throat him and tug at his balls, while the other hand continued to pump up and down as John started moving faster. Sherlock tightened his hand in John's hair. His belly quivered and he felt his balls tighten in John's grip. "John-I'm gonna come...I need to...John, if you don't stop....please, FUCK!" Sherlock came with a loud roar, echoing off the grotto walls and back to his ears. He shot out his come into John's mouth, growling when he felt John swallow around him. He moaned and groaned as John continued to suck.
Sherlock slowly turned his head to look at whomever was talking to him. It wasn't John, because John was.....Sherlock met his brother's eyes, and felt the sting of new tears. "Mycroft....." The one word, his name, was whispered, but full of such anguish and despair, such sadness, that Mycroft felt the tugging in his heart. He leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's shoulders. Sherlock went ramrod straight, but after a moment, sagged against Mycroft and let the tears flow. He sobbed hysterically into the shoulder of his brother, dropping the knife with a clatter to the floor and gripping his shoulders.
"Someone very important to my family is part of that regiment. I just wanted some information to pass along." He rubbed a hand through his immaculately combed hair and sighed. He had already asked Anthea that he needed a car to take him to Sherlock. Mummy had always stressed the importance of family in a crisis and he also felt some strange pull to go to him. "Thank you, Phil." He disconnected the call, not wanting to hear the fake well wishing or false sympathy. He didn't have time for either. He grabbed his umbrella and made for the door.
"So, it was up to me to determine how long the milk had been left on the counter, and once I had, it led me to the murderer. But enough about me, John. I want to hear about you." The edginess he was feeling melted away as John started talking about what they had been up to for the past week. Moving equipment, doing patrols. Dull. But, he liked hearing John talk. His voice, while not as low as his own, was soothing. Sherlock gripped the pillow as John's voice washed over him.
"Who's an idiot? I wasn't going to do anything more than say a few words to him! Geez, calm down and let me go!" He tried clawing at her grip, but she just continued to tighten it against his abdomen.
"Easy, Sherlock. I'm about ready to burst, and I want to make this last a little longer. I want you to put the phone on speaker. This is the week Mrs. Hudson is away, right?"
John cocked his head. "Sherlock? When I breached the surface, those men in the boat were calling for 'Your Highness.' Is Sherlock a nickname?"
Mycroft adjusted his lapels. "Unfortunately, yes. You seem frightened." He said it as fact, as she was used to people coming straight to the point with her.
John pushed him down on the bed, licking into his mouth and tweaking his nipples. Sherlock was being reduced to a quivering, moaning mess on the sheets. John licked his way down Sherlocks' neck, his chest,
He snarled at the phone and raised himself up on his knees. He pushed the hair out of his eyes and glanced at the screen. Mycroft. He scoffed halfheartedly and moved to get up.
John felt the blush creeping up his neck to flood his cheeks. The way Sherlock was looking at him made his heart and stomach do somersaults. When Sherlock leaned in for another kiss, John accepted with a smile. When Sherlock lowered his head, nipping on John's neck, his hands reaching towards John's nipples, a loud rumble echoed throughout the grotto. Being so close, John felt the heat coming from Sherlock's face. John pulled back, eyes searching.
John's mouth twitched. "I wasn't....I was.....well......hmm." John bit his lip and pondered what to say. He wasn't sure if he should tell this man about what he was, but then again, he trusted this man. He didn't
His heart had been broken in half. His other half was missing, possibly wounded, possibly dead, and all Sherlock could do was cry and scream into the expensive suit.
Sorry for the wait, everyone. But this went through 3 drafts that didn't feel right. I know it's short, but the next one will be a doozy. Enjoy :)
John wiped his eyes. "All I can say is that I feel that same way. I miss you. I miss hearing your voice everyday, or you playing the violin. I miss holding you in the night, and waking up to you every morning. I miss the way you call everyone an idiot, believe it or not. I just plain miss you. You're the missing piece of my heart."
John threw his head back against the wall. He was really starting to regret ever starting this. He wanted to be in their flat, fucking Sherlock until he couldn't walk. He wanted to taste Sherlock's cock in his mouth, taking him so deep that it hit the back of his throat. He wanted so badly to feel Sherlock buck and writhe against him as he came. He just had to make do with his hand. "Keep one nipple in your hand and take your cock in the other. I'm so close, and I need you to come with me. Now, Sherlock."
John swam on top of the water, trying to find something, anything, to alleviate his boredom. His long, lustrous tail propelled him towards nothing. His tail was nothing special, compared to the others. Merfolks weren't necessarily judged based on the colors of their tails, but it was a well known fact among his people that the more colorful your tail was, the more likeable you were.  His tail was golden brown, sinuous, powerful yet sleek, certain scales catching the light, making it appear that there were topaz jewels scattered along it. Not the most colorful, and therefore, not the most likable. Not that people liked him anyways.
Sherlock's eyes widened and his breath left him in a rush. Shot? Touch and go? Sherlock felt dizzy. His John, his everything, shot? He felt Mycroft push him into a chair and ask a faceless person for some water. Sherlock took a deep breath as the water was pushed into his hands.
But, he had to. John had to be the one to initiate the call, using a special service that military personnel had to use. He supposed it was so they couldn't reveal any secrets and so the government could spy on them. He needed to ask Mycroft to give John a special privelege, so they could video chat, uninterrupted....unsupervised...so they could....Sherlock shook his head. Focus! He sat in the chair, laptop across his knees, signed on, and waited.
He watched as the color drained out of his world. He felt the warmth leave his body, leaving nothing but a cold, empty shell.
Sherlock took his eyes off of the man, John, and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzziness. He was starting to feel just a tad too warm, despite the coolness of the rock he was sitting on. Sherlock clutched his head and shook it again. "Where am I?" He demanded.
It wasn't great, and the broken vase on the floor was Sherlock's feelings on the matter, but he did the best he could.
Sherlock stroked slowly up and down on his tail. He leaned in until their foreheads were practically touching. "I do," he said softly.
Sherlock watched the figure disappear and felt a wave of anxiety course through him. He scrambled up as quickly as his fuzzy head would allow without him vomiting, and peered over the edge. He didn't see any blood staining the surface, but it was too dark in...wherever they were to really see below the surface. He wanted the figure to come back, to ask it where he was and how he could get home. But more than that, Sherlock didn't want to be alone. As he strained his eyes to try and see farther below the surface, a face bobbed up and almost knocked heads with him. He let out a gasp as did the other figure.
John stopped struggling, but Molly didn't loosen her grip. John peered at her over his shoulder. "You don't understand, Molly."
Sherlock's moans were music to his ears. He came so hard down John's throat, and he tasted so good, John couldn't help but continue to suck and swallow, determined to savor everything that Sherlock was shooting into him. His nipples were so tight and he was so turned on. He wanted this moment to last forever. He always wanted to hear that growl that Sherlock made when he came, wanted always to taste him and feel his hands in his hair. He knew he would always want Sherlock.
He heard the DI sigh. "Not good. Can't get him to do a damn thing. Hasn't said a word, except to snap at us when we try to clean up. Any word on John?"
John rested his arms on his pulled up fin. "Anything. Why were those people calling you 'Your Highness?' Are you royalty? What's the surface like? Is it true that the sun shines all day and that there is never any bad weather? Are there only humans above or are there other kinds of life too? What do flowers smell like? What does-" A finger on John's lips halted the last question. Sherlock smiled at him, much like his father used to when he asked so many questions.
The tears rolled unchecked down his cheeks as he sobbed against his love's hand. He babbled nonsense words until his voice cracked, and even then, he clutched John's hand like the lifeline it was.
Lestrade had left, frustrated that Sherlock had belittled him again, but wasn't surprised. Since John had left, Sherlock had gotten a little worse. He was snappy, borderline bitchy, and he was almost desperate for a case. He constantly texted the DI, asking if there was anything new, anything old that he could maybe take a look through to see if there was anything different that jumped out at him. Lestrade had been annoyed, until he realized why Sherlock was acting this way. He was lonely. John was gone, and he was still having a hard time trying to function without him. He had been as accommodating as he could, but the criminals weren't just up to par. Lestrade shoved his hands in his coat pocket as he got closer to his car. Only a few more months and John would be home. Then everything would be okay. Lestrade started the car then sped away, back to New Scotland Yard with the new information that Sherlock had given him.
Sherlock went back to John's chair and sat down. He grabbed the pillow and hugged it to his chest. "Very tolerable, only...."
John was at the edge of his rope. Sherlock had been acting strange....well, stranger than usual. He had been unusually patient and attentive. And while John had appreciated and had basked in it while he knew it was going to last, there was something missing. While he had been healing, there hadn't been any sexual contact of any kind. He had craved the feeling of sweaty skin against his own, of hearing the heavy panting and deep moaning in his ear as he thrust his cock in and out of Sherlock's tight heat. But he was mostly missing the intimacy. He had missed Sherlock so much during his time in the military, and he had been hoping that when he was healed enough that he and Sherlock could share some sexy time, but he was two weeks after he was given the okay for strenuous activity, and Sherlock hadn't made any sort of move on him at all. He was getting desperate. The wanks he had been given himself in his seldom private moments were unsatisfying at best.  His balls were bluer than the ocean.
Sherlock walked outside, towards the docks, and spotted their Captain of the Guards, Gerry, or something like that, the man with the silver hair. He had heard the ladies in the village titter over the captain, commenting on his good looks, and seeing him this close up, he supposed he had a charm about him. His accent spoke of less formal language lessons, but he knew how to clean it up when appropriate. Still, even with the silver hair and his crinkly eyes, Sherlock had entertained the notion a time or two about trying to convince him to go into the broom closet for a quick shag. Simply for experimental purposes, of course.
Sherlock slapped a hand to his mouth after the gasp escaped him. When John had motioned for him to scoot back, he was confused. When John boosted himself up, he was a little excited. Okay.
He had heard the rush of air, but didn't move quick enough for the bullet. It had hit him in the shoulder, and the resulting pain made John cry out. His shoulder was burning, the flesh torn and jagged. His cry alerted his fellow soldiers, but before they could get to him to help, the building to their left had exploded, and everything was thrown into chaos.
He grabbed the Union Jack pillow and hugged it tight to his chest, heart clenching and tears streaming down his face.
"FUCK!" Sherlock's hips bucked, feeling John's mouth envelop his cock in a tight warm heat. "Oh God, John, what are you-fuck-fuck-fucking YES!" John's tongue swirled around the tip, lapping up the liquid and swallowing around it. He flattened his tongue on the red glans and sucked him deeper into his mouth until the tip bumped against the back of his throat. His hand started slowly pumped up and down, milking him while his mouth continued to bob up and down.
Sherlock inhaled sharply. John had promised phone sex the last time they had spoken, and it sounded like he was about to deliver. He cock hardened slightly. He willed his body to take it slow so he could savor how John was planning on taking him there. "Perhaps."
"That isn't good enough, Phil. I need answers. I need more than that. I need to know where the soldiers are. I know you know something."
Mycroft wasn't overly surprised to see Mrs. Hudson hovering at the bottom of the staircase leading to 221B, but it did when he saw the fear and sadness in her eyes.
John wiped the sweat of his forehead, deciding that he needed to shower. "I look forward to doing this again, though."
He wanted adventure, excitement, thrills. He wanted the blood pumping through his veins, making his very breath come out in shaky excitement. He wanted to help, to feel useful, to feel needed. But more than that, he wanted to share his wants with someone who also wanted the same things. He wanted to know that he could have a "partner in crime" of sorts. Someone who would be right by his side as he tried to catch his breath, and perhaps even take his breath away. He glanced over and saw Molly still eyeing him. He wanted so badly to reveal his inner feelings, but found he couldn't make his mouth move. A voice in his head told him that it would be a bad idea if he said anything.
Sherlock blinked. "You learned that by watching?" John nodded. "And I thought that I was a great observer." He ran a hand through his hair, remembering John's fingers running through it and gave a contented sigh. He slid his gaze over to John, but what he saw made him instantly go to his deducing mode: dilated pupils, having difficulty making eye contact, ragged breathing, but not from exhaustion; squirming, lip bit-He started back as the solution hit him in the face. John was aroused, not having found his release like Sherlock had. He cleared his throat to grab John's attention.
Such was the case at this moment. Sherlock and Molly were sitting at the edge of the swimming pool with their feet dangling in, looking across at a group of cackling teenagers.
Sherlock turned to face him and simply nestled against him, nuzzling his head into the space under his chin. When he spoke, his voice rumbled through John’s chest.
He sat down beside her without bothering with a greeting. Instead, he was calculating. He stared at the pitch, analysing each player of both teams, determining their chances of winning. If all went as expected, Westpark would likely overtake the visiting team in the last ten minutes of play, and Sherlock would be able to follow through with his plan.
Perhaps that was it. Perhaps the eager vilification of the innocent worker, the troubling psyche of Henry Booker, or the Yarders' crueler than usual treatment of Sherlock had brought up unpleasant memories from his childhood. But, sharing his suppositions with Sherlock would accomplish nothing other than to make the detective uncomfortable and withdrawn. John had been gifted the information from Sherlock's past, and he wouldn't wield that privilege lightly. He decided instead to focus on his intent: concern for Sherlock, not a desire to intrude or subject him to a layperson psychoanalysis.
John's bedroom at 221B was quiet, but not as quiet as usual. He could hear Sherlock's steady breaths, in and out. He felt the heart beating beneath his hand and felt the warmth in his own. He was truly happy. John drifted off to sleep: free from fear of nightmares, and secure in knowing Sherlock was safe in his arms.
John rotated onto his back, turning to finally see Sherlock's face in the dim light. His curls were sleep tussled and beautiful, his eyes bright, his gorgeous bowed lips just begging to be kissed.
"We're not fighting, Sherlock, you were sleepwalking and I accidentally startled you. You're alright?"
"So, Sherlock," John ventured, curious and still a little concerned about the night before, "did you sleep OK last night?"
He was fine. There was no patient waiting for him. No wounded soldier bleeding out while John floundered about in the wrong hospital. It was just a dream. He had spent the last few weeks so worried about Sherlock's nocturnal problems that he had almost forgotten about his own. He almost forgot how familiar it was to wake up confused, to not remember where he was. What it was like to watch the veil of the dream recede, leaving in its wake a bland reality that he was nonetheless relieved to return to.
John's back was turned so he didn't see the brief flash of anxiety in Sherlock's eyes when he glanced up as John went to make something for breakfast.
Just then, a young girl approached Molly and spoke to her in the native's language, she responded then the child gleefully returned to the old lady she had been sitting with.
John's bed was rather small for two grown men, so in order to keep a bit of space between them, he was pressed back towards the cold wall, the edge of the duvet riding up to let in the draft of the room. He wiggled a little, trying to get comfortable, trying not to wake Sherlock. He inched away from the cold wall just a little. Then he inched a tiny bit more, closer into the warmth of Sherlock's back. The duvet settled behind him, blocking out the cold room.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked away, but not before the doctor saw the flash of conflict cross his flatmate's face. John recognized it as the look he had when he wanted to seem indifferent, unreachable, but he was, in fact, considering what John just said. It was like John had lobbed a mysterious parcel over Sherlock's protective walls and he was carefully examining the suspicious item to make sure it wasn't a bomb. John waited patiently.
John seemed more nervous than usual, carrying a certain energy that made the atmosphere somewhat uncomfortable. Sherlock chocked it up to residual awkwardness from their tense exchange the evening before. John had been rather rough in his treatment of Sherlock, and the human had several circular red markings on his chest and neck to show for it. They were just burst blood vessels beneath the skin where John's suckers had gripped too firmly, there was no pain, Sherlock was not angry. He knew John felt remorse for it, as evidenced by the way his octopod eyes glanced down more than was customary when they sat together on the beach.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows even more, as if in disbelief, yet still somehow managed a cold distance in his stare.
“So.” Sherlock gestured vaguely at his own feet before deciding to skip the explanation and lying down on the stone floor.
There was a tap on the window. Startled, Sherlock walked over and opened it, letting a sleek black-and-white magpie through. It swept across the room and perched itself at the foot of his own bed, dropping a tiny scroll from its beak.
Sherlock was upstairs almost as soon as the front door opened. John knew he would be occupied with his new ‘toy’ for a few hours, so instead of following him, he stood in the foyer.
Sherlock definitely wasn’t your typical boy. Not that John had very extensive knowledge of how other boys reacted to physical affection. But if romantic Sherlock was anything like everyday Sherlock, John didn’t know what he might’ve thought about their kiss. He had no idea what to expect in Hogsmeade, or beyond that.
When Sherlock came, it was with a loud thump on the wall as his arms stretched out and his hands--now joined into a ball of fists--hit the headboard. John looked up at him in surprise. He could feel a bit of come about to drip from his chin.
Next, with tea in hand, breakfast meant small, reluctant smiles, quick kisses over toast, and Sherlock's insistence that John stay home that day. John reminded him every morning he was there that he was going to Bart's next year, and if he actually wanted to get a degree, he should probably keep working towards it. He would also point out how it would do Sherlock good to find time in his own busy schedule to get to his classes.
Sherlock scoffed as though it were completely obvious. “Be safe,” he said, sarcasm dripping from the corners of his smile.
"Exactly. I can’t believe it took you so long. I should've known I would have to take matters into my own hands."
Mycroft hung up the phone with a decisive click, rubbing his eyes as he did so. He sat back in his chair and sipped his drink. John was on his way home, as long as he stayed stable for the next forty-eight hours.
As he had done every night since John went away, Sherlock turned the telly on to the news. He didn't particularly want to watch it, or even listen to it for that matter, but since he couldn't always talk to John and hear that he was okay, he had to settle for the evening news. He had trained his brain over the last few months to listen for particular key words from the announcers' voice: "Afghanistan" "Fusiliers" and "British Armed Forces." Any mention of those words had Sherlock's brain running into overdrive and screamed at him to focus on what the man was saying. It always ended up being something dull, like they had moved so many kilometers, or this is what it was like in the day of a soldier, but it took a few moments for the heart pounding fear to leave Sherlock.
John's eyes widened and he scooted away. "No, that won't be nece-that is, you don't have to-well, I, uh.....no, it's-it's okay."
The right side of Sherlock's mouth twitched into a small smile. "Sherlock." He wasn't sure why he left off his title, but his intuition had told him to do that. His intuition was rarely wrong.
When John received the okay from the doctor that he was allowed to return home, Sherlock wasted no time bundling him up and whisking him away back to Baker Street.
God, he wanted a cigarette. He refrained, as he had made a promise to John that he wouldn't smoke, but the old itch of wanting one in stressful times was crawling on his skin.
