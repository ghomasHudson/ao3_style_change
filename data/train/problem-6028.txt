“Everybody out!” he yelled, turning the lights on and pulling open the door. “Cap and Tony are about to start fucking and I don’t wanna be here for that.”
“It was both our faults, Peter,” said Steve. Despite his feelings for Tony right now, Tony was still Peter’s father, and Peter shouldn’t have a negative image of him, especially when they were equally at fault. “Your father did spend more than we brought in, but that was only because he found it difficult to go back to work after we adopted you. Then I started spending more time at work, I didn’t really give your father as much attention as I should have… it just got worse and worse.”
“That was quick,” Steve commented, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist as they sat down, ready to hear the winners. “I can’t wait to see what stupid shit Ty says up there.”
Steve simply shrugged. “I mean… I know we haven’t had a perfect marriage in a while, and I’ll admit we’re equally to blame. But I also know we’re willing to work on it, and we don’t want to leave each other; that’s why we’re here in the first place. Why can’t we just say we’re sorry and… move on?”
“No, Tony!” said Steve quickly, stumbling over his words to try and get Tony to see the point. “I've been reading
shit,” Tony gritted out. He tried once more to restart the gauntlet of the Iron Man armour, but no dice. It was deader than they would be in a couple of hours if they didn’t
“Not tonight, Tony,” Steve grumbled, flopping onto a pillow a couple of weeks later. “I’m not in the mood.”
Steve looked around him. Everyone did seem a bit more harried and stressed than usual, Tony especially. Only Clint was relaxing on the couch, but then again, practically nothing could ever faze Clint.
And, speak of the devil, Ty Stone walked past them at that exact moment, ‘accidentally’ elbowing Steve in the ribs. Ty was one of the few people in their school who was both bigger and stronger than Steve — he’d been on the school football team for five years now, and held back twice. By all rights, he should’ve graduated two years ago.
“If you want to,” he said, picking up one of Tony’s bags as well as his own. He gave Tony a second to reconsider, and then, at his slight nod, began carrying their luggage inside, feeling the weight on his chest lift a little bit.
Steve giggled weakly at that, and the couple fell into a companionable silence, Tony tracing every bruise and bump and stitch on Steve’s body with his fingertips. He leaned down and pressed a kiss to a scratch on Steve’s forehead
Steve had loved reading for as long as he could remember. A pale, scrawny and sickly child, Steve had spent most of his childhood in bed or in the hospital, where all he had for entertainment were his beloved books. Even in the little time he wasn’t sick, he was too weak to be able to play with the other children and join in their rambunctious games, and he spent every recess period reading quietly in the library.
“We did, but Fury’s not very happy with you,” sighed Tony. “He’s sent you about twenty ‘I told you so’ messages.”
“Tony!” Tony paused his monologue abruptly at Steve’s tone. He looked around them, and Steve noticed how quickly he lost steam as the crowd stood around them with phones and cameras on full blast. He had no doubt this would be the top headline tomorrow — Avengers power couple already on rocky road to divorce?
“You’re not that bad,” said Steve loyally. He’d always defend Tony, even to Tony. “Just a few too many drinks last night.”
“Urgent Avengers business,” Tony murmured to Sandy and Noel, who moved out of their way, alarmed. Steve was a little alarmed as well, but he couldn’t say a word until Tony had dragged him into a thick clump of trees behind the marquee.
,” growled Steve, stalking over to the bed. He grabbed the collar of Tony’s shirt and pulled him in for a kiss.
?” Clint asked in a stage whisper as the Avengers sat in the marquee getting final touch-ups to their hair and makeup. “‘Bake Off’ sounds weird.”
I wouldn’t notice you don’t sleep in the same bed anymore?” Peter’s voice cracked a little then, but he held in his tears as only a teenage boy could. “Please just… get divorced already. I can deal with two parents, but I can’t deal with… whatever this is.” A small sob escaped him, one he couldn’t hold in.
As Fury muttered his congratulations and placed the crown on Steve’s head, Steve could see, among the throngs of people, Ty Stone growling furiously, a smashed punch glass next to him. He was waving his arm menacingly at his posse, who seemed respectfully terrified, and that, more than anything, sealed the deal for Steve. He grinned down at the crowd, finally letting it sink in. He was Homecoming King! He could see Tony blowing kisses to him from the crowd, mouthing “I’m so proud of you, babe!”
Steve showed him, trying to hide his pain at even that small movement, and Tony proceeded to lay his leg on a pile of blankets he’d grabbed from god knows where. “Shouldn’t be any pressure,” he mumbled to himself. Steve closed his eyes, just for a moment, but he was dazed and woozy and when he opened them again, the room was much darker and, out of nowhere, Tony was at Steve’s side again. He smiled when he saw Steve’s open eyes
“They’re my kids’ favourite, I make ‘em all the time,” he said, swooping a hand through his hair for the cameras. He shot Mary a cheeky smile as well, making her blush.
“Alright, Avengers!” said Mary, clapping her hands, “Please stand ready with your pies; Nick and I will be coming around to judge them individually.”
Tony pulled away from Steve for about two seconds, exasperated. “Who gives a shit about that right now?” he said, and then sunk to his knees, pulling at Steve’s belt buckle.
“I can't wait to marry you either,” laughed Steve, his eyes glinting as he reached for Tony’s hand, “But there’s just one small problem.”
. Just because I want to get this done and not fail, Steve Rogers, you are the best baker slash Avenger.”
“No can do, Stark,” said Clint, cradling the mug protectively between his hands. “You should’ve kept some in stock.” He gulped the entire mug down in one go, smirking at Tony. “Whoops.”
“Come on, we were doing so well, Steve. That was terrible.” Steve laughed, pulling Tony into another kiss, feeling that giddy rush of happiness he only ever felt around Tony.
Immediately Tony was at his side, holding his son to his chest. “Oh honey…” He shook his head, tears threatening to spill from his own eyes as well.
“You don’t get to bake at all this week,” said Noel, rubbing his hands with glee. “Alright, who wants to go first?”
“Oh my god,” Tony choked out, his hands over his mouth. “Please don’t tell me you actually went and asked Peter for his
“Today, you’re going to make a traditional pie, with any flavours or fillings you like,” said Mary Berry, her clear voice holding everyone’s attention. “This is your chance to show off your creativity and personality in your food. Make it as wild and as exotic as you like! The only requirement is that it tastes good.”
The crowd broke into their loudest cheer yet, and Steve heard random phrases from the crowd. “You two are the cutest couple ever!” “We stan gay boys!” “Kiss already!” “You guys make me believe in love!” Suddenly, he knew exactly how he and Tony had won.
Steve woke up entirely too quickly, roused by the groaning that seemed loud enough to wake the dead. Steve stumbled quickly out of bed, or the couch if you were to be pedantic, rushing towards Tony and trying to rub the exhaustion out of his eyes.
I’ve definitely watched the show before; all of us Avengers watch it together. It's our comfort show, really, after a long battle or a day of training. I’d say we’ve watched every season at least twice. I love the Great British Baking Show and I’m honoured to be here.
“There you go, treating me like a child again!” Peter huffed. “Tell me what happened, Papa, please.”
“Is that not what you were looking for?” asked Thor, confused. “They are meant to be “brown”, are they not, as is in the name?”
Now, Tony couldn’t help noting the irony of having his first real date after having his heart broken… in the same place that he’d had his heart broken, down to the very same table and waitress. Tony had switched sides, not wanting to have to deal with all of those memories once more.
Steve frowned. “The son he never— what about you? You’re his son. I’ve heard about how much of a genius you were as a child, I mean, a circuit board at age four? That’s brilliant, Tony. Howard must have been so proud.” Tony laughed, but there was no humor in it; it was cold and a touch hysterical.
“Can you believe we both won?” said Tony dreamily, resting his head on Steve’s broad chest. “I’m so proud of you, baby.”
“You almost died because of me,” said Tony, his voice low now, with no trace of amusement in it. “The least I can do is help you feel better.”
“I got you,” he said, quiet and soothing, and he fed Tony the pills and water he’d kept ready last night. Tony gulped the whole bottle down, resting his head back onto the pillow with a groan.
Fury immediately moved to Thor in the second row, and Mary followed him, hesitating. Thor graciously cut both judges a slice of his pie… which looked almost perfect. Steve’s jaw dropped at the shock of seeing Thor’s perfectly cooked-through pie, with a wonderfully soft filling and a delicious crust. Even from a few stations away, he could tell Thor’s pie would be one of the best tonight. Fury did not look at all happy about the result, but Mary was in raptures, praising Thor’s work. Steve privately resolved to ask Thor to share his lightning-cooking skills with him next time.
“Well, you’re not wrong.” The attention had turned away from them now, the cameras rushing to interview the other Avengers for their views on this stunning twist. Steve pulled Tony closer, slightly bolder now that they were in private, and kissed him softly. “You’re as sweet as my apple pie, Tony Stark.”
“Thor, humans can’t eat that,” sighed Fury before following Mary, and Tony leaned over to give the confused Thor a pat on the shoulder.
Steve rolled his eyes, not wanting to give his boyfriend the satisfaction of that horrible joke. “I did think you were a horrible father,” he admitted. “I mean, what kind of father lets his one-year-old son, who could barely even walk then, get away from him that fast? Anyone could have picked him up and run away, he was just lucky he fell on me. The whole time I was cleaning him up, I thought his father would be one of the worst I’d see.” Steve laughed. “And then I spent one day with Peter and took back everything I ever thought about you.”
He was so beautiful that Steve could barely hear what he was saying, too absorbed in taking in this gorgeous man to his fill. When he finally did register what Tony had said, Steve almost spat his mouthful of hot chocolate over him, which would have been a waste since it really did taste amazing.
“You’re welcome.” said Steve with a shy smile, not fully tamping down on the delicious surge of pleasure he felt. So maybe the shitty “how to make someone like you” website wasn’t wrong after all — handmade gifts really did work magic.
“My, Captain, these do look nice,” said Mary, stunned, She lifted a perfect brownie square with her fingers, examining it from all angles. “Is that cheesecake?”
“I’m sorry,” said Tony, suddenly. Steve stared at him in surprise, and Tony continued to babble on. “Peter was right, and you’re right. We came all the way here to fix things between us… but we haven’t even apologized to each other yet. I’m sorry, Steve, for not being more supportive when you were killing yourself for us, and I’m sorry I accused you of—” Tony flushed, too embarrassed to even admit that was what he’d assumed his husband was doing. “I — I should’ve been a better husband. Apparently, I’m even worse at that than I am at being a father.”
“Alright, bakers, time’s up,” called Mary, her soft voice immediately followed by Nick Fury’s distinctive growl.
If he thought the day would get better after breakfast, he was sadly mistaken. Peter stayed shut up in his room all day, only emerging to grab a few snacks now and again, and making sure  to keep out of his parents’ way. He looked sullen and despondent, a perfect image of how Steve felt. Tony, for his part, kept to the kitchen and the living room, but made no effort to communicate with Steve other than occasional sentences like “Could you pass me the remote?”. This was not what Steve had envisioned for this weekend.
“He’s the only family member you have left, of course I had to ask him.” Steve laughed wetly, pulling Tony into a hug. “I asked Rhodey and Pepper too, if it makes you feel any better.”
“Most babies do tend to be soft,” said Tony dryly, but even he couldn’t help smiling as Peter waved a vague hand out of his blanket. He’d just been fed and he was happy and alert, looking up at his new fathers with curious blue eyes. “I can’t believe anyone could give him up.”
“Oh, spiderling, you have so much to learn about the reality TV industry,” said Natasha, patting his head gently.
“Look, they’ve opened the votes for King and Queen.” Tony squealed excitedly. “You wanna go vote, Steve?”
He shoved himself quickly and erratically into Steve, trying to maximize his pleasure so they could be done before a nurse or doctor came in. Steve’s cries of pleasure increased, even though he hadn’t gotten hard at all, and Tony thrust even harder at the one point he knew would drive Steve crazy. He continued thrusting inside of Steve even as he reached his peak, enjoying the oversensitivity.
“And that’s why we’re here,” smiled Steve. “To have a little alone time before I have to leave.” He kissed Tony, soft and gentle. “Today’s a good day. We’re going to be happy together. No more talking about tomorrow or next week or anything past today.”
“We’re leaving in another forty-eight hours, I don’t see much point in unpacking,” said Tony coldly, and turned back to his coffee. Steve sighed and left the kitchen, taking his mug with him.
“How do you just… lose the serum?” Tony thundered, storming up and down the medical bay. The doctors had left after several hours of running tests and experiments, and they would take a while to return with the results. “What the fuck is Loki up to?”
“So what’re you reading today?” Tony asked, wiping his hands on a towel and leaning on the counter. He looked so beautiful, Steve nearly felt his heart stop.
“I thought we weren’t going to talk about it?” Steve asked, but he smiled at Tony. “I… I tried. But I couldn’t stop…” he took a deep breath “You broke up with me, Tony. That kind of stuff tends to hurt.”
right then, his eyes half-closed and the sun’s rays spilling onto his face. He looked every inch like a Renaissance painting, and really, Steve couldn’t be blamed for what he did next.
“Well that’s a goddamn surprise.” Tony’s eyebrows were raised so high, they almost disappeared into his hair. “When was the last time Captain America burnt anything?”
Everyone’s eyes were on them for the first dance, and Steve focused on not tripping over himself or trampling on Steve’s feet. He let Tony, who had more experience with this sort of thing, lead them while he turned, and soon enough, the dance floor was filled with couples gazing into each others’ eyes.
“I know, I know, Tony, I’m so sorry.” said Steve soothingly, hugging Tony harder than ever and running a comforting hand up and down his back. “You’re being so brave, Tony. I’m so proud of you.”
“And you feel great because you’re pumped to the brim with morphine,” said Cho severely, “Tell me if you feel the same when it wears off.”
. He knew the episode wouldn’t air for a couple of months, at the very least… but he couldn’t help but be surprised at his own daring.
“Whatever,” Peter mumbled again. He stuffed the last spoonful of cornflakes into his mouth, and then pushed the bowl away, pushing his chair back at the same time. “May I be excused?” He didn’t wait for an answer, just ran back to his room and slammed the door.
“Well, we’re fucked,” said Tony simply, handing the phone back to Noel. Steve, for his part, was still shocked, his heart having dropped to the bottom of his combat boots. They’d been seen cheating. They’d been
“Just tryin’ to make my country proud, ma’am,” he said, putting on his most charismatic manner, learned from years of being a public idol. It wasn’t wasted on Mary Berry, who flushed and had to hide her giggles. Nick Fury just stared at him, unimpressed.
Steve clenched his hands, having to hold himself from crushing Tony’s fingers to dust. Tony winced, but gave Steve a sympathetic pat on the shoulder. The suspense really was excruciating.
“How am I a billionaire but I only have one bottle of perfume in this entire goddamn tower?” he mumbled, clutching the bottle tightly. “Fine.” He held his breath as Pepper sprayed it on strategic areas of his body, looking down to avoid their pitying glances.
“Oh,” was all he said as he and Tony pulled away from each other. He raised a hand to his lips, which still seemed to be tingling. “Oh.”
“Steve, it’s a castle!” he exclaimed, waving his hands around and almost smacking a poor teenage girl on the nose. She gave them a confused look and moved on as Tony continued to ramble. “And I don’t mean it’s not beautiful, but when you’ve seen one old ruined building, you’ve seen ‘em all.”
“What is it, Tony?” he said, glancing behind him. Tony’s suit, which everyone had told him not to wear, was streaked with flour and wet dough.
The judges moved quickly to Tony’s stations, barely pausing to admire its beautiful blue crust before cutting a slice and gulping it down. Steve gave Tony a surreptitious thumbs-up to show him that he’d noticed the intricate arc reactor design on top, even if the judges hadn’t.
“I know, I know it’s not that great,” said Steve defeatedly. “I redid it a million times but it never really turned out right, and I know I should've got you something better, but—” Steve was cut off as Mr. Stark pressed a hand to his mouth.
“Love? Me?” Tony’s voice was a little strangled. “He barely even saw me. I doubt he ever changed a diaper or fed me or even carried me more times than he could count on one hand. He was always so absorbed in his
Say what you wanted about Steve Rogers, but the one thing he really did care about was his dignity. And he was more than willing to make a fool of himself for Tony, but not when he knew that this was clearly a lost cause.
“It suits you,” Tony agreed, also not making eye contact. “So, uh… you didn’t do that well either, huh?”
wanted to snuggle up into his side, but he resisted. They were the co-leaders of the Avengers, and this was only the team’s second mission together. He couldn’t let Steve see him as weak.
“We were,” said Tony, trying to pull Steve’s body back towards his own. “Doesn’t mean I’m not gonna win.”
“Trying to help each other because you are both hopelessly in love,” said Mary impatiently. “I understand.” She sighed, unsure of what to say next.
The girls won’t know what hit them.” He giggled happily as he signed his name on the pink sheet, and Steve, staring at Tony with more love than he’d ever felt for anyone, decided that he’d follow this man to the ends of the earth.
Steve just shrugged, and Tony remembered it then. The mysterious stranger’s profile, which had so clearly and blatantly stated that they were ambivalent about kids, and preferred not having them. “You’re joking.”
“I wish you didn’t have to leave tomorrow,” Tony mumbled, feeling buoyed by the fact that he wasn’t looking directly at Steve. “SHIELD’s doing this to us on purpose, I swear.”
Tony needed to keep Steve around, after all, if he wanted to keep having such wonderfully amazing, mind-blowing sex.
Steve really was in pain, a lot of it. He appreciated the wisdom Natasha and Cho had in making him stay here. But he was Steve Rogers. He was never going to admit that, not to anyone.
“We need to cause a distraction,” Tony hissed, and Steve very much agreed. The only question was how they would do that.
Today, for once, Tony was hanging around the battle scene, but not because of any desire to help. He and the other Avengers were frantically digging around in the rubble for any sign of their lost teammate and leader. Steve wouldn’t be Captain America if he didn’t try to do something heroic and end up almost killing himself every mission.
“Shut up, Tony.” Steve groaned. Somehow, this little TV baking show had gotten him more stressed than anything else he’d done as an Avenger. He took a deep breath and rubbed a hand over his face, thinking. He had no brownie batter left, but there was still some of the cheesecake topping. If he could bake that, maybe pass it off as an obscure 1940’s dish.
“I’d ask you to get a cup of coffee with me, but I think that’d be a little overkill, huh?” laughed Tony, poking at Steve’s half-empty cup. He looked so happy, so content, that Steve felt a sudden rush of courage. Before he could think about it, he leaned over the table and pressed his lips to Tony’s.
“I love you, Tony,” said Steve simply, ignoring the burning in his throat. “I love you and I don’t know what’ll happen to us but I know I want to keep you around forever. And Peter.”
“It’s still the best day of my life,” mumbled Tony, his breath tickling Steve’s nose and making him giggle. “Probably the best day of Peter’s life too.”
“Not really. But that’s how your fans are going to see it, so I guess—” Nick trailed off, scowling. “I’m not gonna say it.”
“Ma would’ve loved him,” Steve sighed. “She probably loved me a little too much, too, but she’d be proud that I grew up well enough to have a son. “ He leaned over the seat to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “She’d have loved you too, Tony.”
Tony fisted at the little hairs at the back of Steve’s neck, pressing one last, tiny kiss to his lips before pulling away. They stared at each other, flushed and breathless, eyes twinkling with happiness.
“No, Peggy, I died,” said Steve quietly, his face pained. “Lost B’cky too. Come back, please.” It took a couple of seconds, but Tony finally understood what he meant.
“That’s... actually not half bad,” said Mary, looking around to Nick like she’d discovered a new anti-aging secret. “It could boost our popularity with the younger crowd, too.”
He turned the shower on, letting it spill on Tony and the suit — the thing was already ruined, and Steve doubted Tony would ever have worn it again anyway. He was simply too refined for such pedestrian acts as wearing the same clothes more than once.
,” said Mary, cutting in smoothly, “We’ve only got eight contestants, and this is definitely not the worst mistake I’ve seen celebrities make on this show, Mr. Fury. Thor may remain in the competition.”
Taking the hint, Tony leaned over Steve, kissing him gently. He started off slow, not wanting to exhaust Steve’s body too much, but a couple of minutes in, he’d started to thrust harder and harder, the thrill of having sex with a new body for the first time in a few years making it all the more exciting. Clenching his hands in Steve’s hair and using it as leverage, he drove himself harder, working on Steve’s body at the same time. This wasn’t as intense as their usual routine, but Tony couldn’t pretend that the sight of Steve skinny and defenseless under him didn’t turn him on a little bit.
Steve stared happily at Tony, not even minding when Natasha whacked him in the head. He knew he was maybe being a little too obvious with his attraction, but could anyone blame him? It was
At any other time, Steve would have recognized the danger signs, the fact that Fury’s tone menat he was more pissed off than Steve had ever seen him before. In his hurry to see whatever had caused the commotion, however, Steve didn’t notice, quickly pulling the phone from Tony’s hands.
“This year’s Homecoming King, by an overwhelming majority of votes, is… STEVE ROGERS!” Fury yelled into the microphone. The crowd exploded into cheers, and Steve was frozen to his seat, shocked.
“It is time for the last dance of the evening,” Fury announced, sounding relieved that he was finally done here. “The dance will be opened by our newly-crowned Homecoming King and Queen!”
“Fine,” grumbled Tony, burying himself into Steve’s chest again. He took the mug Bruce handed him, making a face but drinking it all down without complaint. “Tea and then cuddles.”
Steve spluttered, lost for words, and Tony just glared at Clint. Bruce piped up from where he was seated on the floor. “You can stay, Clint, they’re not gonna try anything when we’re around.”
“And we’re sorry we hurt you, sweetheart,” said Steve tenderly, rubbing a hand through Peter’s messy brown hair. “You’re right, we haven’t thought about you at all, in any of this. We haven’t really been great parents to you, have we?”
“It’s actually because of a copyright issue,” Tony piped up from his chair. He had by far the biggest crowd around him; even Wanda, who was so nervous her hair was almost static with red frizz and magic, didn’t have as many people primping and preening around her as Tony did. Steve, who’d spent the best part of the last six months making heart eyes in Tony’s general direction, gave it up when he could barely see the man for the stylists surrounding him. “Or, not copyright really, it’s more of a trademark issue. Pillsbury owns the right to the term ‘bake-off’ in the US and Canada because they have their own bake-off that’s been running a lot longer than this one.”
Dinner was not a happy meal. Peter had been forced out of his room — “We’re a family, and we’re going to eat together” — but the atmosphere was tense and awkward. Peter alternated between playing despondently with his food, and shovelling down mouthfuls so he could leave as quickly as possible. Steve didn’t have the heart to correct his table manners, not when the tension between him and Tony was so thick, they could cut it with a knife.
“I—” Steve was wildly confused. Not only had he not thought of telling Tony, the idea that he needed to involve Tony in this at all was not something he had considered. “But if I ask him, he’ll say no.” He looked up at Natasha pleadingly. “I can’t risk that.”
They spent the rest of the day that way, alone in a quiet corner of the park under the shade of the big tree where they’d first met. It was a wonderful spring day, one that could almost have come out of a book. After they’d eaten the sandwiches Steve had made them — he’d even remembered the extra mayo for Tony — Tony rested his head on Steve’s thigh, lazy and lethargic and content as Steve sketched a picture of the green park. Even Tony, who was nowhere near artistically inclined, agreed that the picture of the sun shining through the trees, broken up by the leaves and falling to the ground in scattered rays, was a beautiful image. It almost looked like a stock picture with how perfect it was.
“Well, you’re a great friend to have at your sickbed, Thor, that’s for sure.” Thor beamed, apparently mistaking Steve’s sarcasm for a genuine compliment, and Tony suddenly remembered why he’d fallen for the man in the first place.
“How’d I end up with someone as understanding as you?” smiled Tony. He grabbed onto Steve’s hand, hiding it under a pillow between them, and Steve felt comforted by that small gesture of comfort, at least.
Steve looked over at Tony, who glanced back at him. They knew what had happened, but Steve doubted he’d be able to explain it in a way that made sense to Peter. Hell, sometimes it didn’t even make sense to
“I don’t have to have an orgasm to enjoy this,” said Tony, flipping them over so that Steve was now on the bottom. He peppered kisses all the way down Steve’s body, making sure to pause and explore all the new spots he hadn’t known before, spending an inordinate amount of time on Steve’s now-nonexistent pecs. He bit at his nipples maybe a little more harshly than usual, enjoying the pained gasp that Steve let out at that.
Tony’s head fell onto Steve’s shoulder as they drove, half-asleep but alert. Steve rubbed a soothing hand up and down Tony’s arm, and Tony smiled dopily.
Clint opened his fat mouth to reply, but Natasha slapped a hand over it, not even flinching when Clint started licking at it wetly. “Ignore him,” she said smoothly. “But you do need to tell Tony, Steve. It’s his Tower, after all, and he’s letting us live here rent-free. The least we could do is tell him if we bring someone new in.”
“I’m sorry, Sir, but you’re not allowed to override his commands if that would lead to a destruction of your health.”
“I’ll leave you two alone,” smiled the nurse. “Don’t over-excite him Mr. Stark; I’ve never seen a patient with worse blood pressure than his.” Tony paid no attention to her, stroking Steve’s hair as the nurse left, shutting the door behind her.
Steve looked down at Tony, whose head was resting on his thigh, and smiled. He couldn’t help it; Tony looked so wonderfully
“It’s a long story,” Tony said, turning away and walking further behind the counter. Steve’s heart fell for a split second, before he noticed that Tony had taken his apron off and was now walking back towards Steve. “How about I tell you over a cup of hot chocolate?”
Clint and Tony seemed focused on the process, but they were way, way behind Steve; still at the stage of measuring ingredients out. Steve grinned to himself; he had this competition in the bag.
Tony cut into the conversation just then, breaking up any further discussion. “As much as I’d love to have another cheating scandal on my resume, the thing’s over, we won. That’s it. Get over yourself, losers.” He shot Steve a brilliant smile, which had him blushing even harder. “And lay off the Captain, you’re making his all-American morals go crazy.”
“You’re gonna lose,” Steve whispered, making sure to brush his arm on Tony’s as he walked past. Tony shuddered for a second, and then seemed to double his speed. He had done shaping his loaf within seconds, quickly popping it into a pan and into the oven.
As he’d expected, Tony was still awake, looking a little bit worse for wear. His eyes were manic and tired at the same time, and his clothes were stained with grease and coffee stains from probably more than the recommended daily amount.
“Clint’s were probably better, though,” Tony sighed, resting his elbows on the counter. “At least they were edible… in a way. And it was original, and looked good.”
Tony, who just moments ago seemed ready to fight, now slumped against his bed. “I did what I thought was right.”
And Tony sympathized with Steve, he really and truly did, but… he was also a man with needs. And even seeing Steve in this state, broken and small and tired, well… he was still the hottest man in the world to Tony.
,” said Peter, his smile vanishing as quickly as it came. “You both know what happened, and you both admit you’re wrong… why can’t you just say you’re sorry and make up?”
“It… doesn’t taste that bad,” he said, a note of surprise clear in his voice. “Mr. Stark, why haven’t you let me have this before?”
Tony just gaped at him, looking stunned and exhausted at the same time. Steve felt a little bad for dumping this on him when he was hungover, but a man had to explode at some point.
“Tony, that is horrible,” said Steve, bluntly. He felt the beginnings of a familiar heat stir in his stomach, the same heat that had gotten him into so much trouble as a little shrimp in the streets of Brooklyn. “Howard… I always thought he was a nice guy. I didn’t realize—”
The air around them exploded with cheers, and Steve pulled Tony into a bear hug. “We won. Officially.”
“Steve, focus,” Natasha hissed, tucking a few stray strands of blond hair behind Steve’s ear. “We’re gonna be on TV. You don’t want the paparazzi seeing this, do you?”
” Steve called out behind them, still blushing hard as Natasha and Bruce left, shutting the door behind them. Steve buried his head in Tony’s shoulder, too embarrassed to enjoy their solitude.
“And it’s gorgeous, Steve,” said Tony fiercely. “And I can tell by the lack of a frame that you thought I was just gonna hide this away, but this is going front and center on my desk tomorrow. Or on Monday, I guess.” He paused for a second. “Thank you,” he said sincerely, looking Steve directly in the eye. “This is the best birthday gift I’ve gotten in… well, years.”
“It’s healthier for you,” Bruce piped up. “It’s not as dehydrating, and the caffeine is less intense, so consuming tea means your blood pressure gets more stable.”
“I’ve read every book they have in the store,” Tony replied, kindly not making fun of Steve, who just stared at him in shock. “I’m guessing you didn’t know?”
“Ow!” Tony yelled as his pillow pulled away and his head fell to the ground. Rubbing his sleep-bleary eyes, he turned around to glare at Steve. “Why couldn't you give me a fucking—” And then he saw the sight in front of him, and his jaw dropped.
“So we don’t actually get to bake today?” asked Bruce wistfully. He was the only one who seemed to be prepared for a baking contest, wearing sensible shoes and a regular t-shirt and jeans, standing in stark contrast to the others, who were wearing ten-thousand-dollar business suits (Tony) or their superhero outfits (everyone else).
“I’m sorry I wasn’t paying enough attention to you, Steve, but right now, Pepper and the company are maybe just a
“Alright, Avengers!” A smooth voice floated over to where the eight Avengers were gathered, and as if by instinct, every head turned to the entrance of the tent, where Nick Fury was silhouetted in all his glory. Besides him, Mary Berry seemed small, almost delicate. The hosts, Noel and Sandi, looked excited at being in the presence of the Avengers.
“I will,” said Tony, his eyes shining as he slipped an arm through Steve’s and led him to the sign-up table. “Or, actually, maybe I’ll sign up for Homecoming
Tony spent a good forty-five minutes in the shower, rubbing every single bit of dirt and grime he could feel off his skin. In a way it was like compensating for the whirling of his brain – if he couldn’t wipe the memories out of his head, he could at least
“Tony,” said Steve gently, carding a hand through his mop of messy brown hair. He pressed a long slow kiss to Tony’s hairline, burying his nose into the comforting smell of Tony. “I’ll be back in a couple of weeks.”
“Oh yeah,” smiled Steve. The couple stopped a few yards before the bank, focused intently at a particular clump of dirt.
“And, in first and second place, because we found it very hard to choose between them, are Captain Rogers and Tony Stark!” said Mary excitedly, and Steve, despite knowing this was coming, couldn’t help the wave of happiness he felt. He pulled Tony into a hug, almost lifting him off the floor in his enthusiasm.
Although you couldn’t blame Tony, really. In the short gaps of time between staring at Steve, when he was actually working on his bread dough, Steve almost gave in to the urge to just… drop everything and ogle Tony. He may not have been as powerfully built as Steve was, but he was pretty muscular, as he had to be to pilot the Iron Man as regularly as he did. And the sight of those muscled arms working at the dough, flexing and stretching as they worked the dough into submission… it was doing
“We gotta work on your improv skills, buddy,” said Steve, patting Thor’s shoulder as his husband turned the full force of his wrath on Clint. Clint yelped and leaped on top of the refrigerator, Tony screaming a medley of swears and curses at him.
“Not a big fan of animals the Other Guy could crush,” was his only explanation, and none of the others asked for details.
“I made it worse, didn’t I?” Peter buried his head in his hands. “If you hadn’t adopted me, you wouldn’t have any money troubles, and you’d be happily married right now.”
Steve was never the greatest at comforting people, and he turned away uncomfortably, just in time to notice the judges’ confused looks at Thor’s brownies — or more appropriately, Thor’s singular brownie.
“Bakers, you should be thinking about taking your loaves out of the oven by now,” said Mary, her voice betraying a hint of a giggle. Ah, the British, Steve thought, so much less reserved about sex than Americans were.
He snuck a look at the other competitors as his dough spun, and immediately knew he was doing fine. Natasha, for all her prowess with using kitchen tools as murder weapons, clearly had no idea how to use them in the actual kitchen; she seemed on the verge of smashing her stand mixer into the ground. Peter was almost entirely covered in flour; no part of the red Spider-Man outfit was visible. Bruce, despite his enthusiasm, was really much better at cooking than baking, and Steve watched in amusement as he tried desperately to roll out his dough, which kept breaking off into pieces. Thor… well, Steve had no idea
Steve was ready with a good comeback, but at that very moment, Mary and Nick turned back to face the crowd. He immediately tensed, taking Tony’s hand in his as an automatic reflex. The nervous atmosphere in the room felt almost tangible, and by the way Tony’s hand clenched around his, Steve knew he was nervous as well.
“Yeah, Steve,” Tony mumbled, tryng to hide how bitterly cold and scared he was, “I’m sure everything’s gonna be alright. Santa’s gonna come pick us up in his sleigh and take us to Neverland, and oh! Maybe we’ll even meet the Queen of Hearts on the way back home.”
“We are not risking another hit on you, Captain, and especially not in your weakened state,” said Fury calmly. “How would it look to our enemies if Captain America, who already looks like he’s in the  body of a child, pauses mid-battle to use an inhaler?”
“Don’t sweat it, Cap,” said Tony, attempting to look cheerful. “I probably would’ve under-baked that one too, if we’re being honest.”
“Coffee, then cuddles,” mumbled Tony, his words muffled by the fact that his face was hidden in Steve’s shirt. Steve rolled his eyes but acquiesced, leading Tony to their communal kitchen.
, at the very least, and that’s on the slim chance they saw exactly where we crashed. If they’re going on SHIELD intel and weapons—” Tony let out a hysterical laugh “—well, at least our bodies will be well preserved with all this snow.”
“It’s just…” Peter sniffled, burning his head in his father’s t-shirt, “You’re always fighting now, and it… it hurts to listen to, Papa. I’m scared all the time and… I thought, at first, you guys getting divorced would be bad, but now… I’d rather you guys get divorced instead of being so mad at each other all the time.”
“Thought I’d like to try something different.” Steve smiled shyly, holding the cup in his hands and wondering what to say next. He should’ve written a script for this.
Steve immediately turned to look at Tony’s loaf, his heart sinking as he took in all the critical details. He couldn’t tell much about it from this distance, but it looked almost perfect; round, crispy and a nice golden-brown. The slits weren’t as neat as Steve’s, but that wasn’t a big deal; this round would be very very close.
Steve hesitated a little bit. He and Tony really were close, and Steve had seen more of the man than any normal PA would. Still… stripping him naked in his own bathroom seemed like a bit of a violation of privacy. But it was either that or let him fall asleep covered in vomit, so Steve had to take the plunge.
“I think I added too much water,” said Tony sadly, gesturing at his mixing bowl. One glance inside it told Steve that Tony was right — the dough was lumpy and shiny, nowhere near the smooth texture of Steve’s.
“That means get your hands off the pie, Spider-Man! You too, birdbrain!” Both Peter and Clint startled, quickly taking their hands off their not-quite-completed pies. Steve quickly repositioned a few of his stars while everyone’s attention was diverted. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Tony do the same.
— had enough money to buy the whole world and everything in it ten times over. He wouldn’t want the stupid, homemade stuff Steve made for him. He watched nervously as Tony pulled the ribbon off, resisting the urge to shut his eyes in shame as Tony pulled his gift out.
He went through the motions of his parents and Tony’s oohing and aahing over their sons, their moms’ tears at how fast their boys were growing up, and the photographs taken from multiple mobile devices, as if one wouldn’t have been enough for both families. As they climbed into Tony’s limo, Steve was already ready for the night to be over, and it hadn’t even started yet.
“You two make my life a living hell,” Fury mumbled, glaring at Steve and Tony out of his one good eye. “You’re lucky the cameras weren’t on or I’d have kicked you out of the fuckin’ team myself.”
Behind him, he heard the rest of the team cheering and jeering in equal measure, and he could very clearly hear them yell the word
No one else could see anything, but trusting Thor, they began to pull away at the rocks and rubble until, finally, the red, blue and white vibranium shield came into view. Steve was curled into a ball underneath it, which the others could only tell because a single blue boot peeked out of the side.
“We need to get Peter a special something,” said Tony, nuzzling into Steve’s side. “Without him, we’d never have got together.” He turned to watch the lake, and threw a few pieces of bread that Steve brought along, for the pleasure of watching the ducks squabble. He leaned his head into the crook of Steve’s neck and sighed happily.
Fifteen minutes later, Steve shut his oven with a smile, wiping the sweat off his forehead. His brownies both looked and smelled amazing, and the bit of batter he’d tasted had been almost orgasmic. He’d decided to stay away from tradition this time, going for a recipe he’d made once before: dark chocolate brownies with a swirled cheesecake layer on top, and they’d been an absolute hit at the Avengers’ movie night. With any luck, that would help him beat Tony and Clint, who were reasonably competent bakers.
Tony was never around to supervise cleanup after the Avengers’ battles. The minute the last enemy was killed, that peace was restored and people were able to come safely outside, Tony turned on his thrusters and was on his way back to Stark Tower.
“Steve, say something,” said Tony, almost pleading. “I… I don’t know why I said all that. I never meant to. But the others… they convinced me, a little bit, and they promised me you’d feel the same way. I’m sorry, and it’s perfectly okay if you don’t feel the same— oomf!”
Bucky Jr. had his cat bed moved outside that night, but he had a strangely satisfied smirk on his face as he slept.
“Welcome to the family, then,” said Steve with a smile, and the kitten paused and let himself be petted, almost as if he understood exactly what Steve was saying.
Steve pulled him in for a kiss again, trying to tell Tony everything he couldn't just say with his words. By the way Tony’s eyes were shining, the message had gotten through, loud and clear, and it was another couple of hours before either of them whispered their apologies to each other once more.
“Thanks, Pep,” said Tony, standing up to hug her. He hugged Rhodey too, feeling slightly emotional. The last time they’d dressed him up for a date had been on his first date with…well…
“I’m not falling, Steve,” he whispered, holding his Captain, this young man who’d been through more than most people would in ten lifetimes, tight to his chest. “I’m not falling. I’m here, I’m here with you, okay?”
“Oh, no, he never laid a finger on me,” Tony assured him, “but that’s probably only because that would’ve required him to actually pay any attention to me. He just…” Tony sighed, fiddling with a corner of Peter’s blanket. “He never once told me he loved me, you know? I never once heard a “good job” or an “I’m proud of you” ever leave his mouth in relation to me. I grew up wondering why all the other kids had dads who played catch with them and bought them ice cream, and mine treated me as if I was part of the wallpaper.”
Mary was being wonderfully earnest, but Steve felt nothing but annoyed. Why couldn’t they just get to the results already?
“And the Homecoming Queen,” Fury continued, sounding bored, “who, in an almost unprecedented turn of events, has earned 100% of the popular vote… is TONY STARK.”
“I just had to get this tiny thing done,” said Tony, slipping out of Steve’s arms, and Steve had been with Tony long enough that he knew he had to catch Tony now, or he’d be stuck down here for another several hours.
Steve finished sprinkling a last few chocolate shavings over his brownies and quickly pulled away. He appraised them carefully, nodding slightly to himself. They didn’t look bad, not as good as he’d wanted them to at the beginning, but fair enough for how badly he’d messed up. Tony shot him a discreet thumbs up as the judges moved towards Steve’s brownies.
Even now, as an adult, Steve had never lost his love of books, which was why this cool, shaded café that was part of Stark Bookstores was now his comfort spot. Every Friday, when he was done with his last class, he’d settle himself comfortably in his regular seat, either buying a new book or pulling out one that he hadn’t finished yet, and curling up for hours with a hot cup of coffee. These were the best times of his week, and Steve looked forward to them more than he could ever explain.
The judges and Sandi stared at the stylist like she was crazy, but Noel took it in his stride. “Come along, then,” he called happily, raising a gracious arm to allow Wanda to go out first.
“Yeah, that’s it, Steve. You’re safe, okay? You’re with me, and we’re at Clint’s farm that we didn’t know existed until today, and we’re being watched by a million little pink ponies. Clint must get paid good money at SHIELD to afford all these toys.”
rescuing kittens from trees and taking them in and here I am, a stupid worthless mess that didn’t do shit except kill people. And then you said you’d leave the Tower with it and all I could think of was, have I been so shitty to him that he literally likes a cat better than he likes me?” Tony had started pacing around Steve’s room by now, and Steve couldn’t get a single word in. “I… I thought I was a good guy, Steve, good enough for you, at least. But how the fuck am I supposed to compete with
“What chance do I have against him?” Steve finished, massaging his ribs. “I’d rather not go to Homecoming at all.”
?” He gestured bitterly towards where Bucky Jr. was seated, licking his paws and making for an absolutely adorable sight.
Steve gripped his plate carefully, careful not to drop it. Tony bumped into him as he passed, smirking back at Steve as he walked forward. Steve scowled, but he was too preoccupied with his bread to retaliate.
, so beautiful and sparkling and expressive. Whatever it was, Steve steeled his nerves and cleared his throat. “Tony… I love you.”
“Nothing to be sorry for,” said Tony, smiling slightly before standing up and walking to the other end of the bed, lifting Steve’s blanket to reveal his hurt leg. “Now, where does it hurt?”
He climbed into his own bed and pulled the blankets up around him, exhaustion taking over every bone in his body. He shut his eyes, ready to fall asleep.
“The gauntlet didn’t work, huh?” Steve sighed and sat next to Tony on the floor. The big guy radiated warmth and heat and safety and Tony
“Now, now, dear, it wasn’t that bad,” said Mary hastily, even as she gulped down a large glass of water. “It’s just that… your flavours are a little unorthodox.”
“Okay, that’s it!” yelled Peter after fifteen agonizing minutes of sharing a table in perfect silence. “You guys dragged me out here because you said we needed to reconnect as a family! You said you were trying to be a better couple! What was the fucking point of bringing me here when you two clearly aren’t even going to talk to each other?!”
Except, of course, they couldn’t. Steve was soon brought back to earth by a large hand smacking the back of his head, making his nose crash against Tony’s face in the most undignified way.
“Yeah, but now I’ve gotta make another cup of tea,” sighed Bruce. He dumped his old cup down the sink and turned the kettle on.
He looked Tony steadily in the eye. “I didn’t think I’d ever find anyone as perfect as you again, but hey, looked like my profile worked.”
“Well, at least we didn’t have any lightning accidents this round,” Mary joked. “Bakers, please bring your loaves up to the front.”
As pathetic as it sounded, he’d imprinted on the cat harder than a baby duckling on its mother. It felt nice to have something to do, something to take care of, for a change. It made him feel useful, even a little loved, which wasn’t an emotion he’d felt in well over 60 years.
“This was where he fell and you saved him, remember?” said Tony fondly. “Who knew that I’d fall then too?” He smirked. “Fall for you, I mean.”
“No, Tony, shut up and let me do this. I run warm, you know that, and I’d prefer that you don’t die of frostbite when I’m a literal human furnace.” He paused for a second, then continued a little more sombrely. “And I’m sorry I didn’t notice how scared you are. Caves, dark places, no suit — it’s the real trifecta of things that make Tony Stark freak out, huh?”
Not really, no. I think I’m a better baker than most of these people; I’d be surprised if Thor even makes it past the first round. Tony might be a bit of stiff competition, because he really can bake very well. Did I mention that he baked me a cake for my birthday this year? He didn’t buy it; he made it from scratch, complete with red, white and blue icing. I’m so grateful to have Tony in my life.
“Didn’t think a little ol’ blizzard could keep Captain America away from his run,” he laughed. “Maybe I should engineer that suit of armour around the world after all. Make it snow every day so you’ll stay in bed with me.”
“Steve?” whispered Tony cautiously, climbing out of his bed. As he got closer, Steve’s whispered mumbles got a lot clearer.
“It’s okay,” said Steve quietly, trying not to press his body against Tony’s the way he so dearly wanted to. “It’s okay. We can do this alone some other time.”
Tony could never tell what possessed him to do it but he climbed into the tiny bed beside Steve, immediately pulling Steve into a hug. Steve’s body stopped shaking as soon as it made contact with Tony’s but he kept moaning still, clearly deep in some nightmare inspired by the Maximoff girl.
. Any hope of winning this competition was gone, now, and the Avengers were going to have to face the worst PR nightmare they’d seen since Sokovia, probably.
“That should be it,” said Clint, spreading a blanket on Tony’s bed haphazardly. “Yell if you need anything, but I’m probably not gonna hear you.” He turned to leave, then turned back for a quick second, “Oh, and Lila says if you take a shower, please don’t use her My Little Pony shampoo.”
“Tony,” he said, as Tony bustled around at the foot of Steve’s bed, fussing about his sheets, “Why are you doing this?”
“Shut up,” said Tony, but there was no heat behind his words, Steve could tell, as Tony nuzzled sleepily into the fabric of Steve’s shirt. “Maybe I could go to bed. Just for a little bit.”
“The pain was because your flesh had already started growing around the embedded knife,” said Dr. Cho matter-of-factly, like this was an everyday occurrence for her. “Normally, the medically sound thing to do would be to keep any objects that are impaled in the body inside until you reach a hospital, because it helps minimize blood loss. In your case, however, Mr. Stark was forced to pull the knife out before it became permanently fused to your leg.”
“Not that I’m not into this,” Steve gasped as Tony pulled away to place harsh kisses on his neck, “but what’s gotten into you?”
Almost before they know it, their principal, Mr. Fury, was standing on the small stage in the front of the hall. “Students, if you could all just
“It’s a big hit with the rest of the Avengers,” said Steve, and as if to prove his point, Bucky yelled at them from outside the marquee.
Tony didn’t say anything in reply to that, merely crying softly into the crook of Steve’s neck. He now felt ashamed and vulnerable in addition to feeling cold and terrified and hopeless, but it had felt good to unload everything for a bit. It felt nice. And having Steve here — well, no doubt Steve knew how to comfort people, Tony thought stupidly through his brain fog, only vaguely registering Steve’s hands, one wrapped tightly around his waist, anchoring him to reality, and the other rubbing slow, soothing circles on his back.
“Thor saw we were gonna watch a movie, and he invited himself in,” said Tony helplessly, as Steve settled himself next to him. Tony had apparently been saving his spot for him. “And then he invited Clint, and then Bruce and Nat came in before I could explain…” Tony sighed helplessly. “I couldn’t kick them all out.”
Clint was saved from having to answer by Steve, who walked in right then, sweaty and panting. He’d originally run in for a quick gulp of water, but paused as he felt the tension in the air.
“If I go in, I’m not leaving until he wakes up,” Tony said, glaring at the others, “so if you want to see him, you have two minutes. Total.”
Steve frowned down at Tony, who was staring at his phone and apparently blind and deaf to anything that was going on around him.
The feel of Tony’s comforting, warm presence beside him, the beautiful scenery in front of them and the peaceful atmosphere of the park were an intoxicating combination. Steve was so full of pure, raw emotion, he almost pulled out the velvet box and proposed to Tony right then and there. It would’ve been easy enough, considering the ring was right there in his pocket, and all he had to do was reach in and pull it out. He held back though, knowing this wasn’t the right time. Tony loved extravagance and big romantic gestures, and Steve would never feel content if his proposal was in a quiet park corner with only the trees and ducks to witness it, and only the quiet waves and slow breeze as his background music. Tony would love it, of course, because his sweet, beautiful, gorgeous, amazing Tony would love anything Steve did, but Steve could never love himself if he didn’t live up to Tony’s daydream of a perfect proposal.
“Well, I can’t make it any more obvious than that,” sighed Tony, and then, Steve couldn’t tell you how, his lips were suddenly pressed to Tony’s, kissing him like the world would end tomorrow. He was shocked, surprised, speechless; but that was only for a moment, before he registered what was happening, and kissed Tony back, much, much harder. He hadn’t known he wanted this, hadn’t even thought about it until this moment, when it all felt so absolutely, wonderfully
“I forgive you for the cat,” said Tony quickly. “And anything else you may have done. And please don’t say anything else until I’m done because I have a very good flow of words planned and you’re interrupting it.” Tony paused to take a deep breath. “Okay, so now that I’m done with all the “I’m sorry”s, I have something else to tell you, and I’m begging you not to punch me for it until I’m done.
“Rogers,” said Nick, his voice eerily calm, “Stark. Is there something you’ve forgotten to tell us?”
Steve ignored him. “D’you think I can carry him now?” He made himself comfortable in the soft armchair, grabbing hold of the baby carefully as Tony passed the bundle of blankets to him. “He’s so
Except he couldn’t fall asleep at all. His mind kept replaying the vision the Maximoff girl had put in his head; the vision of his team, dead and splayed-out over a pile of bodies, of Steve’s haunting
“Fine,” said Steve quickly, too desperate to get out of here and hide his face to object to what he’d essentially been blackmailed into doing. He grabbed Tony’s phone out of his jacket pocket, and, in a move he really should’ve been expecting given how his day had been going, the damned thing slipped from his fingers and landed on the floor. Face down. With a loud
“Y’smell good,” Tony slurred as Steve carried him bodily to his way-too-big-for-one-person bed. “Like ya smell, Steeb.”
telling you I’m not wearing that stupid thing, so get it the fuck away from me.” Pepper sighed. Again.
“We’re off the clock, now, Nick, you can’t tell us what to do,” said Tony brightly, gripping Steve’s hand and dragging him out of the tent. Steve followed him willingly, drawn to Tony like a star.
Steve set his leftover cheesecake batter to a side and started prepping the ingredients for his toppings. He glanced round himself once more, noting idly that there was almost an hour left. None of his competitors had even come close to putting their brownies in the oven, and Steve’s confidence shot up. They had time, of course, but that just meant Steve had a few extra minutes to focus on getting his toppings perfect.
Steve had had crushes before, and once even gotten so far as kissing a girl — Peggy had been his first kiss, in his freshman year of college, and she’d pulled away after a couple of seconds, giggling about how Steve really wasn’t meant to be with girls. But this… this was something new.
“Tony, he’s lucky he’s alive at all,” said Natasha fiercely, but with a note of softness in her voice. “I was sure, when he hit the ground, that, well…” She fell silent, apparently unwilling to finish the thought, and Tony resumed his pacing again.
“You said to make something that represents us,” said Wanda sadly. “My mama always made paprikash pie when I was small. It reminds me of her.”
“I know you’re built like a brick shithouse, but you’re so wonderfully soft,” Tony mumbled. His face was squished into Steve’s chest, and Steve nested his cheek on Tony’s mop of fluffy brown hair. “I’m gonna squash you like a bug.”
‘Steve,” he said, panting as Steve kissed him back roughly, both men trying to make up for three months of no contact between them. “Are you… I don’t want you to regret this.” Steve pulled away from him then, holding Tony close and looking at him like he’d hung the moon.
Steve and Tony had been trying to adopt for a long time now, over a year. They’d finally been matched with a young pregnant teenager who didn’t want to keep the baby, but also didn’t want to give it up to the system. He was now one week old, and Steve and Tony were finally meeting their son today. Steve wondered vaguely where the mother was, and if he should offer to meet or even thank her, but at that exact moment, Peter cooed in his arms and any and all higher thought was lost as the husbands collectively
with a man that — who — you deserved so much better.” Steve clenched his fists, minding his proximity to Peter. “I wish I’d been around when you were younger.”
“Well, Avengers, you’ve all made a valiant effort tonight, and we’re so grateful you’ve chosen to appear on the Great British Bake Off with us,” said Mary, clasping her hands in front of the now thoroughly cleaned-up Avengers. “Unfortunately, only four of you can move to the next round; the semi-finals, as it were.”
Tony huffed, mock-offended. “Well, I wasn’t planning on breaking up with you anytime soon, so yeah, I guess so.”
“We didn’t have cups here, Tony,” said Steve, sighing and pulling Tony to his feet. “C’mon.” He supported Tony’s body with his own, trying not to let himself indulge at how closely they were touching. “Let’s get home, okay? Happy’s waiting for us.”
go to Homecoming,” Steve grumbled. “Tony, you know I don’t do well in crowded places and with lots of people around.” He waved vaguely in the direction of the Homecoming sign-up sheet. “Plus, there’s no real competition for King and Queen anyway. It’s just a popularity contest meant to boost the popular kids’ egos one last time before they leave for college and realize they’re not actually that special. I’ll bet you anything Ty wins again this year.”
“Tony, honey, you’re okay,” said Steve, “Yes, we’re in a cave, but there’s no bad guys around and no one to kidnap you and put a car battery in your heart. You don’t have to work your way out of this, okay? The team knows where we are, I know they do, and I know they’ll come rescue us soon.”
“Miss you,” mumbled Steve again, and even in his sleep, he seemed dangerously close to crying. “Don’t fall, please. ‘M here.”
“You’re lucky I made enough popcorn for everyone,” smiled Steve, and he laid his head back. He could barely focus on the movie or whatever pathetic argument Thor and Clint and Natasha were screaming at each other about; all he could focus on was the feeling of Tony’s hands on his, the way his thumb ran slowly and rhythmically across Steve’s palm.
Steve was right in the middle of trying to come up with a nice, comforting reply that wouldn’t patronize Tony when Mary and Fury turned back towards the Avengers. He immediately forgot everything he’d been planning to say, tension racketing up his back. Beside him, Tony stood up straight, apparently feeling the same way.
“Absolutely not, Barnes,” said Fury, not even batting an eye. He bit off half of the brownie in one go, nodding approvingly at Steve. “You’ve done well, Steve. I’m surprised you don’t bake more often back home.”
“Aww, that’s so sweet of you, Tony,” teased Steve, but he handed Tony the ball of dough. Tony took it with an annoyed grunt, and Steve turned back to his own station, satisfied.
Tony took advantage of everyone’s momentary distraction and pulled his tray out of the oven. He dropped it at Steve’s station and hurried back to his own, looking as innocent as the day he was born. Steve spread his cheesecake topping over the half-baked brownie, a shit-eating grin on his face.
“I do deserve better,” Tony agreed, humming quietly as he placed a finally-asleep Peter back inside his small cot. Once he’d made sure Peter hadn’t woken up, he crossed the room and kissed Steve, wrapping his arms tightly around his waist. “And I got it, too.”
“Well, I don’t,” said Tony bluntly, “If you were around, I doubt Howard would’ve come home at all.” Tony stood up and walked slowly around the room, rocking Peter, whose eyes were now half shut, in his arms. “Steve, honey, listen to me. I love how worked up you’re getting over this, but it’s done, okay? You can’t go back in time and fix anything, and frankly, I wouldn’t want you to. I’m happy where we are now.” Tony smiled down at Peter, and the sight of that, more than anything, helped Steve calm his nerves once more.
“You’ve read this before?” he asked, and by the look on Tony’s face, his excitement must have been clear in his voice.
“I was pretty sure I was going to burn my brownies so I made an extra batch,” Tony confessed. “They’re in the oven right now, but if I pull one of ‘em out in a couple of minutes, you can still add the cheesecake on top.”
Tony turned around wildly, but his expression relaxed when he saw Steve. “You’re back already? That was quick.”
I’m no expert, but I’m definitely better than most of my teammates. When I was growing up, my mother worked all day and night to pay off my medical bills, and I was home by myself a lot. She taught me how to cook and bake so I could feed myself. And then when I got to this century, everything had gotten so much more advanced. Even now, though, baking always calms me down when I’m stressed, because it reminds me of my mom. Tony and some of the other Avengers helped me learn how to operate all your newfangled devices, so I bake in the Tower regularly now. Everyone loves my food, except Tony. He’s got the odd idea that he’s better than me at baking.
Thor smiled, a huge grin covering his face. “It is time for a friendly battle!” he roared, and Mjölnir flew into his hands seemingly out of nowhere. He threw it at a specific spot in the ceiling, where it made a dull thud, and Clint’s shouts of pain floated down to them a minute later.
Steve felt his heart sink back into his stomach. Clint had chosen to go with salted caramel twist brownies, and they did look incredible, the light brown caramel waving appealingly up and down through the dark chocolate of the brownie. It was perfectly sized, perfectly baked through, and had a wonderful crust; Steve wasn’t even sure he was safe anymore.
And Fury was right, of course. Steve got hit by a falling car; something he could easily have been able to block when he was in his post-serum body, but couldn't now. He collapsed like a house of cards, falling over onto himself, the shield clattering onto the ground beside him with a terrifying finality.
He shook slightly again, but this time from the cold. Even his serum-boosted metabolism was no match for the winds and snow outside, and his extremities were… well, he didn’t want to say
, but it just wouldn’t come out. They were only in the cabin for the weekend, after all, and they’d come here for the sole purpose of fixing their marriage. There was just such a distance between him and Tony, he had no idea how to fix it.
Steve bit his lip. This trip was supposed to be about them reconnecting, fixing what had been broken. He and Tony hadn’t been close recently, but… maybe he should be the bigger person here, take the first step.
Steve grinned, passing Tony, who was working next to him today, a quick high-five. Brownies were his
“Your brownies look good as well, Tony,” said Mary admiringly. She ran a knife over the top a few times. “It’s got a good crust on it, and you’ve certainly got the density right.” She cut a square of brownie out and lifted it out and immediately, Steve’s heart sank.
“Everything okay, Mr. Rogers?” asked Fury, noting his distress. Steve forced a smile, hoping he’d be able to fix this without anyone noticing.
And, sure enough, Tony came stumbling up to him a few minutes past midnight, when the crowd had mostly cleared out, followed by a tired-looking Pepper. One look at his face, and Steve knew Tony was in for a terrible hangover tomorrow.
Again. Sweeter than the last, his eyes fluttered, carding fingers through chocolate hair. Tony encouraged the touch, finding fingers running through his own hair, coaxing their kiss deeper.
Steve opened his mouth, about to comment on the lack of people in passing when the car pulled into a tight alleyway and slowed to a stop. Watching Coulson round the car, he thanked him as he opened the door, carefully ducking out of the car’s low seating.
He continued in Tony’s rare absence of words. “Great job, Tony.” He praised, “A few more lessons and nobody will think twice about bothering you.” His remark pulled a snort.
was realistic in their explanations, even if it hurt to hear. Steve sighed, nodding softly. “From what I’ve seen, if anyone can figure it out, it’s you.”
Steve pulled away. The biggest mistake of his life. “I can’t do this. Tony,” His fingers loosened, dropping locks wrapped between fingers. A deafening silence prefaced the horrible truth. “I don’t belong here.”
“I know.” The dim reactor illuminated the geniuses nod, pulling his soldier into a quick, tight hug.
A distant engine roar startled Tony out of his spot, not surprised in the least when his head turned to SHIELD vehicles making their exit. Maybe they were tired of waiting on survivors -- or maybe they didn’t want to get caught in the collapse. Either way, Tony couldn’t care less, his thoughts singled on waiting for a red white and blue suit.
“You can’t exactly blame him.” A bite of food interrupted Rhodey’s sentence, swallowing before continuing. “Those two will flip when they hear what’s happened.”
Steve’s head spun -- and yet somehow Tony’s gist told him maybe no matter what he did, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t save Bucky. Or maybe he could -- but how much would change because of it?
“There’s been a mistake.” Steve’s own voice couldn’t cut through the muted sensation. His chest tightened, feeling as if someone had pressed their entire force against it -- but neither agent moved so much as a finger. No -- no. Something was
“Use your left hand and swing your body this way into a jab.” Steve demonstrated as he spoke, hazel eyes carefully observing.
“Fifteen.” Tony corrected, eyes lifting off the soft glow of the shield. “Even you aren’t that fast.” Steve laughed, sadness coating the softer tone as they shared a smile. Pained, worried, and hopeful these words were only a placeholder for more. Steve could only hope.
Again. Tony rumbled the sweetest noise imaginable, filling Steve’s heart to the brim. Again and again they kissed, each closer, warmer, intoxicating. Tony tasted better than Steve could have
“I can’t tell you what’s gonna happen, Cap." He sounded sincere, voice softer in volume. "Too many possibilities.”
“I’m giving you the grand tour.” Tony’s response was simple, unbothered, and Steve was so desperately trying to find some weird, deeper meaning between the lines, but nothing came. Not until Steve caught sight of someone he’d seen two blocks back.
Steve dropped his head, huffing a laugh. “So I’ve been told.” He murmured, eyes slowly reconnecting with Tony’s. Finally, he continued. “Cut me a break -- this isn’t exactly normal for me.”
Some simple translations for Tony's Italian (these are all via Google Translate as I definitely do not speak Italian).
Their lips parted softly, long enough for a disinterested reply. “Little busy J.” Steve carded through soft hair, resealing their lips.
“What?” Steve did well to keep his voice down, regardless of the lack of agents. Tony stepped in line with the soldier, taking the first step down a floor.
Once composed he resumed his assault, wrapped knuckles throwing hard blows into a well-worn punching bag.
always surprising him). He gauged Tony’s stamina, settling on his next words. “Think you have it in you for a test?”
Steve ran a hand down his face, fingertips pinching the bridge of his nose. “So, you think SHIELD is using
are meant to be the focus of this operation.” Steve scrunched his nose at Tony, who raised a hand in defense. “Steve Rogers, Captain America, the man out of time -- someone who needs to get
He hardly heard Agent Thirteen’s voice past the deafening hammer of his heart, voice muffled and unintelligible as if she were behind glass.
Steve lowered his shield, setting it aside to pull Tony back by the shoulders. He felt rigid, expression hardening as he coughed roughly into a sleeve. “You’re okay?” Steve managed, his own throat coated thick with grit.
“Staring’s a bit of an overstatement.” Steve countered, eyebrow playfully cocked. “Besides--most people don’t have an orb in their chest.”
“That’s one point in your favor, Stark. You better think of more if I’m gonna fully trust you.” It was a tease, but Steve only knew what the internet told, what SHIELD files read, and the buzz around HQ. The month spent here had given him insight, and a firm friendship with Tony, but if this was a serious as he claimed; he needed more.
“Tony!” He called again, halfway through the field when he managed to pull him back by the shoulder. “Wait in the jet, I’ll only be a minute.”
“And let you face SHIELD’s laundry list of violation codes alone? Pass.” Steve gripped his shoulder harder, tugging him towards the jet.
the full meaning of Tony’s words. A heavy sense of nostalgia warmed Steve’s soul as his fingers brought out a book, dirtied and weathered with time, but bound strongly as ever. He smiled, carefully unwrapping the rope that held it closed, fingers gently thumbing through yellowed pages of drawings. To him, they were four, five years at their oldest, but Steve knew better by now.
“I can’t pay rent just by cooking for my incompetent landlord.” The offended look Tony shot made him laugh, knowing it took way more than that to ruffle his feathers.
Steve pressed, pushing them forward. Only when they gripped a second agents’ arm did the soldier believe they’d taken his word, gloved fingers pulling the doorknob to motion Tony forward. “We’re running out of time.” Tony hurried through, assessing the damage as multiple agents struggled to their feet.
A single hand pat between the soldier’s shoulder blades, its owner offering an inquisitive look down at the abused equipment. “I’ll say.” He said, sipping a rather loud drink. “Don’t tell me you’re seriously guilty over this.”
He appreciated Tony’s drive, and he was damn glad he’d been more or less easy to talk to, even if he
“But you didn’t.” Tony stopped him short, hazel’s level with troubled blues. “Don’t go down that road.” Steve furrowed his eyebrows. “Nothing but guilt waiting for you.”
Steve’s face paled; the helmet still fastened on his head hid the last ounce of togetherness he had.
Slowly, he managed to coax himself out of the sheets, feet planting themselves atop the cold hardwood. These nightmares never let Tony rest -- why spend the hours trying?
He wasn’t coming back for that shield. Why on God’s green earth would he? Tony had made it very clear he wasn’t its rightful owner.
Part of him thought it wrong to know this information. When he went back -- would he change history by simply knowing when and where things happened, if he acted on them? What if he could prevent Bucky from going missing? Steve didn’t know a damn thing about
Tony wanted to smile, still caught in the aftershock of Steve’s untimely arrival, and the one-armed punching bag in his arms.
The jet touched down in a clearing, the outskirts of a small town. Before the engine’s roar died down, Steve’s stomach churned. Normally he’d pass it off as nerves, eager to reunite with his best friend, but this was a feeling of unease, no--something wasn’t right.
once Steve had been ushered into a sleek, black car with windows that barred him from peering inside. The only reason Steve
It really was a work of art, in its own way. The smooth angles of the walls, the high, open ceilings. Steve could admire it as a sculpture of sorts, even if it
“I’ve been running the numbers.” Elbows propped him upright on the table, leaning in to lower voice slightly. “Even
“What--?” Repulsors fired a few off of his body, but with each gone, two more appeared. “Nat--Barton--” Somebody,
“Care to elaborate?” Steve pulled away from the windows, hurrying for the disorganized duffle bag he’d swiped in their rush.
“You sure make it look good,” Before Steve could properly form a thought on how that might have sounded to Tony, the guy’s head turned, eyebrow quizzically cocked. “I meant--”
Bucky was the good in Steve’s life, the person who helped him through it all. His parents’ funerals, the ungodly amounts of fights he’d wrangle himself into, help on his rent, groceries. Bucky was there for
Tony didn’t move, didn’t speak. Maybe it was lack of air by the way his chest heaved, or pure shock being dragged down so quickly. Whatever the reason, Steve was damn glad he’d never forget such a look.
Rhodey fell quiet, eyes searching across the tile floor — as if deciphering Tony’s words. “This is about Steve.”
Once he swallowed the first few berries, Steve interjected. “SHIELD was founded by two people I knew well. People I trusted.”
Steve backed off of Tony’s workspace, checking the time on the room’s clock. Nearly time for lunch. His mouth opened, about to suggest a break--
With Bucky theoretically thrown into Steve’s same future, the only thing tethering him to the past was his birthdate.
“Yeah, tell me something I don’t know.” Of course Tony had heard sightings of rogue avengers, but with most of them out of the country, the accords didn’t allow any of them to pursue the leads. The one time the UN thought it worthwhile, any traces of the group were gone long before Tony had arrived. What a shame. “Last week he came by — something about checking up.” Tony scrunched his nose. “I knew it was about Banner, Thor. It terrifies him. Thinks I’m hiding them in some storage vault.”
Steve cocked an eyebrow, snorting. “Tony.” He began to object, but the billionaire was already ducking under ropes, meandering to the center of the ring. Steve shook his head, a look of some amused questioning twisting his face. “You’re serious?”
Steve huffed a laugh, following his given orders. Once inside the ring, he met toe-to-toe with Tony, eyebrow raised in questioning. “What did you have in mind?”
“Hold on, hold on.” Steve couldn’t help but laugh, shaking his head at the billionaire. “I know you don’t
Tony blew air out of his cheeks, wringing hands together as more cracks splintered across the bunkers’ surface. He was an idiot for letting Steve run head first into danger in the first place. As much as he admired his bravery, he was goddamn stubborn -- Tony hoped that hadn’t gotten him killed.
Steve stared at the crude diagram. His throat tightened so much he couldn’t find the words to speak.
Steve smiled, fingers lifting another fry to his mouth. “Bucky and I were the same way.” He said, pausing long enough to chew. “No matter how long we’d be apart--the moment I saw his face again, it was like we’d never really parted ways to begin with.” His shoulders sagged, a somber expression rooting deep in blue irises.
Tony simply nodded, eyes landing on Steve’s with a smirk. “Don’t tell him I gave it away.” Steve laughed,
Tony jumped, coffee sloshing out onto the counter -- and across parts of his hand. “Shit--” It didn’t matter much -- mostly because his eyes see Steve, barely illuminated by the farthest reaches of the kitchen light.
Steve’s smirk widened, gesturing at himself. “Start whenever you’re ready.” The taunt narrowed Tony’s eyes, throwing another easily blocked hook. Another and another Steve blocked, each hit more coordinated than the last. “Good, Tony.” He encouraged, adrenaline rising with every blocked punch.
either.” Right or not, Tony still had an elbow lightly nudged into his side, feigning his offense with a scrunched expression. Steve only smirked, backing off enough to keep out of Tony’s personal space, something important he’d learned very quickly.
SHIELD’s team can hardly agree on what to do. They spend half their time disagreeing when you’ve already gotten--” Steve furrowed his brows, motioning to the jumbled screen.
The light caught something metal as Steve pulled the flashlight from the ground, casting its ray across a standard SHIELD firearm.
Tony’s hands splayed above him, their eyes interlocked. “Because you won’t make a move. I made it for you.”
“Take this.” Steve lifted his shield from the rubble, holding it out for Tony. “Keep under it, and stay safe on the way out.” Steve’s mouth went dry; he forced the words out. “If I’m not back in ten minutes, leave.” His fingers were hesitant, but Tony took the shield, flipping it to face him.
Blindly, Steve walked with him, nervous eyes landing on anywhere but Tony. He felt uncomfortable for reasons he didn’t quite understand, but the topic was so touchy, he had to assume it was only his nerves. It wasn’t until the crest of the large letter S peeked beyond buildings that Steve realized where they were going, but he didn’t understand
He continued, teaching him right and left hooks, the proper stances; Steve even threw in an uppercut, curious how far Tony intended on stretching this lesson.
“You’ll get a kick out of this,” Tony said, lazily pressing the left elevator’s button. Steve turned his head just enough to look from the corner of his eye. Good, they hadn’t been followed in. The elevator rang and Tony motioned for Steve to head in first, following after with a soft clear of his throat, typing in what Steve could only assume was the access key to the private floors. “Full tour of the penthouse, million-dollar view--”
Tony fell in line when they met halfway, hurrying along beside him. “Fifteen minutes? Obviously you can’t count.” Steve coughed roughly, a failed attempt at laughing.
he’d send him back now. This place was a maze -- and even with those glasses, the odds of meeting unfriendly agents were too high.
If Tony was right about this, about SHIELD, he was more than happy Tony was interfering with their plan, but this was Steve’s life they were talking about. Selfish or not, he wanted normalcy again.
Carefully, Steve parted messy locks from Tony’s forehead. It didn’t feel real -- their first kiss shared only hours before, and now here he was in very real danger of losing him.
He growled, dividing his attention as best as possible. “Start talking.” He could be out of that door in seconds, fancy locks or not. Both held their positions, while Coulson strained a sigh.
“The accords.” Tony reiterated, eyes slowly finding their way to settle on Rhodey again. “Did we,” he gestured vaguely, shoulders dropping. “do the right thing.”
“I said I’m worried about you.” Rhodey sighed. “Look at you, man. Your bags have bags.” His hand gripped the countertop while Tony tinkered with brace circuits. “Talk to me.”
“Consider it thanks for the sketchbook.” From the first day on, Steve was glad to have Tony part of this whole thing. An opinion beyond SHIELD was good to have (it was good to have outside opinions on lots of things, really), especially when it was as important as
“You--” Steve’s mouth struggled for a sensible sentence. He tried, over and over again, hoping the cogs in his brain would churn
Steve sighed, picking a few bigger, juicy berries from the pile. “What’s your point, Tony. You sound like a movie detective.” The slightest crack of a smile formed on Tony’s lips, clearing his throat for the big reveal.
been genuine. He didn’t know. He hadn’t thought about it. Bucky was too important, waiting for him seventy years in the past.
“Rhodey?” Tony nodded, sliding the phone back into his pocket. “Two peas in a pod. He’s busy, I’m busy--” He shrugged. “--we pick up like we never missed a beat.”
you fall!” Tony snapped, eyes clouded with more emotions than he thought he had. “He didn’t slow down, he didn’t turn. He let. You, fall.”
His eyes searched across the empty space, before the burning sensation became too prominent of a thought to ignore. He ran the scalded spots underneath water, eyes burning with the plea to sleep just a little longer. He wished he could.
“This building is on the verge of collapse. All of you need to leave now.” His voice carried down the hallway, confident all were in earshot -- but not so much on the chance they’d take his offer. One, three, a dozen heads turned, contorting Steve’s face with a horrid dread. One brief glance told him Tony was on the same page, gritting teeth as he tightened his shield, and readied for another strike--
Two months ago, the only thing that mattered was getting home. Now, Steve found himself pulled the opposite direction, despite his rationalizations. He exhaled slowly, shakily, nodding to Tony.
any reason to follow them, was the confirmation of his ID, certain they hadn’t been nearby when he’d spoken it before.
The device hummed, the room brightening with a blinding blue. Steve grit his teeth and bolted for the double-dented doors, jaws parted in a yell as the light blinded him.
He couldn’t stop himself; before he knew it his finger extended, prodding curiously at the white, glowing screen. “What
Careful fingers pulled Tony’s away from his jaw. Each finger perfectly intertwined, the rough edges of weathered fingers tickling Steve’s skin. He leaned down, kissing him again. Longer, deeper this time.
Steve didn’t understand why Tony wouldn’t further the topic on their walk to -- wherever it was the guy was leading them. It scared him, worried that something had changed. Something was wrong.
“Think about it.” 101. 102 -- Jesus this elevator was fast. “You blipped their radar. Time travel -- possible, but how?” The doors opened, and Tony stepped out backwards, wagging his finger in thought. “Something you did, or
Tony shrugged dramatically, opening a sleek, steel fridge, free of imperfections. “Who wouldn’t jump on that train?” Steve crossed his arms, leaning against an island that stretched nearly the entire expanse of the kitchen.
Steve bolted for the next room, hopping over uneven remains and large, out of place chunks of rubble.
“Jarvis--tape?” Breaking things that were likely of very high quality reverted Steve to caveman language.
Soreness locked Steve against an icy floor, small pebbles tumbling through the man-sized breach. Each cough echoed through an empty room, his discarded flashlight illuminating the far reaches of stone and concrete. Steve staggered onto clumsy feet, adrenaline urging him forward into the seemingly untouched room. How was that possible?
A tight smile thinned Coulson’s lips. “That makes two of us.” Steve watched as the agent stepped for an old alley door, pulling a card from his pocket. It was thin, blue -- and
“Oh, and. Welcome to my house.” Tony added, gesturing to the assortment of furniture in the living space. “Come sit down, you’re making me nervous.”
He persisted. “You’re a SHIELD prisoner in that room. Stay here. Live a little, get out. Just until I find the right way to send you home.” Steve couldn’t believe what he was hearing; he
He couldn’t see, but both agents exchanged puzzled looks. “Captain Rogers?” One inquired, their guns staying drawn regardless of the non-hostile tone.
concrete shaking violently beneath their feet. Both men scrambled for support against the wall, exchanging concerned glances in the dim light. “We need to hurry.” Steve urged, resuming quick footwork down the old staircase as Tony hastily followed.
No signs of immediate rejection showed in Rhodey’s features, and that was good enough for Tony. “I don’t know how possible that is. Signing this — 117 countries agreed on this decision.” Rhodey lowered his eyes, adjusted his napkin. “If it were just the US, maybe. But I don’t see you smooth talking your way through 117 countries.”
Tony clapped a hand right into the dip of Steve’s shoulder -- nothing like a good conspiracy theory to bring out the best in him. “Bingo.”
“Friday,” Tony started, picking mug off the counter to wipe down the rim, edges and bottom. “Pull up current projects in the lab. Run me through them.” Some mind-numbing designs could do him good, maybe even relax him enough for a thirty minute nap.
“Me? Making you nervous?” Steve snorted, slowly giving in to Tony’s request. “Are you okay?” He teased, wandering down the couple steps into the sunken living space. “Have a drink too many this morning?” Slowly he found a comfortable seat (all of them
Steve unzipped the top. “One, maybe two dozen vehicles. They didn’t park in the open.” If they had, Tony’s jet would have crushed them like a soda can -- but why hide? He pulled rumpled fabric out, draping it across an armchair.
time, outings like these were rare, if even possible. He had been so busy tracing Hydra’s footsteps and eliminating bases that any free time Steve had was spent sleeping or working tactics with his team.
Steve blinked hard, eyes falling on the light indicating what floor they were passing. 49, 50, 51. “So I’m not crazy.” Eyebrows raised, a fake smile thinning Steve’s lips. “Think I would’ve preferred that to being followed.” Steve said, expression quickly relapsing into befuddlement. “But why?”
Rhodey remained quiet, which gave Tony the impression he wanted to hear it until the end. “The Avengers were never meant to run under a government operation. They just weren’t. We gave it a try, because the alternatives were worse — and we’re none the better.” A brief drink of water wet his tongue again. “Ross won’t see it that way — why give up his control willingly?” He huffed. “Something has got to change, Rhodey. This isn’t working.” Maybe he’d have included mention of his team labeled as criminals when they were the very opposite,
“You can stay here, or — take your friend with you back to the forties. Lucky for you, we’re dealing with time.” Tony said, cracking the tiniest smile. “You have all the time in the world to decide.”
Now all Steve had was a weathered sketchbook, and time to kill. Why not spend it with somebody who for the most part enjoyed talking with him?
“Would you consider it?” The question left Steve stumped. Confused almost. Why did Tony even want to know?
He worked quickly, fastening his shield once caught, dull scrabbling turning his eyes towards the darkness. Cautiously Steve stepped forward until the first downed agents’ figure came in view across the floor. A gasp left them as Steve hauled them up by the arm, sternness gripping the Captain’s tone. “Help these men out of the facility. This entire structure is compromised.” The agent stammered, surely puzzled by the sharp turn of events, but Steve didn’t have the time.
had returned him to rights. “Wouldn’t want you to.” A provocative wink batted long lashes, something Steve found difficult to look away from.
Tony grit his teeth, turning his head. “What?” His periphery caught colors other than trees and rubble -- colors that nearly made the genius choke.
The further they walked, the more Tony’s comment made sense. How could Hydra have enough resources for something this extensive? They were scattered, running on
Tony straightened his posture, turning so most of his body faced Steve. “What’s waiting for you back home?” He asked. There was no snark, no double meaning to Tony’s question, so Steve sighed.
Heavily armed doors greeted the team of two, but a simple push skid heavy metal across dampened concrete. SHIELD was still here -- which either meant they were still searching inside; or detaining them. Either way, Tony was right about one thing;
The optimism was appreciated, even if Steve’s standards had quickly lowered with the hard truth. SHIELD hadn’t even tried to be blunt; they’d told him he’d be home in no time. At least
The doors sealed shut, and without missing a beat, Tony turned hazel eyes on Steve. “SHIELD’s using you.”
“We’re US-based.” The woman spoke. Steve briefly turned to make eye contact. “Some of us were deployed here to inspect strange energy spikes.”
Tony smiled, empty in meaning. “And I made mine.” He finished quietly, eyes managing to keep to Rhodey’s for a few seconds longer. Slowly, he pushed his chair from the table, gathering his trash. He needed some time. “Thanks for lunch. I’ll see you, buddy.” He dumped his garbage, checked the time, and moved around to pat Rhodey on the shoulder on his way down the street.
He rolled his eyes, albeit playfully. “Form a fist with both hands.” Tony did as instructed, hazel eyes watching the super soldier round behind him. “Now, tuck in your arms, close to your body.” Steve carefully adjusted an arm, but only slightly -- figuring he’d done some amateur practice on his own at some point.
sending the team of two and every agent stumbling. Why were the tremors worsening? A building this extensive wouldn’t shake on it’s own. Debris dusted Steve’s shoulders, stress rising as a monstrous crack splintered from above. An unstable agent's flashlight flicked across the ceiling, illuminating several large chunks of ceiling dislodging from their spot.
“Suppose neither one of us asked for it, either.” Steve said, catching the quiet scoff that left Tony.
When Steve opened his mouth to speak, Tony spoke for him. “Are we done being a skeptic?” He asked, eyes twinkling with something Steve couldn’t quite identify, but it resembled playfulness of all things.
Almost on cue, warnings in his HUD wildly blared, warnings too soon to prepare for. It felt like damn near a dozen bodies had just toppled onto his armor, slamming him down towards the ground at a rate he did
of time theories.” Tony leaned forward, picking a fry off Steve’s plate. “Remember what I said? Nobody
after, in fact -- Steve couldn’t find an official disbanded date. A Zemo heir still lived, hopefully not under his lineages’ ideals.
“Call for backup! Captain Rogers is--” The rounded shield silenced the distress call, bouncing off every last agent in its path back to Steve.
But Tony only smirked, patting the broad-shouldered man between the shoulder blades. “Because I stalk you without higher up orders.” Steve erupted with laughter, head shaking in disbelief, how
And judging Tony’s initial shrug, Steve was betting he didn’t have much else. “If I’m not busy.” He adjusted one leg over another, head lazily thumping against the back of the couch. “Jarvis keeps me on my toes.” Just as Steve opened his mouth to ask about the new name, a disembodied voice sent shivers up his spine.
“I know what you’re thinking.” Rhodey watched eyes raise with the words, calloused fingers curling around Tony’s forearm. “It won’t pardon them. They’d still serve the time — they committed those acts while the Accords were effective.”
“The answer to your questions, hopefully.” Agent Thirteen answered, pressing fingers against what Steve could only compare to a typewriter; numbers and letters all in rows.
-- to do it again, be ripped from the ties he’d finally formed, leave the person who had his heart--
Panic gripped his chest, frantically searching for signs of a faint blue light. “Tony?!” Steve’s voice strained, stumbling into the wall as another rumble shook the earth. “Tony!” Screams filled his ears, voice drowned by the grotesque squelch of bodies.
Tony found his way next to Steve, of all the seats in the space. He didn’t mind it, of course, more amused by the fact Tony preferred a seat so close to his usual ‘stay away from me’. He supposed Tony didn’t feel Steve violated his personal space, having taken careful precautions to keep him from becoming the same constant uncomfortable other people left him. “Not this time.” He answered Steve’s poke, conveniently placing blueberries on the table in front of them. With no prior objections, Steve reached his hand out for more, caught by the wrist halfway, Tony’s calloused fingers firmly wrapped around his pulse point.
“Unofficially.” He smirked, winking in the soldier’s direction. It earned him a snort, and the slightest pink on Steve’s cheeks, something he quickly fought aside.
They stepped through the double-wide doors, closing seamlessly behind them. The lobby was just as big as Steve expected, glossed floors sprawling what had to be hundreds of feet. He followed Tony’s slow pull for the elevators, blue eyes briefly flicking along his back.
“I don’t see your point.” Steve murmured, noting every branch and corridor they passed. Just in case.
“Sounds like the worst place for it.” Steve’s eyes scanned the photo, eyes settling on the taller of the two. “You still talk to him?”
“--they’ll have everything they need.” Tony quickly finished, hurrying out the door and down the jet steps.
It took a minute for Steve to realize -- wait, the cafeteria wasn’t serving burgers...oh, Tony wanted to go somewhere
Caressing the side of this thing did him no good either. Slowly, Steve applied pressure to the puncture, lifting it up and off the hook. The sooner he laid this down on it’s back the better.
James Rhodes, sniffing out Tony’s bullshit since the 1990’s. His eyes found Rhodey’s again, their gaze lingering longer this time, wondering if he could verbalize what had and still
Steve carefully rewrapped the book closed, turning to Tony, who wasn’t looking now but had sneaked a tiny glance over while the soldier reunited with his old belongings. “Thank you, Tony.” He murmured softly, voice soft with sincerity. This meant -- more than he could express. A month in the future hadn’t been easy, but little conversations with Tony, Sharon and his newest friend Natasha had made it bearable. And Tony going out of his way to find something that belonged to Steve...
Once Steve was certain no agents loomed ahead, he pulled a flashlight off his belt, extracted from an agent who no longer needed it. Brief scans along the larger rubble left him empty. No bodies, no blood, nothing. Nerves caught up with Steve, apprehensively adjusting his grip. Something wasn’t right.
“We were hoping you could provide insight.” Coulson’s weapon stayed lowered, but Steve wasn’t quite ready to drop the shield. “We have evidence of every termination listed. Barnes is a cold case -- but you, Captain Rogers, are very much alive. And we’d like to know how.”
Steve grit teeth together and swung a right hook so hard, the seams burst on impact, sand spilling in every messy direction. Even
Finally, he gave in. “Bucky.” He admitted. “Bucky’s my reason.” He knew the war cleanup went fine without him, he’d read all about it. His team went on to do bigger, better things without him. The world kept spinning, albeit a few hiccups along the way, but Steve would never forgive himself if he didn’t go back for Bucky.
“Right.” Tony motioned Steve with him, hesitantly pulling his eyes from the vast sea of windows. He had a harder time wrapping his head around the enormity of the space than the building itself. “You come in. Captain America. A legend gone missing. You’re lost, confused, and these people who you can only associate with an old code offer help.”
“Good.” Steve squeezed Tony’s shoulder, the goosebumps on his skin going unnoticed. “Place this foot here,” He lightly tapped the other’s leg, pointing to the correct position. “And the other there.” Tony moved accordingly, blue eyes carefully watching to ensure his placement gave Tony proper stability. Steve stepped to Tony’s left, mirroring his stance. The attention sent shivers down Steve’s spine.
A gentle hand pulled him from his trance, rubbing his shoulder. “He’ll be there.” His words were soft, reassuring.
“Show me what you learned.” The elaboration opened Tony’s eyes, slowly dragging himself up to a proper stance. “I’ll play defense.”
Yeah, he did need to leave this place. Honestly, he appreciated the escape route. Tony fumbled with a few more wires, lightly bending Rhodey’s leg to make sure the correct changes were made. “I need a shower.”
Steve shrugged, mindlessly turning pages in a SHIELD handbook. “Yeah. More of a hobby.” He answered, eyes watching as Tony swiped hands across holograms, still mesmerized by their existence.
Tony cocked an eyebrow, soft, pink lips thinning in a smirk. “Finally, someone with sense.” Steve rolled his eyes, trying his damnedest to keep the smile out of his expression.
“I don’t want to hurt you.” Steve warned, the other three approaching with similar confusion. “Let me pass and we don’t have to do this.”
He felt numb. His body moved into the jet, but Tony didn’t feel it; like someone else was forcing him inside, setting the only thing left of Steve down against the wall.
“Ross has you as guard dog?” Tony’s squinted eyes behind sunglasses, lifting drink for another sip. “Never pictured him owning a chihuahua.”
Only when Tony fought for breath did he raise his hand, bracing hands against legs with heavy pants.
“It’s too dangerous, Tony.” But the man was just as stubborn as he was, twisting out of the firm grip for the opposite direction. “That facility’s nearly a hundred years old, not to mention the
“I wanted to hear your motivations.” He clarified, clearing his throat. “Tell you what. I’ll do some digging. See what I can find on your Bucky.” Blue irises widened in disbelief, waiting for the catch in Tony’s offer. “It’s a shot at retrieving him quicker if you can’t prevent his kidnapping.”
from the ground. He lay dumbfounded, wide-eyed and all as Steve pulled him closer with a wide, wicked smile.
“What, you got a lumpy mattress? Maybe it’s all that coffee you drink to keep you functioning.” Rhodey huffed. “Or maybe, there’s something you’re not telling me.”
“Left.” Tony said, following Steve’s maneuver accordingly. They continued straight, past two hallways that sent chills down the soldier’s spine -- brushing it aside for more important matters. “Right.” Tony instructed. “Stairway just ahead.” Steve began forward, turning his head when Tony scoffed.
Tony walked towards a table, setting his nearly-empty cup down. “You’re right.” He said, motioning Steve for the boxing ring further inside the decently sized space. “It’s about time you taught me a few moves.”
Steve scoffed a laugh, “Prove it.” Tony popped a fry into his mouth, wiping hands with a napkin, ready to show how incredibly serious he was. Steve watched while he took another messy bite of burger, wiping his own napkin across mouth in an attempt from staining his mouth shades of red and yellow.
Another distant rumble scattered his thoughts, gripping Tony tightly. “Stay here. I’m going to get Bucky.” Calloused fingers curled around his wrist, halting Steve in his spot. “Tony--” He began to protest, knowing exactly what was running through the billionaire’s mind--
in parallel dimensions, there’s an extremely high chance you’ll make one.” Tony huffed. “Or, maybe you’re not meant to go back. See the problem?”
“So you took me all the way up here just to tell me about your doubts?” Steve teased, savoring the taste of the snack. He hadn’t had any groceries here, just the things from the SHIELD cafeteria. They were
Coulson clicked a button on the keyboard, retracting the files back into nothingness. “Maybe you did, Captain. But nobody else has seen or heard from
Tony jabbed again, catching the edge of Steve’s shoulder. He followed with a right hook that the soldier quickly dispersed, but left him open for an uppercut straight to the abdomen. He staggered backward, shocked, but Tony didn’t miss a beat, slamming a kick Steve
“One more flight.” Tony promised as they turned the tight stairwell corner. Shield at the ready, Steve stepped onto the landing, situating beside the exit door with an exhale. Gloved fingers curled around the handle, but Tony stopped him short, squeezing his hand. “Five agents. Two left, three right.” Eyebrows furrowed behind his helmet, straining beyond the thick metal door long enough to hear faint scuffs of boots against concrete.
want to invite you over.” He admitted, leaning more comfortably in his seat. “The conspiracy theory was an added bonus. Plus -- I don’t do well with spies watching me eat. Call me picky.” Steve smiled, lightly nudging a broad shoulder into the smaller man, who only grunted in response.
I'm SO sorry this took almost a month...oops. I started a summer class and am preparing for graduation, I'm in the process of moving, aaand just a whole slew of other things that kept me from getting this chapter done! Hope it was worth the wait, and here's hoping I can get the next chapter out a little sooneer. ;)
And he was right on the money -- one look over told Steve he was already one step ahead, augmented glasses resting lightly on his nose. They continued straight, wary eyes searching every dim corner for an inconspicuous lever or door frame that would lead them to a covert room.
Steve’s eyes lifted. He nodded. “Even before the serum, he was always there for me.” He sighed, brushing back the few strands of hair tickling his forehead. “He was my best friend. I never planned on what I’d do without him.”
“Zemo’s weapon.” Steve followed Tony out, taking a wide gander at the gigantic penthouse that opened before him.
“That guy you tagged. SHIELD.” Tony sniffed, hands resting delicately inside pockets. “Ever get the feeling you’re being watched?”
Blue eyes caught the subtle movement of the other agent behind him, leading him to believe he had no say in the matter.
Coulson waved the same transparent badge across another strip, and pulled the door open, motioning both Steve and Agent Thirteen forward. “That’s another thing we’re here to discuss.”
Not only was it the first time Steve had gone out with intentions to do more than sightsee, but it was the first time somebody had asked him out for lunch in,
Standing there in the doorway was his biggest fear. Tony, coffee in hand, with eyes on the destruction.
“Bucky?” The words bounced off walls, sending shivers down his spine. This felt too familiar -- a deja vu Steve had no interest in reliving.
It took half an hour smoothing out the basic functions, but once Steve found the search engine, he was entertained for
Dirtied boots carried him forward, briefly catching his reflection muted in black. What happened next he wouldn’t dare call magic, but every box seemed to spring to life, bright light emitting from all three screens. The sudden change physically startled Steve, eyebrows furrowing as words, pictures, and even
Cautiously, Steve proceeded forward, eyes scouring the file before they settled on one horribly distinctive line.
Tony’s chest heaved, fingers desperately working to free himself of what restrained him. It wasn’t until he was fully upright that he could feel how violently every inch of his body was shaking.
With one last exhale, Steve let every nerve go, cleared his mind of all thoughts but one as he turned the knob.
When he found a suitable photo, Tony turned his phone around, placing it on the table in front of Steve with an all-too-cocky smile. “That moppy-haired kid is yours truly,” Steve laughed as Tony pointed to the shorter of the two boys pictured, donning an oversized MIT hoodie. “And that, is Rhodey. The only kid that more or less put up with me.”
Softly, Steve spoke, voice barely echoing off empty walls. “Any chance you can scan the building?” Odds were Tony would have something to get the job done.
“Set him on the seats.” Tony instructed, urging Steve up the stairs first, locking the door tight behind. The soldier did as he was told, laying his battered friend delicately across a row of seats, using the duffle bag as a means to prop his head. “He’ll need a hospital. None of my Ph.D.’s cover time-hopping medical emergencies.” Tony called from the cockpit, sliding a hand across the wall in his walk back while the jet began to lift from the ground.
It was a rush of adrenaline that pried his fingers from the indented table, that made him swipe his shield out from its holster. Steve didn’t know who these people were -- but he was beginning to think they weren’t on his side, raising his shield when both drew their firearms.
Tony’s eyes briefly lifted from his work. “Just bad sleep.” He hoped Rhodey would take that. Yeah, right.
Steve clasped Tony’s shoulder, breaking into a run with a faint smile curling lips. “Try to keep up.”
Now, he was lucky enough to find something and distract himself while Tony muddled through time physics.
He lost count of their kisses, too wrapped up in Tony’s scent to care. Time became irrelevant; soft exhales, gentle touches and Tony were all that mattered.
helping people.” Steve caught the sharp edge in Tony’s voice, creating a mental note to keep far away from that conversation in the future. “SHIELD is not my dad. And it’s definitely not me.”
“My lips are sealed.” Steve returned the smirk, taking a spot beside Tony to better see what he was doing. “Don’t suppose you draw,” Steve said, eyes drifting across the amalgamations of numbers, figures and equations that made absolutely zero sense to him.
“The future’s so much better.” Tony smirked. “Can’t believe you’d go back to a world of polio and racism.” Steve rewarded Tony with an elbow, playfully rolling his eyes.
one.” Calloused fingers lay down another fry diagonally against the first, placing another fry on top of it.
He didn’t budge, raising the shield higher. He knew all about following orders -- but this was an extremely time-sensitive mission. It was now or never. “It’s nothing personal.” Steve muttered, slamming his shield outwards into the closest agent, gun clattering aside as they tumbled backward.
Steve sighed. He was overwhelmed with information, speculation, accusation. “And what makes you so different from them?” The soldier challenged, interested in Tony’s defense in all of this.
Slowly, Steve muddled through his choice of words. He had so much to say. And he wouldn’t dare screw it up -- not now, when the person who he was simply enamored with laid beneath him, straddled by -- Jesus, he was
The vibranium muffled the deafening roar of the collapse, but it couldn’t deafen the distraught screams. Steve felt the heat off Tony’s face burrowed against his neck, gripping him tighter with every impact taken by his shield.
“I’m not angry.” Tony’s voice was level but out of breath as he swung again, stumbling back from light retaliation. “Just ready to show off.”
Pulling away was the toughest battle of the evening, his heart emptier when their bodies finally parted.
“We’re here to help you, Captain.” Steve’s blues cut through Coulson like glass, struggling to front a defensive glare when his body began to tremble.
From the corners of his eyes, he could see Tony’s glasses illuminated with information. “The structure’s destabilizing.” Steve didn’t need a fancy pair of glasses to understand that; the splinters running concrete walls explained perfectly. “We stay much longer and we’re getting a free burial.”
“Read it.” Coulson insisted. Steve didn’t trust them, not one bit, but the tension in his shoulders eased as Coulson lowered his gun, Thirteen hesitantly following.
I'm SO sorry for taking more than a month with this chapter! I've been preoccupied with other things. Hopefully, the next chapter will come sooner than later, but please know that I am working on it! Very slowly, very steadily. Thank you guys for reading, you're my inspiration for continuing these two's journey. <3
The genius didn’t let him finish, kissing him fervently. Both hands gripped dirty padded shoulders, pulling him closer with every kiss he stole. Steve wrapped strong arms around his waist, dragging a pathetic noise from Tony, who pulled away long enough to utter a single sentence.
But Tony held his ground, pulling back. “If you go in there, you might not come back out for another
“The anomaly we’re investigating, its coordinates resonate about five miles North.” Thirteen explained. Steve swallowed.
Steve gave him distance, returning to the center of the ring while Tony wiped his forehead. “Not bad, Stark.” He wouldn’t deny he was impressed. Boxing definitely didn’t overlap with
“I---damaged the weapon just before it fired,” Steve spoke quietly, eyes still glued to the metallic rim of his shield. “Whatever happened --” He forced down the hot feeling rising in his throat, daring to meet the eyes of both agents. “You said seventy years --” Steve swallowed the last of his reserve, and came right out with it.
Tony hummed. “Not to be weird,” Hazel eyes slowly pulled themselves off of the holograms, meeting blues waiting in question. “--my dad kept your sketchbook. Grabbed it before the government seized everything to your name.” Tony nudged his head for the bag Steve had seen him carry in earlier -- finding it odd that he had, considering he always traveled light. “Take it.”
Blood pumped through veins, adrenaline urging fists to land their mark, each punch harder than the last. His knuckles stung, but it felt good, and Steve almost missed the pain.
“Nobody understands time travel. Not really.” Tony’s look was slightly softened; surely it was some sort of pity. “You
thank you guys for all the wonderful comments, I love reading them, they're what keep me motivated <3
“Uh, and cook.” Tony added, fingers lightly clinking against his mug. “Do you know how sick I was of chinese takeout?” Steve smiled, lightly nudging Tony with an arm.
“You must be very confused.” Steve grabbed his shield out of the floor, eyes raised to Coulson in a sigh.
of all things. One quick wave across a black strip tumbled loud locks and unlatched the heavy door from inside. “Right this way, please.”
prepared for was the odd sensation that pricked his cheeks and filled his chest each and every time Tony and he shared conversation.
Hallway after hallway, each intersection paused them in their movements until Steve gave the all-clear. For someone who hadn’t been on a mission, Tony was doing well keeping up.
Each punch mirrored its impact; a single word rattling around in his brain. Over and over again, harder, stronger than the last.
The pulsing grew quicker, blue eyes worriedly looking towards the device. “I’m gonna get you out of here.” They were more for himself, carefully gathering Bucky into his arms. “Til the end of the line, pal. Isn’t that right?”
No door would stop him. Shield or not, Steve parted lips in a yell and braced for impact, metal groaning in resistance as the soldier forced his way through dented steel, tumbling until his feet brought all momentum to a halt.
No, no. He wasn’t ready to move on from Coulson’s dismissive words. “You expect me to believe all this?”
“It’s where I belong. I shouldn’t see the invention of smartphones, or self-driving cars. It’s way beyond my time.” Steve turned his head more in Tony’s direction, eyes dulling in their sheen. “You said it yourself. I’m a man out of my time.” He could tell Tony was thinking by the way his eyes glossed over Steve’s face, but Steve had given up trying to read his face by now.
Coulson turned them down another hallway, and down a rather steep flight of stairs. “Captain, we believe
Agent Thirteen trained her gun, expression firm. “Captain Rogers, lower your shield.” His ears were slowly regaining their hearing, enough to realize he was heaving breaths.
But Tony wasn’t quite done yet. Before Steve could shift his weight and stand, two hands shoved at his chest, forcing his broad back against the boxing mat. Within a second two knees gripped his sides, hungry eyes staring down the soldier trapped beneath them. “You’re driving me nuts, Rogers.” Steve squawked, taken aback by the unusual frustration lacing his voice (along with the fact he was also
He swung -- a jab, easily dodged with a quick sideways maneuver. “Stay focused, Tony.” A right hook landed, blocked by a sturdy forearm. “Anger won’t get you closer to a hit.”
His fist broke another’s jaw, catching the shield in time to bonk an assailant away. A third approached from behind, about to swing his shield when their dark figure fell from view, uncovering a faint blue light behind them. “Thanks.” Steve smirked, glad to see the genius applying those kickboxing moves.
“Official reports of the Howling Commandos read Zemo’s weapon completely engulfed you, that shield, and Barnes’ left arm.” Steve's eyes widened behind his helmet, blues dropping down to the shield in his arm.
Steve swore his face burned a degree higher, nervously chuckling to avoid more stupid slip-ups. “Great. Glad we settled that.” His voice dripped with sarcasm, enough to have Tony lightly giggling. He could think what he wanted -- the latter meaning a compliment to his wardrobe, but Steve wouldn’t dare feed his ego further.
That sentence hit harder than he imagined. Tony’s movements paused, his fingers lightly curling against the warm ceramic with a outward huff. “Stop—“ He instructed quietly, already moving to slide down into a nearby chair.
“Do you want me to fix this or not?” Tony muttered, averting eyes back to circuits. If he tampered enough with the wiring, he could have Rhodey in a split — that’d be kinda funny—
Their bodies met and Steve pulled him close, tucking them underneath the shield as the world around them crumbled.
He started down the steps into his personal gym, coffee lazily raising to lips in a silent confirmation to begin said explanation.
After several seconds of staring at the ceiling, Steve finally came to his conclusion. “A robot?” Tony smiled, stealing yet another blueberry from Steve’s cupped hand.
Cap.” He popped the fry into his mouth, taking a few more in hand. “Theoretically, you could go back, live a happy life
“Make a--” Steve shook his head, looking to him as if he were insane. “What?” The groan leaving Tony weakened his knees.
comfortable, but this had a wonderful view of the city), settling in with a slow look around the room.
it’s clear we’re not handling threats effectively.” Waiting for someone to give them the OK took hours, at best. How many people’s lives were in danger in those golden hours?
He leaned into the touch, voice struggling for a tone. “My place is in the last century. Before the internet, before
Tony swiped the blueberries from right under Steve’s hand, walking around the island with them. “Skeptics to my skepticism don’t get blueberries.” Steve rolled his eyes, folding hands across his chest while the freelance genius hogged the berries. “An organization following you never means well.”
His nanotech quickly worked to insulate the back of armor, building-tops visible between the obstructing claws alerting him impact was imminent. The ground came hard, armor and Chitauri bodies slamming into pavement with a force hard enough to rattle the insides of Tony’s skull. It wasn’t until the ringing in his ears dulled that he could even process Friday’s attempt to warn him. Blood ran down nose, ears -- and yet the Chitauri continued on, acting as if the impact had done nothing but pin Tony down. Claws scraped holes through his faceplate, and Tony’s arms raised to attempt and block a lethal blow while his armor healed. “Friday--grab Thor’s attention for me.” Tony hissed through bloodied teeth, hoping lightning could thin the growing amount of Chitauri on his fast-disintegrating suit.
The rest unfolded in a blur. Gunshots sprayed across his shield, accomplishing nothing as Steve launched it towards the figures outlined by gunfire, narrowly escaping bullets with a quick tuck and roll. Steve counted three impacted grunts, jumping in time with the vibranium hum to clasp the rim and twist it back midair into the one still standing. All that remained when Steve’s feet hit the floor was the soft ring of vibranium on its return down the hall.
“I don’t think it’s that simple.” Rhodey’s eyebrows furrowed, leaning in a little closer to the table. “Are you talking about for the world? Or for us?”
He shrugged. “I have.” When Steve’s face prompted for more, Tony continued. “One wrong number at a time.” He plainly stated.
All noise stopped. Steve rubbed his eyes, blinking away the streaks of blue still branding his vision.
looking forward to that conversation.” Considering they showed up before the decade was over. Tony’s eyes aimlessly wandered to the side, watching the lazy flow of town pass by the storefront. Everything seemed so peaceful, so ordinary, yet—
“We’re offering you the truth.” Thirteen replied. “Dugan and Mortia were KIA. The rest retired and died of natural causes.” Her words were the cherry on top of the fucking cake he’d had today.
The next corridor pulsed gently, the soft blue glow eerily reminiscent of Tony’s core. Steve tensed, afraid it’s cooldown was near its end, but the weapon made no noise indicative of firing. He could see it through the barely standing wall, discarded, alone, without an owner to guide its trajectory.
This facility hadn’t been used in decades, no lights, no generator -- nothing. It was an empty shell, just like Zemo’s bunker.
“Straight ahead! Here!” Eyes caught the light, nothing more important to Steve than protecting its owner. He put his serum to the test, avoiding a slab of concrete by millimeters in his mad dash for Tony.
“I--” Steve’s shoulders sagged, his expression that of a guilty puppy. “I got carried away. Caught up in my thoughts.” He’d offer to pay for a replacement, but they both knew he didn’t have a dime to his name. Tony continued his gait, expression unreadable. Neither one of them broke eye contact until the shorter of the two stopped beside him.
Steve scoffed, eyes locked on Tony. “You should know something about me.” Quicker than that genius brain could process, Tony’s legs swept out from underneath him, a flurry of limbs plummeting for the ground as he gasped his surprise.
“Oh god.” Steve sank to his knees, sheathing his flashlight as he placed a gloved hand against their chest. Still breathing -- oh god, he was
He led them through the dusty corridor, the sunlight fading with each step. Soon they were engulfed in darkness -- save the soft muted glow through Tony’s shirt. He adjusted shield strappings, struggling through the void until a bright light caught the corner of his eye. Tony carefully angled the phone flashlight, providing them with just enough light to pick up the pace.
like the odds of. To make those odds worse, they were clawing, biting, screaming at the armor -- and Tony was paling watching heavy dustings of nanotech shed.
Minutes felt like hours down here; there must have been dozens of corridors and hallways to explore. He gave an unnerved glance to the man beside him, hoping his coordinates had been right. Even with unexplored hallways, they had yet to run into any SHIELD agents.
Ross. But it was a compromise for the people. So they felt safer knowing the Avengers had their ‘best interests’ in mind when dealing with situations. But what had that cost, for them -- for
Steve’s nose scrunched. “Just as much trouble back then too, huh?” Tony’s foot kicked into Steve’s leg, laughing the brief discomfort away.
are the anomaly.” Steve ducked his head the whole way down, shoulders brushing against the narrow walls.
Steve frowned, pausing in his steps. “How did you know about that?” He asked, but Tony ignored his question, slowly leading them to a kitchen that sprawled for eons.
Tony simply stared without words as Steve punished himself -- like he always seemed to do. He pulled fingers away, surely to remove himself from underneath Steve, but the hand cupped his jaw, calloused thumb running along his cheek. “Maybe you do.”
“I haven’t agreed with your father much lately, but I can agree with him on that,” said Tony, placing a kiss on Peter's forehead. “We love you so much Peter, and I haven’t regretted adopting you for a second.”
“Steve! You won! You WON!” yelled Tony gleefully, giving Steve a quick harsh kiss before pulling him off the chair and pushing him in the direction of the stage. Steve walked numbly to where Mr. Fury was standing, only saved from bumping into the crowd because everyone respectfully made a path for him to walk through. Even as he walked up to the stage, he had no idea what was happening. He had won? But
“I feel great now, though,” said Steve, lifting the sheets up to peer at his leg, which looked almost normal. “Can I leave?”
Steve and Tony had spent a few days together in the happy bliss of being a new couple, but a couple of days ago, it had hit them both at the exact moment that they’d be competing against each other, in the finals of an internationally-televised baking show. Steve may have been in love with Tony for over a year, but he’d had his fiery, competitive streak in him since the day he was born, and he wasn’t going to let his newfound relationship get in the way of his baking and TV success.
The team let out a unanimous sigh of understanding. They’d all been there, after all, for the epic screaming match between their leaders, after one of their first missions together as a team after the Battle of New York. It had gotten heated and ugly, with neither of them willing to back down, and Tony had exploded and said some not-exactly-very-nice things to Steve before storming away. He’d avoided Steve like the plague that week, locking himself in his workshop and only coming up to the communal floor for meals if he knew Steve wasn’t there.
“I wasn’t mad about the kitten because you didn’t tell me, or because I was worried about the property damage. It was just… the fact that the great Captain America was
Steve couldn’t tell you how it happened, if you asked him later. All he knew was that he tightened his grip on Tony’s hand, and, somehow, seconds later, they were kissing like they hadn’t in a long time. Possibly over two years.
“You weren’t exactly hiding it, Steve,” Natasha snorted. “Holding hands under a blanket? Are you guys still in eighth grade?”
Bucky and Peter’s pies were, if possible, even worse than Natasha’s and Bruce’s had been. Peter’s crust was more crumble than dough, which at least explained why he was coated head to toe in flour — none of it had made it into the bowl. Bucky’s dough was good enough — the same kind he’d grown up learning to make with Steve — but the instant a slice was cut out of his pie, the filling leaked out and onto the judges’ shoes, leaving them with nothing but a U-shaped piece of crust.
“That’s not how this works, Barton,” Fury barked, and even the normally placid Mary seemed completely done with Clint.
Thor was doing, except that he didn’t seem to have started on his pie at all. The Avengers had taken good care to emphasize to him that perfect measurements were an absolute necessity in baking, so now, while the rest of the team had moved on to kneading or rolling out their prepared dough, Thor was still measuring out his flour and water to the exact level of the measuring cup, groaning in frustration when it was off even the tiniest bit.
He focused hard on getting the cheesecake topping right, knowing how finicky cream cheese was to work with. He was so focused that, when a slight smell of burning reached his super-sensitive nose, he didn't register it as anything except the equipment overheating. It took him a couple of minutes to react.
“Look on the bright side,” said Steve cheerfully, “When the news of our divorce breaks, SI stocks are gonna go through the roof.”
“I’ve loved you since the day you walked into my office and asked me to come to Tokyo with you because you’d forgotten a meeting. I had nothing packed, I didn’t have my passport on me, but you dragged me there anyway. And then you paid off my student loans in return.” Steve paused, trying to get himself under control. “How did you never see that?”
The one benefit of having lost the serum was that Steve could now use regular human painkillers, which Tony frantically yelled at the doctors as he was dragged away.
“Well, you should have managed your time better, Thor,” said Bruce kindly, petting him on the shoulder. Thor ignored him, grabbing his hammer and striking it on the grass. Almost immediately, there was a clap of thunder, and a bolt of lightning hit the top of the marquee, the air sizzling around them. Before anyone could so much as blink, the storm disappeared, leaving nothing behind except a faint sense of static electricity.
“This is all your fault,” Steve grumbled quietly, and the kitten made his way up Steve’s shirt, grabbing on with his little paws until he was settled on Steve’s neck. He nestled his tiny head in the crook of Steve’s neck, purring softly. “Giving me a shoulder to cry on, huh?” Steve smiled, scratching the back of his little ears. “I take it back. You’re the best thing that’s happened to me since I came out of that stupid ice.” Bucky Jr. purred again, softer this time.
Peter picked up his bags and walked sullenly to the room at the furthest end of the cabin, away from the other two and the common areas. He still hadn’t said a word to either of his parents, and Steve felt the guilt grow stronger as he was left alone with Tony.
for weeks now because every time I come here, I’m so busy watching you that I don't actually read anything!” Steve took a deep breath. “I really— really like you, Tony.”
He continued his internal pep talk as he pushed the door of the communal viewing room, but paused as he took in the sight in front of him. His heart sank into his chest, even as he smiled shyly at the assorted Avengers gathered around the television. He looked at Tony, and Tony just gave him an apologetic shrug.
Pulling out, Tony quickly wiped Steve up and then slipped into the bed beside him. He pulled Steve into his arms, cuddling him until he fell asleep. He noticed how stiff and uncomfortable Steve was in his arms, and made a mental note to tell the doctors to up his dose of painkillers.
Nick and Mary took a mouthful of Wanda’s pie at the same time, and spat it out almost immediately afterwards.
confidence that my dear old dad would have loved you,” said Tony, rolling his eyes. “Actually, there’s no ‘would have’' in that sentence; he loved you. You were practically the son he never had.”
“Yes, yes, Nick is correct,” said Mary quickly, cutting the men off before they could devolve into a fistfight. “Captain, Tony, I must say I am very disappointed in you both. I truly believe you were men of integrity, and now I come to find out you are not even good bakers.”
“Fuck you too, J.” Tony glared at a camera in the corner, and then glared at Steve when JARVIS didn’t reply. “Fuck you, Steve, you know how much work I have to do and I need to choose my own stopping points; you can’t just come in here and make me shut everything down when you want me to stop because some of this stuff is really time-sensitive and— mmf!”
“No!” yelled the room, almost in chorus. Natasha picked up the slack. “Steve, we watched you almost die. Just… listen to the doctors, okay? Just this once.”
— as he started on measuring out yeast and sugar, trying to stick as closely to the recipe as possible. Fifteen minutes later, he was kneading the mixture carefully, watching it grow from wet crumbles to a smooth dough.
“Let’s not talk about it,” he said. “We’re not talking about anything that happened more than 24 hours ago. Please.” He frowned up at Steve. “Except the beard. That’s new.”
