Dean followed the employees down the hall and into some office. He dropped to his knees and kept his eyes trained on the ground, he had never actually been inside an office before, who even was this alpha? Without wanting make any sort of eye contact all he could see was that the alpha seemed to be dressed in something almost like a suit he dare say, maybe he was some sort of business man, scratch that, what if he owned some sketchy omega center as well? He was being sold to a businessman, that was basically the same as being sold to a brother, his worse nightmare was happening right now, and he couldn’t do anything about it except accept it. Dean had lived quite a long life for an omega, he had had more alphas than he could remember, sure he kept some quite unpleasant memories and marks from some but overall he couldn’t complain, he had heard stories about what some alphas had done to their so called pets and all of a sudden his masters didn’t seem so bad. But this new alpha didn’t give any reassurance to Dean, who would even buy such an old whore?
Hi ^^
“Did you make dinner?”
Castiel turned off his computer and stretched, it had been a few hours since he had left Dean all by himself, he should check on him. When he opened the door, Dean was right there kneeling,
“Yes alpha”
The alpha got up the stairs and Dean kept following him, “this is your room, it’s just across the hall from mine and should allow you some privacy”, his own room, was this alpha for real? Why would someone give an omega their own room, this must have been all part of his test to see if Dean knew his place. The room was way too good to belong to an omega, it had a real bed with a lot of blankets that look softer than any he had ever seen before, it also had a huge window with a view to the forest, “the house is pretty isolated but the good side is that the view is great, at least I think so” Dean didn’t dare to look up but it sounded like his alpha was actually smiling when he said that.
“It’s ok, you can eat”
“On the right is my office, you’re free to walk around but don’t disturb me when I’m working”
Dean was woken up by the care takers spraying him off with cold water. ‘Get the fuck up you lazy whore’ Dean got down on his knees as fast as he could, cracking them hard on the floor in the process, ‘Your new alpha is already waiting for you, better not keep him waiting’. New alpha? Dean had spent the last few months at the center and he honestly didn’t think he would ever be leaving, he was getting old and it’s not secret alphas prefer younger omegas, he had also had quite the handful of masters, they would get tired of him and return him. Dean was still very grateful none of them actually thought about selling him to a brothel, he had been to the training center a handful of times but that didn’t compare to being as an omega whore. There were no laws whatsoever regarding an omegas wellbeing, as long as the alphas didn’t kill them, they were good, and that wasn’t even about the omega it was just a business matter. Being owned by a twisted alpha was already hard enough, Dean didn’t even want to think what it would be like to be fucked every night by a different twisted alpha, or multiple alphas.
“I’ll have to go downstairs to work on something but I’ve got you some new clothes so you can shower and change but I’m afraid they’ll be too big on you. Anyway, call me if you need anything”
“Yes alpha”
Dean followed his master to the car and knelled inside, for all he knows this new alpha doesn’t play around, but for a second, he could swear the alpha let out a surprise sound, why would he be surprised, what was he expecting, he might not be the perfect omega but he still knows his place. The alpha started driving and Dean does his best not to hit his head on the seats or fall. After what seemed like 10 minutes of driving the car stops, ‘Are you hungry? I’ll grab you something to eat while I fill up the tank’, and there it was Dean thought, the alpha had already began to test him, he didn’t know what the alpha wanted from him but one thing was for sure, he had had enough of this little mind games with his previous alphas to know this was a test and he wouldn’t keep making the same mistakes. ‘No alpha’, a good omega knew not to beg for food, he would eat when and if his master decided it was the right time.
“Good,” Cas replies, running his soft fingertips down to Dean’s groin, where his cock is indeed stiffening where it lies. Cas strokes the underside, teasing the ridge under the head, before moving his hand down to Dean’s balls, rolling them in his palm.
“Gonna come,” he managed to say, his voice rough with pleasure.
The squeeze became a clench as a voice, her voice, drifted across the breeze, mingling with the quiet conversation of the trees. He almost thought he’d imagined it, as one often does in these situations, but then it came again. Calling him, his name.
He wanted to fuck into his fist, but balance was hard when he was perched like this on the edge of the desk, with his knees pressed as far as they could go to either side. Instead he settled for watching Daddy watch him, twisting his hand on the upstroke, slow and firm, his eyes hooded as he put on a show. He was close, breathing hard as he worked his hand over himself.
Dean watched as Castiel nursed his drink, eyes closed and his head tipped back, letting out an occasional noise when Dean found a knot. He worked until his hands ached, and then kept going.
“Good timing on my part.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Castiel said, his hand sliding out of Dean’s pocket.
“No Dean, I know how you get when you been all by yourself, and I’m sayin’-”
“You gonna stop by and see Sam on your way out?” Dean asked, at least trying to figure out if his father was heading east through Chicago or not.
“I mean I want to, but I want you to fuck me more.”
“I just thought maybe you had a home base somewhere.”
Cas was quiet, letting time unfold before him, and eventually Dean moved to leave the interstate, steering them to a small bar on a smaller highway.
“Are you into men?” the man asked him back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, we can’t have that.”
“Mm. I had my brother too, but he... Doesn’t hunt anymore.” Dean said, swallowing thickly.
“Sometimes,” Dean replied, blushing a little. It wasn’t a well known fact, but he’d come to accept that that’s how he was.
“Good boy,” Daddy said, easing his panties back in place and helping him stand up straight, “You’re forgiven.”
“Nah, dude.” Ash said, “Wish we were going to Albuquerque though, that place sounds badass.”
Soon enough Daddy’s hips stuttered to a stop and Dean felt come spread hot and thick behind his balls. He thought of what Daddy had said about combing it out of his pubes and was suddenly very grateful that he’d been waxed clean.
Dean wandered back to his rooms, feeling a little dazed as he got dressed again, swapping the expensive new t-shirt for his old, thread-bare one.
There was a door directly across from him, between the vanity and the sofa. To his right, was an archway leading to the biggest wardrobe Dean had ever seen. There were drawers and shelves and rows of hangers. There was a floor length mirror, presumably for him to stare at himself as he got dressed in whatever his Boss had requested to see him in.
“Aw,” Cas says, taking Dean’s face in his hands, “I’m gonna take good care of you, baby. Come upstairs. And bring your new toys.”
His cock ached.
“Isn’t that the fed?” He heard a bingo player behind him say.
Dean leaned his head against the window, watching as the lights of Chicago approached. He felt sick, a dull throb behind his eye and his guts like lead as he thought about his father.
Dean looks at the box in his hands, unsure.
“Howdy. I heard you have a dog problem.”
It leapt through the air at the sound, snarling as the rifle was knocked askew from Dean’s hands, the both of them flung backwards off their chairs.
Dean hums his agreement, tilting his hips to give Cas easier access.
“The thing was called a Crocotta,” Dean interrupted, “And probably your dentist was long dead. It was just wearing his skin.”
Dean puts his coffee on the table, and takes the first gift, turning it over in his hands.
“Go to the living room, we’ll have some lunch,” he said, running his lips along Dean’s neck.
“Ah.”
“Rule number one is that you don’t hang around after a hunt.”
Cas laughs and pulls out, come and lube leaking out in his wake. He splays out across the bed, exhausted.
“You can come whenever you like,” Daddy said, sitting up to watch Dean move, taking his hands with him.
Fuck.
“Yes, as a matter of fact. Not that I care to share with the class.”
Dean laughed nervously, a small huffing sound as he sat there in his new clothes, in this ridiculously expensive room, with a man who could kill him and make it look like a tragic accident.
“Where are we going?” Dean asked, hesitating before following her out the door.
By ten o’clock the next day, Dean had checked into the only room at the Bed and Breakfast and talked his way into the town’s police station. He spoke with the Sheriff about the bodies that had been found in the woods, realizing that he’d probably slept near whatever this thing was, if there was a thing at all.
“It should,” Cas replies, “Just relax baby, let me know when you’re ready again.”
“That sounds foolproof.”
“Like, right now?” Dean asks, mildly incredulous.
“Look at that, man,” He said loudly, walking back to the car after retrieving the can, “Shot through the heart.”
“And what way is that?” Ash asked, only half indignant.
Castiel sighed, rubbing a hand across his jaw, his eyes looking far less scary than they had thirty seconds ago.
“I get that you want to share,” he whispered, “But do you have to share so close?”
Dean nodded frantically, eyes wide with fear.
“What did you hear,” he asked, voice low.
“No, really,” Castiel said, twisting in his seat to look at his friend, “When he came in, I heard him growling, and he had all these teeth, like he was half shark.”
“Nah, it feels weird tonight,” Castiel replied, “Let’s just get home.”
He didn’t have to strain for long, because the fabric twitched slightly, and before he knew what was happening, his Boss was in the cozy dressing room with him.
“Not here, obviously.” Dean said, a smile flashing across his face.
“Cas, is this a fleshlight?” He says, tearing off the paper.
“Is entering a major city a good idea?” Castiel asked Dean, who shrugged.
This though, this was different. Daddy’s tongue was like magic, flicking gently along his rim, swirling against him and then pressing against his hole, wet and slippery tongue spearing into him. Dean had been sleepy and relaxed, but soon he was strung tight, desperate for more, pressing his ass back against his Daddy’s mouth as Daddy licked him open, moaning against Dean’s hole like he was the one being pleasured.
“Sure,” Castiel said, “In that case, another rule number one is to always be well rested in order to kick ass and take names, alright? So go lie down before you get any more sleep deprived.”
A wink was heavily implied.
If Dean spread them, she was going to get an eyeful of his crown jewels. He really didn’t want this woman near his dick and balls but on the other hand, he enjoyed his kneecaps the way they were. There wasn’t really any other choice here; he took a deep breath and let his knees fall open.
Getting colder, Dean grabbed the discarded shorts, and went to his powder room. The come was now sticky and gross against his skin, and peeling off the thong was the worst of it. He dropped it into the empty hamper, pitying whoever was going to have to deal with the mess they’d made.
“Oh,” Dean said again, “Uh... Honestly, I’m not sure what to expect. I’m guessing a time-out is off the cards?”
“We are.” Was the response he got, as they car began to reverse at breakneck speed, right down the road.
Castiel turned back around to face the front, the progress of the sunrise having flooded the whole sky. He could see better through the windshield.
The service door clicked again, and Isaiah walked in, pushing a big silver food cart in front of him, laden with their breakfast. The boss was served first; granola and yoghurt, fresh fruit salad, a small, steaming teapot, and a plate of crispy bacon.
That sentence alone makes Dean stiffen in his pants, and he turns to Cas.
“Oh man, did you get one of them bagels?” Ash asked excitedly, poking around in the paper bag.
The kiss was messy, and so hot that if Dean hadn’t just come, he’d have been hard in an instant. They spent a while on the sofa, making out and just touching each other, until Daddy’s cell phone dinged, the noise ringing out in the quiet of the office from where it sat on Daddy’s desk.
“Oh? You've been thinking about what I might like?” Daddy asked, his thumbs rubbing soothing circles against Dean’s sides.
“Reassuring.”
A guy with a mullet, who Dean presumed to be Ash, came through from the kitchen, a joint in his hand.
“Fuck off,” Dean said, “I’m not doin’ that. You can smash my kneecaps in if you want, but I’m not gonna go around hurting people just because you decided I owe you money.”
“It’s not too bad. Plus, it’s my birthday. I’ll get fucked as hard as I like.”
“Yeah, buddy. Ghosts, ghouls, water spirits. All that stuff.”
“There you are,” Castiel said, the corners of his mouth lifting ever so slightly.
Come join me! mom-i-watch-gay-porn.tumblr.com !
It was freezing outside, and Dean huffed as he followed today’s goon to the big black SUV parked in the street. He hoped this one had seat warmers.
Dean stood, a little shaky on his feet, and moved over to where his Boss still sat.
“Put your shoes on, you’re comin’ in,” the goon said.
He spent most of the day like that, lounging on his velvet sofa in his pretty knickers, drinking coffee and reading a book on Chicago history that he’d found in the living room. It was nice. He hoped he was getting paid, but he wouldn’t be overly mad if today was a write off.
Dean’s hands tightened, fingers digging into Cas’s skin as he picked up his pace, fucking recklessly into Cas’s hand.
“God, look at you,” Daddy muttered, more to himself than to Dean.
He cut himself off, and then Dean felt the blunt head of a cock pressing against his thighs. Daddy pushed his legs together, and Dean took the hint, squeezing his thighs as much as he could as Daddy started to fuck the hot, wet space between his legs, cock head nudging his balls every now and then. Dean pushed back into it, hoping to make it feel good for his Daddy, wanting to please him.
“It’s sexy,” Dean said, “It adds anticipation.”
The drive to Tulsa was a loud one, as Dean had made the executive decision to play Black Sabbath most of the way there. Castiel didn’t mind too much - he preferred the sound of tires on the road, but music wasn’t too big a distraction. Even with Ash aggressively drumming on thin air in the back seat.
“Fine.”
“So you’re going to stay?” Dean asked, trying and failing to sound casual, “With me?”
“I’m glad,” Cas replied, “I liked it a lot too.”
“Not a Bon Jovi fan, I take it.” Dean said.
“I—All of it,” Dean choked out, fists clenched as he blushed hard.
He leaned in, pausing once to make sure Dean knew what was about to happen. Their noses touched, brushing gently together, and then their lips touched, in much the same way. He pressed deeper, wanting to feel Dean’s mouth against his. Dean’s fingers gripped tighter at his waist, pulling him closer, until they were chest to chest, kissing at the end of Cas’s bed.
“Not quite,” the man replied, eyes seeming to twinkle at him.
“I only ask, because I like men,” Cas carried on, wanting to break the silence, to make this as easy as possible.
His mouth started watering almost immediately, saliva pooling in his mouth as he tried not to dribble onto his Boss’ pants. He also didn’t want to swish it around too much, knowing it would be too stimulating.
“Well,” Dean said, hoping to sound casual, “I hope you don’t owe anyone money, you’d make a terrible courtesan.”
“Grooming?” Dean asked, looking over his shoulder at Hannah as Helen pushed him down a hallway.
“Anything,” Dean replied quickly, his mind suddenly blank of every food he’d ever liked, “uh, I really like bacon cheeseburgers. With heaps of fries. And a beer.”
“A Chupacabra?”
Dean closed his eyes, moaning as Castiel pressed firm, wet kisses against his lace-covered dick, almost more than he could bear.
“Well. He’s not here, is he? That makes it your debt,” Hannah said, still smiling.
In contrast to Dean’s relief, Castiel felt exposed and bare without the steep slopes of rock and tree that he’d looked at every morning. He didn’t think much of what he’d seen of South Dakota so far -it was just as dusty and barren looking as the last few hours of Wyoming. The only green was smattered across distant hills, and he wasn’t used to the beige of dry grass and bare dirt in the summer. The tan of the earth outside was mimicked in the interior of the car and he thought that perhaps he’d never been so trapped in his life. But perhaps not - He’d run away with a man who he was sure could alter police records, into the dark with another guy who had a box filled with identification for every investigative service in the country.
“No,” Daddy said, “Look at me.”
“In here,” Helen said, opening a plain white door to a small room with what looked like a kind of massage table. The space was filled with the overwhelming scent of lavender, and Dean felt like he might choke on it.
“Dude, you gotta shower and then we’re out of here.” Dean said, nudging at him.
“I heard you walked off your shift last night, is that true?” Jerry asked, getting straight to business.
He had a quick shower, just to get the semen off of him. It didn’t seem sexy anymore and he mostly just felt dirty, slutty and disgusting for wanting this so bad. It was just a job, he reminded himself, this was what he did now, and if his boss wanted to come on him, then he would. What Dean wanted didn’t really factor in. He scrubbed himself angrily, and got dressed again in his pajamas from the previous evening. Time to wear his shitty old clothes back to his shitty old apartment.
“I—,” Dean floundered, not wanting to lie, but also not wanting to get into trouble.
“Dean,” he said, his hand resting on the canvas of his bag as though to steady him, “Do you like men?”
Castiel hadn’t looked at someone like that in a long time. He felt an unfamiliar warmth settle in his stomach when Dean turned to meet his gaze, tipping his head in an indication that it was time to leave.
“Come here,” Boss said as he climbed into bed, indicating for Dean to do the same.
“Yeah,” Dean said, closing his eyes in embarrassment, his face hot with shame.
“Well, you need to keep your energy up.”
“I want the panties...” He mumbles, his eyes closed.
His Boss had a great smile, Dean noticed, watching as it spread across the man’s face at his greeting.
Dean slumps down in his seat, grumpy about his hard dick, and his stupid boyfriend denying him orgasms on his birthday. What an asshole.
“Nah, I gagged it.” Dean said, gesturing to the .22, which Castiel handed back to him.
“Good boy,” Cas says, moving between Dean’s spread legs.
“Get on with it,” Daddy said, eyes flicking down to where Dean’s cock still stood, hard and leaking, “And take your shirt off.”
Ash snorted.
“More than a little,” Daddy said.
He sighed, and moved to get dressed, hoping that he’d somehow forget what he heard.
“That’s why we got Ash stationed by the house.”
“Next to me please,” his boss said, gesturing to the seat on his right. Good, Dean thought, at least he wouldn’t have to look out the window from this god-awful height while they ate.
They were across the road from a cemetery. Everything about it felt upper-middle-class, right down to the perfectly manicured flower-beds and the clean wrought-iron fence. They walked quietly, along the winding paths of the graveyard towards a square stone building. It seemed to rise out of the ground like a natural feature, surrounded by mist. On paper, it was stereotypical, but the unease Cas felt was genuine and real.
“This sure is something,” he said to Hannah as he left the bathroom, noticing her leaning against the doorframe to the powder room.
Dean smiled at Cas, a warm thing in the middle of a cold night, and hauled out his bolt cutters, snipping through the padlock on the gate as though by rote, catching the chain before it clanged against the bars.
Ash grinned at him, and cracked open a beer.
“Good boy,” Daddy said, leaning heavy across his back.
Dean remembered his come, and wiping it up with his hand before licking it off his fingers, wanting to do it now before it was cold and disgusting.
“Sounds a bit unfair, don’t you think?” Dean managed to say.
“I’m going to blow you later, I think,” Cas said, rubbing his thumb against Dean’s tip, “Would you like that?”
“I think I could knock someone out with this,” He says, weighing it in his palm.
He heard the muffled sound of footsteps on soft carpet, and then curtains being pulled behind him, and then finally, finally, felt a warm hand against his shoulder that he instantly knew belonged to his boss.
It was dark in the living room, the only light coming from the city beyond the huge windows, when Dean woke suddenly. His legs were cold and he noticed the blanket was gone, but that wasn’t what woke him—there was the heavy weight of someone on top of him. He stiffened, moving to get his arms underneath him when he heard a voice.
“What are we celebrating, Boss?” Dean asked, aware that Isaiah was still in the room.
“You liked being my dirty little secret?”
“We should go to Mount Rushmore. It’s near here, it’s tourist season, and if we’re lucky, they won’t have put our faces on the news yet.” Ash said from where he lay, his voice rolling in from the backseat, dusty and deep.
They all behaved the same, too. Ushering him into a black SUV and ignoring him for the entire drive to Chicago. Hannah met him at the elevator, leading him in and pushing the button for the forty-ninth floor. She was on her phone again, tapping furiously at the screen as she blindly led Dean down the hall and through the Door’s of their boss’s residence.
“Shut up.”
“Right, so that would be going around with those assholes out in the hallway, intimidating people?” Dean asked.
“I think the point is that you would want to.” Castiel said, his voice quiet.
I got a little carried away describing Dean's powder room area, so feel free to skip the first little bit if you aren't at all interested lmao. No hard feelings!
“Fair enough,” the man replied, still smiling, “If you feel unsafe, you may say ‘safe word’. But, please do bear in mind, if you use the safeword constantly to get out of every single thing I ask of you, I’ll have to send you back to Hannah for reassignment.”
Dean nodded, hoping he could take Daddy at his word.
“Is this sexy?” Daddy asked, “Do you feel this is increasing your enjoyment, by adding anticipation?”
Now, though. Sunshine streamed in through the windows, and Cas could see the dust-motes in the air. He felt Dean shift against him, gentle movements that indicated he was awake.
“I guess. I wasn’t really worried about it. You could say I stayed because I had no reason not to. I was waiting for one, I think.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean was caught off-guard, so I took care of the dog problem. He was lucky I was around to protect him, to be honest.” Cas said, deadpan.
“Whatever.”
“Ash!” Castiel shouted, grappling for his gun in the dark.
“Not addressing me properly is a sign of disrespect, Dean,” his Boss said, pinching the flesh of his inner thigh until he squirmed, “Do you really think it’s a good idea to disrespect me?”
“From your file here, it says you owe one hundred and fifty thousand dollars,” Hannah said, closing the folder again, “Are you able to pay that back in a lump sum?”
“Shut up and drink your milkshake.”
“You chose to live there, Ash” Castiel said, gaze settled on the rear-view mirror, “Looking for a dead end to hide in?”
“The chances of that being what?” Cas said, figuratively winking back.
“Life’s unfair,” the man replied, watching him with loosely clasped hands resting between his knees.
“Sorry Daddy,” he murmured back, feeling his cheeks flush harder as his cock throbbed at the sight of it.
“Fair enough,” Cas replies, his eyes closed as he starts drifting off.
“Do you know what a courtesan is?” the man asked him.
“I’m usually far more careful. This creature was a dickbag, lucky enough to be in a small town. Well, lucky for him.”
A glass of ice water was placed in front of him.
“I’m waking up the birthday boy,” Cas says, and then he moves his hips and Dean realizes that there’s a line of heat pressing against the cleft of his ass, that Cas is hard and rubbing himself between Dean’s cheeks.
“Yes, but I don’t see how doing all the things we usually do but in a tent will make them any more exciting.”
Dean stretched a little and then got to work, slipping below the blankets to find where Daddy’s cock lay soft against his hip. It was dark beneath the sheets, so Dean worked by feel, pressing sloppy open mouthed kisses along Daddy’s shaft, licking at him gently, slowly getting him hard. Just as he started laving his tongue over and around the tip of Daddy’s cock, there was a noise in the hallway and suddenly the bedroom door was slamming open.
“Hi Daddy,” Dean said, his voice rough from sleep, “Did I sleep too long?”
“You’d have to beat me off with a stick to keep me away,” Cas mumbled, still drowsy from sleep.
“It’s your special day, and I just want to make you feel extra good,” Cas says, swirling his hips as he moves.
Instead, his Boss tugged him around the desk, pulling out his big leather office chair.
“Fuck,” Dean groaned, echoing Cas’s thought from earlier.
“Look. I ain’t talked to your daddy since nineteen ninety-nine, but if you need him to come hunt with you again, I’m, uh... I’m sure I could persuade him.”
His grip tightened, vice-like, around his Boss’ ankles. He felt a hand on his shoulder, the warmth of his Boss’ palm pressed into his skin. Meant to soothe him, to help him settle.
He felt fabric shifting against his chin, his Boss scooting forward a little, and then there was skin pressed against his lips, soft and silky, the unmistakable blunt head of a cock. He opened his mouth, letting it slide between his lips, resting heavy on his tongue. It felt big.
Castiel let go of him then, his torso dropping back onto the bed with a bounce.
Eight o’clock meant he had ten minutes to pick something out, preferably something comfortable. There was a wall of closets, filled to the brim with suits; business casual, three-piece, a tuxedo. Dean considered showing up to breakfast in a tux, but figured his boss probably wouldn’t appreciate the humour in it. He tried the opposite wall, which was almost entirely drawers. He found soft, folded fabrics, cotton t-shirts and jersey lounge pants.
“Well, I guess I’d better try and win you back then, huh?” Cas asks, settling down on the sofa next to Dean.
Dean felt a bit stunned, held in place by the intense gaze Castiel was leveling at his groin, and all he could do was watch as his boss leaned back in, directly nuzzling his cock this time, feeling the heat of breath against his sensitive skin. The pressure felt so good, nose and wet lips against his flesh wherever the gaps in the lace allowed contact. He brought his hands to rest on Castiel’s shoulders, cupping the base of his skull in one palm, combing his fingers through the short hairs there.
Castiel turned to look at him.
“I know that feeling.” Dean said, more to himself.
He looked at his phone again, thinking about his brother. Sam always said he was fine without any extra money, but Dean knew it made his life a little easier. Now that he was essentially an indentured sugar baby, he was going to have to play the part as best he could to ensure that his Boss felt like being a generous tipper.
Dean blushed again, a thrill going through him at the thought that he’d done well. He wanted Daddy to be pleased with him, to be happy with what he did.
It left Dean a little breathless.
“Please,” He whimpers, not sure he can take much more of this.
“Really?” Daddy said, “Well then, I think my lovely boy deserves a reward for being such a quick learner.”
There was a small triangle of white lace at the back of the thong, where the three straps met just above the cleft of his cheeks. Daddy pulled on it and let it snap back into place, the sound loud after their whispered conversation.
“Sure,” Dean says, “But then I wanna ride you.”
He googled ‘Genesis Enterprises’, but only found some bullshit landing page with generic stock images and a mission statement that was potentially the vaguest thing Dean had ever read. There was no information on who worked for the company, or any contact details. It was clearly a decoy page, and a decoy company name.
“It was my pleasure,” Hannah said, nodding her head once before leaving the room.
“Your father makes you call him Sir?” he asked, sitting down next to Dean, not leaving much room between them.
“Can’t I just send you a portion of my paycheck? Isn’t that how normal people pay back loans?”
“You sit in it, and lean forward,” the Boss said, sitting down to watch as Dean figured out what to do.
“Ash it’s two hours in the opposite direction.” Castiel argued.
“And are you being a good boy?” Daddy said then, taking Dean’s hands in his own.
“Oh, sure.” Dean said, nodding sarcastically.
His boss merely kept watching him. Something about being so exposed, naked and masturbating in front of a fully dressed man, really had Dean going. Being watched, especially by Daddy... He liked it.
Dean suddenly felt small, cold and exposed on the couch, covered in semen. He sat up and reached for the napkins from his dinner, cleaning up the sofa and himself as best he could. He looked over at his boss, who had already put his cock away but left his belt hanging open.
“Carry on,” he said.
Dean clambered off of Daddy’s lap, missing the warmth he felt from being held by strong arms. He felt one hand yank at his lounge pants, and then fell easily to the floor, leaving him in his silk panties, stretched tight around his cock.
It was nice, he thought. Not being lonely.
He climbs onto the bed, and Cas joins him, kneeling there on the covers.
As soon as he sat down, a service door opened somewhere behind him, and a man dressed as a waiter stepped smoothly into the room.
“Yeah, yeah. You’ll be thanking me when you’re stuck somewhere with nothing but lead to help you out. Can Ash shoot?”
Castiel laughed.
“Please, take a seat, Dean,” his Boss said, gesturing to a chair on the other side of the large desk.
“Good. Room for improvement.”
“Answer me,” Castiel demanded, pushing Dean onto his back and holding him there by his neck, the same hand that had jerked him off now threatening to crush his windpipe.
“Everyone makes mistakes,” Dean said, trying not to sound like he was pleading, even though he was, “You said today was difficult. It’s like my fourth day here, so I’m probably the last thing on anyone’s mind.”
It didn’t taste amazing, but Dean knew better than to try and spit it out, swallowing down everything his Boss had spent.
Dean let himself out the front door, where a different Thick-necked man was waiting, holding Dean’s phone. He didn’t get it back until they were three blocks away from the office.
“Come in me, Cas,” He begs, breathless and loose.
“Hello,” Boss said, his deep voice flowing over Dean like hot water in a shower.
“Okay,” Dean murmured back, “You can have me.”
Dean didn’t look in his pocket until he got home, over an hour later. He pulled out the little roll of cash, to see what he’d made that day—five crisp bills, all benjamins. He was stunned. Numb. He had no idea what to feel. Deciding to worry about it in the morning, he put the bills with the rest of his cash, and got ready for bed.
He felt the rumble of Dean’s laughter under his hand.
“You have a great ass, by the way,” he mumbled, grabbing two generous handfuls.
Dean felt like he was in deep shit.
Dean thought about that for a moment, realizing it was probably his best bet to just go along with it. The chances of him being kidnapped were slim, and it probably was best to do everything he could to ensure his Boss’s privacy remained intact, lest he face the consequences. He slipped the bag over his head, and tried not to freak out about it.
The most gutting part though, so embarrassing he could hardly bear to think about it, was how Dean’s stomach flipped over every time he remembered the way his Boss had touched him, kissed him, licked his skin, and pressed himself down on top of Dean.
“It won’t. The tracks have been coming from this direction, every time.”
Castiel stopped to look at him.
“Mm,” Cas agreed, “After breakfast.”
He heard a slick noise behind him, but his face was still pressed against the table. There was a grunt, and then a warm splash across his jaw.
“Are you being a tease?” his Daddy asked, pinning him with a firm look, his eyes piercing right through Dean.
“For being belligerent with me yesterday,” his boss said, watching Dean closely.
Castiel had thought on this for a bit, clearing the last of his fries from the plate.
“I want you to wear these home,” Daddy said, retrieving Dean’s panties from the floor.
“Good. You will also start at nine o’clock, and stay here until dismissed. If that means ten, twelve, sixteen hours days, then so be it. I don’t employ slackers.”
First he checked the dining room, wanting to see if there was anyone there. Then he wandered around. The place was huge. There were multiple bedrooms, a library, another spacious lounge, a huge board room with a long table and a dozen chairs. Finally, tucked away between a smaller meeting room and a spacious bathroom, he found a kitchenette. It was more like a break area in an office than a kitchen, with only a microwave to cook anything in, and a fridge filled with bottled water and champagne.
“Dean...”
“That’s too bad.”
He pointedly kicked Dean’s lounge pants to the side, before leading him out of the room with one hand still holding tight to the back of his neck. Dean felt exposed, walking through the apartment in a pair of women’s panties with a raging erection, but it wasn’t like anyone was going to see him, he supposed.
“Can I ask something?” he said, handing the signed document back to his Boss, who just raised his eyebrows, waiting for the query.
“My apologies about today, it won’t happen again,” she said, hands clasped behind her back, meeting his eye with the kind of intensity of someone who prides themselves on their work.
“I’d deserve it,” Dean said, like he was admitting a secret, “I want you to think about me all the time. Means I’m doing my job right.”
Then Dean felt fingers on his nose, pinching him, and suddenly he couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t pull his head back, and when he tried to open his mouth wider, his Boss would just push in more, filling him up, cock nudging at his throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hannah joined him in the backseat, pulling out her phone immediately.
He blushed at that, that he’d admitted it at all, but the look Castiel gave him made it all worth it. Suddenly Castiel was leaning forwards, and Dean felt a flash of heat in his stomach as his boss pressed his face against Dean’s crotch, rubbing his face slowly against the soft fabric. His nose nudged Dean’s cock, which was starting to show interest in the current proceedings.
“I won’t ask again,” Daddy said, his voice quiet but dangerous, sharp like the blade of a well hidden dagger.
“I slept great,” Cas said, “And then I was unconscious for a few hours.”
“It can’t hurt. I mean, in a small town, the fewer people around, the fewer people to see us, right? But the fewer people that those folks see everyday. We’d stick out like a bunch of sore thumbs. Not good. In a city, there are more people to spot us, but no one’s going to be looking.”
“Hannah says you’re having some debt troubles,” his Other Option said to him.
Dean felt his cheeks flame as he stuck his tongue out, licking through the puddle on the table-top, licking at the wood in earnest, lapping up every drop until the only thing left was his spit.
It's important to note that this isn't a roadmap for healthy and safe BDSM, it's a fantasy where things are a bit dangerous and risky. Please do not be this cavalier about BDSM in real life! Technically Dean is coerced into this position so the entire fic is dub-con at best so if that's not your cup of tea, then please be careful reading this. :)
“Ash is right, this is all a bit heavy.” Dean said.
“No diapers,” he said gently, taking Dean’s chin in his hand and carefully studying his face, “It’s just a title. A way to uphold the dynamic between us, you being subservient to me, doing what I ask of you. You can do that, can’t you?”
“And we can go with you?” Castiel asked.
“Yes Daddy,” Dean said, shifting onto his side to ease the burn from sitting on his freshly-spanked ass.
“Dean,” his Boss called after him, his tone slightly softer than it had been a minute ago, “As long as you work for me, you’re under my care. That means something around here.”
He heard Dean get up at one point, but ignored him in favour of shutting his eyes again, pushing Ash to the other side of the bed as he got more comfortable.
“Come here, Dean,” his Boss said, pushing his own chair back from the table.
“Looks like you missed a spot,” Daddy said, his voice raw.
“What?” He growled.
“Hair’s not too bad,” Helen said, “Might need a quick buzz though.” She picked up a small pair of electric clippers and got to work.
“You’re early,” he said as he swung the door open.
“That’s good to know,” Dean replied, remembering that this weird day had been the ‘company onboarding’ that their Boss had mentioned. He’d never had a brazillian be a job requirement before, but there was a first time for everything.
“Let me,” he said, pushing Dean off him a little, so that he could reach between their bodies.
Bobby had yawned through the phone and assured him that all he needed to do was stab the thing in the back of the neck. It was proving a lot harder than it sounded. He’d managed to find it, wearing the skin of some poor guy from town. Dean thought he’d seen him outside the police station at some point.
“Yeah I guess so.” Ash eventually replied, hand coming to rest on his hip.
“Thank you,” Dean said just as quietly, “I wore them for you, Daddy.”
“Good boy,” his boss—Daddy, said, rubbing a soothing hand of the stinging spot on his thigh, “I’m going to help you keep your promise, by making sure you don’t forget.”
“Um, I’m fine,” Dean said, chewing his lip a little, trying not to meet the gaze being levelled at him right that minute.
“Uh, hey Jerry,” Dean mumbled, sitting up straight, “What’s up?”
“Do you think you’ll need a safeword?” his Other Option asked in response, staring right at Dean like he could see into his very soul.
Dean drifted for a moment, sated and warm in the most comfortable bed he’d ever experienced, and jumped a little when he felt a warm washcloth against his stomach.
Dean was hard again, his cock back to its old tricks, a thin line of pre-come dripping down onto the leather beneath him. He felt a finger pressing against his rim. Soon enough it was two, and then Daddy was pressing and curling his fingers inside Dean, his mouth moving down to kiss and lick Dean’s sac as it hung heavy between his legs. Dean’s hands clenched, grabbing at the cushion in front of him, the waves of pleasure rolling through him as Daddy pressed all his buttons.
“We were all set to go camping last night. We got our bags packed and our house locked up. It’ll look like we’re not coming back.”
“Yes,” Cas grits out through his teeth, driving in hard and deep, “My fuck toy, my dirty slut.”
“And how much would that be? How am I supposed to pay my rent?” he asked incredulously, “I need to help my brother get groceries!”
Dean smiled.
The feeling of it was dizzying, knowing that he did that, that his body brought Daddy that pleasure. There was a fire low down in his gut, and it burned right through him. He whimpered again, hips jerking frantically against the sofa as Daddy caught his breath.
“It’s always safer to ask.”
She was going to wax his ass, he just knew it.
“Dean, when it comes to fight-or-flight, I’m a fighting kind of guy and-”
“Seriously? No. Not in my car. I don’t need her smelling the same way as you look.”
“Come in,” Castiel said, his back to Dean as he did up the buttons on a fresh shirt.
They were quiet for a few moments. Castiel stayed turned around, watching the red of the sun bleed into the sky above the empty house they’d left behind. Ash scratched at his stomach.
Castiel was skeptical, having never spent much time riding in cars.
“I’ve never left Wyoming since I arrived here.” Castiel said, gnawing absentmindedly on a piece of ‘Jerky’ that reminded Dean of the time he’d had to wrap a body in PVC plastic before burning it.
“My dad, I guess.”
Dean wakes up slowly, surrounded by heavy warmth.
“It better not,” his Boss said, finally letting go of his chin, “Let’s get this contract signed, we’ll deal with your bad behaviour tomorrow.”
They worked quickly, and no one spoke as smoke and the smell of burning flesh filled the warm air around them. It was quiet, and Castiel did not notice as dawn closed around them for staring into the fire. It had been a week since they left Wilson, and Castiel felt calm. He had made the right choice, he thought.
“Thanks,” Ash said, “I love the vibe of this place. It’s like Rodeo Grunge.”
“Ash, are you nearly done?” He asked, leaning in the door slightly.
“This might take a while,” he said eventually, “Best to just go home. You can shower first, if you want, and call for a car when you’re ready.”
“Damn straight.”
The cashier from last night was there, eyes wide and face pale. Dean didn’t notice it, but it was the face of someone who had just seen a man bare more teeth than anyone had business having.
“...Oh so you can’t sleep when I’m talking, but Ash gargling is fine.”
“Yeah but, like, even so.”
Dean’s jaw drops a little when he opens it. There must be at least fifteen pairs of underwear, all neatly folded. Satin, lace, soft cotton. A pair of silk shorts that will definitely leave his ass hanging out, but he supposes that’s the entire point of them. There are bright jewel tones, and soft pastels, sheer and frilly, as well as a pair of wicked looking black panties that lace up in the back with a length of shiny ribbon.
“Were you busy?” he said, turning his head to the side to try and see his boss better.
“Okay,” Dean said, swallowing down his arousal and panic.
“See you in six weeks,” she said airily as she pushed him back out into the hallway, as though that wasn’t the cruellest thing she’d said since they’d met.
“You don’t have to come, you know.”
“So, uh... You lived your whole life in Wyoming?” He asked.
“Now, mistakes get people killed, but in this case, you managed to not die, or to shoot me. So I’d say you passed.”
“Sure,” Dean said, watching him go, “Is it okay if, uh... Can I put some games on the phone?”
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Dean said, “You got me fired from my job because your goons hauled me away in the middle of a shift. You’re threatening me and my little brother. You send me to get my asshole waxed instead of spending all this time and money and manpower on finding the person who actually took out the loan in the first place. This is your fault, and it sure as hell is your problem.”
This man—his boss, Castiel, stared at him in silence. Dean could practically hear the cogs turning in his head. Dean felt himself yanked up off the bed, held by the throat at his boss’ eye level.
“Breathe a word of this to anyone, and I’ll dismember your brother in front of you, do you understand?”
He called her again, and she replied, and for a moment his heart soared. And then he remembered that he stood in the wood where three people died and that this was probably why. When he didn’t hear her voice again, he got in his car and left, dialling as he drove.
Hannah ushered him through the heavy wooden doors of their Boss’s quarters, and Dean felt his cheeks heat up again as he saw the white sofa where he’d exposed himself the previous evening.
"Good, I'm glad you like it," Castiel murmured, pressing a gentle kiss into Dean's hair. It felt good. “What did you have for breakfast?”
“Like... Like ‘Daddy’ in a gay way, or are you gonna have me crawling around in diapers?” Dean asked, “Because I’m not shitting in my pants for you, dude.”
“Thanks.” Castiel said, “Does this mean we have to shoot guns?”
Castiel was never really sure how he ended up in Wilson. He rented a room in a duplex owned by the butcher, and lived there with Ash, who’d landed in Wilson a few years back, looking for a place to ‘lay low’, as he often said with a wink and a nod. Ash had a mullet, but they got along well. No one was really sure where Ash had come from, but he worked at Jack’s Diner down the road and he bought a lot of beer, so no one really minded him.
It was unfortunate that Castiel chose then to refill his cup, the pouring of the coffee masking the sounds of rustling grass in the still night air. And that he then asked quietly for the time, meaning that Dean was not watching when the stalks around them began to shift. By the time Dean noticed, the dog was on them, and he had but a split second to get the shot off.
“My name, mostly. For me to come find her.”
"Come here," his boss said, holding out a hand and shifting his feet from Dean's lap.
“Good,” Daddy said, “I’ll see you later then.”
“Dude, you just wait for it.” Dean said, wiping his mouth with a napkin.
“That was terrible.” He said, slinging a loose fist in Dean’s direction.
“I shat my pants at The Ring!” Ash said, “Oh god, I’m going to die.”
“My father has some debt troubles, your girl Hannah says it’s my problem now,” Dean replied.
He left that for later, instead choosing to open the other door off the powder room, pushing it open to reveal what was probably the most luxurious bathroom he’d ever seen in his life. He could tell it was expensive, because the tile on the floor was so small and white, shaped like little hexagons.
“Hi Daddy,” Dean said, sounding a lot more breathless than he’d ever admit to.
“Hannah should know better than to forget a member of staff, that’s her job,” Castiel said, moving away from Dean and pulling his phone out of his pocket, tapping away at it rapidly, “You should at least have a way to contact her.” Fury radiated from him.
Cradled in a valley and watched over by mountain peaks, the town was small and quiet - and apparently full. Dean saw no motel, and the one Bed and Breakfast boasted a single bed, and wasn’t open at one in the morning anyway. He thought of finding another motel, but his eyelids felt too heavy to stay open for the fifteen minute drive back to the last town he saw. Dean headed out to the trees at the other end of town, parking beneath them to sleep in his backseat - he would work the case in the morning, there was nothing to be done now.
“You got better things to be doing than baby-sittin’. Dump ‘em off in the nearest city, and be on your way.”
“Receipt?” He asked, not looking at the man.
“Tomorrow though,” Daddy said, interrupting Dean’s thoughts, “I can’t wait any longer.”
There was the sound of curtains being opened. A warm knee bumped into his chest. And then, quite suddenly, there was a hand at the back of Dean’s neck, gripping him so tightly he winced.
Dean followed Daddy’s line of sight, landing on the spot of pre-come he’d drooled on the polished surface.
“There’s also a company credit card attached to the account, so if you need to purchase anything, you can,” Hannah said, “It’s a good idea to check first though.”
Dean nodded stiffly, accepting the pen his Boss passed him, and signing his life away on all the appropriate dotted lines.
“I mean that he is mysterious and multifaceted.”
Comments and kudos fuel the fire in my cold dead heart 🥺
Fingers tightened in his hair again, and his Boss started moving his head for him, pushing Dean down onto his cock before dragging him off again, his hips shoving upwards on the downstroke. It felt incredible, and Dean put himself to work, trying to do all the things he remembered liking about blow jobs.
“Alright,” He continued, “You beauties want to see the sights of Santa Fe, or should we do a little study session on the Chupacabra?”
Dean moved again, laying down next to him.
Dean rolled his eyes, just a little, feeling exasperated with everyone telling him that his father’s fuck up was his to deal with. That’s what people said when they wanted to screw you over.
“Good morning,” He hears in his ear.
“Hello there!” Called a wrinkled woman, waving to him from the porch at the front of the beat-up farm house.
Dean believed the line John fed him, time and time again, telling himself that a new beginning with a fresh perspective might be enough to calm John’s nerves, to help him settle and want to be a father to his adult sons. He knew John was a drifter and a dead-beat but still, his stomach soured every time John proved him right.
“Not yet, babe,” Cas says, “I want you on your knees.”
“If it was a weird baby thing, you’d still do what I asked of you and thank me for the honor. But I assure you, it’s purely perfunctory,” Daddy leaned in, his lips brushing Dean’s ear as he whispered, “Trust me, you’ll be grateful for it later when you’re not combing dried come out of your pubic hair.”
“Don’t worry, it’ll be fun.”
Dean had his t-shirt off in seconds, tossing it somewhere on the floor before taking himself in hand again. It was less than a minute before Dean was back on the cusp, his thighs straining as he tried to shove into the tight circle of his fist, so close to the edge, almost out of his mind.
“Right,” she said, standing up when her phone chimed after barely a minute, “Come with me.”
Dean wasn’t sure why it caught him so off-guard, the whole point of this arrangement was the idea that they’d be having sex. That this man, his new boss, Daddy, would be seeing him naked.
Cas pulls out, and works the cock ring off of his dick, before pushing back in. He’s been ready to go, hard for nearly a full hour, and it only takes a few thrusts before he’s coming hard inside Dean, splashing hot and wet inside of him, working through his orgasm.
“Well, we just have to go to the tailors, and then we can go back to the office,” Hannah said as they stepped into the foyer. Dean watched through the window as Thick-neck appeared, right on time.
Dean paused, fingers drumming on the table top. His eyes were fixed on a point just over Cas’s shoulder, and Cas could feel his indecision as though it were a tangible thing.
“No, you needed it, I suspect. You had a strenuous morning,” Daddy said, massaging something soft into his burning skin, “I would have let you sleep, but I felt compelled to apply lotion to your rear. It looked sore.”
“You get to see where he lives,” Dean pointed out, black bag clenched in one fist.
“A hamburger? You have no class, man.”
, Dean thought.
“You don’t have to eat it,” the Boss said, “You can order something else if you don’t like what they’ve made.”
“Does that feel nice, baby?” He asks, twisting his wrist.
Cas pulls back, his chin shiny with his own spit. There’s lube on the bed next to him, and he skirts some onto his fingertips, rubbing it between Dean’s cheeks. He hikes Dean’s legs up, and slides his dick along the line of Dean’s ass, same as he did the morning, teasing him with slow back and forth movements.
“Depends on where you’re taking us.”
The man let out a soft laugh.
“It’s fine, you’re right on time,” Hannah said, gesturing for him to follow her inside.
“Nope,” Helen answered, her tone awfully cheerful, “I need you up on your knees.”
Especially not powerful, shady business men.
Dean flicked a finger in his direction.
“Tell me what you want, baby,” He says, gentle as anything.
“Just call me Dean.” said Dean, dropping a takeout bag on the bed with a wink.
“Okay,” Daddy said, “Stand up.”
“No way. I’m probably going to die.”
“Alright,” he heard the Boss say, walking back into the room, “You can get up now, I don’t want you getting all cramped up.”
Dean’s chest was like silk under his fingertips, smooth and soft to the touch, skin draped over layers of hard muscle. He needed to know if his shoulders were the same, his back, his legs. Dean’s body was heaven in his hands and he rejoiced as he partook.
“Did it... Bite you?”
Dean could barely focus on what he was doing, shoveling food into his mouth just to keep himself from over-thinking their conversation. His whole body was tense with anticipation, but fear thrummed through him too, unsure as to how far this handsome maniac would take things. Maybe he was about to be in for a world of hurt. There was no way of knowing.
“Of course,” Castiel replied, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, “Do whatever you want with it.”
It seemed like his Boss had an infinite supply of thick-necked men to drive Dean around. Or maybe the one on Thursday morning was one of the ones he’d already met? Dean wasn’t entirely sure, they all looked the same.
Dean frowned at her as he remembered the quiet man from last night and his efficient kitchen staff of one.
They slept that way until the sun came up properly, casting bright light across the floor through the cactus-patterned curtains. It was all a bit much for Castiel.
Cas follows him, laughing a little.
Dean took a deep breath, as quietly as possible. He slid his thumbs under the waistband, and pushed his underwear all the way down. It was a little chilly in the room, but his cock didn’t seem to notice, slowly getting harder as he stood there under Daddy’s sharp gaze.
“That’s not how the law works,” Dean said weakly, desperately trying to make the man across from him see sense.
Dean moaned again, desperate this time. He couldn’t see anything, eyes hidden behind the mask, and fuck if this wasn’t terrifying. His eyes started watering, his vision going fuzzy even though all he could see was darkness. His hands scrabbled at the Boss’ thighs, trying to push himself away. He wouldn’t budge.
He shoved the change back across the counter, unaware that his fingers were on the only money that Dean Winchester had to hold to his name.
“How was that?” He asks, smoothing a hand up Dean’s chest.
“Yes, Daddy,” Dean said again, blushing at the words.
Dean recoiled at that, pulling away from the man’s hand.
He opened it, and there was Thick-neck, waiting on the other side. His neck looked a little thicker this morning. Dean wondered if he’d had any sleep—he’d barely got any himself, and yet Thick-neck looked as fresh as a body-building daisy.
“Oh dear,” Daddy said, his voice a murmur near Dean’s ear, “You seem to have made a mess on my nice table.”
Dean reached down, his hand joining Cas’s for the last few strokes before Cas was there too, his body bending into it as the wave overrode him, his own spend joining Dean’s against his skin in spurts.
Daddy showed him to the door, and before Dean knew it, he was in a different black Rolls Royce, being driven back to Milwaukee at nearly three in the morning. It wasn’t until he was at home, brushing his teeth in the bathroom, that he noticed he’d put both his shirts on inside out.
“That was good at first,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, “But it was... I thought you might kill me.”
It kept him from going into an all-out panic, the calming weight of it against his skin. He focused on the feel of it as he heard the faint sounds of voices, people talking. His Boss was having a meeting it seemed.
At least the thong had worked out, he supposed. He’d have to have a look at what else was in the drawers. He climbed between his own, familiar sheets, resigned to sleeping alone.
“Oh,” Dean coughed nervously, “Uh, sorry.”
Hannah gave a short bow, which felt very weird to Dean, having never bowed or been bowed to in his life, and then she promptly left the room.
“Rise and shine, pretty women,” He said upon his return, “The day is half gone and we’ve only just begun.”
“And this is for you as well,” Hannah said, pulling a phone from her pocket and holding it out to him, “It has my number, for anything you need, and the number of the transport office if you need a car and I’m not picking up. It also has the Boss’ number, but do not call him unless he tells you to. Texts only. Work related texts.”
“Well, you’ve certainly burned all your bridges.”
“Gabriel,” came his Boss’s voice, “Get out.”
“What are you having?” He asked Dean.
“As hot as that would be, you’ve been such a good boy that I think I’ll help you out,” Daddy said, lifting Dean’s hips again and moving in, licking Dean’s skin clean of his spend. He had to roll Dean over and press his thighs up against his chest to get to the tricky spots behind his balls, but he got them all, finally surfacing from between Dean’s legs with pink lips, spit-slick and swollen.
Soon enough he was being shown into another impersonal white reception area, except this one had a little white candle burning. Hannah walked right past reception again, like she’d been there a hundred times before. So far, they hadn’t had to check for appointments at all, everyone was just... Expecting them. Waiting for them to show up. Maybe it was good that Dean was going to be a boy-toy, he wasn’t sure he would ever be organized enough to personally assist anyone like his Boss.
“Here you go.” Dean said, joining Ash and Castiel at their table
“Pants off,” Helen said, walking briskly over to a little station on the other side of the table.
Daddy was still sitting on the ottoman in front of him, his face about a foot away from where Dean was stroking himself, the intense, burning gaze of his eyes focused on Dean and his ministrations. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this turned on. Daddy was looking at him like he wanted to devour Dean, and Dean was just about ready to let him.
“Mm,” Daddy said, pulling away from him, “Maybe a little anticipation can be a good thing.”
He eased his zipper down, so slowly it barely made a noise. Undressing like this, purposefully and methodical, had Dean hardening in his underwear. This became clear as he slid his jeans from his hips, revealing the burgeoning tent that was conveniently right at his boss’s eye level.
It sent a shiver down his spine and he wasn’t sure whether to be creeped out or not. It was a little different than jokingly asking ‘who’s your daddy?’, which wasn’t something he’d ever said anyway, because he wasn’t born in the forties. He sighed, resigning himself to the fact that it wasn’t like he had a choice.
He made sure to cover every part of Dean’s chest, collecting every stray drop on his tongue, before he moved up to kiss Dean, their lips brushing slightly before Daddy pushed a sloppy load of Dean’s come into his own mouth. They made out, pressed against the desk and snowballing his spend back and forward between them in the filthiest kiss Dean had had in a long, long time. If he hadn’t just jizzed all over himself, this alone would have got him harder than diamonds.
“Thank you, Daddy,” Dean said sweetly, batting his lashes in a way that he hoped was coy and alluring.
“Do you make much money?”
“S’good,” Dean answers, sounding sleepy, “You gonna come?”
All he got for his troubles was his Boss’ thick cock back in his mouth, thrusting into him hard as he tried to keep up. It was only a few minutes until he could hear ragged breathing above him, the rhythm growing erratic as his Boss slowed to a stop, fucking in deep one last time and coming, splattering against the roof of Dean’s mouth.
“If you’re into that. I sold it. Moved in with Ash.”
At least he could pay his rent, he reminded himself as he tried to scrub himself clean under the hot spray of the shower. His water pressure was shit, and the shower head was too low on the wall for someone as tall as him. The water pressure in the Genesis Enterprises building was probably incredible, he thought bitterly.
“Good,” Daddy said, nipping at Dean’s lips one more time before rolling them over, Dean on his back with his legs hitched up around his Daddy’s waist, the heavy weight of him delicious.
Dean coughed, stuck half under the corpse as he caught his breath. Castiel helped to roll the body to the side, shakily pulling the rifle from where Dean had forced the barrel between it’s teeth. They were bigger than the Crocotta’s, although there weren’t as many.
“So you cats are free to hit the road, if you like. I can get you some new identities. I’m heading down to Santa Fe to see a man about a Chupacabra. You’re both welcome to tag along, if you got nothing better to do.”
“I wish Chupacabra’s looked like fuckin’ Lassie.” Dean said, tossing crumpled wrappers into the trash.
Castiel had never seen a river so large. He sat for an hour with the window rolled all the way down, his chin resting on his arm as the air rushed by, whipping his hair around his face, watching as the sun sparkled and winked at him in the reflection of the water.
The thing about Hannah was that she was essentially the executive assistant to a mobster. But, Dean reasoned, she’d helped him land this cushy position so that he wouldn’t have to commit any actual crimes, like extortion or assault. He didn’t feel indebted to her at all, but he also didn’t want her to get in trouble because of him. Especially because Castiel always seemed so unhinged in his displeasure.
And worse still, he had to go back tomorrow. He badly wanted to call his father and curse him out, but he knew John wouldn’t answer.
Parking back under the trees, he turned his car off and sat for a bit, looking. Listening to the rustle of the pines above him. He got out of the car, and walked deeper into the trees. The light was different in this valley, and it made him want to climb the nearest slope, until he could see the sun again. An irrational squeezing in his gut told him he wouldn’t.
“Shit.” Ash breathed, running a hand through his hair.
“Well,” Castiel replied, looking thoughtful, “I’ve had people punished for less.”
He trailed off, staring out the window into the dark of the parking lot, his face half in shadow. They were in a strange situation - had he not acted on instinct, he would probably still be at home, spending his nights taking orders and discussing the disappeared murderer. But he felt panic, desperation, when that thing - the ‘Crocotta’ - had pushed over people he knew. Castiel had never had much in common with the people he lived around, but that never meant they weren’t his people. Castiel had felt it within him, this urgency to get to the creature before it’s hideous teeth made a second appearance.
“Yes,” Dean replies, his throat dry. He holds up a lacy pair with a heart shaped cut out, “Whenever you want.”
Dean was escorted through the parking garage, past rows and rows of other shiny black cars of all different makes and models. This level of the garage alone probably had millions of dollars worth of assets in it. Whoever John had screwed over, they were incredibly rich. That made them dangerous. Dean would have to do what he could to keep them away from Sam.
“I mean..,” Dean was panting, “It’s frustrating, but yeah. It’s pretty sexy.”
Dean hesitated before approaching the table. He’d never been waxed before. Was she going to wax all of him, his chest, his legs? Or was this full brazillian territory? His cheeks burned as he imagined it. He’d been with girls before who were bare, and the soft smoothness had been nice against his own skin, his lips. He tried not to think about his new Boss’s mouth near his genitals as he climbed clumsily onto the table.
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said, fiddling with the waist of Dean’s jeans, like he couldn’t decide if he wanted to cop one last feel.
“A solid C+” Dean said, grinning over at him.
“I am chill man,” Dean said, “And I’m driving.”
April Bushel had given them a thermos and a loaf of warm bread before watching them walk out into her fields, guns slung over shoulders.
Hmm... The constant use of the word daddy is getting on my nerves so I might have to fix it. I thought it'd be sexy for Dean to be out of his mind horny for someone while not knowing their real name, but "Daddy" in every other sentence is getting to be A Lot™.
“Later,” Daddy replied, waving a hand dismissively, “I have to go back to work.”
“Bacon Cheese burger, extra fries.” Dean said with a grin.
“For you,” Dean replied, blushing at his own words, and then ever harder once Castiel kissed him, a chaste press of lips.
“The Chupacabra?” Dean said, his mouth full of cold egg and sausage, “Yeah, it was there. We’re going back tonight to nail the sucker.”
It didn’t take much research to find where the child was buried—Dean flashed his ID to a librarian with confidence and ease, and they got exactly what the were looking for. They were in and out in less than five minutes. All they had to do then was wait until dark to sneak among the dead under the cover of the night.
Dean felt as Daddy ran a finger through the puddle of come on his lower back, and it drove him crazy. He re-doubled his efforts, so close to the edge and getting closer as Daddy smeared come all over his lower back and his ass, pressing it into his skin as if to mark him.
His head was forced down again, while the Boss shoved his cock roughly into Dean’s mouth. It was definitely at half-mast now, Dean noticed, adjusting as much as he could without moving.
Dean let it all go, not caring when he felt spit sliding past his lips to slide, wet and nasty, down his Boss’ shaft. He rolled his eyes behind the god-awful mask when he was rewarded with a gentle head rub for his efforts, fingers combing through his hair for a moment before leaving again.
It smelled similar too, which was the most horrifying part.
Dean’s eyes snapped back down, focused on the man’s face. His fingers trembled a little as they pulled off his shirt, a plaid button up. He watched his boss watch him, dropping the shirt to the floor and grabbing the hem of his t-shirt.
“Have you done this before?” Dean asked, so quiet that Cas nearly didn’t hear him.
“A sexy time-out,” Dean offered, taking another sip of his ridiculously good mimosa.
“I’m your pretty boy, Cas,” He says, placing both hands on the back of Cas’s neck, wrapping his legs tighter around his waist, “I’m your favourite fuck toy, aren’t I?”
His boss stared at him, hard, his eyes glinting dangerously in the low light of the bedside lamp. It was a dramatic shift from the soft gaze of the night before.
“On your knees,” Dadd murmured, tapping Dean’s hip.
“There’s a wardrobe for you in his quarters with a powder room included, which will be fitted out with all your new items.” she tucked a piece of hair behind her ear and carried on, “We’ll put your skin care products in the adjoining bathroom, which will be just for you to use. He feels it’s important that his staff have a sense of personal space while at work, considering how demanding our jobs can sometimes be.”
Dean groans, his breath hot against Cas’s neck.
“Makes perfect sense.” Dean said, raising his eyebrows at Castiel who used a hand to hide his smile.
The moment was coming, Cas knew it, waiting as he felt the tension build, the only part of the room he was aware of was the foot of space between them.
“Come and sit down,” his Other Option said, gesturing to the huge sectional sofa in the split level living room behind him.
He settled next to Castiel, where he was promptly pulled close, tucked under a strong arm.
“Office is behind us,” Dean said, tension coursing through him.
“I want you to be my courtesan,” he said, calm as anything, as though those words didn’t bring Dean’s brain to a crashing halt.
“I don’t give a shit, kid. This is a courtesy call to let you know your ass is fired. Don’t come back here again,” Jerry replied, before promptly hanging up.
“What, like a knife through his neck?”
“Excellent,” Daddy said, shifting back to the ottoman across from him, “One last thing Dean, and then we can make this official.”
“Worth the wait?” Cas mumbles against his skin.
Suddenly he’s got Dean’s thighs on his shoulders, and he’s spreading Dean’s cheeks, kissing along the sensitive skin between them, across his dry hole. Dean squirms, having been wildly unprepared for this.
“Did you?”
“Get dressed,” he said, “I’ll see you at the office.”
Someone screamed.
“Okay,” Dean said, turning the phone over in his hands. It was a brand new model, the latest Samsung Galaxy S series, he wasn’t sure what number they were up to. It was a damn sight fancier than his second hand iPhone seven with a shattered back and a large crack running up the front. “Thanks,” he said again.
“Thank you, Hannah,” came a deep voice, and straight away Dean turned to find it’s owner.
“You’re a dick,” Dean says, but he’s pleased all the same. They’ll be nice to have inside him on a lazy sunday at home.
“I feel bad telling you this stuff, man,” He’d said at one point, “It changes lives, and never for the better.”
“Sure, but usually they’re self employed and can set their own rates. You’re paying back a debt, and therefore work at the rate that I set for you.”
“Good morning, Sir,” he greeted, moving to pour their boss a tall glass of ice water, “What can I get for you?”
“Oh no you don’t, you bastard.” Dean said to himself.
“Hmm,” he heard from behind him, “These were a safe choice. Pretty, obviously. But safe all the same.” The waistband of his panties was pulled on and then snapped back against his skin, emphasising the point.
“Perfectly fine. Once the laminate cools it will be pretty hard to tell just by lookin’ that this ain’t the real deal.”
“We do have openings, if you’d like to work off your debt,” Hannah said, ignoring his remark, “If you were to start with us immediately, you’d be put into Debt Collection.”
It wasn’t awful, Dean thought. The clippers pulled at a pubic hair every now and then, and the quick, sharp pain was enough to stop him from getting hard as Helen gently moved his dick out of the way of wherever she was trimming.
Hannah indicated a door to his left, which blended in with the wall so well he hadn’t noticed it either of the times he’d previously been in the office apartment. He turned the handle gently and pushed, the door swinging silently inwards as he did so.
Dean was panting open-mouthed into the crook of his elbow, eyes screwed shut in concentration as he moved, pre-come smearing over the couch as it dripped through the lace, the fabric rubbing against his slit, clinging tight to the sensitive skin at the tip, and pulling tight across his balls. It felt incredible. Daddy must have been getting similar stimulation from the strap of the thong between his cheeks, because he kept slowly dragging his cock along it, and pausing to rub his cockhead against the piece of lace at the back, making it damp and itchy against Dean’s skin. Dean felt like he was on fire, like his skin was too tight for his body, like he was about to explode.
Dean couldn’t keep his promise with Leona, and Leona is far from happy with that turnout. Despite his promise, Dean still always checks the time on his watch and his phone while they are spending time together at her place. To make things worse, Dean doesn’t seem to be paying much attention to Leona after he spent an hour with her. He always appears to be all fidgety and nervous most of the time he is with her. Leona senses something fishy going on with her man.
Dean flashes a big, warm smile back at her as the door shuts. Instantly a deep sigh escapes his lips, feeling drained by the conversation he just had with his woman. “Damn,” he says, “I’m so damn exhausted right now.”
“I dunno? You’re lookin’ at a kid chasin’ his father with a cheesy smile. Don’t lie and say ya ain’t feelin’ that way.”
She squeezes Dean’s hands in hers tightly. “I think you need to acknowledge these feelings ya have for him before
Castiel casually looks over his shoulder at the TV before frowning deeply. "Dean. You've watched this for hundreds times," he miserably says with a straight face, which Dean quickly defends himself "What? It's a good episode!" before turning off Netflix begrudgingly.
lumberjack look. The food, the people, the surroundings - those are the things that Dean still has to learn a lot. Castiel notices that he grumbles almost every second of the day, yet he still tries his best to assimilate with the locals. Castiel gives him credits for that.

Castiel notices that Dean isn't responding to him although he
much.”
Dean lets out a loud sigh. He groans deeply and begins to climb out of his bed to wake Castiel up. If he has to wake up this early in the morning, might as well spend his time with Castiel together. He drags his feet one foot after the other as he makes his way to Castiel's room. He gives a gentle knock on the door.
“Then what about making ME happy, Dean? Is my happiness doesn’t count to you?” Leona pleads with her eyes. Dean feels trapped.
Castiel emerges from behind the door. His face is frowning, as per usual. “Why didn’t you lock the door?”
“Ya workin’?” Dean skillfully avoids himself from bumping into another man on the sidewalk before he decides to stand still against the glass window of a shop. He can’t be talking and walking on this crowded street at the same time.
"So… it means that you don't have to drive around town just to pick me up when we can just meet here."
and Castiel are stuck together for the rest of the day within the confinement of the apartment without Dean having to go out to meet anyone else
The ambiance in the restaurant is lively with friends and coworkers chatting with each other while they are enjoying good lunch. Dean is relieved to spot a few couples having lunch earlier while he and Castiel were making their way to their table. Don't get him wrong. Dean feels a lot more confident seeing that not only those who are on a date are eating lunch there; since despite Dean wanted to have a proper lunch date with Castiel, he doesn't think he is ready to actually
Castiel is doing all of those things only because he wants Dean to stop worrying about what others think of him if they knew he is dating his own best buddy, or at least Castiel wants Dean to adapt to their new situation (or better known as them dating). Despite both Dean and Castiel frequently having lunch dates together, Castiel notices that Dean is still acting like his old self.
Castiel frowns deeply. "I'm not treatin' you like you're
“Of course I do. She said I can call her whenever I need help.”
, Dean curses himself in his heart. Dean can feel his hands on the wheel are getting sweatier by the minute. He tries to calm his racing heart in order not to show obvious reactions to Castiel.
"If there's something wrong, Dean, you need to tell me. If I did wrong to you, I'm sorry. But I do need to know why are you not talking to me much today?" Castiel begins to plead. Then, he starts to see Dean getting agitated. Dean's face has turned sour rapidly. Castiel predicts that Dean is going to blow up at anytime now.
and spend some time together under the sun."
Dean's patience has reached its limit with Castiel's nonchalant laughter. He turns the steering wheel and stops the car at the shoulder of the road. Castiel is genuinely surprised by this turn of event as he ceases from laughing.
Castiel continues to chuckle under his breath without breaking his smile. He casually stares back at Dean and says, "You."
He doesn't even know that Castiel owns an alarm clock. At this moment, Dean realizes something …
?!" Out of anger, he throws his phone away, but misses the couch, sees his phone flying into the wall before it shatters into pieces.
!" Dean defensively barks at Castiel.
"I can't help myself, Dean… Not around you …," says Castiel, then he looks away, feeling bashful for what he has to confess. "I - I - I was just finding excuses to be around you. Even if I need to carry your dirty shoes or flip-flops while we take a walk, I really don't mind."
And during those long, lonely three hours, Dean has made many attempts to distract himself from thinking too much about Castiel's sudden outing. He has done all of the things he could think of: exercising, taking a shower, making breakfast for himself, cleaning both his room and the kitchen while listening to Taylor Swift, washing Baby, and doing laundry. Now, he's watching Netflix in the living room as required of his to-do list, but Dean is blankly watching the TV screen. His eyes keep on stealing quick glances at his phone to see if there are any new messages from the angel, but all he gets is a sprain in his eyes.
“The coffee lady at the coffee shop downstairs?”
Dean shoots Cas a dirty look. “I just got home, Cas. I forgot to lock the door.”
“IT AIN’T LOCKED, CAS,” Dean says loudly from where he’s seating.
Castiel frowns deeply. "What? No, Dean. I wasn't sighing because of what you just told me."
Dean listens attentively to his girl’s words.
. There’s no other way I can explain why I love you. I guess that’s why we share a more profound bond together.”
Castiel looks cheekily at Dean as he snickers before heading out of Dean's room, leaving Dean stunned on his bed alone. It takes Dean a good 15 seconds for him to snap back to reality, but it is too late for him to feel the anger towards Castiel after making him flustered to oblivion.
"I've asked the village. They said he's just a wild dog." Castiel automatically kneels onto the sand to allow the handsome dog kiss him all over his face, much to Dean's surprise. Castiel happily indulges to the dog's demands and lets the Husky jump onto him. Castiel laughs whole-heartedly as the kisses turn ticklish. He looks up and smiles brightly at the barista. "Thanks, Susie, for taking care of Huskey," says Castiel.
anything but staring at him.
. "Oh …" Dean unintentionally squeaks.
The song becomes louder once he is in the room. Dean begins searching for the source of the sound, which leads him to Castiel's alarm clock. This is the very first time Dean has heard a song played on the alarm clock. Dean stares at the digital alarm clock long and hard while The Beatles continues to serenade the British beat song that echoes slightly across the room.
“Yeah. I’m walking Sebastian’s dog. Why?”
over-the-top for him.
Castiel looks at Dean with gentle eyes. “I maybe gonna go travel around the world when that happens. And maybe settle down in Los Angeles.”
Castiel catches a hint of self-defense in Dean's tone. If he knows any better, this is the very tone that tells him to back off and stop arguing with Dean. And this indirectly just helps proven Castiel's own theory: Dean is bringing him over to a nice restaurant for an actual date. Castiel shakes his head and chuckles softly. Castiel finds this too adorable to just give up midway.
Castiel looks in the same direction and nods. "Yeah. With our dog," Castiel coolly reveals his surprise to Dean, and Dean's reaction is sure what he has expected all along.
, says Castiel in his mind.
Castiel, as a gentleman as he is, immediately gets up off his seat just to show her a good manner. He doesn’t want to embarrass Dean in any ways possible. He can’t stand the critics he might have to hear back in their apartment later on if he messed up this first meeting.
instantly."
funny."
Castiel stares at Dean confusedly. “Do… I have to love a man right now?”
?" Castiel keeps looking at Dean as Dean drives.
“You smile a lot. You laugh a lot. You seem very much happier with him than when you’re with me - and I don’t hate you for that. I only need to know now if you love him more than you love me. ‘Cause I don’t wanna be stuck in the middle of your confused feelings for him.”
Castiel frowns his eyebrows. “She is
"Yeah …" Dean answers slowly while rubbing the back of his neck. "It was about what she said to me that got me a lil'... weirded out right now." Dean continues explaining when he saw Castiel's scrunched up face, "We didn't break up because of somethin' Leona and I

No answer from Castiel.
Although his patience to listen to Castiel's
'showing my love to the man I love'." Dean is quick to roll his eyes, which Castiel instantly grabs Dean's hand, letting his own flip-flops to fall onto the sand. "Hear me out, Dean."
Dean isn't saying anything back in response, leading to Castiel feeling more anxious about the
“Settlin’ down, huh? Now
these days? What sorta bull crap are you sayin', Dean?"
Castiel is clearly taken aback by the sudden hostility from Dean, however mild it was. He bites his lips and then gets up off his seat. "I think I better let you be alone. I'll walk back home," he mumbles softly.
in love with one right now, if you ask me,” Castiel confesses.
Dean has received Castiel's reply.
In an instant, Castiel starts laughing. He shakes his head in disbelief, and then, he answers, "That's not
“Whatever, man.” Dean mindlessly watching the scenery before them. “Ya tried yer best…” he mutters under his breath.
really like Bert and Ernie.”
It is 10AM and Dean hasn't seen Castiel yet for the day, but he is feeling nervous for unknown reasons. He keeps checking on Castiel's bedroom door in case that Castiel suddenly decided to come out and surprised him. Dean doesn't think that his racing heart can take the surprise well today.
"Ya almost
"I mean… you're not talking much. You don't even look at me when you talk. You brushed off my hand when I wanted to pat your back. You're practically avoiding me right now."
Dean’s eyebrows furrow at Castiel’s words. “Ya what now?”
Castiel remains silent for awhile. His eyes are following a father carrying his four-year-old son to the shore. Castiel smiles. “I am enjoying myself here.” He nods.
Dean is puzzled. He feels a light dizziness in his head while his heart is pumping fast like a bullet train. Leona notices his body language. She kindly rubs Dean’s arm up and down to calm him down.
Castiel glances at Dean once Dean looks away. That bright smile is still on his face. It reminds Castiel those days when Dean and Sam, if not him included, saved the days from the supernatural attacks. Especially those rare days when Dean can have a way with the cases only because they strike his interest the best. Castiel beams softly as he continues to gaze at Dean. Castiel has always enjoyed watching Dean quietly, even when Dean is sleeping.
"WAIT -" Dean cuts into the short, friendly conversation, causing both Castiel and Susie to turn and stare at Dean. "Did ya just named the dog 'Husky'?"
, he says in his heart as he makes his way to the Chevy Impala, shaking his head in amusement.
Dean smiles victoriously after hearing Castiel’s defeating answer. He can’t help but chuckles a little as he continues walking back home to their apartment.
“Leona …” he sighs. “I will try to spend time with ya more, alright? I’m sorry.” He leans over towards Leona and pecks her lips softly, trying to reassure her yet again. Leona is on the fence with Dean’s words - she’s not sure if she can rely on his promise in this case. But she eventually cracks a smile on her face and nods understandingly.
excuses, Dean still opens his ears to what Castiel has to say. "Alright. I'm listenin'. Shoot!"
Castiel looks up from unpacking his trench coat and a few of his worn white shirts from his duffle bag. He stares at Dean without batting his eyes while he waits for the rest of the sentence from Dean.
Castiel moves in much closer until they share the same breath. Dean's face is getting redder and redder by the second, and the bright sun isn't helping to reduce the blush. Their eyes are locked onto each other that makes Dean forget how to breathe for a moment.
"Dean! You alright? Did something happened?" asks Castiel in one breath as he hastily runs towards Dean. A hint of worry can be heard visibly in his voice.
“Tell Brian I’ve paid for these,” says Dean as he opens the store entrance with his large body after he twirled around by the door, showing a big grin on his face to Maria, his co-worker who is now standing by the counter. “I’m out!” Maria chuckles and cries, “Okay!” before the door closes behind Dean.
He tries to come up with a few viable options, but none seem to be an out-of-the-ordinary place for them to eat; not somewhere that they don't normally go. Pizzas, burgers, pastas - they had them too much to last a lifetime, not that Dean is grumbling about it. But today, he wants it a little different. Just to show his appreciation towards his best buddy. His loyal friend. His guardian angel.
what I always wear, Dean.”
"Sure! I'll go and take a shower first." Dean literally jumps up off the couch and onto his feet before he scurries away into his own bedroom without looking at Castiel even once, leaving Castiel alone in the living room, still half naked in his towel.
wanting to cherish the memory we had together."
Dean stares in silence. “LA? Why LA?”
He has never seen Dean acting all lovable like this ever since he's known Dean. Hell. He's never seen Dean acting this way with Sam or even with Mary. And this new side of Dean is stirring all kinds of reactions in Castiel's brain and heart. He can feel his heart beating so fast that it's almost telling him to cut it out and let it free.
Dean feels awkward.
Dean leans into his arms planted into the sand behind him. “I knew you’d be here. Havin’ fun there, buddy?”
whenever he’s ‘round.”
Castiel helps Dean sit down and takes a seat next to him. His hand gently takes Dean's and gives it a firm grip. He gives Dean a warm and assuring smile. Dean is feeling secured thanks to the little things Castiel is doing to him, but only to realize later that Castiel isn't
Castiel shrugs nonchalantly. “City of Angels perhaps?”
"I found him when I was walkin' around Black Beach Vik. He just came to me and we connected
“Dammit. Leona! Babe! Hold on!” he cries after her. Dean starts running towards her until he finally catches up with her. He grabs her by her arm and turns her around to face him. “Babe. Hold on a sec here. What’s the rush?”
Dean hastily tries to remember the very memory Castiel is talking about, and the memory lane eventually leads him to the scene of their very first time working together as hunters.
"Cas. You're up?" asks Dean.
. You look serious with Leona. I can see that myself.”
“When are ya gonna be home?”
No sound coming from Castiel's room.
Dean looks up and sees Castiel poking his head around the bedroom door. Dean bops his head and asks, "What's up?"
Dean quickly reacts with a frown. “Why
between us?"
Dean checks his phone for the nth time - the clock says it's already 12.35 PM. Not long after Dean barged into Castiel's empty room, he found Castiel's message on the coffee table in the living room, saying, "Going out". It has been three hours since then.
listenin’ to me right now?” says Leona loudly, causing a few heads in the restaurant to turn and gawk at them both.
Dean stops right before Castiel, facing the angel directly, looking unamused. Castiel hastily halts himself before knocking into Dean.
"Ya always wanna help me with the
Suddenly Castiel's hand extends out for Dean's shoulder as he gives it a pat. "Super duper!" And in an instant, Dean loses control of the steering wheel, making his Baby to swerve slightly on the road.
“Maybe in an hour or so? I’m gonna grab a few buns at the bakery. You want anything, Dean?”
Castiel takes this opportunity to bring his body and face closer to Dean's. Then, he smiles warmly. "It means… that I know that you're a nervous wreck when I'm around. I know you are affected by what I'm doing to you. And… I ain't stopping, Dean. Despite popular's belief, you
Castiel worriedly sits next to Dean. He’s speechless on what to say to Dean that would be appropriate to Dean’s current condition. He can only silently gazes at Dean while his heart is troubled greatly.
“Ya hate this place? Is that what ya tryin’ to say?”
, he reminds himself. He takes out his phone from his jeans’ pocket and instantly pushes the call button on “Cass”. The phone rings a few times before there’s a click sound at the end of the line.
"What? I didn't do anything, Dean. You're just exaggerating right now."
Castiel has made it his habit of carelessly touching Dean here and there, every now and then. He would put his arm around Dean's waist if they were standing side by side while Dean was reading the menu on the menu board. He would also then cheekily pull his hand away from Dean's waist, running his fingers lightly across Dean's back, causing Dean's hair on the neck to stand up abruptly.
He stares hard at the blue tie as his fingers mindlessly twirl it around them. Dean looks somewhat rattled and upset at the necktie. He furiously clicks his tongue and looks away from Castiel's tie, scowling off into space, getting deeper into his unsettling feelings.
Unfortunately, Castiel doesn’t buy that. “You hate California.”
Leona glares softly at him before she begins to speak. “What happened, Dean? Why suddenly you’ve changed?”
Cas? More than just yer buddy?”
"DEAN!"
He exclaims in his heart.
gay, but… we can’t control our feelings when it comes to love,” she says.
"What?" Dean averts his eyes from the phone screen to look back at Maria. Maria playfully cocks her eyebrows and scoffs. "Are you goin' on a date right now?" she asks cheekily . Dean only gives her a sheepish smile before proceeding to help his previous customer who is by now done choosing her flowers.
And to Dean's disbelief, he is feeling convinced by the touch of Castiel on his face. In a weird way, he doesn't feel attacked by Castiel's advance this time. He is feeling comforted by it instead. Dean is becoming
"Ya even made me drop my ice cream," Dean grumbles once he sees the state of his ice cream (or what's left) on the ground.
Dean and Castiel enter the crowded pizza place across their apartment where they’ll be meeting Dean’s new girl sooner or later. It is Friday night. The high time for young adults to meet up and catch up with their friends. Thus, making the duo the only scruffy male adults in the joint, excluding a group of men in their 50s who are having their
After listening to every word Castiel has said, Dean takes a deep breath and exhales soundly. Castiel's confession has somewhat done its
Dean stares at Castiel with suspicion. "What if I say I just wanna
“Leona!” Dean calls out a name, causing Castiel to snap back into reality. He turns around to see a beautiful young black lady, in her casual wear which makes her looks effortlessly beautiful, walking towards him and Dean.
"THAT! I've told ya about -" Dean hesitates, "-
Dean’s eyes flutter open and he blankly looks at the white ceiling of their apartment. He stays quiet for quite some time.
And it’s been awhile since Castiel last saw Dean.
knows.
I'm sorry for not tellin' ya where I was goin' yesterday. Once I woke up, I suddenly had the urge to be somewhere cold," Castiel begins to clarify while walking leisurely next to Dean.
“Man… Ya really look awesome now,” he gives Castiel a sincere compliment.
"Assbutt?"
Dean flops his whole body onto the leather couch. He sighs loudly with his eyes closed after he rested his head on the backrest. He’s feeling sluggish tonight for unknown reason.
Castiel smiles warmly and nods his head lightly. “Nice to meet you, Leona.”
He smiles sheepishly at the guests at the neighboring tables as he gets up from his seat. “Enjoy ya dinner, folks,” says Dean embarrassingly. He hurries to the cashier to pay up for their meals and walks out of the restaurant, trying to look for Leona. His eyes immediately spot Leona walking aggressively not too far from where he stands now.
only Castiel, and no one Dean loves more than his guardian angel before him.
"Dammit, Cas! What d'ya want me to say here, huh?!" Dean asks with a tone of annoyance in his voice.
"Are we good now, Dean?" Castiel squeezes Dean's hand in his, and Dean continues to smile and nod.
Castiel bought a latte from the coffee shop downstairs as he had decided to head to the beach instead. The lovely barista has already recognized Castiel, and even memorized his coffee order. Castiel likes how friendly the barista can be, since she keeps on leaving affectionate messages on his coffee cup, if not a phone number which she stated “
Without another thought, Dean drops everything in his hands and desperately grabs Castiel's head, hungrily kissing Castiel on the lips. Castiel obediently follows Dean's flow and drops everything he's holding too to cup Dean's face in his hands. At this moment, the time seems to stop just to allow them to be lost in each other's embrace while pouring their overflowing feelings for each other through the touch of their lips. And slowly, they pull away from the kiss.
"Just…" Castiel contemplates, then smiles warmly. "Let's just say I wanna make it up to you for what happened yesterday. AND- maybe get your phone repaired or something. Anything that you wanna do."
"What's wrong with wantin' to help ya with that?" Castiel earnestly asks.
the one that makes him all tense all day long. If he tells Castiel that, what would that make him? What would become of him? And most importantly, what would Castiel do about that information? Even without knowing the truth, Castiel is already bold with his advances. Dean fears what would come next if

“Beef pepperoni, please,” Castiel politely answers, with his body leans forward slightly.

Castiel chimes in in his defense, "- I gave you this -"
The pancake house is buzzing with people chatting left and right, and yet Castiel can only hear the deafening stillness between him and Dean. And Dean isn't even making any eye contacts with him. Nothing like the usual.
“In case you have forgotten, I’ve kinda single-handedly ruined Jimmy Novak’s life and family. You think I can have a family of my own after
Now it’s Dean’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “Who knows, man? Who knows…”
The barista who's visibly still finds Castiel adorable smiles shyly. "... Not a problem, Cas."
There's a shock of horror displayed on Dean's face upon hearing Castiel's words. "Whaddya…"
good day today. All he can do now is close his eyes in despair, not knowing what to feel and how to feel.
Castiel’s eyes shoot wide open. “Love a man? What do you mean?”
“So, Cas…”
“You’re hopeless, man.”
him in a way.
“I mean actually lovin’ a man -
Castiel immediately clears his throat to cover his elation and smiles warmly at Dean. His eyes silently wander across Dean's face, seeing every feature that elevates Dean's beauty and masculinity simultaneously in the most wondrous ways. Since Castiel is not just a common angel, he sees Dean's elegance in a more meticulous way. In his eyes, Dean glows like a sun, with his freckles mark his face like a constellation in the night sky. Castiel has never told Dean this, but in his eyes, Dean is the most beautiful creature ever created by God; and this is coming from a Seraph who was once an occupant of Heaven. That is the reason why Castiel doesn't mind watching Dean to sleep after all these years. He regards Dean as his own Crux. His
"Cas?" he calls as he goes to the bathroom to check on Castiel, "Are ya in the shower?" But there is no Castiel in the shower. And the floor and the sink aren't wet. These confuse Dean even more.
clearly staring at him at the moment. "Dean?" asks Castiel curiously before he slowly approaches Dean on the couch. "You alright, Dean?"
"I know, I know. I have some explainin' to do." Castiel lightly laughs as they continue their walk on the beach. Dean has learned his lesson and let Castiel happily carry his beach sandals instead.
The last argument Dean and Castiel had over the idea of Castiel leaving him for LA once he’s hitched got Dean all wary and cautious around Castiel. It has been two weeks since that argument happened, and Dean is no longer away from their apartment for more than a day. Dean would always come back home before the day ends, even if he was spending his time with his girlfriend. He tries to keep Castiel company and entertained despite his busy schedule.
“Wow… Thanks, Dean. I love calla lilies,” Castiel responds gratefully while taking a whiff of the beautiful flowers. “Oh! I got you apple pies from the bakery.”
ya be here?”
“That’d be too fast, don’t ya think? What if she’s not the one for me? It’d be hell to move out,” he calmly answers, despite Castiel can almost sense the nervousness that is visible on Dean’s face.
Dean slowly tries to unlock the door lock. His hand keeps on slipping from getting the key into the keyhole properly, causing a scratching noise to resonate throughout the empty corridor. Dean doesn’t realize that. He is completely blank in his head.
"What do you me -"
still remember that I own a car, right?"
I'd buy that bullshit?" asks Dean, feeling more annoyed by the second.
Castiel smiles softly with a soft gaze. “I can see that you
, Dean. Did you think I don't know about your feelings? I KNOW ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS FOR ME, DEAN. I know ALL about it for years now," Castiel replies sharply, blocking any other retaliation from Dean who is visibly ignorant about his own feelings.
Dean finally realizes that he can no longer win this argument against an angel that has remembered all his quotes by heart. “Shut up,” he protests.
Dean is baffled by the unexpected twist. "You what?"
"FUCK YOU, CAS! YOU CAN'T EVEN PICK UP YOUR PHONE
"If you're okay to go out." Castiel nods his head gently. "But we don't have to if you don't feel like it." Castiel keeps on nodding.
He gets up off the couch, curses "Damn you, Cas!" to Cas telepathically, then aggressively tries to call Castiel again on his phone (the screen shows 22 outgoing calls for 'Cass'). Dean struggles to stay calm while he waits patiently (begrudgingly) for the "dickbag" angel to pick up the phone since he believes the ringback tone is
“Your friend is cute. He got a number?” asks the young waitress to Dean.
supposed to mean, Dean. I’m not giving you double meanings here, if you must know.”
Dean’s hand reaches out to the car keys. He turns around to look for Castiel. “Cas! Let’s go now!”
Castiel decided that he will go out this afternoon. He turns off the TV, gets up off the leather couch, heads back to his room to grab his wallet, then he walks out of the door, locking the door behind him, with the keys and his phone in his hand. Castiel continues walking to the elevator.
Castiel glances over at Dean who remains silent as they drive to the nearest The Original Pancake House. Castiel tries to remember everything that has happened for the past week, trying to figure out why Dean is behaving like this today towards him. Since they briefly talked in the living room after Castiel got out of the shower, Dean hardly looks at him. His eyes are always shifty whenever Castiel talks to him. He dodges Castiel's hand contacts whenever he senses Castiel was about to touch him, even on the shoulder. Castiel tries to recall anything that may have caused the rift between him and Dean, but nothing comes to mind at all. Castiel is terribly puzzled by this riddle.
from now on, Dean?" he asks. Dean shrugs nonchalantly and begins to drive off his Baby to their designated location for today's lunch.
Dean takes a quick look at Castiel and smiles back at their waitress. “Thanks. Ya might wanna ask him yourself for his number.”
Dean’s lips quiver as he’s trying to say something, yet somehow it becomes inaudible due to his anxiety.
Suddenly Dean hears his name being called almost desperately. Dean glances at the door just to see a panic-stricken-looking Castiel by the door.
"Dean …" Castiel breaks the silence. Dean turns his head to look at Castiel.
Dean becomes speechless as he’s being questioned by Leona. He doesn’t know what to say to her that wouldn’t come off like he’s clinging onto Castiel from leaving him alone. His brain tries to come up with a reasonable answer that can bury Leona’s suspicion while at the same time protecting his image.
Castiel looks down to take a look of his new look, which he only manages to see what he normally sees. “Thanks?”
Castiel slowly looks away from Dean to watch the wave crashing into the sand again. They both sit there silently.'
Dean frowns. “Me?” He unlocks the door and lets Leona enter first before him. He closes the door behind them and follows Leona to the living room where she has seated herself on the leather couch, staring at Dean in an unamused manner. “What about me?” he continues to ask as he sits down next to her.
"Ya don't think
"You think I don't know what's going on in your head?"
dog? Whaddya mean?"
Castiel frowns. “What makes you think that?”
Castiel ponders for a second. “I don’t think I ever have. Why?”
“DEAN! Are ya
Dean asks himself the same question.
Then, the door makes a noise from the other side, and there he stands once the door is opened. “Dean?” he asks Dean worryingly. “You okay?”
Dean has lost his will.
Dean wonders to himself. He turns off the alarm immediately, leaving the room as quiet as it was before. Dean is about to leave the room when he suddenly realizes something.
missing our hunting days. That's
Dean stares blankly at Maria before he grumbles under his breath with fisted hands on the counter. "Dammit."
Dean is silent. Only his eyes are asking a million questions at Castiel at the same time.
Dean checks his phone to look at the time. It is almost his lunch break. It means that Dean has to get on the road if he wants to pick up Castiel at the cafe in time. Yet, Dean keeps staring at the digital clock as a minute passed by.
Dean lazily shrugs while looking away. "What's that gotta do with ya?"
Castiel snorts, taking his place in the passenger seat and stares back at Dean. "Are you seriously gonna call me
Upon hearing that, he quickly takes out his phone and starts typing the name of the restaurant while Maria is watching him with a pair of eagle eyes.
Dean closes the door behind him and takes a seat on Castiel's untouched bed. His eyes begin scanning the whole room. As expected, Castiel doesn't really
coffee lady who likes ya?”
"GET - OUT - OF - MY - HEAD, ASSHOLE."
Castiel chuckles at the adorableness Dean is visibly showing to him. Castiel loves the fact that Dean is embracing his feelings for him more freely, without judging himself for loving a man, yet alone his own best friend. A smile is plastered across Castiel's face. He immediately texts Dean back to answer his invitation. Then, he puts away his phone back into the pocket to resume his work.
"I'll always be true,
? Are ya down for that?"
"YA SURELY GOT THE GUTS TEXTIN' SOMEONE AT THIS MOMENT," Dean says smiling with gritted teeth.
Castiel is waiting right outside the coffee shop patiently as requested by Dean himself earlier.
for years by now. But he can't tell Castiel that
Dean gently stands on his own two feet and Castiel slowly lets him go. "Thanks," Dean says softly but loud enough for Castiel to catch. Castiel smiles warmly. "Feeling better now, Dean?" Castiel asks to ensure Dean is absolutely fine. Dean turns around and smiles weakly at Castiel. Castiel takes it as "yes".
It's a text message from Dean.
Castiel is sitting comfortably in the sand on the beach, overlooking the serene sea where locals are swimming and having fun with their families and friends, when suddenly he feels
Dean’s face changes rapidly. He scrunches up his whole face at this sudden accusation. “What? Whaddya mean by that? Of course I like him. He’s ma buddy.”
for you.”
doing
“Let’s grab that table.” Dean points at an empty table not too far from the kitchen’s entrance. They both make their way to the table and settle down comfortably despite the atmosphere in the pizza place is loud and vibrant with chatters and laughter.
And as expected, Dean easily takes the bait. But what Castiel has failed to calculate when he made the move is what he was about to see.
"Cold? Where?" asks Dean as he turns to look at Castiel.
, Cas. Trust me.” He rubs Castiel’s back to calm his innocent friend down. “Anyway, I still don’t appreciate yer idea of movin’ away once I settled down. Why can’t ya just stay here with me?”
"Is there something
A waitress comes by their table with a warm smile. Dean replies a smile back to her, then he places their orders. The young lady jolts down everything expertly while at the same time giving Castiel a flirtatious look. Castiel is - as always - oblivious of the opposite gender’s advancement, but Dean is taking pride in what is unfolding in front of him.
Dean frowns before he glances over at what Castiel is watching, and that causes him to frown even further. “What? Ya want a family now, Cas?”
"So please, love me do -"
Dean rubs his nape idly. "Cas… There's nothin' wrong goin' on between us, alright? Ya just bein' paranoid there," he says while flashing that goofy smile of his to Castiel. Again, Castiel doesn't buy into his act that easily.
for ya… more than I had for her…"
Castiel nods and smiles warmly.
Dean sees his own mixtape that he remembers giving to Castiel once as a gift on the nightstand, along with a fake FBI batch, and Castiel's favorite blue necktie. Dean frowns slightly at his finding and slowly grabs the blue tie.
"Lunch?" Maria is bewildered by Dean's question since he never has asked her for any recommendations since day one he worked here. "At the burger joint down the street?"
"... sure?" Maria hesitantly agrees.
Dean has become a little impatient as he stands leaning against the door from, looking annoyed. "Cas. Ya deaf now? Can't ya say somethin'?"
Dean chuckles and shakes his head. "Cas. Ya can stop starin' and start talkin'." That shakes Castiel back to reality, which causes him to blush slightly and lightly laughs. "Sorry," he says, "What d'ya wanna know?"
Castiel snickers teasingly. "Ya seriously don't remember?" He tauntingly cocks his eyebrows.
Dean stops - Castiel quickly follows suit. The confused face Dean is making is enough to make Castiel burst out laughing, but Castiel knows that would be the death of him if he does so. Castiel tactfully remains quiet while looking away.
Castiel slowly reads the menu. His eyes are scanning the menu up and down, but his thoughts are all about the
to the poor heart.
“Ya know that ya don’t need to stay here, right? I ain’t forcin’ ya,” Dean tries to convince Castiel.
"We're here!" Dean says chirpily, causing Castiel to furrow his eyebrows even more deeply.
is too much for him to handle, period.
Castiel is not in his room, nor is he on his bed. Dean notices how well made the bed is, as if nobody has slept on it last night. Dean is confused.
"I think you better sit down, Dean. I'll explain everything."
"I'm actually laughing at you, Dean. You
Dean quickly cuts in once his emotions are getting too overwhelmed as he remembers everything that has happened today. "Why d'ya care? You were gone since this mornin'. Not tellin' where you'd been. No phone calls. No texts -"
Dean has made his own resolution of not trying to push back any of his or Castiel's feelings because of his previous uptight attitude towards Castiel's advances. He has pledged that he would give Castiel some space to express his feelings for Dean, and he would brave through it no matter how uncomfortable it may be. And Dean
Castiel squints his eyes in confusion. "I didn't grope you."
“You okay, Dean? You don’t look okay right now,” he comments.
Castiel frowns. “She likes me?” Castiel tilts his head sideways. “What kind of... like?”
It is finally the weekend. Dean is at home. He doesn't have shifts on Saturdays. And he's alone with Castiel in the apartment. Without a girlfriend. Alone with Castiel.
idea SOLELY. Blame yourself for it."
Castiel carefully walks on the pavement, trying to avoid the cyclists if not just another pedestrian. He is quick to say “Sorry” whenever he bumps into someone else on the sidewalk. Some may politely reply back to him, some may just smile, while others just move on as if nothing happened. Castiel doesn’t mind that at all.
… havin'
Castiel rolls his eyes and starts to quote Dean, word by word, “
than Castiel.
Dean throws away his remote and sighs deeply. "Whaddya want, Cas?" he asks gently despite his prior attitude. Castiel smiles brightly. "It's Sunday. What about if we go out? To the beach maybe?" says Castiel chirpily.
Dean frowns deeply - certainly not amused by Castiel's nonchalant answer when their foods have arrived at their table. Dean gives Castiel another stinky look before he mutters "Bitch" and begins to devour his burger.
The duo has finally reached the beach after taking a few detours (Dean sent his phone to be fixed, they had brunch together, and bought ice cream cones to enjoy at the beach). Both Dean and Castiel have taken off their flip-flops to let their feet be buried under the white sands as they trod together on the sandy beach.
She glares sharply at Dean, and Dean understands the hostility that is coming from her. He holds both her arms in his hands gently yet securely before he sighs deeply. “I’m sorry, babe. I’m really sorry for ma behavior tonight. I shouldn’t be playin’ with ma phone while we’re havin’ dinner together. Ma bad, and I admit it,” Dean apologizes earnestly to her.
Dean doesn't answer until a good minute passed by. "Korean? Maybe."
Dean listens carefully while his mind tries to learn every word that is spoken by Castiel. The room goes quiet again.
“Hello, Dean. What can I do for you?”
"WHAT THE HECK IS
"Such as?"
"You alright? You hungry?" Castiel continues asking Dean to ensure his friend is okay. "Should I just cook breakfast for us?"
"Ain't that… Susie from the coffee shop?" asks Dean while pointing at the young lady.
"Ya really should just mind yer own business, Cas."
"- I'M NOT! I'm just sayin'... that I am not treating you like someone helpless. Can't you see?" Castiel pulls Dean even closer towards him until their noses almost touch. Castiel is beaming with overflowing affection. "I'm the one who is helpless here ...
"Whatcha laughin' at, ya son of a bitch? Ya find this funny?" Dean's voice has turned into a threatening tone. However, Castiel doesn't seem to be affected much by it.
"What are you trying to hide, Dean? Who are you trying to kid here?" Castiel cocks his eyebrows once Dean is turning his head around to face Castiel.
Dean is gone by the next minute.
know that it's ten minutes from here, right? Why do you wanna go there?" asks Maria curiously as she continues to stare at Dean who seems to forget that she exists in his space.
Castiel brings his hand to cup Dean's face gently, and he smiles reassuringly at Dean. "And.. I'm not gonna do anything that you don't like, Dean. You can rest assured about that. I'll let you adapt to all of these slowly - at your own pace."
Castiel can't help himself but rolls his eyes exasperatedly.
"ICELAND? WHY?"
Dean glares softly at Castiel. "So?"
” she air-quotes the word “buddy” with an overflowing attitude, “- to pay attention to me, then I just wanna go home now.” She throws the napkin into her plate of untouched food and quickly walks off from their table, leaving Dean confused momentarily before he slowly begins to understand the whole situation.
Dean is now confused. "Ya what now?"
“Sounds awesome. I’ll see ya at home.” Dean is about to hang up before he remembers something. “And DON’T LET THAT DOG STEER YA AWAY FROM YA PATH! We both know how that ended the other day.”
But Dean is still feeling overwhelmed with his own feelings that he can't stop himself from saying "I love you too, Cas… Yer precious to me too …" Castiel smiles as he feels the strong grip of Dean's on his hand when suddenly he's being pushed away forcefully.
Castiel snickers silently and gets up off the sand to stand next to Dean. He smiles at Susie. Susie immediately smiles back gleefully. "I know you've met Dean before, but let me introduce him officially."
“So, what do ya wanna eat, buddy? Beef pepperoni? Cheese? Vegetarian?” Dean skims the menu half-heartedly since he knows what he wants without having to read the menu properly.
love you, Dean."
Dean that denies all special feelings towards his guardian angel. Although Dean keeps on name-calling him with sweet nicknames, Castiel knows better that Dean is just being Dean; and not being the new Dean who have accepted his own feelings for his best friend.
The young girl shoots a flirty wink at Castiel before she walks away into the back kitchen. Castiel who witnessed the wink is left clueless. Dean, on the other hand, rolls his eyes in frustration.
"I sighed because you're
, Dean. We're more than just buddies. We are lovers. You need to accept that."
"What's supposed to mean?" he asks Dean back.
to Dean's heart since he's feeling relieved for no reason. The anger he has felt earlier dissipates. All he feels now is how grateful he is to have Castiel loving him back to such extent. He knows now that he can never find another like Castiel, even if he searched the whole universe.
trying his best to keep his own words. He's trying his hardest not to push away Castiel whenever that angel is lingering around him way too closely. But Castiel isn't making it any easier for Dean, and Dean is finding himself stuck at a fork in the dubious road.
“Great to have you here, buddy! I could use a buddy around since Sammy ain't livin’ with us anymore.”
Castiel continues on with his mini adventure to the beach by walking by foot. The beach is located not too far from their apartment, and Castiel enjoys the beach the best among other places in LBC. He loves watching the kids playing around in the sand. He finds peace as he watches the dogs running around, catching waves as they crash onto the shore. He enjoys the scenery where people just take a short break from their busy life just to enjoy God’s creations. Castiel has always loved His creations from the very beginning of his life, as far as he can remember.
Castiel stares hard into Dean's apple green eyes before answering the question. "I call
also Castiel's day off. He opens his other eye. He looks sleepily around his bedroom as he adjusts himself (with a little struggle) after a very deep sleep. He proceeds to sit upright on his bed, stretching his arms up high and wide while yawning loudly to prove how good was his sleep last night. He smacks his lips a few times after and routinely rubs his nape as part of the process of waking up.
Castiel's frowns deeply. "You… broke… your phone…? What happened?"
precious to me for me not to do so …"
"I know how you feel about me, Dean. I know everything about it. And because of that, I came to love you back. Everything that you love about me, I love about them as well in you. Like I've told you that night, I LOVE YOU."
“I’ve always loved you, Dean. I’ve told you, right? Before The Empty sucked me in?”
"I'm sayin' that ya need to stop invadin' my personal space, dickbag."
“Let me go, Dean!”
He's breathing normal at last, much to both Dean's and Castiel's relief.
That's the text message that Castiel got from Dean. Castiel has replied,
much… that I can't help myself but wanting to do stuff for you… I want to treat you right, Dean …" Castiel leans his forehead against Dean's and sighs softly. He then whispers, "'Cause you're way
“Nah. Don’t think I want buns today. What’s for dinner anyway?"
Out of reflex, Dean catches Castiel by the forearm, stopping Castiel from walking away, much to Castiel's surprise. Both of them are left dumbstruck by the turn of events, which causes Castiel to sit back down on his seat quietly.
Dean gathers traces of his energy with all the remaining will in his body to even get off the couch and slowly makes his way into Castiel's room.
. Castiel's face scrunches up as he begins to worry about Dean's current whereabout. However, his worry is diminished once he saw the black Impala stops on the side of the road right before where Castiel stands. Castiel beams happily as he makes his way to the car.
"We're heading there now. Happy?!"
care for you tremendously. My love for you is the only reason why I still thrive to win in this lifetime of mine. I love you, and so I need to
"I'll have Western Burger and Common Space Helles Lager," Dean replies with a smile and hands over the menu in his hand to the waitress. She thanks Dean before she turns to look at Castiel who is apparently struggling to make a choice. "What ya havin', Cas?" he asks in order to hasten Castiel a little.
Dean glares as a response to Castiel. His face is now showing the bubbling anger that he is feeling in his chest. He subconsciously grabs Castiel’s duffle bag and angrily takes out the remaining stuff in the bag onto the bed while Castiel keeps on watching.
Dean doesn't turn his head to look at Castiel but just stares at his buddy from the corner of his eyes. "Got hold up by the flowers," he answers monotonously. Then he shifts the gear and continues driving to their next destination.
"Hello, Dean." He closes the door before staring at Dean with a frowning face. "Why were you late?"
Dean is infuriated by Castiel's answer. His fist is already flying towards Castiel's face when he is reminded of the amount of pain he had to bear when he did that the last time. He stops his fist right before it lands on Castiel's cheek.
Upon hearing that, Dean's lips slowly curl to form a soft smile. Castiel gives a deep sigh of relief.
Susie stares at Castiel confusedly but still listening nonetheless.
Since Leona broke up with him last Sunday, Dean was able to get through the week without getting weirded out by his new found feelings for Castiel since they don't see each other until dinner time every single day. Hence, Dean could keep it cool around Castiel when they are alone. But today …
happy with her, Dean. Isn’t that enough?”
Castiel's eyebrows knit tightly together, looking perplexed. "So … you alright?" he carefully asks the next question.
Before Dean can answer him, Castiel proceeds to conduct an unconsented full body search on Dean, causing Dean to aggressively push him away due to the privacy violation and feeling flustered.
"BUT NOT PRECIOUS ENOUGH FOR ME NOT TO KICK YER ASS FOR WHAT YA DID YESTERDAY," Dean threatens with a sly smile. Castiel manages to balance on his two feet despite being abruptly shoved. Castiel raises both his hands in defeat.
Whadd’ya mean?” His eyebrows are now knitted closely to display his confusion.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean glares.
Suddenly, the door lock makes a clicking sound. Apparently someone is trying to unlock the door from the other side.
Leona doesn’t buy that whole-heartedly. She starts to fish the answer she wants to hear out of Dean’s mouth. “Do ya LIKE Cas, Dean?”
thing, Cas."
Dean glances over at Castiel. He quietly gazes at his angel buddy. “D’ya think ya can?”
Dean doesn't comprehend Castiel's claim before the reality gradually hits him in the head. He finally remembers what happened earlier. "I broke my phone," he answers emotionlessly.
"THEN? Why the fuck did ya sigh after I told ya about my feelings?"
"Can ya stop treatin' me like I'm some kinda lady that constantly needs her
No word is spoken for a good long minute afterwards. Castiel is too cautious to be meddling with Dean's thoughts, seeing the silence that has befallen between them yet again. Then, out of the blue, Dean sighs heavily and weakly nods his head. "Okay. I'll tell ya. It wasn't
"Asshat," mutters Dean angrily.
Dean hardly hears the TV as his mind is solely focused on the fact that
Dean walks across the corridor towards his apartment with heavy foot. His brain is still wrecking over those words Leona has said to him about him and Castiel. He doesn’t know how to react to
?” Castiel rolls his eyes frustratedly.
Dean's face is all scrunched up. He is all riled up. Before he can make his argument, Castiel instantly cuts him and continues to explain, "Dean. Do you love me? You love me, right?"
"Love, love me do,
Castiel nods to himself after confirming the legitimacy of his story.
Dean tries to calm his nerves down. He shifts his gaze to watch the Netflix one more time, and he succeeds this time around once a pretty lady appeared on his screen. Dean's body naturally relaxes on the couch as he continues watching the show alone in the living room.
He turns his upper body around while his lower body is planted on the ground, facing the customer who is picking flowers for her bouquet, to check the received text message.
Castiel decides to break the ice. "We could've just meet here, Dean. You didn't need to fetch me from the coffee shop."
Castiel stares at him seriously. “What do you need me for? I think you better ask Sam to stay by your side, if that’s what you want. He
Dean's face changes to bitter in a split second, he's no longer smiling at Castiel, and he avoids making eye contact with Castiel altogether. And Castiel's heart skips a beat.
Castiel asks to himself. He can finally see the beach at the end of the street by now. Castiel smiles widely. His heart is contented.
at the corner of the restaurant.
“Yeah…” Dean rubs his nape nervously. “I met this girl the last time me and Sam went huntin’. She was a hunter as well back then. We got talkin’ and we hit it off, nice and smooth.” Dean gives his signature proud smirk. “So, one thing led to another… She’s livin’ in Long Beach, and I thought I just come down here to have a normal life with her.”
Because of Castiel's casual bodily contacts, Dean has become more paranoid around people. Dean would flinch unexpectedly when Maria is walking right behind him behind the florist counter. He would wince when he sees a hand reaching out next to him. He would literally jump whenever he felt someone bumped slightly against his back. And to add to his own nightmare, the paranoia heightens tenfold when the actual devil (or angel, in Castiel's case) is around him.
"I saw the FBI badge and all." It is Dean's turn to grasp Castiel's hand in his. He stares at Castiel with a soft look. "Ya don't need to hide. Ya can tell me, Cas."
Castiel feels offended. "What did I do wrong this time?"
Castiel quietly follows Dean from behind as they enter the pancake house - instantly the smell of freshly baked pancakes hit their noses, momentarily makes Castiel forget about what he was baffled about in the first place.
"Yeah. We're good now," he replies. Castiel smiles back warmly before he lets go of Dean's hand. "And now, who wants some pancakes?!" Dean beams.
Dean slowly pulls himself forward in his seat, with his back hunched slightly next to Castiel. He brings his hand to Castiel’s back and pats that large back lightly. “Thanks, Cas. I appreciate that.”
"Dean …" The soft voice of Castiel greets Dean's ear, and somehow it gives a soothing sensation throughout Dean's body.
Castiel detects the sudden cold shoulder from Dean. Castiel's spirit is not broken by it yet.
"What are we eating today?" he asks.
Dean quiets down. His eyes are still locked onto the ceiling. “D’ya think ya can ever love a man, Cas?”
Dean's eyes grow larger at the revelation. "
Dean pretends to be disgusted by Castiel’s accusation. “I never said that!” he cries defensively.
Dean’s wall is still up although it is cracking here and there after hearing Castiel’s plead. He laughs lightly as he comes up with a lame joke to divert their conversation away from the pressing issue.
to do when they are apart.
Castiel glances at Dean to see Dean's reaction of being alone with him in a public place, and Castiel notices that Dean is taking it quite calmly, unlike that other day. At least Dean smiles back at him whenever their eyes meet. He knows that Dean is comfortable in these moments.
apartment urgently, as if there’s some emergency back in here – EVERY – SINGLE - DAY.” Leona takes a deep breath and lets out another big sigh. “I’m just saying that we ain’t spending time together much nowadays. Should I know something, Dean?” she asks earnestly while staring at Dean.
“Guessing you like it huh?” Dean asks with a little chuckle as he spins to show off his new look. “I like the panties so much I thought I should try something a little more ya know.”
“Yea I’m ok, just thinking of how much you mean to me and how much I love you and just how happy I am in life right now.” Cas fully and honestly admits to his caring, selfless and loving boyfriend. Cas blinks a few times to get the tears away and then looks up at Dean adoringly and leans up to give Dean a quick and sweet kiss on his lips before Dean can even respond to what Cas has just said.
“Jerk…” Sam whispers but loud enough for the friend group to hear.
“Can we go see this one?” He points to a horror film called ‘Polaroid’.
Dean and Cas sit in the Impala, Dean driving, one hand on the steering wheel and the other out the window, Cas sitting on the other side of the bench, sticking his arm out the window as well, eyeing Dean with a sort of glare, as they make their way to their destination. Cas is usually sweet and respectable and very kind and not one to hold a grudge or fight with anyone, especially his husband but today he’s feeling like getting something off his chest.
“Just the cashier being standoffish.” Dean says as he pulls out of the lot and continues driving to the destination. “Did I get the right coffee?” He asks after a moment.
“Hm, well anyways, I’ll see ya when I see ya, I’ll probably call or text a day or two before I need you in by, that ok?” Bobby shakes himself from thought resting his bearded chin on his hand, getting to the end of the call so he can get back to work.
“Dean? Are you ok?” Cas inquires quietly in case it’s a private reason Dean is acting weird; Cas being very respectful with keeping Dean’s secrets and feelings between them if Dean doesn’t want anyone else knowing, and that is one of the reasons Dean and Cas love each other; looking at his boyfriend with concern in his features.
“Alright. Cas?” Dean looks briefly at his boyfriends soft features before turning back to the road.
“Yeah, well don’t expect too many more times you’ll get to drive her, so enjoy the trip down the road while it lasts when it happens.” Dean affirmed and they let go of the hug as Sam goes to pack a bag and Dean shakes his head a breathy laugh escaping his lips as he watches Sam go kinda kooky with happiness. “Oh and Sam hurry up, we gotta leave soon!” Dean yells from across the house as he looks at his watch, it reading 9:12pm.
“There’s no bars here, what happens if we get into trouble and need to call someone?” Cas worries as he exits the Impala and raises his phone into the sky, as if that’ll get him some reception.
“Hey, it’s your turn now.” The employee says as he gets the stuff ready to hook Cas in. Cas gets hooked in and he puts his hands up on the fake colorful plastic rocks and looks back at Dean who’s now holding his hips. Dean nods his head and gives a reassuring smile and Cas takes a breath and starts moving up.
Well he wants to feel extra sexy for Cas tonight, no special reason just because, so he currently is in a lingerie shop looking for something new to try. He takes a look at the night gown looking ones since he usually wears just panties, then he comes across a beautiful green lingerie dress with thong.
“Yes, we are. We have been since May 18th of last year. Mum we really like each other.” Mary opens her mouth to say something but Dean cuts her off this time. “Don’t say it, I know what you’re going to say, that we’re sick or brainwashed or that we only think we like each other cause of who knows what stupid reason you’ll come up with. Well none of that’s true, we’re not sick or anything like that, we like each other, maybe even love each other.” Mary scrunches her face in pure disgust at the words her son says to her, making Dean tear up slightly, heartbroken his mother disapproves of his sexual orientation. “And we’re staying together no matter what, so nothing you say will change that.” Dean sighs upon finishing his heartfelt and stomach churning speech as he deflates waiting for the undoubtedly bad news or response his mother will give him.
“What?” Dean asks as Cas still stares at him with vigour.
Dean sits at the couch with his mother staring at him intensely as she sits on a matching chair across from her eldest son who is sweating as he swallows out of severe nervousness awaiting his mothers fury at whatever it is Dean has done wrong. “Mu-”
“Cas. Cas, wake up babe.” Dean whispers as he climbs on their shared bed, messing the blankets up as he shuffles his way up to Cas’ face. Shaking his shoulders a bit and Castiel just groans and tries to move away from his husband, but Dean doesn’t let him move away, instead leaning down and giving him a sweet kiss on the lips, which immediately wakes Cas up as he sighs into the kiss and moves his hands to the back of Dean’s head, threading his hands in his short hair. But before Cas can deepen the kiss, Dean pulls back chuckling and smiling down at Cas, green eyes meeting blue ones.
“Yes, I’ve got a surprise for you.” Dean teases as he grabs Cas’ ass through his work pants, making Cas jump and smirk.
“Sorry just uh, was thinking of something.” Dean mutters and clears his throat, shifting slightly in his seat, so only Cas can hear him.
9:30pm
“Oh do you now?” Cas says deeply and Dean starts to pull off his house coat, revealing his new lingerie, Cas’ mouth dropping slightly. “Shit…”
“Let’s hope it doesn’t come for us Cas.” Dean says in a sarcastic scared voice, chuckling after saying his bit, shoving his shorter boyfriend with his shoulder slightly making Cas stumble a bit but laugh with him.
They pull up at Cas’ house and Dean leans over to Cas and puts a hand on his cheek to give him a sweet kiss on his lips. “I’ll pick you up around 9:30 ok?” Dean assures him as they pull away from each other so Cas can go in his house.
“Please…” Cas moans and curls into Dean’s touch. Dean then moves his hand to unzip Castiel’s pants and take out his leaking cock and start to pump it in his hand, making Cas moan and gasp repeatedly as he bucks up into Dean’s calloused hand with vigor. Dean kisses up Cas’ neck to his jaw and finally his mouth as he licks into Cas’ mouth. “Dean, I’m almost-” Cas moans and then whimpers when Dean gives an extra good stroke and starts to go faster making Cas make all kinds of beautiful noises and Dean kisses at Cas’ neck again. “Dean!” Cas moans loudly into Dean’s ear as he cums on Dean’s hand and both their clothes, Dean slows down and helps Cas through his orgasm and only stops once Cas pushes at his hand with a whine. “Sorry about the mess.” Cas whispers and looks down at the mess he’s made.
“Yes, I’m proud of you guys too.” Dean rolls his eyes as his friends seek for a compliment as well. “Wanna go get shitfaced at mine and Cas’?” Dean asks, whispering with a smirk, leaning towards his friends so the adults around them don’t hear him.
Cas makes his way down the hall and the stairs, entering the kitchen and seeing Dean making them each a BLT, setting them on Cas’ favourite yellow plates that his brother Balthazar gave him at Dean and Cas’ wedding. The plates have little grooves on them and they look kinda rustic, some nice old lady at a yard sale had told Balthazar that her late husband had made them for her, but she had to sell them since she had no one to pass them onto and she was going to live in an old person care facility. Balthazar told the lady, Grace was here name, that he’d love to give them to his brother and brother in law for their wedding gift and that they’d take very good care of them, the lady appreciated that and gave them to him for free, thanking him and giving a bright smile as Balthazar waved goodbye. Now Cas treasures these plates and uses them all the time, always being very careful while using them not wanting anything to happen to them, them meaning too much to him.
“I’m proud of you. You did great.” Dean says as he gives Cas a small kiss as they’re in public.
“Cassie your home!” Lucifer and Gabriel both say in unison as Cas shows himself in the kitchen, setting his messenger bag down on the island, slumping on a bar stool rolling his eyes at the nickname.
“Ouch. Well I don’t care what y’all think, I’m the best at movie picking so, I’m picking.” Dean responds, pulling out his phone from his jeans back pocket. Cas scooches up a bit so he can see Dean’s phone as he looks for a movie and one catches Cas’ eyes.
“Cas. I want you to do what you want to with life, I want your dream to be fulfilled, I can do mine later in life, you come first for me Cas.” Dean says and Cas’ heart warms at that, eyes tearing up as he listens to Dean.
“Yea it was and that was close, dad would have killed me if I marked her up or anything.” Dean says as he and Cas unpack the grocery bags into the trunk of the Impala, putting back the cart and getting in the car.
“Of course, especially if you liked it that much.” Dean agrees with a smile, holding Cas’ hand as they leave together.
“Well, I’m glad you wanna put your education first, you’re a smart kid, and for spots yes I have one open still and yes you’re hired, you seem like you know a thing or two about cars and I don’t mind having to teach, if you need it that is… and yes the school and whole waiting a week thing is fine with me. I’m just happy to know there’s still people out there like that, taking initiative to finish school then get a job so as to not overwhelm themselves, wish I had done that when I was younger. Anyways, yea that’s all good, just need your cell number and name and we’re good.”
“I know right!? I’m kinda shocked he’s paying that much. Oh he also thought my name sounded familiar, I’m kinda curious to find out why.” Dean replies and moves to stand up, Cas removing his hands from Dean’s shoulders and backing up. Cas takes Dean’s hand and they both make their way to the rest of their classes while talking about what to make for supper that night.
“Shit, what’s happening?” Castiel asks with sleep lacing his voice as he pulls on some clothes from his duffle bag and not bothering to make a move to fix his hair.
For the rest of the drive Dean and Cas talk about random stuff and how nice the drive is and wonder to each other how the weather will be like on their little adventure, all the while Dean plays some ACDC and Led Zeppelin on low, letting themselves enjoy the trip.
“Get your stuff packed and help me pack my shit too. We’re leaving for yours and... “ Dean starts as he packs his clothes and some random stuff he needs as he thinks about his next words and how much they’ll hurt. He doesn’t even know what they’re going to do after this. “You’ll probably have to pack all your stuff too, Mary is definitely going to tell your dad too.” Dean shakes his head and laughs lightly out of anger not knowing what else to do.
When Dean and Cas started dating Cas didn’t know about Dean’s drinking problem until about six months in, and Cas knew he would never leave Dean for anything, even when he found out about his addiction.
“Dean, thank you.” Cas almost jumps as he goes to kiss Dean quickly so as to not run them off the road. Even if Cas feels guilty to get his dream job before Dean, he is overly appreciative of what Dean is sacrificing for him.
“Walmart?” Dean quirks his head a little to the side to look at Cas who is already looking at him and he just simply nods and Dean goes the quickest route to their destination as it will close soon.
“Says you.” Sam gabs looking away from Dean out of embarrassment. Dean is wearing some ripped tight black jeans, a black tee shirt with a dark blue flannel over top, a pair of black high top Doc Martens and his ‘Samulet’ necklace along with a ring his mum gave him when he was 12. He always wears his jewelry no matter what.
“Ignore him if it bothers you, you know he’ll keep doing it. Anyways I think it’s kinda cute… just like you.” Dean says leaning close to Cas trying to make him lighten up about the nickname Gabriel has given him. Cas gives a small smile at Dean’s attempt and doesn’t say anything further about it, looking over at Sam, who is so very obviously ogling Gabriel from right beside him. “You like the view Sammy?” Dean teases and everyone looks at Sam, making his face go red in embarrassment of being caught staring at his crush, Gabe.
“It’s ok babe, we’ll have to clean up now though. We’ll take a shower and change.” Dean says as he rubs over his boyfriends' sides, then begins to undress them to jump in the shower and put their clothes in the wash.
“Oh also why do I have to get stuck with these weird pants?” Cas asks, raising his brow as he watches Dean slide on his black biker boots.
“I did it! Wooo!” Cas exclaims happily and he even climbs down on his own, Dean holding his hips at the end pulling him off and they smile and whoop excitedly together as Cas gets pulled into Dean.
“Uh, not sure, it’s not a very common name, I mean Winchester like the gun but, I don’t know who or what else you could be thinking of.” Dean says as he wonders who or what Bobby may be thinking of that Dean’s name reminds the man of.
Castiel opens his closet and searches for something nice to wear for the movies and to stay at Dean’s. He grabs a small duffle bag from the bottom corner of the closet and shoves a pair of jeans, an old band tee of Led Zeppelin Dean gave him when they first started dating, (it’s Dean’s favourite band) a pair of underwear and some socks. Cas also grabs a pair of light wash mom style jeans and a green sweater vest to put over his white long sleeve polo along with a darker green tie to pull it altogether, to match Dean’s eyes (Cas loves to dress up and look good for his boyfriend and to make his outfits look as best he can) and steps back from the closet to change, also grabbing a pair of dark green high top Doc Martens. (his favorite shoe company, he even got Dean to start wearing them)
“It’s ok Dean, I’m just happy you got a job, and the pay is so good too!” Cas beams and leans over Dean’s left shoulder to give him a quick kiss to the lips which makes Dean fully smile now.
“Yes Cas?” Dean asks sweetly, moving to hug Cas close to him.
The day arrives where they can move in and the teens are glad that the apartment already comes with a bed frame and some random furniture; an old creaky couch, stove, microwave, fridge and the apartment has a public laundromat in the basement. The couch may have stains and be a little gross but nothing they can’t just cover with a sheet until they get some money to get a new one. The apartment is pretty small too, but it’s an alright size for the two of them for now, before they move what little of their stuff they have in the boys make the decision to do some deep cleaning first. Surprisingly the place doesn’t have rats or any kind of bugs so that’s a relief for them, there is a little mold here and there but nothing they can’t take care of. They do a deep scrubbing of the microwave, stove, oven, fridge, toilet, shower and sinks then move to take care of the mold which takes not as long as they thought it would, then they go to sweeping and dusting then lysoling what they can and throwing out old stuff and garbage that has been left from the previous tenants. It takes them nearly all day but they get it done and go and buy a mattress and box spring from a discount place so they have a place to sleep and they get a good deal and the mattress is actually really comfy to their surprise as they set it on the bed frame, laying down on it after their long day. They don’t even bother to put sheets or pillows on and they fall asleep out of exhaustion half on, half off the new mattress that is such a big contrast to the rest of the apartment, the dingy, dull boringness of the apartment making the bed look like the gates of heaven in comparison.
“Fuck you’re so hard already, you really like this lingerie huh?” Dean nods and squirms on the bed, bringing his hands up to play with his nipples through the lace top of the lingerie. Cas rubs himself a few times at the sight and strips down to nothing, climbing on the bed between Dean’s legs and starts to pull the thong off Dean. Cas then leans down to lick up Dean's cock making his hands come to pull at Cas’ hair which in turn makes Cas moan and suck down Dean in one go, hitting the back of his throat. Dean moans and pulls Cas’ hair harder as Cas bobs his head and sometimes tongues Dean’s slit, when Cas knows Dean is close he pulls off with a pop and moves up to give Dean a kiss.
“It was actually really good, you’re an amazing pillow.” Dean laughs and they make their way out of the cave to start climbing again.
He parks Baby in the garage and sighs, plating his hands on his thighs just breathing for a moment, then he notices beside him half on the floor half on the seat of the car, Cas trench coat. How could Cas forget his trench coat? He always has it on, oh well, Dean will just let him get it back when he’s over later tonight. Dean grabs the familiar coat, hops out of the car and walks in the garage door connected to the house, which is thankfully next to the basement stairs, which leads to his bedroom, he doesn’t think he could handle his dad right now. He is having a great day so far so he’d rather not fight tonight. He walks down the stairs entering his room and he strips off his flannel, boots and sets Cas’ coat on his computer chair then he throws himself on his bed, laying on his back and closing his eyes.
“Cas, calm down, if you freak out you will fall. Just relax and I’ll let go when I know you’ll be ok.” Dean explains and Cas agrees hesitantly and begins to go further up, Dean’s hands soon slipping away and Cas not even noticing because of how invested he is in climbing and soon enough he makes it to the top, not even realizing it. “Oh my gosh Cas, you made it to the top!” Dean yells up to him excitedly, rubbing his hands together and smiling up at his boyfriend.
“I can’t believe I actually made it all the way, it was so fun! Can we do the real thing soon?” Cas asks ecstatically and they get out of their gear and leave to exit the building.
“Alright let’s get some drinks and I want a pie, then we’ll leave for my house.” Dean says and Cas nods as Dean zips around corners, going faster than usual since the store will close soon. “Ok, Coke, root beer and sprite.” He says grabbing the bottles of soda then making his way to the pastry section. “Ah, pie…” Dean almost drools as he sees all the different flavors laid out on the shelves. Dean grabs two pies, a blueberry one and a cherry one, and grabs a few bottles of whip cream before going to the self checkout.
“What do you want? It's too early.” Cas mutters still a little sleepy and the sheets ruffle as he moves to sit up slightly.
“Woah, no way I just heard that right!? You, Dean Winchester, just said you’d let someone, let alone Sam, drive Baby? Your one true love, besides Cas of course. You were joking right?” Charlie gawks as she stares at Dean in bewilderment from a couple chairs away, her thin frame leaning forward so she’s able to see Dean past Lucy and Castiel.
“Dean, can I…” Cas whispers breathily onto Dean’s open panting mouth, asking an unspoken question they both know the answer to.
“Fine. I’m never coming back. You won’t ever see me again. I’m gone.” Dean finally says and gives a hurt and maddened look towards Mary, leaving her standing in the hall and makes his way downstairs, stomping the whole way down, not giving a shit about the no stomping or running in the house rule anymore.
“Don’t. You know what it is I’m mad at you for.” Mary seethes as she continues the stare down at her son.
“I actually don’t know what you’re talking about…” Dean whispers barely audible to his mother who is now yanking, Cas’ trench coat from beside her on the floor? ‘Oh shit’ Dean thinks as his mother must have tried to do his laundry last night and grabbed Cas’ jacket from the basement stairs hook where Dean placed it late last night so Cas could grab it on their way out in the morning.
“Dean?” Cas calls from the bedroom and walks down the hall to the kitchen and living room, finding Dean passed out on the couch. “Dean.” Cas says to wake Dean up so he can ask what happened.
“Ok, so what does everyone want?” Their blonde haired, being strangely nice today, friend asks as they walk up to the concession stand.
“What’s up?” Dean questions as he grabs his backpack and Cas’ as he gets out of the car and around to Cas’ side, opening the door to let him out.

“Wanna delve a little on that babe?” Dean asks with a little laugh from nerves, tightening his hand on the steering wheel, knuckles turning white. He waits for a response but Cas says nothing more for the next hour, just deafening silence between the two. For that hour of silence, Dean worries that Cas knows about his mistakes and he chews on the inside of cheek as he tries not to think about it too much. Cas ponders on what to do as he stares at the trees that pass out the window. He knows Dean isn’t sober and hasn’t been for a long time, but he was holding hope that he’d maybe tell Cas and get help again or maybe get help himself or even just realize what he’s doing to his body and stop all together, but nope. Cas almost cries out of anger, disappointment and the want, no need, to get his love back to health like he was once when he met him.
