<< Indeed it is >>.
<< Taking care of our Morgan. We are entrusting you with an important piece of our life together >> says Sherlock, taking John's hand.
<< I lost my good boots to save you and you, cursed, lied to me! >> she says throwing the trolley on him. Sherlock promptly grabs it, miraculously saving his leg from suffering the consequences.
<< A kind, yes >> Sherlock replies, thinking that masochist certainly he is, since he devised such a plan.
<< You have been good, you have not cut tyourself even once >> says Mary. She leans over to the basin in which she dips a towel, squeezes it and throws it in Sherlock's face. Mary presses it hard on Sherlock's face with her hands, taking his breath away for a long moment before removing it. She dipping it again, wringing it out and starting to rub Sherlock's cheeks, chin, forehead and nose vigorously.
Sherlock is not even startled to see evil-Mary entering his room like a fury. Her eyes out of their sockets. She snorts like a bull ready to charge. Mary clutching  the strap of Sherlock's trolley in one of hers huge hands. She  had told him that she didn't recovered it.
<< It was thanks to Mike ... >>.
<< She is Abbott's daughter >>.
he realizes, seeking refuge in his Mind Palace.
<< Try once again to do one of your games as a seducer with my daughter and I will forget that you saved her, did you understand Fox? >> he says, hitting him on his chest with the accusing finger.
<< Why didn't Ms Ford file a report to the police? >> ask the chief.
<< Thank you >> he mumbles, trying to be polite and smiling.
<< Ok, Sherlock, the case is still open. You are out of the game. It's up to me to come into the game for you >> John says, straightening his back. << I hate injustice as much as you and, although that woman treated you in a way that I can't forgive her, it's not fair that she pay for the crimes she didn't commit >>
Sherlock feels the body covered by a thousand pins that sting him at the same time. He just glances at John and then looks away.
<< There is no need, director. Neither for me nor for him >> says Sherlock.
Mycroft observes the four men sitting beyond the precious oak wood desk of his study at the Diogenes Club with a skeptical and arrogant smile.
Sherlock is abruptly snatched from his Mind Palace by Mary's intimidating voice. He finds her almost attached to his face, intent on positioning the bed in a reclined position. In the air the smell of red-hot food expands combined with that of the woman, annoyingly too close to his face as she operates the knob.
<< Can you really do it? >> she asks in amazement. Sherlock nods and settles the violin under his chin and asks her with a nod to start.
<< Yes. M ... Myke >> Sherlock reply, remembering that it is still undercover
<< Of what? >>.
<< More than psychiatry there is an exorcist to be alerted >> Greg mumbles behind him, lost in reading the same manuscript.
<< No, no, no, John. Look >> Sherlock says, placing a photo of the pit under John's nose. << Both cities you mentioned are to the south, while the only way to get here and passing from the north, according to what can be deduced from the shape of the terrain and the network of roads and paths >>.
<< Excellent deduction, colleague >> retorts Greg.
<< I can't wait to let Mommy know. Maybe she will stop saying that your job is of no use to anyone except you >> adds George, slapping Greg on the shoulder.
The boy glances at the chair that they usually offer to customers and Sherlock takes it. He put the chair to form the top in a perfect triangle with their two armchairs and with a gesture of the hand invites the boy to sit down. Sherlock sits down in his armchair and John, who realizes only now that he is still in his pajamas, takes his place by putting his hand in the faithful notebook.
The girl's mother goes to meet Sherlock, followed by her husband. Both shocked and both hopeful of hearing from the brilliant consultant that no, their child has not decided to commit suicide. Someone must have hurt her. It is easier to accept the idea of violence leading to murder than an incomprehensible gesture like suicide. John has a stern look at Sherlock, who notices it although he pretends nothing.
<< Oh, yes it is. Strong and brave >> Sherlock smiles in love.
He takes his head in his hands and wonders why he is feeling this way. Not even in the worst of quarrels with one of his many women did he feel guilty as he is now. Guilty of what, then? To have wanted to deal with a topic?
<< Mary Abbott committed suicide >> John replies, holding his friend close. << Hataway himself came here this morning to give us the news. He brought the letter she wrote before hanging himself >>.
<< Lestrade, allow me to make an observation >> says Mycroft, catalyzing the attention of those present. << I think that you are proving to be a good father or better, to say it as the literature of the sector wants, a sufficiently good father >>.
John's throat dries instantly and the stomach draws all the blood from the body. He turns his gaze to Sherlock standing still, his arms crossed over his chest and his serious eyes fixed on him. John realizes only now that he is wearing a dressing gown. The dressing gown and ... nothing else.
<< I was afraid, Mary. I didn't know where I was and then I came here under cover for work >>.
The doctor runs his hands over his tired face. He shouldn't have allowed that evening to take place. When Bryan started playing the fool with Sherlock, John would have to take sides with his friend and put a stop to his ex-comrade. Instead he did nothing. John stood there watching, while Bryan forcefully dragged Sherlock out of 221B, merely rolling his eyes and snorting. This is because, after all, he liked the idea of also having Sherlock at one of their evenings in the pub. Although he knew how much Sherlock would have felt like a fish out of water in that environment. The John's desire to see Sherlock in a common place, to do common actions (such as drinking a beer, listening to music) was stronger than common sense.
<< Apparently >>  retorts John.
<< I saved your life! >>.
The nurses break into the room and invite the doctor and politician to move away and leave the patient in their care. Except that Sherlock seems to become more and more energetic and more and more stubborn from his desire to get out of bed and run to save that woman whose name screams and invokes. Only when John hears about sedatives does he shake and go back to his friend.
<< I am a  consulting detective and I don't need a license to carry on my work >> Sherlock points out seriously. << John, go with Gawin and keep me informed. I will go to analyze those footprints, in order to go back to the place where William's parents are >>.
<< Greg, I feel that something has gone wrong. I feel it, you understand? >> John says, turning his gaze to him. << Obviously, I hope to be just too apprehensive and you will have the chance to tease me for life if it were so. But I want to take away the whim, even just to get closer to those areas, and try to get his news. I need to know he's fine, Gregory >>.
John stands at the edge of the precipice. He cannot take his eyes off the car that is barely visible, half submerged by the snow. Men, ensured with climbing ropes, are digging the car up in an attempt to find out who occupies it.
<< About a week later, a stone was thrown against Ms Ford's study window >> says Ulrika. << Ms Ford was sitting at the desk and it was a real luck that nothing happened to her. I heard her scream frightened and I ran to see what had happened. I saw the big stone wrapped in a white sheet of paper held in place by an elastic band. I took it but Ms Ford tooken it out of my hands. She took the sheet of paper and she read it, turning pale. She almost passed out >>.
Mycroft lays his warm, dry hand on Sherlock's convulsive hand clutching the sheet.
<< Why should you compete with Fox? >> Sherlock asks him, placing the now empty cup on the arm of the armchair.
<< The hotel manager is in a hurry and doesn't want to wait for Scotland Yard >> adds Sherlock. << We will be undercover, so keep it to yourself Gavin >>.
<< Oh, goody-goody! >> John teases him, by winning his escape attempts.
<< Contacts are not allowed! >> exclaims the guard. John look at her in anger. However, he does not want to put Mary in trouble, who looks frightened at the severe woman who is depriving her of this simple gesture of consolation.
Sherlock puts the call down and winces when he hears the door open.
<< You risk not finding Molly at Bart's anymore >>.
<< Wait! >> says Greg, grabbing him by the arm. << How can you be sure that he was attacked by a man? >>.
<< You never feel pain, don't you? >> Sherlock asks, between his teeth.
"I don't permit you to kill him too," Sherlock thinks as he enters the large kitchen. A small wooden door was opened with enough force to unhinge it and hangs miserably on one side. A tall man, dressed in a long dark coat with a raised collar, gives Sherlock his shoulders. The man is breathless and his hands are on his face. Sherlock sees only the tuft of light brown hair ruffled by the rush.
<< In order not to deteriorate the relationship between Sherlock and his pusher of investigation >> Fox replies with a smile.
Sherlock drops his arms to his sides, looking at John in amazement. Then roll his eyes and sigh.
<< Ok, but he always says everything to you. It's the positive effect of your moving here, this, John. I have no desire to find myself as before. To wander in search of him without a shred of clue as to where he can be, until he deigns to show up! Not in the face of a case like this! >>.
<< What's different? >>.
<< The heat. It took the pressure off me >>.
<< How will you do it? They could also come from Lancaster or Morecambe or maybe from both places >>.
<< Please, shut up! >> Sherlock growls, annoyed by his mockery.
<< I don't understand the meaning of a porno movie. What do you do with it if you can only watch them? I mean, finding yourself in a similar situation is a thing, but to watch ... what's the use? >>.
<< I was at his house yesterday >> says John, choosing the words well. He doesn't want to give her a chance to get up and risk being punished by the guard, who doesn't take her stern gaze off her.
<< Yes, sir >> Martin mumbles.
<< I can't think that's just why, Mycroft >> tried to insist John. << You are talking about a boy prey to the fumes of abstinence. It has nothing to do with what we have witnessed before >>.
"Fortunately I'm totally made of morphine!" he thinks, barely feeling a dull discomfort in his legs. It is as if he were watching a movie scene, one of those in 3D that lead you to experience the situation firsthand. Sherlock looks at his body with detachment, sees those hands drop on him, on the trolley that presses against his chest, but he feels nothing. The audio is an inarticulate mass of grunts, moans and screams that mingle with the rhythmic thuds of the fists.
<< Will you never do it again? >> asks Mary menacingly.
<< How can  Sherlock leave anyone indifferent? >> sighs.
<< Stop making fun of me, Sherlock >> retorts seriously.
"I agree, Sherlock, but we'll take care of it when and if the opportunity arises, okay?" John intervenes. "She is a god-fearing woman. I really don't think she would risk anything more than the caress she gave you."
<< I don't say this, no. I saw him smile and play with the puppy, and I assure you that it was a good sight. That guy needs to thaw out a bit. Sherlock's already changed a lot since he's with you >>.
He grabs Sherlock's face and bites his lips to force him to open them. The tongue that enters his mouth causes Sherlock to gag. The man walks away as abruptly as he threw himself on him. Free from the weight of that body, Sherlock falls along the wall and finds himself seated. The smell of the attacker's sperm reaches Sherlock’s nostrils and vomiting finally finds its outlet.
<< You are here! >> John exclaims. He strokes the distance from the door to the bed on which Sherlock is sitting and stops a few steps away from him.
<< No, don't touch me >>.
"Oh, look at yourself!" James exclaims in disgust. “I admit that if at our first meeting I found you reduced in this way, I would have thought twice before getting involved you in our nice game. Come on, amaze me,  consulting detective. Why are these carcasses found here? ”.
<< I know >> Sherlock exclaims, getting up nervously from his chair.
<< You are wrong >> retorts the master, supporting his gaze.
"This too will come back as before, you'll see," John whispers in his head. "Your hairs will come back as beautiful as before all this began."
John cannot help noticing the use of time in the present. A sign that they have not yet realized, nor do they want to realize, that what is lying on the floor a few meters from them is a corps now lifeless.
<< Of course I understand it. But it does matter to me, Sherlock, I have a reputation to maintain >>.
<< Er, chief commissioner, I'm afraid you misunderstood ... >>.
<< William, you must know that the world is studded with individuals so self-confident that they don't realize they are wallowing in the mud. They are convinced that they are in spring water. Please, always keep on the shore, look at them and go beyond >> Sherlock says, winking at the child. << Chief Commissioner >>, he says, putting emphasis on the last words, << as my partner said, I have come, thanks to William's help, to a good point in the investigation >>.
<< Sherlock! >> shouts the child, flying into his arms. << I was so afraid >> he says, crying desperately. Sherlock holds him tightly and cradles him gently, caressing his tousled hair. Morgan approaches to lick Sherlock's hand, seeking comfort in turn.
<< I saw something that is strange >> William says, stopping outside the kitchen. He doesn't know if proceed among the scientific department's men.
Sherlock grabs the 'parrot', saing a tested and submissive 'Thank you'. The woman turns away to give him a moment of privacy. Not even his mother and all the nannies Sherlock has had, have managed to get so much from him and in such a short time.
<< Humiliation hurts more than beatings, John >> Sherlock replies gravely. << Mr Ford is not stupid. He knows that leaving marks on the body of a child can make a problem also for an untouchable like him >>.
<< I didn't want to >> she whispers in a broken voice. << I tried to stop her, but did not listen to me >> adds and big shiny tears are released from the eyes and roll on her cheeks. << I convinced her to leave him a blanket, so maybe he can survive >>.
<< I want to stay with you >> whispers the child. Sherlock and John exchange a surprised look. << Mum and dad made a mess, I don't want to be with them anymore. I told dad that I didn't like Sharon and that I didn't want that she staied with with Silver, but he didn't listen to me. Dad said I was too young and that those were big decisions. It's  fault of mom and her book if Sharon's gone crazy. I don't want my parents anymore >> William says, crying silently in the consultant's warm and reassuring embrace.
<< You're here, next to me in my bed instead of upstairs in yours >>.
The consultant rolls his eyes and then look at John.
<< My father was a doctor and taught me >> she replies. << When the snow was too much, people came here to be treated and stayed for hospitalization. Our house transformed into a hospital and my mother and I had to act as a nurses >> she says snort. She must not have liked so much to help her father. << Do you have someone waiting for you in London? >> asks him looking suspicious. Sherlock think that it is something rather strange.
<< Did your dad lock you in the storage room to punish you? >> Mary asks him, moving the chair closer to the bed.
"A child" deduces. They run through the gate, chased by the murderer's footprints.
<< No. I am a consulting detective, the only one who exists in the world and my name is Sherlock Holmes >>.
, Lestrade. It is possible that seeing me involved in the investigations, together with the team I am part of, Mycroft does not want to know to come to our aid. On your side, however, he has an open account that he has not paid up to now and I think it's time to do it. He can permanently remove what is circulating about your daughter, save her reputation, in a way, and help you save someone you care about. Just like you did in his time and still do for him >>.
<< Would you like to keep it up for me? >> asks and sees her cheeks blush with embarrassment. Sherlock fears that he has used too seductive a tone and bitterly regrets it. Fortunately, however, the woman just keeps the mirror half a meter away. Sherlock moves her hands a little more to his left and struggles to recognize the face reflected in the mirror.
<< Are you better now? >> asks the consultant, placing a hand on his arm.
Sherlock immediately noticed his attitude. He sat down, wrapping himself in the blanket, as if he had suddenly felt embarrassed. There was no longer any trace of the smile or the expression of bliss on his face.
<< To the pit >> she admits, squinting.
<< Due what the maids say about him, I would not give him so wrong, John >> Greg points out.
John hears Sherlock speak in Spanish and it amazes him. John knows spanish, but does not spend too much time listening to what Sherlock and the expert are saying. The speech left hanging still spins in his belly. The answer to your question... struggles to find it, put it into words, mentalize it. It's something important, though. Something that has already created a distance between them, John feels it. And maybe that's why he never addressed the topic.
<< Neither do I >> agrees Kelly. << I try, as far as I can, to protect William, at least when I'm here >>.
<< It's Martin McNeel >> Sherlock says to John, who immediately turns in the direction he is looking towards. << I hooked it >>.
<< Do you think that the kidnapper already tried three months ago to enter the house and that something went wrong? >>.
<< Are you all right up there? Have you had any storm damage? >>.
It's snowing. He walks along a natural path, hearing shrill and creepy cries in the distance.
<< I'll burn your heart >> Moriarty had told Sherlock. John can't help but chuckle thinking that the Napoleon of the crime will not even have to get his hands dirty. John had burn Sherlock's heart.  Him, the blogger without whom the consulting detective would be lost.
<< Good morning, John >> greets him, rather annoyed by his abrupt entry into the room. << To what do I owe the honor of your visit? >> asks just looking up from his papers.
<< No! >> Sherlock exclaims, drawing his attention. The man laughs. A terrible laugh. He turns slowly, still clutching the knife.
<< She was going to kill you too, little brother >>.
<< You too, Mary >> he reciprocates her, holding her tightly in his arms.
<< No, John >> replies the reporter. << I think he wanted to show him how he can be able to implement his threat >>.
<< So... killed by you or by a needle in my arm... what changes? Didn't you say that? Somehow you have to die >>.
<< Morgan, I have an important task to entrust to you. Open your ears well! >>. The puppy barks and sits even straighter. << William's life is about to change and there will be ups and downs. John and I want you to stay close to him and protect him, just like you did today. Do you think you can do it? >>. The dog barks and places a paw on the child's knee.
The old man explains with difficulty what he feels. The right hand at stomach level is a pained expression in which John finds himself. From the visit, John hypothesizes the presence of a gastric ulcer, which joins the hiatal hernia and Crohn's disease located at the height of the colon.
<< Did you put a vagabond behind a girl? >>.
<< I have to take urine samples. I want to examine them and see if they really drugged me. If I find something Molly will be able to compare the results with what was found in the victim's body and we would get an aggravating circumstance >>.
<< Really? >> Sherlock exclaims theatrically. << What is a Spa? >> Sherlock asks John softly, leaving the place.
She grabs him by the arm and drags him out of the storage room and then down the stairs. Sherlock tries to be silency. He doesn't want violent-Mary to be mad at him, making what is going to happen even more painful.
He clicked off before realising that he hadn’t said, “I love you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come here,” John says quietly, and Sherlock obeys, walking meekly to stand beside John in the hall.
and they’d rented it several times since they began dating.
John plants a kiss at the base of his spine, with his hands resting lightly on his hips.
Before he takes another breath, Sherlock snatches up his shorts and underwear, resisting the urge to grumble under his breath about what felt like an infinite lecture on Hamlet and most definitely NOT just thirty minutes. When he turns around, John is sitting on the sofa. He points between his knees at a spot on the floor. Sherlock takes his position, kneeling with his head bowed.
“Of course, I’m fucking crying, Sherlock! I thought you were going to die and I’d be alone again. I couldn’t take it. Because I love you. You know I do. I always have. And then you tell me you fucking love
“No, you should go to the party.” John is adamant. “You’ll regret it if you don’t. This may be the last time you ever see some of these people.”
WW:  I really want to see Black Panther or Infinity War. I hear they’re awesome.
Settling into the other lounge chair, John motions for Sherlock to join him. John spreads his legs, and Sherlock sits between them, leaning back against John’s chest. Together, they look at the night sky. Sherlock’s head is buzzing from the wine, and his limbs are heavy.
John pampers Sherlock after his ordeal.
“Stop it Molly!” he hisses, taking her small hands in his.
Sherlock looked down at their joined hands for a moment, then up through his thick lashes to meet John’s gaze. The candlelight danced in his blue eyes, and the effect was so seductive that John had the urge to fling the table aside and take Sherlock in his arms. But he resisted that urge and instead licked his lip.
“Normally, we would take thirty measurements to make sure the suit is perfect. But I understand you need it quickly. I think we can make do.” He sits on a low stool at Sherlock’s feet and begins working on the hem.
He slips one hand beneath the table and begins to massage John’s thigh, running his hand up and down the length of it before coming to rest on his target. He rubs his palm over the soft bulge a few times and it springs to life. John shifts, pushing himself into Sherlock’s touch. “Keep going,” he says.
“C’mon, we can eat on my bed. Those guys ain’t as bad as they seem. Well, summa them are I guess, but most of them are cool, totally fucked up, but cool.”
“Here, you’ll like this better, I promise. Stick out your tongue.”
It comes automatically now. “Yes, Sir.”
John squeezes Sherlock’s thigh when he doesn’t immediately respond.
“You think you’d have shot it into your arm?”
“While we're here, we might as well get to know one another. I’ll start. I’m Dr John Watson. I’m a medical doctor. Retired captain from the British Army, First Armoured Division, Fourth Infantry Brigade.”
John chuckles. “Ah, yes. The one downside of going bareback.” John pulls away and looks at him sternly. “Which you never do without test results in your hand.” Sherlock almost rolls his eyes, but John’s fingers skim lightly over his backside.
He flattens his tongue and drags it slowly up the underside of John’s penis, flicking it across the glans and kissing the tip lightly, then licking again, then kissing, teasing. John’s scent is intoxicating, and Sherlock breathes it in as he opens his lips and lets him slide in.
Martha approached the piled luggage. “She’s right. There’s a deck of cards, Yahtzee, and Cluedo.
“And Rule number one in your portion: serve, obey, and please. It would please me very much to have you accept this gift. Understood?”
John returned his attention back to Beefy, who’s sputtering had ceased and who now stared sightlessly at the ceiling. He turned him over to find the handle of the knife jutting from his back.
Pete shakes his head. “No can do bro. You know it doesn’t work that way.”
“Bye, Myc.” Sherlock hangs up on him.
“I made contact with Moriarty. I spent six months building a relationship, convincing him that I was dirty and that I could deliver Sherlock in exchange for a handsome fee. In person. I was supposed to bring Sherlock to meet Moriarty in London. I arranged for Sherlock to give a lecture there and made an excuse to travel with him. He didn’t know anything about the plan. He has a way of trying to do things his way, especially if it involves me, and I needed full control—"
He holds up his bicep and flexes his muscle. “Five pounds.”
John kisses him again and says, “I think that can be arranged. All right then, up you go. Let me finish my notes,” John says as they get to their feet. “Shower and—"
Looking at Sherlock's gaping mouth with amusement, John says, “The rollatini and linguine with clam sauce. More than enough to share.”
It was light outside, and the rain clouds had disappeared; visibility would be ideal. They were well camouflaged, but he couldn’t count on not being spotted by someone with binoculars. John stuck his head out of the shelter and saw nothing but clear blue sky. The aircraft seemed to be some distance away—for now.
SH:     Yeah.
“Two more minutes, sweetie. Be patient.”
“Well done, Molly!” He had underestimated her.
“Do you love him?”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
As she’s pouring the lemonade, Ms. Hudson continues to play hostess. “Plates are at the far end. John, please load Sherlock’s plate up. He has got to put on some weight.”
“You like my arse, do you?”
A black sedan was waiting at the kerb, and John slipped into the back seat. The young female driver turned to him. “Hello, Dr Watson. I’m Janine. Shall I take you to your hotel?”
Sherlock’s eyes drift closed, and he hums with contentment as John continues, kissing the base of his neck and the tops of his shoulders. Small, gentle kisses accompanied by murmured endearments.
John didn’t know what to say. Or how Sherlock knew what he had been doing. He raised his seat to the upright position.
Sherlock is still against the wall, gasping. “I’m sorry I’m not allowed to touch.” He looks down at his obscenely tented trousers. “He may have to let them out some.”
“Pardon?”
. Every nerve ending is tingling, every muscle tensed, waiting for permission to let go and
“Sherlock?” John startles Sherlock out of his thoughts.
put Sherlock's song to music and sings it beautifully
SH:         With John.
Obediently, Sherlock drops to his knees.
“Lots and lots,” Moriarty said. “Your brother is a greedy man! But if your technology works—"
John looks at him for a moment and nods slowly. “Right. Well, we agree we’ll just have to trust each other. Just don’t trust anyone else.”
“Sherlock, turn around, please.”
John chuckles softly and pulls the covers up again. “See you tonight, sweet boy.” And Sherlock drifts back into a peaceful sleep.
“That’s what I thought. I guess I figured it out pretty early by experimentation. And I would call myself a versatile top. I prefer topping, but I can definitely enjoy a cock in my arse.”
He really,
“I’m placing my trust in you, Sherlock. In that environment, you may have access to opiates. I recommended you. If you cock this up, it reflects on me, understand? Do you think you can handle it?”
“I haven’t sold the computer for drugs if that’s what you're worried about,” Sherlock says, bristling at his brother’s interrogation.
Sherlock turns around, and for a moment he can’t find himself. It isn’t until he catches sight of his face in the mirror that he realizes it isn’t a mannequin or a life-size cutout, it’s him. He is...handsome. Elegant, even. He turns his head to look over his shoulder, and Molly and Martin nod.
SH: I wish you were coming home.
“Right now, what, Sir?”
“I always wondered who Will was.”
an asshole, Myc.” There’s almost no bitterness in his voice, and Mycroft notices. His lip twitches, and he says, “I’m an asshole who bought you an expensive gift. Please open it. I know you already know what it is.”
“I’m sorry, you get one, and that’s final.”
“Damn, Sherlock! I see why you like him. He’s gorgeous. I’m almost jealous.”
“Um. I don’t know what I was expecting. So, I guess the Red Room of Pain is down the hall?” She blushes and giggles.
“I’ve heard you say his name. I’ve heard you talk to him.”
SH:  I’m out
Jim raises his hand and nods in greeting.
“Of course, it will work!” Sherlock interjected.
“Call me John. And you deserve it, Molly. You wouldn’t have gotten it unless you met the requirements.”
John felt Sherlock’s chest hitch under his arm. Jesus Christ, He was crying. John had no idea what to do in this situation. John Watson could stitch up a wound, amputate an arm on a battlefield, or shoot a man in the heart from thirty metres, but he had absolutely no clue what to do with
“Y...yes, Sir. Please.”
John unscrews the top and holds the bottle over Sherlock’s head. He tips his head back, and John lets the water pour slowly into Sherlock’s mouth. He swallows until John can no longer keep up the charade and bursts out laughing, which sets Sherlock laughing too, then choking. John pounds on his back and gasps out, “You’re lucky I’m a doctor and up on the latest life-saving techniques.”
“Where are you staying?”
His reaction made John wonder if his own appearance was as much of a surprise as his seatmate’s was to him.
John shakes his head. “Never mind. It doesn’t matter.” Clearly trying to change the subject, he goes on. “Now that we’ve gotten the renegotiation out of the way, that leaves the part of red hour, or in this case, red day, that serves as a transition back into the contract.” He quirks an eyebrow in Sherlock’s direction.
This makes him think of Mrs. Hudson and he almost laughs.
“Git. It means that you need them more than I do. Now put them on, goddammit.”
Sherlock said nothing. He willed his face into an expressionless mask.
“Molly. Really. Thank you, but I don’t get along with any of those people…maybe you’ve noticed. I’m not...likable.”
“Is that clear?”
Jim stands up straight and clears his throat self-importantly. “A female patient came in this morning with acute lethargy, hypertension, and tachycardia, which means an elevated heart rate. She said she took Adderall, not uncommon in college students, but her symptoms don’t quite match what we’d expect from amphetamine, and her urine tox was negative for amphetamines. We’ve got the pills right here,” Jim says, gesturing to a container on the countertop.
“It’s beautiful.”
peeing.”
Earlier this morning, John had asked around about a custodian with red hair and struck pay dirt. A name. Jay Wilson, Custodial and Maintenance Supervisor, and he is about to pay Mr. Wilson a visit. Following the music, John comes upon a small room with a table, lockers and a refrigerator, and he pauses in the doorway. Two men in blue uniforms, one blonde and one bald, sit at the table, drinking coffee, an open box of doughnuts between them.
Sherlock looks down, terrified they will get caught, but John looks up at him, mouth full of cock, with a wicked smirk in his eyes and tilts his head towards the curtain. Sherlock takes a breath and clears his throat. “Yes, Mr. Greenfield, they’re a little loose.”
Wiggy gets bailed out, and Sherlock and John settle in for a relaxing night of Netflix and popcorn that ends up being quite a bit more.
rules that had improved his life!
He wakes to someone shaking his shoulder.
“Male then. Well, this gives me an extra incentive to come. Can’t wait to meet your—‘friend’.”
“Shall we try again then?”
********
“You are damn right I'm angry," John said, as quietly as he could, when what he wanted to do was shout. "You flirted with another man.
“Someday” implies a future for them, doesn’t it? Beyond the month or so they have left before John will go back to London and Sherlock will...do what? And what if he doesn’t get into school? He’d finished the online Common Application this week, no doubt saving himself several strokes of the paddle, and had emailed Ms. Hudson the first draft of his essay. Still, John promised he would stay in his life and what he’d just said implied that they would be physically together. Sherlock puts the questions of where and how and when aside and tries to concentrate on the present moment. He buries his face in John’s hair and hugs him tightly. “Just for us, Sir.”
“Oh, I forgot who I was talking to,” she says, smiling. “You never miss a thing.”
Likewise, in business class, most of the passengers were asleep. As he passed the second row, he saw an older woman in a floral blouse and headphones, swaying and bopping to music. She looked up and smiled at him as he walked by. He smiled back.
“But he’s like...your boyfriend?”
Sherlock has a moment of panic when he realizes he forgot to eat lunch. He rationalizes that John didn’t tell him he had to eat, only that he should write everything down. Technically. He changes the subject.
“We have a consensual relationship, Myc. That’s all you need to know.”
A black sedan is in the driveway. Sherlock locks the door behind him and walks toward it. The driver gets out.
“That sounds wonderful,” John says. He looks at Sherlock. “You in?”
The crop finally gets some use, and our lovely boy loses his virginity.
As he approaches his bike, he looks up and freezes. Giddy anticipation is instantly replaced by a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. Bright pink streamers hang from the handlebars of his bike, the kind favored by ten-year-old girls. Pink, purple, and yellow plastic butterflies, dozens of them, are attached to his spokes. And, hanging behind the seat, is a handmade cardboard license plate with the word “FAG” written in bold black marker.
Sherlock arrives at Greenfield’s at nine twenty carrying one of the white shirts. He’s pretty sure that lateness would earn him a stroke under Rule one and isn’t taking any chances. John’s car isn’t there. He enters the shop, and Martin greets him warmly.
But this is the last one.
“Sherlock!” Molly throws her arms around him and kisses him on the cheek. He accepts the kiss without flinching. She has become one of the few people whose social touching doesn’t feel like an invasion of his personal space. Thankfully, Janine, Ms. Hudson, and Marie greet him enthusiastically but without following suit. Even Wiggy just gives him a fist bump.
“Oh, my gorgeous, sexy boy.” Placing Sherlock’s knees over his shoulders, he leans down, kisses him hard, and moves again, burying himself in Sherlock’s body, while panting out between kisses and bites, “I want to consume you, Sherlock. I want to possess you and keep you for myself. I never expected this. Never expected you. I…” John’s voice trails off and Sherlock wonders what he’s left unsaid, but the feel of John’s thick cock sliding into him, the lips on his face and neck, and the grip of his own hand are overwhelming, and the tide of orgasm begins to overtake him.
fucking necessary. And I’d do it again. Do I need a lawyer? I’m beginning to think maybe I need a lawyer.”
“Yes, Ms. Hudson.” He looks at his shoes, fidgeting as she opens the note and reads it.
had engaged him like no other fiction. He’d considered
She handed him a paper bag. “Biscuits. Oatmeal—Your nanna’s recipe.”
John patted Sherlock’s feet and legs dry, hesitating as he moved up to his thighs. This was an emergency if ever there was one, but he didn’t want to touch the man’s genitals without permission. He halted and looked up. “May I?”
After their soda, Sherlock heads home and finally texts John.
“Hmmm,” Sherlock mused. “Possibly, but there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.”
“After me, not before. You’ll feel me come, and then it will be your turn, understand?”
John smiles at them. “Hello, fellas. I’m looking for Jay Wilson.”
“I’ll be waiting for you.”
“Will—Sherlock. I…I…”
He’s been through the photo albums she made many times, but he’s never seen this picture before. She’s sweaty, and she looks exhausted, but she’s looking at him with her mouth slightly open like he’s some kind of miracle, and she doesn’t know how he got there. She looks so young. He flips it over. Written in fading blue ink, he sees:
“Sherlock.” He touched the man’s shoulder and felt him flinch.
“My half-sister. We share a mother. Sherlock talked about Eurus with you?”
“No! Sir, of course not! I’m just...feeling hopeful.”
“Soon, sweet boy. Soon,” John whispers as his thumb rubs the sensitive spot just under the head.
“Yeah.”
“We are not friends,” he says as he continues toward the exit.
John grips the phone so hard, his fingers hurt as he shouts, “I’ve been out of town in emergency surgery since this morning. I just fucking found out what happened and I’m trying to get home as fast as I fucking can. And you know what else? I
You see, I’ve been recording everything. And now, the cherry on top.” He holds up the phone and snaps a photo, then drops it back into his pocket.
“Calm down, sweet boy,” John says in a soothing voice. “Give that brilliant brain of yours a rest and just enjoy what you’re feeling. Let go. Give me control. Trust me.” John has moved down to Sherlock’s lower legs and is massaging his left foot, sliding oily fingers between his toes causing him to jerk and giggle.
“Come here.” John pulls Sherlock to stand between his thighs and slides his hands under his T-shirt to rest on the bare skin just above his shorts.
"I put those in today,” John says, reading his mind.
“May I sit?” Mycroft said.
“I don’t know about dangerous, but he’s arrogant and ambitious, and I don’t trust him. And he has reason to dislike me. He and I have had…issues. I wouldn’t put it past him to try to get back at me through you or Molly. But let’s not ruin our day talking about Jim. Let’s go to the festival and see what’s going on over there,” He points across the Scioto where the Pride festival is underway on the opposite bank. “Then we can sit by the river and watch the sunset. I could use some quiet.”
“It is what it is, kid. Not all of us got a rich brother.”
She hummed noncommittally, and he knew she was far from done making her case on the matter. Before she could argue further, John glanced at his watch and announced that he had to run if he were going to pack and make his flight to Boston.
“Myc, It’s Sherlock...I need you to come get me. I’m in trouble.”
“Look at me, Sherlock,” John orders. “I’ve given you a lot of leeway today, but that crosses the line. Rule 5, putting yourself down. Two strokes. Try again.”
“No, not that. I mean, yeah, I’d like to hear about that sometime, but it’s not what I was wondering just now.”
Sherlock knew that same-sex marriage is now legal. His dad had made a huge deal of it, had complained loudly and often when the Supreme Court case was decided a couple of years ago. He’s known for some time that Ms. Hudson is a lesbian and that she wears a wedding ring. Still, meeting Marie makes it real, and he feels uplifted. Until now, he’d felt disconnected and excluded from an aspect of life that other “normal” kids were experiencing, and the constant disapproval and ridicule from his father made him feel ashamed. But since meeting John, that burden is gradually falling away. Seeing Mrs. H and her wife makes it a bit lighter still. This is a life that happy “normal” people live. And don’t try to hide. Maybe he can be one of them someday.
Sherlock groans an answer, “Yes, Sir, please, god, please can I come?”
“Go ahead then, Molly.”
. Sarah Sawyer. She’s earned his respect. They have been friendly over the four summers he has been coming here. He never even would have considered her capable of something like this.
“People are
“Shut it.” He leans in and whispers, “I’d like you to wear your collar for me, Sherlock, but it’s up to you...”
The hallway is filled with chattering students. End of school year excitement is palpable as they talk about graduation parties, vacations, and all the ways they will enjoy the freedom that summer brings. Head down, smiling, Sherlock pushes past them to the doors and then outside into the late May sunshine. He walks toward the bike rack, eyes still focused on the ground in front of him, thinking about John.
Myc looks at Sherlock with a tilted head and raises an eyebrow, then shifts his gaze to John, who meets his eye and gives him an ever-so-slight smile, as if to say,
“Yes, Sir.”
“Not sure yet. Here, drink this. And take these.” John handed him three tablets.
“Hands on your head.”
The EMTs lift Sherlock onto the stretcher and one of them says, “OK, doc, I think he’s back. You coming with?”
“Er, it’s not really my area. What do you suggest?”
the thing inside him is buzzing and touching him in just the right place. His dick is getting hard and he looks down at it.
“Was it bad spice? You gotta see the doc if it’s that shit. That shit’ll kill you.”
John fingers the whip. “This is a dragon-tail, one of my favorites.” He flicks the end painlessly over Sherlock’s chest. “It can be light, almost like a back scratch, or wickedly painful. It’s harder to control than the paddle or the crop, and I need you to be still. I want to immobilize you. Is that OK?”
“It’s been a very long time since I’ve invited anyone to dine with me.”
“Ohhh,” he moans.
Perique, Latakia
John stands, and the two men shake hands.
“Does it matter?”
must be experiencing tonight.
He looks at John’s penis, hard and glistening, for just a moment, then up at John through his lashes. Then, while still looking into John’s eyes, slides the foreskin back with his hand and covers the head with his mouth. John’s eyes flutter and close, and his hands go to Sherlock’s head where they rest lightly. Sherlock begins to stroke with his hand and mouth as John rolls his hips into him.
He watched the curly head bob as Sherlock's mouth worked him into a frenzy. In John's opinion, fellatio was one of Sherlock's greatest talents; which was saying a lot for a man who had so many. He tightened his grip on Sherlock's hair as heat gathered in his belly. “Here it comes,” he whispered hoarsely. As his sight dimmed and his consciousness narrowed into that pinpoint of exquisite singularity between his legs, he let out a cry and came hard in Sherlock’s sweet blackberry mouth.
“What?”
“Good boy. I’m really happy to hear that. I was hoping you would.”
“...suit, just a jacket and tie.”
He grins down at her. “You’re not his type.” She punches him in the arm.
Wiggy holds up his hand and grabs Sherlock again as he tries to turn for the door.
Sitting by the door works, because Sherlock gets to hear other people’s responses before he has to answer and when his turn comes, he says, “I’m Sherlock Holmes, um, I’m a him, and I’m more of a science person than humanities, but I need a humanities course and this seemed to be the most useful one to me.” There are a few chuckles and nodding heads at that. It gives him enough courage to go out on a limb. “And I guess I’m looking for all the advice I can get about what it means to be gay.” More nods and murmurs of agreement and he feels like he’s left high school behind for real.
There was a knock at the door.  Thinking it was Mrs Hudson again, he opened it and peered out, careful to keep his lower body hidden behind the door.
Sherlock stands to obey and says, “Yes, Sir, but not to be disrespectful, what about the plug?”
As John says his name, Sherlock thinks,
“I didn’t get to finish. Open the door and let me finish.”
Annie says, “If he’s that sensitive, I’d recommend checking in with him more often. Maybe a little manhandling. Don’t let him drift so far. Keep him with you.” She pokes John’s chest with a manicured finger. “And feed him! He’s got no padding!” She points at Sherlock’s arm and makes as if to touch him. “May I?”
“Yeah, well, not anymore.” He looks away and shoves his hands into his pockets. “I don’t want to talk about him.”
John enters the room carrying a tray. “I figured you’d say that, but you’ll at least have toast and juice,” he says. His tone is soothing, but it’s a command, nonetheless.
Sherlock looks at his father in surprise.
“Hey, Sherlock, how are ya.”
Realisation dawned on Sherlock, and he cursed himself silently for having not seen it sooner. “Oh! I get it. Clue. Was that Mycroft’s idea? Is that why we didn’t have this conversation yesterday? You thought I couldn’t resist playing Clue. You thought I’d bond with them, develop some sympathy. You overestimate me, I’m afraid.”
“At the end of the airing of grievances, so to speak, Ellen gave Sammy what they called a maintenance spanking, just to start off the week with both of them in the right mindset. To reestablish the terms of the power exchange. Maybe we should think about trying something like that. What do you think?”
“So you believe me?”
Sherlock hears a smack.
Free to do what, he’s not sure. He’s certain it does not involve staying in this town, with these people. But he has no plan. Yet. He doesn’t want to make a plan that doesn’t include John somehow.
“Sir?” He shook him, but still, the man didn’t stir.
*********
“London?”
After dinner, Sherlock is clearing the table and tidying the kitchen while John works in his study. The whiteboard is still there with its tally, reminding him, as if he needed a reminder, of his debt.
SH:    You said you’d be home for dinner.
“Do you think you could do that—help me, I mean. Soon? Tonight maybe?”
“What do you mean, just you?”
Sherlock pulls an all-nighter, less worried about passing the exam than proving to John that he can obey instructions and actually read the books. He almost gets sidetracked considering all the connotations of the word obey, and what it might mean for him, but puts it aside as a distraction. He can focus when he needs to, dammit. The test is at one o’clock. He has some speed stashed in one of his old tennis shoes. Generally not his thing, but good in an emergency. Takes one. Then another. That and three or four bottles of 5-Hour Energy and he’d fuckin’ nail Ponyboy to the goddamn wall. Who the fuck does John Watson think he is, anyway?
. Despite the seriousness of his situation, despite his fear, and his anger at being falsely accused, despite all of this, the fact that John is here makes him smile with happiness he can’t contain, and he sees John’s mouth form his name as their eyes meet.
John picks up one of the cards and looks to Sherlock for permission. When Sherlock nods, he reads it. “She thought a lot of you. She had high expectations. You can live up to those expectations. I know it, and so do you. You had people that cared and wanted to help, but you were stubborn and wouldn’t let them in. But you have me now, and I’m not going to put up with your bullshit. I’m going to help you be the man she wanted you to be.”
Sherlock looks at John desperately for guidance. John just looks grim.
“Yes. That’s what I mean. Paddling isn’t the only way for me to punish you. You broke the rules and disregarded your commitment to my authority. There will be consequences. Your brother and I agree that you need more structure, and being in a dom/sub relationship means we would be increasing that intensity as well. Given what’s happened, we’re going to be moving more quickly than I would have preferred, but there’s nothing for it. Having you naked should remind you of your place in the agreement.”
“I’m sorry.”
old?”
“As handsome as you looked in that tux, you are exquisite without it,” John says, taking his hand and leading him into the bedroom.
. At least it’s about sex. Who cares about a bunch of antisocial adolescents? That’s exactly what he’s trying to escape from. And when he can’t stand another minute of irrelevant fiction—
Sherlock's stomach contracts horrified. He would like to let her know that he is involved in solving a case and that he usually does not eat when he works, as digestion slows him down. Something tells him, however, that it is better not to start arguing with this woman.
There is a laceration at the hairline above the right temple.
<< They are things that are part of the past. They hurt me, of course, but they are gone and I am able to manage them >>.
John lets him go and, with surprise, Hataway touches the ground from which he had been separated by an abundant number of centimeters. The detective adjusts his jacket, by looking up at John, who hasn't looked away from his face for a moment.
<< I ... I do not understand why they should throw me out for my father's job. It is a self-help portal >>.
<< You said, before, that the Ford opened to their kidnapper, who knew him >> says John.
<< The partners would claim your head, as if you had been the author of the crime >>.
and he was close to killing me too >>.
Oh god,
<< I see it increasingly difficult to find those two alive >> sighs Greg, rubbing his tired face. << Sharon Milton didn't ask for ransom.She didn't give any communication. She took Mr and Ms Ford for the sheer pleasure of killing them and I would like to understand why >> says Greg.
and our hope, hello.
<< You will take it to the vet >>.
<< I am not as good as you, but my school fellows leave me alone the same >> confesses the child, grasping the profound meaning of what Sherlock said. << They say pirates are an boring and you are a publicity stunt. Silver liked both playing pirates and investigations >>. Another tear rolls down William's eyes and Morgan licks it off. << Dogs like tears, Mr. Holmes? Because even Silver always licked them >>.
<< What? >> asks Sherlock, incredulous in front of such unexpected fury.
<< Molly? >>.
The presence of this version of Mary alerted him at the beginning. Over time, however, and with the succession of sudden awakenings, Sherlock got used to her, to her smiles, to her cares, that reassured him a lot. He told her his dreams feeling the need to speak and Mary listened to him kidnapped, like a little girl listening to a fairy tale before going to sleep. Except that Sherlock's stories are not fairy tales. Those dreams are shreds of his childhood. The brutality of his father. The death of his mother. The absence continues of his brother and his way to made fun of him. Bullying suffered at school.
John would like to tell him that he could take the dish of the day and go to the hell, but in the end he gives up and nods disconsolate. At his feet the puppy gnaws blissfully enjoying his dinner too.
<< Listen to me >>, John growls, holding the man against the trunk of the tree, << I do not know how you behaves with friends, assuming you has someone, but I usually do not lose hope until I see the corps's lifeless with my own eyes! I fathomed the Afghan desert and the cities ruined by bombs in search of my fellow soldiers, when I was at war, and I never lost hope of finding them alive until, unfortunately, I found the opposite. I have rescued many, thanks to my lack of ability to resign myself to what that for you is an evidence! So now you'll do me the favor of stopping to break my balls and let me find my friend. And if you don't want to waste your breath and men to help me, go away with all your entourage. I am able to manage alone here >>.
<< Did you give him a name? >> John asks. The living plush runs back to him in search of cuddles.
John starts to shake the woman who, however, wakes up on her own. She looks at him with different eyes, more sincere and young, like those of a little girl.
<< You also have some human weakness, then >>.
<< Forgive me, Mary >> Sherlcok says in a choked voice. << Forgive me for what I have done. I repent. I regret everything! >>.
<< We are in a sauna, Sherlock >> Greg replies.
John and Sherlock exchange another look, both new to a similar situation.
John does not like the desert 221B at all. He leaves the suitcase in front of the door and goes to Sherlock's room to find out if his is a short exit or if his flatmate decided to leave for a few days.
"Yeah, because you always know everything, don't you, John?" replies Sherlock, annoyed by that intrusion.
<< We were very good >> says the woman, who claps her hands happily chirps.
<< I prefer to make sure that those who come to bring the lunch do not try to jump on you again >>.
<< Is this the problem, John? Does it bother you that I shared my bed with a man? >> Sherlock provokes him with the look and the tone he usually devotes to people he considers idiots, before going back to writing a message. John can't stand the little consideration he gives him by breaking it up with the constant messages he reads and sends. Driven by anger, John grabs the wrist of Sherlock's right hand in which he holds the cell phone and squeezes it with his small but strong hand.
<< He was too involved >> Sherlock replies souring, as he usually does when he feels uncomfortable.
<< Who is this? >>. John raises his head to meet Greg's astonished gaze. The detective's eyes go from the frightened puppy to the doctor, trying to understand how the two elements can be connected.
<< Is Lizzy safe, Sherlock? >> Greg asks him, his voice broken by emotion.
The bell rings and Lestrade's fast steps announce his arrival. He knocks on the door before entering and John sees him looking at them in amazement at finding them so close.
<< Really? >> Greg asks, amazed. << Sherlock ... are you sure you don't have to update me on the investigations you are conducting? >> Greg asks him, by crossing his arms over his chest.
There was a note of pride in John's soul for having been the architect of Sherlock's state of bliss. There was, however, also a bigger slice of sense of responsibility for that happiness. John would have to bear the weight, do his utmost to maintain it and above all give himself permission to live it in turn. Too many things all together and all fantastic. No, it couldn't really be for him. It would have been an idyll that would have died out, as had happened so many times before. Only this time John didn't even want to try, because the person who was sleeping blissfully over the sofa was not like everyone else. That person wa intelligent, fragile and John did not want to risk destroying everything after some time with some escapade or with the usual wrong joke or questionable behavior. So, he tought that was better to destroy it immediately.
<< Why he didn't tell you anything? >> he asks and John feels his cheeks turn red.
<< As you prefer >> retorts Greg. He calls his men. The chief of the scientific session murmurs something bad against the consultant and, in particular, his dog.
<< So I leave you alone for two days on a case and you turn it into the plot of a James Bond film, complete with an investigative journalist, quick-witted, accustomed to being on the front line and with a skill in disguises like Diabolik >>.
The sauna master invites everyone to sit around the swimming pool. At the center of this, on three lifebuoy platforms, the bells of different sizes were positioned. On as many platforms three figures wrapped in long cassocks are seated with crossed legs.
<< Okay, but few. He is still a puppy and it is not good for him to eat too much food other than his >>.
<< Because the first time a journalist photographed him he wore it to try to disguise himself. He thinks that a  consultanting detective should not have a public image. It would compromise his job >> John explains to her, aware that she will not understand anything of what he said. In fact, the woman stares at him in astonishment. The doctor, however, realizes that he does not feel any remorse for using words that are too complicated for this woman with evident mental retardation.
<< Why? Do you think you can be immune? >> Greg asks. << No, because if you really are, tell me where you got vaccinated that I run to do it >> adds ironic. Mycroft smiles and seems pleased with Greg's jokes than annoyed, as John usually sees him in front of the manifestation of human idiocy.
<< It wasn't just women, Greg. Sherlock was not the first! >>.
Oh clement,
<< A shame >> John sighs snatching a laugh at Sherlock.
<< Wake up, Sherlock >> John whispers taking Sherlock's hand in his. << Do you want me to go? It is for that reason that do you insist on staying asleep? I can also do it. Yes, I will do it as soon as your brother returns. Maybe his presence is more pleasing to you than mine, at the moment >> he says realizing himself that he is carrying out a completely senseless reasoning.
<< Of course, of course, I respect her! >> he says quickly. << I asked her to marry me before leaving >>.
An even more acute cry than the previous ones startles the consultant. Slowly Sherlock continue his walk. Go through the gate, crawling through the space that is already open. He doesn't want to move it. He can't stand his screeching squeak.
That unexpectedly sad speech makes John uncomfortable. The doctor lies down next to Sherlock, placing his head on the pillow. He caresses the muzzle of the puppy, already deeply asleep, barely touching Sherlock's long fingers.
<< Do not make me come to get you. You may not like it >> she says and a note of anger dirty the fake sweetness. Furious, Sharon opens the closet doors and Morgan leaps to her face .
<< I can't stand rapists. I have seen too many in war >> he answers with a half lie and a half truth.
<< No, I've never prostituting miself. Not even when it would have been convenient for me to be >> whispers, staring at the inert cocoon.
<< Dogs' skin is very hard. I don't think my cold hands bother him >> Sherlock says nervously. John caresses Sherlock's fingers, the back of his hand, the hollow of the wrist.
<< No, Mary, wait >> stops her, leaving her speechless. << It's about to end, isn't it? >>.
<< Oh >> Sherlock whispers. << Sorry. I hoped they didn't say the same to you >>.
<< It is possible, yes >> Sherlock replies, stroking the instrument. He feels the woman's gaze on himself, but discovers that it no longer disturbs him as a few days before. The hands are numb and distant, as if they were no longer his. To be honest, Sherlock perceives this sensation throughout the body. He barely notices Mary's quick snap, sprung to his feet like a spring.
"Oh yes, finally some vitality! It's for something I said, isn't it? Something that has nothing to do with our Johnny-boy! "
<< It mean that nobody is behind the wheel>> replies one of them.
<< Already done >> Sherlock mumbles. << I did a quick search and went to a doctor with an excellent reputation. The vet said that he has two months. About the breed he told me that it would be a very interesting case for me to discover it >> Sherlock chuckles and John, more and more amazed, joins the laugh. << Do you know to take a dog for a walk? >>.
<< No, he's my tutor >> she says and the crying makes it difficult for her to continue the story.
The girl looks at him in amazement and just nods.
It cannot be a coincidence. John cannot be stumbled upon by chance in two intimate moments of his flatmate with strangers. It must be, as he has already assumed, a regular situation.
<< Do you play the violin? >> exclaims Mary with a big smile on her lips. Sherlock nods. << Wait here >> she says, abruptly removing her hands from Sherlock's face. The attempt to hold her back is worthless. Mary gets rid of him easily despite his grip was strong.
<< Maybe I made a little too many in my machine >>.
<< Because we don't have his eyes, John >> says Greg, pointing Sherlock. << In these last two cases the drawing was clearly visible. One even engraved on the skin. In the others, however, it did not immediately catch the eye >>.
<< I thought that something hot would do you good >> he says, handing the cup to him.
<< Tell me the password >> says a small little voice that tries to make itself feel safe.
Chapter 7
<< Cardiac arrest, therefore, occurred following an attack >>.
<< Those are just helping you kill yourself! The last time was not enough ... >>.
A bell rings, announcing the beginning of this magical moment of the evening. Before entering the pool with the others, Sherlock sees Martin smiling blissfully from afar. Sherlock smiles in turn, venturing a wink to which the man replies by blowing a kiss.
"It seems that things have gone sooo bad for you, my dear consultant," Moriarty chuckles in Sherlock's head. He ignore him. Sherlock look for a more comfortable position and a handle to hang the IV bags.
Sherlock hears the two sides of himselve talking to each other. The one who tries to find a way to persuade the woman to replace the IV, arguing the choice with the possibility of being lucid and able to respond to it in order to avoid incurring other punishments. The other who, instead, tries to convince him to resist, reminding him how the physical effects of the crisis pass faster if the hiring is recent. Then only the pain in the leg would remain, but that would manage to manage it by isolating it in a room of his Mind Palace, as he regularly does for the headache or for all the bruises that he finds himself after every case that requires active action.
<< You really like this dog, huh? >>.
John was in shock, in a decidedly altered state of consciousness. Yet he still has the feeling under his hands, which he now closes into a fist. Sherlock's cold body. Frozen. The soft beat of his heart, so difficult to perceive. John had stripped himself of the layers of jackets, sweaters, shirts he was wearing and had held Sherlock close to him, wrapping him in his warm clothes. A body close to frostbite needs the heat of another warm and alive body to recover. At the beginning it seemed to John that he was holding a now cold and rigid corpse in his arms. The lifeless bodies of some of his fellow soldiers, that of his mother, that of his father, had come back to Jonh's minde. He had had to make an effort to think that the cold body he was trying to warm up was alive.
<< I ruined your reputation >> Sherlock whispers.
<< The same that in the case of diamond thieves, allowed us to find the lair of the thief in half the time we would have used with more traditional methods >>.
Mycroft's voice had not yet revealed himself in his mind. He does not like to hear him speculate both these terrible possibilities.
<< Are you sure you are well? >> John asks him worried.
<< What can happen between two people who have gone too far in drinking >>.
Yes, because does not take much to say that the consultant would have tried to seduce the doctor, not the other way around. Sherlock is the 'crazy' one, the freak; not John, the brave soldier. John, who would have guaranteed himself the dose of adrenaline and danger and the occasional fuck without even having to go looking for it around. And Sherlock, poor fool, would have begged his attentions, hoped for his avances and would have deluded himself that that could be love.
<< Oh my God, I don't even imagine him in a Ski Club >>.
<< It is a delicate body area >>.
John realizes that I has just admitted to having used Sherlock in front of the man who moves seas and mountains to protect him. If he was in the shoes of Mycroft, he punch himself for the offense to his protégé. Mycroft, on the other hand, just sighs. A long, slow sigh.
<< Promise me you don't do anything until I'm back >>.
She shivers now at this umpteenth deduction.
<< Don't you feel well? >> asks a man unexpectedly too close to him.
<< When I'm sad I make a nice chocolate cake with lots of cream to cheer me up. I'd say you need one, how about, Ed? >> asks him and Sherlock struggles to keep up with her. He gives her an indifferent look
<< But don't think so. Neither do I >>.
<< Thank you >> he smiles, stamps the badge and disappears beyond the door. John walks to the tube, with one hand on the hip and the doubt of having to start worrying about these sudden pains.
<< A friend told me that Daisy couldn't stand Rosaline. In fact, with the excuse of being the master's pupil, she was doing enough >>.
John then went on to evaluate who could have helped Sherlock or where he could have gone to, in case he was able to walk on his legs. There were only four houses in the area and none in the immediate vicinity. Certainly reachable by a man in full physical strength even at that time, but by the condition of the passenger compartment and the amount of blood found inside the car, Sherlock seemed to be in bad conditions.
<< I mean really >> Sherlock adds seriously caressing his face.
He would have liked to put his usual acidity into those words, which, however, came out weak and broken by emotion.John nods without being able to say anything.
"Stop saying bullshit!"
<< He can't stand it >> retorts John, who feels the annoyance getting more and more.
<< Yes I believe it, Albert! You confirmed it to me when you told Sharon that you didn't give a damn if she even shot me in the head. The great Albert Ford does not bow down to anyone. You  disgusted her so bad that even in her madness she couldn't help hitting yourself with her baseball bat. Not to mention the kick the she gave you when she told us what she intended to do to William and you  told her what you thought about her plan. Oh god, I hope it really hurt you and also caused some permanent damage, because you deserve it, oh, yes you deserve it. You are not worthy of being a father! And now go back to safety on the arms of your members, if you don't want that I give you a kick stronger than her >>.
<< Let me put the assholes who tried to push my daughter to suicide into jail and then I'll tell you some anecdote. Maybe you will understand many things and maybe you will stop beating yourself! >> exclaims Greg. <<  Shame on you, Sherlock! >> points the finger against Sherlock. << You don't put a friend aside just because another comes from the past >>.
<< I'm very serious >> Sherlock says, with a hiccup. Clear sign of drunkenness, if it really need to find the signs. John laughs loudly and Sherlock pouts offended. << Are you laughing at me, John Watson? >> he asks. Sherlock raise his pelvis, levering on the wrists locked by the soldier and tries to bring his knees back to his chest in order to kick John away. With all-natural movements the doctor insinuates himself between those long legs and locking Sherlock down.
<< Greg and I did it! >> retorts John.
<< Yes >> John nods. << She are not the serial killer. I don't know, however, how much the murder of the brothers and the mother will be able to change her punishment >>.
<< Why did that girl commit suicide? >>.
<< I'm sorry that things didn't go well, Mr. Holmes >> says the director, visibly proven by what he heard.
<< Let's say that the gentleman, there, behaved in a very less civilized way >> John growls and Greg looks seriously at him first, then Sherlock's face and finally John’s bloody hands.
<< You too >> whispers Sherlock and his hand rises slowly to caress John hair darkened by the hair lotion.
<< That long story >> says John after taking a refreshing sip. << I would say that the time has come to tell me >>.
John mechanically nods to the inspector's words. The hands of this woman, huge and full of calluses, totally capture him. She leaves the shop just as Hataway scrambles the last pin on the fourth corner of the poster.
<< Are you sure? >>.
<< You don't risk forced labor anymore, John >> Greg sais. << Do you want to tell me that Sherlock is completely indifferent for you? >>.
John stands up and offers Sherlock his hand to help him. Sherlock clings to John’s hand with all his might and lets himself be pulled up. Yet another dizziness catches him and John tries to support him.
John feels his face flare up and is happy that Sherlock immediately headed for the door, missing the red explosion on his face. He follows him silently and in silence they remain all the way.
<< As would anyone in my place >> burst nervously.
John would like to tell Greg many things, but he just lowers his head, by imitating the greeting he gives him before leaving the police station.
<< Sherlock. His name is Sherlock Holmes >> he punctuates. Greg's hand rest on John's left shoulder and squeeze it. Greg's  hand causes to John a twinge of pain, sinking his fingers right into the old war wound, but manages to distract him from the desire to fill the woman with insults. The fact that she starts laughing again like a little girl, doesn't help his good friend's attempts at all.
John turns his gaze to Sherlock, who has assisted from his armchair while remaining perfectly still. He nods with a smile and the doctor realizes that he has done his job well.
<< I ask you to forgive me for what I said. I have not been informed that you are not kidnapped with your parents. I am happy that you are safe. I will do my best so that everyone will give their best to bring your parents home, I want this to be clear to you >>.
<< Could be that he was thrown out? >> asks Greg.
<< I don't doubt it's excellent, but only the smell makes me sick >>.
Sherlock nods and rubs his tired face with his hand.
<< I agree with you, Fox >> says Greg peremptorily. << You have been exceptional, but it can become dangerous and I don't want to worry about you, ok? >>. George snorts, but nods, agreeing to return to his mother in the company of his sister.
John holds his gaze and, staying on his knees one step away from him, helps him breathe.John can't believe this panic attack was caused by him. It could be the result of a pressure drop, but he is not sure. The bathrobe that Sherlock wears has opened and highlights the chest and left arm with which he supports himself. Attention is captured by the bruises. Not yet purplish but already well present.
<< Come back to dad >> John says, entering the room slowly. Sherlock sleeps face down, his head under the pillow and the sheet to cover him from the waist down. He seems to be naked, which causes a heat bubble to explode in John's belly. John puts the puppy on the pillow over the floor, but he jumps on the bed.
When John heard Sherlock muttering in his sleep, sniffing the imminent awakening, he stood up and stood looking at him. He would have liked to come closer to him, caress his hair and face and put a kiss on those lips that he had tormented with pleasure. Instead John staied far from doing anything. He remained motionless, his fists clenched, and when Sherlock's eyes opened and met his, when Sherlock gave him that beautiful serene smile, John sincerely faltered. That 'I love you' pronounced by Sherlock, invaded John's mind, clenched his stomach and shook his body with shivers of fear.
Different points of view, of course, that made the difference between the family of benefactors and that of mad assassins. Ruthless killers who had no problem throwing a man still alive, even if exhausted, into a pit, letting the cold, hunger and hardships put an end to his existence.
<< But if you just said you didn't have anyone waiting for you in London, except this flatmate! >> she says, saying the last word with disgust.
<< Instead you quarreled >> Greg resumes breaking the silence.
<< I really like you too >> reply Sherlock sleepy slurred. John blinks several times and looks at Sherlock, fallen again into the arms of Morpheus. One of his hand outstretched towards the puppy, standing next to him, the other hand abandoned on the pale belly, moving at the slow rhythm of his breathing. John has never seen before Sherlock's face so relaxed,
The detective pales more and more as the story goes on. His eyes become large with amazement and he often shakes his head in disbelief, glancing at his son. When John finishes his piece, Greg brings both hands to cover his face and holds them there for a long moment, breathing slowly.
<< I am sure, my dear doctor, that you have the answer to this question within you, a bit like how you had these details of the  jailer of my brother. I don't want to know anything else about what happened between you and Sherlock. If it's true, though, that you let him know you used him, well, then I'm afraid you lost him, John. I wonder why you have to put such an idea into Sherlock's head if this is not true. I wonder why you ordinary human beings have to be so damn idiotic! >> Mycroft snaps, hitting the palm of his left hand with his right fist. John has never seen Mycroft so angry, even in moments of greater discussion with his brother. << Self-esteem problems. Your ex-therapist was bad, but she caught you in this. You have ruined not only your life, but that of another man, whom you also care about, only for your damned self-esteem problems >>. Mycroft sighs and tries to calm himself down. He shakes his head several times. << I'm sorry. Really. He didn't deserve it. He has already gone through so many >>.
Greg weigh every single word and now looks at John with the same compassionate look that is given to the desperate relatives of a kidnapping victim. John would gladly jump to Greg's throat, but, after all, he knows that his detective friend is just trying to make him reason.
<< Yes, I have them >> he replies decidedly. << Why did you allow your friends to take me to the pub? Why, if you knew that they would end up making me drink and embarrass me? That Bryan ... I had his hands all over, but you didn't lift a finger. How can I think that you care about me, that it wasn't really an adventure driven by alcohol? >> Sherlock says all in one breath, now feeling the urgent need for clarification. John moistens his lips and shifts the weight from one foot to the other, nervous.
<< She is older than you, isn't she? >> asks John.
<< These signs on the carpet >> says Mycroft, pointing to the steps of the stairs. John does not listen further and follows what the consulting detective's brother indicated. He hardly hears the woman asking the inspector why the two Londoners are taking similar liberties in her home. Hataway leaving her to his men (he has carried almost all the command) for follow them upstairs.
"You got into a lot of trouble, Johnny!" Harriet tells him in his head and John feels all the embarrassment of the world collapsing on his shoulders.
Mary enter in the room with her expressionless face and the 'parrot', the tool that Sherlock has always found abominable and has always refused to use in his previous hospital admissions. Rather than inserting the penis into the hard plastic entrance of that sort of chamber pot, he preferred to haven't it on. Thanks to Mary Sherlock definitely had to change his mind about it.
<< This is the landfill of a serial killer >> Sherlock replies, recovering with difficulty from the last retch.
<< I couldn't verify why this gentleman forced me to go to the kitchen >> William says pointing to Greg.
, don't you know?" The consulting criminal, sneaking into Sherlock mind, laughed. Sherlock also joined in that meaningless laugh, surprise by Moriarty's presence.
Greg takes the pager out of his pocket and checks it. << I have to go. I'll wait for you at the Cooper house, Sherlock, okay? >> he says, reaching the door. The consultant nods and with a gesture from the chief the detective greets and descends the stairs. As soon as the door is closed, Sherlock leaps to his feet and starts pacing back and forth across the living room, his hands clasped under his chin.
“You probably
“It appears that everyone except your brother and a woman in the second row… and the flight attendant—Molly, is dead. I don’t know what the situation is in the main cabin or first class.
“For what, Sir?”
“Lobster risotto.”
God, it had been fifteen years, but the feelings felt fresh. Raw. He’d never forgotten what had happened. He’d never forgotten Will. And he had never recaptured the magic and wonder of that summer with anyone else, not even Mary.
“Yes. Do people hassle you? Because you’re gay. You are gay, right? Sir?"
“Moriarty?”
“Oh, all right,” he muttered.
MH:       Good. Thank you so much!!!!!!! <3 <3
“I can’t wait. It turns out I still need that money, I want you to go see him. Make sure he’s committed. I don’t want him pulling out at the last minute like last time. Up until now, he’s been dependable, but if I really have to cut him loose, I’ll need your help to find another buyer. I’ll set up the meeting.”
“Didn’t think so. Can’t say I’ve ever met one of your kind before.”
Sherlock soaks up the information with complete attention, and stores away the stunning Harvey Milk data for later. John's eyes sparkle and he's grinning from ear to ear, clearly delighted by Sherlock's interest.
“OK, that wasn’t even a little bit funny. I don’t know if I can do it all at once. Give up everything at the same time.”
“What can I get you?”
“So, Lestrade thinks it’s the research assistant,” John said. "Makes sense, I mean Carey must have known or at least not been afraid of his killer, right? Otherwise, why the two glasses? Any idea of what they were arguing about?"
John nods also. “Well, for the moment, you’ve punished yourself better than I could have. Finish your breakfast, all the juice, and get yourself cleaned up. I’ll be waiting for you.”
John stands, and when Sherlock sees that he has the crop in his hand, he inhales sharply.
“Christ, Sherlock.”
“Pretty, isn’t it?” John remarks.
John throws him onto the bed and he bounces.
Seeing the logic in this, Sherlock bites his lips and stays silent while John resumes his work
“Spread your legs and put your hands against the glass.”
As if reading his mind, John says, “Touch yourself.” He slows his onslaught and pulls almost all the way out before sinking in again, taking his time as Sherlock removes his hand from the headboard and closes it around his erection.
He sighs and pulls out his phone. John had said “one of your friends” like there were dozens of them he could choose from. When he looks at his contact list, there are exactly five numbers in it: John, Mycroft, Molly, Ms. Hudson, and Wiggy.
“You’ll be working for me while you’re here,” Jim says with an air of superiority. "Usually, these jobs are reserved for University students. You two must be ‘special’,” he makes air quotes with his fingers.
John quickly surveyed their surroundings. They had just emerged from the underground compound into a clearing surrounded by thick woods. The night sky was cloudless, and a thousand stars decorated the heavens above them. It would have been beautiful to behold under different circumstances. Searching for some clue to where they were, John listened intently. There were birds and crickets, and the soft rustling of foliage moved by the breeze, but no other sounds. John drew in a lungful of the gloriously fresh air. It smelled of the ocean, although he couldn’t hear any water. So perhaps they
“Thank you,” Sherlock whispers.
“Any suspects?”
“Come. Come. The suit. I think it’s finished! It’s waiting for you.” Mr. Greenfield walks him toward the back.
Sherlock blushes, and John offers the handkerchief. Sherlock takes it and rubs the back of his neck, looking down at the floor. “Justs—so many—girls!” he says as if that explains everything. John can’t hold it in any longer and laughs out loud. Sherlock looks up and smiles back at him, then laughs himself. “I’m just going to keep this, cuz you won’t want it back now.”
“I’ll get on it tomorrow.”
“Did you find what you were searching for?”
“No, Sherlock, not this particular one. I had it made just for you.”
“B—But he killed her!”
Taking it from the drawer, he hands it to John.
John removes the crop. “What I’m doing feels good, right?”
“I didn’t figure you for
“Where is Jim?” Molly says eagerly, and Sherlock rolls his eyes.
“I know. I just was so scared. I’m sorry.”
The pain seems distant as he focuses on the sensation of John’s skin against his, from his lips all the way down to his knees. It is everything, and at the same time, not nearly enough. He is straddling one of John’s legs and begins to rub himself against his hip, moaning into John’s mouth. John’s hand is tracing his spine, while the other is buried in his hair, holding him in the kiss. When John’s hand roams lower and skims over his ass, Sherlock squirms, trying to escape the friction that reheats the tender skin and increasing the pressure on his swollen cock. Every part of him feels electric and alive, and he is so lost in his own want that he is almost surprised when he feels John’s erection against his hip.
Sherlock groans and rolls his hips forward, fingers closing on fistfuls of short hair. Heat and tension gather low in his belly, and when John flattens his tongue and presses it against him in just the right spot,
But that little wanker could probably wheedle him into it.
Moriarty frowned, and his dark eyes flashed with anger. The two men glowered at one another. The room was utterly silent as the hostages, the guards and Mycroft Holmes watched the stare-down with morbid fascination.
So Sherlock does it again. And again. It’s not bad, not at all. And John is groaning and has reached back to spread himself. Sherlock dips down, licking the delicate skin of John’s balls before moving upwards again and circling the pucker with his tongue.
They are a few miles outside of Columbus when he’s finally able to reach Myc.
“Fuck!” Sherlock practically shouts.
Sherlock realizes he must have turned the alarm off without even waking, which is something that hasn’t happened since the awful days after—
GL:   You are something else, Sherlock.
John bends his head and bites down firmly on the muscle between his neck and shoulder, and the sensation and possessiveness of the act combine to push Sherlock over the edge, into an orgasm that has him shooting long streams of white into the froth of bubbles still floating on the surface of the water. He moans and thrusts until he is completely spent and collapses back against John’s chest. John cradles him and holds his cock gently until the last of the tremors have passed.
“Bend over,” John commands sternly.
Here are some links with more information on sub drop.
“Sherlock. Open the door.” John raps sharply on Sherlock’s bedroom door.
“Yes, Sir.”
The first thing that Sherlock became aware of was the cold. It seemed to permeate his body to his very bones. He shivered. The next thing was the pain. He tried to identify its separate sources, his head, his back, his hand, but they all blended into one massive whole-body agony. He tried to open his eyes. Only one opened; the other remained stubbornly closed. The one that opened saw only darkness. Disoriented, he tried to remember where he was. In the cell? Or had that all been a dream? Maybe the plane had crashed? Is that why he hurt so bad? And what had happened to John? And Eurus? No. That couldn’t be right. He was mixing things up. Eurus was dead. Long ago dead.
SH:    Haven’t heard from you re graduation. Any idea?
Sherlock woke up early and printed his essay. Since he was already up, he made John breakfast: scrambled eggs with cheese, toast, and a slice of cantaloupe. He’d left the essay beside John’s plate and is now sitting across from his seat, sipping his coffee and waiting anxiously.
“Oh, god, Sherlock, I’m sorry. I’m not sure what to say. You must be so disappointed.”
“You know there are such things as headphones,” John said, annoyed.
“I thought so, but he hasn’t come for me. So it’s probably over.”
Sherlock pulled his hand away.
“I’d like that, Sir.”
JW:  2
“I was…lost in thought, I guess.”
Sullenly, Sherlock placed the tablet in his mouth and washed it down with water from the plastic cup they had taken from the bathroom.
<< In what? >>.
holding the 'parrot' at eye level and the tremor that shakes her body does not promise anything good.
<< Because it wasn't just an adventure for me, Greg! >> he blurts out, standing up, leaving the detective with his mouth open for the third time. << I am also ... in love with him >> whispers, bringing a hand to his mouth, as to keep hidden a secret too big even to pronounce. << That ... wow, it was already crazy what had happened. Hearing him say those words ... seeing him so serene and at peace ... it was too much. Too much for me. I ... I felt I didn't deserve it and ... >>.
<< I am sure the inspector will be happy to know that you flown down the cliff along with your uncomfortable deductions >>.
<< This tutor is not an adult, nor a psychologist or a similar professional >> Sherlock continues in Lizzy place. << Fenix hides behind the facade of wanting to teach young the importance of self-help. After a first period of listening and having invited them to public seminars, this tutor tells the new member that they has the requisites to be able to become tutors in turn and help other peers in difficulty. He deceives them with promises of success and social recognition and starts inviting them to private events held by adults who say they are professionals. Only after other tests and further selection do they get the degree of tutor and start the race to get more and more new members. It is the task of the tutors to make the site and its benefits known and it is always their task to eliminate those who leave the portal rules. That's what's happening to you, isn't Lizzy so? >>
<< I have no idea. The airbag has exploded, but the car door is closed >> the man reply.
<< From good to better >> sighs Greg, caressing his own shaggy beard. << Why did you tell me to send a team to Milton Keynes? What did you find out from the footprints? >> Greg asks and the consultant hands him a package of documents.
<< Do you think that I am an alcoholic, Mycroft? >> asks john, between teeth.
<< Of course, she has committed murders and has to pay, but one thing is to have killed five people, guilty of murdering 35 and used all kinds of violence against her, another to be accused of the complete package, Mycroft! >>.
<< The place where we are >>.
<< It seemed to me that you too had stopped with that stuff >> John says, looking at him wrong. Sherlock hands him the cigarette.
The receptionist gives him the keys and the brochure with the services offered by the Spa, the menu provided for the day and the times for breakfast, lunch and dinner.They take the lift to the fourth floor, the one reserved for the suites. The 'Blue Ocean' has walls blue and a white ceiling. It is furnished like an ancient ship, with many marine-themed furnishings.
John also has no memory how he got to West Cumberland Hospital. Just remember that from the moment the aircraft left, Mycroft's hand never lifted off his shoulder.
<< We can try >> says Mycroft, settling on the bed that Greg had occupied. << Please >> invites him to sit on the other bed in front of him. John feeling a little tense. << Go back to the moment when you met that woman and observe her. What strikes you about her? Say all that you find yourself in front of the mind's eyes, without excluding anything >>.
<< Are you okay? >>.
<< You took care of your sister. You did what I should have done. Thank you, George >> he says, bringing his hand to George's hairless cheek, caressing it with the fear of almost breaking him.
<< If it's a problem, Sara, we can talk about it >> retorts acid. Too acidic.
<< They are not men! >> he exclaims loudly, then bringing both hands to his mouth. The breath stops for a long moment.
<< Apparently Sherlock received a phone call on Wednesday 9th late in the morning. A number whose area code appears to be from the Cumbria region. It belongs to Hugh Paddington,  the owner of the Lake District Ski Club >>.
<< Two days have passed! >> the woman growls, worryingly shaking the 'parrot'.
<< You thought them all, huh? >> Greg nods in admiration.
"You say?" James asks, watching him and John as they exchange now sweeter and slower kisses. “I think he would have done it anyway. He just wanted to fuck you and he did. Also good as far as I see. What do you care about something as human and useless as love? " Moriarty asks horrified. “You know what this brings. Only death and destruction. Love is only a problem. "
<< Oh Lord! Then it was my fault? >> Lizzy asks, the eyes already full of tears. John and Greg glare at the consultant, who realizes too late that he has perhaps spoken too directly.
<< Nothing that could bring him to disappear, Mycroft! >> he says.
"Really? Look where we ended up, ”says Moriarty, sitting comfortably on his belly.
<< We don't have much time and I would like to postpone the presentations, if you don't mind! >> says the man, gently but firmly. << We have identified where the Masters of the seminars that were held here in London are >> he says, placing himself between John's armchair and the chair on which Lizzy is sitting. The girl looks at him as if she was hypnotized << Greg, I recommend you to send a patrol at these addresses >> he says, giving him a ticket. << The charges are of solicitation, corruption of a minor, exchange of pedopornography, incitement to pedoprostitution, prostitution and suicide >>.
<< It is a plausible hypothesis that must however be confirmed >> Sherlock says, bringing his hands together under the chin. << The cook said that your mother has a studio here at home >>.
John doesn't believe what he's just heard. Would this man be the same guy he saw in the alley with Sherlock? He was certainly dressed in black, as he is now, but the one he is now wearing is reminiscent of the uniform of one of the army special bodies, one of those sent to perform missions that are not entirely lawful. A red logo stands out on Fox's left shoulder: the stylized muzzle of a fox wrapped in a flame-like tail. John rolls his eyes and lets out a snort. It is the same logo that he saw on the body of the guitar played by the boy he found at home with Sherlock. John turns his gaze to his flatmate, who was keeping an eye on him from before. Sherlock's  lips are curl up to shape a smile and he nods at his silent question.
<< Ok, Greg >> John intervenes, keeping his hand on his partner's shoulder. << Not a word, Sherlock >> adds John when Lestrade walks away.
<< Don't waste your breath on him, John >> advises him the consultant. << Giles, here is the address of this woman. I don't think I have to tell you what to do now. If the chief does not trust my dog's nose, you can get everyone else to contact and send someone to do the inspections. Of course, you will waste a lot of time, but if it is for the sake of traditional methods ... >>.
Silence falls over the doctor's whispered words. Sherlock doesn't know what to argue. He doesn't know whether to argue.
The woman wakes up and with quick gestures moves to the passenger side door and seems to be looking for something inside the passenger compartment. She throws Sherlock a blanket and without deigning him a glance, she closes the side door.
<< Mold >> notes by observing the ceilings adorned with green blooms so large as to peel off the plaster.
The man leaves the room at the same time as the cell phone notifies John of the arrival of a message. John remains motionless, as if he had heard the click from a weapon aimed at him. John approaches the phone uncertainly and looks at it for a long time before picking it up. A message from Sherlock and the stomach contracts.
<< I ran into it yesterday, while I was working on the Jackson case >> Sherlock says, glancing at John. John looks at him incredulously. He was more than convinced that Sherlock hadn't taken a step on that investigation and now he can't help he look idiotic. He look away embarrassed.
<< We were just talking >> Mycroft replies.
<< The snowplows have arrived where Mr Holmes' car was found. They estimate they are from Abbott in three hours >>.
"Oh, Sherlock. The pain is always felt, but it mustn't scare you” Moriarty chuckles. "Going back to more serious things," he says, leaping over one of the corpses. "Yup. I confirm that this is not the work of any of my clients. So, whose are we admiring the deeds? ".
John also thinks their landlady's attitude is strange. In reality there is no one thing that is not strange related to this case. They are all crying over the death of the woman who almost killed Sherlock. Perhaps the only sane is Mycroft. Or maybe he's the only one whose empathy works as a switch capable of turning on only for some people and not for others.
<< Yes, I solved it >> nods Sherlock.
<< So what are you going to do?  You want to isolate yourself, stop your work and retire to a deserted island where you won't be able to ... harm anyone? >>.
<< Of course, it's obvious >> Sherlock replies, annoyed.
<< No >> Sherlock admits. << It's not the effect of the beer. Drink much beer it is not a problem for you >>.
<< What do you think? >> He gives John the phone, without looking him in the face.
<< I repeat that I don't see what the problem >>.
John takes Sherlock, now visibly tired, by the hand and follows the director. The horde of men standing by waiting ranting against them and someone launches some insult to their hands clasped into each other. Their hands that remain united throughout the silent return to the room and divide when John forces Sherlock to sit on the bed.
Sherlock retrieves the bathrobe and puts it on and this sponge hug comforts him. Dizziness is passing. Now he can keep his eyes open for a few moments. Slowly he gets back on his feet. Sherlock realizes he is in the locker room, but does not understand how he got there. Staggering, Sherlock goes to the door and leaves. He reaches the exit from the Spa while the participants in the Aufguss leave the sauna behind him.
John thinks about it. Interesting and uncomfortable question to which he does not want to answer.
<< It happened again >> says the consultant, arching just an eyebrow. Greg nods and John feels his stomach close.
<< My colleague that passed away? >>.
Sherlock turns his gaze to the photos still open on the PC. John approaches him by placing a hand on his back.
<< Hi Billy >> she greets him, with a calm voice and a friendly smile on her lips.
<< Mr. Holmes, you told me that you don't know if the man found by the cleaner this morning died of natural death or not, did I understand correctly? >>.
<< What? >> John asks, breaking his silence.
<< If you were such a maniac and you saw your latest victim return to the place where he suffered your aggression, what would you think about? >>.
<< Do you want me to take you out? >> the man asks him, placing a hand on his wrist.
<< Greg, why did you decide to torture the bell? >> asks to the detective, inviting him to come in.
<< Okay, for once you should both survive. After I will teach you some things. Be careful he do not eat his own poop or that of other dogs. Remember that you have to collect the poop, there are bags attached to the leash. Be careful of the dogs you meet, if they bite him now that he is little, he could have long term behavioral damages >>.
Sherlock reflects on these words. He reflects on how much pride and honor have laid down the law between him and John. The long silences following the quarrels. They do not want to bow their heads, seeking a dialogue, a closeness. It wasn't his 'I love you' that ruined everything and not even John's crazy talk. It was the obstinate silence that followed. Sherlock decided to closing himself in the bathroom and John decided to leaving the apartment. They could have talked about it, although it seemed silly and useless to do it and, instead, they both preferred that passive aggression, the refuge of the cowards.
John wakes up screaming. He falls from the chair on which he had dozed off, finding himself on the floor.
<< Do you want to bring him with you? >> Greg asks, looking at the dog. Morgan snorts offended.
<< My friend could be trapped there! >>.
<< No! >> Sherlock exclaims. << I don't want she know what happened! Nobody needs to know, ok? >> cries and new tears fall from Sherlock's eyes and do not stop, despite his attempts.
<< Well, I would think he hasn't had enough and ... >>.
<< Did they take you a test? >> John asks, offering her some tissues.
Sherlock look at himself tremble, wrapped in the blanket that covers him from head to toe. A cocoon of a discolored pink-gray thrown into a freshly cleaned pit. He solved this case too. He does not believe, however, that he will be able to boast about it, this time.
<< Silver was not so stupid! >> shouts William. << Nobody couldn't screw him with these stupid tricks! Silver was very good with people that he knew, but he barked like crazy to strangers >>.
<< Because my dad is an idiot >> William sighs. Morgan licks the child's sad face and rubs against him, in an attempt to pull him up. This time Morgan's cuddles has no effect. << Dad never considers what mum says and he never considers what I says too.  He thinks he knows everything but it isn't the trufh. Dad has only a lot of money and many people who advise him how to move its. This makes him believe he is important >>. William cries silently, clenching his small fists. Morgan try to consolate him without succes. The puppy starts to howl and yelp in turn. John approaches the two puppies and kneels beside them.
<< My stomach is upside down, I told you >>.
Sherlock look at them, bringing a finger to his mouth.
, do you know her? >> she euphoric question.
"You're going crazy, my brother!".
“They will end sooner or later. What will you do when it happens? ".
<< I thought about you these days and I said to myself that it wouldn't hurt to call you >>.
"Oh, stop that!" shouts his sister's voice. “Why this stupid reaction? You too have brought women here in these six months. "
Chapter 3
With a quick gesture, the door is completely opened and Sherlock finds himself in front of a huge woman. She looks at him, surprised to find him awake.
<< According to my mother, however, you are an impostor and a profiteer >>.
<< So what? >>. John knew that his flatmate would not stop and that he would to have a reply from him. Sherklock would not be the infallible and brilliant consulting detective that he is, if he did not get to the bottom of everything.
<< It could have been worse, right? >>.
<< Exactly >> she smiles as if he had just shown her a trick. << Why did you call me, Eddy? What happens? >>.
<< You asked me to investigate and I need to have Rosaline's drawings to investigate, Mrs. Jackson. I can guarantee you that I will treat everything with care and that I will return it to you in perfect condition. You has my word >>.
<< Play attention. If you stay too much behind me you risk being discovered and I don't think Martin loves threesomes >>.
<< I felt replaced, Sherlock. From a professional, moreover, against which I certainly cannot compete >>.
<< Too early? >> asks him in amazement, meeting his gaze. << Why early? Do you have any commitments afterwards? >>.
<< Oh yes, it's clear >> says the child taking courage. << It is clear to me that you are one of what my father calls 'careerist asshole' >>. Sherlock laughs at the child's words, while John and Greg grin silently.
<< Sorry for what happened, Ms Jackson >> John says and she nods with a smile of circumstance.
<< It was my mother who gave it to me. It means 'man with beautiful hair' >>.
<< By sending images ... details, which are immediately placed on the pedopornography market, in the simplest of cases. By making themself available for intimate meetings with people chosen by the Masters, in the worst >>.
<< Are you listening to me? >> John insists, tapping his arm.
<< Now let's calm down everyone, ok? >> Greg thunders and although they are still shaken, both boys nod dumbfounded. Greg takes the chair reserved for customers and John brings into the living room the two chairs of the kitchen table . The three Lestrade sit one on the right, the other on the left and the father in the center.
"No, Sherlock, that's not a good thing!" John intervenes. "If you call up characters to knock you down or humiliate you even more, we won't get out."
<< Do you think she isn't? >> Mycroft asks him, approaching the bed.
<< I wouldn't leave you alone with that Fox even if someone ordered me >> John replies, making Sherlock laugh out loud. John bite Sherlock's lower lip, squeezing him even more in his arms. << Am I officially reinstated? >> John asks him, pressing the pelvis against his.
<< What do you have in mind, Sherlock? >>.
<< No, Greg, I'm wrong, sorry  >> he sighs. << It's that ... maybe a bit I feel like I have abused him. I should have stopped, I was the more sober of the two. Instead ... >>.
Mycroft's judgment has chilled him. John stood with his mouth open to watch Mycroft take a long drag on his cigarette.
Sherlock approaches the master slowly, his eyes fixed on the man's tense face.
<< No >> Sherlock replies.
"Barbarously raped," Sherlock says, looking away from the lower body. After the violence, after the punches, she was stabbed several times with the poker. The woman's glassy eyes are open, blind, looking at the ceiling. Sherlock looks at them curiously.
With a little difficulty, Sherlock pulls the violin out of its housing and plucks its strings. As he imagined it is completely without tuning. Sherlock start tuning it by plucking the strings and turning the keys. When he is satisfied, he takes the bow and spends a few minutes passing the wax over his hair. The first long sound it produces by sliding it on the strings pleasantly touches the skin. Mary exclaims an 'oh' of surprise bringing her hands to her face and Sherlock smiles at her. Sherlock give a turn of the key to the string and once again pass the bow on the strings producing a lower sound. Mary claps her hands against each other, amused. She looks at him ecstatically while playing some chords.
<< Does John have anything to do with it? >> asks him and again hits the center.
John smiles satisfied and goes to the kitchen for a well-deserved breakfast. He puts on the tea, takes his cup, the packet of biscuits from under the cupboard and places everything on the kitchen table. John leans on the sink drinking and eating standing up and looks at Sherlock absorbed in his thoughts. Although they are far apart, the first thing he finds in Sherlock are any signs that the hours of passion have left on him white skin. Strangely, John doesn't find any. Of course it doesn't mean anything, not everyone likes them or everyone doesn't doing them in clearly visible places. Someone like Sherlock, then, so attentive to detail, certainly would not tolerate such a visible brand on his immaculate skin.
They arrive at the club and reach the Mycroft office, where they close leaving the world outside.
Sherlock looks at him in amazement and John feels an unusual pleasure in being able to amaze the brilliant consulting detective. John sees Sherlock move on the chair, suddenly uncomfortable, change the crossing of the legs and risk dropping the cup perched on the armrest.
<< The tone of the threats >> says Sherlock. << Sadistic and cruel. The photos posted online of Lizzy, taken too far in time compared to when the girl signed up to the portal. Photo that comes from an external source and not from the girl's hard disk or from the images posted on her social networks >>.
<< Where you are going? >> John asks him amazed, but Sherlock doesn't answer him. He makes his way among people to find a front row seat and the doctor follow him, although he doesn't know exactly what they are going behind. John makes Sherlock way next to him, his clear eyes mesmerized by the boy's fast fingers on the guitar neck.
"I believe," continues Moriarty approaching him, "that if John, that Sunday morning, instead of with that inconsistent and demeaning speech, had welcomed your awakening with a kiss and many sweet cuddles, you would have try from the beginning to return safe and sound from him. You would certainly not be here, so helpless and disheartened, ready to die for 'love'. "
<< Too involved? >> the detective replies loudly. << Haven't you understood yet that without him you lose your compass? >>.
<< Sherlock must not be altered at all, Myc. I don't want the nurse to inject to him other sedative into his veins. Not now that he has finally woken up >> John says, smiling at him.
<< My kids >> he smiles at them. << I know that in the last period the situation has been nothing short of disastrous. I want you to know, however, that I will always there  for you, even if mom and I are no longer together. Lizzy, we'll put an end to this bad situation, I promise you. You, please, promise me that you will tell me about anything that happens to you, especially those in which you need help >>.
John shakes himself from his immobility and hurries to reach the consultant, who walks peacefully towards the large fountain in the square.
<< Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes, here they are! >> the boy shouts, standing on the chair.  William's finger pointing the screen. Sherlock walks away from John and Greg, who exchange a surprised look, and approaches the boy. << The footprints went from the fence to the kennel >> says William, sliding the really well made photos of the footprints and the place where he found them. << Then the footprints came back to the fence. I found also this on the fence >> William adds, showing a series of photos of this important detail. Sherlock watches the photos carefully. The boy stares at him, holding his breath and Morgan's lively gaze go from one to the other, curious.
<< I already told you that it wouldn't be her who killed me. Mary-child could not do it >>.
<< I can't go anywhere in these conditions, Mary >> he points out, clutching his wet bathrobe.
<< It was Fox who convinced her to desist from her intent, not me >>.
<< Your brother is right >> says Sherlock, capturing the attention of the three Lestrade. << That's their purpose, Lizzy. They want to
<< Well… Sherlock is not very expansive, let's say >>.
Sherlock arrives in front of the gate of the estate. An economy car of few pretensions, is parked out front. He cautiously approaches, while the cries carried by the wind get louder and louder.
The effect is not immediate and perhaps even worse. Sherlock seems to deflate little by little. He mumbles more and more as he loses his strength, remaining hung in the arms of the nurses. John brings his hand to his mouth, shocked by that scene. He cannot believe that that is the same man who left Baker Street. John turns, feeling the need to escape for a moment from what is happening. His eyes rest on the other Holmes. Pale, his forehead pearled with sweat, which he wipes with a handkerchief. John can see how much  misses to Mycroft not having the secure support of his umbrella. In fact, he seems to be about to collapse.
"Thanks a lot, Sherlock!" John thinks annoyed. Although this time John has to say that he doesn't mind at all. He should stop inviting or accepting invitations from anyone without applying a minimum of selection. Not to the point of becoming tranchant as unlikely as his flatmate, who considers the world populated by idiots. John can't imagine Sherlock on a date. Sherlock Holmes who tries to know and be known by another human being ... no, impossible!
<< I have to go. I have to feed the animals. It will be dark soon >> she mumbles, moving away from them without looking at them. She walk away with heavy stride and shipped to a van. Mary opens the side door, throwing in the wrong way what she purchased. She then climbs to the driver's side and starts up.
The doctor and the consultant stand by and watch the door until they hear the door close behind George Lestrade as well.
Henry Morgan, a Welsh pirate who lived in 1786 ... or so.
Moriarty sighs, putting on one of his puppy-like expressions. He kneels in front of Sherlock and theatrically caresses his pained face.
<< Thank you, Mr. Holmes >> he says, holding out his hand visibly more serene. Sherlock squeezes it and dismisses him with a pat on the back.
<< Good night >> he says and so they say goodbye. Without a comfortable kiss, without a 'see you'. Yet another fruitless attempt to combine something with a woman.
In these two days Sherlock has learned that he must start with the most watery dish. He dips his fork, muttering a tired 'Thank you' and pulls up the usual chicken. Sherlock soon discovered that Mary's cooking is not very varied. She forced him to eat the same dishes for lunch and dinner, the same quantities and all at the same temperature. He now manages to keep his hands steady around the fork, a sign that somehow the torture of meals is bearing fruit. However, Sherlock has to swallow everything very quickly, because her benefactress does not tolerate that time is wasted.
<< Well, it depends on what happened >>.
<< I won't leave you >>.
<< Are you going to leave the hotel half naked? >> back to the attack John, barely looking at Sherlock.
<< For once we agree, Mycroft >> Sherlock replies with the same coldness.
<< Of course. The scent is exquisite >> he says.
<< It is right. If I had given voice to all the things I preferred swallowing, maybe now I would not have been so badly >> the old man says with a whisper.
Sherlock sighs, intimately unconvinced of the doctor's words. He feels day after day the terrible certainty that he will never come out of that room alive.
<< If someone helped him, he would have survived. This is an aggravating circumstance for that bastard >> John says punching the table. He approaches Molly and kisses her on the forehead. << You are exceptional, as always >> he says and runs away leaving her speechless.
<< Not also this, no >> repeats between sobs.
<< Yes. The logo of that damned portal >> George says, passing his hand through his hair.
William shivers and Morgan tends his ears growling softly.
"I'm here, little brother."
<< Sherlock will drive them crazy >>. John and Greg laugh heartily, breaking the tension, overcoming the roar of the storm that hits the windows.
"It does not make sense!" Sherlock repeats to himself, feeling his stomach close more and more.
<< There is something different, in fact >> admits John. << We have become the dads of this puppy >>.
<< It is ... long to explain and I don't have much time >>.
Sherlock cannot reply to Moriarty stark truth. His stomach contracts, leaving an acidic taste in his mouth. Taste that reminds Sherlock of how he vomited, and quite a lot, that Sunday morning. He had closed himself in the bathroom, opened the shower of the tub and he let himself be overwhelmed by the retching. Maybe he would have ended up throwing up his soul anyway, even if John had behaved differently. He had drunk far too much and he was not used to. It had been, however, even more humiliating to embrace the toilet to vomit after those words.
<< Oh, no, Mary >> Hataway chuckles, apologizing to John with his eyes. << Captain Watson is no longer on duty and is here looking for a friend of his who is disappeared >> he says, pointing to the poster.
<< Hurry, we must hurry! >> Mary-child whispers. She lifts him from his bed made of excrement and vomit with the same simplicity with which a little girl would pick up a doll from the ground. Sherlock lets himself be carried away by those rock-hard arms that gently place him in the tub. The bites of abstinence have now passed, which means that a long time must have passed since the punishment of isolation began. Although the pain in the stomach and the gaps have passed Sherlock is now a prey to great tiredness. His leg still hurts, though less than at the beginning. The bone must have almost welded. How it is not known. He will remain lame. Hopelessly lame. He laughs like an idiot after that observation. Fragments of memories related to the first hours spent with John, in which he still walking clinging to his stick, come back to him. The doctor's was a psychosomatic lameness. His, however, will be painfully true. Here it is, again, the summary of his whole life expressed in a thought. Other people live annoying situations, yes, but passing. He, instead, lives only permanent damage for which there is no remedy.
<< How do you think this can make a difference in the eyes of a judge? >> Mycroft asks him, leafing through the register. << If there is a law, it is to prevent that everyone could make justice from being done alone, little brother >>.
<< Very important >> nods with a wink.
Want us, our advocate, your merciful eyes to console us.
"It's too much for me. Too much".
<< You are his blogger >>.
<< Johnny? >> Harry replies in amazement.
'Music helps you not to hear the silence inside', Johann Sebastian Bach said. Something different happened to Sherlock, though. In silence he brought out the shouting of a thousand thoughts and the many emotions that swirled inside him. That silence, created by the snow that had frightened him so much, now that he has created it within himself thanks to the violin, leaves him ... so. He should be frightened or even just amazed and instead it is simply ... so.
<< It is known how alcohol makes you uninhibited, even more if you are not used to it. But you are a doctor, I really don't think I should explain it to you >>.
<< Consulting detective >> can't help specifying Sherlock. << It's not a questioning, it's just that... you're ... different >>.
"Johnny-boy is looking for you" he retries these, resuming the game from a completely different front.
John hugs this man. He makes this unusual gesture moved more by a personal need than by a tacit request from the patient. The old man is amazed, but accepts what is also a gift for him. Embarrassed, he pats John's shoulder.
<< What happened to your husband? >> John asks.
"I would die as a hero!" he thinks, trying to stifle a hysterical laugh.
<< Silver was my dog. We were born on the same day, but he died on March 15th. After breakfast I went out to bring him the food and he, instead of running towards me happy, was lying on the ground. Dad said Silver died of old age. Kelly, my nanny, and I buried him in the garden, made a big cross and put all his toys around it. I miss him so much >> William  whispers and a tear rolls down his eyes. Morgan promptly licks it off and the boy smiles accepting the puppy's pampering.
When they arrive at the Spa they ask the reception employee to participate at the midnight ritual and she gives them bathrobes. Sherlock and John look around for the three men, but none of them are there. They head to the crowded changing rooms and chatter and wear bathrobes. The heat is less intense, tempered by the cold temperature of the autumn evening. Dressed up in this way, Sherlock and John head to the crowded relax area and sit on the windowsill of one of the large windows open onto the beautiful panorama of a London at night, from the sky strangely clear of clouds and full of stars.
<< Let me teach you another one, do you want? >> he whispers.
<< We aren't the only ones to forget you >> says the consultant, leaving John and Greg open-mouthed. << Fortunately Morgan never misses anything >> Sherlock smiles, giving a caress to the happy dog tht lick his hand.
<< A divorce is never a walk for a child and I fear that your husband, madam, will not give up his grip so easily >>.
<< Mary >> repeats, while his gaze travels beyond the doctor and brother, as if he were looking for her. << Where's Mary? >> asks confused.
Morgan's ears princked up. He looks around, letting roll away the ball.
<< This would be your sure-fire scientific method? >> chuckles Anderson.
<< I know of no other way than this >> John tries to justify himself.
<< Did you train him? >>.
“You hope John runs to save you. The damsel in danger, rescued by her bold prince charming ".
<< Sure >> retorts Sherlock. So far he has never thanked John and has always addressed him in a detached way. John knows that this is part of the package. He did not expect recognition and praise. The fact that Sherlock allows him to be so close to him is already a victory for John.
<< Do you really tell me this? >> Lizzy explodes like a fury. << You spending your days in the gym fucking with your instructor >>.
<< I have just returned. The refresher course in Dublin, remember? >>.
<< The fabric William found on the fence? >>.
<< In obtaining authorization to lure other young in exchange for a fictitious recognition valid only within the portal. There are super-known teens, famous as Hollywood stars with a lot of power in their hands. Literally the power of life or death over their peers. The last word, of course, belongs to the portal manager, but it seems that it is very easy to convince him >>.
John sighs and runs his hands over his tired face. Since he returned to Baker Street from the refresher course, he has slept a few hours and only because he has collapsed exhausted between one search and another of his missing flatmate. Because Sherlock is missing now. John is almost certain. He drops into the chair and rests his elbows on Lestrade's desk.
John hears Mrs. Hudson go to open and then Greg's heavy and fast steps on the stairs, which John too is now able to recognize.
<< Because I caught the signs of the impending explosion in the air >> he whispers, getting closer to him. John should move and stop staring at him, by making the gaze travel incessantly from his eyes to his lips. Lips that curve in an even bigger smile and the temptation to grab him by the collar of his jacket and make them his is so strong.
John would like to retort, but note how visibly stressed Greg is. It would be a useless quarrel that would not bring anything good to both of them. For this reason he takes a deep breath and decides to put aside pride.
<< Oh my God, I prefer to keep him as a last resort >> Greg retorts, twisting his nose. << I have to go, I have a mountain of trouble to manage. Please, try to understand what happened to him and, if you find him, call me! >> he says, opening the door. << Although I don't know the reason for the quarrel, Sherlock is giving me so much trouble that I am on your side regardless! >> he adds, heading to the car.
<< I don't want to think about this eventuality, John >> he finally says. << I prefer to imagine him horrified by the group of idiots with whom he finds himself forced to share too small a space. Like last Saturday. Do you remember what expression he had? >>.
John nods and prepares himself, by taking a deep breath. He speaks slowly, clearly pronouncing the words, as he had learn during the specialization and as he has done so many times in the presence of grieved relatives and heartfelt comrades. While explaining what Sherlock showed him the night before and what George told them that morning, he never looks away from the faces of Greg and George, ready to immediately intervene in case of malaise or a nervous breakdown.
"This woman is a tough nut to crack, Sherlock," John breaks in, warning him. "You could hit her and even seriously hurt her, but, before she even die or lose consciousness, Mary will have time to tear the razor from your hands and slice your throat or kill you with her bare hands."
Sherlock looks up, as always amazed by John's compliments. Their eyes remain hooked for a long time in the silence, that becomes more and more electric and full of tension.
<< In this last months I have seen Martin helping some people who have not felt well during the Aufguss. Happens that  in the common room I met a man  that Martin helped and I asked him how he was. This man reacted in a way that surprised me. He turned pale and walked away with an excuse. When I found out that Martin helped Byron Howard, I faced him >>.
<< What does this have to do with it? >> she growls, taking a step forward.
<< It is fantastic! Grandma's house has a huge garden, we will have a lot of fun, you will see >> he says, taking the dog's paws in his hands. << And then, if Morgan's help is needed for the investigation, we can go together, right Sherlock? >>.
<< It is me who must protect them, John! >> the detective replies decisively, looking at his friend with eyes swollen with tears. << Although it is more complicated now, this does not mean that it is impossible >>.
<< Did the weather alert predict the duration of the storm? >> Greg asks, completely changing the subject to prevent a cataclysm of blows and kicks from breaking loose in that office.
<< Something. I need to clarify a point and you can help me. Is it possible to go directly from the octagonal sauna, the one where the Aufguss takes place, to the male changing rooms? >>.
"Quite the opposite, Greg, far from it!" John thinks, but it's just a sigh that he misses. Greg looks at him curiously but says nothing more. They are there, both with their elbows resting on their knees, staring at the bed in front, while the wind dominates out there. It insinuates itself into the fixtures. It produces shout-like sounds.
<< Sure. And did you hear what they said about the weather forecast for the next forty-eight hours? >>.
<< Sherlock, I understand the situation but we can't stay behind the boy. We must try to save his parents >>.
<< You trust a lot of this irregular >> John says, with a touch of acidity that does not escape the consultant.
<< Your brother told me that he is worried about you, William >> Sherlock hears him say and would like to run away from what is about to happen. << Claims you have been using drugs for some time. Cocaine, specifically. He is afraid you have become addicted to it >>.
<< Oh my god! >>.
John sighs and leaves him alone. Knocking at the door. John opens cautiously and calms down to see a girl behind the cart. He lets her in, checks that she has brought what was requested and dismisses her with a tip.
constantly and he is aggressive not only with words >> Sherlock says, looking at the women that quickly lower their gaze. << Obviously >> notes Sherlock. << Madame, you said you peeked. What did you see? >> asks Sherlock to the cook.
<< It should be used as a shampoo, but you must keep it on for at least twenty minutes. Please don't mess around >>.
<< Greg >> John whispers, feeling crumble the mask of cold and logical rationality he has worn so far. He accepts the shoulder that the detective offers him and puts his forehead on it. It takes him a while to explode into tears, to cling to his friend with nervous gestures, shaken by convulsive sobs. Hataway and his men take a look at him and then turn respectfully to the other side. John doesn't care what those people are thinking. His best friend, the man he loves, is dead. This stupid way to died makes him angry. After all the stunts and the dangerouse adventures he has experienced.
<< Mycroft, this time the situation is serious >> says John, supporting his gaze of sufficiency. << Mrs. Hudson left on the 9th, a day after me, and told me that in the morning, when she left the apartment, Sherlock was still at home and did not mention his intention to leave London. He did not receive any request on the site, or rather none that could have been seriously considered by him, and not even any e-mail. Lestrade tries from the 10th to contact him to submit a case that may be of Sherlock's interest and has not received replies to his messages. When Greg tries to call him the cell phone appears to be unreachable. I also tried to contact him, until just before I came here, with the same result. It can't be one of his usual follies, Mycroft. Something happened to Sherlock, I feel it >>.
<< Oh, it's really beautiful. I recommend you try it >>.
<< Listen to me! >> asks him, shaking his hands. << Before meeting you at the Bart's, that afternoon six months ago, I sat every night with the gun in my hand on the miserable bed of the shabby apartment of the pension where I lived. I looked at the gun, felt its weight, the cold iron that never heats up completely in contact with the skin and I tried to give the order to my left hand to bring it to the temple and shoot. I had lost everything, Sherlock. Everything I had fought for. The brilliant militar career that opened before me, a satisfying job, the large family of fellow soldiers and superiors of which I now felt part of. All lost, due to a rifle shot fired by I don't even know who during a war that didn't belong to me. This was enough. I was no longer able to serve, so they discarded me with a medal, many beautiful words and a poor pension. I couldn't stand it. Not because of the effort of getting used to civil life again, as Ella says, but because I felt rejected, abandoned, thrown away like a broken piece that can no longer be used. You picked me up, Sherlock. You gave me a place to stay, the chance to still feel useful and to continue fighting a war that I feel most mine, this time. For you I'm not a broken piece. You also healed my psychosomatic lameness within an evening simply by giving me confidence. You went beyond the pitiful lame that everyone saw, the war veteran who, poor man, must reintegrate into society, even if I was a criminal who came out after years in prison. I owe you my life, Sherlock, because if I hadn't met you, one of those evenings my left hand would have obeyed the order and I ... now I wouldn't be here >>.
John isn't slow at all on similar occasions and discovers the pleasure of taking time.
The master stiffens, sincerely frightened by his threat and remains silent.
<< In an indecent way >> she says, while making the thread to the blade passing it on a leather belt. Sherlock looks at her hypnotized. His hand from the chin has slipped on the throat, to protect it.
<< Lestrade, have your men finished with the reliefs of the footprints? >>.
The victim resisted and the killer tightened his biceps with greater force.
<< Really? >> Fox chuckles. << The involvement of Lizzy and Greg has upset you, as well as realizing how Moriarty can act to accomplish his purpose >>.
"What should I do, Myc?".
<< And here I am >> says John, making Sherlock laugh again and, god, now he knows he will do everything to continue to hear him laugh like that.
Sherlock looks at the pit full of corpses. He stands at the edge of this secret cemetery and is watching the worms over rotting bodies. Sherlock crouches down to be able to see them better. Smalls and plumps, they nibble the flesh once alive without having pain or torment. Without wondering where this food that feeds them comes from, who it was, how it lived, what it fed in turn. None of the silly questions that humans usually ask themselves about the food they eat.
<< Obviously not >>, chuckles, << but I made a mess. As always. And I can't pretend to get away. Not by him >>.
It's a stupid reaction, he knows it well. He would have liked that John doesn't discover what happened to him, but it was not possible . Unfortunately. Sherlock takes his wallet and looks for the business card of the hotel manager. He calls him and, despite the late hour, the little man answers at the second ring.
<< You are beautiful, you know? >> she says awkwardly. She hesitantly bringing a hand close to Sherlock's healthy cheek and the light caress that rests on it worries him much more than the blows taken so far.
<< Only my flatmate >> reluctantly admits. John is totally unaware of the trouble in which Sherlock is, at this time.
<< Hey, wait I don't know if ... >>.
<< Do you respect her? >> shouts the woman, pulling her head up. Her clenched fists lead Sherlock to nod convulsively.
<< You won't tell me that she live alone? >> Greg asks him, still turned in the direction towards which the van has headed.
<< Because ... it could become a problem for your intimate relationships >>.
"Now I recognize you!" Moriarty applauds, appearing behind him. “Too bad it's too late, Sherlock. You were wrong again, my friend. "
<< I think this is not a problem >> nods the consultant. Morgan paws towards Sherlock and rests his head against his belly. Sherlock caresses him on the neck for a long time, where he knows he likes him. << Thanks for all that you have done for us, little one >> whispers him, placing his forehead against Morgan's ruffled head. The puppy lifts his head and licks Sherlock's face, accepting kisses and caresses from both of them willingly.
