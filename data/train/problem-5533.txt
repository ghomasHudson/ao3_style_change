"Yeah, it's a little suspicious," Steve conceded as he opened the door—
Thor nodded. "I do understand the concept of poking fun at one's friends and allies in order to better secure the bonds of brotherhood—"
"There were two of us in that room, and you didn't say a goddamned word about protection."
He stopped talking abruptly and pursed his lips and scrunched his face in thought.
"You know, they say it's the thought that counts," he defended with a mutter.
"I know that, Tony," Bruce said, trying for even but coming off annoyed. "But I'm not willing to take that risk. Some women don't even need meds. Some women barely have any pain. You've had absolutely zero complications from this pregnancy so far aside from the usual annoyances—"
"No, see, you don't
Tony shrugged and twisted back and forth on his chair somewhat. "No, don't worry about it. I mean, hell, if I were in your shoes, I'd find the whole thing disgusting, too."
Steve went to snap back...something...at her slight against him, but before he could, Thor cut in and said, "The Goddess Esmeralda has many powers of which to speak. She can be most helpful in your desire to not be apart from your bonded."
And then they'd won the battle. And then they'd gone out for shawarma. And then he was extending an invite to them to crash at his place whenever they were in town. They next thing he knew, there were half-asleep Avengers at his breakfast table, a super soldier in his bed, and life, a few disturbances aside, was pretty damned good. It was everything he'd never let himself imagine could be his because, well, why would it be? Why would anyone want anything from Tony Stark other than what he could buy for them? If he at any time wondered if the Avengers were at all like all the rest and only after his bank account, that worry was laid to rest once it became apparent that his penthouse had become to them like the main set of a sitcom — the main meeting spot for all the characters where they hung out. If they only wanted him for what he could buy or make for him, they'd keep to their quarters or the other parts of the Tower — like that communal floor that barely got any use — not his own apartment.
The little girl yawned and shrugged. "Yeah, I guess." She bounded over to Tony and began to climb onto his lap, starling Tony, who looked over at Bruce in a panic for help. Bruce just laughed a little and held up his hands again as though to imply to Tony that he was on his own for this one.
“What, Capricorn, I can’t have a drink when I want to?” he asks angrily, hand not holding the bottle flying through the air and almost smacking Steve in the side of the head.
“Who was your favorite?” Tony asks him curiously.
Tony clenches his eyes shut but the tears escape anyway, tracking down his cheeks and into his two-day old stubble. Natasha’s hand slides away as he rolls over, turning his back and keeping his eyes shut tight. There’s silence, and then the bedsheets rustle and she’s leaving, just as quiet as she came in, door closing with a subdued click behind her.
Tony scoots out of the vinyl booth, Steve tucking his cash back into his pants pocket and following. At the door, Steve reaches past Tony to hold it open for him. Tony fans a hand in front of his face and breathes in a falsetto, “My hero.” Steve smirks, bends at the waist in a gentlemanly bow, and follows him out the door as Tony sashays past.
Tony shrugs. “Tony Stark,” he says. “Iron Man, apparently.”
“Steve, please don’t do this, you don’t want to do this, please. It’s my fault, please, I’ll keep my mouth shut, I will, please don’t go, Steve.” He knows he’s begging, and god what has he turned into that he’s begging like a teenaged girl with tears in his eyes, but he can’t lose Steve, he can’t.
“Why not? It happened and you’re sorry and I accept your apology. It’s not a big deal—“
He hears Steve take a sharp breath, ignores him. Barnes stays silent, face unmoving, before his lips quirk up at the edges. It makes him look dangerous.
“Tony, she’s not a, a hoe!” Steve says, horrified and indignant. Tony just laughs harder.
Steve doesn’t answer. Tony looks at him, assessing, eyes far too sharp for how many drinks he’s had. Then he stands suddenly and takes a step toward Steve, reaches a hand out.
“You’re out of your mind, are you actually serious right now? There is no way, absolutely
“Steve, man, what’s up with you lately?”
"You really think that? That I would-- I would trade you for him? That I'm going to give you up now that he's back?"
“Where did they take him? We need to do something.” Tony starts to stand, and Steve gently but firmly pushes him back into the couch.
“Steve—“
“I’m so sorry,” Steve continues, voice choked. Tony opens his eyes, didn’t realized he closed them, and sees tears trailing down Steve’s face.
“I’m sorry, sir, they have shut down the elevators as well.” He sounds apologetic and frustrated, but Tony doesn’t hear that, can only hear the men storming up the stairwell across the room.
“It’s not up to you to decide how to handle the fallout. We’re a team during the battles, and we should be a team after them.”
A ball of paper hits Tony in the side of the head and he gasps in mock outrage. Turning, he puts a hand over his mechanical heart.
“I love you.”
Tony laughs. “What happened to bros before hoes, man?” he gripes, chuckling. Steve looks appalled.
Tony pulls back to look at his face, blotchy and red and covered in tear tracks. He unclenches his fists and reaches up to cup Steve’s cheeks gently between his hands, thumbs brushing away wetness.
Tony’s drinking more, something else Steve has noticed, but he’s got it under control. He’s expected to at these shindigs, anyway, and if he has one or two by himself at home, it’s not a big deal, he’s just stressed after a long day’s work dealing with the incompetant morons at R&D that Pepper assures him are qualified, she’d screened them herself, thank you very much.
Steve must hear something, because he looks right at the camera in the corner of the room, right into Tony’s eyes. “Tony, I love you. I love you so much—“ He’s cut off when the door explodes inward and dust and debris obscures Tony’s view.
“Then let’s eat, Soldier.”
“How— how do you—“ he stutters, cutting off in a ragged groan when Tony grinds up into him.
Cap’s face has gone from earnest to irritated to resigned, and now rests somewhere around determined. He takes a deep breath, chest expanding and holy hell he’s huge, his chest and shoulders dwarf Tony and Tony may only be 5’9” but he’s pretty broad and he works hard to keep his physique toned but it's still nothing compared to Rogers. It's really not fair.
FRIDAY informs him at five after that Steve’s here, and Tony watches the elevator doors as the display above them lights up the passing floors. It dings faintly and the doors slide open, and Steve steps out, hands tucked in his pockets and shoulders hunched.
“Okay, Tony Stark,” Steve says, voice light. “Tell me something I couldn’t find out by searching your name on the internet.”
Tony’s eyes are liquid brown pools full of compassion and desire. They search Steve’s face, taking in everything, every feeling Steve would rather keep hidden, every thought he’s ever had about the man in front of him. Tony smiles softly, a small thing that’s so intimate Steve wonders if he’s ever smiled like that for anyone else before, and he wants to keep it, wants to hoard it and not let anyone ever see this side of the enigmatic billionaire except for him.
Steve sighs. “But, Tony, we could use Iron Man—“
His phone is still working perfectly, despite being in a run-down city with no cell towers. Natasha had given it to him, after the SHIELD fiasco, and even if it hadn't had the name STARK embossed across the top, he would have known who she’d gotten it from. He gets crystal clear reception everywhere, and access to everything he could need, no issues with GPS or wifi. There’s always a hotel room waiting for him in each new city, and though he knows Natasha has her own resources, he suspects Tony’s behind it. Like he’s behind the extra funds in his bank account.
Steve nods, expression too complex for Tony to figure out, somewhere between tender and indulgent. Then he lays down on his back, pulling Tony to his side. Tony nuzzles into Steve’s massive chest, feeling loved and protected, even if only for the night, and he drifts off to the sound of fireworks and Steve’s steady heartbeat.
“I love you,” Steve says, almost pleads.
“But see, if I do that there’s too much power rerouted to the jet boots and then I fly straight into the ceiling — again — and your father wouldn’t like that very much. You don’t even want to know how long I was banned from the workshop after he saw the tapes of the initial Iron Man testing, it was terrible, I was a prisoner in my own house, my own
He honest-to-god did not expect Steve to backtrack and stick his head back into the doorway, an odd sort of smile on his face. And he totally didn't expect Steve to come back into the room and pull him into his arms. And he definitely did not expect Steve to hold him tight and squeeze him then pull back and put his finger under Tony's chin to tilt his head upward.
Tony sat back in surprise. "Is Captain America pro-choice?"
"Birdbrain, you're demoted. Sugar bunny, you're back to being my best man—"
"And I will continue to be perfect, and a fucking large Coke isn't going to change anything overnight."
He peered at the readout display just as Steve turned his attention to it and said, "What in the
Steve hummed then said, "Yeah, you do," and moved his arms to wrap them around Tony. Tony went with it, finding safety, security, and pleasure in being wrapped up in Steve's arms.
Steve slid on his track pants then grabbed his sneakers and sat down on the bed to lace them up. "I take it the mandatory shirtlessness is just for me?"
Wilson just rolled his eyes and shook his head, a small 'I can't believe I have to listen to this' smile on his face.
Before he knew it, Steve had scooped him up again and tossed him down onto the bed, flat on his back as Steve braced himself over top of him, spreading Tony's legs apart with his knee and rutting against him as he sucked at his neck.
This was definitely the kind of behavior that could get him demoted from the supervisory position he held on the night shift. Thankfully, his boss was only ever there two nights a month, and this wasn't one of his scheduled nights to appear.
"Sacrilegious," he replied without thinking. "I mean, can you blame him? That shield's like his security blanket or like his child or something. Probably sits there polishing it every night until it shines— And no, that was not bad innuendo about him polishing other things like his knob or something, OK? I mean like he sits there with a rag and a bottle of whatever you'd use on vibranium and just works at it into the night. Again, not innuendo."
Barton just clapped Steve on the shoulder and said, "He's all yours, Cap, you lucky son-of-a-gun."
"If I was more of an ass than I am, I would purposely mishear that as, 'Sex for Tony Stark?' and the answer would be, 'Yes, please.'
"Nothing. Just a reminder that there's something living inside of me that's looking for attention. That's all."
"Yeah? And you won't be unless you want to get divorced."
"This is the only life I
"Yeah, that could be any of about a thousand people," he said and tried to put some distance between him and the…kid.
"Just for a little while," Steve said, and there was almost a plea to his voice. "Tony, I can't lead the team to the best of my ability if you're out there potentially getting hurt."
Steve still didn't say anything, preferring to take in the sight before him, and Tony moved over and straddled his waist, grinding his hips against Steve's and draping his arms gently over Steve's shoulders. Through the flimsy fabric, Tony could feel the hot, thick, hardness of Steve's shaft between them, and he canted his hips ever so gently to brush against it, watching as Steve swallowed yet again and closed his eyes. It wasn't quite the same without his own cock between them, and he kind of missed that sensation, but he had to work with what he had, and judging by Steve's face, it was working at the moment.
Bruce dropped his hand and looked point-blank at Tony. "
Tony nodded. "As much as they can be led, anyway. Barton, that asshole, likes to call us 'Mom and Dad.' No, I don't know who's supposed to be who, though I can guess, and the fact that
Tony sighed again, and he moved to sit on the floor beside Steve, torn wrapping paper crinkling beneath him.
"Don't care, J," he said, the fight going out of him with each word. "Don't care. Is he… Is he dead?"
"Hell yeah!" Wilson replied. "We'll do back-to-back with
It wasn't that he hated that other life, and it wasn't that he was running away from it. He didn't run away from fights. If he started running, he'd never stop. It was just that this life was so much…
"I assure you, my friend, it is quite possible," Thor replied, no trace of anger or malice in his voice, only amusement.
Tony hummed a little again and broke the kiss enough to say, "My penthouse."
"You mean fondle myself — like fondle my breasts — or—"
What are you? A Baptist preacher leading the cause against demon rum?"
"I'm sorry," Steve said through his mouthful of chewed food.
OK, inconvenient and very, very attractive. Hey, what could he say? He was only human, after all. And Tony was very, very good-looking. Man or woman.
Still, he was thankful that they had been there for him, but it wasn't… It just wasn't the same as having
, and Tony sighed and rolled his eyes.
"So," he said, "you could...make it so Tony would live forever, too — or as long as I do, I mean?"
Without a word, the lights went down, the gleam from the city casting dark shadows over the broad, open space of the living area, and after Tony's eyes had adjusted to the darkness, he sat there and watched some other Tony Stark's daughter slumber contentedly and wondered if that Tony Stark knew how lucky a son-of-a-bitch he really was.
"Yeah."
But Tony just looked up at him and said, "Doesn't that go against your whole nothing-before-the-baby's-born policy?"
'Honest fella.' Jesus, what his life had become…
Hey, yeah, there was an idea. Rhodey. He should call Rhodey and see what he was up to. Maybe he could—
But Steve just learned down some and pressed his cheek against Tony's so that their faces were side-by-side. "So?"
There was a large, formal dining room on the opposite side of the foyer to the living room, and Steve passed through that, marveling at the furniture and décor that looked like it cost a fortune, before he passed through a butler's pantry and then came into a large, sleek-looking kitchen.
"Much more manageable," tiny said with an approving nod.
" she breathed out, and Tony turned to meet her gaze. Her lips quirked into a little smile, and she rubbed his abdomen a little and said, "Congratulations, Stark. It's a baby."
"That was fun. I wanna be a flower girl again. Papa, when Anna Tasha 'n' Unca Bucky get married again, can I be the flower girl again?"
"Hey, it's not like we say
"No, hey!" Tony said and reached out to put a hand on Steve's arm. "It's not— I'm not saying you can't be confused. I'm just saying… Look, the most mind-blowing orgasm I ever had was in a body that I'm still not sure I consider my own. I don't know. It's…it's weird, all right? I— Look, cards on the table — and this doesn't go past this room — there are parts of me that are enjoying the whole experience of being a woman. Not just dressing as a woman but physically
Steve could do nothing but grin at him. "I know you don't mean that."
"I can help you up. It's not a—"
"You know, I can't figure if you two are making blonde jokes or old man jokes about them," Pepper said then reached out for the baby in Rhodey's arms. "All right, my turn."
"Not a good topic to discuss?" he asked.
Steve and Tony exchanged looks once again before Tony nodded and said, "That's about the long and short of it."
"Is it bothering you?" Steve asked without looking up.
"So, why now?" Hill asked, and Tony shrugged, pulling his legs up onto the couch and tucking into himself protectively.
"So, I just want you to keep all this in mind from now until the end of time, OK? I know you weren't here to see it, but I'm sure Bruce could give you a play-by-play of it, and I just want you to remember what I went through for you. I want you to remember what I did for you. I want you to remember the punishing abuse your child put my body through. And yes, she's a cutie, and yes, I love her, but
"Exactly," he said and looked up to where Bruce now stood at his elbow. "Look, I know you think it'll be easy as pie to get her back where you think she belongs, but what if that's the point? What if she doesn't belong there anymore? What if she belongs here? What if this is always how it was supposed to go? She was always supposed to come here."
"Of course we are," Tony said but still didn't let go of Rhodey. "We're soul mates."
letting you go for anything."
"Huh?" he asked and turned back to her. "What are you talking about? It's a waffle iron."
She then nodded her head toward the door and said, "Get out of here before Steve sees you and starts asking questions. Making him go out in the field when he knows what's going on back at home might be even worse than keeping him home when he knows what's going on out in the field."
"Yeah? Well, you're wrong."
"What, are we in a fairytale?" Tony said.
season finale."
"But you're not sure."
"Yeah!" she said like he should have known that. "Up the state. That's where the 'vengers stay. We don't stay there when we go t' visit. We have a house with a big yard and my swing set's there. Daddy says 'm not allowed t' have a swing set in the Tower. That's for outside. We went there for Christmas, but it didn't snow until after Christmas but Maddie 'n' I got to play outside in the snow. 'nd I heard you and Daddy talking. You said we're gonna be staying there
"Then stop— Then stop—"
Tony nodded and considered this a moment. Steve went back to eating his gargantuan amount of food, and he watched him for a minute or so then said, "Well, I'm not going to be like this forever. Just another, what, three— four months or something?"
And that Steve and his Steve were pretty similar in how they kissed, now that he thought about it, but that kind of followed, didn't it? They were just alternate universe versions of each other.
"OK, J," Tony said and swiped the display on. "Let's see if we're the only Steve and Tony in the universe with a daughter named 'Olivia.'"
conversation I was having
verb?"
"And I can't lose you—"
"But no one uses that floor, Steve!"
The little girl had scrambled off the couch and was back over at the gifts. Sure, this was an odd ruse even by Hydra's standards, but if they were trying to trick Steve, throwing him into something like this, giving him everything he'd ever wanted, was a surefire way of buying themselves some time while they worked to better their weapons and, of course, take over the world. Isn't that what every bad guy wanted to do? When had comic books become real life? When had it become
It felt wonderful.
"But that's what would happen. That's how it would happen," Steve said and stepped forward, dropping his arms as he tried out another threatening pose, hands balled into fists at his side. "If you let his continue — if you don't undo what you've done to him — that's what's going to happen to him. They're going to have to gut him to get this out of him, and they're not going to know the first thing of how to do it because this doesn't happen here. Fellas don't have babies. They're not made for that. Dame—
"Insecurities?"
" he yelled as they all pinged off various surfaces, and he stared at the board with the few remaining beans — untouched by the tenderizer, of course — and said, "OK, we're going to blame this on me being pregnant and not in my right mind."
Oh, and breasts. Rather prominent breasts instead of pectorals.
"Ugh," he said and tried to adjust himself to get into a comfortable sitting position again. God, were his joints supposed to ache this much? "Seriously," he said and brushed some crumbs from the sheets. "Laughing, sneezing, pretty much
"Goddamn it! Well, you're coming with me."
The Council was silent for a moment, not one man daring to speak, until the second man to speak that night said rather diplomatically, "The King needs an heir. There is no question about that. Were the King to, Heaven forbid, die tomorrow, there would be no God-anointed heir to take his place. It is quite possible and more likely than that
Tony raised an eyebrow at him. "Are you kidding me? I've actually embedded sensors into my body for my flying armored suit."
"And I think it is," he said with an easy shrug. "But your concern is duly noted."
— no, wait! That could be awesome! With the state of computer graphics today? Hyrule would look
Tony snorted a laugh. "The bicentennial, really?"
thing."
Barnes just nodded silently, either humbled and moved by Tony's words or smart enough to bite his tongue when he knew he would never get the last word anyway.
Clint rolled his eyes and, as Steve strolled into the kitchen, said, "Hey, Cap, your spoiled-as-fuck other half just hit me with a spoon."
"And remind me to buy Nat an island as a 'thank you.'"
"I don't need a—"
"…no."
But Steve shook his head. "You should have to be—"
"I think I can live with that," Bruce said with a nod. "I'll be back in a bit to check on you. Have to go check on our temporary residents downstairs."
OK, he at least knew
Steve set his glass down as well, and he folded his arms, tucking his hands into his armpits. "I don't want them throwing any baby showers for you."
Tony glared at him, and Barnes stopped laughing and sobered immediately.
Thor ignored his obvious discomfort and said, "May I ask, my friend, precisely what the Goddess said to you when she cast the spell?"
"You mean do I think you have more than a snowball's chance in hell with Captain America?"
And even Steve seemed to notice this as he said, "I'm sorry, honey, but we can't get any more of that other stuff you liked. They, ah, went out of business."
He stared right into Steve's unwavering steadfastness, and he adjusted himself on the table and said, "Fine," and threw his legs up and over into the stirrups. He slid down a bit to better position himself, and he threw a look back at Steve and said, "I bet that's a sentence you never would have thought you'd ever say to me back in Stuttgart."
times in the past, but he'd never felt like such a being of pure sexuality as he did at that moment.
Steve tried oh-so-hard not to smile, but it was hard, especially as he choked on a laugh at Tony's haughty attitude toward being caught out, and as Tony huffed and combed his hair, Steve gave him another glance-over and said, "There's a point where they stop being 'lifts' and start being 'heels.'"
"It's OK," Steve said with an exhaled breath. "If you don't want to nurse, I can go get a bottle from the fridge."
Steve turned his head some more in an attempt to block as much of Tony from his view as he could. "'Disgusted' isn't the word I'd use."
James Anthony—
eat Christmas trees unless they're made of, like, flour and sugar and shit."
"Is he really gonna be a
Tony shrugged, but Steve turned his patented Stare of Disapproval on the gallery owner and said, "Yeah,
He rolled his eyes. "You're such a sap. Why do I even bother talking to you?"
"Yeah. She settles much more easily with you than she does with any of the others."
Pushing through his misery, he downed five more agents — taking out his pain on the sons-of-bitches that would dare try anything at his tower, or, god forbid, dare try anything on his baby — and had just gotten confirmation from Natasha that the first fifty floors were secure when he crashed headfirst into one agent that had somehow evaded them.
Peter covered his mouth to try and swallow the urge to vomit as he took in the sight of the corpse before him. She was absolutely covered in blood and cuts and bullets and the hole in her chest revealed her missing ribs... missing
"M-Mr. Bucky can you come get me please, I... I don't feel so good."
After that, they went to a nice fancy restaurant that Peter would never be able to afford to go into otherwise and they had a really nice meal together. He was always a part of the conversation and he left the restaurant pleasantly full.
Bucky swears to god that if HYDRA ever got their hands on Peter, no matter what it'd take, he'd mow down every single one of those fuckers. He'd rip them limb from goddamn limb for putting a single finger on his boy.
It's awkward, but it's cute.
Rumlow seemed to like Peter's willingness so far, so he made Peter a promise, telling him that he could have any two of the things that were just listed off to him if he could do one simple thing. Peter nodded, desperately wanting a hot meal and a shower. Rumlow smirked, the burned skin of his face stretching in an ugly, unnatural way.
"I just..." He fiddled with his blanket. "I wanna come home... It's kind of a bummer living here... Everything's so far away..."
Forklifts and bulldozers and cranes lifting hundreds of pounds of metal and cement slabs way above the heads of the city-goers.
"Please what, Petey? Huh?" Wade teased. He knew what Peter wanted before he even asked. He easily picked up on the way that Peter pushed his hips back in a silent plea for more. "Please fuck you harder?"
The man then unfolded it for him and stood on the other side of the table. On the cloth were various objects, ranging from a scalpel to a lighter. Peter furrowed his brows in confusion.
He knew that she agreed wholeheartedly. They'd both been swallowed by the spotlight and spit back out again after they'd been chewed like they were nothing more than waste. They never had a choice, but Peter does. And if Peter doesn't remember being a hero, then obviously he can't go back. They're not going to train him as a hero, they're going to treat him like a son... When all of the paperwork is finished, he will be, and they'll be 100% responsible for Peter and his life.
He shifted to leave the bed but slipped a little and fell right out onto the cold tile. He heard an, 'oh my god' from somewhere and the door beside him opened up. Nat herself, or, he thought, he couldn't be sure, grabbed onto him and he pointed to the small bathroom's door. She seemed to take the hint as he gagged and she all but dragged his ass to the toilet.
Bucky shook his head. "How can you love me after what I did?" A sob left his lips and Steve sighed and pulled him into his arms.
Wade managed to take care of three or four more agents without a problem... And then the alarms went off. The loud noise and bright lights sent Peter into a panic and Wade told him to cover his ears.
And yes, the sandwich was smushed.
Peter started getting really confident with it. He put his hands on the wall in front of him and pushed back, looking over his shoulder and rolling his sinful little hips in a way that made Wade want to pin him down to the dirty ground at their feet and fuck him senseless. Peter combed his fingers through his hair and tugged on the ends ever so slightly, but it was enough for Wade to get the hint and grab a fistful of his hair. Wade pulled on it while he fucked quicker and harder into Peter, who couldn't contain his moans at this point.
Nat swears she's never seen Steve look so tense. He wasn't even this tense when Peter's web fluid exploded in the living room and stuck him and Bucky to the couch.
Nat nods, "Yes... It was in August... He turned seventeen."
"Oh, Peter... You know it's not that easy to get away from me... You know there's only one way now."
Bucky sighed. "No. No, and I ain't pushin' him, Stevie. This is fucked, n'you know it."
short filler that's kinda late :/
And the young boy- no, man- in the photo was long gone now too, his body traded in for a bigger and stronger version of the one he'd sported in the past. He briefly recalled a taller version of the man standing by his side during the war, touching his shoulder as they stood in the snow, kissing him as they laid in their tent... His memories clouded with gunfire and death, his heart falling as quick as he once did.
She was very sincerely hoping that this relationship would last, for both of their sakes. Because if they were happy it was all that mattered, right? The problem with the group's resolution was this: Steve still felt for Tony. Anyone in the room could see it. The way Steve let his eyes linger, the way he smiled when he caught Tony's eye. It was sad.
"You're still on about blaming me for that, aren't you?"
"Peter, can you tell me what happened?"
It fuckin' worked, though, because the more Wade pleased him, the more Peter pleased back until they were both cumming and laying back to catch their breaths, the only part of them touching was their intertwined hands.
The call was answered on the third ring, and on the other end was a cheerful sounding voice, "Hiya, Petey baby. What's up?"
Peter's Spidey-Senses were tingling like crazy. Someone was going to die. Death was the last thing he needed right now.
Peter thought about it for a second. Had he dreamt about that night?
"Don't start, punk... I'll let you go, it's probably getting pretty late there, huh?"
"Newsflash, not everything is about you, Stark. You're not always gonna get what you want."
With no immediate response, he hopped over the railing and landed right on top of the hood of a car that had been passing below at the time and rolled down onto the asphalt beneath and took off at a dead sprint towards the alleyway.
"Oh God, Wade, yes, please yes, shit." Peter tilted his head back as Wade pulled his hair. Peter kept letting himself be pulled back until he was in an upright position and pressed against Wade's chest, calloused skin radiating heat and dripping with sweat.
Steve is relieved to hear that Peter used some of his free time to attend church instead of obsessing over the details of May's upcoming funeral. aka, Steve doesn't want to raise Peter in The Life anymore. (part 2)
Though strapped to a chair and probably starving, Rumlow just laughed from beneath the bag. Now that Bucky was a safe distance away, he was able to put back up the wall that made him seem tough in the face of danger.
The thought of Stark alone just might be enough to kill Wade's boner, but when Peter lifts his hips to grind against him, Tony Stark is forgotten in an instant.
This chapter is like 90% smut so skip this one if you wanna avoid it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"You're scaring him!" Wade snapped, and the thought of scaring Peter seemed to be enough to snap Bucky back because in the next second he was freeing Peter from his grip. He was staring at Peter as he crumpled to the ground, but his free hand pulled his gun and pointed it at Wade.
The first time during the ride that Bucky speaks, he easily depresses everyone within earshot. "We missed his birthday..."
"Buck, do you wanna talk about it?"
So, he quietly picks the flowers that Peter thinks are the prettiest, and that means that he picks at least four of each flower for the boy, because he,
Wade doesn't deny it. Inside of the next bag is actually something they'd discussed over text recently. It's small, but it kind of means a lot to Peter, especially since he's trying to reinvent this person that he's going to be. He wants to do it right. So when he pulls out the tissue paper, all he can do is smile.
Steve chuckles a little, "It was alright. How was hanging out with Tony?"
Peter nods as he takes another bite of the fruit. "Yeah, it was good. We had Pepper with us. We went shopping."
Peter nodded as best as he could with the tight grip on his jaw. Rumlow used one hand to undo his pants again, letting them drop to his knees. He pushed Peter's knees up to his chest, and without a care for how much it may hurt Peter, began to push inside of him. Peter cried out at the pain and the burn of the stretch. Rumlow wasn't exactly small, and this was agony for Peter's fragile body.
When it blinked white, it meant that someone was trying to contact him on the intercom. When it was blue, it meant someone was at the door either waiting to come in, or already on their way through it. When it blinked red, it meant that his heart rate was elevated and that Peter needed to calm down. The lights worked so well, Peter was visibly relaxed. These lights were only installed in his room though, so that's where he began spending the most time.
He rose from the bed like the never-laid-to-rest worries of the rest of the world around them and followed Nat to the kitchen. Recently, a screen had been installed in the living room that displayed nothing but the stats coming from Peter's watch in real time. It helped a lot, seeing it just during the day. Even if Peter was in the same room with them, at least they would know if Peter needed them but couldn't say.
Peter knew. Of course Peter knew. It seemed like there were men in every hallway, so it was only a matter of time before they ran into one. When they did come upon the first one though, Wade made quick work of plunging the longer knife into the base of the man's neck. He dropped to the ground and they stepped over him as they went.
Now he just had to figure out how on Earth he could manage to break the news to Peter that he was going to be leaving, despite promising Peter just yesterday that he wasn't going to leave his side. He had to figure out how to live with being that asshole of a deadbeat parent that abandons their child in their time of need.
At first, Peter worried, wondering if someone finally found a way to kill Wade, and then after a while, he let himself quit caring. He had better things to do. He had A's to make and he had parties to go to and he had missions to go on. Most important of all though, he had an Aunt to find, and he'd stop at nothing to do so.
Professional 3D Whitestrips, shea sugar scrub, Himalayan salt scrub, miracle hair mask, apple cider vinegar and Himalayan sea salt scalp scrub, brush cleanser, a cleansing pad, mascara guard, lash tool and curler, a mini eyebrow tweezer set,
They were finally going to start over.

Peter jumped as the door opened behind him. He turned and hid his phone behind his back and Wade dove behind the dumpster as Steve walked out of the apartment and leaned on the railing to look at the sky. He didn't say anything for a long minute, choosing instead to let Peter worry about being in trouble for a long moment.
Tony watched as the boys face transformed through several different emotions in linear succession. First confusion, then sadness, then anger, then grief, then anger and confusion again.
“Tony, I hurt you. I needed time to think. I’m sorry it took me so long, but I needed to be away from you for a little bit—“
He registers the fact that his armored hands have shoved past the forcefield before he feels the first shocks running through his body. They’re sharp, horribly painful, like he’s gripped a live telephone wire tight in both hands, and the jolts run from his fingertips and into his chest, down through the rest of his body, and he can feel his heart falter with each pulse. It’s like another heartbeat, one that’s trying to overtake his own and is probably going to win the fight.
And he's gone.
“Don’t give me that shit, Steve,” Tony says angrily, slamming his palms down on the desktop, bits of million dollar electronics rattling dangerously. “I did what was necessary. I kept the team safe, like I’ve been doing for months now, no thanks to you.”
“Tony,” he says softly. Tony looks up and Rhodey’s eyes are red and puffy, and Tony reaches out to him pathetically. Rhodey takes his hand, holding onto it tightly. “You know what they brought you in here to tell you, right?” Tony shakes his head and turns it into Steve’s chest. He knows. Oh, he knows, but he’s not going to acknowledge it. He doesn’t know how he can be expected to.
Tony's whole body jerks like he's been electrocuted and he releases Steve's hand, jumping up from his chair.
Steve shakes his head determinedly. “You’re not an asshole, Tony. You made a mistake.”
“Cap? Cap! Fuck!” Tony swears, cursing Dr. Doom for his fucking paranoia and his fucking communications blocks. He’s grateful their comms are working at all right now, thanks to his new tech, anyone else’s would have been rendered useless the moment they crossed the border hours ago, but he needs to be able to hear his team from more than three blocks away or it’s not going to help him for much longer. The fight keeps spreading out, and the longer Steve chases Barnes the further out of range he’s going to get.
He’s hiccuping pathetically now, attempting to hold back the tears and not doing a very good job of it. He just wants Steve to talk to him, say something, tell him how to fix it, yell at him, anything.
"Where am I?" He figures that's easy enough to understand. The nurse's eyebrows furrow as she considers her reply. "Hospital," she says, with a very strong accent. She pauses, then continues, "Romania."
“Actually, I can’t remember anything. Before this.” Tony gestures around himself, at the bed and the room. “Before waking up. I don’t remember anything.”
He shakes his head, pushing that thought away. He can't like that.
Steve lets himself out.
“Also, I’d like to buy him another of whatever he’s having.” He gestures across to Tony, who is still staring deep into his drink. The bartender merely nods and opens him a new beer, and Steve’s grateful for the discretion.
Steve is silent for a few moments and Tony risks glancing up at him. He’s looking away now, gaze directed somewhere towards the bathroom, and Tony watches him swallow. It looks painful.
“Why are they here, JARVIS?”
He turns and his eyes are so big and dark and knowing Steve wants to be mad, wants to scream at him,
“…here’s my home address. 10880 Malibu Point, 90265. I’ll leave the door unlocked.”
Tony is agitated now, standing from the couch and throwing his hands in the air as he rants. “I can see it in the way you look at me sometimes, when I do something you don’t like or don’t agree with, your ‘here he goes again’ face, like I never learn.
It’s like that time the shrapnel dug into his chest. It feels like getting hit by a bus, stealing all the breath from his lungs and it takes him a moment before he can get air in. But somehow this is worse, because it’s Steve, it’s the man he loves saying they shouldn’t be together, and Tony knows it’s his fault, he did this, and he has to fix it,
The blue light makes Steve’s eyes glow an unearthly color as he caresses his free hand over the glass face, and Tony has to fight not to tense up, it hasn’t been all that long since Obie, after all. He thinks that if he’s managed to judge Steve that wrongly he probably deserves to have the thing yanked out of him anyway. He doesn’t think he’s wrong this time, though.
“Maybe you should apologize,” Tony suggests, and Steve laughs harshly, scrubbing the heels of his hands into his eyes. If only it were that easy.
Steve comes striding in, jaw clenched, hands fisted at his sides, and he glances around the room before he catches sight of Tony sitting on the edge of the bed, palms resting on the sheets to either side of his body, staring at the floor between his shoes. Tony’s shoulders tense as he hears Steve make his way over, boots clunking loudly on the hardwood.
"Don't look at me like that, he is. He should have waited for backup. Guess it caught up to you this time," he says, directing the last at Tony. Pepper turns back to Tony but doesn't argue, and he wants to apologize for doing this to her, to all of them, he so stupid and he never learns and he'll always hurt the people he cares about. God he's so emotional right now.
Steve snorts, rolls his eyes. “Tony.”
“Tony, I’d really like you to consider rejoining the team—“
“You’re not even listening—“
Cap looks up at that. His gaze is steady and measuring. “Tony. Thank you for what you’ve done for me, and for helping with Bucky. It’s more than enough.” He stands, readying himself to leave. Tony stands along with him.
"I can't let them die when I can do something about it," he says with finality. He hears Pepper sigh, and he thinks that it's a good thing they broke up, he'd hate himself even more than he already does if he'd done this to her again while they were still together. He squeezes her hand, and Rhodey's hand stays on his shoulder, a comforting weight.
Peter hesitated before deciding to tell the truth. "It does... So bad."
So Peter recounted the parts he could remember. The way he technically murdered his Aunt May, the way he had feelings for boys, the way he was thinking of making slight changes to his appearance to seem less masculine, and the way he'd partaken in explicit sexual acts with men, including the way Rumlow had taken him against his will.
Tony, the little fucking slut that he was, wasted zero time in trying to bounce on Steve's cock, but Steve wasn't having it just yet. He gripped the man's hips to slow him down and they started up a slow, sensual pace that had Tony nearly fucking drooling at how good he felt.
Peter looked over the clothes and shook his head. "Save the shirt, I don't care about the rest."
"What are you doing to me?"
TW: gore, mutilation, abuse, murder/death. This episode contains more details of how May died.
Bucky noticed the busted lip and saw the bruise out of the corner of Peter's sunglasses. Peter had already made it past him, but not past the others. "Natalia."
"Hey, Petey."
"No! I can't believe that you can still be this stupid, even with all of the Ph.D.'s you have."
"Oh, but you do, Peter. You know you do, I can feel it. You deserve it for what you've done to me, you know you do."
Tony didn't really know the true extent of Peter's injuries until he saw the x-rays. And even then he wasn't prepared for the surface damage the fight had inflicted on Peter.
She took a half-step forward and paused, thinking about what Wade said yesterday, about how she might not belong here. She took a full step backward. Then another.
Too tired to give a damn about any kind of comment made about his appearance, he nodded and put his pillow on the floor. He curled up and pulled his blanket so it covered his whole body, just the way he liked and let his eyes droop closed.
"Wade, hurry, please, please..."
Three days after Peter's rescue, he's sitting in the living area of the Avenger's base with Wanda and reading a book. He thinks that she's nice. She reads to him and lets him help her cook. She even shows him her magic every time he asks. They've bonded over the whole,
Getting something really had been the last thing on Wade's mind, but he'd be a liar if he said he didn't fucking miss Peter's velvet lips around him. The fact that Peter wanted to do that of his own accord was really something, especially after what he's been through.
He hesitated before whispering something else in Russian that Steve obviously didn't understand. He was learning, but at the same pace as Peter, so there was a ton he didn't know. Natasha, goddess that she is, however, had no problem translating. It kinda sounded like music to hear her talk over Bucky's deep voice speaking Russian to her.
He knew how to throw his weight around, and when his body collided with the other kid's, they went straight to the floor.
"That is only a bonus, should you accept. My offer still exists if he does not wish to assist. "
Peter shook all thoughts from his mind. The last thing he needed to think about was Tony fucking Stark. He doubted Tony was actually looking for him, to begin with. He probably had Friday running all the scenarios and diagnostics and statistics on everything. Friday was probably pinging his cell and calculating the percentage of Peter coming home safely. It was likely that all Tony was doing is telling Friday to look for Peter.
So when Bucky first approached him in the bedroom after he'd become part of the group and told him to kneel, Tony didn't hesitate to drop down onto his knees and shut his mouth. He was quicker then, but since he seems to have forgotten his place.
Wade was getting angrier now, especially knowing that he'd been given such a strong date-rape drug. He stepped closer to the kid, demanding to know what time they drugged Peter, to begin with. The soberest of the little group answered from the door, her voice meek. She said it'd only been maybe 45 minutes since they slipped it into his cup. Even the smaller doses of GHB could last up to 4 hours. Knowing this, he demanded once more- and none too gently- to know how much they gave him. She said it was a little more than he would need because he's smaller than the people the others usually dose up.
Peter watches the way that Wade raises his hairless brow and frowns. "Is that all you think you are? A joke?"
Sam felt horrible about this whole thing. He'd taken to blaming himself the moment Bucky revealed that Peter had even been injured in the first place. Peter swung between Sam and the Hydra agent. Based on the way the gun was angled, Sam wouldn't have made it out of there alive. Sam's life had been saved by a tiny 15-year-old in spandex and he'd never been more grateful and saddened at the same time.
With that, the pair dropped down out of the window and out of sight, leaving Peter confused, and with some very big choices to make.
She followed the older man around and they continued to search for Peter together, and when they found him, Wade was ready to kill everyone in the room too.
Everything started to go dark, but he fought to keep his eyes open. He saw Wade be lifted to his feet by men in black suits. Wade pulled the blade slowly from his chest.
"Last year... There was this girl I liked, and her dad... He was a bad guy. Stole all kinds of tech, remade it, and then sold it... I didn't have my suit at the time, so I was basically wearing sweats and a hoodie, and... I took a lot of damage... Lots of bruising, um... We crashed a plane, and I was thrown a good couple hundred feet... I was in so much pain I didn't want to move, but I knew I had to..."
Eddie shrugged. "We had a feeling."
Wade stood and effortlessly carried Peter back into the bedroom.
The clanking of a familiar suit filled their ears and Peter looked around in terror before Tony appeared at the bottom of the stairs. His helmet opened and Peter screamed and hid his face in Bucky's chest. Tony tried to talk, but it just sent Peter farther into a panic before Nat dragged him back up the stairs, just far enough to be out of Peter's line of sight.
He shifted and let his arm slide across the back of Peter's leg, reaching out and easily grabbing hold of Peter's throat. Peter fucking wailed and let his head roll back, fingers loosely gripping Wade's arm.
Wade, like a Saint, smiled and without Peter saying a word, said, "I know what you're thinking. If you want to stop, we can. If you want to keep going we can. If you want to leave all of your clothes on, you can. I want you to be comfortable with me."
Peter had such soft skin, and Wade already missed holding him. He missed kissing him and brushing his lips along the line of Peter's bones.
"Are you ready to cum again baby?"
She asked if everything was okay, and he said yes, they were, for now. He pulled up a chair as she brought up the signal and he sat at the table and watched that little dot travel across the map... All the while, praying that his little boy would make it home safely.
And Wade's expression softened and he just smiled as he pulled Peter into a hug, the only hug he'd let himself be part of in a while. "Of course I did. Nothing's too good for you, remember?"
Peter might not ever say anything to Mr. Stark about it, but he was truly so very thankful for everything... He knew that without Mr. Stark, he probably wouldn't be alive right now... Little did Peter know that without him, Tony might not be alive right now either.
All she had to do for him was get him the names of all of these kids, where they kept their stash and their ages. And then she had to swear she'd tell the cops all she knew if it came down to it, even if it meant she might get in trouble too, and she swore instantly. In return, he wouldn't threaten her with bodily harm and wouldn't mention her as one of the bad kids to the cops, if they even got involved in the first place.
Wade shook his head and laughed a little as he grabbed Peter's butt. "Nothing is too good for you, Petey baby."
It was nice to see them all together, all getting along despite everything. But it wasn't hard to see the way that Steve looked at the others. He looked almost jealous of the way that Tony and Bruce were cuddled up to one another, all happy and shit, drinking hot chocolates with smiles on their faces. But when Steve caught their eyes, he smiled. Because he was happy for them, truly, no matter how badly it hurt.
Once they're alone, Pepper asks if his clothes actually didn't fit. He says that he lied and they do fit, but he lied because he didn't want Tony to judge him.
Eddie offered Bucky a half ate candy bar from his jacket pocket. It was slightly warm, a little bent, but it was probably all they had until Wade returned from wherever the hell he managed to escape to.
The room was large. Giant walls of wet stone stretched out into the space where the lights would not reach. Crates upon crates of weapons lined these walls, the words 'fragile' and 'explosives' stamped onto the side of each one.
"Well, Miss Potts is really good with makeup, maybe she wouldn't mind coming with us and helping us out, hm?"
Bucky dismounted the bike and walked around a little bit, gun drawn and ready to fire... Until he noticed something blinking on the ground. He raced over to it, only to discover that it was Peter's watch.
'I just wanted to be like you.' He had told Mr. Stark... Mr. Stark just stared at him, like he was an idiot. He looked at Peter like all he really wanted to do was kick him off of the rooftop they were standing on. He looked so angry that he had to come and save the day, and Peter knew why. Tony didn't like having to clean up after Peter. That's why when Vulture had crashed the plane, he was quick to clear out of the area. He knew Mr. Stark was going to look for him, but Peter managed to avoid him well enough Tony had started to wonder if he'd bled out somewhere.
Bucky just stared. "Don't tell me what to do."
The boy that checked them out didn't even seem fazed, but that's most likely because he was much busier checking Peter out anyways. Peter was too engrossed in his story to notice, he was telling Pepper that he's supposed to have a date with a guy-not boy-a guy. He was wondering if she knew why everyone seemed so... Allowing of their relationship if Wade was supposed to be a bad guy.
Tony looked down at the teen where he slept. He was curled up into a tight ball, blankets bunched at the foot of his bed. He shook his head and pulled the covers over Peter and sat on the end of the bed with his back against the wall. He watched the web-slinger as he slept, strands of hair falling into his face and sighed.
All Peter had was his self-designed webs and the fear of death drilled into his brain.
He shook his head. "I refuse to leave him here. Stark's got him trapped down here like some kinda animal. S'not human and it sure as hell ain't fair."
Peter's parents give him space, leaving just him and Wade together to try and process everything that's happened to them.
"Obviously he knows he can take a bullet."
Bucky didn't say anything, he knew that he didn't have to. Within moments Peter was relaxed enough to curl up and close his eyes. Bucky sat with him for the rest of the night, and only when the sun came up did he leave.
Absently Peter wondered if he'd be able to get tattoos with his healing powers, but as Wade started trying to get Peter out of his sweater, he decided that he didn't care about that right now. All he cared about in this second was having sex with Wade, and maybe that was bad, but if being good meant not feeling good then Peter would rather be bad.
Scott's heart breaks for the four parents of this boy, and for the boy himself. He's been kidnapped and probably horribly tortured. Even on top of that, he spent his birthday surrounded by Hydra agents with guns. He knows he'd go to the ends of the Earth to kill anyone that laid a hand on Cassie.
This feels good, it feels right. He's missed this companionship, having people around him that he likes and that genuinely like him in return. His company lately has consisted of greasy business men at board meetings that have never thought he was good enough to take over from his dad, and the SI R&D department, who are either too busy resenting his genius to pay attention to anything he has to say, or so in love with his genius that they spend the whole time he talks nodding and drooling and not actually paying attention to anything he says.
Steve half-shrugs, says, “I could eat,” and Tony nods decisively.
Tony lets out a relieved laugh. Steve
Tony sprawls bonelessly across one couch, legs askew and head thrown back, and leaves Steve to settle on the other. The music is loud, the bass line so deep Steve can feel it pulsing throughout his entire body along with the beat of the music. People push through the crowds to reach the bars, waiting in line for overpriced cocktails, but they’re removed from it in their little corner. Steve can’t relax, exactly, but he is glad that Tony decided on the VIP section, for his paranoia’s sake at the very least.
, and
“Yes, Mr. Stark, sounds about right,” he sighs. He glances at the couch behind him. “Mind if I take a seat?”
There are voices he doesn’t recognize talking about medical things, a lot of it not in English, but he’s too drowsy to make sense of any of it. There’s Steve, and other voices he knows he should remember, talking to each other and occasionally to him. Through it all, the pressure never lets up on his right hand, and he squeezes when he remembers to, because squeezing is what he’s supposed to do if there’s a hand in his, he’s sure of it.
The Captain rubs his eyes with his fingers, presses steadily against the lids. “Mr. Stark—“
"Never thought I'd be the one telling you to be patient and make plans, eh?" Tony laughs, pulling his hand away and shaking his head.
She spits something in Russian, which he's pretty sure isn't an endearment, and puts the soup bowl down with a clang.
Tony’s just finished loading the dishes into the dishwasher (he doesn’t even have to wash them, they have a fucking dishwasher, how hard can it be?) when Friday speaks again.
"Tony," he's pleading. He doesn't know when he started talking. All he knows is he's got one hand holding Tony's blood inside his body and another running through his hair in some weak gesture of comfort, for him or for Tony, he doesn't know, he's not sure it matters. "Tony, can you hear me? Tony, please answer me. Please." His voice is breaking, his eyesight is blurred. Where the hell is Bruce?
“No, I’m not sorry,” he says, smiling.
He pushes himself up off the couch unsteadily, Steve stepping back to give him room. He shakes his head a bit to clear it, then sets off across the room toward the bar. Knocking back the last of his drink, he pours himself another.
12:24 am:
He's seen death, and it always hurts, a hollow ache in his core, but there's something about seeing Tony fly into it willingly that about tears his heart out.
It’s amazing, it’s wonderful, and it’s probably the happiest Tony’s ever been in his life, if he’s honest with himself. He and Steve have so much fun together, and it’s crazy because Tony can’t really remember the last time he had actual
“Not so bad yourself, Stark,” Steve says, smiling. Maybe this will be fun. He won’t be able to enjoy it the same way Tony will, but he can keep Tony company when he obviously needs to blow off a little steam. And he can always leave when he’s had enough; Tony’s a grown man and certainly doesn’t need Steve as an annoyingly sober chaperone.
Or it could possibly be Steve himself, quiet and confident in the way he holds himself, friendly and welcoming. He’s only known the guy for going on ten minutes, but he can tell he’s good people. He knows things like that, he’s a good judge of character. (Obie doesn’t count; Obie’s a whole other story with all kinds of father-figure-shaped baggage, so he doesn’t really need to come into play here.)
"Sorry, Buck. It's just... He's in a pretty bad way. I'm just..." He trails off.
Tony quickly finishes what he’s doing in the lab and closes it down before turning back to give Steve his full attention. “Okay,” he says, clapping his hands together once, sauntering over toward Steve. “First things first: Do you have clothes?”
Granted, Steve’s idea of fun isn’t exactly the same as Tony’s, so maybe he’s right in assuming that Steve doesn’t want in on this particular adventure, but Steve’s still a little miffed at the implication that he’s a grumpy, boring old man. He may have come out of the ice a different person, but that doesn’t mean he’s a complete wet blanket.
"I was thinking I had to save them, Rhodey," he says as forcefully as he can manage. He has to take a second, his throat wants to spasm and he really doesn't want to cough again. "I'm sorry I worried you, I really am, but it was that or watch them all get taken out one by one. I made a call."
Tony nods, face pressed into Steve’s neck. He opens his mouth, closes it. Huffs out a breath. Tries again. “Steve—“
Natasha drops and spins around, leg out, and a Doombot crashes to the ground before she gets her Widow’s bites in it and it spazzes to it’s electrical death. He hears Hulk roar in the distance, hopes he’s smashing these fuckers good.
They say nothing for a minute or two, before Steve speaks again. “It gets better,” he says gently.
She turns and looks at him, eyes somehow sad and hard at the same time.
Tony stares, mouth hanging open. Is Steve… Jealous? “Steve, what the fuck? Of course I still talk to Pepper, she’s the CEO of my company, for fuck’s sake. She’s my friend. We may have called off the whole dating thing, but she’s not going anywhere if I can help it. I don’t have the patience to do half the shit she does, she better not go anywhere,” Tony trails off jokingly, trying to lighten the mood.
That reminds him. "Where's Barnes?" He asks. He hadn't really thought about the Winter Soldier since he woke up... He'd been more concerned with his team and his own injuries, the whole reason for their mission had slipped his mind.
They’d had dinner last night together, the whole group of them, and Steve was honestly glad to see Tony again. It’s the first time he’s seen him since he left after Ultron a couple of months ago, and while the new team has started to mesh, it’s not the same. There was something young and innocent and familial about the first Avengers team, all living in the tower together, and Steve knows Tony played a huge part in that.
“Steve,” he says, voice hoarse with sleep, or maybe with want. Heat rushes through Steve’s body at the sound of it, and he wants to hear it in darkness, in the quiet of his bedroom, just the two of them with all the time in the world to get to know each other.
He stares at his reflection, the dark bags under bloodshot eyes, the almost unrecognizable beard, the crows feet by his eyes and the smile lines by his mouth, the grey coming in at his temples. It’s an aging face, one that’s seen a lot and been through a lot, and one that used to be happy. Used to think he’d finally earned some sort of peace.
Panting, Tony just nods, giving the okay to whatever question Steve is asking, and then Steve’s looking down at his chest, straight at the reactor.
Tony wears black, because there is nothing to celebrate here. Nothing to celebrate about his husband and infant son being taken from him so forcibly. Nothing to celebrate about two such beautiful souls being ripped from this world before their time.
“When’s the last time you ate something?”
“Sure, I’m done.”
There’s a burst of warm, coffee-scented air when he steps inside and he breathes it in deep, his body shivering joyously. The aroma wafting from behind the counter is phenomenal. The cafe is cute, little stuffed armchairs and larger couches surround low coffee tables. The walls are painted a warm brownish-red, hung with paintings of mugs of tea and overflowing bags of coffee beans. There’s even a quilt nailed to one wall, which makes him think of a grandmother’s house, comforting and warm and some place a person can go to just relax and put all their problems on hold and hide from the world. Not
He nods, then turns and heads for the door, raising his newspaper in a casual wave to the barista, who waves back genially and wishes him a Happy New Year.
Tony picks a spot on the opposite side of the bar, almost directly across from where Steve’s sitting. He orders a bourbon when the bartender asks what he’ll have, and Steve winces inwardly. It’s never a good day when Tony goes straight to the hard stuff.
"Steven!" Thor called. "How go these scrambled eggs you Midgardians are so fond of?"
like Captain America's gorgeous mystery date? You know, the sexy one he's been seen around town with several times in the past couple weeks."
"You're a fucking sap, you know that?"
"You OK?" Steve asked and put a hand on his shoulder, all the annoyance wiped away and only concern left etched upon his face.
He pulled his hand back from the bookcase and tucked it around the toddler again, holding her as though he was the only one standing between her and pure evil. He squared his jaw and, though he was already taller than Tony, stood to his full height and said, low and with as much grave warning in his voice as he could muster, "Who are you?"
Tony struggled to sit up some, but with Steve looming over him like he was, he wasn't going anywhere.  "What? Why?"
"Uh…good to know," Tony said as they went over to the elevator together.
" He turned his ire on Steve. "
He was standing in front of the mirror, rinsing his mouth out, when he remembered why he and Steve had even gotten out of the city in the first place, and he frowned and shut the light off and went back downstairs to ask Natasha if it had blown over, only to see that both she and Wilson had left, and only Bruce and Thor remained, talking quietly, Bruce's face pinched in concern while Thor sat looking somber and contemplative. They both looked up as Tony approached, and Bruce smiled some and said, "Aren't you supposed to be in bed?"
"Oh, I see how it is. You want to lift Thor's hammer, don't you?"
taste like coffee, and set it back down.
be the ones having a pissing contest with each other?"
He would never be there again to leave his dirty clothes in a pile on the floor or backwash into the orange juice or refuse to stack the dishwasher. He would never be there again to tease Tony about his height or try to make excuses for himself by playing up his age or guilt people into apologizing just by staring at them.
Tony watched as he nodded and said, "Uh huh," his face going from concern to eye-rolling annoyance. "Seriously?" he asked and pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. "I thought this was important…I mean
"Happy insisted," Pepper said and relaxed into the seat.
Tony sighed and went into the bedroom, and he shucked off his club attire and was tempted to just crawl into his pajamas and into bed, but he could still
Steve nodded. "I have every intention of doing so."
sit here and cry my eyes out about it. I cried at a goddamned Kay Jewelers commercial the other day, for god's sake!"
Steve shrugged and sat down in the chair opposite him. "Got hungry," he said and grabbed one of the burgers that remained. He handed Tony his shake and his soda, and Tony stuck a straw in each and went to sip the soda—
Tony rolled his eyes. "Oh, do you really have to ask?" he muttered and held up his left hand, one decorated with a simple gold band on his ring finger. Steve glanced down to his own hand and considered the ring there.
"A while back—
Bruce's mouth twitched a bit before he grimaced a little and said, "Your
"I think you guys are too old for that," Bruce offered from the back.
To be honest, weather-wise, it was a miserable day. It was relatively warm for that time of year, but the gray clouds of morning had opened up by that afternoon, drenching the city in a torrent of rainfall with the occasional rumble of thunder overhead. Though the initial downpour had subsided, a steady sprinkling of droplets remained, and a quick check of the weather on Rhodey's phone showed a bright-green splotch covering the Doppler image, one that did not look like it was about to clear out any time soon.
“Heyyy Capsicle. Grab a sit. Grab a seat. Sit down,” he slurs. He’s pretty far gone at this point. He hasn’t drank so much so fast since after Obie tried to kill him. He shakes his head, vision swinging sharply. He doesn’t really like to think about that. New subject, please.
do that to you again.”
He crashes into Rhodey’s arms, and they’re holding each other up, shaking apart together.
“We’ve managed to stabilize her, she’s out of the woods for now. There was some significant damage to her lungs, so we have her attached to a breathing tube at the moment. Some broken bones, which were the least serious of her injuries.” The doctor pauses, takes a breath, then goes on. “There was also severe damage to her skull, with swelling and bleeding in her brain. It’s stopped, now, but we won’t know the effects, if there are any, until she wakes up. Which could take hours or days, I don’t have an answer for that, I’m sorry,” he says before Tony can even ask.
He breathes deep, taking in the scent of mint and leather and musk, committing it to memory.
Tony’s another year older, living the same old life, when he decides to visit HQ for the first time since he left all those months ago. Steve’s out with Bucky at a Met’s game, so it’s the perfect time, if there is such a thing. Rhodey’s asked him to come, check out the facility and the upgrades they’ve made to it, so he gives in and drives upstate one Saturday afternoon before he thinks on it too much.
The view inside the saferoom clears slightly and Tony hears shouting and the ring of vibranium, Steve’s shield slicing through the air. Steve takes down four agents before one gets a lucky shot in, bullet ripping into his calf. He falls to one knee, still flinging his shield furiously around the room, ricocheting off walls and into the heads of the intruders. There’s a pile of bodies by the door, but there are too many crowding into the room, and another bullet catches Steve in the shoulder. Jamie is screaming his head off in the corner of the room and Tony’s heart clenches so tight in his chest he thinks he might actually be having a heart attack. Ten more seconds, his readouts tell him, he will be there in ten seconds, please, please don’t be too late…
Rhodey’s the next one they send to come get him. Makes sense, he’s Tony’s best friend. Maybe they think he can talk Tony out of his funk. Tony wants to roll his eyes but doesn’t have the energy. He’s pretty sure he’s not coming out of this one intact.
“Problem?” Tony sneers back, sarcastic. “I don’t have a problem. No problem at all. Just, you know, you coming to your boyfriend’s penthouse to tell him you’re leaving on a dangerous mission for an unspecified amount of time so you can go find your other, better boyfriend. No problem, though, I understand.” Tony takes a sip of his scotch, eyes burning.
Steve smiles slightly. "He's in Germany. Somewhere outside of Munich."
“Though, you know, I could have bought the whole bar if I’d been so inclined,” Tony continues, and god, the way the man can make him want to hug him and punch him at the same time really is something else. It takes everything in him not to snort and roll his eyes like Steve would have, before.
"Hey, Cap, just the man I wanted to see," he says brightly. "I'm working on improvements to your uniform. Those lasers got through the suit pretty easily, so I've been messing around with the alloys weaved into the material and I think I've got something that can absorb that type of energy instead of just repel it, and if I create a kind of storage device then you can use it.. to..." He trails off when he catches the look on Steve's face. He sighs, only wincing slightly.
Steve comes back to the Tower the following weekend, this time with Nat’s uniform in his duffel. He tells Tony that the upgrades he made to the Captain America uniform were amazing and asks if maybe Tony could incorporate some of that into Black Widow’s catsuit as well? Tony spends a couple hours fixing it up, then the rest of the weekend in bed with Steve.
He pummels the punching bag but it refuses to budge, leaving him feeling wound up and unsatisfied. It’s reinforced, like everything else in the gym, made strong by Tony’s genius, strong enough to stand up to repeated abuse by super soldiers and Norse gods and everything else the Avengers can throw at them (though Tony has asked Natasha and Clint to practice their shooting and knife skills in the range and save the bags for the “gym rats”).
Tony laughs, then groans when it jostles his injuries. Pepper is there immediately, smoothing his hair back from his forehead and making soft noises, glaring at Clint. Clint doesn't look remotely sorry.
It’s starting to make sense now. They sent the team out of the tower, but kept Tony around to lull Bruce into a false sense of security. Only two Avengers to fight, instead of six, and one couldn’t afford to turn green without hurting the other.
Steve whirls around and Tony hastily stumbles back a few steps, arms raising defensively.
“Tony!” He chuckles at Steve’s horrified tone of voice, and looks back up as he strides over to the pair of them. Steve rolls his eyes and smiles, shaking his head, a faint blush on his pale cheeks. Reaching them, he leans down to kiss the top of Jamie’s head, then catches Tony’s lips on his way back up.
“Get out,” he says instead. Steve’s jaw ticks but he doesn’t move. He opens his mouth but Tony doesn’t care what he has to say. “OUT, Steve.” Friday slides open the glass door behind him, and Steve turns without another word and walks out.
“Steve, what the fuck?” Tony tries to push his hand away, but he’s weak compared to Steve’s serum-enhanced body.
Steve smirks. “That and an upgrade to my suit. The guys at HQ try, but it somehow never fits right when they’re done with it. You do it best,” Steve says, pouting with big, sad eyes. Tony doesn’t fall for it for one second. Okay, maybe for a second.
“Well, for what it’s worth, I think you did an amazing thing, stopping weapons development. There are enough weapons in the world already. You’re very brave for standing up for what you believe in.”
“Wow, Cap, you clean up nice.”
He can’t honestly say he’s surprised.
Tony nearly growls, slamming the dishwasher door closed and drying his hands on the hand towel next to the sink before stomping out of the kitchen.
Yinsen hums again, this time looking up at Tony through his glasses. “I believe that what’s coming will come. I have faith in my God and in his justice.” Tony wants to snort, but this whole kidnapping thing may have changed the way he looks at his life, he’s not sure yet but it’s possible. He still might not believe in God or anything like that, but he’s got this vague concept of karma in the back of his mind, that he’s getting what he deserves for what he’s done all his life, even if it was in ignorance. Someone has to be held accountable for it, all the horrors and deaths and wars. He’s under no delusions that he’s a good man, he knows he’s much closer to the opposite, and this might be his punishment. His karma.
“I’m sorry, Tony, I’m so sorry—“ Steve gets out before his voice chokes off. He turns and all but runs to the waiting elevator, and Tony doesn’t actually see him leave through his own tears.
His heart clenches in his chest and it’s suddenly hard to take a breath. It’s like he’s still got the arc reactor in his chest, like his lungs are still diminished and he can’t breathe as deeply as he needs to.
And now he never would be able to be that for Tony. Not after everything he’s done, the lies he’d told to protect himself. Because who was he kidding, he wasn’t protecting Tony with that. He wasn't even protecting Bucky. He was nothing but a coward, afraid to face the truth, afraid of the consequences. He’d never even given Tony a chance, not until it was too late.
Tony’s eyes flicker and his face softens. He takes a step toward Steve, and another, reaching out until he can grip Steve’s arm in his callused hand.
Steve stops him. “No, no, everything’s fine. I just wanted to thank you again for all your help, and see if you were hungry, maybe.”
The friend and Tony settle on the other couch, while the woman in red sits down next to Steve and reaches out to touch his shoulder, leaning in to speak into his ear. She smells like vodka and floral perfume, and her voice is sultry and deep, with the tiniest hint of an eastern European accent.
Tony immediately shakes the thought out of his head, letting his hands drop back into his lap. Steve’s right. It’s not the time, especially for Tony. Maybe, if it wasn’t for all the trouble with SI, if he wasn’t dying from palladium poisoning. But there is trouble, and he is dying. It was good, it was perfect, and hopefully it’s enough to get him through whatever comes next.
The nurses exchange looks, though the doctor just nods in confirmation. “Yes, in your last Avengers fight. You fell some distance, though you were wearing the Iron Man suit at the time, which prevented any major injuries.”
He showers for the first time in days, and it feels sinfully good, and he feels guilty for enjoying it but shoves the thought from his mind and goes through the motions anyway. After the shower he takes a razor to his stubble, managing to clean it up enough that he no longer looks like a homeless man, and he cleans and bandages his swollen hand carefully.
He shrugs, then replies lightly, “It’s happy hour. I’ve had a long week.”
Steve’s got a possessive side. It’s not a surprise, Tony’s seen it in battle when he was still an Avenger. He’s like a papa bear, prowling and making sure all his cubs are safe and right where they’re supposed to be. Any unannounced change in plans and he’s twitchy and tense, voice short over comms demanding why Tony’s not in position, and Tony knows it comes from a good place, a place where he’s worried and scared and he just doesn’t know how to deal with losing someone again.
Steve looks down at Tony silently before he sits on the coffee table in front of him, knees touching Tony’s.
“Widow, get to him. You don’t leave his side,” Steve orders. "Hawkeye, keep shooting."
Tony groans. He’s not really in any shape for guests, but it’s just Steve. “Thanks, Fri.”
"I love you too."
“Tony, I love you,” Steve’s voice breaks. Sam steps forward to put a firm hand on his shoulder. Steve takes a deep breath. “I think we need to take some time off, to figure this out. I can see what I’m doing to you, and I need to straighten myself out before I can trust myself to be around you again.”
“And you didn’t say no.” Steve’s voice is hollow, empty.
“Sure, no problem. I mean, yeah, JARVIS already has an alert set for any time something Winter-Soldier-esque pops up, so I can just have him let you know too. It’s really not a favor at all, it’s adding another, like, three lines of code. Seriously.” Tony shakes his head. Drinks some more. “Did you need anything else? Like, an actual favor? Something I can actually help you with? I mean, even outside of the whole Barnes thing. What are you doing? You don’t even have a job anymore, do you. Do you even have a place to live?”
