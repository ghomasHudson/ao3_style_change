“Are you… happy with this arrangement?” Castiel had to ask.
Castiel’s breath caught. “Yes—I… Dean—really?”
The smile that crossed Dean’s face was neither happy nor relieved. “I’m still paying you, Cas. It’s different. It imbalances us. You should save your first time for someone you love. In my opinion.”
Castiel watched the dark red car drive away, headlights flashing over the other cars in the parking lot. It passed over a sleek black car with Illinois plates that made Castiel blink.
Dean was
“Need some help there, Cas?” Dean’s voice was low and gravelly. Castiel instinctually pressed his knees together when his erection reached a point of straining against the material of his pants.
“And here’s the boyfriend. Tough breakup, I heard.” That voice from the wings. Though Dean knew it wasn’t Castiel’s, when a dark-haired figure strode out, it was definitely him. A lazy sort of sick smile was plastered across Cas’s face, one that Dean had never seen there before. Being in a corporeal form made the spirit a lot more vocal, it seemed.
Dean sneered. “Shut up.”
“About 11:30. Told ya I’d only be gone about an hour or so.” Dean dropped a suit jacket across the glass-topped coffee table and sat heavily in a chair across from Castiel, propping his feet up on the tabletop. “You still wanna talk?”
The billionaire shrugged. “Could be anything. Top of the line paints, a new suit… a car.”
Dean backpedaled. “I mean, of course I’ll still pay for stuff. I don’t have all this money for nothing.” He paused. “I just… don’t want it to be why you’re around… if that makes sense.”
He yanked hard against the handcuffs.
True to form, Dean cracked a smile. “In a very watered-down, skewed sense, I guess there will be some ordering around. Did ya get that from a tv show?”
“Winchester Holdings prides itself on doing the ethical thing in every case, right? Stand up for the little guy. How is this gonna look in front of an ethics court, do you think, Viv?”
“Do you want me to go?” Castiel hoped against hope that Dean wouldn’t send him away. It would certainly be easier to. Dean could write the whole thing off as a mistake, say he met Castiel at a bar and only wanted a one-time thing. He might even be able to spin it in a way that sounded like Castiel had extorted the money, break any ties he had with Castiel to save his company’s reputation. Castiel could leave the city, leave the Institute, change his name. He didn’t really want to leave Dean, Mr. Guerrero, and the whole of Chicago behind… but he also couldn’t bear to see Dean humiliated.
a romantic at heart.
Castiel takes a dick for the first time in his life... or not.
Dean shrugged. “Could be for a hundred reasons. Wrongful death, improper burial, wonky furniture arrangement. I’ve literally seen it all.” This wasn’t a lie. Dean once had to find and burn the remains of a ghost that was so upset with the layout of her former home, she ripped herself from the afterlife and came after the new owners in a fit of tacky brocade fabrics and ornate curtain tassels. Not the kind of case you talk about with your buddies at the hunters’ bar afterwards.
“Like, is there stubble?” He forced himself to look at Cas, even though the blush on his face was likely the same color as the Dos Equis neon sign behind him. “F-from his beard?”
“Me.” He said louder.
“Well, not everyone...” Dean muttered, mostly to himself.
“You’re spending too much time at that law office. Startin’ to go impotent.” Dean said, earning him a throw pillow to the face. He cackled in response.
“Yeah? Sure sounds like you like this, baby. Makin’ so much noise for me, tellin’ me you like it so much. God, you’re so fucking gorgeous like this. And you don’t even know.” Dean murmured while painting his thighs and hips with marks.
Like lightning, Dean wrapped a hand around Castiel’s cock and laid a kiss on his mouth that made the room spin. For all that Castiel was feeling smug about making Dean come quickly, it had nothing on the minuscule time that Dean had Castiel spurting in his hand. Castiel blamed it on getting so worked up by watching Dean.
Unsurprisingly, spirits were actually more apt to appear in the darkness, rather than total light. Dean hadn’t dealt with more than a handful of spirits that were comfy enough to grab someone in broad daylight. More stupid teenagers had seen their first (and sometimes last) ghost simply by not using common sense in reportedly haunted houses or bone yards.
Dean was hesitating, trying to talk himself out of it. Castiel used his position pressed to Dean to rub up against him, getting an erection rather quickly with Dean’s scent and warmth all around him. Dean must have felt it, because he groaned quietly, his own pants getting a bit tight. “Cas, I really think this is a bad idea—“
He thinks about things. He thinks about blue eyes; cast downwards in sorrow, flaring in anger, empty with pain. He thinks about colors, splashed on a canvas and hung on his wall in a tribute to his inability to communicate how he feels to another person who is equally bad at knowing what he’s feeling. He also thinks about the particular shade of blue that’s missing from his garage. He thinks about how he can’t seem to get the timeline for giving gifts right. He thinks about how giving a car to someone else didn’t quite go how he pictured, and now he doesn’t even have the delight of seeing it parked next to his own Impala, like it belonged there. He thinks about the envelope in the glove compartment of a blue car that he goes half-crazy wondering if it’s been opened yet or not, thrown away in a fit of rage, or kept in a nightstand somewhere in hope. He thinks about how stupid it was to leave it just in the glovebox, instead of in his desk or somewhere he wouldn’t have to regret not taking it. He thinks about how he should have found a better way to tell someone how he feels than by a stupid piece of paper folded into a lame security envelope.
“And remember, any time you feel even the slightest bit uncomfortable with what we’re doing, you have to tell me. I won’t sign unless you promise to keep me in the loop, okay?” Castiel nodded and reached for the pen. Dean pulled it away and got right in his face, “Promise me, Castiel. Make sure you mean it.”
“You understand we can’t afford to have that kind of… attention focused on the Institute, especially before the Gala at the end of the semester.”
My man Vonnegut once gave me some writing advice that boiled down to "make terrible things happen to your favorite characters." Buckle up, kids. I got plans.
Dean only allowed himself three seconds to catch his breath again before he swung his head around, looking for a way down. His eyes alighted on the fly ropes on the side of the stage. He mentally calculated his chances of not dying and mentally shrugged. He had to get to Cas. He steadied himself on the edge, before taking a flying leap to the fly rope. He caught it in steady hands and shimmied down none too gracefully. When he hit the ground, he shook off the rope burn and took a second to douse the still-smoldering pile of ashes where the hat had been. Once it was out, he took off towards the dressing rooms and the scene shop at the back of the stage. He’d seen Cas crawl this way after he’d gotten down from the catwalk. He had to find him. Had to know he was safe, had to see—
Dean’s thrusts were speeding up and losing regularity. He seemed to be close to losing it, close to the level where Cas had been simmering for what seemed like forever. Castiel ran the hand not groping the hell out of Dean’s ass over his abdomen, reveling in the way the muscles jumped. Feeling brave, he moved his hand down and closed it around both of them. It felt strange, having two cocks in his hand. It was slick from both of them leaking precome and about as hot to the touch as his skin felt. He stroked once, twice, and felt himself topple over the edge. He groaned into Dean’s mouth and Dean pulled back to watch him lose it, keeping his thrusts regular, working him through it.
Alfie heaved himself over the wall, just in time to hear an engine revving from somewhere unseen. He glanced back at the road, thinking one of the reporters had gotten fed up with the nonsense and left in a huff. The revving got closer, causing Alfie to whip his head around towards the house. He saw a streak of black fly towards the gate. The unmistakable sound of metal hitting metal, followed by the squeal of twenty-five men and women as they dove out of the way of the black car smashing through the gate. Definitely not an old dude driving. Some of the reporters tripped over themselves or each other in their hurry to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, while others sat back where they had fallen on their ass and snapped pictures as fast as their shaking fingers would allow. A delighted whoop sounded from the car, audible even from where Alfie was perched. Ted Nugent’s Stranglehold was cranked up even louder from inside the vehicle, as the car fishtailed around the curve and sped out of sight. A shocked murmuring was left in the wake of the car—Winchester’s no doubt—along with an impressive cloud of dust, causing the reporters to hurriedly cover their cameras with whatever they could find.
In front of him, the man spluttered in answer. “Yes—I mean, no—I… technically. Yes. I’m in charge.”
“This isn’t the first… relationship like this I’ve had, you know.”
Dean shifted as he hooked his ankles around the legs of the chair. The wood underneath them both creaked in a worrisome way, but neither man noticed. “Gonna be late to your own fuckin’ party.” He breathed.
Dean shrugged and stuffed the last of his pancake into his mouth. He grabbed the paper that Bobby left and leafed it open. He bypassed the other sections and went straight for the comics.
Suddenly, strong fingers came up to clamp in his hair, dragging him back so Dean could look him square in the eye.
“Sure.”
“Thank you.” Castiel said, gruffly. Silence fell over them again as Mr. Winchester took a few more fries. Castiel pushed the plate towards him for something to do. He had to break the tension, “So what do you do at your company?”
Cas smiled. “Would you believe we have more in cages underneath the shop? This room wouldn’t even hold half of the furniture we have.” He glanced around and sighed. “I’m not sure how to find something that would have belonged to a spooky theater director with a vengeance, though.”
The man smiled, not unkindly. “Figured not. I’d think you were kind of stupid if you had. Name’s Dean Winchester," the man smiled widely and Castiel had to catch his breath. "I’m the CEO of Winchester Holdings, LLC.”
Even with little to no traffic on the streets of Central City, it felt like the trip down the road—ten minute commute, Cas had told him—took three times longer than it should. He parked haphazardly by a beat up blue pickup when he finally got to the school grounds and dashed inside. He also had his sawed-off in hand, but tucked safely into his jacket. He definitely couldn’t go running into a full auditorium with a gun.
Rolling his eyes, Cas refrained from commenting. But also because… “What’s that?”
Dean’s voice was strained with fear for the worst, and relief he had found him. Cas was slumped in front of him, eyes closed, leaned up against the wall of the storage room. A thin line of blood trickled from his temple and his eye was clearly starting to bruise. In his hands, he clutched the broken-off handle of what Dean assumed was once a mop. Dean dropped to his knees in front of Cas. His hands shook badly and didn’t know where to land on Cas’s body that wouldn’t cause more harm. He gingerly shook the man’s shoulder. “Cas, can you talk? Wake up, buddy.”
“Sorry. Does it say why they were let go?”
Suddenly, Castiel spun around again and pushed the door open, propping it open. He stuck his hands in his pockets and walked out to the parking lot. Dean whipped around and panicked. He should have brought a different car, this was too recognizable for a stakeout operation. He didn’t dare move as Castiel rounded on his car, eyes moving across the license plate to the body of the car. This was it. Dean was done for. Cas was going to take a swing at the car out of spite or anger, and that was even before he got his hands on Dean. Dean didn’t think Cas would actually hit him or even really shout, but he wished he would. He wished he could get some tangible punishment for this overwhelming hole he put in himself.
“Sure.” Castiel said with a smile. He tugged lightly on the cart to move them to the oil paints. He picked up a few tubes of Windsor & Newton. It wasn’t the best brand, but Castiel felt a certain degree of loyalty to these paints. They were what he learned on, after all. He picked up a bound set of quinacridone magenta, cadmium yellow, and phthalocyanine turquoise. This was how you made real colors. Bright, vivid hues that gave the canvas light and the ability to spark up any surroundings. He turned to Dean, “Yell if you see an ivory black anywhere, I need that and some  linseed oil. I should have enough white at my apartment to last me.”
“—I want you.” Dean said suddenly, his eyes getting bigger and more panicked the longer Castiel talked. Castiel smiled sadly and hushed him.
happened in the theater?”
Anna let the moment hang. She started again, quieter. “I think what I’m really struggling with is the fact that I don’t know you. I’ve seen you on TV, I googled you to see what your weirdo company actually does—apart from the salacious news stories, and you seem like an upstanding guy.” She made sure to look at him straight in the eye. “But I can’t trust that. Not when you left my best friend broken.”
Anna looked like she wanted to say something, but she instead chose to say, “That means you’re driving, then. You need anything from the apartment?”
“Fuck off, Shakespeare!” Dean yelled as he flicked the lighter. It took a few times before it caught, but when it did, he pressed himself up against the far railing of the catwalk. Oswald lunged for him, forcing Dean to lean far over, and just as he was within a hair’s breadth, the hem of his ghostly long coat caught in a flame. He staggered back, slapping at his chest in a vain attempt to quell the flames. Dean lit the hat up in a few other places before throwing it down to the stage below where it burned uninterrupted. He caught a glimpse of Cas pulling himself towards the far doors, and breathed a tiny sigh of relief. Maybe Cas would be alright enough for Dean to find him in a bit.
Dean nodded, dazed. His hands reached down to help Castiel pull the shirt all the way off. He tossed it to land somewhere near Castiel’s on the floor. Castiel grabbed Dean’s hands and pushed them down to cup his ass. He undid the zipper of his own jeans and tugged at the flaps enough to get his erection, still in his boxers, front and center, impossible to miss. Sure enough, Dean seemed to have a hard time keeping his breathing in check. When Castiel leaned into his body, grinding against him, Dean’s hands took big handfuls of his ass, pushing him forward even more. Castiel carefully kept his mouth out of the way of Dean’s just yet, even though Dean kept reaching forward for him.
Anna slumped down next to him and tossed Castiel’s phone back to him. “How does that even work? You scroll through a list of people to call Daddy and just pick one?”
Someone needed to tell Adler about saving the trees or something.
Shrugging, Dean let his head loll back for a second. “I know what your mouth tastes like.” Couldn’t get the taste of it out of his head actually. He kept replaying the first moment his lips touched Cas’s, and that brilliant electric shock that had coursed through him. He’d felt the sparks come back earlier this afternoon, and he was fighting the urge to see if that same voltage could be attained now.
“Did it say that you could dictate what I paid for, outside of the agreement of your tuition and supplies therein?”
Dean carefully kept his eyes wandering around the restaurant and didn’t fixate on Castiel for too long. Castiel didn’t take it as a very good sign, and tried to keep his features looking pleasant, and not pouty, even though all he wanted was to grab Dean by his too-straight collar and demand to be taken right there.
“Huh?” Dean answered, sounding completely wrecked.
my poor baby. So neglected while I was gone?” Castiel couldn’t answer because he couldn't feel his tongue. “That’s okay, this isn’t going to take long. I can tell.” Dean grinned wolfishly and swallowed him down. Castiel keened, his mouth falling open. He squirmed, trying to get away, trying to get closer, he didn’t know. His eyebrows knit together, hands clenching into fists beside him. Dean’s hands came around to cup his ass, pulling more of Castiel into his mouth.
“And take your pants all the way off.” Dean’s voice came from somewhere near the cabinets by the kitchen part of the basement.
Castiel heard her take a breath and hoped she wasn’t gearing up for another screaming match. His phone was on 17% after all.
Dean knew he’d have to throw that dildo away. Castiel was sure to leave him when he found out what he’d done, and he'd appreciate as few reminders of what could have been as he could manage. He couldn’t save the blue angel, and for that, he had to work with what he had.
Dean nodded and the crinkles around his eyes deepened a bit. Still he did not speak.
It was several long minutes in the quiet as their breathing returned to normal and the sweat cooled on their skin. “You lasted surprisingly long for your first time with a man.” Castiel mused. Dean grinned at the feel of his low voice rumbling through his chest right under Dean’s ear.
But when Dean had tried, Cas had only smiled and leaned in for a kiss that crossed a few wires in Dean’s brain and left it a pile of happy mush.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed. “This seems too easy.”
“I like you, Dean. Well, that’s not entirely true, but I like you more than when I found you here.”
Cas turned to go inside, casting a glance around the parking lot as he did. Dean froze as Cas’s gaze snagged on the tail end of the Impala, but relaxed as he went inside. Dean craned around to watch him in person, rather than from a mirror. Just to make sure he got upstairs, he reasoned. Definitely not to catch one last glimpse of him before making the long trek back to Chicago. Definitely not.
“That’s not always the case.” Cas went on, working himself up into a full rage. “Do you know what I had to do to get this job? It’s not that easy for me to just walk into a school and get a job.
“Here ya go, gentlemen.” A server dropped off two plates and popped her gum twice before leaving again. Castiel had no idea what had been ordered for him, but appreciated that Dean got French toast for him. Something simple and comforting. Feeling ravenous, he dug into his food, watching Dean do the same, but slightly messier. Castiel smirked around his fork when a bit of syrup landed on Dean’s leather jacket sleeve.
“I’m not, like—scared or anything,” Castiel scratched the back of his head. “But if the ghost were to come back, while I’ve got students on stage...” he trailed off.
“Maybe I better just go.” Trevor pulled gently away from where they were seated on the couch.
“Castiel! Oh thank god, I thought for sure you’d be in a dumpster by now—“
“Am I just too dirty for you to really fuck me?” He took a few hesitant steps towards the stairs. “Gonna go wash your mouth out to get the taste out off your tongue?” Castiel heard himself overreacting and didn’t try to stop it, he was too mad.
“Just havin’ a conversation, is all. So come on, spill the sob story. You’re getting a cheeseburger out of the deal.” Mr. Winchester said, leaning over to steal a fry off Castiel’s plate
As it was,
Dean clenched his fists. “I’m sorry I came here. I’m sorry I intruded into your life. I’m so sorry for everything.” He quickly crossed the room and snatched up his jacket. He made it as far as the door when Castiel spoke.
He hit the main lights so the stage was bathed in the yellow of the spotlights overhead. His reader was quiet, but now that he knew the huffy teacher wasn’t likely to turn him in, he might be able to get back to work.
“This isn’t gonna work, is it?” The man looked… sad. Castiel felt a rush of guilt, but pushed it down. He wouldn't make it through this encounter if they took it all the way. He shook his head in response.
“I deserved that. Cas, I deserve so much worse than that.” His voice turned pleaded and he looked Castiel in the eye. “Can we please talk? If not in my car, then somewhere else?”
“Never took you as a fiction reader...” Castiel chuckled.
Sam’s face changed, and he cocked his head to the side. “Is that a hickey?”
He grudgingly stopped for gas on the edge of Grand Island. He had laughed at first when the municipal sign for Central City had proudly stated “The Center of it all!” as the city’s motto, but the pathetic misnomers for towns around here was starting to grate on Dean’s nerves. There wasn’t even any water around here for it to be even close to an island of any sort. Unless you counted the concrete ones in the middle of the dusty streets. Dean set up the fueling pump and walked in to the building for a bite to eat.
“Okay, look. It’s still pretty new. I pay his rent and stuff, and he—you know. Yeah, I’m gonna pay his tuition, but Sam. You gotta see what he paints. He showed me pictures and stuff, and he’s… he's incredible. He’s good. Really good. Better than mom, even.”
“We’ll discuss that after we get you something to eat, and maybe after you tell me a little bit of what’s going on.” Dean’s tone was firm.
He was pleased this aspect of Dean’s personality hadn’t changed at least. He dutifully endured his big brother teasing him the whole way to the condo.
Bela’s eyebrow arched. “Oh, I do miss those days. Quite the cuddler, if memory serves. Not my cup of tea.”
Well, Dean’s never been known for his skill at probability. While he was counting on having to deflect attention from the locals, there was one more thing he hadn’t accounted for.
Castiel banged his head on the wheel. “I just told him I didn’t like women when he was asking about my art. I doubt he’ll even let me back in the building.”
Dean wasn’t sure if he had ever really recovered from that tragedy so early in his life, but the string of therapists he and his father had had finally asked him to stop coming after he kept trying to ask them about their own problems instead, calling him “remarkably well-adjusted for someone in his position”. Dean was better nowadays, really. He assured his dad of that whenever he asked, Bobby and Missouri too. He had family that loved him dearly, he was fine, really. He didn’t need someone in a dark office to try and unravel why he felt so much guilt without quite knowing why.
After what could have been a few minutes, but felt like hours or even full lifetimes to Castiel, Dean sat up and spoke again.
This was fun for Castiel. Not that Anna hadn’t been fun to shop for art supplies with, but Dean had so many questions. What made brush companies different? What the hell was gesso? What was his favorite type of paint? Castiel ranted about how long oil paints took to dry, and the painstaking process of mixing the pigment, and how acrylics were so much easier to work with but got a bad rep because they were considered less “professional.” He told Dean about the importance of using a fixative that wouldn't yellow when the painting was completed. He lamented how hard it was to keep purple pigment on a painting for more than a year, because the sun just did funny things to paint on a canvas. Dean picked up a tube of metallic gold pigment and tried for three whole minutes to convince Castiel that he needed it. Castiel replied that if he wanted to use that much gold in one place, he’d wind up being another Kilmt, and the world wasn’t ready for that. Still, he didn’t argue when Dean tucked the small bottle in the cart carefully alongside his other supplies. They walked past a display of pottery wheels. Dean asked his opinion on ceramics, and Castiel replied that he’d always wanted to get better, but he hadn’t been able to get into the intermediate throwing class for about two years running.
“He likes his privacy.”
Dean swallowed noisily. “I…”
“Well, either fortunately or unfortunately—ridiculous is kinda my main gig.” Dean stopped again. He shuffled around and stuck out his hand, cutting off the man’s progress down the aisle. “Name’s Dean.”
Dean snickered and held up his hand. “Honest to god, Dean Winchester, at your service.”
“Rookie mistake, Anna,” Castiel stretched his arms over his head, relishing the pop of his shoulder. “You don’t bag the billionaire, the billionaire bags you. You gotta make your time seem worth the money.” He slipped past Anna to the fridge, where he pulled out a bottle of water. He offered one to Anna as well.
Dean shrugged. “Guess if they don’t, I can bring in my Beretta.” He grinned when Cas swatted at his arm and an indignant and scandalized cry of ‘
“Yeah…”
“Sounds great.” They kissed again, in the open air of Castiel’s borrowed living room. It was late, and the first real snow storm of the season threatened next week. The wallpaper was definitely peeling in some areas, and the dining room chairs were too mismatched to be anything but on purpose. And in the moment, Castiel didn’t want to be anywhere else.
According to Chamuel, Cas had two options: he could stay in the cave, which had strong enough warding to keep the empty at bay, or she could strip him of his quickly declining grace, and he would live the rest of his days as a human. Cas knew he would be very little use to anyone if he no longer had his grace to assist him, and he refused to become any type of burden to the Winchesters, which was why Cas had ended up choosing to remain in the cave.
"Fuck... I know Cas... I know... I just needed a minute, okay! That was a lot to recall." Dean sat down and put his head in his hands.
Castiel glared at Dean. "I'm going to bed, and you would be wise to do the same." Castiel switches off the light and crawls into the bed.
Cas' mouth dropped open in shock. "Us Winchester's?"
"Well, her eyes were green!"
"No, no, not at all! It's just drastically different from how you normally act in the mornings! I mean, your up before noon on our off day. I'd call that a miracle."
Cas' wings sank. "I didn't mean to -"
"Well, I already said that appearance doesn't matter much to me..."
Castiel only replied with an "Oh-oh, yes."
"Precautious?"
Dean let a nervous chuckle. "You Ummm, well you talk in your sleep, man! It started as a few mumbles here and there. Eventually, your mumbles turned into screaming, and you started thrashing around like you were having a seizure or some shit. So I held you down to keep you from hurting yourself." Dean replied.
"This is extremely peculiar," Cassie said, inspecting Dean like he was a bug under a magnifying glass.
"When she remembers all this, the camera zooms in on her eyes." The angel commented.
"Yeah ... well, that didn't happen here, so there is no ill will between any of us." Dean said.
Dean smiled fondly at his best friend. But he wouldn't dwell on the topic if it made Cas anxious. "I get it Cas, it was a shock for us all that I got to live and that my mom got brought back to life. It makes sense. It was one of the few times we actually won without a hell of a downside. Anyhow... Are you ready to show me the next one?" Dean asked.
"What the hell are you doing, Cas? The point of Twister is to be the last one standing, not to fondle your opponent ." Dean stated, looking over his shoulder at Cas.
Castiel took one look up and down Dean, and then he was crawling back on top of him. Once again lowering his body so that it mirrored the hunters.
"Cas, just amuse me here. Tell me, what the hell is going on with you?"
"Dean... why did you stop? You still have three more events to reveal." Cas stated.
"It's the only way out of here." She replied.
"Ehhh.... I've changed more than you probably think I have." Dean said, referring to the fact that he wasn't even actually this universes real Dean.
Castiel's face went red from the frustration of her accusation. "I was solely CHECKING ON Jack like I do every night before he goes to bed. One night a few days ago, I saw that he was writing what seemed to be a letter. I must've peeked in near the conclusion of his letter because soon after, I saw Jack folding the letter up and placing it into an envelope. Since Jack doesn't have friends outside this bunker, I wanted to see what he did with the envelope. After it was completely sealed, Jack closed his eyes and a small rip in this dimension formed above his desk." He explained
"Goodnight... jerk!" Cas responded in the way that Sami or, in his case, Sam would, and Dea couldn't help but smile at that as Cas walked back to the spare room he had chosen.
"Uhhh yeah... something like that..." Dean replied, trying to act as confident as he could to hide his confusion, but Castiel seemed to have other things on his mind.
Nonetheless, after one month had passed, Dean began to get a little stir crazy. He couldn't take just sitting around and waiting for his angel to return to him. He needed to get back out there. He needed to occupy himself to make the remaining time go by faster.
"I say... Okay!" Castiel said in response.
Dean was still staring at the cellphone, trying to piece together all these things, but not before Castiel spoke up again.
Suddenly, Dean went lower, tonguing over his balls, following the line of smooth skin all the way back to his hole. He stiffened under the kitten licks Dean paid him, and buried one hand in Dean’s hair while the other one gripped the edge of the seat so hard, he was sure he’d damage it. The tongue underneath him flicked filthily, dipping in, swirling around, and teasing its way back out again.
“Did I—did I do it wrong?” Dean worried, eyes darting around Cas’s face and a flush building high on his cheeks.
“Turn it on.” Castiel feared the worst.
Sighing, Dean sized him up. It might be easier to get what he wanted if he told the truth. Well, as much as he reasonably thought he could get away with. “I’m hunting a ghost.”
“I have to,” The spirit sighed, like it was all part of a hard day’s work. “He invaded my space, and didn’t respect it.”
“Understatement!” Castiel scoffed, crossing his arms. “Why are you here?”
Castiel worked his jaw for a moment. “I want you. You’d be good to me, I can feel—“ Dean made a face and cut him off with a wave.
“So you know Chicago? Used to live there or something?” Trevor asks, breaking the silence.
“With a devilishly handsome ghost exterminator and supernatural creature hunter?” Dean asked with a wry smile.
Castiel was across the room, searching through the tall bookshelves behind Adler’s desk. Not a single book resided on the shelves. Instead, each shelf was covered with either framed photographs, knick-knacks, or Central City Bison memorabilia. “He’s alright. Pretty okay, I guess.”
The man scoffed. “Yes, it’s terrible that Kevin got hurt, but no I don’t buy this cockamamie story about some mysterious figure pushing a set piece, that likely wasn’t screwed down like it was supposed to be. There’s a perfectly logical explanation for this,” the man grabbed his arm, causing Dean to have to fight down the impulse to deck him, “and I don’t believe in ghosts.”
“S’it serious?”
car outside our building?”
“Let’s see...” Dean focused on the bottom of each form as he paged through. There wasn’t a whole lot there, but was was there was concerning. “Accident involving injury... emotional distress... accident involving injury... oh shit, death... voluntary leave... “ Dean squinted. “Homo—wait, people can still get fired for being gay? Isn’t that illegal?”
Dean huffed. “Don’t look at me like that, I don’t know paint like you,” he said, standing up a few tubes of paint that had fallen over. “The designers just say that the blue we pick will ‘define the brand’ or whatever. That seems like a lot of pressure on a single color.”
“Well, he isn’t. He’s… I’m just helping him out with stuff… in exchange for… stuff.”
“So you’re here then? Permanently?” Castiel recognized the subject change for what it was.
“Yes, sir.” Dean scooped Castiel’s feet up from underneath him and practically jogged to where Castiel’s bedroom door stood open. Castiel laughed the whole way and felt utterly weightless. The door slammed behind them, leaving the rest of the apartment in stillness.
“You’ve been holding out on me.” He accused gently, turning enough to snag Cas’s mouth again, fucking in between his lips in retribution. “Or maybe you’re just a show off.” He nipped at Cas’s bottom lip, feeling a tick of a smile when it made Cas’s breath stutter.
Startled, Castiel whipped around, pencil tucked behind his ear, to the sound of Dean laughing at him. Dean pointed to Castiel and shook his hips, mouthing the words to the song. He spun around and grabbed a wrench, singing into it like a microphone. Castiel chuckled and shook his head.
. It was an address.
Still unsure how much Bobby knew, or how much he was allowed to tell Bobby, Castiel tried to paste a reassuring look on his own face. “He’s just tired, I think. I just want to—to check on him.”
“You’re here for Castiel Novak?” She sounded pleasant. Her green scrubs were only the slightest bit wrinkled, hinting at a long shift.
“Sam.” His voice sounded forced and unnatural.
“Oh my god.” Cas whispered. Dean looked up from his place in the hole. in time to see all the blood drain out of Cas’s face and his eyes widen as he looked behind him.
“Cas…” Dean could really only gape at him like a fish.
Castiel wondered if Dean was purposefully keeping him waiting, or if he was seeing how long it would take Castiel to push him into talking. Castiel wasn’t sure what the right answer was.
“I won’t. I’m right here if you want me to be.”
Dean rolled with it. “Best friend.”
Castiel leaned forward. “But all the adventures you must have—the things you must see—!”
“Jo at work owes me a favor—don’t look at me like that, keep driving!” She added, receiver muffled like she was talking to the person in the car next to her.  Castiel had to smile through the tears, still coming down. Trust Anna to have his back, even when he hadn’t been around to have hers the past few weeks.
Dean pulled out the drama club picture he’d found in Ron Kaiser’s attic. The 1928 One Act team stared out at them, faded in its age. Cas brought it closer to his face under the dining room light.
Dean was starting to see muggy stars, he wasn’t getting enough air. Just before he was sure this was where it all ended—goodbye Cas—a shot rang out and he slumped to the ground.
Dropping the phone on the floor, and his face into his hands, Dean sighed heavily. He was in love with Castiel. Jo knew it, Bobby and Missouri knew it, Sam knew it, and he had a sinking feeling that Cas knew it too. That’s why this hurt so much. Cas knew he wasn't being treated fairly, and he left. Wanted to show Dean how much better he deserved.
Dean grinned and let himself be pulled. His gaze happened to catch on the bag that had been kicked over by the sofa. The hats spilled from the bag, some under the sofa where he’d have to lean all the way down to reach them. Great.
Utterly confused again, Castiel said, “Why would you do that?” He couldn’t even begin to picture the conversation that must have gone down between his advisor and Dean. Balthazar pissed him off every single time they spoke, simply because of how the man lived; he couldn’t imagine Dean trying to navigate that on his own.
Dean saw a pile of clothing and props on a table near the door. “Yeah, what kinda show are you doing, anyway? I couldn’t really—uh… tell, during rehearsal.”
He gave his card to the desk attendant, and soon had a key to the farthest room on the bottom floor. “Any idea if there’s any burger joints open this time of night?” He asked, hopeful he’d at least get something good to eat in a town this small.
Castiel hesitated before typing “friend,” because he really wasn’t sure what to call Dean at this point. It was easier than calling him “my potential sugar daddy” though, and far more stomachable. He immediately turned his phone off after sending the message. It wasn’t safe, and Anna would beat his ass for making her worry, but he couldn't stand the thought of anyone else in his head right now.
He pushed away from the counter, moving to stand at the window. The gate was out of sight beyond the hill that was his driveway. He hadn’t seen any reporters on their way back in the estate, but he hadn’t really been looking. He’d been more concerned with what was about to happen and what he was about to say.
Dean didn’t fully relax until his feet were back on the ground, and he knew Castiel was glad to be out of harm’s way by the way he kept repeating,
Bela looked at him curiously and tilted her head. “Castiel, you have a wonderful knack for not knowing you have the kind of talent some people would kill for.” Castiel colored this time. “Yes, I wasn’t lying when I complimented the demon eyes piece. In fact, I’d love it for my lobby.”
It didn’t even necessarily have to be Dean’s money paying the bill, either. Now that he had a better handle on this whole sugar daddy arrangement, there was little stopping him from finding two or three other sugar daddies to pay his way through school.
“I saw somewhere,” Dean said quietly, eyes alight with wonder and lust, “that if you start choking someone, and they smile, you were never the one in control.”
“You know that—it’s not that I don’t want to fuck you… you know that, right?”
“Not a part of the plan, I’m afraid.”
Thank you for sticking with this story, even though the weird posting schedule, and the emotional highs and lows. I appreciate every time you comment and leave kudos on this story. It has truly been a pleasure to write for you.
Dean blinked and sat down beside Castiel. “Cas, do you remember that contract I had you sign yesterday?”
He staggered over to where Cas was standing, and took back his gun, stowing it on his holster. “I’m good. You good?” He checked him over, and with the relief of both himself and Cas being alive, he couldn’t resist pulling him in for a quick, manly hug, mindful of both his own injured ankle and Cas’s probably-bruised back. “Thanks for saving my ass, man.”
Trevor rubbed the back of his neck and grimaced, “Sorry. That was—that was dumb to assume and—“
“Dean Winchester, kiss me again. Please. It’s good.”
Kevin nodded. “It looked like him. It didn’t… sound like him though, he sounded—weird, I guess. Not like himself. And—he changed… somehow.”
Sam’s heart broke for Dean, not for the first time. The media had really done a number on Dean and had a lot to answer for. “Okay, we just gotta—“
(See the end of the chapter for
, he told himself.
He dug for a few more minutes—though it seemed like hours—until he hit a strange texture in the dirt. “Look at this.” He moved to the side so Cas could see, taking a second to get his breath back.
But months of habit were hard to break in one night. So, Castiel had instead chosen to sleep next door, a decision that was not met with any animosity or disappointment, just a smile, a quick kiss, and a quiet goodnight. In his solitude, Castiel found himself going over the evening, smiling and feeling his cheeks warm, despite himself.
“Hey…Cas?”
believe this.
“This isn’t fair.” Dean’s voice was several octaves higher than usual. His fingers were twisted in the comforter. Castiel walked his fingers up Dean’s arms, chuckling when the muscles jumped. He traced up to Dean’s collarbone, and up the column of his throat, ticking over the contours of his lovely face.
Dean swallowed. “Well, then open up sweetheart.” He scooped up a bit of tiramisu onto his fork and held it out to Castiel. “‘Cuz I’m takin’ care of you now.”
He still wasn’t sure what Dean’s company did, though…
Dean frowned. “Like I’d let you do anything more strenuous than be a lookout with that cast on.” He softened suddenly as he paused. He’d never had someone really permanent on the road with him. His dad traveled with him a lot, but since Dean had taken over the Impala, they always drove separately. He hadn’t had anyone to bicker over the radio with, or hand him tapes from the tattered shoe box behind the passenger seat, or try to steal his fries in the parking lot of a Wendy’s in ages. What if Cas was serious, and wanted to stay with him? Wanted to see America the way it was meant to be seen—in little towns dotted across the country, people of all different types making up the backbone of blue-collar everyday life. And maybe even, if Dean was very
Castiel gaped at him. Hyde Park was one of the most sought after neighborhoods in the entire city. Castiel would have killed to get clients who even frequented the area, let alone lived there. Dean smiled serenely back at him.
“Oh no, you’re free to sit anywhere in the house.” Castiel stopped in front of a door that closely resembled the others in the hallway. A brass rectangle tacked to the door read his name. “And we’ll be done before five today. Just—y’know, a precaution.”
“Just arrived actually. Real looker of a guy, messy dark hair, big blue eyes, you’re a dead ringer for him.” The man gestured for him to sit down.
They wove between partygoers out on the concrete patio, some recognizing Castiel and reaching out to offer congratulations. The woman pressed on, and he had to offer his most polite  avoidances to get away so he didn’t lose her in the crowd.
“Didn’t need your help the first time,” Dean winked. “But thanks for the solidarity.”
The cashier, named Sid by way of the name tag, chuckled. “Not yet. She’s got aliens drinking out of swimming pools though.”
She stopped in the kitchen. “Is that so? Are we talking frustrated or
“Goddammit, you stupid son of a bitch,” Dean muttered, hating how shaky he sounded. “Come here, sweetheart. Is anything broken?” Cas’s face had various cuts and bruises, but Dean couldn’t help but take it into his hands. He swept his thumbs over Cas’s cheeks, clearing away a stripe of grime and—Dean cringed—dried tears. How could he have allowed this to happen?
“He had an expense report to drop off. I was just... cleaning.” Dean supplied, helpfully. He silently cursed not wearing the stupid jumpsuit. He should have known. Maybe he really was going soft.
Castiel visibly paled, and Dean tried not to smirk too obviously. “Not quite the high-tech operation you thought it would be, eh?”
Dean sighed and looked at the ground. “I dunno. It’s fine, it's not a big deal.”
“Shut up.”
“Rent’s due in a few days.”
Mr. Winchester stepped up slowly to him, “If I’m not mistaken, you said you’d never actually been with a guy before. Is that right?”
Castiel shrugged. “Everything.”
“Dude, relax. It’s just a ghost. Heh, I don’t get to say that very often.”
Dean glanced at the fireplace. They had cleaned out the ashes from the hats last night as well, not willing to actually keep anything from their scrape with Oswald’s ghost. Hopefully the hats were the last thing tying Oswald to this plane of existence. Without the DNA to hold him to the hats, he’d hopefully disappear and be unable to get a new host.
Dean hesitated. He came around the table to face him with the wood of the table between them as a shield. “You’re happy?”
“Right. Iron doesn’t seem to affect him. And neither does salt.”
Cas hoisted himself up a more comfortable sitting position, only wincing slightly as stitches were pulled here and there. “I know you don’t feel the same, but I really enjoyed our time together, and I don’t want you to leave thinking that I don’t—appreciate what you did for me and the school.”
And who knew? All this domesticity was making Dean think that maybe, if Cas wasn’t sick of Dean in the six weeks it took to get his cast off, maybe... just maybe, they could settle down in another small town, like this one. Far away from monsters and ghosts and grumpy principals and just... be together. Like actual people. It was a hell of an idea, he thought with a wry smile.
“You should do that one number with the hula hoops.”
“I know,” Cas sighed. “I’ve gotta stop doing this to guys. Before him it was Nate, and Collin. I’m a mess.”
Cas appeared in the doorway a short time later, followed by Amelia in her coat. Dean darted up to where Cas was standing and leaned in, helping him down the stairs and to their car. Cas might be getting good with his crutches on flat surfaces, but Dean wasn’t taking any chances on inclines. Dean was determined that he and Cas would take it easy for probably the first time in their lives.
Sometimes, reality hurts worse than fiction.
Forgiveness, can you imagine?
Castiel reached down to pull Dean’s jeans down below his ass, so they could grind together without as much fabric in the way. As soon as he was relatively free, Dean pulled them forwards and just laid into Castiel, pushing his erection against Castiel’s. His eyes were so bright and wild-looking. When Castiel leaned back a bit, holding himself up with his hand, Dean followed, the new angle pulling sounds out of both of them.
“A hinge joint, in other terms.” Cas replied. He chuckled at Dean, feeling his cheeks heat up. He marked across Dean's not-insubstantial bicep, smiling slightly when the muscle twitched under his hands. It was harder than he anticipated, touching Dean like this. His skin was smooth and warm and it was driving Cas crazy. Dean had stopped talking altogether and was just watching him now. He smiled pleasantly whenever Cas looked up, something tugging on the edges of his gaze that Cas couldn't bring himself to examine too closely. Cas pushed up the sleeve of Dean's t-shirt further, pressing softly to get an idea of where his scapula was. Dean was quite muscled here, the skin firm and tanned. Cas could feel muscle rippling as Dean moved to accommodate him. He closed his eyes briefly before continuing. How was he supposed to get through this?
Dean decided to bite the bullet and get out of bed to start looking for his things. He wasn’t sure where Cas was, and he definitely wanted to check in before he left, but he could keep his hands busy for now. Most of his things had migrated over to Cas’s place. He had checked out of the motel earlier yesterday, at Cas’s insistence that Dean stay with him. This definitely conflicted with the message Cas had sent by leaving in the middle of the night, but… whatever.
Castiel looked down, noting that he was still in his boxers. He blushed. “I was just looking for a charger… f-for my phone.” He held up the device, still unsure how he should handle Missouri.
“And you, Dean? Still keeping out of trouble?”
Missouri glanced over her shoulder. “Mr. Winchester doesn’t trust too many people. Just me and his uncle Bobby anymore around the house.” She pursed her lips like this was a subject she didn't like to talk about. She pulled Castiel into the kitchen, which was all sparkling stainless steel and black granite. An older man sat at the breakfast bar, occasionally surfacing from his newspaper to drink from a cup of coffee. Dean stood at the stove in boxers and a threadbare t shirt, flipping pancakes around and generally making a mess. Even from the back, Dean looked like the pages of a male lifestyle magazine come to life. Castiel wondered how much money one had to make before everything you did became attractive.
Letting out a low whistle, Dean stood back up. “That’s quite a story. It’s always small towns, huh?”
Castiel bristled and crossed his arms. “I’m old enough. Besides, the way you were looking at me earlier says that you still want me, no matter how old I am.”
Suddenly, Dean sat up. Cas thought maybe Dean had finally realized that Cas's poorly-disguised crush was making this more awkward than it needed to be. However, Dean didn't go anywhere, he just stripped off his shirt and laid back down. He glanced up at Cas and smiled. Cas would almost swear that he was shy in that moment.
“Protection,” Dean panted back. “Not that kind—“ he scoffed at Cas’s smirk, “Protection from demons, that sorta thing.”
“Sorry to keep invading your space. You’re a really good instructor.” Castiel added on, having seen it for himself and from Anna.
“So, when is this shindig over?” Dean yawned and stretched his other arm, angling his wrist to see his watch. “Not that I don’t love hanging out with the drama dorks.”
“—God, Cas, stop saying that—”
“All the same,” Cas said, determinedly not looking at Dean. “All the other time we spent together was... nice.”
“So is this really how this ends?” Cas said behind him. Dean turned to look at the man who now had his arms crossed petulantly over his hospital gown. “Me with a broken leg and you waltzing out of here like nothing’s wrong?”
“Cas, I don’t know—“ Dean started, his heart feeling like it was skipping every other beat.
So... it turns out there really is a ghost. Just Dean's luck.
to stop reading that line like that. It’s distracting.” The man said like he was exasperated, probably having said it five times that day. The student—Brent—snipped back at him, earning a chuckle from the rest of the teenagers.
An hour and a half later, the party was in full swing. Well, as “full swing” as Dean suspected these small town cast parties could get. The party seemed populated equally by the drama kids—actually enthusiastic for once—and their parents, casting wary looks at Cas now and then, but dutifully looking after their teenagers.
“Yeah, Sammy. You can come over. We'll watch Ferris Bueller.”
“Cas, you really think you’re gonna end up alone?”
“It’s late.” He said. Dean nodded in agreement.
Still, even with this frustration, they carried on with their routine. He averaged about five nights at Dean’s place, four or more in Dean’s bed with him, and the rest at his own apartment with Anna. Castiel hated those nights the worst, but understood that Dean sometimes had early morning meetings or had to leave town. Sometimes, too, Castiel had to take some distance from Dean when the bookstore started getting steadily busier with the upcoming fall semester. Classes at the Institute started approximately a week after Loyola and U of Chi, and students were starting to stream back into the already bursting city. Still, between the worried freshmen, and the even more worried parents, Castiel found solace in between the towering stacks of shelves at the back of the quiet bookstore. It was a good place to think about… anything.
Dean hummed and kissed the top of his head, not the forehead that had gotten smeared but the very top, like placing down a crown. “I brought you a change of clothes, some food,” he said. “Have the water at least. For me?”
,” he answered as he stepped into the mostly empty supply closet and closed the door. “
Castiel met Rachel’s eyes over the man’s shoulder. That was possibly the worst answer he could have given. A habitual addict with a built-up resistance they could have uncomfortably explained. But someone who was opioid naïve should have been unconscious from the drugs, if not well on their way to death.
“Up, on your knees,” said Cas when he backed out of the kiss, about ten seconds short of Dean blacking out from the lack of oxygen.
“There you are,” said Muse, settling back into the booth’s pillows. Her smile had grown into a wide and genuine, victorious thing. “Glad to finally meet you, Castiel.”
Castiel grabbed a bundle, uncoiling it and running the rope through his hands to soften it. It smelled earthy and clean, natural fibres, not the nylon Dean had expected. Cas knee crawled until he was on the other side of Dean, still half-dressed in his rolled-up sleeves and suit pants. Dean couldn’t help but take in the bulge of Castiel’s arousal through the thin fabric of the latter and grinned. Cas answered the smile and ran one of his hands up and down Dean’s leg, scratching lightly at his inner thigh. He grabbed at his ankle on the third pass, pulling it up until the heel of Dean’s foot rested at the tender crease of his ass.
” it read. Castiel brushed his lips on it as he closed his eyes, then fed the note to the office shredder.
“Hey,” said Dean softly, bending to kiss his forehead and then stepping away. “Feeling better?”
Before Dean could complain about the sudden abandonment, a hand landed on his left ankle. Muse waited until he met her eye and nodded before running her hand up his leg, in the same slow pattern Cas had taken. She was mimicking him exactly, the speed, the pressure, the exact same path in a mirror effect. By the time she was cinching the cross over knots Dean knew he was in trouble. For one, the fear had been all but burnt away by the desire in his veins and he was fully hard with what amounted to very little actual touch. The ties left him open and on display, vulnerable, and feeling a bit slutty. It was a heady mix that he was finding out he liked more than expected. For two, there were a lot of ropes left and something in the languid movements of both Cas and Muse let him know they intended to use every last inch of it as a metaphorical dick measuring contest.
“Tin. Tenth anniversary.” He shook his head and blinked a few times to make his eyes focus on the menu. The wards inside and around the Phoenix itched like wool. “Outside. The family. They were celebrating the tenth anniversary of a union.”
“Humm?” Castiel sounded almost as tired as Dean was, peaceful.
The bed was three steps behind Dean, but it took him six to cross the distance, suddenly unsure and unbalanced. Maybe showing off a bit, cocking his hip a bit more than needed, chin lifted to expose his neck. He only moved his hands from where he’d crossed them at the small of his back when his calves hit the bed, leveraging to pull himself on the bed. The mattress sunk under his weight, memory foam flexing between his fingers, pressing the imprint of the keys into his palm.
“Same lot,” Rachel answered. She didn’t need to add more, painting a picture in two words. Castiel trusted her with both eyes closed, she was too driven, too loyal to be diverting the morphine. So either someone else had gotten into the clinic’s supply, and they would have to assume everything else had been adulterated, or the entire supply was a write-off.
“I—” the man said between grunting breaths “—don’t touch drugs. Never have. Lost my brother to junk.”
At some point on his way down to the floor, Castiel passed out.
Dean’s voice was forcefully happy and whiskey burnt through the comlink, mapping in Castiel’s mind over both the “at home” and “available” areas of Dean’s life.
He didn’t wait for an answer, circling into position. Rachel growled under her breath and exhaled in annoyance, but it had been her default mode for days. Maybe weeks. She was as protective as Dean, in her own ways. Probably more, depending on the metric one used. Castiel grabbed the patient’s arm firmly, braced to pull his weight into the shift, one long movement to snap the elbow into its proper place. It should have been easy enough, a stretch and a pop and then off to the next patient, maybe try to clear a few light cases from the waiting room to give an illusion of progress.
The mattress settled and there was a hand on his shoulder, a different hand lifting his head, pushing him back so that he fucked Cas’ cock deeper into himself. The position was unstable, making Dean’s core muscle burn at the strain of keeping himself up until he gave up and sagged into the support being provided.
Muse chuckled and drew a soft quilt over both of them. She kissed the top of Dean’s head, her hand under the quilt handing him something square and covered in velvet. It was scary how good she was at reading him, at digging out his secrets. Or maybe it had fallen when she’d moved his clothes. He was a bit hazy towards the end.
“Of course,” Cas said, at length, slipping the ring over his finger.
“Not long. There are noodles in the kitchen. And tea.”
The door closed behind her, locking with an electronic ping. Dean nestled against Cas’ hold, luxuriating in the skin on skin contact, too spent to want anything more. Almost.
Castiel ran the numbers quickly. “20mg? In less than an hour?” he asked Rachel without expecting an answer. Then, to the patient, “how much opioids do you consume just to maintain baseline function?”
“Now?”
She flowed into the booth next to Dean, well into his personal space, pressing along the warmth of him from his thigh to his shoulder. She raised an eyebrow, pointedly, at Castiel. A dare, a gambit, goading him into making a move.
“Let’s reduce him,” he told Rachel as he walked into the examination room. “The x-ray for the broken orbital doesn’t worry me too much, you can handle the rest of this on your own.”
“Oooh, that’s nice. Works well with his blush,” Muse said, amused.
Castiel was sure he nodded, or spoke, or growled. There was a cry behind the closed door, too weak and too filled with pain. Its anger matched anger found in older voices, in the other needs, bleeding all around Cas. Dean squeezed his arm and walked out, into the sun. The door closed, and there was so much left to do. “Thank you,” he said to the ghost of warmth against his skin.
The blindfold loosened and dropped.
“Salted caramel,” she said with a purr. “On the house for you, honey.”
The next morning a green cooler stuffed with dry ice was left on the check-in counter. The door was locked, the lights out. There was an easily disposable note on top, with a blocky lettered message written with one of the clinic’s pens.
Between one quiet apocalypse and the next, Castiel forgot.
Taking a deep breath, Dean rolled over to his stomach then pushed himself upright until he was sitting on his bound leg. He shuffled a bit to regain the center of the bed. Two sets of hands flew over his legs and feet, making sure there was no loss of circulation and nothing pinched. The
in the touch made a new, different, heat blossom in Dean.
The patient was trying very hard not to make a noise, through focused open-mouthed breaths that had long since turned his lips dried and chapped. Not that there was any other way he could have tried for zen, eyes closed from the swelling and nose broken — out of alignment enough to impair airflow. Castiel had a begrudging respect for mind over matter and the control it took.
Being regulars did have its perks, however. The evening was young and so the line outside the door was long and boisterous, filled with families and other couples out in their finest livery. A large group was clustered around a helium balloon, the bright foil spinning and catching the light as its string was passed hand to hand. Anniversary, Castiel gathered, but he couldn’t read the number on the balloon. Gadreel looked up as the doors of the Impala creaked shut, already waving them through with a tilt of the chin. Dean put a hand on the small of Castiel’s back, guiding him as if he’d sensed the distraction. It was easy to follow that push, to stop and greet Gadreel properly before stepping past him, letting the other man read both of their auras with a wink and a smile. Easy to avoid the high chairs of the bar and to sit in the more private booth and then let it make the world fade away.
“Be mine?” Dean asked, opening the box and pressing it into Cas’ hand. The velvet was frayed from having lived in Dean’s pockets for weeks, the corners damaged. He watched as Cas touched it for a minute that stretched forever, mapping the form of the box and of the plain titanium ring within. He shifted away from Dean, lifting on one arm to get a better look. Dean held his breath, heart hammering away, ready for the rejection. “Will you?” Dean added, in a whisper of voice, terrified that he’d made a mistake after all but desperate to prompt an answer.
“Would you do the honours,” she asked Cas, waving over the ropes and Dean both, as if she was declaring the buffet at a reception to be open. From the expression that flew across Cas’ face, she just had.
She winked at him and bent down, lifting a duffle bag Dean hadn’t spotted before and upending it to the left of him on the bed. Bundles of ropes spilled out, in various lengths and diameters, far more than would be required to immobilize him. They were stained a deep maroon red, contrasting with the sheets.
“Little help?” gasped the man, still restrained and paler than he had been when Castiel had walked in.
“I am glad to see you two talked things out.” Muse picked up his fork and, slowly, cut a bite out of the cake. She brought it to Dean’s lips, his mouth opening without hesitation. As if by reflex, as if the entire exchange wasn't — at all — strange and predatory. “Good boy,” she said as he took the cake from the tines.
“You’re gorgeous like this. Being so good, so patient. Are you ready for your reward now?”
The dessert course brought indulgent discontent.
Most of the afternoon was spent resting. Castiel grazed on the food Dean had brought, drank the tea that was offered. Mostly, he let himself soak in the quietness, feeding a part of his soul like water feeds the parched ground after a draught. He couldn’t have said when had been the last time that, for a whole day, no demands were being made of him. There were no emergencies, no expectations, no calls. He slept, meditated, spent an hour looking at the sun as it set amongst the sharp edges of the barrens.
Dean started to shrug, tongue-tied by the swirl of emotions that still churned within his gut. Humiliation, fear, regret, a not insignificant presence of arousal being resparked by the sudden touch. Then, realizing this was exactly why Cas was asking, nodded.
Dean snapped his eyes open, blinking to focus on Castiel, on the play of emotions dancing beneath the lust. He knew, in the hypervigilant animal part of himself, that Muse was the one fucking him, that it was her heat on his ass and the soft swell of her breasts on his back as she bent down to bite at his shoulder. But it didn’t matter. That too was Cas. Like the ropes were Cas and the cock in his mouth. Like everything that Dean was, everything on display, everything being claimed belonged to Cas.
She looped ropes around his waist, adjusting until they sat securely above the iliac crest. They crossed behind him, just shy of the swell of his ass, and she secured it to the top of the rope already on his leg. In his mind's eye, Dean could gather that it would look like garter belts, bespoke lingerie built on his body
So Castiel waited until Dean was ready to play his card. He had plenty on his plate in the meantime: too many patients, never enough supplies, the impossible task of saying “no more,” of choosing who dies because he cannot save them.
” There was no hesitation in the answer, no undercurrent of resentment. Castiel allowed himself to feel relief, if not hope. Hope could come later when the best course of action didn’t involve counting the dead.
The cold drip of lube on his ass would have made him weep if it had come a minute later. Dean let out his breath in a long exhale, wishing he could widen his knees, make himself more inviting. He settled for relaxing his muscles, whimpering as the lube was rubbed into the skin around his rim, pushed inside by one of the fingers, maybe two. Then the fingers were gone, replaced by the blunt head of Cas’ cock and Dean moaned as it breached him. It was almost too good for words and not enough, too slow and gentle.
The sheets were soft and smelled of dried herbs, muted into a grassy anonymous note. Castiel frowned, deepening the darkness behind his lids and sending starbursts across his vision. This was wrong. There should bleach and antiseptic, sturdier material. The clinic’s cots were covered in what was properly sold as heavy-duty canvas and then abused into being pliable. They were never cotton soft. Castiel rolled on his back — noting that he didn’t fall down which probably meant something — throwing an arm over his eyes by reflex. Quiet. He could hear the soft glass and metal tinkling above him, moving on strings from the ever-present draft of the window. Home. Somehow, he was home.
Muse’s room was the same, though the sheets this time were a pale blue, the kind of colour the trid tried very hard to frame as belonging to a sea-side cottage. Dean was standing with his head bowed, swallowing around the small army of regrets that poured from his brain and threatened to block his breathing. How could he have been such a glaring idiot? He’d ruined everything and had only himself to blame. Any sane person would have found a different restaurant, or called ahead, made arrangements and considered the fallout. He’d walked into this blindly, chasing a stupid dream down a minefield. From the moment the booth had creaked from her weight, he’d expected Cas to walk out and be done with him. It would have been all he deserved.
“What?”
“I’ve been trying to set up a date night for a while. You were busy, it’s cool. But yeah. I wanted you to myself, dinner, wine.”
And blinked a few times.
“I did,” she screamed back, pointing with her chin at the surgical tray on the table. Somehow she was holding the patient down so he wouldn’t aggravate his wounds despite being half his size. Her medical knowledge was only half the reason Castiel had hired her. Her martial prowess and impeccable form made up much of the remaining half. The tray was crowded with nearly a dozen single-use syringes and the discarded glass corpses of four morphine vials. “If I give him any more, he's going to go into respiratory arrest.”
“Do we have any more in stock?” Castiel asked, once he could form words over the stupefaction again.
Castiel snarled. The thing about nihilism, he knew, was that it was contagious. It fed and grew until it felt soft and warm like worn sneakers and a blanket draped on your shoulders. Until it felt like all the alternatives were scary and strange. To hell with it.
So he told Dean about the vaccines.
“Cas?” He brought his hand to cover Castiel’s over his stomach and bringing it up over his heart, instead.
“Please,” Dean said, and the word felt weird like his tongue and lips didn’t quite know how to shape the sounds. He didn’t know how much time had passed.
Castiel tilted his head to take her in, from the shoulder-length strawberry blond hair and the storm-grey sky of her eyes. She was pretty, street sharp, a survivor, but that alone would not have made him sit uneasily. He let his sight extend beyond the visible spectrum.
” Castiel shifted the child to his left arm, trying not to wince at the way he flopped listlessly with the movement. His skin was clammy, the fever having wrung what it could of sweat and energy; the coughing had already taken the lion’s share. The mom wasn’t doing much better, fever spiking and shaking apart from the coughing.
“Not now,” he answered.
Dean was planning something.
Dean tried to keep his eyes closed, but the next thrust made him gasp and blink. His vision was watery in the sudden brightness of the room. For a moment he couldn’t make sense of what he was seeing. Castiel’s eyes were slivers of indigo around lust blown pupils, looking down on him. He’d gotten undressed at some point and the tantalizing sight of all of him made Dean whine with the desire to touch. Cas removed his thumb from Dean’s mouth and replaced it with his cock. Dean let his jaw drop as wide as he could, pulling out his tongue to cover his teeth. Cas was heavy and salty on his tongue and Dean closed his eyes around the pleasure of it.
“Drek,” they both said out loud at the same time.
“Close your eyes,” said Cas, once he’d settled. His hand was at the small of Dean’s back, rubbing soothing circles there. Dean let his lids close, leaning into the touch as he did to remind himself that this was as safe a place as he was likely to find in the Barrens.
Dean mulled it over and nodded. “Ok,” he said out loud, repeating it a few times to let the sound roll. It was. And he was. They would be.
A dragging sound made him flinch, heavy canvas against the wood of the floor. “Would this be satisfactory?” asked Muse, still maddeningly out of sight.
“What the hell, Rachel?” Castiel barked, focusing the shreds of his self-control to stop himself from dropping the man’s arm like hot coals. “Why didn’t you give him something for the pain? He should have been anesthetized before I even walked in.”
The seat of the booth creaked and the hair on Castiel’s neck stood up. Both were fully intended effects, carefully calculated. The woman carried a very studied impression of flippancy and coyness, belied by the hunger in her eyes and the self-satisfied grin that matched it. She set a plate on the table, precisely centred. It held a slice of cake, if the confection could be called cake, made of layers of dense chocolate mousse and crispy praline nuts.
Castiel supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised when Dean pulled into the familiar parking lot of the White Phoenix. He had hoped to be, to be made to discover a new pearl of light in the fabric of the city. Here was safe and worn, an explored and fixed point in both time and space. He understood the choice of a comfort zone destination, but for the first time in — maybe — years, it chafed at him.
“Tenth,” Castiel said out loud.
Cas’ hands shifted, pulling him forward until he was balanced on his knees. Fear spiked for a fraction of a second. With his arms bound behind him, Dean had no way of slowing or even controlling his fall. The fear was replaced by a purr of happy contentment when he felt Cas’ chest against him, the fabric of his shirt, the sharpness of the edges of buttons. Cas had him. He held him there for a few moments, with roaming hands and a long kiss, then gently guided him down towards the bed. The sheets were cool against Dean’s forehead. Cas’ hand ran through his hair, fingers digging at the scalp, then he was gone.
