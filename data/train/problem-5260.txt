“He already has a pretty big crush on you by the looks of things, he’d be stupid not to. Give him some flowers and bam! Putty in your hands! I’m a girl, I know these things.” she said with a wink.
“Lots of things are mandatory when you live in the Capital. Watching the games, watching any government broadcasts. I have to go to training four times a year on a bunch of things. Our history, why we can’t trust the districts, how the peacekeepers protect us. Obie signed me up for another training on the peacekeepers because I got mad when they took me by force. I got out of it because I ended up here.”
Tony didn’t doubt that he could get them working if he tried. There was a better than even chance that he had designed them in the first place. But if he did, then Steve and the others would have no chance. What was a bow or a knife compared to a bomb? The tribute could throw them, or hide them then draw the group over it, and it would be game over for them.
Steve started to pace. A lot could happen in a day. Without noticing Steve had clenched his hands into fists.  He was trying to stay calm, trying not to think about all the horrible things that could be happening to Tony, and how many enemies he had, and how without the suit Tony was a baseline human, and he had a weak heart and his ribs and lungs were messed up from the reactor. Natasha put a hand on his shoulder.
This felt quiet. This felt safe, and warm, like an extra log on an already roaring fire. He turned his head and breathed in the faint smell of metal and cinnamon from Tony’s hair, and wrapped a arm around him protectively. “Goodnight, Tony.”
“That is an excellent question.” Liberty flicked her tail and turned her eye towards Tony, who was still trying to take everything in.
“What if you made it bigger? Made it the circumference of the whole top of the boot and had them put their leg through the middle?”
Footage of Steve flipping everyone off in the chariot with his hand blurred out played on the screen.
The plain man from earlier approached them. “Your groomsmen have already left with him. I promised them I would look after you two.”
Steev nodded. “You saved me when you should have left me out to die in the smoke. Then you helped me save Thor when you had no reason to care. When the peacekeepers came after us you tried to get me out first. You ended up being nothing like I expected.”
“We have your costume!” A different stylist said, holding up a sequined baby blue tuxedo. Tony shuddered in disgust. There was no way he was agreeing to wear that. He was already in a well tailored black suit, elegant and far more subtle than anything else people at the Capital wore. Fashion these days was unapologetically ostentatious and while Tony liked wearing stupid shit as much as the next guy, this would be his first time on national television and he wanted to look dignified, and not like some punk kid. His only concession to fashion was his goatee, overly elaborate in the current style.
Steve stuffed the rag into Tony’s mouth and started to unwrap the bandages. Tony’s back arched off the ground in pain, and he dug his fingers into the hard dirt. He howled and the rag muffled it, barely.
She waved her hand through the air, as if clearing his words away.  “He makes it interesting. When he walks into a room you want to look at him. And when he looks back, god. His eyes are just really really clear, and it's intense. You, you're like… washed out. You're dull. Like his eyes are so crazy, like storms and clouds and shit, and you're like a pond. Not a good pond. The pond by my house with a lot of algae and too many ducks shitting in it. When I see his hair I think fun words like chestnut. You, I think words like dishwater blonde. He just makes it more somehow. He makes you want to be a part of that more, to hang around him until it rubs off on you.”
Steve lunged forward and grabbed him in a hug, spinning him around. He placed him back on the ground and without thinking pulled him into a kiss, awkwardly clacking their teeth together. Tony grabbed him by the back of the neck and pulled him back in, forcing his head sideways so their lips fit together perfectly. Steve relaxed against him, bringing his hands up to rest on Tony’s hips. Steve parted his lips and they were kissing for real, hot and wet. Tony tasted like cinnamon toothpaste, and when he pulled away Steve felt sort of like he had been hit by a bus. Tony gave him a parting peck and a smile like pure sunshine.
Bucky held out his hand. “Steve don’t you do this, don’t you dare do this. You have no chance of winning.”
Once they got there, they all looked around carefully before venturing out from the safety of the trees and into the exposed field. They went to the closest platform, and circled around it to the front where it would be most likely to have a landmine, and the platform offered some shade from the rising sun. Raza kicked Tony to the ground, and ordered him to dig. With no tools, Tony started to scrape away at the hard ground with his fingers. Yinsen dropped down beside him and started to help. Raza slunk back into the woods to keep guard form a more covered position. Only Tony and Yinsen were left vulnerable.
“Hey give me a break, I'm a little busy here.” As soon as he said it Tony winced and tried to backtrack. “Busy… monitoring the situation. From a safe distance. Because I am totally waiting for you guys.”
“It was my fault?” He whispered. Blood dripped out of the crack, and the eye closed. Steve breathed in heaving gasps, his breathes crystallizing into fog.
Steve hesitantly took Tony’s hand. “I’m more open to things than people think. The most important part is having the right partner.”
A man swung at Steve and he swung back, knocking him into another man and sending both of them tumbling. The next man shot at him, and Steve ducked out of the way, the edge of the shot singeing his hair and blowing a hole into the building behind him. Steve dodged as concrete rained down, a block knocking down the man with the gun. Four more quickly took his place, all firing on him. Steve rolled out of the way and the entire building behind him started to crumbled. Vision stepped in and braced up the front of the building as people ran out screaming.
“Not even your boyfriend?” Steve said idly, not looking away from the TV. It looked like the team was going to get a walk and that was going to be the most progress they’d made so far this inning.
“It’s the most harmless subject I could think of. And it was in the SHIELD briefing packet on how to make new friends in the twenty first century.”
“It has to be here.” Pepper declared. She had worked as the treasurer before the coup. “We’ve all heard the stories, of how the Captain tamed the first dragon. How he was small, too small to fight, so he found another way. He crept into a dragon's cave in the dead of night, inteading to try to capture it and set it loose in the battle the next day to cause havoc. Instead as soon his he brushed its side it awoke, and locked eyes. They formed a unbreakable bond between man and beast, giving the dragons the gift of speech and the human accelerated healing and good health. They went into battle the next day, and won us the first victory of the war, the dragon raining down fire from above.”
They broke for the day, and after everyone else filed out of the room, Steve remained. And wasn’t that how it always went? His pa, his ma, Bucky, Peggy, the Commandos, Tony. One by one they left, and Steve remained. He rested his head on the table, looking at the empty chair where Tony had sat. There was a stripe of red color on it and Steve got up to investigate. Tony had forgotten his coat. Tony had a terrible memory, he had to set himself reminders for everything from birthdays to meetings to doing laundry. Steve was pretty sure that four people knew Tony’s social security number and not one of those people was Tony. It was no surprise he had forgotten his coat. The right thing to do would be to return it to him, but Tony was already gone. He would be back for the rest of the meetings later, and Steve would hold onto it until then. He brought the paperwork back to the room he was staying in. He dumped the papers on the small dresser and laid the coat out on the bed. There was a knock at the door and Sam poked his head inside.
He screamed and the sound echoed through the clearing. He went back around to the side with the discarded coats and charged into the snow. Within ten steps it was up to his knees, and within twenty it was up to his waist. He waded through it as quickly as he could, his desperate calls whipped away by the wind into nothingness. He was surrounded by white, the trees blending together into identical pillars of black sticking out of the white like gravestones. The deeper he went the more the wind picked up, until he couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead because of all the flurries. He shivered violently, and the tears on his face started to freeze. His foot hit something and he dropped to his knees, digging through the snow desperately. Maybe it was Steve? Bruce? It was a branch. A fucking branch.
Steve walked behind him to nudge his feet further apart, and put a hand on his hip to shift Tony’s weight to his back foot. Steve’s hand was warm and rested on his hip for longer than most men would be comfortable holding another man for. Maybe Tony wasn’t the only who who batted for both teams, if you wanted to get into baseball metaphors.
They started to protest and were cut off as the screen above their heads made a loud buzzing sound and a countdown began. One minute until the cameras started rolling. Rhodey pulled open the door to the stage and Tony trotted out, running his hand through his hair and messing up the look the stylists had frantically tried to give him and leaving it tousled. He sank down next to Christine who gave him an unimpressed look.
“What did you do today? Captain America things? Did you fight for truth, justice, and the American way? Did you make your country proud?”
And this next one, Sara didn’t have buttermilk so she used 2% milk and vinegar. That sort of makes sense, meanwhile Laurie replaced the buttermilk with strawberry cheesecake yogurt and vanilla pudding. Why? Who sees 'buttermilk' and thinks 'strawberry cheesecake yogurt'?
Steve was going through all of his worries again with Clint when he heard a commotion and turned around. Tony was stalking through the crowd, clearly looking for someone, while Pepper followed a few steps behind. Steve frowned. Tony wasn’t supposed to be here yet, it was a quarter 'til the wedding.
That afternoon Clint and Natasha came back to the tower, with Natasha’s left arm bound up in a black splint. She stomped up to her room and paused as she saw a package in front of her door. It was a Tupperware full of fresh baked lemon poppy seed muffins. She took a bite and sighed in pure delight. They were perfect. She unfolded the note on top of the container.
Rhodey looked up from his meal. “You know it is. We wait only for the next food delivery so that we may be well stocked for our journey. What do you think of the Captain? Does he deserve all the praises sung to his name?”
Loki’s laugh quieted, and he brushed a tear from his eye. “This is too good. An army of two, trying to bring down an entire kingdom. Both caught before they could do more than smash a few engines. And now I find that your misguidance is far more comprehensive than I could have ever imagined. Guards, release him.”
“There was an attack downtown by a magic user or possible unregistered mutant. She touched Tony, and he went down. He’s been unresponsive ever since. She put the Hulk to sleep too, but instead of knocking him out, it brought me back. She was tranked by a SHIELD agent, and I dragged Tony home. When he didn’t wake up and I couldn’t find anything on my scans, I called Dr. Strange and you guys.”
They decided to look for a cave big enough to fit all of them, and picked a direction at random to start their search. Being in such a large group provided safety in numbers, and Tony felt himself relaxing as the others joked around. Clint loved to make stupid jokes and Natasha’s dry whit shocked a few laughs out of him. Thor was relentlessly cheerful, and this was the first time Tony had seen Bruce start to open up. Steve seemed happier and more open too, now that the group was reunited and everyone was safe and accounted for.
“Plans?” Steve squeaked, going even redder. This was hilarious. Tony wondered how far he could push him.
“You broke our only form of transportation so you could trick Tony into fixing the heater? What the hell is wrong with you, things were fine the way they were!”
Tony had nodded tearily and Yinsen had died less than a day later, leaving him as the mine’s impromptu medic.
The first contestant entered and the skill trials begin. Each contestant was ranked between 1 and 12, the higher the better. There was no set requirements for what they had to do, it was up to the contestant to show off what they thought was most impressive.
Thank you for reading! I'm trying a new way of getting formatting so let me now if anything looks weird.
It's a little graphic and it's fine if you don't want to read it, I always summarize the plot at the top of the next chapter so you won't miss anything.
Someone knocked on the door. Was ten minutes alone so much to ask for? Between Natasha the spy and Sam the counselor they never left him be. He stood up and yanked open the door.
“Very funny,” Steve said and walked down the hall to the conference room where everyone would be meeting. The room was mostly empty, which was unsurprising since they were ten minutes early. Carol Danvers sat at the head of the table, as was her right as the leader of the hosting pack. A black woman with short hair and a gold necklace sat beside her, and on her other side was Tony.
He wasn’t pretending? Before he could make it past that, Steve leaned forward and pressed their lips together again, gentler than last time. He pulled back slowly, his face blushing red.
Natasha shrugged and got up, and everyone left to suit up. As Steve pulled on his uniform he realized that he hadn’t given anyone a choice to come or not. If they hadn’t wanted to, surely they would have spoken up? Maybe not. He worried about Scott, who had the most to lose and the largest amount of hero worship. Were they following the advice of their friend Steve who they knew through experience always tried his best? Or were they afraid the challenge the legendary Captain America, who always made the most perfectly correct choice and did the right thing? Things to reflect upon later, when the other half of the team wasn’t in danger.
“You only do it when we’re pretending. I don’t want to pretend any more.” His grip on Tony’s shoulders tightened. “You told me the first kiss didn’t matter…that it didn’t count unless I wanted it to. I want it to count, and I want you to make this one count too.”
“One of these days I’m going to eat you.” he threatened. She nosed his hand, looking for a treat. He opened his palm to show her it was empty. She gave it a lick anyway, then returned to the grass. Steve stroked her back. He wouldn’t eat her. She was a milk cow, not the type for eating. And he always had had a small soft spot for Dottie. How could you not admire a cow with a sense of adventure? Scrap the circus, he should call Hollywood, tell them to come out here and make a movie about his intrepid cow and her three bumbling ranchers. Four now, though he didn't think Tony would take too kindly to being called bumbling. Or even a rancher. He marveled to himself that for the first time since Clint was born, the pack had gotten larger. And after he married Tony, maybe- yikes, no, not going there. They weren't getting married married, they were getting…. convenience married? Alliance married? They would not be adopting any kids and turning them to pack. Which he was totally cool with. Yup. Not the least bit disappointed. He would just turn the tables and play match maker for Jan and Clint instead, then be the coolest uncle in the entire world.
Tony nodded frantically as they fingered their weapons. “I have a compass. And a blanket. I’m very useful.”
“Don't get starstruck, you need to milk this for all it's worth. Do you think there's anything the Queen wouldn't do for a crown jewel?”
Christine paced back and forth, riling up the nonexistent crowd. “We have have excellent set contestants this year, are you ready to meet them?”
There was a deep sigh on the other end of the line. “Keep doing what you’re doing, and mention the company as much as you can in a positive light. And I’m signing your name to a book deal.”
Steve’s mind was reeling. “Why?” He asked, trying to process the monumental news and figure out if it was true.
“I’d love some. Maybe I could stop by your lab, and you could show me a few tricks.” he said with a charming smile. He leaned closer to say something else, but before he could get a word out, Steve pulled Tony up off the bench.
Tony threw it as far as he could, curling up into a ball and covering his face. His clothes were soaked through, and his teeth were chattering so hard it hurt. Overhead there was another cannon blast. That made three. Tony forced himself back to his feet and kept searching through the woods, picking directions at random, lost in the blinding white. He stumbled upon the river. It was frozen solid, the only sign it was there a long dip in the height of the snow. Maybe Steve was in the cave? The one from the first day, where they had been safe and warm together. Tony waded through the snow upstream, searching for any dip or mound that might signal he was there. Another cannon sounded. Four. One left.
Oh God, Steve was going to murder him, he was actually going to murder him. Tony turned tail and ran, charging down the hallway as Steve yelled at him and the other contestants held him back.
“That sounds boring. I’m not going to take a girl to some stuffy museum. How about some places to eat? I could go for some dinner right now.”
Bucky would be stuck in wolf form until the stitches came out, so they would need to figure out a ramp of some sort. But that was a problem for later. Steve went back to his room where he collapsed into bed, alone.
“Phil Coulson, of Shield. After a lack of justice through human courts about werewolf matters, a group of like minded wolves decided to come together and create a peace keeping force. I sent you a letter?”
Steve continues to have a rough time. After the events of the previous day, Tony is going back to his pack, but things delay his return.
They were all hanging out in a little room off to the side except for Jan, and the tall woman, Pepper, who were both off somewhere with Tony. Bucky was missing too. They hadn’t seen him since he spent the night a week ago. They waited as the guests filed in and sat down in folding chairs lined up to fill the barn. It wasn’t a real barn, the floor was perfectly clean and fairy lights hung from the eves. He had been horrified at the rehearsal when Tony had explained to him that it was designed to look like a barn, but was only used for themed weddings. Waste of a perfectly good building, if you asked him. All they were doing was signing a paper and having a party, they could do that anywhere. His ma had gotten married out back by the grapevine trellis, and she had been happy enough with that.
“If the dragon dies, so does their rider. Mark my words, as long as the Captain is alive, his dragon is lurking somewhere on this mountain. I for one don’t want to be here when the dragon decides to burn this camp to the ground to help his rider escape.”
“I didn’t, not one bit. I sat on the couch. The rest of the team made and then cleaned up dinner and I didn’t help. I made out with my boyfriend and gossiped with friends. No Captain America things.”
“I don’t have a lot of shame, but I’m not willing to blow you on national television. Pass me the pills.”
“Shut up! I know no one is coming for me, alright?” he yelled, and Steve’s eyes widened at his vehemence. He continued, quieter. “No one is coming for me, I’m under the mercy of the games as much as you are. And maybe you think it makes me stupid, but I’m not going to kill anyone, and I’m not going to sit around and let someone die because somebody else decided that that was how its supposed to play out.”
“I guess we’ll both starve then. If you die first I’m eating your corpse. Would it still be cannibalism if I was in my wolf form and you’re human?”
Bucky shook his head sadly. “It’s only a few days. You think anything could keep me from you guys now that I know you’re alive? I just have a few suspicions I need to look into for the good of the pack, then I’ll be right back, promise.”
Steve grabbed his arm. “No, no, it’s fine. I’m up anyway now, right? Stay.” Tony settled back on his bed, his body still tense, ready to leave.
“By the end of the year you’ll know so much about cows you could write a book. You’ll be telling me cow facts. And I will already know them, because I’ve ate, breathed, and slept cows my entire life,” They arrived at the part of the fence that always broke, where Dottie liked to hang out. “So anyway, this is Dottie.”
Steve laughed. “You guessed right.” The smile dropped from his face. “I’m sorry I acted like that last night, you’ve been upfront with me from the start about this being about Christine. I shouldn’t have tried for more.”
Scott knocked on the outside of a jet, the sound echoing. “Does anyone have a key? Or know how to fly a jet? I’ve stolen a lot of things and somehow I’ve never stolen a jet before.”
Seeing as last time his missiles had had little effect, he used his laser to cut a swatch through the birds, creating a brief empty space before they poured back in. Nothing was working, and now people were ragging on his cooking again.“Seriously guys? Twice in one day? We already had this conversation, let it go! It's not like I poisoned your grandmas or something!”
Write a new operating system in a week? Easy. Code an artificial intelligence? Sure. But a book? He had barely made it through high school English, there was no way he was going to write a whole book. He had better things to do.
“I wasn’t offered much of a choice. Raza thought I might be useful, and without this alliance I would not have made it this far through this special hell of ours. I’m not one for violence, and it’s hard to win a game of death when you’re not willing to kill.”
He tilted his head to the side and looked over the current tribute, a thin boy dressed in ripped purple pants, with his torso and face painted green. This was why Tony never trusted the stylists. Why would they dress the poor guy like this? Awful.
Loki stepped forward into the circle of men, the golden horns of his helm glinted sharply. He came to a stop in front of Tony, and looked down on him.
Jarvis nodded and lead him into the house and down the hall to a room spilling over with noise and light. Steve entered and found it was a kitchen, and he paused in the doorway to take in the scene. A brown haired woman stood at the stove stirring a pot of pasta, and the smell of pie whafted from the oven. Jarvis gave her a kiss and joined her at the stove. Through the doorway Steve could see the dining room where all of the Avengers sat along with Pepper, Happy and Rhodey. Two clawed robots tried to set the table. At the kitchen counter a blonde woman chopped peppers for a salad while Tony stood beside her, laughing and peeling a carrot with easy strokes. He looked up and spotted Steve, his face breaking into a wide smile.
“Where were you?” Natasha asked angrily. “He’s dying, and you decided to wander off? We agreed to stick together.”
He held it out and Tony took it with a suspicious look. “I wasn’t here to ask about the coat. I wanted to talk about what we needed to do to get our relationship to a point where it won’t affect the rest of the team.”
Tony sighed and straightened up. “I told you up front, day one, that I hated cows. They’re for eating and eating only, preferably prepackaged from the store as hamburgers. Juicy, juicy, hamburgers.” He said the last part to Dottie, who looked at him curiously. Steve let out an exaggerated gasp. He covered Dottie’s ears and she shook his hands off with any annoyed moo. Steve settled for stroking her back.
Clint shrugged. “Yeah, no. Not really my thing. And I doubt you'll convince Nat or Bruce either. Maybe Thor if he's back from Arizona, though he's supposed to be there at least another week. It's probably just going to be you and two hundred of your closest celebrity friends.”
So that was what it felt like to confess your love, Steve thought to himself. It didn’t go the way it did in movies, no running through airports or yelling from the rooftops or boomboxes involved.
He had drawn a rough diagram of it along with numbers at the top on a sheet of paper, which he pulled out of his pocket and handed to him, leaving black fingerprints all over it. Clint looked at it while Tony stared sadly at his still black hands. He wiped them on his pants again to no effect, and shrugged to himself and gave up. He looked up at Clint and narrowed his eyes.
He stepped outside into the brisk air once again. He grabbed the pails from the barn and went to the field where the cows grazed. Dottie approached him first. “Hey girl. How are you? Are you going to be a good cow today and stay inside the fence? Or is today your big break? I think you should go for it, I think today's the day.”
Bruce rubbed the cream over all of Thor’s burned skin, and by the end he opened his eyes and the group cheered. Clint helped Thor sit up and lean against a tree
That was anticlimactic. Was he actually just checking? In that case... “Speaking of which, I don’t suppose you could fix the water heater too?”
He squeezed him tight and let go, laying back down on his bed. To his surprise, Tony laid down with him, resting a hand on his chest.
“Enough. I will not be persuaded on this matter. I admire your forgiving nature, but after watching so many friends fall under the blade and my dragon shot from the sky, I have no more room for mercy in my heart.”
“I am nothing to the king now, because he has been slain by one of Stark’s swords, wielded by Loki’s hand. The both of them are in their stolen castle, counting their riches and tightening their hold over the kingdom as we speak.”
“What? I’m not allowed to have a boyfriend?” He asked indignantly. Sure he was a little hopeless in the romance department, okay, maybe very hopeless (several inches worth according to Tony), but still… it's not like this was impossible. Bucky saw his face and verbally back peddled, holding up his hands.
They got six mines before Tony threw up his hands and refused to dig anymore. He got to his feet and limped a few steps before Raza stepped out from the trees and got in his face. “Where do you think you’re going?”
Tony crossed Yinsens’ arms across his chest and brushed the hair out of his face. He zipped his jacket all the way up to the top to hide the cut, and it almost looked like he was ok. He covered him in one of the blankets from the backpacks and swung the bag over his shoulder and picked up a walking stick. Overhead the motors of a hovercraft roared, slowly descending to pick up the body.
There was a silence over the comms then Cap said, “You're fighting the birds, aren't you,” in a resigned tone.
He kept his hands over his ears and his eyes to the ground until the leaves were once again hidden in shadow as the broadcast ended and the light faded away. He let his arms fall to the ground and he closed his eyes.
Natasha lowered Steve down into the tunnel. It wasn’t very tall, maybe 5 feet, and thick wires and gas lines ran along the wall. It was lit brightly with emergency lighting, and twenty feet down each side there was a door, which was tightly locked shut. Once Steve gave the all clear, the rest of the group came down, Steve giving an extra hand to Tony and Thor. Natasha swung the door of the tree shut and for the moment, they were completely safe. There were no traps, no cameras, and no other tributes. They all heaved a collective sigh of relief.
“Ok fine, I’ll fill the bigger one with baking powder then use the little one to scoop out the amount I already put in.”
He was doing a much better job of acting this time, Tony noticed. If he didn’t know better he would even think Steve was happy to be sitting on him, leaning close with half lidded eyes, one hand on his shoulder balled in his shirt, and the other sliding down the small of his back.
“It’s just a dumb ring, it doesn’t matter.” Tony insisted. “I never met my grandpa anyway, so it’s better I don’t have to use his ring. This is totally fine.”
Steve was released from the hospital the next day, and Tony wheeled him outside and helped him into a chair inside the jet, where he settled with a groan. If he was normal he would have been there another few days at least. His fast healing and the risk of someone coming after him while he was down made the move back to the compound the smartest choice. Tony returned the wheelchair to the nurse and buckled himself in beside Steve.
“And hombres.” Steve agreed. “Wait, hombres? It's amigos, Clint. Anyway, we swear to always have your back, through good times- ”
He pet Dottie some more. “No cloudy thoughts on sunny days”, he told her. She nosed the fence. It stayed solid. She looked at him with utter disappointment. More like 'udder' disappointment, he laughed to himself. Dottie walked off. No one appreciated his puns around here. He packed up the wire and pliers and took them back to the barn. He was making decent progress on his to do list today, despite all the interruptions. He picked up a pitch fork and started tossing the hay and sweeping up the barn. By the time he finished, it was dark outside. He put the pitch fork back where it belonged, and went inside the house to his room. He pulled off his clothes and stepped into the shower. The water was cold. He’d ask Tony to fix the water heater next. He dried off and went downstairs to the kitchen, where Jan was putting together sandwiches while Tony took apart the stove top. Ok, water heater after the stove top.
She batted him over the head with a folder. “Because you are the CEO and share the same name as the company! It’s their job to shut down any social media accounts pretending to be you, or defaming your name. You drag your name through the mud enough on your own, we don’t need people making things up too.”
On the other hand, the thought of watching Toy writhe on the ground like that while Steve stood by helpless was unbearable. It had been painful to watch as antagonists, now that Tony was
“Well Captain, I guess we've found what Kane meant by a complete set. A missing piece of the Crown Jewels, held by a collector in America of all places!” He shook his head in disbelief and turned back towards Raymond. “Please expect a call from the Queen in the next week.”
Tony braced himself against the wall, keeping himself from sliding all the way down to the floor. What was wrong with this guy? He hadn’t been doing anything to deserve being roughed up! “Hey!” Tony yelled, his confidence coming back now that he had more space to breathe.  “What have I ever done to you?”
Steve let his head loll to the side, where there was a smear of ash and blood on the concrete where the man had been standing. There were similar spots spread all the way down the street. Gross.
“You can have water.” Tony got up and came back with a bottle of water, which he opened and handed to Steve. He took a drink and Tony sat back down with an annoyed huff.
Or option two, Tony was being a sentimental idiot about his security codes. Not everyone was as nice as Steve and Tony was going to be in a world of pain if he had other cracks in his security like this. That was probably all this was. Tony being careless. The man who had never had a security breach in all the years Steve had known him, who reset the codes every month, who had Friday double checking everything. Maybe, for once, Tony forgot. He certainly forgot his jacket enough.
A woman in scrubs injected a tracker in the corner of Tony's elbow and he rubbed it where it stung. The nurse checked the screen and nodded at the peacekeepers. She left the room and the guards advanced with batons raised until the two of them were backed onto the platform, where the walls of a tube rose from the floor, trapping them inside. With the click of the glass against the ceiling the shock Tony had been in wore off. He pounded on the glass, screaming.
Steve strode quickly through the halls of the tower to the basement lab, Clint and Natasha close on his heels. They had been on a mission for SHIELD in Colorado when they had gotten a call that Tony was down. They had waited a tortuous half hour before their replacements had shown up, then they had boarded the quinjet and flown back to New York immediately.
Tony looked up at him, his face impassive, before looking down to continue working on the wings. “He’s nice.”
A hart is a red deer, they show up a lot in medieval stories. There is a story about one of King Arthur's knights who must chase down a white hart, and during the journey learns the value of mercy. Plus I liked how it looks similar to 'heart', like dear heart, deer hart? I thought it was neat.
Was it weird to daydream about this stuff? Better than what he usually thought about, which was Bucky, and Ma, and how Bucky would never get to have a family of his own, and Ma would never get to meet his kids and spoil them rotten.
Steve wondered vaguely at what Tony’s perfect world might look like as he asked the most important question. “How do we get him back?”
Tony looked down at their hands then back up. “If you’re interested, I could do the same for you. Show you the ropes.”
They had one last interview with the contestants tomorrow night, where they would be discussing the scores and their strategies for the arena. If he could sneak away before or after the show, he might be able to catch Steve for a quick minute. The next morning they would be inside the arena, and it would be too late. The puzzle would remain unsolved.
“Look. Let’s start over. You stop mentioning things I won’t understand, and I’ll stop assuming you’re making fun of me when you do make a reference. We both don’t want to fight, so let’s just talk about something else.”
“Our souls are tied, we are meant to be,” Steve insisted. To him, everything was black and white. Loki was bad, the Dragon Guard was good, and he and Tony were going to end up together, simple as that.
“I’ve got this, alright?” They made eye contact for a few seconds, and Jan huffed. She spun on her heel and left the room. Tony resettled himself on the side of the bed, bouncing it slightly. He sat in silence for a few seconds, absentmindedly rubbing his hand on the sheet, then stopped when he realized he was getting it dirty. He looked at Steve, who was still turned away, ignoring him to the best of his ability.
Sometimes the world was so large, and so complicated. It used to be that there were the good guys and the bad guys, and Steve’s path was clear. Nothing was simple anymore. Both sides had dark sides, and good people. Shield would send him out on missions claiming that it was for the greater good, and Steve would come home with his hands bloody and his conscience heavy. Then what he thought was the good side had ended up being Hydra. Tony had always been his one good thing. He didn’t have to think hard to know that taking care of Tony was good and right.
“Near the edge of the arena, on the west side. We were on the east side when were separated, and I’d like to see if anyone is still hanging around the tree leading to the tunnel. That’s where we agreed to meet if we were separated and all of the others are still alive so they might be there too.”
After an exciting few hours, Tony ended up with several cardboard boxes filled with old electronics. They went back to the hotel to drop it all off, and Steve lead him to the next restaurant mentioned in the book.
Yinsen fared poorly. Having always been a scholarly man, he had trouble keeping up with the pace that the overseer demanded and Tony was still too weak to help pick up his slack. They gave him ten lashes every day he was short on his quota, and by the end of the first month Yinsen was too weak to stand. He had called Tony over, and pressed his medical bag into his arms with shaking hands.
Steve passed over a cherry and a blue raspberry, and grabbed the same for himself. They went up to the cashier who rolled her eyes at two adults buying nothing but ring pops, and dutifully rung them up. They walked out of the store, and as Tony reached for the bag Steve pulled it away. “So which are for eating and which are for marrying?”
Tony pulled away a little, now composed, and shook his head. “I don’t want to take some other person’s family ring, in some sort of loop of shitty luck. We’ll figure something out later.”
The thing was, Tony was horribly sentimental. He worked on his dad’s old car and set a screen saver of it to his computer. They had had one of their biggest fights because Steve had thrown out Tony’s ratty old robe and it had turned out to have been his father's. JARVIS was named after Edwin Jarvis, the family butler. The piano sitting in the lobby was his mother’s, he had the same robot rolling around his lab that he had built when he was seventeen, and he still had the arc reactor plaque that Pepper had made him. He had always took their anniversaries very seriously, planning things a full month in advance because he felt commemorating their relationship was important. Of course, he got the dates wrong because Tony couldn’t keep track of a date to save his life. Steve still appreciated the effort. Getting a look at his room would give Steve a much better idea of where Tony was at. Tony never talked about his feelings, he just bleed them over everything he did, from building gear to keep the team safe to offering them a place to stay to coincidentally finding the exact set of paints that Steve had been wanting but couldn’t justify the expense. It would be a very Tony thing to do, to keep a old shirt of Steve’s in the back of his closet or to take a picture or two that he would keep face down on his desk. Or to have pictures of the team with the rogue Avengers cut out. No one ever said Tony wasn’t dramatic.
“Tony,” Steve said gently. “We don't know what's going on and we can't risk hurting the hostage. Please let me try to talk it out, I'll use the old captain America charm, yeah? And the second he makes a threatening move you do your thing and come in guns a blazing. Just trust me.”
“You can double check the numbers right here. Monthly compounding on the original loan adds up to more than you have there. Sorry, son. It’s not enough.”
Tony had been hoping for more, but getting this had been risky enough as it was. His face hurt from where he had been hit and his hands hurt from hitting the glass and he didn’t even want to look at his ankle. He wondered how Steve was doing, entering the games just as beaten up and hungover to boot. The start had been so frantic he couldn’t remember if he had seen him. What if Steve was already dead? The thought bothered him. Steve might have been crazy but he was sweet in his own way and didn’t deserve to die on the first day in the arena.
The armor held out a hand and Steve heard the familiar sound of a repulsor charging. Steve closed his eyes. The shot fired, and Steve flinched.
Tony sat back in his chair. No matter what happened next, the defenses were down and the rebels were in.
“I wasn’t supposed to be gone this long. The other people I was with will be worried about me. Plus I have a few questions for them. Some of the things they told me… it doesn’t matter. I’ll be back in time for the wedding.”
Steve was watching him closely. He seemed to want to say something, then shook his head as if dismissing the idea. Tony laid down, and closed his eyes. Weariness had sunken into his bones, and he wanted nothing more than to sleep. Steve had no intention of letting him do so. Now that his health had somewhat recovered, so had his curiosity.
“But you’ll try. You know who’s in charge, and you’ve built all the weapons they use to maintain their power over the districts. They’ll listen, or you’ll burn them to the ground.” Steve said, his eyes steely.
Tony had never been hurt before. He had been a quiet and studious child, spending his lunches inside studying instead of playing. Even as he got more adventurous as he aged, he was still kept safe. All dangerous activities were banned from the Capital, and their medical technology had advanced to a point that they could heal any injury fully within minutes of it being received. When he got sick, he took a pill and was better seconds later. When he sprained his ankle on the stairs, he was fully healed and back on his way seconds after the medical team arrived.
That didn’t make him feel any better. Once the games were over (and assuming that they both lived despite the fact that that was a clear violation of the rules) Steve was going to go back to his district, and Tony was never going to see him again. Steve hated the Capital, he wouldn’t want to stay there with Tony, and Tony couldn’t leave for the districts until he found out who was misusing his weapons.
“I’m being a baby? My life is over! Jan’s life is over! And you wanna be part of the pack? Fine! Your life can be over too!”
Tony stepped back, half in shock. Steve grabbed him and hid his face in his shoulder, and Tony could feel him shuddering.
“We can do lemon. Since you’re going to trust some stranger from the internet over your own boyfriend.”
This was...fine. It was fine. Sure it felt like his heart been ripped out now, but he would get over it, like he got over everything. They had already broken up, it’s not like this was news. Steve stared at the ceiling and tried to convince himself that it didn’t hurt.
Steve stepped between Tony and the shelf of hot sauce, a panicked look on his face. “No! You are not trying any more hot sauce!”
They returned to the mine again the next morning, Steve’s slight limp the only thing betraying his wound. He walked on his own now, and pounded away at the rock alongside the others. Tony unwound his bandages at lunch, and the cut was fully closed, appearing as though it was weeks old instead of days. Tony shook his head in disbelief.  “I know not how, but you are well.”
“I’m not perfect. If I see a situation pointed south, I can't ignore it. I have to step in. Maybe you’re there, maybe you’re not. Maybe I go down when someone shoots me. Maybe I get taken out by rubble. It’s an honor to die fighting to protect people.” He looked up at Tony, hoping he would understand. He was shaking his head.
They both stared at each other wide eyed. Tony started babbling. “Oh man I made you swear, that’s not good, it only took me ten minutes to ruin Captain America, Fury’s going to kill me.”
After he sent the other two off to work, Steve went though the old containers in the back of the barn until he found the paint. Most of it was too dried out or separated to use, and he dumped sawdust in it and threw it in the trash. They ended up only having two usable colors, yellow and orange. He picked the closet color to what they had now. Looked like it was going to be a red and orange barn. The important part was to cover up the wood so it wouldn't warp any further. He went outside with his paint, and gave the door a rough sand. Then he applied the paint in thick, even strokes. He had always enjoyed painting. It was relaxing as long as you weren't doing too big or small of a space, and it left his mind free to wander. His mind went to Bucky and Ma, just like it always did. It was too nice of a day for that, Ma always told him to avoid cloudy thoughts on a sunny day. So instead he thought about Tony. It wasn’t hard. Since meeting him, he took up an annoyingly large amount of his mind. This morning had been nice. Breakfast had been fine, and he was fixing their furnace right now. If you weren't gonna judge a man by his ability to fix large household appliances, what else would you judge him on? They had gotten along much better today, now that they'd both had some time to calm down. Steve wasn't too proud to admit he'd been in a piss poor mood all yesterday, and taken out most of it on Tony. Not that he didn't give it all back with interest, cussing him out before he even learned his name. He wondered what Stane had told him to convince him to come out here. He didn't like the ranch, and they didn't have much else to offer. If Jan went behind his back like she was wont to do, and convinced Tony to stay, he'd ask her. Lots of things would happen if he stayed. They wouldn't have to worry about the bank taking the ranch for another couple months, maybe ever. And if he could fix the heater and truck, he could probably fix the sink and the electric fence too. Plus the stove, and maybe even the window latch. And he would be someone to talk to beside Clint and Jan. They were great, he loved them, just not for twelve hours at a time, seven days a week. Lot of upsides to him staying. It would probably be worth it even if he was a jerk. Which he totally was. Though now in the sunshine, with the painting brush dragging smoothly in his hand, that didn’t seem like as big of an obstacle as it had the previous day. You actually needed to be a bit of an asshole to fit in at the ranch, he admitted to himself.
Steve clasped a hand to his shoulder. “We are now much stronger because of the fine people who have rallied with you, and do not forget that I still owe you my life. Everyone here will show you the utmost respect, or feel the full weight of my disapproval. Now eat, drink. Is there anything else you need?”
He took it all back, he was not ok with Tony dating someone else. If Tony was going to be happy with someone, it should have been him. Why hadn’t it been him? When he was younger he had assumed it was because he was scrawny and bruised up from back alley fights. Now people asked to take his photo and he could bench press a car, and he still couldn’t get the person he liked to look at him twice.
Tony had always been told that people in the districts thought that computers were the work of witches and any school beyond learning to spell made them prey to the devil. Who was this guy? Was he special? Who had he learned from? Were there other people in the districts like him?
Or had Obie been distant from the start, viewing Tony in terms of how much usefulness he could squeeze out of him while plying him with false praise and honey words?
“Sometimes I can't even wrap my head around your levels of cheesiness and team spirit.” He said to Steve as he switched to thermal images and quickly located the only heat signature not registered to his team. Make that two heat signatures. One was the man controlling the birds, the orb he was holding was showing up as colder than the surroundings.
“This is a joke. This is a joke! Good job Obie, you really got me! Time to let me out now!” Tony paced back and forth frantically.
“We were getting this. It’s for his burns.” Steve carefully passed the container over to Bruce, who looked it over and used his fingers to spread some of the cream over the blisters on Thor’s arm. The skin healed back to a healthy pink as soon as the cream touched it, and the people in the group from the districts gasped. Tony didn’t know why they were impressed. Wasn’t that how all medicine worked? Surely they had medicine in the districts, the Capital would never deny them something like that, right?
“Over a decade of loops, and that’s the first time I’ve heard you say it.” Tony said. Steve took his hand and held on tight, and the men who died a million deaths both died for the second to last time.
Seemed like bringing him from zero to a complete rage was the Tony Stark special. It was almost impressive, in a weird way. He was starting to guess that the skill was mutual, judging by the color on Tony’s cheeks and the sharp glint in his eyes.
Steve shook him off, and rubbed his arm where Bucky fingers had made red marks. He felt like he was whining as he offered his defense. “It's not like it was my first choice. I was out of options and I had to keep the ranch somehow!”
Above him the wind rustled through the trees in a mournful whisper. A twig snapped and Tony tensed up. He pushed himself up to his knees and elbows then relaxed as he recognized the voice.
The problem was that all of the systems were unhackable, and Tony knew this because he had built all of them himself. He had also built himself a neat little back door. He knew it was going to come in handy.
“No, no, you’re fine, that was just really bizarre. You’re right, it’s a mountain lion. The commandos and I were trying to get into a Nazi base but didn’t have any way past the guard, and out of nowhere a mountain lion jumped out of tree and ripped the guy to shreds, got him out of the way and distracted the rest of the guards long enough for us to get inside. Afterwards we made the lion an unofficial Commando. It’s really weird that you guessed that.”
Loki sighed. “Disappointing. I was hoping for some better entertainment. A fight to the death, you kill each other? Oh well, it will be plenty of fun to have a public trial. And everyone loves a good hanging. Guards, take them to the prison and send Hammer up here. We need to start fixing the planes.”
“Glad to see we finally got ahold of the holy hand grenade,” joked Tony. “But why did they decided to come here?”
“Stay positive Tony,” returned Cap. “There's nothing we can't do when we work together. Do you see the hostile anywhere?”
“Let’s just go, we don’t need to talk to her.” Steve said. He grabbed Tony’s arm and he shook him off angrily.
Tony shifted and before Steve could stop him he jumped on his former guardian, snarling and biting. Stane let out a gurgling laugh and knocked Tony across the room, where he hit the wall with a thud and lay still. In a second Steve was shifted and his suit fell off him in tatters. He charged at Stane, Bucky right behind him, leaping up. Even the weight of two full grown wolves was not enough to bring Stane down as he continued to grow, and he swiped them off with a snarl. Steve rolled across the floor and quickly regained his feet. He saw Clint and Jan preparing to shift and he ran over to them, grabbing Jan’s sleeve in his teeth and dragging her towards Tony. They got the idea and ran to help the downed wolf, which kept them safely out of Stane’s path.
He smiled half genuinely and half out of pure nervous panic, then schooled his face and nodded back solemnly.
“We’re going to negotiate the terms of our return to the US and to the Avengers, I have a list of reasons why it would be beneficial to all parties-”
Stark men were made of iron and Tony hasn't cried since he was four, but he was crying now, water soaking into Steve’s jacket.
One night at the bar, he had been talking with a drunk girl. Steve liked talking to drunk people, because they never noticed when he stomped all over the social cues he was supposed to be hitting, and if he really messed up and pissed someone off, there was a decent chance they wouldn't remember it the next morning. They also had no filter, so he didn't have to try and guess if their words had some sort of secondary meaning he was missing because he hardly ever left the ranch. They were just honest. Plus sometimes they fell over and it was funny. So he was talking to a drunk girl, and she was going on and on about Bucky, just like every other person he had met since he was eleven and he had thought Margie Kepler was going to ask him out, and instead had asked him to introduce her to his brother. Steve didn't care. Ok, maybe he cared a little. The problem was, something about him was just so fundamentally good, you couldn't hate him no matter what he did. And it wasn't Bucky's fault people liked him better, Steve just wanted to know why. And he wanted one person to like him. Bucky could have the whole town hanging off his arm, and Steve wouldn't care as long as he knew that there was someone, just one person at the bar waiting specifically for him, Steve Rogers. Not Bucky’s kid brother, not Bucky's plus one, not the guy that got invited since he was here the last time and maybe if they invited him, Bucky would be more likely to show up. He explained all of this to the drunk girl, and she nodded her head.
He should just tie the two of them to chairs, duct tape over their mouths, and finally get some peace. Course, they’d probably just Houdini their way out and have taught themselves morse code and accidentally punched a hole in the wall he’d need to fix during the process. Forget the ranch, they should just hit the road as the Roger's pack circus. Come one, come all, come see the two most annoying dumbasses in the world! Watch as they drive their older cousin and technical legal guardian into a rage with just a sentence! Watch as they demolish this entire circus tent with just a paperclip and a used piece of chewing gum! And the final act can be witnessed just once a month, so grab your torches and pitchforks and come marvel at the amazing transformation of our beloved ringleader! Half man, half beast, an abomination against nature and the ultimate killing machine, he can usually be found out back mending the fence for the millionth time so his cows don’t wander off and get stuck in the ditch again. Yes Dottie, I’m talking about you, there is nothing good in there, there has never been anything good in there, none of the other cows do this! It’s just you! Her glared at her. Dottie didn’t care.
He looked up at Steve who nodded. Tony didn’t look happy about it but he stood up and brushed off his pants. In the past, Tony would have fought him on it. Would have said to keep them in, then Steve would have taken them out himself and done a bad job of it, then Tony would have gotten mad. Now, he stood up. “I’ll go get the scissors.”
The man snarled. “Captain America is supposed to have everything under control! Know exactly what to say and do!
Steve jerked back as if struck. “I would never.” He stepped forward and took Tony’s hands, his grip warm and firm. “Cease dealing in such wild propositions. Like this I can feel what you feel, and right now I can tell you want this as much as I do. Win or lose, tomorrow will be a day of grief, so let us be happy today.”
Tony was mildly offended. “Hey, I’m doing pretty well for myself. You’re the one who needed rescuing. You’re welcome, by the way. You can stay in my cave until the fires burn out. I disabled the flamethrowers nearby so this area should stay relatively safe except for the smoke in the air.”
It was Clint who eventually spotted Thor, and they all rushed over. Thor was half hidden under black soot, and it stained him from head to foot. He was lying on his face and when Natasha rolled him over they all gasped. Unlike the rest of them, he had been unable to find a refuge from the flames, and was horribly burnt, his skin red and blistering. He was breathing so weakly that if Bruce hadn’t confirmed he had a pulse, Tony would have thought that he was dead.
