“Clever,” Sherlock said. “I can see how you would be fond of that.” Too late, he realised who he was. A children’s advertiser, yes, and the owner of a hospital. He was completely in control here. Sherlock was powerless. He knew Smith. He had been keeping tabs on him ever since he had first seen him. There was something off about him. Something not quite right. He blamed the cocaine for not realising it sooner, and cursed himself. He was off his game.
“I’ll be back with the menus,” he said. He didn’t say anything about a candle. Sherlock was very grateful for that.
“Yes.” If he was going to be forced to talk to Mycroft about this, he would be as vague and unhelpful as possible. Maybe it was petty. He really didn’t care.
That party. Yes. The one where John stayed with him over his girlfriend, before the fall, before Mary. Nostalgia threatened to overwhelm him, so Sherlock turned to John and said, “Yes. That party. Do we need ornaments for the tree?”
“Then,” Sherlock said, “It’s been longer than six months, really.” Please don’t break up with me, John.
He pushed away everything he was concerned about, all the hurt and pain he felt about the morgue, and just held him.
He heard a noise from up above him. It sounded like someone was thrashing around in a bed. He strained his ears to listen better. It was possible that John was having a nightmare. At the sound of a strangled, choked sob, Sherlock crept to the base of the stairs. And then he heard John say his name. Abandoning all pretense, he went up to John’s room.
“What? No, I didn’t.” He put a hand to his forehead, beginning to think that this may have been a mistake. Harry was never ashamed of being gay. He wasn’t certain anymore that she would understand his ongoing crisis, but he didn’t have anyone else to go to.
John stayed out late sometimes. Sherlock knew this, and he knew he couldn’t control John, but did he have to be late? The least John could have done was text him.
Finally, Sherlock was dressed and ready to go. Lestrade led him to the altar, where he was to wait for John. Mycroft was officiating, and Lestrade was Sherlock’s best man. Harry was John’s best woman, or whatever the term was. Sherlock was unsure. The guests filed into the room and sat. He stared straight ahead, waiting. After what seemed like an eternity, the doors at the end of the hall opened. And Sherlock stopped breathing.
As the evening stretched on, John became more and more exhausted. He stopped poking at his computer. He switched the telly on, but barely paid attention. Sherlock watched him. John kept yawning and rubbing at his eyes. Sherlock moved from his chair to sit next to John on the couch.
In response, he placed his hand on John’s chest. His heartbeat was quick under his shirt. John reached up and covered Sherlock’s hand with his own, and Sherlock forgot how to breathe. “I didn’t want you to leave,” he murmured finally.
“I know,” Sherlock said. And he did. He imagined that John felt similarly to what Sherlock felt when John got married. Maybe in a different way, and maybe not as painful, but loss was loss.
“That’s nothing I can help you with,” Sherlock said coolly. “Now. If you-” Sherlock was interrupted by a wailing sound coming out of John’s pocket. John pulled a baby monitor out, looked at it, and left the room without a word. When he heard John’s footsteps on the stairs up to his bedroom, Sherlock entered the sitting room. He briefly considered picking up his violin to comfort Rosie, but her cries have mostly faded and he didn’t want to disturb her. Or have John come back down and yell at him.
Second chapter. I'm going to try and post updates at a minimum of once per week. This one was a bit quicker, because it was mostly prewritten and just needed to be edited. In the future, updates might take more time than this but I'll try to get them done as quickly as possible.
John let out a shout of laughter, startling Sherlock. “I’m an idiot! She wasn’t in love with you after all!”
John impulsively put his arm around Sherlock. Sherlock immediately collapsed into him, shaking once again. “I’m sorry,” John murmured. “I forgot-I’m sorry-”
“Do you actually want this, or is it just a way for you to get over Jeanette?” Sherlock whispered. John’s heart ached at the pain in his eyes.
“I don’t fucking care what you wanted,” John spit out. “Just leave me alone. I can’t be around people like you. How could you do this?”
He and John started talking. About everything and nothing. About what was best about dinner, and what preschool Rosie would go to when she was old enough. About telling Lestrade and Molly, and keeping the press from asking too many questions. About whatever crossed their minds. They stayed there, even as it got colder, even as the number of people around them slowly grew smaller.
Sherlock glanced up. Even that took effort. He was in pain, his whole body feeling like it was burning up. “Hello.”
The cab pulled away from the curb with a slight screech of tires. The ride seemed to drag on forever, and with every second John got more and more anxious. He had to stop himself from snapping at the driver, reminding himself that the driver had no idea what was at stake. It was only the life of the most brilliant man, no, person, he had ever met. He told Greg where he was, telling him to bring backup.
John handed Sherlock the food as soon as they stepped in the entryway, blowing on his hands and rubbing them together. He exhaled sharply. “Can you take that up to the flat? I want to check in with Mrs. Hudson.”
Mrs. Hudson came up later that afternoon bearing pastries and tea. Sherlock was curled on the couch with his back to the door. He heard her set the tray down and then her hand was on his shoulder.
John beamed at him. Warmth stirred in the bottom of Sherlock’s stomach. John handed Sherlock one of his bags and then followed him back inside. Their hands brushed several times in the entryway.
So, of course this case affected Sherlock personally. It affected John too, but John wasn't going to tell Sherlock that. They finally kissed, but now John's panicking. It definitely didn't help that Lestrade and other officers saw.
He clutched at his head as he remembered how it used to be. Coming home with John after cases, laughing in the cabs, talking in front of a fire. Now he had no one. A long walk home, in the chilly drizzle. An empty flat. No fire, no laughter, no talking. Just him, alone. The same way it had been since John got married. Really, since he had faked his death, but he and John and Mary used to sit up late and talk, which, while not ideal, was better than what he was left with now.
“Of course I style it, John.” He scowled. John’s hair was messed up a bit too, but it looked perfect.
Evening came far too quickly for Sherlock to come up with a clever plan to get John away from him so he could sneak out. Thankfully, an answer came in the form of Rosie. She was crying, and John couldn’t figure out for the life of him why.
John looked down at his plate, pushing a piece of egg around with his fork. “She’s fine. Back in rehab. I hope it’ll help this time.” Sherlock nodded. Rehabilitation wasn’t much fun. He hoped Harry would get it together, for John. And for herself. “Anyways,” John said with forced cheerfulness, “I’ll call her sometime soon. Let’s focus on Rosie’s presents right now.”
“Please, look after Rosie? I know I’ve asked a lot recently but Sherlock’s just left and I think...well, something might happen.”
Sherlock stood up, breathing heavily. “I don’t want help processing anything. Goodbye.” He stalked over to the door, pulling his coat off the hook on the wall.
“Hello, John,” Sherlock said smoothly. He kept his face mostly blank, but John could see the flicker of relief in his eyes. John loved him.
Sherlock marvelled at the fact he was holding John. Conditions were less than ideal, yes, but he was
“Can you hold her?” John asked him. Sherlock froze. He hadn’t been allowed to hold Rosie since, well, since Mary was alive. John was still speaking. Sherlock wrenched himself back into the present. “-breath smells horrible,” John finished, looking at him expectantly.
“I should be asking you the same thing.” John laughed humourlessly. “Seriously, Sherlock. How could you think this was a good idea?”
“Can I tell him?” Sherlock nodded assent. “The people were murdered at the sight of famous deaths of people who were gay. The victims were gay as well.”
The case deals with homophobia and famous (real-life) murders for being gay. Homophobia is the main theme of this chapter. It does not sugarcoat any of this topic. There is death and violence in this chapter, plus the F-slur.
The sensation overwhelmed him. His heartbeat sped up. John stayed sobbing beside him. Sherlock’s mind whirled. It wasn’t smart to leave John alone with Rosie in the flat, but he needed to escape. It was infuriating. He hadn’t expected to feel like this after their conversation. He’d expected to feel a lot better. And he did, in a way. But in a similar way he felt worse. The beginnings of a headache pressed against his temples. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly. Neither of them moved.
“See you then, Sherlock,” she said, her eyes filling with tears. She gave a small wave. Sherlock coughed. They filed out of the sitting room. John was the first to leave.
“Never mind!” He slammed the door shut and made his way jauntily into the kitchen. Wiggins. Where was he? What good was a live-in drug dealer if he wasn’t going to make you tea? He filled up the kettle and loudly banged it down onto the stove, then set it to boil.
And then he cursed himself for thinking that. John wouldn’t want that. Of course he wouldn’t. As much as Sherlock wanted to slip his hand into John’s, lace their fingertips together, it wasn’t something that could happen.
“Shh, shh. Mary.” John was smiling at her, tears in his eyes, nodding his head. He smoothed her hair back.
He stumbled out of his room an hour or so later, wiping sleep from his eyes. Lestrade was sitting on the couch, scrolling through his phone. Sherlock took a seat next to him without saying a word.
Laughter slipped past Sherlock’s lips and he regretted it instantly. That wasn’t an appropriate reaction to John’s obvious anger. He clapped a hand over his mouth but it was too late. To his great surprise, John’s frown softened and then he was laughing too. Sherlock ceased his laughter before John and felt lucky that he was allowed to watch. John’s back was still heaving, but he was smiling at Sherlock. And then he bent over so Sherlock couldn’t see his face. After a moment his laughter stuttered, a sad, broken sound. A sob escaped his lips and Sherlock knew he wasn’t laughing any more. He reached out tentatively, but changed his mind and withdrew his hand.
“Lestrade told me I should force you to tell me,” John added, hoping that was the right thing to say.
“Sorry,” John said, though he didn’t sound too apologetic. Sherlock leaned his head against John’s shoulder, allowing John to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
“John’s wife died, and you seemed to know him. At least I know he was your patient. I need you to tell me what to do. What the protocol for this situation is.”
If they were broken before, they were shattered now. Sherlock knew with certainty that nothing could mend this. The cracks were too deep, the scars jagged and rough. John would move on, like he always did. And Sherlock would be stuck, living without John until he died.
He hadn’t expected Mary to be there, not at all. His speech was automatically pushed to the back of his mind, and a strange cold feeling enveloped him. Things hadn’t been the same since, and he knew it was his own fault. John moved on. That’s what people
This is it. The end. I have to admit, I've been planning this chapter for weeks now but it was more difficult to write out than I had anticipated. Anyways, here it is.
“I couldn’t bear to live without you, though. After your wedding I waited and I waited for you to call. I thought, maybe John is busy. Maybe after his Sex Holiday he’ll finally call me. Maybe we’ll be able to go on cases. But no. I waited and you never showed up. Maybe that was selfish of me, but I didn’t expect my own best friend to just drop me. The only thing that helped was the drugs. Do you know what I hallucinated, John? I hallucinated you. It was the only time I could see you. They weren’t even good hallucinations. You accused me. We didn’t solve a case. We failed. But you were there, and an angry John is better than no John at all. You can’t possibly know what that is like. I never have felt this way. I don’t
“Yes, but you’re my idiot,” Sherlock said, and kissed the top of his head again. “Would it bother you if I went?” His voice changed, became more uncertain with a rough edge of sadness.
He stared up at the ceiling. It was probably better for him to try to sleep. That way, he’d be able to avoid John as long as possible. Sleep came faster than he’d thought it would.
Sherlock entered the memory. Himself, wearing a t-shirt in the cool September air. It was nearing the end of lobster season, and he was lucky enough to be able to go. The wind ruffled his curls as the motor gunned. He was told to stand in the cabin of the boat and watch as the sternman hauled and reset the traps. The bright orange of their grundéns contrasted with the brilliant aqua of the ocean.
“I used to think the world of you,” John admitted. Sherlock’s heart froze over. “You were my best friend. You were the most important person in my life. I would do anything for you. Then you left and something changed.”
John was fully dressed and standing near the table when Sherlock came out of the shower. He was too lazy to change into anything more than his pyjamas and a dressing gown. Rosie was squirming in John’s arms.
Sherlock dragged himself out of bed when the room grew lighter, back to the chair by the window. He would leave as soon as he could. He would sign himself out, go back to Baker Street, and finally feel the relief of cocaine. Wiggins would surely still be there. He knew Wiggins, and Wiggins wouldn’t leave a place unless he deemed it truly unsafe or uncomfortable.
“It’s not okay.” He closed his eyes. He could still see John, falling backwards. Still heard the shot, ringing in his ears.
“I don’t know if I know that one,” John admitted, and felt Sherlock chuckle against him. “Why do you like it?”
Smith seemed completely at ease. Sherlock’s teeth were on edge. He wanted Smith to leave. His throat still felt constricted. His hand twitched. He’d start going through withdrawal within a few hours, probably. Depending on how long he was sedated. Smith set his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock squirmed. Smith’s fingers tightened. “You’re beautiful, you know. So young. It’s such a shame you’ll have to die.”
“No. Stop talking. You have no right to come here and talk about John. It is incredibly painful in ways you wouldn’t even understand. I don’t care what you think you know. You’re wrong. Wrong. I can’t be in love with John. Please leave.” He felt a small spark of remorse curling in the pit of his stomach at the pained expression at Molly’s face, but didn’t care enough to stop. “I’m doing what I have to do, Molly. Isn’t that what we all do? Do what we must to survive?”
“What else was I supposed to say?” Sherlock slammed a hand onto the desk, causing Rosie to emit a startled cry. “‘John, I don’t want you to go back to Mary? John, she shot me and it made me start to hate her? John, I miss you and wish things would improve? John, I regret all my bad choices but please don’t leave me for her?’” John’s mouth dropped open, understandably so. Sherlock hadn’t ever snapped like this before. At least not at him. “My point is, John, that you have hurt me so incredibly much. I’ve tried to push it away for your wellbeing, but I can’t keep it inside any longer. I want to forgive you, truly I do. I also don’t want it to seem like I haven’t done anything wrong to you. I have, time and time again. Yet I keep trying to rectify it. You’ve seemed reluctant to even talk about it before today.” Sherlock was speaking quite loudly now. “I don’t know how I can move on from this. I don’t know. I think part of it is that you’re being spectacularly ignorant about how much I care for you.” Perhaps that was giving too much away, but he was too angry to care any more. “I do not care for many people. I care for you. I have always cared for you. I don’t want to do this any more.”
He thought maybe he could have been in love with Sherlock before that, but his death forced him to forget all about that. And then came Mary, whom he really did love. Until she shot Sherlock. It had been difficult for him to forgive her, to essentially pick her over Sherlock. But he did. Because he and Sherlock were just friends, and Mary was his wife. Then, of course, there was the issue of Sherlock leaving his wedding. He couldn’t blame him honestly. He imagined how painful it must have been, and all he wanted to do was to hold him tight and promise never to hurt him like that again.
“Oh, Sherlock.” The look she gave him was pure pity. Normally, he hated pity. This time though, he didn’t feel any of the usual anger. Just blank nothing.
“It’s okay. I’m here.” John kept his voice low. He reached up and gently removed Sherlock’s hands from his face, cradling them in his own. He held them tight and gradually the shaking stopped. “Now tell me what happened.”
“I have a question,” John said, leaning against the back of the couch and intertwining his fingers with Sherlock’s. Sherlock motioned for him to continue. “How did you...how are you not ashamed of being gay?”
John placed it in their cart. Rosie reached for it and pouted when she couldn’t grasp it. John kissed the top of her head. Sherlock turned away, pretending to look at the other decorations.
“Yes, you do.” Sherlock scanned the room, looking for something to defend himself. “Do you know Jimmy Savile? He died a few years back. Raised money for charity.”
A slightly slower song struck up and Harry lit up. “Dance?” She asked, holding out her arm. John let go of Sherlock’s hand to join her. Sherlock was glad. Harry passed Rosie to Clara and led John away.
“Shortly before my fifteenth birthday, Harry brought a girl home. It was probably her way of showing us that she was better than us and braver than us. I would have told her not to, not that day. It was late in the evening. Dad had had a particularly bad day at work, and his drinking started earlier than usual. He was angry about Mum, he was angry about Harry. In retrospect, I should have told her not to say anything the second she walked in the door. But I didn’t. Harry introduced the girl as her girlfriend. Dad said some horrible things. I can still see him saying them. The anger on his face was the worst thing I’ve ever seen.” John closed his eyes. His face was pulled taut with pain. Sherlock listened, helpless against John’s emotion. “He told her she had to leave the house. He didn’t want her here anymore. Not while she was gay. Her girlfriend protested. Harry protested. I was standing in the corner of the room, not saying anything. I don’t know if she saw me or not. Dad held firm and kicked her out.” John’s voice trembled. “She didn’t send me a birthday card that year. While it may not seem like much, it felt like a lot. I knew she hated Dad, but it really felt like she hated me as well.
He still didn’t sit up. John sighed and walked over to him. He placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, and when Sherlock immediately sat up, he removed his hand.
“No.” John shook his head vehemently. “Don’t ever say that, Sherlock. I was lost without you when you were gone. I need you.”
Molly was the one to answer it. He furrowed his eyebrows, blinking at her. There were dark circles under her eyes. Rosie was in her arms. It was evident that she’d been crying. “Hi,” she said quietly. He pursed his lips and nodded, suddenly finding it very difficult to speak. He hadn’t prepared for this outcome.
“Me too,” John said, and his heart was a lot lighter knowing Sherlock wasn’t madly in love with Irene. The jealousy slowly trickled away, until it was replaced by a strange sort of euphoria.
“I know you’re not, dear. It’s a figure of speech. But I think it rather applies to this, don’t you?”
John stood up, immediately throwing on his coat. He asked Mrs. Hudson to look after Rosie: “It’s about Sherlock. He’s gone.” He ran out of the flat and called a cab, immediately getting in. “Battersea Park, please.”
John wasn’t up when Sherlock deemed it late enough to get out of bed. He debated playing more violin, but that would probably wake John up and that was the last thing he wanted. John was probably tired, and he would also want to talk. Neither of them were good at that. John was good at bottling up his feelings, and Sherlock was good at insulting people. None of that would be helpful.
“Christ, Sherlock.” John laughed coldly. Sherlock blinked at him and paused in untangling his string. “And I thought maybe you were normal.”
Sherlock shook his head to clear the thoughts, hating how Christmas made him astonishingly sentimental. Or perhaps that was just John’s daughter. Or both. Sherlock didn’t think he owned any wrapping paper, and if he did, he had no idea where it was. He settled for pulling old newspapers from a pile in his room. He carefully folded the blanket into a perfect rectangle before setting it on his bed. None of the newspapers were big enough to cover it completely, so he’d have to get creative. He placed four of them on the bed, making a square. He set the blanket in the middle of them. Perfect. If he was careful, he could tape it all up. Sherlock folded each corner in, taping them to the others as he did so. When he was certain that side was secure, he flipped it over and taped the other side.
comforting, safe. Sherlock stood frozen for a moment, then unfroze and gently placed his hands on John’s hips.
Sherlock rested his chin on the top of John’s head and pulled him into a sideways hug. “It’s going to be okay,” he said, not knowing if it really was. “I’m here now.”
“I need to finish the story, or else I’ll never say it. Please.” Sherlock nodded slowly. “He was supposed to be gone for the weekend, you know how it goes.” Sherlock listened intently. “He came home, drunk. Christopher and I were on the couch. Neither of us heard the car pull in, or the door open. Next thing I know he was yelling at us. He said horrible, awful things. I don’t want to repeat them. If I was clever enough to have a Mind Palace, I’d probably delete them.” He tried for a smile, and to his gratification, Sherlock gave him a weak smile in return. “I told Christopher to leave. He didn’t want to. My dad started hitting me. He was drunk, not in control. It hurt. Finally, Christopher left. I never talked to him again. I couldn’t. I convinced myself I was straight, that I would never look at another guy again. I started going out with as many girls as I could.” He took another deep breath. “When Harry came out to my parents, my mom supported her, but my dad, he disowned her. I did love my dad, in a way. I didn’t like him, but I loved him. He was my father, after all. When I was twenty-seven, a few years before Afghanistan, he was in an accident. Car accident.” John’s voice cracked.
Sherlock’s blood ran cold and his fingers shook over the keyboard. He could solve the case, he knew he could, but it halted him. He stared at the screen, seeing but not seeing. He saw John, limping through the dark London night with his cane. John had been suicidal. Sherlock knew that. There was a high likelihood that John would have taken his own life, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that John might do that now.
““Silent Night” isn’t actually my favourite Christmas song,” Sherlock said after a moment. John could feel his voice rumbling through his chest.
“John was here. Again. I know he was, he was just here. We need to find him.” Sherlock glanced rapidly from side to side as if John would materialise.
“Too late for that now,” Sherlock said, and regretted it the second it left his mouth. He was fairly certain Mycroft knew, but it was something he really didn’t want to talk about.
His coat did little to stop the rain. Sherlock was reminded of the night those months ago, the one where he went home alone in shock. This was different, it was, and he knew it. Now, he had someone to come home to. Mostly. At least for the night.
“John.” John met his eyes. In the dim light, Sherlock saw that they were watery again. “You’re not like your father. Understand? You’re nothing like him. You’re not even close.”
“Are you high?” The words fell out of his mouth before he could stop them, and he winced. It was probably insensitive to ask. John hoped that he wasn’t.
It had been seven days since Mary’s death. Three days since the funeral. Two days since the note. Sherlock wasn’t doing well. He was plagued by nightmares any time he fell asleep. He stopped eating almost completely. And he couldn’t stop thinking about John. He memorised the note John gave him. Memorised every swoop of John’s handwriting. Deduced exactly how hard he had been pressing down with the pen and what that meant. The note wasn’t John’s best handwriting, but it wasn’t rushed. He had taken his time, thought out what he wanted to say. Except for the sentence before ‘I’m sorry.’ That was rushed. He was pressing hard. Angry. None of this helped Sherlock feel any better.
Clara patted him on the arm. “I’m going to go get something to drink. Again, congratulations!” She walked off, taking Rosie with her. Sherlock wasn’t entirely certain why other people kept taking John’s child - his child now too, he supposed - but he trusted them so he let it be.
She motioned for him to come inside her flat. They sat at her small kitchen table and she got out a few biscuits, offering him one. “John Watson, you be good to Sherlock Holmes. You weren’t there after Mary died, you don’t know what it was like for him.”
Sherlock was leaning against the railing, looking at the Thames.  The wind ruffled his dark hair, and John felt a tug at the pit of his stomach. He wished he could run his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. It had been so soft last night. Sherlock’s coat hung around him as usual.
The next time he shot up wasn’t nearly as pleasant. Not that the first few times had been pleasant, but the euphoric high only lasted for a few minutes before paranoia started to sink in. He couldn’t shake the feeling that what he was doing was wrong. John wouldn’t get out of his head, either. Thoughts of
“Yes. I know.” Sherlock rested the small package in his lap. It was meticulously wrapped, dark-blue paper with a silver ribbon tied around it. “But I did.”
“Whatever you say, little brother. Sooner or later, you will have to face him. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m needed elsewhere.” Mycroft stood up. “Stay as long as you wish. But please, do mend things with him. I quite like Doctor Watson.”
The face Sherlock made must have looked more offended than he felt (though he was still offended, of course) because John burst into laughter. He doubled over. Sherlock had to catch his styrofoam container before it fell. “Stop laughing,” he scolded, but John just laughed harder.
“I just want to see her.” Sherlock couldn’t keep the euphoric smile off his face as they climbed into the car. He pretended not to notice Olivia glancing suspiciously at him. “This is all a game to you, isn’t it?” she said after a moment of silence.
“I don’t have to,” Sherlock said, but knew that wasn’t true. Even if Smith didn’t kill him now, his body was deteriorating. The drugs were killing him slowly, and the most terrifying part of it all was that he simply didn’t care. He didn’t see a point in caring, in living.
The five stores they tried were, in fact, sold out of trees, but in the sixth one Sherlock was able to find a small tabletop ash tree. John acquiesced, looking at it and shaking his head. “It’s better than nothing. But it’s still the most ridiculous Christmas tree I’ve ever seen.”
He had nodded eagerly, and then curiously reached out and touched one of the lobsters before it was banded. It resulted in him getting pinched. He was returned to Mummy and Daddy in tears with an apologetic sternman in tow.
Sherlock shook his head and then nodded. A tear slipped down his cheek. His whole body was quivering.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine.” He picked up his violin and started to play. John watched him, walking to the bathroom.
Through the gloom, he could make out the vague figures of people. The pastor was speaking. “...devout are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.” A verse. He wasn’t surprised. John and Mary had gotten married in a church they had had Rosie baptised. It was fitting that she would have a funeral service in a church as well. Sherlock figured that the service had been going on for less than five minutes. The pastor didn’t look as though he’d been speaking for all that long, and the church was silent. No sounds of crying, of even any emotion, which led him to believe no one else had spoken. A chill went down his spine. It was hard to tell whether it was from the cold or from something else, but the room was rather chilly. He scanned the pews for John.
That was the wrong thing to say, but Sherlock had no power to argue. His body was shaking. His mind wouldn’t focus. His vision blurred in and out. “I don’t care what John thinks,” Sherlock managed.
“Would you like an explanation?” Sherlock nodded, breathless, as John steeled himself to speak. “Birthdays are supposed to be something good, right? I don’t know if it was like that when you were growing up-”
Sherlock finished cooking the eggs, sprinkling in some pre-grated cheese to add flavour. John poured them each a glass of orange juice, which he’d apparently also brought. Or maybe he bought it when he bought biscuits yesterday.
Sherlock continued walking, avoiding curious gazes from the few people he saw. He was none of their business.
She opened her mouth indignantly. “Sherlock Holmes. John is your friend. His wife died. You can’t just sit there!”
John was late for the next intervention. Lestrade paced around the flat, checking his watch every minute or so. Sherlock ignored him, preferring to go to the comfort of his mind palace to wait. It was an overnight shift, dinner through breakfast. Sherlock was certain he wouldn’t be able to eat a single thing.
“Yes, the music is set up,” John said, trying and failing to hide a smile. Sherlock found that he didn’t much want to figure out why. John was up to something, and Sherlock was content to let him have his surprise, much to his alarm. He put it down to sentiment, because it would most likely make John happy.
His best-case scenario was that John would accept it. The most likely scenario was that John would tolerate it for a few seconds before pushing Sherlock’s hand away. John didn’t do any of that, though. His grip was firm against Sherlock, even when his fingertips were shaking. In return, Sherlock grasped his hand a little more tightly. John didn’t look at Sherlock.
Rosie babbled quietly to John as they set off along the path. John appeared lost in thought, so Sherlock said nothing. The sun was low in the sky-it was December, after all-and shadows spread out underneath the trees. They made their way to the fountain. The water splashed merrily into the basin. Sherlock remembered coming here high, years ago. The water then had seemed like a miraculous force, threatening to reach out and grab him. He was safer now.
“It was no problem. Rosie was lovely, really.” Mrs. Hudson went back over to Rosie and picked her up. “I think she missed you, though.” Another smile.
The light on the table was still on. Sherlock was curled up, asleep, in his chair. His breathing was calm and steady. His face was relaxed. John melted at the sight of him. Sherlock never looked like this. He was never this comfortable. Part of John wanted to sit in his own chair and watch him, though that was creepy. Sherlock could wake at any moment.
He snuck looks at Sherlock, wide-eyed, sitting there. He was staring at the screen, not even blinking. John saw his thin back rise and fall, rise and fall. The house was burning, burning, burning.
“Yes, I do. You’re sad about leaving.” John said nothing. Sherlock was correct in his deduction, then. John’s face was pressed into his coat. “You’re getting tears on my coat.”
John waited for Sherlock on the stoop while he paid the cabbie. He was staring down at the pavement, cautiously avoiding Sherlock’s gaze. Sherlock unlocked the door and ushered John in. John’s hand on the railing was firm, his footsteps even, but Sherlock knew he was breaking inside. He was probably terrified of what Sherlock thought.
“I did, didn’t I?” Neither of them said anything for a long while. “I’m assuming you know by now. About the Detective Inspector and I. We’ve been friends for quite a while now, and I find myself enjoying his company.” Sherlock couldn’t miss the hint of fondness in Mycroft’s voice, and thought maybe something else was happening.
An insane laugh bubbled up from his throat. And then another. This was ridiculous. So ridiculous he had to laugh in order not to fall apart. He slipped out of bed and made his way to the kitchen. He didn’t have the strength to make tea, not really, and so he flopped down on the couch. His limbs were tired. His mind was not in the best shape. Not for the first time since Mary’s death, he craved cocaine. This was the strongest craving so far. He wanted it. He needed it. The brief relief, the manic energy, everything. The way he didn’t have to be himself even if just for a little while. He felt better, more alert, more euphoric when he was on cocaine than he did at any other time, save for when he was solving cases with John.
“Of course it is,” John said. “But it’s better to not let your emotions build up like that. Ella taught that to me.” And then musingly he added, “I should probably book another appointment with her. She’s quite a good therapist.”
He walked with his head held high, trying to figure out where he could go next. Mycroft would find him anywhere. Sherlock was exhausted, which wasn’t something he was used to feeling. He wanted his brother. He wanted someone else to just be there.
Ella sat across from him, surveying him. Her hands were folded over a notebook in her lap. Neither of them spoke.
“No,” Sherlock said, but his body betrayed him by twitching violently. Lestrade cleared his throat and sat down on a chair beside him. Mycroft remained standing.
The water hissed as it came out of the taps. Sherlock winced and withdrew his hand as soon as he touched it, then proceeded to turn the temperature down too much. He laughed almost incredulously at himself.
but Mycroft had stopped by and brought the takeaway. Antagonising him provided just the right amount of distraction.
“When have I lied to you?” The words came out in a feeble attempt to get John to realise Sherlock still cared. Still trusted him.
“John, I have another question,” Sherlock announced when they broke apart. “You said it was always me. When did you know?”
“Yes. When I was high,” he winced at the word, ashamed that he’d been in that state, “you hated me. You said awful things. Like-like it was disgusting for me to feel this way about you, and you called me a
Rosie plucked at the paper on Sherlock’s gift. John gently guided her fingers to the tape, saying nothing about the newspaper. She scrunched up the paper, ripping it slightly so that the yellow of the blanket showed through. John helped her unwrap it all the way. Sherlock watched anxiously. He was worried that it wasn’t good enough. Maybe Rosie already had enough blankets? It didn’t help that Sherlock couldn’t parse the expression on John’s face, either. He kept it stubbornly blank as the blanket was revealed.
Sherlock couldn’t speak, too overwhelmed. Luckily, John seemed content to sit there, just holding him.
“I can make something,” Sherlock offered. “I’m sure I have some canned soup or something around here. Is tomato okay?”
“He’s high, John.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at that. It was irrelevant, it didn’t matter. John didn’t care.
He didn’t hear Sherlock moving around as he put the kettle on. Rosie babbled to herself from the other room, but other than that it was silent. He hadn’t bothered to make a fire before he had left, and it appeared that Sherlock hadn’t either.
John hated the drugs. Sherlock had tried to keep them a secret, but bloody Lestrade had to go and ruin everything. He was lucky John hadn’t left him after that. Incredibly lucky.
The man nodded and rushed off, returning moments later with the cigarettes. Sherlock hastily took them from him, fingers fumbling to get his card to pay. As soon as the transaction was finished, he ripped open the package with icy fingers. He struck the lighter.
In the cab, he had tried to work up the courage to take John’s hand, but he didn’t want to scare him off. John was unusually quiet, and an uncomfortable feeling started to bloom in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach. John thought it was a mistake, but how could it have been? It was exactly what Sherlock had wanted for years, and to him it had been perfect. Apparently not to John, who was staring out the window, gripping his knees hard enough that his knuckles turned white. So Sherlock sat and watched London go by through the window and thought. Mostly about John. The kiss had been exactly eleven seconds long - not too short, but not very long either. John looked surprised when he had pulled away, so it must have been something he hadn’t thought over beforehand. The only question was what John would do next.
“Anything,” Sherlock said, hoping that it wasn’t something else he didn’t particularly want to answer.
to talk about what John did. Clearly, John was too uncomfortable to do that. So Sherlock let it rest.
He knew that it probably wasn’t a good idea to count, but he couldn’t do anything else. The hollowness hadn’t gone away overnight, not even a little. He was holding yet another cold cup of tea. It was full. He hadn’t even tried to sip at it. John’s chair was still taunting him, the flat cold and empty. There were traces of John and Mary everywhere. It was driving him crazy. Sherlock thought and he thought and he thought about what to do. Finally, he picked up his phone and made a call.
His usual nightmares came back. He had to kill John, once again. But then it got worse, and John blamed him for it, and left again. Then the murderer decided to kill him because he was gay, and Mycroft was telling him it wasn’t okay, and John was telling him it wasn’t okay, and he was being burned, burned, his whole body on fire, agony, pain-
“Then I swear to god, Sherlock, I will chase you down and force you to watch James Bond all evening.”
“You know that’s not going to stop me from talking to you?” John said. Sherlock cracked an eye open enough to let John know he was very displeased. “I just wanted to say that...well, if I can do anything besides not blogging, let me know.”
“You know what?” John said. “I’m glad Jeanette broke up with me.” Sherlock arched an eyebrow. “Even if you don’t really care about her, it’s good to be with people when you’re grieving.”
Maybe it wasn’t such a terrible song after all. He held John a little closer, a little more intimately. The song resonated around the small room. John relaxed. Sherlock didn’t let go.
Sherlock noticed people standing up on the platform with violins. Two of them, to be exact. He scowled at them. “John. Why are those people holding violins?”
“Yes,” she said. He breathed in deeply through his nose and pressed his eyes together. Tears threatened to fall. Molly gently touched his arm. “There’s something else.”
He needed a cigarette. He needed to feel the smoke filling his lungs, see the small spark of light at the end of it. He needed to do something. The nearest Tesco was a few blocks away. It wasn’t really on his way back to Baker Street, but it would have to do.
His dreams that night were haunting, strange. Blue light, rain washing away blood. A feeling of being pulled under, getting high again, no one there to save him. And the sound. The awful, terrible sound John had made.
“It’s been ages,” she gushed. Sherlock pushed himself slowly out of his chair. He walked over to John. His ribs were mostly healed, his bruises gone. The stitches had fallen out a few weeks ago. But there would be a scar, and sometimes it still hurt to breathe.
“Oh, well, that’s good-” John stopped talking as soon as his eyes landed on the small package under the tree. “Did you get her something?”
And then John had come back, for a bit. Mary shot him and Sherlock told John to forgive her. A part of Sherlock had secretly hoped that John would break up with her and fall for Sherlock instead, but that never happened. Instead, Mary had died. Because of him. John had thought it was Sherlock’s fault.
The door to the hallway opened, light shining into Sherlock’s eyes. He blinked. The dark outline of a figure stood in the doorway. Sherlock raised himself into a seated position.
“Then by the power invested in me, I now declare you husband and husband,” Mycroft announced, and it would be difficult to tell whose smile was bigger. “You may now kiss the groom.”
John stepped through the door, hesitantly, one of his hands raised in greeting. The other was clenched at his side. Sherlock knocked into the drawer, stumbling forward, and pressed a hand onto the desk to support himself. He then stepped carefully over the pile of papers on the ground, moving carefully towards John.
“I promise,” John whispered, still stroking her hair. “Yes, I promise. Promise. I promise.” He continued to soothe her, holding her.
Sherlock made a noise of agreement and sat down at the small table. He pushed the piles of chemistry equipment and papers over to the corner, making room for Rosie. Rosie was tucked up in John’s arms as he fried some eggs.
“I’ve already killed six people. One more won’t make a difference.” A shot rang out, and Sherlock ducked. It hit the wall behind him.
Minutes after he sent the text, a black car pulled up to the curb. He climbed inside and folded his arms. He couldn’t see John anywhere. When he arrived at Mycroft’s, he was informed by the driver that Mycroft wasn’t there. However, there was a note stuck to the front door.
He bowed his head, rain running down his neck. His hair was soaked in a matter of seconds. His coat would probably be ruined after this, he reflected, but at that point he couldn’t care less. He could always get another. A coat was such a trivial thing compared to the events that had just happened. A coat was replaceable. Mary’s life was irreplaceable. He fought to keep down another sob, speeding up his pace slightly. London was nearly deserted at this hour, lights from nearby buildings glowing in the darkness. Cars drove by, spraying water. What was once a drizzle was quickly turning into more of a downpour. Sherlock usually liked the rain. He found solace in it. Not this time. Freezing droplets slid inside his coat. It felt like a punishment. And it was, in a way. It was his fault Mary was dead, all his fault. He tilted his head back, once again. Rain fell down and pelted his face, his cheeks, his nose, his eyes. He shivered, drawing his coat tighter around him. It would do nothing to keep him warm once it got wet, of course. In fact, it would probably make him even colder. But for now it was enough.
“Yeah, but you thought you could do it alone. You dragged Mary and I all around London, solving your bloody cases, without a single thought to our safety.”
He had deduced the exact time and location of the funeral based on Mrs. Hudson’s departure, and it had started ten minutes ago. Sherlock had never been to a funeral before. He didn’t know what to expect. He quietly pushed the door of the church open. The lobby was brightly lit, and he quickly slipped inside. The doors to the sanctuary were open. The light inside was dimmer. Sherlock discreetly stepped inside and pressed his back against the wall, crossing his hands behind him.
Sherlock sucked in a breath, horrified. It couldn’t be. It wouldn’t be. John wouldn’t-John wouldn’t do that.
A deep flush radiated through his body and he tried not to let it show on his face. “Mrs. Hudson. I am not gay.”
He felt his eyelids getting heavier as his sobs slowed. John occasionally rubbed his back in soothing up-and-down motions. Sherlock shifted against him when John reached up and ran a hand through his hair.
“The pool. When Moriarty was going to blow you up. I looked at you and I thought that was it. I was about to lose the best thing that ever happened to me. And then, belatedly, I realised that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, which was mildly alarming.”
“Oh.” A flicker of hope stirred in Sherlock’s chest. He ignored it. It didn’t matter how John felt. He would never see him again after this.
Warmth curled in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach. It wasn’t a date. He refused to let himself think it was a date. It was a celebration of John’s birthday.
“You’re in my chair,” Sherlock said quietly. His voice was raspier than he’d expected, but a pulmonary contusion was bound to cause some issues.
“Sleep well?” Sherlock made a noise of assent and burrowed into John even more. John chuckled. A sleepy Sherlock Holmes wasn’t what he expected to wake up to on Christmas morning, but he couldn’t have asked for anything better. “Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
left?” Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “I saved your life. Moriarty was going to kill you. I had to do that. I regret it constantly, but at least I had a reason. You had no reason to do what you did to me. None.” That was unfair. Sherlock knew it and John knew it. Yet John refused to take the bait.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “It’s old. No need to keep it around.” He faced the mantle before John could see the tears in his eyes. He pulled everything off at random. Various envelopes, the skull. A slide for his microscope. Most of it ended up in the trash.
He didn’t realise how much it hurt on the receiving side. John was happy, afterwards. Happy with Mary. Happy with Rosie. He was able to forgive her for lying, forgive her for shooting Sherlock. And Sherlock did too. He had to. He had to forgive her, for John.
Happy New Year everybody. This chapter was up late and I doubt the next one will be up as late. Hopefully. According to Wikipedia, Culverton Smith (BBC not ACD) was inspired by Jimmy Savile, a TV host who was an alleged child sex abuser. I hope I did the BBC character justice. He's probably my least favourite Sherlock villain.
At that Sherlock’s head popped up. John widened his eyes in alarm at his change in demeanor. His eyes lit up and John thought he looked similar as to when he got a case with several murders. “It’s Christmas,” he informed John.
“John, I did it, I solved it…” he trailed off when he remembered John was no longer there. His heart throbbed and he bit his lip. After a moment of composure, he spun back to tell Wiggins and find the officers.
“What do you need advice for? It seems like you’re handling this just fine. Besides, not only is it obvious that he’s in love with you, it’s pretty damn obvious that you feel the same way.” She winked.
Shortly after he heard Rosie’s wake up cries and John’s footsteps, heavy with sleep. He turned on the rest of the lights. It was still early and they glowed in the shadows.
“You know what list,” Mycroft said, neatly containing his anger behind his cold demeanor. Sherlock waved a hand dismissively towards the table in the kitchen. He winced again.
“Never, dear.” Mrs. Hudson gave Sherlock a pat on the shoulder and then left the flat, “to go confirm Christmas plans with her sister.” Christmas was soon, only in about three weeks. Sherlock didn’t have plans. He wasn’t going to have plans. He’d spend it with whoever was assigned to him. No presents, no nothing.
“I’m not sure how to help you. And besides, you’re not fine. You’re obviously not fine, or you wouldn’t be here.” That was logical, and he knew it, and he knew that she knew she was right. He also knew that he didn’t care one bit.
I don't think there are any warnings for this chapter except one incredibly brief mention of suicide. This is, for the most part, fluff. Apologies for any spelling/grammar errors!
“I know.” John didn’t respond. He just kept watching him. “I’m sorry.” Sherlock meant it. He meant it with everything he had. It was a mistake. A terrible mistake. John deserved better.
Sherlock was torn out of the (rather unpleasant and not relaxing, now that he thought about it) memory by John throwing open his door. “Sherlock!”
Sherlock turned away, evidently done with the conversation. “Don’t get me dinner, John, I won’t be back at the flat for a while.”
The cab pulled up in front of a small, grey building. A rainbow was painted on the glass door. Sherlock paid the cabbie and gestured for Olivia to follow him. Bells tinkled inside when he opened the door. “What is this place?”
Abandoning that plan, Sherlock reached under his bed. He hadn’t bought a gift for John. He wasn’t certain if that would be overstepping, and in any sense, he certainly didn’t know what John wanted. But he had picked up something for Rosie while John was looking for ornaments. He’d slipped it in the cart when John wasn’t looking. He pulled it out now and looked at it.
“Sherlock?” John said. “What did it say?” Sherlock thrust the piece of paper at John. John scanned it, looking fairly confused. “It doesn’t look bad.”
He focused on that, trying not to think about John. It was pointless. Euphoric joy threatened to overwhelm him, but the crushing feeling of John’s hatred kept it at bay. Mrs. Hudson truly was a terrible driver. He felt the car crash into bins, drive over the kerb, before it came to an abrupt halt. He thought he heard sirens, but blocked it out. All was silent.
“My little brother met Doctor Watson many years ago,” Mycroft said. “Those of us who were cleverer in the ways of people could see that they made each other better. While it took my little brother years to figure it out, it took Doctor Watson even longer. And I’m sure you can all agree that it was quite aggravating to watch.” Everyone laughed, and Sherlock scowled at Mycroft. “Anyways. They found each other, somehow, quite romantic.” John narrowed his eyes. Sherlock could see him wondering if Mycroft was the best person to officiate. “Sherlock has always claimed that he was above all emotion, but evidently that is not true. I am happy for them, truly. Little brother, you deserve this.” John’s face relaxed and Sherlock did too. It was the nicest thing Mycroft had said to him, which wasn’t a great sign, but he would be lying if he wasn’t slightly touched. “Now for the vows. Doctor Watson, you first.”
He emptied the syringe and then placed it in the bowl on the table. He crossed the room and sat on his chair, stretching his legs out. He imagined he could feel the drug flowing through his veins, travelling up to his brain. Ridiculous, of course, because he couldn’t actually feel it and besides, it would take at least a few minutes to start feeling the effects.
“Merry Christmas.” There was a click on the other end of the line. Sherlock frowned down at his phone.
“I love you too.” And then he said it again, just because he could. “I love you.” He couldn’t believe he was able to do this now.
John had been expecting this. Given his reaction to asking him to be best man, asking him to get married would certainly be more difficult for Sherlock to process. He waited.
“Did you touch his chair? He was here, sitting in it, just a minute ago,” Sherlock demanded. He glared at Lestrade.
“His dealer,” Molly said angrily. “I’ve met him before.” Sherlock didn’t defend himself. He didn’t even bother to lie about being back on the drugs.
He knew that voice. Mrs. Hudson. Mycroft he didn’t care about, but he didn’t want to disappoint Mrs. Hudson, so he opened his eyes again. Everything was very bright, even though a glance out the window showed it was dark. He squinted. Behind Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson were Lestrade and Molly.
“I couldn’t help overhearing your conversation with that woman-Molly, was it?-as you two were rather loud. I wanted to say that it’s not bad. How you feel.” Wiggins averted his eyes. Sherlock felt a blush rise to his cheeks. “Also I told you I knew that something was going on between you two.”
Sherlock scanned the email. Below the signature was a phone number. He despised calling clients, but it didn’t seem too bad now. He dialed, waiting with baited breath. “Hello?” A woman’s voice crackled through the other end.
Annoyance flared through him. “About John.” He kept his voice even and steady, tried not to feel anything when he said John’s name.
“John would have monitored me himself,” he growled, and continued up the stairs, albeit at a slightly slower pace. His heart pounded quickly in his chest, and he couldn’t tell whether it was from excitement or the cocaine in his veins. He sat back down at his laptop to read the rest of the cases.
Back in the cab, it was silent. John was used to silence, with Sherlock, but this felt different. More awkward. Sherlock’s confession hung over them and John was sure Sherlock was aware of it. Sherlock was perfectly still, gazing out the window. He appeared relaxed, his hands loosely clasped in his lap. His hair wasn’t even messy from bed, and John wondered how exactly his hair could be so perfect all the time. He ached to run his fingers through it. Again. Pull yourself together, John Watson.
Sherlock held up his hand. “I understand that, John. I truly do. But you can’t hide from things. It’s how we got here in the first place.”
“We’ll take the food to go,” Sherlock said, making a snap decision. It turned out to be the right one. John smiled at him gratefully and mouthed thank you. Sherlock nodded. “Baker Street? Or would you like to go home to Rosie?”
“Yes, didn’t I just say that?” Sherlock’s frown deepened. Lestrade opened his mouth to argue, but John stopped him.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, evidently reading something in him, though John had no idea what it was. “I’m going out.”
Sherlock had to stay sober. He couldn’t give in, not yet, not until he knew John was okay. He watched his hand shake as he made himself stay on the couch. He refused himself even a cigarette. The sun rose, slowly. He hadn’t turned on any lights, so consequently the flat lightened considerably. The sight would have been peaceful, nice even, if not for the hole in his chest. Hollowness that could only be filled by John. Light glanced off a cup on the table. He watched dust swirl through the air as he waited for it to be late enough. Time slowed down as he laid across the couch. He was getting impatient, and worried. He would go to John’s flat, make sure John was okay. Apologise. See if there was anything he could do.
Sherlock placed his dishes in the sink, John following shortly afterwards. Rosie was settled firmly on the couch, John next to her. “Can you get me her gift? It’s on my bed.”
Sherlock opened his eyes some time later-minutes? Hours?-to find John staring at him and smiling. He stopped playing and set the violin down. “Yes?”
John rolled his eyes. Harry was always very difficult for him to get along with, simply because they were so different. Harry was always more outgoing, the flamboyant one. She wasn’t scared to fit in, wasn’t scared to be seen as an outsider. He tried to be like other people, to live up to society’s expectations. “I did not sleep with him.”
He wished his solution was prepared. It would be so easy to slip away, make it an ‘accidental’ overdose. He wouldn’t have to deal with that anymore, wouldn’t have to feel the pain.
Mrs. Hudson set up the game board. The game was fun. Sherlock even teased Mrs. Hudson for picking Miss Scarlet, asking her if she was reverting to her days of exotic dancing. They didn’t once mention John, and though Cluedo was ridiculous, it was a nice distraction. Something else to focus his mind on.
It was then. “It was after Moriarty had us in the pool. I realised what I would have lost by losing you.”
“I solved a case whilst you were gone,” Sherlock said as soon as he could speak, finding that to be a safe topic and hoping that John wouldn’t deem it as rude.
He spent the rest of the day solving cases right in his sitting room. The most interesting one only took him an hour to solve. Altogether it was mindless work, but he was happy to be back solving cases. He was so immersed in his work that he didn’t notice the time slipping by until it was dark out. He didn’t eat, didn’t move from the chair. He didn’t notice when he started to come down until one of the cases sent him completely over the edge. He was usually vulnerable after the cocaine wore away, but this time seemed worse than usual. The case itself was simple, aside from the astonishingly poor writing style. It was an easy case to solve, one that should only have taken him five minutes, but he couldn’t do it. Words jumped out at him from the email.
Sherlock dropped the bag of clothes and in a huff, moved towards the kitchen. “Did you save any for me?”
John went through everything that had happened between them, and how he had felt with it. He had the slight suspicion that it wouldn’t be so bloody difficult if Sherlock hadn’t lied to him about his death. A small voice in the back of his head pointed out that Sherlock had only been doing it to protect him. John didn’t really care what Sherlock’s reasoning was. It had been the most painful experience of his life, even more painful than the time that he had gotten shot.
“Wait here. I’ll be right back.” Sherlock strode up to the front desk. A nervous-looking young woman stared at him. His shoes made tapping sounds on the tile. “Hello,” he said, smiling as widely as possible. “My name is Sherlock Holmes.”
“Of course I’m not mad.” John kissed the top of Sherlock’s head, before stiffening in alarm. “Sorry.”
Lestrade had, of course, seen them kiss already, but he immediately shut up about it and consequently never brought it up again afterwards; John suspected that Sherlock had said something. Rather rudely. Nobody else said anything either, whether negative or positive, which helped to put John at ease.
Sherlock deepened his frown, but didn’t say anything. John’s thumb traced a path down his palm and his lips quirked upwards. Mycroft stepped up to the microphone. Sherlock rolled his eyes. Habit.
Sherlock scowled at him. “What is your obsession with my relationships?” He took a breath. “No, actually, never mind. Like a friend. Not a girlfriend. Well,” he amended, “
Well, that's that. I hope you enjoyed this as much as I (mostly) enjoyed writing it! It feels crazy that it's over - I've been working on it since last November, and it's July now. Anyways, thank you to everyone who's read, commented, or left kudos, it means so much. Really. Thank you.
