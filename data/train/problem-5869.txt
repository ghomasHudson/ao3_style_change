But then he cries out, “That asshole!” when the editor ignores them all and chooses death instead. He slumps back in defeat and sighs – “What a waste.” – then turns back to Romulus. “It is a rather poor decision to condemn a fighter so popular with the crowd. Even Hadrianus would not dare be so conceited to think such a move would play well at the ballot box.”
“I know that, but… wait. What was that about the flogging?” The bartender had said there was flogging, and that Steve was good at it. And what was that about being part of a ‘scene’? Tony has ideas, and none of them jived with his preconceptions of what Steve might be into sexually (which honestly included missionary position and little else, maybe doggy-style if he was feeling particularly frisky).
…It needs a better punch line.
But they don’t know they’ve already doomed it.
“You lucky bastard, why didn’t you tell me?” Bucky shakes his best friend and team captain by the shoulders before sliding in beside him on the bench, looking for all the world like the cat that ate the canary.
“Pipsqueak.”
“Tony–”
“Did you remember to bring the goat?” Tony asks Steve for what has to be the third time on their drive from the City to rural Pennsylvania. He cranes his neck, peering through the dusty back window into the pickup bed to ensure the goat is still harnessed and tethered in the back of their rented truck.
Cinaedus: Derogatory word for a man who is non-gender conforming, possibly androgynous or effeminate, and is the most frequent word for a man who allows himself to be anally penetrated. Cinaedus are also said to be highly attractive to women but devoid of true Roman manhood.
Antony’s voice is quietly furious as he inquires, “Has this always been your plan?”
“If you want to cop that attitude, you can forget about sex later,” Tony says with mock sternness. “You’ll be sleeping in the pool house.”
“Then why–”
But Stefanus simply shakes his head. Bacchus may understand Roman masters, but he hasn’t met a man like his Antony. “Antony is kind and very generous. I won’t have to make that choice.”
“Why don’t we try a different piece of music, hm?” He suggests instead of excoriating Tony’s shortcomings, pulling out a different (simpler) melody and placing it atop his original selection.
“Arrest them,” The stormtrooper behind Steve commands, having wearied of his antics.
“Hello!” Steve calls out. “We are alive! We are here to help!”
“You’re much prettier when you don’t talk.”
“Antony,” Stefanus agrees.
His mother had died for Captain America, had died for Steve Rogers, and now Tony is here, allowing the very same man to kill him, too, to impale and slowly suffocate him upon the altar of an American icon.
“Hey!” Tony nudges Steve’s knee with his own.
Tony pulls on his clothes before he turns around. “It’s none of your business.”
He’d shut his eyes and grit his teeth against the abuse, silently suffering, too ashamed to tell anyone, perhaps afraid no one will believe him or worse, they’ll think he made it up in his hormone-addled mind, accusing him of having a crush on the teacher and trying to smear an innocent man whose only crime was to rightfully spurn him. Is that why Tony is so flirty with such a large segment of the student body, almost desperate for the touch of someone else? Anyone else? How long had this been going on with Dr. Pym pushing him to deeper and deeper levels of depravity before it escalated to unspeakable acts that resulted in the loss of his unicorn?
“Finley probably isn’t even available.”
Steve is silent at that. He approaches, sitting at the foot of the bed Tony had claimed as his own and patting Tony on the calf. “I had a lot of fun, Tony. I always enjoy spending time with you.”
“We have many that are available. Do you have one in mind?”
“Tony–”
“Men such as Steve and I should learn the finer points of combat and seek to improve our swordplay. What good are letters in the heat of battle. They do not cut nor wound–”
“He hurt you, didn’t he?”
Collegia: A gladiator union that would ensure fallen comrades received a proper funeral and grave inscription honoring his achievements in the games. They may also ensure that the gladiator’s family receive money in compensation for the death.
Stefanus’s knees give out. He falls to the ground, dropping his sword to embrace a still-living Bacchus.
Sextarius: Approximately half liter
“I’m sure. Twenty credits also mean a lot for the locals.”
Steve gulps, a lump dipping in his throat. “I don’t think less of you for… for liking men.”
“Oh come now, it’s not that dire,” Tony half-lies as he comes out of the bathroom to observe his assistant. Steve isn’t too bad-looking, if one were into that sort of frail constitution, and what he lacked in physical allure, he more than made up for in spirit. Hell, if Steve had been a woman, or into men himself…
Rhodey picks his words carefully. “Right… well, I don’t know what to tell you, Tones. Are you sure he actually likes you like that? I’m sure he cares a lot about you as a friend, but maybe… maybe your judgment just might be a little impaired, and–”
Growing up, Antony had always been envious of the other children, the ones with mothers who doted on them, taught and cared for them. In contrast, Antony had been tended to by a rotation of slaves and servants under the direction of his father. Hadrianus himself rarely spent time with his son, only deigning to grace him with his presence during the evening and morning meal when he wasn’t busy entertaining business contacts and political connections. Antony had coveted his father’s attention and couldn’t quite comprehend the reason for his near estrangement. But by the time he was seven, he thought he had it figured out. Hadrianus must blame him for his mother’s death during childbirth. The resentment, the guilt, had eaten at him, making him alternately defiant at times and desperate for approval at others.
It seems they are at an impasse.
They’ll never recover, not after this.
Tony quickly learns there is a reason for Steve to abstain from wine and spirits. Firstly, his alcohol tolerance is questionable at best, and he’s teetering by his second drink, which is unsurprising considering his size. And secondly, whereas Tony is a rather jovial fellow when inebriated, Steve, as it turns out, is a belligerent drunk, more so if one were to insinuate he came by his unfortunate disposition honestly.
“Come on. Just look at that thing and tell me it isn’t a…” his eyes flit to Ms. Potts across the table as he drops his voice once again, “a
(Even if he is a good kisser.)
But he’s not looking at Steve now, tapping his chin in consideration. “Or maybe Stark made the first move. This
“Sure it was.”
He wonders (and not for the first time) if this is how his mother felt.
“Staius, you’re here! Come sit beside me while Valerius regales us with tales of the brothels in Antioch!”
“You don’t have to undersell it. It is a very thoughtful gift. I don’t know how I could ever repay you.”
Stark stands then stretches to loosen his muscles. “You sleep first. I’ll stand watch.”
Steve blushes and wisely decides to attack the issue from a different angle, “I don’t know… Grave-robbing to steal a man’s unmentionables–”
“Another botched sale, and I will sell you to the mines,” he mutters darkly, his sandal digging into Suibne’s back. He tugs harder on the leash, arching Suibne’s spine until he cries out. “You know what a man has to do to get sent to the mines, boy? That lot has nothing to lose. Pretty little thing like you won’t last among hardened criminals, but you will wish it was ever quicker.”
“I must admit I do not understand it myself. It makes me… uneasy.” The work is not difficult per se, but Stefanus can’t be complacent – he can’t afford to – and if he doesn’t understand what Antony wants, then how can he hope to be satisfactory in his role and remain in his favor?
Tony rolls his eyes. “This isn’t about what you deserve. I would like you to come with me to the dance, but only if you want to and don’t already have a date,” he says before scuffing the concrete with his boot and muttering, “It doesn’t have to be a real date, if you don’t want. It could be a friends-only thing, no expectations, no will-they-won’t-they, or–”
Antony joins the fray. “Let him go!” he shouts, pumping his fists into the air. “Let him go!”
He is about to say as much when Director Fury’s door swings open. “Ladies, if you both would stop arguing over whose hair is prettier and step into my office…”
Steve hears Stark remove his helmet and place it carefully atop his other armor with a tell-tale clink followed by rustling that must be the rest of his clothes because by the time his hands are on Steve, spreading open his shirt to slip over his chest, and Steve touches him back, all he feels is bare skin. Then there are lips closing on his own, parting them sweetly to allow a foreign tongue to slide over his inexpert one, trying to coax him into an age-old dance. Steve feels clumsy, lumbering by comparison, but Stark doesn’t seem to care, deepening the kiss further as he gently rubs then tweaks an exposed nipple, making Steve gasp. Steve tries to copy the motion on Stark, but Stark pulls away as if burned, his hands on Steve’s wrists, preventing any further exploration.
“I don’t know whether to shudder in horror or high-five you,” he finishes.
It still bums him out.
“It wasn’t real,” Steve points out, and now Tony’s jaw tightens, his hands clenched into fists ready to brawl, “on her side. I know you loved her, and it was real for you.”
“Alright, but only so I won’t burden you with my funerary expenses.”
“Do you think me blind?” Tiberius says indignantly. “I can see plain as day that you still wear the praetexta.”
“It’s a date… Steve.”
“That really isn’t necessary, J. Howard is just wasting his time,” Tony had told him as he places his small carry-on into the trunk on top of the other luggage Jarvis had already stowed away.
Then there was the Crimson Dynamo. Galina had told Tony that she had wanted four things from him: his technology, school business, respect, and hand in marriage. Perhaps if she had persisted…
“It’s about Tony,” he clarifies instead. He sighs. His planned speech isn’t going to work so he might as well get to the point. “As you know, we’ve been together for a couple years now. I love him, and he loves me, so I would like to ask for his hand in marriage.”
“…Yeah.”
If he wants to be a child about it, then fine. Purple Man gives him a small wave. “See you around, Tony.”
“Let me get this straight, just so I have a clear understanding of the situation at hand,” Bacchus says later when Stefanus tells him about Antony over a meal of barley and eggs with goat’s milk. “You have a… let’s call him a patron, who likes you enough to purchase exclusive rights to your services. He buys you nice things and does
“Cancel it.”
Unfortunately, the steamship authority disagrees.
“You will have to stay longer with no excuse for an early exit,” Stefanus points out, even as he hooks his arms under Antony’s thighs to lift him up, walking him back to the bed as Antony holds on and plants kisses along Stefanus’s temple.
“That’s new,” he says, his voice flat. “Why don’t you hit me again, Howard?”
He lifts a brow, his expression perplexed. “Since when have I not?”
It’s a long road to recovery, and Tony is just at the trail head really. As a result, he’s uncomfortable with what he feels is unearned praise. “So, enough about me; how’re you and Carol?”
“Stark?”
Tony doesn’t miss a beat. “Perhaps Cap and Thor–”
“Because I do want it.”
“I will be sure to mention it to Hadrianus, but you know how he can be.”
Shit, he didn’t even know the guy’s name.
“Jerk,” Bacchus complains. “And that was not my intent. He is behind you, truly.”
What’s
“…What do you mean?”
“I don’t want to hurt anyone. Brock’s a bully. He was picking on the new kid whose mom just died of sweating sickness. Said it was syphilis on account of her being a… um… an H – O – R,” he whispers, demonstrating both his knowledge of social niceties as well as his impressive grasp of letters. “Pinky’s littler than the rest of us, and Brock was mean to him for no reason. He made him cry,” Steven says, stating bluntly, “I don’t like bullies.”
“I’m glad we agree–”
Cap has already exited before Tony can finish insulting him.
Howard can disown Tony for all he cares; Tony is 18 – an adult – and there is little his father can threaten him with that will keep Tony under his thumb in such matters.
Steve tries to tell himself.
Steve sits on his haunches, his shoulders slack. He hears rustling and the soft clatter of metal as Stark returns the helmet atop his head. Then there are gloves, the leather still saturated with blood, reaching past Steve’s ears to lightly tug at the knot behind his head. The belt slides down, and Steve sees his reflection in the helmet, so close to his face, the fog of his breath gently puffing and receding across the metal.
“Cap?”
He breaks their kiss, his forehead resting on the other man’s. “Antony,” he murmurs into their shared breath. His hands slip into his toga, roaming from his hip then lower, trailing along the rise of his ass as his cock thickens against his thigh. “Antony, do you want… can I…”
“Really? That’s how you want to play this? I know you better than that. There’s someone you like, and if you just tell me about her, I can help you come up with a game plan to win her over. I’m good at that sort of thing. Genius, remember?”
“That’s not freedom,” Stefanus points out.
“Forget it, okay? I was… I was just testing them out. For science,” he says, internally screaming.
“The same place Steve’s been,” Bucky replies, his tone equally cutting. “Being poor ain’t contagious.”
“People die every day.” His parents had died just six weeks prior, and as far as Tony knows, his father had never sucked a dick in his life.
“Of course not.”
Denarius: Silver coin equal to 16 Asses or 4 Sestertii.
The situation doesn’t improve at dinner.
And now Bacchus seems a touch cagey, but still he confirms, “Yes. We are allowed to buy our freedom should we come into the funds through victories or… or doing that.”
For his part, Tony eases up on his drinking, if only fractionally.
“Why did you phrase it that way? That is not an encouraging answer in the slightest,” Rhodey complains. There’s another pause during which Tony can practically hear the man turning the answer over in his mind, deciphering its likely meaning. “How uh… how durable did you say he was?”
“It’s the thought that counts.”
Sir Steve Rogers’s brothers-in-arms offend the fae and are turned into swans. Steve strikes a bargain to lift the curse at his own peril.
“Oh, I’ll survive,” Tony tells him, reluctantly accepting Steve’s hand. “It’s you I’m worried about.”
Master Erskine smiles down at Steve gently then pats him on his upper back to subtly push him forward. “Go on. Up into the ship with you, alright? I need to talk to Master Phillips.”
They make the trek back in silence, each stewing in their righteous indignation over the other’s behavior. And when they make it back to the room, Tony goes into the en suite bathroom while Steve walks through the sliding doors to their pool deck.
“So, you’re two-faced,” Tony quips, “Good to know.”
Then, Tony rolls onto his side, his head resting on curled fingers. “That was…”
Bacchus is quiet after that, and Suibne finds himself somewhat disappointed with the development. He curls up, rolls to his side to face the wall, and falls into a fitful sleep to the sounds of the other men’s snores and the tinny clink-clink-clink of shifting chains.
He thinks of Gialetta engulfed in flames, her face scorched and scarred under the cursed Jade mask she now wears.
“Look, I know some things were said–”
A more traitorous voice whispers: If he had just freed him when Stefanus asked…
…I could make you, you know.
Tony Stark. I was expecting someone looking for a caretaker for an elderly parent or maybe a young child while they go to work, but uh… I didn’t realize you had a child?”
“What? No way,” Stark blusters, balking at the very idea. “Only a Mandalorian can–”
Cap prods the elbow joint, and Tony slaps off the phantom touch with a flick of his wrist.
Stark simply sighs, pulls up a hidden hatch in the floor, and takes out an emergency radio.
“But–”
He had been so careful to constrain his male hook-ups to pay-by-the-hour hotel rooms and men’s restrooms, and now, he actually took one home? How could he have been so stupid?
“Is it really that hard to believe I actually enjoy your company?”
“Bucky!” Steve shouts, but he stops short, his arms reeling as his boots barely toe the circle of dark green grass bordered by white mushrooms.
To be fair, Rhodey had never seen Mr. Rogers in person and likely had no knowledge of his physical shortcomings. Still–
“Sir, I don’t know what to tell you, but we followed your instructions to a T.” He flips the board over, showing him a scan of the handwritten notes.
“I don’t.”
“Suit yourself,” Tony says, feigning nonchalance as he gets off the cot and heads to a nearby cabinet where he keeps an extra change of clothes. “Don’t let the door hit your ass on the way out. I just had it cleaned, and–”
“How much of a discount?”
It does nothing to cheer Stefanus up, the loss having put a damper on his plans as well as his spirit. “You go on ahead. I’ll… I’ll come by the room later.”
(Funny side-note: Unlike Ancient Greece where small penises were preferred and large penises were associated with buffoonery and idiocy, a large penis was seen as attractive in Ancient Rome.)
“Stop it,” Stark says, a little louder this time.
“No, but you told him where we are going. ‘Safe Place’ and then spelling out T.Y.T.H.O.N.? What were you thinking?”
“But your leg–”
“I’m gonna stop you right there. You talk to women like you would talk to me,” Rhodey says, but he seems to think better of it when he recalls their first meeting. “You know what? Scratch that. You talk to women like you would talk to someone you’re interested in beyond what’s in their pants. You know, like a person.”
“You can call me Antony,” he says, lying down on his bed in seductive repose.
“To the average clone? Probably not,” he admits. “I’m still not dawdling on Tython to find out. I said I’d deliver you to the planet – that was the deal, and I’m sticking to it – but you’re on your own once we touch down, got it?”
“You didn’t have to,” Steve says, taking all of five steps to reach the dining area and place a steaming cup in front of Tony. He takes the adjacent seat, hands enclosed around his own cup for warmth as the radiator starts to rattle.
Once J.A.R.V.I.S. confirms Steve’s descent down the elevator, Tony finally gets up and staggers, naked and heaving, to the en suite master bathroom.
Tony chuckles even as his heart aches. “Okay, okay, I’ll let you keep your pride. This time.”
“Then enlighten me. What’s wrong with being Steve Rogers?”
“I suppose so, even comely ones such as he,” Romulus allows, even as his manner remains uneasy. “I’m sure he will guard your body closely, my friend.”
Tony thinks the same moment he replies, “Yeah, it was hard, but I got through it. Got the chip to prove it, too.” Their conversation is too stilted and awkward, more so than it has ever been between them. “So, I thought I’d ring you up and let you know that.”
“What? Safe sex, guys,” Clint protests. “Speaking of… Tony, you got any dental dams?” He takes Tony’s silence for refusal to engage in his gentle ribbing, and so he moves on to his next target.
of all people. And now that he had reverted back to an adult, there is only one thing left to do about it, the only sane recourse left after such a lapse:
Steve lies beside him, gathering Tony in his arms. “It’s not…” he begins, kissing him on the temple. “It’s not that I don’t want to, but I was thinking… if you wouldn’t mind… well…”
“Okay, just so we’re clear,” he turns to a side cabinet, opening it to find it disappointingly empty. “We’re here a couple days until Rhodey can tow us out, and then a couple more days so I can repair the damage and restock.” He looks over his shoulder, “I’m going to take stock of what is left of my ship and what parts I need so I can relay the information to Rhodey. Why don’t you make yourself useful and find a water source, maybe forage some berries or whatever you learned to do at Jedi scouts–”
The others groan when Dum Dum approaches with Steve in tow, his long-standing reputation having preceded him, having lost the thrower and his ilk more shillings than they cared to admit in their time together.
Steve puts him down then abruptly pulls his pants back on. “There’s nothing wrong with my dick.”
Thoroughly embarrassed, Tony removes them entirely. “I’m not blind,” he protests.
“Do you hate me so, that you would conspire to fell Bacchus with my own hand?”
“You’re about to lose one of the pair!” he shouts, his fingers already going for the eye gouge that Dum Dum deftly blocks. There’s a scuffle where Dum Dum takes Percival down, who sweeps out his legs then tries to kick him in the throat. Dum Dum pounces on his opponent as they roll towards the fire, knocking down and scattering the kindling as Bucky stands then advances, pulling the two apart with the help of the other four.
(Liar.)
he thinks. With bullets being in short supply until they can get Tony’s foundry up and running, he doesn’t bother with the gun, brandishing his knife instead. He holds one at bay, plunging it into the soft putrid flesh through its temple with a sickly squelch. The zombie groans, its mouth wide and yawning – a final death rattle – before falling to the pavement.
Tony knows he means it, but Steve still sounds so lost, so forlorn that Tony suggests, “You and me, we should get out of here for a little bit. I saw this list of the top 100 best burgers in America. What do you think? Road trip?”
Steve wrinkles his nose. “The Force is not a party trick.”
Steve commandeers an onion ring from Tony in retaliation. “I just don’t want your money to come between us. I don’t want it to make things weird.”
Rhodey frowns, tilting his head to regard his friend. “Tones… how many black friends you got? Am I your first?”
Antony mulls over his response then nods. “Alright, take all the time you need,” but his frown belies his words.
Steve fumbles at his belt, tossing the iron mace at his side as well as his steel sword and iron buckle for good measure behind him into the wood.
Wow, okay. Steve doesn’t have to get so worked up over a little joke. It’s not like Tony is actually calling him gay or anything. And even if he had been… was being attracted to the same sex such a bad thing?
“You bastard!” Antony shouts, nearly flying at Tiberius the next time they meet, aiming to gouge out an eye, uncaring of the consequences of such an action.
“Hey Tony, how about you and me get out of here?” A woman in a tight-fitting blue dress accosts him. Tony had found her confidence sexy the first half-dozen times they hooked up, but there is a time and place for that, and it is not now.
The stranger moans at a particularly deep thrust. “Yes, sir.”
Steve replies: B-U-C-K-Y-?
“Hey, you mind if I…” Steve takes out a pack of cigarettes from his pack, tapping one loose. “They’re prescription. For my asthma.”
“You don’t have to go on a cross-country trip just to make me feel better.”
“Yeah… I’m actually nervous about the visit, because… well…” Rhodey hesitates.
Or perhaps not.
Dracula chuckles, the sound wheezy and crackling like dry leaves. “Always the clever little rapscallion and a brilliant problem-solver,” he says, giving Tony a pat and firm side hug. “Oh how I love you, son.”
It isn’t fair.
“No matter what happens, after this, we are through,” he says, his voice measured and calm despite his anger. “You can order my body to your will – I cannot stop you from taking whatever you desire – but no more will I cherish you as I have.”
After all, imprisoned men are only entitled to so much privacy.
Steve supposes Tony’s company could be tolerable, even agreeable, when the man is mostly sober.
Rhodey yawns – it really is getting late – and snorts. “Sounds like you love the guy.”
Mamma freezes, so shocked at Tony’s outburst that he manages to twist out of her grip and wriggle away. He runs to his father, tugging on his sleeve as he begs him, “Don’t go, Dad! Please! I don’t want Mamma to die!” Tony is hysterical, but he doesn’t care. “Please, Dad! Don’t go!”
“That’s not going to happen,” Stark states resolutely. “You enslaved everyone.”
“We’re doing this backwards, aren’t we?”
Stark is on a roll. “You don’t know what your own master looked like?”
“That’s not what I–”
“You– you didn’t” -another gasp- “You didn’t have to choose,” Antony manages, biting his lip to stifle a moan, his breathing going high and eyes drifting closed on a particularly good thrust. He swallows, his chest heaving. “You– you could have had us… both.”
Steve doesn’t know, but he’ll protect Tony by any means necessary.
“You could do the same.”
“As a fling! I didn’t put a ring on it, and she wasn’t some ancient stick-in-the-mud either.”
“I know it has been… a long time since you’ve been with a woman,” Antony begins diplomatically, “and Julia here is a big fan of the games.”
“So, I got my own place in Brooklyn recently. It’s not much, but do you want to check it out?”
He continues to fuck into Antony, watching his face as he takes him apart, and Antony responds wonderfully, generous with his expressions, his touches, his love. Stefanus doesn’t want to be with anyone else, content to spend his days with the beautiful man below him.
“Mr. Stark, I’m sure you can appreciate that though fertility declines in your early forties, it’s not entirely out of the range of possibility, and the blood test is fairly conclus–”
“I’m being serious. It’s not usually like this for me. Usually…” Usually it hurts in a bone-deep way that transcends the physical. It is an ache in his very being, one that had yet to go away even as he lay next to a man who was trying his best to wipe the slate clean. “Usually it’s different.”
“Not really, no,” Bacchus looks up in consideration, “but I think I would like to travel, to go someplace far from here.”
“Then you would have perished long ago,” Bacchus interjects, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth despite the grim circumstances. “I did not have the heart to tell you, but I suppose if this is our last confessional and we are to be honest with each other… You were a disaster with the net. The shield and sword suit you much better.”
It’s silly. He’s about to have
Stefanus opens the flap and pulls out a large bronze disk, the design on the face of it made of concentric rings painted to match his gladiatorial armor surrounding an inlaid star on the raised center.
“–even if she happens to be very perceptive and also 100% correct,” he finishes. “Thank you, Finley.”
“I will not ask how it went because it’s rarely a happy answer, but it will get easier,” he says. “The freeborn… they have these ideas that are simply not practical for people like you and me. It… it does not make you any less of a man. Nothing that happened says anything about you. Or any of us.”
And that is how he had met him, the youth who would change the course of his life: Tiberius Servilius Priscus Structus.
“…Bucky is thirteen.”
“So, not that I don’t love a good fight, but you want to maybe get out of here before the cavalry arrives?” he offers, tipping his head south. “My ship is a couple klicks that way. I can have you off planet and on Tython in a matter of days.”
“I said shut up!” Steve stuffs three fingers into Tony’s mouth to stifle any further conversation and pushes back in, setting a punishing pace, uncaring of any whimpers from Tony. The slick squelch of their bodies moving together, Cap’s heavy breathing and Tony’s stifled moans blend together to form an obscene soundtrack to their frantic coupling. Tony’s hand slides downward to stroke his own weeping erection, tears forming at the corner of his eyes.
Once they are out of earshot, Stefanus feels he must ask. “Who was that?”
Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Steve just didn’t expect it to happen so soon.
Tony graduates his prep school three years early and gets into MIT’s engineering program. His parents are thrilled; Tony is less so.
That shuts Steve up. “I’m leaving,” he says over his shoulder as he exits. “Give me a call when you’re sober.”
Tony snorts, crosses his arms and leans against his dresser. “Stop being dramatic. You don’t need to leave.”
Tony stares at the back of Steve’s head, his form just barely visible from what little neon light filters in from the edges of the blackout curtains, and he knows, with a somber sort of clarity, that he can never reveal that side of himself to Steve.
Tony’s parents had sprung for the nice flower arrangement, snow white and voluminous, to adorn her coffin. It’s closed casket. Tony understands that it is because Ms. Sarah had been much too thin and frail in the end, hardly recognizable to those who had not witnessed her decline in the final six months.
But Steve insists, “It’s perfect.” He kisses his temple. “You’re perfect.”
“I’ll be there this weekend.”
How did it come to this?
Steve exits the ship to join them. He’s already secured all the cup holders two to a seat in the cockpit while adding additional ones to Stark’s central workstation table and the cargo area. He doesn’t know why Stark would need cupholders in the cargo area, but he figures better to have them and not need them than the reverse. Besides, after he had installed them in all the obvious places, there were still plenty left, and he felt he needed to put them somewhere.
“Mr. Stark, do not forget you have detention today,” Dr. Pym interrupts. “Day four of seven.”
“Heard you the first time.”
Perhaps this has been the gladiators’ plan all along, and Antony is a fool falling for a ruse, the long con, fully aware with his eyes wide open to Stefanus’s cruel deceit…
And that’s when he notices.
“What are you doing?” he asks, though the answer, when it comes, isn’t surprising in the least.
“Anyone ever tell you you have
“Yeah,” Steve concurs, his fingers swiping long strokes as if scrolling through a list. “I think we should eat each other out tonight. What are you guys thinking? Chinese?”
Tony knew that. He understood and respected Rhodey’s reasoning, his new direction in life, but– “I could really use you on this one. There’s no one with a better grasp of Egyptology, no one I trust as much as you anyway.” At least Rhodey would never turn on him for thirty pieces of silver. He’d ask for all the gold in Fort Knox before he’d even entertain such a betrayal.
And there it is, the truth splayed out, naked for both of them to see.
So Steve pulls Tony bodily to him, his hand pressed into Tony’s lower back as he grinds his growing erection against his pelvis and nips at his jaw then down from his ear, biting and sucking a dark mark there. Tony tries to pull away, but he’s no match for Steve’s strength. Steve pushes him up against the cold cement wall and starts to work on his jeans while Tony starts to unbutton Steve’s plaid shirt, grasping the bottom to pull apart his shirt, popping the last few buttons.
“What are you doing? You already have your own bucket.”
“Packing,” Steve replies, not even pausing in his activity.
“Color me surprised. You haven’t even gotten halfway through your fourth scotch. Have those lessons from AA finally sunk in?”
Steve raps Stark on the arm. “There’s nothing wrong with bottoming.”
Steve just stares at him in disbelief, too terrified(?) to move.
“There’s one,” Tony points to a dusty box with the top popped open on an upper shelf, “Lucky me, last one in stock.” Steve watches as Tony drops his bat and gleefully retrieves a rolling ladder, wheeling the creaky contraption across the concrete with a loud squeak and screech to line it up before he climbs it, reaching inside for his prize. “Got it.” He looks down at Steve in triumph before his face turns ashen and terrified.
for sale.” Stefanus looks to the side table. “There is oil enough if you plan to have me, Dominus.”
“Okay, we need to break it down. Be careful; they might be scared and armed, which is never a good combination,” he warns the others.
Stark can be so pedantic.
“The submarine is called ‘the Avenger’?” Steve inquires, getting caught up in the smallest of details as if he himself wasn’t about to half-ass his primary character’s entire backstory.
“No,” Master Erskine replies, having chosen to answer only his second inquiry. Steven is visibly disappointed. “I am a Jedi. My name is Master Erskine.”
“Hadrianus is running for re-election, and he believes it is my duty to show my face at such events,” he admits. “I can be charming in small doses, but most find me tiresome after a while. Outside of Romulus – he is an old friend from the academy – I do not get on with most people. Should we continue our… arrangement, you may find yourself growing weary of my various eccentricities as well.” There’s a pause there where Antony must expect his companion to protest, but when Stefanus stays silent, he continues, “Would you like that? If I were to extend our arrangement?”
“We’ll be knights then and free to travel where we may.” Perhaps even together for a spell, before they are required to take on their own padawans.
“I understand that it might have made you feel… inadequate.”
Jarvis is back, already placing Tony’s usual green smoothie in front of him with a bendy straw.
“Mead? He’s pregnant.” Bruce points out reasonably.
“Stop bullshitting me, Steve! Seeing what’s-his-face made you uncomfortable! Admit it!”
“I mean… it’s a lot longer in the movies.”
“You made a paternity suit?” Clint interrupts again, chuckling at his own pun.
Tony is standing in front of the mirror in the ensuite bathroom, dabbing a light coating of concealer to the bruise blooming on his cheek and along his orbital bone. He rolls his eyes at his reflection even as he dusts powder over the cream to set it.
“Howard–”
Tony practically deflates. “Aw… can’t you let me off early this one time?” he tries to wheedle. “Bruce and I are working on a robotics project that will knock your socks off.”
Nat holds up a spare cord coming from a multiport power brick near the couch. “One spot left.”
“I wanted to,” he replies. Steve is worth it and more.
with envy,” Tony says, snickering to himself.
“What do you say, Rhodey? One last adventure? For old time’s sake.”
He doesn’t know how much time has passed when there’s a soft dip in the mattress and a warm presence by his side.
“And would you ever sleep with him given the opportunity?”
“I want to use the radio,” Steve states evenly, his hand not retreating from his lightsaber. “I need to check in with someone.”
Stefanus pulls him into a warm embrace. “I’m not leaving you, Bacchus,” he declares.
“It’s nothing,” Steve says, but Tony knows he only has to wait a few minutes before– “It’s just that… well… I don’t know. It’s stupid.”
“Mr. Stark, I don’t know if it’s wise to–”
Dracula hums, flicks his hand to look at his talons. “And if I had meant it, you would be dead,” he states matter-of-factly. “It is a long drive back to your abode. You and Anthony will spend the night here. In separate bedrooms of course. I am what you would call a ‘night person,’ and I will be keeping watch.”
Stefanus thinks that must be hard to navigate, considering how prominent his father is, but still–
“That’s it, honey. You’re doing so well. So good for me, Steve.”
He's almost gotten the hang of it, of slipping back into that headspace when suddenly there’s a cloth draped over his groin and a familiar voice telling him to “Get dressed and get out.”
Steve captures Tony’s hands then spins him around to plant them on the wall as he pushes Tony’s chest up against the cool surface and plunges in with one smooth thrust. It’s too much too soon. Tony grunts in pain and his body clenches, seizing up against Cap, trapped as he is between the man’s bulk and the cold cement. To Tony’s disappointment, Steve stops at the show of pain and gently tries to withdraw, the hands on his wrists loosening, caressing the skin there in an almost-soothing fashion.
“I will be holding a munus in honor of your mother. I have already contracted Priscus to supply the entertainment. Your gladiator – Stefanus, was it? – will be matched against Ignatius, a veteran of sixteen matches of which he’s won fifteen and has had to be reprieved only once.”
,” he repeats. He wants Stark to understand. This isn’t about them; it’s him. Steve simply
In such circumstances, he really hoped that would be the case.
“Hey!”
“You know, you should have a little respect for Captain America. The man’s an American hero and didn’t deserve what he got. He was a good man who sacrificed himself to save the City, which included your mother at the time. Why, without him, you wouldn’t have been born at all.”
“So. That’s a no.”
The mission isn’t exactly a bust – after all, they had found and identified the tomb of the seventh Pharaoh of the Twentieth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Egypt still intact, even after all this time – but one thing’s for certain: This is one adventure Marvels will
Tony is moderately impressed with himself. Six months ago, Steve was a dinosaur, a fossil of another era. He liked vinyl records and baseball and boxing. He considered Sunday pot roast with a side of vegetables boiled to within an inch of their lives to be the height of fine dining, especially when accompanied by canned fruit cocktail topped with whipped cream for dessert, and he couldn’t for the life of him figure out how to use a computer, much less a modern telephone.
Suibne eyes the exit.
“Stark is supposed to be…”
“You think I’m going to sit back and let them get away with this?”
Stefanus sheaths himself in as far as he can go and kisses Antony, their sweat comingling and musky on his tongue. “I only want you,” he murmurs.
Ignatius is left-handed.
“It’s just… well, I haven’t kissed anyone, and what if everyone else has their first kiss, and I don’t, and then I’m bad at it? What if Peggy picks Freddy over me because I miss and kiss her nostril or something? Where do I put my hands?” He holds them up in front of Tony in desperation. “Or what if my tongue is weird – I mean, what am I even supposed to do with it – or what if I have bad breath? You’d tell me if I had bad breath, right?”
“I’m not the one who just ran out in the street in a towel to make sure,” Bucky answered.  Steve punched him in the arm, and Bucky just laughed.  “I’m sure Mrs. Grady appreciated that, by the way.”  He mimicked flipping up the towel, and Steve punched him again before looking away.
“If there’s anything I can do to help —“ Tony started to offer.
Bucky had rinsed off the straight razor and was washing his face again to get rid of the remaining lather when Tony plugged the radio in.  Static hissed through the speakers, and Tony didn’t miss the moment when Bucky turned around to look at him directly.  He turned the tuning dial, finding a station that was playing some kind of big bang swing.  The sound of brass filled the room, woodwinds providing the supporting chords underneath and a cymbal and drums keeping beat in the background.  Tony turned it up, ostensibly to check the vibration, until he was sure that the music could be heard drifting out through the open windows.
Steve came suddenly and completely awake, his heart pounding in his chest.  It felt like before the serum, when he used to have trouble catching his breath, his heart feeling like it was going to come completely out of his chest.  The sheets were wrapped around him, damp and musty from sweat, and Steve tried to roll away, falling onto the floor in a tangle of linens and blankets.  When he pushed himself up onto his forearms, he could see the lightening of the horizon beyond the buildings, the grey suffusing the dark sky as dawn inched towards Manhattan.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Tony’s voice said in Steve’s ear.  “We’re clearly a group of high-functioning, very well adjusted, very dangerous adults who happen to live in the same place.  It’s practically
Steve wasn’t a problem that just needed to be fixed.  He just needed to settle in, to find his place in this time.  He thought of his ma’s radio that Tony had fixed, and his expression when he’d first seen it.  That questioning look, the one with the edge, that wondered why in the hell they were keeping something that was broken and useless.
“Anthony Edward Stark,” Tony replied, taking his hand.  They both gripped, but this time it wasn’t so much a show of force as was an understanding.  “You can call me Tony.”
Eyes skittering away from Steve’s gaze, Tony hesitated.  “I don’t remember.”
Steve noticed — Tony could tell by how his eyes were rounded and obviously followed him around the room.  Not that it was hard to tell where he was — his wheezing was consistently worse than Steve’s on a bad day.  It was the day when Tony couldn’t even get down the stairs to go to the bakery that Bucky stepped in.
Bucky smiled back, hesitant at first, before it bloomed into the cocky smile Steve was used to.  Steve pulled him into a hug, his arms trembling from how hard he gripped Bucky, then released him.  Bucky walked to the train, giving Steve a salute before stepping inside.
It wasn’t an asthma attack.  It was a panic attack.
“I’ll tell Steve you said so,” Tony replied carefully.
Steve Rogers was gay, and Bucky was prepared to do whatever it took to protect Steve from the consequences of it.  Not only that, Steve must have had other relationships, or at least trysts, because Bucky wasn’t surprised, or disgusted, or even particularly put out by Steve bringing another man home.  Although it certainly appeared they had never talked about it directly either.
So he stalked them, and he watched them, and he thought about them as he rode back towards Las Vegas.  And as he followed the R8, the sun continued to sink lower, the late afternoon shadows lengthening out behind the two vehicles until the shadows of the two men in the convertible blurred into his.
What a fucking idiot.  And he was supposed to be a genius.
“Uh,” Tony replied, momentarily thrown.  Bucky gave him a sympathetic glance.  “Yes.  Helen.  Helen couldn’t find any letters from your mother, so she called the doctor. Dr. Hudson.”  Steve nodded, mollified that Tony at least knew his name.  Tony swallowed, taking a small, burning sip from his glass.  “Apparently the doctor had been trying to get Bucky at the Navy Yard but couldn’t because of what happened last night.”
Tony could see by the look in Bucky’s eyes that he meant it, even now, before he ever knew who Captain America was.
The sun rose over Long Island as Steve sat there, motionless for hours, the sky fading from deep blues into pinks and oranges, its light sparkling across the water of the Long Island Sound and the East River.  The sky lightened into a light blue — but not quite the
“You want to have sex with me?”
Antony seems to give up the charade, baldly telling him, “Then I beg your forgiveness for such an unreasonable query. I, for one, prefer to be fucked, but I am willing to try the reverse if that is your preference. I do not wish to deny you your pleasure as well.”
“too old. Check again.”
Some secrets are easier to share in the dark, when neither can see the other’s face, only hear their steady breathing, their low voices soft with an almost unbearable honesty.
“Stark!” Another man approaches them already smelling strongly of martinis and scotch. “We’ve missed you at the club. You haven’t been around in a while, and Ryan and I were thinking about hosting another…
“Would you like to come over here and find out?” Tony retorts, puckering up to make kissy-faces at Bucky.
Surprisingly, that isn’t quite the conclusion Tony is aiming for, not anymore.
“All jokes aside, I really didn’t expect to get lucky on my honeymoon.” He flops down on his back. “We should do that more often.”
But perhaps his pregnancy had granted him a bit more leniency where Cap was concerned. The alpha is old-fashioned like that. It is a bit patronizing in a way, but if it meant their infallible leader would excuse Tony’s eccentricities time and again, writing them off as the foibles of a hormonal pregnant omega… well, what is the harm?
“What I should have done is gone with you today,” Steve says. “I left you alone. That was unwise and outside mission parameters.”
Tony isn’t sure if it’s the distance or Steve’s new physique, but during the six weeks of Christmas break, he develops something of a crush on the other boy. Whenever Steve looks at him, he feels giddy, almost shy, and even his casual touch is electrifying.
love with him. He might be fond of Tony, sure, and very very fond of his ass. They are sort of a package deal, so it makes sense that Steve is somewhat invested in Tony’s survival.
Steve thinks. The Republic is thousands of years old. How could a single man, the leader of its governing body, undo generations of tradition in one declaration? Is this what Master Phillips and the Jedi High Council had sought to prevent? Was this the hill they chose to die on? The line in the sand they tried and ultimately failed to defend?
All things considered, it hadn’t been Tony’s best decision, and he instantly regretted it in the grey dawn of morning when he woke up with a sore ass and crippling anxiety over having been drunk enough to not only hook up with a man the night before but in his own bed no less where Steve (and to a lesser extent, Jarvis) could potentially catch them together.
Rhodey is Tony’s best friend at MIT, and he desperately wants the feeling to be mutual. And so they study and hang out together until Tony is fairly certain he’s grown on Rhodey, like a taste for fine wine or (more accurately) an infestation of black mold.
“Tony. Tony, please,” Steve murmurs.
He grunts in pain at a particularly rough thrust, his fingernails clawing Steve’s back and legs shaking. Tears prickle at the corner of his eyes, and he wonders if he’s bleeding, if Steve has torn something deep inside.
It might be Tony’s imagination but Steve’s shoulders seem to go tense, his affect turning sheepish. “Oh… yeah, that’s uh… that second one is for–” he coughs, “One’s for guests.”
“Yeah, that was his name,” Stark sneers. “Who did you think I was describing?”
“I’ll still replace your shoes… uh…”
“Quiet, you,” Tony huffs but still manages to sound fond. “I still can’t believe you turned down twins. I’m sure they would have said yes if you were game.”
“Well then, I guess that means you’re out of luck. Besides, you look like you’ve aged four years in four months.” He uses his thumb and forefinger to mirror the shape of Tony’s goatee on his own face.
“Yes.”
“He can be a hypochondriac where I’m concerned. One time, I wanted to go as Lady Godiva for Halloween, but he was worried about the little details, like ‘freezing my balls off’ and ‘getting arrested,’ when he should have pointed out that I probably couldn’t pull off a very convincing Lady Godiva.”
But Antony waves him off. “You are too kind, Aternius, and Lucius is a tempting treat, but I must decline tonight. A man’s work is never done, and I must rise early on the morrow if I am to draw up the plans for improvements to the city’s aqueducts,” he sighs dramatically and truly does look sorry for missing out on the boy’s company, but “Sometimes a man must put off what he desires to do in favor of what he must.”
“Steve. I want to, but… it’s the meds. It’s difficult for me to… to get hard and stay that way, okay?”
She flushes the evidence. “It is nothing, patatino. Nothing for you to worry about.”
“Who said I wanted to be born?”
Aemilius pats Suibne on the back, pointedly casual with an easy smile to reassure the boy even as he tells Fidelis, “Better the babysitter than the pet.”
Well, he should, but instead Tony hugs his pillow to his face, rolling into the center, towards the natural crevice Steve had made with the imprint of his body.
Some men like to exert their dominance, to push a man down onto any flat surface and make him take it. Perhaps it makes them feel big to force their cocks into spaces that do not want them, makes them feel like real men, virile men. But others are like Antony, men who have everything but what they crave most.
He pulled his dog tags out from under his shirt and rubbed the pad of his thumb over the St. Monica medal hanging next to them.  Her features were almost entirely worn away from the innumerable times he’d made that very same gesture.  His head still bowed, Steve thought of his ma and recited the Prayer to St. Monica, as he had heard her do so many times.  Finished, he traced the engraving of her name on the headstone: Sarah Bridget Donahue Rogers.
Avoiding Tony’s gaze, Steve ran his finger along the rubber seam of the door.  That earned him a nudge from Tony’s elbow, and Steve looked up to find Tony studying him between glances at the road.  “It’s okay to feel like he should be here,” Tony clarified.  “We certainly talked about this trip enough.”
He’d always found it such a comfort, something he could cling to — Tony wasn’t dead, just gone back to wherever it was he’d come from in the first place.
He took a long drink, slurping it noisily, before adding, “Don’t make me tell your ma.  She’ll be very disappointed in you.”
The four of them eventually established a comfortable evening routine that they stuck to most nights.  Natasha, Clint, and Steve would spar in the afternoons and, after cleaning up and changing into comfortable clothes, they would go to the common area and start prepping for dinner.  They took turns deciding the menu, and uncommon or sentimental dishes from their childhoods were encouraged.  Bruce would appear a little later unless it was his night, helping with the final meal prep and by setting the table.  They would eat together and usually do something afterwards, like play a game or watch a movie, before going to their individual apartments to wind down before bed.
He only understood when Natasha explained to him that Clint’s reception back at Shield had been chilly at best.  Loki had killed over sixty agents at the facility where they were keeping the Tesseract when he destroyed it, and many agents felt that Clint was complicit.  He had returned to cold stares and turned backs, as well as refusals to work with him.  Someone had scrawled the words “traitor” and “murderer” on the door to his barracks.  The general feeling was that Clint was personally responsible for Phil Coulson’s death.
He woke up again in a panic, startling so violently he almost fell off his chair.  It took him a second to place the source of his panic.  There were no enemies to be seen, no gunfire whizzing over his head, no frightened Commandos around him rushing to pack up camp and move out as quickly as possible.  He realized the soothing beep of the pulse ox had dipped in its pitch, lower than he had ever heard it.  The alarm sounded followed, the sharp digital squawking filling the room.
Tony shifted on the couch, throwing off the afghan.  He neatly folded it back up and put it on the back of the couch.  Then he came through the door into the kitchen.  Steve was seated at the table with his back to the door, and his movement must have attracted Bucky’s attention because he was already focused over Steve’s shoulder at the doorway.
“When I got there, the girl at the desk —“
“Sir has found that your eating habits run on a 5.2 week cycle, mostly based on when you order groceries, during which you fluctuate your weight, calorie intake, exercise, fat and muscle mass, the types of food you eat, where you eat, and whom you eat with. This seems to affect the amount of time you spend with everyone else on the common floor, your physical performance, your mood, and your sleep,” the precise, British voice informed Steve — and everyone else in the room.
Steve relished every hit on the Valkyrie, every punch he took from Schmidt.  The pain helped him to focus, penetrating the haze that Bucky’s death had left behind.  The lack of sleep had finally overwhelmed the serum, and Steve found himself alternating between feeling like he was back in Brooklyn getting the shit kicked out of him somewhere and moving through a fog where everything was indistinct and ultimately not very important.  It was only when the heavens opened up and Schmidt dissolved into the stars, when the Tesseract burnt through the floor of the Valkyrie and fell into the ocean that the world came back into focus and stayed there, instead of fading into gray.
Steve took a step forward out of Tony’s grasp, his own hands in his pockets.  He loomed over the other man, clearly unimpressed.  “You mean, ‘the good ol’ days?’” He replied, his tone mocking.  “When people couldn’t step out with whomever they loved?  When women couldn’t have their own bank accounts or credit cards?  When African Americans had to fight in different units and go to different schools and drink out of separate water fountains?  When you could be thrown in jail or castrated or made to take hormones for loving a man instead of a woman?  I guess I’m not sure what exactly made them better.”
“No, I’m okay,” Steve answered softly.  “I don’t think I’m very hungry anymore though.”  He stepped away from the counter, the rolls forgotten, and Tony watched as he walked away, disappearing into the stairwell to go down to his floor.
Surveying the damage, Tony made no move to push his chair farther away from the table.  Instead, he picked up one of the shards of glass and tapped it against the tabletop.  “What makes you think I’m mourning something?” he asked.
Stefanus freezes. He realizes in that moment that he may love Antony too, but the concept is too big, too dangerous to contemplate considering their unequal partnership. Antony says he loves him now, but he could discard him just as easily, leaving Stefanus heartbroken with little recourse as he is forced to watch the man he loves take on another lover under his very nose. It’s too much of himself to give, but he had given it before he even understood what he was losing. And so he holds back in the tiniest of ways, refusing to declare the truth of his feelings, at least for now.
“Very good, Steve. You’re picking it up right quick, you are,” Bucky praises him. “We will have you reading in no time.”
“Well, when you put it that way… No. I am clearly fantastic.”
“Sorry to disappoint, ma’am, but I’d prefer to be alone.” He takes a sip of his drink, being sure to flash the gold band on his left hand. “I’m on my honeymoon.”
“Like what?”
Perhaps it is for the best. It’s what he had requested from Rhodey: No beauties, and they didn’t come prettier than Ms. Potts. At least this way, any temptation to make their relationship anything more than professional had been nipped in the bud.
Dr. Pym doesn’t relent. “My classroom. Today. After school.”
Stefanus hunches over, his arms circling his meal tray though there is no need to guard anything with the rare wheat rations being so plentiful tonight in substitution of their usual barley. “It was money well spent.”
Tony is at his wit’s end. “Don’t tell me we’ve fucked too, and you want to ‘rekindle our romance.’” He doesn’t even remember the guy behind the bar, and he usually remembers all his sexual partners, except for the ones that happened to be masked at the time, and the man doesn’t seem the type to be invited to that sort of event.
“Of course they would have,” Steve replies, his voice dripping with insincerity, “because Becca and Annie would have also said yes to two strange men traveling from out of state and staying in the same hotel room.”
Tony doesn’t remove the arm around the good doctor’s shoulders. It could be a gesture of camaraderie, if he hadn’t been complimenting the man on the muscle definition of his biceps minutes earlier, just loud enough for the super-soldier to hear. “Don’t know, Cap. If it’s a question of ability–”
I am tentatively adding this fic to a series.
“What did I tell you about fighting?”
“But he’s literally got a chainsaw attached to one hand,” Steve tries to talk sense into him.
It takes a moment, but Bacchus returns the gesture, his arms wrapped around his friend’s back. “Then you are a fool.”
“You boys going to stand in the driveway all day or will you be coming inside for a snack?” Ms. Sarah calls out from the door as Jarvis walks past carrying Tony’s bags.
“I won’t get to see you that much anymore, you know.” He looks off to the side, at Tony’s last set of bags ready to be packed away. “It’s just… It’ll be different.”
Tony withdraws his hand then falls back to lie flat on the bed, his breathing heavy.
Tony reflexively draws up his legs, clutching his pillow like a crab, before relenting. “You are inhuman,” he complains. “This is a violation of the Geneva Convention.”
Antony’s arm tightens around him, his tone a touch strained. “Stefanus, have you ever… that is before me, did you like sex?”
“You really think one man is that powerful?” Stark scoffs, his head turned away. “The Jedi tried, but the Senate… they could have stopped him and instead they chose to stand aside.”
Steve shrugs. “Well, it is a very masculine color scheme.”
Only to be struck in the head with the body of a LEM Products #10 manual grinder, crushing the skull and destroying the brain inside. Before Steve can react, Tony has swung the grinder by the hand crank to bash in the head of the third zombie. As it falls, Tony screams, continuing to bring the metal body down again and again on the zombie's skull until it is nothing but a pulpy mess.
The man had stepped aside, clearing the way for Steve to exit. “After you.”
“But does it please you?” Antony presses.
“Antony,” he corrects him.
It is his personal hell.
Tony almost doesn’t want to ask, but: “That a problem?”
“Tony, you should pay attention,” Howard had interjected. “Your mother and I rarely see you these days, and we’d prefer you be present when possible.”
“Are you saying I’m not getting lucky on my own honeymoon? For shame, darling.”
Stefanus complies with his request, smearing a generous dollop along his length before kneeling on the bed and pulling Antony’s hips up over his thighs. He leans over Antony, his body covering his as he leaves open-mouthed kisses along his collarbone, up his neck in such a way that has Antony panting. He thrusts gently, his cock gliding shallow between his cheeks, slicking the way, teasing him as it slides past his entrance. Antony sucks in a short breath when Stefanus nibbles on his ear, and he turns his head to meet Stefanus’s lips, his own hips rising to meet Stefanus, to tempt him inside.
Plus, Tony didn’t seem particularly traumatized…
Something in Tony’s chest dies a little at that, but he buries it deep, soldiers on. “It’s not a real first kiss. It’s just practice, so you won’t mess up the first time with Peggy.”
Tony rolls his eyes in an exaggerated fashion. “I’m not gonna. We can still–”
Tony stiffens for a moment, just long enough for Purple Man to know he got to him, before he continues out the door.
“No–”
It harkens back to many earlier discoveries, which had grown more frequent the longer it had been since civilization collapsed. Steve braces himself for the worst.
“I’m serious, Tony. If you want to be one of us, then you don’t have the luxury of puzzling out the humanity of the undead, not when they remain a serious threat to the living.”
Master Phillips had said.
That’s it? That’s all you have to say for yourself.”
Stefanus meets Antony’s first lover, a freeborn patrician named Tiberius. Antony becomes jealous of Bacchus.
After dropping that bomb, Steve abruptly stands and speed walks out of Tony’s room, turning left down the hallway towards his own before Tony can react.
“What the…?” Stark looks up at the explosion blooming, barreling down one them as he takes a hard dip to avoid the blast zone before quickly taking out the last tie fighter and beating a hasty escape.
That night, after Steve had found a water source and foraged for a miniscule amount of food he knows to be edible (some nuts and fruit that have already been bitten into and half-eaten by various bird species), they hunker down inside the ruins of the Mandalorian’s ship, draping a tarp over the entrance to keep out the cold and any nocturnal predators.
“Good thinking. I don’t know what I’d do without my stash of signature cologne, four bottles of specialty shampoo, and twenty pairs of designer swimwear.”
“I could try.”
Steve stands as well. “My master wasn’t a ‘grumpy asshole.’ He was kind and full of joy, and he always encouraged me to become the best Jedi he knew I could be.”
Tony hopes he doesn’t screw up.
Stefanus can tell Fidelis already regrets his choice in the training swap. Erasmus likely received a retiarius he could use to train his secutores in the finer points of combat, and here Fidelis was stuck with a distracted secutor who lost to all but the greenest of retiarii.
bathroom.
Steve had made a similar miscalculation back in the early days. He still remembers the screams, the torn flesh, the fevered look in Dum Dum’s rapidly-yellowing eyes, the irises turning milky and unfocussed–
First off, there’s War Machine…
“It’s just… you’re going all the way to Boston,” Steve says, almost plaintively. He’s going to miss him; they both will.
“You should loosen up a little,” Tony is telling him. “Relax. It won’t kill you to remove that stick from your ass. I’m fairly certain it’s not load-bearing,” he takes another sip of his cocktail. “And if it is, bill me for the damages. You know I’m good for it.”
Okay, so… maybe he earned the right hook that followed that particular statement.
Stark’s hands, shaky as they are, are surprisingly strong on Steve’s wrists. He’s shaking his head. Steve knows what it means. Stark doesn’t want to remove the helmet, doesn’t want to break his vow, but his life depends on Steve gaining access to the wound.
“Priscus sets the purchase price, and he’s not letting any of us go. Don’t you get it, Stefanus?” Bacchus suddenly explodes, his spoon dropping with a thud in his bowl as his fingers curl into fists. “You’ll never earn enough. Staius could make it worth his while, but not you, not a slave he barely pays.”
Tony goes to sit between his father and his new fiancé, placing a dart gun from the glove compartment on the table in front of him. “Good, because I was about to tranq you both if you couldn’t behave,” he says rather cheerfully, his face alight with mischief and good cheer.
some crusty mummy,” Steve finishes for him. “I will not be the one conducting the full body cavity search to fish it out. I don’t have the training for that.”
“I wasn’t poisoned,” Tony interrupts him, “Well, not surreptitiously anyway. It’s the side-effects of my medication. Chemotherapy. Doctor’s orders.” He waves towards the bottle of pills on the bathroom vanity. “I’m not supposed to drink with them, but…” he gives a half-shoulder shrug. “Tumor’s inoperable. I’m only delaying the inevitable. Might as well enjoy the time I have left.”
It is not the same thing at all.
“We are newlyweds. This is our honeymoon, and we are
“Well, joke’s on you. I hired him.”
They don’t talk about Steve, at least not at first.
“I will see you at port,” Master Erskine repeats, heading into what turns out to be the Brookland Home for Boys.
“I said I’d get you laid, so I’m volunteering.” Tony gives him a leer as he suggestively rubs his calf against Steve’s side. “Take off your pants.”
“I do not understand the point of this exercise,” Dum Dum complains from his seat across the fire. He rests his chin upon his palm, his fingers tapping at his lips before stroking down his bushy mustache. “You already have letters enough to sign your name. A man needs no more than that.”
At breakfast, Tony does thank Rhodey. He shudders to think what would have happened if the man hadn’t been there to stop his more-destructive impulses.
Then, he will forget all about the Mandalorian.
“I will not allow you to make me into a fool.”
They’re not going to die, and besides: “It’s not a sex toy; it is a very important, very expensive artifact–”
Probably not, considering he had been near-death and still he refused to remove it, not while Steve could still see him.
Do we understand each other?
It isn’t until their midday break that Bacchus approaches Stefanus, having brought the latter’s rations to him while he rested his bruised and aching body.
“So, what you’re saying is girls like to be called women?” Tony had asked one day while they were studying for their computational thinking exam.
They dance a simple box step across the floor with Steve watching his feet to ensure he doesn’t step on Tony’s toes until he gets the hang of it.
“I am certain Romulus would still care for me if I were to fall from grace.”
Okay, so maybe Antony needn’t have had any concerns about the man’s cock. It’s larger than normal, proportional to his broad frame, and already stiffening up under his gaze.
Stefanus thinks deliriously as he follows the nimble retiarius around the arena, the referees remaining on the periphery.
“I didn’t even know they still made them in this color,” Steve is saying, palming the edge of the porcelain bathtub. “All the catalogues these days show white fixtures only.” It was something he had mentioned to Tony in passing during the planning process. Tony had brushed it off as just another neutral comment about the difference between 1942 and the present, but perhaps Steve had wanted something different (or rather something familiar).
It starts like this: Tony is sitting on his parents’ bed, his legs swinging with the toes halfway to the hardwood floor, while he watches his mother apply lipstick in front of the vanity. His eyes meet hers in the reflection, and she smiles at him much too soon. Her lips are red, and the color feathers out to stain her flawless skin.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
They collect what they can, raiding the aisles of sorely-needed supplies – rolls of wire, gears, solder, and other such materials Tony identifies as necessary to shore up the settlement’s defenses – before Steve finally relents and takes him to the kitchen aisle.
“Mandalore has been taken over?”
“Hit a nerve, did I?” Purple Man muses, a finger tapping his chin. “I wonder… have you been able to look at him lately? Does he look at you the same way, knowing what you want from him, what you are really capable of?”
“It’s fine,” Stefanus replies, because it is leagues better and less degrading than anything else he has had to do for money. “It’s just… it’s a lot of money to spend on one such as I.”
. Jan practically lives with Tony at the Stark Mansion serving as the team’s headquarters. Yeah, Tony can be self-centered, and his mansion is enormous to an almost grotesque degree, but had he really not noticed her presence?
Stark’s voice drops low. “Shut up.”
“No, I just want to talk to him, man to man,” Steve replies. He has been practicing, playing out how the scene would go in his head during his morning run for the past two weeks, and he will not be deterred.
“It’s not that far. I’ll be home for the holidays, and if you want to visit…”
“Debatable, but ultimately irrelevant. I’ve got an arc reactor now, enough juice for fifty lifetimes,” he quips. “Now, are you going to be able to find your way back, or do I have to draw a map?” Tramp stamps are so 1999, but if he has to break out a sharpie and draw a downward arrow, he will.
The swan who had been Bucky honks and waddles over, his gait ungainly as he flaps his wings as if telling Steve to leave, to save himself.
“Quite.”
Hadrianus considered a politically-motivated munera as pandering to the masses. He had even gone so far as to call Caesar’s famous munus of sixteen years prior an embarrassment, an unnecessarily elaborate largesse, especially considering the rumors swirling around the man’s excessive debt.  He preferred to run a clean campaign instead… by bribing every family of consequence and influence, of course.
Steve just stares dumbly at Tony.
“Oh really? Captain America might have bought her thirty-five years, but you let her die while searching for his corpse. You always prioritized him over us, never able to accept the truth. Well, here it is: Captain America’s dead; do you hear me? He’s dead! And yet finding him was still more important to you than Mom’s life. What would the good captain have had to say about that, huh?”
“I think you called it team bonding,” Tony replies, deliberately obtuse, as he eyes Cap’s aggressive posturing, the vein slightly pulsing in his temple. He congratulates himself on selecting the right target to drum up the man’s ire. He had initially considered the wisdom of using Nat to bait him instead but had settled on Bruce for two reasons:
Concubinus: Male concubine, pretty much always a slave but with an elevated status in the household. Upper class men may have a concubinus until they took a wife, at which time the concubinus may be discarded. Occasionally, a treasured one may be passed down as an inheritance father to son. The female version is a concubina.
Can’t argue with that logic.
And now Stefanus is a touch sheepish himself. “I wanted to.” It had seemed like a good idea five minutes ago, but perhaps Antony had long resigned himself to Stefanus being little more than a platonic escort, a paid companion, and no longer thought of him that way. “I apologize if I was being too forward. It will not happen again.” He had hesitated, had waited too long, and now he had misinterpreted Antony’s kindness for interest. He had seen the man gift dozens of his acquaintances with similar thoughtfulness, and yet Stefanus had thought himself special in that regard. Like an idiot.
Rogers gasps, his grip loosens, and Tony thinks he’s won their little game of Gay Chicken when he feels it: the man’s growing erection pressed against his thigh. Tony pulls away in surprise before he can think better of it, and Rogers covers the offending member with his hands, his expression bereft and slightly horrified.
…Okay, maybe he wouldn’t have gone that far.
“I can see that, and I still think it looks swell, real high-class, you know. It looks like a fancy bathroom in one of the grand hotels back in the day. I never saw one in person, but there was a lady in my building; she used to clean rooms in the Ritz, and she said all the best bathrooms were pink. The color really makes your skin glow,” Steve explains. He gives Tony a once-over, appreciative of the way the warm light cast off their surroundings highlighted his skin. “You look good in pink.”
“Come on, Steve… one for you, one for me,” he had tried to tempt him in Philadelphia when he had managed to land twins.
“But if we can make it into the forest, then maybe – Watch out!” Master Phillips sends a rock flying ahead of Steve which bursts a foot from his back, deflecting a direct hit with enemy fire. He then cries out, having been hit himself in the thigh. Steve returns to his master’s side, slicing through the man who had fired on him and beating back additional forces.
“Could I think on it for a spell?” Stefanus asks in lieu of a straightforward answer.
So Bucky is a dick. Two can play at that game.
Romulus raises a brow. “Your wedding then?”
But Steven Rogers represents a fresh start. He doesn’t go to his school; he doesn’t know him as the weird child prodigy (key word being
“–that are not up for discussion,
Tablinum: Study where all the family records are kept which usually served as the bedroom of the paterfamilias and his wife
Steve is doing much better, or as much as can be expected. He pretends well enough when the guys pay their respects and when Bucky tries to convince him to stay over at his parents’ place for a few days while he is on leave,
The doctores retiarii, an ex-gladiator named Fidelis, hadn’t been impressed with ‘Stefanus,’ loudly complaining to the doctores secutorum about the quality of the men assigned to his stable.
“No.”
“You should have seen your face just now!” Tony crows, but when Steve looks put out by the joke, he tries to play it off. “Aw come on, Cap. Don’t be like that. It’s not like you were actually in danger.”
“Yeah, that’s pretty much it in a nutshell.”
“I am… happy for you both.”
And more importantly: Is it true?
Stark doesn’t respond, leaving only one possibility.
(2) Nat would have stabbed him. Though considering the death glare she had sent his way when he started horning in on Bruce, it is still a distinct possibility. Her jealousy is an interesting development; one he will puzzle over later had he more time for such things.
“Oh hey, what’s up?”
Tony pulls out a paper and some colored pencils. “You want to design a superhero to add to the Avengers?” he offers magnanimously. “I don’t usually let just anyone join,” he adds, playing if off like he doesn’t desperately want to play with the other boy, like he’s the one doing Steve a favor.
It escalates from there with Tiberius touching Antony for longer than he ought and describing his own sexual conquests in graphic detail under the guise of male bonding, until Tiberius abandons pretense altogether and kisses him under an cypress tree in the garden of his family’s villa.
“Or bisexual.”
It is a rarity, something that occurred in one in ten gladiators, if that, and as a result, their right-handed opponents often anticipated blows from the wrong side when matched up against someone who favored their left. It was a small but significant advantage in a profession where such miniscule differences were the difference between life and death. Ignatius wouldn’t even have to kill Stefanus outright. Should Stefanus lose his match, Hadrianus will order his death as editor, no matter how well the man fought.
even though it’s super lame and not a real weakness.” He pouts. “What’s his name anyway? Wing-head?” Perhaps they can be a matching set: shellhead and winghead.
“The old man always did have a soft spot for Steve.”
Dracula takes the interruption in stride. “It relates to my father’s accomplishments, and I’d rather not rest on his laurels, not when I have other names I earned in my day,” he tells him before turning to Steve. “You may call me The Impaler.”
“and I couldn’t risk it, losing you too. But maybe if you can’t accept me as I am, maybe I never had you in my corner to begin with.”
Two nights later, Rogers manages to shake his control and rally the Avengers to his side to destroy the Stark Energizer satellite holding the world in Purple Man’s thrall. Stark and he had finally created the perfect world – free of poverty, of war, of famine – and they couldn’t just sit back and enjoy it, the ingrates.
Julia mulls it over. “I am going to let you in on a little secret, something that I learned from my first two husbands,” she tells him. “A man who abuses you two times out of ten is still an abuser. That’s how they trick you. If he was bad eight times out of ten, how many people do you think would suffer his company?”
Tony doesn’t have to wait until the next mission to see Steve again. Though Cap had recently relocated from the Tower to DC to be closer to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, he still frequented the City for what he termed “team-building exercises.” If Tony didn’t know any better, he’d think the man enjoyed the open road a little too much.
Rhodey rubs his chin in consideration. “You think you could do it if your life depended on it?”
Antony does not care. Whereas he had been too afraid to free Stefanus earlier lest he lose him entirely, Bacchus had proven he would die for Stefanus, would give everything and anything in his power to ensure his safety, and for that alone, he deserved him.
“…Right,” Steve agrees.
Steve leads them in the direction opposite the bedrooms through the utility area then out into the emergency stairwell where they can have privacy.
Tony is incredulous. “You’ve had casual sex?” All this time, he had thought of Steve as innocent, a paragon of virtue, and–
He’ll iron out the details later. In the meantime…
“Speaking of the poor sod,” another retiarius interjects, leaning in between the two to address Bacchus. “The collegia retiairii is taking up a collection to get an inscription in his honor. Dominus will only commit to engraving the letters of his name, foregoing his many achievements in the arena, though I’m sure the cheap bastard profited handsomely from his deeds. His death alone would have fetched a pretty sum.”
Steve knows it doesn’t matter. Tony is single; he can do what(–or who–)ever he wants. So what if he made the beasts with two backs with someone else? Virginity is a social construct in that no one’s dick or vagina is important enough to change any aspect of another person’s identity. Tony is still Tony; he’s still the guy Steve had been sweet on for the past year…
Because really, a man like that should be courted. Hence: the flowers.
This chapter alternates POV between Tony and Steve.
Tony fumbles in the dark and picks up his flashlight from where it fell, again tapping it a few times to activate it. He aims it at the stone slab then at the side where he can clearly see how it had slotted into grooves carved into the wall. “Looks like we may have triggered one of the original seals that didn’t go off when they originally closed the tomb.”
“…Are you still hung up on the whole de-aging thing? There’s no shame in what happened,” Steve says as he jiggles the handle. The man isn’t one to pussyfoot around the issue at hand.
It’s not that Tony can’t drink alone – he often does – but he does enjoy company from time to time. Unfortunately, the pickings are slim on their voyage. Pepper refuses to imbibe while on assignment, so he is left with his reticent bunkmate.
“…Cap, you shouldn’t barge into a man’s private space. I’m not decent,” he says, just as his robotic assistant detaches the last piece of armor, leaving him in his black skin-tight undersuit. The suit leaves nothing to the imagination, including the slight bulge that had begun to form around his midsection. He doesn’t turn around, walking straight to the cabinet to retrieve a loose T-shirt and sweatpants.
Stark proves to be an utterly annoying and challenging (but enlightening) travel companion.
So Tony clarifies, “You were drooling over some girly magazine when I know you don’t really like that stuff.”
Taking one final deep breath, Tony taps his fingers against his thigh, checks his watch, and knocks on Steve’s door at exactly 6:00PM.
“Go dtachtar le d’anáil thú.” Is an Irish curse meaning “That you may choke on your breath.”
This chapter is from Steve’s POV.
Obi, his father’s personal valet, pops his head into the door. “Staius, my boy, your father is looking for you. We are about ready to depart for the cemetery. Hurry along now,” he says before exiting to attend to the final preparations.
Bruce is not nearly as amused. “…That’s terrible. Just awful. I hope you’re proud of yourself.”
“Up pup pup, Cap,” Tony holds up a finger to silence him before folding his arms over his chest. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
– and then you hang out with Bucky, Pinky, Dum Dum, and the others, and it’s all about boobs and kissing and whatever.”
Tony doesn’t let up, taking a half step forward in their dance step to take a closer look. “You don’t have delayed sunburn, do you? I haven’t looked into the biology of it, but that’s not a thing that can happen with the serum, right?”
“And a little discipline,” Steve finishes.
“Forgive my impertinence, Antony, but are we not shopping for cloth to be fashioned into a new toga?” Stefanus looks past him at the array of fabrics in a variety of hues. “That wool over there is quite nice,” he says, indicating a brilliant red with gold trim that would suit Antony’s olive complexion.
Morbus Gallicus: Syphillis
It’s times like these, when Stark is faced away to partially remove his helmet, that Steve remembers the Mandalorian is a living being of flesh and blood, instead of beskar and circuitry.
“You sure this isn’t Steve, the guy you’ve been in love with for years?”
“I bet he’s not the type to play nice with his toys.”
Left-handedness was looked down upon in Roman society, with the exception of gladiators. Left-handed gladiators were advertised as such and trained to fight right-handed gladiators who were used to anticipating and blocking moves executed in the opposite side than what a left-handed combatant would do. This generally gave left-handed gladiators an advantage in the arena.
It’s worth it to see Steve blush, because this – whatever this is – is one of the best dates he’s had in a while. That’s what makes the end of it so much harder. Usually, Tony would invite a potential hook-up back to his place for a drink, to test out their chemistry and willingness to spend the night, but he can’t because (A) he doesn’t drink anymore, and (B) this is Steve. Steve may have been interested. Once. But that time has long passed. Tony can’t risk their rekindled friendship over a–
just sounds silly now, so naturally that’s what Steve’s mouth decides to go with.
“Or the tooth fairy,” Tony continues, undeterred. “That’s a good one. What the fuck is she doing with all those teeth, huh? And we’re not supposed to be terrified of some lady who breaks into our homes to steal our excess bones?”
“I’m here about the ad.”
Tony knows enough to keep
Tony leaps over the back of the couch, dropping into the end seat next to Steve sitting in the middle. “Come on.
“Is it true, Antony? Did you let this man…” Hadrianus can’t even finish his inquiry, too ashamed to speak the words, to even look at Antony.
Steve licks his lips. “What about kissing?”
Stefanus taps his spoon on the edge of his bowl. “Well, it sounds ridiculous when you put it like that.”
“What
“Hm.”
“Antony… maybe this– this thing between us? I believe it has run its course.”
“And why can’t it be both?” Hadrianus places a hand on Antony’s shoulder, only for the man to shrug it off in anger. “You know I promised your mother on what was to be her deathbed that I would always take care of you, that I would do what’s best for you, and this is what’s best.”
“I– I would like that, if– if you know… the offer is still on the table?” Steve says. He steps aside – an invitation – and Tony walks right through, the door closing behind him with a click.
Tony can’t let him win, not in his very own lab on his home turf, and so he pulls at the sheet, trying to retrieve enough slack to lodge it under his person and roll into a burrito, divesting Cap of undeserved warmth, but he is unable to dislodge even an inch from the super-soldier’s firm grip. Frustrated, Tony pulls the sheet taut and nudges Cap, trying to gently get him to let go, but Cap only latches onto Tony himself, pulling him into a loose embrace.
Stefanus stiffens, and Antony knows immediately something is wrong. “What is it?”
“Tony, it’s– it’s not a lie,” Rogers says unprompted.
She hesitates, then brushes a stray lock of hair off Tony’s forehead, trying to tame the unruly strands. “Your father and I– we… no matter what happens, just remember we both love you very, very much, and nothing will ever change that.”
It becomes a thing.
Clint protests, “That doesn’t count. You need to pick someone. Look, I’m a reasonable guy. I’ll let you review tabloids from the last couple months to make your selection.”
“You want me to fuck you?” Stefanus asks, his voice raspy with desire, with wonder.
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve murmurs with a moan as he clasps onto Tony’s thighs for leverage and leans back, his sweaty body nearly clinging to Tony’s shirt. The friction bumps up against Tony’s chest plate, and Tony immediately pushes Steve forward, spilling him onto the bed as he slides in deep and silently prays Steve didn’t notice the anomaly. It was something he had been able to keep from Gialetta for months, but the minute she found out… he thrusts in a bit firmer, a touch too fast, his hand planted on the back of Steve’s neck to hold him down, hold him steady. Steve grunts and sucks in a breath, his hands clutching the sheets tightly as his body tenses and clenches around Tony’s dick.
Tony puts his hands on either side of Steve’s shoulders and pulls him forward just as he closes his eyes and leans in, too fast for him to think better of it. He briefly presses his lips to Steve’s then just as quickly pulls back, releasing Steve as he returns to his original position. Steve blushes. He holds his fingers to his lips, his eyes wide.
“I’ve been with several gladiators, but none so handsome as you, Stefanus,” Julia whispers, standing on her toes to kiss his cheek, inspiring a heated blush that he is sure Antony does not miss. She smells clean, like rosewater, as her breasts press softly against his side and she sighs, a soft feminine gasp. “You are intoxicating.”
Antony positively beams as he introduces his lady friend. “Ah Stefanus, this is Julia. She is a dear friend who I have known for a number of years…”
“I was thinking we could get dinner sometime.”
“Come on, Stevie. There’s no need to play dumb, not with me. A couple days ago, Stark was helping you study for your physics midterm, and then all of the sudden, his unicorn is nowhere to be seen,” Bucky continues with much aplomb. “And here I was thinking you’d never make a move. It was painful, you know, watching you struggle to so much as talk to the guy. I’m impressed, didn’t know you had it in you.”
“I wasn’t aware you had been appointed the Academy treasurer.”
Stark cants his head to the side before a certain understanding seems to alight his face. “Oh that. Yeah, sorry about waking you up. Steve overestimated and… well, sometimes he doesn’t know his own limits, but he’ll be alright. His bed on the other hand… what can I say? Casualty of his own hubris.” He takes a sip of coffee, entirely too nonchalant considering what he had revealed.
. “So yeah. Fuck you and fuck Captain America! I hope you never find that fucking asshole!”
“…I’m serious, Stefanus. If you have a chance to leave, even if it’s without me, you take it.”
“I know that!” Steve protests in such a way that Tony knows he didn’t.
“…What?” the clone sounds almost confused at the Jedi’s brazen approach.
“So uh… I got to know. Has he always been…”
Steve holds out his hand for a shake. “Truce?”
Oh. Right. During his brief stint as a child, Tony had made a note to himself to invent J.A.R.V.I.S. better next time. He should get on that. No time like the present. He saunters over to the nearest control panel, grabbing a Phillips-head off the workbench on the way.
Romulus bites his lip. “I do not presume to know everything about your… relationship.”
“What if she’s allergic to mint?”
The crowd roars around them, all vying for the attention of the editor, hoping to sway his decision one way or the other.
Steve is sitting in his room, staring at his hands when Tony knocks on his open door. He bears an entire pie cradled in one arm with a single fork sticking straight up from the middle to suggest the recommended serving size.
“What Tony’s trying to say is that the father could be anyone,” Clint interjects.
“I need you.”
Steve withdraws them immediately, but Tony’s cough doesn’t abate. It grows louder and fiercer, wracking his entire frame. Steve turns him around only to be pushed off by Tony.
Steve doesn’t back down. “You want to go, old man?”
Maybe tomorrow, Stark will invest in soundproofing if this is going to become a regular thing, or barring that, at least take it to his room further down the hall so Clint won’t have to hear them.
He pauses. “You sure, my boy? It was your father’s–”
Priscus frowns and raps him sharply on the back of the head. “And none of that, either. You sound like you’re talking around a dishcloth stuffed in your mouth.”
Later, they end up at their old diner, the one with the old-fashioned burgers and shakes and their signature apple pies. They talk about the movie, the genre of comedic horror in general and special effects in particular. Steve had been impressed with the undead army as well as the appearance of the Ash clone in the second act. Tony had been impressed with the clone alright, largely because it meant there were two Bruce Campbells, and he could think of a lot of different scenarios where that could come in handy.
“Because he was dating a friend who
“Right, because I pay for everything.”
“Yeah.” Steve laughs. “You know, I’ve always had a thing for brunettes.”
It was a good fight, and the crowd seems to agree when a prone Aemilius raises his forefinger in a bid for mercy, the demands to “Slay him!” drowned out by the cries to “Let him go!”
“And? A little danger never hurt anyone.”
“You’re so big, so fucking perfect.”
“And so humble.”
Steve’s brow twitches in annoyance. Why does he let Dum Dum talk him into these things? This is precisely why he abstained from games of chance and luck ever since the first half-dozen times he had cost himself and his compatriots an entire week’s wages on dice.
But she’s already turned heel. “I’m out.”
“What’s she like?”
a French name.”
“I can have the seamstress sew an outfit for you,” Antony had said.
for the structural integrity of his ass? The fuck?
Over the next three years, Tony makes new friends at MIT, but he always returns home to Steve. Then, shortly after Steve graduates high school, his mother dies and Tony purposely gets suspended from campus so he can come home and spend time with his oldest friend in his time of need.
“Oh yes,” the receptionist marks him off in the appointment book and hands him a stack of intake forms before indicating a comfortable green two-seater in the waiting room. “If you’d have a seat, the doctor will be with you shortly.”
Bacchus can’t quite meet Stefanus’s eye. “Yeah. And I’m sorry. I said what I said at the time because… because something terrible was about to happen, and you needed to believe there was a way out, that it could get better someday. I thought maybe you’d wise up on your own, but you weren’t born into this; you don’t know how it works, what free men are like.” There’s another moment of hesitation before Bacchus turns to face him, looking him directly in the eye. “I was a vernae, Stefanus. A vernae. I had no father, but my mother was a concubina at the villa, and my dominus was… Vernae are supposed to be cared for because our sires are usually free men of the house. But then Dominus married, and his new wife… she didn’t like my mother much. Or me. And so when the harvest was bad one year too many, she found a way to rid her villa of us both, but not by freeing us.”
When the secutor had first entered the arena, the silver sheen of his scaled armor almost blue in the sunlight and contrasted with the muted red of his loincloth, Antony had thought the man well-proportioned as is often the case with many in his occupation. The gladiators were the reason he dragged Romulus to the munera during Saturnalia. His friend knew the games were popular but didn’t quite grasp the appeal of bloodsport, finding the pastime base, a low diversion for the common man to distract him from crippling debt and the concentration of political power into the hands of the few, a weak panacea for the masses suffering a host of social ills. Romulus would rather concern himself with issues of policy and civic duty…
“If a Mandalorian removes their helmet in front of another living being, we are no longer permitted to wear it. No one is permitted to see our faces,” Stark recites. “This is the Way.”
He is about to tell Cap that this is a fluke, that it can’t happen again, when–
“In theory.”
Steve blindly reaches out, managing to grab Stark’s retreating forearm on the second try. “Stay,” he says, his voice scratchy and sleep-soft.
“They will forget within a matter of days,” Antony replies, pulling away, “especially after I do this.” He turns back to the crowd, holding his fist up for silence. It takes a while, for the cries to crest then abate until there is only a low rumbling of discontent.
“You planning to stop anytime soon?” Any taller and Tony might get a complex.
Steve freezes.
“Like charming 2012’s Sexiest Alpha Alive, Channing Tatum?” Clint inquires, only to be kicked by Nat. He turns to his fellow Avenger and best friend. “What? We all saw the pictures of last week’s charity shindig. He’s got to be what? Ten years younger than Tony.” Clint gives him a double thumbs up. “Good job on pulling Magic Mike, by the way. Respect.”
“I don’t want to be another one of your one-night-stands either.”
“It’s been a long time.”
“It gets better.”
“I’m not asking you.”
Steve slaps his hand down on the paper to halt its journey. “We shouldn’t involve a lady–”
“I’m not in love with Steve.”
What is Antony’s game? Will he choose the opposite should Stefanus disclose his true predilection or punish him if it is does not align with his own? There is a correct response in such questions even if the man will not make it clear.
And now Antony rises to get in his face. He will not suffer his father’s sanctimonious censure, not anymore. “You mean for yours. Why not be honest about your motivations for once? This isn’t for me but for you and your position in the Senate.”
“It’s expulsion.”
“Yes, and you were the best shepherd in the village.”
Tony smiles and cants his head to the side. “I happen to like your beard, but if you want to ditch it, then grow it out long enough and maybe Laura can show me how to knit you a scarf from the trimmings to keep your neck warm instead.”
“It’s about Mamma.” Tony plunks down his research, pushing it across the desk, desperate for his father to see, to
He breathes a sigh of relief. “That was a close one.”
It hits him the following morning as he looks down into the waste bin of his lab at the full blooms peeking through bloody mucus he had spent the last fifteen minutes hacking up.
“Go ahead,” Tony replies as he pulls on his pants.
“You’re right. It wouldn’t be,” Stark admits. “I thought that maybe… maybe if we could, then you’d see how good we can be together, and I’d get to keep you.”
“Perhaps if he knew of your condition…”
Tony had given him a wave and a small smile. “No, I’m a student here. The name’s Tony.”
Thor’s brows raise. “Midgardians are able to reproduce asexually, like the mighty aphid?”
“What? It’s only polite to ask, and if we’re sharing,” he looks past Steve at Bucky. “I call dibs on Steve as my sandwich buddy. No offense, but I don’t know where you’ve been.”
Tony’s fingers curl into claws then fists as he rests his forehead against the wall and schools his voice to something cold, detached. “What’s the matter? Don’t have the stomach for it?” he grumbles before musing, “You think a cattle prod will bring out the Hulk? I have a hypothesis, and Bruce doesn’t seem opposed to human experimentation, all things considered. You both seem to have that in common, though that doesn’t have to be the only thing you two have–”
“I will choose to ignore that. Let’s call it generosity of spirit,” Dr. Pym replies, his tone stern as he reiterates, “After school. My classroom.”
“…Thanks,” Steve deadpans.
Tony thinks of what Steve had said about Pepper and her ‘roommate’ and nods. “Now, if you could kindly step outside, Steve and I would like to get dressed for the day.” He starts to untie his belt. “Unless you’re here for the show.”
“Hey, porn is not as good a teacher as experience. Just remember to uh… wrap it up. STDs are no joke.”
And so Tony clasps Steve’s thin shoulders and tries to assure him. “We’ll always be friends, winghead.”
It’s not a certainty, he is well aware. Presently, they are hurtling towards Tython, towards possible allies and an uncertain future. They could use what time they have left mourning what could have been, worried about what is to come and what will be, or–
But the Mandalorian only holsters his blaster. “That’s not my mission. I wasn’t hired to take you out.”
Steve’s chest is as pink as his surroundings. “You’re insatiable.”
“Whoa.” Tony takes a step back, his hands up. “I’m trying real hard not to be insulted here, Steven.”
“…Seriously? That’s what you’re going with, huh?” Well, that explained the stars and stripes on his costume, but still. Tony points at the wings yet again. “So, are those like… baby bald-eagle wings or something?”
Luckily, he doesn’t have to find out. Not today.
“Are you alright back there?”
. Steve is pretty sure they all had to watch the same HR training video covering this exact scenario not six months prior. He was even forced to attend a refresher after the dissolution of his relationship with Jan as a precautionary measure to ensure he wouldn’t do anything drastic to Hank.
Rhodes affectionately drapes an arm around Tony. “Hey Tones, practice later?”
So he concedes, “Okay, Mamma,” and slides off the bed towards his room to don a clean button-up and sweater.
Steve rolls them over, locking his legs over his future father-in-law’s. “So it’s a yes?” Steve could die happy, but he’d rather live.
“That went better than expected,” Rhodey tells Steve, his shoulders relaxing.
“…Your dominus was a weak man.”
“He told me he loves me,” Stefanus admits, shocking Bacchus into silence. “And I think I might… I think perhaps I…”
Stark is silent at that, and Steve thinks that maybe he gets it, a supposition that is confirmed when Stark inquires, “This isn’t about your Jedi vow to forswear all attachments, is it?”
“Cap,” he calls out in greeting. “What are you doing skulking outside Director Fury’s office so bright and early? Looking to regale the man with tales of your exhilarating weekend of bingo and shuffleboard with your peers? Did Gladys give you a run for your money? I’m sure the old girl’s a wily one.”
In the morning, they will have an awkward talk over breakfast where each will dance around what this means for their friendship and whether they can be more to each other, but for now, they lie entangled in the dark, their hearts beating as one.
“As you know, it is an election year, and Quinquatria is near,” he insinuates.
Antony hesitates for a moment. “I think the… the second one.”
“Which is?”
“Yeah. About that.” Suddenly, there’s an explosion outside, and a bevy of shouting followed by gunfire. “I already called in the cavalry to this location. That would be S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Fury always loved making an entrance.”
“Doesn’t it get in the way?”
“And Ms. Sarah has a son who’s your age. Isn’t that nice, Tony? Why don’t you show him around your play room?”
“I said what I said.”
“Hey Dumbass.”
“Sure, let’s go with that.” It’s safer than the truth.
Romulus can only concede the point. “Favor him if you must, but be careful, Antony.”
Aemilius shakes his head and plants the novicus in place with his hands firm on his upper arms before stepping away. “The trident, boy,” he holds up his weapon in hopes his charge understands the motion if not the language. “More distance between you and your opponent. Dagger is a weapon of last resort, when you’re forced to stick them close,” he says, demonstrating the trident’s superior reach by tapping Suibne’s thigh with forked tip. “You don’t want them close.” He slides forward, fluidly hooking the trident behind the boy’s knee and knocking him to the ground.
“They’re stainless steel. Rust-proof and nonperishable. Home Depot used to sell them, and I can’t imagine they were the first things that flew off the shelves when the apocalypse hit.”
To the captain’s credit, his hands barely shake when he peels off his uniform, first pulling at his top before unbuckling his utility belt. Stark tries to avert his eyes when he reaches for his fly to undo the fasteners of his pants.
“All wet and loose, fucked out like a whore’s cunt.”
“The report claims it wasn’t a one-off, that it was an established pattern. They tracked down seventeen people – men and women – since your breakup with Jan.” It’s a question phrased as a statement.
“Do you have a heart in there at all?”
“Master Yoda’s people are compact but powerful. For his species, that kid is undersized at best, and you want to enroll him in
“So… when you say you love me, you mean like the way I love honeybear, right?” Because there’s no way Steve is
Steve bristles. “I have finished my training, and I was just about to undergo the final Jedi trials.” It’s not strictly the truth but close enough. Master Erskine had thought him prepared, even if Master Phillips had not.
Steve rounds a corner, stopping in his tracks.
“We could die tomorrow, the both of us, so tonight why not live?”
“On the contrary; I have been working tirelessly on your behalf, attending many a social function to persuade the influential paterfamilias to your side.” A simple ‘thank you’ wouldn’t be remiss.
“The golden rod is a very important find, culturally-speaking,” he insists. “On a completely-unrelated note, did you know that humanity has remained unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years. If you were to pluck a child of Ancient Egypt and raise him in today’s world, he would be virtually identical to modern man, with the same foibles and vulnerabilities, the same thought processes and… and
Rhodey clutches the edge of the sink and drops his head with a sigh.
“You know, I was thinking–”
They’re interrupted by Jarvis, who informs him, “Your father is waiting, Tony.”
“Come on… I know you want me.”
“Freedom is not practical.”
“You don’t even know how many Jedi are left,” Stark points out. “If you lot are smart, you’ll scatter. Disappear. It’s a large galaxy; you won’t be noticed or missed.”
“Steve-steve-steve,” Tony is panting. “I’m gonna… I’m–
“…Sorry to hear that,” Mr. Rogers says as he scratches the back of his neck. “So… when will I get to meet the client?”
“Of course I do. He’s my oldest friend.”
And so he sends Obi to hire an older female prostitute, someone to teach him the natural joys of active penetration and traditional masculinity.
“Make me.”
Tony shuts the lid of his trunk, turning to face her. “Just so you know, Pepper… not everything that happens has to make it onto the pages of Marvels.”
Antony waves off his concern. “What of him? I am in need of protection when I venture out same as you, and yet I do not cast doubt on the quality of the men you hire.”
“I understand you’re upset–” Steve begins.
Stark abruptly drops his helmet and turns around. Steve has his full attention now. He can feel Stark’s eyes boring into him even if he can’t see his face.
Stripped of his home, his clothes, his freedom, all Suibne has is his name, until Priscus takes that away from him as well shortly before he enrolls him as a novicus in his ludus.
The gravity of what was lost in the apocalypse, of what remained in its stead… it’s liable to drive a man insane.
“You haven’t been honest with me?” For a brief minute, Steve is afraid Stark is going to admit he was hired by the Republic, that he is actually going to have Steve arrested that very night, but he shakes off the notion as utterly ridiculous.
It’s an improvement, even if Tony does order a martini an hour and a half later.
“Nothing has happened.”
“It’s a little more complicated than that, patatino mio,” she replies, sweeping her hand across the blanket to smooth it out. “Your father will do what he thinks is right.”
“Yes.”
On the whole, Tony has a decidedly different process.
“No! I just– If you were in trouble, if anyone was in trouble like that, I would want to help,” Steve clarifies. “It’s not just you, but– but because it was you, I – I don’t know – I’ve always cared about you, and I was afraid that maybe someone had hurt you, was hurting you, and I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if I suspected what was going on and did nothing. Even if something was happening and I stopped it, I wouldn’t expect you to do anything. You wouldn’t have owed me anything.”
“Will it cover his whole head?”
He never said. In fact, he never talked about his personal life much at all.
“Yes.”
Finally, after what feels like hours later, Stefanus escorts him back to the villa. Antony attempts to make light conversation, but the man is stoic and much too focused on their surroundings, as if he expected attack at any moment. Antony supposes he can’t fault him for his heightened awareness – bodyguarding is supposedly his primary responsibility – but there is only so much Antony can do with one- or two-word answers to every avenue of conversation he attempts. Stefanus only manages to relax at the entrance of the Staius villa. He walks Antony up to the door of his bed chamber, but when he moves to stay outside, resolved to stand vigilant all night, Antony lights a lamp and beckons him closer.
Unnoticed, Tony nearly slips off the back of the couch before he manages to steady himself.
Tony drops into the seat across from Steve. “What was that about?”
Perhaps the fates themselves had frowned upon his actions and saw fit to punish Antony swiftly because at that moment, Hadrianus enters the courtyard. Antony hopes he is just passing through to the tablinum, but he stops in front of Antony, peering down at him until he is acknowledged.
“See, it’s housed outside his body, like a normal scepter,” Tony says in hushed tones, a touch triumphant.
“You know the rules.”
“I don’t know, Cap. You think he’ll be man enough to give me what I want.”
your health.”
Bucky shrugs. “I don’t know, man, and I wouldn’t think about it too hard. It’s only going to drive you crazy if you try to figure it out by recalling every minute detail of Stark’s whereabouts for the last two days.”
don’t want to have any regrets.”
“Just get us out of here!”
“The mission. I’d like you to take it more seriously,” Steve says, voice gruff but still more gentle than he had anticipated five minutes prior.
Cap is taken aback. “Nat!”
However, against expectation, the guy falls silent on the line, so much so that Tony thinks the call might have dropped. “Hey winghead, you still there?”
Steve breath shallows, his hand inching towards the lightsaber at his side.
To his credit, Master Phillips waits until the kid is inside the ship and mostly out of earshot before asking Master Erskine, “You’re not really thinking about training the kid, are you?”
Tony is fifteen and will be matriculating into MIT in the fall when he unloads on his father while drunk on the man’s stash.
“This is cause for celebration!” Thor had declared, squeezing Tony into a rib-bruising side-hug. “We will feast within the fortnight; I shall source a boar and mead aplenty for the event.”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Stark,” the stranger sticks out his hand for a shake. His wrists look delicate, thin enough for Tony to circumscribe its entirety with his thumb and pinky if he had the notion. “Steve Rogers,” he introduces himself.
“Isn’t it obvious?” and off go the pants along with his underwear. “My mouth gets me in lotsa trouble, that’s for sure, but I can also put it to real good use if you’re up for it.” Steve stands, naked as the day he is born as he advances on Tony. “Now, you sure you won’t be needin’ my help, Mr. Stark?”
“Any ideas?” Steve calls out to the only ally at his back.
Tony looks at his mostly empty glass. “I’m still working on this one. Perhaps if you get me a Coke instead…”
“I’m going to put these in some water. Want to come in for a minute?”
“Like being ‘eaten out’?” Clint adds, rather unhelpfully.
“…What?”
“Getting knocked up–”
That’s not a no.
“You think?”
Master Phillips had assured him.
Antony should have told him to fuck off, and had he been older and more self-assured, he would have, but at the time, he is sixteen and still much too conscious of the other man’s social capital. He holds out his hand for a shake of reconciliation. “Agreed.”
“It would– it would make me more secure,” Stefanus tries to explain. “Being a slave, not owning myself… it is uncomfortable for me, can you not understand? Would it really be so bad to do this one thing for me?” He simply cannot comprehend the source of Antony’s hesitation, how he could not understand Stefanus’s position. The life of a concubinus is precarious at best, but if he were free… he has no plans to leave Antony for as long as Antony wants him. Antony will lose nothing in the bargain, but Stefanus will gain a sense of security, of equality in not just their relationship but life in general.
“…golddigger…”
His father smacks him then, shutting Tony up. He seems almost surprised at himself, but Tony turns back, rubbing his burning cheek.
To his credit, Stark doesn’t sound nervous as he replies, “What can I say? I’ve built a lot into the old girl for speed. Part of the job.”
“Steve, watch out!”
Steve simply stares at him. “And what about you? A Mandalorian cannot remove his helmet in the presence of others. Isn’t it uncomfortable? Doesn’t it get hot in there?” This planet is tropical. Even Steve finds the environment sweltering in his Jedi robes, and yet the Mandalorian’s armor remains.
Steve seems to consider it, ultimately deciding that maybe Tony has a point. “How do we…”
“More like shell-head.”
They appear at the opposite end of the aisle, having run in from the direction of the back room. Sam has a large box under his arm. He had clearly forgotten to drop it in the alarm. “Everything okay?” he asks as they converge on Steve and Tony.
Well, not quite everybody.
“And when he broke the bed frame, he kept trying to bounce on the mattress until that was ruined as well. Talk about not knowing when to quit,” –a pause– “Obviously, I won that bet.”
in the market for a new bodyguard. I cannot be expected to wander about unaccompanied. I could be beset by thieves, murderers.”
Stark can posture all he wants, but Purple Man knows the truth.
“Ní hé sin m’ainm.” is Irish for “That’s not my name.”
Stefanus can almost see the vase on the table shattered and a shard in hand carving off the man’s sorry excuse for a pecker to stuff down his throat. Stefanus could strike this man down; he is more than capable. He could do it, perhaps even should do it – damn the consequences – but instead he crawls into himself and dreams of goats.
“It’s only twelve, and that one barely counts!” Tony protests. In fairness, he’d only asked her out twice, and the other times had just been failed attempts at flirting. “Besides, I think she has a thing for Sam,” he grumbles.
Steve squints in confusion. “PDA? Last night? What…”
“He really did know the old man best, and Mom… well, she always liked him. Always the charmer.” Mom must have liked that in a man. How else could Tony even begin to explain Howard’s appeal?
His mother pops into the study to collect Tony, but Tony tries to shrug her off, refusing to leave before his father understands the severity of the situation. “Mamma is coughing up flowers because she thinks you don’t love her, and if you leave again, she’ll die.”
H-O-W / A-R-E / Y-O-U / T-O-D-A-Y-? / B-E-T-T-E-R-? Steve carefully taps out.
Now the stranger looks surprised. “Jesus, are you… you’re serious, aren’t you? I was kidding about that.”
Chapter title is an ancient Roman saying meaning “The beginnings of all things are small.”
“…What’s that?” Tony says, his pitch unusually high. “How… what the..? Where did that come from?”
“Of course not. Everyone’s different.” Steve rolls in place, heel-toe then back again, before blurting out, “So, is it true you have super-hearing? To make up for…” he points at his own eyes, but probably realizing that either Tony can’t see him or that it’s rude to point out someone’s disability, he quickly drops the gesture. “Bucky – that’s my best friend, you know – he says that if you lose one sense, the others get even better.”
Bacchus hesitates before he speaks, his voice soft and full of unease. “I know you likely cannot understand me, but just know you will survive. Whatever happens is but for a spell; it will end, and you will return here, and no one will think less of you for it. Many– many of us…” he pauses, takes a breath. “There is a way. Sometimes… sometimes when it’s happening, you leave. You let your mind wander, but your body stays where it is because that’s all they want from you in the end, and if they send you out so others can do the same…” His eyes are downcast, not quite looking at Suibne. “Sometimes you can keep some of the earnings, sometimes they tip, and you can save it alongside your prize money, and one day you can buy your way out, okay? So… do what you must and survive, for one day we may be free.” He scratches at the ASPS on his right hand, purposely holding it up to Suibne’s face and covering it while repeating, “Free.”
“There’s always a next ‘last time.’”
“I’ll be fine, but you need to go.” Though Master Phillips is hobbled, he continues to fight, his lightsaber striking left and right and his open palm tossing mid-sized boulders at their enemies when he manages an opening. “What are you waiting for, son? Run!”
And so he can only agree.
“You will have to guard my body very closely, every night even, from within my bed chambers,” Antony clarifies. “You will be compensated handsomely, of course.”
“You can never have enough cup holders.” He hands him a stack of a dozen. “Go nuts.”
Stefanus can only gawp at the amount, but he doesn’t correct Antony as he passes the man the stated sum.
of all people.
“What… what did he look like? My master?”
“Because you’ve convinced yourself you want it.”
This is usually the part where Steve smiles in relief, imparts some well wishes, and (most-importantly) leaves, but instead he hovers at Tony’s bedside, his arms crossed, the expression on his face being one that Tony recognizes as a precursor to his disappointed-dad routine. “So… I met Ryan this morning,” he begins.
Steve sets off in the direction of the screams, breaking the tree line into a clearing so bright he reflexively brings up his arms and recoils at the light, but when his eyes adjust, he is horrified to see Bucky, his teeth grit, eyes closed, his neck warping and lengthening as his nose and mouth shrink and elongate into a snout that blackens into the dark beak of a swan. Five other swans surround him, clumsy in their forms, some tipped over onto the ground, their webbed feet kicking air, while others flap their wings inartfully, nearly toppling over in their haste. Maces and swords, a bow and even a small axe are strewn upon the ground, confirming the identities of these other fowl as his missing retinue.
“Do you think I asked for this?” Steve retorts. “Do you think I wanted to see everyone I ever cared about, everything I’ve ever known and loved dead and gone?”
“He sounds great, Tony. Real great.” Steve says, but his voice is subdued.
Eventually, inevitably, Steve and Tony grow up. Legos gives way to video games when the Starks buy the first Nintendo Famicom complete with all nine games. (Tony’s favorite is Mario Bros while Steve likes Donkey Kong.)
“Don’t do it, Stefanus. It is the path to ruin.”
Stark gurgles as blood falls from his neck at the seam of the helmet, a line of flesh that had previously been protected by now-shredded thick leather.
He looks to the editor’s box, expecting Hadrianus to deal the death sentence only to find that he is turned towards Antony, who rises and walks up to the balustrade until he is the one in the editor’s spot, his arm outstretched to pass judgement.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, but some people never let you forget.”
“What did you do?” he asks, the minute they’re alone in Antony’s bedchambers. “What did you do to Ignatius?”
“I appreciate your offer and agree to the terms.”
Dum Dum chuckles at that, but it falls flat. “Your parents are taking care of the arrangements, and he’s staying at the Mansion after, so… there’s that at least.”
Servilius’s eyes fall to Stefanus then drift to the amphora he carries, his brow lifting at depiction of Zeus and Ganymede on its side. He smirks, “Really, Staius? Valerius told me you were prancing about the city with my twin in tow, but I bare believed him. It seems I owe him an apology after all, though this spectacle is pathetic, even for you.”
“Gosh, it’s been so long… it’s hard to describe, you know. Not everything feels like something else.” Tony says, getting fidgety. He spies an ice cream cart on the other side of the park. “Hey so… ice cream? My treat.”
“…But we’re both boys.”
“For your mother,” Hadrianus agrees. It is a truce of sorts, and they manage to make it to their destination without the entire affair devolving into yet another argument.
But Steve is already concentrating on a solution, his fingers glancing the end of the screen as he closes his eyes and feels the faint life energy of the remaining tie fighters, their positioning, the fuel and fluids running through their ships, their… it’s not exactly anger but a form of emotional detachment mixed with the thrill of the chase. Steve feels it, feels them. Two are close together now, closing in on their location. He reaches out of his mind, takes a hold of them both and gives them a sharp tug towards the center. What follows is a flare up of heat and fire, the threads of his influence growing taut then suddenly slack.
“Tony, you can’t just hole up in your lab forever,” Steve tries to reason through the door. “You’ll get hungry eventually.”
“I thought you and Bacchus would be halfway to Britannia by now,” Antony tells him after they have exchanged banal pleasantries and recline in opposite settees, each with their cup of wine upon their individual side tables.
“Why the long face, honeybear? Someone stiff you on a job?” Stark calls out as he unclips and lowers himself from the safety harness to greet his friend. “No really, you look like your favorite hound just died.”
But mostly, he blames Howard.
“You should celebrate, Stefanus, for tonight we are alive when by all rights we should be dead,” Bacchus says as he pours another draught of wine into his clay cup. “If Pompeia is not to your liking, there are many other ladies willing to entertain the victors.” He follows Stefanus’s line of sight, settling on the half-naked youth across the room. “Or boys.”
“Don’t you ever shut up, Stark?”
“So… what was it like? The first time?” Jimmy still wants to know.
“Your gratitude is thanks enough.”
“Speaking of your father…”
He does not want to kiss
baby despite being stone-cold sober in the stark light of day.
“I think we both know why,
“That usually doesn’t apply to one’s honeymoon.” She reaches out, her thumb rubbing a circle in the space between Steve’s thumb and forefinger.
This chapter is from Steve’s POV and implies that Steve/Stefanus and Bucky/Bacchus were prostituted out at a young age, but there is nothing explicitly shown, and the main story starts with Steve meeting Tony when he is in his early twenties. These early experiences do affect how Steve relates to both Tony and Bucky. Again, there is no Stucky/Stuckony in this fic, but Steve is very close to Bucky (in the purely platonic sense), which causes friction in his relationship with Tony.
“I, um… I brought pie,” he says lamely. He steps halfway into the room, uncertain what to say, uncertain whether there is anything he should say, anything he can say. Steve’s mother, his only living relative, is dead. It’s much too soon, and it’s not fair, and there’s nothing Tony can do that will make it any better. “It’s really good pie.”
“I’d rather wear this armor than miss out on sex.”
“I’d love to, Tony.” Steve hesitates only a moment before his fingers weave between Tony’s gently interlacing their hands together as he looks at Tony’s face to gauge whether his actions are wanted. “It’s a date.”
Steve is wary but accepts. “Rogers. Steve Rogers.”
“Are you done?”
Suibne sits up gingerly, looking at Aemilius with murderous intent.
So, that will be never, according to Master Phillips.
They’re talking in circles with Stefanus unwilling to commit to a response one way or the other, much to Antony’s frustration.
The other guy glanced at Steve.  “I was talking to
They drove down the Las Vegas strip before Tony pulled into the circle drive of the Venetian.  Steve grabbed their bags while Tony tossed the keys to the valet.  Once in their suite, Tony shed his sunglasses and shoes, pouring himself a glass of the chilled San Pellegrino left out for them.  He offered one to Steve, who waved him away.  Steve walked out onto the balcony looking west out over the fountains in front of the Venetian, across the Boulevard towards the Mirage.
Tony didn’t even have to play up his relief and said, “That would be great.”
He came out of the bathroom to find Steve waiting.  He muttered an apology, which Steve sleepily waved off.  Tony slid into Bucky’s bed, and Steve turned off the gas light when he came back from the bathroom.  “Good night, Tony,” Steve offered, and Tony heard his bed shift as he got comfortable.
Captain America, I decided I’d rather get to know Tony myself instead of read what Shield thinks of him.”
About halfway through, Bucky returned, his hair wet and slicked back.  He went back into the bedroom and reappeared with a shave kit.  He grabbed the kettle and went into the bathroom, leaving the door open.  Tony could see him periodically glance up into the kitchen through the mirror as he washed his face with warm water then shaved with a straight razor.  Instead of hostility, however, Tony only saw curiosity in the reflection of Bucky’s eyes.
“How —?” Steve started, but he choked on a whimper that he was clearly trying very hard to suppress.  His shoulders shook as he cried silently for a moment.  “How can she be gone?” he managed to get out after a long time.
Steve blinked at her.  “Why would I?” he answered finally.  His shoulders slumped, and he looked around at the neighborhood, the green leaves fluttering in the breeze with the red brick buildings behind them, as though it would offer some further explanation.  “I mean, you have these phones that can answer all of your questions — and you can watch baseball on TV if you can’t afford the tickets — and food that’s cheaper, lasts longer, and is easier to make — and antibiotics and vaccines so people like me — I mean, how I used to be — people like me don’t die from infections.”  He paused, still breathing heavily, before adding, “You can treat TB.”
