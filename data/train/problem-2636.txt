A broken “Cas” passes his lips and suddenly he's running and throwing his arms around him, no thought to how on earth this could be possible. Cas hugs back and he’s solid and real and there and suddenly there is nothing that could have stopped the tears and the pure unadulterated joy. At that moment you could have told him Lucifer came back and was planning apocalypse part three and he wouldn’t have cared.
The empty pleads with the desperately, saying she had an alibi for the night of Wes’s murder. Dean is cursing himself for letting his guard down but suddenly he cannot help but hope, hope that for once he could catch a small bit of respite. He checks the alibi and was pleased to see that it checked out, even though he couldn’t show that to Sammy or Jack. His facade had already begun to crack, and any more he was sure that they would begin to see the absolute degradation of everything he had built up to protect himself. Sam decides to go chase after the suspect, Jack is off doing who-knows-what, and Dean is alone with Mia. He decides to jump on his chance and asks her to come to the other room. Fear is evident on her face but she follows him to the other room.
No. No way. He leaps to his feet at once with his eyes flying open. He lets go of the cup and water sprays the floor as his hands shoot to his mouth. He can feel tears springing to his eyes but he's far too distracted to care, to blink them back in panic. He feels his Heart drop out of his chest because suddenly Cas is standing there, looking for all the world like he never left. A soft smile graces his face and the hint of tears start to fall from his eyes.
Dean’s hands curl into fists and he squeezes his eyes shut as he forces his lips into a firm pressed line.
“It isn’t Jack’s fault I died. Treating him poorly, taking your anger out on him? I can see that you’re hurting, but that isn’t what I wanted. Honor my sacrifice, help Jack.”
She asks him if he thinks “this shrink stuff” is a load of crap and he can’t say anything because of Sam and Jack sitting next to him but he can tell that she reads him immediately. Sam dares to say that he’s the one not processing his grief well. He tries to feel anger, to feel sadness, to feel something, but instead, he feels faintly annoyed and just flatly denies it. They fight for a few more minutes until Sam storms off in the other direction.
The realization was both earth-shattering, and still somehow the most obvious thing he had ever thought. Somehow everything had always been leading here, to this epiphany.
Leaping to his feet, he hurls the unfinished bottle down. Shards of glass spray everywhere and liquid splashes back at him, getting on his bed. In desperation he punches the wall, but the bunker ended up just getting his knuckles bloody instead. Promising himself he’ll clean it up in the morning he walks down the hall to get another bottle and sits on his bed to drink until he’s comatose.
In a few years he and Sam will die. Probably bloody, probably on a hunt. He and Sam will be remembered by the hunters, sure. But in a few years everyone won’t be able to remember what was true and what was false. They will fade into ghost stories. And in time, those will fade too. People will move on. That thought rings in his head like a bell, and he can feel himself spiraling deeper and deeper.
The absolute last thing that Dean wants to do is talk to Sam. He feels, above everything that had been numbed back, annoyed. After everything that's happened he deserves to no longer have to constantly be worried about Sam. He should be able to process his emotional trauma freely without being worried about what Sam feels or what Sam needs. He knows that’s not fair, that Sam wants to help. But he can’t help it.
Cas looked at him inquisitively, doing that head tilt that he always does and a rush of joy swarms Dean so powerfully the room starts to spin and he almost has to sit back down. He was ready to confess everything he had kept locked up in the fucknope mind warehouse in one fell swoop.
“Cas…’’ and the raw emotion in his voice shocked him, “I used to not believe in anything I couldn’t see. Not angels, not god… you showed me there was more out there. Hell, before you I had never had anyone stick with me like you did. You showed me I deserved to have people care about me… Oh now I’m rambling…” Dean chuckles through his tears and takes a deep shuddering breath. “ What I’m trying to say is, you’re it for me buddy. I need you, sure, but I love you. In every way imaginable I love you”
“Come on, Castiel! Wouldn’t you rather be a fond memory than a constant, festering disappointment?” The empty says with disdain. Castiel feels his heart clench. He can’t think about that. He has to get back, has to set things right.
Cas begins to explain what happened but Dean can't process a single word of it, his mind ringing with a thousand things he needs to say.
Suddenly Jack walks in and Dean stabilizes himself and wipes his tears immediately.  He walks over to him when abruptly Jack picks up a fire iron and swings it across his head. He loses consciousness, with the last thing he remembers being Cas yelling.
Hey guys! So I worked on this a lot today instead of doing my schoolwork so I hope you enjoy! Be ready for a ton of angst lol. Again, this is my first ever work so please don't be too mean, but I would LOVE some constructive criticism!
He had been bit, punched, stabbed, kicked, thrown across rooms, hell he had had his organs ripped out by hell hounds, and yet somehow this was the worst pain he had ever felt.
“Look uh…” and suddenly he is hesitant, but something visceral inside him tells him he needs to do this, to finally accept what he feels.
Dean can feel Sam handling him with kid gloves. He can feel the pity coming off of him in waves, with Sam getting increasingly more worried each time Dean doesn’t take the beer or jump at the fake name he usually preferred. He doesn’t care. Let Sam be extra nice to him for a few days, it doesn’t change the fact that Dean had FINALLY figured out that he was in love with Cas and he had missed his chance forever.
And then it hits him again. Cas is gone. No god to bring him back this time. No more second chances, no more do-overs, he just has to accept that he had his chance and lost it forever.
The empty protests but he doesn’t waver, spitting “Release me. Release… me.” from his mouth like a curse.
She asks if he journals and he sneers because the vice around his heart and the lump in his throat won’t go away if he writes about it. It won’t change the fact that he’s utterly and completely alone.
She looks at him with pain in her eyes and says softly “Dean” and suddenly the fight drains out of him and he feels the weight of all the hours of missed sleep all at once. He sits dejectedly down on the nearby sofa, leans his head back, shuts his eyes, and sighs. ‘’Alright. Shoot. I’ll bite”
They were suddenly less than six inches apart. Dean can hear Cas breathing, and he feels himself falling, falling so deeply in love with this weird, dorky little angel of the lord, that he can’t imagine not living the apple pie life with him.
Of course, he knew it was their type of thing once he saw that the two dead people had their hearts ripped out. Awesome. Probably just werewolves, but he still guessed he should handle it.
When Cas woke up, it was half past two. He hadn't needed to sleep, of course- he was still an angel. However, he thought it best to put his mind at rest after… after he and Dean…
It took him about 45 minutes to find an abandoned car. It was a Ford- a rusty mid 90s beater. Inconspicuous. He accessed his receding Grace, and used as much as he could to unlock the door. By some miracle, he managed to start the car, after three "come on"s and the engine turning over quite a few times. Now, he looked at the map of the United States. Where would the Winchesters think he would go? He was in the center of the country, so anywhere was fair game. He figured that they would think he went as far as possible.
The last missing victim had been a man in his late thirties, Tyrone Hallward. He had 2 children, and a wife, Doria. If he was going to go for any of them, it'd probably be his wife.
There was one missing victim hadn't gone after a family member yet. And, the other two could strike again.
Besides from an idea of where he was, Castiel needed a car. He'd always had to use his Grace, considering he didn't know how to hot-wire a car. The problem was he didn't know if he even had enough Grace left.
"Cas," Dean gasped, fear building in his stomach. This was exactly what he was afraid of after Jack came back. This could not be happening.
Sam didn't really realize it before, but he could see now how much his brother loved Castiel. He wasn't dumb, he could tell there was something between them that was different from between him and Cas, but… damn.
He checked into the local motel. By the time he got settled, it was roughly 3:40 AM. Dean showered, ate the burger he'd picked up at the drive-thru, and brushed his teeth. He decided he might as well try praying to Cas again, as he'd done the past two nights.
There was no turning back now. "In exchange for bringing him back, I told the Empty to take me. But, it told me it would wait to do so." He pulled off the band-aid. Cas simply could not avoid it forever.
The two brothers made eye contact. Dean wasn't sure how, but he felt like Sam already knew, deep down. Maybe he was just drunk.
Sam remained in his own room, so far. Doing what, Dean wasn't sure. He didn't know if Sam knew Cas had even left, yet.
Dean's eyes then panickedly searched for some way to escape this situation. His razor sharp fight or flight instinct was kicking in.
They sat for a few more minutes, quietly drinking. Cas didn't know if he should say anything else. Before he could, Dean spoke up again.
"Cas, spare me the "it's not you, it's me" thing, please. I get it. It was my fault for putting myself out there, right?" He started to head for his room, planning on drinking himself comatose for about 5 years. Or maybe forever.
"Actually, your partner said yesterday that he'd be back this morning, at 8. And, well, he never showed up. Sorry that I forgot, I wrote it down-"
"2 dead, 3 missing in series of bizarre serial killings in Bushnell" it was titled. Hmm, definitely sounded interesting.
Cas leans in, presses a gentle kiss to the spot just above his Adam’s apple, breathing it in. “This is where my grace would go,” he says simply. Cas reaches his free hand to take Dean’s, placing it gently on the spot, letting him feel it. “Right there. Can you imagine that? My grace, running through you. Me, trusting you to hold it, keep it safe just as I would keep you.”
Castiel takes a step forward, those searchlight eyes trained on his chest like he can see right through the shirt. Maybe he can.
“When I remade your body, stitched together the wounds and the scar tissue and made a home for you there,” he continues, his gaze solidly fixed on Dean’s. His hand resting between the twin scars under his pecs where Castiel’s grace had stitched his skin flat, just as Dean had always ached for it to be. Dean swallows, his jaw working in that way it does when he wants to say something but his mind won’t let him heave his heart into his throat. “I considered, briefly, not seeking a vessel on Earth but rather taking this body crafted by an angel and making it into a home for me, too.”
Much like a film Castiel has often come across while channel surfing, their little family is made up of three men and a baby– in relative terms, four years old is a baby even when that four year old appears to be thirteen, he supposes.
Cas’ brow furrows, but he says nothing as Sam takes Dean’s place at the table. Sam shoots him a questioning look, but Castiel shakes his head, sipping his (now slightly cold) coffee.
Castiel takes another step, then another, until he’s standing across from Dean in the aisle between the beds. Casually, like there’s nothing weird about his presence here, Cas sits down on Sam’s bed, still staring up at Dean.
He says more, rolling back to stare at the ceiling as he lists off details of how he would treat Dean the way he deserved to be treated as a vessel, as a friend, as a lover and a partner and an equal, but then Dean interrupts with, “Cas, I–” His voice is rough, thick with scarcely concealed emotion.
Jack cocks his head, reminding him terribly of himself. “Dean didn’t always think of himself as a man?”
Castiel sometimes forgets how sharp Jack is, and combining that intelligence with a nephil’s powers – even without being God to boost them – and the meddling nature of a middle schooler is always a recipe for disaster.
Dean nods, clearly uncomfortable but powering through it for Jack’s sake. That child really did change Dean, Castiel thinks. The start of their relationship may have been fraught to say the least, and there may be things that all of them will have to work through in the future – things that Castiel will never forgive, no matter how deeply he loves this man – but Dean is truly trying now. That gives Castiel hope, at least.
“Alright,” Castiel agrees. He can never say no to this child, something he worries about slightly for when he’s older. “Just remember–”
“Oh, hey,” Sam says after a few awkward moments. “I’m going to Eileen’s tomorrow, can you guys get Jack to school?”
Castiel considers how to phrase this. “Identity. I don’t know that I would consider ‘angel’ a major trait of mine, not anymore.”
Just as he knew he would, Dean glances away from Cas’ face, suddenly very interested in the kitchen’s doorway. A faint blush spreads on his cheeks, and Castiel wants.
“Yeah,” Dean says after a moment. “I guess I do. You were right, earlier, on why I don’t talk about it much. Well, that, and I don’t really think it’s anybody’s business, you know? I’m Dean freaking Winchester, no one needs to know I wasn’t always him. But I’m proud of my scars. Hell, they’re about the only ones I got by choice.”
Castiel opens his mouth to answer, but stops when he hears the telltale heavy footsteps of Sam approaching from the library. Cas isn’t sure if this is a conversation Dean wants to have with company.
Of all the ways this day could have gone, Dean hadn’t expected to end it teaching an angel about his gender experiences in a shitty motel room. But what’s his life if not unpredictable?
In Castiel’s very, very long life, the day he pulled the Righteous Man from the pit and declared him saved is one that trumps nearly any other. Advising kings or watching nature evolve over millennia pales in comparison to the brilliance of Dean’s soul – angels cannot taste, not like humans, but when Castiel pulled the soul into his wheels for safekeeping as he flew
“Identity,” Castiel finishes for him, pressing the side of his thigh to Dean’s under the table in what he hopes is a supportive gesture. “I didn’t always think of myself as a man, but now I do. It rings true with some of…” He sneaks a glance at Dean, who gives him one of his more subtle Looks: go ahead. “Dean’s experiences.”
Alarms blare in Dean’s mind. You don’t grow up a Hunter without learning to trust your instincts, and Hunters like him know that more than anything.
Dean’s never cared for God, never given two shits about what some voyeur in the clouds or his followers on Earth thought of him. He’s felt like less of a man for it, sure, and he’s felt unsafe at times because of it, but God? Who needs his approval?
Cas says after a few seconds have passed. Dean shakes his head. He doesn’t seem to be panicking, but even though Cas knows Dean remarkably well, it can still be difficult to read him. Especially without his grace to guide him.
Dean stops his stuttering, just staring at Cas. Or at his vessel, anyway, who apparently is a guy like Dean. Does that make Cas like him, too?
“For the war?” Dean asks, because what he’s hearing is that Castiel just showed up because he missed him.
Cas was telling the truth: Two horizontal scars stretch under his pecs, each with a perpendicular scar reaching up to end at his nipple. Slightly different incision technique than Dean went with, but the meaning is the same. Dean bites down the urge to touch it.
Seeing Dean like this makes Cas feel positively reverent. Is this what it’s like to know God? The good God, the mythical God Cas had believed in so long ago? What was it Rowena had said to him that once – that he was
“Well, I couldn’t comprehend love, but hunger? Still unfamiliar, but infinitely easier to process. I didn’t know I loved you, so I wanted to eat you.”
This, Castiel is certain, is something Dean will understand even more than fatherhood, even if it’s not something he readily shares. Cas knows, though, of course he does; he rebuilt Dean’s body and kept exactly two scars.
“Well,” Cas continues, and he may not have thought about this specific fantasy in years, but it’s still just as vivid as it was before he Fell. He lays on his back, pressing his side into Dean’s, staring up at the fan on the ceiling, his hand snaking up under the pillows to toy with Dean’s hair. “I would never lock you away like Michael did. I would let you share my eyes,
Castiel shifts, looking away from Dean for the first time since he arrived. “There isn’t any news on the war for the seals, and we have no new work for you.” Dean raises an eyebrow. “But I wanted– it would be good to talk to you. To understand more about the man Heaven has taken such an interest in.”
“Mh?” comes Dean’s response. He’s still out of it from their earlier activities, turned boneless and sluggish under Cas’ care. In a moment of self-indulgence, Cas allows his newly human heart to sing out in praise of Dean Winchester, Righteous Man, where he lays in Cas’ bed. Their bed. He thinks he’ll never get used to this.
He pauses again, hovering in the doorway, looking almost unsure. It’s a weird look on Cas, inhuman, powerful, soldier-of-God Castiel.
Dean’s face gets that Look, the one he has when he’s not quite understanding. Cas continues, “Even when I did, there were other parts of myself that felt more important.”
“You know,” Cas mutters into Dean’s bare skin. “When I was still… an angel, I used to dream that I would take you as my vessel.”
Castiel takes a deep breath (do angels need to breathe?) before answering, “No, but when I… consider it, I wonder if it wasn’t part of my Father’s plan. To speak to a man like you in a body you might recognize on some level.” He pauses, and Dean considers that. “And,” he says, quietly, “Of all the vessels I’ve taken, I’ve never felt such a strong connection to one’s experiences.”
Great, so he’s being babysat by an angel of the fucking Lord, and he’s not even given a fair warning to put a shirt on.
Cas knows the way Dean was treated by Michael. Watched him in the weeks during and after, saw how desperate he was for his mind and body to remain his own. Even a full decade before, Cas never would have violated Dean like that. No, he would treat Dean’s body with the kindness it deserved. Treat Dean with the kindness he deserves. He says as much, and Dean shudders under him, his eyes drifting shut for just a moment.
“When’s dinner?” Sam asks as he enters the kitchen, eyes landing on Dean and then Castiel, gears turning. “Am I interrupting?” As always with him when he catches the two of them together in these last few months, there’s a hint of smugness under even the most innocuous questions. Once a younger brother, always a younger brother.
Cas nods, leaning in to press his lips against the sensitive skin just above Dean’s collarbone. He breathes him in, lets the human sensation wash over him, relishing in it. After a moment, he nods again, his nose nestled into the crook of his neck.
“At the time, I didn’t know it. I was – Well, you remember,” Cas mutters with a smile. Under him, he feels Dean chuckle.
Cas doesn’t know what’s gotten into him, why he’s saying these things that have lived in him for over a decade – an amount of time that seems so much more significant now that he’s human – but it feels good, letting it out. The way Dean’s blushing is hardly something to complain about, either.
“It was a selfish desire, but even then – as devoted a follower as I was of Heaven’s orders – I wanted to keep you safely tucked away in the recesses of my true form.”
The Castiel in front of him couldn’t be further from the angel he confronted in the barn, months ago now. This Castiel isn’t human, but he could be.
He presses worship into Dean’s skin, asking for nothing but to have his praise be received. Dean, never one to admit defeat, lets him, even when the whispered prayers make his face hot and tomato-red. Minutes pass, Cas thinks, maybe hours; it’s hard to tell in the bunker, cut off from the sun. It hardly matters. What matters is the man under him, the man Cas sometimes aches to devour still, albeit in a different sense. When they’ve tired themselves out and there remains nothing to be said – at least for now – they hold each other in silence, an unspoken decision to sleep.
In all his years observing humanity, he’d seen similar stories play out on Earth as it so rarely was in Heaven: children growing into adults, learning that they prefer one gender over another, discovering that their parents' plans for them don’t fit who they truly are, bringing in a little bit of Creation into their lives as they mold their bodies to suit them. Is that not what he did? Even before he was well and truly mortal, he was allowing himself to visibly age, skin sagging and hair graying.
“From what I understand,” Castiel says. “Transgender people can look like anyone. That’s something of a fallacy.”
eyes, hear what I hear – save for angel radio, I’m afraid that wouldn’t go over well with a human mind – and when you wanted control, I would give it to you. I would keep your body safe, heal it automatically after a battle just as mine did when I was an angel. You wouldn’t be able to sneak off and get yourself hurt. I would always be there to heal you.”
“Yeah, but sit down; dinner’ll be ready in a few.” He pats the table and gets up, checking on the oven; much to Sam’s delight, Dean has finally decided to try making veggie burgers from scratch.
Turning and grabbing a towel to wipe his (mostly clean) hands, Dean sees Castiel standing in the doorway of the dingy motel bathroom, the dim light of the room making the angel seem to almost glow. Maybe he does, Dean’s not sure. It’s hard to tell with angels.
Jack looks at him from across the table, hurriedly chewing the first bite of his burger to answer. Something flutters in Cas’ chest seeing how truly small his son is. Not quite a child, not yet an adult, but always, always his. Castiel catches Dean’s grin out of the corner of his eye before he reminds him not to choke; the kid may be immortal, but nobody wants a hunk of burger stuck in their throat.
“I’m just your friendly neighborhood cosmic entity” replies the mystery being in an accent that has Castiel even more on edge.
Deans’ gun is raised in an instant and he’s cursing himself for believing for one goddamn second that he caught a break. He had gotten naive, thinking that the eviscerating pain he had felt would be anything other than a constant for the rest of his life. The shifter claims, of course, that she’s innocent, but the illusion is already shattered. Dean hears her say that she attempts to help her patients by enabling them to speak to the person they love one last time, and suddenly he knows that he needs to talk to her as Cas needs it to keep going and keep fighting.
Dean burned so brightly, saving so many lives, stopping the apocalypse. Somewhere deep inside himself he can admit that what he did mattered. But he can’t  find it within himself to care. From the time he was thrust headlong into this crazy world of monsters and demons  he never dreamed, never dared hope that one day he would be able to find someone who could handle the life. For the longest time Dean didn’t believe in anything except his own abilities, and Cas changed that for him. Over the time he had known Cas, he had allowed himself to naively think that he would always be around. Cas’s constant presence had lulled him into a false sense of security, he had been there for so long Dean began to believe he would always be there. Stupidly he began to need him, deluding himself into thinking that he deserved to feel happy. Once again, that had been ripped away from him. He sees no future anymore.
“Just let’s lay down. Let’s just try and sleep. Hmm? Think about it. Infinite peace, yes? No regrets. No pain. Kiddo, save yourself.’’ And Castiel feels tired and ashamed and angry, sure. He momentarily feels tempted to just go right back to sleep, feels the empty’s pull tugging at his consciousness. But there’s something else there suddenly and that’s pure drive. The kind one only gets when they believe in a cause fully and without reserve. The kind one gets when they will lay down their life without hesitation because they lack some fundamental regard for their safety.
The next couple of days start to blur together. Sam goes for runs and cooks kale and tries to talk to Dean. Dean drinks and watches westerns and avoids Sam and Jack. As they fall into this destructive pattern a layer of fog begins to surround his thoughts. A few days later, after he started to run out of movies to rewatch and he feels like he’s about to burst, he stays up late to find a case he thinks Sam will agree to. He tells himself that this will be good, he needs to get his mind off of things, even though the idea of being stuck in a car with Jack right now makes him want to hurl another bottle of whiskey at the wall. He is hoping desperately that Sam will want to stay behind and help Jack, even though the idea of being alone right now makes him have to take another swig of whiskey.
The Empty talks for a few more seconds, explaining who and what he is. Peripherally, Cas is aware that the empty mentioned every angel that ever died was there. He knows he should want to bring them back, and curses himself that that isn’t a priority. He unfortunately is only able to formulate something along the lines of DeanDeanDean. Cas isn’t stupid. He’s been on earth for a while now and he knows he looks at Dean the way he’s only supposed to look at girls. The way Dean only looks at girls. However, not only does he not think Dean is interested, every single time he has seen a human and an Angel fall in love it has ended poorly, most often for the human. He doesn’t want that for Dean, doesn’t think he would be able to keep going if one day Dean were to be taken back to hell and he was unable to help him because he had fallen completely. It had been bad enough when Dean had been stuck in that prison, praying to him nightly, and Cas hadn’t been able to help him. Cas isn’t sure he could take another failure.
Dean’s mouth falls open in surprise, certainly this wasn’t the way he was expecting this conversation to go.
The empty asks him then why he’s awake and hope springs out of the crippling fear. He is instantly positive that the Winchesters got away and are fighting tooth and nail to get him out right now. It is clear to him that that thought shouldn’t delight him, shouldn’t make him feel so incredibly elated that he can’t focus on what the empty is saying. Castiel can’t find it in him to care, heart singing with cries of Dean’s alive and Dean cares about me. The spelling of G-O-D snaps him right back to where he is, and suddenly the fear starts to set in again. The urgency to get back is strong, but this entity before him is on par with GOD. He isn’t sure what happened to wake him up, but it was most likely the Winchesters or Dean. He doesn’t want to bring this wrath on them when all he ever wanted was for them to be safe. He must handle this situation with the utmost care.
They get in the car wordlessly, with the wait of their failure dampening any possible words that could be said. Dean drives, and the silence is palpable. There is so much that needs to be said, but neither of them had the heart to say it. Suddenly the sounds of Dean’s phone slices through the tension like a knife, and Dean answers it hopelessly.
He can’t speak, can barely move, so he shakes his head enthusiastically. He whispers “always have, always will”
Tears start to well up in his eyes and he scoffs ‘“Look at me, crying like a twelve-year-old girl… Well you know us hunters don’t have a long life expectancy. We keep fighting because we believe in the cause. Hell, me and Sammy,  We’ve had the hits coming since we were born. But recently it’s like no matter what I do I'm drowning in threats and the fights are way above my pay grade. So many people I care about, people I never got to love the way I wanted to love, they’re just gone and there is nothing I can do about it. I’ve lost people before, but I just don’t think I can come back from this one.”
Cas had trusted Jack, and he had ended up stabbed in the back with an angel blade. The lump in his throat returns and he has to swallow deep and blink rapidly in order to keep from devolving completely. He pulls into the bunker, unlocks the door, and heads straight for the whiskey. Being careful not to make too much noise he carries it down the hall to his room, his hands start to shake when he passes the room that he knows Jack is sitting in awake. He knows at some fundamental level that he’s blaming Jack for something he had no control over, but that doesn’t help when he goes to call Cas and he has to force himself to put his phone back down. Whether it’s Jack’s fault or not, that doesn’t change the fact that Cas is gone and he isn’t coming back.
Mia looked at him pensively for a moment. “Dean, why do you think you are having such a different reaction to the death of Cas than Sam is? I’ll admit I don’t know many of the details but it almost seems like you’re not only more upset about Cas than your mother, it is to a degree that Sam is surprised.
It isn’t that the thought had never crossed his mind. Hell, he had been appreciating Cas’s holy tax accountant vessel since the day they met. But the world had been ending, and then the war in heaven, and then Cas had died, and then in Purgatory he had thought maybe… maybe something might have happened. But as soon as they got back the problems just started right back up and didn’t stop. And besides. He Isn’t gay.
Dean feels ringing in his ears and the tears are flowing freely now. His heart is beating uncontrollably and he feels woozy and feverish.
Cas … no Mia tentatively hugged him and he clung back with the full force his exhausted body could muster. The sleep loss was suddenly pressingly evident to him, and he had to hold onto Cas/Mia to keep from falling over.
Cas tilted his head and lowered his eyebrows inquisitively. “Thank you Dean. That really means a lot. I missed you two so much-”
He sits down and tries for the millionth time to pray to Cas, steeling his shaking hands by desperately clutching his knees
Sam prods at him, and he feels something snap. Suddenly he needs to share, maybe not the full story, no he’s not ready to THINK about his love for Cas, let alone talk about it. But he needs to say something, anything.
“First I want to congratulate you on taking this step. It shows huge growth that you would be willing to talk to me, and that shows that somewhere deep down you want to get better.”
“Dean, you forget that I can read your angels' memories, although many of his thoughts are hidden from me. The first time he saw your soul his fate was sealed. I can see Castiel giving armies for you. I can see him choosing to rebel against heaven, to fall for you. He would follow you anywhere without a thought, throw away his safety for yours without hesitation. You're it for him. This runs deeper than any friendship I've ever seen. I think for you to accept Castiel being gone, you need to accept what he meant to you in the first place.
It isn’t that he can’t see Sam’s exasperation and pleading looks. It isn’t that he can’t see Jack’s puppy dog eyes and desperate effort to impress him. He feels bile rise in his throat and his fists tighten when Sam says that he’s starting to sound like dad after he yells at Jack. It’s just that every time he decides he pushed the line, every time he thinks that order might have been too harsh, some little nagging voice in the back of his head keeps yelling that it’s Jack’s fault that Cas is gone and goddamnit someone deserves to suffer.
He tells himself he left that behind when he was 16 and John had found him in a motel closet with a boy from school. John hadn’t said anything to Dean for weeks and Dean had almost managed to delude himself into thinking that he was in the clear. But two weeks later on Dean’s birthday, John had burst in with a gaping smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. Dean remembers the absolute sinking in his stomach as he learned what the case was. That case was one of the hardest of his entire life, being forced to kill those lesbian nuns. Since then he forced it not to cross his mind, sealing up anything potentially gay and locking it deep in the fuck nope box he sealed with police tape and never went near.
“Well… Me and Cas have always had a more profound bond… he pulled me out of hell… and to be honest, neither of us got to know mom all that well... Hey wait a minute, what does that have to do with anything?” He asks, knitting his eyebrows together.
The weight of this slammed into him and suddenly he had to sit down. Sobs wracked through his body and he felt the urge to vomit.
“I was wondering… why it was so much harder to see you die then anyone else we’ve lost. Man, I was broken, absolutely wrecked. I was ready to throw in the towel and just end it all on a milk run hunt. You were gone, and looking at Jack just felt like a sick joke, like he was mocking us for all that we’ve lost. But now… by some miracle you're back, and I cannot do that again. I just can’t”
They pull apart and just hug, and Dean wishes the moment would never end. He knows now that there is a future for him, and it's as much of this as he can possibly get. Tears are still streaming down his face, but this time it is happy tears. He and Castiel may be broken, may have caused more trauma than anyone should ever have to see, but if there’s one thing that had never bothered Cas before it had been Dean’s faults. They are going to put each other back together again. Suddenly Dean felt pure contentment, something he had never felt before.
Cas… no Mia tilts his head and Dean swears he can feel his heart shatter. What he wouldn’t give for that to be the real Cas staring back at him.
And now the initial wave of euphoria is starting to wear off and questions are starting to swirl in his mind but goddammit he’s right and Dean needs to apologize to him. He opens his mouth to say something, anything, when Sam bursts in yelling “She’s a shapeshifter!” and suddenly the knot sinks right back into his chest.
“My whole life, I've had to be strong for Sammy.” He starts tentatively. “ But recently we were in a … large fight to say the least. We lost Cas, which you know. But our mother did die, we weren't making that up either. We also lost our friend. And hey this whole therapy thing might be horseshit but… I can’t keep going on like this. I can see their pity, and the one thing I can’t be is weak. I gotta get this shrink stuff figured out, for him. ”
Of course he says ok when Sammy asks to bring Jack along. Of course he does. Because really, what else is there to say? Sam’s the only one he has left and he isn’t about to start pushing him away now. If Sam got angry or Jack attacked him when Dean wasn’t around to help… the pencil in his hand snaps with the thought.  He bitterly resolves to do his best to make Jack as miserable as he is if he’s going to insist on coming.
Castiel woke up with a start, panic filling his limbs. Everything around him was dark, hard, and cold. Dead. At Lucifer’s hand no less. Once again he had failed to do the one thing he had wanted to do, protect the Winchesters. It doesn’t matter how much he gave for them, they most likely didn't make it. Although it's so dark he can barely see, he has to force his eyes shut and clasp his hands together. He takes a few deep, shuddering breaths and tries to focus on the feeling in his hands. If he tries, he can almost pretend he and Dean were back alone in the bunker, with Sam off on a case. Dean had forced him to watch The Shining and Castiel hadn’t been happy during the most suspenseful, frightening scenes. While he had been hiding his eyes under the blanket and resting his hand on one of the armrests, he had looked down to see Dean lacing his fingers through Cas’s. At that moment Castiel, for whom every feeling was a new and confusing situation, thought he might burst. His heart ached and all he could think was that he didn’t regret a single thing he did for Dean if they all had led him there.  Cas had been too afraid to look, too afraid even to say anything. He had thought that any sudden movements might shatter the moment. Dean had never said a word about it afterward so Castiel wasn’t entirely sure it hadn’t been a dream, but it was still a memory that he revisited often. Reluctantly he forces his eyes open.
Castiel has to curl his hands into fists and take deep breaths to keep from crying or screaming.“What do you want?”
He doesn’t remember driving to the town Cas was in, waking up from his haze only once they see a phonebooth with a trenchcoated man in front of it. They pull up in front of it and Dean cannot breathe, he cannot think. The step out of the car and Dean just stares at Cas in shock.
Hi guys! Sorry this took awhile, real life is kicking my butt. Hoping to get into my dream college I got deferred from! As always constructive criticism or any comments would be amazing.
Suddenly the Empty is reading his mind, and it hurts. He sees every failure, every disappointment, every ounce of pain he ever caused Dean. Shame floods through him because he knows at that moment that he needs Dean. On some fundamental level, he will never stop trying to keep him safe, even if it ends in pain. Urgency fills his body and now he wants to get back more than ever before if only to set things right. He can’t stay here, not with Dean still out there potentially dead or hurt.
Dean is suddenly feeling the weight lifting off his shoulders in droves, and tears are flowing freely now. A dry chuckle forces its way from his throat.
Working this case feels empty, hollow. It’s like the fire that used to drive him to feel so powerfully, to have his chest tighten up at the prospect of saving lives, has been dulled to the point that he can’t remember it. The old Dean, the one that still had something to fight for, is trapped inside a glass box banging on the doors and begging him to still have hope. Outwardly his body robotically is going through the motions, doing the things he is sure Sam expects, but inwardly he is collapsing in on himself, sliding deeper and deeper into his own mind.
The empty smiles mockingly, “Oh, save it. I have tiptoed through all your little tulips. Your memories, your little feelings, yes. I know what you hate. (Whispers) I know who you love… what you fear.
Suddenly he is once again staring at Cas. They stare at each other for a few moments when Dean lets go of his last shred of dignity. He holds on to the allusion that he's talking to his best friend, the one he knows cares about his issues.
Abruptly the therapist cuts him off yelling “Dean.” He stops talking immediately, though more out of shock than anything else. Having none of it, she proclaims “Can I talk to you in the other room please”
Dean has some angst but he is able to confess his love to Cas! It's how I wish the end of 13x05 and beginning of 13x06 had gone, but there is a lot of cannon compliance.
Cas mercifully gave him the slightest of smiles. “ What are we getting at here Dean? Do you mean…” and the hope in his eyes made Dean’s heart do jumping jacks. “Like… Like the pizza man loves the babysitter?”
The knot in his chest tightened and he had to bite his lip to keep from screaming. That stupid angel, his best friend, the only one he could count on… He absolutely couldn’t stay mad at him anymore, try as he might. Over the years he had tried so damn hard to keep from needing him, as he had disappointed them relentlessly. He tells himself that it’s just that Cas was his first real friend. He tells himself it’s just that Cas is the first non-blood-related person to stay in his life other than Sam and dad and he’s handsome so his lonely brain would convince itself something else was there. He makes excuse after excuse after excuse.
“Dean. Dean! I- I woke up in a field. I’m at a payphone in Clayton Kansas. I’ll explain to you later but can you please come pick me up?”
Somewhere, in the part of his mind he never lets see the light of day, he knows that the visceral reaction he’s having to Cas’s death is fundamentally different than Sam’s. Even as he sees Sam block out Cas to focus on saving mom he knows at some fundamental level that he is accepting Mary being gone far too easily. The reality of the situation was, he blamed her for every miserable bit of his screwed up life. If she hadn’t gone and made that deal then maybe he wouldn’t have had to live the way he did. He knows that isn’t fair, that if he holds everyone to that standard he too would be responsible for pain and suffering galore. But try as he might, in his secret heart of hearts he can’t help but feel a little bit relieved that Mary did what she did. At the very least it proves to him that she did care about them because seeing the brainwashed version of her threaten his life has forever broken that image of the perfect mother he clung to throughout his darkest days.
Dean pushed his foot to the floor, making the impala go at as fast as it could until all he could hear was the roaring of the engine and a faint hint of the Van Halen he put on in the background. The colors of his surroundings begin to blur and his thoughts start to fade into the background. Sam thinks he’s out getting groceries, and is probably asleep by this hour of night anyway. The second Dean stops moving the thoughts come back with a vengeance. Thoughts of Cas and Kelly and Crowley and mom, and Cas’s eyes lighting up as he got stabbed, and his lifeless body as Dean carried him inside, and the flames that engulfed him, and the way they got so damn close but he couldn’t save him. Dean can’t think about that right now, not when Sammy still is relaying on him to have hope. So he decides screw it, I’m gonna go get some air and here he is. He can sleep when he’s dead right?
“Do angels have genders?” It comes out of his mouth before he has a chance to stop it, but Castiel doesn’t seem taken aback by the question.
Dean’s hand reaches up to hold Cas’, pulls it from his mouth and brings it back to press a chaste kiss to his knuckles.
And then Cas shrugs off that giant coat, followed by the shirt, and pulls his undershirt over his head. And he just stares at Dean like it’s the least weird thing in the world.
“I’m very glad we had this conversation,” Cas tells him. “I hope that we can have more in the future.”
Still, hearing one of his messengers tell him there’s nothing wrong with it is nice. Dean thinks his hands might be shaking.
“No, kiddo, I didn’t. I, well.” Dean’s struggling to find the words, but Cas doesn’t jump in this time, and neither does Sam, who’s watching the exchange silently. Never in all the time he’s known Dean has he openly discussed his relationship with his gender, and he knows Sam hasn’t heard much of Dean’s side of the story either. “You know how Kaia named herself? How she didn’t know she was a girl until she was a little older?”
Turning back as he slides the shirt over his head, Dean prompts, “You gonna finish that thought, buddy?”
“Is everything alright?” Cas asks, suddenly worried he’s done something wrong. Asked for too much, said too much.
Jack nods, sagely. He and Kaia still see each other regularly – along with visits from Claire – and Jack had been so excited when he learned how Kaia had discovered herself. Castiel thinks it had touched Dean when Jack told them, even if he wasn’t ready to talk about it yet.
Castiel pulls his undershirt back on, then shimmies back into his dress shirt and begins buttoning it back up. Dean commits the image of Cas’ bare chest in front of him to memory before he has a chance to stop himself.
“You’re trans?” Jack asks with that childlike bluntness Castiel so adores. Sam looks relieved that he didn’t have to be the one to say it.
Dean brings a hand to the back of his neck for a moment, anticipation clear, before making another Look – the resolute one, same as the night he took him to that brothel – and sitting down across from him.
Castiel pauses, looking down at his bare chest. “I don’t know that I would consider them mine, as I’m technically only borrowing this body, but from an aesthetics perspective, I suppose I do. I appreciate what they represent, and to an extent, I suppose I can relate.”
“Just a winged asshat,” Dean says. Cas can hear the smile in his voice, feel his hands running through his hair.
“Of course.” He says nothing for a time, the both of them just looking at each other, thinking about what has been said. “Do you… need anything else?”
Dean wonders, not for the first time, what Castiel would be like if he were a human. Would he be a man? Would he make the conscious choice to be one, like Dean did?
“To me,” Castiel continues, “there’s something holy in it. Claiming an identity for oneself, regardless of what one is told to be. He is a good man, and my Father loves him no less than he loves any of his children.”
Oh. It still evades him, the intricacies of human conversation. Cas thought he had been perfectly clear, but he explains regardless. “I wanted to keep you tucked away, safe in your own mind, held in the deepest recesses of my angelic presence. I wanted to share this body –” Cas runs a hand over Dean’s side, tracing old scars from knives and bullet wounds and flesh that has finally started to have padding underneath rather than taut muscle – “I wanted to cohabitate. I wanted to speak in your voice and tell you how radiant you are. How beautiful. How
, that same voice says in the back of Castiel’s mind, but he ignores it. “No, I mean I haven’t thought of myself as an angel in… I’m not sure how long.”
He smiles, but he doesn’t argue; between himself, John Winchester, and God Himself, there is no doubt in his mind who would win Father of the Year.
“Well,” Castiel continues, considering, “Angels don’t exactly have a concept of gender, at least not as you’d understand it, but at some point I started thinking of myself as a man. Even as an angel, I was a man, too.”
“When I rebuilt your body after pulling you from Hell,” he begins, and Dean clenches his jaw to keep from telling an angel of the Lord to shut the fuck up, “I was told to bring you back in good health. I healed your scars and several years’ worth of damage to your liver, reversed damage from untreated concussions and poorly-set broken bones, but those–” He stops, nodding his head towards Dean’s chest, and Dean resists the urge to cross his arms like he did before his surgery took care of the need to. “Those scars mean something to you. You wouldn’t have been happy to see them gone.”
“You got the basics, yeah,” Dean says. Then, after a moment, he adds, “There a reason you’re here, or did you just have a craving for uncomfortably personal conversations?”
Castiel nods, slowly. “Yes,” he says after a moment, “though I’m not certain I grasp the extent of it. You, at some point, made the decision to undergo surgery as part of a transition between genders, and this isn’t something you share often due to fear of retribution from bigots in the Hunting community. Am I correct?”
? That statement has never rung so true; if Cas were made of porcelain or glass or weaker stuff than skin and bones and meat and tissue he would be broken into a thousand tiny pieces on the floor.
“Dean,” Cas says after a moment, eyes returning to meet his. “My vessel… The man who agreed to let me use his body to walk the earth, he has scars like yours.”
“I thought I understood devotion before. Duty. But you – I know I’ve said it before, but you really did change me. Mindless obedience isn’t love. Gentleness, tenderness, kindness – those are love. I would show you love.” It’s amazing, really, how easy it is to say these things now.
Dean takes a deep breath, and Cas feels it under him – the rise and fall of his chest. His lips are parted only slightly, and Cas reaches up to cup his cheek in his hand, gently pushing on Dean’s lower lip; just enough to scrape against his teeth. His mouth is warm, and he needs lip balm.
“What –” He swallows again – “What else?” Dean’s almost whispering now, like he’s afraid Sam or Jack might hear from their rooms down the hall, so he has to be quiet. Cas knows from experience that Dean doesn’t need to worry about being overheard.
“Yeah, that can’t be it, though,” Dean says, ever self-deprecating. Cas decides to let it slide, for now; getting Dean to let down his walls has been a struggle since that night after the Empty, when they finally aired out over a decade’s worth of baggage and decided to try.
A normal person would have elaborated by now, but Cas is about as far from a normal person as you can get. Dean’s not all that surprised when Cas just stares as he tosses the towel in the sink, resolutely walking past Cas and into the motel room. He walks past Sam’s bed like it burns him to be close to it, digging in his bag for a clean shirt.
Cas pulls on his trenchcoat, and before Dean can say more, he’s gone with a gust of wind and the flap of wings. He lets out a small sigh. Angels, man.
“We were talking about,” Dean starts, and when Castiel turns to him he sees only a little bit of panic in his eyes. “Uh. Gender, I guess.” A pregnant pause follows, and Cas can see Dean arguing with himself on whether or not to continue.
Angels have existed for all of time, really, but Castiel can’t help wondering as he idly sips his third cup of coffee of the day (handed to him with a quick kiss to his hair by Dean as he cooks) how many have had this. Domesticity, family, love for humanity more than just a part of their code. An identity of their own outside of Heaven’s orders. But would he still count as an angel, human as he is?
“Well, I– uh,” Dean starts, and Cas is almost tempted to remind him that he loves him, just to see how much redder he can get. “Since I was around ten? I hit puberty pretty early, and–” He glances down at his chest, runs a hand over his shirt. “Dad would try and buy me bras and shit, and I didn’t hate all of it, but I dunno. It just felt off, somehow. Started dressing like a guy around eleven, and Dad didn’t give a shit as long as I could shoot straight and look out for Sammy. Hell, I think he preferred having a son, anyway.”
The next few minutes are filled with domestic conversation, Dean agreeing to drive Jack to the nearby middle school he’s been attending since deciding to become a child for good with only minimal implications made about Sam’s sex life, and soon enough dinner is served. Cas sends a text to Jack (emoticons, truly one of the best inventions in all of human history), and mere seconds later the kitchen table is complete.
“Yeah, yeah, man. I just–” Dean shifts slightly, grasping for Cas’ hand where it’s come to rest again on Dean’s chest. “I just need something to, uh, ground me. I think.”
“Yeah?” Dean finds himself licking his lips as he returns his gaze to Cas’ eyes. That searchlight’s got him again.
means these days. Blood, Ruby, exorcisms: you name it, Dean’s thinking it. He makes a mental note to call Bobby after whatever this is, because Sam’s not listening to anything Dean tells him, and Dean’s almost too tired to try.
“Jack,” Castiel prompts once everyone’s gotten a burger on their plate (veggie for Sam and Castiel, beef for Jack and Dean), “How was school today?”
“Jack, we’ve discussed this,” Cas continues, ignoring Sam – who has revealed himself as something of an enabler since the defeat of God – smirking into his burger. “Part of knowing how to use your powers is knowing to respect –”
There’s another pause, then Dean shakes his head, making that odd expression he only seems to make around Cas. It reminds him of when they left that club, years ago, after Castiel had committed some human social faux pas or another and Dean told him he hadn’t laughed that hard in his life. It was a nice sound.
Cas is still lying in Dean’s arms, his ear resting on the spot his chest connects to his shoulder, and Dean’s heartbeat pounds away. But that seems to jolt Dean, Cas listening to the air as it is sucked in through his nose in a sharp inhale. Dean’s head rises slightly from where it was sunken into his pillow, his eyes meeting Cas’.
“Yeah, Cas, they do.” Dean takes a seat on his bed, his knees just inches from Cas’. He can almost feel the energy radiating off of him like static electricity. “You–” He swallows. “You know what they mean?”
“That’s so cool!” Jack exclaims, and Cas gives Dean’s hand a supportive squeeze under the table. “Sam, did you know Dean’s trans?”
“Can I–” Dean starts, nervously, “Can I see?” Was that weird? That was weird. Why did he ask that? He’s gonna get smited, he’s sure he is.
He may be growing into an old man, but he would choose that over millenia more as an angel in a heartbeat. Humanity has the potential for change, and now with Chuck gone, free will at last. Dean is a self-made man as much as Castiel, and he can’t think of a better man to grow old with.
Eventually, it got to be 3 AM. Absolutely nothing was happening. Cas sighed, and started to turn his car on to leave. Just at that moment was when a movement caught his eye. He whipped his head to the side, just barely able to make out the figure using his heightened, angelic senses.
Dean stopped at the first gas station he came across. There was a scrawny teenage boy and a balding guy who was probably his dad. Dean flashed his badge.
"What the Hell else am I supposed to do, here, Cas? Go to therapy? You've been in my fucking head. You know what I've gone through. If I ever make the mistake of processing it, I make sure I wake up the next morning with half a bottle of whiskey in my hand. I have to keep going. I always do, because that's my job." Dean stopped sharply, realizing how loud and upset he was getting. He then looked over at Cas.
By the 3rd day, they had found jackshit. Dean was practically scaling the walls with nerves. This was not good at all.
Cas was struck with the thought that he had been pushing away since Dean's mouth first met his-that Dean was going to freak out, and change his mind. Or, realize that this was not what he wanted. That Cas was not what he wanted.
Cas had a flash of a memory appear- it was the moment Lucifer appeared behind him, and stabbed him. He saw Dean's face for just an instant, but it was imprinted in his memory. He almost heard a phantom-like yell, and recognized it from Dean's memories.
But right then, Dean's eyes looked old. Not like an elderly human's eyes, no- he had the eyes of a being who had went through centuries of torment.
Cas arrived in the town about 11 the next morning, as he decided to stop for the night- and gear up. He kept a silver knife and his angel blade on him, as well as the FBI badge he always had in his jacket.
"Something always goes wrong," the Angel defended himself. He had a point. Dean could've backed down, here, but some part of him didn't want to. He was hurting too much, and needed to take it out on something. And here Cas was, throwing gas on the fire that was Dean's emotions.
No- he was expecting some type of cop-out. A deathbed confession, maybe, similar to what Cas pulled a few years before.
Cas slowly glided towards Dean. Still, he remained motionless. He kept the act up this far- he had to keep his walls up. It was one of his worst coping mechanisms, but it was necessary to protect those he loved from getting hurt. And, himself.
Dean made it into Bushnell after what seemed like way-too-fucking-long of a drive, if he did say so himself. All along the way he asked about Cas, but he received rather vague and unhelpful answers. Of course, he couldn't believe his luck that he was even on the trail. About halfway through Missouri, he realized that it was possible that Cas could have been headed for the exact same case, but that was probably just wishful thinking.
Cas turned it over, and saw that it already went back to it's human state. That was rather quick. No matter. He had to find the other ones, still.
"I'm sorry, if you haven't noticed, that's kind of my job. If you think I'd be so inclined as to sit here and watch you silently waste away, you are mistaken, Dean. For eons, I thought I understood humanity so well. Why you do what you do, what's important to you. I thought I'd understood everything. And then I met you."
