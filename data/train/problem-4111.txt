“I am not…” He shoved Jo playfully. “The guy is weird, Sam. He baked me a pie.” He turned to Jo. “And I’m sharing, you don’t need to rag on me for eating pie for breakfast.”
Jody looked him up and down. “The moms in the grade will take advantage of the cute, naïve, single father.”
Castiel relented and waved him through, leading him back to his office. He eyed Gabriel who grinned ear to ear. “You didn’t actually watch Jack so no information is owed.”
“My dad, he…” Dean shrugged, looked almost ashamed as he glanced at the ground before opening his water bottle.
“Daddy is really good at baking,” Jack said. “He made a pie for us too. We had it for dessert last night.”
The two sat in silence after that, eating their lunch. Jody knew quite a lot about him even though she only had met Castiel two years ago. She’d only been Sheriff a few weeks the night of the accident. He knew the night had impacted her badly. It was a freak storm: wind that blew trees across the street and rain that had made the road slick. It was only by chance that her deputies went to his apartment and not her.
“Semantics. Give me all the details. How did you meet? What is she like? How’s the sex? Has Jack met her?”
“I wasn’t ashamed, just fearful.” Castiel replied. “At that point I had my life all planned out and Luke had the power to rip it away.” Even though ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ was repealed during his service, he never was able to shake the feeling that it was dirty secret he had.
“You probably need the rest more.” Dean came up behind him as Castiel paused the ingredient preparation. “I’m not too used to someone else cooking; you’re going to spoil me.” He placed his hands on Castiel’s waist, rolling his hips against his ass.
“Maybe I’m a little sad that the windows broken, but it can easily be fixed and…” He took a deep breath. “Remember how on career day I said I helped other people who were soldiers?”
Jack nodded quickly. “I liked her. She had foam swords and told us she was the Queen of the Moons and we were training to be knights.”
Even with the distraction Castiel still finished early. He had called Gabriel while he was submitting the final paperwork and it was just in time. It was amazing he had finished so early, he mused while he was driving. The conversation with Sam unnerved him a bit. Usually setting someone up would be light and casual, but it was like he was sincerely asking for help. He was used to helping people work through their issues, it had even become his full-time job. And Dean? Castiel was certainly intrigued by him. Yes, he was certainly handsome. Broad shouldered from the physical labor he did each day and green eyes that reminded him of spring.
“I assure that even if I don’t drink, I have put out on the first date before.” Castiel doesn’t know where the boldness came from, but it’s worth it to see Dean nearly spit out his water.
. His voice was deep and grumbly. He liked helping out old guys most of the time. Usually, they ended up being repeat customers and when he finished a job, they would invite him to sit down with a beer and talk.
“I already said yes, Cas. And the perk of being your own boss is I make my schedule, so let me know when you’re free.”
Castiel couldn’t help but notice it was not Dean’s normal laugh. Usually his laugh was unguarded and came from deep inside his belly. When he laughed it reached his eyes, the most beautiful crinkles forming and the freckles on his nose almost seemed to dance. This was forced, and shallow. He hadn’t been with Dean that long, but it was as if there was more information that wasn’t being told.
“Well, you are still my number one babysitter if you let my kids step foot in your house ever again.” She laughed, but then set the sandwich down as she leaned forward. “I meant to ask you what happened that night. You’ve told me before that you don’t like to be alone when it happens.”
Castiel didn’t realize how tense he was. He loosens his shoulders, and turns to stand in front of him. “Thank you for being so honest with me.”
Jody’s eyebrow shot up as she leaned forward. “And you went on a date with him. I know I promised not to meddle, but Alex tells me pretty much everything.”
Having saw Dean the day prior, it was not Castiel’s intention to call him again. Jody did not work until midnight, but she dropped the girls off at three so she could nap before then. He was in the middle of cooking dinner when the children began to wear his patience thin.
Charlie did have an impressive collection of board games. Gilda seemed happy at this decision. Dean on the other hand rolled his eyes as Charlie selected some strategy game. Before long they settled down at the table. The pizza is greasier than he would normally go for and his cookies are enjoyed thoroughly. More importantly he forgot for a few moments about his awful afternoon and that he has to do laundry tomorrow and that he promised Jody the girls could spend Saturday night when Jody covers a graveyard shift.
Castiel just shook his head as he looked around where Dean was driving. He was heading toward the state park that was nearby. “It’s not easy to talk about. Forget I said anything.”
“Enough about me.” Castiel followed her actions, sweeping the crumbs off the desk in his cupped hand. “Any new exciting revelations?”
Even after speaking to Dean at the barbeque, Castiel cannot imagine calling Dean Winchester out of the blue. Even worse is the thought of texting. Besides, what would he even say to the man? He’s seems perfectly nice, but he’s not sure if he’s willing to risk everything by going all in yet. Do people ordinarily call almost perfect strangers to ask to hang out as friends?
“I didn’t realize he was so old now.” She took a seat in the chair across from him and set down the folder to lay it open. “New client that I think would do well with you.”
Castiel raised an eyebrow as he crossed his arms over his chest. He looked over his brother who looked like he rolled out of bed, but was most likely just in half of his work clothes. He wore grey linen pants and a white undershirt, dusting of flour still showing. Even though Gabriel was on the other side of the counter he could smell the sweet scent that clung to his clothes.
Castiel goes upstairs with Jack to help him locate his favorite light blue and white striped shirt. He knew he should make the girls pack up their own bags, but instead he folds up their pajamas. He’s surprised that the girls are both sitting at the table, laughing. Dean is in the kitchen frowning.
“No, I probably wouldn’t have graduated high school if it weren’t for the combined efforts of Sam and Bobby. My dad said I should join the Marines like him, that’d I make a good solider, but I…” He stopped himself. “It wasn’t my thing. Started working at Bobby’s garage during most of the year and did some summer firefighting.”
“Claire will probably pout, but it’s what I have on hand.” She set the beer down as she grabbed a bag of frozen peas out of the freezer. “So, tell me about this new place.”
On the weekends he would usually spend more time on breakfast than the usual cereal or oatmeal. Glancing at the clock he saw it was 6:45, Jack would be up no later than 7:30 knowing him. He began to gather ingredients: some he kept in the freezer, onion, cheese, and eggs. He makes slow work of this, pausing long enough to start coffee. About fifteen minutes later he hears footsteps on the stairs.
Dean drank down the rest of his hot chocolate too, and watched for Castiel to finish his. “Come here.” He pulled Castiel close, an arm around him. “Why don’t we watch a movie now, it’s not too late.”
“Cas, I know it kind of came off as a joke, but I am genuinely curious. You can’t keep this woman under lock and key forever. With a few candy bars and brownies Jack will sing like a canary.”
“Yeah, and it was Jack.” Dean held out his hand and shook it again. “Mighty nice to invite me for dinner.”
The apartment building wasn’t really an apartment building, but rather a complex with about ten apartments facing a breezeway. He climbed the stairs to apartment number five and only had to knock once before the door was swung open. Charlie stood there with a wide smile.
After Jack goes inside, he walks around the house and finds Deans in coveralls, splattered with small amounts of paint. “Just finishing touches, I’ll be out of your hair soon.”
Jody smirked as poured the peas into a pan with a bit of water. She opened the oven letting out the wonderful smell of her roast chicken. “I am pretty handy myself if you need help.”
“You playing ‘board games’…” He quirked his fingers into quotations marks. “One night with your friends does not a bad father make. You’re better than Lucifer ever would have been…”
“And lady, I don’t know what you thought but the two of us are together.” Dean put an arm around Castiel’s shoulder, and then gave her his best charming smile.
“And the only help you let me give you,” Sam teased. “Like I said, if you ever need a babysitter my fiancé Eileen would be more than happy to.”
“Just tell me what you want to know.” Castiel looked at the sandwich and decided to try to eat again.
After he turned down the road and the lake house came into view, he realized that is not the case. The house was quaint two-story cabin painted bright white. There’s raised garden beds that appear to be growing vegetables and a swing set with a slide attached. He sees two cars: a shiny new Prius and rusted Lincoln Continental. For a moment he considered calling Sam to yell at him because he’s doing this friend a favor by working on a Saturday and he never works on the weekend. The last thing he wants is to see one of Sam’s stuck-up lawyer friends.
“Sorry to disappoint. I brought sandwiches and soup. Kali’s been on me about eating better.” He pulled out two foil wrapped sandwiches first then two containers of soup and then two wax paper sleeves. “Peanut butter cookies.”
Her smile was weak as she looked at him. He didn’t know what else to say so he pressed record and stepped out into the hall. After that hours passed in the blink of the eye. He spoke to a lawyer the hospital contacted so Kelly could make her last wishes known just in case. Soon his siblings all arrived. Michael dealt with everything having to do with Luke as Anna dealt with trying to contact their parents and Kelly’s. Gabriel was Gabriel. He got donuts and coffee trying to lighten the mood, help everyone carry the burden. Castiel didn’t leave Kelly’s side once he had greeted them.
“It’s Ellen, for the both of you.” She gave Jack a wink. “Dean brought your pie to Sunday dinner. I am going to have to get your recipe.”
When Sam had texted Dean that he needed him to do a job ASAP, he almost bailed on it. That was until his brother called him and explained it was for friend from the resource center he volunteered at. He didn’t say anything but the man had called him,
“Hey, it’s no one’s fault. It was an accident and I could have done the same thing if I was out there with all of you.”
Dean then picked up the plates, not listening to a word of argument from Castiel. Once dinner is picked up, Dean borrowed a book from his bookshelf and watched the kids outside while Castiel took a shower. By the time he came back down they are all on the living room floor playing with some of Jack’s toys. Dean was still reading. He stayed until the kids started to get sleepy and made his way to leave as they went in their separate direction to prepare for bed.
At the beginning Cas is drinking, references his problem with alcohol later. The police inform Cas of a car accident, and that his brother is dead. Cas speaks with Kelly in the hospital, she later passes away too after giving birth to Jack.
“Nice clothes, neat hair, cologne, and it’s a Saturday night.” She put her hands on her hips. “Why can’t you tell me? I am your favorite sister.”
Dean looked at Castiel. The man had never been anything but loving with his son that he had seen. “What do you mean his mess?”
Sam Winchester seemed to know just about everyone. When his old car gave him trouble, he told him about Bobby Singer. The man was a magician and probably the only reason that Castiel could delay buying a car for six weeks. When his laptop seemed to be failing, he told him about Charlie Bradbury. She was so good he was almost positive that the alterations she made weren’t quite legal. “If they are like Bobby and Charlie.”
A smile crosses Dean’s face as he gets off the step ladder and puts his hands on his hips. “Is there going to be pie?”
, but I think you would do Dean some good. He’s had a rough time lately and he won’t talk to me or Bobby like he normally does.”
“It’s great.” He opened it and sees a scarf. It’s a chunky knit and dark blue speckled throughout with lighter shades of blue. “It’s lovely.”
“Why must you give me all the difficult cases?” He turned the file to face him and skimmed it over. “He’s not even violent.”
Castiel had been stateside for three months when he heard a knock at his door. He had no idea what time it was as he had fallen asleep on the couch watching some sitcom that everyone kept on making references to. Although he supposed that the whiskey bottle that was getting dangerously low had a large part in his sleepy nature. Another knock.
“Still. I know that you tell Gabriel everything and don’t try to deny it. I stopped in the bakery this week and he looked like a cat that caught the canary when I said I was watching Jack.”
“It’s my apartment to,” he said. “And if you must know that bitch and I got into an argument so I took the first bus home.”
“Nothing happened that night. Dean came and I offered him dinner for being so nice to come over on his day off. Then he stayed. He just watched the kids to give me time to wind down and left when they started to get ready for bed.” Castiel looked at Jody’s reaction which was very confusing. Her eyes looked sad, but a smile tugged at the corners of her mouth.
After dinner Jack begged and begged to go out and skip rocks on the lake (“For the second time today”). He was so full of bright enthusiasm as he ran ahead of them. If Castiel hadn’t shouted—or rather sternly spoke—at him to stop he would have ended knee deep in the water. It made Dean’s heart pang for a life he had left behind a few years ago.
“Keeping the peace between Bobby and Dean…” She pointed to the grill. “I’ll get us some beers and tell him you came.”
me.” He knew the sarcasm dripping from the word was uncalled for. She seemed like a sweet woman, but that hit a nerve.
“I was trying to get her to confront her bias about men being parents you were trying to humiliate her.”
Castiel waited a few moments, not wanting to ask for help, but at the same time he knew Jody wouldn’t object. She knew Dean. “It would.”
“No.” His voice is firm as he sits up a bit straighter causing Dean to drop his arm. “Well first of all you should know that I’m not Jack’s biological father.”
Dean set down his fork, and placed an elbow on the table as he leaned forward. “When you asked me out you said no kids. I’m going to hold you to that, probably because if I didn’t that would be the only thing you would talk about.”
“I’ve shown you mine already,” Dean replied with a grin across his face. “Come on, it’s just your brother. What’s the matter?”
“I do…” Castiel peeked his head out towards the living room. “Thank you for coming. Jack was a bit disappointed that we were having a sleep over without him. I don’t think he fully understands that sometimes adults want alone time.”
It seemed like a lifetime ago. It was in a way, Jack’s lifetime. “I brought ice cream and cones. You three can have them as soon as you eat your vegetable and if you promise to eat them in the backyard.”
“Your brother Luke Novak and his partner, Kelly Kline, were involved in a car accident early tonight. Luke was dead on arrival and Kelly had been transported to Sacred Heart Hospital.” The words came out blunt and emotionless. He knew when you informed someone of a death you had to use concrete language. This was a conversation that he had unfortunately had to have a few times over the years that he was deployed.
“No, I can tell that Claire likes you. I know she thinks I’m…I forget how she phrased it but boring I suppose.” He sighed.
“It looks like there are a lot of people. Let me know if you ever feel overwhelmed, okay Jack?” He turned in his seat and saw his son scrambling to get out of the booster. He knew that the words for more for him than anyone else.
That afternoon Castiel frowned as he packed his overnight bag. His years in the military and his own tendency towards minimalism meant that he knew how to pack lightly. As he grabbed a t-shirt to sleep in, he saw Jack standing in the doorway.
“Peer support specialist…” He realized that he would have to do better as most did not know what that meant. “I help out veterans that are coming home, get them adjusted to civilian life again.”
Castiel doesn’t know what to say, but his words are tangled with emotion. Right now, he couldn’t picture anyone else than Alfie, and he doesn’t know why this has to be a secret. What could be wrong with loving such kind, thoughtful person?
“Yes, one of those pick the fruit yourself orchards.” He extended them toward Ellen who just gave him a wide grin.
“Come on in.” He doesn’t say anything about Dean talking off his work boots, which he finds strange. The entire house is immaculate. Even with having three children running around any clutter could be picked up in five minutes. “I am in the middle of baking cookies. A bribe for the children I am afraid.”
“Leave!” Castiel shouted, he threw the shirt at Alfie, but didn’t know he was the only thing blocking Luke’s view.
Dean eyes got wide as he shook a finger in his brother’s face. “Are you trying to set me up?” he said accusatorily. “You did the same with Cassie, and then Robin.” He groaned as Eileen’s laugh gave it away. He was even more mad that it had worked.
“You’re good with them,” Castiel whispered as he bumped against Dean’s shoulder while they walked from the monkey enclosure to where the big cats were.
By the time he arrives at the resource center he ends up being five minutes early and found out that his first appointment of the day canceled. He lets himself take a deep breath as he goes out front to grab a cup of coffee.
Jack just shrugged again. “I haven’t met anyone with two daddies before, but I guess it would be alright.”
Dean followed him through the house, no longer as worried at having to face the man’s wrath for his work boots tracking in dirt. Honestly, he was surprised to see the little boy perched on a bar stool in the kitchen. “Where’s the rest of them?”
“Please Dean. No secrets from me.” The man closed the distance between them, hand gong to rub his arm. “Why don’t I make tea?”
“I was hoping you would be late enough so I could hide the evidence.” She sighed as Castiel followed her to the table to help. He smiled upon seeing a large casserole dish filled with macaroni and cheese with sliced hotdogs. There was another bowl full of carrots and peas.
“Jody you apologized enough already. Besides it was an accident, I should have been watching them more closely.”
Early Monday afternoon he was surprised to get a phone call from reception saying that he had a visitor for lunch. Castiel frowned. He normally took his lunch from 12:30-1:30 every day, but the only person who ever came to see him was Jody. As he walked out, he heard laughter and saw his brother, Gabriel, leaned against the counter with two pink boxes from his bakery and a paper bag.
“Everything! How you met, what’s he’s like… I don’t know. Just give me your best Anna impression and go ahead.”
Castiel thought he had to be dreaming. His nightmares had been particularly vivid as of late. “Would I be able to see her?” he asked slowly wiping a hand over his face. Kelly had been dating his brother on and off for the better part six years.  He didn’t know why she was with him tonight; last he heard they had a big fight when she told Luke she was pregnant. Luke was doing the very Luke thing by avoiding her at all costs.
“Is that why you seemed so angry? What are you going to do? Run to mommy like you’ve been doing for these past few months. You think she’d be thrilled about this?”
Honestly, he swore his brother used Jack as an excuse to do all sorts of things that may be considered too childish for a man in his thirties. The photo came next: Jack with his hands covered in some thick purple sparkly substance. Castiel groaned at that, but knew better than to complain because Gabriel will try to give him a gallon sized bag full of the stuff.
“Are you going to fix the window? It made Mr. Novak upset,” Claire questioned as she watched him with a careful.
“Thought you’d never ask,” Dean teased. “I can’t do more than put up some plywood right now so this shouldn’t take me that long, but don’t wait for me.”
“Family’s not just blood. Sam thinks you’re a good guy and…” Dean looked at Jack with a smile on his face. “Sometimes people should cut good guys a break.”
While downstairs was largely impersonal—the closest was a few pieces of Jack’s artwork on the fridge—the upstairs hall was filled with pictures. There were what appeared to be school pictures; pictures of Castiel and Jack at all of the boy’s various life stages; and one rather stuffy looking family photo taken in front of a Christmas tree with what must be Castiel’s siblings and parents. He tried to pick out who must be Jack’s mother, but there was only one woman that didn’t seem to be family. A kind looking woman who a much younger Castiel had an arm strung over her shoulder—he couldn’t be more than 20 in the photo. The next photo she was in was with the blond man from the family photo in front of the Christmas tree.
Castiel almost said his goodbye, but he stopped himself. “If you want you are invited to spend the night. It will be a PG sleepover as Jack’s bedroom is across the hall, but if you want…”
It was mid-August when Dean finally invited Castiel to his house for dinner, and had slyly asked if it was possible for him to stay the night. Though he was hesitant he decided that he could always back out later. Gabriel volunteered to watch Jack for the night with the contingency that Castiel would set aside sometime to explain
Castiel pinched his nose and then looked at the clock. “My lunch break is over in a few minutes. Why don’t we table this for now?”
By the time Dean was knocking at his door, the house had descended into chaos. Or at least chaos in Castiel’s book. Jack was in his pajamas, Claire’s hair needed to be done, breakfast needed to be eaten, and lunch was only half-packed.
Dean didn’t know what to expect, but Castiel got out a sauce pan along with cocoa powder, milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt. With practiced patience the man stared at the stove waiting for milk to boil and whisking the ingredients together. “You can change if you want. There is bathroom in my room, first one at the top of stairs. You can also change in the spare room downstairs.”
Castiel tried not to curse again as he mopped the water with a cloth and put the biggest bucket he could find under the leak. “Can you eat in the car?”
“Listen, I’m not one for emotions or chick flick moments, but let me just say that I get it Cas.” Dean sighed and pushed his empty plate away. “My dad was a Marine. My mom she was…” Dean just smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. His eyes looked as though they may well with tears any minute. “She got him. Knew exactly what to say or do. She died when I was 4 and then I became the one that had to help my dad.”
“Are you coming to career day?” Alex questioned, pulling Castiel out of his head. “Mom was the class favorite when I brought her in and Claire said that it was next week.”
The rest of the summer was one of the best that Castiel had since he was teenager. Perhaps that was because time he spent with Dean made him feel like he was sixteen again. Their dates were rather formulaic:  they would get food or go to movie, but at the end of the night they would end up back in Dean’s Impala. Only now it seemed that Dean was the one that stopped them as soon as hands tried to slip under the clothes.
“I had to drop off some paperwork for one of the guys.” He sat in his chair, looking wholly uncomfortable as he wiped his palms on his pants.  “And I wanted to talk with you since you’re not great with texts.”
“Cas, come on. Maybe she’s a little pushy, but I think you could use someone that bosses you around. Besides the last guy she dated nearly fainted when he saw her side arm.”
From now on assume everything is in the present. Additionally, most everything is from Castiel's perspective, but there is going to be some from Dean's perspective starting in this chapter.
“I just told mom that he was acting like Lucifer again, but that wasn’t the truth…” Gabriel rubbed the back of his neck. “He…He was complaining about living with you. I told him to grow up, but then he started bragging about how he finally got dirt on the perfect Castiel.”
“Yes,” he answered. He saw the two girls exchange confused looks. Jack was not surprised he had seen photos and had been to the resource center with him many times. “But I wouldn’t talk about that.”
Castiel surveyed the apartment with a smile. Luke had left three days ago for a ski trip with Kelly, and then he was going straight home for Christmas. Kelly said that her parents didn’t mind him coming along, but he knew that Luke would. Besides, he had better plans. They had an entire month off for winter break, and he had almost two weeks before his parents expected him home. Two glorious weeks to himself, and a few days that he could spend alone with Alfie.
Gabriel frowned as he gathered his garbage into the paper sack. The brothers only murmured goodbyes, Gabriel pausing at the door to sweep his brother into one of his warm hugs. When Castiel sat back down at his desk, he realized how much better it felt to tell one of his family members about Dean, but he did not expect the sudden resurgence of memories.
During lunch it still seemed that Jack was sad, so Castiel took him out by the lake to skip rocks again. It was a simple, but something that never failed to put a smile on his face. As they selected their rocks he was reminded of Kelly. When he returned home, they met on the beach, drinking coffee on the rocks. He almost didn’t go near the water but she insisted that since it was low tide, they needed to look for sand dollars. No sand dollars were found, but she found quite a few smooth, flat stones and insisted on teaching him how to properly skip rocks.
He bit his lip not quite knowing what to say so he pulled him in for another hug again. How had he not thought that this sort of thing would fall on him to teach? While his elementary school was the best for a child of Jack’s ability, it was by no means progressive. This was a discussion he should bring up with Jack’s teacher. In the meantime, there had to be books he could get for him.
After dinner was finished, Castiel had to argue with Dean that he didn’t need to help with dishes. Still he stayed leaning against the kitchen as Castiel loaded up the dishwasher and Jack went outside to play on the swing set. When Dean looked down at his watch for the time, Castiel opened a drawer to pull out his check book. He wrote it hastily, adding a little extra to the low price that Dean had told him. “No arguments.”
“No.” Dean could detect the irritation in Cas’s voice. “But I want to know about you. Don’t people normally talk on these things? Get to know each other.” The tone was flippant, but Castiel could tell this was not something he was familiar with.
“I didn’t mean to.” Castiel leaned forward on the seat, grabbing at Dean’s arm. Though he barely tugged Dean came right back to him as they kissed once more. “We should go back to my car, it’s bit of a drive.”
“Good, my favorite.” He smirked. “We have butterflies and birds after lunch, then some of the indoor exhibits if you want to see them.” Castiel was taking a bite of the sandwich as he thumbed through the brochures. The kids looked a little disappointed as they sat their eating their food. “But we can spend a lot of time here so you can climb on the play structures.”
“I didn’t mean to bring all this shit up. It just never seemed right, and you never told me so I didn’t know if it was a secret.”
They all loaded up their plates with the spaghetti and went outside to where a picnic table sat. The night was actually not too hot and there was a breeze in the air. Typically, Alex would be able to carry a conversation and Claire could nudge a few words out of Jack, but tonight they were mostly quiet. The talking didn’t start until Dean came out; a plate heaped full with pasta. He sat next to Castiel; the table not very large so their knees bumped together.
“That’s what the kids call it these days, oh Cassie…” He tossed an arm around Castiel’s shoulder. “I don’t work at the bakery on Saturdays so he can stay late or spend the night if you need.” He gave a wink.
“Cajun and Creole, Andrea and I are from Louisiana and were mighty disappointed at the food selection nearby.” He slung an arm over his wife’s shoulder.
“We brought some dishes over from the cart, let us know what you think.” Andrea turned her head when there were squeals of excitement from the children. “Which one is yours?”
Castiel hesitated, but Charlie grabbed his plate after storing the cookies in a container. When he drove to Gabriel’s place, his usually boisterous brother had told him to be quiet. On the couch Jack had fallen asleep, a fleece Scooby Doo blanket tossed over him. “I… I always put him to bed.”
“Oh, well let’s get to business.” He stepped out of the house and gestured to the roof. “When I bought the house a year ago, they said it should last for a few more years, but I am starting to doubt that.” He stopped and blinked a few times. “Once again, being rude. Castiel Novak, you came highly recommended by your brother.”
Another less serious note, is that I've never really set the exact years this takes place. Basically present day is in 2020/1 (minus Covid-19). This is important for some of the timing that comes up later. Their is a flashback contained in the chapter that just states 14 years ago, this is approximately 2006 and Castiel's Sophomore year of college.
“Fuck, that’s…” Dean shook his head as he walked over to place the cutting board next to the sink, presumably to put the lettuce. “At least she was honest with you.” His tone was more serious, mouth set straight. “It hurts, but sometimes you just have to walk away to keep the people you love safe.”
wouldn’t want to take all three of them to the zoo. I barely want to take both Alex and Claire to the store with me.”
“You don’t have to tell him everything, not right away. Dean has his own secrets and I’m guessing he’ll have a much harder time than you,” Jody finally said as she gathered the trash off her desk.
“Dean…” Castiel said softly. The words that he repeated every day at work die in his mouth. Because Dean was not the soldier that came home from the war zone. He was the son of someone that did. Someone who never should have put that much weight on a small child’s shoulders. Perhaps this is what Sam referenced.
my brother. He’s the one in my family I’m closest with.” Castiel shook his head, and paused when he saw he Jack freeze as a butterfly landed on his shoulder. “Besides if you meet him it’s only a matter of time before Anna hears about then she’ll tell my parents, and you’ll have to meet my entire family.”
“Sam was trying to nudge me in your direction, but I resisted. Well, I did until you spoke with me at the barbeque. You weren’t judgmental and you didn’t feel sorry for me, you were just there. Just like you were their last weekend.”
The first date had gone better than expected. Much better than expected. He could not begin to describe how excited he was to get alone time with Dean again. Yet, here he was sitting in Jody’s office on his lunchbreak.
“I’ll have you over soon. It’s small, but all I really need. Open downstairs, two bedrooms upstairs. The lake view is pleasant. However, it will need a bit of work. I suppose that is the tradeoff for such a low price.”
“No, Westport actually. When I got out of the service I decided to move here. My brother Gabriel lived here, and there was a veteran’s resource center. When Jack was born, I stayed because the rent was cheap and Anna had moved close by. How about you?”
Dean turned out to be a blessing. He asked about baseball, then got Alex talking about doing soccer in the fall. From there the conversation veered as he asked about Mary Poppins and other movies. All of it was light and happy. It brought smiles to the children’s faces until all their plates were cleared.
Castiel supposed they were, but not on purpose. He was wearing a button down and slacks. “You are right. How funny.” He held out his hand and looked him over. “I suppose it is time to set out. You have everything.”
“Oh, I… I’m sorry…” She sputtered out and then turned around to sit back down on the bench on the other side.
Dean sighed and took another drink of his beer. “Can we change the subject? Can’t Jo talk about college or something?”
“Shh… I don’t…” He let go of Alfie’s wrist, about ready to stand up when he heard what sounded like keys, and then… “Shit.”
“She was right,” Dean said. “I mean granted my bar for a good father is not that high, but Jack seems happy. And from what I seen you’d give June Cleaver a run for her money as far as parents go.”
The officers exchanged looks. Castiel briefly wondered if he was not acting the way they expected. He had held himself together when he had lost men before, and he was not about to cry over his brother in front of these strangers. Perhaps if it was Gabriel, but not over Luke. There was a reason he had been nicknamed Lucifer.
“Babysitting again?” Dean said as the children came to follow him to the window, but he didn’t wait for an answer as he began to examine it.
“And I will as long as you don’t complain about my apartment. Jack! Your dad’s here! Hide the cigarette’s and dirty magazines!”
“Do you remember the Easter where mom sent Luke and I to the store, but he came back with a bloody nose and black eye?”
Castiel did say that. He had finally upgraded from his well-loved Lincoln Continental to a brand-new Prius. “As long as you promise to be careful.” Castiel doesn’t quite care right now. He practically runs down the stairs and finds a granola bar and banana for Jack. After he checks his backpack, they are off in the car.
Any lightness on Castiel’s face just melted off. He tilted his head and furrowed his eyebrows. “Why would I not spend time with my child?”
A smile spread across Eileen’s face. “Did you meet Jack? I keep on offering to babysit, but I swear he only lets Jody watch him.”
He nodded knowingly as they both pulled out their phones to exchange contact information. It looked like he had gotten lucky yet again.
“It is very thoughtful.” Without saying a word, he began to unwrap the sandwich and take the lid off the soup to allow it cool. While Gabriel was the easiest of his siblings to get along with, he could be quite troublesome. He cared deeply about his siblings, but this was wrapped beneath many layers of jokes and antics. Over the years Castiel had learned to appreciate it. The letters, emails, and phone calls from Gabriel while he was overseas helped him forget—if only a few moments—all the violence and pain around him.
“Well shit, because I don’t usually do this whole dating thing. It’s usually a few beers and then sex.” Dean shrugged as he took a long drink from his glass of water. “I think that’s why Sam set me up with you.”
Both Cas and Dean stopped to chat but Dean waved Cas away saying he’d take care of whatever Sam needed.
Daddy and Papa had so much love that their little family of two turned into a little family of three. Daddy, Papa, and the Baby Ella loved each other more and more each day too.
Mackenzie was standing in front of him chirping away and then began to actually swing her arms in a circle while clapping. A literal round of applause. Where people like this come from, Dean didn’t know. Dean was still dumbfounded as Mackenzie grabbed two water bottles and a hidden bag of licorice off the counter. She gripped the nearby stool and pulled it across from Dean who was sitting on the physical therapy bench.
It wasn’t long before Dean was knocking on Mary’s door. Dean held a sleepy Jack in his arms with an overpacked diaper bag curtesy of Cas on his shoulder. Cas acted like Mary couldn’t just walk into Cas or Dean’s rooms if she needed something. Jack started opening his eyes and so Dean started cooing at Jack to lull him back to sleep. Jack’s eyes shut again and Dean breathed a sigh of relief. Jack Crisis 2.0 was averted.
Things became very real the morning of the fourth day. Jody, Donna, and Alex returned with bags and bags of groceries and supplies for the upcoming influx of people. Dean smiled as their supplies were set on the kitchen table including when Donna began to wring out her damp ponytail. The downpour outside started in the early morning hours and hadn’t ceased. Jody shook her head to dislodge some of the water but the rigidness of her shoulders tipped him off that something was wrong.
It was when they were sitting on the floor as Jack crawled around chasing blocks in the early afternoon after their visit to the ER that Dean brought the topic up. The wooden alphabet blocks were brightly colored and Jack loved when they were spaced out. He would crawl to them before bringing them to his mouth to slime them. It was as gross as it was cute.
Cas cringed at the subtle dig but smoothed out his shoulders quickly. Dean could see that he measured and weighed Naomi’s words. The longer Cas stayed silent, the more worried Dean became. The angel pressing the blade against Dean’s throat shifted slightly all too focused on the conversation in front of them and Dean felt it finally nick his skin.
Jack’s little body was exhausted after the fight it has just put up but he still managed to reach out one of his little hands and grab one of Dean’s when he had woken up. Dean stared at Jack’s face, mapping every inch like he was trying to preserve him at this age. Jack’s blue eyes were now lighter than Cas’s but you could only tell if you had spent a long time looking into both of their eyes. The fear of losing Jack still sat at the edge of his mind like a feral animal desperately trying to break free of its cage.  But there was happiness too from Jack’s small smile on his face as he gazed up at Dean.
The only response Dean gave was opening the door wider to invite Cas into his room for the first time in days and said, “Remind me to never take you or Sam to Vegas. Neither of you have a good poker face.”
Dean had stopped listening to Dr. Stern’s story about having to avoid his contagious and horny wife because he was still stuck on the no intimacy rule that had just been imposed on them. Yeah, they acted sorta like a couple anytime they were in town but it was to maintain their cover. They had only been here a little over three months and it seemed liked everyone in town already new about the “the cute gay couple with a baby that bought the old Wilmer place”. The newsletter made damn sure of that.
Eileen gave in a gave him a gentle kiss on the lips before she signed, “It’s nothing bad. I promise.”
“Save it. I already got an earful from Jody for the last two hours of the trip. Plus, Kaia and I are cool now. Right Kaia?”
A small black dot formed directly outside of the sphere. Dean had the urge to reach out and touch it like a damsel in a horror movie. Dean felt a hostile brush against his consciousness in the nothing space at the same moment. This brush caused him to recoil from the dot and retreat back to the safety of Cas. Cas either wasn’t paying attention to the creeping nothing or he decided to ignore it.
“Good eye, yeah it’s a ’69 302. Part of my collection. I don’t take her out to often because she’s in too good of condition to be a daily driver and I don’t have the time to repair small dings and dents. But with weather like this, even fools can be tempted.”
Cas didn’t let go of him. His gripped tightened a little. Dean looked to Cas’s hand clutched his bicep and then moved up his torso, over his face, over his lips until he met his eyes. He let Cas pull him back towards the table. Cas let go when Dean pulled his chair back to where he had been sitting.

Plus, it’s not like Dean wanted to come back to the bunker anyway! Dean wanted an out. He wanted to be with Cas and Jack. Rowena had used her big favor to try to get Dean to see what he wanted by trying to force his hand. Dean wanted to be with his two fallen angels and he needed a push from Sam to do it.
Sam didn’t even flinch when Dean called him up to fill him in on their cover story after they moved in. When he found out about Charlie’s prank/bet to “help” with the cover story, he rolled his eyes knowingly. Others made bets, others said it was finally happening, others said it was time. The news spread outwards and the whispers continued. But Sam knew. He knew better than to make a bet on that.
"Yeah, those were really good. I think we should have more dinners with vegan alertnatives if you're okay with cooking them," Sam replied happily.
Dean had been dozing off in the chair next to Cas’s bed thanks to the sound of rain hitting the window. His casted leg was stretched out in front of him giving a now familiar twinge of pain. His head had just hit his chest when he heard it.
When Eileen arrived at the bunker a few days later, a hesitant knock echoed throughout the room, Dean watched Sam’s hands trembled as he climbed the steps and reached to open the door. Sam had started his vigil by the staircase that morning and throughout the day, Dean, Cas, Jack, Mary had joined him as the clock ticked down the minutes to Eileen’s arrival.
The house was still a disheveled disaster but the windows let the late morning sunlight through. Mentally, Dean took notes about repairs but was happy to find there weren’t many more than he had expected. Watching Jack sit on the living room floor while chattering like a happy baby made everybody smile. Dean followed Cas from room to room as he analyzed the rooms in greater scrutiny. He hands ran along the doors and the ways. The few pieces of furniture that remained like the old spare guest bed that Cas claimed would stay with the house.
“Well it doesn’t change the fact that I sincerely appreciate that you are here. I’m just surprised that you said you haven’t been around kids.”
Dean followed Castiel out of the kitchen. He watched as he carefully placed them in the empty sink before the man pointed to the cabinet with the bowls and the drawer that held spoons. Castiel grabbed the shortcake, strawberries, and whipped cream before he went back to the kitchen. “Construct your own, but please make the whipped cream proportional Jack.”
Castiel had been crouching down, he rose and that’s when he felt his phone vibrate. While he normally would try to keep his phone usage a minimum around Jack, lately he’d at least check it. “One moment, Jack… Hello, Gabriel.”
“Shut up!” Castiel got to his feet, stalking over to his brother. Luke is a bit taller, but in the past few years Castiel had gained quite a bit of muscle. His brother was not a threat to him, not anymore.
Hello again! Unfortunately for the past week or so I've not had internet. I just got it back last night so here is the chapter, I will try to post on Saturday as well.
Without warning Castiel closed the gap between them, a hand went to the back of Dean’s head. There’s no hair to grab as Dean’s hair is shorter than his ever was, even in the service. Still, he used it to bring him even closer, to press their mouths together. It starts out relatively innocent, closed mouths, but Dean’s tongue pushed forward. Castiel tugged Dean toward him until he’s pressed against the window of the car, one hand of his on Dean’s head, and the other hooked into his belt loop.
Dean face dropped slightly. There was a scowl as he drained the glass of water like he wished it was something stronger. “I wanted a change, there was no handyman in North Cove. Besides if business gets slow, Bobby always has work for me to do.” He shrugged, then looked back at Cas with that teasing glint in his eyes. “Now that I have you as a customer, things won’t be slow.”
“I know, it’s…” Dean didn’t want to have this conversation now. Jack was just above him and it was late. All he wanted was to kick up his feet, make out, and watch a movie. Something was nagging him though. Nothing seemed to add up in his mind. He said he hadn’t been with a man since he was 20; he’d been in the military for quite a while; and then there was the fact that there was absence of pictures of Castiel with someone who could be Jack’s biological mother. “Never mind.”
Castiel watched in amazement as Jack smiled at Dean and built his own dessert. Dean was quick to come up with all sorts of stories to tell the two of them. They were silly stories about his time growing up with his younger brother. Listening he realized that Jack was not an excuse for him. Granted he didn’t know Dean very well, but at the bare minimum he seemed to not hate children. In fact, he was much better with him than his own brother Michael. All that meant to him was that the decision was his.
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.” Dean pulled the sandwiches from the Castiel’s backpack and handed them out.
The biggest puzzle to Castiel was if Dean had said something about him. Dean was attractive, but he hadn’t thought he’d given any inclination as to his sexual preferences. “Even though I provide counseling in my professional life, it does not carry over into my personal life.”
“Only if you want to.” Dean looked at him closely, as if he was taking the opportunity to study him closely as well.
Dean cut off Castiel’s words with a kiss. One hand kept on the back of the neck to hold him close. “I know we probably shouldn’t do much with Jack next door, but would something like that would be alright?”
“Gilda I’m afraid that you are on your own here. I have played quite a bit of poker. While Charlie and Ash may be a challenge, Dean will pose no problem to me.”
“No!” Gilda said. “That is so not fair to Castiel and I.” She leaned closer to Castiel. “Dean is a total scam artist when it comes to poker and those two…” She pointed to Charlie and Ash. “Are math geniuses.”
A few hours later Dean was elbow deep in a sink of hot water. Dinner had gone surprisingly well. Dean was surprised at how heartily Castiel dug into his burger, even going for a second. Jack seemed to be equally pleased, happy to make his own burger leading to ketchup smeared across his face and dripped onto his shirt.
So, they decorate cookies. Or Alfie does. Castiel is more practical in his decoration, more concerned with the ratio of frosting to cookie. Alfie is delighted by the fact that Castiel has loads of uncolored frosting and little vials of food dye. Every cookie is made with care. The Santa cookies with a red hat, pink dots on cheeks, and white beard. The reindeer has green sprinkles for eyes and a red smudge of frosting on the nose. Each Christmas tree has a unique string of frosting garland and sprinkle ornaments. Castiel could watch him do this for hours.
. It’s written in the neat handwriting with his number to follow. For some reason Castiel can’t help but hope that Dean will be something like Sam.
“Thanks.” Castiel reached for him, a warm hand settling on his thigh. “To this day I don’t know what happened, but the trauma of the accident combined with the birth was too much for Kelly. She died shortly after Jack was born.”
“The one that didn’t want to be around Jack. Oh, I remember.” To Gabriel that has to be the worst thing you could say about a person. His brother cherished Jack, to him the boy was an angel on earth. “You’ve never told me about liking men, and I’m oblivious to things like that. You should know that Luke told me.”
No matter how many times he watched Alex and Claire, it was hard to juggle all the children. Honestly each bedtime task should be an Olympic sport. Alex did say that she would help but she was only a year and half older than the other two, and Claire would reject any assistance. Somehow, he had them all tucked in to bed by 8:30 after reading to them from a book of children’s short stories. He kissed Jack on the forehead while Claire and Alex gave him a hug. The girls were snuggled into the trundle bed attached to Jack’s bed. He had felt odd about letting them sleep in Jack’s room, but he felt even worse making them sleep downstairs in his office’s daybed.
“I can try to get one of my siblings to come with me, but they’ve been busy. I would feel a bit guilty as it’s hard enough for them to make time to watch Jack like they normally do.”
“Jack?” he asked as he eyes rested on her swollen stomach. How big it had grown since he last saw her only a few weeks ago.
Dean texted him the address of Charlie’s apartment and told him not to worry about bringing anything. It felt wrong going empty handed so he made cookies. Even before Dean he baked. Emotions were difficult, but baking was simple mix of science and math. Why should he think of words when he could bring them something that spoke volumes? He made Anna lemon meringue pie whenever she had something to celebrate; Michael was a frequent recipient of his oatmeal raisin cookies when he complained about a difficult work week. For Gabriel he would bring a chocolate cake as a token of appreciation. Now he was showing up with a plate full of snickerdoodles because Jack had requested them for home and making a double batch was the easiest thing to do.
“Thank you, Jack, it is very nice of you to say.” Jody looked at her daughter who stuck her tongue out at her friend as soon as Castiel wasn’t looking. “Claire do you like dinner?”
The officers took him to the hospital and helped him bypass the nurses that insisted only family could come. Castiel knew that Kelly had no family that would come. She often spoke of her strained relationship with her parents to him. Telling him how disappointed they were that she was still with Luke and how she needed to find a nice man. How she should move closer, get a career more stable than chief of staff to some state senator. Surprisingly she was awake he finally reached her room.“Cas…” Her voice was weak. “Did you see Luke?”
“What? No, just the roof is fine…” He stopped and tilted his head. “Oh, you meant that. The children are insisting that the floor is lava. Have you heard of such a thing?”
“Have you had burgers, kid?” he questioned. “Like a cheeseburger fresh off the grill with bacon? That is my favorite food.”
“Yes, are they causing trouble?” Castiel sat up a bit straighter, eyes surveying the children. All three were in sight along with another little girl who Alex appeared to be chattering with.
Alfie. He was also an accounting major, and Castiel hadn’t been this head over heels even with his high school girlfriend. He had adorable elfin features and bright eyes. He was self-assured and could carry a conversation for the both of them. Both had little experience with men and relationships in general. They kept their relationship quiet, though, they did spend a lot of time behind the locked door of Alfie’s dorm. That hadn't gone unnoticed by some of the other residents. The two of them hadn’t had any serious talks. There was no asking what they meant to each other, but the both of them had not seen anyone else. Castiel knew that was all he could expect, at least for now. Things would not be pleasant if his ROTC leader found out that he was dating a man.
“Cas, what’s wrong? I want you. Please hold me down, finger me, fuck me,” Alfie pleaded. From the look in his eyes it’s as if he thinks what Castiel is doing is a game.
“It wouldn’t be ideal because I know you want to be with them, but I’m more than willing to take all of them myself.”
“I liked the pie better,” he replied as he followed the check and slid it in his pocket. “Thanks again for dinner, I should really be heading out.”
“No but very good with threats. Come on, Clarence. A guy like this needs someone like you. You don’t let anyone get underneath your skin and quite frankly he could use some of your tough love.”
“Dean Winchester.” He stuck out his hand to shake the man’s and was surprised at the firmness of the handshake. Surprised that the hands weren’t all that smooth. He held Castiel’s hand for a second too long, but he didn’t exactly want to let go.
Castiel looked down at the food and thought it would be better to eat something first. Goodness knows once he started talking, Gabriel wouldn’t let him stop until he finished. “First of all, you should know it’s not a
“Can I give you a hug?” He waited until they said yes and he gave them all a hug at once, holding his arm out for Jack. “Why don’t you all watch a movie while I clean up and finish dinner? It will be a little late so you guys can have dessert first.”
“Well, when I was a solider, I had some really scary stuff happen to me. When I think about it or something makes me remember it, I can get mad or scared. You know how your mom took Jack to see fireworks with you? Well, fireworks are one of those things I don’t like. The sound of the window breaking makes me feel the same way.”
Castiel nodded and held it out to her. There was no passcode so she opened up his camera app. “What are you doing?”
Jody sighed again. She had looked so tired before, but now there was almost a look of pity crossing her face. “Cas I couldn’t ask you to do that. The kids are such a handful—”
Castiel wanted to say something more, but Jack pulled on his arm to ask a question. Though he had recoiled at Sam’s suggestion at first, maybe Dean wouldn’t be that bad.
“We shouldn’t speak ill of the dead.” Castiel looked at his younger sister and she wrapped her arms around him, knowing she had to be the one to initiate the affection. “How am I supposed to care for a baby? I live in a one-bedroom apartment, the VA has me in therapy twice a week, and I have a dead-end bookkeeper job.”
It’s Dean that ended up contacting Castiel. He received the text message during staff meeting. Typically, the only person that would text him during the day would be one of his siblings contacting him about Jack. His coworkers knew this and don’t bat an eye when he briefly opened the phone he kept flat on the table.
Sam rolled his eyes as he leaned forward. “Bobby and Ellen are doing a fourth of July thing this weekend since it falls on a Wednesday. We have a bunch of people there, and I thought you and Jack could come.”
“Cassie, I’m sorry but the Sunday morning baker called out. I have to cover the first shift of the morning.” That meant he would be starting at 2:00 AM, and he probably be going to bed around six. Typically, a baker’s schedule worked quite well for a babysitter. Gabriel frequently watched Jack because he got off around 1:00 pm and Castiel didn’t work that late so he could still get plenty of sleep for his next shift.
“Ooh scary dad voice.” He had a smirk on his face. “And we don’t gossip. Anna is the only one that will tell me anything. Getting information out of you and Michael is like… I can’t think of a comparison, but it’s hard. The only reason I know anything about you is because of Jack.”
After placing the pie on the counter, he grabbed the two six packs from the fridge and walked outside. Ellen and Bobby are arguing over the grill. He dropped the beer on the picnic table.
“Ignore him we’re all at the kitchen table.” She led him to the other end of the living room where there was a large table. “My girlfriend, Gilda…” She pointed to a petite brunette woman. “And my roommate Ash.” She pointed to a man with an unusual hairstyle.
He looked around. It’s mainly clutter: stacks of books, shoes, a pile of unfolded clean laundry. “You all promised to help me.”
“Parents get stressed out; it happens.” Dean did not take his eyes off the window as he pulled out a tape measure.
“Cas, it was just an excuse to spend the day with you.” Dean reached his hand forward, as if to grab Cas’s resting on the table. He stopped when a woman walked up to the table.
“What do you mean finally?” The secrecy had been burdening him for some time. He was taken aback to have the information so hard to give, taken so lightly. This was something he had worried about telling his family, afraid of a reaction like Luke's even though every ounce of common sense within him told him they would be more accepting. With Jody and Sam it just came out naturally, it didn’t feel like he was coming out. They never made a big deal out of it either.
As he pulled in the parking lot, he saw the rain starting to sprinkle. His trench coat was in the back and he was thankful for the jacket he packed for Jack. The two trekked across the parking lot and upon entering the building his eyes great fully landed on the table laden with coffee and cookies. “Only one cookie today,” he whispered to the child as he stopped.
“Well come on. Benny and Andrea are both working right now. I told him we were coming so he’s making us something special.”
“Her and Bobby go way back. I don’t see her as much anymore. She has her hands full since she adopted the girls.” Dean pushed off the counter. “I think food is on.”
“Castiel Novak. That is Jack,” he said as he added cream and sugar to his coffee. “I have not seen you around here before. Are you here for group? Perhaps you need to question someone…” The only person that would step foot in here in a full suit had to be an FBI Agent or perhaps an uptight police detective.
“You drove baby Jack around in a Pimpmobile.” Dean put his hand on the back of the seat, fingers brushing against Castiel’s shoulder as he turned his head and put his arm on the seat to reverse the car. “And you still have that car?”
Today it was quiet when he knocked on the door. Castiel answered, looking more relaxed even if he’s still dressed in business casual. The next thing he noticed is the warm smell of cinnamon in the air.
It’s no use the front door led directly to the living room. “Holy shit. I wish I had a camera to document the loss of virginity.”
“It wasn’t stress. The sound of the ball coming through the window…” He didn’t finish, instead he walked a bit closer and looked at shattered window pane. “Do you need help?”
Castiel showed up at Jody’s when she was clearing away the dinner dishes from the table. He had been invited to one of the support group’s monthly potlucks, and it was the sheriff’s night off so she volunteered to watch Jack.
That night when Castiel was lying in bed he tries to think of the answer to the question. He couldn’t dream up any physical characteristics, but instead sketched the type of person he wanted. First and foremost, would be someone that would love Jack as their own. He wanted someone confident and not afraid to stand their ground against him. He needed someone more open, not afraid to love. As he laid there he briefly wondered if it wasn’t a woman. It was something that he had not allowed himself to consider since college, since before he had gone into the military. He decided then if he was lucky enough to have someone drop in his life, he would take a chance.
“Uh, yeah I did…” He reached for a beer and smashed it against the table to get the top off before taking a long drag. He recalled the kid mentioning Mrs. Mills. North Cove was small, so it wasn’t that weird that Castiel was friends with her.
Jack was unusually hyper the day of the barbeque. Usually, he didn’t get like this unless he was around other kids, but he supposed it was the excitement of the day. Barbeques were a bit casual for the Novak family. While his father was laid back about everything, his mother was higher strung. A habit that Michael unfortunately picked up on, and now—as a married man—he took it upon himself to hold the get togethers which were usually dinner parties.
Castiel felt a knot grow in his stomach. It wasn’t something that he talked about all that much outside of his therapist and the people that were in his group therapy meetings. “Five years and one month,” he responded. The date was easy enough to remember. The last drink he ever had was the whiskey the day Jack was born. “Most people can’t tell. Are you—”
“Because the girls that Sam has set me up with before have all been the same. Busy and caught up in their own lives, looking for something casual. Ever since Sam proposed to Eileen it’s like he expects me to settle down too.”
“Not unless you want to hear about the personal lives of the North Cove PD and how they are way too entwined with their professional lives.” She rolled her eyes. “Or you want to hear about the exciting results of children’s sports?”
“I never stay away from Ellen’s cooking.” He winked and gave her a hug before clapping a hand on Bobby’s shoulder. “I just had some work to finish up.”
Castiel watched to make sure he was safely buckled in in the back and sat up a bit straighter in his seat to look in the mirror. “I thought we would have that picnic by the lake today since I got done so early.”
“I tried dating. If you remember Meg.” He smiled fondly remembering the passionate, sharp-witted woman. The handful of dates they went on were some of the best he’d ever had, but there was something holding him back. Meg broke it off saying she was ready to settle down and that wasn’t fair to Jack.
“Not at all.” Dean doesn’t leave, instead he grabbed a bottle of water for himself leaning against the counter. “How long has it been?”
“Be careful, don’t play too close to the house but stay in sight of the kitchen windows,” he said and then looked to Alex. “Please keep an eye on them.”
When Castiel awoke the next morning, it was early like usual. Sleep had come easy, though, after he had told Dean everything. To his credit the man didn’t look at him with sympathy, just understanding. Beside him Dean was still sleeping soundly, covers wrapped around him tightly. Even after he took a shower, he was still undisturbed. He dug around in his nightstand to find pen and paper. Then he wrote:
