Now he had a gold band of his own, a thin band of platinum running through it and an inscription in Elvish John swore meant ‘My Good in the World’ but Sherlock didn’t want to check because that would mean taking it off. And it was
“The sun will rise soon,” Mycroft said. Everyone went silent. “You all know what we must do, and the cost of failure. May the Powers bless our efforts, and I hope to see you all soon.” His eyes flickered to Sherlock.
"Our first Christmas together?" Holmes finished. "Never." He swallowed guiltily. "I'm sorry John, I should have explained, I don't know why I didn't."
"It wasn't me," Sherlock said. "Call an ambulance." He snatched up the book and glared down at the security guard. " Tell them they needn't hurry."
Count Magnussen thought. “I’ve heard rumours,” he said slowly, “of a man in a village with hair like darkest night and eyes like winter sun.”
Then John swore and pulled him down into a kiss, and the warmth flooded through Sherlock’s entire body. He let go of John’s hands, lacing them in his hair instead, and John was tugging on his curls. And when they pulled away Sherlock’s eyes were shining, and he was beautiful. Tenth in the world.
"Of course you do," Sherlock said with a strangled laugh. "You've surprised me from the day we met, with everything you are. That's quite a reliable trend at this point, wouldn't you say? And more to the point—" he kept his arms firmly around John even as he tried to step away, "there's so much more I want to do with you, all around the world, in London, at home. There's thousands of things left to learn about each other. I want to see what you're like in two months, in two years, in two decades. I want to see what you become, and what we become together. All those possibilities, how could that ever be boring?"
He would stand there, and try to give people a show, and they would boo. His mother said they were afraid of him, but Grezzik didn’t understand. He’d never hurt anyone, not on purpose. He loved people, and all they could do was boo.
I know Inigo killed Rugen in the movie with his sword, but this is actually how he dies in the book, and I like this version better, a man who dedicated his life to pain dying of fear, in agony. Brilliant.
King Lotharon obeyed, sinking into a chair. “Are you sure of this?” he asked. He was looking at Sally.
But it wasn't either child. It was two men holding hands, both who looked oddly familiar. They reminded Sherlock of—oh.
From the moment Kitty and Stan met, they'd begun sniping at each other. In Stan's defence, he couldn't have known that Kitty abhorred anything to do with Brontë, so beginning a conversation with a Jane Eyre quote was a mistake, hardly malicious.
But twelve hours and every tincture came and went too, and Sally was now pale and drained. Her whole body was drenched with sweat, but Anderson hadn’t let her go. He kept his arms around her, but he closed his eyes every time she groaned in pain.
John turned to him, a bundle over his shoulder. “I’m glad you think so.” He started for the door, but Sherlock stopped him.
They dozed off together in the later afternoon, John’s hand firmly around Sherlock’s wrist so he’d wake up immediately if he moved. The detective didn’t stir, however, and when John woke up it was getting dark. Sherlock was staring at him intently.
John crossed his arms and waited. When no answer came a moment later, he asked, "so how long, then?"
"I think you may have one," John started, then cringed as the doorbell rang three times downstairs. "Make that two." He stood. "That's Mrs. Hudson, I'd better go explain what's going on."
So this conversation takes place both post- and pre-sex, but that is not the focus of the chapter. Just wanted to give a heads up.
“It is far from the royal chambers,” Mycroft admitted. “I don’t know if everyone would be particularly happy about it, but so long as there is one human witness it will be true before the Powers.”
Billy has some questions--his grandfathers have stories. Kitty's...a little amused. Holmes and Watson are still in trouble.
“I’ve managed perfectly well until now, Doctor. Even after…well, but that’s done now.” Miss Winter shook her head.
“I’m sorry, love.” John actually looked tired. “But it really is the quickest way through, and I’ll protect you.”
Hopkins let out a cry of joy, leapt up, danced about the room, then hugged Holmes and Watson in quick succession. "Healthy! The baby's healthy! Kitty?" he asked, suddenly anxious.
“Of course!” Ireni clapped her hands. “Yes, that’s perfectly possible. There are a few different ways to do that, but the simplest is a potion. Do you have any preference as to who is the sire?”
"Right, you two didn't have the telly!" John looked rather excited. "I wonder if we can watch what we like, there's so much I think you'd enjoy!"
John stepped forward, but her eyes were open again, wild with a grief John would never understand. “What do you want from me, Princess?! You want your revenge on Jamiarty for your beloved?”
Moran bowed. “My name is Lord Sebastian Moran, Spymaster for Prince Jamiarty. I was entrusted with the Prince’s secret plan to murder Princess Sherlock of London, after which I read his book of deeds, all foul in nature. I am guilty of crimes in the Prince’s name, your Majesty. But I never thought it was treason. I never knew I was abetting the murderer of a child.”
Sherlock reached for a stick, wishing he had a knife, but then he had an idea. Taking careful aim, and using all the force he could muster, he knocked the rat into the Snow Sand. The creature made one horrible shriek and then it vanished into the sand.
Molly blinked. Ireni was right; they were nearly at the docks. Anderson stood there, and when Grezzik raised Waverly up, he fell to his knees.
Holmes fidgeted under his hands. “Not planning, perhaps—merely preparing for eventualities.” He looked directly into Watson’s eyes, gaze serious. “John, I want to spend time with you while we are both still healthy. You will regain your strength, we can dabble in hobbies and consult from afar should things become exceedingly dire.”
“So do I! There’s so much out there, it’s a crime we don’t know about it! I swear I’m going to leave this place someday.” Sherlock leaned forward excitedly. Too close, and Watson’s eyes went huge. “Sorry.”
“Thank you, sir.” Anderson had removed his guard uniform, and was wearing a simple white shirt and breeches. “I’ve brought all the intel you requested.”
Holmes kissed him for a long moment, longer than they ever could have in London. When they broke apart Holmes' eyes seemed darker than usual. He helped Watson to his feet. "Do you want to try now? I...I don't wish to lose my nerve."
“She’s not going to get much chance at that if we don’t sort out this mess with Jamiarty,” Sally sighed. The little hope she’d had vanished. Even if her daughter came back, she would never be safe. Jamiarty wouldn’t stop trying to go to war, and they would have to run. Only Sally didn’t want to run. Florin was her rightful home, and she missed it. It would be beautiful now in the Kingswood. Being a Carrier meant standing around waiting for a same-sex royal couple, and Sally used to spend most of her time in the garden. The King had sometimes come to see them, and he always brought sweets. He was the one to tell Sally she’d been chosen as Jamiarty’s Carrier, and he’d brought her a huge bag of lemon drops, her favourite. “You’ll Carry Sherlock’s baby, of course,” he’d assured her. “It wouldn’t…well, it’s better that you carry his.”
Sherlock's whole body went cold. He raised his arm and checked the time listlessly. 5 AM. 0500 hours, as John put it, or oh-Christ-hundred-hours when they were up too late.
The story came out slowly, including several detours and one long, impassioned scolding about “not telling me the neighbours were assassins!” Sherlock took the time to eat his whole plate, even stealing John’s last piece of toast.
“I can’t imagine that sort of situation arising,” Ireni said lightly. Though she felt a pang. It might be nice to spend time with a child. They always said such fascinating things, and she could guide them to whatever they wanted to do. If she didn’t know how to do something, she would learn.
So did Jamiarty. He went down, and Sherlock let out a triumphant cry that sent a shudder through Sally. She spared a quick look at her half-brother, saw him securely pinned by Sherlock, and bowed her head to her father.
“It’s a good thing you’re not the threat, Sukiv,” Savira said. “But I agree—the Archenlandian war ships can sail to Florin the moment I send word.”
John seized Moriarty by the lapels, holding him close to the edge, heart racing with panic. "And if I throw you off?"
Holmes’ voice softened. “You’ll be alright,” he promised. “It’s not pleasant, but you’ll be on your feet soon—” His voice cut off with a gasp.
“Secondly,” Holmes said, determined not to be put off by Watson's lack of interest, “I am no patriot. I care for my country, I suppose, but I do not work for Her Majesty any more than I work for our poorest client—all are equal. There may be no other city such as London in the world, but I am loyal to the city alone. My accepting a knighthood would be tantamount to hypocrisy, and I won't do it.”
There was a rumble from afar, and the man in black looked up. Sherlock did too, saw the royal horses.
The hotel was far more posh than John had ever seen, but Sherlock's parents had insisted on paying for the honeymoon. The lobby seemed to be lined with gold, and John's shoes felt far shabbier than ever as he walked across it.
Sherlock stopped taking drugs after he and John started dating. He didn’t need them anymore; there was plenty of rush from being in love.
John wished he'd known better three weeks ago, the first time he'd introduced the two. He'd thought that his adopted daughter, who got along with nice people just as well as she destroyed bad people, might enjoy Stan's company. Sherlock had taken the young Inspector under his wing, and he'd agreed that Kitty and Stan would make an excellent team.
“I don’t want to get married,” he sobbed to Magnussen. “I’ll have some horrible wife that I have to impregnate and have a child with.”
Billy’s tears fell, and Kitty choked on her own sob. Watson tilted Billy’s chin up. “Lad, don’t be scared. It’s going to be alright.”
So Holmes continued to talk, deducing without thinking about it. In between strangers, he observed Watson closely.
Kitty sighed. She took Stan's hand absentmindedly. "I dunno, Dad, we...well, we liked each other, so we agreed to meet up for a date. You know, just to see. I didn't realize that he was ‘Hopkins’ until he told me his last name. Then I told him who I was, and..."
When they got to the little cottage Kitty almost burst into tears. There were two strange women there. They introduced themselves as Mrs. Riley and her daughter Gertie. Her fathers had written about them occasionally, and Kitty was grateful that the women had been there to help, but she had an idea about the damage they'd caused. Her fears were confirmed when she went inside and found Holmes in the guest room, shaking miserably, and Watson in the other room. The other bed was turned over to look like a table, a security feature Stan had insisted on when he built the cottage beds. Kitty had always hoped her fathers would never feel so cornered, and certainly not when they were deathly ill. Who'd fallen ill first, she wondered, and who knew that they couldn't be found together?
It was Grezzik’s quiet voice that broke the silence. The giant was still trembling, but his voice was confident. “She is frightened, but alive. The woman hasn’t hurt her.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes—marriage apparently hadn’t softened his attitude towards stupid questions. Without even knocking, he drew a card from his pocket and swiped it. The door swung open.
John considered him for a moment. “You saved my life,” he said hoarsely, “I think you can call me John.”
“And Mycroft and I will handle the rest,” Greg finished. He stood up. “Don’t worry, John. We’ll give you a good wedding. God knows you deserve one.”
This chapter's going to start off a small Mystrade trilogy (don't worry, John and Sherlock will feature in both timelines.) The next chapter will be up tomorrow, and the third on Christmas Day. Happy reading!
Anderson shook his head. “It’s not that—it doesn’t hurt so much. But I…I’m going to be King, and I have no idea how to do that.”
Maria had never forgotten his face. She’d forgotten so much in the work and the hunt and the wine…how her childhood home looked, the names of her teachers, the way it felt to be happy…but she’d always remembered his face.
Ireni took the bag and pulled the drawstrings open. A white powder lay inside, and she sniffed carefully.
“The Prince gave orders you bitch!” Another Brute launched at her, and her sword flashed. He howled, pressing a hand to his arm.
, there were words woven deep into the melody; not lyrics or libretto, but words that were music in themselves, words like
And what if she wasn’t his daughter? What if she and the others were wrong after all? What would the King say, to see a Carrier stand and pretend to be a Princess?
“That was the first time. And you didn’t go after John and Sherlock, did you? Even though you were still alive?” Molly narrowed her eyes. “Unless this is some long, drawn-out plan to get revenge, in which case you’re stupider than I thought.”
It was a summer night in 1903, the sky deeply black and sprinkled with stars, when Watson was shaken awake by Holmes.
The crash had come from a tea cup (John winced, it was one of Mrs. Hudson's favourite teacups). Its shattered remains were now on the floor next to the table where it had been sitting, quite away from the edge. It shouldn't have fallen on its own.
Holmes thought telling Watson how he felt would be the most terrifying thing he’d ever done. Then he stood outside the door to the Stranger’s Room at the Diogenes Club for three hours
“Not really,” Molly said truthfully. The first few days she knew Ireni had been a booze-filled haze, and the month after that of painful withdrawal didn’t bear thinking about.
Holmes looked about, but he couldn’t see any sign of land, nor even another ship. “Which is where, exactly?”
John got to his feet shakily, looking around with growing dread. He was on the roof of an all-too familiar building. He and Mike had come up here to smoke sometimes, in brash defiance of their teachers, their own
John held him as tightly as he could, standing just a bit on tiptoe to make sure that Sherlock felt as safe as possible. “It’s drugs, dear,” he whispered. “It has to be.”
When he opened them again, it was because Sherlock was pulling at his arm. “John, wake up, we’re here!”
Mycroft attempted to bring him out of it by bringing him into village meetings, but after realizing how amazing John was, the problems of petty idiots were even more dull. No, Sherlock resigned himself to being gloomy and sitting in the stables with Skull until John came back.
Maria leaned her head against the wall, the cool stone wall for one moment. One last moment, before one last try.
“What an interesting name.” Queen Bella rocked Waverly, smiling at her. “You have your grandfather’s face, little one.”
Holmes took his hand. “Your husband took care of mine,” he said softly. “I am happy to return the favour.”
When Sherlock reached the middle of a wood, he paused, trying to decide if he should ride all the way to the shore. It would make him late for dinner, which the Prince disliked, but he felt an aching need to see something bigger than himself, to look across the shore and not even see Guilder.
It really didn’t bear thinking about. She was a Carrier. That was all she was. She couldn’t be a Queen…
Sherlock took John's hands in his; they were trembling now. John was starting to get very scared indeed.
They laid there for hours, breaths growing shorter. Finally, just before dawn, they closed their eyes.
“You know what’s interesting about you and Grezzik?” Ireni said. “You were the ones who had to work for me, to put up with all that nonsense and all that risk, yet you are determined to give your favours to someone else.”
Now she ran, and there was more than Waverly in her mind. With every blast of pain she saw something new—her childhood where she never knew her father, an empty grave, the pain in her father’s eyes, and her people. All her people, suffering under a murderous Prince.
"She's doing beautifully," Watson said with no small amount of relief. The wild-eyed, delighted young woman upstairs was miles from the shadow of his wife after giving birth to their daughter. "Come on up, then, so you can meet your son, and see about getting your wife some rest."
Stan often consults with Kitty on cases he gets stumped with. When the two of them can’t come up with an answer after a pot of tea, they go to Holmes and Watson.
“I don’t believe I can help with that,” Holmes replied. His hands fidgeted. “How are you holding up mentally?”
Hope everyone who celebrates Christmas has a great one, and for everyone else have a lovely day tomorrow and I hope your holiday is wonderful.
“Will that get you in the door in London?” Lady Culverton asked. She was the coolest head on the Council. “I don’t believe Duke Mycroft approves of slavery.”
“Probably a local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at midnight through eel-infested waters,” Ireni said. She examined her nails. “The night air is supposedly good for your skin.”
When the door was shut Grezzik walked down the hall. The effort of the day was finally catching up with him, and his arms ached. Clearly he’d gotten out of shape in the last year; he might soon have to begin exercising.
“Whereas what was important to notice about you was that you’d let him into crime scenes, you would pick up when he called and that you’ve always been afraid of snakes.”
John laughed out loud. "I think that's the best idea you've ever had, husband. Come on, I've got a list of things I've thought up, since this is a special occasion."
“He’s packing Waverly’s bag,” Sally replied. She was shifting foot to foot, looking uncomfortable wearing boots again. “He remembers more than I do.” She trembled.
Miracle Max’s salve had dealt with a lot of the burns, and the pain was nothing. The effort of moving the oars was nothing. All that mattered now was getting to Waverly, who was getting further away.
"Mummy, Grandad John and Sherlock told me all about being a detective! And it sounds more fun than being a policeman, and they found lost jewels in a goose and saved a lady from being buried alive and they run about all over London and can I be a detective too?"
"I know, but...you're a few years younger, and that does make a difference with this sort of thing. I may not be...capable, of giving you much pleasure."
“Feels like it.” John cleared his throat. “So since it’s a small wedding, there won’t be much for you to do—we’ve got a place picked out, Mrs. Hudson is insisting on cooking…”
It took a few telegrams and one long phone call (“hang the expense”) to determine that Mycroft was indeed recovering from a terrible bout of pneumonia. Mycroft’s health improved as the summer approached.
Really gone. John had examined his body himself, checking for a scar he’d noticed at the Pool; a small one, just under his chin, but noticeable, difficult to replicate. It was there.
Now, confession time, I was not that big of a Johnlock shipper before I wrote 'Sleeping on It', and even when I started this series of oneshots I was still on the fence. But I got so many great comments, and astounding responses, and prompts...I never thought I'd write Molly/Mike or Winkin (still FIGHT ME), Rachel and Billy didn't exist in my mind, and I honestly never thought that I would create such a large universe for a ship I wasn't committed to. Welp. I am now, and I think that's the coolest thing about writing, is that if you give an idea a chance, it can really change your feelings.
They were trained to the utmost of her ability, but in that moment, after five years of brandy and so long without a real challenge, the man in black had the advantage.
Mrs. Hudson was well aware that Sherlock and John wanted two bedrooms when they first moved in. She was also well aware that they wouldn’t need them long.
But the listener insisted, and the master obeyed. He sang softly, spinning them around their home, stepping carefully, hiding nothing, missing nothing. He watched his listener's face as they danced, singing their life together into a dance.
Watson startled. "Of course, Sherlock. I can remember my own anniversary." He glanced at his partner. "What is it? Do you not want to have the family here?”
Greg wished briefly for the ground to swallow him, but with his luck he'd end up in China without a passport.
The Reichenbach conclusion. Warning for character death (though if you know me by now you'll probably guess it isn't someone anyone cares about.
“I’ll send him a message,” Sherlock answered. John’s eyes were boring into him but this wasn’t the time for answers. He could explain his mad, computer-minded extrovert of a brother later. “Has there been anything on the news?”
"Hope you weren't always watching," John muttered. Sherlock fought very hard not to blush. “So it was…it was you?”
It was sort of true—he’d done a minor in music years ago in uni—but that was beside the point. “You know
“Well, more that you have any claim at all upon him. Prince Jamiarty doesn’t like to share. As for me, I want you to know that this isn’t personal at all. You seem like a worthy man. But one must be practical.”
John bit his lip, worry curling in his stomach again at the thought of baring himself completely, physical and emotional insecurities on display. "I'm just...I want to be good for you."
Ireni glared. “Pick up one of those rocks, and hide behind a boulder. The moment the man in black comes around the corner, HIT HIM WITH THE ROCK!”
Lestrade and the others had managed to round up ten of the other seventeen, and with Lisa Stark’s contact list it wouldn’t be long for the rest. John sat next to Sherlock, wrapped together in a shock blanket (“for my bloody peace of mine,
, we can prove that Jamiarty murdered their sister. And now I’ll be King, and there’s no way I’ll be any good, and Sally will see that and hate me, and I want to support her and our daughter but maybe it would be better if I just went away—”
Sherlock walked from the palace steps towards the stables, letting people stare at him, let them brush their hands against his arms. They were so awed by his presence that none dared speak, which was good. He had no words for them. He had very few words to spare anymore.
“Dear, we are fathers, remember? And that was by our children’s choice—they didn’t need to pick us.” John was still proud of that, still in awe that people like Kitty and Stan wanted him in their lives at all, much less as a parent.
“Why not?” Sherlock asked, stepping forward, away from the knives. “You can’t hurt me. John and I are bound by love, and you can’t break that with a thousand swords. It’s the two of us against the rest of the world, and always will be. And when I say you are a coward, it’s because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth, no matter how often you hunt!”
Sherlock hesitated only a second. If this wasn’t the right time, when would it be? “Did Harry do anything like that?”
He tried just lifting things (and people): “Booo!” He tried dancing: “booo!” He tried to stop performing all together and just pull the caravans, and the group threatened to fire him. People were coming to see him, even if all they did was boo.
"Are you sure, Father?" Kitty asked him. Watson wondered briefly how he'd grown so used to her calling them that, how easily he could tell which one she was addressing, despite them sharing the title.
It was strange—six months ago, Molly would have predicted she’d be fighting a war right now, not helping deliver a child. After all, she’d participated in the kidnapping of Prince Jamiarty’s intended, and killed his best friend. True, the best friend had murdered her father twenty years before, and the Prince was going to kill Sherlock, but Jamiarty was never one to understand subtleties.
“Sherlock, dear,” John said, speaking slowly and clearly, “this is what we do. We solve crimes together. Sounds like a fun case…”
“No,” Sherlock corrected. “Sally’s many things. A coward’s not one of them. She wants to be out of my reach, but she also doesn’t want to be anywhere near a place that makes her make this kind of mistake.”
Cerise stared at Moran. “I wondered,” she whispered. “Carla was darker than I ever was, and I wondered why my baby was so pale in death.” She turned on Jamiarty. “
“To the death. The only reason I took the baby is because it wouldn’t hurt his plans. I would miss him, but he doesn’t need me.”
“After they’ve been told that Prince Jamiarty was going to murder Princess Sherlock, and they would be framed for the crime? Absolutely,” Anderson answered.
I considered this for a moment. “Kitty’s a grown woman,” I said. “And unfortunately she may be a better judge of men than we can be.”
"Sherlock, you're all going to die if I don't." Moriarty was laughing softly in the ear without a phone pressed frantically against it, but John could barely hear him. “I can’t—dear, I can’t do that.”
Sherlock remembered now; her aunt was the one who raised her. The King had fallen for two sisters, how interesting.
For the first time Riley started to fidget. “He wants to take over Guilder, but he needs a new source of war. He decided to take back the Carrier slut, but he knew you wouldn’t give her up.”
“Not at all,” Mycroft interrupted, as gently as he could. “I write very few letters; I would be happy to expand my correspondence. What do you wish for me to write about?”
But this telegram wasn’t from Stanley Hopkins. It was from Detective Inspector Lestrade, asking if he could stop by the Diogenes Club that evening.
“I demand to be treated properly! I am a Prince, and I worked against my country. I murdered members of the Royal Family. I demand my right to die!”
Grezzik was okay with leaving. He wanted to go home. But that week, his father became ill, and his mother did too. They were dead by the end of the week, and Grezzik dug their graves before he followed the group to the next town. He was too big to fit in the caravans any more, and it was pouring rain, but Grezzik didn’t mind. He had to think.
Watson waved his hand and smiled. “Mycroft going so far as Plymouth? Such a case must be highly interesting, or at the least dangerous. I refuse to let you go alone whichever is the case.”
“Do you think they have days like this?” Holmes asked quietly. “Days when they can just be and not…not worry about anything?”
"Anyways, again, not all the dimensions are caught up with each other. Stupid, really. Just so we're clear, there was nothing wrong with the way you two loved each other. Nothing at all. We were all quite happy with the way things turned out after we…showed you each other." David beamed. "Nothing better than watching real love, it never gets old. "
They’re both careful about going too fast; there are too many scars to uncover them all at once. Nevertheless, by their first anniversary they’re looking at a flat together.
When they reached the Pit of Despair, the woman was already there, her head pressed to Watson’s chest. She stood up when the giant entered. “Grezzik?” There was terrible hope in her eyes, the kind that might break you even if it is fulfilled.
Sally was packing his clothes for him for the honeymoon. She would hold up a garment and Sherlock would either nod or shake his head. They’d been at it for hours.
For answer, Holmes came closer. Gently, he lifted John into a sitting position, just long enough to settle himself in. John leaned against the other man, sighing in relief. It had only been a few days, but he hadn’t realized how big a difference human contact would make.
The first attempt had failed, but you didn’t give up on a prize like war with Guilder because of a common pirate. Now Watson was in the Count’s clutches, and the kingdom had grown to adore Sherlock, to believe in their love story. The outrage and grief when Sherlock was strangled on their wedding night would be beautiful. It really had worked out for the best.
Well, that concludes this story (I say as I have a few more chapters planned but will be posting much later). I hope everyone enjoyed this.
John stepped forward, making sure to keep Hopkins out of view. "Go on, Blackwater. Show us a pirouette or two."
Some headcanons I've developed for the Victorian era. If anyone wants me to expand on any of them, let me know!
“So you haven’t…you don’t want to kill the child you have. Or you would have done it quicker.” Sherlock’s voice faltered, but he pressed on. “And you don’t want the child held for ransom either, or you would be bringing it to your friend. No, you want to keep the child alive and with you. And you’re aware of how old the child is, or nearly. Babies that age can’t go for very long without provisions.”
“I know that story too, but I just thought this was his real first one, and he was ashamed. It’s a cowardly way to kill.”
The girl was lying on the ground groaning, glass in her curly brown hair and streaks of blood marring her dark skin. She was still conscious, but the nasty looking twist to her ankle told John at a glance that she wouldn't be running away. Which was grand, because he wasn't exactly going to let her get away without explaining two things. One, how she'd even gotten as high as the window of a first floor, and two, why she'd done it in the first place.
“One of my guards—well, I suppose he was one of Moran’s guards, really. The second we heard that, we knew we’d have to act fast.” Janine gestured behind her, and Molly saw several cloaked figures.
"Or else I'll tell Sherlock once he's calmed down that the best way he could show his support for you and Mycroft being together would be for him to stand in front of the entire Yard staff and make a declaration."
“Where’s that fool husband of hers?” Max snarled. “At this rate the child will be blessed before its father comes!”
“Well, this is just the outside. The inside is much nicer, and that’s all Kitty’s doing, of course.”
John heard a gasp and turned to see a tall, thin man sitting in the chair across the room. “So it’s happened again.”
While the three were watching the boat, Sherlock saw his chance. He dove off the deck into the water.
Riley stared at them. Her body started to tremble, and Janine was worried that the Veritas drops wouldn’t be enough. But then she relaxed back into her chair.
“And for the record,” Sherlock added, “Sally thinks you’re worthy. You’ve already earned the right to stand by her side. So keep doing that, and you’ll be fine.”
The fog showed no sign of lifting, but the park lights were still shining brightly. In fact—Watson’s brows drew together—the lights seemed higher than usual, and they burned a strange colour, different from the low yellow he was accustomed to.
He wasn’t buried with Lestrade—he had to be buried in the cemetery near John Watson’s wife, to keep his brother and his husband together in death—but his brothers, one by blood, one by heart, buried a pen in Scotland; the only pen Mycroft Holmes had ever used to write his love letters.
The sun rose behind them as they reached the road, and Ireni spared a quick look behind her. Her eyes had never been harmed by the sun’s rays, and it and the moon were the only constants in her life. She clutched the amulet around her neck—the mark of those twin gods, the sources of her power.
John looked closer. Sherlock's jaw was tense, his entire body was held stiffly, and his eyes were unfocused.
Sally turned. She wasn’t sure when it had happened, but Mycroft, Sherlock and John had returned. Mycroft was pale. “Have you lost your senses, Grezzik?”
Holmes opened his mouth. The sound that came out was the deepest, harshest perversion of a laugh Watson had ever heard: his skin crawled just to hear it.
“The hell it isn’t. You care for him more than you ever want to and so you hide behind the same cold look you give everyone else, because,
So if anyone's confused about the Carriers and their genders...it really doesn't have much impact on the story (other than Cerise, since she is a Female woman). I just wanted to extend Florin's gender tolerance to even the low class (and "breeding stock" for the Crown is technically low class, even though they're treated like royalty.
Mycroft steepled his fingers. “I cannot say that it is exactly what I envisioned for Sherlock—I did not think he would give his heart at all, and certainly not to a forbidden lover. But then again Sherlock’s never done what I predicted, and he’s often ended up the happier for it. And you are a good man, John, that much is obvious. So long as you do not cause him pain, I am happy to support you.” Gray eyes turned to steel. “And you will not cause him pain, correct?”
Of course the test didn’t solve anything, and there were several more arguments before it was eventually settled. John did have to fight hard to convince Sherlock that Kitty and Stan would prefer actual baby clothes to the…physical proof of John’s donation.
John managed to—well, not quite forget, that would be nearly impossible, but he did put Sherlock's hint out of his mind as Bradstreet chatted enthusiastically about his daughter. Bradstreet was one of the few men John had ever met who'd campaigned successfully and enthusiastically for paternal leave. Now that his daughter Abby was six months old he was back at the Yard, but it was currently only part-time and there were rumours that he was planning to retire and go into something less dangerous.
Despite her own experiences, Mrs. Hudson enjoys attending weddings. So far her favourite has been Mike and Molly’s, though Kitty and Stan’s was wildly fun.
It took Billy a little longer to come in. He sat on the bed and fidgeted with his shirt, looking down at his lap, his lip caught between his teeth.
Mike is insanely proud of Molly. Molly is insanely proud of Mike. When they get drunk, they try to outdo each other with praise.
“It’s alright, Grandfather,” Billy said simply. “I know. And I won’t tell.” He paused. “You know, you can call him John in front of me now.”
When they reached home John pulled Sherlock into his arms and held him close. “You were going to leave me,” he whispered.
“Now, where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. You choose a glass, and we both drink. Then we find out who is right, and who is dead.”
Roger Dimmock is rather cold to Stan at first, but he gets the pronouns right and offers him lodging and a job, so Stan puts up with it. It takes about six days to realize that Dimmock thought he was their mutually disliked cousin Stephanie, not ‘Eliza’. They’d been mistaken for twins as children, so Stan managed to forgive the confusion. He still never lets Roger live it down. (“How the hell did you think I was Steph?” “Your…hair was different.” “You don’t say!”)
And now she was the one pushing back, still scoring no hits, but breaking through the defenses, wearing down the man in black. And now he was the one with his back to the Cliffs, up a set of stairs and onto an ancient lookout.
On the other hand, a couple of years later, Mummy was not at all pleased when she found out that Billy had been playing page-boy the day a dangerous criminal was invited for tea. At least they got the yellow stone back, but Mummy nearly broke Grandad's real head when she first heard, and only stopped shouting when Billy swore he'd gone for the police right away and hadn't heard any of the conversation.
John looked the elderly woman up and down. He spun her around, ignoring her surprised squawk. Satisfied, he moved back. “You’ll do, love.”
It took a moment for the other groom to compose himself enough to avoid both crying and kissing his fiancé before they were officially husbands. Once that moment passed, John replied:
Sherlock smiled, his rare one, when he met a new person he liked immediately. "I'm sure we can give you some pointers, can't we John? Why don't you join us? I've got some paperwork to fill out, and I can go over the cases with you."
“Hello, Doctor, Mr. Holmes,” she said, and her smile seemed genuine. “I believe I have, Mr. Holmes, though why you want to help me is still beyond me.”
Either Jamiarty’s security had become far more lax, or they simply weren’t interested in an old woman housekeeper and a valet. They only passed a few guards when they weren’t in secret passages, and there weren’t any guarding the dungeon.
"You alright, Stan?" Dimmock asked. He shot John and Sherlock a grateful look. "Stan's new—he's my second cousin. He's brilliant; going to make detective in a few years, I'm sure."
Count Magnussen shook his head. He nodded to the albino, who scuttled out of the room. He quickly returned with a book, a quill, and an inkwell, and laid them on a small table John hadn’t noticed before. The Count opened the book, flipping past some pages.
Sally glared at her, but she knew the swordswoman was right. This was the most exercise she’d had since Waverly was born, and the idea of getting on the horse again filled her with dread.
Mycroft observed Lestrade as they stood together. He had no idea of how long it had been since he’d died. All he knew that today was the first time he’d seen Gregory.
"Anyways, no, that's not my problem." Kitty closed her eyes, her face drawn quiet again. "My friend is in trouble."
“And lastly,” Holmes said, “I cannot imagine accepting such an honour when I know several men and even women who deserve it more than I do. Highest on that list, of course, is the man who sits in front of me and had just as much to do with saving those children as I did. Perhaps more.”
"What were you doing at our window?" Sherlock asked. To John's surprise his husband's voice was soft and nearly gentle, with no hint of the usual menace with which he confronted people who broke into Baker Street.
"Stay still!" John said urgently, his eyes flicking between Sherlock and the surrounding buildings, searching desperately for a sign of the sniper. If he could just protect Sherlock...there were a thousand words between them, a thousand memories that even Moriarty knew nothing for. Maybe he could find a way to warn him.
Uncle Sherlock took a package from his cloak. It was a rectangle, and Waverly knew what it was before she opened it.
Grampy patted his shoulder. “We can reminisce later. But I need to have a look at that cut, young missy, and we should get out to sea before the tide goes out, or it’ll be too stressful for the other young lady.”
Holmes’ eyes were soft. “You know very well that I agree with him. You’re pushing yourself too hard, John. You’re nearly sixty—that’s not young.”
It was a clear day in London, with the slightest crisp edge to the breeze. Fall was on its way, and Sherlock wore a thicker cloak than he was used to. Luckily moonblossoms bloomed all the year, even as far north as London. When Sherlock had dreamed about his and John’s wedding long ago, for the couple of months they were in love and happy and John hadn’t been captured by pirates, there were always moonblossoms.
Demisexuality, for those who are unfamiliar, is an orientation where you are not attracted to anyone without first having an emotional connection. I identify as demi, and I found the definition in a fanfic. It’s called ‘Bedtime for 221B’ by akisura12 on fanfiction.net; the chapter in question is chapter 5, ‘Asexual’, if anyone’s interested.
“No! He was a farm boy. Poor. Poor and perfect, with eyes like the sea after the storm. And he was on that ship, and…and you never leave survivors.”
If he’d been any less tired, John would have inspected the herb bunches, because he didn’t recognize some of the smells. He was that tired, though, so instead he led Sherlock over to the nearest soft pile and sank down onto it. Two days without sleep and heavy work and worry were taking their toll, and he could hardly keep his eyes open. But he managed to say one thing before he fell asleep.
No, he had to find Ireni, and if she was…if she was dead too, he would have to find somewhere else to go. Somewhere with people. He wasn’t going to be alone again.
Kitty waits until everyone in her house has fallen asleep before she goes to bed. She likes to have a moment alone to savour her new happiness.
Once he was finally ensconced in the Diogenes that night, he found himself reaching for pen and paper. It was ridiculous; the letter would get there not two days after Lestrade reached Scotland, but Mycroft wanted to get the first letter over with. It would be the hardest to write.
He woke with a start a few hours later to a kindly stewardess shaking him by the shoulder. "We've landed, sir. Do you want to wake your husband?"
“Can’t afford to make exceptions, I’m afraid. Otherwise everyone expects it, and then it’s work, work all the time.”
"Well I had to have some kind of insurance, pet. To make sure you couldn't win no matter how lucky you got." Moriarty's eyes went dead, just for a flash of a second, and John flinched. "So here's how this works—if you don't jump, fine. You live. But your family dies."
Sherlock and I were returning from the theatre just before sunset when I grabbed his arm. Just down the alley we were passing I saw Kitty and Hopkins standing close together.
There was no point asking, John knew. Sherlock was getting better at sharing things since they’d become partners, but he still had a flair for the dramatic. If there was a surprise brewing, John wouldn’t see it until it happened.
Janine held up a hand before Philip could retort. “Is that what you advise? To let two dangerous enemies return to their stronghold?”
The party was utterly brilliant; one of Kitty’s cousins was a caterer, Stan’s brother had come around last year and he brought his band, and John Did Not mess up the best man speech (it wasn’t as good as Greg’s, but hell, he’d never written for speeches). Stan and Kitty didn’t seem to sit for a minute, darting around the room hand in hand to chat with everyone, dancing to every single song and dragging the sitting onto the floor (John promised to delete the video of his husband dancing the Macarena—he never got around to it)…enjoying themselves, enjoying their day. John found it difficult after a while to keep up with the young ones, so he and Sherlock found a quieter corner (which held their brothers-in-law too) and they talked in low voices about the weddings, reminiscing about their own as they watched the mad capers on the floor.
Grandfather John was halfway through a story about a runaway train when they got to the cottage. Billy gasped with delight—Dad had sketched it quickly for him, but he’d never seen it. It was beautiful—small and all gray bricks with neat flowers all around. The rain was still coming down, but Grandfather Sherlock came out anyways, his lips turned into one of his special smiles. Billy leapt out, nearly knocking him down. “Sorry, Grandfather,” he gasped.
“Of course. Well, not quite the same, and I couldn’t quite articulate each change, but…” Watson took a quick glance around the dark alley, then put his hand on Holmes’ face, cool in the growing chill. “I can see the change in you too, my dear.”
“All due respect, your Majesty, but we don’t have much time. Sally and Waverly need to be safe, and the only way that can be done is to prove Jamiarty guilty.”
“Savira and Mycroft are directing troops from London,” Janine continued. “Everyone’s calling their banners, at least our allies are. They’ve been coming in all day.”
“Then it came to me,” Sherlock whispered. “You’ve said before that you don’t want to be alone again. I can promise you that you will never be alone as long as I am alive, because if there is anything more pleasant than being loved by you it is being able to love you back.”
John reached out and took his lover’s hands. “Then whatever remains must be improbable. I understand. But have we examined everything?”
"You don't have to if you don't want to," Holmes said immediately. "It was just a passing thought, I was stupid to bring it up."
They’d made more progress than Sherlock thought, because the sun was only just setting when Anderson stopped in front of him.
Note: I hope I have made this as historically accurate as the internet (sans Bradshaw) allows me to be, and any liberties taken are entirely artistic (also we are in a world of dreamwalking gay detective-doctors, history may be rewritten a tad).
It coincided with his own, of course, and came to no surprise. He was far past his prime, no matter what Holmes said, and his leg could no longer take the strain of dashing through London. His vision was going, his hand trembled more frequently, and there were occasional, frightening moments when he couldn’t catch his breath.
“I’ll tell him about your alliances—he knew about Sanctaphrax, but not Regalia or Archenland. I’ll tell him about your guards, and how you don’t know how to deal with magic.”
Kitty beckoned them over, and once Watson was close enough she carefully held the bundle of blankets out to him. "This is William John Hopkins," she said. "I thought we'd call him Billy."
Well, all alone except The Woman. Ireni had been sitting in the crowd at his last performance. She saw his value; well, his value to her. She needed his strength. Grezzik needed a job.
"I don't think we should take sides, dear," John answered. "I think our best hope is to see them both. They might change their minds, after all. I just wish they'd give each other a chance."
“With the understanding that, should the treaty be broken, repercussions will follow swiftly,” Janine answered. She didn’t like this at all—something was wrong.
The King sighed. “Carla is buried under a tree covered with knots, in a beautiful clearing. I’m afraid I haven’t been there in a while, because my health does not allow me. But it is a calm place. I hope she is at peace.”
He’d sorted out three Sherlock-cases (the man had the most irritating handwriting ever, not to mention little tact when writing statements) when his phone rang.
The old woman smiled. “You, dear, have your own weapons. You will find your truth one day, and your justice. This one needs help, but she must do it on her own.”
John went in first, worried that evidence of his torture might have been left behind. The last thing he wanted was for Sherlock to see that.
The man in black retrieved his sword and headed in the direction of the footprints, a man’s and the Woman’s.
“Then do enlighten me, Holmes.” Watson put on his most intent, I-am-listening-to-you-Holmes face. Holmes despised that face, but he was too irritated to care that Watson was indulging his ludicrous sense of humour.
Grezzik rubbed his arms. "I'll go tend to the horses and get food. Does anyone want anything in particular?"
Molly made it to her seventeenth foster child's graduation and saw her start at Oxford before she quietly told Mike that she had the same cancer that had killed her dad. Before Jane's first year was up, Molly was gone; no medicine could save her. John held Kitty tight and watched his best friend give his wife's eulogy surrounded by their children, and prayed that he wouldn't have to give that speech for Sherlock.
“That members of three different royal families were here?” Ireni rolled her eyes. “This isn’t the most wise, Princess.”
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson were buried side by side, Watson next to his wife and Sherlock next to his brother, and no one said a word.
you two, can’t you wait for us one time?! You’re staying where I can see you.”), and watched the Eye revolve.
He’d checked this out thoroughly last week, and was relieved to see the same easy path up. Sherlock seemed to know it, but his expression was still puzzled as they picked their way to the roof of the building.
Ireni sighed. “I know what you think of me, and you’re right. I’m a monster. I’m rude, I’m demanding, and selfish. I did little other than abuse you both.”
“Is that part of being supportive?” Sherlock smirked. “Help me, John, I’m clueless about these things.”
“I’ll take the sword,” the count snapped. His lip curled. “I’ll take the girl too, and give you full price.”
John had no objections; they’d just got back from a case in Thailand, they could do with a rest. They spent the rest of the morning watching
Sally began to walk around the throne. She had to be careful not to trip, careful to stay upright, careful not to let the water robe slip…
John slid to the edge of the bed, sword at the ready as he rose to his feet. “Or maybe I don’t, after all. Drop. Your. Sword.”
Grandad John gasped, clutching Billy to his chest. "Did you hear that, Billy? Understanding of social customs and an acknowledgement that the Earth goes around the Sun, all at once! Your grandfather's learning!"
Holmes flinched at that. He stayed quiet for another moment, then whispered almost desperately, "do you still desire me?"
Grezzik fought the pain of the burns, but the woman—a witch, she must be a witch—raised her hand, and the fire vanished. She was suddenly airborne, high above Grezzik, high above the castle.
Mycroft Holmes leaned back in his chair. “And that is good, but can you do this forever? You and Sherlock are both still fairly young, and despite your line of work you could easily live another twenty years. Can you pretend for that long that there is nothing between you?”
“So I found a line of work that appealed to that. It’s never bothered me, any of it—the killing, the ransoms, the…well, negotiations. But I knew it mattered to both of you, so I kept you from the worst parts. And I’ve tried…I’ve tried so hard to be kind to you, but it’s hard. And I never really succeeded. And when I found you in London, I saw that you were with people who were being kind to you. I didn’t want to take you away from that. And then that woman was pregnant, and you needed help, and for the first time, I could…I could help you. In a way that mattered.”
things about Waverly, knew more about her than her parents. And right now he knew that as scared as she was, she wasn’t hurt. Whatever this Riley woman was doing, she didn’t want to hurt the child.
A disgusted muttering went around the table, followed by a silence. It was one thing to conceive of a cruel, evil adult killing a child. Horrific and nauseating, but plausible. But the idea of a child killing another child…
Also, I have an email dedicated to this account. You can reach me at acme146@gmail if you want to send prompts, ask questions, or just chat, I'd love to hear from you.
“Oh for Heaven’s sake, come here!” Watson dragged Holmes to stand by the mast. “Will this do, Mycroft?” he asked.
The King looked surprised. “Whatever you say, my dear, you can say with my wife present. We have no secrets.”
“Yes, but the council of Florin expects to be busy soon. Prince Jamiarty needs to…er…to reopen negotiations for a wedding. The King is still ill, and it would be best for the Prince to be married before the King passes.”
“Mummy said we can go to the zoo with Daddy tomorrow, and we can see the pretty birds! That’s better than a fairy!”
You see, while Anderson had been a spy, he knew that Riley and Jamiarty were buddy-buddy. So he’d developed a friendship with her, which developed into a romance by Riley’s choice. Anderson had gone along with it, partly because it gave him good information for Duke Mycroft, and partly because it provided cover for his relationship with Sally.
Sherlock felt John grip his hand tight, and he clutched back, fingers suddenly trembling. Everyone looked rather misty; even Mycroft had a handkerchief moved within easy reach.
“Couple of bruises,” John admitted. His eyes were too much like Sherlock’s, that was the trouble. “I’ve been kidnapped; not sure who by.”
Watson knew that there was nothing they could have done. They were called in too late, the police hadn’t even been notified until the husband was taken as well…Mrs. Brown had been fearful, taking hours to tell them who she suspected…and she’d been right, but they were far away by then.
As gravely as two foreign dignitaries at a state supper, they picked up their glasses, clinked them together, and sipped.
Riley was gagged in one cell, but his cousin wasn’t even tied up in the other. Sebastian was pacing back and forth, and he barely looked up when he saw Stam.
Kitty laughed. “And I always hated it when people did that to me, didn’t I?” She ducked her head. “Stan, Uncle John…well, he’s not my uncle. My name’s Kitty Winter.”
Mike never imagined that someone like Molly could love someone like him—ordinary, steady, sweet and far too fond of football. Molly doesn’t understand how it took her so long to realize she wanted him.
“Well of course it’s non-consensual, it’s for interrogation!” Janine’s grandmother shook her head. “I still don’t know how you’re going to manage your laws when you become Queen, my dear.”
“I found her body. I believe it was poison; there were no wounds. There were two cups, but the man in black and the Princess were gone.”
Footsteps on the stairs announced Anderson’s arrival. He was carrying a small, soft bag. Sally met him at the foot, Waverly strapped to her chest, and Anderson held them tight. “You’ll be alright, my love,” he whispered. “Take care of our girl, and I will see you soon.” He kissed her hand. “My Queen.”
“This is posh,” John said, suddenly feeling awkward. Mycroft had moved only three months ago, and from the amount of time they were spending going up and the gold leaf on the walls, this was an upgrade.
“We have people working on the diplomacy part,” Molly interrupted. “Princess Janine and Duke Mycroft are contacting their foreign allies as we speak.”
“We are. We see that the treason against his own country is far worse than a half-cocked war plan.” Janine had never sounded so dignified, so…regal. “The Crown of Guilder will abstain.”
The run towards the Swamp wasn’t far, and Sherlock smelled it before he heard it. It wasn’t fully unpleasant; it mostly smelt of a huge concentration of vegetation, mixed with a little bit of still water. Only the sulphurous tinge to the breeze warned them of any danger.
Prince Jamiarty beamed as he moved to take Sherlock’s hands. “And our wedding will go ahead as planned! Tonight we marry, and tomorrow we depart for our honeymoon. All the ships in our Armada will follow us out of the Channel, and we will have a glorious time, my darling.”
The first few hours went by in silence. They were still in London’s territory, so there was no need to be discreet, and they kept to the road. Sherlock and John walked hand in hand, while Anderson walked just behind, his eyes fixed on the ground. Something was clearly bothering the spy, but when Sherlock glanced at John, his husband shook his head. Sherlock agreed. Waiting for Anderson to spit it out would be best.
John thought about it: fake names, new identities, spending ages undercover to destroy Moriarty. It sounded sort of fun, but John wished he'd been in on the plan from the beginning, that saving Sherlock's life didn't mean destroying their own, perhaps forever if they didn't manage to completely wipe out the Web.
“Not that I’m complaining, but what’s the occasion?” John asked as he tucked in. Sherlock had brought his own tray in too, and indicated that his mouth was full. Even when his plate was completely clear of crumbs, he still refused to say what was going on.
“I don’t think they exist. We haven’t seen one—” John cut himself off with a shout. “Sherlock, move!”
There was only one guard at the entrance, and she looked entirely relaxed. She didn’t even snap to attention when they rode up, though her eyes widened at the sight of Grezzik.
“We’ve got a playlist for the rest of the night that Myc and Molly and I sorted out, but interestingly enough the first dance was chosen by both John and Sherlock.” Lestrade grinned at Sherlock’s shock. “You two should have known better.” He hit play.
“But you must have at least suspected that I knew the powder’s origin, which means that I cannot choose the wine in front of me!”
Sherlock, on the other hand, wouldn’t stop griping about the message they’d received, announcing Lord Moran’s visit. And it was killing John’s afterglow.
“So I thought I would give you something tangible, something you can always see even when we’re apart.” Sherlock’s voice broke. “And I swear, John, those moments will be few and far between. I want to spend the rest of my life by your side, whatever we are doing. Will you marry me, John Watson?”
Holmes heard the floorboards creak and released John reluctantly as Billy came into the kitchen. “Mornin’,” he mumbled.
John heard the lever move, and heard the Machine start to respond with a great clanging and banging, but Sherlock was there…
“You can still marry a man,” Magnussen argued. “You can marry a man and have one of the Carriers have your child.”
Stam the albino shuddered as he picked up his wheelbarrow. He had to dispose of Watson’s body, but his ears were still ringing with the man’s cry. “Damn shame,” he muttered, feeling guilty all over again as the words came out easily, soothed by the man’s recommendation of tea and honey.
Another new voice. Molly dashed to the window, and Sherlock followed, his arm around John’s waist to support him.
Molly had never been to a trial before. She probably should have been, but Ireni always got them out of any scrapes.
As long as his father was in good health, Prince Jamiarty lived a happy life. He was free to create war strategies that weren’t useful in a time of peace, spend time in the dungeons, listen to any minstrel who could play the latest tunes, and, of course, hunt.
"Gruner's not married yet," Sherlock interrupted. "Your friend isn't beyond us until then. You haven't slept in at least forty eight hours and you've got a twisted ankle. The best thing for you to do right now is sleep. I'll go and make sure you weren't followed. I've got informants of my own, they may be able to give us a lead on where the book is."
Kitty chose to run from home at sixteen. She chose to knock on the door of a lady who took great care of her girls and get herself a job. When the lady died three years later, without ever knowing that Kitty was underage, Kitty chose to go solo. When she met Bertie, she chose to go home with him on her night off. It was the last choice she made for years.
Sherlock took her to find lodgings shortly after, acting in ‘his goddaughter’s’ interests. I thought that was inspired, on his part—should she begin to call him Uncle Sherlock (should we ever tell her the truth of our relationship), none will be the wiser.
“I thought I could shelter Waverly from the crash,” Grezzik explained. “But Ireni caught us before we landed.”
But Sherlock had decided to be sociable, and really, Sherlock rarely asked for this kind of thing. Why not go along?
Sherlock pretty well figured he was dead, but somehow, somehow, Grezzik had gotten within arm’s reach and yanked him out of the water.
Kitty whirled in his arms and sobbed wildly. Sherlock put the book down and hugged the girl close. "It's done," he promised. "And I will not judge you, nor will anyone else. It's over, Kitty."
“That’s sufficient,” Sherlock managed before he started giggling, and then John started laughing with him and crying at the same time, and they kissed between giggles, holding onto each other as tightly as they could.
Perhaps Mycroft wanted to make a point; that this way of doing the plan was still going to hurt, and it was much more dangerous. John must be with Mycroft, and not being allowed to contact him. That was all.
The first thing Sherlock noticed about being out of the Fire Swamp was the swift change in light. Murky dark gave way to soft afternoon light almost instantly, which showed the depth of John’s wound and the blue of his eyes, weary as they were.
The first time Sally screamed, everyone jumped. She’d moaned and whimpered, but this was the first raw, broken cry. And it wasn’t because of pain.
Sherlock snorted. “On how soon she finds out that Stan was here this afternoon asking if we thought she’d say yes.”
“It’s drops from the Veritas flower,” Savira said. “It’s rare as anything, how did you get so much?”
“How bad is it?” Watson asked. He could, of course, look himself, but he wanted this Sherlock, like his own, to tell him. Lie to him.
They'd been flying for what felt like a week and John itched to get off the plane. Part of it was sheer discomfort, of course. The person in front of them had their seat reclined too far, his clothes were perfect for a Bermudan night but not quite for the chill of an aeroplane, and above all he was exhausted. He hadn't slept well the night before.
“Because he knows that if we tell people that he was trying to start a false war by murdering an innocent man?”
Hope you all enjoy this modern take on Kitty's story...it'll be a bit different from the Victorian (hopefully that was made clear from her...ahem, dramatic entrance) :) The next chapter will be up on Saturday, and so forth until this arc is complete.
“Have you talked to Sally about any of this?” John interrupted. His voice was calm, but Sherlock recognized the tone. His husband was furious.
"Shut up," Sherlock ordered, his voice muffled in John's hair. "Shut up, don't you dare...don't you DARE say things like that."
He stayed quiet for a few long minutes, watching Sherlock sleep. If he could, he would stay here until morning….
This is likely the darkest chapter I've published, and hopefully it will remain so, but this is an issue I felt needed to be dealt with.
The man did, and jerked away. He stepped back and launched his shoulder against Grezzik’s stomach. He bounced off, swearing.
“I felt so terribly for my son, watching his sister die, that I never told him about you. You were still so small, not quite three, and—” the King sighed. “Then I received the letter.”
A few moments later they arrived at the castle. Everyone else got off, but John held Sherlock back. “You know, that rest invigorated me.”
“Of course not! Don’t be stupid, we’ll break our necks. No, if they come out alive, they’ll come out on the far end. We’ll wait there.”
“Yes, the noble Prince Jamiarty, who has always wanted war,” Molly replied. “The noble man who is now searching for the beloved of his own intended…no, Grezzik, I think the man in black is in trouble.”
John's voice still had that terrible tone in it, and Sherlock took his husband's hand. "You don't have to go in, dear. Anderson and I--"
“Just because I didn’t know it doesn’t mean those acts weren’t part of him,” Sebastian replied. “I pledged my loyalty. How could I reverse that pledge after he trusted me with his crimes?”
"I miss them too," Kitty said, tears running down her face. "But we'll see them again. Have faith, darling. If I learned anything from your grandfathers, it's that you cannot keep people who are meant to be together apart forever. It's just not logical."
When Molly Hooper was thirty-eight she got the surprise of her life from Sherlock Holmes, who offered her congratulations. Eight months later John Watson delivered her twins at St. Bart’s during a hostage situation. Molly named her daughter Lily after Mike’s sister, and named her son Jacob.
“I am a doctor,” Watson gasped as he sank onto his bed, hand pressed to the wound. “And I am fine, Holmes, stop fussing about.”
The Yard at large was gobsmacked at the very idea of them retiring, but none protested after Holmes shouted at a few of the louder nasty whisperers about ‘wanting to spare the poor old doctor’. Hopkins thanked them both profusely and accepted, with a certain amount of relief, the offer to own 221 Baker St. outright. He and Kitty would live downstairs and the sets of rooms above, including their own, would be devoted to the care and keeping of the Irregular force, past and present.
Stan buys Kitty pretty clothes as often as he can afford; he thinks she deserves all the beautiful things in the world. Kitty learns to cook from Mrs. Hudson, because if she’s going to be making meals they’ll be the ones he likes best.
“Do you mean that Prince Jamiarty was going to kill the Princess and blame the murder on my country?”  Princess Janine asked. Her voice was so calm, but Molly could see the fury in her lover’s eyes.
Watson looked around the room. It seemed to be a strange cross between his own room at Baker Street and the long, sunny bedroom at the cottage, though there was no other bed. He wasn't quite willing to get up yet, but something told him they ought to explore.
It was a good day for Holmes’ leg and Watson’s back, so they offered to take the children for a walk along the beach. Mycroft went with them as far as the pool, but regretfully announced that he had to turn back. “I’m afraid I’m only going to slow you down.”
Luckily Philip hadn’t heard. He was standing with the others, talking through their options. Options, treaties, rules…the didn't matter. Someone had stolen her daughter. Someone had taken away her child. But she didn’t know if her child was alive or dead. Only Grezzik did.
Sherlock didn't respond as John led him slowly through the police station, ignoring the confused stares of the few Yarders around this late. Greg nodded to Dimmock as they reached the door. "I'm going to take these two home, Sherlock's ill."
“I know…I know it’s a lot to ask, and I swear, it’ll be mine and Stan’s baby, you can be involved as little or as much as you want—”
“I was the King’s Miracle Man, of course I delivered you. Your mother had an easy labour, but she caught the fever and died.” Max took her hand. “It happens that way, Sally. It doesn’t make you less of a woman, nor less of a mother.”
As her brothers and sisters proudly unveiled a big sign that said HAPEE BURFDAY WAVERLEE, Uncle Sherlock and Uncle John came into the room.
A Fire Swamp, a ravine and a couple mile’s run away, Grezzik huddled among the rocks. He’d come to just in time to hear the soldiers, and he’d hidden, but what good was that? Where was he supposed to go? If Molly was dead, he didn’t want to go back to Ireni, but Ireni was better than nothing…
The man didn't seem offended. "The name's...well, might as well call me David. I've got rather too many names, several that don't mean anything to either of you. I'm your guide, so to speak; I do the introductions."
Mycroft was staring at him like he’d lost his head. Grezzik shifted uncomfortably. “I will not harm myself, my lord.” Perhaps that was what was bothering the man—as the High Priest, he had a duty to lead people away from suicide.
Sherlock turned just in time to see a dark hand throw a bottle through the open window to his right. He heard a horrible scream.
“I don't know, but I know that Rich—that M-Moriarty is going to hurt him. The little boy woke up, and he told us about the man in the suit who showed them pictures of you and told them to scream. He identified him as Brook.”
The song began in a fit of pique with a new flatmate. How dare the doctor move his books? They were, perhaps, all over the chairs, but hang it all he had been looking for something. A quick trill, a twang of string, on the master’s finest violin.
Now I want to give everyone a heads up for next week. It's going to be a two-parter and the first part...well, I'll update the tags to reflect this, but there's going to be major character death. It's worth it, I promise you all it's worth it for part two, but this is just a heads up in advance that sad is coming, and you might want to skip that chapter and go straight to part two when it goes up on Thursday, or skip that week entirely, it's up to you.
Just as he'd done so, there came a letter, delivered express. Watson had been invited by the Forrester's, Mary's old friends, to spend Christmas Day with them, and as Holmes clearly had no care for the season, he was going to accept.
“Indeed.” Holmes—it must be Holmes, no one could look that much like Sherlock—looked deeply concerned. “Are you injured?”
We're going to start going a bit off book now; you got a couple of glimpses of that this chapter. The big Princess Bride scenes will still be in it, but there'll be some new stuff.
“He helped Maria and Grezzik get me here. He’s—oh, there he is. You haven’t hurt him, have you your Highness?”
“We won’t pursue the Princess, but we do not want war, either. In the moment Princess Sherlock left, he may have become…confused…about the Prince’s intentions.”
Sherlock grinned. “I like the way you think, Anderson. I’m assuming your spies within the castle could help too?”
“I’ve uncovered no plot from Guilder. You’ve discovered information that I have not, and I am meant to be your security; this realm’s security. I have failed you.”
The bitterly cold April had finally ended, and the first few days of May were soft and warm. Delighted by the turn in weather, Holmes and Watson had spent the entire day outside, going so far as to take their dinner and eat in the park. That drew some stares, but Holmes didn’t mind. They’d done far stranger things in public.
“Yes, no good,” Molly agreed. “I’ll be useless there. Very well, I will hang on. And when we get to the top, if you can hold the magic I will use my sword.”
Grezzik was twelve and terrified, but he went because his father and mother promised to follow the caravan. And they did for the next five years.
When Stan was still Eliza, he was told to be a physicist. When he went to uni at his father’s order, he dropped both the gender and the dream someone else had given him, and signed up for police training instead.
Stan sat next to his wife, doing his best to put his arms around her and their child. “I love you,” he whispered back. “And I love our baby, oh gosh…”
Sherlock had understood that he was going to be married, and that he would be married to Prince Jamiarty. But today, standing on that balcony, he truly felt it. It was strange; he’d hardly felt anything in three years, even when his parents died a month apart.
Molly gripped her sword tightly, ready to pounce (and wishing there was more room to swing it), and she threw the door open.
“Only fifteen minutes. And Mycroft’s an hour early for everything, so I’m sure he’s going to call us late.”
“Lord Moran,” Janine asked, “knowing what you know about Jamiarty now, do you think he would stop with Guilder?”
“I wasn’t finished,” Molly interrupted. “I know she loves me, and that I love her. But she wants—and she needs—a child. Guilder doesn’t have a Carrier right now, and I was wondering…”
The fire was lit in the sitting room, but the dark haired woman sitting in the visitor’s chair was wrapped up warmly, a thick veil shrouding her face. Sherlock closed the door behind us.
Downstairs in the kitchen, their husbands were sitting silently at the table. The maid had been shooed away by the formidable guest, who'd sat down next to the woman's husband seconds after the doctor had gone upstairs. The men sat in silence, both trying not to wince at every fresh scream. Both failing.
And there was. Waverly’s favourite meal was breakfast, and the cooks had pulled out all the stops for the meal. There were five different kinds of pancakes, for a start, and dishes heaped with fruit.
“I am his beloved,” John answered, and he moved closer. “I know this room. I was here. I was tied to that same table, in that same place. We speak the truth. We know that Sally is the King’s daughter. And we know that Jamiarty murdered your daughter. He told you that tonight, didn’t he? He probably thought that would make you speak, that the pain would loosen your tongue. But he doesn’t really understand how love works, does he?”
“Oh, Guilder was happy to do it. Princess Janine hates Jamiarty as much as he hates her, and she graciously agreed to conquer London and keep it secret. I then staged a heroic rebellion, we overthrew our usurpers, and our peace treaty made London its own country, with Princess Janine staying on as advisor. Guilder and London are still good friends, of course, and France, Archenland and Sanctaphrax have joined our cause as well. Fascinating people.”
In what felt like five minutes but was more logically twenty, John touched his face. “Dear, we ought to eat something.”
John chuckled, carefully wiping her face dry. "It comes in handy every once in a while. Come on now, blow." He tucked the handkerchief away when she was done. "Now if you need anything, just give us a shout. We've both got excellent hearing."
John had settled his nerves by the time they got to the clearing. The Count was gone, and there was no screaming, so the Machine wasn’t in use.
John looked back but the misty figures were long gone. If he hadn’t touched one of them, briefly seen his face, he might have called it a dream.
“I know, but I want it to be…I want to make his day. You know us both, you know music, you can pick something.”
“So for a whole year that’s how it was. ‘Goodnight Watson, good work, sleep well, I’ll most likely kill you in the morning.’ And I just kept learning how to do things; fight, fence, become stronger…it was a wonderful time, even if I was facing death.”
Sherlock smiled at me. It’s infuriating when he does that; he is so pleased about surprising me that he forgets that I might actually have benefited from understanding the whole situation.
Mplly took a second to work that out. “So twenty for me. Even at my best, I couldn’t fight that many, and certainly not on five weeks of wine!” She sank into a chair. “I need Ireni’s planning. I have no gift for strategy.”
"Because Bertie Gruner is a...I believe the term is weeaboo? He's obsessed with Japanese culture, at least the parts of it that appeal to him. He shows a particular fondness for Naruto. My idea was to set you up as a collector with first editions to sell of the manga, but you need to actually know what you're talking about."
Sherlock wasn’t sure if he wanted to be alone or not, so he sank in his soft armchair and tried to observe the situation.
On the other hand, he wasn’t sure what he sould tell her, or what he wanted to, and that was possibly even worse.
When he realized where he was, he stumbled back in shock. It was the building of their very first case where Sherlock had nearly died. John had saved him from the pill that might have been deadly. But John wasn’t here to save him now, even though Sherlock needed him so much. John would never save him again. John would lead a normal life with his
Mary almost yelled, then regretted it, but John sighed and seemed to think, so perhaps it had been just the right thing to do.
“I am sorry… I am so sorry, so sorry…”, he repeated a couple of times until sobbing took over his voice.
I noticed that I made a few planning mistakes in the last chapters, I will sort that out at some point, like for example that no one complains about the cold when it's obviously February and stuff like that. Please just ignore that for now? :) I'll work on it, I promise.
He didn't want to do this. John just wanted to leave, not to hear, not to see his friend like this, but he knew he couldn't just go. If he left Sherlock again, he would never forgive himself, not after what he had seen just now.
John wanted to laugh. His wife, honest and open? Not after what had happened last year with Magnussen. But of course he couldn’t tell Greg about that. Friend or not, the inspector would definitely have to investigate if he knew that Mary had shot Sherlock.
He sounded so bitter that John wanted to hug him, but that wouldn’t be appropriate. Also, John would never feel comfortable hugging other men, he was sure of that.
A small voice in John’s head asked what he was doing there, but he shut it up. Sherlock had been smiling quite a lot today, the way John had wanted him to, and after all it was probably just the stuff in the cookies. He could blame it all on them later.
The cushions from the couch had been swooped to the floor and all chairs had been pushed to the walls. On the table lay some med bottles that John assumed had been left by the paramedics, he threw them into the bin without even looking at them.
Since it wasn’t that late - well, late, but not too late to go drinking, he figured - he decided to just get his phone from the flat and call Mike to ask if he maybe wanted to get a drink or two. Or five. He wasn’t sure yet.
Third short chapter. Maybe I get a longer one up before I go on vacation next Saturday. No promises, though, I have a shitload of work to do before that.
“Thank you a lot for your help, John. I will let you know the details tomorrow the latest so you can blog about it,” he said and John felt like a huge distance had just been brought between them. Feeling a little insecure, he made to hug Sherlock, who at first didn’t respond to it at all, but then he returned the embrace with enormous strength.
"Maybe not leave him in a cloud of drugs, worse than before! You either help him or keep your distance, or I promise you, I will take every step possible to make you feel what he felt - unwanted.
John nodded and explained what his wife had said, but also added that it had sounded a bit weird to him. Although recently, everything sounded a bit weird in his ears. He just wanted things to be normal again.
“Oh, sorry. She’s a friend of Mary’s, apparently. Wrote her some weird texts this morning, and because Mary had left her phone at home, I felt kinda… obliged to check them.”
“Tea?” he asked and the Doctor nodded, suppressing a smile. This was a Sherlock he had never known, being nice and openly caring about other people. Then again, it was for a case, that definitely explained the dedication the detective showed.
He let go of his friend and stepped back to get some much needed distance. His head was swirling with thoughts. Had he really just called Sherlock
A horrid look appeared on John’s face until Sherlock said: “John, you always think such horrible things. Why would I want to poison you? I need my blogger!”
"Mycroft, I assure you, I didn't want any of this to happen. What should I have done? Smile and nod and say 'Yes, Sherlock, whatever you want, Sherlock, doesn't matter what I feel, Sherlock'? Because I've done that for some years, but I am a married man now, and I'm going to be a father. I have to take responsibility for my family now, not only for a wannabe-sociopath that needs caring."
“Alright. Thank you for being honest with me”, she started and blinked confused when John started laughing.
"Our victim has been dead for six days, this can be confirmed by your team. The woman was ready to go out when she was murdered, which happened with a sharp knife and just one precise stab from the front. On the way to her favourite club she came here, so she had been distracted by something. Someone."
John couldn't help but smiling a little desperate before he answered: "But I'm here. I couldn't sleep anyway, and I needed to talk to you. Because you're my best friend and I care about you. And I want you to be okay, I really want that, but I can't... you know..."
“But I haven’t come here to talk about my wife. I wanted to see you’re okay. Which you are not, obviously. So I have to make it better, somehow. Sherlock, tell me how to help you.”
He immediately regretted his words when John said sadly: “You know, it’s kinda funny, but yesterday Mary accused me of the same thing - regarding you.”
But when he arrived at the empty hall where Mycroft had decided to meet him, he got surprised by a cheerful Holmes that was definitely out of position.
“These are not the hormones, John, and you know that. But I don’t want to discuss that now. Please, just leave. I won’t go anywhere, I can promise that.”
“There is nothing you can do. I am broken and beyond fixing. I should have realised that years ago, when everyone told me so, but it needed you to open my eyes. I guess I should thank you for that, John.”
Yeeeah, I'm back. Sorry it took so long! Last weeks have been kinda messed up and I'm still messed up so this chapter is probably messed up but hey! It's a chapter :)
“Alright then,” he said slowly and changed the music track to something slower. John automatically moved towards his friend, stood in position and offered his hands.
John could almost see the inspector running a hand through his hair like he always did when he was nervous. And he
His smile felt like an insane grimace, so he relaxed his muscles again and tried not to look creepy. Since he felt like a zombie, that was harder to manage than he had thought.
When had it changed? When his father died? His mother had broken down and he couldn’t cope, but he had gone to the army then, and if that wasn’t structure, he didn’t know what was.
I still feel left out. There’s something you didn’t tell me and then, you keep running to Sherlock, trying to find excuses instead of saying you want to see your best friend - which has always been enough reason before. You look fed up, you barely sleep, even your limp is bad again! John, I beg you, what happened?”
John needs to get away from Mary and seeks out Sherlock, hoping for news - but he doesn't like what he finds.
“I… had trouble with Sherlock, some nights ago. Went to check on him to make sure he’s okay. He’d been smoking… something, and I’m worried about him, but this doesn’t justify leaving you alone, I know. I am so sorry, and I hope you can forgive me.”
The detective answered immediately and drew John in with his warm lips, occasionally caressing him with his tongue.
He was not sure if this was some sort of joke or if Sherlock had suffered from his almost-overdose more than they thought.
"Why?", asked Lestrade. "How can you tell she didn’t want to meet someone here, a secret lover? After all, it’s a nice empty little house.”
I'm very sorry about the hurriedness of the last chapter, I will try to edit it as soon as possible (even though I didn't want to edit before I finish the story, but I think the last chapter might be an exception.. Sorry!)
The fact that it surprised him was sad in itself. She was his wife after all. Of course she knew what he needed now. She knew it because she was awesome and John should never let her go, even though he didn’t give her enough credit for it.
“Kind of… Look, can you keep something for yourself without thinking bad of me, or Sherlock, or.. anyone?”
He leaned against it as he wasn’t ready to go in yet, but he already felt his anger vanishing. He was sad now.
Mary nodded. That sounded reasonable enough, she only hoped that she could be reasonable right now. But that was to be found out soon enough.
So, this will be a slightly longer (I hope, otherwise it's normal length!) chapter. I will be gone for around two weeks now, visiting my family :) I promise to bring back new chapters when I'm back :) Have a nice summer everyone :)
Alright! It's four days later than planned, but I hope you still like it. This is probably the last chapter for this year since I'm at my mum's place and just borrowed her pc to type this, not sure if I manage that again. But I have awesome plans for next year so look forward to that!
He was asking question nonstop now, stupid questions, pointless questions, feeling desperate and annoying and annoyed and lost and suddenly he just wanted some tea, and armchair and crap telly.
John immediately ran to him and felt his pulse, only to jump a little when the detective opened his eyes.
Determined to make this work, she smiled and said: “I’m sorry, darling, I’m a bit messed up. It was all so much, you know…”
But Mary wasn’t scared. She was annoyed and also at the end of her patience,  and she could be as stubborn as John, if not even more.
John sighed, but somehow he was also curious to see what this was all about, and so he took off his own jacket and pulled the sweater over his head. It fit perfectly and didn’t even scratch. He had to admit that it felt very nice.
The last word was nothing more than a hiss, and for a moment John thought Sherlock was angry, because he totally sounded like it, but as he chanced a look at his face, there was nothing more than pain and disappointment.
Right, sorry about that. (I say that every chapter. Please accept all my apologies for all chapters that are late because I'm shit at time managing and I work too much?)
“John, good to see you, mate. I already ordered for us, beer should be here soon”, the inspector said, waving from his table in the corner. John was thankful that he hadn’t chosen a place at the bar. He didn’t want that much attention right now.
As he opened the front door, he immediately bumped into Mrs. Hudson, who shrieked and jumped a little.
Hey there! I'm still alive and I bring you a new chapter! Next one is nearly done as well, should be there later this week (I hope, no promises :s)
Sad that he’d lost a friend like this, sad that he couldn’t talk to Mary about it. He didn’t even know what held him back. Maybe it was his loyalty to Sherlock? But why should he do this, after what had happened today?
Just a little something. Want to have that stand alone, although I thought about writing it from Sherlock's perspective... If you're interested in that, let me know, I might change it. Will be away next week, I should have something after that, though. I hope. x)
He watched the door fall shut and for a moment he just sat there, thinking about what to do now before a voice supplied
“Don’t make me lose you again,” he whispered against his friend’s shoulder, but his voice was lost in the precious coat. Of course he wouldn’t leave without it, no matter how urgent the case or how distracted the Consulting Detective, he would always wrap his coat around his shoulders, turn up the collar, smirk at John and then stride to the nearest cab that just magically appeared around the corner.
“I’ll be back tomorrow, honey. Sleep well”, her husband said with a small smile, then left the room.
“Awesome. Same pub as every time?”, Greg asked and John had to grin. They’d only been out together two times, but they already had some sort of regular pub. So John confirmed and turned off all the lights in the flat before leaving. He felt relief overwhelming him as he stepped on the street although there was absolutely no reason for it. He had lived there for almost two years now and he had always felt comfortable in Mary’s flat. What had suddenly come over him?
“But you like Christmas, don’t you, John? What’s wrong with celebrating Christmas whenever we feel like it?”
“What happened?” Mary asked softly, caressing his back with her hand. So they hadn’t talked already. That was… good, John thought, he might have told her anything and wouldn’t even remember it.
“Ah. Found the killer already, he’s in custody right now. It was her neighbour, but we haven’t found out why yet. Since we had no real help from Sherlock at all this time, we actually have to rely on clues and what the murderer says. All that’s left now is a bit of paperwork, but I can still do that tomorrow. Or next week. Or never. So don’t worry about it.”
John sighed and began to walk up the stairs, increasingly nervous with every step. As he entered the living room, he was almost nauseous, and seeing Sherlock lying on the sofa like a corpse didn’t help.
He just wanted to sit here and watch the clouds pass by, wanted to listen to the cars on the streets and to the general rustle of the hospital, knowing it couldn’t reach him - but then he felt movement, Greg and some paramedics John didn’t know where dragging Sherlock along, keeping him well away from the edge, and just like that they were gone and John was alone.
He wasn’t sure if that was the case, but Mycroft tended to be quite short-tempered when it came to his little baby brother.
Fortunately, he still had a key to the flat so he could sneak past Mrs. Hudson. He really liked the landlady, but he didn't want to explain what had happened to her boys.
“I’m sorry. Anyway, I feel totally wasted and I should sleep right now. They say if I feel good by tomorrow evening, I might be discharged the day after, so… Can you tidy up our place a bit? And maybe text Sophie what happened and that I’m fine? That would be great.”
“I lost the baby, John. I lost our baby”, she whispered, and if she hadn’t repeated it, John wouldn’t have been sure if he had understood her right. He froze in shock at the realisation of her words, then he sank on the empty bed next to her and buried his face in his hands.
I finally have internet! I am so sorry for the long wait but as it is with internet companies: It almost never works. But now I'm back, and I brought a chapter with me! The next one is already halfway written, so I hope I can successfully use the time in the train to work and back and give you a new chapter soon. That said, I still have a lot of work to do at my new flat so.. Not so sure about that. Sorry. :)
Thank you to everyone who is still here, who is still reading, and of course thank you to everyone that came here just now or a while before - I love you all. :)
He lay down on the bed, didn’t care that he had all his clothes and even his shoes still on, and stared at the ceiling. His life was a mess. How had it ended up like this? All the time before, he’d had clear structures in his life.
“The thing is, John… I want the situation to change. I don’t feel like you value me enough. You take me for granted, you always have, ever since you met me. It only worked between us because I accepted the fact that Sherlock Holmes would always be your number one, and who couldn’t understand that, with his mind and all. But you know, carrying your child made me realise: I don’t want to be just the wife. The one that waits at home until you finished your adventures with the most important person in your life. The one that cooks you food and cleans your room so you can be happy even at home, when you’re not with the greatest mind in Britain.
John was slightly jealous; this piece of clothing for sure had never been forgotten at a crime scene or had to worry because it wasn’t informed.
“John, it’s Sarah. Listen, I really don’t want to get involved but your wife left her phone at home and asked me to tell you to visit her. She’s not in a very good mood, though, so better bring flowers or chocolate or everything.”
"Although this house looks nice and renovated, it’s actually been empty for some years now. Most houses in this area have been. And she was on the way to a club, as the time card in the pocket of her coat clearly shows. She’s going there every friday for Lady’s Night, and she clearly fancies the first DJ. He has nothing to do with this, though.
“Be there in ten.” That meant John had to hurry, but to his luck he instantly found a cab and arrived at the pub just in time.
They both laughed and entered the pub, where they sat at the bar. It felt like a huge improvement to John, away from the secret table in a dark corner to a place out in the open, where everyone could see, hear and talk to them. It was silly, but it cheered him up a bit.
Yeah, I'm shit at summaries, just read the chapter xD It's been a bit hard to write from Mycroft's point of view, but then again, I guess I didn't really get the other characters right. Let's just say it's an AU where the characters are like this xD Hope you still enjoy it :)
John watched the car leave, then started off into a small street that would lead him directly to Sherlock. At least he hoped so.
“Good luck with that one, I don’t know what to do with him. I told him you’d come back but he just wouldn’t listen! Anyway, I’m late. See you around, John, and thank you for coming!”
He was already thinking about just grabbing Sherlock by the shirt and pull him out of the smoke when he heard him say: "Fine, you won. Just this time, don't think you can always haunt me."
“John, good to see you in one piece. The way you talked about your wife yesterday made me fear she’d eat you alive today.”
Anyway, I got some more chapters prepared and I'll try to write a lot now, but I don't know what work has prepared for me so.. Yeah. Have fun? x)
“He’s… not good. Had smoked a lot of something weird and thought I was a hallucination. I’m really worried but then they called me here and of course this is more important.” He skipped the part with Mycroft and that he didn’t even had his phone with him but Mary wouldn’t notice anyway. It wasn’t even important, he hoped.
And here he was, lying on his bed, probably drunk, the second day in a row, his life totally screwed up.
In his head, their last conversation replayed, Sherlock’s last, cruel voice; his own pleading words; his desperate cries and screams.
So he rolled over, got Mary’s phone and wrote Sophie. He still wasn’t sure what to think of her, but she seemed to know more about Mary right now than he did; and also mary had asked him to tell Sophie she was okay, so it could only help to ask her some questions while he was at it.
“I got to go, need to talk to Mary. I’ll check again on you tomorrow, alright? Please, promise me you don’t do anything stupid”, he said as lightly as possible. Sherlock only snorted.
(The original is nowhere to be found on the internet... Or I'm just shite at searching, also possible :x Anyway, here's a live version that's kinda good, it's only the first song and I tried to tell the link to start right at the song, so you don't have to listen to what they talk before.)
Here’s John, Mary’s husband. Who are you? And how did what go? Please, respond, I have other ways to find you if you don’t.
Okay, number two is up! Let's hope I find the time to type out the next two chapters as well, but I'll try my best. Should be here before Christmas!
“Yes, I’m so bloody real I could punch you in the face and break your nose! So you’d better be serious about anything you say or do, because I am!”
Mary laughed out loud. That meant Sophie hadn’t told him anything important, and if he thought she was cheating on him, well, then there was at least a chance he might understand how she felt.
“You know”, Greg continued after a while, “we always made jokes about Sherlock and you being a couple. Even I joined in, but I swear, I never thought it could be a problem.”
While he was still wondering about the situation, Sherlock put a cup of tea on the small table next to him, and it turned out to be perfect. This got more and more surprising.
“Hello to you, too, Mary”, John said slowly and he looked so tired that Mary instantly felt bad. It probably wasn’t easy for him as well. However, she couldn’t continue like this, and if she didn’t want immediate change, she at least wanted answers. And if Mary wanted something, she normally got it. Except when Sherlock bloody Holmes and John bloody Watson were involved.
The next thing John knew what that he was sitting on the couch in Mary’s flat, her arms around his shoulders, and he was
The detective just waved his hand and it was enough for John. He burst forward and threw his arms around his friend’s trembling body, holding him in a tight hug. Sherlock stiffened immediately, turned around and tried to step away from John, but the doctor didn’t loosen his grip.
John just turned around and hugged his friend, and it took all his strength not to cry, even though he had always been able to control his emotions pretty well.
I hope you still enjoy the chapter (if you're still with me D: ) and please tell me what to think of it. I love every form of criticism, as long as you're nice. :)
“You know, I really tried my best with her. I’m not good with people, no matter what anyone tells me. But it felt so right with her. And now she tells me it was wrong all the time. I promised her to try harder, to make it better, and I really want us to get okay again, but… What if I don’t feel good with this ‘new’ marriage? What if the only way she wants it is the only way I don’t want it? What if I fuck this up again?”
“You will never lose me, I will always be here for you, no matter how hard it will be. I apologise for not realising this before, but I will do everything in my power to see you happy. Please, don’t cry anymore, John.”
The title cannot be longer than 255 letters. This makes me sad. Will write the chapter title into the chapter itself! Anyway, this is probably it for the next two weeks because.. real life. Mentioned that before I think. But I'm at it so thank you for reading it :)
I hope you had great Christmas days and a great last week of the year, please be careful celebrating and I'll see you all next year! :)
“What now?” John asked and Sherlock retreated to the kitchen. Only a moment later he gestured John to sit in his usual armchair, a plate of cookies in hies hand.
John actually sighed with relief when he saw Sherlock sitting against a crate in the middle of the roof. It meant he didn’t have to go looking for him, scared it might be too late, and it meant he was in no imminent danger of falling.
“She lost the baby and thinks I’m in love with you. There’s something weird about it, though. I can’t get rid of the feeling she planned it, or there’s more to it or anything.”
Sherlock’s head jerked up and he looked like he wanted to snap something, but at the same moment the door behind them opened and in the next second, Greg was on Sherlock’s other side. He nodded briefly to John, then started to mumble words to the detective. John didn’t understand what he was saying and instead of trying to listen more closely, he tuned everything out.
Trying to brace himself, John went through his options if he found Sherlock. He would try to talk to him, see what had done this….
“It is funny how you’re trying to convince yourself of a truth that would be so much easier to like. But John, I know you, and you are the most loyal man I know. And I know one thing that also never changes: If Sherlock Holmes calls - actively or indirectly like today - then you’ll come running to protect him. And I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, because it’s a very honorable character trait, but I will always stand back against him.”
When they finally pulled apart, John blushed a deep red and whispered: “I swear, it’s all the cookies. They were a full success, Sherlock…”
“Thanks, Greg”, he said, sitting down. Their beers came and for the first half of their glasses they just sat in silence, watching the people in the pub.
Suddenly, John’s mood was awful again, and he actually needed effort to not snap at Mary when he said: “I’m going to get some rest. Thank you for the tea.”
“Man, I’m sorry to hear that… But tell me, what did Mycroft want from you? Does this have to do with the weird way Sherlock’s acting recently?”
"Yes. I'm sorry Sherlock but I can't change how I'm feeling", John said with a voice that wasn't as steady as he had hoped.
“No idea what I’m supposed to do now. I mean, I don’t want to lose Mary but seriously, I can’t just let Sherlock do… whatever he does.”
He typed a quick “Sherlock on roof, come fast” without sending it, then pushed open the topmost door of St Bart’s.
“But why am I here? I am sure I didn’t sign up for the night shifts, and you have other people for emergency calls”, John mumbled, still confused.
John flinched. He had wanted to keep Sherlock out of this, if even just for his own sake, but he should’ve known it was impossible.
As soon as John had left Mary’s room, he pulled out his phone and started to text. He didn’t know if Greg was free or if he even wanted to listen to him again, but since he already knew what was going on, John wouldn’t have to tell more people about his problems.
He tried to steady his pace so as not to attract attention but he found himself nearly running by the time he took the second stairs.
“Love?”, he asked, his tension clearly hearable. John flinched and said: “Did I say that? Shit, I’m sorry, Sherlock, it was kind of automatically, I didn’t even think about it, please don’t think too much of it. The rest is true, though. I am very sorry!”
“Sherlock…” John cautiously began, “you do know that we’re in March, right? Christmas was almost three months ago, and we even celebrated it, at your parents’ place.”
Sherlock pulled out a list and crossed out some lines, then said: “Next would be… Dancing or board games are common, I believe. I guess I’m getting the Cluedo then?”
They were in a small house that had been empty for years, and according to the smell it had taken about a week to discover this body.
Thanks to everyone for your support, it really helps, even though it's just a few comments. Everything counts!
Greg had implied that he could be in love with someone else than Mary, and John hadn’t even felt hurt about it. That really confused him.
“Please, honey, let’s just talk about this and then let’s be okay again. I miss you”, she admitted and felt her heart ache as she spoke the truth out loud.
“John, hey, it’s Greg… Greg Lestrade”, the DI said. “Listen, I heard what happened with your wife and… I can understand if you want to be with her now, I just wanted to say if you need someone to talk to or not talk to… I know that we never really had to do with each other but I still consider you a friend. You probably knew this but just in case you didn’t. Anyway, I’m always available.”
The thought scared him and he shook his head to get rid of these thoughts and took a large gulp of beer.
“You want another one? It’s on me”, Greg offered, so John just agreed. He hadn’t counted his beers, but one more was okay, he was certain.
. He had no idea how he had come here, or what had happened, he only knew that he wanted to go back to the sweet oblivion he had been in. He didn’t want to see things, hear things,
John comes home with his mind cleared, but it isn't as easy as he thought it would be to make his future work.
“You should find a compromise, one that works for both you and Mary. And if one of you isn’t willing to look for one, then you should rethink the situation. Don’t give yourself up for your wife. It’s never worth it, believe me.”
“It’s not dangerous, I promise! They’re supposed to make you happy and maybe a bit lightheaded and careless, but it’s not drugs. I can’t tell you what it is now because it might affect your behaviour, but after this evening I will give you the whole case file and you will know everything. So please just go with it?”
“I know, at least I tell myself that I do. But now that she lost the baby… She need me, in a way that I’m not there for her, and it’s all my fault and then I feel like I’m lying to her all the time although I’m telling her everything I know and even this Sophie person makes me insecure and I’m not used to being insecure!”
As he entered the flat he immediately saw the chaos created by the paramedics and he suddenly wondered who had called them. Had the neighbours heard Mary’s shouts?
She hoped he wouldn’t avoid her question now that he had his answers, but luckily John’s sense of fairness got hold of him.
John sipped at his tea and let Mary put a hand on his shoulder. She leaned in to kiss him, but John just moved his head slightly so her lips met his cheek. He didn’t know why but somehow he couldn’t stand her striking distance.
The longer Sherlock thought over it, the more it seemed just like a nightmare to him. The only thing that proved that this had actually happened was John, who refused to speak with Sherlock again.
“So… so this is it, then? This is us? Are you trying to tell me that you just want to end this because I failed to be there for you once, after all this time?”, John raised his voice until Mary flinched at every word.
When he approached the building, everything seemed normal. It was a busy day and people were hurrying in and out of the front doors, so it was no problem for John to blend in with the crowd and avoid being seen by people that might have known him.
“If we can’t have your birthday in London this year, I’m happy to make the trip.” Uncle Mycroft ruffled her hair. “Sit down, Princess, there’s plenty to eat.
Grezzik nodded and tossed away the rock. Before it hit the ground, the man in black was on him. He wrapped his arms around Grezzik’s waist and squeezed as hard as he could. Grezzik stood patiently, waiting for the man to tire.
"She's very sweet, " Molly said quietly. "I know you can't tell me everything, but...John, is she in danger?"
“Where are the rest of you?” John asked. “You lot are safe in here, the executioner is…indisposed. But we’re looking for someone older.”
"This is wonderful!" Holmes said, and Watson could only agree. "Certainly a decent eternity, wouldn't you say, my dear?"
“I would not say such things if I were you.” The grin was gone from Jamiarty’s face, replaced by an unsettling stillness.
Miss Winter stared at me. “And you wouldn’t be ashamed to call me a relation, Doctor? I don’t intend to change much of who I am.”
“Ireni gave orders too! We wait when a job goes bad, wait where we started!” The woman’s words were slurred. “I am waiting for Ireni…”
The first took place in London, and the church was full to the brim. Old clients, most of Scotland Yard...Kitty even saw a few of the circle of informants her fathers had cultivated so carefully.
No one felt like eating dinner that night, but Kitty made some soup anyways. Once Rachel and Billy were in bed, she and Stan laid down, still fully dressed, in the bed next to her fathers. The old men weren't speaking, but in the dim lamp light Kitty could see that their hands were entertwined, their heads close together.
Ireni stood before the table and bowed. “All I have is a promise for the next full moon. I’ve got something to show you at the tallest tower.”
By the time Waverly threw on her favourite dress and got all her siblings up (they had a nurse but she was
“Alright,” Billy said easily. He could tell he’d upset his grandfather. “Tell me about your bees, Grandfather Sherlock.”
“His opponent was about three feet shorter than him,” Jamiarty declared, standing. “He can’t possibly be that dangerous. No, we need to track the Princess. We may be his only hope. And if he dies…well. Guilder will pay.”
The one he’d called Bob launched himself at Anderson, but Anderson took one step forward and knocked Bob flat. The guard groaned on the ground.
Watson smiled sleepily, reaching out a hand and caressing Sherlock's face. "Knew you would be. I got Christmas ready for you."
Sally shuddered. She couldn’t kill her brother, or even order his death. That made her no better than Jamiarty. There had to be another way.
Her father chuckled. “No, child. You might have to bend slightly. You get your height from your mother.”
“I n-never meant to hurt John!” Sally sobbed. “Never, I just wanted to show you for what you were, and why not have people think you were a fraud in the bargain?”
“We are not enemies,” Grezzik said. That seemed like the most important question. Best to do them in order. “My name is Grezzik, and this is—this is Maria. And Stam.”
“We don’t need to be quite so subtle now; speed is of the essence. So we came by ship and disguised ourselves only so we could get through without spies knowing for sure that—”
Watson snapped. He reached forward and snatched the needle, tossing it on the table behind him. “What lie, Sherlock? Why would you lie to me about this.” He checked around him, but there were no sounds from downstairs. Mrs. Hudson must have gone to bed. “Sherlock, dear, tell me. What’s going through your mind?” He reached out and took hold of his lover’s shoulders, who shuddered under the touch.
“Meanwhile, Molly, you and Grezzik will run with Sally and the King to the Heir place. Try to avoid fatalities if you can, you’re good at that. Queen Bella will stay here with Waverly, to make sure that she’s safe.”
"He showed it to me when he thought I was his," Kitty whispered. "God, I loved him so much, and I wanted him, and we were going to get married, and I was going to fix his broken heart. This was before Goldie, you see. Then he showed me the whole thing...even my own page."
“Sherlock, I’ve thought long and hard about what I wanted to say to you, because all you said was ‘could be dangerous’…and here I am. Here we are. I want to tell you that I'll wake up every morning with you and solve crimes and watch bad telly and hold hands at crime scenes, and I know that I want to give you everything you want from me, but…dear, I mean so much more than that. I suppose the best thing I can tell you now is that I was so alone, and now I’m not, and I am so grateful that we are together. And I swear that I will tell you that every day of our lives in as many ways as I can think of, and show you when I can’t tell you anymore, because I love you, Sherlock Holmes, and I always will.”
John lowered his voice—“when we’re in bed together. Something’s happened Sherlock, that’s messed with your system, Sherlock.”
There was a whoop from the living room. John poked his head out and saw Kitty laughing as Lily and Jacob were bouncing up and down on the couch cushions.
In a moment of sentimentality, Mycroft buys Greg a sculpture of a goldfish. Greg doesn’t get it until Sherlock explains.
Waverly knew that Uncle John used to be a pirate, and Uncle Sherlock used to be a Princess. She didn’t really understand how that had changed, or what exactly a ‘Carrier’ was—her mother used to be one, that was for sure, but she wasn’t quite sure of the purpose. Mama and Papa had said that heirs could be adopted when they became King and Queen. Grandfather agreed, and delighted in all their grandchildren, blood and adopted. Abdication agreed with him and Grandmother.
John sat down next to her. "I can't imagine what he did to you," he said quietly, "but I promise that we will get him, one way or another. And we'll help you find happiness. Sherlock's grand at that."
“And get past sixty men, the Prince and all the rest of his guards in the process,” Miracle Max retorted. “That doesn’t sound safe, and he’s not going to be at full strength, you realize.”
“You are not the only one aging, John. I am not a young man, and the world has changed. There is still room for my method, but others will supplement it, ones that I do not fully comprehend. The old guard is moving on, Watson—time to pass the torch.”
Dreading the scene he’d find, Watson climbed the stairs, his leg twinging painfully. He ignored it; rain always made it hurt, and the exertion of the night had been pointless, why bother coddling it? If he’d only been faster…
Philip had just kissed her hard, and then gone to wait by the docks. Sally didn’t really know what he was thinking.  He would be her King, or her Prince Consort, or something, and their child would be a Princess.
The smile stayed with him through supper, as they drove Kitty, Stan and Mycroft back to town (there wasn’t quite enough room at the cottage, and while Mycroft didn’t complain they knew he needed a full bed), tucked the children into bed after one last story. Watson slipped out of the room as his husband pulled out his violin and began playing a soft lullaby.
“That was a warning. Where I come from there are penalties for liars.” He dragged Sherlock to his feet.
“It is the sound of Ultimate Suffering,” Maria answered, running in the direction of the sound. “My heart made that sound when Count Magnussen slew my father. Princess Sherlock marries tonight, who else has cause for that noise?”
Princess Janine was ready for war, as were their allies in Sanctaphrax, Regalia, and Archenland. Jamiarty was becoming more and more dangerous, and the sooner that problem was dealt with, the better. Of course, that was giving Jamiarty what he wanted, and none of them really wanted to fight, but it was the best solution.
Ireni started to chant in a language that Molly didn't understand, and the chant ended with a flash of sunlight. Grezzik's arms went slack, and he dropped the bag he was holding. Molly caught it before it hit the ground.
“The good doctor may use my bed for the night, Mrs. Hudson,” Holmes said. “Should I need to sleep, I’ll use the sofa.”
“He told me that he killed her when he was ten. She was seven. He knew that his stepmother couldn’t have kids, and she was a possible heir. He didn’t want her there, so he hunted a poisonous flower. The King thought she died of fever, which was more or less true, I suppose.”
It was Mycroft who answered. “He said ‘as you wish’, little brother, the same thing he has always said. Are you going deaf?”
“You can’t see—right, of course you can’t.” Ireni looked up at Sally’s father. “You’ve been poisoned, your Grace. And I recognize the magic.” She reached out for Waverly and touched the baby’s cheek. “It was the witch who stole Waverly.”
“Ah, Ronald. Please take the prisoner to the dungeon. He will be guarded by Miracle Max, who I believe will arrive shortly with my wife. Tell everyone to stand down. We have a new Heir, and she and her family are tired. We all need sleep.”
“Pft. I’ve never worked for so little in my life, not even for friends. Except once, and that was a noble cause.”
When Mary Morstan was four, she was always afraid. Mummy was kind, but she was often working at the hospital or busy at home, trying to keep her husband’s home clean. Father, on the other hand, was always home, but Mary didn’t like being around him, because he drank so much and was still always thirsty. As long as he had drinks within reach, he didn’t pay attention to her. She was supposed to be a boy, after all. When he didn’t have drinks within reach, he would go on a rampage, looking for bottles that weren’t there, punishing Mary and her mother for them being gone. Mary got good at hiding.
There was a scuffling sound at the other end of the phone, then John came on—clearly, obviously John. "Hello, Greg? What just happened? Sherlock's gone upstairs, and he's muttering about...bad news?"
The terrain became difficult instantly. Sherlock wished for Skull; his horse was excellent at navigating the woods. Instead, they spent a couple of hours crawling and creeping through the forest, trying to stay on track without being able to see the sun. When they rested, John climbed a tree to check their direction.
Watson sighed deeply as he put his medical bag down in the hall. No point taking it upstairs; he couldn’t stand to look at it. All its instruments and medicine hadn’t helped the devastated young woman they’d had to leave behind in that old, now horribly empty house.
Of course, neither Mycroft nor Janine trusted Jamiarty as far as they could throw him. So they sent spies into Florin, both to the little villages and the larger cities. One person was at the castle, but that person, of course, wasn’t Anderson. The former spy’s cover had been blown when he left with Sally, and Mycroft refused to risk him when he had a child coming. Anderson still knew plenty about Florin though, so he planned each mission. Stam consulted with him, and went on some missions with darkened eyes, a hood and long gloves (priests were an excellent cover). Every time that a spy came back, Anderson would hear the report, no matter the time.
In the book it says that Kitty got a sentence—the lightest one possible—but it also says that Watson wasn’t living at Baker Street so….I do what I want.
Set during 'The Hounds of Baskerville'. A different take on Sherlock's reaction to seeing "the hound".
“I’m glad you two are together again,” Stam replied. He yanked the scarves tight, trapping Jamiarty’s ankles against the rough edges of the chair. “It wasn’t right, you being apart.”
It wasn't that John disliked the people at the Yard. Some, like Greg (and Dimmock somehow) were friends outside of the crime scenes and interview rooms. Others like Johnson and Bradstreet were acquaintances that he enjoyed talking to, although they didn't try to spend time together outside of work. There were a few rare birds like Donovan and Anderson who he actively disliked, but they were easy enough to avoid even in a small room like this.
Moriarty was infuriatingly calm for someone who was inches away from plummeting to their death. "What, you think my goons will stop shooting just because I'm dead? You've clearly never met Seb. The others are loyal enough to my cash—they'll finish the job. Doesn't matter, really. Would you really trade one for the other two?"
His father was a lawman, and he worried deeply about his large son. He wanted Grezzik to be happy, but they lived in a tiny Turkish town, and Grezzik would never fit in there. So when a travelling performance group came to town, he asked if Grezzik could join them.
Mycroft tilted his head. “I continue to find it astonishing that I know exactly what you mean when you speak that way.”
Holmes stepped forward first, Watson only a step behind. The door was unlocked, the key shining in the handle. Holmes put it carefully into his pocket and opened the door.
Prince Jamiarty presented his future bride with all aplomb, releasing doves in the hundreds (to be hunted later). Sherlock joined him on the balcony for the first time, wearing a blood-red tunic and breeches. His hair was curlier now, still jet black, and his hands were callused only from the strings of his violin, a present from his fiancé. His eyes were still cold as they swept over the people who were once his peers, but no one minded.
“I hope that’s true.” Jamiarty pursed his lips. “How about this? You write four copies of a letter, and I will send my four fastest ships in each direction. The
Fully dressed and freshly shaved, John opened the bathroom door, checked quickly to see that the bedroom door was still closed (it was), and crept into the kitchen…
John turned back to the street, where Sherlock was staring up. John gave him a thumbs up, and his heart broke again when Sherlock collapsed, dropping to his knees.
The woman's hair was damp, her throat hoarse. It had been hours now, long hours of pain with nothing to be done, nothing to do. The woman had experienced helpless pain before, and the memories this agony triggered were damning her anticipation, her enjoyment of knowing that the months of waiting were at last at an end.
Watson does write poetry sometimes, very badly. There was one very good piece, written at three in the morning in frustration as he tried to sort out his love for his dead wife and his love for his living husband. Entitled simply ‘Two Halves’, it tells the story of a man who was never made to choose and therefore got both his heart’s desires, yet fears he deserves neither.
Sherlock had woken hours ago and was doing research in the London library while Molly and Janine tried to bathe Sally, to give her some kind of hold on herself, some hope that she wouldn’t always hurt so much. But at sunset, Sherlock came back empty-handed.
It took less than eight seconds for Maria to be disarmed, but they felt like a long eight seconds for the Count. Her brilliance was only in her fingers then, but there was a hint. Just a hint.
Watson swallowed hard as he cradled the baby close. Quiet as anything, Billy blinked up at him, big blue eyes like his mother's assessing this new face. 'Hello, Billy," Watson said, voice thick. "Welcome to this world." He rocked the child for a moment. "Shall I introduce you to your other namesake?"
Princess Janine stepped forward and took Molly’s hand. “Well, Molly, you have your name again. Does that mean you have your justice?”
"I want him gone." There was a terrible hollowness in her voice now. "I want him gone from my life, from my memories. I wasn't happy before we met, not really, but I had some idea that I could be happy someday. Now I don't believe that. So I want him gone. I want him to suffer."
Donovan raised her eyebrows. "Well, you might last longer than I thought. Unless when he does take you to bed you disappoint him."
When Molly Hooper was eighteen, she waved goodbye to Mum and Dad and went to university. She thought about being a doctor, but talking with live people made her nervous, even though Dad promised her that lots of people were kind and good. She had one good teacher who talked about working in a morgue, and that was it—in just a few years she started at St. Bart’s, her Dad’s alma mater. Mum and Dad were so proud, and Dad was quite excited that she was working with Mike Stamford, his friend’s son, who was a dear if not terribly interesting. Molly wanted someone exciting and romantic, not knowing that her Mum had that exact same plan when she met Father.
They’d found Stark with Lisa’s help, and chased him halfway across London. They finally caught up with him under the Eye, but Stark was an excellent shot and desperate. His first shot went just over John’s head; would have collided if he hadn’t stumbled.
When Mary Morstan was nine, Jacob moved into their house. He built Mary a beautiful doll house and painted her pictures. He gave her a new name, with Mummy’s permission. “Mary’s a grown-up girl’s name,” he said with a chuckle. “Why don’t you be Molly while you’re little?”
Watson had been very cold about it, colder still when Holmes explained that Watson didn't need to go. Why subject both of them to an uncomfortable train ride?
“She could get up the Cliffs by magic,” Miracle Max said. “We’ve already seen that she can fly. But teleportation…no. That’s not possible solo. You need a team of witches to do that.”
“No.” John paused. “But Sherlock, think about Kitty’s biological family. From what she’s told us, they’re quite fortunate they’re dead and out of our reach. But she’s brilliant with kids.”
“I do. And I know what was done to you, too. And I also know that you are the most wonderful woman that I have ever met, brave and strong and true and funny.” He cradled her face in his hands. “I love you, Kitty, and that’s the most important thing that I have ever known. And if you can try to love me too…”
The ride was the longest of Molly's life. The horses were fast, faster than any she'd ever seen, but no one was speaking. The carriage wasn't the royal one, just a large one used for servants, and it was hardly a comfortable ride. No one dared to complain, though, and no one could think of anything else to talk about. Their whole future lay at the end of the road. Even the King and Queen were silent, wearing peasant clothes with their crowns stored under their seats.
When Mycroft starts trying to exercise, it’s not to impress Greg. It’s to give them a few more years together.
Sherlock drew John close, and the voice was quiet, and his mind was quiet, and all he could feel was John. Holmes was crying, Watson holding his hand.
"I know, dear." John traced Sherlock's cheekbones. "I know, and now we know for sure, and we just made a really big promise, and we're joyful about it, and that's what makes this night special. It's another first."
He was on the phone with Stan as Sherlock typed up their latest case (ever since they got married, their readers had begged for both of them to post about cases to compare them. Sherlock obliged, though he still got stroppy when people said John’s writing was more ‘relatable’).
“Oh God…” Grandfather John didn’t speak for a moment. Billy heard a choked sob. Sickened, he stumbled away from the cottage. He couldn’t go in now, he had to give them some time, time to compose themselves.
“That would be unwise,” Holmes agreed, arm still interlocked with Watson’s. “We’re just exploring the park by night. Wandering urges, you see.”
Surprised by the lack of sniping, no matter how affectionate, John just watched as Holmes pulled his brother towards the table, chatting quickly in French about the experiment. Watson went into the kitchen.
"It appears to be a mingling of both of our favourite places," Holmes said thoughtfully. "I rather like it. I'm not quite sure what that is, though." He pointed to the television.
The other two were still. It was impossible to tell what they were thinking with the swirling fog around.
This seemed to convince John, who leaned back in his chair. “I know what we’re all doing today,” he said presently.
John sat up. They were approaching the London docks, and the whole city was ablaze in the sunrise. It was larger than Marseille, larger than the capital, and John felt very small. He was used to the open sea, a ship where all were loyal to him…
Not, of course, before they danced with their daughter and son to a Celine Dion song Stan had insisted on
Russell Square Gardens was not an ordinary place for weddings, but John insisted— “one of the most important conversations I’ve ever had happened here,” and Mike agreed, very glad that he'd taken a walk on his lunch that January day—and when you’re marrying the British Government’s little brother, rules can be bent with the greatest of ease.
John's fingers threaded into the curly mess of hair, yanked the now wide-eyed and taken aback teen's head and turned them around, slamming Sherlock forcefully into the wall and stretching up until he was on the tips of his toes and kissed him- hard. His heart palpitated wildly as he felt the tense teen slowly relax and place his hands awkwardly on John's hips. John pulled away and looked up at the other through his lashes.
“Good.” John replied, unwrapping his food and eating it while staring at his client-slash-friend-slash-possibly boyfriend.
That day, John had thrown away his regular program in favor of actually learning about his patient. A patient he was growing quite fond of.
“I apologize but that is against protocol. Please, our appointment is over and it is time for you to leave. See you next week.”
Today, however, was their ten year anniversary. He never expects Sherlock to remember, let alone care, for such frivolous things. The man was definitely not normal, but that's what made him amazing to begin with, so imagine his surprise when he came home to a nice meal prepared on the table.
“I slipped in the shower… I called for you but you weren’t there… Oh, John, where did you go?”, she asked quietly and John could hear the pain in her voice.
John saw reason behind her words and nodded slowly. Without anything else, he turned around and made for the door. Just as he was about to leave the room, he stopped and said: “I’m sorry, Mary. I tried my best.”
Normally, he was there at least once a day, checking in on Sherlock, asking if he was fine and if there was a new case. But it had been four days now and there was nothing.
He had chosen not to greet Greg directly, although he couldn’t tell why. He wasn’t really in the more for more discussions, maybe he had wanted to sound more distant.
“He told me he loves me, I left him alone, he took drugs, possibly trying to kill himself, more than once, I tried to talk him out of it and left him alone again and he’s probably worse that before now. That doesn’t have anything to do with the fact that I love you, and I never wanted anything to change between us.”
Also, this chapter is way longer than the previous ones, I know. I did have the opportunity to cut it in two, but I thought I'd leave it like this and ask you: What do you prefer? Shorter chapters or longer ones? Especially with the plot I have planned, longer chapters should be doable, might take a bit longer to write though, depending on how busy I am with work and school.
“He’s my best friend, and that will not change. And I will try to make sure that he’s getting better now, because we both know that he’s a big unsensible baby and I’m probably the only one who can keep him away from drugs.”
He didn’t want to go back to Baker Street, this wonderful flat that he had shared with John for so long. Wonderful John... The empty flat now screamed you're alone! He left you! You were wrong!
John almost shouted the last bit, then looked around, embarrassed that someone might have heard him talk about his feelings. He’d never really done that anyway, why did he have to start now?
He shook his head and started walking to the pub, that was just around the corner, and arrived there just after Greg.
“I checked your phone this morning, to see if I needed to tell anyone that you’re in here. But to be fair, you shouldn’t get unsigned messages that have ‘darling’ in them!”
Mary returned with tea and cake, she even turned on the telly and brought a blanket for them to share. For a while, they sat in silence and zapped through the programs, jumping from a quiz show over a court show to a detective show and there they stopped. It felt familiar, and John instantly felt better. He smiled and grabbed Mary’s hand and even kissed her on the cheek.
“I am sure Mrs. Hudson has an eye on him and Mycroft would never let him do anything really stupid”, he tried to reassure more himself than Mary. She just shook her head and smiled sadly.
The detective sighed and let his head fall onto John’s shoulder. After a while that felt like only seconds to Sherlock, John did step back watching his friend cautiously.
Disappointed, he walked out, not sure if he just admitted something he’d rather kept hidden - from both Mary and also himself.
Mrs Hudson just shook her head, not sure whether answering was wise or not. Finally, she said: “Oh dear. I’m sorry. I really am. Look what he’s done to do. Let me bring you some tea.”
“Oh bloody hell, does this start again! If you took enough to see things, I should put you into hospital and check on you every ten seconds!”, John nearly yelled and then felt bad as Sherlock flinched.
He felt like a thirteen year old boy again, asking his mother for forgiveness, and suddenly he felt so small. Everything he did recently was a mistake, everyone around him got hurt because of him. Couldn’t he do anything right?
Sherlock pulled out two boxes, neatly wrapped in green and red paper with reindeer heads on it; one he gave to John immediately, the other after half a minute of waiting.
mind. I'm not the only one out there. What about your friends? Mrs Hudson, Greg, Molly? They all care about you. Be a little less selfish and keep it together."
“Oh, John, you got me the new book about tobacco that I eyed for a while now! Thank you so much, how did you know this would be the perfect present?” Sherlock exclaimed and John laughed.
"Sherlock, do you have something? I can't give you much longer, and you know that. Please tell me that you can help us."
The last words were so soft something broke in Sherlock and he had to stand up and turn away from John to wipe his tears.
(Sorry, couldn't find it on Youtube, at least not available in my Country. You have to take this one x) Also, yes, I changed "her" to "him". I think that's close enough?)
“What will you do now?”, Greg asked curiously but John only shrugged. If he knew that he probably wouldn’t be here, drinking.
It took him ten minutes longer that normal to get home, but finally he sat down on his bed and didn’t know what to do now. He should probably go to sleep but so many different thoughts were racing in his head, he just couldn’t.
“John…”, Sherlock started, but his voice died and the doctor didn’t want to hear it anyway. Luckily, his phone rang and he shot an apologetic glance to Sherlock before answering.
He cleared his throat and explained how he had talked to Mycroft when Mary had apparently slipped, and that he had been brought to the hospital to find out she had lost the child.
Upset wasn’t the word he would’ve used to describe his feelings but on the other hand, he didn’t know how he looked at the moment. Maybe he didn’t show anything from what was going on inside him, and he wasn’t sure if he wanted Mary to know.
“I’ll just wait until tomorrow, I guess. See what Mary says. She seemed pretty determined so… I just hope she comes to her senses.”
"Sherlock. I don't care if you think I'm not real. I'm here and I want you to come out with me. I mean. Come out of this room, not.. you know."
He was so tired suddenly, he wanted nothing more than to be at home with a cup of tea and some crap telly.
John had left him because he wasn’t what he wanted him to be. But… he never had been, right? Sherlock had never fulfilled anybody’s expectations so that feeling shouldn’t be new to him.
He saw the body on the pavement, the blood; felt the drag of the paramedics; the people shoving him away just to get a good
my number one, but… I accept that maybe I didn’t show it enough. I didn’t want you to feel that you come only second, after anyone, especially now. I am very sorry and I hope you’ll give me the chance to make it up to you.”
he had done had set this off; or finding nothing and having to start looking again, never certain if he would be in time.
His friend, however, did not respond and instead opened the door. John thought his heart might stop of shock.
Only after ten minutes he realised what was different about this car: The windows weren’t tinted, they were completely black. Where did they bring him that he shouldn’t know before?
In a lower voice, he continued: “The only reason I’m  not doing this is because I know I can fix you here, and Mary is in hospital, so I don’t want to go there at the moment.”
Annoyed, he decided to end this conversation here, and put the phone on the night drawer. He had to get up and prepare for the discussion with Mary. He wondered if he could just not go to the hospital since she probably had no way of reaching him, but that wouldn’t solve his problems anyway.
My whole story plays after His Last Vow, but Sherlock did not get sent away. I don't know how I explained that in my head when I started writing the story but.. I'll think of something and then rewrite the first chapters to include the explanation and hopefully a clearer indication as to when it plays. Sorry for that!
He barely couldn’t believe himself asking this, but the scent was without doubt coming from Sherlock’s kitchen, not Mrs. Hudson’s.
“Don’t worry, I prepared something for you to give to me as well. This way, it is also guaranteed to be of my taste.”
“You’re probably confused because of the hormones in your body. You should maybe sleep a bit before you do anything you’ll regret.”
I haven't even proofread it so if you find any obvious mistakes, please point them out. I am so sorry if you do.
Hey there, I'm sorry it's been so long! I don't really have an excuse, sorry. I'm a lazy and forgetful person and that doesn't really work well. But I promise never to abandon this story, I'm just sorry about the waiting times :x
Soon enough he was standing in front of the door, and now his heart was beating so fast he was sure he’d collapse soon. A little part of him wished he had walked more slowly; he was suddenly so scared of opening the door although he couldn’t say what would be worse. Stepping through it and finding Sherlock, seeing him overdosing or close to it, knowing that
Well, the facts. He was already crying, he didn’t want her to know all about his emotions. This was enough.
Surely it couldn't go back to how it was before, but their time together had been so special, how could they give up everything they had had now?
“So. You said something about crime scene. How’s it going? Hope I’m not keeping you from important inquiries you have to make?”, John asked, mainly to kill the silence that had grown quite uncomfortable.
, a small voice in the back of his head said and John flinched. Wasn’t there anything he could do to prevent this?
“Wait a moment, John, who’s Sophie?”, Greg asked and the doctor blinked confused. Hadn’t he mentioned her last time? Ah, no, that had happened this morning. The last days had been such a mess, it seemed so blurry to him now. Or was that the beer? He hadn’t eaten anything today, he might react a bit to it, and he had already had two… no, three.
The next morning, he was woken up by Mary’s phone getting what felt like one hundred text messages in a row. He cursed and rolled over to grab the mobile, which was still lying on the bed where he had found it yesterday. He wasn’t curious - well, okay, maybe a bit - but he figured if someone had tried to meet her, they wouldn’t know about her accident, so he accessed the phone. It was only three messages, all from an unknown number.
His childhood had been normal, he’d had normal friends that played with him at normal times, on the playground or at home. He’d been good in school because he always did his homework, always studied, always did what his parents said. When he went to college, they had been so proud and he had done everything to let it stay this way.
John hesitated. The rooftop still brought back unwanted memories, even just talking about it, and somehow it felt… too intimate to tell Mary about it. Which was stupid, because she as his wife and he loved her.
“Actually, I think I should go. The flat’s a mess and I want to at least get something right. Thanks a lot for the talks and… hope to see you around.”
He wrote a note for Mary who was taking a shower right now and she would probably be mad when he got back but he was too numb to care about it. The only thing he could think about were Sherlock's words.
“Actually, Greg, I just wanted to go to the pub. I could really use some distraction after these past few days so if you’re free I’d be happy to meet you there.”
He thought he knew where his friend was, thought he had deduced it from the small hints Mycroft had let slip through, but there was always the chance that he was wrong.
He spat out those last words and only after it felt how wrong this all was. In his head it hat sounded so justified, but now the words were hanging in the air and John just wanted to crawl in a corner.
Her voice trembled but the words still came out firm and hard and they made John angry. Now even his bloody wife thought he was in love with Sherlock Holmes!
the rooftop, not below, and Sherlock was with him, no on his way down, and he couldn’t hold back now.
Hey! Sorry for not keeping my promise - wait, I didn't promise, did I? Anyway, here it goes! I can promise that I will NOT stop writing, it might just always take a while... I'm sorry for that. Enjoy it nonetheless, I hope! Sorry for all Johnlock-shippers - this is a bit of torture, probably. But Mary does love him! Stick with me, please :)
He looked proud for a moment, then he seemed to remember who he was talking to and his face fell immediately.
I want to be your everything, the person you come home for, the one you want to survive for when you’re chasing criminals.
wife darling?? He hoped there was a name in the last one, so he could show that idiot who he was messing with.
As softly as possible, John said: “I’m not leaving you, you’re shutting me out. Why are you up here? I thought that after yesterday we were fine for now, what changed?”
Sherlock smiled and sat across him, offering him cookies, which tasted wonderful. John forgot about the weird dinner, about Sophie and Hockey-Mark, about Mary and the dead child. All he felt was Christmas, and he found that Sherlock had done a very convincing job in recreating the holiday.
His gaze was drawn to the edge of the roof, and even though he had seen it from another perspective last time, he could only too easily imagine Sherlock standing there, spreading his arms, falling.
It's a bit short but I hope you still like it. It doesn't add tooooo much to the story but I still found it necessary to include :)
John was just around the corner as a well-known black car pulled up right next to him and he sighed. This was the last thing he needed right now, but he knew Mycroft well enough to be aware of the fact that he couldn’t hide.
The smoke cleared a bit as John waved his hand through it, and Sherlock finally appeared in John's sight. A bit blurry still but at least something.
John nodded and bent over to kiss her forehead, and it filled Mary with indescribable joy. That small gesture signalled enough love and affection to nearly make up for the last week, and she was optimistic for the first time in a while that was longer than she wanted to admit. Even with the loss of the baby - maybe they could still be a family.
John smiled a bit nervously, then recited the conversation with Mary. For some reason he couldn’t explain he left out Sophie. Somehow it didn’t seem right to him.
Not only did it hurt to hear John talking to him, to do what he had always done, taking care of him; but he also started to feel guilty now. He thought that after telling John how he felt, after seeing John leave him, his friend would feel better not having him around. Instead, it seemed to be worse than ever. When was the last time he had seen John this miserable? He couldn't even remember.
he tried to tell himself but he wouldn't listen. There was a corpse lying right in front of him, everything he had ever needed before, but it wasn't enough now.
Grinning, he started to pay more attention to the show again, calling out all the irregularities he found. They had a rule, though - the most obvious one would be for Sherlock to name, and then he would insult all the characters on the show. John had already spotted a likely candidate, and it could only be seconds until Sherlock’s voice would yell out that they were all stupid.
His smile was a bit creepy, but the doctor was just glad to escape Mycroft, so he nodded relieved and followed (this time) Anthea out to the car.
Panic was rising in the army doctor, these words sounded like someone had died, and John was suddenly so scared that Sherlock had overdosed or hurt himself in any other way that it came like some sort of shock to him as he entered the hospital room after Sarah and saw Mary in the bed at the window.
This chapter is a bit longer and I'm quite happy with that. Hope you are, as well! I still suck at Sherlock's deductions, but I tried to fit some not so obvious stuff in it. :s
“Where have you been?”, Mary asked, barely louder than before. John thought about making something up but he couldn’t think of any situation that would’ve sounded important enough except for the truth.
He told Mary as much, and she threw him a puzzled look. Didn’t she believe him? She was supposed to be on his side! But it seemed she wasn’t better than Mycroft...
"I… I am sorry, Sherlock. I didn't mean to do this. I.. I should go", he said, uneasy, and turned to walk away.
“You don’t even have your phone”, her husband shot back and she resisted the urge to throw her hands into the air.
“He’s on intensive care, I’m really surprised he’s still alive, I’m sorry, you can’t see him now, please come back another time,” a friendly but stern doctor told him and John felt like throwing the man to the wall and crushing him. Bus hit common sense told him it wasn’t their fault, and so he just decided to go home.
(Did I promise less Rise Against? Woops. That chapter was already written then. And it fits so nicely :( Sorry!)
