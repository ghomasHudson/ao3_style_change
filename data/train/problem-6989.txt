an Avenger in every sense that matters and always have been, even if Fury and SHIELD were slow on the uptake.”
“Nuh-uh,” Rhodey said. “Gonna . . . gonna help ya t’bed.”
Pepper ran her fingers through his hair affectionately.
Romanov blinked, but refused to take a step back at his approach.  She answered perfectly calmly, “The Law is a tough field for submissives; I thought you’d identify with a fellow sub who’d succeeded in a Dominated field.”
The Honorable Captain,

“Not my AI JARVIS-- Jarvis.  Our butler when I was a kid.”
?) “You had several bone fractures, bruised ribs, and a concussion, but none of that could explain the coma, particularly its length.” Pepper’s fingers clenched his hand for a second. “They weren’t sure if—“ Pepper shook her head, blinking quickly.
“Hi, buddy,” Tony called, with no voice modulator. He was wearing the full suit except for the helmet, which he held in his arms. Hulk sniffed at him, bored.
“Uh, everything ok, Tony?” Bruce asked.  “Steve said you were working. Uh?”
They parted and Steve finally looked at the card.
“Of course, Sir.”
Rhodey. So, if you wanted to tell me about him, your best friend . . .”
Infinite thanks to my beloved long-distance beta, thatwhichyields.  If you like this story and are happy to think it's gonna be a long one, you have her to thank! :-)
JARVIS killed the zombies and Tony touched down with Rogers still under his arm.  The faceplate flipped up automatically on landing, so Tony heard with his own ears Rogers’ breathless, “That was
Tony poured himself a fresh cup of coffee.
“Does it even run!?” Tony repeated, sputtering with mock offense. “Would I give you a decorative motorcycle? Of course she runs! And, not that she wasn’t a great little bike back in the day, but a genius engineer can definitely teach an old dog new tricks. Wanna take her for a spin? State of the art tech in old fashioned style.”
,” Tony whispered.  Steve’s hand tightened, not enough to restrict his air, but enough to be felt--a strong pressure.  “
“JARVIS, I changed my mind.  No more Metalica.  Get me some Black Sabbath.  And volume up.”
“Everybody, take your seats,” Mrs. Rhodes directed. “Captain, would you carve?”
him Dummy?!”
Really, though! The contract Tony’d sent Steve offered him virtually free reign—pretty much everything was on the menu except scat, sounding, messing with the arc reactor, and trying to put him in sub space.
“Hey, sleeping beauty!” Tony called as Bruce stepped into the lab.
Clint snorted, but Tony didn’t even care as he followed Steve eagerly to their bedroom.
In the end, two servings of rich pasta and two glasses of wine were his undoing. Tony was sleeping, head on Steve’s shoulder, before the Mines of Moria.
“Hmm?” Tony said. “What’s ‘hmmm’?”
Tony looked up at the blue energy field, trying not to picture spindly arachnoid limbs and the vast expanse of space beyond a glowing grey ship. Tony shuddered and refocused on the spectrometer readings.
Steve was startled when a note popped up almost immediately.  It read:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Tony, it’s seven.”
“I don’t think of you as an early riser, Stark,” she said with an amused smirk. “Steve rubbing off on you?”
Tony looked up from his calculations as Dummy whirred over to him excitedly with a piece of paper clutched in his claw.
The Captain sighs theatrically.
“I told you! Just send it to voicemail!  I don’t want to hear--”
Half an hour later, Clint slunk stealthlessly to the Christmas tree with a set of messily wrapped packages in his arms. Tony felt a wave of relief that he’d planned ahead with presents, even though nobody had actually
Tony activated internet stealth mode. He may click on their website, but like hell he’d let them know and get advertising money for it! He searched “Tony Stark” and under his Stark Industries profile and wikipedia entry, there was “news for Tony Stark” with a cover graphic from
“Right.  So what’s the remodeling?”
Tony bit his lip. He was definitely blushing now, the heat of it spreading down his neck to the arc reactor. But he’d already—they’d already— (It was ridiculous to be nervous!)
Tony sighed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re perfect,” Steve whispered and kissed Tony tenderly and gently. “So pretty when you come. So beautiful, sweetheart.”
“Likewise. Thank you for meeting me here,” she said, green eyes sparkling. “Please allow me to offer you a drink--compliments of my client. What would you like?”
“I just thought maybe sometimes we could have old fashioned date night and do all that stuff,” Tony said. “Not every time we go out--just like a special occasion. Agreed in advance.”
Anyway, there you have it.  Hope you liked it!  As always, comments are cherished and I love to know your favorite bits!  Thanks so much for reading!  (And, yes, I have a massive crush on Veronica Williams...)
“Shield.  It’s—” Steve swallowed again. “My safeword is shield.”
“Of course I do!” Tony huffed.
“What do you mean?” Rogers asked, but Tony had lost interest in him.  Fury himself was striding down the corridor with Romanov in tow.  (Yep, definitely have a bad feeling about this.)
“Oh fuck!” Tony cried, arms tightening around Steve.  Tony’s eyes were bright and wide, his cheeks flushed.   “Talk like that and we’ll never go to dinner. Scratch that—we’ll never go anywhere again.  I’ll just chain you to the bed and keep you here forever as my pleasure slave.”  Tony kissed him.  “God, you have no idea what you do to me, do you?”  Tony groaned.  “Only you could sound sweet and innocent while begging me to teach you how to deep-throat my cock.”
Thank you so much for sticking with me for so very long.  I hope you enjoy the new chapter.  It was quite a struggle!
They walked to the restaurant in silence, while scattered hipsters, businessmen, and the occasional fashionista swept past without signs of recognizing them.  (Thank God!)  Steve kept glancing over at Tony with a pensive expression Tony couldn’t quite read.  They walked, a solid foot between them and, after a few steps, Steve thrust his hands deep in his pockets.
(Shit.) Tony threw back the last of his coffee--he’d need it—then said hopefully, “And pancakes after? Right?”
Rhodey paused, apparently waiting for Tony to say something, but he’d lost the thread.
“What’s a shovel speech?” Steve asked once he caught his breath from Thor’s embrace.
“Wait—“ Rogers called, then said a little incredulously, “your response to that is to leave?”
Steve looked at him carefully for a few moments, frowning, before his expression cleared. He nodded and said, “Okay. Uh, good.”
“I’m too stuffed for popcorn,” Clint was saying, “but I still kinda want it. Because movie.”
Rogers spun to look at him in wide-eyed distress.
“You got us presents?” Steve asked, looking torn between pleasure and dismay.
“Mmm.”
Tony held up his hands in surrender: “I kid! I kid!”
Tony gave a wry smile. “Dunno, some of those society types are worse than aliens.” He laughed. “Trust me—I know. I’m one of them.”
Tony smiled at the sight of Steve’s ears turning pink with embarrassment.
“JARVIS?” Steve called out. “Could you please turn the heat up?”
“Mr. Stark,” Katie Winters said, walking into his hospital room at a slower clip than her usual long-legged stride. (A nod towards the solemnity of the occasion, no doubt.) “How are you feeling?”
“But tastier than yogurt.”
“Oh, fuck off.” Tony bristled defensively. “I’m allowed to--” (miss) “be a little miffed when my Dom decides to bounce for two days to play basketball right before we out ourselves to the public, ok?”
“Okay,” Bruce said, gazing into his teacup. He looked up, sad-eyed. “Tony? I didn’t mean to imply—I mean, I know how hard you’ve been working on all of this for me and—“
“And I’m really glad we . . . talked . . . earlier,” Steve said.  “It was—”  He closed his eyes for a moment and took a breath.  “

(The SRO would hardly smile on Fury’s contract, but not for
“Come on, buddy,” Tony said as they flew over the battle. “I need you on this. JARVIS is running all my speculative analysis. We’ve gotta find a way to shut that portal.”
Well, this meeting certainly wasn’t
“You’re so wonderful, Steve,” Tony murmured, caressing his neck and shoulders and leaving little kisses in Steve’s hair.  “I’m so fucking lucky to have you.”
Tony nearly shuddered with relief. (That’s all? First time jitters? Oh thank fucking God, thank—)
“Now, get out of my workshop,” he ordered, waving his hands, “I’m on a roll! Besides, it may be Friday, but it’s not dinnertime. See you then!”
“At least let me wax you!”
Tony’s mind was fuzzy and unfocused, but there was more— More questions he needed to--
—but he wasn’t sure it was even true and either way that explanation was hardly going to make it better.  Or maybe he should try, “hey, guess how many hungry people my foundation feeds in a year?”
“That’s wildly inappropriate,” Steve said flatly.
“But when you say it, people listen,” Tony said, a little bitterly.
“Why Rogers!” he exclaimed in an affectedly breathy voice, putting his hand over his heart. “Are you trying to take me on a
“Aw yeah? Were you really?” Steve said with a hint of teasing. “I wasn’t quite sure.”
(And, thank God, this time it sounded like a real apology.)
“Thank you, Tony,” he said, smiling and standing very near.  “I had a wonderful time.”
“Can you try?  For me?” Tony asked a moment later.  Steve sighed and nodded.  He thought for a while, then took a deep breath and tried again.
“And Fury agreed?”
The driver looked at them in his rearview mirror.
Tony hated going to SHIELD.  Hated the low hum of their air filters.  Hated the industrial lighting that made him look old and tired.  Hated the confusing, unmarked hallways.  Hated the whole place with a wild, fiery passion that he wished would make it
an accident.” He shrugged. “They let me take tests and do paperwork by hand after that. At least for a while.”
“Huh?”
“Oh, hey, are those photos of your kids?” Clint asked, barreling over.  Johnny seemed surprised.
As Clint and Natasha joked around and Bruce did his usual pre-socializing impersonation of Eeyore (spiced with Betty longing, but Tony’d learned not to poke that wasps’ nest), it became more and more obvious how silent and still Steve was.  If a person could sit at attention, he was doing it.
, Tony found it touching how transparently moved he was by the film. He would gasp, squeeze Tony’s hand, and even wiped his eyes a few times.  Tony felt his own prickle in sympathy; he hoped the Battle of Helm’s Deep didn’t bring back painful memories of The War.
“Mmm?”
Tony had schematics to work on. (He always had at least six projects going at a time.). But he was curious . . .
“Stuff for Stark Industries?  Oh, yeah-- how was your lunch meeting?”
. Just threw in that old Marvel crap as filler.”
“Tell him I’m on my way.”
KIRK: 2,228.7 to 1? Those are pretty good odds, Mister Spock.
I’m sorry.
Tony felt like there was still something missing, but the moment slipped past and Pep turned her attention back to the uniforms, saying, “So, walk me through the manufacturing.”
“It’s a decision he would make in consultation with the rest of the team: Dr. Banner, Agent Romanov, and Agent Barton.”
“They were supposed to learn persistence! Besides, they weren’t
Tony gave an incredulous little snort.  “It felt really fast.”
“JARVIS?  Metallica—no, wait.  Actually, let’s rock some Beyoncé. And get up the blueprints for the Avengers’ floors.”
“Tony.”  Rhodey sounded solemn.
“So, hey, you know if you ever want to talk about anything, I’m a way better listener than reports might lead you to suspect.”
actually,” Tony corrected.  Pepper shrugged.  “And, yes, you definitely know him.”  Tony paused to gather his courage—and seriously, why should this be hard?
“Sweetheart?” Steve called.
“Just coffee,” he said, but he’d hardly taken a step away when Steve grabbed his hand and darted down to place a chaste, furtive kiss on Tony’s cheek. Tony smiled.
Tony tossed down his pizza. “This is a terrible idea!”
Everyone stood.
research.”
“But you’d like that, right?” Steve asked, as if he couldn’t help himself and had to double-check. “Old fashioned date nights?”
“What about you?” Tony asked, gesturing to Steve’s notes.  “How’s that going?”
Steve stroked his balls and Tony jerked up a little, then tried to hold still.  (Yeah, rude to choke your partner.  Also, diminishes the chances of repeat blowjobs.)
Rhodey stood, staring. After a few long moments, he asked, “Is there something you wanna tell me?”
Stay safe and stay strong, friends!
“DID YOU KNOW?!?”
Otherwise he wouldn’t feel disappointed.
that. Rethreading was the worst.” He hesitated. “You probably already checked this, but was top tension wound too tight?”
“Nah, super-villains remember their last ass-kicking too vividly.  They won’t be stirring for a while.”
I’m back!  Sorry for the delay!  Travel, work, struggling to get this chapter right.  (Or, mostly right.)  And I learned how to use photoshop for this!
Fury frowned at him. “I don’t believe I was addressing you, Stark.”
“That too.”
Steve turned his attention back to Tony.  “No—we didn’t learn any Italian in Home Ec.  I picked it up later on.”
“So we’re all sorted?” Tony asked.
Ten minutes later, he ambled into the kitchen, mostly clean and mostly awake. (What, who could bother to wash their hair before coffee?  Especially after a post-gala Star Trek binge with the team...)
“Tony?”  Steve murmured.  When Tony turned, Steve leaned down for an eager, open-mouthed kiss.  Mmm.  Tony let himself be swept up for a few moments-- tongues caressing, all wet heat, before he remembered his purpose and pulled away.
“How’re you feeling about the gala?” Tony asked.
“No, no!  I’m fine.  I have all that I--”
Bowed back and supported by Steve’s strong arms, Tony thrilled with every kiss, as time became a blur. Tony shivered with pleasure.
“Nothing!  Well, okay, maybe not nothing.  But it’s not bad.  I’ll tell you about it over lunch sometime.  Anyhow, can’t I just show my appreciation for you?”
“I guess we could watch an episode with the team,” Tony said grudgingly, snuggling closer. “But, I can’t lie, I don’t really want to. I don’t think I want to see anyone. I don’t want to leave your apartment or pick up the phone or go on the internet or even look at email. I just want to stay in this bubble. No work, no training, no aliens, no newspapers--just us.”
“I’m so proud of you,” Pepper was murmuring ever-so-softly, stroking his hair with one hand and holding him close. Tony found the contact comforting, but even more comforting was the knowledge that Pepper
(Ok, fine.  Whatever.)
tomorrow.”
“Well, I was wondering if I could take you on a date Saturday night.  We’d have to get an early dinner.  Or, well, maybe a very late one.”
I'm back at last!  "Did you miss me, Agent Romanoff?"  ;-)
“Well, shucks, I guess we’re both lucky,” Tony said, with mock bashfulness, then added with a rakish smile, “And speaking of getting lucky… Kidding, kidding! I get why we’re not ‘knocking boots’ yet, but I have truly enjoyed everything we’ve done so far.” He let his voice drop a little. “How about you?”
“To the Restoration and Memorial Gala. It’s this weekend. Remember?”
(Oh fuck.)  Tony really hoped his panic didn’t show on his face.  (Shit, shit, shit!)
“Tony?”
“The Norton Dominator you ordered and the various parts. They have arrived.”
“Hey!” Tony squawked.
Tony slid gracefully to his knees, bowed his head, and offered Steve his hands, palms up. He heard Steve gasp, but he didn’t look, just kept his head demurely tilted down to one side. His heart was pounding, but he forced himself to wait.
Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple and held him close.
don’t want to do it, we can talk to them,” Tony said, yanking at a few loose copper wires. “Trust me, they can adapt. They’re used to
Tony hesitated.  “Uh, he needn’t bother.”
and it just sounded—” Steve paused.  “--
“With a thirty pound turkey?” Mrs. Rhodes said incredulously. “I don’t think much of anybody has experience with that. But we can calculate it, I’m sure. Now, Bruce, you were going to make the green beans, right? And a green salad?”
Until the Son of God appear
As the pleasurable memories washed over him, Tony’s cock began to stir. He bit his lip, then turned the water colder.
“Yeah,” Tony said, rubbing his neck.  “I mean, I was doing some work on the Mark VII for a while, but then I was thinking about last night and well . . . ”  Tony trailed off and gave a little shrug.
Rogers never came to the workshop.
“Again!” Rogers cried and rushed him. Tony almost scored a punch on the Captain’s side, but he was too fast for Tony. This time, though, when Cap dodged he didn’t get Tony with his usual tap—he spun out of the way and grabbed Tony’s wrist. That was new, but Tony rolled with it.
Silence.
“Er, unless you’re too busy,” Steve backpedaled.  “I can just bring something down to you if you’re—”
The place wreaked of scotch. And maybe vodka. And gin. Bottles were smashed on the floor, glittering blue in the light of Stark’s holo-screens.
6:35.
“And the Avengers, and
Tony blinked. (Sushi?
“Let go,” Tony said pulling back.  Steve took a deep breath and forced his fingers to relax.  He wanted to pull Tony close again, wanted to protest as Tony stepped away to sit on the bed, looking up at him. Steve stood, flushed and panting in the middle of the room.
Tony reached up to caress Steve’s cheek.
“Huh?”
the clean hoodie, right?)
, so instead he pressed a burning cheek to Steve’s calf.
Thanks for all the cheerleading and to my amazing beta who took a last minute phone call to get this ready.
Tony shook his head. It wasn’t like Steve needed to get naked, just down to his undies. (Unless he went commando. Ha! Howling Commandos!) Come to think of it, though, Tony’d never seen Steve changing in the locker room with him and Clint. Guy must be pretty shy. Tony tapped impatiently at his workbench while he waited for Steve to change.
It was strange: the reporters’ descriptions of Steve—earnest, forthright, humble, sincere, fair-minded, kind, generous —were no less than he deserved, but it left a bitter taste in Tony’s mouth. It was true of course: Steve was earnest and humble and generous and all of it, but they saw all that in Captain America. He was an icon, an emblem—they were never going to see anything else. Somehow it cheapened Steve’s utterly remarkable
.  I can’t--”
Tony stroked his hair as he continued, “But I don’t want to make you uncomfortable or force you to verbalize things you aren’t ready to say out loud yet.”
Tony sighed and scrolled up again, considering and ruling out the idea of reading the guy's email.
Steve waved his hands at the chili.  “But it isn’t even take-out!” Steve protested.
(No. Stop worrying about nothing, stupid.) Tony drained his coffee. (Steve hadn’t said anything disapproving about sex last night, right? Right.)

“Oh!”

“Close your lips once you’ve got a little water and I’ll take the cup away.  Don’t take too much.”
(Shit.)
(Yes!)
“All that stuff-- you’re constantly reminding everybody I’m a sub!”
Someone patted clumsily at Tony’s shoulder. He looked up to find Rhodey smiling awkwardly down at him.
“What about this one?” Bruce asked, sending a floating screen of diagrams over to Tony.
(Fuck.)
“How are you?” Steve asked as though the question were significant rather than a pleasantry.
Bruce sighed. “Why not?”
“Why not?”
He tipped his head to the side and stretched out his neck, giving Tony a little look from under his eyelashes.  Was he wearing eyeliner and mascara and--

Bruce grimaced. “That bad, huh?”
Tony set down the wrench he’d been using to attach the core for a training robot’s arm.
“Okay.”
Steve seemed to hesitate. “I guess so.”
“Okay,” he said. “See you soon.”
Tony seemed to be waiting for a reply, so Steve forced out the totally insufficient words: “I’ll see you then.” Tony just nodded and sauntered to the elevator, coffee maker cradled in his arms.
Captain America had just entered the mess hall, carrying a tray of the same mediocre food and wearing a plain blue SHIELD training uniform. Tom felt as confused as Captain Rogers looked.
"Yes." Her voice was chilly. "Good night, Captain."
“No, no, we’re good,” Tony called, turning as he zipped it up all the way. “What’s up, Cap?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“I care about Stark tech!”
Rogers looked unsure.
Pepper raised one eyebrow. “You see why I was concerned? Anyone who could get past your security protocols would have to be dangerous. It only took two minutes to put on the suit—the added protection seemed wise. At least until my SWAT team arrived.”
working on it.)
Tony smiled up at him. “Yes?” he prompted.
“I’m eager and frantic,” Tony whispered, “but that first time you make it all gentle and deliberate. You press me against the front door and unbutton my shirt little by little, leaning up to kiss me long and hard.”
(Ugh.)
Steve took a deep breath and concentrated.  He tried to relax his throat again, wanting to stay open, to feel Tony inside him.
running). He was half way there when he heard Tony’s voice. He slowed a little, sorry to find that Tony wasn’t alone, then sped up again when he recognized the deep timber of the answering voice. Rhodey! (Shit.) Steve paused again. (Maybe I should leave them to catch up? (No, JARVIS said Tony was ‘expecting me.’) Steve bit his lip and continued. Had Tony told Rhodey they were together? (It’s fine. He knows about Tony and doesn’t care. It’ll be fine. Good, even.) Better hurry up and get it over with. As he got closer, Steve could tell Rhodey sounded . . . angry. A little knot formed, tight and heavy, in Steve’s stomach.
Tony got out of the car first, all his usual swagger on full display. He’d been working the red carpet for so long it hardly required thought. He smiled and waved and posed. Natasha sauntered out next, effortlessly fabulous in Vera Wang. Tony sped up slightly to make sure there wouldn’t be any pictures of them together—he didn’t want anyone to suggest he was her date. (And therefore that
Steve squeezed Tony’s wrists harder against the wall and let his tongue dip into Tony’s eager mouth. Tony’s blood was pounding in his ears, his heart thundering in his chest.
“Couldn’t we talk?”  Rogers asked.
Rogers leapt at Agent Dominick. Tom thought he was about to witness Captain America in action—swift and bloody action. But the Captain froze before laying hands on Dominick. He took a deep breath and hissed, “How
“Saturday morning cartoons are the
“See, the first time we met . . .”
And little by little, he was.
Tony pressed a little kiss to Mrs. Rhodes' cheek on the way past her. “I think it’s time to get some air,” he announced to the room at large, in a casual tone.

before: given someone permission to observe these sorts of courting rituals, agreed to this type of power exchange. Tony Stark—who’d checked just about every box on a master contract at least once, who’d been whipped, and caned, and banged hundreds of times in dozens of countries, who’d been there done that—had found something he’d never done, never wanted to.
“Huh? Oh.  Sorry.  I was staring, huh?”  Steve looked just a little embarrassed, but wholly unapologetic.  “I was just thinking, this is nice.  Really nice.”  Then he clarified, “Being on a date with you.”
Sylvia quirked an eyebrow. “Mr. Stark,” she began, then corrected herself at his look, “
“Wasn’t sure the armor’d fit after all those potatoes,” Rhodey joked, but his voice was tight and nobody laughed.
You are all wonderful and have been so kind and encouraging.  Many thanks to you all!
“I’ll just rock my usual flawless tux, red and gold details. No need for something new.” He rubbed his cheek, leaving grease in his goatee. He’d catch it later. “Maybe new accessories, though. We’ll figure it out later.”
“And since when do you care about being late anyway,” Clint mumbled to Tony around his bagel. Tony just rolled his eyes.
“We’re sharing the gym,” Tony pointed out a little peevishly.
(That non-answer was probably as close as Tony’d get to changing his mind and asking Steve to stay.) Steve bit his lip. (If he was wrong about that, he was pretty sure Tony’d let him know…)
“1956-1975!”
Steve and Tony followed the boy (probably the owners’ son) to a small table, surrounded by floor cushions.  It was in the far corner of the restaurant, near the hearth.  There were a few young hipsters who stood out, but other than that the clientele looked mostly like middle aged Moroccans.  (And, yeah, 42 is NOT middle aged, thank you very much.)

Steve gave her a grateful smile; she just inclined her head slightly in return. They drank their tea without another word for a few minutes; Natasha was patient, but he wasn't quite ready to say more. Natasha slid off the bar stool with preternatural grace.
satisfy his curiosity about . . . )
“Tony?” Steve asked softly.  “How’re you feeling?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“You mean late.”  Tony sauntered into the kitchen.  He went straight for the coffee machine and poured himself a cup.  “I went to the workshop after Rhodey left.  Haven’t made it to bed yet.”
“I feel like you don’t want to be intimate with me. Why not?” Tony asked the ground coffee, then shook his head and tried again. “Is everything okay?”
Steve gave Tony a quick kiss and hopped out of bed.
(Tony felt a sharp surge of relief at every inch Steve put between himself and the ledge.)
Tony grinned and gestured at the staring agents. “By then, their necks will all be sore.”
, Tony,” Bruce said hesitantly, still looking at the blueprints.  “I don’t want you to think I’m ungrateful.  Or that this isn’t amazing.  It is and I’m especially excited for the zen garden and meditation room on my floor, but--”
Steve opened and closed his mouth, struggling with words for a few seconds.  Then he gave Tony shy smile, but moved without hesitation.
“Save it all, J! Time to go pump some iron.”
Tony grinned.  He liked sparing with Clint.
“I’m fine. In fact, I’m great!”
“Yeah,”  Rhodey nodded.  He finished off his beer.  “So,” he hesitated a second, then asked, “do you think he’ll come out?  Eventually?”
“Very well, Captain,” Fury said, rising to his feet.  Dominick looked at him, momentarily flummoxed and outraged, before schooling his features blank.
Bruce let out a choked laugh and wrapped his arms around Tony, squeezing tight.
“Uh, how was your appointment?”
Bruce nodded eagerly and started over, then doubled back to refill his coffee cup.  While his back was turned, he said, “And, Tony?  Thanks.”
“Sorry?” Rogers said, but sat down all the same.
A frown flickered across Rogers’ face before he smiled again and said, “Well, if they’re all like you, I have nothing to worry about.”
Tony shrugged the thoughts away and pulled on a long-sleeve t-shirt. (The AC/DC one that was a little too big and had extra long sleeves.)
“That’s fine, Tony,” Steve said with a little smile. “Don’t rush. That’ll give me time to make some arrangements.”
“You are the last person I want to come to right now. With this,” Ms. Potts said, her face drawn tight. “But you’re the only one here and I’m not strong enough to lift him.”
“Huh? Oh!” Tony cried. “Right! Yeah, uh, bathroom’s over there. Just go ahead and, yeah—“
“I’m gonna learn all that there is,” Steve whispered. He kissed Tony’s forehead.
“Really, you should talk to Dom!” Jerry was saying. “It’s just now noon—he’ll be getting out of the B Gym! You could go talk to him about it!”
Oh damn, that felt good. Tony rubbed his cheek against Steve’s thigh and resisted the temptation to try and suck on the man’s fingers. (Mmmm….)
“Sorry—Tony?”
Steve’s expression clouded.  Tony was almost sorry he’d asked, but well, he really did want to know…
“Coffee?” Tony said, offering Steve his chipped and cherished “I heart NYC” mug.
“There’s a bet,” Cap said.  He was biting the words out, but at least he’d stopped yelling.  “A bunch of the Doms at SHIELD.  They have a bet.”
“Nope,” Tony said, waving a hand at her. She raised an eyebrow at his jeans, plain grey hoodie, and baseball cap. “Go change.”
“Delicious!” Tony cried.  “Seriously amazing!”
“Final sweep. Do we have everything?” Steve asked the team as he strode onto the quinjet.
"Either fuck me or get out," he said bitterly
. Luckily, he was also pretty sure Steve wasn’t expecting an answer.
(Pepper never cried.)
Tony licked his lips and tried to form the words, to warn Steve who was moving faster and faster—
“Christ, Tony,” Steve mumbled against his chest. “I don’t deserve you.”  He swallowed loudly.  “And, of course, I’ll read whatever you think I should.  Just tell me and I’ll do it.”
“Agreed.”
"You really want to serve your country, huh?"
“Back, side, together; front, side, together,” Steve repeated.
Tony shrugged and flipped the kettle for hot water.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony downed some more coffee.
Bruce didn’t tell the others what else Tony’d gotten him, and Tony was just as glad. He wouldn’t even have told Bruce, except that after the quake Bruce had been so worried about the village where he’d lived in Nepal; Tony wanted him to know they were okay—well, as okay as money could make them—and everything was being rebuilt in his villiage.
“Oh, and hey, I need your movers’ i.d.’s for security.”
“Aw, shucks,” Tony said in mock embarrassment, then impatiently, “Well, go on! Try it on!”

“Yeah? What do you need?” Tony asked, rolling over on the floor so he could get eyes on Rogers who was—huh.  Who was standing in the hallway holding a tray.
“Physical therapy,” Cap said with a serious look.
And was it Tony’s imagination or could he hear hints of “I still feel useless here in the 21
“Was there something wrong with it?” Rogers asked again.
Added July 5th:  There was some concern earlier that the story is now over.  Don't worry!  The story is definitely NOT over--far from it!  They have to date.  And figure things out.  And I promised you kinky sex, remember?  And there's more Avengers plot.  So, yeah, far from over.  Unless, you know, y'all have lost interest...  (Okay, I said that like a joke, but I've kinda worried that everybody would be 'over it' once they kiss.  So yeah.)  But THERE'S LOTS MORE!!!!
“Come back?  No!  Stay, stay.  Mi casa, etc.  What brings you down here?  Lemme guess-- science?”
him?  Steve felt a little rush just thinking the word.  Steve had asked a few more times when they were fooling around, begged for it in the most romantic and erotic terms he could think of, but Tony kept shushing him and promising, “soon.”  Maybe he was waiting for Steve to read those books before going any farther?  Steve nodded to himself and sped up again, turning towards the Tower instinctively.

Tony’s partner—some start up hot shot (or wanna be) from Silicon Valley—was droning on and on. Tony glanced over his partner’s shoulder to see Steve shaking his head again and giving an apologetic smile to a lovely young sub in an indigo tuxedo. Their eyes met for a moment, but Steve quickly looked away again.
“Of course he was,” Rhodey said with a laugh.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Mmmm-hmmm.” Rhodey sounded unconvinced. “So. You’re in California.”
“You didn’t do that to me, Steve.”  Tony blinked.  “You didn’t do that.  Okay?”
“Bullet points it is then,” Tony said with a smirk.
have overstated the atheist anti-Christmas thing to Rhodey. Just a bit. But Christmas with the Rhodes is so full of strangers! And this big thing! With all these traditions and lots of Church and stuff. So, uh,
Tony smiled as Bruce blushed and stammered, trying to dodge both praise and gratitude.
Tony swallowed and glanced at Steve’s feet—hesitating only a moment—before taking a seat on the couch and cuddling up to Steve’s side.
“Yeah,” Tony gasped. “So good, Steve. Fuck!”
“You’re so beautiful, so good for me.  Look at you.  Do you have any idea what you do to me?”
Steve chuckled. “Coffee. Of course. Coming right up.”
“Hey, Bruce? Take a look at Projection 23. I’m gonna make us more coffee.”
“Shut it off, JARVIS.”
“Thank you again for a wonderful evening,” Steve said.
“Gotcha,” Tony said. Steve’s cheeks were pink with cold and there were snowflakes on his eyelashes.
“Uh, thanks.”
Steve seemed to come back to himself. He turned to Tony and pulled his knees up onto the couch.
Clint’s face must have given something away because Steve growled—rage stamped on his face—“What the hell is the matter with you?  Don’t you think he’s been through enough without people—who’re supposed to be his friends—piling it on too? I had no idea where that crap was coming from, but trust me, whatever you said, he read between the lines and heard you loud and clear.  How could you?”
“Yeah,” Steve said with a shy smile, “if you’d like.” He licked his lips. “That sounds swell.”
“No. See this? We’re not doing
“Chocolate cake?” she said. “Not since I’ve worked here, I’m afraid.”
“Tony!”
Rhodey had a crutch wedged under his left armpit; his right knee was wrapped in a brace, his right ankle in a cast, while his right arm hung heavily in a sling.
When he caught sight of Tony, Rogers smiled warmly; then his brow creased, the smile dimmed, and he opened and shut his mouth a few times. He glanced down at the pancakes and bacon and then back.
,” Tony corrected, trying to slow his racing thoughts enough to explain to Pepper.
“Yeah,” Steve said.  “That’s right.”
“A kiss like that?” Steve asked as he straightened once more. There was something boyish and playful dancing in his eyes and lingering in his voice. Tony was delighted.
Tony fell, landing heavily on his hip. Steve spun back around, wide-eyed.
Tony tensed, arched, and came shooting pulse after pulse of hot cum into Steve’s wet mouth.  (Oh, oh!  He’s swallowing, he’s--!)  Something hot spattered against Tony’s thigh and it was hard to breathe and everything was white and blinding with pleasure.
Tony opened and closed his mouth, trying to decide if Bruce would judge him for fibbing to Steve when--
Steve leaned back and looked up at him a little bemused, but unconcerned.  He shrugged.  “It wasn’t on the list,” Steve said, cocking his head.  At Tony’s look of confusion, he clarified, “When you gave me the spreadsheet, I put the words I didn’t know into wikipedia.”
“Good morning,” Bruce said a little hesitantly, waving to everybody.
“Hey, Katie?” Tony interrupted, suddenly distracted once more. She nodded again, impatiently. “I, uh—“ Tony hesitated, “on the casualty list, there was a Jennifer Winters. She wasn’t, uh--?”
Tony nuzzled Steve’s neck.
“As you wish,” Tony said, and couldn’t resist adding, though it probably wasn’t wise or polite, “O Mighty Dragon-slayer King.”
Steve was clutching at his ‘cup of Joe’ like a dragon with its hoard. (Or, like Tony with a cup of coffee.)
Steve shrugged.  “Sure.  We’ll figure something out if we need to.”
With a defiant flick of the wrist, Tony undid the top two buttons of his shirt again and arranged the lapels, leaving his throat exposed. He returned to the table with a swagger and a swish in his step.
“-- I’m
“Of course.”  Steve looked into Tony’s eyes as he pinned it in place.  Tony nearly shivered. It felt

hospitals.)
It was terribly cold.
It had been a good day. Cap loved the suit and it only needed a few minor tweaks to fit perfectly. (SHIELD’s measurements had been flawed, obviously.) Steve and Tony had devoured burgers and watched
: I’m in the green room now, texting like you asked.
“Twitter is bullshit,” Clint said. “Anyway, I’m flying.”
“Steve, a man always remembers good chicken parmesan!”
Tony frowned and looked at the spectrometer’s readings on his HUD. It had only been fifteen minutes, so it wasn’t giving him anything new yet. He looked back up at Bob, shimmering blue-grey, almost undulating.
24 hours later Tony was about ready to bang his head against the wall in frustration.  And Bruce’s calm was really starting to get on his nerves.  If only they’d gotten more data!  Working with incomplete information was bullshit.
I just hope that when the break-up comes--and it will, mark my words--it doesn’t rip the Avengers in two.
“Oh well! The iPhone! That’s terrible,” Steve said with a grimace. “If a Stark product can’t even match the nadir of engineering fiascos . . .”
Tony turned back to his schematics.
—but lots of subs were more comfortable in their own space, so maybe Steve was trying to reassure him? (Not that Tony cared one way or the other, but it was the thought that counted . . .)
The touch of thick, luxuriously soft rope made him smile as Steve laid the bight out on his right wrist. Tony was sure that if he looked up, Steve would be making that adorable face of furious concentration, but instead Tony closed his eyes and relaxed into it.
“Yes! I mean, no,” Tony said distractedly. “I mean, yes, Mikie and Katie.”
“Steve? You ready?”
Pepper glared at him. “I sat by your bedside for
Steve was in the shared kitchen eating breakfast, just a couple of slices of toast and a plain cup of coffee.  Something light and easy.  He’d had a glass of orange juice earlier.  Even after six months in the twenty-first century, daily orange juice still felt like an amazing luxury.
called. The junk press (TMZ, the Star, People Magazine, US Weekly, Fox News…)wrote (or implied) hideous trash about him all the time—“tops from the bottom”; “cheating slut”; “liberatioNazi”; “gets fucked by robots,” etc. Pep and Rhodey didn’t usually call him about that though, did they?
Tony heard footsteps in the hallway.
By 3 pm they’d made some good progress on the hypotheticals, so Bruce left to practice yoga, earnestly inviting Tony to join him. (“Good for mind
“Morning!” Clint said. He gave a jaw-cracking yawn and took a seat. “Tony, man, you know I love your creations, but not when they come from a kitchen—so I’ll have whatever Steve cooked.”
“But to be honest, fighting aliens was probably the easiest part,” the Captain says. Scattered audience laughter; he looks at them. “I mean that seriously. Which I realize is strange. But waking up in the future--not understanding how to do things, even things children now take for granted, and constantly putting my foot in my mouth was hard to deal with. At least fighting to defend my country and civilians was familiar. And fighting was much easier to do when the enemy wasn’t human. Dictators and war-mongers have dehumanized their opponents for centuries, but, well, the arachnids actually weren’t human.”
“I miss you,” Tony blurted. Pepper smiled.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
then I’m only going to dinner long enough to throw a drink in your face.”
before giving advice.  Bruce poured Steve’s cup of tea first—he knew Steve didn’t like his as strong.
“You too, Pep.”
“The Avengers Initiative was designed to protect America.  And the world. Iron Man will do that. Everything else is secondary.”
Steve rushed to put the flowers in a pitcher, grabbed his coat, and hurried back to join Tony in the elevator. Tony found Steve’s haste ridiculously endearing; he rather liked seeing Steve sweetly flustered for him.
“I was joking, Tony.”
“Pretty sure they had sex back in the 40’s,” Jackie said with a wry smile, lathering Tony’s hair. “And the whole old school ‘don’t kiss and tell’ thing would hardly have a gentleman boasting about his conquests. So, for all you know, he’s Captain Keeps His Banging Quiet. Just because
“Or,” Pep said hesitantly, “we could just sit here for a bit?  I know you said that the team didn’t mind my sudden visit, but maybe—“
Steve followed him into the kitchen, looking something at a loss.
“Yeah.  May I?”  he said, gesturing to the newly arrived workshop coffee maker.
“You’re beautiful,” Tony whispered.
When Tony resurfaced eleven hours later, he found Bruce and Rogers in the common room watching a documentary on Duke Ellison and early FreeDomism. Rogers was leaning forward, his elbows on his knees, chin on his palms—a vision of rapt attention. Tony hovered a moment, then went to the kitchen for a glass of wine.
“And the Rolls it is!”
(Fuck.) Tony took a deep breath. (Fuck, oh, fuck fuck fuck.)
For the first thirty minutes, Pepper hovered nearby—until Tony glared at her enough she took the hint. Natasha always seemed to talking to somebody near him too, but that always looked like a coincidence. (But it would, wouldn’t it? She was a spy after all . . .)
“My calculations confirm your own, sir.”
Bruce was nodding and giving Steve that gentle little smile-- the one that he sometimes worried meant that Bruce was humoring him.
“Jesus, Tony,” he said into Tony’s messy hair, his voice wrecked.  “I really thought I was going to watch you die right in front of me.”

“I was hoping we could catch up,” she said, still holding his hand. “It’s been a while.”
After a few (blessedly few) minutes, Steve looked around the table.  “Is there anything else you’d like to add?”

“Tony . . .”
“May I see you to your door?” Steve asked softly as they entered into the elevator.
Tony waved to the bots as he crossed the threshold and called out, “JARVIS, give me
Steve checked his phone and shook his head.  "Clint and Natasha have finished their survey of the perimeter in New Jersey.  Nothing.  They're back at SHIELD now."
“Clint,” Natasha said softly, pointing up, “Don’t jinx us.”
“I’m fine,” she said with a shrug. “You?”
Then, more deliberately, Steve eased Tony back up and held him against his chest, breathing deeply. He let the ropes fall. Half-dizzy with lust, Tony felt a vague flicker of concern.  (What was--?)  Steve took another deep breath, kissed Tony’s forehead, and said, “Can you stand up now for me, sweetheart?”
Rogers blinked.  “Isn’t that what I said?”
Tony blinked and took a deep breath.
(Oh shit!)
“That’s ridiculous,” Tony said, waving his arms.  “You’re being ridiculous. Totally ridiculous!”
Long deep breaths.
“That’s the only line of Walt Whitman you know, isn’t it?” Steve asked, examining Tony’s shirts. Then he added as an afterthought.  “And, you know the Captain in that poem is President Lincoln and he’s just been assassinated, right?”
Tony started to pace; Dummy followed, offering him his bow tie. After a few laps up and down the workshop, Tony knelt next to the bot and accepted it.
Tony lost himself in the sensations.
“Steve, I’m going to do what I want with you.  Do you understand?”
Tony swallowed.
(And he wasn’t disappointed Steve still refused to train him.)
Pepper gave him a warm smile. “I’m glad.”
“Oh. Right. Bye, Tony.”
“I’m not lying,” Rogers insisted with a frown.  He drew his shoulders back and his chin up. “I
(Safeword?)
Tony smiled, then frowned. (Shit. Steve. Steve was there.) Tony took stock of himself. At some point he’d ditched his button-down shirt, leaving only a threadbare tank top. He felt this was a problem somehow. A Steve problem, but he couldn’t remember why.
“Yes, of course!” Tony said.  “There’s no rush.  Why don’t I make you a nice cup of tea?”
“Give me the refortified tensile readings, J . . . hm, ok. I’ll need to adjust the calculations to include the SAPI plate . . .” Tony muttered.
Tony nodded.  “Yeah, J.  Put her through.  Video.”
JARVIS’ silence was eloquent.
-ness.
He was so close Steve could feel Tony’s breath against his cheek.
“PEOPLE!”  Fury roared.
“Like this?” Tony breathed.  He slid his slick fingers down a little, caressing lightly between Steve’s cheeks, rubbing gently at his hole.  Steve jerked involuntarily at the touch and let out a little gasp, then nodded again.  His hips jerked again.
Steve rested his cheek on the top of Tony’s head with a little sigh and squeezed Tony’s knee.  Tony ran his fingers up and down Steve’s thigh, squirming closer, but when Steve’s muscles went tense Tony stopped.  (Shit.)
“What!? No!” Tony cried. “You’re kidding me with this shit, right? How often are the three of us actually together?”
“I didn’t think you liked hard liquor,” Tony said.
Oh shit! He’d screwed this up. What if it made Tony uncomfortable and he—
“You sure? 'cause you look seriously ready to rip somebody's limbs off. I mean, more so than usual when you're going at that thing.”
“So,” Tony said after a long moment, “you’re saying I should wear steel-toed boots in ballrooms as well as the workshop.”
Warnings for people being jerks on the internet, misogyny / orientationism.
Tony lurched forward.  “That's impossible,” he said.
It was fine.  Everything was fine.
“Right.  You know we had plans for those floors.”
“I don’t believe I’m at liberty to say, sir.” JARVIS paused—it was the closest he came to hesitation. “I fear the Captain would be embarrassed.”
“Pretty intense training schedule we’ve got coming up,” Natasha said. “How were the meetings at SHIELD yesterday, Steve?”
“What!? No!” Tony dropped his wrench. “The new collection’s terri—oh. Haha.”
Italian food an Irish boy can make!”
Tony hastily pulled his shirt down as Rogers averted his eyes. (Shit!)
Fury paused and Bruce was silent.  Tony could see him considering it and that hurt. It really hurt.  Fine, so Bruce wasn’t going to be his Dom, but they’d had plans for inventions, projects, experiments and he’d been so happy to think of them sharing his beautiful (big, empty) Tower.  It was almost better that Bruce wouldn’t want to dominate him—he could live with Bruce as an equal at all times without any power exchange to negotiate, just the friendship of like minds.
“Tony, we were all letting off steam. It was a party.” Pepper’s eyes flicked to the kitchen, and she added: “If anybody would judge you for it, they have poor judgment. And that’s not on you.”
“All right,” Tony said. He felt a vague sense of disappointment as Steve left-- he’d been looking forward to the test run (first trial was always one of the best parts of inventing!)—but it was overshadowed by his concern for Rhodey.
, stupid. If he--) Tony took a shuddering breath (You can fly; you’ll catch him if--)
“Bullshit,” Clint cut in.  “You can multi-task.  And you’re not a fucking amateur--you could have reported it without showing your hand.  I’m sure you could.”
he felt at the idea of being watched. The hair at the back of his neck stood up.
“That’s the idea,” Steve whispered back, breath warm against Tony’s neck.
“Good,” Tony answered, with a smile. He kissed Steve’s knuckles.
“Hey, Bruce?”
But Steve didn't,
“Hey, man?” Tony said hesitantly, scooting closer so they were touching. “We’re gonna skip the part with Shelob, right?”
So. Underwear. Nothing too filthy. But nothing too dull either. After a moment he slipped into well-fitted black silk boxer briefs (no lace trim, no nonsense) that showed him to advantage. Tony grinned and gave a little shimmy. His dick was certainly nothing to be ashamed of! Rather larger than one might expect from his build. This tended to please Dommes, but annoyed Doms if they felt outclassed. (Seriously, Tops constantly said that
“Yeah, you know, like a ray gun, but with damage settings.”
The Captain drew his shoulders back a little and raised his chin ever so slightly.  He took a step forward and held out his hand.
?” Tony asked.
He turned away.  He needed to get back to his workshop.
Tony was a little afraid that the often-heard “I’d better let you get some rest now” would be next, but instead Steve sank a little deeper on the couch and kept stroking his hip. So maybe now was the time?
Steve herded Tony easily from the elevator and down the hall to his bedroom. Tony shuffled along heavily, half-clinging to Steve's side, making no protest at his lover's firm grip around his waist. Steve wondered if Tony might fall without him.
Tony nodded, feeling at a loss for words.
“Aren’t we gonna wait for Tony?” Clint asked, glancing at the door.
Tony mumbled to Steve with a wry smile, “Good thing we took the edge off earlier.”
“Believe what you like,” she answered smoothly. “It is the truth.”
Tony blinked.  (What I said earlier?)
“Tones? What’s going on?” Rhodey cut in. Tony’s heart clenched. It felt like there wasn’t enough air in the suit. “Tony? I’m almost there with back up.”
(Here goes nothing.)
And Tony wasn’t even tempted to give Steve any incredulous snark, just answered, “No, Steve.  You didn’t hurt me.”
“Good,” Steve said decisively.
“That sucks,” Rhodey said, patting her hand awkwardly.
“What? No. I don’t do Christmas.” Tony swallowed. “And, yeah. You should invite him. I don’t think it would be good for Steve to be alone.”
for Tony.   But he did it anyway.  For Steve.
“Well, I should take these down to him.  Hopefully, he hasn’t gotten too filthy in the past ten minutes down there—it’s impossible to push that man into a shower!”  (No!  No, no.  Don’t!)  She rolled her eyes.  “He’d go to meetings covered in ink and grease if I’d let him!” Her tone was fond.  Something unpleasant was twisting in Steve’s gut.
Tony nodded pensively and said, “So, the hostile and deliberate portals opened by the arachnoids created a disturbance that is now creating a ripple effect and weirding in the interdimensional or interplanetary environment. Which would explain why the arachnoids had been poised to attack but the Eewoo seemed confused and frightened.”
Natasha arrived next, with the faintest hint of a smile on her lips.
Tony blinked.  (That was fast.)  He checked the time, then shook his head; he didn’t even have to decide whether to make up an excuse or not.
Steve was a Christmas kind of guy. He was Catholic. He’d been going to mass and lighting the advent wreath for the past, what? Three weeks? Shit--)
“Are you blushing for me, sweetheart?” Steve asked, something amazed in his voice.
“Fine. Great. Good,” Tony muttered, then shook his head. “Order Park Chop Suey—all Steve’s favorites—and ask him to join me for dinner in the penthouse when he gets back, okay, J?”
Tony gnawed on his lip.
The man smiled; a reserved kind of smile, but warm nevertheless. “You know, I believe you’re right. Thank you, Mr. Stark.”
Tony let out an indignant noise.
Steve continued his reading.
Tony threw back his head and laughed.
“Boring,” Bruce said, with a grimace.
, but something about the wistfulness in his tone, the restrained and private answer, that made Tony wonder “from
Steve tipped their foreheads together and murmured with a smile, “Back at'cha, sweetheart.”
It stretched out long and melancholy between them.
(Beautiful.)
. It’d ruin my image.”
Rogers sat near Tony whenever he could, but never intruded on Tony’s personal space.  If anything, he kept a respectful and formal distance, unlike Clint or Bruce who’d give Tony a friendly bump or brush past him casually.  Rogers ate a lot and seemed to live in the communal kitchen when he wasn’t in the gym.  He read paper newspapers, did the crossword in pen, and hummed to himself when he cooked. He had a self-deprecating sense of humor that would catch Tony off guard sometimes, and he didn’t seem to mind Tony’s occasional teasing about his outdated slang:
“Sure,” Steve said, looking a little puzzled as he followed Tony.
So, I really hope you liked that!  Steve’s speech about Mary Jacobs was one of the foundational snippets I jotted down over a year ago when I was first thinking about this AU and conceiving of his backstory.  Needless to say, I’ve been eager to share it with you!  And I promise more revelations and good stuff to come!  (Yes, even le kinky sex. Eventually….)  Also, this story was originally going to be short—all done in 25 chapters.  Ha ha ha.  So, I’m guessing it will now be more like 50 something.  You’ve been warned!  :-)

Tony blinked and started to settle down next to him.
They were silent for a few moments, the only sound the beeping of medical equipment and the buzz of the florescent lights in the hallway.
“Anyway, Father Gabe also worked with the kids at Magdalene House and Bucky’d just arrived and was giving them hell. He had his father’s temper and some of his fight training and was pretty mad at the world, ya know? He’d had free run before, since his dad was never around much, and now there were all these rules and other kids, and he was angry and a real big guy for his age and—well.” Steve grimaced. “He wasn’t adjusting well.”

I know some authors solicit both positive and negative feedback, but I’m going through a rough time—particularly related to gender things which this story explores-- so in this mental state, I’d like know that this is reliably a safe space.  Thank you. I really don’t mean for this request to shut down musings, conversations, curiosity, or anything else.  I love that!  It makes my day!  Also, I mean, this IS an AU and fiction-- I'm not claiming to represent reality.  :-)  Okay, sorry for the long (possibly pathetic and nervous sounding) author’s note!
“Right. I’ll do that. And, uh, you should let me know what you might like me to draw.”
“Well, I couldn’t possibly eat any popcorn,” Pepper announced, “But I am interested in a cocktail. You’re a good bartender, Clint. What shall we make?”
Steve’s hands stroked up Tony’s back, then down over his ass as he carefully lowered Tony’s trousers and silk boxers.  Tony was half-ashamed to realize he wasn’t fully hard, which couldn’t exactly escape Steve’s attention from that angle. (He couldn’t help it—he was nervous damnit and they hadn’t fooled around much yet. He was thirty-eight for Christ’s sake!  He didn’t quite spring up for it like he did in his twenties anymore . . .)  Steve ran his thumbs across Tony’s hipbones.
It looked nice. Crisp, controlled, orderly on the page. Steve drew a boarder around the words with firm pen strokes. Then wondered if it would be silly to sketch a few downy feathers, fluttering on the page, falling from the letters and--

He needed to get back to his projects.
JARVIS complied silently. Tony shook his head. His hands felt clammy. (Duh. He was covered in sweat from training with Clint.) He took a deep breath.
Tony! People are supposed to look at it!” He shook his head and took a deep breath.
“Glad you like it,” Tony said.  “So, anyway—kitchen’s right there, nice open floor plan.”  Tony felt like he should have more to say, but all he could think of was to point out the obvious as they walked around.
“You’re so fucking beautiful, I think I could stare at you like this for hours.”
“—chicken parmesan?  Yeah.”  Steve smiled and shook his head. “I was so nervous, I almost dropped the first one on the floor, then broke a dish when I was trying to save it.  Did they tell you about the times I got beat up in the alley out back?  Luca always came running with a broom. That was kind of a recurring theme for me back then,” Steve said with a wry grimace.
Steve had brought him coffee.  Tony made grabby hands and Steve presented it with a smile.

“Maybe you could talk to Rhodey?” Tony suggested. “He . . . he helped me . . .

“No, no, really,” Clint called. “Just have fun back there, snacking and playing and hanging out. I’ll just fly us there. No worries.”

Tony put on the Cap Jazz Mix in the car and they rode in silence.  Back at the Tower, Tony parked the car.  As soon as the engine went dead and the music silent, they spoke in unison.
Well, that turned out to be fucking awkward.  And things had been going so well with Pepper lately!  Not like

“Oh, no. No way!” Tony protested, slapping at Steve’s arm with jerky, uncoordinated motions. “Don’t pretend I wasn’t gunning for you—I was.”
“No trouble at all,” Steve said.  “I’m glad Tony will be back soon,” he added, smile breaking out unbidden.  “If there’s anything you think we can do for him . . .”
“Fall back!” Steve called, ducking behind his hastily erected snow fortification.
More Steve in the next chapter! Hope you like it and thanks for your patience and good wishes!

Veronica was always a trendsetter: after her dance with Tony, he never went more than a few minutes without a dance partner or the offer of one. He generally said yes, since he actually liked dancing and had always been good at it. (After all, Howard and mom had started his ballroom lessons at age eight so he’d be a refined Dominant.)

Tony made his way to the facilities and barely managed to keep his phone in his pocket until he got there. Just for good measure, he went into a stall and closed the door. He whipped out his Stark Phone and searched: “yellow roses flower language.”
Tony frowned, then turned to Clint.  (That’s fine.  Whatever.)
(Well fuck.  So not thinking about this shit now.)
“I wish people’d stop asking me that,” Tony grumbled, then relented. “Fine. I’m fine. Better now that I’ve seen some of the PR you’ve been doing.” Tony let out a low whistle.
“It has been a real pleasure watching you work. I admit that I don’t really understand the spectrometer— or well, more accurately, I
“Oh. Uh, tonight I can’t,” Tony said fumblingly. “There’s a thing.”
Tony propped up suddenly to watch Steve who had just *moaned* while *sucking his cock.*  (Oh fuck!)  Steve’s eyes were closed and his hand kept twitching where it rested on Tony’s hip.
“No romantic comedies,” Natasha said with a scowl, then smiled slightly, “but yes—good plan.”
(Oh!)
An attractive man with lovely brown eyes and a neatly trimmed beard answered the door, wearing the white dress shirt and black slacks of a server’s uniform.
“Stop,” Bruce said softly.  “Please stop, Tony.  I—“ He gave Tony an agonized look.  “I can’t bear to disappoint you.”

“When’s the last time they offered a good suggestion?” Steve retorted.
Tony wished he’d brought out a glass of scotch or something.
“How about food?” Steve asked, as he poured the coffee and laid a hand lightly on Tony’s back. “Maybe some pancakes? You mentioned liking them with blueberries . . .”
“Please?” Steve whispered.  “Tony, please?”
“Funds for travel expenses to Manhattan and a good meal on the way,” she said briskly. “One pm tomorrow at the enclosed address if you’d like to meet him and continue the interview process. If not, then I wish you well, Mr. Rogers.”

a good transition to: “And a good thing.  We’d really be missing Iron Man if there were an attack.”
“Oh?” Steve asked, with a little smile. “Well, uh, I’m off to bed.”
“You’re so hard working,” Tony rambled, “Bet you’ll want to practice all the time, won’t you babe?  I’ll have to get you a dildo so you can keep working on it after I come.  I’d never be able to keep up with your . . . ah! . . . enthusiasm and dedication.  Oh fuck!”
But before they started sitting together in Chem or spoken or learned each other’s names, Rhodey’d found him passed out drunk at a freshman party. He’d rolled Tony over so he wouldn’t die choking on his own vomit and started to leave, but then Rhodey’d remembered a story his older cousin had told him, about a sub who’d passed out at a frat party at Yale . . . Rhodey’d carried Tony back to his own room instead of leaving him there and they met for the first time the next morning when Tony woke up in a strange bed with a pounding headache, took one look at Rhodey and blurted, “Oh, God, please tell me we fucked!”
Rhodes' eyes darted to Tony for a moment as he answered, voice perfectly even, “Afghanistan.”
“Go ahead, Tony,” Steve said. “I’ll go test out the suit while you talk to Jim. Tell him I said ‘hi.’”
Steve’s Dominant’s notch* rose and fell as he swallowed thickly.
Steve took another sip of tea and grabbed a biscuit.  He continued reading:
He checked Twitter.
“Mmm.” Tony hummed. “I guess so. I’d be happy to hang out here more if you like.”
(Probably. Sounds like something Gina would remember.)
“Our press conference preparation,” Steve prompted.
wouldn’t be weirded out by Tony’s relationship with technology.  Tons of Doms seemed to be total luddites or wanted him to be, which made no sense.  Or, okay, maybe it did—gross Doms always want him helpless,
“You look great,” Steve said, with a smile.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Dominick pulled up his PowerPoint slide:
“Tsk tsk, Agent Romanov. I’m very disappointed in you,” Tony said, “No means no.”
Tony gasped. He felt unexpectedly lightheaded; all the blood seemed to be rushing from his brain to his cock.
“Home Ec?” Tony repeated incredulously.  “
Tony blinked.  “Sure.  I mean, why not?  It was great and it’s kinda your favorite, right?  Maybe this time I can convince you to try something other than pepperoni.”
Tony reached for his coffee with fumbling hands; it crashed to the floor and the mug shattered. He jumped at the loud noise, heart racing. Dummy beeped sadly and swiveled around his stool, wheels crunching over the broken pottery.
Rogers shrugged and shook his head. “Ten thousand a head, though.” Rogers let out a low whistle. “Hard to imagine. I mean, sure, donating the money, but the big party just seems kind of . . . well . . .”
(What about nanotransistors?  No, that’s not it either.  . . huh.  What about--)
“JARVIS?” Steve said to the ceiling. “Could you please tell the team that Tony and I are cooking breakfast for them and ask them to please join us?”
“I’m honored, Captain,” the old man said, shaking Steve’s hand. “It’s good to see Mr. Stark out with a respectable Dominant at last.”
“Well that’s a relief!”
“Tony?”
Tony choked down a laugh, swallowed crooked, and choked for real.
but seriously, could anyone tell those guys in
Tony stood abruptly.
“Well,” Steve said, a little hesitantly, “we’ve got several options, but I was thinking, since you seemed to like the food, maybe you wouldn’t mind going back to Cucina Paradiso again?”
Steve held him tight and stroked his back.
“Thank
Little by little the ropes were unwound.  Once Steve’s wrists were free Tony shifted back around and lifted them, right then left, to examine them.  Whatever he saw must have satisfied him, because he nodded to himself and then caressed them lightly with his fingers.
Tony gave him a wicked grin, then leaned forward to kiss him, pressing his lips to Steve’s forehead, his cheek, his lips, his jaw.  Tony was thrusting his finger into Steve in a slow steady rhythm that made him keen for more.  In and out, in and out.  Steve clenched the bedsheets in fists.
“Yeah.” Tony laid a hand on his arm and smiled up at him. “Thanks for the assist, Cap.”
!” Tony yelled, leaping up off the couch. “What the fuck? Sulu managed to do his job and even save the day sometimes in TOS without bending over for anybody, be it officer, crew, or alien.”
Steve nodded.
(Steve’ll be fine. Dr. Jefferson will know how to help him.)
“I am sorry to wake you, Sir, but my Self-Harm Protocol has been triggered.” JARVIS’s tone was apologetic. “As you are not the trigger, I have no directives on whom to contact.”
Later.  There’d be plenty of time.
“I know,” Tony said gently.  “You’ve said that before, sweetheart, or don’t you remember?”  Tony ran his thumb across Steve’s cheek.  “I know I don’t have to.  I want to.”
Steve grimaced and rubbed the back of his neck. “That obvious, huh?”
“Honestly, we’re fine,” Tony insisted firmly. “He’s been great, Rhodey. Really.”
Tony let out an amused little huff of air and settled against the bed again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bruce’s smile was a little too knowing.
Tony squinted at Clint, feeling a little lost. He hadn’t taken Clint’s surprise poorly, had he? There’d been nothing to offend him. Though now that Clint was apologizing . . .
“Tony? What’s your safeword?”
Harris laughed loudly.  Tony raised an eyebrow and looked up at him consideringly.  (It wasn’t that funny was it?)
The next day when he came up, Steve found Tony and Bruce drinking coffee in the kitchen both scribbling frantically on a large piece of graph paper.  They gave Steve a distracted “good morning” and “help yourself to coffee,” then went back to speaking science like it was a foreign language.  Steve poured himself a cup of coffee he didn’t really want to drink and sipped it awkwardly for a few minutes while they talked.  They seemed to forget he was there and he hated to intrude; what they were talking about seemed very important and perfectly incomprehensible.  Steve finished the bitter tasting coffee, washed and dried his mug, then put it away in the cabinet.  Steve went for a run.
; whatever she’s worked up for us is gonna kick Carmichael’s ass.”
“No problem, Steve,” Rhodes said gently. “I get it. Some other time.” Rhodes hesitated. “If you change your mind, though, and want company, we’ve got a beer with your name on it.”
designed that, not the morons at SHIELD. How’s the mobility?”
“Okay,” Steve said pensively.  He drank some more of his beer and nibbled a few more bites of his (totally boring pepperoni) pizza.
“Apologies,” Steve said with a smile. “How about we
“I’d be very pleased to help you,” Steve told him seriously, with the air of a promise. “But I don’t really know anything about—“ He waved a hand vaguely at Tony’s schematics.

“Cross my heart, promise-promise,” Tony said with a grin. “I’ll have JARVIS call you.”
(And, yep, there wasn’t a doubt in his mind that Katie and Mikie had sent Danny to Ray’s themselves, but he couldn’t even be annoyed. Danny’d been so discreet about it that the team hadn’t even noticed him and the photos really were great press.)
It was rapidly becoming clear that Steve needed a new strategy, but he had no idea what to do.
were size queens, but who got all in a huff about comparing dicks anyway?) Well. He doubted Steve would have any issues in that regard. (Mmmm…)
“Are you sure?” Tony asked. “Come on, Steve. We can watch Trouble with Tribbles again. Just to help us get sleepy. You love that one!”
Tony pressed up against him, kissing him, thrusting his tongue into Steve’s mouth.  Tony reached down, finally touching Steve’s aching erection.  His hips bucked off the bed and he whimpered into Tony’s mouth.
“No. Not while you’re drunk.” Steve licked his lips. “Sober up, then we’ll talk.”
. . . He thought he’d failed in his duty.)  Steve bit his lip.  Being together—like this—was so much
Steve jolted then went still.  Tony hadn’t hit him hard—it hadn’t really even hurt, just made a loud noise and startled him, but it had been thrilling and surprising and  . . . hm.  (Maybe spanking needed to go on the ‘like’ list after all….)
“Mr. Stark,” Rogers said, brisk and composed, “I’d be happy to give you individual combat training if you’d like."
“Pfft.” Tony waved a hand and stepped closer to examine it. “I should hope not.
Steve's heart sped.
Thanks for joining me! I hope you liked it. :-)
’s what I get for telling sentimental stories,” Tony snarked, “I’m doing it more often.” He took a long sip of coffee.
Tony closed the browser history and was about to throw away the entire luminous screen, when he noticed Rogers' training modules.  (Just a quick peek and then Tony'd back off.)  Tsk, tsk-- Rogers was behind on compliance.  He had twenty-two online courses and quizzes due and had only taken the first one.  Tony blinked.  He'd failed the first compliance exam.  Three times.  With a 17%, a 36% and a 41%.
“Thank you, Tony,” Bruce said, smiling at him with something akin to relief after reading the card.
, please!”
Steve looked baffled. Bruce leaned forward to whisper something in his ear.
“Mmm, hmm. Way I hear it, everybody with prejudice against bald Doms is making a terrible mistake with those two.”
In the past 72 hours, my partner of 1.5 years and I broke up AND I heard through the (pretty reliable professional rumor mill) that I'm NOT a finalist for that job.  So, I'm feeling pretty low.  Kind words doubly appreciated at the moment.
“Why don’t you let me give you a ride? To make up for my stupid.”
Tony flipped through the list.
“Of course, Mr. Stark.  A pleasure, as always.”
“That’s better,” Tony huffed.
“Tony,” Pepper said, voice relieved as she looked up at him with a smile.
“Captain Rogers.”
Tony let out a low whistle. Steve glanced over to see Tony giving him that ‘solving a puzzle’ look again. Steve turned away quickly.
“Sir? A call from Lt. Colonel Rhodes for you. Shall I put him through?”
Steve felt at once confused and hurt and hated feeling either. “What?”
“Curry’s almost ready,” Bruce said.  “And there’s daal and palaak paneer.  Naan’s in the oven.”
“I live here too,” Steve snapped. “You have no right to do that! Especially without my permission, it’s . . .”
“Agreed.”
Sorry to leave you with a bit of a sex cliffhanger, but I'm leaving on a research trip today and hated to make you wait.  I figured I'd go ahead and post what I'd written so far. . . . Hope you like it!  :-)
Tony took a deep breath and put his hands in his pocket. The elevator doors opened.
And what did it say about Tony that simply kneeling and being petted threw him for a loop? More than it would have for Steve to grab him by the hair, push him to his knees, and growl, “Get down there and suck my cock. I want to come down your throat while you choke on it!”
"To Eire!" Steve echoed and took a sip. He was afraid to hope.
“Stark Industries,” Tony said by way of explanation, with his mouth full.  “Excuse me.”  He hopped off the stool and padded into the next room.
,” Rogers said, brow furrowing deeper, “I’m just trying to be polite and--”
Tony slid abruptly out from under the spectrometer, strode over to the diagnostics station, and started entering the recalibrations into their old data set.
Eire wasn’t a particularly powerful or large kingdom, but nobody wanted to cross a dragonslayer king.  Word had traveled fast. Soon all the kingdoms and duchies of Europa were sending gifts to the new monarch.  And Howard and Gregory were both eager to be rid of him; what better way than to send the troublesome youngest son off as tribute?
The next day, Steve tried a new approach.
“Oh, great!” Tony said, a little too brightly and a little too enthusiastically. “Hey, say ‘hi’ to her for me, would you?”
And, yeah, Tony should just stop trying to drink while Steve was talking about sex.  It went poorly.  Choking was no fun.
“Workshop, J.”
Tony threw away the glowing screen with Time Magazine’s cover story and shook himself a little.
There was a little ‘click’ as JARVIS ended the call.
(Nailed it!)
Pepper frowned at Steve as he came in, but Tony caught her eye and shook his head.  Her expression lightened.
Steve bit his lip and focused on his prayer.
Steve was waiting for him for breakfast. Besides, there was pleasure to be had in pleasure deferred. It could wait. (A little.)
“Yeah, I know, sweetheart.”  Tony smiled.  “Now, I want you to bend over and take my cock in your mouth, as far down as you can comfortably.  Move slowly.  Focus on relaxing your throat like you just did.  Let my cock touch the back of your throat and try not to gag.  Just touch though; don’t try to push it for now.  Ready?”
Bruce and Pepper set the table with all the fancy china and cloth napkins and stuff Tony was still pretty sure he hadn’t purchased himself. (Must have been the decorator.) The table was overflowing with food: mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, green beans, salad, cranberry sauce, stuffing, all in gigantic serving bowls. There were five pies cooling in the kitchen. Clint had taken a dozen pictures each.
“Fine, fine,” Tony said, holding his hands up in surrender. He took a long swallow of coffee. He sort of wanted a way to touch Rogers reassuringly, a nudge with his elbow or a playful shove, but couldn’t quite figure out how, so he just took his seat. Looking around the counter, Tony had that feeling again—the ‘not-intruders, they kinda belong here’ feeling. It was all sort of . . .
“Tony?” Steve’s voice was hesitant. Tony held his breath, frozen. “Are you okay? I’m sorry.” He swallowed, then asked, “Is this no good for you?”
“He might,” she answered with a hint of a smile at her brightly colored lips.

Steve pressed a little closer, the length of his body so close Tony could practically feel it. (He wondered if Steve were growing as achingly hard as he was, but couldn’t make himself move to find out; he wanted to let Steve . . .) Tony dropped his head to the side, exposing his neck.

Rogers nodded. “Fair enough. Ready when you are, Iron Man.”

“It’s too late in the day to start our main training plans,” Steve said consideringly. “And we should probably ease into our—“ he considered his words for a moment before settling on “first encounter.” He turned to Bruce and added, “Don’t you think?”
Rogers’ tone was grim. Tony frowned at the circuitry on the table and resolved to have a word with Katie. Rogers seemed

They finished the ice cream.
Rhodes set the barbell back on the rack and turned to look at him.
“Yeah?” Steve asked, turning with a smile.  It looked strained.
“No! I mean, maybe. Sort of?” Steve’s ears started to go pink. “Heck, Tony, we already live together you know! And, I mean, it’s nice that we both have plenty of space to ourselves, even if it feels foreign to me. I just--” Steve looked embarrassed, but pressed on, “I’d just like there to be someplace that really feels
Steve enjoyed spending time with Rhodey. They'd watched the game on Tony's massive television, chatting amicably about nothing of consequence while the commercials flickered past on mute. Clint joined them half-way through and they'd ordered pizza, real New York pizza Rhodey'd been craving while stationed abroad. Tony didn't come up-- not that anyone was surprised-- and Rhodey insisted on being the one to take pizza down to the workshop, though it was awkward for him with his crutch.
“Dude, you better have hot cocoa,” Clint said with a theatrical shiver. “You do right? And smores?”
“Sure. Bet he wants to make breakfast.”
She smiled. “I know.”
Tony kicked off his boots (3.5 inch heels) and curled up in the corner of the couch, farthest from the others. Rogers took the empty seat beside him, leaving a little over a foot of space between them.  He was looking at Tony with that “I’m thinking hard and it hurts” look he sometimes got right before opening his mouth.
“Sorry, sweetheart,” Steve said, putting an arm around him and kissing his temple.
Pepper’s face tightened with hurt and frustration, that expression all too familiar.  She threw up her hands.  “Tony, five minutes ago you were excited to tell me all about it!  And--”
“Yeah, so the bathroom and bedroom are down the hall, and there’s another room over there for whatever.  No designated purpose yet, so yeah, maybe take a look?”  Tony shrugged. “Then I’ll take you up to the common areas.”
“So, this so-called ‘artist,’” Steve said tightly, “wants a ‘model,’ he can tie up and beat?”
They kissed and kissed, slow and steady. Steve’s cheeks felt hot; there was an awkward, nervous fluttering in his chest. It had been easier last time, when he’d been so angry, heart pounding and adrenaline pulsing through his body—as if he’d been watching someone else do all those things to Tony through a long tunnel.
“Done!”  Tony chuckled.  “Would you look at that?  Miracles do happen—this was shockingly like a conversation and I haven’t had any coffee yet.”
Steve turned his attention back to his sandwich, feeling like he’d said more than he meant to already, not wanting to continue, embarrassed to confess what he'd been considering.  Especially to Bruce-- he was like Tony, probably had five PhDs. . .   (I’ve been thinking about University . . . If I’d made it home back
Steve concentrated on breathing.  In. Out. In. Out.
It sounded more like “good bye” than “good night.”
“I’m right here,” Tony murmured. “You’ve got me.”
“It isn’t inexplicable.  I admit Kirk isn’t perfect by a long shot—”
He barely made it into his bedroom before shoving a hand down his pants.
“That you wouldn’t treat him right and
When Steve woke up, it was still dark out.  He felt a delicious languor in his muscles, but his eyes and throat were scratchy and dry.  Tony’s body was pressed against his, warm and soothing.  The rim of the arc reactor was a firm pressure at his shoulder blades, and Tony’s arms were tight around his chest.  Steve stirred and stretched, then let out a murmuring little sigh.
“Does that mean you’re gonna let me come home?”

“Hey, Cap?” Clint asked, “You got a minute?”

“I thought Sir was going to shower.”
“This?” Tony asked, shaking the paper cup. “I’ll be through this in no time. Just drop the mug on the hotplate, would ya, Steve?”
“Uh, thank you, sir,” Steve said awkwardly. He put his hands in his pockets.
Tony nodded and Steve nipped his earlobe.
And, oh God, he *loved* the way Tony talked to him.  He cheeks were burning.  (Good boy . . .  fuck your mouth . . . hold you down and make you take it. . . .) He grabbed the stylus and took a calming breath.  Did he like it?  Well! :
Thank you all soooooo much!
: and how’re you feeling?
“Mazel tov,” Bruce said, still grinning.  Then he added, looking at Tony over his glasses, “And Tony, please remember in future, *I’m always right.*”
Minutes slid by, one after another.
“I—“ Steve glanced away again. His whole body seemed tense. “I shouldn’t.”
“That’s disgusting,” Steve growled. “How could you do that?”
“Right,” Tony said, taking a deep breath. He squinted at the schematics.
Tony sat down on the couch and patted a seat next to him.  Steve abandoned his newspaper and his armchair to sit next to Tony.
Jackie shrugged. “I guess I was curious if you’d tell me.” He tossed his head and said a little more casually, “Besides, I like having all the gossip first--you know that.”
(Fuck, fuck, fuck.)
“-- many a break-up,” he concluded with a shrug. Steve was tempted to ask Bruce to repeat himself, but a combination of embarrassment and the desire
“Hey, Sourpatch! What’s up?”
“How did you two meet anyway?” Clint asked, waving a hand at them.

“—is my new roomie?  Yeah.”
“Ok.”
“Great! I thought maybe tonight we could hit up one of the swanky clubs you like!”
(Now was his chance!)
Lady_and_a_Tramp:
“Proprietary materials.”  Tony smiled an unpleasant little smile.  “I’m sure you understand.”
“Mmmm?” Steve murmured.  (And was that just a vocalized sigh or was he trying to say something?  ‘cause it’s totally unclear.)  Steve reached out to pull Tony’s arm around him-- Steve wanted to be little spoon.
“Tony!” she called and he paused a moment despite himself, then hurried away.  As he retreated, he could just hear her add softly, “You can still call me
DUM-E bumped up against Tony's thigh like a demanding house cat and Tony realized that he'd been standing around with the blow torch running, staring into space and he'd forgotten what he'd been working on.  With a disgusted little noise, Tony shut it off and set it aside.   He pet DUM-E's claw absently.
She climbed one step, then another, moving sinuously. Tony thought maybe she’d trained as a dancer. Or was he making that up?
(Whatever.  It’s not really spying.  He was in the public space, after all.)
(Shit.)
“Oh,” Pepper sounded disappointed. “Right. How is all of that going anyway?”
Rogers lifted his chin a little and looked down at Fury across the table.  “I want Iron Man for my team, sir. I realize that SHIELD has some concerns.  If Mr. Stark agrees, I propose making Iron Man a member of the Avengers immediately, with clearly delineated expectations-- the same contract you would give myself or Agent Romanov.  In the event of performance issues or breach of contract, SHEILD can remove any member of the team as required.”  Rogers paused, then added a belated, “Sir.”
And, huh, Rogers was addressing him instead of Bruce.  That was a bit unexpected.  And Bruce wasn’t answering for him! (Yeah,
“Clint, wait.” Cap put a hand on his shoulder.
Her tears left no make-up streaks; she wasn’t wearing any. She looked oddly small hunched over in a threadbare Cal sweatshirt three sizes too big for her.
And again.
It had gone well.  Really well.  A part of Tony was still reeling in shock—he’d initiated a conversation.  About a relationship.  And communication!  Communication in a relationship.  He’d never been good at these things before—not that he’d really had many real relationships, not the kind he’d put true effort into.  (Really, just Pepper . . .)  Tony blinked.
“Williams College. In Massachusetts.”
Steve kind of shook himself. “Yes, of course,” he said to Tony, then addressed the Quinjet more generally, “Good job, team. Successful mission.”
“I’m proud to know you, Tony,” Veronica said. “If I can ever be of help to you, just call.”
Rogers met Tony’s gaze head on, expression miserable but resolute, like he wanted to look away but wouldn’t allow himself the luxury. He continued: “I didn’t—I wasn’t thinking about how you might feel with me asking you out over and over, living in your home and acting as your Commander. I should have accepted your refusal and not pressed you anymore.”
“I thought we were all in agreement about the Hulk,” Steve said. “But if—“
“Take it!  Oh fuck, take it!”
Eventually, Tony finished off the BLT so he’d stop thinking about Rogers.
“These training modules you and JARVIS come up with are sure something.  Really something.”  Rogers shook his head.  “I know that you designed all of this, but sometimes it’s hard to grasp,” Rogers’ voice went a little soft, “I mean, it’s hard to believe it can exist at all, let alone that I know the fella who made it.”
Tony tightened his arms around Steve.  (He’ll leave.) Steve sighed in his sleep, face pressed against Tony’s chest, his breath fogging up the arc reactor.  (No he won’t.  He wouldn’t.  You’re being stupid.  Steve loves you.)  Tony reached up to touch Steve’s hair, then pulled his hand back.  (So did Pepper.  Pepper left.  You let her down over and over . . .)  Tony wished he had a bedroom bot.  It would be nice to have DUM-E bring him a bottle of water right now.  (You’ve let Steve down too.  Again, you fuck up.)
“You’re pretty close.  It’s the new para-aramid I’m working on.”  Tony took a sip of coffee and kicked his spare wheelie stool.  It rolled its way over to Bruce who looked amused.  “Here—I’ll walk you through it.”
OHMYGOD!!!! It’s Tony Stark. It has to be. Did you hear the way he talked about Tony and then the way he talked about this ‘special sub.’ And the connection to Star Trek! I’m single (and dad’s been sad on Valentine’s day ever since we lost mom) so we’re watching the gala coverage for sure! Wowza.
“Steve, do you want me to be in charge again tonight?”
Steve just wanted to cuddle (from the top). And why shouldn’t he? It didn’t have to be a bad sign.
after all.”
“No. No, thanks,” Tony said, “I’m fine.”
“Good.  Really good.”
“Sometimes I dream about it. The war. The crash.” Steve’s expression was pinched.
The already pale agent got even paler.
“Sir, a Lieutenant Johnson is here,” JARVIS announced from the ceiling. “She is requesting access to deliver the War Machine armor.”
(No, no, no, no . . . .)
Later that afternoon, Dummy was tossing a ball against the wall and running his dexterity protocols while Tony tinkered away with the TV playing in the background.
Tony let out a contented sigh and looked up at her with a dopey smile.
“Mmm.”  The silence lingered again.  Tony wouldn’t break first, even under Pep’s communication voodoo.
He wondered if Steve would invite him.
Phillips sighed again and shook his head, tutting softly, "Such an ugly word."
Really hope you liked it!  Musings and curiosity welcome as always!  Favorite bit? Fav line?  Lemme know!  :)
since Tony’d been under properly, not since— (No. Stop. Don’t go there.)  Tony couldn’t tell if Bruce was flirting back or not, which was unusual, but it didn’t worry him. They hadn’t even known each other a week. The attraction could simmer at the corner of his mind, a pleasant back buzz to the challenge of building a mini-spectrometer.
Steve held back the sketch and examined it for a few long moments before discarding it with a sigh.  The sketching, tea, and quiet time to think had done him a world of good, but it didn’t look like he was going to make an artistic breakthrough today.  Steve walked over to the sink and washed the charcoal from his hands.
Tony’s brow creased. “Uh, sure.”
Added 1/28: I wrote a thing on tumblr about self-care and thank you!
(I rewrote this chapter 9 times.  I have finally decided to post it so I don't rewrite it 19 times more and thus never move on to their first date, Avengers Assembling, the tantalizing spreadsheet, and new inventions Tony is working on for Steve....  I, uh, hope it worked.  Yeah.)
“What time is it?”
Tony frowned at the screen as Bruce stepped into the elevator. Seriously, Bruce was a genius for sure, but he was unreasonably slow to grasp the necessary physics of poly-aramid construction.
Fury shrugged.  "Call it what you will."
“Do we even have time before our meeting?”
“Widow?  Status report?”  Rogers said briskly, barely out of breath the bastard.
Tony hesitated, looking over at Steve.
“Tony? Bruce thinks he’s ready to go back to training,” Steve said. It sounded like good news, but Tony could tell from his tone of voice there was a big ‘

“Absolutely,” Tony answered with a smile and a nod.  He kissed Steve’s palm, but Steve bit his lip, brow still creased.
feel the need to crow when he was right.
“Of course I know that,” Rogers replied, a hint of mischief in his voice, “but it was the best pretext I could come up with.”  He shrugged.  “I’ve been wanting a peek at your workshop.”  He peered about curiously.  “It’s pretty swell.  What kind of bike were you working on?”
When the elevator doors parted to reveal Steve carrying their turkey on a giant silver platter, the room burst into applause. (But, no, seriously? Who bought these things?)
The elevator doors opened and Clint called out, “Burgers assemble!”
(Concentrate, Steve.  This is important.  Come on, focus.)
Tony poured himself coffee and settled at the counter. Damn, the coffee was strong. Steve must have made it—he heaped coffee into that pot like a man who remembered coffee rationing. Tony took another long gulp.
“There you are, dear,” Mrs. Rhodes said as he entered. “We were just discussing your bird.”
“Uh.”  Tony really only hesitated for a moment.  “Remember that secret initiative you know nothing about?”
“You think it will hold?”  It was the first time Fury had spoken since his arrival.

“Might get burned,” Bruce muttered.
) to find a certain cozy elegance: one wall stucco, the other richly colored brick housing a bright wood-burning pizza oven; the ceiling’s exposed wooden beams were decorated with Tuscan pottery; and the tables were lovely wood, uncovered, with a rustic finish and matching chairs. The myriad bottles of wine and liquor behind the wooden bar were an appealingly tidy jumble. It was warm. Welcoming. Worthy of the name ‘cucina.’ (Though ‘paradiso’ had yet to be determined.) And, although the restaurant was small, Tony was happy to see the tables were still a decent distance apart. They hung their coats on the hooks in the entranceway.
“Rhodey,” Tony breathed into the comm. “I’m really glad to hear your voice.”
.  Soon he’d need to go start putting his armor on.
“You already did it,” Steve said.
“Yes, Ma’am,” Tony said dropping his head to the side coyly.
Tony smirked. “I think Pep would resent you rounding up from six years to a decade.”
Steve nodded, eager and dizzy, flushed and aching.
“Good morning, sweetheart,” Steve murmured, running a hand down Tony’s back as he blinked his way up from sleep. “Happy Valentine’s Day.” And then he said what Tony
“Er, no.  He already knows.”  Steve took a deep breath.  (Start over.)
Thanks for joining me!  I really hope you liked this.  If so, I'd love to hear from you!
Steve’s heart was pounding, the urgent tattoo of fight or flight.
“I--” Tony cleared his throat, taking a moment to think. “I think it wasn’t very nice to spring this meeting on us unprepared. Especially since I have my own experts who’ve been working on this.”
“How’re you holding up?” Tony asked, smiling up at Steve once he found him again.  Tony squeezed Steve’s hand and pulled him over to the window, away from the crowd.
and Chinese? Please tell me you’re not chasing him around the Tower 24/7 trying to get in his pants.”
Steve shrugged.  “Some of the fans were sweet.”
“He’s in for it now,” Clint muttered. Bruce looked at him inquisitively.
“So, sweetheart,” Tony said eventually, putting a softly joking lilt into his words. “What’s it gonna take to get you out of these clothes and into my bed?”
“Yes,” Steve said, his tone firm.  “I’m fine.”  Tony realized with a jolt of pleasure that Steve hadn’t let go of his hand.  Tony watched patiently as Steve took long, steady breaths, his posture relaxing again little by little.  Tony wanted to reach out and touch his cheek, pull him close and kiss him, but he was hardly going to make the same mistake twice.  Tony squeezed his hand.  Steve smiled and squeezed back.
“Thanks, JARVIS.”
Thanks for reading!  Hope you liked chapter 3!  (Finally! Sexy time!)
(Oh fuck.  This was getting heavy again already.  Fucking Barton.)
Pepper smiled a bit sadly and shook her head.  “That’s kind, Steve, but no, I really don’t think so.”
Time to deck himself in gold and silks, like a good little gift.
! In fact, no nothing. Not if you’re gonna be a cheating bastard.”
“Mmmph?”
“I met the Avengers while you were napping,” Pepper said tentatively.  When Tony didn’t say anything, she asked, “How’s it going?”
“Mmm.”
Tony swallowed. He shook his head.
Pepper looked down at her lap, seeming sad.  “It doesn’t matter.  I’m sorry I leapt to conclusions.  So, uh, you were teasing him and—“

"Barnes really wasn't your alpha?"  He sounded surprised and something speculative came into his eyes.  He went to one of the guards by the entrance and said something in a low voice, then closed the door and took a seat again.  He poured a second goblet of wine and placed it in front of Steve.
“So,” Natasha said after a few moments, with a sly smile, “I bet you’re excited about J. J. Adams’ new
Tony threw back his head and laughed.  “Are you fucking kidding me?  I’m Iron Man.  I can take care of myself.  And don’t pretend for a minute, Nickey-poo, that this is about wanting to keep me safe.”
(See the end of the chapter for
.  Tony threw his head back.
“Right away.  We always enjoy challenge, Mr. Stark.  Shall I put it on your account?”
“I was wondering,” Bruce said. “After dinner, would you mind looking at the compound I’ve been working on? I think if we could find a way to combine it with your poly-aramid—or maybe use it as a part of the stuffing, like a quilt?—it would give us at least a 22% tensile bump.”
Tony was sorely tempted to go down and check on Steve right then, but he felt rough and exhausted and far from ready. Besides, Steve’d be in good hands with JARVIS. Tony gathered up his duvet and went back to the penthouse.
“You’re a decent guy, Cap,” Tony told him quietly, looking up.
Steve took the steps down to the lab two at a time.  He couldn’t bear to wait for the elevator.
Happy had gone to New Jersey to spend Thanksgiving with his folks, so the new guy, Francis, had volunteered to drive Tony over the holiday weekend. (Tony was famous for his generous holiday pay, after all.) Francis was a very slow, very cautious driver and, since he was still recovering from his hangover, Tony was grateful.
Steve let go. He pulled back and kissed Tony on the cheek.
,” Tony murmured.  “Good boy.”
“Oh,” Tony said.  “Okay.  Thanks.” He glanced away. “I really have a lot of work to do, though, so—”
“Sorry, this had to interrupt your research,” Steve said.
Tony rubbed his cheek against Steve’s chest.
And somehow Tony didn’t think Rogers was just talking about the suit and— (Shit, shit, shit!  Don’t blush.  Fuck, don’t blush.)  Tony flipped the faceplate down.  Rogers looked startled.
, then one by one the other Avengers had filtered in, drawn to the wonders of old school sci-fi. Sitting on the couch between Bruce and Steve, with Natasha and Clint nearby Tony felt pretty contented. And Tony found himself getting ridiculously excited about Thanksgiving, not that he cared about Thanksgiving
“Just wanted to see how you’re holding up,” Rhodey said.
“And note my astonishment,” Pepper said smiling.  “It’s good to see you, Tony.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony took a sip of coffee, feeling smug for a moment before a wave of panic washed over him.
“Glad to hear it,” Tony said.  “Any other changes?”
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
“You’re good,” Steve reassured, voice full of warmth (and wonder?). Steve stroked his hair. “I like hearing you.”
“Shhhh,” Tony said, touching his furrowed brow with a light fingertip.  “This time take less water.  Then open your mouth again and let it trickle down the back of your throat.  Concentrate on the feeling.”
(-- but a way to let the suit absorb the impact better, divert the damage away from--)
Johnson flushed with anger, but had more class than to make a scene—or more of a scene. He nodded to Steve, bowed to Tony, and left the dance floor with a practiced indifference.
Tony walked into the kitchen, took down two mugs, and poured them both coffee.
Steve cut himself off, breathing hard. He squeezed his eyes shut and swallowed thickly, turning away.
Tony laughed. “Best social advice my mother ever gave me,” he said with a grin, “was ‘everyone thinks they’re fascinating, darling—just play along and they’ll love you.’ ‘Course, I didn’t listen to that advice very well, as you can imagine, but it’s good stuff anyway.”
“Tony?”
“Uh, Tony?” Bruce said, fiddling with his glasses.  “About the other day . . .”
The articles and the clips all had a good bit of judicious editing. The journalists, unsurprisingly, never exposed their own idiocy, though, some of the more liberal outlets delighted in commenting on the conservative one’s patronizing questions.
Steve’s body was hard and heavy against him, and as they kissed he moved his hips—lazily at first, then faster. Tony urged him on with nips and kisses, too spent to join him a second time so soon, but wanting Steve’s pleasure for himself, wanting the hot spill of Steve’s body smeared against his, filthy and good.
At 3:23 am, as suddenly as it had appeared, the force field disappeared.  Tony felt unexpectedly outraged.
Steve chuckled. “Okay, Tony. Thank you. Really.”
“Oooh!” He called, “Next up we’ve got some quality Sulu. And a new type of green-skinned alien for Kirk to find surprisingly attractive despite the antennae.”
Steve just nodded.
Tony didn’t really have anything to say to that.
“Steve?”
“And I mean it,” Tony said fiercely, “if they don’t back off when you say so, I’ll sic the lawyers on them. Serum or no, they don’t own you. There are laws you know!”
Tony stepped out of the suit and grabbed a sweatshirt.
Steve looked at him dubiously.  (The heavy erotic tension that had built in the elevator is fading, sliding away.  It’s okay.  It’s fine.  They can bring it back—it’s good to talk like this, right?)
come to the workshop.
“Don’t see how that matters,” Steven said. He tilted his head to the side, looking confused, and the crown started to fall off; he sat up straight and shoved it back into place as he added,  “After all, we elect our kings.”
.  Then he gave Tony a mischievous little smile, full of erotic promise.  Tony faltered.  (Er, not like that.)  “Because I wanted to talk with you.  In private.”
“I hope Italian’s okay,” Steve said.
“Nah.  I’ll go with the team.”
“They really don’t care,” Steve finally whispered against Tony’s skin.  “It really is okay.”
He could feel Steve shrug above him.
Rogers’ brows knit together.  “I don’t want to intrude, Mr. Stark, but if you think it appropriate, I’d like to be involved in the negotiations.  After all, I’m Captain and will be acting CO for the Avengers.”
“Common room, J. Stat.”
(Huh?)
“I need a gigantic bouquet.”  Tony unscrewed another of Dummy’s joints and replaced the bolt.  “Really big, but one that says friendship not romance.”
Tony swallowed thickly.
: Good. Everyone has been very nice.
“Well, I should probably head to bed,” Steve announced vaguely.
“You know why. Besides, I think the mini-Avengers are kinda cute.”
Tony shook a slice of pizza at Steve— “And, no, just no!  You could seriously crush Batman with your pinkie, so don’t even start!”
Steve swallowed heavily and took a deep breath, then whispered, “Yes, Tony.”
But he wanted to obey Steve more than he wanted anything else. And at least Steve hadn’t said anything about being quiet.
“Golly. Thanks, little guy,” Steve said to Dummy, accepting the oil can and patting him on the head. “It’s very thoughtful of you to offer me your oil. Very generous of you to look after me . . . And I’m grateful.”
Bruce laughed and it echoed through the garage.
“Sounds awful traditional,” Steve teased. “Why would I have to ask you?”
“Seriously, Steve, it’s just a rhetorical gesture.”  Tony rolled his eyes and followed Steve.  “It’s a ‘look, I care about my friend and I’ve got his or her back’ kind of thing.  It’s mostly a joke anyway.”
“I think we have to start over.”
“Just one more thing,” Fury said. “If anything were to change, if you did run into problems or needed to renegotiate your contract—you could come to me. I hope you would.”
Tony whipped up a set of virtual training modules in no time and then had JARVIS modify them so that he wouldn’t know all the solutions.  (Genius.  Duh.) Their training gym was already a work of art, if Tony did say so himself, so no extra work required there.  The ceilings were twenty-five feet high to allow Iron Man some maneuverability and the place had just about everything a super powered response team could want: climbing walls; perches and ledges; trapdoors that could bring props up or fall out from under their feet; D-rings in the ceiling for every manner of equipment.  Rogers thought it was
“Do you really want to hear this?”
(Keep cool, man, keep cool.)
And Tony had never been so tempted to abandon Stark Industries to its fate.
(Interesting . . .)
Steve shrugged at Clint, then took a deep breath and threw a sharp punch. The bag shook on its chain, but for the thousandth time didn't break.
“All right then. I’ll go get my book.” Steve seemed eager, pleased.
“So good, Steve,” Tony murmured.
(Shit. Orientation therapy.) Tony swallowed. (That poor girl.)
Seeing Beyond: the Life and Work of Samuel Freedman
“Great. Now I have to rethread. Have I mentioned how much I fucking hate rethreading this thing?”
“There used to be this amazing chocolate cake,” he said, glancing down at the menu again, “but I don’t see it.”
“Cool.” Tony waved. “Later, Cap.”
Come to think of it, Tony hadn’t spent much time with Steve lately; if fact, he hadn’t so much as seen him outside of training in days, not even working at the dinning room table as usual. (Huh.) Tony frowned. Steve wouldn’t avoid him because of that ridiculous tabloid, would he? Even if Steve were worried about their image, that surely wouldn’t affect his behavior in the Tower and it’s not like he would blame Tony for the tabloid, right? (Right. The idea was ridiculous.)
“. . . in order. All right,” Fury said, getting to his feet with a nod. “If you’ve nothing further to report?”
4) They could still drop into a comfortable silence, just enjoying their food.
Tony just grinned and turned to the others, “So—who’s up next? How about you, Bruce? Yep. Here we go!”
Tony just stared at him, too startled to reply.
“Oh? Thanks,” Tony said, with a shrug, “You’re pretty
“How was your day?” Steve asked, smile growing brighter. “What were you working on?”
“Hey, Cap?” he called out when Rogers was on the threshold. “Thanks for breakfast. It was really good.”
Two of its tentacles were getting thicker and longer on the bottom, then another two, thinner and longer above, and the fifth curled tight into a circle on top. Tony blinked and felt the unexpected urge to laugh.
“We’re not trying to hold anyone hostage, Dr. Banner,” Fury answered. “We just want to make sure that you’ve fully considered what could happen out there.”
God, Tony hated this shit. If he made a scene it would be bad PR: “Tony Stark! Such a drama slut!” Tony had hoped to avoid TMZ, especially tonight—his first event as an Avenger. They were on the balcony, but the ballroom had a clear view of them.
Tony flashed her a smile. “Definitely.” Then he continued seriously, “Come on, Pep! Feel how light this is! I’ll even model the design on Wonder Woman for you—you’ll hardly notice you’re wearing it. Hell, it’ll be so fucking sexy and awesome you’ll wanna do your scenes in it!”
(Shit. Steve.)
“Well,” Tony said suddenly feeling awkward, “surprisingly enough, uh--” He licked his lips. “Captain America's sub is… me.”
“Fine?”  Bruce asked.  “Because it really is.  Fine.”
Steve could

“Tony!” Bruce yelled, leaping up and snatching the paper away. “What the hell’s the matter with you?! That’s private!”
“Tony, no!” Pepper protested. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Bruce said, sincerely apologetic.  “But you
Natasha rolled her eyes.  “Hardly.  I’m simply a keen observer.”
“Sure. Turnabout’s fair play,” Steve said, smiling.
, this wouldn’t have happened if the chain of command--  No, sir. . . . No, sir! . . .  For now, I’ll keep a force here with the spectrometer in case the anomaly returns. Though it seems unlikely.”  A pause.  “I’ll keep that in mind.  Sir.  Rogers out.”
So Natasha was silent. She hated wasting her breath on futile reassurance.
“You’ve gone two years without an incident,” Romanov said to Bruce, stepping forward around Fury, “I’m sure you don’t want to break that record.”
if somebody else fixes it up. Maybe . . .". He hesitated a moment. Maybe we could do it together?"
“Now, I was thinking,” she said brightly, “we could start you on Sam’s whip. Then, I could tie you down and ride you ‘til you scream. How does that sound?”
Tony’s frown deepened to a scowl. (Why the hell would Rogers bail like that? Had Tony done something wrong? Was he so poor a fighter Cap didn’t want to waste his time on him? Or did--)
Suddenly high above them, there was a blood-curdling shriek, shrill and terrible. Two greenish grey creatures appeared at the mouth of the crackling portal. Tony couldn’t suppress a shudder, thankful that (in the suit) nobody could see it. The creature on the ground answered with a long, wavering screech.
“Mmm… I would climb that man like a tree! Those shoulders! That jaw. Those arms!” Jackie whistled. “Jesus. He is sex on a stick. How can you stand it? How have you not thrown yourself at him yet? I doubt I’d last five minutes.”
Tony turned back to the training robot he’d been working on, this one a crisp Storm Trooper white.
When they got to Bruce’s floor, Tony smelled his favorite pizza even before he saw the boxes, but—
“And the whole world’s heard a lot about Captain America,” Rhodes said, eyes bright, then added, “It’s an honor to meet you.”
“Okay.”
Steve had finished the sections that Tony had marked off for him a while ago. It had been helpful.  Really.  For the past hour, though, he’d been skimming through the sections Tony said he could skip.  They were making him
Tony pulled away and stood.  Steve almost let out a whine, but then Tony said:.  “Undress me.”

Steve let out a shuddering breath and a little of the tension left his muscles.

“That sounds fantastic, Steve. I'm sure you'll do great!”
Even as Tony said it, five more creatures landed in the park.

(And, seriously, stupid fucking robots.  Not even proper Doombots —not that Doom made quality robots either— but seriously?

They should have just called campus security.  So what if the little things self-replicated like tribbles.)
“Are you thirsty, baby?  I brought you a glass of water.”
Bruce looked over with raised eyebrows. “You okay?”
Steve stroked the mark on Tony’s neck in a gentle rhythm; Tony leaned up to demand long, languorous kisses.
The whole thing felt wrong and made his guts twist and churn.
“JARVIS, would you please start the next episode of
“Uh-oh! Not answering the question,” Jackie teased. “Do I need to give an American icon pointers?”
God, Tony hated SHIELD: hated the macho posturing; hated the smell of industrial disinfectant; hated the bad lighting that made him look old and sad; hated Agents 004-099 who stared at his ass. (It was a great ass, but still.)
Steve’s body twitched and jerked.
“I’ll do my best,” Steve said.
“Yes, ma’am,” Tony said, still grinning as he retreated with hands held up in surrender.
He hated it when Steve was upset.
Steve leaned down to kiss Tony on the cheek again, faster, more chastely, half-furtive as if he just couldn’t resist.
“Yes, of course, Iron Man. Let’s find someplace more secure.” Steve turned to the throng, who looked at once disappointed and titillated, “Please excuse me.”
Steve looked up after a few moments and added, “Pretty sure I’d’ve enjoyed that trip to the Met with you a lot more.”
“What? What about your mom?”
“You called it a ‘Ranch House’,” Bruce said skeptically, looking around.
Steve reached into his back pocket and took out a small brown leather wallet.
“Rest? I’m not even tired. I thought we’d watch Star Trek!”
“Um, thanks?”  Steve shook himself.  “It won’t change anything in the field.  We’re still a team and it won’t affect our work.”
“You know how I feel. I like to help.” Deetz shrugged.
Tony let out a sharp little laugh and shook his head.  “First off,
Tony was surprised to find the idea wasn’t nearly as appealing as it had been an hour ago.

“Uh-huh,” Tony said, trying to pull away. He could hear the noise of the party just inside. They’d left the doors open behind them and Tony was glad of it. “Well,
Tony moaned, then bit his lip.  He took a calming breath.  (Go on.  Take control.  He wants you to.)
“Coming right up!”
Tony sighed and headed for the kitchen. Maybe coffee would help.
“If you were interested in something like a chocolate cake, may I suggest the tiramisu?”
Steve stepped away, biting his lip.  He hesitated.
“You haven’t signed your contract yet,” Rogers said suddenly.
Tony rushed on: “

Tony was shivering.  It didn’t make sense.  Why was he shivering?
“We could order brunch,” Tony suggested. Steve shook his head.
Tony nodded, then remembered he wasn’t videoconferencing, and said, “uh-huh.”
“What’s not?” Tony asked, plopping on the couch between them.
“You didn’t need to know.”

“I was also wondering if, when you’re done, you might like to join me in bed?”
“JARVIS,” Tony said, “Take me to Cap’s floor. And let him know he’s got company on the way.” Tony inhaled some more of his coffee.

“Yes! Really. Things are great.” Tony shrugged. “Just wanted a change of scene.”
So, Tony flirted, but just a little. He didn’t want Bruce to think that he was after a quick fuck ‘n smack between friends. Bruce might actually be someone he could respect enough to accept a collar and, oh God, it’d been
The elevator doors parted to show Rhodey wearing a suit—one not made of metal—and carrying a large box, probably full of his mother’s cooking supplies. (She’d learned she couldn’t trust Tony to have obscure kitchen implements, or even the items she declared ‘standard.’) Rhodey was a solid foot taller than his mother, but she filled the space with sheer presence. Maryanne Rhodes was always poised, dressed with a simple elegance that needed no fancy designers to validate it. Clean lines, polished and precise: red blouse, white cardigan, black skirt.
Mrs. Rhodes shook her head. “I’m making all your favorites already; no need to butter me up. Enough butter in the crust.”
“Yes,” Tony murmured.  He licked his lips.  He released his grip on Steve’s hair to lean back on the couch.  For a moment he sat, motionless, studying Steve.
Steve’s pencil scratched across the paper. Tony stood and stretched.
Tony’s mouth fell open as Steve took the tip of Tony’s dick into his wet, warm mouth.
Tony shook his head. “Look, people already know I fund the Safehouse, and that’s as close as I want it. I’m not gonna use them to polish my image.”
“Yeah, okay. Sure,” Tony said, a little bemused. “Send them on up.”
“Hey, it’s Saturday, isn’t it?”  Tony asked.  Steve gave him a blank look, then nodded.
He swallowed.
“Steve?” Tony called out. “O Come O Come, Emmanuel” came to an abrupt halt.
“And, sure,” Bruce said, “they had a rough start, but that was a long time ago. It’s in the past.”
“What’s going on?  Is everything okay?”  He could hear her frowning.
“Tony,” Bruce sounded some combination of exasperated and disappointed.  “It’s a scientific fact that you have less muscle mass than a Dom—”
(Oh God, please not too slow…)
“How long have you known each other?” Bruce asked, as the picture made its way to him.
(And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
“You couldn’t come back once you were better?” Tony asked.

Steve took another deep breath, intending to calm himself, but
Tony was listlessly scrolling through videos he couldn’t quite bear to watch when Bruce knocked awkwardly on the open door.
(Damn it.)
Pepper; just with her.  It’s different.”
It was good. What they had was good.
Thanksgiving Part II: still no turkey, but talking and bonding and more fluff than anybody asked for...
Steve woke to the sound of Tony mumbling in his sleep.  It sounded like he was saying “variable. . . twenty-seven. . . ninety-three. . . hypotenuse,” and then after a long pause, “penguin!”  Steve wasn’t really sure.  Whatever it was, though, he found the idea that Tony was dreaming about math penguins unbearably adorable and he propped up on his shoulder to watch.
“You’re--” There were tears pooling in Tony’s eyes; he tried not to blink, not wanting them to spill.  “You’re the kindest, most trustworthy, respectful Dominant I’ve ever--”. His breath hitched and he couldn’t finish, couldn’t force the words past the lump in his throat.
“Yeah,” Tony said with a shrug. “Just distracted.”
“Ok.”
Tony reached up to touch Steve’s cheek.
The room was quiet for a moment before Steve said, “It looks like a very sound strategy to me. I’m only concerned about execution. And thank you both for the additional reading materials. I found them very helpful.”
*fidget, stop, parade rest*
With a gentle pressure on his jaw, Steve tipped Tony’s chin up and kissed him, mouth warm and soft. Tony parted his lips with a sigh and felt Steve’s tongue tentatively skim his bottom lip.
On a bleak, gray Saturday afternoon, Steve wandered into the communal living room to find Ms. Potts taping a box shut.  There was another box beside it.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Yeah—just a few tweaks. It should increase elasticity.”
This story is such a source of comfort to me and so are all of you.  K.  Gonna stop before I get gushy.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!

Steve’s voice was soft and sweet, but nearly startled Tony.  He hadn’t heard Steve approach.  He wasn’t sure if he should look up or not—it wasn’t traditional—and (God damn it!) since when did he get in a fluster over such minor—
“Or not,” Tony said, holding his hands up in surrender, “I just thought, you know, since you said you’d maybe be open to meeting her, just to give it a try, that there’s no time like the present. Just a preliminary meeting. To see what you think.”
“Fuck, Steve--please just fuck me!”
Again, he could hear her unspoken words:
“Awesome!”
Ms. Potts look turned considering and she said in a subdued tone, “We’ll see.”
Clint offered Tony some Doritos.
“Well sure,” Pepper agreed, “But, you’re The Avengers! People pay thousands of dollars to attend lavish benefits where they’ll get a chance to meet you. Even if they don’t learn any particularly unique moves, I think the Safehouse residents would enjoy the experience.”
Steve closed his eyes and called up a scene in his mind. (Tony, pushing Steve roughly to his knees . . . “You’re such a pretty little slut . . . Take my cock like a good boy . . . You want it so bad, don’t you, baby?” . . .)
—then phoned me in a panic at the last minute to call off the sale. And the way he used to talk about the Captain, when they first met—the guy sounded like a nightmare. I know Tony’s difficult, but that’s no excuse! Meeting him was hard on Tony. When Tony was a kid, it’s like he loved Captain America, and hated Captain America, and Captain America was the ultimate ideal Tony could never live up to. And now he’s
“Of course it’s hard,” Tony said, then gave him a reassuring smile. “Trust me, I remember.”
“Obviously not!” Clint took a breath. “What about Tony?”
“Huh?”
“Hey, J?  Throw the stats for gold titanium alloy up on the left.”
Tony pressed himself under Steve’s arm and looked up at him.
“What, because you’re the Dom?” Tony asked, with a teasing little smile. “Well, if we’re playing by those rules I’m supposed to be some wide-eyed virginal ingénue fifteen years your junior, so I guess we just can’t get anything right.”
Steve threw his shoulders back and said, in his Cap voice, “All right, Avenger. Let’s go join the others.”
“Not bad,” Cap said, releasing him with an approving nod. “Next time, though, wait a little longer. Using your body weight to advantage is a good idea, but if you do it too soon, I can maneuver around it. Okay? Now, again”
“Sir? Ms. Potts is on the line.”

(Weird.)
It was true what they said: “eavesdroppers seldom hear anything good of themselves.” He wanted to go yell at Pepper Potts that he was a hell of a lot better for Tony than she'd been in the end, but he knew that wasn't really fair and, besides, he wasn't supposed to know that she felt that way. She certainly wouldn't have told him.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
&&&&&
Tony realized with a rush of embarrassment just how completely Clint and Natasha had been pulling their punches and slowing their movements with him.
Steve’s eyes were wide, intense, his lips slightly parted as he looked down at Tony. Tony’s eyes scanned his body and he noticed with a rush of heat that Steve’s cock was erect, pressing up against the fabric of his trousers.
THANK YOU!!!!!!      (((hugs)))
“Uh, no.” Tony frowned.  “What’s brought all this on?”
“Oh, and I made you some coffee,” Rogers added, gesturing to the tray.
Steve choked on his juice.
“Come in!”
“Thanks, Bruce.  That would be great.”
At five-fifty-nine pm., Tony had set the dinning table in the penthouse with good China (& both forks and chopsticks), placed all the food in elegant covered serving bowls (which he’d found unexpectedly looking in a back cabinet for the reserve beer), and was now trying not to watch the clock. Tony forced himself to sit down and answer some Stark Industries email. (There. Look. Productive!)
Tony got up to fetch his wine glass from the counter.  Rogers got to his feet.  He remained standing until Tony sat back down and then gave Tony this sidelong little glance, like maybe he thought Tony’d be pleased. Tony bit his tongue.
“Wha--?” Steve looked bewildered.
Halfway through the episode, Tony had eased into that lax contentedness somewhere between normal and subspace. Steve was a warm sturdy presence, his caresses firm and constant. Tony’s eyes slid shut and he let out a murmur of contentment.
Was Rogers actually illiterate?
as she helped Jarvis decorate the house herself. And she’d always taken Tony to midnight Mass over Howard’s objections about ‘that superstitious rubbish.’)
“Christmas—“ Tony sighed. “It’s just not my thing. Thank your mom for me though, okay?”
“Definitely American history. I've done a bunch of reading on my own, but it would be good to actually study it formally. Maybe art and literature too? I've always liked poetry, well, some of it.” Steve hesitated a moment. “And, it might be nice to do some basic stuff with science and computers-- not that I expect I'll have much of a nack for it, and, I know that we've got that stuff well covered on the team. I just thought it would be nice to understand it a little better.”
Natasha nodded.  “Stay put.  We’ve got the dishes.”
“Of course,” Steve agreed hastily, hoping he hadn’t given offense.  “I just thought—”  Steve bit the words off.  (-- thought you were spending Christmas with your sweetheart, that you’d gone off to Paris with Ms Potts or something. . . ) “I just hadn’t seen you in a while.”
“Sorry,” Tony said, wishing he hadn’t spoken. “That’s not on you. I shouldn’t have said anything, just, it was weird, you know? Meeting you. The guy he wanted me to be. Just, you know . . . weird.”
“Thank
The service concluded with a joyous riot of sound, as choir, organ, and congregation sounded “Joy to the World” in tones triumphant.  The church bells pealed as everyone bundled up once more in their winter clothes, wishing one another a very merry Christmas.  Steve shook hands with John and Cynthia, then turned his steps towards Stark Tower.
“Bruce!” Tony said.  “Long time no see.”
Steve moaned and nipped at a new spot on Tony’s throat.
“That doesn’t mean you can’t get hurt,” Steve said, very softly and seriously.
“Man, we were starting to think you’d been kidnapped,” Clint said.  Tony rolled his eyes. Clint continued with a sly look, “Or that maybe Steve went over to the dark side and was keeping you chained up somewhere as his sex slave.”
“It's okay, sweetheart.” Steve whispered, holding him close. “I've got you.”
Meanwhile, between phone calls and calculations and projections, a stupid little part of Tony’s brain kept insisting that by the time he solved this R&D disaster (which was also now on the verge of being a PR disaster and a legal disaster too), Steve might have changed his mind.  (Stupid.  He’s not going anywhere. He already
Clint pressed on: “And before. What I said about the tabloid. It wasn’t anything bad about
“Sure,” Rhodey said, “but that’s good.  That he’s not going to keep you in the closet forever.  ‘Cause that’d suck.”  Rhodey toyed with his beer bottle for a moment, then added, “And, well, it would do a lot of people good to have him as a role model, you know?”
“Yeah, well.  I’ve got a reputation.”  Tony shrugged.  “And I’m older-- I’ve *lived more,* gotten more experience, all of that.”   Tony started past Steve, heading for his garage dock.  Steve reached out to catch Tony’s hand.
Rogers shrugged.  “Probably not, but I’m curious and don’t mind getting lost.  Give me a try.”
As Steve slowly tied his wrists, Tony’s cock was still a throbbing weight between his thighs, but his arousal felt distant, non-urgent.
“Of course. Commencing the film now.”
Tony closed his eyes tight and turned his face away. Jerry. Gentle with the tourists and fans who got too close, but
(And, okay, we’re really far off script, but it seems like it’s going well.)  Tony kissed Steve on the forehead and Steve made a pleased little noise.  (Go on.  We’re not done here.)
Rhodey waved the apology away. “Hey, you’re probably used to trying to keep Tony in line, right?”
(Don’t.  Just shut up.)
“Sir? Ms. Winters is calling once more. She is . . . most insistent.”
“It’s almost seven.”
Steve gazed pensively into his wine glass.
Seriously? Is that what he said to Fury?)
Steve had worried he might startle them, but he should have known better.  Natasha had clearly heard him coming.  “Morning, Cap.”  She threw back the last of her coffee, taking it like a shot, and put the mug in the dish washing machine, then sauntered towards the exit.  “Better get a move on, Clint.  Can’t keep Hill waiting.”  Clint grimaced and finished his coffee.  Natasha nodded to Steve as she passed.  “Have a good day, Cap.”  Clint slapped him on the shoulder and said, “See ya,” as he followed Natasha out.  Steve wanted to call after them, to ask if maybe he should come too, if they were going on a mission, what he could do to help.  But he didn’t say a word.  He picked Clint’s mug up off the kitchen island, washed it, and put it away.
. Stark. No nicknames.  No plain old
“You are NOT hanging a Picasso in a kitchen full of bacon grease, smoke, and steam,” Steve said. He crossed his arms for emphasis. “It belongs in a museum.”
Steve’s voice dropped to a whisper so low Tony could barely hear him: “They say freezing’s a pretty quiet way to go, almost gentle . . . but the cold didn’t get me first, not till I was breathing in ice water and it burned my lungs and it was so cold and I couldn’t-- Couldn’t--”
“You all right, sweetheart?” Steve asked.
And so, while Tony ate a truly outstanding breakfast, he explained some of the potentialities of the Bob data and how he’d been playing with it. From there, Rogers asked about Stark Industries, Tony’s inventions, and, of all things, how cell phones actually worked.
“When I woke up, tonight, after the dream I thought, I just—I just have to master my fear. Go out there and face the cold, take it like a—“
“I’m sure I’ll enjoy whatever you pick for us,” Steve said.
----------------------------
Tony’s brow was creased.
* Pep’s suit blazer looks like this: http://www.ebay.com/itm/290933324245?_trksid=p2055119.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT  (Yeah… I totally want this for me too.  :-p  )
“Good boy,” Tony murmured, reaching down to caress Steve’s cheek.  (Yes, please. . .)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
(Duh. Mass.) Tony shook himself a little. (He’d been on the verge of asking Steve to watch an episode of
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Movers?” Rogers asked, frowning.
“Table for two?” a teenage boy asked politely, his voice cracking.  Tony nearly winced in sympathy.
“Sure, Cap!” Tony didn’t bother turning around, just kept his eyes on the circuits spread out on the table. He was tinkering again, a much-needed break from Bob. He’d been working away—come up with three more hypotheticals and started tinkering on a containment device that would attempt reverse polarity if—(Shit.)
(Why don’t you want me?)
Tony shook his head. He shouldn’t be surprised.
“No, of course not,” Steve protested, “but you—“ He cut himself off.
As Steve studied his face, Tony let his gaze drop. There was something almost too naked in Steve’s expression—awe, affection, tenderness—and Tony didn’t like to think what Steve might see in his own eyes. (At the very least, a mind addled with lust, that was for sure.) He closed his eyes and pressed his face into Steve’s hand, kissing his palm.
Rogers let out a bemused little laugh, then looked like he regretted it.  “Uh.”  And there he was, almost fidgeting again.
Bruce arrived first. He gave them an uncertain smile, squinting a little.
“But I wasn’t just small—I had health problems. Sometimes they made it hard to hold a job. I couldn’t have provided for a spouse, let alone children, so I figured it was just as well I always fancied fellas more than ladies.”
And now, at last, the time had come.
The silence stretched, heavy and doleful.
“Bye, Tones.”
Fury cut her off.
“Steve!”
Steve gasped at the feel of Tony pressing a second finger against his rim, teasing him with it for a moment before pressing inside.  As Tony worked his second finger in, Steve felt a marvelously vivid sort of ache.  He threaded his fingers through Tony’s hair, wanting something to anchor him, something to do with his hands.  He pulled Tony down for a kiss.  This wasn’t like last time— the floating, there-not-there, held-everywhere feeling—but it was good, so good to have Tony’s fingers in his body, his tongue in his mouth, all hot and urgent and tremendously present.  Steve moaned.
“Gal, actually,” Tony corrected with a smile. “Sharon Jefferson. She’s the best! Rhodey got me in touch with her after—“ Tony swallowed. “After Afghanistan. She’d helped him after his first rough tour.”
“You’re like a toddler!” Natasha said. “A drunken toddler.”
Tony nodded and some of the tension eased from his body.  “Yeah.  I want that too.”
“Bet I’m the happiest Dom on earth right now,” he murmured. “Luckiest too.”
Clint froze. “Uh, yes?”
“You’re just pissed ‘cause you know I’m right,” Rhodey said with obvious satisfaction.
Rogers opened his mouth to say something, but at that moment Clint called out, “Woo-hoo, look at you two!” and walked in with Natasha and Bruce. (What? Had the three of them been primping together?)
wants or needs. . . )  Steve glanced over at the book.  He knew Tony had read it.  (Tony ‘affirms and reassures.’ That’s what a good Dom is supposed to do.)  Steve’s eyes were stinging.
“ . . . Steve . . .”
ever get laid?”
Tony pressed a kiss to his forehead and smiled.  “I’ll see you soon.”
For a minute (okay, maybe a few minutes, spread out over many days), Tony considered hacking SHIELD’s security cameras for another peek, but decided against it.  He’d seen enough of Captain America as a kid.
“Talking about your sex lives together?” Tony asked, arching an eyebrow. “Isn’t that a little House Lannister?”
Tony’d fallen for Howard’s entire shtick about Captain America—that even as little Steve Rogers, tiny and frail, he’d been the most macho Domliest Dom ever because courage and perseverance and all those other Important Dominant Virtues that proved he was no sub. And sure, the movies and comics and stuff showed he was small and never said, “Hey, guess what, folks? He thought he was gonna be a sub and so did everyone else!” but it was Howard,

.” He shrugged again, watching the lights blink on and off.  “I just ended up looking up more and more until everything became a bit of a blur.  But, well, I know enough to realize that these things are usually ten thousand square feet.”
Slow chapter is slow, but extra long!  Infinite thanks to beloved beta, thatwhichyeilds, who patiently let me run through FIVE drafts and rewrites with her.  Also, all the niffty behind the scenes world-building with Katie and Mikie was inspired by her too.  Seriously, somebody get this woman a beer!
Tony grinned. “Well, to be fair, so do I.”
“I admit nothing!”
For a moment it looked like Dominick was going to follow Steve or try to get into it with the lingering Avengers, but Johnny gestured pointedly at his watch and announced, “We’re sorry we can’t linger.  Agent Dominick and I have another meeting in a few minutes.  Best of luck with your training, Avengers.”
Files:  Boring and predictable.  A decade by decade precis of American history that, judging by its amateur level of historiography, was drawn up by some conscripted SHIELD agent.  A huge bibliography of works on American history, by period and theme.  Cold War.  Vietnam.  Civil Rights Movement.  Silent Revolution.  About 200 eBooks downloaded to his imitation Stark Tablet.  (SHIELD were a bunch of cheap bastards.)  Handbooks on weapons safety.  SHIELD ethics handbooks.  (Ha!  Those would a be a delightful exercise in fiction.)
“That’s sweet.  And bullshit, asshole, but sweet bullshit so whatever.  Fine, I’ll fix the damn suit.  But I’ll take my time about it.”  Tony hesitated.  “I’ve missed you.  It’ll be good to catch up.”  (Steve!  Tell him about Steve!)  Tony shook himself.  “Good repairs are meticulous!  So no hurrying in and hurrying out!”
Another time, Tony might joke—“
“JARVIS, end call. And order pizza, my favs. You know the drill.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” Tony called, smiling at his lover. “Hell, I’ll even set the table.”
“Pep--” Bruce began at the same moment Pepper resumed.
“The patron saint of the lost? I guess that makes sense,” Colbert says kindly. “After all a miraculous survival and seventy years on ice--it’s a lot to take in. What has been the hardest thing for you adjusting to the future? I mean apparently we have aliens falling from the sky now. And Jersey Shore and the Kardashians.”
Within that predictable framework, everyone played their parts.
“What’s your safeword?”
“Yes.”
Her frown deepened into a scowl. “Director, do you—“
Veronica glanced out at the dance floor where high society twirled by in an elegant waltz. She raised one eyebrow and then bowed to him with an ironic little smirk, and asked by formula: “Mr. Stark, may I have the honor of leading you across the dance floor?”
Captain America.”   Rhodey took another sip of his beer.  Tony nodded, conceding the point. They fell into a lingering silence.
For a moment, the entire ballroom seemed to fade away.  Tony just smiled, looking up at Steve-- into his beautiful blue eyes--with Steve’s hand pressed to his breast, smiling down at him, expression so full of tenderness and--
Steve relaxed a little and nodded. “Seven sounds good to me.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Steve looked confused, but he didn’t know Nat like Clint did.
Tony grinned. “Nothing gets by you, huh, Hawkeye?”
Thanks so much for reading and for your patience!  Comments are cherished and adored.  Sorry slow writer is slow. Your encouragement feeds the muse!
“Sleepy?” he asked.
“Mmm-hmm.”
“—advice.”
(But he wanted to now. With Steve. And it was ridiculous to romanticize it, but—)
“Not at all, Captain Rogers,” Mikie reassured him with a kind smile. “Please have a seat and we’ll get started.”
“Yeah. They said that.” Steve sighed. “And in a way he did.”
“Sweetheart?” Deetz called out as they entered the Carlyle’s Presidential suite. “I’ve brought a friend.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sure. I could be,” Steve conceded.
“Nothing. Just,” Steve glanced away, seeming embarrassed, “sometimes, I still can’t believe I get to be here with you.” His eyes trailed down Tony’s body. “Like this. That you give yourself to
(Fucking Rogers.)
“Well,” Steve said, “I have been wonderi—“
And with that, she disappeared into the kitchen.
And, for some reason, that drew a little smile from Steve. “No, I suppose you wouldn’t.”
“Why should I?” Tony asked. “You know you don’t have to woo me to fuck me. We could just skip to the good stuff.”
Tony nodded and took a deep breath, trying to expel the disjointed dream. He took stock of himself. He was fine, though a little sweaty, with crick in his neck from slumping over at his desk. (He really should try to make it to the couch if he’s gonna—Oh right.)
(What the hell’s a tea sandwich?)
“Er, maybe eight?”
“Fine,” Tony said, curling up to put his head on Pep’s stomach. He breathed steadily in and out, matching his breaths to hers. Pepper turned her gaze back to her book, reading while she waited. (She knew he found it hard to talk about the Safehouse.) She turned the page.
Tony swallowed. (Calm down, stupid. You can throw
“Constantly.” Tony’s grin widened.
“JARVIS, give us ‘Devil in the Dark,’ would ya?”
“There he is,” Clint said with a nod at Tony.  (Mmmm.  Chili smells amazing.  Oh yeah, never had lunch…)
(Maybe a cold shower.) Tony snorted. (Oh, who the hell was he kidding?)
Tony rolled his eyes. “Obvs.”
“Thank you, Clint,” Bruce said. The smile on his face managed to reach his eyes for once.
*looks nervous; worries some won't like where I'm going in the next few chapters...*   So, uh, on that note-- if you *don't* like the way this story is developing, just a reminder that I ask that you please keep that to yourself.  It's up to you whether you want to read this or not, but I'm not soliciting concrit; this story needs to be my escapist happy place to keep happening.  Sorry to repeat myself-- just feeling extra anxious today (because RL).  Sorry & thanks!  *fidgets awkwardly like Steve; gives a nervous smile*
dinner, or if he’d just been hoping to hook up, but it seemed even more cruel to ask about that, since Tony’d rejected him, what, four times?
And there was really no point denying it, so Tony gave a tight little nod, still not meeting Steve’s gaze.
Tony laughed.
Tony stayed silent. He didn’t want Rhodey on the line for this. Still, it was good to hear his voice. “What the hell are you doing?” Rhodey demanded.
“Did you have fun last night, Tony?” she asked. He nodded sleepily, clutching at his coffee. Natasha smirked. “Good. Also, your night out is trending on twitter.”
Steve  thought about visiting the gardens first, but wanted to get away from even the moderate street noise.  The plain, wooden double-doors were unlocked; it was during tour hours.
“No! Of course not, Tony!” Bruce exclaimed, holding up his hands in surrender. “Of course I trust your engineering. I was just surprised, that’s all. I didn’t realize you were that close to a solution.”
Tony looked up indignantly.   “Just ‘cause I didn’t get hopped up on domosterone at puberty doesn’t mean—”
Tony paused next to the table and made no move to take a seat. Steve, who had been on the verge of sitting, shot him an uncertain look and straightened. Tony smiled at him.
“It’s Tony,” she said, voice going soft. “Will you come?”
“Understood, Iron Man.”
Tony nodded solemnly. “Cross my heart.” He stepped onboard.
“To shoddy journalism! To the dubious morals of tabloids! The smarm of celebrity rags!” Tony cried. “Fuckwits all!”
A few minutes later, before even realizing he was tired, Steve fell fast asleep.
Instead he said, “Anyway, lab’s calling.  Gotta run.”

“I’d have thought you’d like them,” Clint said to Tony with a puzzled look, then added after a moment’s hesitation, “Uhura and Sulu both get more screen time. And Sulu actually saves Kirk and Spock!”
It was a cute picture. Tony smiled. HE took his arm from Steve’s shoulder and stood up, handing the drawing back.
“I like this,” Steve told Tony softly. “I like doing things for you.”
“Right,” Tony said, feeling like an idiot. “Of course.”

Steve flipped to the back of the book.  It had 391 pages.  He bit his lip—this might take a while to get through if he gave in to the temptation to take . . .
Warnings: inappropriate joke about self-harm, affectionate, reappropriated use of the word “dyke”
Steve chuckled. “Yeah. Anna showed me. She thought I had the makings of a decent cook, but that’s one of the only dishes I had time to learn.”
Steve gave a tight nod. He didn’t ask
, sir.”
Comments and musings are a delight, and if there are any particular bits that you especially liked I’d love to know what they were!  (As you know, I find negative concrit paralyzing, but I learn a lot by hearing what your favorite parts are…)
“Well,” Rogers said a bit more briskly. “I’ll leave you to your work, Mr. Stark.”
He felt a little lightheaded. (Must have stood up too fast).
Steve’s face was a mess—brow creased like he was in pain, bloodshot eyes staring distantly at the wall, his red face covered in tears and snot.  It really should have been gross, but somehow it wasn’t.  Tony reached to the nightstand for a tissue and swabbed awkwardly at Steve’s nose and upper lip, cleaning him up as best he could.  Steve closed his eyes, and tipped his head down, away from Tony’s sight, cheek still pressed to Tony’s chest.
He didn’t.
Steve curled his hand around Tony’s throat and gave it a subtle squeeze; his lips twisted into a wicked smile as Tony whined in response. Steve rolled his hips very slowly against Tony’s.
“Because it would be okay if you weren’t, you know?” Tony said.  He meant to sound firm, but it sounded tentative instead.
(Good.)
It wasn’t very long before Tony heard the glass door slide open and closed again.
“Bloodplay”: Steve checked HARD LIMIT.  (He couldn’t imagine bleeding being sexy, even if he would heal really quickly.)
The stairs weren’t really faster than the elevator, but Tony couldn’t bear to be still. He took the steps two at a time down to the common floor.
“Nah. Cereal’s cool.” Clint grabbed a bowl. “Hey, Tony. We still on for sparring this afternoon?”
“Of course! I’m sorry I—”
“Thank you for the presentation, Ms. Carmichael,” Cap said politely. “You’ve given us a great deal to discuss before the follow-up meeting.”
“Only if you thought it was funny.”
“Tony?”  It was Steve.  “Knock knock?  May I come in?”
“Yes!” Tony answered, “Good. Then you’re going to connect the red, yellow, and white leads.”
. It was a sickly greenish-grey, about six feet wide by three feet tall, and most closely resembled an amoeba with five tiny tentacles, covered in some sort of gelatinous ooze that shimmered in the light. Tony shuddered. (The Blob meets creepy, dismembered octopus.) It skittered in a tight little circle, then froze.
“Okay,” Tony said, grabbing his coffee and calling up the hypos. “Why don’t you walk me through it? Quietly.”
“I made a frittata,” Steve said, ignoring their bickering. “But first, there’s something I—we—want to tell you.”
“Right.  Uh, well, she asked if you’d told me and then vowed she wouldn’t say anything more.  She wanted to know what I thought once I’d heard from you.  And, yeah, shit--”  Rhodey frowned, then gave Tony a rueful smile.  “--I really shouldn’t have repeated any of that to you, should I?”
Tony swallowed heavily.  He didn’t want admit that he’d rather fear the worst than know it for sure.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve was still frowning.
Tony went back to work on the suit. Clint brought him donuts and badgered Tony to come drink with him. It was tempting—the blurry camaraderie of alcohol—but Tony wanted the clear, precise reassurance of engineering more.
“It's okay.” (Everything's okay.)
“I’m gonna get more mulled wine,” he announced, and retreated to the kitchen.
“Thank you,” Steve said haltingly. “Nice meeting you, sir. Rhodey. I’ll just--” Steve felt like he should say something else, but instead he fled with another quiet, “Thanks.”
”—then worse and worse after he presented. His mother, though . . . Mom had been wonderful
Happy birthday to ME!!!!  Took the day off to write this.  Enjoy! :)
“Yeah,” Tony said at last, “Kinda in the middle of something here.” He’d hesitated too long. (Shit.) Tony shrugged, then added, “Have fun with Captain America.”
(It was fine. Right? Right.)
“Answer me,” Tony ordered.
Tony blinked.  “A safeword.  Did you pick a safeword?”
“I've missed you, Tony,” Pepper said quietly.  It made him feel warm inside.  “I wish we got to spend more time together.”
“No, of course I remember you, Mr. Silverstein,” Tony said politely. The bartender handed Tony his drink. “You recently left Goldman Sachs for Morgan Stanley, I believe.”
forty.) He adjusted his cuff links.
Steve’s breath hitched.  Tony pulled him down for a kiss, slow and gentle, and Steve felt warm and content, more reassured than he’d imagined.  (My eyes.  Thank you.  I’m glad.  They’re
Tony nearly spat his champagne.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The coffee was bitter and had long since gone cold.
Tony frowned.
The film began.  Steve devoured his chili absently.  (There is something kinda nice about seeing old cars in black and white.)  Glancing over, Steve found Tony’d also inhaled his food before the police could even finish raiding the speakeasy.  Steve set their bowls aside and then, very casually, laid his arm along the back of the couch.  He often sat like that.  The back of the couch was just the right height for him to rest his arm there.
“Not at all! Totally understand,” Tony said, shaking his head emphatically. “Don’t even think of it. And, hey, look! Data’s all up on your tablet.”
“So, sweetheart: about ready for that shower?”
A dozen spiders had broken the perimeter.
Monday afternoon found Tony in a foul mood.
?” Bruce asked voice tight. “Couldn’t we order in?”
Tony sighed (hoping it sounded defeated) then looped a leg through Clint’s and used the shoulder lift Natasha’d showed him.
, not Rhodey. Don't think of it as him.)
“Fine,” Tony said, recovering some of his composure and stepping (reluctantly) from Steve’s arms.
“I’ll go,” Rogers said. He sounded miserable, still not quite looking at Tony. “I’m sorry for intruding on--”
With that she slid away.
“Thanks.” Tony paused. (JARVIS would have said something if anyone else had tried to visit, right? Right. No need to ask.) Tony took a sip of coffee, then asked, “And Steve?”
When Tony got to his feet, so did Captain America.
It was getting late.  Maybe Tony wasn’t coming today after all.  The afternoon light was just trending into evening, long and lovely, the sky filled with striking, luminously pastel clouds.  Needing to get out of the Tower without actually leaving it, Steve headed for the roof deck to enjoy the sky.
“Yep, Brucie Bear!” Tony said breezily. “Be right there.”
“Yep! Solution was glowing right under my nose the whole time. Arc reactors!”
“Ah!”
“Okay. Tell him now, J.”
“Tony,” Steve whispered, voice wrecked.  “
“I’m right about everything—” Tony said with a smirk, more exhausted than mocking. “You’ll have to be more specific.”
Bruce nodded.  “Afraid so.  Tony and I will see about getting a spectrometer running so we can gather more data. That will govern how we interact with the force field. If it is a portal, I have a feeling we’d like to be able to close and lock it if we don’t like what comes through.”
The team had sprawled around the living room to finish off the mulled wine and admire their newly decorated tree.
It was good to be home.
He just needed Tony to
“Hey, Tony? I think I—“
Tony glanced up; his reflection in the window was smiling, his soft muted smile, private and pleased, not his smirk or paparazzi grin. His cheeks heated. Tony glared at the floor and got to his feet.
, glorious and gorgeous in his suit, but under the surface Tony could see the scrawny guy in that black and white picture: the guy who didn’t have a fella, couldn’t get a dance. It was so achingly obvious that
“Huh?”
(And, okay, Tony can’t argue with that either.)
Couples flocked onto the dance floor and Steve led Tony out into the middle of it.  As the music began--something traditional, simple, old-timey sounding--Steve pulled Tony into a closed hold and began to move across the floor.  With surprising confidence. And it felt good, so good, to be in Steve’s arms, to let go--even in such a small way as dancing--where everyone could see them.
—looked at him properly. His eyes were wide and searching. Tony tried not to shy away from that gaze, but it took an act of conscious will. Finally, Tony squeezed his shoulder and stepped back.
Tony's eyes were aching, his mind rushing indecisively, lighting on one possibility then discarding it, trying not to look at War Machine, mangled in the corner. The desire to fix it
Tony shrugged; it looked weird when he did that in the suit, but he couldn’t stop himself.  “Good, I guess.  Though we should probably practice without the harness.  We may not always have the luxury of suiting up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“This was your third appointment, right?” Tony asked. “So, how are things going with her?”
Dedicated to thatwhichyields (who already knows why) and Convalaria (who will soon know why) and everyone who has kindly encouraged me to write this story with kudos and words of support.  Thank you all so much!
He hadn’t seen Steve since breakfast. Not that it was such a long time, but usually he’d drop by the workshop at some point. With a coffee. Or donuts. Or lunch.
Steve pulled Tony closer, until his head was laid against Steve’s massive chest. Steve stroked his hair.
And, it's been a while (like, years) since chapter 51, but when Fury takes Tony aside to make sure that Steve and his relationship is above board and he's not being coerced, Tony says:  “Fuck you and your concern,” Tony growled. “Where was your concern when—“ He snapped his mouth shut, nearly vibrating with outrage. “Tend your own goddamn house, Fury.”  :).     Also, this out-take: https://archiveofourown.org/works/8450386 .
“Fine, Steve,” Tony said, taking a huge armful of brightly colored packages out of the back seat. “So you were right about the Lotus. I’m big enough to admit it—even with my god-like Tetris packing skills, there was no way. But we’ll be fine in the Audi.”
(Oh! Geeze. Damn serum. They didn't say it would give a man wood at the first hint of a breeze.)
“Merguez and goat’s cheese!”
Tony felt a warm, echoed pleasure.
“By going through it?” Bruce snapped. “It’s crazy! You don’t know that the conditions on that side can sustain you, even in the suit!”
“Aww, come on!” Tony said, waving a gauntleted hand.  “We’ve talked about this before!  We’ll go out to my ranch.  Far from civilians.  Controlled setting. You can let it all hang out—oh, hey, I guess that’ll be pretty literal since you lose your clothes!  We can see what he does.  Maybe he’ll flop down and make daisy chains with his new best friends!”
“Whatever.  Come on, Brucie!  Science!”
“It’s fine, Captain,” Tony said more firmly.  “Kinda allergic to apologies, so let’s just watch some ewoks.”
Meredith smiled and patted his arm.  “I’ll leave you to your thoughts then.  Oh!  There’s honey gingerbread in the vestry if you want some.”
“Let’s take this conversation someplace a little more private,” Fury suggested.  “Sit down.  Discuss things. I have a proposal for you.”
“Well, normally I would love to,” Steve said slowly. “But, uh, I’ve got plans with Sam.”
Tony’d figured that Steve would want to do their first scene at his place—they were already there, after all, and he’d mentioned
. Thanks. I appreciate that, sweetheart.
“Okay. Fuck this. We’re starting over.”
Steve let out a long sigh and pressed his hand to his forehead as if he had a headache. He leaned against the column, head tipped back, taking deep breaths. After a few moments, he gave Tony a weak smile.
Tony’s heart leapt.
As part of my new strategy for incorporating my world-building into the actual story, I’ll be including italicized sections of popular culture from this world: bits on the radio, tv interviews, advertisements, whatever seems to work. Please don’t assume that the characters are hearing these particular bits of pop culture unless they mention it in the story, but please do suppose that it’s what the world around them often sounds like. Hope you like the broader view of this world!
“Tony?”
Tony stared at the papers on his workbench.  Somehow, Rogers had done it.  The entire “morality and public conduct” segment had been dropped. Every word of it.  Tony flipped through the document again, half expecting it to reappear as if by evil magic, hidden in another section.
“Good morning,” Rogers said with a little smile. He poured a cup of coffee from the carafe and held it out to Tony.
Of course, that had all stopped when Tony presented as a sub at thirteen.  Howard ran the blood tests three times himself, then hired an expert for a second opinion before admitting his son was no Steve Rogers.
“Thank you, Captain,” Dominick said, in a condescending tone.  “Your plans for training are admirable; however, we’ve identified a few areas where you would benefit from SHIELD support.”
“High praise coming from you!” Pepper said with a little smile.
Rhodes looked at him blankly for a moment, then said in a flat voice, “The United States Postal Service was founded in 1775.”  Steve gazed back at him quizzically. (Huh?) “So I know they had the post back in your day. I’m not your errand boy, Rogers.”  (Maybe it was in his head, but it seemed like Rhodes put particular emphasis on the word
starting to get an idea . . . )
“According to the report so far: ‘Strange weather patterns and a shimmering light in the sky,’” Steve said, stepping aside so Natasha could reach the pilot seat. “Scientists at SHIELD think it’s a nascent portal. Coordinates are on the display—upstate New York.”
And Tony nearly laughed out loud at that, amused and relieved all at once.  Because that’s what it came down to, wasn’t it?  If Tony ordered Steve to read up on BDSM, he was happy to obey.
“Uh, yeah,” Tony said, wrong-footed by the sudden shift in topic.
Rogers spoke between punches. “I think.” Whap! “I
“Likewise, handsome,” Tony said, smiling up at Steve.  He was a vision in a perfectly tailored tux.
Steve sighed. Day three of Tony's engineering isolation had dawned bright and beautiful, but Steve had felt a certain uneasy melancholy. When Steve went down to the lab with breakfast, he'd found Tony slumped across his workbench, drooling slightly on his arm as he slept. The dark circles under Tony's eyes looked a sickly blue in the light of his glowing schematics-- dozens upon dozens of them floating all over the shop. Steve had never seen so many at once. He knew better than to wake his lover when he finally nodded off, so he'd just left the sliced apples and buttered toast with a hastily scribbled “Food is fuel! Please eat. Love, Steve.”
Tony sauntered in, saying, “I’m hurt,
“Yes! No!”  Steve couldn’t keep up with Tony’s questions.  (Shit!)  “Wait.”  Steve shook his head to clear it.  “Wait.  Sorry, I—”  Steve paused, trying to put his thoughts in order.
Tony studied the glowing projections, with his body angled away from the door.
Tony looked up at him with a warm smile and rubbed his cheek against Steve’s knee again. Steve smiled back at him, but he looked troubled.
“I should go—I’ll just—“ Steve stammered, starting to slink around Tony and head for the stairwell.
Tony squinted at the floating screens, while Bruce rambled nervously:
Tony shuddered and Steve pulled him into his arms.
Tony’s eyes flicked over to the robot open on his workbench, like a patient on an operating table.
Again thank you so much for reading this story and for all the kind support you've given me.  Writing this and sharing it with you is such a treat!  :-)
“Fuck you guys,” Tony said.  He turned on his heel and left.
coffee rationing.
(Steve’s a virgin.
Belford smiled. “Maybe I could get you both a drink?”
She took a sip and leaned back in her seat, still examining him.
“Yeah, I mean, I’ve got projects and work and stuff, but, you know, Bruce and Pepper have been on my case about life-work balance and making sure I eat and stuff, so, you know. Dinner and
Tony wondered how Steve was holding up. He knew Steve had been nervous.
Steve’s breath hitched. Tony leaned forward and Steve looped them around his neck.
Rebecca gave Deetz a meaningful look, the kind of wordless code longtime partners used. (Totally not envy. Not at all.) She kissed Tony on the cheek and then led him away, her arm linked with his.
And Cap couldn’t even get the words out! It was Tony who’d said they were ‘dating;’ Cap just hadn’t contradicted him.  Cap said “we’re not breaking any rules.”  And, well, ‘dating’ was a pretty flexible term . . .
“Both.”
“Yes,” Tony gasped, nodding. “Yes! Oh, god,
“Usually, when I cut in,” the Dom said with an amused smirk, “the other Dom is leading.” He gestured to Tony and asked Steve, “If I may?”
Rhodey groaned. “Do you have any idea what time it is here?” he mumbled into his phone.
Ew. Even more ew. How the hell did you write somebody a “hey, sorry you’re waking up alone” note that
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“JARVIS?” Clint called out. “Start the movie, would ya? Nobody wants to watch this shit.”
Steve let out a pained moan.  (Oh God, oh God, almost, almost, almost.)  Tony was still thrusting, brushing against his prostate.  Steve held his breath—he wanted to come so badly, and Tony had told him to and he wanted to obey, but it wasn’t quite, he needed—
.” The words sounded scornful, a more bitter noise than Tony could remember hearing from Steve.  “Since I couldn’t be a real man, I’d never get a gal; so, I’d better like other men, better like being pushed around, on my knees, tied up.”  Steve’s hand clenched in a fist.  He took a long, deep breath, then said, his voice calm and quiet: “Tony, it was . . .
They took flight. It was odd. The Eewoo turned out to be much
“Then get your head in the game.”
“Tony?” Clint’s voice was tight.
Steve nodded and Tony pulled away, letting a little gust of cool air under the covers.  It was dark in Tony’s bedroom, but Steve could see Tony’s beautiful form backlit by the blue light of the arc reactor.  From the bathroom, Steve could hear the tap running and Tony speaking quietly to JARVIS; the lights came up a tiny amount.
“Yes, that’s right. Thank you,” Steve answered climbing in next to Tony and off they went.
“Tony—er, Iron Man—thinks a patch from Hypo 36 might work,” Bruce said.
“Oh! Don’t let that stop you!” Tony said, waving emphatically with the bread knife. “They can always make room and Mrs. Rhodes loves company.”
“It's okay,” Steve murmured.
Tony got awkwardly to his feet, his heart thumping heavily in his chest, then he had a moment of uncertainty before shaking it off as absurd.  (If Steve wanted me to crawl, he’d have said so—besides, he’s not even here to enjoy it.)
“Well?”
Pepper grinned.
“Oh, it’s nothing special,” Steve mumbled. Tony opened his mouth for a rejoinder, but Steve’s stomach rumbled, cutting him off.
“Yeah. See? I was right to stay in Home Ec,” Steve said. “I did kitchen prep and washed dishes.”
“I was just calling to see how you’re doing.”
“I want this.  I want to be with you.  I want to be your dom and I want you to be my sub. Okay?”
Cap hesitated then asked, “Are you sure you’re all right?”
By midnight, Tony was exhausted in a way coffee and naps on his shop cot couldn’t cure.  (Well, unless they had to, but new body armor wasn’t that urgent right now…)
“Now, everybody, let’s eat!” Mrs Rhodes said. “Happy Thanksgiving!”
“And I never was that guy,” Rogers says softly. “The man with a perfect plan dressed in the flag, who always comes out on top and never gets hurt or dirties his hands. He was a PR campaign, an allegory--not a person. Captain America is an ideal, like America itself. But Tony reminded me, it’s ok to be Steve. And Steve has nightmares about the war.”
The pressure was building, tighter and hotter, in Tony’s gut as he twisted in his bonds, gasping a helpless litany of “Steve . . . Steve. . . Steve . . .”.
