"How's the leg?" Sherlock asked, leaning forward and touching her chin with the tips of her fingers, hands in a tight prayer position.
"I'm afraid it's time I take a break," Sherlock said to the woman whose hand he'd been petting.
And it was good, and they were heading out on a date, and John was warm. Very good, indeed.
"Too much?" Sherlock asked, looking crestfallen.
'Tell him to step on it,' John signed.
And there, sitting next to the fireplace with a glass of bourbon in one hand and his bloody pocket watch in the other, was Mycroft Holmes.
"It's not really John," John explained, unzipping his jacket. "It's Vicar Watson."
John hummed. "And talk more?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes and slumped against John with a huff, spitting and setting the brush aside. "After what I did last night, I hardly think modesty is necessary."
"Mmm," John murmured, stroking himself and recalling those beautiful eyes. "It was before you pushed me."
“That makes it sound like I picked him over them.”
"You didn't have to walk me to my door," John said as they came to it, hating the part of himself that thought it somehow romantic.
Sherlock pulled the half empty bottle of whisky from the top shelf and grabbed a tumbler. In all honesty, the last time he'd had a drink was six months prior when his brother insisted he try to get a flatmate. That had gone swimmingly.
Sherlock paused and looked down at the table, as if she had forgotten all about the thing. "Oh, that wasn't for eating. I'll see you tonight."
“True.  Very well, I’ll let my brother and his much more delightful husband know to expect an invitation soon.  James ought to be told as well anyway, if Mycroft hasn’t spilled the entirety of our private lives to him already.”
Mycroft nodded stiffly, bending around Sherlock to pick up his umbrella.  He shuffled toward the door, but paused at the threshold.  “I hope that someday you will understand.  I made a mistake, when I was young, and have spent the rest of my life trying to make up for it.  And regardless of whether you wish me to, I will continue to protect you until my final days.”
“That’s strange.  Didn’t Mycroft mention something about your family having magical connections?  This might be what he meant.”
“Are you okay?” he asked, laying his hand gently on Sherlock’s bare arm. Sherlock blinked down at him and nodded before apparently remembering his state of undress. Flushing a becoming shade of rose, he hastened to finally fix his trousers without meeting John’s eye. John grinned at his sudden bashfulness, finding it ridiculously adorable. “C’mon, let’s go try and get ourselves cleaned up. Did you learn anything useful tonight?”
“Yes!” she cried, immediately darting back to her corner for her step stool.  She situated it next to the counter and stood waiting patiently on it before John even had the chance to stand, her forehead barely poking over the edge.  Once at her side, he pulled open one of the upper cupboards and grabbed a box of bandages.  With a glance between her and the box, he nodded once before grabbing her under her arms and setting her on the counter instead, passing the box over once she was settled.  She balanced it on her lap before snatching up one of the rolls by its end and letting it unroll across the floor.
“He wouldn’t know you didn’t accept his request when he typed up the note. He makes those the day before, remember?” Before John could respond, Sherlock froze and pushed the tissue box aside, staring at the lower corner of the mirror.
“We’re no better off than we were, then, at least not in finding her,” John replied, his voice hollow with resignation.  Sherlock’s hand, which still rested reassuringly on John’s shoulder, was a calming presence that sent a wave of warmth through John’s body.  Sherlock gave it a firm squeeze before he pulled it away to hang limp at his side.
“Yeah, but a bit different this time. How does your audience feel about a little light domination and submission?”
Sherlock shrugged and leaned into John, staring off out the window.  “I assumed you would prefer I didn’t.  I am attempting to humour you.”
“Yeah, he’s just coming down. Give us a minute and we’ll be right down.” The man nodded and headed downstairs, leaving the two of them alone.
Teddy had just reached a hand out to shake Sherlock’s when he abruptly stood, still cradling Cecelia.  “You’re the metamorphmagus John was talking about.  But there’s no sign of it, no outward way to tell which parts are you and which are a disguise.”
Their walk back in from Hogsmeade was a silent one.  They fell into step easily, close enough to the other that their shoulders and elbows brushed with each step.  John knew that eventually they would have to discuss the tension between them.  Even Mary had insinuated that they felt something for each other that was more than platonic, and from the signs Sherlock was giving him John felt a bit more confident of what the other wished from him.  It was simply a matter of one of them taking the final plunge and acting on what was obvious.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but the smile still hadn’t left his face.  Ollivander finished taking away the other wands and packaged Sherlock’s, John taking care of paying while Sherlock simply continued to clutch it close.  Just as they were about to leave, Ollivander cleared his throat.
Of two souls punching through the void
For a long moment he remained silent, until he suddenly shoved his hand out to John.  “I’m Sherlock Holmes.”
As John went to put an arm around him, Sherlock leaned away and buried his head in his knees.  His curls waved furiously as he shook his head.  “It’s ridiculous, I know, but any time I’ve tried magic with your wand, it’s been difficult, or the spell hasn’t quite turned out right, and you’re so certain that I’ll be able to perform them that when I can’t I’m worried that I’ve disappointed you, and I’ll just continue to disappoint you because you’ve become so accustomed to simply
“She didn’t get everyone,” Sherlock replied, his eyes now fully fixed on Doyle’s face.  “There was one we never found, and neither did she.  A younger man Harry had never been sure he recognised as a former Death Eater but who we knew was involved, after that night we caught them conspiring together in a park.  A man we only knew as Jones.”
John could only nod his agreement as they arrived in the meeting room and were forced to separate. It wasn’t until they had long since parted, Sherlock to a group who were impossibly eager to claim his attention and John to the rest, that he realised he once again forgot to pay attention to Sherlock’s face during the encounter. For the most part, his expressions had been lost in John’s groin, but they were close and face to face while John finished him off. He glanced around the room in search of Nicolette, wondering if it would be ridiculous to go talk to her about Sherlock caught up in an orgasm, and found her hidden near a wall with a few others. Sensing his gaze, she met his eyes and lifted her glass in a long distance toast. Unable to break himself away from his conversation, John’s attention shifted from her to Sherlock for the rest of the evening.
They managed to make their way through the entire exhibit before their time was up, Sherlock still giddy with excitement as he babbled on while they made their way out of the museum.  John thanked the security guard who saw them out before tucking one hand in his pocket and the other along the small of Sherlock’s back to guide him forward.  It was only once they’d found themselves seated at a corner table of a nearby pub that Sherlock paused, his eyes enormous as he gazed across at John.
“Did you remember everything?” Sherlock asked, his hands on his hips as he attempted to make his voice stern.  Cecelia bounced up on her toes and nodded.  “Pictures?”
The two bedrooms sat side by side past the toilet, the bright purple door on the right obviously Cecelia’s.  John approached it, pushed the half open door the rest of the way open, and found Cecelia seated on the floor playing with an enormous collection of Legos.  Similar to her room at home, the ceiling was decorated in a night sky design, the stone walls dotted with astronomical charts and paintings.
“Harry, though generally as ridiculous as most, has thankfully been gifted with a fair bit of common sense.  I suspect he realized long ago that his wisest option when allowing me to remain Unobliviated thus far was to ensure that it would continue to be so for a long time to come.”
“Monday through Friday, with a new couple taking a full week’s shift. Madelyn and Siobhan agreed to complete their week at least, but I’m not sure if next week’s couple will be as willing to continue. I planned on going over to prepare for the evening’s performance after I left here, so you’re more than welcome to join me. There should be time for you to talk to everyone before the guests arrive.”
“But what does the question mark signify?  From everything I’ve learned on this quill, the only names it marked down were individuals with a  distinct magical ability.  One can assume that a question mark might indicate uncertainty, but what would that mean in this situation?  A wizard with a bit of skill, one that could develop skills in the future, someone who might have a talent at it if given the proper motivation?  Are you attempting to tell me that absolutely no one in thousands of years of magical history has attempted to try and understand such a fascinating abnormality?”
Sherlock met John out in the living room, giving Harry and Ginny a few moments alone in the kitchen.  The calming sound of their faint conversation just barely carried out to them as they both glanced the other over anxiously.  “It went well – Teddy and Mrs. Hudson are both fine.  But…”
John glanced up and seemed to automatically focus in on Sherlock.  He winced and stepped back, revealing a sleeping boy in the bed where he had been working.  Waving him over with a flick of his head, he walked to the end of the bed to wait for Sherlock to join him.
The last week of classes before finals, John’s organic chemistry class was released early. Knowing Sherlock was free that afternoon, John set off with a particular spring to his step, looking forward to spending what usually would have been an excruciatingly tiresome afternoon studying with Sherlock instead. He stopped at the coffee shop around the corner from their building, picking up a peppermint hot chocolate to surprise Sherlock. Their drinks balanced in his elbow, he took the stairs two at a time, digging around in his pocket for his key as he went. The jingling covered any noise from the other side of the door, causing John to miss the soft sounds from inside that might have made him pause. Instead, he used his shoulder to push his way in, Sherlock’s name on his lips before it puttered off into a gasp of shock.
John chuckled and set the tea tray aside.  “Oh, I know.  You’d think she was Sherlock’s, the way she acts sometimes.  At least we know what we’re getting into, given how long Sherlock and I have been friends.”
“We can go when you’re ready, love,” John replied as he wrapped his free arm around Sherlock’s waist.  Sherlock shivered slightly, but he shook his head.
John didn’t pay much attention to anything else for the rest of the hour, distracted by Nicolette’s words. Given the fact that she had been attending these events from the start, he suspected she knew what she was talking about. After weeks of watching very in love couples have sex together for a week each, she’d be well versed in what made each compatible and those that felt strongly for each other. Emotion was hard to hide in the throes of passion, even when they were acting the part, and John knew his were on obvious display the night before. He was determined to pay more attention tonight, hoping he might catch what she saw.
“You as well, Filius, particularly if you make it a habit to call me young.”  They both laughed and would have continued their conversation if it wasn’t suddenly interrupted by an approaching pair of footsteps.  Minerva was followed up to the table by a man, who she gestured towards as they paused at the end.
“You do that for the Met and they don’t tell you how fantastic it is?” John asked.  “Bit ridiculous, honestly.  I’ve never heard of anyone doing what you just did; you should be told how remarkable it is.”
“Well then,
Sherlock didn’t reply to John’s questions, but his forehead furrowed in thought as he rubbed a gloved finger over the words etched into Jones’ skin.  He abruptly stood and pulled the gloves off with a snap, looking between Mycroft and Harry.  “Have you made any leads into who specifically may have been involved with the murder of John’s parents?  Or any additional information on the wand you first recovered?”
“But.”  John slowly shook his head and let the book fall to his side.  “If she’s magic, why didn’t we know before now?  You should have gotten something from Hogwarts, or they should have, after you were born and the mark was put down.  They’d know you were like her years ago.  You’d think that if she went to Hogwarts, she would have told you eventually, even if you didn’t end up going yourself.  Why wouldn’t she?”
Mycroft sighed and returned to the centre of the room, a player settling upon his stage before beginning his performance.  “You first started to genuinely show signs of magic when you were five years old.  You always were an emotional child and your magic seemed to stem off of your feelings, so once you learned the many joys of temper tantrums, the magic became…volatile, to say the least.  Mother and Father were ecstatic, obviously, and encouraged your magic.  I knew it couldn’t be shown out of our own home, but they were too thrilled about the promise you showed to care.
“Make yourself comfortable,” John called out, finishing off the tea preparations and adjusting it all on a tray to carry out on a single arm.  Before rejoining his former professor, he spared a glance down at the cooing round face in the crook of his arm.  “Time to charm the robes off another family friend, my wee one.  Be on your best behavior now,
John watched the surprise in Sherlock’s eyes meld into a pleased warmth.  His lips formed into a tentative smile that John couldn’t help but return.  They watched each other silently for a few moments before Sherlock broke their contact to clear his throat and study his bare feet.  “Thank you, John.  Despite everything, you still manage to find the best in me.”  He gained back a bit more of his natural confidence by the time he continued.  “I need to get in contact with Mycroft, as loathe as I am to admit it.  I need to find out more about the Holmes those men mentioned last night.  You contacted Harry Potter after I passed out, I’m to assume?”
“A few weeks, but I’ve only really had any success over the past few days.”  Attempting to divert the conversation away from his magic, he asked, “How long have you known John?”
“Everyone always assumes you’re some great rugby champion when really you were off at your magical school playing Quidditch.”  Sherlock grinned and turned the page of the album.  “There’s always something.”
He came to stand at Sherlock’s side, waving the parchment in front of him.  He paused to take turns in laying a kiss on both Sherlock and Cecelia’s cheeks before passing it to him and taking up Cecelia.  “I contacted McGonagall yesterday and she’s got us all settled with Ollivander.  School’s already started up, so he shouldn’t be nearly as busy right now, and we can head over to get your wand whenever you want.”
The hand on Sherlock’s hip shifted to run lightly up and down his side instead, causing Sherlock to shudder in disgust.  When Sherlock attempted to fight his hold, Doyle shoved his hips into Sherlock’s arse to push him harder against the wall, working his hand up to grip the front of Sherlock’s neck.  Sherlock shifted his face to the side to avoid breaking his nose from the movement and Doyle took the opportunity to nuzzle in and place a kiss on Sherlock’s free cheekbone.
The first man saw Sherlock’s movement and turned his wand on him.  The shape of the words he was about to shout had barely even formed before John shot a shield charm at Sherlock followed directly by a stunner at the first man.  He crumbled as it hit him in the chest and John watched as the last one, sensing his inevitable defeat, dashed out into the darkness.  Sherlock, meanwhile, lay crumpled on the ground.
He left behind his wand on the coffee table when he set off into the kitchen, partially to see what Sherlock would make of it and partially because he was no longer used to walking about with it strapped to his side.  Sherlock cocked his head at the wand with mild curiosity, fingers twitching out at it on the couch cushion, encouraging him to reach out and grab it.  Unfortunately, the same moment he raised a hand out to do so was the same moment John returned to the living room.
“Ask her straightforwardly, I suppose,” he replied with a shrug.  “Show her my wand.  Find out if there was some sort of option for them about whether or not I should go or if it was purely the quill’s choice.”
Cecelia let out a shout when she spotted Harry, letting go of Sherlock’s hand to rush over to him.  Harry knelt to pick her up and settle her on his hip, giving her a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  John, meanwhile, held a hand out to Sherlock for him to take and brought him in tight to his side.
Mary’s blonde head popped suddenly over Mrs. Hudson’s far shoulder, shooting John a grin and a wave.  Rather than wait for Mrs. Hudson to move, she shifted and opened the kitchen door, swooping in directly behind Sherlock and Cecelia.  At the sight of her mother, Cecelia squealed and reached her stubby fingers out to her.  Sherlock reluctantly attempted to pass her over, but Mary swatted him away.  “Go on, Sherlock, you’re fine.  She sees me nearly twenty-four hours a day, I think I can afford to have her favourite not-quite uncle for a bit.”
“Oh is there?”  John shifted so that he held Sherlock’s face close to his with one hand, the other drifting down to pull him into John by his arse.  “Why don’t you show me, then?”
Laughing and nearly shaking Cecelia out of the crook of his arm, Doyle’s grin turned wild and his eyes enormous.  “You idiot, this never was about you in the first place, let alone us.  Who knew the great Sherlock Holmes could be so absorbed with himself that he didn’t realise his dear daughter was in danger?”
“I mean, they’ve learned things about the personal lives of others who performed so that makes sense. And it isn’t as though either of us is very difficult to find online once you start looking anymore. Do you think they’ll suspect that we’re investigating them?”
John forced himself to stop and sit up, his knees bracketing Sherlock’s hips.  He cradled Sherlock’s jaw in both of his hands briefly to place a kiss on his lips, the softest one they had shared so far.  He let his hands move slowly downward, brushing lightly against Sherlock’s collar to slide down to his buttons.  He shifted his suit jacket aside to make his shirt more easily accessible and set to work undoing the buttons purposefully slowly.  Sherlock shimmied in his impatience, attempting to convince John to hurry by throwing his chest up against John’s hands.
John did as he was told with a roll of his eyes.  Though it was doubtful Sherlock could have seen the action, John heard him let out a small chuckle.  John shoved his shoulder gently into Sherlock’s, a playful motion they had become comfortable with since his return, and Sherlock reached out to give the arm a squeeze.  John was just opening his mouth to make a comment when Sherlock squeezed again, his blunt fingernails digging somewhat painfully into John’s arm.  Shooting his head up to look into the clearing, John saw three figures begin to gradually approach from three different directions.
“I also learned of Albus Dumbledore and his position as headmaster of Hogwarts from Mother, although she hardly knew much beyond his name.  A few weeks before I was due to return to school, your magic grew particularly strong.  Other than preparation for my return, I was predominantly ignored in favour of watching you for signs of magic.  It doesn’t excuse what I did, but I…I want you to know that it was done out of passion, rather than any direct malice or expectation that what I was doing would have any effect whatsoever.
She nodded and shook his hand back.  “Very well, John.  I hope you understand just how much of a favour you are doing the school and Poppy by taking this position.  When she suggested you, I sincerely hoped you would agree.”
that?”
“You said Albright for the girl and Sacksby and Moore for the boys, I believe?  There was a Sacksby in Ravenclaw a few years back, but I’m almost certain the student was an only child.  Beyond that, the names don’t particularly stand out to me.  If it was a direct attack on the siblings of Muggleborn students, it would make more sense, but why brand Muggles in such a way if they are innocent of connections to the wizarding world?”
“Yes, I’m fine. Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Hey Sherlock,” he asked, setting a hand on Sherlock’s hip to steady him as he stood on a stool to reach the upper branches.  “You wouldn’t happen to have gotten any farther on your experiments with electricity, have you?”
“We already knew going into this that it would be a challenge,” John countered, keeping his voice steady and calm.  He came to stand in the doorway to the sitting room, giving Sherlock the room to pace.  “It’s been lying in wait inside of you for longer than usual with most wizards, so it’ll take more to coax it out.  We’ve both seen you perform magic – it’s in there and you know it, you’ve just got to convince it to come out.  The potential’s right there.”
To fuse us together as one.
Frustrated, he slammed his hand down on the puzzle, causing the pieces that were attached to break apart and the loose ones to scatter to the floor.  While his classmates scrambled around to do as Miss Jones had asked, Sherlock remained in his seat and glared at the floor.  He heard the click of Miss Jones’ approaching footsteps and refused to look up at her even when he saw her shadow out of the corner of his eye when she knelt next to him.
“I’m available until mid-afternoon,” Mycroft cut in.  At their questioning silence, he shifted uncomfortably.  “I made sure to free part of my day in order to speak with you.  I also may have set aside a bit of extra should it not go well in order to spend some time with James.”
John giggled into his hand.  “My sister Harry plays the violin too.  Even when she plays the regular notes, it doesn’t sound like what it’s supposed to.”  He nodded at Sherlock’s chest.  “I like your costume.  Are you Dracula?”
“It’s ridiculous, like I said.  It’s new for both of us, as I’m well aware, but it feels as though there’s more at stake here.  Ruining this is not an option.”
In symmetry with ourselves
“I’ll talk to him, but only if I can meet the dog first.”
“Da?” Cecelia asked, causing John to look down at her.  She reached out to hold Sherlock’s hand in her own small one, staring up at the both of them.  “Can we go home now?  Properly home?”
“He…his hands mostly stayed on my back, hip, and neck.  But he did…he kissed my cheek, right before you arrived.  I…it mostly was…what he said, he…”  Sherlock stopped and shook his head, frustrated with himself and his inability to simply say what happened.
John left Sherlock to poke about at the costumes left for customers and decided to explore the second room. With the full light, he was able to spot a doorway close to the refreshment table. He found a tight hallway beyond it, leading to a closet sized kitchenette, a bathroom, and a third locked door. He did a quick search of both open rooms, but didn’t find anything out of the ordinary. When he returned to the main room, it was to find Sherlock guiding two large men into it from the opposite direction.
John gaped up at Teddy, mouth open wide and eyebrows raised nearly to his hairline.  He blinked slowly, making a deliberate point to calm his suddenly racing heart before clearing his throat to speak.  “Edward Remus Lupin, I need you to say that again and slowly.  You said which is a what?”
Sherlock frowned but nodded his thanks.  They left the relative quiet of the wand shop and reemerged onto the street that screamed with noise.  John stopped him just next to the door, pulling him aside and wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist.
“Exactly what I said,” Sherlock replied, leaping to his feet and ignoring the offering of tea in favour of his violin on the other side of the room.  “Regardless,
“Yes.”
Sometime soon I hope to take the wand inspiration I found and these symbols and actually draw what Sherlock's wand looks like.  We'll see if I manage it.
“I suppose so.”  Sherlock wasn’t sure why he didn’t want to tell John about what happened with Doyle.  Part of it may have been pride; he had dealt with far worse on his own before he had John and was more than capable of fighting off yet another heart eyed admirer.  He also knew he didn’t want to worry John and expected that it would only get worse if he said anything.  Instead, he burrowed his face deeper into John’s chest and sighed.  “How was Cecelia today?  She doesn’t bother you when I leave her in the hospital with you, does she?”
John and James shared confused raised eyebrows but Sherlock and Mycroft seemed to understand each other.  Sherlock shrugged, John’s arm still at his waist, and shoved his hands into his trouser pockets.”You could certainly do far worse,” he said, shooting James a glance.  James took it for the compliment it was and nodded at Sherlock, accepting his approval.  They stood in somewhat awkward silence for a moment, Mycroft hovering near the doorway with James, before Sherlock huffed and lowered his head.  “I…have gained a better understanding of why you did what you did, Mycroft, and it’s.  Fine, I suppose.  I’m sure I would have done far worse if I had been in your position.”
“There’s Beauxbatons somewhere in France and Durmstrang in Bulgaria, but I seriously doubt he would have managed to get that past Harry.  If they both work at the Ministry, and we know they’re both the heads of each of their departments, there’s no way Mycroft would have been able to keep his magic a secret if he had any.”
It was raining.  Naturally.  Abso-fucking-lutely it would be raining.  What else would it be doing the
Sherlock gave him his chance to shout, staying back to simply observe for once. While John quietly huffed out breaths like the silently raging bull he was, Mary continued to sit along the edge and stare out into nothing.
John squeezed his grip and leaned up to place a quick peck on his cheek.  “Course we are.  Been wanting to come back for a long time now.”  He ignored the vague pink tinge that coloured Sherlock’s face as a result of his words and scooped up a few of the bags, gesturing with his head upstairs.  “Come on, let’s get all this up and the little lass settled.  She’s due for a nap.”
Sherlock had gone back to his mobile, but John could tell he was paying attention from the fact that his eyes weren’t moving across the screen. “Bondage. What did you have in mind? I’m assuming you won’t let us leave this evening without discussing it beforehand.”
“Professor McGonagall must have heard how much you like them.  We’ll have to make sure to thank her later.”
Soon enough the audience entered the room and Sherlock disappeared into the shadows, leaving John alone in the middle of everything. At first he tried to keep an eye on where he thought Sherlock was hidden, protective of him as always. His attempts to amuse everyone at the same time stopped him from giving his search his full attention and soon he was lost to the dark edges of the room. When the announcement came for them to proceed to the performance area, Sherlock appeared at his shoulder and John let out the breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.
“Right, well, if I’m going to tell Mrs. H, we should head back home.  We’ve only got a few hours left before Cecelia will be back and we’ve still got to tell her as well.”
“Not sure.  One of the things we know for sure about my parents’ deaths was that Death Eaters were involved, though.  They left the Dark Mark in the sky and were able to identify one caster as a known Death Eater from studying the magical residue on the bodies after death.”
“That’s my fault, but to be fair, it is your come,” John said as he pushed himself to his feet. He adjusted his trousers so that they at least sat straight, despite his groin being out for everyone to see. With how tight the trousers were, he expected they would at least stay in place and keep a bit of John’s modesty.
“John, I need you to listen to me carefully,” Teddy whispered, his eyes currently blue and blown huge.  “That woman…I don’t know who she is, but if she hasn’t told you already…John, she’s like me.  She’s a metamorphmagus.”
John’s grin was predatory as he sank back down, this time up where the edge of his pants hit his leg.  He gently pushed Sherlock’s leg down to open up the crease and nuzzle into it.  He shifted his mouth to bite Sherlock’s pants, just enough to pull the fabric away and have it snap back against him.  Sherlock shuffled to thrust up into him, letting out a garbled noise when John bit and licked his way up to the edge at his waist.  He looked up at Sherlock through his eyelashes and chuckled into Sherlock’s bellybutton, causing Sherlock to shiver and jolt.
“Oi, none of that,” he chided quietly as he started to collect the cereal he could reach and stuff it into his pocket.  She tried to reach for the container but John held it out of the way, raising his eyebrows at her.  “Nope, you’ll not get any if all you’re going to do is throw them about.  I’m not going to spend the whole ride cleaning up Cheerios after you.”
“I genuinely thought that I was doing something that would be in your best interests,” Mycroft snapped.  His knuckles holding his umbrella had turned completely white where he gripped it in an iron hold.  “I was afraid that being different, being even more exceptional than you already were, would only make your life more hellish.  Part of my actions were done out of jealousy, but an equally large part came from a desire to ensure you wouldn’t be hurt or used for your brilliance as I had been.
Surprisingly, Sherlock found Slughorn in particular to be a strong asset after Doyle’s disappearance.  While others tended to look on him as someone to be pitied after news of the attack spread through the school, Slughorn treated him much the same as always as long as he continued to be brilliant.  Brewing potions held a similar satisfaction for him to performing experiments would at home, grounding him in a concrete action that worked towards a specific goal, resulting in Sherlock travelling down to Slughorn’s empty classroom to work alone at one of the many tables.  While the journey to the classroom brought on many vivid memories, each trip grew easier until Sherlock strolled the halls once more with his former confidence.  John didn’t mention it specifically, but Sherlock knew he noticed from the pleased smile he shot Sherlock’s way each time he returned more relaxed than the time before.
John gave a long sigh, letting his head fall back against the cushions.  “God.  I should have expected all this.  I should have done something about it when she gave us the flash drive.  This was a disaster from the start.”
"Of course it isn't Harry's, John, don't be an idiot," Sherlock scoffed at him. "I doubt Harry would have let me get away with it, he's got an eye on his wand at all times because he, unlike the rest of the lot, actually has a bit of intelligence. It's Faulkner's, he wasn't paying attention to it during all of the activity going on and I could see from the grain of the wood that it was one of the more lenient types. It's helpful the core isn't unicorn hair either, so it should be fairly straightforward to get it to work for me with a bit of force and determination."
Sherlock let out a breath and ran his free hand through his hair, clenching it tightly at the base of his neck.  “I know that, logically, but it lurks at the back of my mind nonetheless.  All of my doubts, manifesting themselves in the form of his voice.  It’s constantly trying to point out my faults, remind me of those I couldn’t help, pointing out all of the ways I could fail – “
“Merman,” John muttered, rolling the word over his tongue.  Sherlock waited for him to continue, an uncertain expression on his face.  When John simply smiled up at him once more, Sherlock nodded and pulled their hands apart.  John tucked the shell Sherlock gave him into one of his pockets and straightened.  “Yeah, okay, sure.  What’s this oyster look like, then?”
John attempted to keep his nerves in check as the day grew closer, immersing himself in work to distract himself and prevent any suspicion from Sherlock.  On the day of January 29
And here we are at the end! Thanks to everyone who joined me on this little journey. And an extra special shout out to Ashlee, the best and funniest beta ever. See you next fic!
Cecelia had met Neville a few times since her first visit to Hogwarts as a baby, but she didn’t know him as well as some of their other friends.  As soon as Neville noticed her, he squatted down until he was at her level and held out his hand to her.
The one Sherlock chose specifically wasn’t much different than most of the others the album held.  John, most likely around fifteen years old, sat astride his broom, his Quidditch robes billowing down behind him.  He lifted a hand to wave at Sherlock and shot him a wink before darting away out of frame.  He returned seconds later, following a red ball and catching it just before it went through the hoop in the background of the image.  His arm flexed as he threw the ball back out of frame and he wiped at his forehead, his fringe sticking up wildly from the movement.  Sherlock let out a slow breath and returned the image to its appropriate place.
As John sucked marks across Sherlock’s collarbones and neck, his hands moved constantly, tugging at random along different lines of rope. At first, Sherlock’s hands fluttered everywhere, attempting to find a place to anchor themselves that John would approve of. John noticed quickly and used both his hands to grab his wrists and pin them to the small of his back. Immediately Sherlock let out a sigh of satisfaction as he locked his hands together and held on tight. Pleased that he read Sherlock correctly, John returned to his pulling, occasionally letting the rope snap back against Sherlock’s skin. He felt how hard Sherlock’s cock was where it occasionally nudged against John’s stomach, the front of his pants half soaked from how much he was leaking. When John finally pulled away to look Sherlock over, it was to see him sagging in pleasure, his knees pushed wide apart to give John more room and his skin spotted with multiple satisfying red welts.
As John spoke, Sherlock pulled back far enough to see his face.  His mouth fell open into a wide circle of surprise, his eyebrows rising higher on his forehead with each word John spoke.  When John was finally finished, he blinked slowly and eventually pulled John into his chest.  John could feel him shaking and clutched him closer, digging his fingers into his dressing gown.  They only separated when the distant sound of Cecelia crying caught their attention.
Once the applause died down, Ms. Ingram started collecting the class together, attempting to disperse students off to their parents so they could begin setting up for the party.  Ignoring her, Sherlock headed towards where his parents sat, but found the three seats empty.  Instead, he found the boy seated at the third chair in, his legs still swinging from where they hung a few inches above the floor.  When he spotted Sherlock at the end of the row, his face lit up in a bright smile and he jumped down to run toward him.
“Just checking that everything’s sorted.”  He turned to meet Sherlock’s lips in a proper kiss before standing and stretching.  “Don’t suppose I could convince you to eat anything before we head out?  Wouldn’t want you getting lightheaded right when things are getting interesting.”
Sherlock made sure to meet John’s eyes before responding. “I trust you with my life, John. There’s no one else I’ve ever felt more comfortable doing this with. I put myself in your incredibly capable hands with the upmost confidence.”
“Follow the light for me, okay, darling?”  Her eyes darted back and forth as she watched the light move.  Satisfied for the moment, John clicked it off.  “Wonderful job.  It looks okay right now, but next time we’re in London we’ll visit the eye doctor, yeah?  Your papa’s due for an exam too, you can do it together.”
The man still at the counter grumbled his own order at the same worker who took John’s, his deep voice causing John’s head to shoot up.  He eyed the man over the top of his mobile, but he could barely see what he looked like behind the long, dark coat he wore.  Equally dark curls peaked over the top of his upturned collar and black trousers leading to a pair of shiny shoes were the only other distinguishing characteristics John noticed from his position.  Just as he was hoping to see more, the man turned and came to sit beside him on the bench.
“Teddy’s called me that ever since he could talk.  Even though I was off in Afghanistan when he was still small, I rang him up when I could and sent letters.  I still have a collection of all the pictures he drew to send over to me.  It just became natural for him to call me Uncle John, particularly after I got back to London and could see him more often.”
Sherlock smiled shyly and wrapped his other arm around John’s upper arm, both of his grips comfortably tight. John took a moment to survey him before going down – skin a delightful pink, no obvious bleeding or broken skin, one of his stockings rolled halfway down his leg, and an expression of complete contentment on his face despite being covered in come with his cock hanging out – and straightened, grinning in pride. Regardless of whatever performance they gave, Sherlock was clearly pleased and content, and that’s what mattered most to John.
“Why would I need to turn off my phone?  Which isn’t going to happen, by the way, particularly since you won’t tell me what’s going to happen so I at least have some clue about what I’m getting into.”
“Just one more thing.”  John’s eyes roved over Sherlock’s questioning face thoroughly before his hand shot out to grab his in a tight grip.  Sherlock blinked in shock, but didn’t release his hand or move away.  If anything, he returned John’s grip with an even fiercer one.  “Did she…was she part of the group that killed my parents?”
“You stay put, I’ve got it.”  John rose and took her up in his arms, swaying her and shushing in her ear.  When her tears stopped, he moved to the changing table and grabbed Sherlock’s tea to hand it to him.  “Drink that and don’t move while I change her.  We’ve got something we need to discuss.”
“Dull,” Sherlock repeated, raising his head only long enough to grunt at Mrs. Hudson’s offering.  “Group of idiotic admirers of his attempting to bring back his ghost, simply a matter of tracking the whole lot down.  Though I admit I was impressed by how far their reach had gotten before they made their move, it’s hardly surprising.  My brother ought to have expected as much if he truly was paying attention.”
With a nod and a wave, John turned about and reentered the Leaky Cauldron, a mixed feeling of anxiety and fear running through him as he faced back into his past.
Eventually John pulled the door open, not meeting Greg’s eyes as he immediately went to sit on the edge of the bed.  Greg hovered in the doorway, not sure whether he should join him before steeling himself and entering.  He left a large enough space between them so that he had time to duck should John take a swing at him, but he hoped it wouldn’t come to that.
Sherlock shrugged, stirring his tea bag around in the mug.  “I…wanted to make sure she would be okay.  It was her first night in a new room and I didn’t want her to feel as though she was alone.”
“Right.  AGRA.  Yeah.”  John continued to turn the pages at a slightly more sedate pace until he found the As.  They scanned down the listings of names, Sherlock’s view upside down from his position, until John shot out a shaking hand to point at a single line.  His voice started strong as he read, but eventually lowered into barely a whisper.  “The eldest son, Alexander Christophe Avery Jr., was the only of the couple’s four children to attend Hogwarts.  The others, beginning with their only daughter Abigail Grace Regan Avery, attended Durmstrang Academy.”  John straightened to stare into the distance, his eyes lost.  “Durmstrang.  That would explain why we’ve never heard of her.”
“Would this be the home of Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson?” the woman asked, her voice as strong as her bearing.
Her face lit up and she let out a squeal of excitement.  John glanced around nervously and hushed her, smiling apologetically to the gentleman who was at the table across from them.  The man frowned briefly, but was soon immersed back in his book.  Jane, meanwhile, had started colouring across the top of the page, mumbling the Peppa Pig intro to herself as she did.  Her expression was focused as she sorted through the crayons for the right ones, scribbling with a determined precision that reminded John of her mum.  While she was busy, John wracked his brain in an attempt to think of other ideas for her letter, but found himself suddenly distracted.
Sherlock and Mycroft return to Baker Street with their answer.  After a quiet day together, Sherlock shares the discovery with John and comes to terms with it.
Without looking, John felt around for his chair until he found the arm and sat down on it heavily.  “Right.  So you’re a wizard too?”
“Where shall we try first?” Sherlock asked Cecelia, holding her hand as she skipped along next to him down the corridor.  A few weeks after the incident with Doyle, Sherlock decided to take a break from his so far failing experiments with magic and technology.  The school had finally settled into the normal flow of another year, the excitement of their return after summer break finally fading.  Sherlock hoped that the settling into normalcy would allow the two of them a better opportunity to find a professor willing to let them sit in during class.  He already knew that transfiguration would unfortunately be out of the question; while he had started to leave Sherlock alone after their incident in the library, Sherlock still refused to trust Doyle.  The expressions he sent Sherlock’s way, even occasionally watching Cecelia with an odd sort of hunger that made Sherlock want to destroy him, during meals and if they met in the corridors were enough to ensure he never sought him out intentionally.
“Of course.  If nothing else, he will be put on immediate disciplinary leave until the matter has concluded.  I’m sure that Harry will want to talk to you both, but there is more than enough to keep him busy for a little while before that is necessary.  You most likely would like to get Sherlock back to the wing to check him over properly for injuries first, however.”
Sherlock’s chest rose and fell in deep gasps as John sucked lightly and pulled away to brace his forehead against Sherlock’s groin.  He buried his nose into the dark curls there and yanked at his own fly, attempting to steady his desperate fingers.  Once Sherlock realized what he was doing, he lowered a hand to card through John’s hair, scratching at his scalp in silent encouragement.  John whined and caught a small bit of tender skin between his teeth, carefully mouthing at the still trembling muscles of Sherlock’s pelvis as he worked himself to completion.  After half a dozen more pulls at his cock, he came across the floor with a muffled cry.
“In a minute.  Right now I just want to hold you.”  Humming in agreement, Sherlock closed his eyes again and simply listened to the even sounds of John’s breathing.
“Holy shit, she’s magic.”  John turned back to Sherlock, his face broken out in an enormous grin.  “Jesus, Sherlock – she’s showing signs of magic!  Cecelia’s got it too!”
Sherlock frowned and set his palm across John’s fingers.  “How many people did you have to lose before we met?”
“Are we enjoying ourselves, baby brother?” Mycroft inquired, his voice smooth and completely lacking in any sign genuine curiosity.  Sherlock huffed and snatched the pen from his teeth, eyes still glued to the computer screen.
“Time for cake!” Sherlock declared loudly enough to carry through the kitchen and into the sitting room.  John laughed as he was pulled along, glancing over his shoulder at Greg.  He watched as the previous tension hardening his face finally faded into his normal weathered expression.  They nodded a final time to one another before finally rejoining the rest of the group to celebrate.
The one that catches at our souls
“All taken care of, for a bit at least.  I’ve got Thompson getting her to Albus and Scorpius right now.”
Neither chose to speak for several minutes, instead opting to stare down at the lettering on the graves at their feet.  The matching death dates, exactly eighteen years before, seemed to shine out from the material more prominently than anything else.  Eventually Harry squatted down on creaking ankles, balancing herself on the balls of her feet as she reached out a hand to trace the numbers in the carved stone.
They continued for another few minutes, Sherlock leading with John lighting the way.  Eventually they trudged through a tiny clearing, hardly large enough to be considered more than a break in the trees.  Sherlock’s head darted about like a dog on the hunt searching out his prey as he surveyed the area.  He gave a decisive nod and dragged John back into the undergrowth, nearly tripping him as he pulled him down to kneel on the spongy grass below.  John considered asking questions about what exactly they were getting into here, but a glance at the focused expression on Sherlock’s face told him the man was in his mind palace.  He took the moment to watch him in the near darkness, only part of his face visible in the bits of starlight fighting their way through the branches.  The lack of light only helped to accentuate the sharp dips and curves of his face, and the slight twitches across his skin as he thought danced in the beams.  John noticed the signs of Sherlock returning to the present in enough time to school his expression into thoughtful consideration, so that when he turned to glance at John he was simply studying the clearing silently.
While Sherlock researches, John panics. Their first evening of the exhibit arrives and they receive their first disturbing message from their suspect.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at the mention of Snape’s name.  “You’re the former Potions master.  From what I’ve read, your skill at the craft was unmatched at the time and continues to be so.  I admit, of all the classes available for study here, Potions intrigued me the most.”
When John came back around to Sherlock’s front, his grin grew even larger at what he saw. Sherlock’s mouth hung open as he panted heavily, a fine sheen of sweat on his skin. His cock had come to full hardness during the binding, its shape clear where the ropes pulled his pants tight around it. John adjusted the four diamonds on his front that the ropes created, framing them down the centre of his chest. The most attention he paid to Sherlock’s cock for the time being was to make sure the crushed sides of his pants sat properly under the rope to prevent chaffing around his groin. As for the rest of Sherlock’s upper half, John left it as it was to turn the skin a pleasing red where the rope rubbed against him as he moved.
“You will always have a place at Baker Street, John Watson.”  He laid one hand on John’s waist and the other on Cecelia’s head, eyes darting between the two faces that looked up at him.  “Both of you.”
Sherlock regained his composure shockingly quickly, rising to his feet and snatching up his corset and heels. “Lestrade. Yes. I assume you caught him in the act?”
The smile on John’s face quickly slid away to be replaced with a furrowed brow and a small frown.  “Yeah.  The most they’ve got is the fact that someone involved is a metamorphmagus, plus the wand and two wizards we managed to catch.  I hate to ask, but do you have any idea of who the metamorphmagus might be?”
John and Harry returned together later that night, both looking drained but otherwise unscathed.  Ginny led them into the kitchen where she and Sherlock had spent most of the afternoon together.  The two got on surprisingly well, Ginny talking just enough and about the right sorts of subjects to keep Sherlock engaged and distracted.  He even helped her to prepare dinner, Cecelia strapped across his chest as he moved through the kitchen with ease, though Sherlock make her promise not to tell John.  They’d been chatting about some of Sherlock’s cases when the familiar popping of Apparation came from the living room and Harry called out.
“I’m sorry I could not do more,” Snape replied, watching the pair with a thoughtful expression.  “If I can think of anything that might be of use, I will of course contact you immediately.”
“Harry helped me find it,” Sherlock said suddenly from a chair nearby, causing John to jump.  “It’s an aromatherapy rice pack.  Normally one would warm it in a microwave, but Harry talked me through a fairly basic heating charm.  I’ve had to reset it a few times since you fell asleep, but it seems to be holding the heat fairly well now.”
I'd apologize for the cliffhanger ending but y'all are about to get roughly 6000 words of smut after this so.
“John, hold on.  She’s a metamorphmagus…is there any way she could be involved…in the murders?  The ones that just so happened to start popping back up?”  John’s eyes flew up to Teddy’s, an expression of mixed disgust and horror etched in the faint lines of his face.  “Yeah, sorry, no, I just…it’s probably a coincidence – “
“What’s that? It’s not your dirty clothes from yesterday – you conveniently left them on the bathroom floor for me to collect.”
McGonagall pulled John into a hug before doing the same to a startled Sherlock.  Before releasing him, she pulled his ear down to whisper into it with a stern yet warm tone.  “You take care of our John, Mr. Holmes.  And don’t let him slip away from us this time.”
“To be fair, I did play a bit of rugby before going to Hogwarts and when I was at uni to become a Muggle doctor.”  When John glanced up, he noticed that Cecelia and the boys had finished opening their presents.  “Hey
John groaned and scrubbed a hand across his face.  “You love the fact that you’re making this difficult, don’t you?” he asked, flopping down so that his face rested against Sherlock’s stomach.  Sherlock grinned smugly down at him and reached out to pet his head.
“You can never start teaching children too early,” Sherlock declared.  “But I’ll make sure I’ve perfected whatever I show her before doing so and take all necessary precautions.”
“Yeah, their team’s rubbish this year,” Scorpius added.  When John raised an eyebrow at him, he winced.  “I mean…I don’t know much about Quidditch, but I know you need to score points to win.”
Once finished, John’s back straightened into military rest and he cleared his throat, sniffling the touch of tears from the back of it.  Without looking over to see if Harry noticed, he spun and began walking away, his stride steady.  The scuffling of her boots on the grass told him she had followed, and he clenched his eyes shut in a fight for control over her inevitable tirade.
“Understandable – I’ve only got older books, ones that were available when I was still a part of the wizarding world.  I imagine if I’d found you something more recent, there would be mentions of her.  She and her husband Remus were a huge part of the resistance.  But her dad was a Muggle and Tonks was her surname, so you wouldn’t have found it anywhere.  Her mother was a Black, if that rings a bell.”
By the end of his short speech, John couldn't help the slight grin at his lips. He shook his head and glared up at Sherlock. "All right, fine, but it's under my conditions. You stay behind me at all times, let me put up at least a basic shield around you, and you do not use the wand unless absolutely necessary. That means as defense only, Sherlock, got it? I'm not going to have you try something too advanced and blowing us all up to hell."
“Of course.  I’ll open my Floo up to accept yours.”
Havens was screeching his innocence when Harry snatched up his wand, pointing it at his wand that was held by one of the other Aurors with an indistinguishable mutter.  A long, silvery stream of spells emitted from it, but none that could have etched the words into Yaxley’s forehead or killed him.  Harry did the same to Faulkner’s wand with the same result.
“The fact that you can still spew that shit at two a.m. after what we’ve been through tonight…”  John’s sigh evolved into a chuckle and he started pushing Sherlock towards his bedroom.  “Right then, come on, off with you.  No way to know if it was dream until you go to bed and nothing you can do about it if it is.”   Sherlock fell over his book strewn bed and awkwardly climbed under the covers.  John was just about to leave when Sherlock’s hand shot out to stop him.
John set a harsh pace, the only thing slicking his way Sherlock’s strongly weeping cock. Sherlock couldn’t keep his hands still, grabbing at whatever parts of John he could reach as he pushed into John’s fist. John had a firm grip on Sherlock’s arse, relishing every flex of movement as Sherlock sought his release. His nails accidentally scratched the gem of the plug and John growled, moving his hand impossibly faster. It only took the work of a few minutes before he was coming mostly on his own chest, John’s name pushing out from between his lips in warning. John guided him through the orgasm, peppering kisses across his neck and shoulder to keep the praises he wished to bestow on him in check. Once Sherlock blinked back into awareness, John helped guide his legs carefully back to the floor.
“Christ, John, it’s fine, we’re fine, just.”  Sherlock griped his arse and attempted to pull him in by force.  “Would you please, for the love of God, just fuck me?!”
Finally, John and Sherlock talk.
“Oh John, it’s so good to have you back,” Mrs. Hudson said as John set Sherlock’s tea on the side table next to him.  Sherlock smiled up at him in thanks before turning his attention back to Cecelia.  “And having Cecelia here all the time will be lovely.  Sherlock’s been so excited, he’s done such a wonderful job at making sure you both would be comfortable when you arrived.”
“John!  Sherlock!”  Harry set his glass aside to come shake their hands.  The woman stood at Harry’s exclamation, Ron’s hand trailing down her back as she moved.
Sherlock offered the arm without protest, his interest apparently strong enough that it beat out the willfulness of his nature.  In an automatic move that came from having his wand in his hand, John summoned his medic bag with a casual flick, sorting through it for some supplies to clean the area before inspecting it.  It was a bit deeper than it originally appeared, but wouldn’t have any lasting damages.  John healed the outside with a quick, “Episky,” that nearly caused Sherlock to launch off the couch in alarm.
Sherlock pulled him fully into a hug, tucking John’s head under his chin.  “If they’re anything like Harry or Ron, I’m certain that everything will be fine.  I’ll be here with you the entire time regardless.”
“To be fair, this is the first time I’ve ever heard anything about it,” James cut in, turning to Mycroft.  “Why didn’t you tell me, darling?”
As he approached their door, John caught Sherlock’s low voice speaking from somewhere in the living room and mentally groaned. Hoping he had just been caught talking to the skull and not a potential client, he pushed his way inside and let out a bark of surprised laughter.
When he brought the monitor into the bedroom with him, he assumed that Sherlock would come down shortly.  He lay down so that he was facing it on its spot on the bedside table.  Sherlock’s voice, fuzzy from speaking over the monitor, spoke almost constantly, the rhythmic creaking of the chair just below it.  When John heard his name, he shot up to lean on his elbow, pulling the monitor closer and increasing the volume.
“Perfect,” John muttered, covering half of his face to scrub at it with his hand.  “I mean, it was starting to sound like this was the case, but…Jesus, this is hard.  I don’t even love her anymore, but it’s still too bloody hard.”
Easily finding the small clasps along the front hidden by the buckles, John quickly unfastened Sherlock’s corset and tossed it aside. Sherlock worked at John’s jacket, his lips making their way across every inch of bare skin as it was revealed. John fought to take in a full breath, the slight sting in his chest as he gasped surprisingly arousing. He reached around to grab two solid handfuls of Sherlock’s arse and squeezed, pulling him forward to slam their hips together. Sherlock pulled up from John’s shoulder with a gasp at the movement, throwing his head back to thrust his front against John.
The rest of the week went similarly, with the two of them flopping into bed at night exhausted and interruptions stopping them from getting any further than disappointed denial.  When John woke on Friday, it was to an empty bed for the first time in days and a strange tapping at the window.  He blinked around trying to figure out the noise’s source and soon spotted an odd shape outside.  Creeping quietly out of bed and grasping his wand, he approached the window with careful steps.
Sherlock cocked his head at the comment.  “Making me out to be a future dark lord, are we, John?”
“I’m loathe to leave her behind,” Sherlock breathed out with a frustrated huff.  He knelt forward to place a soft kiss on her forehead.  “I know she’ll be safest here, but I hate having her out of sight.”
Written in a vaguely familiar scrawl, a single sentence was scratched on the parchment.
Sherlock shrugged and slouched down further against the lower part of his chair, tangling their outstretched legs together.  “A month?  Two?  I can’t remember anymore.  I did the ceiling last, obviously, after we got back from Hogwarts.  I’ve worked on it whenever I’ve had the chance to between cases.”
Mary shot him an understanding smile.  “Go on and get dressed while I get Cecy settled.  We’ll head out to the spot whenever you’re ready.  We’ve got time.”
Just as Sherlock was sneaking his hands down towards the clasps of John’s corset, a storm of footsteps raced up the stairs. The audience turned as one to see what caused the commotion and John instinctively tried to move Sherlock behind him. The room gaped up at Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade, who spotted John and Sherlock quickly. He started toward them and seemed to realise what he interrupted. His face turned beet red and he raised his eyes to avoid looking at the pair. He glanced up at the mirror on the ceiling and groaned, burying his face in his hands.
Giving a sniff, Sherlock rejected another book and moved to look at the ones lining the stairs.  “Hardly anyone is, John.  Thankfully, you don’t have to deal with dating idiots any longer.”
“If that is so, then there has been a serious breach in security at Hogwarts,” a low voice from beside Dumbledore’s portrait drawled.  Sherlock slowly turned to take in the sallow faced man who glared out at him.  “The Holmes boys are both Muggles.  You couldn’t even see Hogwarts, let alone walk through its halls.”
They were dressed in varying degrees of thoroughness, a handful of them obviously wearing clothes they brought themselves while others only chose a few of the available accessories from those provided. They began to mingle through the room, talking amongst themselves and picking at the food provided on the tables. John and Sherlock were forced to separate, although John found himself searching him out to check on him. Sherlock fell into the role fairly easily, however, immediately leaning his palms back onto a table and stretching out his long legs to cross them in front of him. A pair of men approached him moments later, immediately engaging him in an animated conversation. A crooked grin settled on his lips as he spoke to them, his posture remaining languid and open.
“John, look at me.”  Sherlock’s voice was low but stern, and John let out a sigh of acceptance before letting his blue eyes drift up to Sherlock’s own.  They were a dark blue in the semidarkness of the living room, similar in shade to John’s.
to, it’s more…it sounds ridiculous now, after all we’ve already done this week, but I didn’t want to do
“Um.  Okay.”  They headed toward the exit, John purposefully standing close.  As soon as they were outside, the man suddenly pulled to a stop and turned to face John.  “Oh!  I’m Sherlock.  Sherlock Holmes.”
“Tired,” Sherlock mumbled. He leaned forward and let his forehead bump into John’s stomach, rubbing his face against the ruffle of his shirt. John lifted his hand and, after a brief moment of hesitation, buried his fingers into Sherlock’s curls. He massaged his scalp and Sherlock practically melted against him, his shoulders finally losing the tension they held ever since they rejoined the group. Not for the first time that night, John wished they were in the privacy of their home, where he could simply tuck Sherlock into bed and hold him as he fell asleep. Thoughts of the case had completely left John’s mind through the entire evening, until he lifted his head and glanced across at the dressing table.
“Sorry,” John said, setting the shopping down and approaching Sherlock.  “It was raining like hell and I wasn’t prepared, and I didn’t want Cecelia to get drenched…”
“We can talk about it properly once Cecelia’s off to Jeannette’s; she and her mum should be coming by to get her soon.  We can sit down and discuss it together then.”
“Sounds good, and I’ll be fine.”  John glanced up at Sherlock, who was watching him intently.  “All set?  Hopefully this trip will go a bit more steadily than the last.”  Sherlock’s only response was to grip John’s arm tighter against his side.  John gave him a quick nod and the three Apparated away.
Sherlock quirked his lips and seamlessly waved the wand in the correct motion, stating in a clear voice, “Wingardium Leviosa!”  The book he pointed at shook and, for the first time since they’d started to practice, gradually rose into the air.  John heard Sherlock let out a gasp and his arm fell to his side in shock.  The book followed the motion, landing on the table with a thud that seemed as loud as an explosion in the quiet of the room.
“Effected by sudden, unexpected actions, triggered by emotional stimuli.”  Sherlock marched back into Teddy’s personal space, but this time it was expected.  His hair remained unchanged for the moment, but his eyes soon shifted to mimic Sherlock’s, a misty green that day.  “I suspect it takes a fairly long time to learn how to control the changes.”
Snape shook his head and John nearly broke Sherlock’s fingers from how tightly he held on.  “I’m afraid I do not know, John.  I was here at Hogwarts at the time and only had the chance to communicate with the Dark Lord occasionally.  If she was, it was nothing he saw fit to tell me.”
“I – “  Sherlock attempted to take a deep breath just as John nuzzled his face in where his fingers had been moments before.  His voice came out choked and garbled as the rest of his sentence stuck in his throat.  Leaning his arms back, he shakily set his mug out of reach and braced against the table, his eyes clenching shut as he shook his head.
“I understand it now,” Sherlock said suddenly, half to himself.  “You practice your skills at transfiguration to the point where you can completely alter your own appearance.  It had to be enough so that someone highly experienced at it, such as Minerva McGonagall, couldn’t see through it.  Once you had the position, most likely by removing the former professor in some permanent manner, it would be easy enough to convince Madam Pomfrey to leave for the year and encourage someone to suggest John as a replacement.  If you’ve been watching us, you know that Cecelia and I would come with him, leaving us easy prey for you to get to while John spent most of his time working.  The best way to get at John is to get at the two of us, which is why you spent the year tormenting me and have kidnapped Cecelia.”
John barked out a laugh and buried his face in Sherlock’s neck. “Seeing as I’ve mentioned my gorgeous roommate on a few live-streams, I think my followers would enjoy that too. You’re going to be an adventure, aren’t you?”
“That…wow.” John puffed out a breath and finally lifted his gaze to meet Sherlock’s, noticing his arched brow. “You look…is all that your stuff or Niall’s?”
“Roller bath bomb and Monsieur Gustave bath oil,” Sherlock moaned, sinking deeper into the water to get himself closer to John.  “I thought you might like them.”  Soon only half of his face, from his nose to the top of his hair, remained above the water, the longer curls at the base of his skull drifting under the purple swirls.  Unable to resist touching him more, John shifted around until they were on the same side of the tub, Sherlock’s back against John’s front.  He encouraged Sherlock to rest his head on his shoulder so that he could properly run his hands along his body, rubbing the oil into Sherlock’s skin.  Sherlock purred deep in his chest and writhed into John’s touch, eventually settling enough for John to do what he wished.
“I know.  If you don’t mind my non-professional opinion, though, I really do think it could help, probably for more than even just this.  It did a lot for me when I finally agreed to give it a shot.”
“Caught us and Cecelia at it, apparently.”  John laughed again and ran his hand up and down Sherlock’s back.  “I suppose we really are rubbish at the whole secrecy thing, particularly when we’re here at home.”
Instantly Sherlock headed for the racks of clothing, flipping through them quickly and silently. John watched him in silence, happy to let Sherlock take the lead after last night. He found whatever it was he was looking for and thrust it behind him without looking for John to take. Shaking it out, John studied it and his eyebrows rose in slight surprise. The waistcoat was worn, skillfully patched in a few places and artfully torn in others. The clasps on the front had dull bronze gears instead of buttons and the neckline dipped low, almost to the top of John’s abs. Wide lapels on both sides spread it out further, revealing a large portion of the chest of whoever wore it. It would be tight on John’s broad shoulders, but he suspected that was an intentional choice on Sherlock’s part.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, his eyes wide and his voice nearly gone.  He stared out beyond John’s shoulder, causing John to bolt around and gasp.
Never remembering the stoic nights
Various versions of our past selves,
“You’re too good to me, John Watson,” Sherlock sighed, leaning forward to place a small kiss on his lips.  “What can I do to repay you?”
*walks in multiple months later with Starbucks and an ancient meme* Hey there all, I'm still alive.  Sorry this has taken ages, I've been working on a couple of things and depression is a real bitch.  Hopefully this mainly cute Sherlock and Cecelia bonding chapter on Harry and Jo's birthday will make up for it.
“That’s fantastic!”  John had thought Lestrade looked as though he had been itching to share something with him the last time both he and Sherlock were at a crime scene together.  He assumed that Lestrade had wanted to wait until John’s own life settled down more before sharing the news, but he was thrilled to find out that they were getting on so well.  The two of them danced around each other almost as long as he and Sherlock, and they finally got themselves sorted out not long after Cecelia was born.  Since then, both of them were the happiest John had ever seen them.  He wouldn’t be surprised if they ended up engaged by the end of the year at the rate they were going.
“Just fine, to all of it,” John replied.  He shot Sherlock a look, attempting to silently ask him if they knew about the change in their relationship, but Sherlock’s face remained blank.  John shrugged it off for the time being and continued.  “Sherlock’s found something that…ah, we wanted to discuss with you, specifically Mrs. Holmes.”
It was Sherlock’s turn to shut his eyes, a tear escaping where John barely contained his own.  He took a deep breath and, when he looked back at John, a new fierceness was set in his gaze.  “I need to keep going, John.  I can’t properly explain it, but something tells me that if we don’t find her now, just the two of us, we never will.  If we let Doyle get away, we won’t be able to find him or Cecelia again.”
“Because
“Holmes!” the worker called, and the man’s head shot up.  He glanced at John and stood, John copying him.
Sherlock bristled at the comment, but he relaxed slightly when John rubbed the small of his back.  Breathing out a small sigh, Sherlock replied, “Yes.  Will you be able to find me a wand?”
As soon as the wand was in his hand, Sherlock felt it radiating a soft warmth.  He gaped down at it, momentarily stunned by the tingling he felt in his fingers, and at last waved it in a wide arc in front of him.  A trail of silver stars, sparkling like miniature fireworks, followed in the wake of the motion.  His face lit up in an instant, delighted grin as they shimmered before him, blinking out one by one.
Glancing around at the festive decorations that included a small artificial Christmas tree on a table covered in homemade ornaments and a menorah on a shelf with electric lights, John nodded and squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder without thinking about it.  Sherlock blinked a few times at the motion but otherwise said nothing.  “I can tell,” John muttered, letting his hand rest on the swell of Sherlock’s shoulder blade.  He finally realized what he was doing when his thumb absentmindedly rubbed against the soft fabric of Sherlock’s navy jumper.  His hand shot up and he rubbed his palms into his jeans, attempting to cover the fact that his skin was tingling from the contact.  He cleared his throat and nodded his chin at the room.  “So, ah, what would you like me to do?”
John laughed breathlessly and kissed him fiercely.  “You are.  C’mon, let’s pick up our things and head home.  Time to start doing this magic thing for real, yeah?”
“Vatican cameos,” he replied. “Although I’m sure Niall wouldn’t mind if we simply spoke openly during the act itself, but a safe word would be a more subtle method. I’m confident that you would never do anything to harm me, but the mind is unpredictable in the throes of passion. Having a phrase would allow us both something to focus on just in case of emergency, both in here and the performance area.”
“Just came – “John gasped, thrusting Sherlock the note and bending down to clutch at his knees as he heaved in breaths.  “It’s from Harry.  Something’s happened.”
“Okay, you monsters, enough!”  Though a fairly unassuming woman in stature, their mother commanded the room to silence with the boom of her shout.  The three children immediately fell silent, all gazing up at her with expectant and eager faces.  “Lily, you’re more than welcome to go over to see Rose and Hugo as long as Aunt Hermione has said it’s okay.  Al, I’ll clean up your book in just a moment, even though I’ve seen you spilling tea on the thing more times than I can remember.  And James, he’s off to London for work, but I don’t know how long he’ll be gone.  If I get a chance, I’ll show you some moves myself.  You’re built more like a Chaser than a Seeker anyway.”  She stared at each of them in turn before making a shooing motion with her hands.  “Well, off with you all, then!  I have things here to take care of!”
“Why don’t you just get to the point and ask me what you really want to know, John,” he snapped back, finally throwing down his book and staring directly at John.  “Your attempts at subtlety are growing increasingly more tedious.”
Though John knew it probably wasn’t a wise idea, he tucked his book behind him and shuffled to the end of his seat to peer around at the man.  He had pulled his knees even closer into his chest, wrapping his long arms around them, and glared daggers out the window.  Clearing his throat, John waited until he turned his glare on John before shooting him a crooked grin.  “Heading home?”
Both of the Aurors were shaking their heads in the negative, but a gravelly voice from the cell on the left caused them to freeze.  “Of course they wouldn’t tell you if they noticed anything, not when it was one of them that did the thing.”
“I’m just going to check up on Cecelia!” he called, already out into the hall from the side door and partially up the stairs.  “Make yourself comfortable, I’ll be down once I’m done!”
“Definitely.”  John broke away and glanced around the room wistfully.  “Well, do you think we’ve got everything?  I mean, if we haven’t, you could always pop back through the Floo – I’ve already worked it out with Professor McGonagall to connect this fireplace to the one in our new quarters.”
“Never mind, Neville, we’ll be off,” Sherlock sniffed.  “Perhaps another professor would be willing to have our participation in one of their classes instead.  Come along, Cecelia.”  Before Neville could respond, Sherlock guided Cecelia back up the path toward the castle.  Shaking his head after them, Neville returned to bring order to his class.
“Let’s just say we’re an incredibly exclusive programme, and have been lucky enough to find a few very willing sponsors.” With a wink, he twirled around to gesture at the room at large. “Right, we’ll start down in the meeting room with you two waiting for everyone to arrive. They’ll have about a half an hour to decide on the sort of storyline they’d like to follow for the evening and to complete their outfits. Once they’re done, they’ll join you in the meeting room for an hour of story building where the two of you will not be allowed to interact with each other whatsoever. I know that’ll make solving the case a bit more challenging, but it’s been the policy from the start and would be suspicious if we suddenly stopped now. You can mingle with whoever else you’d like otherwise, just follow their leads in regard to developing the back story. After the hour’s up, everyone will come up here for the grand performance. You can move whatever items in here you think you might need ahead of time and, as I’ve said before, the audience isn’t allowed any sort of interaction with the scene, including making noises or performing sexual acts themselves. You can take as long or little time as you’d like. Once you’re finished, everyone will return to the meeting room for another hour of mingling before the evening is complete. The rules from before will still apply, but keep in mind that you’ll be returning to the group in whatever state you end the act in as part of the full performance.”
John left him to read in peace and went to give the flat a quick clean.  Sherlock was still engrossed in his book by the time he finished, so John sat cross-legged on the floor with Cecelia, content to amuse her until Sherlock was finished.  He cast a series of bubbles in the air, causing her to shriek and attempt to catch them.  The three of them sat in contented silence for quite some time, each at ease in their individual tasks.
Sherlock finished cleaning up the changing table and glanced over the parchment.  “Oh.  Um.  Excellent.  I suppose.”
“Oye, those are my people you’re mocking.  And you can’t just judge your ideas on the House from Hogwarts, a History.”  John quickly finished his meal and set the empty plate aside.  “Hufflepuff is about acceptance, sure, but it’s more complicated than that.  There’s a focus on loyalty, on sticking to what you believe in and standing behind your friends when they need you.  It’s not giving up just because of what others might say or because it’s too hard – quiet dedication, I suppose, or doing a thing because it’s right rather than for the attention.  We favour putting your all into whatever you do, whether you succeed or not, rather than who makes the most noise while doing it or managing to get it done the fastest or best way.  We give everyone a shot.”
“Mycroft, please.”  He sat and glanced between John and James.  “Why do I suspect I am about to be subjected to some sort of intervention?  I must admit, this is not what I expected when you asked to meet, John.”
“Just grand,” he muttered at the driver before returning his attention to Sherlock.  He gaped down at the screen, barely believing the fact that it read twelve new messages.
Sherlock’s nose crinkled in thought before he nodded.  “I stand corrected; that fits you quite well.  I suspect I myself would be in either Ravenclaw or Slytherin.”
Six years after the events in Dissendium, John is offered a temporary position as the Healer at Hogwarts. Sherlock and Cecelia join him and have to adjust to living in the wizarding world. Doyle, the new Transfiguration professor, takes an interest in Sherlock and when Sherlock repeatedly turns him down, their interactions turn physical. John, meanwhile, makes multiple attempts at proposing, all of them getting interrupted before he has the chance to follow through. In the most recent chapter, Doyle physically assaulted Sherlock in a dungeon hallway and John arrived in time to stop it, leading to Doyle being taken into custody by Aurors.
“Of course, John.”  His face turned scandalized at the thought.  “I would never put Cecelia at risk, you know that.”
“Very nice, Jane.  What else?  There’s got to be some other things Mum hasn’t let have before now that you’d like.”
“Oh my God, you really are a romantic, aren’t you?”  John cleared his throat to get rid of the lump in it and pulled him forward to kiss him hard.  Sherlock melted into his touch, each of them still holding a rose between them.  John hummed and nibbled at Sherlock’s bottom lip, causing him to groan.  He pulled away to look up into his face, appreciating the pink flush in his cheekbones and his closed eyes.  He waited for Sherlock to blink his eyes open and waved his rose toward the wine.  “We just gonna look at that or actually enjoy it?”
“Sorry, Mr. Flitwick!” Cecelia said while Sherlock muttered his own apology.  They managed to remain quiet as Flitwick taught for a few more minutes before Cecelia began squirming in Sherlock’s lap.  She seemed to be staring intently up at the front of the class, but not at Flitwick specifically.  Rather, she stared down one of the extra pieces of chalk further down on the board.  Once Sherlock realised what she was doing, he began to whisper encouragements into her ear.  As the chalk began to teeter on its spot, Sherlock’s whispers grew louder and the students’ focus turned from Flitwick to the flickering chalk.  With a bit of concentration, Cecelia managed to lift the chalk and bring it shooting across the room.  Sherlock raised his hand to snatch it out of the air just as Flitwick turned to gape at them.
“Ah, no, sorry Sherlock, I’m afraid not,” John said smoothly, setting down the tea things and snatching the wand up.  “At least not without a bit of background.  Now give me your arm.”
“Various Aurors who caught the individuals in the act said one of the wizards changed his or her appearance half a dozen times before escaping.  They dropped their wand at the scene, so it was nearly impossible for them to transfigure themselves, particularly in such rapid succession.  Harry suspects the sudden arrival of the authorities resulted in the wizard panicking and briefly losing control of their skill.”
“Not your fault, love,” John replied.  They laid in silence for several long minutes simply clutching each other close, until Cecelia started to stir over the monitor.  John pulled them both into a sitting position and kissed Sherlock briefly.  “No lie-ins for the weary, it seems.”
“Finley,” he said with a nod as he sat and passed Sherlock his drink.  “Done with work for the day?”
Sherlock’s eyes lit up as Cecelia handed the album back to him.  “Would these practices involve the old workout gear as well?”
“Do different sorts of clothing have various meanings?” he asked one as he crawled about them, studying them from different angles.  “I imagine a shirt or trousers would mean more than a pair of socks, for example.”
John and Sherlock waited for the guests in silence, John trying not to stare at Sherlock too much. On one of his glances, he caught Sherlock staring back and smiled to himself. Sherlock may claim that relationships weren’t his area, but clearly he could appreciate when John was looking particularly good. Soon the door to the next room opened and a small crowd of black and white clad audience members joined them.
Before John could come up with a reply, Sherlock interrupted. “Old family heirloom. Thought it would go well with the theme so I brought it along. It must remind you of some of the other pieces; it’s very similar in design.” Niall frowned, but nodded and left to go help the audience prepare. John turned to Sherlock with a raised eyebrow once they were alone.
for requesting this particular AU.
“Investigate…Sherlock, are you trying to take up the case of my parents’ deaths?”
John placed a hand on his bicep and attempted to offer him a reassuring smile.  “Just let him talk, yeah?  For me?”
“The only other wizards I’ve met are the extended Potter and Weasley families,” Sherlock replied quietly.”  He watched the portraits shift in their frames on the walls rather than meet John’s eyes.  “I’m concerned about their reactions when they learn I’ve only been studying magic for a few years.”
Pushing his fringe out of his eyes, John glanced around in search of a table tucked out of the way.  Before he could find one, however, he noticed a familiar face motioning him over.
“Animals and people and creatures and things,” she continued, growing even louder in her excitement.  “But if you wanna move it, you can summon something they have on or are holding and it almost works the same.”
To share more than a hello.
, round and a shiny gold with a large silver gear in the middle. He must have put the plug in while they were at home and John bit his lips to stop himself from burying his face in his bum at the thought of Sherlock making the trip to the studio with it shoved into him. Instead, he lifted his hands to seize his cheeks in his palms, pushing them together to watch the gem shift deeper into him. He heard Sherlock gasp and fumble with John’s holster and huffed out a small laugh of satisfaction.
“Actually, we’ve a reservation for lunch, so the government will have to wait,” James said, facing John and Sherlock but eyeing Mycroft from the corner of his eye.  “Until then, they can take care of themselves.  I’ve got to make sure this one’s taken care of since he doesn’t see fit to do it himself.”
“I actually only know maybe one other, to be honest,” Teddy said with an apologetic smile.  “There’s a kid at Hogwarts who’s a metamorphmagus, a couple of years below me.  Nice kid, Hufflepuff, quiet, keeps to himself mostly.  I can’t imagine a thirteen-year-old is involved in this, though, and he obviously didn’t have anything to do with your parents.”
Sherlock pouted briefly but followed John’s command, heading in the direction he led.  Harry and Mycroft popped up behind them and immediately began to follow.  The pathway to Hogwarts was dark, not used to having travelers to or from the school so late at night, but the glow of Harry and John’s wands lit it well enough for their small group.  They remained silent the entire way, Sherlock attempting to stare through the gloom of their surroundings and John hardly awake enough to move.  Soon the castle’s dully outlined form loomed over them as they approached the pair of giant front doors.
The room turned silent when they made their way downstairs, everyone stopping their conversations to turn and stare. Most of their attention was on Sherlock in particular, and John could tell he was blushing from the heat radiating off him. He squeezed his hand and Sherlock lifted his head enough to meet John’s eyes. He echoed the grin John shot at him and readily followed as John guided him back into the centre of the room.
John sighed and rubbed at the back of his neck.  “Look, Sherlock, if you don’t want to share a bed, that’s fine.  I can figure something out in Cecelia’s room if necessary.  But I just figured…well, with how things have been…I just thought that was what you wanted, but I guess I shouldn’t have assumed anything without asking first.”
Taking the distraction for what it was, Sherlock followed John to their room. “I’ve eliminated two of the regulars. We’ll need to switch people tomorrow if possible; some of them were too attached to you for me to do more than observe them from afar.” He continued to speak as John approached the dressing table in their room. Where it once had been mostly empty except for a few brushes and random pieces of jewelry, now there sat a folded note that reminded John of the one the women had found the week before.
Nodding vigorously, Sherlock laid back and helped John lean forward to rid himself of the rest of his clothing.  John moved purposefully slowly to drape himself over Sherlock, savouring each new meeting of bare flesh.  Once his body was sprawled completely across Sherlock’s, they both took a moment to simply feel each other, Sherlock’s arms coming up to wrap around John’s back.  John kissed down Sherlock’s neck, sucking at his shoulder when he reached it, and when he shuffled to get his lips lower, they both gasped at the contact between their cocks.
, the same gold as his buttons with heavy looking gears dangling slightly below the clamps themselves. The skin around his nipples already looked flushed red, confirming that the gears were most likely even heavier than John first thought. Sherlock finished belting his own holster, already equipped with a fake gun on one side and rolled length of rope on the other, and moved to open his bag.
“More of the same,” Sherlock muttered, passing it over for John to read while he changed. The note alluded to the performance yesterday, continuing to extol John’s skills and Sherlock’s reaction. Clearly their letter writer enjoyed their performance thoroughly, and John was distracted halfway through reading by a mark in the lower right hand corner.
John chuckled wetly and shook his head.  “No, you berk.  I don’t care about the dust either.  I’m just…happy.”
When he opened the shop door, a great rush of spicy, warm air bombarded him.  He breathed it in deeply before glancing around to take in what they had to offer.  There was barely anything to it, just enough room in the front for a pair of chairs and a bench under the window before you reached the kitchen.  John nodded to the two men occupying the chairs and snatched up a menu, scanning it as he leaned an elbow against the counter.  One of the workers glanced up at him and he shot the man a smile, waving the menu to let him know that he had what he needed.  The man smiled back and returned to his work.
Cecelia wiggled herself more comfortably with her fathers, waiting for them to continue the story.  By the end of the chapter, her mouth hung slightly open as they carefully extracted themselves from under her and left her to sleep for the night.
James tilted his head and encouraged Mycroft to look back up at him.  “Let me try?  I would like to see if I can help you with this, Mycroft.”
When John pulled away slightly to catch his breath, Sherlock’s feet slid and he shifted down on the door.  His hands scrambled to grab at John’s shoulders and John caught him along his waist, giggling.  His eyes, formerly wide with lust and surprise, narrowed at John.
Kissing the top of her head, Sherlock straightened and took her hand.  “Thank you, bee.  Now, should we go see Professor Slughorn down in Potions?”
Barking out a laugh, John gave him an appreciative onceover. “Me either, but I’m not really complaining. Although I wouldn’t mind…less, if you’re interested. Normally I’d take you out first and woo you into bed, but we’re a bit past all that at this point. Unless.” He seemed to have a sudden realisation and loosened his hold on Sherlock. “Did you tell Lestrade when he should come to the exhibit tonight?”
Sighing, he rose to his feet and breezed down to Lestrade.  “By all means, your people are welcome to resume desecrating the crime scene.  I’ve gained everything I could for the time being.  What are their names?”
Cecelia giggled and handed him her bag.  “You’re very strong, Papa.  You wouldn’t be able to catch the bad guys if you weren’t.”
John nodded, distracted and thoughtful.  He felt both pairs of Holmes eyes watching him with diligence, so he moved away with a bleak smile and waved goodbye.  Harry and Mycroft slipped back out into the night, leaving John to observe in silence.  He was eventually brought out of his reverie by Neville’s voice.  “Come on, I’ll see you both settled.  We’ve actually got you down near the Hufflepuff common room – there was a spare classroom we were able to convert pretty easily and figured it’d be easiest for you to find, John.”  Sherlock trailed behind them as they chatted quietly, eyes darting about as they walked to observe what he could.  The corridors were fairly dull so late at night, the lamps lining the stone walls turned low.  Though he expected it from what he read, he still gave a start when he noticed movements from one of the portraits.  He began speaking lowly to the sleeping Cecelia, allowing his deep voice to bring her into a deeper sleep as he listed off his various observations as they went.  His voice carried just enough for John could hear, causing him to turn and smile slightly at the sight of Sherlock hunched over her dozing form.
“But Da!” she protested, pouting with her arms crossed.
“It’s fine, love, I don’t mind.”  John leaned up to kiss him on the cheek and nearly jumped from his chair when the door opened downstairs.  Sherlock squeezed his shoulder reassuringly one more time before straightening and turning just as Molly and Greg entered, Mrs. Hudson and her cake close behind.
“Hmm?  What was that, Sherlock?”  When he didn’t immediately reply, John turned away from the window to glance over at him.  He was hunched so far over his book that he was nearly bent in half, his mad curls obscuring his eyes.  John would have simply thought he was engrossed in his work if not for the fact that the hands griping the book’s cover were white and shaking from how fiercely he held on.  John stood and approached slowly, wary of startling him, and managed to kneel on one knee beside the chair so he could properly see Sherlock’s face.  His expressive brows were contorted in confusion as he stared down at the page, biting his lip in an oddly endearing manner.  “Sherlock?  You okay?  What did you find?”
By the time they returned a few hours later, Sherlock still hadn’t come back from wherever he’d run off to.  John set Cecelia up in her crib for a nap after giving her a quick change, where she fell asleep almost immediately.  Content that she would be settled for a while, he returned to the kitchen to take care of the groceries.  He considered his leftover unpacked bags, kneeling next to them in the sitting room with a groan once he was finished in the kitchen.  The only things that remained were John’s clothes and, given what had happened the evening before, he wasn’t entirely sure what to do with them at the moment.
“You are definitely too excited about snow,” he mumbled, scrubbing a hand along his scratchy jaw.  “Is it even enough out there to count as snow or are you having me on?  Trying to force me out of my nice, warm bed only to find out there’s barely enough to cover the ground?”
Sherlock’s lip twisted in thought. “Originally I wanted to use the pin tonight, but I think it might be best to save it for tomorrow. We’ll have to decide on a different theme for tonight first.”
"You too, Master Watson,” Scorpius replied, smiling at him shyly.  He shot Sherlock a glance before noticing Cecelia watching him with narrowed eyes.  Scorpius’ face lit up and he leaned against the table to hold his hand up flat in front of her.  She instantly broke out into a grin and high fived him with a loud smack.  When he noticed John and Sherlock watching them, he shrugged sheepishly.  “Albus told me Cecelia loves high fives and he taught me how.  It’s not something my family would really know much about.”
.”  He crossed his arms over his chest and attempted not to pout, but he knew his lips were twisted into an expression that would make Mycroft roll his eyes and tell him to stop acting like a child.
“Of course he did, of course he bloody did…” John muttered as he began to pace the width of the room from the end of one bed to another.  When he paused, it was to look up at Sherlock rather than Harry.  “What do we do now?”
“Oh,” Sherlock replied from the other end.  His breath rustled over the line as though he was pacing and John could sense his nervousness in his stilted words.  “Of course.  Sorry.”
“McGonagall.  I knew John well once – he was a student of mine when he was young.  The matter concerns the deaths of John’s parents; I am aware of just how close the two of you are, but this is not information I am willing to give up for anyone other than the man himself.”
“We should have a safe word in case either of us is uncomfortable with what’s happening during the scene,” he said. Surprisingly, Sherlock nodded his agreement readily.
Sherlock tucked his head under John’s chin, an awkward move while they were standing and with Cecelia in John’s other arm, but he somehow managed it.  “Not right now.  Can we go for a walk?  The three of us?”
“That’s what I thought,” John replied with enthusiasm.  “Honestly, it’s a miracle the place was that empty at that time of day so he didn’t see anything off.  Besides, he was on a case, so most of his focus was on that.  But what could have let him get in, then?  Could the charms be wearing off?”
of January.  The first day we met.”
John had calmed a bit by the time he had finished stowing away everything in its proper place.  He lost nearly all of his composure when he glanced across the room and spotted Sherlock.  While the tub filled, he had shed all of his clothes, leaving them strewn in a trail from the window to the tub’s side.  He stood with his back to John as he read the labels on the Lush bags, one of his feet absentmindedly curling up to rub his opposite ankle.  The balance required to pull off his position caused his back to curve faintly and his whole body to sway slightly.  Overhead, the chandelier let off a low light that warmed Sherlock’s pale skin into a soft golden glow.  The crisscrossing echoes of his time away showed in an even starker white and John felt a sweeping rush through his midsection.  Gratefulness and an accompanying wave of affection followed in its wake and his feet carried him to Sherlock’s side.
With each of Sherlock’s words, Snape’s interest grew, his portrait shifting a bit anxiously in his painted chair as though he physically itched to discuss more.  John chuckled and shook his head before turning to shoot Dumbledore a grin.  “I should have expected this, I suppose.  Naturally the mad scientist would get on with the ornery Potions Master.”
When Sherlock didn’t find anything of relevance in the offices, Niall guided them upstairs to explore the creative spaces. The actual exhibit took place over two separate floors, the first set up with a preparation area for the audience to choose their outfits for the evening and a common room for pre- and post-performance mingling. The few windows in the rooms were covered with a dark fabric draped over them to block out any outside light. Additional scarves and swaths of fabric covered all of the walls, artfully draped into dramatic shapes and covered in deep coloured designs that reminded John of fortune tellers in a travelling circus. The rough wooden floors had been covered with overlapping circular rugs with such fine detailing that, in the low light, made them look like a solid forest floor. In the front room, the light came from a single florescent fixture in the middle of the ceiling, illuminating the four dressing tables with mirrors and the many tables covered with assorted jewelry and clothes. A pair of corners held larger fabric dangling from the ceiling from a single peg, creating a more private dressing area for those who wished to fully immerse themselves with a full costume. Even from a quick once over of the room, John was able to spot the various discrete security cameras covering every area except the two dressing corners.
Sherlock remained quiet and stoic on the steps for a few seconds that felt like half a lifetime.  His mind raced through the conversation, storing away the significant information into their appropriate sections of his mind palace.  With a start, he returned to the present, realizing belatedly that his most recent object of intrigue had vacated the premises.  He bolted down the stairs to yank open the door, practically collapsing out onto the pavement and frantically shooting his head about for a glimpse of the distinct tartan.  He caught it just as McGonagall turned a corner not far down the street, surprisingly going down an alley that he knew held little more than a few empty trash bins.  He was dashing after her less than a second later, but when he entered the alley it was completely and utterly devoid of human life.  Sherlock felt his jaw drop open slightly, his wide eyes darting across the entirety of the space but finding nothing.  He took a few steps farther down the small space, noiseless as his bare feet trod across the grimy pavement.  Quickly regaining himself from his surprise, he began to assess the area, taking in possible escape routes.  The end of the alley stood blocked by a solid brick wall, newly renovated less than a year before from the solidity of the cement between the blocks.  To both the right and left were the walls of the buildings at each side, no windows or doors leading out to the small area.  From Sherlock’s careful assessment, there appeared to be only one way in or out, yet the space was undoubtedly empty.
In a single smooth move, Sherlock stood and spun to stand nose to nose with Teddy.  His hair abruptly flashed from John’s shade to a bright ginger red in his surprise, and Sherlock leapt backward at the sudden change.  From on his chest, Cecelia gave off a high-pitched giggle that brought John’s attention back to her.  “Come on, wee lassie, time to give your how do to young Ted.  He isn’t the only one who’s done some growing, hmm?”  John maneuvered her out of the wrap without Sherlock paying much attention, his focus completely centered on Teddy.  Teddy, meanwhile, broke off his stare with Sherlock at the appearance of Cecelia and reached his arms out eagerly for her.  With expert grace, he took her from John, allowing his hair to melt back into a dark brown.  The sight caused Cecelia to giggle once more and reach out a fist to snatch up a handful.
Eventually he got the car seat out, mostly by yanking it out behind him rather than following any set of official directions.  He heard a tiny burst of laughter and turned to grin up at Sherlock, who stood in the open door to 221.
Sherlock’s expression looked as wide eyed and shocked as John’s felt.  He had a rectangular shaped book propped open in his lap and he carefully turned the pages with a delicacy borne out of reverence.  Each page held between two and four photographs, many of them faded with rough edges but all of them perfectly clear.  Sherlock slid one of them out of its sleeve to look at it closer, his thumb rubbing the edge with a careful touch.
Sherlock’s hastened pace screeched to a halt the moment he entered the library.  He would always be able to appreciate being born in an age where information was easy to find with a mere point and click, but nothing truly compared to the crisp tang of thousands of worn books.  The added smell of ink and feather quills gave the entire scene an appropriately mystic element as Sherlock slowly made his way down the long aisles of books, his shoes echoing softly with each step.
– he had to forgo his trousers and shirt, leaving him striding through the flat in nothing but that fucking dressing gown and a pair of tight, dark pants that clung to him as well as one of his shirts.  Really, what came about as a result was no one’s fault but Sherlock’s own.
John lifted Sherlock’s chin so he could look him straight in the eyes, his worry still obvious.  “I’ve been neglecting you, haven’t I?”  Sherlock didn’t answer, but John could tell from his frown that he was right.  “Oh my love, I’m so sorry.  There’s been so much going on, between the holidays and Cecelia’s birthday, and then I started helping out the Hufflepuff team…oh Sherlock, you ought to have said something.  I never intended to make you feel like you weren’t just as important as all that, if not more so.”
“Nonsense, this way is far superior.  The majority of the magical properties are contained within the stem, leaving it most logical to break the leaves off as close to the branch as possible.  While your method contains the magic within the leaf for a longer period of time, such aspects are unnecessary when the root is kept more intact by a lower cut.”
“So of course we needed to keep going with the performances to the end of the week,” John said, trying to keep his tone reasonable but failing to fully hide his growing giddiness. “Because of the case.”
“I have means to return,” she said with a nod.  “His address, Mr. Holmes?  I’m afraid the information I have is of upmost importance.”
Turning slightly to look at Sherlock, John decided to follow his instinct and wrapped an arm tightly around Sherlock’s waist. He let out a slight huff of surprise and glanced down at John’s hand on his stomach, but returned to his conversation without making John move. “You could say that,” John said to Michael, angling them both so that they could continue their conversations comfortably. “Sometimes it’s the most stubborn ones who most need a strong lesson in following orders.”
John managed the jacket and shorts on his own, but he held the corset in front of him with a frown. Sherlock snuck up behind him and grabbed it, making John jump as he carefully settled it on his midsection and pulled it up to wrap around him. “I won’t make it too tight,” he muttered close to John’s ear as he started to fasten the row of clasps at his back. John forced himself to breathe normally as Sherlock’s hands carefully traced down to the bottom, finally pulling the sides down once he was finished to make sure it was straight. The corset felt pleasantly snug, enough that John would likely have small red markings on his skin once it came off but not enough that he couldn’t move or breathe as usual. Sherlock came around to his front and pinned the crest on the jacket just over where his scar sat underneath.
“Wait, is he a – “ Tom interrupted himself to stumble around the counter, wrinkled hands groping about for a wooden cane that stood close by.  “Bloody hell, John, you know you can’t just go round bringing Muggles in!  You’ve been out of touch for a bit, but you can’t have forgotten that!”
“John!” he let out on a sharp breath, his head thrown back as far as it would go. His arms rose from his sides as his hands reached out for John, eventually finding the sides of his shirt and gripping tightly enough to pull the tails from his trousers slightly. John shushed him, his breath ghosting along Sherlock’s skin and making him shudder. Finally John released the last button on his waistcoat and his hands dove under his shirt to grab at the skin of his waist.
“How many of these are Molly’s children?” he asked, not even trying to keep his surprise from his voice.  John chuckled and settled a hand on Sherlock’s thigh.
“They didn’t.” John’s breath caught in his throat and he swallowed, unconsciously holding Sherlock tighter. He didn’t press any further and Sherlock didn’t offer up any more information, but he didn’t try to move from their cosy position. John felt himself start to drift off and didn’t fight it, happily falling asleep with Sherlock cradled in his arms.
They never ventured up to the top floor of the exhibit space during their previous visit. John wasn’t surprised to find it set up in a similar style to the dressing and meeting rooms with a few minor alterations. Pillows and blankets were artfully arranged in groups of three or four around a raised dais in the centre of the room. On the dais itself sat a large mattress, bare except for the dark purple sheets spread smoothly over it. The most unexpected aspect of the room was the ceiling, which was completely covered in a tiled mirror. John blinked up at himself as Sherlock strolled past him to join Niall at the far corner.
“Bit of both,” John replied, moving a hand down to unbutton Sherlock’s fly and pull down the zip.  As he expected from the look of the jeans, he met hot, bare skin rather than the usual pair of pants.  He wrapped his fingers around the interested tip of Sherlock’s cock and twirled his thumb thoughtfully around it.  Sherlock shuddered and thrust his hips up further into John’s grip in response, attempting to shimmy his jeans down to give John better access.  John stilled him with a hand flat against his hip, but he did help shuffle the trousers down just enough so that Sherlock’s bare arse rested on the leather seat.  Sweat that pooled at his lower back squeaked as John settled him further up on the bike and the sound was nearly as satisfying as the noises coming from Sherlock’s mouth.
Just as Niall expected, Michael’s eyes grew huge and dilated the moment he saw Sherlock, and he bolted across the room to reach him. Sherlock’s eyes lowered demurely at his approach and he cocked his hip suggestively, running a single finger down the handle of his whip. John snorted his irritation and reminded himself that he could look all he wanted but John was the only one to have the privilege to touch before he spotted Elizabeth and the second woman across the room. John had read about her along with the others the day before – Nicolette Allen was in her sixties and well known in the London art scene as a big fan and even bigger financial contributor. From Niall’s notes, she tended to favour the queer couples over the straight ones, but attended every week religiously regardless. Straightening his waistcoat, John made his way over to her first.
McGonagall shook her head, her smile growing.  “You have quite the sentimental man there, Master Watson.”
Bringing his lips to Sherlock’s cockhead, John set one of his hands along Sherlock’s outer thigh in a steadying pressure and guided his opposite leg closer, resting his cheek with soft fondness against him to feel the heat of his skin.  Sherlock’s hips jutted out obscenely, seeking much needed friction, and John used the movement to guide cock to lips.  He followed the line of precome now following down the curve of Sherlock’s cock, meeting it where it slid along his crown.  Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed for a moment, one of them soon peeking open to watch John’s movements with rapt attention.  As John shifted to fully lick at his slit, Sherlock’s legs pushed against John’s opposing handholds to rock himself up on the balls of his feet.  His toes flexed against the lino in time to John’s tongue, pushing himself further into John’s mouth with each shift.  Unable to get a firm enough grip to properly thrust, Sherlock whimpered and dug his nails into the tabletop.
“Yeah, kind of what I figured.  Glad you saw it our way.”  He glanced at James over Sherlock’s shoulder as he stood and started to move towards the door.  “Is he still downstairs?”
John passed her stocking down to her on the floor as he went to go make them tea.  Albus and Scorpius were due to arrive at ten, not long after the house elves would bring them all a small brunch to share.  Though the trip down to arrange the special meal took nearly an hour, Cecelia enjoyed herself and the elves seemed delighted by her.  By the time John brought out the three mugs, Sherlock was dressed and sat cross legged and leaning against the sofa next to Cecelia.  He accepted the mug with a smile and John took a seat above them near Sherlock’s head.  They watched Cecelia as she gradually made her way through the stocking, John running his free hand through Sherlock’s hair absentmindedly.
,” John let out with a huff of breath as he attempted to catch him and lower him to the ground.  “Can’t even bloody faint without a damn speech about it first.”  He gave Sherlock a quick once over to make sure it was only shock that had knocked him out.  Other than a few cuts from being shoved about in the dark by John and a light gash on his arm where the spell grazed him, he appeared to be fine.  Nodding his satisfaction, John let him be for the moment and returned his attention to the pair of stunned men.  Upon further inspection, it appeared that he had hit the leader and the younger man, letting the final male who never spoke escape.  Given the number of years it had been since he used his wand, let alone duel, it could have been worse.  He pulled out his phone and dialed Harry’s number, shooting some ropes from the tip of his wand to bind his suspects at their wrists as it rang.  Luckily he’d added Harry’s number to his cell permanently, and he answered barely after the third ring.
John felt his chest tighten at the news, the feeling causing his nearly empty stomach to roll in slight protest.  “Was she a metamorphmagus, as far as you knew?  Or did you know much about her wand?”
“No, that’s fine, it’s…I just needed to know.  I may hate them, but they are still my family.”  Letting out a sigh, Greg offered his hand for John to shake.  “Thank you for listening and understanding, John.  I can’t say how much I appreciate it.”
McGonagall abruptly stood, readjusting her coat as she did.  “Thank you for your time, Mr. Holmes, and give John my regards.  Tell him my Floo is always open if he feels so inclined to discuss the matter, and he is welcome back at Hogwarts whenever he pleases.”  With a sharp nod and a wish for him to have a pleasant day, McGonagall turned and started down the stairs.
“I’m sure there will be plenty of spell grazes much like yours, not to mention much more complicated injuries.  I heard that Harry lost all the bones in his arm once.”
Sherlock’s head shot around to gape at him, but John entered balancing three mugs of tea before he could comment.  He set his own on the small table beside his chair, passing Mycroft one and holding Sherlock’s out to him.  When Sherlock didn’t move to take it, John placed it on the floor beside his chair instead.
Sherlock returned to his search of the sofa for his mobile, finally finding it between the cushions.  When he flipped it on to make the call, he found a pair of texts that stopped him in his tracks.
With a nod, Sherlock set Cecelia on a free space of counter to watch.  Sherlock attempted to pay attention as Neville explained to the class what they would be doing.  Instead, he found himself taking up the shears on his own and frowning down at the plant.  He attacked it with narrowed focus, trimming it down until he had a small pile of leaves and a nearly bare plant.  When he looked up, Neville and his class were staring at him in shock.
“I know, but the sooner this is finished, the sooner she’ll be safe.”  He twisted his hand to rest over the top of Sherlock’s on his opposite arm.  “Once this is done, things can be right again.”
“Sounds like that’s our cue to head out,” he said with a smirk.  John shrugged and grinned, leading them down and out into the evening.  Just as he was locking the door, he faintly heard Sherlock crying out and bolted up to them.
"Of course I'm going in there," Sherlock replied, his tone matter-of-fact, and made to dart around John's arm. John gripped at his shirt and forced him to stop, refusing to release him until Sherlock met his eyes.
“My magic is much more subdued than with the typical wizard,” Sherlock interjected.  “I’ve only been practicing it for the last six or so years.”
“It sounds as though you are opening up the opportunity for all sorts of mischief,” Sherlock commented, tapping his lips. “How are you managing to keep control of the situation?”
“Before we do anything, you’re having a cup of tea and at least a bit of toast,” John replied as he headed for the kitchen.  “You’re not carting my daughter around the flat without a proper dose of blood sugar in your system.”
“They’ll be thrilled,” John replied as he closed the door behind him and sat at the kitchen table.  “Ah, actually, the reason I stopped by was to tell you something that’s come up for the three of us.”
The moment they got home, Sherlock disappeared into his bedroom. John’s shoulders slumped as he threw himself onto the couch, blowing out a long breath and rubbing a hand through his hair. While Sherlock seemed to have recovered from their scene relatively easily, John could tell he was feeling the side effects of being a dom without the usual sub drop care he was used to giving. He knew every sub experienced their drop differently, but given how he acted immediately after, John thought that perhaps that evening would lead to the intimacy he desired. Regardless, John craved Sherlock’s skin, not for anything sexual, but simply to be able to comfort them both after an emotional scene and reassure himself that Sherlock was okay.
John thought, keeping the words to himself.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes but allowed John to place his coat over his shoulders without comment.  John quickly put on his own jacket and situated Sherlock’s hand in his elbow as he led them out of the castle.
John was on the verge of speaking when Sherlock suddenly veered off the path, his motions intense.  John followed close behind, forehead wrinkling in confusion, but he didn’t break their silence.  They marched along the grass, one behind the other as always, and eventually the trees started to clump closer together.  Uncertainty grew at a marginal pace, familiarity settling in when recognition hit John the farther they travelled.  He never purposefully went into the Forbidden Forest, but he could tell from the angle of their trek that they would soon be entering it, if they weren’t there already.  He rushed up to match Sherlock’s longer stride and put out a hand to grasp his shoulder.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but he was smiling.  “Yes, I would like some cake as well.  Are you happy?”
“I must admit, John, you’ve certainly found a handsome…flatmate,” he said with a lopsided grin. John caught the exaggerated pause in his statement and rolled his eyes.
“And you’ll be waltzing around with your cock out,” Sherlock replied, his voice impossibly lower than usual. John chuckled to hide his shiver.
John planted a kiss on the top of his head when he rose back to his feet to get Cecelia from her pillow fort in the sitting room.  “Knew you’d be brilliant at this,” he muttered into his ear, grinning widely at the shiver the brush of breath caused.  He winked at Sherlock as he backed into the sitting room and Sherlock rolled his eyes in reply.
Sherlock cleared his throat and replied in his fake voice, “Well, but better should Bilbo decide to join him and his little Arkenstone for reading.”
“I’ve organized for her to stay the night with Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said while crossing his arms over his chest.  John slowly approached him, bracketing him back against the door with his hands on either side of his head.
“Always ready to do what you should already be doing when there’s something for you to learn.”  Mycroft paced over to the window, addressing his next question to the glass.  “Did you discover what you were looking for?”
“Sorry, it’s just me,” John said quietly, smiling reassuringly down at Sherlock.  “You okay?”
Starting at the top of his chest, John danced his fingers across his collarbone, twirling the pads into the hollows.  He kneaded at the muscles just below, purposefully skipping over Sherlock’s nipples.  When Sherlock tilted his head to nip at John’s jaw, John grinned and humoured him, tweaking and pulling on them until Sherlock arched up and nearly spilled water over the tub’s edge.  John continued downward, outlining his abs and squeezing above his hips.  Sherlock growled and ground against John’s cock, which rested at the small of his back.  In retaliation, John bit down at the junction between his neck and shoulder.  Gasping, Sherlock’s hands flew to John’s thighs, digging his fingers hard into the flesh.  While John sucked across his neck and shoulder, Sherlock’s hands fluttered and copied the pressure up and down John’s thighs.  With the strength of their movements, both would leave the bath with lines of bruises in various locations.
Sherlock’s eyelids rose along with his eyebrows.  “I suppose I could, if Harry’s still amendable.  It certainly would be easier to communicate with him than it has been with Lestrade.  Could we connect our fireplace with the Floo in Harry’s office at the Ministry?”
“Sounds like you two had a good day after all.  What did you see?”
out there!”  Greg started scrounging around in the pile of clothes at the bottom of his closet, whipping off his pants and throwing them across the room.  John snickered at him and tossed a pillow at his head, missing him by an inch to slam into the wall.
Apparently refusing to take the hint, Doyle pushed away from the wall to round the table and join Sherlock’s side.  “I’ve a break this period.  I came looking for a book and found something more interesting.”
Teacher!Sherlock.  John's surprising his daughter by coming in to help with her class' project and ends up getting a bit distracted by her attractive teacher.
Settled comfortably between Sherlock’s cheeks was
“Ah, that’s very good, Cecelia,” Flitwick called from the front of the class, looking at them over the tops of his glasses.  “Perhaps it might be best if you and your father let me teach the class.”
“Is it something to do with bees?” Sherlock called as John left the room, tossing the covers into the corner farthest from the bed.  The only response he received was a bark of laughter, leaving him alone and soon freezing as the winter chill crept in through the window’s drafts.  Huffing out a sigh, Sherlock rose and hurried into the bathroom to shower, eventually following John out to the rest of the flat.  He found him in his chair, an almost empty cup of tea at his side and his phone in his hands.
time John had to leave the clinic during the day on a ridiculous whim of Sarah’s to “make the office more festive.”  And of
Sherlock studied John’s face, eyes alive with determination.  The expression dulled down Sherlock’s own agitation, making way for a wave of warmth he refused to analyze too fully.  Instead, he gave John a sharp nod.  “If you get hurt, I will never forgive you.”
“It’s not unlike chemistry in its delicate timings and measuring of ingredients to produce a specific result.  It’s one of the only magical practices, from what I’ve studied thus far, that genuinely attempts to take Muggle science and merge it with the magical, at least in practice.  The addition of giving it the right specific amount of magic to what is, at its centre, an experiment is not unlike what a chemist may produce in a lab.”
Barking out a humourless laugh, John nodded. “Yep. He’s said no, though, practically right from the moment we met, so the best I can do is make sure he’s healthy and happy. He might not want to be loved, but I’m going to do it the best I can anyway and take what I can from our friendship.”
“As long as you two have worked out your little emotional issue, that’s all I care about.  The last thing I need is my partner and my detective inspector caught up in a tiff.”
“Hush, babe, I’ve got you.”  John felt his hiccupping breaths, almost on the verge of hyperventilating, and rubbed his back, making soothing noises into his ear.  “Breathe, come on.  Relax, I’m here.”
Sherlock leaned into John and sighed.  “Yes.  Are we actually having tea now?”
“That’s all we can hope for,” John replied, stealing a glance at Sherlock. He almost couldn’t see him through the crowd that surrounded him, many of them visibly straining with the need to touch him. Sherlock must have felt his gaze and looked up to meet his eyes, shooting him a brief smile.
?  What kind of experiment involves
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you look so nervous about going to dinner before,” he remarked as he laced their fingers together.  Sherlock hummed as though he was indifferent, but John could feel his slightly sweaty palm.
“You have to make sure you don’t tell anyone, okay?” John said as he picked up the larger ring.  “I’m gonna ask your papa to marry me.”
John took the opportunity to slide Sherlock’s jacket all the way off.  He nuzzled against his chest, running his nose light enough to tickle along the edge of his open shirt.  Sherlock moved both of his hands up to run through John’s hair, attempting to guide John’s path.  As he shifted down, John finished unbuttoning the shirt.  He abruptly pulled up once they were all open and grabbed the edges to yank Sherlock toward him.  A high pitched squeak followed by a moan came from Sherlock when his chest rubbed against the fabric of John’s own shirt.  John snuck a hand between them to toy with his neglected nipple while pulling him into a deep kiss.
They both fell silent, each ruminating on his own thoughts.  The only sounds in the flat came from the fire and faint noises of Mrs. Hudson moving in her flat below.  Sherlock drummed his fingers on his knees thoughtfully, curving mouth pinched into a frown.  “There’s still something I don’t understand.  Why are you here?  Why would you be sitting on the couch of 221b if you’re a wizard?”
“It’s a case, actually,” John quickly explained.  He glanced down at Sherlock, whose only response was a single raised eyebrow.  “Something we really need to take care of, unfortunately.  Are you done at work already?”

“Hi, I’m John!” he said.  He glanced down at the violin in Sherlock’s hand and pointed at it eagerly.  “Do you play in the orchestra?”
Teddy leapt forward to shake Mrs. Hudson’s hand, shooting John a questioningly raised eyebrow as he did.  John gave him an almost unnoticeable shake of his head, correctly interpreting Teddy’s unasked inquiry of ‘witch?’  Teddy’s beaming smile never faltered during the exchange.  “Edward Lupin, ma’am, a pleasure to meet you.  I’m sorry I didn’t stop by to say a hello on my way up; I didn’t want to bother you.  I’m a friend of John’s.”
John shot back to attention with a scowl. “Oi, it was the late eighties. None of us were what you’d call the pinnacle of style.” He approached the side table where Niall and Sherlock stood, glancing down at the box atop it. “This is for us, I assume?”
Sherlock nodded and moved back to rest in the position John put him in originally.  John nuzzled his face a final time before shifting down again, focusing in on the scar.  He settled his hands on Sherlock’s hips and leaned in to run his tongue in a circle around the mark.  At Sherlock’s full body shudder, he latched his lips around the former hole and sucked, layering wet kisses over it.  Sherlock tried to arch up into the kisses, but John’s hands kept him still.  John continued to lave at the skin, until he had Sherlock trembling in his grip.  Whining deep in his chest, Sherlock squirmed and clutched a hand at one of John’s shoulders, pushing and pulling John where he wanted him to go.
Without a word, Sherlock threw John’s arm around his shoulders, body slightly bent to accommodate their height difference.  John angled them in what he thought was the right direction from Harry’s last descriptions to him and they set off.  They were lucky they arrived at midday on a pleasant weekend in August, otherwise the street might have been crawling with wizards and Muggles alike.  The sudden appearance of two men, one slightly injured and the other carrying a baby, would have been likely to cause more than a few raised eyebrows.
