“Cas, chill. Sex is not scary. It’s actually pretty awesome.” She cups his face in both hands and kisses him again, still without tongue, and he responds this time, mimicking her, his body gradually losing some of its tension. Why’d she have to get the uptight virgin angel? Oh right - so she got to do this. “Also, it’s
“Bobby, you’ve been more of a father to me than he ever was,” Dee says seriously, voice rasping even lower. “It wasn’t his fault, and he loved us in his own way, but. If he deserves any name, it’s yours.”
Cas doesn’t answer, just bows his head forward to let Dean get a better angle. Dean’s almost ruthless, really getting his thumbs in there and pressing down, but Cas just arches into it and hums low in his chest. Eventually Dean slides a hand up into his hair and pulls his head back, and Cas blinks up at him upside down, tongue creeping out over his lower lip.
“Dean,” he slurred, blinking, and Dean gave him his best smile, aware of the assistant still lurking outside.
"what the fuck i have an iud this should not be happening" is her first proper sentence (because her periods are hell and she can't keep refilling the pill from all across the country not to mention schedules are not really a thing with her), followed by "how far along?"
"The Winchesters are my responsibility, Lord," Cas counters, chin coming up and looking him briefly in the eye for the first time. "I would be remiss if I didn't seek to protect them from such elemental forces as your family."
"Yeah, well, this is Purgatory, Dean. We gotta think bigger," she says, almost fond, and nudges at his arm. "Keep pressure on that."
joshua's mouth thins. "eventually, he was bled of the scourge within him and cast from heaven, no longer fit to be a member of the host."
“Why’re you askin’?” Bobby says, finally peering over the top of the paper, and Dean shrugs and turns around while he waits for the toast.
Cas is worse then dead.
“Are you, um-” Dean stops, clears his throat, tries again. “Do you want me to fetch you a spare shirt?”
“You will do what, Dean Winchester?” not-Mrs-Graham says flatly, zapping over next to Emmy, and Dean twists desperately against the angel holding him, until his vision starts to go bright around the edges and he gags from the pain. The angels watch dispassionately, looking faintly disgusted.
"I seriously do. Where'd you say yours was, anyway? I'll get it off the road and into storage for the night."
Curiosity overcoming him, Dean swings out of bed and goes to the window, and finds that Conesta has somehow dragged herself up from the field to the house, bandages trailing behind her and trampled hopelessly into the mud, and is currently burrowing her head into Castiel’s chest like any dog with a returned master. Dean has for years known how to open the window without it making noise - the better not to alert his parents to his nighttime excursions to the village - and he cracks it open now in time to hear Castiel soothing her like a frightened child.
Dean throws his arms out. "Why, what the fuck
“But you still killed her,” Iope says flatly, and it’s hard to say if she’s being judgey or not. Dean shrugs expansively - she hurt Sam and killed Cas, why wouldn’t he?
Then something runs out in front of the car on a back road in Texas, and he doesn’t swerve fast enough, feels the impact like an extension of his own body. For one heart-stopping moment he thinks it was a daemon, that he’s gonna find some rambler collapsed on the side of the road, but it’s just a dog, which whines and strains to get away when he crouches down beside it, but goes limp and defeated in his arms.
"She is no such thing," Castiel objects, humour in his voice, and Dean grins over his shoulder at him.
be able to see that thing."
jump at the sound of his voice.
“Cas, jesus, can you just-” and she gropes for his other hand, shoves it down between her legs, curves it against the denim and rocks down against it, feeling him match her rhythm, press his fingers up against her. He breaks off from kissing at the side of her breast to look down, pulls away from her grip and pops her jeans open, then slips his hand carefully inside.
Fan: But the- when they went to the brothel, he looked so terrified!
“Of course,” Dean says, and is off running for the barn. He thinks he hears the aviator start to say something else, but whatever it is is lost as he leaves them behind. It can wait until he returns.
Cas’s hesitates, just a little. “...And how do you feel about them?”
Dean squared his shoulders. “Yeah,” he said, grateful that his voice didn’t squeak despite his dry throat. “Bye Dad.” John’s other arm wrapped over his shoulder, pulling him close for a second then releasing him. Dean turned to his little brother, who was watching him with wide eyes. “Bye Sammy.” Sam didn’t say anything but he clung tight, face against Dean’s shoulder. “Hey, two more years,” Dean whispered, and Sam nodded against him and pulled away, blinking hard.
“Dean,” Tsalia says, butting her head against his hip. “Dean, no, look at me and Vim, it’s not like that.”
Dean makes a heroic effort at swallowing. "Cas? He isn't gonna get punished for, for trespassing or something is he?"
"Dean," Cas says, almost a growl, and when he opens his eyes to smirk at him Cas grabs him by the scruff of the neck and kisses him, lubed fingers wrapping around his cock and making Dean's hips stutter forward.
“Please,” the aviator says, sky-blue eyes fixed on him, wide and a little glazed themselves, his voice almost giving out, and Dean can only nod.
“Better?” Gabriel queries, still grinning, and Dean nods warily. “Oh, be more enthusiastic! Baby bro here worked his wings off!” His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper. “I tell ya, you haven’t lived ‘til you’ve seen him running around trying to corral wild swans.”
," Dean hisses the moment the door closes behind them. "How're we gonna get to talk to her now? Ugh, that dickwad Balthazar needs his fucking wings plucked, selling shit like that to kids."
"But dude, I still can't believe I almost made it with a fairy!" Charlie says later in the bar, wide-eyed and a little smug. Her cocktail umbrella is tucked behind her ear, a splash of brighter colour in her fiery hair.
The boats glided silently forward, the hushed murmur of their passage through the water the only sound, all the students now reverently silent. They were going pretty fast actually, Dean thought, watching the water slide past like silk, breaking the reflection of the castle as they got closer and closer to it, the rockface looming up in front of them, and then Hagrid called, “Watch your heads!” and Dean felt tendrils of ivy slithering over his shoulders. Everything went black, the stars cut off and the only sound the whisper of the water as they moved, and then there was light up ahead and a dimly-lit harbour came into view, made of natural rock outcroppings and bordered with a thin pebble beach. The boats drew up to the shore and they all got out, crunchily following Hagrid and his light into the gaping entrance to a sloping tunnel and wondering where they were going to come out.
and more than that, and you’re ignoring it all because it’s easier to hate him!”
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure Cas."
Sam bangs on the door. “Dean! Don’t use all the hot water man, some of us still have to shower, remember!”
“The point is,” Bobby continues loudly after a second, as if Dean had never spoken, “stop naturalizing my yard!”
“So I can train it to hunt with us,” Sam says, looking over at Dean, then at Cas. “I’m pretty sure it could take down anything we could throw at it. And it could be a guard dog too, here and if, I don’t know, we ever have to leave the car in a shady neighbourhood or something.”
us? Yeah, they’re back.”
St Claire’s mouth quirks. “Are you suggesting she is somehow inferior to them? No, it’s fine,” he adds, over Dean’s protests, “you’re not the first to have said it. Though in my opinion she is, of course, quite the finest creature anyone could possibly wish for. And we are every bit as useful as the larger beasts, in our own way.”
Bobby closes his eyes and counts to ten. "What kinda problem?"
Sam’s little time limit seems to have done the trick though, and Cas starts fucking him earnest, the arm around Dean’s waist pulling him back into every thrust. Dean pushes back into it too, frees one hand to jack himself off cause they’re on the clock here, and fuck but it feels good, the hot throb of his cock and the deeper, electric flares of sensation every time Cas rolls his hips forward that send pleasure spiking up his spine, a little higher each time. He leans back into Cas, lets him take most of his weight and sucks at his fingers, curling his tongue around and between them and closing his eyes, so close now, orgasm coiling in his stomach and drawing tighter, tighter as he spreads his legs further apart, lets Cas really go for it-
“I assure you, it would be not great loss,” Cas says, glaring down at it, and Crowley makes an irritated noise. Sam glances over at him.
With the final aftershocks Dean sways into his supporting arm, head dropping lower, and Cas’s hands come up to brace his hips as he hollows his cheeks and gently draws away. Dean’s shoulders twitch at what must be too much sensation, and when Cas finally sags back against the wall himself the hand that Dean’s been keeping behind his head slips down over the nape of his neck and comes to rest bracketing one side of his throat, thumb resting right in the hollow of it. One side of Cas’s mouth curls up in a smirk and he rolls his eyes up to meet Dean’s, rolls his tongue out over his lower lip and leaves it wet. He shifts just a little, spreading his knees, and presses the heel of one hand to his dick, eyes fluttering. Dean’s thumb slides up higher over his throat, then his whole hand slots round across Cas’s neck and Cas arches his hips up, lets his mouth fall open.
his phone goes off what feels like not two seconds after his head touches the pillow, and
Sam stares helplessly round the room like Dean might suddenly materialize from thin air, or maybe even from the disgusting black gunk Dick left behind, but he knows Crowley’s right -  they’re on their own. They’re stuck in the main Roman Enterprises headquarters, now visibly attacked and defaced with black ooze - not to mention full of decapitated bodies - with no friends to help them and the car stuck through a sign, and the police sirens are getting louder every second they stay.
,” she murmurs, forehead against his, “don’t tell me you’ve faced down Alastair and Raphael but you’re scared of
, and Dean’s pretty sure you’re not supposed to take weapons out of stab wounds in case they’re all that’s holding back the fatal damage - but there’ll be a hell of a lot more fatal damage if he doesn’t kill the bitch right freaking now.
"...Wow, really?"
"Stay awake a little longer, dearest, and we'll make a bed for you," Castiel tells her, and she makes an agreeable sort of noise and resettles herself where she's sort of slumped on the ground. Dean winces at the sight of the bandages he can see left behind her like a trail of breadcrumbs, muddied and useless and meaning she's pressing her only newly-closed wounds into the ground with every movement.
“Oh wow, subtle,” Dee says, but she rolls over and he goes with it until she’s on top. “Then I guess you’ll continue gettin’ laid, Casanova.”
Originally written for my kink bingo square "lacerations", because never let it be said that I am ever in a fandom in which I do not write either a daemon or dragon-riding AU (or in this case, both, one twice for good measure)
His fingers are warm and she snaps her hand back around his wrist, already so close, and just grinds down against them as her thighs start to shake. Cas, miracle that he is, just goes with it, fingers molding against her cunt with just the right pressure and palm right fucking perfect against her clit, and she fucks down against his hand and tries to remember to bite back all her usual seriously blasphemous curses as pleasure goes slamming up her spine.
they get a dog six months later, as practise for kids. dean wants to call him spike, rex, killer, cas thinks that's dumb; they compromise on apollyon, greek for "destroyer". poll is a mutt, collie/wolfhound/pointer/whatever, lean and hairy and easy to train, though he likes to pretend he doesn't understand sometimes and has been known to ignore you completely if bored of your repetition. he also enjoys running off with dean's shoes for no discernible reason, though he returns them no worse for the wear bar a bit of slobber.
“Hey, that is not-”
“So what, you have like, a farm-come-garage? That’s like, fixing animals
You should really listen to "Skin" by Rihanna while you read this, because I was.
Dean raises his eyebrows, strolling closer. “Oh, so we’re playing innocent. Okay, fine.”
“I’m sure I won’t,” Cas says, but there’s no annoyance there, only fondness. “You be careful though.”
They rush to support him and he wraps both arms around them, murmurs "Boys," and leans his forehead against Dean's shoulder. Dean doesn't even mention it, just hugs him back, as tight as he can bring himself to now that Cas is human and fragile.
The air is still again. At the edge of the clearing lies a cougar daemon, unmoving.
kind of awkwardness, like he's trying to balance something on his head and something heavy on his back at the same time; shoulders straight and chin up like a good little soldier. Now there's just a clean sweep of pale skin, lean legs up to the wings bracketing his back and that perpetually-tousled dark head. Dean reaches out, curling a hand loosely over Cas's calf; he wants to go over every inch of skin with hands and mouth, and that's still something he's a little surprised he can think about a guy.
“That Dean?” a woman says, and Dean peels himself reluctantly away only to see the huge feathery shape of an eagle owl soaring over to join the daemon commotion, and Ellen Harvelle reaching for him with shining eyes.
“Nope, and no wings either, as you can see.”
Sam's daemon Iope is a
cas gets more insistent and then violent after that, and eventually dean tells emmy to go see sam and watches dispassionately as cas throws himself against the ropes until his wrists are bleeding and he's sobbing, messy and raw and so very very human. the next morning they extinguish the circle, bandage cas's wrists, move emmy's cot to sam's room and carry on. weeks (and emmy's birthday (6th may)) pass and he gets worse, raving about how emmy stole his grace and if she'd just come closer he can take it back. she eyes him narrowly and clings to dean, and the next night dean makes her stay with sam and sits grimly by the door, angel blade across his knees, watching cas twist and scream on the bed, sometimes in languages dean doesn't know. a couple nights later emmy zaps in during the raving, cocks her head at cas, then zips to his side and presses a hand to his forehead, and he quiets immediately. she grins over at dean. after that, they start using her whenever cas gets difficult.
might turn up-”
“Dean, holy fire negates an angel’s power. You know this.”
"That is unfortunate, though you’ve come to the right place for assistance," he says, coming down the steps to meet her, and the dogs apparently take it as permission and come scuffling after him. He's backlit by the warm glow of the house lights like some kind of angel, hair messy and eyes warm as he watches her crouch to say hello to the dogs, which are snuffling enthusiastically at her feet. "Please, come in."
Iope uncurls and drops down to the floor, tucking herself against Tsalia’s chest. Tsalia’s forelegs wrap painfully around her, and Iope buries herself under Tsalia’s chin. Weakly, stuttering like a badly-tuned engine, she starts to purr.
Dean chuckles. “And yet
His wings are curved temptingly close, and if Cas gonna play dirty then so can Dean; he loops both arms under Cas’s and grabs a double handful of feathers, careful to keep his grip just loose enough not to pull any out but tight enough to feel. Cas growls something else that would be written as a squiggle and speeds up, and Dean grins up at him and matches him, giving his handfuls of wing a tug. Cas’s head falls back, spine arching, and Dean cards his hands messily through the feathers, deliberately catching them between his fingers as he goes, and Cas groans and drops his head back forward, fingers tightening on Dean’s arm and sparking five points of heat that burn through his chest.
Tsalia makes that rough purring sound again, and Dean darts his gaze down to her, is grateful when she doesn’t meet his eyes this time. He licks his lips and she echoes it a second later, slow and deliberate, and fuck it, if he’s gonna get the soundtrack he might as well have the visuals to go with it.
Dean gives him a look. "That was
“Winchester, Dean,” squeaked Professor Flitwick, and Dean made his legs work and walked forward, picking up the hat and putting it on and sitting down on the hard stool.
“Dee-”
And of course, there are the dogs, the original two crowding round her again and joined by another, who slips in round the half-open door. The black one, denied Dean’s company, had snuffled Adelaide's offered hand then withdrawn to go lie between the aga and the door, apparently waiting for him to come back. "So how'd you end up with so many dogs?" she asks finally, when the silence creeps towards awkward, and Cas glances over at her, mouth tugging up at the dogs' antics.
, Dean,” Sam says disapprovingly, but his mouth is twitching.
Halfway up the main stairs Cas wavered, and Dean, already at the top, turned to coax him the rest of the way. Cas was leaning on the banister like he needed it to hold him up, forehead almost touching the marble, and a faint, suspicious sizzling sound was coming from him the longer he leaned there. Dean winced, imaging what McGonagall would say if Cas disfigured the rebuilt grand staircase when it was still less than a decade old.
joshua fixes him with one of those angelic glares. "as you say, their fates have already come to pass. castiel declared himself a false god, and presumed to create the host anew. such violations cannot be tolerated."
“Cas, dude, I’m not exactly a teenager here. Sorry, not gonna happen.”
"I could sleep right here, so yeah. Seriously, this is so kind of you, I can't believe-"
“Look, Cas,” Dean says, because Cas is looking like Dean kicked his puppy and then ran over it several times just to be sure. “This is all really...uh, nice, but you could’ve just got me some mistletoe and had done with it.”
"i know."
and it
Tsalia goes still, ears pricked, and Dean follows her when she steals over to the side of one of the cabins. There’s a giggle from round the corner, and Dean chances a look, Tsalia hunkered down on her stomach and doing the same.
His eyes flick over her, assessing, and then he kind of...relaxes and smiles at her, eyes crinkling. And okay, so he's maybe not gonna make her drop and give him twenty or handcuff her to the radiator or something after all. The smile becomes a concerned frown, and he looks past her at the first guy. "Cas, the poor kid's shaking. Get her a blanket, jeez. What's your name, sweetheart?"
"You're not the only person who lost someone in the War, Cas! They'll choose Aurors by who's the best at duelling and concealment and shit, pratical spells, not by who was given the most power at school!"
“Look at their daemons,” Tsalia says from where she’s crouched at his feet, and Dean obligingly drops his eyes. Under the table, Vim is on her stomach and inching closer to the other Tsalia, who’s flicking her tail like she does when she’s preoccupied, eyes slitted half-shut and pretending not to notice Vim’s approach.
“Don’t do this,” Dean says, urgent, but behind him he feels the horrible sucking void of the Empty come into being, the absolute cold of nothingness that pulls at him steadily, seeking out his life, his warmth.
"Oh, so what, I'm not  good enough to be an Auror because I'm not fucking sticking a broom up my ass and taking ten points off every time some kid breathes too loudly?" Dean demanded, and Cas's wings bristled.
, and the neat little black and white spaniel-daemon who follows quietly in his wake as his, despite the nagging feeling that if Cas had a daemon, it’d be an eagle or something cause, y’know, wings (he feels vindicated in this because for the brief time Jimmy’s daughter had served as Cas’s vessel, her daemon had been a golden eagle, crouched silent and furious on her shoulder with his wings spread wide). He feels kind of guilty about it when he remembers that he’s wrong, that Jimmy Novak seemed like a decent kind of guy, and gets a fresh pang of guilt every time Cas does something reckless with Jimmy’s body and the spaniel-daemon flinches like she’s been hit, wanting desperately to press in close and check he isn’t hurt but unable to bring herself to get too near to the thing occupying her human’s body.
responsible!" Cas returned heatedly, clenching his fists, wings snapping into being with a furious serpentine rustle. "

There’s that scuffle of paws on wood and Poll snuffles against his hip, insinuating his head between Dean and the door and demanding attention, tail beating against the glass. Dean reaches out with one hand and Poll shoves his head into it, leaning his body against Dean’s leg when Dean automatically starts scratching behind his ear.
“what, no dean i’m fine” sam says when dean asks, “just...weird dreams while my brains sorts through everything, i guess. sorry if i scared you” “nah, it‘s fine” dean says, and doesn’t mention angels at all. shortly after that the alpha things stop, and they’re back to regular ol’ hunts; everything eve made has to be put down, and all the other monsters that came crawling out the woodwork in anticipation of a coup that never came besides. another motel, and dean wakes to find sam on his laptop. “can’t sleep” he explains, fingers jittering at the plastic, “thought i’d do some extra research” and dean considers him then grunts and rolls back over. kid’s an adult and hey, if he wants to be productive...
Sam splutters into his drink. "Jesus Dean, it was
not gonna-” He mimed the jerk-off motion, just in case the assistant had Disillusioned himself or something like a giant perv and was still listening, and Cas actually groaned, then slapped his hand to his mouth to muffle it and actually bit down. His hips jerked hard, making the water slosh, and all the ice in the bath vanished.
“Jesus Sam, can’t a man shower in peace?” he calls back, forcing his voice steady. Cas nips at the pink outline of his scar, still more sensitive than the rest of Dean’s skin, and he swallows the noise he wants to make and grinds backwards in retaliation.
"Um yeah, I- my car died on me and I-"
A sigh, and she sits up behind him, sheets rustling. “Dean. Look, I- I used to be a psychologist, before. Maybe I can help. Especially now, with Cas laid up - don’t think I haven’t noticed how much worse it’s gotten since he got hurt; he’s your second-in-command, you need him and he can’t be there right now, it must be tough-”
"Hey," Sam says, low, leaning towards her and catching her eyes but not reaching out to touch, "Charlie, we've never met an angel that gave a crap about Leviticus, okay? In fact, from what we know they don't really recognise gender at all, cause they're all basically just like...wavelengths of light in their natural state."
They all trooped after him out into the Entrance Hall and through a large doorway to the side of marble staircase, Dean registering vaguely that the Slytherins were going with them, but the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws were going up the marble staircase, and spared a thought for all the stairs ahead of them. He was pretty sure if he tried to climb now his legs would fall off. The Slytherins peeled off down another corridor, but the Hufflepuffs kept going until they came to a seemingly random collection of wooden barrels, presumably somewhere near the kitchen.
, Bobby, he’s not gettin’ night-terrors over Cas being God!”
“Sam, it’s me, you gotta get your ass back home, now. The angels have got Emmy, and Cas is gone with everything smashed to shit, and I just- I need you back here, okay? Like, now.”
"Is the pie to your satisfaction?" the guy asks, and Dean nods, swallows his mouthful and elaborates in case this guy takes offense easy.
“Don’t be stupid, the post won’t go ‘til tomorrow by now. I’m not gonna make you sleep in the barn or anything. I was just...” Dean looks away from that bright, unwavering stare. “C’mon, we should check on that wound.”
[and then later, after Cas learns to eat her out]
The first blow of Billie’s fist makes the sigil glow again, clearly weakening it by degrees.
“Yeah, you really should get on that.” He waves at the desk. “How much of this is important?”
There’s also the part where he is very, very naked and there is an honest-to-god white, frilly garter digging into his thigh.
“Stop being pissed off and
“Gabriel and Michael,” he corrects, sliding his good arm free of his shirt. “Michael is the elder but chose to go to the Church, where I’m told he does much good; Gabriel has taken up the mantle of layabout heir in his stead.”
Imp stops so suddenly Dean almost crushes his balls against the front of the saddle, throwing her head up and snorting at the air. You'd think she'd be sharding used to it by now, but no; she's tensed up like a wher in front of a dragon, frozen still and refusing to move. The lizards erupt into the air around them and she flinches like they're attacking her, breaking her trance to dance helplessly across the track as the whole fair goes swirling up to greet dragon and rider, caroling their welcome.
of things that a bunch of crazed angels could visit upon an almost-human and a five year old child, one of which they despise for trying to rule them and then to replace them, and the other of which they see as a violation of every natural law. He remembers Zachariah, trying to get him to say yes to Michael and casually removing Sam’s lungs; remembers how exhausted Cas was from losing even a little grace, or from banishing himself across the country with barely any grace left to sustain him.
“Only for a few minutes though,” he warned him sternly. “Then we need to change his ice again.”
"Yeah, well is there a gingerbread house around? Cause that's where they'll be."
“Nice pedicure, Cas,” Sam says, looking down at his feet, and Cas’s smile spreads.
." He holds Castiel's eyes for a moment, then swings round and snarls, "
Then he pulls up in front of the library, and everything goes to hell.
“Okay,” Bobby says, folding his arms and leaning back against the counter, “so what
"Level ten. About. Maybe level seven hundred."
"Oh yeah, we'll just wall it off nice and neat and he'll be a good little boy and never poke and pry at it - oh, wait, he's a
Dean takes a breath, lets it out. “Yes he did.”
Jared: Misha?!
He finds the beast crumpled in the field, all the sheep huddled at the further end and working themselves into a frenzy, each trying to be the furthest away from this monster thrown into their midst. Dean understands the feeling. There’s a gouge in the earth when the creature skidded as it landed, and if it was injured before it will surely be worse now.
There is bright sunlight and a warm breeze, birdsong and the smell of green things blooming under a warm sun. “Huh,” Dean says, glancing around, taking it all in. “Made it to Heaven.”
"Hey Castiel-" Dean starts, and that's as far as he gets before Cas is in front of him in a rush of air and wingbeats. Dean grins at him conspiratorially, opens his mouth to say
Cas shrugs awkwardly, looking over at the daemon in question. "She knew I was...different." The bird-daemon rustles his feathers, settling deeper into his living pillow.
) and breathe into his folded arms, the steering wheel hard against his temple, and acknowledge he has nowhere to go. Iope scrambles up onto the dashboard and pets his hair, crooning the same crap they picked up from Dean when they were little - “Hey Sammy no, don’t cry, it’ll be okay, we’ll figure it out” -  and Sam swallows against the raw feeling in his throat, the wetness sticking his eyelashes together, and tries not to wish too hard that he was five again and crying into his pillow about something childish and stupid while Dean stroked clumsily at his hair and promised to make it all alright again.
“Yeah,” Bobby says later, when Dean’s taken Rufus’ old seat and it’s just the two of them, sitting out in the warm afternoon and soaking it into their bones. “Your boy did good.”
“You sick fucking psychos,” Dean snarls, and fights against his captor as much as he can, trying to ignore the waves of agony crackling up his arm. It’s like trying to escape a brick wall. “That has
"Red hair - you must be a Weasley," Dean says cheerfully to the guy, who booms - like, actually booms - a laugh and grins, teeth white and even.
She almost misses the turning in her preoccupation with whether anyone's ever had half their legs amputated from frostbite, but the absence of tree-shadows on her left finally registers and she squints down it. That's definitely a house at the end, and the drive is wide and solid-packed dirt, ruts snaking outwards where cars have driven up and down it from the road.
“Guess you’ll have to stop stutterin’ and go ask him, son.”
Dean and his daemon are the only ones left in the room.
"Uh, yeah," and he manages a short little laugh at Charlie's incredulity. "Cas" (and he almost fills in the rest of the angel's name before he remembers it may well summon the guy and they still don't know what's up with him right now) "he's, uh, he's the 1% who isn't a douche."
"Even when they're hurt?" Dean asks, shocked, and Castiel's good shoulder shifts, indicating the dismissive attitude of those in charge. "That's- I can probably put the horses out for the night, it's not that cold-"
"A dog is for life Dean, not just for Christmas. Anyway, don't tell me it won't be useful - you've seen what they can do."
“It had to be you, didn’t it Novak?” Madam Pomfrey said wearily when she appeared at the door, opening it wide and waving him in. “Love potions! At your age! Might as well run the Triwizard again, it’d be safer!” She looked briefly back at Dean. “Thank you, Winchester, we’ll take him from here. He didn’t touch anyone, did he?”
Cas makes a vague noise of assent. Sex always robs him of the ability to speak for a bit, and though he doesn’t fall asleep, he does go all drowsy and adorable.
to them?
imagines this could end, and when he stops sucking on Dean’s lower lip and breaks the kiss Dean maybe makes a needy little noise he will deny forever. The mistletoe, apparently satisfied, is gone.
She's not too far down before she realises it's more like a farm than just a house, and the likelihood of serial killing reduces significantly. The drive is edged with wooden fence posts, and little shelters dot the paddocks she passes. It's way too small to be a proper farm, like one where they raise stuff for food, but there's at least four separate fields and maybe even a pond. The animals are obviously asleep, but a bird rustles its wings somewhere behind her and something small slinks across in front of her that she's pretty sure was a cat.

cas gets increasingly srs bsns in their sixth year, undoing all dean’s good work in mellowing him out. he slowly distances himself from dean and everybody else, and balthazar says sadly that he really needs to give it up like he did. they go out of their way to try and hang out with him, but. also, sam and ruby seems to be getting kind of serious and it’s creeping dean out because seriously, he thought sam and jess had it made (well, except for madison the gryffindor last year, but they’re still friends so). completing the lucifer/michael parallels, the ravenclaw head boy, raphael, seems to have it for cas for no real reason, and they have to keep an eye on him as much as they can because dude keeps trying to hex cas between classes and is generally trying to undermine him everywhere, muttering about how he shouldn't even be a prefect, little half-blood freak etc etc. one of the girls, lisa, who’s little brother ben is in hufflepuff and thinks dean is the best thing ever, is almost on as good terms with the kitchen elves as gabe, and provides a welcome distraction and a sympathetic ear (also, sweets).
"Oh, that's easily sorted," Crowley says cheerfully, and in a blink he's transferred the puppy to one hand and shoved the other into Sam's chest, yanking upwards. Sam jerks, breath leaving him in a startled gasp, and Cas is gone from the couch and has his sword to Crowley's throat.
” Dean hisses back, hunkering down to her level. “No way am I looking in there!”
Dean does it again, a little faster this time, exerting a little more effort into holding Cas down and getting a full-body shudder for his trouble, Cas’s wings flexing over his head. They’re drawing back in towards their owner’s body and the feathers become a constant tickle on the back of his neck and shoulders, ruffling his hair, as he carries on licking in rough stripes and making Cas quake with it, restless against Dean’s hold and repeating his name like a curse or a prayer.
"So he
For a moment the cat stays frozen, still as fucking stone, and then as a door opens down the hall and footsteps come running it whips around and flings itself at Sam and Dean's feet. Dean feels the weight of it hit his leg, and then they're back in the motel room, blinking in the sudden light and staring at the cat, which is standing over by the beds, tail held stiffly out behind it, and staring down at one of its front paws like it holds the secrets of the universe.
Cas finally turns to look at him. "You do not 'bother' me, Dean. As I have told you, much of the time I would rather be here, with you. I must take whatever opportunity I can to gain a little respite; they are few enough as it is."
"It's lost," Castiel says slowly, and Crowley grins.
Dean keeps himself still as he wakes, coherent enough to realise she’s whispering for a reason and not wanting to draw attention to himself. He turns his head carefully towards hers. “Yeah?”
"Can’t we somehow block his memories of his time in the Cage?"
the town drunk with a house was full of demonology books and obscure religious texts has an iron-clad panic room in his basement, crazy son-of-a-bitch - and the money they get from eventually selling Rufus' place, they buy a small little run-down farm.
The Winchesters find out because with Rufus visiting they offer to go find a motel or sleep on the couch or something cause Bobby's only got two spare rooms "and I don't know if you've noticed, but we're kinda too big now to bunk up together"
"Frogs," Sam repeats, glancing over at Dean, and Mrs Dalloway nods.
The case is done, but they're past the checkout time and Sam had tried to look casual about going back to that Starbucks again, laptop tucked under his arm, but Dean had grinned at him and agreed that yeah, that barista had definitely been flirting with him, what, would he like a written invitation, get over there already and Sam had told him he was an ass and hurried out, ears faintly pink. "And don't come back til you've frothed her cappuccino good!" Dean had shouted after him, and Sam had flipped him off.
Dean pulls his t-shirt over his head. “Oh, I’m just peachy.”
“Cas, dude, if you dig right through that we’ll have to pay, you know. I know it’s not like it makes the place look any worse, but you need to chill out. We’re gonna get you back on two legs, okay, but in the mean time you may as well kick back and enjoy a little down time. It’s not like you can go back to the front lines like that, right? Anyway, you look like you could use a break, you seemed kind of twitchy earlier.”
"But you can't," Ollie says simply. "We are the fundamental forces of the universe, Castiel. There is no stopping us."
?" the winchesters snap together, and crowley turns to bobby with a smile.
he and emmy get closer after that; she starts calling him "cas" (which dean mostly blames on himself but really, what else is she supposed to call him? no sam, shut the fuck up.) and he starts teaching her what sounds like enochian as she learns english. she's a fast learner, probably because the angel in her already knows it or something. as a consequence cas gets closer to sam, bobby and dean again too, and they fall back into the old pattern with remarkable ease - by the time emmy's second christmas comes round they're pretty much back to what used to pass for normal. they don't talk about cas's brief stint as god or the preceding year, and they all pretend they never will. cas, unwilling to read bobby's extensive library of supernatural books both because he dislikes being reminded of his old life/the monster souls and because he doubts he will find anything of value, finds karen's old cookbooks and starts cooking. it's...an adventure, but he follows the instructions to the letter and it's not really
“Yeah, cause they’d just let Meg hand him over and walk free,” Dean fires back. “He’ll be

is ‘Zeke’?” Abaddon demands, and for a split second Dean thinks the angel was too weak, she’s still in him - then she slams into him, back in her old body again, and they both go crashing into the wall. It hurts like hell, and after a confused moment of wrestling Abaddon grabs him by the hair and punches his head into the concrete a couple more times. “You’ve got a fucking
“Do you want me to call Bobby?” she says patiently, and Dean nods jerkily, then takes a second to think and shakes his head.
Benny shrugs. "So're lions," he says evenly.
Dean’s soul is left to its own thoughts as most of Castiel’s focus turns to reviving his mortal body. Though the angel is invisible, the air at the edge of the clearing nearest to the rough-cut cross begins to shimmer.
Sam comes back with a couple of WalMart bags and a burger, which he drops in the middle of the table.
Dean thinks he should say sorry or something at this final proof of Cas’s fall, of his humanity, but it seems inadequate. Also, it’s not
it sang, far too relieved to have the rest of the school’s attention off him for a moment, but he knew it involved talking about how awesome each of the houses were and almost managed to sell him on Slytherin, and then it stopped and the eyes were back on them and Professor Flitwick stepped forward.
“Everyone in?” Hagrid called, and there were murmurs of assent. “Alrigh’ then - forward!”
They’ve spent so much time warning Emmy against angels and demons and reminding her to be on the lookout for them at all times that they may have neglected the more usual spiel about how some humans are also just as dangerous, and that even adults you’re meant to trust can be a threat.
of it is all he can hear. He feels numb, helpless, like he’s back with the grass under his knees and every nerve throbbing staring at the ground that just swallowed his brother. The angels have got Emmy; after everything God said, after everything Cas lost and Sam and Dean and Bobby gave, she’s gone. And Cas- Cas is probably already dead. It’s not like they have any reason to want him alive.

(misha walking her fingers up jen's wrist during some deep conversation, smirking cause it's not her coverage)
Dean spreads one hand flat over the long, smooth flight feathers where his stomach is. “So, feel better?”
The vamp she was mauling drags itself free, fortunately choosing saving its own bloodied skin over revenge, and Sam hacks off its head for its trouble. Another one has Dean pinned against a pillar but Iope is there, leaping up to get her hands where the ears would be around the leering mask and
“Well,” Gabriel says modestly, “I helped. A lot.”
sam is a lawyer and on track to become a partner when one of the current ones retires in a few years; he's married to jess and they have a little girl, annie (annabel) and are planning on more. michael is some kind of corporate something, possibly banking, dean's never really cared enough to find out, and is apparently married to his work, which gabe likes to tell him is unhealthy. nick's a lawyer, one of the nasty ones, who takes a lot of interest in sam; balthazar likes to refer to him and his long-term girlfriend as "lucifer and lilith" and dean has to remind himself that's not their actual names. gabe works in a bakery/confectionary (he makes their wedding cake) and always seems to smell like sugar. he and balthazar flirt outrageously and have done for years, sometimes despite girl- or boyfriends, but haven't yet, to anyone's knowledge, got it on. bathazar works in wine-tasting or something; mostly he seems to bum around europe and acquire money by magic. anna does a lot of charity work and seems to be deeply content with it; she especially loves working with kids in care.

I was always aware that posting this would be risky, because on the one hand I wanted to acknowledge Dean's past with Alastair, but on the other I know the Healing Cock trope is ridiculous whether it features actual cock or not, and on the third, mutant hand I really just wanted to write porn but couldn't because of point number one.
,” Cas says, low and intense and desperate, “it was all to keep you safe. All of it. You and Bobby and Sam, you’re all-”
Crowley raises his eyebrows. "What do you want me to do about it? Possess a brain surgeon and have a good old root around in there? It wouldn't do any good."
There’s that rustle of wings and Cas is standing just inside the doorway. Both Sam and Bobby jerk and scramble up to their feet. Cas is down to his shirtsleeves, the white no longer pristine and stained with stuff Sam really doesn't want to look at too closely, and he sounds exactly the same as ever when he says, “It’s a boy.”
“Grace,” St Claire replies absently, dipping the cloth back in the now reddish water and dabbing carefully at his wound. “Honour. Respectability. It’s the only thing I had ever thought to name my dragon, were I ever fortunate enough to have one.”
“There you go,” Dean says softly, and Tsalia nuzzles Iope’s flank, purring a little. Dean resists the temptation to go down there himself and stroke her, give her the human contact she craves, because there’s comforting your brother’s daemon when he’s a soulless

!” he snaps at her, hand spread protectively over his shoulder. “He’s not, you heard him! He’s
"Woah," Dean says when they're first introduced. "How's it feel to be the short one for once, Sammy?"
"I've already led you to him and helped you break him out, angel. Now you want me to help you shove Lucifer into a dark corner of his mind and make sure he stays there as well?"
“How many times has he turned up?” Sam asks, now looking concerned, and Dean waves his toast hand at him, mouth full.
alerted by some kind of angel alarm, Cas would have turned up, found the winchesters' souls missing (that's what destiny was about to tell dean), and freaked the fuck out, even knowing what had probably happened. meanwhile, dean would have met up with sam at destiny's, then gone on to meet desire (who beams at dean, all dark hair and lean lines), despair (who puts warm hands on dean's shoulders and stares sadly at him, then pats him and lets him go only to go and shake sam gently, pointedly, and touch his cheek, ring catching at his skin), and delerium, who's the one who finally lets cas through before turning to sam and telling him cheerfully that the cold man says hi, but she sent him away because he made her go all shivery and purple and she only wants to be green.
you bastard, it’s
the L word! Seriously, Cas has only just got Dean into bed, he’ll run a mile. No, I mean- you mean like if Dean had been a girl, Cas would’ve been straight? Doesn’t kissing Meg count? [audience makes dismissive noises] Oh, you didn’t like that? Well no, you guys would’ve liked him to be tonguing Crowley, right? Or Dean, obviously. I don’t think of Cas- he isn’t really gay
"No trouble, Cas can manage a hot chocolate. Right, Cas?"
"Thought she'd be a wolf," Dean responds, smoothing a hand down her flank. "Or a wolfhound, like my dad's."
“Uh, yeah, sure. If you can pay.”
The deathstick is Tsalia's idea. Dean is still too winded and stunned to be alive to get up quite yet, and she's fussing over the gashes inflicted by the bat-dragon thing now wheezing for air through a gaping throat on the other side of the clearing.
Dean presses a final kiss to the centre of Cas’s back, right between his wings, then drops his forehead down to rest against the skin, feeling Cas’s ribcage rise and fall as he breathes quick and deep, waiting. Dean closes his eyes, conscious of the wings on either side of him and the hushed ebb and flow of air beneath him, then, not letting himself think about it too much, he shifts backwards and trails his mouth down, following the ridge of Cas’s spine.
He turns and runs.
Behind them, Bobby makes an inarticulate noise and stomps back upstairs.
“It was definitely just you,” Sam says, sounding faintly amused again, and Dean flips him off.
Cas is in the study when Dean finds him, his stupid nerdy professor glasses on and his pen scratching over paper as he scribbles notes in his swoopy, calligraphic writing. Poll is curled up under the desk, scrunched up surprisingly small to make himself fit and breathing deeply. Dean leans in the doorway and just drinks it in, the normalcy of it all; Cas marking assignments with sarcastic little comments by every unforgivable mistake, whole and alive and with the dog at his feet, surrounded by bookshelves and solid walls.
“You they cannot ward against, Dean Winchester.” His hand comes up, and the next second they’re outside some abandoned house, covered in ivy and half falling down. It looks completely ordinary to Dean, who was expecting to see the same glowing blue designs he saw on that house where Alastair was holding the Reapers hostage - and then he remembers he wasn’t exactly in his body at the time.
Cas and Sam both turn to look at him, identical expressions of surprise on their faces.
He probably breaks speed limits getting there, and he knows he parks illegally at the Arrivals terminal, but he could give a fuck because Cas and his suitcase and his stupid trenchcoat are waiting for him, looking like some old-time detective, stubble and all, and Dean kind of tackle-hugs him, has a brief moment of empathy with those movie heroines who jump into their boyfriend’s arms, and just holds on.
“They’re not
“There’s a good boy,” she purrs, and stalks over to Sam. She pats roughly at his cheek. “Hey Sammy, c’mon, wakey wakey kiddo, got a lot to do,” she says, gruff, a passable imitation of him (like Sam’ll be fooled for a minute), and Sam’s eyes flicker open.
Dean is, at least, a proficient enough cook not to embarrass himself in front of a gentleman’s son, and after supper is eaten and Dean has checked that all the animals are well bedded down for the night they sit in surprisingly companionable silence, Castiel repairing the slashes in his coat and shirt with supplies pilfered by Dean from his mother’s sewing box, and Dean alternately reading a book and engaging him in conversation whenever he feels he has let the quiet linger too long, or his eyes have inadvertently strayed to the firelight gilding Castiel’s hair or lighting the line of his jaw.
taking you home," Dean says, finally drawing away, and takes Cas's wrist to pull him to the car.
. And then, wiping tears from his eyes, he reaches out and pats Cas on the shoulder, and Cas's actually sways like his knees almost buckled.
Cas pulls out and Dean hates everything in the world and shuts off the water (which does feel distinctly cool, fuck). He grabs his towel and turns to Cas, mouthing rather than talking because Sam will hear and then they’ll really be screwed.
Sam’s world starts crumbling when he hears Tsalia cough, sudden and startled, and go down, legs buckling beneath her.
A circle of lighter darkness opened up ahead, the stars glimmering at them like a welcome, and then they were out and the stone under their feet gave way to springy grass and the castle towering above them, huge and unbowed, and most of them were craning their heads back to stare as they went up the stone steps and Hagrid raised a fist the size of Dean’s head and knocked three times on the thick oak doors.
Jody Mills opens the door, takes one look at him, and says quietly, “Oh Sam.”
"They are merely impressions, the closest human eyes can come to seeing the glory of my true form," he says quietly, and Dean rolls his eyes, smirking a little.
"Hey, it's alright Adelaide. We don't bite, and neither do they," and he gestures to the dogs. "We do, however, fix cars." There's that smile again, his eyes flicking behind her, and there are footsteps that prompt her to turn just in time to take a neatly-folded knitted blanket from the other guy, 'Cas'. Unfolded, it's got Stitch on it and a bright Hawaiian backdrop, and when she burrito's herself into it it's soft and warm, if faintly scented with dog.
, it’s makin’ you a dick anyway! Ever since you got the fuckin’ thing you’ve had a broom up your ass, ‘s no fuckin’ wonder Gabe and Balthazar gave it up, it sucks the fuckin’ life outta you!”
“No,” Cas says curtly, still eyeing him up. “The Fae are very old and very powerful, and you shouldn’t have gotten involved.”
"he..." dean repeats, unable to get the rest of the words out, throat sticking. "he's down
more amusing when he's deprived of his playthings." He pauses, apparently expecting Castiel to speak, then continues. "Also, I know where he is. I can take you to him."
Someone taps on his window, and he blinks Sheriff Mills into focus, the band around his lungs easing a little.
The Dean outside can only stare, stunned, mental wheels spinning uselessly. What-? When-?
Eventually the muscle twitches annoy her though, or perhaps she just gets bored, but his vision flutters and the ache recedes while she turns her attention to other things. “Hmm,” she says with his voice, sounding pleased, and sits up, knocking her old body out of the way and stretching out his arm, examining his fingernails, flexing the muscles. She runs his hands over his chest and grimaces; down between his legs and squeezes, amused when it makes him snarl wordlessly at her inside his head and his body perk up, sensitized.
with the thing?" Dean snaps, and Crowley looks deeply smug.
“He’s trying to make the world better,” Tsalia bites out, ears flattened and teeth flashing with every word.
Apparently, reapers have got juice. Tsalia goes for his dropped sword and gets slammed across the room, hissing and scrabbling at the wood. The only other sword within reach is
Cas draws himself up, fists white at the knuckles, wings crooked like an angry bird. “You need to go Dean, before someone finds us. This was a stupid idea I should never have let you talk me into.”
"Why do you want to find it? You're already King of Hell."
“And just...don’t let anybody forget...how awesome we were. What we did.”
"Well she looks it to me. The only other dragons I've seen are up in the sky."
His fingers close into a loose half-circle and Dean turns blindly towards him, seeking his steadiness and the familiar scent of their sheets on warm skin. Cas’s hand slips down again so his arm can wrap obligingly around Dean’s waist, and when he guides Dean forward Dean lets himself be led, the last forty hours suddenly crashing over him like a wave and eyelids too heavy to open. Dimly he thinks he should be better than this, that he’s gettin’ old and soft and time was he’d have just grabbed some food, drunk a gallon of coffee and gone back for another shift, but then Cas unloops his hold and gives him a good shove and Dean falls back into softness like tiny baby angel clouds and his brain shuts down.
charlie finds them a case in a gay bar, where an incubus/succubus has been snacking on the clientele. she despairs over their attire and amuses herself listening to them (well, dean) arrange 'protection' for each other. she also introduces them to the barman, donally (who's also part-owner with his husband, oliver), who's genial and blue-eyed and shameless and would be played by john barrowman
Joshua blinks at him.
Jen: [after a beat, laughing] Jesus, Mish! You’re gonna cause minor earthquakes with that!
Dean sucks in a breath and narrows his eyes. It’s been a while since Cas last got pissed at him. “Oh, I think I understand just fine.”
you?" Sam breathes, and Ollie chuckles as Cas turns to look at him with wide eyes.

"Cause it's not as uncommon as you seem to think it is," Rufus continues, still glaring at him. "You boys knew Ellen Harvelle, god rest her - you think she was a nun after her Bill died? And poor Jasper was cut up something terrible after Jo died; he was still going by Yasmin then, and Jo was his rock as he figured it all out. He damn near fell apart without her."
“’S not a problem,” Dean says, not quite truthfully but honestly enough. “The Corps do enough for us.”
The journey up north was a lot pleasanter than Dean had thought it would be with Ash there to distract him. They bought a bunch of sweets off the food witch to supplement their packed lunches and played exploding snap for the new chocolate frog cards, leaving Ash with smudges across his forehead and Dean with the tip of his nose burnt pink.
“Free,” Dean murmurs, eyes on Sam’s.
"We're looking for the beach, how far away are we?"
"Hey, woah," Dean reassures her, a hand on her arm, "chill. Angels are real but they're 99% douchbags, and jury's still out on on the Big Cahuna himself. Bible's...uh, well, it's kind true in some bits-"
"What?" Dean demands.
"You have," Cas says heavily. "This is not Death. This is her brother, Destruction."
Castiel’s good shoulder lifts and falls again, and Dean can see all the muscles that contribute to the movement shifting under the skin. “I’ve never been much for the idle life.”
From all this she’d kind of assumed he’d be a slightly coarser version of Sam, in ripped jeans and a well-loved t-shirt with hair maybe long enough to tie up and a battered old tape player never far away, bandana in his back pocket and a twinkle in his eye.
He’s almost okay, Sam finds, if he only takes shallow breaths, doesn’t try and expand his ribcage too far and come up against what feels like a vice around his chest. In the dark he can see better too, the only light coming from the moon and maybe a little from the long trailing flares of the falling angels. One actually goes right overhead, crashing into the water nearby with a heavy splash, and Sam wonders if it’s like Cas, heavy clothes, suit and shoes and long coat dragging it down, impeding limbs that don’t even really know how to function in the first place.
“So, that’s three alphas down,” Bobby says slowly, fingers drumming over the picture of the latest ‘freak gas explosion’. “You

“Castiel?” he tries, soft, just in case, and isn’t surprised when he doesn’t get an answer, though he’s not hugely reassured either. It’s still not definitive proof Cas is with Dean, after all; Cas has openly expressed a preference to answer to Dean, even if it was born out of guilt and a desire not to see what he’d brought back from the Cage that wasn’t fully Sam. “Just, if you get this, and you’re with Dean...keep him safe for me, okay? And- and try and find a way back here, man, cause wherever you are, it can’t be worse than Hell, right? And you got us both out of there, so...so anything else should be easy. I don’t care if it takes time, okay, just come back safe. Both of you.” He pauses, then adds, feeling a little stupid, “uh, amen.”
then crowley turns up with a wounded angel, who they tie to a chair in a circle of holy fire and interrogate. turns out heaven is in complete turmoil - it was bad enough that was cas was claiming to be god, but now he's trying to replace them, and with a blasphemous halfbreed no less, the shit has really hit the fan. a bunch of angels distracted cas while a couple more snuck into the weapons cache cas and balthazar fought so hard to win back from raphael; they now have things that can do some damage. she insults cas a lot - apparently they used to be in the same garrison and she always knew cas would come to a bad end, associating with humans - but she also keeps interrupting herself to snarl about the "abomination" and needing to destroy it, and once they've got everything they think they need dean steps calmly through the fire and stabs her through the throat. "don't talk about my daughter like that, you self-righteous fuck."
“Cas was uh, also telling me how you got stuck with so many dogs.”
“Yeah, we came over here when I was little.” He left it at that and Ash nodded. ‘When I was little’ meant ‘after the Second War’, and everyone knew you didn’t pry.
"so your daddy's back and he's clearing out the trash, right?" dean snaps. "lucky for him we mostly did that for him. what about zachariah, huh? what about raphael? what about his precious michael?"
Hayley grins. “Oh yeah, you’re gonna love it! But when you phoned to say you were gonna be late, Mrs Graham said she’d take Emmy home herself cause she knew Cas’d be busy, so you’ll have to wait to see it ‘til you go pick her up from there.”
killjoys AU! Sam and Dean (Morningstar/Blood Junkie (Dean thinks it's funny) and Hellblazer, or more commonly, Morn and Blaze) run an autoshop out in the middle zones, fixing up vehicles (and other mechanical stuff) and repurposing/cannibalizing Drac bikes. Cas (Hell's Angel) was a Drac who got Dean out when the scarecrows caught him; he told Dean his full name, but since he's a wanted man Dean mostly calls him Thursday (Sam is a mythology geek, their mother used to tell them stories about angels). Bobby is their Dr D, Ash usually his messenger unless it's his step-daughter Jo (who kind of has a thing for Dean). They've a shifting roster of "angels" who go into Battery and get them stuff they need, never the same one twice.
“You implied earlier that you had intended to initiate this for a while,” Cas says eventually, and Dee sighs.
Her eyes are suspiciously bright, but then so are Bobby’s. Sam huffs a soft laugh. “Hey, no chick-flick moments.”
Dean wrinkles his nose and shrugs himself off the doorframe. “I did shower.”
“Perhaps it’s time you start delegating to others,” Risa says carefully, pretending she hasn’t heard the naked emotion in his voice. “Just because Cas is...out of action doesn’t mean you’re alone, Dean. There are other people who can help: me, Chuck, Ben, Garett, Kaleigh... I know it’s not the same, but we can take some of the pressure off you, stop you from feeling so...overwhelmed.”
"I’m good like this," she whispered back, when he asked her under cover of Sam watching cartoons that evening, licking a paw and scrubbing it over her ear. "We’re good, like this. People won’t fuck with us, and we can take care of Sammy. Chicks’ll think you’re all mature and shit cause I settled early, and everyone knows people with cat daemons are all mysterious and seductive." She’d flashed him a grin, all sharp teeth. "Try not to let ‘em down
“Y’don’t? How about,” and Bobby lowers his voice like Sam might hear, “all the Hell memories he’s assimilating in there? How about everything he remembers about two
There. The supply closet door isn’t shut.
All of which is to say: caveat lector, because Dean spends a good chunk of this being violently triggered back to his time in Hell and the sexual abuse he suffered there.
“Hey, I would never leave my baby to fend for herself like that!”
“After everything he did for you, you’re just gonna-”
“You’re damn right I would,” Cas says, hands smoothing absently down over Dean’s hipbones before he grabs the bottom of the undershirt and tugs. The bed shifts and rustles as Poll gets bored and jumps up too, sprawling out along the foot and watching them with his head on his paws. Dean listens to the soft flump as his shirt hits the floor and realises  that at some point he closed his eyes again. The fact that Cas is throwing everything on the floor instead of putting it in a neat little pile near the bathroom door says a lot about how he’s feeling right now.
"You can shove her off, it's fine," Dean tells her, but she shakes her head, enjoying the little warm weight against her hip, and he shrugs, eyes crinkling. "Your funeral. She’s not a great sleeper, so when you get sick of her just tell her 'Off' and she'll go."
would have no genetic bearing.”
Dean's just got four beers out the fridge in preparation for the movie when he hears it: a soft, involuntary moan, shuddery and helpless and unmistakably Cas.
I don't think I need to say where the chapter title came from :')
“Even as a cat, you’ve still got a stick up your ass,” Dean tells him a little while later, and Cas swivels his head slowly round to look at him, eyes narrowing in what’s either irritation or puzzlement. Probably both. Dean nudges a careful foot into his chest. “

The angel Castiel shatters the final barriers of the Pit and emerges into the sunlight, the shockwave felling trees and terrifying birds into flight. The raw, torn soul the angel carries stirs, sensing the presence of its earthly vessel nearby; the flesh is badly decomposed and rotten, disintegrating further even as Castiel observes it, and though pulling this soul from Perdition is a victory, the mission is not complete until Dean Winchester is returned not just to Earth, but to life.
It’s probably a mark of something drastic that Dean just shrugs, drops his duffel on the table and sinks into the chair. “Okay, so...what then? What’re we gonna do now? ‘S not like we’ve got any marketable skills.”
"Where?" Dean asks, turning, listening, and gets the rustle of leaves and the eager thudding footfalls of things that don't care if their prey hears them coming.
“He’s not
"Know
Gabriel turning up in a party hat and throwing a handful of confetti at the boys because he says he's celebrating his little brother's promotion. Dean's all "Someone put Balthazar in charge of stuff?!" and Gabriel snorts and says even Heaven's democracy isn't that stupid, and Sam's all "...Cas?" When Cas shows up they make him show them his new wings, and he gets all bashful.
Okay then.
“Well I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but there’s kind of a lot of crap to be scared of right now.”
Sam comes to and scrambles to get himself upright, Iope squeaking indignantly as he almost crushes her against the wall and he apologises, one hand burying itself in her fur as he stares at Cas incredulously. “Cas. You’re okay?”
The guy is taller than Sam, and honestly that's saying something.
He cranes his head back and twists himself round, rucking the sheet up even further, and finds that his wrist is connected to the headboard by a very familiar blue tie.
"Well okay, but if it became his name-"
Dean blinks at him a few times, then impatiently grabs him by the shoulder and spins him round. They’re still not proper wings, stuck somewhere between solid and transparent, and they’re kind of shining, each individual feather outlined in light. They’re big and imperfect, notched and a little disarrayed, but that seems about right, given the normal state of Cas’s hair and all, and Dean's reaching for them before he can think. His hand goes right through, touching the softness of the trenchcoat instead, warm from Cas's bodyheat, and Cas casts an amused look at him over his shoulder.
Dean rolls his head sideways just to prove he can, squinting up at him. “Uh, no? Just got one hell of a lump on the back of my head. Ow.” Sam helps him up and he leans into him unashamedly. “What you
Iope finds them like that, later. She skitters off to call to Sam and then comes back, little hands flexing, unsure. The tears stopped some time ago and now Dean’s just staring blankly ahead, he and Tsalia breathing in sync. She’s curled around him like a huge house cat, her head on his shoulder, one big paw on his chest.
“That a wand in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me,” Dean murmurs, nipping at his lower lip, his hand curving around Cas’s hip and down to the front of his trousers, and Cas hitches in a breath as Dean’s palm smooths over his cock. He surges forward, hands falling from Dean’s hips to smack onto the desk with a faint sizzle, and the kiss breaks so he can bury his face in Dean’s shoulder as his wings snap out with a rush of air and the dry, silky rustle of scales. “Mmm yeah, there you go baby,” Dean purrs, dropping his other hand down to stroke the bottom edge of one of the wings, the scales soft and smooth under his fingers, and Cas chokes off a moan and sucks at his neck, probably hard enough to leave a mark and thank god it’s winter and he has an excuse to wear a scarf-
"she is...unique," joshua says slowly. "castiel no doubt meant to simply rehouse his remoulded grace in a new vessel and leave the child in your care to learn free will as he did, but in making a new life he also created a new human soul, as in all acts of creation. when he added the grace, which had rebuilt itself anchored by dean's soul and had so recently been ripped from that support, it sought this new soul instead."
"Possessing a human," Sam clarifies at her round eyes. "He didn't know at the time."
“Yeah well lady, my job’s on an upswing,” he mutters, thinking about the vampire world domination plan and the skinwalker sleeper cells and now this whole ‘Mother’ thing. It doesn’t really bear thinking about for too long though, so he shoves it all aside and zaps the channels round until he finds gunshots, then settles in and turns his brain off. In the corner of his eye, Cas is watching the screen intently.
“Oh, I’m not-” Dean starts, ducking his head, and St Claire huffs, then draws a harsher breath as he begins to work at the dried blood crusted at the edges of the wound. “What does it mean, Conesta?” Dean asks, to distract him. “Sam - that’s my brother - he’s the Latin scholar in the family.”
“Bad dream,” Sam says thickly, hand still curled into a fist around Dean’s t-shirt sleeve. “...Sorry.”
They say their goodbyes to Mrs Greenburg, then head three doors down to the Larson's, where Mr Larson's silver Ford is languishing in the driveway. The woman who answers their knock does indeed have a yellowed bruise on her cheekbone, and eyes them warily from behind a door still mostly shut. "Can I help you, officers?"
“So, no white light or bleeding eardrums?” Sam asks, stroking a finger down the baby’s arm and over the back of his tiny curled hand.
The title for this one was hard to figure out, so in the end I went with a line from "Happiness" from the musical Scrooge, one of my dad's favourite films and a song that popped into my head and seemed appropriately wistful (most songs with 'happiness' in the title are, surprisingly, bouncy and cheerful and that was too much mood whiplash).
"so she's...half-human half-angel? Like...nephilim?" sam asks, and joshua shakes his head.
"It's the same with the rest of the animals," Cas continues, lighter now, pouring the hot chocolate into a tall mug for her. It's pink, with white patterns threading through it.. "Sam has a friend, Muriel, and she regularly comes across animals in need of a home. Sam is unable to say no to her." He passes her the mug and perches on the stool opposite her, folding his hands on the surface. Fergal shuffles over and offers him the bowl, and Cas takes it with a quiet thank you and a brief stroke of the dog’s ears.
“It’s better now. Did I wake you?”
“Emmy wanted to practice painting her nails on someone else, and Dean objected.”
"Oh yeah, fucking dig up
“Who else was there?” It’s not like it changes anything, but he’d feel better about knowing names, distinctions to mark them out from the rest of the Heavenly flock.
Sam stares down at it himself, jaw set against the pain. “I- it’s just a
and does as he's told, pillowing his head on his arms. Dean hesitates for the briefest of seconds, then rolls his eyes at himself and plants a knee on the mattress by Cas's thigh, swinging himself over so he's straddling Cas's body. Cas takes a breath, about to say something, and Dean taps a fist against his ribs. "You're wound tighter than a goddamn alarm clock dude, your shoulders are like freakin'

Dean's daemon Tsalia is a
“Smartasses don’t get laid,” she informs him, probably undermining it by rolling her hips down against him on her next breath. He curls his fingers, clutching at her waist and leaning up to kiss her again.
Dean tucks his other arm under his head and hums agreeably. “Yeah well, I am pretty awesome.”
"what do you want?" dean snaps, aware that emmy isn't freaking out so he must be okay, and joshua watches her for a moment before returning his eyes to dean.
“Yeah, seems so.”
dean comes back from getting take out or something to find sam laughing at the tv. relieved, dean kicks the door to make sam let him in, and sam turns it off and comes to open the door. later, dean flicks it on out of boredom and is greeted by a blast of static
Blood is the most difficult part, as much of Dean’s has soaked into the floor of the house in Indiana. Castiel is tired now, grace waning fast, but the mission must be completed. Dean’s heart stutters to life, electricity shooting along the rebuilt nerves, and with every beat more blood surges through the repaired vessels, circulates to the healthy new organs. In the dark of the coffin, Dean’s death-grey skin flushes with colour.
, not a rampaging psychopath.” They both turn to look at Cas, who’s paused in his pacing to watch them, tail still restless and fur bristling in annoyance, stare as intense as ever and now slightly wild around the edges. A kind of slow, rhythmic crackle starts up, and they realise his claws are raking against the cheap motel carpet. “...Yeah, okay, I’ll stay.”
with each other, he has never manhandled anyone he was having sex with like that in his entire
dead, it will
"No, jesus-"
and grab Cas by the hip, roll him over and kiss him breathless, hands running out over his wings. But no, Cas needs this and he'll damn well finish what he started, and before he can think better of it he pulls Cas's nearest leg up into his lap and spans his hand over the top of Cas's thigh, rolling his fingertips and kind of kneading a little at the flesh beneath them. Cas exhales in a muffled rush, twitching under Dean's hand like he was expecting something else, and Dean can't help a smirk. That makes two of them then.
"Going twice."
in bed, and then twitches again and draws in a slow breath because fuck if he isn’t getting hard anyway.
"Why don't you call him Emmanuel?"
He’s just debating whether he should try and rouse it when he catches movement, something stirring on its back, and for a terrified moment he thinks perhaps some enemy combatant was still locked in battle with it as it fell and is just now regaining enough sense to try and finish the job, when his brain catches up with his eyes and he realises it can only be the poor creature’s captain, probably knocked silly by the fall. Aviator green flickers in and out of view, and then with a groan there’s the sound of the man slithering down the opposite flank and hitting the ground.
Cas raises his eyebrows at him, still moving loose and easy, the stick not yet back up his ass. “Can I help you with something, Dean?”
It's motherfucking glorious, too fast to be teasing but too slow to be rushed, and Dean's riding the upward surge of orgasm just nicely when Cas laps over the head, hot and velvet-soft and amazing, then pulls away. Dean possibly makes a broken little sound and grabs for him, and Cas huffs, leans his cheek against Dean's inner thigh, and strokes his thumb over that strip of thin, sensitive skin just behind Dean's balls. "May I try something?"
"He's...decimation. Utter ruin. The end of all things. Total anihilation."
Dean is idly watching TV and considering maybe wandering round 'til he finds a bar - maybe play a little pool or something, they could use the extra money - when there's that clatter of wings and Cas is standing in the middle of the room, head bowed. His eyes are closed and he's maybe even swaying a little, and Dean is out of his seat and supporting him with a hand on his chest and his arm round his shoulders before Cas has a chance to actually fall.
, okay, I’ll probably get burned at the stake if they see you acting like-” and waves a hand at him.
is and Cas apparently can’t tell him. And Dean...it seems logical to believe that he and Cas are in Purgatory, together, with Dick and all the other monster souls Cas coughed back up, but without Cas or Death or Crowley and his ritual Sam can’t help him either, and in any case he might be wrong and Dean could be anywhere, Limbo or Hell or even Heaven.
after some debate, they call her mary ellen winchester, "emmy" for short. sam claims "jo(anna)" for his future hypothetical kids. (also on the list: "anna", “karen”, "deanna" (though dean claims it's creepy and sam was mostly joking. maybe as a middle name though), "madison", "jessica", "pamela", “lisa”)
Jesus fuck,
“He always has. He told you, when you visited him.”
codas:
Cas doesn't hug him back, holds himself stiff like he's suspicious or unsure of what to do, but the bird-daemon presses back against Tsalia's cheek, crooning, and Dean pulls away to take Cas in, somewhat bedraggled but clear-eyed and whole.
After a moment, Dean draws his arm out from under Cas’s head with a groan. “Damn Cas, you need to lay off the burgers,” he murmurs, shaking the pins and needles out, and Emmy zaps away so he can slide carefully along the couch and off, leaving Cas there. He goes to join Emmy in the armchair and they sit there in the quiet and listen to Cas breathe, smooth and even.
"Ah, you're after the other one this time. Collecting the set, are we? You should have told me you were coming, I'd have made cookies."
And in the end it’s Tsalia who capitulates, rolling over and exposing her throat in one smooth move that Dean echoes in dropping to his knees.
“Ain’t she a beauty,” Hagrid sighed beside them, then cleared his throat and continued, louder and stronger: “Right, into the boats with yeh, but no more’n four to a boat.”
), but in a way it’s nice to know they at least noticed he’s gone. No one comes up to tell him how they’re thinking of him after the loss of his brother.
"That doesn't mean you should rule it out."
“And listen, okay, I’m summoning Joshua, it’s the only way we’ll know- he can do that angel-locating thing and figure out where they are. I’m sorry, but I can’t wait, Emmy might- you know what they think of her. So uh, if I’m not there when you get back, get Josh on the line. And
Cas said to Dean: "You are worthy, you deserve [good things]"
“Look, I’m sorry,” he blurts, “about the French thing, Captain St Claire, I just, I wasn’t-”
, looking his usual serene and implacable self. Dean really,
“Dean...” Jo says quietly, “do you want me to phone the uh, the airport? To check? I mean, it might not- he-”
, Dean.” Something, some tone, some inflection on his name, sounds eerily like Cas when he was pissed, and Dean wonders when the hell his daemon started sounding more like his angel than him. “Castiel raised you from Perdition and then he remade me from the atoms of myself, and because of him
“Dean,” Sam says softly, crouching down beside them and Tsalia stirs, slithers off to one side where Iope immediately wraps all four legs and her tail around her, murmuring too low to hear. Dean lifts his head. His eyes are red, and Sam knows that flatness to his gaze. He won’t make Dean say it. “Hey,” he says instead, kneeling down properly, and Dean’s head falls against his chest like it’s too heavy to hold up, arms coming slowly up around Sam’s back and then just getting tighter until he’s clinging, face buried in Sam’s shirt.
The thing is, Cas took to sex like a duck to water, and as soon as he understood that it basically just involved creative use of hands and mouth and a lot of naked skin, Dean never stood a chance. At first it was kinda funny cause Cas looked at him like a science investigation, all earnest interest and careful experimentation, but pretty soon after that Cas seemed to somehow figure him out, and ever since then it’s been Dean feeling embarrassingly like a teenager again as Cas hits every single spot and then finds a few he didn’t even know he had.
"Yes, every time I go outside there a frog waiting just outside the door, staring at me. I always pick them up and put them under the bush, I can't stand the thought of killing them, but I really have no idea where they're coming from. And they always seem to be trying to get into the house." She tucks her hair behind her ear and offers Dean another cookie and a small smile. "Of course, if my husband finds them it'll be a different story."
Dean makes Sam open the door on New Year’s Day, and they find a row of metal buckets. Then they look up and see the grass.
, Dean, you-”
Cas snorts, probably more at his quality of speech than what he said, and Dean cracks his eyes open enough to see him rise up and climb onto the bed with him, skirting around him and hooking his arms under Dean’s so he can haul him properly up onto the bed. Dean leans back against his chest and watches Poll fusing around the room like something’s changed since he was last in here.
[Misha leans back in his seat, smirking]
Hayley’s messy blonde head is visible over by the fence, bending down to say goodbye to a couple of kids, so Dean inches his way out of the car and heads over, telling himself that he’s being an over-protective, paranoid son of a bitch as he goes and still glancing left and right in case Emmy’s there and he’s just missed her.
, and if Cas would just fucking do that once more with a little more pressure he won't be thinking about anything at all.
Cas huffed out the sigh of the extremely put-upon but toed off his shoes and socks, coming to sit down a good few feet away and concentrating fiercely on rolling up his trousers. Dean rolled his eyes and shuffled himself closer.
, what the fuck is with you today?”
Dean stares at him, and when he swallows it feels like Cas’s hand on his chest is crushing him, making it hard to breathe. “You- you already made a deal?”
“Impressive.”
Dean snorts but drops it. Sometimes that distinction is a little hard to remember, when his memory has Sam and his giant shoulders and his dumb girl-hair right there with him, even if he did hold himself all wrong.
The TV’s on but neither of them are watching it, though it provides some welcome background noise; Sam’s got a bottle of beer he’s sipping at distractedly, Bobby a tumbler of scotch he keeps tapping his fingernails against as he pretends to read, though he’s been on the same page since he opened the book. There’s no sound from downstairs, not even the faint echo of Dee yelling profanities at Cas for what he’s putting her through, and Cas apparently hasn’t seen fit to come and update them - rationally, of course, it’s because he doesn’t want to break the angel wards, but it’s also quite possible that Dee’s forbidden him to leave her since this is all his fault.
dean stares at him.
Dean’s voice is a fragile thread, but Sam summons a smile for him, the ghost of a laugh. “Yeah.”
"Okay, names!" he declares, after a moment of just basking in the firelight and the smell of cooking and Cas sat across from him, everything just as it should be. "There any other Enochian you like?"
“At least take the shoes off before you fall on your ass and Sam comes crashing in thinking I’m being attacked in the shower again,” Dean orders, already shoving his hands underneath both coat and jacket, and abruptly they’re gone and Cas is barefoot and in just his shirt and pants. “No,
Dean bares his teeth. “Yeah well, whatcha you gonna do?”
Cas frowns. "What about me?" Dean gestures at his groin, and Cas's eyes narrow further. "You think I'd still seek my own pleasure when you're no longer comfortable enough to achieve your own?"
"what?" jen asks, matching her expression, then, louder, "there! you got it! can we have lunch now?!"
died and went to Hell. Samuel was willing to give Sam and me up to Crowley if it just got Mom back; his own
Tsalia nudges her head closer. “I’m sorry.”
“Dean,” Cas says, low and final, and then Dean’s got wet, body-warm fabric plastered against his front and slick tiles at his back and yeah, okay, so he’s been half-hard since he heard Cas’s wings, Pavlovian and inevitable. It’s not like he’s never got off in the shower before. Sam can just deal with the wait.
"Demons," he says, like they don't already know. "Meg..."
Cas looks embarrassed. "I don't...call him anything."
Bobby comes to stand by Sam and just looks, drinking the baby in with soft eyes and a helpless smile. “Y’alright, Dee?” he asks gruffly.
“It’s the twelve days of Christmas, Dean,” Sam says from the doorway behind him, sounding like Dean’s too dumb to live, and Gabriel flourishes a hand at him.
Dean throws himself at her, at the sense of her lounging around outside the little prison he’s been banished to inside his own damn head, and she laughs and bats him away and holds him down like a cat tiring of a mouse.
"Are you sure?" Cas asks, sounding uncertain now. "We can think about it further, if you want."
Dean meets him at the top of the stairs, making Castiel start halfway up. "I'm sorry Dean, did we wake you?"
Cas's skin is warm under Dean's hands; he always runs hot, probably something to do with the Chrysler building-sized angel all coiled up inside. Sometimes, it's a little hard to remember that the angel Castiel is merely borrowing this body, that the windswept hair and the curious eyes and the low, deliberate voice aren't his; that this creature Dean has grown to care for so much is really insubstantial and unbearable, a flare of light and raw power.
," Cas counters, "but neither are you the same as you were."
Cas blinks, but reaches out and touches the tear, which...isn’t there any more. Neat. They’ve ruined Cas’s clothes too many times to count (no seriously, there’s something so
, and that being near him made her feel wrong too, and from then on, even when they’re out in public, Sam’s been acting like she doesn’t exist.
“You, uh- you gonna introduce us?” Dean asks once they’re alone, gesturing awkwardly at the new daemon, and Cas stops doing impossibly bendy things with his limbs and blinks at him.
He ends up needing the wheelbarrow to carry everything, and by the time he gets back the dragon’s tail is lashing at the ground, muscles twitching and shuddering in pain, and its head is rolling in its Captain’s lap as it cries. He’s doing his best to reassure it, speaking low and calm and comforting, but his voice breaks a little every time it whines and its eyes are wide open and glassy, unseeing and uncomprehending. Dean remembers Imp when she had colic, thrashing about in her stall and resisting every attempt to calm her down enough to get close enough to get her up until his father had fought his way to her head to bridle her, taking a hoof to the skull in the process.
“No,” Dean says shortly, sitting down so he can pull on his socks.
“Uh, thanks,” Dean says, ignoring him and speaking to Cas. “It’s, uh...been memorable.”
“Yeah, I bet he did,” Sam says, amused, and Cas shrugs with one shoulder.
Cas has turned to look at Bobby, but Bobby is holding up his hands. "Oh no, don't even
“Bethany,” he says, just like his daughter, and smiles a little, soft and welcoming. His voice is unexpectedly deep, and rough like he’s been slaving over the barbeque and breathing its smoke for hours. “It’s nice to meet you.” He comes round to their side and holds out a hand, but when she takes it he doesn’t shake, just squeezes a little then lets go again. His hands are soft and warm. “Sam’s told us a lot about you.”
, but she can heal him if this all works out and the important thing is that the circle is broken. The ropes snap off her like ribbons and the cut on her forehead, as well as the abrasions left by the rope at the corners of her mouth, vanish.
"Oh, you can't get rid of him now, he's got your taste."
“Back seat,” she says, releasing his thumb with a gentle nip of teeth, and stretches over him so she can pop the door. He makes a quiet little amused noise, and then there’s that rustle of displaced air and he’s there. She twists so she can glare at him, and even in the dark she can hear him smile.
“Well you know, Cas can dreamwalk or whatever, thought maybe he might’ve showed up for another round of ‘lick my boots, puny ants’, but if it was just me then...”
in there!
,” Dee mutters next to him, although whether it’s pain or annoyance at him or Cas or herself Sam doesn’t know. However, the way she’s crushing his hand indicates it might be the former.
was okay,” Dee corrects, peeling herself away from him to settle back against the car too. She doesn’t let go of his hand though. “It might be some kind of mutant physically for all we know.”
, a voice that sounds remarkably like Cas’s says in his head, and Dean drags his finger out sideways.
“Yeah,” Sam says, muffled, and doesn’t let go.
, body arching and falling like a wave against Dean’s, and Dean’s hand pushes up from his throat to his jaw, canting his head up for another kiss, then it slides down again and urges him onto his knees.
“Uh, happy late Christmas guys,” Dean mutters, stepping back, and the birds all hop back over and tuck in.
The Impala purrs back into the driveway an hour or so later when it’s closer to full dark, everything twilit and peaceful, and Dean and Cas come meandering back up to the house together, bumping shoulders every few steps. Sam’s found some chunky soup and rice in the pantry and they eat together on chipped and mismatched plates, Dean’s delight infectious.
“The other prefects-” Cas starts, shuffling forward a few steps in obedience to the pull at his throat, and Dean rolls his eyes.
Dean looks back over at the daemons, dog-piled together, the flames picking out Tsalia and Iope's fur in different hues and gilding the bird-daemon in molten colours, like a phoenix. Fitting, given Cas's unfortunate habit of dying on them and then popping back up again a little later, though he's been good about sticking around lately. Trying his hand at being human, house and family and daemon and all. A new start, a blank slate, forgetting all the other shit he did and that was done to him. And though it all started with Jimmy's spaniel-daemon trotting at his heels, Dean can't imagine him now without that deadly little bundle of feathers on his shoulder, fluttering and preening and slashing monster's faces open while shrieking like a banshee. And all because some crazy lady went for a walk in the woods and found a naked guy lying by the lake.
Dean goes still, then struggles to get free so he can see, but Cas is clinging, using him to stand up, the arms he has around them the only things keeping him upright, and Dean can't let him go now.
“Okay,” Bobby says flatly, smacking both hands down on the table. “I was fine with the tree, cause I figure a little fresh fruit never hurt anybody, not to mention you can make pear cider and the wood’s good for carvin’, but I did not sign up for a complete remodel. I got a business to run here, and while one little fruit tree makes it look all homely or whatever psychology shit, this ain’t a botanical garden.”
of family loyalty, and a decent amount of courage, especially where they’re concerned. Interesting. Hufflepuff would do you quite nicely, I think, but you aren’t so sure, are you?” Dean thought briefly of all the famous Aurors who’d been in Gryffindor; thought of his father, locked away in his study poring over their mother’s old school books and those he was gradually accumulating on the Dark Forces and the two Wizarding Wars. “Well, yes,” the hat agreed, “and you’re not wrong, you’d do perfectly well in Gryffindor, I just think Hufflepuff is a better fit. I will, of course, put you there if you wish, but Gryffindor is hardly the only house to produce great witches and wizards, and that is a rather silly thing to base your choice off. Yes? Well then, off you go to HUFFLEPUFF!”
They stay like that, after Cas has stopped rocking back into Dean’s fingers. As far as the Dean watching can tell they’re not talking, just sitting there, holding each other up. And Dean has to admit it surprises him, because from what he’s seen this Dean and this Cas have no particular fondness for each other; shared history, yes, and trust of a kind, despite all Dean’s jabs about Cas’s drug use, but this?
"So it bothers you? Okay, so let's think of something else."
Dean manoeuvers the Impala into an empty space and cuts the engine, scanning the crowd of kids and parents swarming around the kindergarten car park for any sign of Emmy, maybe waiting for him with another carefully geometric fingerpainting clutched in her hand. Other families stream past the windshield, cheerful little kids’ voices chattering about their day, and he frowns over at the building’s doors, now closed, feeling the first paranoid stirrings of worry.
interruptions, and then catch an entire
you’ve been doing, mooning over the radio like it’s gonna start playing that Beiber kid or something. You’ve gotta get over this, Tsalia. He’s not coming back.”
"Sam will meet us there. I expect your angel will find a way to you as well, in due time."
, and stumbles over to her crib. she blinks back at him, lifts her arms towards him, and he grabs her up and cradles her to him, burying his face in her fine hair. "emmy, sweetheart, jesus you just saved our asses, knew we kept you round for a reason, emmy emmy
," and Cas reaches across and hauls him closer, "you endured tortures for more than your own lifespan. It's understandable that they have left their mark. But their lingering effects are

him like he’s some waif of a chick. Dean almost pulls away to boggle at him, but then Cas’s dick is nudging at him, slick and hot, and he’s sliding back inside, and Dean has to concentrate on not moaning like a porn star as all his nerves light up like Christmas.
“I gave you an extra five minutes, Dean. Now c’mon, out, before I come in there and drag you.”
"I know."
He kills it easily enough - it's just a dumb brute, apparently hungry enough to attack blind, and for its trouble it gets a knife through the roof of its mouth - but there's another one behind him and a third has Tsalia on her back, though she's gutting it with every kick of her hind legs, and he can hear more coming. He backs up as far as he can, gets within a few feet of her, then shuts his brain off and fights for their life.
But there’s no rustle of wings, even under the rasp of Sam’s breathing and the rushing in his ears. And then, over and behind Dee’s head, there’s a spark against the night sky, a comet or something burning up in the atmosphere, with another one off to the right and higher up. Sam blinks, slow, brain fuzzy, because it seems like maybe that’s important, a sign like in medieval times, Dee praying and getting shooting stars in answer, more and more of them blossoming into life, bigger than usual and
“Sorry, I thought you just said you wanted to keep us safe?”
, boy.”
“The angels,” Dee breathes, stunned. “They’re falling. Oh god, Cas, what did you do?”
“Welcome to Hufflepuff basement,” Caleb announced, coming in himself. Behind him, Dean saw that the barrel had sealed itself shut. “This is where everyone hangs out after lessons to do homework or when it’s too cold to go outside. And this is
“Jesus was baptized fully clothed,” Cas says absently, already crowding in closer with a squeak of shoes on the bathtub floor, and Dean darts a glance at the closed door through the shower curtain then gives it up as lost cause. It’s not like arguing with Cas usually gets him very far anyway.
“Don’t-” the breath Dean draws is rasping, and when he coughs it back out his mouth flecks dark. “Don’t pine away for me. Go find Eileen. Go see Bobby, and Charlie, and Jody. Get out and...live a normal life.” Another round of wet coughing, Dean fighting for every breath.
It’s something like one in the morning when he arrives at the cabin, and he crashes out on the first bed he finds and sleeps like the dead. It’s only in the morning that he realises this is - was - Dean’s bed when they holed up here to wait for his leg to heal, and if he turns his face into the pillow in the futile hope that some remnant of his brother might still linger, there’s no one to see.
“How what?” Dean asks, and watches with interest as Sam’s shoulders go tight.
later, back at bobby's/at the motel, sam sits down beside her, tells her carefully, gently that he and bobby are on her side whatever she chooses, and dee slumps into him and says blankly "how can i be a mom sam, i'm a fuckin' alcoholic who hunts monsters. not to mention that this," and her hand flattens under her bellybutton, "isn't exactly a full-on human either". she goes on - "what the fuck we don't even have a place to live, what about money, what about FOOD this kid can't live on greasy diner food sam it's a fuckin' BABY, oh wait no it's a fucking ANGEL what if it possesses me what if it rips me open what if it's born with wings or fifty thousand eyes or ON FIRE WHAT IF IT'S THE SECOND COMING oh god oh god. what if i'm like dad? what if i die, or just have to leave it because we have to save the world again or just because there's this one wendigo i have to gank before it kills again" - and sam listens and makes soothing noises and interjects when necessary that they wouldn't let that happpen/let her do that, and finally dee drops her head onto his shoulder and is all "...guess i'm keping it then."
gonna help me because everything’s still a little bit...lurchy. Okay?”
cas rescues dean (from a storm? a car crash?) but all dean remembers is dark hair and wings, a voice saying "you're safe now, dean" and a hand pressing to his shoulder. he goes to zachariah, who takes his grace [and his voice, b/c blah blah with his grace goes his true voice?] and sets him down on earth. misadventures ensue, esp as cas's friends anna, gabriel and balthazar are offering helpful suggestions via angel radio for making dean fall in love with him. then dean finds michael on the beach, dark haired and smiling at him and the grace round his neck makes the handprint come up white on his shoulder. sam is unconvinced, seeing how cas reacts when he finds out, but dean is so bobby starts organising the official betrothal announcement or w/e. michael finds a way to like, lock cas in his rooms or something, and without wings he can't fly out and the other three can't help cause they're unvesseled, but somehow he gets out anyway and crashes the not!wedding and rips the grace away from michael's neck and dean realises it was him that saved him...then zachariah pops up all "castiel, don't interfere in things that don't concern you," and blah blah blah battle where dean uses cas's angel sword to kill zachariah. and then they get married and live happily ever after.
“You can’t force me to do what I cannot.”
“All of it,” Cas says, and stands up so he can sweep it all onto the floor, “so please don’t tread on it.”
Transfiguration went about fifty times slower than usual without Cas next to him, though Professor Turner did ask where he was and remarked that he hoped Cas hadn’t set fire to anything between the classroom and the Hospital Wing.  Dean assured him from between clenched teeth that no sir, he hadn’t, and Professor Turner dismissed the conversation and started the day’s lecture, while Dean spent the next fifteen minutes remembering the heat coming off Cas by the end, like he was some kind of human furnace, and the desperate fingerprints scorched into various door frames as he fought to stay upright.
He opens the door, and it’s like Narnia or some shit, a whole ‘nother world that hits him like a physical blow, the sudden blast of sound like turning on a radio with the volume all the way up. The drummers and pipers are back, kind of playing together, and the noise is making all the animals go nuts; couples are doing some kind of swing dance in the free space where the animals aren’t, and right smack in the middle is the familiar trenchcoat, Gabriel beaming behind him with his arms spread wide.
value being a prefect! That's why!"
"God jesus fuck yes," Dean says in a rush, and Cas's mouth twitches in either amusement or irritation before he leans in and fastens it over the crown of Dean's cock. Dean's gotten a lot of head in his life, and when they started this Cas was kind of weird about it, attentive but not so much enthusiastic as intrigued; once he got over the science-experiment newness of it all though he improved rapidly, and after realising this was one thing Dean wasn't gonna complain about him using his mind-reading powers for, he's become downright
Cas's hand curves across the top of Dean's arm, unerringly lining up to the handprint under Dean's sleeves, and Dean's attention is immediately back on him, arm warming and fizzing with what feels like pins and needles. He opens his mouth to ask what Cas is gonna do, but Cas rumbles, "Close your eyes Dean," and he can only obey. A second later, with a low murmur of Enochian, Cas's thumb presses lightly over his right eye, then his left, and instead of the usual darkness his vision glows like the sun is in his eyes, almost but not quite enough to make him flinch. When he opens his eyes, Cas is staring at him, the slightest of smiles on his lips, and his wings are settling back to his shoulders.
." His hand sweeps over, picks up the invisible puppy, releases it's impromptu muzzle and drops it against Sam's chest. Sam's hands instinctively come up to catch it, despite the look of disgust on his face, and then a bloody crescent opens up at the base of his thumb and he swears, hands flying apart but the puppy apparently hanging on, judging by the way he's flailing his hand around. Crowley sniggers.
“Okay then,” Dean says, going over to offer Sam a hand up, “let’s get this show on the road. Sam, you okay to walk? No dizziness, concussion...?”
“Will be jealous you get my hot ass when you’re meant to be getting bored poking round empty classrooms.”
“What, does he think I’m gonna do a Britney and divorce him?” Dean asks indignantly, and Balthazar shrugs.
Dean snorts. "I'm just saying dude, it's okay to be kinda pissed you didn't get off. I sure am."
“Then He should get His holy fucking ass down here!” Dean explodes. “It’s His fucking law they’re breaking, they’re His kids, He should sort it out!”
Misha:  [smirk] Oh yeah. It’s always a good day when you get to beat up your co-star.
"Oh my god," Charlie breathes. Then, after a moment: "Wait, does that mean
"I mean, that was you, right? Or an aspect of you, the human you, and now he's gone but that was kind of his daemon too, right? So he's named after you, not Heaven, but also he's named after a dead guy, a good guy, a guy who helped people-"
"yeah? and how're you gonna do that?" dean sneers, glancing theatrically round the warehouse, and cas smiles that creepy smile of his.
“Yeah, cause smiting motivational speakers really helps with that!”
Either Cas is a fast learner or she’s an excellent teacher; either way, he gets good fast and then she just
"How the fuck does this-"
“Hi,” Bethany says, returning her smile and raising a hand in a wave. “Can I call you Emmy?”
"in taking in the souls of purgatory he sacrificed his grace to their monstrous hunger, then tore out the remnants and used them to create the...child you are holding. even putting all his crimes aside, he no longer has the grace of the lord within him; he cannot stay in heaven."
“Where the fuck are they?” Dean growls, pushing himself off the Impala, and Joshua meets him halfway, jaw set and eyes furious.
, Dean snaps.
"Yeah, thanks Ma," Dean says sarcastically, but doesn't let his grip slacken. Somewhere under his ribs something aches and burns at Tsalia's distance, but he can bear it, uses it to help keep him awake, and he's rewarded when she comes back with something bloody and curved in her mouth. She drops it at his feet (and Dean can't quite shake the visual of a dog with a bone, though he does just about manage to turn his laugh into a cough) and comes up to crowd against his chest again, twisting to inspect his wounded arm and grunting in satisfaction when they find it's clotted.
, Dean,” Sam says patiently, amused, and Dean shoots him a glare.
Dean's no stranger to the orgasms-cure-cramps thing, has even used the line himself, but surely even shameless, public porn-watching Cas wouldn't jerk off in Bobby's front room? Not without knowing she d get caught...
And yeah, okay, that would be Cas, sucking his cock.
The kiss deepens, as much as it can, and then Cas wrenches himself away, pushing Dean harder against the wall, making sure he’s safe, and the darkness takes him too.
“I was too late to catch the flight,” Cas explains by his ear. “I’d blame you, but-”
Some part of Sam still wants to baulk, to protest that nothing should be this good, this easy, but the truth is, they’re

Dee nods but her grip only barely softens, hand smoothing over the curve of her belly, a soothing sweep back and forth. “Hey squirt, chill out okay? You heard your Uncle Sam, we’re sorry we can’t help but- I know they’re your family, and I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, but Cas is probably stuck up a tree somewhere and he’ll be back, so- seriously, chill out, you’re starting to freak me out here and I’ve only got time for one Winchester emergency at a time, okay? Please.” Her voice cracks at the end, thickening into a sob, and Sam reaches the short distance and pulls her to him, leaning them both back against the car and rubbing circles over her back.
Okay, so this fic is my baby. It has been in my head for 3 fucking years, and I have vowed to write it out so many times, but as always my ambition is larger by far than my ability. Nevertheless, I love it too much to leave it unpublished, even if it is just scraps and bare bones.
“Yeah, the alpha thing. You were

belief that what we were doing was righteous and just, keeping them together." It's the bitterest Dean's ever heard him, even when God told them they were on their own and Cas went out and got drunk out his gourd; even in the future when he was strung-out and about as far from angelic as he could go.
"where is he?" bobby asks after a moment.
need to watch either himself
for that, he has to get up, has to get Emmy free. He struggles up onto his knees and kind of knee-walks his way over, little neon spots dancing across his eyes as he sucks in air, then, figuring that there’s no time for anything better, pushes himself to his feet with his good arm, grits his teeth and stamps down on the flames.
