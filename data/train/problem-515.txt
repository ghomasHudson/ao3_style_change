"Well, I suppose it's your decision dear," Mrs. Hudson agrees. "But all final decisions go through me."
With a rather intense glower in Mike's direction, Victor spins on his heel and practically stomps out of the room, which Sherlock finds completely childish and almost hysterical, considering the fact the Victor is quite literally missing out on nothing. Sherlock doesn't even know what Pong is. He and Mike will surely lose. If anything, Victor has dodged a bullet as far as the genius is concerned.
"Myc says it's been relatively easy, all things considered," Greg continues, clearly missing John's discomfort. "They still live in this giant house their parents owned and I'm pretty sure they both received a pretty big inheritance. They kept the staff on and Mrs. Hudson still lives there with Myc. I dunno, it's all shitty, really."
Whichever will end this incessant questioning and painful topic and intense wave of memories it keeps bringing up.
Sherlock sighed, fighting down the horrible ache in his chest for frightening his sweet John. "I promise nothing has happened."
John gasped above him, heaving deep breaths as he came down from his high, his deeply flushed body still unbelievably hot to the touch and trembling slightly as Sherlock reached up and wrapped a hand around the nape of his neck, pulling him down into a filthy kiss, prying his mouth open for deeper exploration.
And dread turns into humiliation in the blink of an eye as a foggy, blurred John Watson looks at him from the doorway.
It's slow and quiet and everything John would want for his beautiful boyfriend's first time having this done to him, Sherlock's worried stare finally softening to something so hazy and blissful it makes John's own cock dampen the front of his pants. His lids grow heavy as he slowly rolls his hips up into John's fist and moans helplessly, blinking nothing but lust up in John's direction.
It didn't occur to John until much later, after racing all over campus in a fruitless effort to find someone who clearly didn't want to be found, that he realized he had one other person he could try.
"Hello my mysterious flatmate," John sang as he entered the kitchen, dropping his bag unceremoniously on the counter. "And how are we today?"
"Also, uh-" John stammers, hand on the door handle, prepped and ready to yank it open and flee after he shows his hand rather spectacularly. "Thank you for coming to my match. It really… it was uh-… it was really nice having you there."
Everyone is at the evening bonfire. John stands bundled in his blue rugby jacket from home, sipping at a cup of orange juice and watching the flames, this being his favorite part of the day. Free time after dinner is the best part of camp by far.
The stare is so intense it makes John's chest feel hot and he can't keep his hands to himself any longer, reaching up and tracing a finger along a clavicle, reveling in the feel of Sherlock's breastbone rising and falling beneath John's touch, the boy's breaths coming quicker and uneven, and John can't deny him or himself any longer, sliding his palm up along the side of Sherlock's neck and pulling him closer, dropping his lips to Sherlock's bare shoulder with soft, adoring kisses, trailing his tongue up to the curly-haired boy's ear, tasting rain water and sweat and something so simply Sherlock it makes John moan quietly.
Of course, the blond boy has told Sherlock none of this. He'd simply mumbled something about staying in town for Christmas and meeting up with friends when Sherlock had inquired about what he'd be doing for the holiday break. Friends who, Sherlock knew, would be going home for Christmas and definitely not staying in town. And leaving John alone was simply not an option Sherlock was willing to consider. Especially considering the fact that it was highly probable that John had spent the last two Christmases alone. Because John has no one.
"Uh-" John stutters, suddenly unsure if the little information he's gleaned about Mycroft Holmes is wildly inaccurate. "I...yeah. That's what Greg said anyway." He frowns. "I mean they
"We'd been working together about a year and had a particularly... dangerous case. It ended in an explosion."
"Alright, do I get to know where we're going yet?" John asked, trying not to stare at the curly head absorbed in the small device in his hands.
John loved both so much; he could never choose a favorite. Soft and slow, quick and dirty, John wanted it all.
Warm, callused fingers wrap gingerly around his cock and Sherlock whimpers. The heat is too much. He worries at his lip, praying he doesn't come too soon.
Which almost all fell apart at the sight of John Watson. Twenty-eight-year-old John Watson looked so different from eighteen-year-old John Watson. Sherlock hadn't allowed himself to recognize all the differences while he lay in hospital, but now... now he couldn't ignore them. Now they stood out so obviously, so painfully, Sherlock forced himself to commit every single one to memory.
Who now lies in a hospital bed with broken bones and cuts and bruises and a white bandage wrapped around his head from an injury sustained on said battlefield, now believing it's five years ago, thinking he's only just returned from war, having no idea he's married, no idea he's been invalided home twice.
But purposefully hurting John was never something Sherlock would for a greater good, it still hurt like hell. Especially as John's black and blue face turn a shade darker and tinted red.
By the time the last message was sent, John was on the floor, having fallen to his knees at some point, eyes full of terrified tears, fingers trembling over the buttons of his phone.
"BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, YOU FUCKING PRAT!" John screeched, outstretched hands now wrapping into the front of Sherlock's shirt, face closer than it had been in ten years, and Sherlock's body physically wilted into the touch, bending at the knees and wrapping his hands around the backs of John's thighs.
Which promptly brought John right over the edge, spilling warm liquid from the tip of his dick in long, never ending strings, surely ruining the bed sheets and reaching Sherlock's cock easily. John held on to the boy touching him, riding out the blissful peak of an orgasm he'd never known, sure he was making ridiculous needy noises and unable to care. One of his hands had found its way into Sherlock's curls and he pulled down, desperately needing an anchor, needing to hold on tightly to something, convinced if he didn't he might just float away in ecstasy.
Sherlock blinks. And blinks again. And once more, just to be sure John doesn't suddenly disappear into thin air and this whole conversation abruptly becomes a very bad dream.
Squeezing his hand, John shifts slightly closer to him. "Thank you," he breathes back, and Sherlock's heart soars at the fact that he's offered a bit of comfort to his hurting friend.
Christ, it sounds like a promise and Sherlock makes a soft sound as John lays him back down and utterly worships his body, running the gentlest of touches over his skin, making him writhe and squirm and moan.
Sherlock nods hastily. "Please," he whispers. "I want you so much, John. I want... I want you to.. to f-fuck me."
"First you flirt with me. Then you ride my horse. And now you're covering for me? Why? Are you making fun of me? Do you know that I like you so you're intentionally trying to hurt me?"
"I'll go grab them," John grins, still practically beaming as he slips by Sherlock and out of the kitchen, making his way to the sliding glass door leading out to the patio.
"Yes sir." The respectable response was almost second-nature now. He thanked his short military training thus far for being able to keep his voice from wavering. Especially when a cold sweat was forming at the base of his neck.
He'd asked John so many intrusive questions over the last few weeks, he was surprised every time when John answered them without hesitation. Sherlock knew John assumed this was all to feed an extreme curiosity Sherlock had, but in truth it was that Sherlock actually wanted to know. He wanted the answers. He would do anything for them. Even tell John things about himself. Things he rarely spoke of to anyone.
John growled and slid his hand down Sherlock's stomach. He pulled open his belt, flicking the clasp of his trousers open and pushing them down with his pants, dragging his fingers over the taut muscles of his thighs as he moved toward his goal. John had begun to pride himself on his well he could get Sherlock's cock out of his trousers and he grinned when he heard a soft moan from Sherlock's lips over his neck. He glided his fingertips over the velvety skin of Sherlock's erection, reveling in the hitch in Sherlock's breath.
"My name is irrelevant," he can hear John mutter to himself in almost comical sarcastic disbelief, the headshake so obvious Sherlock swears he can feel it. "Good to know."
John had been able to get his wits about him within the first month of living at 221B. While Sherlock was still unbearably attractive, and John was still helplessly lusting after him, the constant interaction had eased the sting of it. Plus, it sort of took the fun out of it when he was hyperaware he hadn't a chance in hell.
Sherlock was the first to relax, shaking his head slightly and reaching his hand into his pocket. "Sorry," he muttered, tugging the mobile out to find an unknown number lighting up the screen. He glared down at the offending electronic, swearing to the heavens above if this is a solicitor call interrupting the one conversation Sherlock had been aching to have with John Watson, someone was going to get a vicious earful. He tapped the green button and raised the phone to his ear. "Sherlock Holmes," he barked, metaphorically rising up on his toes, preparing to hurl insults as soon as the caller made themselves known.
special you could send one to," Molly coos, smiling at him like they're sharing a naughty secret without saying a word.
"I'm so glad you're here," John murmurs just loud enough over the spray of water hitting the porcelain tub, tucking a stray curl behind Sherlock's ear in that tender way he does. "I mean no offense to Greg but I'm certain he wouldn't be giving his injured teammate this much attention tonight."
"I'm not saying yes," John tried to defy but his feet were carrying him to the room before he made a conscious decision to do so.
He tried to slow his steps, tried to prolong the time John had to decide, tried to wait, but he couldn't be obvious about it or this whole thing could fall apart. He sucked in a harsh breath, just narrowly avoiding coughing around the freezing air in his throat, and waited. Waited with every step away.
"Oh," John reaches shaky hands out to accept his gift, blue eyes wide and round and full of such happy shock that it takes every effort on Sherlock's part not to go to him immediately and wrap his arms around the blond boy and pull him as close as humanly possible. "I…thank you. Thank you very much."
John's cock springs free, flushed red and leaking dollops of white pre-come from the crown, looking for all the world like it could burst at any given moment. It's beautiful. Just like John.
Sherlock sighs, Anderson's words rushing back to him and a wave of anger pulls the genius boy back under as he remembers that nasty sneer so close to his face only hours ago, the wound still fresh from where Anderson's words cut him deep. "I just wish everyone would leave me the hell alone about my sodding sex life," he grumbles to his paper. "I don't understand why he even cares. It's not anyone's business, especially not fucking Phillip Anderson's."
John drops his hips, pressing his own hard cock against Sherlock's, and Sherlock groans loudly. His hands come to John's shoulders. "Mmm," he hums. "D-don't stop."
John's courage gathered at the back of his throat and he couldn't stop himself. "So, earlier, when you came over at the beginning-"
There are no hellos, no exchanging of pleasantries, only body against body, breath against breath, feeling each other, remembering each other after so many hours away, which should be bloody ridiculous but it feels completely important, this thing between them still so new and so delicate and any time apart feels like eternity. The tall body against John's seems to sag into him in relief at his touch, Sherlock sighing into the long lingering kiss they're sharing like he's remembering how to breathe again and John is positive he's not doing much better.
It's a ridiculous thing to care about, Sherlock knows. Who cares what he wears? No one is looking at him. No one is interested in him like that. Why should he care?
Frowning, Sherlock's eyes run all over him in one swift motion. "I was… I was in the library," he says distractedly, as he gleans as much information from John's clothes and posture and facial expressions as he can, "doing a project with Irene and Victor." He blinks up into John's eyes. "Are you alright?"
"I didn't know," Mycroft retorted coolly. "I really didn't, Sherlock. I've only just gained access and manpower for information like this, to the military and their personnel, both discharged and otherwise. I would have looked into John's whereabouts if anything seemed amiss. Really, I would have Sherlock. I hope you know that."
He padded around the flat going about his normal morning routine, flipping the kettle on and digging in the fridge for eggs. Mike had teased him their first few days living here about how most college kids slept in, grabbed whatever food was closest to them for breakfast and threw on dirty clothes. Not John. John had been taking care of himself for 18 years. He had a morning and night routine and he actually knew how to do laundry. In his house, if you didn't take of yourself, you weren't going to be taken care of. A lovely side affect of growing up in the Watson home.
John closed his eyes, leaning into Sherlock in a soft nuzzle. "We're going to love each other," he agreed, running his nose along Sherlock's hairline. "We're going to love each other."
He'd been going over their conversation from his office hours for the last three days and had been so angry with himself for letting his guard down, for letting himself fall into comfortable almost flirtatious chat. John had revealed a little more about himself, gained courage and strength and a little forwardness and Sherlock had enjoyed every new piece of information he obtained. John had only become more interesting, more fascinating and a hell of a lot more sexy. Sherlock found himself wanting more and more.
Sherlock blinked. They hadn't talked about it, not really. John hadn't asked how it had happened and Sherlock hadn't volunteered the information. For this exact reason.
A hand came down on his shoulder and Sherlock startled into silence, whipping around at the contact, coming face to face with Bill Wiggins' big, watery eyes staring at him. "Mister Holmes?"
The lump that forms in Sherlock's throat threatens to suffocate him. "Um-" he doesn't know how to say this. "I... you worked with me. On cases."
Sherlock's hands slid to John's neck delicately, fingers finding the hairs on the back of his neck and tugging gently, forcing a violent shudder and soft groan from his throat. Sharp teeth bit down on his lower lip and pulled it into warmth, sucking it and biting it again before releasing it. John was panting, mouth hanging open, silently begging for anything Sherlock was willing to give.
It's not like it's new information but John has never thought about it in such blunt terms. Such clear statements like Greg said. He's never put words to it before.
He can practically hear John's eyebrows raise themselves in disbelief. "Oh, yeah?" John's question, dripping with sarcasm, hangs in the air as Sherlock nods to the ground. "Work that takes up every waking moment of the day and into the late hours of the night? On the first week of uni? You've must got some tough professors."
"Anything I've ever read on the topic of dating has only told me general things like that or given me sex tips," John shakes his head with a laugh. "It's completely ridiculous."
Which John seems to agree with as he tosses his hips forward in one sharp thrust, popping a self-satisfied eyebrow as Sherlock cries out, the delicious tingles of John's erection skidding across his prostate shooting out from every nerve ending within him, showering him in pleasure.
Lowered eyelids, parting lips, long, tender gazes over John's mouth, John's fit body, John's groin. God, it was intoxicating being stared at like that. By someone like Sherlock Holmes, who was already quite severe and serious in his features, his gaze already piercing and ever-knowing on an everyday basis as it was. But a sultry, interested Sherlock Holmes was... something else entirely. It made things in John's body feel uncomfortably hot, made him think unfathomable thoughts, made his mouth fill with saliva. Made him
"I missed you terribly, love," John whispers again, pulling back enough to lay gentle kisses on Sherlock's lips. "So very much."
because the need he feels to be physical with John is practically tearing him in two and the wait is only making it more difficult to not only rip that godforsaken pillow out from where it has been wedged between their hips more often than not lately, but it's also made it almost impossible to keep his hands out of John's clothing. The temptation to sneak wandering fingers beneath t-shirts and pants is getting to be too much.
"No," Sherlock said firmly. "I can't keep doing this with you. You think you want it every time but once it's over, the minute you start to think… I can't keep watching you run away from me. I can't, John."
Shaking his head, John attempts not to blush at how incredibly intimate this feels. "I'm fine," he mutters, "I'm good. You?"
to be here. He wants to see John running up and down that field in front of him, playing the sport Sherlock knows he loves more than anything. He wants to see John smile that ridiculous smile of his when their team does something good. He wants to watch John's blond fringe glisten with sweat in the sunlight, watch his eyes light up with intensity and adrenaline. Sherlock has seen John practice rugby several times, though he should be ashamed to admit that fact. But for some reason, this feels different. This game-
. Sherlock has got to make that boy feel like the incredible human being that he is all day every day. Sherlock has got to make him see how important he is. Sherlock has got to make him know that he is completely and utterly perfect. John deserves to feel all the things he makes Sherlock experience every day.
Exhaling deeply, Sherlock glares down at his roommate defiantly, daring him to do something. He isn't sure why he has a natural tendency to poke the bears that threaten him, but Sherlock has never been a coward and doesn't plan on becoming one now. Even though he has no desire for John to punch him and shatter the illusion he has about John Watson and his perfection.
The reply is almost instant with lots of exclamation points and smiley faces and John grins before gathering his items and heading off to the showers.
"I'm sure you've all been through orientation by now," Sherlock continued, "and have no doubt been told countless times that you are the 'wave of the future' and the 'next brilliant generation' and you were 'chosen for a reason' when admitted. That is entirely incorrect. Do not take those statements to heart. I do not plan to coddle any of you. Do not expect any leniency simply because you are first years. If you do, you will not succeed in this course. I expect you to work to your full potential, and not waste my time. Do not misunderstand me. I do not care if you succeed or not. That is entirely up to you. I am a mere tool to your learning experience."
"'The usual," Sherlock shrugs, dutifully ignoring Molly's worried gaze. "I'm a freak and a faggot and now apparently a stalker?"
The blond head against his chest shifted upward, settling damp lips on the underside of Sherlock's jaw, sucking gently along the sharp bone before making their way to his neck, licking and biting gently into smooth skin.
The words fall dangerously close to something John had text messaged earlier, something that Sherlock still can't shake from his thoughts, something he doesn't think he will ever forget.
"Of course," Sherlock frowns, his cheeks warming a little feeling caught out. "It's a five-hour train ride to get here, John. Did you really think I'd heard you were injured and got here in such little time?"
"Oh shit," the voice, presumably the one that made the distracting sound in the first place, hisses regretfully, footsteps hurrying into the studio. "Are you okay? I'm so sorry, I was just walking by, I didn't think you'd be in the middle of… god, but that was incredible the way you just… sorry, sorry that's not what I… Christ, let's get you up."
It was a low blow. It was all low. The lowest thing Sherlock had ever done. The worst words Sherlock had ever spoken. The last thing he wanted John to feel was guilt for being in this situation, a situation for the life of him Sherlock didn't bloody understand, but he had to do this. He had to. John was far too proud to accept help or anything without being guilted into it.
The other was a taller, stocky boy, probably a teammate, whose dark eyes barely left John. Not someone Sherlock knew.
Sherlock begins to drown out John's bumblings as anger strikes red hot in his gut. "Hey," he spits, putting a halt to John's words. "I am fine. I'm not some delicate thing you have to coddle at every turn. I may be new to all this but I'm not incapable of saying no. You think I couldn't have knocked you right on your arse if I wanted you off of me?"
She turns her rather predatory, calculating gaze on their third partner. "Victor, would you be a dear and go grab that textbook on reactions Sherlock mentioned?"
Swallowing thickly, John stared at the ground. "About five years. I was invalided home about five years ago."
"Being a teenage PhD student is dull? And here I thought being a lowly pre-med student was difficult. I must bore the pants off you."
But even now as he walks through the halls of his school, he knows the pain he felt this morning is going to be nothing compared to what happens next. Compared to the excruciating agony of seeing John Watson after what they shared last night, this morning is going to look like a walk in the fucking park.
"JOOOOHNNYYYY!" Mike sings against the door like the obnoxious fool that he is while knocking incessantly. "GET UUUUU-UUUUP!"
It's cheesy and wonderful and Sherlock can't help poking a little bit, knowing he's being mean with his little surprise and unable to care. He'll be with John so
He sneaks a peek at the rugby team practice, just to see if he can catch a glimpse at the boy who'd let him go.
"Hey," John is suddenly close again and Sherlock swears he feels a hand on his forehead and fingers brush through his curls. He thinks. He can't tell since his eyes are shut and he's not sure if he's imagining it or not but
What if Sherlock rejects him? What if Mycroft thinks John rejected Sherlock and comes after him? What if-
"I'll keep that in mind," Sherlock breathed, watching as John slipped the buttons through their holes again, inhaling sharply as John pushed his shirt off his shoulders back to the ground where John firmly believed it belonged for good.
Sherlock threw his head back with the sharp yank of John's hand, crying out and for a split second John thought he'd hurt him.
"Yeah," John agrees, hands roaming all over flat abdominals and firm pectorals and stunning lines leading the way to one aching cock now leaking down onto the blankets, fingers following the divots up and back, Sherlock's moan rumbling in John's chest. "I've got you love, fuck, look at you, I've got you."
want to fuck a freak like you, Sherlock Holmes. I'd take my offer if you ever want to lose that pesky virginity of yours."
"It's not your level of intelligence that gets to me, it's what you choose to fill your heads with. I apologize for not using the space in my mind for useless knowledge of Doctor Who episodes."
"That's better," he huffs, before letting his face split into a wide grin, beaming at his victorious teammates. "I just want to say well done, boys, truly. That was not an easy match today but you all brought your A game like I knew you would. Cheers boys!" He raises his water bottle in a quick salute out to the group, the team responding in kind with whoops and cheers and hollers of their own.
The hand wrapped around the nape of his neck dips its fingers beneath the jersey still fitted down his torso, stroking naked skin back and forth, back and forth, making Sherlock's eyes roll back in his head from beneath closed lids, his own tongue leaping out with more confidence than it has any business having and seeking out John's, brushing and curving, meeting again and again, every encounter better than the one before, every touch making Sherlock's splayed-out fingers curl tighter into John's t-shirt at his upper and lower back, cradling him as close as humanly possible. The warmth of John's skin seeps through his clothing and into Sherlock's hands, strong muscles shifting beneath his touch and Christ why hadn't he done this so many weeks ago? Why hadn't he grabbed John Watson and kissed him breathless on day one?
"Shhhhh'lock?" John had stage-whispered raspily like a completely arsed imbecile, stepping unevenly along their dingy tiled floor. "You awake?"
But John - there is so very much to notice about John. John with his pretty bright blue eyes and shaggy blond hair that fell just so across his forehead.
"That's..." John starts and stops, unsure how to finish. That's... exactly it? That's... completely heartbreaking that anyone could feel that way? That's... the furthest thing from the truth? "... horrible."
That point in and of itself was driven home on an almost daily basis, as Sherlock rejected person after person. Mike's warning really wasn't necessary when John received firsthand proof constantly.
Somewhere, in his fucked up faux reality, John is the one writing him poetry. John is the one slipping notes in his locker and thinking of silly rhymes to say he likes him. John is the one that fancies him.
John shook his head. "Yeah, it's just my stupid mobile isn't working." He attempted to ignore the little stab of panic in the back of his neck. Why would he panic over a broken phone? There was nothing to panic about.
John blinked. The man rolled his eyes and loomed impossibly closer. "John? Focus. His name. What is it?"
The tiny flicker of hope in Sherlock's face only lasts a moment before his pretty gray eyes darken to green, lids sliding into a glare. "You're being childish, John. You'll get bored of long distance, we both know-"
John crept down the hall to the only bedroom in the flat and softly knocked. "Sherlock?" he murmured.
. Pressing them into John's chest, he reaches for more kisses, John still hovering over him, still gently touching his most private of areas. "Please," he breathes into John's mouth. "Please."
Warning: This is where the story descends into gradual new relationship smut. Not your thing? Probably should stop reading now… The rest of you lovely people who've been AMAZINGLY supportive? Enjoy!
"Is that vodka?" Sherlock is suddenly, wildly, on alert, the glass looking more ominous now that he believes it's not filled with harmless water, insides lurching with the memory of the last time he had alcohol in him, the drink in front him not looking one bit enticing.
Sherlock laughs, John's blunt honesty endearing on so many levels. "That's okay. Um, thank you for… helping me up."
He crawls up that now fully blushing, thin frame, to find Sherlock still quietly panting, eyelids doing their best to open.
Which proved completely and utterly false as Sherlock stepped up behind him, gaze finally falling away from John's face in the mirror to his actual body. John realized immediately what a fool he'd been to believe if he were no longer staring into fathomless pools of ever changing color he would have any sort of control over himself. Because now, Sherlock was close. Closer than ever before, heated breath ghosting down John's neck, eyes grazing down the side of John's face.
"I may have drank it all this weekend," Mike's tired voice came from behind him and John whirled around, falling back into the fridge and yelping as he lost his balance. Mike laughed then threw out a hand to help him up.
"Hey faggot," Sebastian Wilkes barks in response with a sneer, the brute always entirely unoriginal, only able to replicate every move Anderson makes, never finding a path of his own. "Enjoying your holiday? This is the most wonderful time of the year for you gays, isn't it? With all the pink and purple and flowers?" He's clutching Sally Donovan to his side, beaming at her when she giggles girlishly up at him like he'd just made the most hilarious joke anyone has ever told, the two of them indulging unpleasantly in making Sherlock's life hell.
"Well I suppose I can accommodate that," Sherlock whispers back and they stay that way for a long moment.
are what's lovely," John half-heartedly argues, deciding those fingers in his hair should be licensed soothers because
He can't explain it but he's certain he could get off on John's words alone. The way he talks to him during sex makes shivers run up his spine and shoot out to every nerve ending in his entire body, heightening the sensation of his impending orgasm.
"Mm, that's it," John encouraged, attempting to commit the look on Sherlock's face to memory, biting his lip at the prospect that he would see him like this more often from now on. "That was so perfect. You were perfect for me, Sherlock."
No one has ever looked at him like this before and it's making Sherlock's brain all sorts of fuzzy, too many thoughts pinging around his head like lightning bolts, his entire being unsure what to do under the gaze of his roommate and yet never ever wanting it to end. He would live in this moment if he could, settle in and stay here forever with John looking at him like this, holding his hand and calling him
So watching that normally babbling boy go completely mute was a bit upsetting. The fact that Sherlock couldn't be himself in public, didn't feel comfortable enough around other people in general made something ache harshly in John's chest. Greg's words from practice earlier that day had rattled around his skull as he watched Sherlock move quietly out of the way when they'd approached the team in the kitchen, not uttering a single word, barely making eye-contact, attempting to make himself scarce and unobtrusive.
No tall, curly-haired genius flouncing about in a ridiculous dressing gown, bent over an experiment or laying on his bed or pacing, hands flying wildly as he rattled off his thoughts.
shouldn't. He doesn't even know anything about rugby. He's never cared to. Especially when he despised the boys who played it. The boys who equally despised him.
Something had caught his eye when perusing Sherlock's flat and John darted back to the main room to find the kit on a table, opened and rummaged through as though it was recently used. John's stomach dropped a little at that thought but pushed it aside for now, digging into the box and grabbing what he needed.
Silence fills the room, with the exception of Sherlock shifting books along his desk and for a beat he thinks he won. He thinks maybe Irene has finally gotten the point and maybe she'll leave him alone.
he wants him so badly, already practically fucking him on the dance floor for the whole world to see, Jesus he does not care, senses blinded with pure need running bone deep, craving the unspoken things promised in the language of their movements. Flashes of that night in the hotel burst free in his mind's eye and he presses his mouth to the hot skin below Sherlock's ear to stifle his moan, the image of the genius boy between his thighs sucking him off something John will never ever forget, all wet heat and long strokes, dark blue eyes staring up at him like they worshipped him, damp skin melting against his own. Fucking
Finding Greg first, John marched right over to him, grabbed the drink he held in his hand, and threw it back, swallowing it hard with a loud exhale.
Though, if there is one place he'd prefer John to be on nights like these, it's right here with him. It's comforting, John in his bed. John's deep sleeping breaths. John's sturdy, reliable form, causing a small dip in the mattress from his weight, unknowingly soothing Sherlock with his presence alone.
Sherlock makes his way back to the kitchen to pour the now heated water. He mentally notes where the telly remote is and reminds himself to grab it on his way back into the main room.
"I like you too, John," His voice was nervous, and so damn sweet John had to reach back and squeeze his hand.
Sherlock reached him just before the man's hands closed around John's jacket, and launched himself so viciously, he wouldn't have been surprised if he had broken something in his own body.
"Good," John whispers back, no longer able to resist and descending upon the boy, catching his lips in a languid, reassuring kiss, tongues rolling lazily together as the rugby player presses the genius back into the pillow and snogs him, morning breath be damned.
He's never even considered someone touching him here like this. It's intimate and filthy and Sherlock is reveling in it.
Realization crashes into Sherlock like a ton of bricks and the eye roll is immediate. "Oh for the love of -
team of all bloody places. On no less than three occasions in the span of a single week John has invited Sherlock to a team event. A meal, a hangout, a party for christssake, and Sherlock has just barely dodged the invitations. He's claimed homework or experiments, forcing an indifferent mask over his features to hide the teenage squirming of his belly at the fact that
"Would you relax," John replies flippantly. "She's perfectly alright. Just needed to have a rider that trusts her."
"I really feel like I should be angry with you for so many reasons, I can barely remember them all," John said as they wandered down a new corridor.
"Anyway," John sighs as the laughter slowly wanes. "It's getting pretty late. I'd better be getting home."
The party is not quite as loud as Sherlock had anticipated it being. A dull hum and quiet thump of music are filling the air certainly but he'd kind of assumed that people would be yelling drunkenly and maybe swinging from chandeliers, shouting at each other or fighting from what he'd seen in movies. He's never been to a proper party. Truth is: he's never been invited.
At least, that's what John told himself over and over for two straight weeks. He hadn't quite decided if he believed it yet.
"You didn't want to come too soon?" John asks for clarification, licking his way over one of Sherlock's pretty pink nipples.
John was okay. He was being snogged in a sickening fashion that made Sherlock want to growl in agony, but he was fully clothed and the stranger's hands were visible, one against John's hip and the other holding his head to the side to get at the skin under his ear.
Now. Looking up into translucent green eyes, accented beautifully by tumbling dark ringlets and pale skin, Sherlock was gazing at him like everything he'd ever wanted in his entire life was laying beneath him, dressed only in pants and waiting to be had.
," Sherlock emphasized, leaning his forehead into his hand. "How did she and John come from the same people? He's kind and funny and she's miserable and mean."
So for now, he'll keep his cool, reign it in, let it goddamn go because the last thing he wants is to ruin a perfectly nice evening out with his sexy boyfriend and best mates over something as petty as an attractive person talk to his partner.
"It's a difficult task," Sherlock chuckles. "Tell me, John, is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing."
"I wouldn't say I'm 'in' so much as I'm useful. Lestrade is the only one that will work with me. He sends me information when he needs help. If it's particularly interesting, I show up. Occasionally unannounced. You wouldn't believe how many morons work for the police force."
"I know," Sherlock murmurs back, sharp tears stinging the corners of his eyes even as the calm of knowing and accepting the truth settles over him. It hurts- Christ, it's
Not that that was difficult to do since Sherlock had been lying in the bed across from his practically sawing logs with the snores reverberating from his mouth, though John had to admit he'd have rather listen to Sherlock snore and snuffle and fuss in his sleep rather than panic every few minutes that he'd stopped breathing if silence had fallen.
John ached to make Sherlock laugh like that. To make him smile like that. To make him react in any positive way at all. Something pressed heavily on his chest, forcing the breath from his lungs as he watched this exchange. To watch Sherlock interact with anyone in such a way hurt more then John had ever even realized possible. It was an absurd reaction, but it didn't seem like there was much choice in the matter.
John felt a little uneasy, worried his friend was about to have a meltdown. "Okay…what did you learn?"
Lestrade stopped and turned, already tilting his head in discouragement. "Sherlock..." he warned. "I'm already breaking rules having you in there. I can't allow everyone you bring in as well."
Sherlock sighed heavily, dropping into a chair at the table. "I missed you so much, John," he breathed, feeling the weight of the words on his tongue. "I wouldn't have cared if you'd returned missing an arm or leg. It wouldn't have mattered to me. I still would've... I still..." He couldn't say it. He couldn't admit it.
John laughs and places a hand on Sherlock's cheek. "You can if you'd like, sweetheart," he says, looking at Sherlock adoringly. "There's nothing to be afraid of."
That yanked John right back to reality. His furious brain suddenly cleared as he processed exactly what he'd just heard. He blinked rapidly until his eyes refocused and sharpened on the beautiful boy still slightly flushed in front of him. "You... I...
On fucking cue, two familiar faces round the corner just behind John, Molly Hooper and Greg Lestrade talking animatedly to each other before either of them notice the shell of Sherlock Holmes watching them both and they freeze almost on command, stopping dead in their tracks.
Red was blurring at the corners of his vision as he barreled down the footpath, taking no notice of anyone around him.
like he couldn't quite believe it. He doesn't remember preemptively arguing that he had a duty to fulfill, that when the army calls you don't say no, that Sherlock needed to understand.
"She's fine," John replies, pulling on the reins to slow Dolly back down. He leans down and pats Dolly's neck. "You're just fine, aren't you pretty girl?"
The entry hallway is draped in garland wrapped in twinkling lights, those familiar red bells placed at the center of each dip just like Sherlock knew they would be, gold tinsel strands complimenting the doorways around the edges as he makes his way in. He smiles up at his surroundings, taking in every decoration his mother had obviously strategically put up, swathing every wall, every piece of furniture, every doorway in nothing but holiday décor, every pillow holding some sort of wintry icon, every blanket covered in snowflakes or reindeer. All perfectly laid and thoughtfully organized with a hint of chaos where his mother obviously couldn't help herself, adding too many lights in one area, too much tinsel in another.
say love?" he tries to bark, though his words come out more of a hopeful question as his wide eyes reread the note. He'd seen it laying there when they walked in but he hadn't actually read over John's squiggly handwriting, preferring to read it alone, heart softening at the gesture of that perfect boy being so goddamn
Green eyes locked on John, Sherlock snuck his tongue out and ran that metallic steel over the head of John's cock. John slammed his head back against the door, hardly able to believe one of his filthiest fantasies was currently coming true. "Sh-Sherlock," he breathed, unable to look away for to long, dropping his head back down to watch as his cock disappeared into Sherlock's mouth. "Fu-uck," he groaned, hands still buried deep in Sherlock's hair, riding the motion of Sherlock bobbing up and down. "Jesus, Sherlock." There was no way in hell he was going to last much longer.
- ugh) Sherlock's eyes scroll downward, skimming and skipping those circumstances he doubts he will ever be in until his gaze runs across a story he still isn't sure applies to him but finds himself reading anyway.
"Go get 'em, Champ," he bids, hoping the praise will ease the stress. "I'll be back in a flash to see you win, yeah?"
"Come on, Sherlock!" Greg cheers from the side of the table, tipping his beer up in support. "Give 'em hell!"
"Sherlock," John breathes the most beautifully broken breath and suddenly all of Sherlock's apprehension and confusion and uncertainty fade to nothing.
"No, I just meant… sports," John attempts and fails to save himself. "I didn't think you liked them."
"I'm certain of it." She spoke with such surety and confidence that John could only nod. William was flanking her to the left, nodding as though every word she spoke was truth and smiling happily.
"Yes there is," Sherlock mumbles, burrowing down further and John can feel the heat of his blushing cheek through his t-shirt. "I should have apologized earlier but I'm… I'm sorry. About all the things I said and how we left it...I- I didn't mean it…"
To his non-surprise, John sat on the couch, looking more than furious, arms crossed snuggly over his chest, eyes narrowed as far as they would go without closing them altogether. "Nice of you to come back," he spat venomously.
"So you know nothing, is what you're saying," Sherlock replies bitingly, throwing Irene a glare before picking his pencil up and setting back to work in his notebook next to his laptop, attempting to refocus on the task at hand. He doesn't have time to listen to Irene's insane ramblings. They have work to do.
"Still, that um… that thing you did," Sherlock tries to articulate his gratitude. "That was um…good of you."
A cool panic runs down the back of John's neck. What had happened earlier? Had he done something stupid? Had he given himself away? Had Sherlock seen-
John tried to avoid the way his skin prickled. "They don't hate us, Harry," he attempted half-heartedly. He didn't really think his parents hated them. He always thought they just didn't particularly care. It wasn't a like or dislike. Just a noninterest.
"Oh," Sherlock nods, clearly attempting to look unfazed, though the concern still lingers in his irises.
"See, I knew this day would come," Mike raises his gaze from where he's stretching out his hamstrings, shaking his head at John with a resigned sigh. "I knew one day that boyfriend of yours would have you good and whipped and you wouldn't even be able to do something as innocent as practice rugby without checking in with him first."
John opens his eyes and smiles. "Naughty," he says with a wink, eyeing the pile of Sherlock's clothing.
he's safe. John is here. John will protect him and hold him and curse the ground those bastards walk on.
But he wasn't then and he's not now, because even if Victor pouring shots down Sherlock's throat had given John a reason to protect him, the blond could never appreciate it. Not when Sherlock had been so hurt. Not when Sherlock had been so
This isn't the first time John has appeared at his house in the middle of the night without so much as a text message and Sherlock doubts it'll be the last.
Sherlock lets out a whoosh of relieved breath, slapping his hand to his chest. "Oh," he murmurs, trying to calm his own rapidly beating heart. "What happened then?"
Attempting not to squirm as something warms his belly at the sight of John Watson holding his hand, palm up, out to Sherlock, offering it to him, like it's something for him to take and hold and touch, the curly-haired boy opts for knitting his eyebrows together in feigned confusion, terrified of miss-stepping in this situation, or, godforbid, misinterpreting and making a fool of himself.
"Good one," Sherlock nods in feigned approval. "Well done repeating the most tiresome gay slur you can possibly cough up, considering your comrade here only just spoke the exact same word not thirty seconds ago - "
And John hadn't even done any of those things. Besides the looking. He'd absolutely done his fair share of looking.
didn't have to," John glares pointedly, though he's fighting a grin. "I can read you like a book Sherlock Holmes."
John groans against his skin, sending vibrations down Sherlock's body. "Christ, I love it when you say my name."
John looked back at him, then let out a shaky breath. "Yeah, turns out this is kind of scary," he huffed a laugh. He reached out an unsteady hand and laid it on Sherlock's chest. "I... I like you too." Sherlock grinned and John giggled. "I know you already knew that, but it seems like you just put all your feelings on the table and I didn't want to leave you hanging."
"I didn't even know he was missing," Mycroft replied with an eyebrow raise. "And neither did you so you can stop it with the accusations."
Spinning the dial weakly on his locker, he only just notes a small group of girls his age tittering nearby, the four of them surrounding a fifth girl who is speaking softly enough Sherlock can't hear the actual words, though the red in her cheeks and the grin on her face tells her excitement all the same, beaming at her friends as they
It's only after John's smile has grown to spread across his face brilliantly from one cheek to the other and informed Sherlock that his mum is working the night shift Sunday night, and it's only after Sherlock responds that his parents will be out town until next week and it's only after they make a plan for John to stay over Sunday night and it's only after John has departed with an awkward wave and stuttered goodbye that Sherlock realizes exactly what he's just agreed to.
What he wasn't prepared for was the fact that Mycroft didn't tell him the entire truth of the matter at all.
The back alley was empty. He stood quietly, listening intently for any telltale sounds of coupling taking place, any harsh breathing or ruffling of clothing.
And with that overprotective thought, another body brushes against John's, shocking him into the present and out of his own consuming thoughts and he takes stock of his surroundings long enough to find himself back in Sherlock's space, the square footage of their room affording little area for them to move around without at least rubbing shoulders, although this time John doesn't think it's an accident and he delights in the fact that he no longer has to tamp down on the little tremors of pleasure that race up his arm at the feeling of Sherlock's skin ghosting over his and before they both fully know what's happening, the rugby player has the genius boy pressed up against his closet door, bodies pushing together, long slender fingers sneaking into blond fringe, tongues twirling around each other like they've been doing this for ages.
Their rhythm isn't fast but it's hard and deep and Sherlock digs a hand into John's hair, John's mouth sucking down on his shoulder.
The tiny ember that has lodged itself in Sherlock's chest when this all began slowly glows to life. He bites his lip as he types his reply.
"Told you," Greg grins proudly before Sherlock can recover, glancing around the group with obvious pride. "Didn't I tell you he was bringing him?"
"I'm a crazy person," John mumbles to himself, running a hand through his hair as he glances down at his silent phone in hand, feeling another swoop of disappointment in his gut to find no messages from Sherlock.
"I don't need to go on holiday, Sherlock," he said incredulously. "I can't afford it and I don't want your family paying for it."
Sherlock glanced over the body's rolling frame, lying just on its side. The short hair would indicate a male but Sherlock wouldn't be sure until he was able to see the face. It was a good sign the person was making noise and moving a bit. Hopefully no broken bones but a serious concussion was all too possible.
to reach out, to pull John into his arms and press as close as he was last night, to push his face into John's neck and smell that wholly John scent that's still lingering in his sheets and on his pillow and somehow has seeped into his skin and won't let up, the fragrance lingering in his nose and still somehow making him feel warm and safe.
"Right, okay then. Umm, I'm from a little town a few hours from here. I have an older sister, Harry who lives a few hours in the opposite direction of home. I like running and keeping in shape after playing rugby for most of my life. I'm rather thrilled to be in London, I'd never been outside my hometown until I moved here not a month ago and it's everything I expected it to be. I cannot leave the house in the morning until I've had my morning tea. I absolutely cannot wait to officially be a doctor in a few years and I've toyed with the idea of joining the army, although that is still up for debate. Oh and I can't stand your Chemistry class, it's positively dreadful."
Sherlock ignores the flickers of memories attempting to push themselves forward into his thoughts of the blokes he once knew in sixth form, of those boys not only bullying him but each other, always aggressive and angry and mean, never looking half as cheery as this bunch. He flings those thoughts aside for now since
John watched, mesmerized as Sherlock tugged long pulls over himself, eyes never leaving John's as his lips parted in a small gasp.
Sherlock moans at that, loud and long and goddamn sexy as hell, dropping that gorgeous arse back again, muscles tightening, clutching John's cock between soft skin.
Sherlock loses track of the conversation as he dismounts Balthazar and hands the reigns absently to Mrs. Hudson. "Will you lock him up for me?" He mumbles without really listening for an answer as he takes off toward where John had disappeared inside the shed next to the stables.
Sherlock glanced up to find John's blonde head peering around the door of his office, smiling brightly, his blue eyes sparkling in the afternoon light.
There was a long silence, then Mycroft rose, scraping his umbrella casually across the floor as he strode to the exit. Sherlock waited, knowing full well his brother would have parting words.
Pulling free the towel, letting it fall to the floor, Sherlock ran his eyes all over John's form, taking in every muscled line and protruding vein, fingers grazing over John's overly sensitive skin.
Mycroft hovers at the edge of the field, umbrella still overhead, Greg's rugby bag clutched in the other. "Do you need a ride?" he calls, the rain beginning to spatter smartly on his open umbrella.
"I know," John said sharply, because he did. "Whatever you're going to say, I know. And I promise, for as long as I live I won't hurt him. Not purposefully and I will do my damndest not to let anything like
The world could be falling apart around them and Sherlock would have no idea, so long as John Watson continues to look at him like that.
John lays him down in his sheets, the sheets that smell like them now, hands caressing his naked body with tenderness as Sherlock's head hits the pillow. He watches John crawl over him, laying gentle kisses along his torso and pectoral muscles, licking lightly at his breastbone before trailing up his jaw. "You are stunning," John murmurs against his lips before capturing them in a searing kiss as Sherlock's hands find their way into John's fringe. "Absolutely
"Well maybe you shouldn't," Sherlock growls, stabbing his pencil down at his notebook and scribbling a few lines furiously. "I'm so sick of people worrying about me, like they know anything at all."
"And I'm not…I deny being gay because I'm not gay. I'm bi. And I deny we're a couple because I didn't want it to upset you if people thought we were. And…and I just thought maybe you'd found someone and were hiding it from me."
The comforter around him seems to warm him even more so, making him feel loopy and drowsy and content, snuggled up in his bed in his home because this
Water pours from his face and his fringe, but his gaze stays locked on his cock disappearing into Sherlock's mouth.
"Safe?" John breathes. For some reason hearing someone else mention Sherlock's safety makes this entire thing very real and somehow even more worrisome.
He pads up the stairs silently, violin and bow in hand, and sits on the stairs just as a groan and sharp screech pierce the silence.
, oh-" Sherlock murmured, threading his fingers in John's hair and hanging on as John stroked over him. Watching intently, John savored every reaction he elicited from the beautiful body below him, every arch, every cry. John couldn't get enough. Christ, he didn't want to hurry through this, but fuck it, he couldn't wait any longer. He'd been waiting. He'd been waiting forever.
And it's so unbelievably stupid that that fact alone hurts John more than it should. Sherlock has no loyalties to John. They've met a total of one time. John can hardly even remember what the boy looks like, let alone what may have happened to set them on this weird avoidance path.
"I missed you so much, baby," John moans quietly, lips pressing daintily to the corner of Sherlock's mouth, trailing a line of kisses along his cheek.
Sherlock has never invited him over on a weekend. He text messages him and keeps in contact, but they don't hang out on the weekends.
Sherlock's eyes flutter open. "John?" he says in a deliciously gravely voice and glances down between their bodies, eyes widening. "John," he whispers.
the kind of crap he can no longer be doing. Analyze, attempt to decipher every meaningless thing that happens between him and his roommate. No more of that. They are
"Oh shit," John scrubs a hand down his face, a pang of guilt stabbing the back of his neck. "You didn't need to do that, Mike."
John glanced up to find himself in the kitchen, hands clenched tightly at his sides and Sherlock leaning against the frame of the room looking concerned.
Sherlock hummed and settled back down and John pressed the cloth down his wound, gingerly rubbing the blood away so he could get a better look. Sherlock shifted in his sleep but made no sound and John ducked down to look closely at the cut.
Their food had come minutes after that charged moment in the restaurant, shattering the invisible cocoon they'd formed around themselves and breaking their concentration on each other, leaving a tingling sensation beneath Sherlock's skin and a tap in his foot as his heel bounced up and down on the cement floor, vibrating gently with an undercurrent of something, the possibilities seeming endless between he and John.
He tugs John's shirt up under his arms, then stares down at those defined muscles lying just beneath lesser-tanned skin. He runs his fingers over them one by one, mesmerized as the skin flutters underneath his touch.
But the way he's whimpering and pushing his hips into John's, Sherlock wonders if that's complete rubbish. If he could in fact have another go.
Exchanging a loaded glance, Molly and Greg blink between each other, having a silent conversation before they both seem to drop the point, Molly's features smoothing from pinched worry to resigned acceptance, Greg still shaking his head but deciding to leave it as well. "Alright then," Molly shrugs before offering a sly grin and a small waggle of her brow. "But since you're
He might as well have struck a match and pressed it into Sherlock's skin with how his flesh burns at the touch.
Sherlock quickly straightens and shuffles out of reach and back toward the door where a very angry John Watson is standing.
"John!" Sherlock exclaims excitedly, bolting upright and reaching for the string hanging down from the window, "it's
Laying as still as possible, Sherlock tracks John's silhouette as it crosses the room, watching as the love of his life leaves him.
idea," Sherlock teases, rocking up to give John a kiss, steading himself on his palms. John grins, returning the kiss as he rips open the condom packet he'd found.
help. I need your knowledge of the streets and your experiences living homeless. I need you to help me not go insane wondering if you're safe. I'm hardly asking for anything of you in return."
"I was kidding," Sherlock said with a wave of his hand, "just go shut down your brain and get some rest."
John refuses to meet his eyes. He can feel Molly glancing back and forth between them. "What?" she barks. "What did I miss?"
Sherlock shuddered at that last thought and all but fell against the coffee table in an attempt to reach his phone. He pulled it toward him, ignoring the most recent text messages he had in his inbox and dialed the only person in the world he was sure was awake and would answer his call. He should have thought of this weeks ago, and had, but had chosen, as usual, the difficult route and avoided this, thinking himself stronger. Now, he couldn't for the life of him remember why.
, last night they'd gotten through that part, hadn't they? They'd discussed it and they'd settled it and then Sherlock had turned to him in bed,
"Yes?" John murmurs in reply, pulling back enough to look him in the eye but still keeping his hands on Sherlock.
Will held out his hand and John went to shake it but instead, Will pulled him toward the main floor. "Come on gorgeous, let's dance."
Now he's roaming in front of his house, feeling silly, perking up at every single car that passes by.
Tearing his mouth free of Sherlock's body to gasp harshly, John curses under his breath, eyes fluttering closed, mouth falling open as he thrusts into Sherlock's hand, hips throwing themselves forward from where he's huddling over Sherlock on his hands and knees. "Christ," he bites out before his eyelids fly open to land on Sherlock's. "Sherlock – I….lube. We – oh fuck – we need lube and… and condoms and… please
Sherlock stretches languidly along John's body, his heated cheek resting against John's sternum. John giggles and gives him a cuddle, deciding right then and there that he will be definitely breaking more promises if it ends in orgasms and snuggles.
, not when John looks so cuddly and soft in them making Sherlock want to snuggle up in his arms, press his face into the warmth of his chest or his belly and stay there forever.
John smiles softly as he retrieves Sherlock’s shirt from the floor and helps him slip it over his head. He pulls him in for another slow kiss before wrapping his arm around his waist and leading him to the door.
"Morning," John rejoins, though he sounds slightly unsure and Sherlock turns to find him shuffling his feet in the doorway. "Er- sorry, I can… I can just-"
Too preoccupied with his need to retreat, Sherlock doesn't notice John's extra effort to make it up the stairs quickly.
John sat down on the shower floor again, remembering Sherlock picking him up off the concrete, dragging him to the street, holding him in the car that took them home, tucking him into bed.
," Sherlock replies condescendingly. "She's a…" He pats Dolly's nose, feeling a stab of sadness. "Well. It doesn't matter."
It was enough for Sherlock. Enough to make him question everything he'd ever believed about his relationship with John. Enough to make him question the man himself.
It's out of his mouth before he can catch it and swallow it back down and John looks away, refusing to meet Sherlock's sharp eyes as he whips his head.
"Why are you here?" Greg demands, making his own thoughts on the subject very obvious and John has never been more grateful for his friend than right now.
Sherlock glanced at him as they continued walking. "Fine," he said finally as he slid his hands into his pockets. John silently appreciated how relaxed he looked, still slightly vibrating from the rush of the break-in and felt a bit chuffed that he was getting a rare glimpse of Sherlock Holmes clearly in his element. It was fascinating. He smiled.
," John laughs out a warning which has no bite at all but Sherlock still sighs and finally pulls back.
John stole a glance at Sherlock and deflated a little at the relieved look on his face. So that was it then. Sherlock really wasn't interested in him at all like that. Then what was with his comments at the party the night they met?... No, he was not going to start spinning his wheels down this path again. It was completely useless. He shook his head.
He is tall and gangly and pale, with chaotic curly hair and a funny-looking face. His cheeks hold sharp angles and his lips bow too deeply.
…be careful. He only just came out to me a few months ago and he's never had any type of...hook-ups or anything."
Mike recovered first, still grinning. "Well," he said, clasping his hands over the table. "You see, my dear John, I felt that, being your best friend and all, I needed to have a few choice words with Mr. Holmes here after you told me you were dating. So I decided I'd pop by his office hours."
Until finally Sherlock's stupid mouth finds its voice without any help from his brain. "But you're straight," is his idiotic retort, like somehow that will magically make this conversation any less bizarre.
Long fingers wrap into his blond fringe as Sherlock raises his arms up and reaches behind, arching his back into a sharp c and writhes spectacularly and John lurches forward to meet the movement, dropping his mouth to Sherlock's shoulder, eyes locked on the genius boy's cock jutting out proudly from his pelvis.
Sherlock stroked the back of his hand with his thumb. "She clearly just broke up with someone, that Clara person I presume," he murmured. "She's just lost someone important to her, probably due to something she did. My guess would be the drinking was what ended it. She's now under the impression that you are the only one that would understand since you were also rejected a few months ago, and she believes her misfortune is due to in most part to her upbringing, something she believes you also relate to. She thought she would find your life in a similar state as hers. And like they say; misery loves company." Sherlock looked back toward the front of the cab. "I'm afraid I may have been the one to set off the harsher comments. She wasn't expecting you to be with someone, nor was she expecting to see that you make that someone very happy. She was unable to do that with Clara."
"No, no, it's not that," the blond boy giggles. "I just think it's too much, every inch of the halls littered in scrap pieces of paper and
"I won't!" John all but shrieks. He gathers himself slightly, glancing around for prying eyes before continuing. "God, I would
John rolled his eyes. "We're not fucking. We're friends," he said, doing his best not to sound disappointed in that fact.
in the attention, knowing full well how good he looks and John doesn’t even care that Sherlock is smug as hell because Sherlock
"Uh oh," Mike said casually, sitting down at their small table and settling his elbows on it, cradling his chin in his palms. "What did Sexy Chemistry Teacher do now?"
John barely stifles a groan as he watches Sherlock's back arch off the bed, curls falling back from his forehead, lips widening in what could only be an inaudible gasp.
If he stopped riding, stopped competing, his father would get rid of his small fleet of horses and Sherlock would be broken. The stables would probably be torn down. Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade would be gone too, with nothing left for them to do with no horses to take care of or riders to train.
John snorts. "You're welcome. Although technically, I'm still studying for my degree. I suppose being a year out practically qualifies me, right?"
"Class," Sherlock murmurs back, clearly just as hesitant to break the intimacy of this moment, still gripping John by the hips, the tip of his nose skimming just below John's jawline as he drops a kiss under his ear. "Obviously."
Just beyond the last row of old, dusty books sitting atop thin metal racks, Sherlock Holmes sits bent over a textbook, back curved harshly, long fingers dug deep in his curls as he rereads the same sentence for the hundredth time. He should give up. He knows he should. He's absorbed no new information, his normal laser-focus eluding him today as he glances at the clock ticking away against the wall across from him.
"Okay," Paul huffs out a breath and shakes his head slightly, apparently psyching himself up for this conversation. "Okay."
Whooshing out a breath he didn't know he was holding and letting a bit of weight drop off of his shoulders, unnecessarily pleased that Sherlock didn't have to go anywhere near Victor today even if it would have been in a room full of people, John offers a small smile down at the device in his hand, fully aware Sherlock can't see him but still hoping he's radiating some sort of warmth through the phone lines. That bastard shouldn't get to even lay eyes on Sherlock Holmes. He doesn't deserve to even breathe the same air as that perfect genius boy.
Greg turned immediately to the furthest one from the man across the room and made a beeline for it, head down, hands shoved in his pockets.
Which is why now, as they make their way to the weekly party that is always thrown after games no matter if the team wins or loses, his hands are shoved deep in his pockets, his thoughts doing their damnedest to remain absolutely neutral and his gaze set firmly ahead as he strolls along at John's side. Normally, Sherlock is thrilled for these get togethers, loving the comradery of the rugby team who has been rather accepting of him, anticipating the rush of winning Beer Pong with Mike by his side, the excitement of John's eyes on him the entire night. It's usually his favorite night of the week.
"I see," Sherlock murmured in mock seriousness, trailing his tongue to John's neck. "Do you need my assistance in making those dreams a reality?"
John narrowed his fuzzy gaze at his friend. "I didn't mope. I would never mope about Sherlock Fucking Holmes."
. Preferring to live on the streets of London then see Sherlock again. No, his tolerance had just about run out.
Christ, John already wants to take him home. It's only been a short while and already he's aching to get Sherlock naked and writhing, wet and wanting,
of all fucking nights, feeling extremely unprepared, mind already racing for some sort of excuse to make this stop, to keep Sherlock with him, to keep Sherlock
John licks his lips, shifting on the couch. "Uh-" he huffs a quiet laugh. "Maybe we start with something simple. What do you do for a living?"
"You have no idea what you're talking about," Sherlock spat, fuming. "You've been on two cases, John. You don't know what-"
Sherlock hops gracefully into the water, gliding through it like silk, making his way to the edge of the lake. He climbs out of the water without a glance over his shoulder, all but sashaying up to the boy's locker room.
Hopefully, it won't be ugly. John has been so kind to him, Sherlock hopes he will give him one last act of kindness by maybe just disappearing during the day while Sherlock is in class. Quietly moving his things out of their shared room without a word. That's what Sherlock would prefer. A clean break. No awkward good-byes, no slowly pulling away. Just leave.
John's hands find their way to Sherlock's lower back and press him even closer, fingers feeling hot where they stroke soft shirt threads attempting to sink his touch into Sherlock's skin, riding the delicate movements of that graceful form, following along, chasing after every move, rotating together as one.
I can see your point," John sighed dramatically and Sherlock giggled, pulling him back to the bedroom and closing the door with his foot. "Now, where were we? Oh right, you were about to take your clothes off again."
Sherlock was propped up on his elbows, watching John's every move, eyes wide and dark as he eyed the cock about to enter him. He licked his lips and pressed his hips upward as far as he could, silently asking for it.
"Anyway, he said something really bad in class," Anderson yammered on. "Real nasty. We had to teach him a lesson that I hope for his sake he learned."
from the start. Heavy rains teem against the backs of every player on the field and the bench, winds blowing viciously this way and that as they scramble over each other to gain the upper-hand. Puddles turn into small pools at their feet and even running seems like a struggle as boots get caught in ever-deepening muddy waters, dragging the usual finesse of the game down to simple schoolyard hustle, any skill hindered heavily by weather conditions, forcing every player down to the same level. Flashes of lightning brighten the darkened sky above them and only seem to bring heavier rainfall, the pitch resembling more of a swamp than a field, every bloke fighting mercilessly against the weather and each other, small battles turning into all-out war, hard work not paying off in the slightest against the angry storm, cheap shots becoming more and more frequent as frustrations mount.
And John would be more grateful for their conviction if it weren't for the nagging feeling in the back of John's mind that something is very wrong in his situation with Sherlock. Something he needs to sort out before he can say much more.
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise without looking up and John sighed, sitting back in his seat. Obviously he wasn't going to be getting any information from the man. He stared out the window as the city past them by, trying not to fidget in anticipation. He was thrilled to be going to do something with Sherlock. He was actually invited, if not explicitly, to do something other then sit in the genius' office, although that wasn't unpleasant. He just wanted more. It was never enough to just sit and talk and pretend their ongoing lives outside of that room didn't matter. He wanted to know more about Sherlock, and experience things with him, be a part of his daily life, a part of his world.
"I wanna put you on the back of my bike and drive you straight to bed," John is growling and Sherlock is whimpering.
It's less of a petty bitterness and more of a pure, straight-forward anger. An anger that Victor Trevor thinks he's worth a moment of Sherlock Holmes' time. An anger that Victor doesn't seem to know how bloody incredible Sherlock is. An anger that Victor saw fit to get the curly-haired genius absolutely wasted for no apparent reason other than for a laugh, opting to feed him shots instead of have a goddamn conversation with him.
And then ever so slowly, the man's words caught up with him. He stared, trying to comprehend what had just been said. The stranger stared right back, as though he was seeing John's wheels turn within his head. "I…you…how-wait Mike is… how did you know all that?"
"Goodnight." John did his best not to sound hurt. He turned toward his door and fumbled with his keys, needing to be in the shower with his hand on his cock immediately.
Before he can bring himself back to reality and school his thoughts back into place a loud clatter from behind the door startles them both, heads whipping around to the sound.
if there was ever a time to think that and John wants to touch him desperately, wants to feel every line, every divot, every
"Unfortunately," Sherlock grumbled. "You'd think this school would have been prestigious enough to keep idiotic individuals like him out of it, but apparently I overestimated the standards of the admissions office."
The confidence is sexy as hell and John can't help dropping a wink and a cheeky grin at that gorgeous bloke on the opposing team, deciding two can easily play this game of riling each other up.
John, finally seems to come to from his daze of watching Sherlock tremble for him and begins to quickly and efficiently strip off his own clothing, small, breathless giggles escaping him as Sherlock attempts to help ineffectively, quivering hands absolutely no help at all and the curly-haired boy finds himself joining in with the laughter, grinning helplessly at his own ridiculousness.
Sherlock is just another body in this flat. He's simply the tall man who occupies the first floor bedroom.
"You're not broken," Sherlock reprimands gently before taking a deep breath and, with effort, shifting away enough out of John's reach to instead grasp his hand and tow him toward the loo, protective instincts taking over just a bit, charged again with a need to tend to John's every whim this evening, the knowledge that he's safe and sound doing nothing to soothe the urge to take care of him tonight. "You're perfect. But you smell terrible."
"And I won't try again," Greg replies, standing taller and puffing his chest out a bit. "Your captain is officially off the market, boys."
"Why?" John whined. "Then we'll be even. I have no problem taking advantage of a drunk, sexy, delicious Major Holmes."
"I thought you might find nicknames a bit silly," John continues, stroking a thumb along the back of Sherlock's hand. "But you like it, don't you, love?"
on holding his hand and kissing his cheek and grinning from ear to ear as they walk down the hallways. It shouldn't be as gratifying as it is to watch the mouths of girls and boys alike drop open. And that's not even the best part.
John took the opportunity to change the subject to something lighter. "I'm still not letting you fuck me, Mike."
Victor's face dropped to false sincerity. "You're sure?" He asked in feigned concern. "I'll be meeting him round in an hour or so. I could just-"
"Stop it," Sherlock tries to gripe, although the words come out weak, meaning the exact opposite of their definitions. He glances up from under his lashes to find unfriendly faces shooting shocked gazes between he and John and back to their joined hands. "People are staring."
Even he could see it. The healthy colors in his face, the brightness of his eyes, the way his shoulders sat back and tall, the way he carried himself. Sherlock Holmes had done a number on him and god, was he glad he did.
Biting down on a whimper he refuses to let leave his mouth, Sherlock's eyelids flutter open slowly, dazed mind coming back into focus along with his vision, still not quite having the wherewithal to move back or straighten up or do any of the things he should be doing now that gentle lips are no longer kissing his but he just can't quite make it there.
"Things have been… off today," John tries to explain without going into too much detail. "I've hardly heard a word from him and when we did chat briefly he seemed… distant."
"No thanks," Sherlock replies with a sag of relief, hoping this means they can move on without any lingering discomfort.
Hands stroking along John's flanks tenderly, Sherlock watches every twitch of John's hips, every quiver of John's mouth, every little noise that escapes John's lips as he waits, cataloging every piece of data he possibly can, an intensely sentimental thing to do he knows but he can't possibly be arsed to care. He's having sex with
Ignoring the hands caressing his bare back, though not unaffected by the tender touch, Sherlock yanks on the string and opens the blinds, finding exactly what he was hoping for. "It's snowing," he cheers giddily, a whole new wave of happiness rolling through his body. It's snowing on Christmas morning. The same Christmas morning he'd first woken up with John Watson in his bed. Could life get any better?
"Wonderful," Mycroft says, eyes locking back on Sherlock. "Would you mind excusing us for a moment? I'd like a word with my brother."
"I'm sure there isn't plenty more in the fridge," John laughs as Mike rolls his eyes and hands the remainder of the cans to Sherlock.
Pale cheeks go a bit pink. "Yes, well on occasion the places you take me are interesting," Sherlock feigns annoyance, gaze slanting sideways to give John a long look. "Don't hold your breath that this will always be the case."
Hips roll with every pass of John's hand along Sherlock's naval, jumping and attempting to catch the interest of that gentle touch, seeking some sort of attention accompanied by a soft hitch of breath with every twitch.
Greg laughed, tipping the drink clutched in his hand in acknowledgement. "Yeah, alright," he conceded. "So what's your plan?"
And John Watson, still half-asleep, feels another sort of warmth bloom in his chest, realization dawning on him and a happy grin taking over his mouth as he blinks into dark curls pushing into his face, the head those curls belong to pressing a smooth cheek against his chest, the rest of that pale slender body fitting itself all the way down John's frame to where his legs are tangled up perfectly with another's.
. Don't know why that's so hard for you to believe. And thanks for the vote of confidence. But I haven't… he doesn't know. Not yet. I'm still trying to work up my nerve. But he's…well it's complicated but I don't want him to think I have some sort of relationship with
John looks like a little schoolboy sitting across from him. His eyes are the size of dinner plates, his hands are clasped in his lap. He's brimming with questions and curiosity and excitement.
John snorts and wraps his arms around Sherlock's waist. "Good." His eyes flicker to the three conniving adults talking quietly. "Should we tell your dad about you and Dolly?"
Pulling back on a sigh, Sherlock blinks up at him in resignation, sighing out the last of his refusal and leveling John with a serious stare. "Fine," he acquiesces, raising a brow. "But if it's awful-"
And just like that, John's feet were carrying him toward Sherlock, wrapping fingers around his wrist and turning him around. Sherlock turned willingly, eyes closed, lips pursed as though waiting for something horrible to happen.
And then Sherlock is narrowing his eyes. "So you think you can kiss me and just, what? See what happens?"
Sherlock had stretched his back and rolled his shoulders, forcing himself to think about bees and not the blonde-haired boy who was currently throwing his sex-drive into high gear as he climbed out of the shower and redressed.
deeper than he'd even thought possible, the emptiness in his heart seeming to grow wider and enveloping him harshly, showing no mercy, not that he deserves any, feeling the pain all the way down to the tips of his toes, racking his entire body with the weight of a dead friendship.
They lived together, which made things interesting enough, but besides that, it was Sherlock he was supposedly 'dating' and that in and of itself deserved an entirely different label.
Glancing up from where he's glaring daggers into the list of pasta choices, Sherlock finds soft blue eyes filled with concern, bottom lip tucked between teeth where John gnaws at it anxiously. "I didn't mean to upset you," he murmurs, hand fidgeting on the table like he wants to reach for Sherlock's but isn't sure if he's allowed to anymore. "We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to."
"I've got it," John leaned over to the night table, keeping one hand on Sherlock as he pulled the drawer open for his supplies.
The hallways have been blessedly busy today, not a single student noticing Sherlock making his way from first period to second and now to his locker, planning to stay as under the radar as he can possibly manage, misery fogging his thoughts and making him feel much smaller, much more alone than he's ever been in his young life.
"Trust me," Irene replies sternly. "He wants to see you. Did you miss all the glances he threw in your direction the entire game? He's been eye-fucking you for two goddamn hours."
And Sherlock, looking back on it now, had been so bloody stupid. So unbelievably reckless. So unlike himself, telling Seb so much more information than he ever should have, explaining all about his stud of a boyfriend currently chasing his dream to play for the England national rugby union team, preening like a bloody peacock at how proud he was of John and how he knew he would make it in a few short years after extensive training with a professional team and on and on and on. He hadn't caught on, his young, incandescently happy, naive heart totally wrapped up in John Watson and his goals, that Sebastian was feigning interest, eyes widening with every presumed lie that fell from Sherlock's lips, mouth quirking with condescension and amusement that by the time Sherlock had finished his tale, Seb was all but on the floor, cackling away at the young boy and his fantasy world, exclaiming pity and mockery.
Lestrade nodded and ran a hand down the back of his neck. "Yeah. Listen, I wanted to apologize for last time. With Mycroft. He's... it's a delicate relationship they have, the Holmes' brothers. He just wanted to make sure all was right."
"I'm fine," he mutters, cheeks flaming at the lie having nothing to do with Phillip Anderson or his goons. "It was nothing."
Spoiled prat. He'll come back. He'll sort it out in that giant brain of his, that he overreacted and move back in and apologize and all will be right.
Sherlock had stopped his movements and glanced at John in bemusement. "The flat we've been e-mailing about, John."
John grins at the sight before him, always a glutton for Sherlock Holmes' laughter, the pink in those sharp cheekbones darkening a shade. "I suppose we can have dinner first. But after that, bed. My bed, specifically."
Sherlock spreads his legs, pulling his knees up to his chest as John slides his slick fingers inside him, preparing him slowly. Sherlock stares up at him, curls fanned out against the pillow, eyes wide and trusting as John opens him up.
John snapped his gaze back to Sherlock, narrowing his eyes. "Don't be a dick, Sherlock. Because if you remembered graduation day like I do, then you wouldn't be asking me stupid fucking questions."
of obtrusive. He's brash and snappish and absolutely fantastic and whoever the fuck had made him feel like he wasn't worth a dime was, John had decided, the worst human being in the world. Watching his brilliant, fascinating roommate curl in on himself slightly as though attempting to go invisible altogether had made John feel fiercely protective, wanting nothing more than to slip an arm around his waist and pull him close, hold him tightly and tell him that he was welcome here, that these people would be kind to him, that whoever had been cruel to him in the past were absolutely
"Which is fine!" His father suddenly surges out of his chair, waving his hands. "It's all fine, Sherlock," he says hastily. "I just… I was just curious."
He whipped around to find Sherlock peeking around the corner of the office John was still standing in.
"True, but you are the one who attended a rugby game at his own free will," John counters with an eyebrow raise. "Who would have ever thought my high-class roommate would be attending an athletic event willingly."
Even with Sherlock's obvious cold demeanor, John liked the bloke. Once he learned to control himself and not lust after him constantly, John found Sherlock kind of amazing. He was incredible to watch during lecture, all long limbed and confident, speaking to the class as though they were much higher level then they were while still making sure they understood. He moved along the front of the room with grace and elegance and a hell of a lot of arrogance. It was incredibly entertaining to watch. Sherlock owned that room and everyone, including the professor, knew it.
"They called the game for the evening," Mike smiles though his brows are furrowed with concern. "Bad weather conditions finally put a stop to this madness. You really were zoned out, weren't you?"
And it's a sight to be seen, that's for damn sure, that beautiful rugby player standing in the doorway of their dorm room so casually, hand still wrapped around the door handle, every part of his body tailored to a t for Sherlock's eyes to peruse and take in and
"Mr. Watson," Sherlock replied in the most cool, indifferent tone he could manage and looked back down to the paper he'd been reading.
“That’s it,” John groans as he thrusts into Sherlock over and over again. “Take it all.” He pants as he slides one hand from Sherlock’s hip to wrap around his cock and brings him off fast and hard because he’s done so well and deserves to come right now as John continuously pounds into him, hitting his prostate with every perfect thrust. “That’s it, come for me Sherlock.” John orders as he feels Sherlock tighten around him.
"Wait, wait," Mike said as they acquired their next round. "We have to make a deal. None of us leave without letting the other know. Buddy system." He shot John a meaningful look and John rolled his eyes.
"No no, hey," John soothes, hands reaching up to lay against Sherlock's cheeks. "None of that now. I'm not mad at you, not at all. I'm mad at
The answer of yes surprised Sherlock. Yes he would. If he had the opportunity to care for John like he had for him the day before, he absolutely would. If John needed him for anything, he would be there. No questions asked. Even the hypothetical thought of something happening to John hurt so deeply to even think about and Sherlock shuddered at that unexpected reaction. And suddenly he was making silent promises to himself. Nothing could ever happen to John. He'd make sure of it.
a big deal, John. Please believe me when I say it's a big deal. Don't go out and fuck someone just to say you did, okay? I'm telling you right now, as your best friend, you'll regret it. Seriously. I've told you this already once before. Be careful."
But somewhere along the line, Sherlock and John had become…friends. Best friends really, though John would never say that to Sherlock, knowing full well the raised eyebrow he'd receive. But they had become quite close. Sherlock was odd at the best of times, but truthfully, John kind of adored it. The boy did this thing where he knew everything about anyone with a cursory glance, calling it the Science of Deduction, having an entire website dedicated to the idea. It's how, he claimed, he knew everything about John the first day they met in the coffee shop. And he hadn't been wrong. Which was even more alarming. And why John believed almost everything Sherlock said about most people.
John hummed. "Only for you, Mr. Holmes," he replied in the sauciest tone he could muster at nine o'clock in the morning.
John had never imagined in a million years that his first time with Sherlock would be this gentle. Every touch was so loving. Not that the other things they'd done hadn't been, but John was only just finding out that getting off with your boyfriend and making love to him were two very different things.
really good, hardly even twinging anymore, the bruising finally toning down to a dull yellowish green. "I threw a ball today and the trainer said I can start tackling again in a few days. Should be ready to rock for the game next weekend."
His father beams at him and winks. "I think John might," he says, nodding to the boy next to Sherlock.
"What?" Paul demands, though the annoyance is weakened as he cowers slightly to the multiple narrowed eyes, clearly catching on that he'd definitely done something wrong, eyes darting around the group for a moment, landing on Sherlock briefly and widening ever so slightly before flickering downward. "Sorry," he mumbles to the floor in an attempt to defend himself, "John's just
"Buddy system!" Mike agrees, hooking an arm in Sherlock's. "Can't have my teammate go missing as a club. I need you next weekend, mate!"
, and another swoop of terror at being caught out about his feelings for his flatmate rolls through the curly-haired boy, feeling completely idiotic for ever even considering it.
"Go away," Sherlock bites back, ignoring the swoop of guilt in his gut at his cruelty to this harmless girl.
No, he can't spend a moment with John anywhere outside their room. He wants to make this last as long as possible.
"They want me to train with them," John had shrugged, as though that were the final nail in the coffin on his dreams, shaking his head down to the ground. "It's like eight hours from London."
He catches himself just in time, and turns, swallowing the words back down and turning toward the mess hall.
The answer is obvious but that doesn't stop the bile from rising up John's throat, the absolute worst of ideas already forming in his head and the determination to keep his roommate out of harms way strengthening all the more.
Sherlock takes the moment to glare steadily down at the stupid tiny tea light flickering barely an inch worth of fire between them.
There's an overwhelming urge to rush over and wrap him up in a cuddle because the sight of him doing something so standard as experimenting in their room makes John's heart settle in his chest, calming his racing nerves to a slow jog, hope rising within him that maybe all is not actually lost.
So now, as the History bell rung, John gathered up his things before Sally opened her big mouth again, and took off toward the library, planning a quick study session then a late dinner with Sherlock. He shot off a quick text to his flatmate as he made his way to his favorite study spot.
"That's the plan," John grins down into his rugby bag as he fishes out his own coat. "If he'll agree to go, that is."
"Agreed," John chuckles, plucking at a button on Sherlock's hoodie as his gaze travels down the rest of the genius boy's slender frame, taking in the damp and drooping clothing and furrowing his brow just the slightest before glaring up at his partner. "I see we didn't wear a coat again," he admonishes, pointing at Sherlock's chest. "Honestly, what is it with you and no coats?"
Sherlock's breath stutters and John pretends not to notice. He's well aware how fit he is and proud of it. He welcomes Sherlock's stare.
John wallowed for a moment longer, his fingers now wrinkling under the water, and the made a decision. If he ever were to run in to Sherlock again, which was likely since they obviously went to the same school, John would make up for his embarrassing lack of control over himself. He would start a conversation with the man, prove that he was actually a normal person. No thoughts or discussions about sex. Just a nice chat. He would be on his game this time, stay focused and alert. Be prepared for anything Sherlock tossed at him. Maybe he would even ask him to coffee or lunch.
Sherlock felt like the wind had been knocked out of him. He stared at his brother in disbelief, as cool, quiet rage boiled within him.
John's tone is a little accusatory and a little horrified and lot concerned but all Sherlock can do is shrug. He hasn't actually thought this all the way through, sex with a stranger not exactly an appealing thought, but it would nice to no longer be seen as some freak no one will touch, wouldn't it? Not that he'd tell anyone if he did have sex considering the person he'd like to have sex with is a boy and that would come with its own set of problems but... but for his own peace of mind, for his own internal turmoil he'd like to be on the knowing side of the teasing that no, actually, he
In an attempt to calm his rapidly beating heart, Sherlock tries to convince himself how little Mycroft actually knows. He has no idea about John. He doesn't know Sherlock has spent the better part of forty minutes learning to breathe again just from one glance at that sweaty, fit blond boy. He doesn't know about their shared takeaway nightly, or their bonding or their connection. He doesn't
The hand gives a hard yank and Sherlock spins back, falling chest-first into John Watson's strong body.
"I know," Sherlock agrees because it's true. If it weren't for Sherlock, Victor would have failed this project entirely.
Sherlock, on the other hand, seems completely at ease. His cheekbones are flushed, but his body is slack and pliant, accepting the intrusion as John presses into him. He wraps his legs around John's hips and tilts his pelvis, mouth falling open as John bottoms out within him.
The boy in his arms slowly comes down, body shaking slightly from the release, the grip on John's hair loosening. He spins on the wet floor and pushes himself into John, intertwining their legs and wrapping his long arms around John's shoulder, kissing him deeply, as though thanking him for the intense orgasm.
John could feel himself vibrating with anticipation. He was so bloody ready to move forward. Not that there was anything wrong with what they'd been doing but it still felt like there was so much more of Sherlock to explore and he desperately wanted that.
Sherlock kissed John's forehead then jerked his head to the side. "Come on. I want to show you something."
Sherlock smirks, takes the bait, and lunges, grabbing John by the shoulders and taking him down to the ground, throwing a leg over his stomach and straddling him. He wraps long fingers around John's wrists and pushing them overhead into the carpet, effectively pinning him in place. John lets out a sound of surprise but grins nonetheless, barely struggling in Sherlock's grasp, eyes clouding slightly. "I knew those ballet muscles would come in handy at some point," John croones, reaching up to capture Sherlock's lips again, still bound to the floor in Sherlock's tight grasp.
It's so silly and so John, Sherlock can't help a soft chuckle escaping his lips, forgetting entirely that he's in public and laughing at something no one else can see is not socially acceptable, but truthfully the genius boy simply cannot be arsed to care, familiar warm bubbles popping happily in his chest as he types his response.
He doesn't hate it. He loves it. He gets to do something for John and it's the best thing in the world.
The blue mattress provided by the school sat alone, no white sheets covering the ugly color, no boring white comforter fluffed on top with a very deep imprint of a tall lengthy body. The desk sat brown and dull, no laptop askew on the edge, no absurdly expensive microscope sitting in the center of multiple petri dishes, no piles of books scattered around it, no papers strewn in chaos. The walls were entirely bare, unpleasantly cream texture staring back at John in a taunting fashion. No newspaper clipping of crimes or investigations pinned to cover it up.
Christ, he loved that boy right back. So bloody much, it almost hurt. He never knew in all his years on this earth that he could feel like this. Like someone could complete him so utterly. Like having John in his world, a part of everything in his life would make him so unbelievably happy. He couldn't stifle the grin that took over his face.
"He's spending the weekend with his brother." John's thoughts are smudging a bit as he realizes he's leaving town tonight, leaving Sherlock by himself in their room with a pretentious prick on the loose prowling after him. He's thankful that Victor probably has no idea that Sherlock would rather undergo some form of painful torture than spend one moment with Mycroft Holmes, which he basically deems the same thing.
The corners of Sherlock's mouth quirk in the softest of shy smiles. "Thanks," he mumbles, grasping John's hand with a firm shake.
So now here they are, walking straight into foreign terrain, though the pressure is eased a bit by the fact that Greg Lestrade is walking over with them, the two rugby players deep in conversation about the game leaving Sherlock to his own devices and raging internal thoughts and panic, silently following at John's side but keeping a good distance away, careful not to touch him or breathe him in because John's scent is intoxicating and smelling him would only lead to touching him which would only lead to other things that Sherlock is 98.9% sure aren't appropriate in public.
He watches as Sherlock throws his head back and laughs at something Molly says, falling back on his palms, body shaking with mirth.
And without warning, John is suddenly sitting up and back onto his knees, and Sherlock wraps his legs around John's back and holds on tight, arms still locked around John's neck, unable to let go, terrified that if he does he may float away and never return. John's arms are wrapped just as tightly around his back, one hand pressed flat between his shoulder blades, the other wrapped around his ribs, face buried at the base of Sherlock's neck, breathing harsh breathes against his skin.
