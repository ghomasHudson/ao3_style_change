Tony turned around looking at the different people and their information now projected all around him. “He needs to go.” Tony swiped the profile away. “He looked like a troll, did I really highlight him? Don’t answer that JARVIS.”
Could she really be right? Honestly she rarely wasn’t, but this wasn’t some kind of mission or interrogation. This was her suggesting that Steve, of all people, had feelings for him. That was ridiculous, wasn’t it? Why would someone like Steve fall for someone like Tony? Good looks and everything, sure, but Tony wasn’t exactly loveable, was he? If the way he constantly pissed off people or pushed them away was anything to go by. But then again, except for himself, Natasha probably was closest with Steve, she did know him pretty well, to say nothing of her observing skills.
Maybe he seemed too perfect? Perfect was never something Steve had gone for. He actually liked flaws, they reminded him about humanity and that even he was still human. Surely even Lincoln would have his weaknesses, but still.
While Steve stepped outside, he went back inside, making his way over to Tiffany. He stared down at her and even though he didn’t have the mask on, he was sure, his gaze was intimidating enough. “Listen, I’m sure you’re sweet and all that, but I don’t think you make a good match. Don’t count on another date, alright?”
Steve made his way over to his usual spot on the couch, before he asked, “So, how do you wanna play this?”
Turning around, Steve watched Tony for a few moments. “What’s with the matchmaking? Since when do you care so much about my love life?”
Tony smiled sadly, he was glad that Steve reached out to him, but Steve thinking Tony might not want him here stung him.
Natasha was already waiting for him in front of the building and when he approached and they hugged, she eyed him conspicuously but didn’t say anything. Yet.
Tony looked at the tablet that just lit up and showed the security footage from the elevator. “Thanks, J.”
When Steve looked up, his eyes were a little wider than usual, he probably didn’t expect Tony to talk about Bucky. At least not in a nice way.
For a few moments she just looked at him, eyebrows knitted, but when she finally seemed to understand, she just shrugged. A twisted smile played at her lips. That was as good as it got, Tony supposed.
“Sorry. I just don’t know what I’m doing here. I mean, I’m not sure how I got here and I probably most definitely need some sleep sometime, but that doesn’t mean I
He jumped up when he hit on an idea. Making his way to the elevator, he reached for his phone to text Natasha ‘I need your help.’
To stop Tony from saying anything, Steve leaned back and gently pressed his lips to Tony's. He froze for a second before he eagerly returned the soft pressure.
Tony practically beamed, he had never been fond of reporters but right now he couldn’t care less. On the contrary.
Others were too fancy, smart but appeared to be know-it-all or just seemed to try too hard. At the end there were only two options left and Tony still wasn't happy with the choice.
When Steve was about to leave he noticed Tony standing in the door, a thoughtful expression on his face. “Steve.. you don't have to go.”
Steve shifted closer until he was pressed against Tony from leg to shoulder, carefully reaching out his arm, after folding back the blanket. Placing his hand on Tony’s abdomen he slowly moved further down until he reached the waistband of his boxer briefs, but before he could continue his way Tony lifted his hips and pulled down his underwear. With that barrier gone Steve went straight for his dick. Surprised to find him that hard already he closed his fist around it, instantly starting to move.
Happy that he didn’t get it wrong, he let out a sigh of relief. “Thank god, for a second there I thought I fucked up,” he said, trying to make it sound like a joke, but Steve probably knew that he was serious anyway.
“Don’t you think it’s kinda unfair that they think it’s okay to discuss our relationship? Besides.. do you remember Tiffany?”
When Tony pushed his tongue into his mouth, Steve lowered his body until he was firmly pressed into Tony. Shifting ever so slightly, he rolled his hips forward, causing both of them to break the kiss, groaning. And for the first time they acknowledged that they’d been half-hard the whole time. Steve instantly brought his lips back to Tony’s, kissing him a little more passionate, but still savouring. Tony buried his hands in Steve’s hair before he let one of his hands wander until it reached his ass. Grabbing his cheek, he pulled him down even further. Steve closed his eyes and let his head fall back as another guttural noise escaped his lips. He slowly started to move his body, rolling his hips forward again and again. Their growing erections perfectly lined up, brushing together with every thrust. Moaning, Tony’s hands started to move again, trying to cover as much skin as possible, while Steve went back to nibbling at his neck without stopping the movement of his hips.
Trying his best to ignore that fuzzy feeling building in his chest, Steve just grinned at him before holding out his hand to help Tony up.
“I’m not jea..” Tony paused, taking a deep breath, before he continued a little bit calmer, “it’s not that. I just.. I can’t do this, Steve. I can’t come off second best in this.”
Tony couldn’t help but stare at her open-mouthed. How the hell did she figure this out? “Fucking spy,“ was all he said through gritted teeth.
“Oh come on, Stark. You two have been pining for each other for months. Had I known it would only take sharing a bed for you to finally act on it, I would’ve made sure this would’ve happened long ago. Anyway, first both of you were as happy as can be and now the both of you are moping. Hence you finally got your shit together and then lost it when you broke it off again.”
hand caused a well known warmth to rise in his body. Going by his ragged breath Tony was just the same. He thrusted up his hips and came only a few seconds later. Steve almost expected him to loosen his grip, but he kept on stroking, making Steve follow only moments later.
“We were supposed to go on a date when I..” “Oh shit, Steve. I’m sorry,” Bucky immediately interrupted him. “I wouldn’t have called if I had known.”
“You have never heard of this show, have you?” Steve asked faux-serious but couldn’t help but laugh. Both of them turned their attention to the TV, waiting for the player’s answers. The first three were rather boring, but on the board at least. The fourth,
Since his other plans were even more stupid, he decided to just be upfront and ask Steve to meet him, guessing that was the best shot that he got.
“Tony!” she exclaimed, raising her hands as if she was just about managing not to grab and shake him. “What the hell are you talking about?”
“You know how you sometimes feel like you’re not good enough for him? I’m guessing he’s thinking the same.”
“You didn’t say anything when I kinda told you that I like men, too.” It was rather a statement than a question.
Suddenly he somehow didn't seem as confident as he usually was. Was he nervous? Steve side eyed him cautiously so he wouldn’t get caught. Tony still looked relaxed, but like he was lost in thought, he almost came across as shy. Which was usually one of the last words you would use to describe Tony Stark. Before he could dwell on that thought, Tony started speaking again, “But it’s still nice. Problems seem a lot less big when you take a step back. Literally. I like to take walks when everything is a bit too much.”
“Tony,” he murmured, unsure of what he wanted to say, only knowing that he had to get Tony’s attention to stop him from staring, because it was driving him crazy. And it worked, his name seemed to pull him out of his trance, a small smirk appearing on his lips.
“I’m sorry. I should have explained.. I mean, I tried, but it didn’t go so well.” Tony grimaced, making Steve laugh softly. Which was a good sign this time.
The disappointment was within a limit since he didn’t really cherish any hope, or tried to at least. It was rather some kind of hurt, realizing that his feelings were one-sided. Knowing that whatever future he thought he’d might have won’t happen. Not with Tony and probably not with anyone else. He hadn’t even admitted to himself until now, but Steve had never felt so close to anyone but Tony, never had feelings so strong.
A possible opportunity arose two days later when Clint announced it was time for movie night again. Even though usually the whole team was around during movie nights, Tony and Steve sometimes stayed back when the others already left. Being the ones used to little to no sleep, they often enjoyed each other's company, talking or relishing the quiet before going to bed way too late. So with a little bit of luck, Tony would be there tonight and would stay longer than the rest of the team. Then Steve would only have to muster the courage to talk to Tony, hoping he wouldn't ask too many questions.
Turning around, Tony made his way back into the living room. “Come on in. Unless you’re here to mother me as well. In this case I’d advise you to leave.” He threw a scrutinizing look over his shoulder, but smiled at Steve before he kept on walking.
"I know I've been an idiot and I broke your heart. Well, that's a little presumptuous, actually, but you know what I mean," Tony said, grimacing at his own rambling, but this little outburst made Steve just feel so much affection for him. This was the man he loved with all his messes, his rambling and his jokes and he was trying to tell Steve that he felt the same. At least that was what Steve read from all his between the lines talking. He smiled at him softly when Tony went on.
“You mean other than them basically having heart-eyes everytime they so much as look at each other?”
He rolled his eyes and threw the shirt at Tony before he made his way to the kitchen, not waiting for Tony to get up. Smart guy, he probably knew Tony would take his time, he was the last one to arrive at breakfast every morning after all.
“I can protect myself, I wear a suit of armour,” Tony cut in firmly, but not as harsh as he would moments ago.
The following days were like every other day in Avenger Tower. Even though Steve would have prefered to have a few days to himself and not run into Tony, he made sure to not deliberately ignore him. The last thing he needed was anyone noticing that something was up. Not that long ago it was normality, but the team wasn’t used to Steve and Tony
“I love trash TV?” Steve exclaimed. “Seriously? You are ridiculous. You’re the only reason we have a TV in the first place.” Steve had to pause after every other word because he was laughing so hard, but Tony only pouted and rolled his eyes.
Steve didn’t even try to say anything, until a few minutes later when they landed in front of a house that vaguely reminded Steve of the one Tony had in Malibu.
The New York City lights in the background, holding on tight, kissing Steve after he had just told him that he loved him, Tony figured this was the most perfect moment.
Steve laughed a little at Tony’s curiosity and made his way over to the small couch. His steps deliberately slow just to tease the other man. The sound of chair casters scraping on the floor indicated that Tony was impatiently shuffling around on his chair and Steve somehow enjoyed keeping him in suspense. When he sat down, Tony just about stared at him, still waiting for an answer.
“Excuse me?” Tony screeched. He wasn’t proud of it, but there wasn’t any other word to describe the pitch that just left his mouth.
The movement caused them to break apart for a moment, but Steve instantly brought their lips together again. Tony raised his hands to Steve’s lapel, trying to push the jacket down his shoulders, but Steve suddenly stopped him by putting a hand on Tony’s chest, gently pushing him away. “Tony, wait.” He kissed him briefly as if to comfort him. “I just.. I can’t do this if we’ll go our separate ways tomorrow. I’m not that kind of guy.. I’ve had feelings for you for quite some time and I need to make sure that this is not a one-time thing for you. Otherwise I’d rather leave now.”
“I don't know? We don't really have the best record? We usually can’t get five minutes without fighting? One normally doesn't.. Do stuff like that with his teammates? A thousand reasons, actually." Steve snorted amused. Now that he thought about it, he could come up with a few reasons. Not that he had spent much time thinking about it until a few minutes ago. Sure, he would lie if he said he never noticed how attractive Tony was. Not only external, but also his personality, even though Steve would also lie if he said he never found himself checking out his perky butt.
“Tony and I had a fight..,” Steve trailed off. He considered how he could tell Bucky what had happened without it sounding like it was his fault. He knew that Tony wasn’t too fond of him, but Steve didn’t want him to feel guilty.
Three days after that Tony was in his workshop, running tests on some arrows he had designed for Barton. At least that’s what he had wanted to do, the reality looked kind of different. His own thoughts had distracted him over and over until he gave up. He tried to come up with characteristics he wanted to look for while he would search for Steve’s next date. None of the women had won Steve over and since he had asked for it, it was time to find him a male date next. Since Tony had suggested the dates he felt like he failed at his job and didn’t want to repeat his mistake. But somehow it was hard to imagine the perfect partner for Steve. For some reason it was even harder to think of a man that would make a good match. Not because Tony had any problem with Steve being gay or bisexual or whatever. He would lie if he would say he wouldn’t have been a little surprised, but that was it. He didn’t mind one bit. Hell, who was he to judge? He had found himself checking out guys again and again and maybe even made out with a few. So Steve liking men was not the problem at all. It was rather the difficulty to picture anyone with Steve really. Maybe he was just too perfect for anyone to live up to it.
Playfully bumping his shoulder against Tony’s, Steve grinned at him. “Should I say I told you so, or..?”
He wondered how he got so lucky that he first woke up with Steve besides him and now got to watch him make breakfast. Shirtless. He was awake, right? He pinched himself just to be sure, but the scene didn’t change. Apparently this was real. However he got here, he must have done something right.
Tony. Not only in the obvious way in noticing how truly beautiful he was, with his sleep tousled hair even more so. But also learning how giving and loving Tony really was. Without hesitation he would do everything for the team, always putting everybody else before himself. He was nothing like the Tony Stark everyone got to see in interviews or press conferences, Steve would even go so far as to say he was the polar opposite. Well except for being a sassy loudmouth maybe.
"Mmh, tell me about it,” Tony sighed, serious for a moment, before he asked, “but you know what would make you stop thinking?"
Bucky smiled at him fondly, apparently he knew something Steve didn’t know. He hoped he would enlighten him.
Steve cleared his throat, he didn’t exactly expect Tony to return the favor but he was definitely not going to turn him down. “Yeah.”
“Steve, there really is no reason for you to be sorry. He’s your best friend and he needed you. Not that I would know, but I guess that’s what friends are for.” Tony saw that Steve was about to respond to it, but he just kept on talking. “I’m the one that needs to apologize. I kinda felt rejected. I don’t know why someone like you would bother with someone like me and that’s why I was jealous. But I trust you, Steve.”
Tony knew better than to keep his hope up, but his heart still skipped a beat at the beginning of Steve’s sentence. But he really wanted to stop and unfortunately Tony was out of ideas to convince him.
When Steve returned, he wore one of Tony’s t-shirts. His ridiculously tight clothes had always been a distraction to Tony, but the fact that this shirt was ridiculously tight on his body because it was Tony’s was just
Not that any of them would put it into so many words, but Steve had basically saved Tony. When they first met, Tony had been an ass. Not just to Steve, but in general. In spite of that Steve had always been there for him. They both had been friends with Natasha for quite some time, but somehow never met until one night at Puzzles, their local bar, and Tony didn’t even try to be nice to him. He usually wasn’t rude to friends of his friends, or people in general, not on purpose at least. But the shit he had gotten at home that weekend was enough for him to not care about anything. It wasn’t exactly news that Howard yelled at him and told him what a disappointment he was, but as just so often it had kind of escalated into an epic shouting battle. However, Steve still had made sure that he had gotten home okay that night, calling him a cab when he was too drunk to even care where he would sleep. And that was just the start. Whenever he had another fight with his father, Steve had been there for him, telling him he was way better than Howard, restoring parts of his self-confidence and, more importantly, his self-worth. Whenever he had too much to drink, Steve had scraped him off the sidewalk and took him home. And finally, when Howard had kicked him out of his own flat, freezing his bank accounts, so he wouldn’t ‘ruin him or drink himself to death’ (and whose fault would that have been, hm?) Steve offered him to be his new roomie. They hadn’t even really known each other at this point and Sam had just moved out. So Steve was searching for a new roommate anyway, but with Tony he didn’t even know when he would be able to pay his part of the rent. He still insisted that Tony would move in right away. Somehow they had managed to become really good friends through all of it. Steve being as patient and gracious as one can be, making Tony want to be better along the way. He still didn’t understand how Steve stomached him and the mess that was his life
“This has nothing to do with..,” he trailed off, when he looked at Tony for the first time after carefully avoiding it.
He forced himself to look away, he wanted to save at least a little bit of his dignity. He stood up and took his empty plate, but before leaving for the kitchen he gently stroked Steve’s hair with his free hand and
Steve had told himself that maybe Tony was right and it would be good for him to get to know someone. That’s why he had agreed to meet Kirsten in his favorite café. At least he wanted the date to take place in an environment he was used to. The first few minutes had been quite awkward, the smalltalk rather brusquely and they hadn’t known what to talk about. Until they had agreed that they both couldn’t imagine anything between then. From that point on they had been much more at ease, talking about music and art they both liked. It had turned out to be a really nice afternoon even though they would never be more than friends at most and that’s what he told Tony.
He was answered with another chuckle. While Steve put the last pancake in the pan, Tony leaned on the counter watching him.
Possibility C: the potential partner would just worry about him all the time when he was on missions and Steve would be equally scared that something could happen to them just because they would be associated with him.
Looking at the screen Tony pondered for a few seconds if he should read the message or not. Was Steve texting him good news or rather bad news? He wasn’t sure. After a few painfully long seconds he finally opened the text, which just said ‘Staying at Tasha’s tonight’. Well. That hurt more than Tony wanted to admit, even to himself. Given the text and knowing how stubborn Steve could be, he had only texted him, because Natasha insisted. And wow, he never thought they could have
Initially he wanted to distract from his confession, but when he said it, he realized that he actually really just wanted to kiss Steve. He still was a little surprised when Steve gently smiled at him. And even though he was blushing, he closed the distance between them and gently pressed his lips to Tony’s without hesitating.
Only a few minutes later Steve stepped into the elevator. “Hey JARVIS, can you tell me where Tony is?”
“Make me.” The playfulness from just a second ago was still there, but it was now mixed with a rough undertone in Tony’s voice. Steve watched him closely when Tony took a step forward until he was directly in front of him.
Steve grinned at him as if he wanted to answer, but thought better of it. Instead he obeyed, pulling off his boots before taking off his pants and stepping into the shower. Following suit, Tony also lost his pants and got under the stream of water that Steve already adjusted to a pleasant temperature.
When Steve stepped out of the elevator he spotted Tony on the couch. “Hey, I hope I’m not interrupting?” he asked hesitantly. Maybe instantly coming up here without a plan wasn’t as good an idea as he had thought it to be.
When Steve stood up as well, he briefly contemplated what to do with the slightly less sticky mess in his own crotch, but just followed Tony’s lead, pulling up his pants, closing the fly. He’d be going for a shower as soon as he’d get to his room.
“You’re a genius, Tony, you’re never wrong,” he all but whispered, so soft that Tony almost didn’t hear him, but still making him smile.
When he reached the tree, Steve positioned Tony right in front of it before stepping around the tree to take the backside. He raised his arms to put them around the trunk, but when he tried to pull his hand from Tony’s, he didn’t let go. Glad that the tree was between them so Tony wouldn’t see him, Steve’s cheeks heated. He cleared his throat.
Tony leaned in slowly, apparently giving him time to react, to push him away if he wanted to, but Steve stayed still and just kept watching Tony. Which was probably approval enough. At least Tony seemed to think so when he closed the distance and pressed his lips to Steve’s. It was far from a soft contact, on the contrary actually, and Tony didn’t waste any time until he pushed open Steve’s lips with his tongue. Wow, okay, that was not how Steve imagined this fight to end, but he definitely wasn’t going to complain. Using his grip on Tony’s upper arms he pulled him even tighter, eagerly returning the kiss.
Tony made his way over to the coffee machine, putting his hand in the small of Steve’s back as he came to stand next to him.
Tony had the decency to look like Steve just insulted him. “Come on, Cap. We’re friends, I just think you deserve someone special.”
“So, uhm, I feel like I have to say this. You know I’m a mess, but I really wanna give this a shot. So what’d you say? Let's just.. see how it'll go?”
Tony hummed. If in approval or to let him know he listened, Steve didn’t know. They continued to walk in silence, until Tony spoke again. “It’s the same for me. Kinda. I mean my brain doesn’t do pauses with.. you know..”
Just in time with Tony leaning forward, Steve met him halfway, bringing their lips together again. The kiss was just as gentle, but way more passionate, filled with so many emotions. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist while Tony held onto his neck, neither of them caring for the rain that still poured down on them.
They had walked home after Tony had disabled the Iron Man suit, they didn’t need to draw any more attention. On the way Steve had told him about Tiffany and how she just hadn’t seemed to keep her hands to herself.
Tony just stared at him, probably wondering why he was even telling him and Steve just watched him. He didn’t know if Tony would get what he was trying to say, but he really hoped he didn’t have to say it. He wasn’t even sure how he had managed to be so calm. His mind probably hadn’t caught up with what he was doing.
“It’s not? And here I was getting my hopes up.” His voice was steady, his gaze fixed on Steve, he was sure of this.
When Steve came into view, Tony got up, but stayed where he was, fumbling with the hem of his shirt as he anxiously waited for him to approach.
The next three days went by in a haze. They felt like the longest days Steve ever experienced. Not even marching into a war felt remotely like what he was feeling. In the war he didn’t know what to expect exactly at least. Right now it was rather like coming home from war. Not knowing what to feel, too many or just no feelings at all, like not belonging.
Apparently Steve didn’t believe him, because he just gave him a pointed look. Well, shit. Tony should have considered that this was Steve and that he wouldn’t just drop this. How the hell was he getting out of this situation? He should’ve gone for the stuck elevator. Maybe he should just tell the truth. Get this off his chest and then carry on. If he left out the rather spicy details it wouldn’t be too bad, right? Steve was a good guy, Tony couldn’t imagine that he would judge him for it. Or stop being friends with him. Oh god, was he really gonna tell him? Steve definitely expected an answer going by the look on his face.
as something you could put on top of a salad? Sometimes he really wondered where they found these people on the show. After frequently looking at the TV more than his papers, but apparently still trying his best to concentrate, it took about ten minutes until Steve ditched his studies completely. Nobody could resist Family Feud, that was a fact. As so often they scoffed at especially stupid answers and guessed along with the players, which always ended up in some kind of contest or discussion.
The next day he made sure that everyone was able to see him off and he told them that he’d be back to bother them with training sessions sooner than they’d like. He didn’t want it to look as if he was bolting.
“Don’t be.” Steve smiled. He decided to let Tony off the hook, that was probably enough guilt for one day. “I’m sure you didn’t know any better. But she was actually really nice. I mean I didn’t need all that information about her tattoos.” Steve paused while Tony had to suppress his laughter. “Anyway she’s just too.. 21st century for me, but we had a cheerful talk. Well, she did most of the talking but still. The date was entertaining, but she’s not for me. She was actually even kinda intimidating to be honest.”
Tony stared at the letter, trying to process what he just read. His look went to the phone that had accompanied it and back to the letter. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he let the paper fall on the desk, only to reach for it again only a few seconds later. He read the words again and again without seeming to understand the meaning of them. Finally he decided to let the letter be and got up to make his way to the workshop, but not without pocketing the phone first. Maybe his latest project would be able to get his mind off of the words whirring through his head.
When Steve looked back he saw Tony standing there, appearing irresolute with an expression Steve again wasn’t able to read.
Steve watched him for a few moments, but his answer seemed to have been enough for him because he gripped Tony’s jacket and jerked him forward until their lips were pressed together. Tony grabbed Steve’s shoulders. Not only did he need to steady himself but he wasn’t sure how long his legs would hold him upright if they kept on kissing like this. Steve’s hands roaming over his back didn’t help either. He really needed to do something about this.
Gripping his shoulders, Tony turned him a little, navigating him further into the workshop and even though Steve didn’t fully understand what he was up to, he was happy to play along. Anything as long as Tony’s lips wouldn’t leave his own. He grunted, discontent, when just in that moment Tony broke the kiss to breathe. He didn’t move far though and made his way to Steve’s jaw until he was sucking on his neck, causing Steve to let out another sound. A much more pleased one, this time.
Anyway, cancelling wasn’t an option with Natasha and he really wanted to see something else than his work, his bed or the inside of his coffee mug. So he made his way to one of their favorite little restaurants a few minutes down the street.
Tony checked himself in the mirror for the fifth time in the last two minutes. He was supposed to finally get ready but instead of buttoning his shirt or putting on his bowtie, he wasted time overthinking. Not that he usually didn’t spend much time thinking, but right now it was even worse. He had let Pepper talk him into attending yet another SI event he would hate. Sure, it was still his company but didn’t he have personnel for stuff like this? Anyway, Tony had thought it would be clever to invite Steve to tag along. Who wouldn’t want Captain America for good PR, right? Only that this was not the reason why Tony had asked him to join. His reason was way more selfish and even though at the time it had seemed like a good idea, Tony now felt like it would end in a disaster.
“Oh come on, we’re just having some fun,” Tony tried to convince him. After he had a taste of what it was like to be like this around Steve, he wasn’t ready to give this up just yet. At least not without a fight.
“And what?” he snapped at her. “Damnit Natasha, I’m awake for.. I don’t even know how long. What the fuck is it that you’re trying to tell me?”
much better. Tony smiled. That was enough of a promise for now. Maybe he would get to wake up next to Steve more regularly after all.
Steve only chuckled when he made his way up to their room. At least Tony seemed to be awake enough to rant at him. That was probably a good sign, especially since it meant that there was no embarrassment between the two of them going on. They probably had been through enough to not be weirded out by this. Which probably said a lot.
Thankfully Lincoln didn’t seem to be angry or anything, he smiled at Steve, patting him on the shoulder. “Well, good luck then. Go get him. And thank you for being honest. ”
Thank you to everyone who read the first chapter AND came back for the second :D And thank you for kudos and comments of course.
And that was it. Just like that. No awkward silence, nothing. Apparently Tony didn’t even care, which meant a lot since he was one of Steve’s best friends at this point.
“That’s not your call to make,” Tony growled while he stepped around the counter before leaning against it again. He needed to distance himself to process what Steve had said, what it meant. Usually he would be far angrier if someone told him they’d think he’d hurt himself, at the implication that he wasn’t capable. But Steve’s words were way too personal, he actually cared about Tony. Not longer in only a ‘you’re my friend’ way, as far as Tony was concerned.
Tony still stared at him, he seemed to have difficulties understanding what was going on. “So, lemme get this straight.. You compared your date to.. me? And that means.. you’re saying that you like me?” Tony asked, his voice hinted with hope now. Steve shrugged, still smiling softly “I guess.”
how to be rude, but you could tell how bad he wanted to get away from her by the way he didn’t take his time to apologize adequately.
“I think I will. And just to be clear, I guess I would’ve taken kindly to it.” Tony chuckled softly.
No matter how often they would kiss it would be similar and yet totally different, Tony thought, still surprised at how well their bodies fitted together. With that thought he licked Steve’s lip, asking for entrance, causing Steve to open his mouth. When their tongues touched Steve moaned and grabbed Tony’s ass. In one swift move he lifted Tony up, seating him on the counter. They broke apart at the movement and Tony stared at him with knitted eyebrows. “Do I even weigh anything to you?”
He leaned his cheek against the smooth bark and immediately found the touch calming. After another few seconds he opened his eyes and when he peeked around the tree, he looked into a pair of brown eyes. Beautiful, brown eyes to be precise. He wanted to move away, bring distance between them, but he couldn’t seem to be able to convince himself. Instead he just watched Tony who gently smiled at him.
“You’re a good man. You helped save so many people, without you we couldn’t have done it at times. But more than that you’re a role model to the younger Avengers, you make boring meetings fun. Actually you’re what’s holding the team together. They miss you.. I miss you. Don’t you want to come back to.. us?”
“We’ve known each other for our whole lives and he knows how much you care about me, he’s just afraid to lose you.”
But when he was about to turn around Tony grabbed his arm. He stopped and saw the pleading look in Tony’s eyes. “Steve, please.”
Gripping Steve’s hips for steadiness Tony raised himself on tiptoes to bring their mouths together. Steve hummed content and tilted his head to meet Tony, who gently licked along his lips, asking for entrance. Opening his mouth, Steve took the opportunity to nudge Tony’s tongue with his own.
Anyway, there had been many little and even a few big things that made Steve realize that he had fallen for Tony. At this point it had been months of knowing and not doing anything about it. Even though it was no secret that Tony was bisexual and that, apparently, he liked to touch Steve, a lot, he was afraid to tell him. Actually, anxious came closer, like really, really anxious. So much that he paced the corridor for ten minutes instead of getting it over with. He had been part of a world war, crashed a plane and fought aliens and gods, but retrospectively nothing had been as scary as the conversation he was about to have.
It was far from fair play and initially he wanted to keep this favor until he would really need it, but he knew Steve wouldn’t ask another question if he brought this up. And to be honest, he really wanted him to agree to his plan. Tiffany had been one of those ladies Natasha had tried to set Steve up with. And to say the date was horrible was a huge understatement. It took about ten minutes until Steve had called Tony and basically begged him to get him out of there. So he had, but not without mentioning that he owed him of course.
When Steve entered the room Tony was glad to see that he seemed to be just as nervous. He probably tried not to let it show, his posture upright and imposing as ever, but his steps were tentative. After a glance at Tony, he averted his eyes, fixing a spot to Tony’s right.
he did, that is. Or that.. I fell for him,” Tony trailed off, closely watching Steve’s reaction. A faint smile played at his lips as he turned a little more towards Tony. His hand twitched as if he wanted to reach out but decided against it.
Steve hummed in approval, taking a look around in search of the bathroom until Tony shoved him in the right direction and followed him.
If Tony’s face hadn’t been already flushed from their kissing and his arousal, he would have blushed now at the latest.
For a few moments they just stood there, watching each other. He had no clue what was going on in Steve’s head, but Tony’s mind was racing. He tried to come up with a solution or answer to everything Steve could possibly say or do. He was even about to tell Steve this was just a joke, only to get out of this situation, but then Steve started talking.
“I’m fine, Steve. I really am. I’m sorry if it sounded otherwise. We talked about you in my session today, that’s why I called you. I may have sounded a little emotional, but rather because I was happy to talk to you.” Bucky rubbed his neck, slightly embarrassed. He still wasn’t always comfortable talking about his feelings. But when Steve took a closer look he could see that it was true. Not that Bucky would lie to him, but he really seemed rather happy. It was now Steve’s turn to pat his shoulder.
“I just wanted to let you know that I’ve decided to move out.. temporarily,” he told the team that was gathered in the communal living room. Most of their eyes were wide with shock or surprise or somewhat similar. Steve saw that a few of them wanted to say something, but he cut them off, not wanting them to try and convince him to stay.
Five minutes until Steve would arrive, which meant five more minutes for Tony to freak out. He pushed a hand through his hair in an attempt to perfect his messy hairstyle, smoothed down his shirt, even though there wasn’t a crinkle in sight and checked his bag again. He didn’t want to go full on picnic mode in case Steve didn’t want to do this, but he wanted to come prepared and brought a few appetizers and champagne.
Possibility D: the potential partner would figure out how different Steve Rogers and Captain America really were. Once they would find out that Steve was, at heart at least, still a scrawny, anxious kid from Brooklyn when he took off the uniform they would break up with him. And that one was possibility E at the same time, because Steve really was still anxious and didn’t even know how to have a relationship so he would screw the whole thing up all by himself if anyone would make it far enough.
Tony pushed his hands into his hair, he was a genius goddamnit, why couldn’t he come up with something? He decided to solve the smaller problem first, so he showered and changed into some other clothes. When he was done he had cooked up about six different ideas. He had considered asking Natasha for help so Steve would think he would be meeting her. Which, well, could have been a good plan if it wasn’t for the fact that the two of them were currently kind of living together. Then he thought about faking an accident, so Steve would have a choice but come to the flat. Which was a stupid scheme, because it wouldn’t end in Steve listening to him, but in him yelling at Tony for lying. The best option so far had been to just pay him a visit at Natasha’s flat, but that way he would kind of corner him and Steve didn’t really like that. And anyway, Tony wanted to talk to him, but not at any cost. He didn’t want to force Steve. How many bad ideas were you allowed to have when you were considered a genius after all?
Steve didn’t come home after his usual running time window. He also didn’t come home one, two or three hours later and even though Tony tried so hard to concentrate on his work and to deliberately not think about Steve, he couldn’t help but start to worry. It was only when Nat shot him a text an hour later, telling him that Steve was with her, (because she just knew that he would worry, bless her heart) that he could relax a little. It hurt that, apparently, Steve and him weren’t even talking, but he tried his best not to go there. Instead he dove into his current project head first. If there was anything that could always distract him, it had something to do with engineering. Building something or trying to understand how something was built had always been his safe space. For as long as he could think this was the only way to ignore any unpleasant event or feeling, drinking aside.
Nervously Steve paced up and down the corridor. He stopped in front of the elevator before turning around to walk away. Again. He had been at it for the last ten minutes and the odds of him finally stepping
“Yeah, I guess we both didn’t know back then. That we.. like each other.” Tony laughed nervously before he continued, “thank god, I chose the one that was the exact opposite of me, right?”
Where did that come from? That was definitely not Tony’s plan. He should have known better but sometimes he simply forgot how sassy Steve could be.
“It’s just.. fun and games, you know.” When he didn’t answer right away, Tony added, “don’t worry, you don’t have to marry me, Rogers.”
And now there were thoughts he definitely didn’t want to have. Maybe he should think about something else? Now seemed like as good a time as any to think about those tight shirts of Steve. Or his ass. Maybe not his ass. That
Looking down at the blanket Tony was standing on, Steve tilted his head in question, asking, “what is this?”
They both groaned collectively this time and Tony momentarily let his head rest against Steve’s chest, letting his hands fall to his sides, before he said, “well at least we don’t have to awkwardly tell the team, right?”
Tony didn’t mind, maybe talking could be delayed. There were more important things at hand. For example Steve’s defined upper body directly in front of him or rather between his legs.
They swiftly found a mutual rhythm, jerking each other slowly without their lips separating longer than necessary. Despite their tardy strokes, their firm grip quickly put them on the edge and after only a few more tight strokes,Tony reached his climax. The sound of his whine was muffled by Steve’s mouth, before he broke the kiss. Steve looked at Tony, who had closed his eyes, expression soft as he enjoyed the aftermath of his orgasm. The sight as well as Tony’s hardened grip made him get off just seconds after him.
“Oh my god.” Was all Natasha said, but she looked much calmer now, a small smile tugging at her lips.
Steve couldn’t suppress a shudder. Taking a deep breath, inhaling the fresh yet somehow metallic scent surrounding Tony, while his breath still ghosted over his ear, he felt his determination crumble piece by piece with every passing second, Tony being this close just felt too good. And really what was one more time, right?
Only a few minutes after he started working on his project again, he was interrupted by a knock. Since he had left the door open, it could only be Steve. He came down there quite often, lounging on the small couch, keeping Tony awake during all-nighters and company during the days. But he never just entered the room, he always knocked. No matter how many times Tony had told him to just come in.
Tony chuckled while his hand continued his way to grip the hem of the fabric, trying to get rid of the underwear. Assisting him, Steve raised his hips and used his free hand to help Tony push down his boxers. As soon as the clothes were gone Steve felt the unexpected soft skin of Tony’s hand against his dick and couldn’t help but moan at the contact.
While he stepped back, letting Steve into his flat, it was his turn to watch him closely. “I’m fine, Steve. What’s up?”
"I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm in. For worse or for better. If you'll still have me, that is. I mean, if you.. Oh God, is this inappropriate? Are you seeing someone? Please don't tell me.. Maybe I should leave."
Today was Steve’s first date with someone from an online dating platform. Not that he knew, Tony made sure of it, otherwise he would probably have refused to go. But even Tony could run out of resources sometimes. Just like now when he had already tried five times to end the boring board meeting he was in. They had gone round in circles for hours and even though it was six o’clock already there was no end in sight. He had somehow hoped to catch Steve later when he would be back from his date, but right now it didn’t look like it. He wasn’t even sure
“Remember those taser thingies Natasha liked to use? Before they, you know, malfunctioned, at least. A few days ago I came up with an idea how to- Steve?” He interrupted his own jabbering, looking at Steve, brows furrowed with concern. “You okay?”
“I don’t..,” he trailed off as soon as he caught sight of her perfectly raised eyebrow, looking perfectly unimpressed. “Uhm.. how did you..?”
He finally buttoned his white dress shirt, there was no way he would get out of this situation and maybe Steve wouldn’t even look that good. Tony rolled his eyes at himself because as if. He tried to remind himself that he had wanted to have Steve around so he wasn’t alone feeling out of place, he needed the support. Besides who knew when he would get the next chance at seeing him dressed up.
“Yeah..,” he whispered, almost ashamed to talk about it. “I’m really sorry about that, I just couldn’t.. Wait, What?”
Steve cleared his throat, checking if anyone had seen him getting carried away, but he was still the only one around and Tony was still working, so he was in the clear. Sighing he made his way to the door and when Tony startled at his knock on the doorframe he was sure that he hadn’t seen him staring at least.
He tried his best to not meet anyone at all, stayed in his apartment for most part of the day and only left when he was sure to not find someone. His runs were postponed to late evening or even nighttime, he couldn't sleep anyway. His food intake reduced to a bare minimum so he didn’t run out of groceries. Natasha attempted to talk to him several times, knocking on his door, yelling at him to open up. But he stayed put. Just like he ignored any incoming call. The only thing he wanted was being left alone, he needed time to process everything without constantly being asked if he was okay. He was not, but he didn’t want to talk about it either.
“He’s my best friend, Tony. I’m worried about him, I can’t just ignore his calls. But there’s no need to be jealous.” Steve tried his best to stay calm, he got where Tony came from, but that didn’t necessarily mean that he understood or liked it. He wasn’t particularly happy to leave Tony like this either, but the last thing he wanted was having to choose between his best friend and his partner.
Still a little puzzled but somehow excited Tony handed the phone back to Steve after texting Pepper that everything was going alright. He might have even used the word ‘perfectly’ after what he had just found out.
“What?” In his defense, Tony had been distracted by his own thoughts, so he really didn’t quite follow. But Steve just huffed and rolled his eyes at him.
"It's no secret that I don't sleep much, but I know for a fact that the same goes for you. I sometimes hear you in the kitchen on my nightly strolls."
Steve furrowed his brows for a second before smiling. He probably didn’t want to let his confusion show. “Of course I do, Anthony. Dr. Banner truly is brilliant.”
He probably wouldn’t be allowed to demand his favor if Steve knew that Tony had pretty specifically told Tiffany to stay away from Steve. Not only because he was his friend and had asked him for his help, but because Tony had been jealous that she got to go on the date that Tony would never have.
“I would even go so far as to say he’s waiting for you, Captain.” Did Steve just imagine JARVIS sounding amused?
“I just thought you could spend more time together without being away from me too much. It’s actually rather selfish and I’d understand if..”
“Mr. Stark, good evening. If you’d allow me to steal a second of your time. I’m dying to know what you think of Dr. Banner’s approach to the antielectron collision.” That guy seemed genuinely excited about this, so Tony decided to play nice.
“Steve..,” Tony started, but trailed off, momentarily distracted by the way Steve’s eyes were watching him thoughtfully, making him look a little sad but kind of hopeful at the same time. Clearing his throat, he started again. “Look, I think.. we.. There was this misunderstanding and you thought.. and I thought.” Tony knew he absolutely didn’t make any sense, so instead of continuing to stumble, he did the only thing he thought would tell Steve what he had wanted to say. Closing the distance between them, he got up on his tiptoes and brushed his lips against Steve’s. The contact was soft, chaste, but felt oh so good because of how long Tony had wanted to do this.  After a few seconds just in time with him breaking the kiss he felt Steve’s hands on his upper arms. He was gently shoving him backwards, which wasn’t really a good sign. But at least he didn’t push him away. Did Tony read something wrong? Maybe Natasha had misunderstood Steve? Tony felt his hopes falter and when he stepped back and saw the pained look on Steve’s face he was sure that he wouldn’t get to have this. But before he could apologize or run away Steve started to speak. “Why did you do that, Tony? Are you mocking me? Because if you are..” “No, no, Steve. Wait!” Tony interrupted him.
They fell silent after that, which wasn’t unusual, but it didn’t feel as comfortable as it normally did. Just when he couldn’t stand it any longer, he turned to face Tony, opening his mouth to get out what he wanted to say only to find his lips covered by Tony’s. Closing his eyes immediately at the contact, he kissed him back and he would definitely be lying if he would say it didn’t cause him to doubt his decision.
At least Steve seemed calm and didn’t sound angry or mad and even a small smile appeared on his face.
With deep breaths Tony enjoyed the aftermaths of his orgasm, but promptly reached for Steve, grabbing at his shoulder. Apparently he understood, because he crawled up until he was laying next to Tony who turned on his side, snuggling up against Steve.
Steve tried his best to hold Tony’s gaze when he looked up even though he was utterly nervous, waiting for his response. But as it turned out it took Tony only a few seconds to register what he had said until a sympathetic smile appeared on his face. “Yeah, sure. No problem, we can do that.”
He had even managed to talk him into getting help for his emotional drinking. And those were only the big ones. Steve was just absolutely perfect altogether, always kind and helpful and just a really, really great guy. And, when you look at it like that, Tony actually didn’t even have a chance. There was just no way you could not fall in love with this man. And Tony had known for quite some time now that this was how he was feeling about Steve. Not that he was going to do anything about it. He was not about to lose one of his best friends and the perfect roomie. And with everything he knew about Tony there was no way Steve would be having him. But still, from time to time moments like these made it hard to stand by what he said.
Steve rolled his eyes and even though Tony couldn’t see it, Steve was sure he would be able to hear it in his voice. "If you say 'an orgasm' I swear to God.."
talking anymore. Besides it wasn’t like they had ended a relationship, it had only been a.. Steve still didn’t even know what it had been. All he knew was that it was for the best and that he had to get over it. Tony didn’t seem to mind too much, at least Steve didn’t notice him acting any different. But then again, Tony wasn’t the one with the crush. Also he probably was used to stuff like that, other than Steve.
"I did no such thing, Captain." JARVIS was an AI, but Steve was pretty sure he tried to sound innocent. A smile played on Steve's lips.
“Not that it matters or that it’s any of my business, but I think you would make a great couple, to be honest.”
Steve placed his hand on Tony’s hips while he dipped his tongue into the pit on Tony’s collarbone before he placed a few kisses on his chest. Gently moving his hands up Tony’s sides, Steve straightened again, sliding one hand along Tony’s body until he cupped his jaw while he braced the other arm on the wall. Tony’s head instantly tilted up to meet Steve’s lips. When they broke apart, Steve smiled down at him. “As much as I enjoy this.. Let’s wash up and get comfortable?”
Somehow they ended up discussing the right wood chopping technique and Steve absolutely hated how they managed to turn such profound topics into fights. “Do you always have to be right?” Steve asked, voice a little more cutting then he intended to as he picked up another log.
“Are you trying to tell me Captain America did the hanky-panky with other man?” There was no more irritation in Tony’s voice, he sounded amused instead, making Steve feel a little more confident than just moments ago. Opening his eyes again, he turned his head to face Tony, when he asked, “hey, what’s that supposed to mean? You don’t think I’d be good at that?”
“Steve, you don’t have to..” But he was interrupted again “I know, but I want to.” His voice was rough, but steady. He seemed to be sure.
So apparently this wasn’t a one-time thing anymore. Maybe their fighting had been sexual tension all this time.
He made his way over to where Tony had been sitting earlier. When he let himself fall into the cushions, he dragged Tony with him. After shifting a little Tony sat close to Steve, his legs on his lap, cuddled into his side. Steve put his arm around Tony’s shoulder, kissing him on the forehead.
Unsure if it was the implication that Steve was dumb or the arrogant tone, but for some reason that got him. Fastening the grip on the wood until his knuckles turned white, he pulled and, out of an impulse, ripped the log in two. Staring at the two halves on the ground, he turned and walked away. Without another word he made his way to the barn, needing some time to calm down again. He wasn’t sure why that silly argument had bothered him so much. Sure, he always hated to fight with people close to him, including Tony. But with Tony it was even worse somehow, because they didn’t seem to get along without it and Steve didn’t get why it was that way. Still, his reaction had been exaggerated and he was kind of ashamed that Tony made him lose his cool so effortlessly, that he knew how to push his buttons.
After opening Steve’s fly button and zipper, Tony slid his hands into the back of the pants, pushing them down while grabbing Steve’s ass, squeezing it. Steve moaned, letting go of Tony to push his pants down completely. While he took off his shoes and stepped out of the pant legs, Tony got rid of his own bow tie and shirt.
“I’m so very sorry, gentlemen. But Captain America needs my help, gotta go.” To emphasize his already exaggerated apology, he raised his phone like it would be proof for his excuse.
There was a brief pause, before Tony spoke, “actually I just don’t want to kick you out of bed just to.. well.. “
“Tony..,” Steve paused for a moment. “I don’t.. I.. haven’t done this before.” His cheeks turned slightly redder than they had been from their kissing. Tony cupped his face, smiling at him. “Don’t worry.” He kissed him again, a little longer this time. Reassuring, as he hoped. “Just lay down and relax. We’re starting off easy. We don’t have to do anything you don’t want.”
“Changed your mind?” Tony’s voice interrupted his thoughts, tone tender while his eyes tentatively searched for Steve’s. And even though Steve had never precisely thought about it like that, this was the moment he fell in love with Tony even more.
When his third attempt at making Natasha’s widow bites -as she repeatedly told him they’re called instead of ‘taser thingy’- stop blanking out whenever there was a certain kind or radio signal, failed, Tony groaned and decided it was time for coffee once again. Maybe the way he just wasn’t making any progress with the project was what bothered him so much, he had always hated it when things didn’t go as planned.
“Look, Tony. This was never about trust. I’d trust you with my life. I just.. I know you’ll hate this, but I wanted to protect you.”
Tony chuckled, did he really just think of Steve as perfect? It wasn’t too long ago when he basically hated him. Even though that was probably for that same reason exactly.
"I'm sorry, Steve. I shouldn't have let you leave when you moved out, but I shouldn't have let you leave when you told me about your feelings in the first place. I just.. I couldn't believe that you'd really like me. I'm such a mess and I didn't want to drag you in. I thought it was for the best.. Okay, well that's what I told myself. Actually I was scared. I knew I would find a way to screw this up and I wanted to spare you. And me."
Only a second later he leaned down to briefly kiss Steve before sinking to his knees. Steve’s eyes widened and he had barely enough time to let out a shaky breath before Tony’s mouth was on his dick. Now it was Steve’s turn to stare. The sight of Tony’s lips beautifully stretched around him, pink and wet, was almost too much, even though he wanted so much more of it at the same time. Only a moment later his staring was interrupted. His eyes flattered shut when Tony scraped his teeth along his length and
Surprised by the sudden movement and noise, Steve jumped a little. “Gosh, Tony. Give a guy a warning.”
“Started out with Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but now it’s Conan, I think? I’m not really watching, you can change the channel if you like,” Steve answered, handing the remote to Tony without looking up from the notes in his lap.
That was also very Steve. Instead of asking why the hell Tony wanted to meet in front of a bar in the afternoon, his only problem with it was that it was raining. And oh well, now that he reminds Tony. But he couldn’t bring himself to care. Actually, wasn’t kissing in the rain considered romantic? Was that what he was going to do? Should he just march up to him and kiss him? Okay, so his plan wasn’t completely elaborate. He needed to consider what he wanted to do or say.
About fifteen minutes later Tony stumbled into the kitchen just in time to watch Steve flipping a pancake over by throwing it in the air. Tony rolled his eyes but pressed himself against Steve’s back, wrapping his arms around his waist. He kissed his neck, before he asked, “did you seriously just flip a pancake by throwing it in the air without messing it up?”
It has been almost two weeks after the fall out, as he liked to call it. They probably had it coming the way Steve and Tony never seemed to agree on anything. But after the initial dissesions, it didn’t take too long until Cap had taken over everything. Tony never wanted to be a leader, but the way Cap questioned his every move had driven him crazy. Until their argument had escalated and suddenly there was no turning back. While Steve and the other Avengers stayed at the Compound, Tony went back to the tower. Even though everyone had tried to persuade him to stay, he needed to get away from them. From Steve.
“Yeah, maybe I finally found someone to accompany me on museum visits, since all of you are philistines.”
Huh, so maybe Tony didn’t kill the mood. Maybe he should push his luck and ask him to marry him right away. He chuckled. Okay, so maybe right now this was enough. But Tony realised what Steve’s words had meant. He was in for the long run and Tony couldn’t be happier about it. Sure, he would find at least a hundred ways to drive Steve to insanity and fuck this up, but Steve was pretty forgiving and right now all he wanted was to enjoy the moment.
Tony had to close his eyes. He could try and tell himself that Steve was lying, but Steve didn’t lie and his voice clearly gave away that he was telling the truth. That was the confirmation Tony had wanted but still was scared of. Brushing his free hand through his hair he exhaled audible.
“Look Steve, I’m so sorry. I shouldn't have let you go. I was such an idiot, because I didn’t.. I was such a wussy, because I was afraid and then I let you go and.. I’m so sorry. I-”
Tony groaned. Maybe he should just cancel the whole thing, tell everyone he was sick or something. Pepper would probably fly in from Japan or Mexico or wherever she was and drag him there by his ear. Not an option.
sleep. I should be in the workshop and, well, work. You think Barton hides some Scotch around here?” He definitely needed sleep the way he was talking a mile a minute.
“Don’t mention it,” Tony said nonchalantly while he moved back to his workbench. “Hey, wanna grab dinner later?”
From what had felt like normality a few days ago wasn’t much left. Whenever Steve moved around the tower he was alert. Expecting Tony around every corner, behind every door, constantly trying to come up with what to say in case he would run into him.
Steve looked at him pointedly. “Tony! I know her name because she turned out to be a SHIELD agent who was observing me. That’s why she was my neighbour.”
Tony had told himself to stay calm and he had been almost certain that he could manage, but seeing Steve triggered something and all the hurt of the past weeks and all his anger came rushing back.
“Yeah, I guess. But what does that have to do with anything?” Steve knitted the eyebrows, he had no clue where Bucky was going with this.
“Let me guess, Frozen didn’t beat Beauty and the Beast, right?” Steve startled a little when Tony’s voice interrupted his meditation. Looking around, he noticed that everyone else had already left, before his gaze landed on Tony. He was smirking a little and Steve couldn’t help but mimic the smile.
Later, when they laid next to each other, still panting, enjoying the afterwaves of their orgasmns, slowly coming back to, a heaviness settled in Steve’s chest. Nervousness clutched his stomach, anxiety announcing itself when his thoughts from earlier returned. He glanced at Tony who was on his side, body slack, face buried in a pillow while he still breathed a little heavier than what was normal. A small, content smile played at his lips, his dark curls all over the place and he looked absolutely beautiful. Tony would probably laugh at him for thinking something so cheesy, but he couldn’t care less, because it was true. Right there, right then Tony was nothing short of perfect to him. And if that thought alone wasn’t enough to put his stomach in knots, it was the almost irresistible urge to reach out and touch him. He wanted to roll over, hug Tony to his chest and bury his face in the crook of his neck. But he was pretty sure Tony wouldn’t be up for that, so before Steve could do something stupid, he all but jumped out of the bed, stumbling for a second before grabbing his clothes and hastily throwing them on.
"Steve. I.. I mean it, I like you, but.. I.. We.." he trailed off, sighing, lowering his gaze. And that was when Steve really wanted to run, he just knew what was to come. He had to stop himself from suggesting a reply, forcing himself to hear the words coming from Tony himself even though he already knew what he was going to say.
Steve chuckled but decided to ignore the question. Instead he put his hands on Tony’s thighs while he leaned down to kiss him again.
He wasn’t desperate for a partner and he definitely didn’t want to try any kind of online dating website or whatever Tony had suggested. He had been old-school and had asked out people he met at the coffee shop or the library. But he just hadn’t hit it off with anyone. To say nothing of finding out that at least half the people going on dates just wanted to have sex instead of searching for potential partners. So much for settling in in the 21st century.
“Oh come on. You’re seriously the stupidest genius ever. Your brain really can’t come up with a single reason why Steve doesn't wanna be friends with benefits anymore?”
When Tony turned around, he was proven right. Steve leaned in the doorframe, a half eaten sandwich in his hand, but otherwise still looking the same with those sweatpants that were just tight enough to show off his perfect ass and Tony didn’t want to get started on that t-shirt again. He had probably just returned from the gym. As if he would need to build more muscle, some day his shirts would just rip apart.
A few moments none of them said anything until Steve, who was still standing in the middle of the room, finally looked at Tony again and said, “I’m glad that you invited me over.”
He didn’t know if Steve was really that dense or if he just wanted to him to say it, but it was the excact moment Tony told himself ‘fuck this’ and ‘just go for it’.
“So, just to get this straight. You found out that I have feelings for you, which made you realize that you also had feelings for me. And then you what? Block Central Park and prepare a picnic date for us as a first date? At the Pond where you first..-”
So if, and it still was a big if to Tony, this was all real he needed to talk to Steve. And he really hoped that they didn’t fuck anything up with their fling. Of course Steve had wanted to stop, Tony had been such an idiot.
It wasn’t even midnight when Tony got home from the bar, which was pretty early considering it was a Friday night. Then again he hadn’t even felt like going at all and only gave in because Natasha would have kept bugging him until he would have finally agreed to join them anyway. There was no escape when she was involved. Or, well, apparently there was, since his roommate had been able to convince her to let him stay home. Maybe Tony’s excuses just weren’t good enough.
He was everything one could look for in the person to fall in love with, but still Steve couldn’t pinpoint on what was holding him back.
Steve laughed but got up and put on his sweatpants. When he picked up his t-shirt from the floor, Tony cleared his throat and shook his head when Steve looked at him. “Uh uh, you don’t need that.”
. I.. enjoyed it, but I think we should stop.” He felt his cheeks heating, but forced himself to look at Tony, who was watching him pensively, brows furrowed. When he didn’t say anything, Steve resumed talking or rather babbling, “it’s just.. it’s not about you or anything. I.. I enjoyed it, it’s just..”
At the end of the third day Steve decided that he had moped enough, he had a team to lead after all. Sure, they’d come around without him, but he needed the excuse. So on day four he attended breakfast and acted like nothing had happened. Natasha and Sam watched him closely, but didn’t say anything. They probably knew that it wouldn’t lead anywhere. And after the initial surprise and maybe relief at seeing him, everything was as normal as can be, except maybe for Steve being a little quieter than usual.
He opened his eyes and started walking again, stepping further into the forest, leaving the compound behind. Even though the trees were tall and densely, a few sunrays shone through, warming Steve’s skin. After a few minutes he reached one of his favorite spots where a couple of big oak trees almost formed a circle around a small clearing. He stopped in front of one of the thick trees and without second thought put his arms around the trunk, closing his eyes.
He put on a smile that felt, and hopefully looked, convincing enough. Not Tony and definitely not Natasha but the others should have bought it.
He had wanted to be a little more subtle, he really had But somehow his mouth decided against it. Not that it was unusual for him to speak his mind, but he actually hadn’t wanted to basically scream ‘I love you’ at Steve. But what was done was done and now he had to bear Steve’s reaction. Which was pretty much non-existent right now. He just looked at him, eyes a little wider than usual, but other than that there wasn’t even an indicator that he had heard Tony.
A few hours later, Tony decided that he needed at least 5 cups of coffee. So he left his workshop for the first time since he started working after breakfast. He had no clue what time it was, but when he arrived in the kitchen and almost everybody was there, he assumed that they just had dinner. Nobody told him, but they knew better than to talk to him when he was nowhere to be seen the whole day. He wasn’t hungry anyway, these days coffee and chocolate were his fuels of choice.
And he had really believed it was true, had really thought this would be just over after he would've told Tony. Sure, he would've liked for Tony to tell him he liked him too, but he really thought he could live with whatever answer he'd get. He had been wrong, oh so wrong.  But he never even once considered that he would feel like this. Like losing the ground under his feet, like his lungs couldn't breathe properly.
He didn’t answer, instead he faceplanted himself onto the couch as if that somehow would solve his problems. When, after all of five seconds, it didn’t, he turned around on his back, staring at the ceiling. “I’m such an idiot,” he groaned. He wasn’t exactly someone that could control himself most of the time, but with Steve he had managed. Since his feelings surfaced he had tried to hide them and not make any mistakes and was rather successful. Until yesterday. Why, for the love of god, did he have to fuck it all up? When he would say that Steve was the best thing that ever had happened to him, he definitely wouldn’t be lying. It had also been true even before he discovered that he was in love with him. And now he may have butchered their whole friendship. Why couldn’t he have just thought for one second. Whenever he stumbled over the possibility of destroying what they had, it had always been enough to pull Tony out of whatever trance Steve’s eyes or his physiques or his words or his whatever put him into. Enough to not make stupid mistakes. Even though part of him thought he wasn’t even to blame. Being this close to Steve, looking directly into these unbelievable deep blue eyes, almost feeling his breath on your lips, who could have resisted that? Not a man as weak as Tony.
Throwing back his head, his voice was hoarse when he murmured, “Tony. I’m..” Another moan interrupted his statement, because the vibration of Tony humming around his dick felt way too good. But apparently Tony understood nevertheless if the way he was sucking him even harder was any indication.
Tony leaned his head on Steve’s chest, causing Steve to instantly put his arms around him, hugging him tight. For a few moments both of them just enjoyed the water washing over them. When Tony raised his head again, Steve’s eyes were still closed, but a small smile played at his lips.
"You too, Cap," Tony answered so quietly he wasn’t even sure Steve had heard him before he hung up and let the phone fall on the table to bury his head in his hands.
“Nat said to tell you you’re a party pooper,” Tony said, making his way to the fridge to grab a bottle of water.
“Well, alright. I’ll be happy to not owe you any longer.” Steve offered him a little smile before he took a bite from his sandwich.
Without waiting for an invitation Steve made his way to the couch, putting his head in his hands after he sat down. He breathed out in relief, he didn’t know what he’d do if he would lose Bucky. Therapy was working well for him, but sometimes he just couldn’t be alone with his thoughts, especially after the severer sessions. In the beginning Bucky had tended to leave out details to deal with them himself, resulting in him having breakdowns regularly. As far as Steve could tell that wasn’t the case anymore. But he just couldn’t stop worrying about him. It wasn’t always rational and he believed in Bucky, but the thought of losing him again was too much. It sent him right over the edge every time, so he tried not to go there too often.
Tony threw up his hands. “Okay, that’s true. But I greatly reduced it.” His tone was mocking, but it was the truth and maybe he took a little pride in it.
“Yup, he does. Seriously? You’re such idiots, you know that?” she laughed and shook her head at him, the fond smile growing even wider.
much power, but he couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed when it did nothing for his situation. Putting his cup into the sink, he leaned against the counter and covered his eyes with his free hand before pinching the bridge of his nose.
Sooo, to be honest I'm really not sure about this chapter, it kind of didn't turn out like I wanted it to be? It's exactly like I wanted it to be, but I still don't really like it? idk. Feel free to let me know what you think <3
Opening his eyes again, his gaze landed on Tony who was still fast asleep. Sprawled all over his half of the mattress, his face hidden in the pillow, one arm and one leg hanging from the edge as he was snoring softly. Silently laughing at the image, Steve shook his head before he carefully climbed out of bed so he wouldn't wake the other. Maybe he could get in another hour or two before Steve would need to shower after his morning run.
“You wish what?” Tony interrupted him harshly. “You know what I wish? That you’d rather spend time with your boyfriend than someone else.”
“None taken, I wouldn’t want you anyway.” Bucky smirked at him. “But I think you should talk about this. Just tell him what you told me.”
Tony didn’t even seem to deliberate when he instantly answered, "nope, that’s fine with me. And I especially don't care for the record, I feel like we made progress."
He gave the bow tie another jerk while he made his way to the bedroom and Steve didn’t seem like he actually needed reconsidering because he followed him without hesitation.
Pepper would probably call in approximately ten minutes, yelling at him, but not even that thought could temper his delight of finally getting out of this meeting.
“Look, what I was trying to say was that it was just a big misunderstanding. I talked to Tasha and kinda accidently found out. I thought you were uncomfortable, because I almost kissed you, which I really, really wanted by the way. And I felt so stupid because I didn’t want to destroy our friendship but then I did. That’s what I thought at least. Then Tasha tells me that you thought
uncomfortable. At least that’s what I thought right up until now. I thought that was why he left. And now you’re telling me that he thinks
“Tony, please,” Steve interrupted him. He leaned back just enough to look at Tony. “I’m just so anxious all the time. I’m constantly worried about him, about you. Every time Bucky calls I’m afraid something could happen to him. And then I’m instantly worried about our relationship. But nevertheless I shouldn’t have ran off. Again. I’m sorry. He’s way better already and I promise he’s just a friend that needed my help. Nothing else.”
Steve’s favorite café was only a few blocks from the tower, but since he sounded really awful, Tony decided to press every button. As soon as he stepped outside, he enabled the Iron Man suit and flew off to save his friend. He also figured it would be more impressive to break out as Iron Man, so that Tiffany wouldn’t have another option as to let Steve go.
Possibility A: the potential partner would want to be with him only because he was Captain America, no further explanation needed.
“It’s fine. I’ll just.. go for a run.” He faked a smile that probably looked more like a grimace than anything else, but kept it up. “It’s okay.” And with that he went for the elevator and left Tony standing there, muttering a soft ‘I’m sorry’ that Steve probably only caught because of his enhanced hearing.
"And I think at least one of the spies in this house will kill you when you sneak around the house in the middle of the night."
“So, did you really study the whole time? Or was that just a lame excuse?” He asked even though he knew pretty well that Steve usually didn’t lie.
Steve couldn't stop himself from grinning. He wouldn’t admit it, but he kind of liked the thought that Tony enjoyed having his hand on his dick. Supposedly this was some adrenaline induced one-time thing, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t enjoy themselves. Steve picked up the pace, guessing that Tony would want to get off rather sooner than later when he felt a hand on his thigh.
Steve sighed. “Tony, I don’t-” “This might be inappropriate,” Tony interrupted. “But that was fucking hot.”
and that it couldn’t wait much longer, but he didn’t exactly have a plan yet. First he needed dryer clothes and, more importantly, to calm down. Not that it was an easy task considering he just found out that Steve had feelings for him. Like. How the hell did that happen? And why didn’t he know? Why not for once anything in his life could be easy was beyond him. But that wasn’t important right now. Only talking to Steve and making this right was important, but how? They weren’t even really talking after all.
“Just wrap your arms around. Lean your head against it, close your eyes and.. breath,” Steve instructed as he did just that.
“I know, I know. But that’s still not the point. I wanted to protect you, because I.. I couldn’t bear the thought of losing you.” Steve briefly closed his eyes, before he continued, “I was worried that something might happen to you, I wanted you to be safe and I thought.. when you sit out every other mission, you can’t get hurt.”
“I just.. I thought..,” Tony stuttered, but Steve must have noticed his tentativeness, because he gently cut him off, “No, no. Sorry, that was definitely not how I meant it.” Reaching out his hand, he took Tony’s and gave it a small squeeze. “It’s perfect, Tony. It’s really thoughtful, actually. I’d take this over any fancy dinner every day.”
This time Steve didn’t seem to need any more intel, because he didn’t hesitate answering, “definitely.”
Tony took another calming breath, his eyes fixed on Steve. “The way you care about people and just the way you are is why I fell for you in the first place. Why I’m.. in love with you.”
About two weeks after moving out Steve felt ready to go back, but persuaded himself to wait another week. Even though he missed the team and his home, he wanted to be sure that he could handle seeing Tony on a daily basis again.
With that Tony’s upcoming anger was gone. He stopped everything he was doing, stood absolutely still, didn’t make a sound and didn’t even breath for a few seconds. It wasn’t like he hadn’t thought about this before, but the words hit him with so much force that he wasn’t able to do anything. She was right. Whenever Tony so much as thought about losing Steve he got anxious. Because he loved him. Why was he realizing this only now?
“Oh come on, even you must have noticed how I sometimes stare at you. I used this whole rumors thing as an excuse to shamelessly watch and touch you. And I liked it, Steve. That’s what’s up.”
“Uh, what?” Was all Steve managed before Tony was right in front of him, hands on his chest pushing him back into the wall. A soft
that was defintly the moment his brain lost the ability to form coherent sentences. Keeping a steady rhythm, Tony licked up his cock before sucking it back down again. Steve clenched his fist, trying to stop himself from thrusting up, from moving at all, but couldn’t help but to push one of his hands into Tony’s hair, gripping it tight without pushing or pulling. Low moans proceeded to escape his throat when Tony moved faster.
Steve grimaced. “I know, Tony. I know and I’m sorry. I was wrong. I just couldn’t.. I was so scared that you would get hurt. This was never about trust or the decisions you made.”
Of course Steve would have picked up on the limitation. And of course he would keep calling him Anthony.
Even though it took Tony embarrassingly long to discover his feelings for Steve, being here with him, kissing him without a care in the world just felt right. Like he was exactly where he should be and he would try his best to keep it that way, make it work. Tony briefly let go of Steve's lips and smiled against his mouth when a thought struck him. With astonishment he realized this was the first time that Steve had taken the initiative. That had to be a good sign, Tony supposed as he leaned back in to kiss Steve again and again.
“Hey, it’s okay. You don’t have to explain,” Tony interrupted him, patting him on the shoulder while giving him a small smile.
Probably prepared to be yelled at, Steve didn’t flinch, but he opened his mouth as if to say something, but closed it again. Maybe because he knew, Tony wasn’t done. They still knew each other pretty well.
Tony’s expression was back to confused and Steve was kind of sorry for stalling, but just because he wanted to be honest didn’t mean he needed to blurt things out.
Anyway, back to the task at hand. “JARVIS, open the dating profiles I highlighted as favorites, please?” “There you go, Sir.”
“Did we really just take the car for like 5 blocks? We could’ve walked, Tony,” he sounded a little accusing.
“Stop it, Tony!” Steve told him through gritted teeth. He seemed like he tried really hard to sound serious, but the way he had to suppress his laughter made Tony grin like an idiot.
Shortly after Steve had left, Tony’s phone indicated an incoming call. He hesitated, his first assumption was that Steve was calling him. He didn’t know how long he had been gone, it could have been a few seconds or several minutes, Tony didn’t know. He felt empty and had regretted their fight as soon as Steve was out of the door. His anger was still present, he was hurt and mad that he had been stood up for Bucky
It took about four painfully long minutes in which Tony had to keep himself from pacing the room or biting his nail, until Steve answered.
Thankfully the room was dark so Tony didn’t see him blush, but he couldn't suppress a surprised cough escaping his throat. In spite of that Steve tried to sound as casual as possible when he said, “did anyone ever tell you about that concept that is ‘oversharing’? Do you have absolutely no filter between your brain and mouth?”
When he felt Bucky sitting down next to him as well as a hand on his shoulder, Steve looked up just to find a worried expression on Bucky’s face.
“I don’t know, just a few moments ago I thought it was wednesday, so.. I’m fine, Cap. Ask JARVIS. Or no, maybe don’t ask JARVIS. You two would just.. join forces against me.”
A little sulky, Tony ditched the stranger and made his way to the table. Steve followed suit and took the chair next to him, his grin a bit too big for Tony’s liking. “So Anthony. Bruce only is a genius
Unable to speak, Steve softly shook his head. Rather than answering, Tony slowly moved forward until Steve’s eyes were wide with realization. And then he felt Tony’s breath on his lips before his mouth grazed his. Their lips barely met in only a touch of a kiss and Steve's eyes fluttered shut. When they parted, he opened them again to find Tony watching him sheepishly. “You could just hug me, you know?”
, was just plain stupid and therefor wrong, of course. The next person took some time to think, before cautiously deciding to go with
There was rustling and Steve was sure that Tony turned his head in his direction. Then there was a brief pause until Tony spoke. “You..? Did you just..?”
“Sooo, uhm. How is Steve?” He asked tentatively. He had wanted to be far more casual about it, actually, but couldn’t quite help himself.
“I.. I don’t know yet. Thank you for being honest, but I don’t know..,” Tony trailed off, he needed time to think about what Steve just said, about what that meant.
Steve nodded and after a few seconds he took hold of the waistband, pushing down the underwear until he hesitantly took Tony’s cock in a loose grip as he started to stroke him. He glanced up at Tony who moaned at the touch but managed to nod slightly, trying to reassure Steve. It seemed to work because his grip firmed up and he soon found a rhythm that was rather fast. Tony knew he wouldn’t last long, he had waited too long for this. Even though he wanted to watch Steve jerk him off, he closed his eyes, hopefully making it a bit easier for him. It took only a few more strokes until Tony felt his body stiffen before it went slack when he came with one last moan.
was he handsome. Not that this was news, but him all dressed up was a whole different thing. His suit was royal blue with a black collar. Of course he would wear blue, he was Captain America out and out. Dress shoes, a white dress shirt and a black bow tie as well as perfectly styled hair completed his outfit. Tony would need to thank Natasha, she had doubtlessly assisted him. Just when Tony thought nothing could be worse, in a still kinda good way, than Steve in tight spandex, he turned up like this. Beautiful as ever.
“He was a good choice, perfect actually.” Steve paused and this time he could have sworn that Tony looked disappointed or even sad, but he didn’t want to get his hopes up. He had come here to tell him the truth, regardless of what his response would be. That’s just how they did things and Steve was nothing if not honest. And scared right now, but that was another matter altogether.
the elevator were vanishingly low. It had been his own decision but yet he wanted to be anywhere but here or rather where he was going. It felt like the last weeks all over again.
With that thought he fastened a black bow tie, threw on his matching black jacket and cast a last glance at the mirror. He looked decent, good actually. If Steved looked even half as good as him, the evening would be pretty hard to survive. He laughed a little at his choice of words. He really needed to get going, he shouldn’t be alone with his thoughts any longer.
Tony smirked at him, but didn’t waste any time until he took his dick into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the tip before he started bobbing his head up and down. Steve moaned out loud, clenching his hands into the sheets and Tony’s hair. Holding it to the bed, Tony gripped Steve’s hip while he worked him with a steady rhythm, occasionally scraping his teeth along the length of his cock. His action were greeted with a muffled “Fuck”. Tony glanced up, smirking, but Steve’s eyes were closed. He would enjoy telling him to watch his language right now just to fuck with him. But he didn’t, sometimes even Tony knew when he’d better not say anything. Hopefully he would get a lot more chances to tease him like that. He wouldn’t mind getting used to Steve in his bed, moaning, swearing.
Tony took his time looking him up and down and Steve felt his cheeks flush under the intense gaze. There was no way to read anything on Tony’s face, so this look could mean anything, really. After what felt like minutes of Tony just watching him, he shifted a little, uncertain, insecure.
Since he hadn’t made any progress on his work for hours he reached for the phone without a second thought. If he wanted to know what Steve had meant in his words, there was only one way to find out.
That made Steve turn around completely, looking over the couch, his gaze fixed on Tony, watching him with a fond expression. His voice was soft when he said, “you did and I’m really proud of you, Tony.”
to each other for the first time. No shouting, no blaming, just two colleagues strolling through the park. And, Tony somehow managed to remember, where he had first called Steve by his name. Until then it had only ever been ‘Captain America’, ‘Cap’ or ‘Capsicle’ at most and calling him Steve had felt like a flag of truce. Right now, waiting for Natasha to report back to him, he questioned this whole thing. Maybe after everything Steve didn’t even want him anymore or-
It was late in the evening when Tony’s phone announced another text and pulled him out of his bubble. He had worked for hours on end without eating or pausing for more than about two minutes. Which wasn't exactly healthy, but not that unusual for him. At least he didn’t have time to think about anything. Grabbing his phone, he rubbed his eyes with his other hand, his eyes were starting to hurt, a not unexpected headache was on its way.
It wasn’t exactly ‘first thing’ that he talked to him, actually Steve tried not to run into him until afternoon, but he was on his way to his workshop now and that had to count for something, right?
"You're a really good friend and we're good at working together.. But I think that's it. That should be it. It wouldn't be good for.. The team and.. I.."
“I really don’t need to hear..,” Tony interrupted him again before Steve shot him down with one pointed look.
It wasn’t even an hour ago when the QuinJet had landed on a farm that turned out to be Clint’s home, revealing not only that but also his wife and children nobody had known about. It had been a surprise to everyone but Natasha but they had been way too exhausted to actually care too much about it. Thankfully the number of casualties had been virtually zero, but the destruction to the city was a whole different thing. And even though most of the New Yorkers celebrated the Avengers as heros, enough people were out of sorts with them, causing Hill to order them to stay off the radar for a few days. That had been when Clint suggested he’d know a safe house, landed the QuinJet on his farm and introduced them to his family. With it being late in the night already Tony and Steve had taken turns showering and went straight to bed. They had tried to, at least. It took some time until they had managed to arrange themselves so they didn’t touch too much or were about to fall off the bed. It wasn’t as awkward as Steve thought it would be, probably because they were too tired to even care. Steve shifted the tiniest bit to get a tad more comfortable when Tony suddenly yanked up his arms, probably covering his face while groaning. “This is stupid. Why am I even in bed? As if I could sleep.”
“I’m telling you..” “Oh my god, are you serious right now?” Tony interrupted her again, knowing that slowly but surely he brought her to the end of her tether, but he just couldn't care.
Anyway neither Pepper nor being lonely and miserable could actually make him forget what happened. Sure, he knew that him and Cap agreeing was a rarity, but he still wouldn’t have imagined it to go this bad. Tony let out a bleak laugh when he realized that they did agree on something after all. Steve had hurt Tony. He wouldn’t admit it, but it was true. The way Steve didn’t seem to trust him with any decision had been a thorn in his side since they had met, but Tony felt like it had gotten worse over time. Maybe Tony could have even overlooked it, if not for the fact that something between them had changed. He didn’t know when or why but suddenly he had felt that there was
“Don’t you appreciate me treating you like the princess you are?” Tony chuckled, but Steve shot him down with a warning look. So he wasn’t that amused, but at least he didn’t seem to be too mad.
Staring at her wide-eyed, Tony opened his mouth to say something. Then closed it, before opening it again. So much for not talking about his feelings. He thought about every situation that included the three of them, when could he possibly have been giving it away?
Tony peeked down at their entwined fingers before looking up at Steve again, a sheepish expression on his face.
A few minutes later they were on the road in his blue Audi, because who wouldn’t have chosen the matching car for Steve’s suit? This was totally normal, right?
He really had been the worst boyfriend ever. He had been too selfish to see that Steve was hurting, he should’ve been there for him. Instead he had made it even worse. He had been angry at him for worrying about his best friend, for god’s sake.
The next one had to go because he was too young and seemed rather childish. Steve had more life experience than anyone, but that made it even more important to find someone mature. Which made Tony swipe away the third one, because he just didn’t seem to be smart enough. Steve needed someone that could keep up with him intellectually. He wasn’t only intelligent but well-educated.
“You have no idea. That’s why you’re here, consider yourself emotional support.” Tony winked at him and the laugh he got in response was the exact reason he hated and yet loved to have Steve around.
“So, what I’m trying to say.. The whole time I was comparing him to someone else. Some brunette who’s
By the time he finished his ten miles, he found Natasha, Bruce and Tony seated at the kitchen table. The former two were engaged in some kind of discussion while Tony looked barely awake, clinging to his coffee.
“Yes, please. I think one more week and Natasha would’ve locked us up until we would get our act together.” Steve had chuckled and was about to lean forward, when Clint stepped through the door, oblivious to what was happening. “Hey Tony, I wanted.. oh, hey Steve. I wanted to fetch the arrows you made for me.”
Now it was Steve’s turn to sound not amused. He probably tried to go for a warning tone and look, but his confusion was still written all over his face, so Tony decided to leave it at that.
A little surprised, Steve made an affirmative noise. Who would’ve thought? Of course Tony had to have a lot on his mind, he was a genius after all. But Steve had wondered if all those hours he worked were at least partly to distract him from his thoughts. But then again you couldn’t run forever, not from yourself or your own thoughts.
“Steve, I.. like you, but to be honest it might take some time to.. forgive and forget.” He shrugged apologetic and Steve’s eyes instantly shot up to meet Tony’s. “Of course, that’s.. yeah.”
“Don’t.. don’t get this wrong. It’s just.. I suppose it’s an Army thing. When there’s just you and your comrades for months, it’s nice to..,” he trailed off.
Steve paused for a moment, staring into space. And finally he understood. Tony. He hadn’t described his type, he described Tony. And that's exactly why he didn’t think of Lincoln as perfect. Because he thought of Tony as perfect.
He let himself fall onto the small couch, still looking at the two profiles. He shook his head, taking a deep breath. He couldn't even tell what it was that made him feel like none of them would be 'the one' and he knew he sooner or later would have to decide on one of them, but somehow he didn't want either to be allowed to go on a date with Steve. They seemed decent enough, but something still bothered Tony. He had felt it a few days ago already. When he had saved Steve from Tiffany he couldn't help but tell her to stay away from Steve. Not because she had done him actual harm, but Tony hadn't liked how she made Steve feel. There was her once in a lifetime chance to be with
Steve, always the knight in shining armour even though, technically, they weren’t even speaking right now.
When the elevator reached his floor he made a bolt for his apartment and just about managed to control himself enough to not slam the door. He wasn’t used to feeling so many things all at once. His anger wasn’t directed at Tony but rather at himself for thinking that he’d walk away from his feelings after possibly being rejected. Or maybe for not even thinking that far and just doing what he thought was best. Why did he always have to do the right thing? His Captain-America-Attitude be damned.
Tony leaned down and kissed him again, slow and soft. Just when he was about to pull back, Steve rolled onto his back, pulling Tony with him until he was half on top of him. He cupped Tony’s face, stroking his cheeks with his thumbs. Their kisses were rather sleepy and calm, but perfect in every way. They’d had the slightly clumsy first kiss, even though they had somehow been pretty good at it from the start. Then they'd had a few more exploring kisses before the passionate and rather urgents ones. But right now Tony was more than content with the fact that Steve was still here,
“Nope, I know you’re a lost cause,” Steve joked, but the smile he put on never reached his eyes.  While he followed Tony to the couch he tried to figure out what to say, where to start. “Actually, I wanted to talk to you about.. something.”
“Yeah, you know, when you’re surrounded by the same men for way too long. It was probably a stupid thing to say, sorry.”
"Anyway, we said we'd always tell each other the truth and that's why I'm here..," Steve trailed off, not quite ready to say more yet.
He caressed Steve’s thighs, giving him some time, until he crawled up, laying down next to him. He looked for any sign that he was about to freak out. This had been his first time with another man after all. Even though Tony wanted to kiss him  he decided to wait, give him a few more moments to calm down. Besides he wasn’t sure how fond he would be of being kissed by someone who just sucked him off. But as it turned out, Tony’s concerns were without reason because Steve took his face in his hands and pressed their lips together. He moved until he was on top of Tony, braced on one hand, tracing Tony’s chest with the other.
Steve chuckled softly. “I’ll keep that in mind," he whispered as he cupped Tony's cheek, gently pulling him in for another kiss.
Tony had to suppress a laughter, the mental image of Captain America being intimidated enough to hide in a bathroom stall was too much.
and it got me thinking. He wasn’t sassy and definitely not sarcastic enough and I’m actually not really into blondes..”
This time he did pause, he probably wasn’t sure what to say exactly. For a brief moment Tony noticed how Natasha tried to hide her grin behind her hand and Banner’s slight smirk. But he was distracted by the big smile on Steve’s face. If Tony didn’t know better, he’d say it was a genuine smile meant only for him. That was wishful thinking of course, but he still found himself returning the smile, maybe even brighter than Steve’s.
“Sure, scouts honor and everything,” Tony joked and even Steve laughed. Maybe even the first real laugh since their talk.
Once they were clean and somewhat dry, Tony made his way to the door, but Steve grasped his wrist and pulled him back against his chest. When he looked up, Steve briefly kissed him before he grabbed Tony’s butt and lifted him up in one swift motion. Instantly putting his arms and legs around Steve’s body, Tony snickered. “Thanks for the heads up.” He tried to sound serious, but the laugh in his voice was still very distinct.
“Yeah?” Steve’s voice was soft when he pulled off his cowl, stepping into Tony’s space. He let out a quiet sigh before he leaned in and gently pressed his lips to Tony’s. The kiss was slow and soft, their lips barely moving. When Steve broke the kiss, he didn’t move away, leaning his forehead against Tony’s. “Hey,” he whispered. A fond smile appeared on Tony’s face. “Hey,” he repeated just as quiet before brushing another kiss to Steve’s lips. “What do you say? Shower and then make good use of the couch?”
Tony watched him for a moment before he turned around and started walking. After only a few steps he stopped and looked back over his shoulder. Smiling, he nodded his head in the general direction he’d walked. It took Steve a few seconds until he realized that Tony apparently wanted him to follow him.
When they parted Tony started biting at his neck, moving to his collarbone until he was licking and biting and kissing a trail along Steve’s upper body and everything that followed, happened in a daze for Steve. Gentle kisses mixed with playful nips. Whispered names turned into moaned incentments. Swear words mingled with endearments. Touches, the feeling of skin on skin and soon everything Steve could sense and see, everything he could think of, was Tony.
Tony rolled his eyes, but let Steve continue. “So, I’m on the date with Lincoln who was really tall and nice, handsome and..”
As soon as Steve closed the door to his apartment, he let himself slump against it, burying his face in his hands, he groaned. This was not how this was supposed to go. Again, it had just felt too real having Tony right there besides him.
About a week ago Tony had started to cautiously touch the subject. At first he had just dropped a hint here and there. Had asked if Steve was interested in dating again and if he even had dated after being in the ice. Tony had become one of his best friends, but Steve still didn’t feel really comfortable talking about this stuff. It had been hard enough to get used to suddenly living in the 21st century after he had woken up. After he had settled a bit, Avengers business had been crazy. And when he had finally felt ready to go on a date again, he had been rather disappointed in those few acquaintances he had made.
On Friday, shortly before 4 pm JARVIS’ voice pulled Tony out of his trance. “Sir, Captain Rogers will soon arrive at the penthouse.”
When Steve arrived at Bucky’s flat and didn’t get any response after knocking, he was on the brink of kicking in the door. The worst scenarios played out in his head, making him think that he was too late. But then the door opened, revealing Bucky. “Hey Ste..” He was interrupted by Steve pulling him in, giving him a bear hug.
. Closing his eyes again, he took a deep breath. What exactly had he been thinking, offering Tony.. He didn’t even want to finish that thought. All he could hope for was that it wouldn’t make things awkward. The adrenaline must have made him do it, that was the only reasonable explanation.
They wandered around in silence and even though it wasn’t uncomfortable, it still felt odd. Usually Tony was talkative and energized and blunt, but he never seemed as calm and relaxed as right now. He only ever became silent when he didn’t agree with what was happening and he was about to shout at someone or when he wasn’t able to solve whatever problem he had at hand. Either way they were not good kinds of silent, more like the lull before the storm.
It had been months of Steve and Tony tiptoeing around each other. Which had started out with Tony stepping up their banter game by making even more innuendos than usual. Then there had been looks and touches, both of them always carefully testing the waters. Even though it had been apparent to everyone, Natasha had called them out on it more than once, they still kept dancing around each other since none of them was certain enough to really say something. Until a few hours ago when Steve had kept him company in the workshop and Tony just couldn’t take it anymore. In the midst of their conversation that he had long stopped following, he had kissed Steve. And even though it hadn’t been too surprising, Tony was still glad when Steve kissed him back. The kiss had been rather clumsy with their teeth clashing together, but both of them seemed content, smiling happily at each other, when they broke apart shortly after.
Steve and get off rough and fast because he had wanted this for too long already, he enjoyed it. It was Steve showering him in endearment after all. He’d never imagined it like this, but he’d also never imagined that Steve could have feelings for him and with that knowledge his gentle treatment was way better than anything else. Also by now Tony was pretty sure this wasn’t the last time they’d do this, so they had all the time in the world to try out everything they’d come up with.
Opening his eyes, he glanced at the alarm clock on his night stand, 22:19. Maybe an evening run would help him clear his mind.
The media probably wouldn’t think anything of it since they were writing about their ‘bromance’ for months and the photographer wasn’t as baffled as Tony would have thought. The only one that seemed surprised was Steve. His jaws were clenched going by the way they stood out, his mouth a tight line. His eyes were illegible. but he certainly didn’t look amused.
With one last kiss Steve turned around and walked over to the bedroom. Tony jumped down the counter and cursed whatever aliens needed to attack earth today of all days.
“God, no. We try to lay low, talk to as few people as possible and get out of there as soon as possible.”
But apparently Steve had other plans, because this time he was the one that did kill the mood. “Ready for breakfast?”
Steve didn’t stress too much on outer appearances and since Lincoln was very attractive that couldn’t be the reason. Even though, if Steve was completely honest, he prefered brunettes over blondes. Preferably in a rather messy fashion than a real hairstyle. Come to think of it he also kinda had a thing for sassy and sarcastic people. Maybe he had a type after all or he had just spent too much time around Tony..
The first days had been difficult since Steve wasn’t used to living alone. And when usually a group of loud and odd (in the best way possible) people followed you wherever you went, the quiet was something that rather required some getting used to. In spite of that it was a welcome change. Without daily responsibilities, without always watching what he said or did, Steve was finally able to relax a little. Spending his days running, reading or taking long walks without having to worry about meetings or missions too much felt like a long overdue vacation, but nothing more than that. Initially he had feared that getting away from it all could tempt him into not going back to being Captain America, but it seemed like a baseless fear. More than once he found himself thinking about the team and if they were on a mission. If they were it would probably be a smaller one, because he guessed they would’ve let him know if something big would be going on. And of course Steve thought about Tony. Evaluating things from a distance was something Steve was good at, especially if it was his call when to get closer. Of course he was nowhere near to over his feelings for Tony and he wasn’t sure if he would ever get over them, but right now it felt as if he could live with it. With living together despite knowing that Tony would never reciprocate his feelings. When he’d get back, his priority would be to restore their friendship, because he didn’t want to lose Tony. He could live with not having him the way he wished he’d have him, but losing him altogether was not an option. Maybe they just needed this time out to make things less awkward and everything would be like it used to.
“So far you did everything right,” he reassured him with a bright smile. “Seriously. Thank you for doing this, Tony. It’s very considerate, but to be honest, all I care about right now is that we’re
After a few painful long seconds, Tony’s eyes widened. Did he just realize what was going on? Steve’s breath hitched when Tony started to speak, “not to… presume anything, but that someone sounds an awful lot like me."
“Come on, I’m kidding and you know it,” Steve said conciliatorily, putting his arm around Tony’s shoulder, pulling him into a half hug while ruffling his hair. If Tony was honest, he wanted to stay like that forever, but unfortunately, Tony Stark had the urgent necessity to always be right and talk anything out. He turned around to look at Steve and tell him that
When Tony woke up the next morning, the first thing he noticed was a warm body pressed to his. Without opening his eyes he smiled to himself and crawled back a little further into the warmth. He was laying on his side with Steve practically wrapped around him, his chest to Tony’s back, his arms holding him tight. Tony would never admit it and he hadn’t even known until now, but he loved to cuddle. He had never stayed in bed with anyone long enough to experience this. It had simply been too intimate. But with Steve it felt right and he could absolutely get used to it. His smile grew wider before he turned around in Steve’s arms, facing him. Steve doubtlessly was awake, but his eyes were still closed and Tony took his time just looking at him. At the way his mouth was slightly curled upwards but otherwise completely relaxed and at his sleep tousled hair. His incredible soft hair. Tony didn’t hesitate before he slid his hand into it and pressed his lips to Steve’s briefly. “Morning, Sweet Pea.”
Steve laughed, this was ridiculous. His day had been kind of shitty with having to fight and how the battle went and just a few minutes ago all he wanted to do was to sleep, but somehow Steve didn’t even mind still being awake. Not that he would ever have guessed to have that kind of conversation with Tony. Or anyone at all. Though with Tony it was probably more likely than with anybody else. "Both actually."
Natasha sighed, but her gaze turned soft when she watched him closely. “He had it bad for you forever. That’s why he was so happy when you two started your thing. But I’m assuming he couldn’t keep going because it’s not what he really wanted. Or not
Steve turned around, just watching Tony for a few seconds without saying anything. The look on his face didn’t reveal what he was thinking or feeling and it made Tony’s stomach turn to not see the usual smile on Steve’s lips. So much for him not being mad.
Bucky just nodded, he knew what Steve didn’t say. They’d known each other for so long, they knew how to read each other. At least that’s what Steve thought, but right now Bucky didn’t seem nearly as devastated as Steve had pictured him.
While Tony stopped at the doorstep of the living room, Steve went to the bedroom to get a towel and a sweater. When he came back he took a moment to look at Tony. His eyes were fixed on the floor, but just moments ago they had shown a mix of emotions, Steve couldn’t read, but all in all he looked miserable. And Steve’s heart sank at the realization. He had concentrated on his own hurt, but never thought about how Tony would feel. He slowly stepped into his space and held out the fabric.
Tony should make sure that Pepper spent less time with Natasha, she was getting too observant. He thought about asking her, if she stalked him now, but he wasn’t in the mood for banter, which said a lot.
Kicking off his shoes, Tony tiptoed into the living room to find Steve still awake. His tiptoeing seemed to have been useless because Steve had still noticed him, head turned his way. So maybe stealth wasn’t Tony’s strongpoint, who cared? But this time he couldn’t even blame the alcohol, since he only had a few drinks.
It wasn’t that he didn’t like Shannon for example. After Natasha had tried to talk him into asking her out months ago, he had almost agreed. But if he was honest he was glad that now that she was exposed as a SHIELD agent, she was off the table and he didn’t have to go out with her. He didn’t think they’d work out. Same would probably go for Kirsten even though he didn’t even know who exactly she was. It wasn’t even about them in particular, it was rather about Steve who felt like he wouldn’t be able to open up to someone and he wasn’t even sure if he wanted to have a partner. Him being Captain America would get in the way sooner or later, he was sure about that. He had even deliberated over the different possibilities
“I know, I kinda miss him.” This time it was Tony who sighed. He didn’t plan on telling Natasha about his feelings, but it was the truth. It had only been a few days, but he just missed Steve.
“Damn,” Tony exclaimed, making Steve laugh. He took a few more steps until he was only an arm’s length from Tony, expectantly holding the coffee out to him. With a small shrug he accepted the cup, took a sip and placed it on the workbench, next to the project he seemingly was about to resume.
"Look, this doesn't have to mean anything. I just wanted you to know, wanted to be honest. I don't want to hide it anymore." He stopped himself before he could ramble on and finally looked up at Tony. "I like you, Tony."
he wanted that, they could just talk about it tomorrow. But Tony kind of couldn’t wait for Steve to be back since he left for the date. Which wasn’t even that long ago. That was probably the excitement of playing matchmaker, he told himself. Before he could dwell on that thought, his phone rang, demanding his attention. He earned disapproving looks from the board members, but he didn’t care, because Steve was calling him and Steve wouldn’t call if it wasn’t important.
“We need to talk.” With that Steve grabbed Tony’s arm and dragged him to the back of the room. They walked through a few aisles without saying anything. Steve looked around from time to time, probably searching for an unoccupied spot. After a few more turns, Steve opened a door that read ‘storage room’ and basically pushed Tony inside.
“I really don’t want to hear his name right now. You’re ditching me the third time in two weeks. When do I have to stop competing with him? Maybe you should finally decide who’s more important to you,” Tony almost yelled. It was unfair and he knew it, but he still couldn’t help himself. The way Steve stood him up again and again just to be with Bucky had led to more than one argument the past few weeks. Tony had even accused him of having a thing with Bucky. It hadn’t been rational, he knew that, but having self-confidence issues made you do shit like that.
“My vacation house on Plum Island. Before you ask, the island isn’t mine. They wouldn’t sell.” He shrugged before he opened the door. Following him indoors, Steve looked around and felt oddly at home. Asides from being a little smaller, the visible rooms appeared almost identical to Tony’s penthouse.
Tony watched Steve for a few moments, carefully considering what he just said. “I know I already asked this, but.. do you really mean it? The letter and.. everything you said?”
“Thank..you?” Steve gave him the same look as just a few moments ago before adding, “you too.” Was Steve a little flustered? That would probably be a good sign. Tony decided to keep going.
“God, please don’t call it that!” Tony groaned, after this conversation coffee probably wouldn’t do the trick anymore. This felt like a ‘passing out drunk’ kind of turn of events. “Maybe it’s just.. Maybe he wants something solid, a relationship or something. I don’t know.”
“That was kinda the whole point,” Tony just about managed to answer with a chuckle right before he felt Steve’s lips against his own.
After a while he decided to prepare the balcony in case Steve would come home and decide to not sleep on his own story. They didn’t need fancy dinners or stuff like that. Steve had always been the stay at home kinda guy and maybe Tony had tried to overcompensate with those dates.
Nothing really worked. Everything just kept reminding him about his feelings and the lack thereof on Tony’s side. Thus a few days later Steve came to a decision.
“Why? What should be going on between them?” Barton obviously didn’t have a clue what she was talking about.
Smiling at him, he closed the distance, gently gripping Tony’s shoulders, pulling him in for a deep, lingering kiss.
“But when? Why?” Steve still seemed confused and in need of answers, but Tony was sure they needed only one thing right now. “I think we should get home as fast as possible.”
Before he could even think about it, he raised his hand and slapped Steve’s ass. And maybe, just maybe, he shouldn’t have done that. Not only because literally everyone stared at him. All of them wore looks on their faces that could only be described as irritated. But Steve wasn’t only irritated or confused, he was all eyes and he appeared to be in absolute disbelief. He probably didn’t expect that and to be honest, neither did Tony.
After a long walk through the city during which he had been surprised by the rain, Steve took a shower and sat down on the cozy armchair by the big window. It had become his favourite spot to read, but today he simply watched the huge raindrops dashing against the glass while listening to the evenly, calming sound of the rain. Deep in thought he startled when the doorbell rang. Nobody had bothered him since he moved into the apartment and his friend assured him that everybody knew when he was out of town, not that he had too many friends. Alertness rushed through his body, informing his brain to be cautious. Steve listened for any telling sounds, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Then the bell rang again and after careful consideration, Steve decided to answer the door.
When they broke apart because they couldn’t get enough air with their mouths pressed together, both of them were breathing heavily.
“He just wasn’t perfect for me and I’m pretty sure I won’t find what I’m searching for by going on more dates.”
When they parted, Tony smiled sheepishly. "I'm so sorry. I promise I'll try to do better. I really want to make this work. Us."
Tony's eyes were bleary while he held Steve's gaze and for all the times Steve couldn’t read them, now he could see the hurt and the honesty in them. Not that he would have doubted that it was the truth. This was Tony, who never talked about feelings, so why would he if he didn't even mean it?
Steve let go of his lips, kissing his jaw before moving to the spot behind his ear, that made him shiver just like earlier.
Actually Steve still had full access just like he did when he had lived at the tower, but Tony didn’t want to let him know. At least Tony had two more days to mentally prepare for the encounter.
“Just to be clear, Tony. I didn’t want to play this any further, because it just got too real for me. I didn’t want a taste of something I couldn’t have..,” he trailed off.
it real. And there was the problem. Even if it had felt at least kind of genuine for Steve, for Tony it sure as hell didn’t. Which was the exact reason he really should put a stop to whatever they were doing, because there was no way Tony would want anything more from him than some fast sexual relief and Steve was only getting hurt more the longer he would continue this.
Steve feared he might start hyperventilating or worse actually leave. He gently took hold of his upper arms. "I'm not seeing anyone, Tony," he quietly told him. "And on the contrary, I'd very much like you to stay."
Steve’s first impulse was just attempting to act like nothing had happened, to go back to how things were before. It seemed like that was Tony’s deal as well. But neither of them succeeded since every conversation had turned out rather awkward.
“Oh, come on,” Steve said, “we both know that you’re way too clever for this. You’re smarter than the whole family combined. Of course you wouldn’t know stuff like that, your brain probably goes places most people couldn’t even dream of.”
Tony smiled at him as soon as he set foot into the room. “Steve!” he exclaimed as if they hadn’t seen each other for days and Steve startled at his name. The times when Tony wouldn’t use his name were long over, but he still usually called him ‘Cap’ or various variations of it, rarely calling him Steve. It felt.. good, familiar and kind of thrilling hearing him say his name. But Steve definitely shouldn’t think about it too hard, so he tried to dodge it.
The drive home took only a few minutes, Tony made sure of it. If Steve was glad now that they had taken the car he didn’t say anything. But talking wasn’t what Tony had in mind anyway. They barely made it to the elevator until he stepped into Steve’s space and kissed him again, sliding his hands over his shoulders, feeling the muscles even through layers of fabric. He had wanted to touch him for so long and planned to explore his whole body like this. Finally the elevator reached the penthouse and they stumbled out of it and into Tony’s living room.
There was silence for a few moments in which Tony probably considered his words. "You might have a point there.. So what're we gonna do instead?"
“He does, doesn’t he?” Steve smiled a little, but he still felt the need to clarify, “As I said... this doesn’t have to mean anything. I just wanted to let you know that I want to stop with the dates and I wanted.. to be honest.”

Tony was on his way to their shared kitchen but stopped in the hallway when he overheard a conversation in which Natasha mentioned his name.
Tony wasn’t sure if this was the good kind of being pushed inside an abandoned room or the bad kind.
The next time it happened they were already back at the tower. It had been about a week since they got home. A week filled with meetings and press conferences discussing their latest battle as well as a week without Tony. Or so it had felt. As soon as they had hit ground, Tony went to his workshop and rarely left it. Like usual, nobody really knew what he was doing, but Steve's best guess was that he kind of felt guilty for the chaos they caused during said battle and he tried to come up with something to prevent just that next time. But maybe he just found something on his suit that needed fixing, who knew, really? The only thing Steve did know was that he had seen him around alarmingly little. Especially around the food they saved for him and even around the coffee maker, which was.. Well, alarming. Not that it was news that he sometimes didn't sleep or eat for days in favor of working, but Steve was a little worried nonetheless, so he decided to pay him a visit. Armed with a fresh cup of coffee he made his way down to the workshop to find Tony hunched over the workbench, his brows furrowed in concentration. Steve stopped, taking in the view in front of him through the glass door. Okay, maybe he was blatantly staring, but luckily he knew how Tony was when he was working, eyes on the prize and everything, so he shouldn’t notice. It was by far not the first time Steve was amazed by Tony, of course not, but it just kept happening. The way he got lost in his work, caring for every detail, and worked until whatever it was he was building was perfect. He was a ‘all or nothing’ kind of person, not unlike Steve, but with even more passion. Not to forget that he never backed down from a fight, sometimes to Steve’s disadvantage, but always standing up for himself and everyone he cared about. And then he always looked pretty good doing it of course.
“Nooo. Let’s just stay in bed forever.” Tony pouted even though he wasn’t sure if Steve could see. He chuckled nevertheless, but maybe just at the statement rather than the pout.
“Guys, you’re really lacking training. Didn’t I tell you to train at least twice a week?” Ms. Cruel Punisher didn’t sound amused.
Tony pulled him in again, hugging him tight, his hands stroking Steve’s back. Apparently this was just what Steve needed right now, because he held on just as firm.
“Sounds perfect, actually,” he heard himself say before even really thinking about it and a second later he was already being pulled up from the couch.
Tony was silent for a few moments, before quietly asking, “is it really that bad? Why didn’t Steve tell me?”
Of course Steve would know what Tony had actually wanted to say, but he was glad that Steve didn’t end that sentence. They’ve had that talk and in a weak moment Tony had told him about his past, how Howard had treated him and how he never really felt like he was enough. No matter how much money or how many suits, saving people had been the only thing that made him feel worth something. But he didn’t want to go that road again and Steve clearly knew that.
After they broke apart and both of them only slightly leaned back, Steve took a deep breath, because he knew he needed to talk to Tony now or he wouldn’t do it at all.
Did he just imply what Tony thought he was implying? Could he really have some kind of feelings for him? For him there was only one way to find out.
Steve wasn’t sure if he meant for what he’d said or for clutching his arm, but he didn’t ask. All he knew was that his skin where Tony had touched him, suddenly felt cold.
“Isn’t it? Why does it feel like it so damn much?” Tony exclaimed. He didn’t want to hear that it was his fault. He was the only one allowed to make himself feel guilty.
Steve stood in the midst of the huge forest surrounding the compound, looking up at the treetops. Closing his eyes, letting the silence wash over him was something he came to enjoy, to need even. Whenever everything was a bit too much - and that happened fairly often with him being an Avenger, living with other, rather loud, Avengers and suddenly waking up in the 21st century, just to name a few - he found peace in nature. As much as he liked living in the city, he’d always relished Mother Nature: forests, beaches, mountains, he loved every landscape as long as there was no ice involved. Glaciers and snowy regions he rather avoided.
Steve Rogers and she screwed up big time. Tony would kick himself if he let such an opportunity slip.
“Well, guess we’re even.” With that he carried Tony through the apartment, while he only rolled his eyes in a very fond, not really annoyed way.
“Nope, it didn’t. But it wasn’t bad either,” he answered Tony’s question, because of course he would know which Disney movie was his favorite. Damn his attentiveness.
It wasn’t easy for Tony to not just say what he wanted to say, but he felt like it was necessary to ask about Bucky first. He was important to Steve and Tony thought it would help him understand that Tony was serious about what they had. Besides he needed to hear that he was fine, because otherwise Steve wouldn’t be either.
Steve looked down at Tony’s hand and cleared his throat. “Uhm, thank you,” he said, mirroring the movement, awkwardly patting Tony on the back.
Natasha was the first one to find her words again. With a wide grin she said, “get a room, you two!”
“You had no right to bench me for every other mission. You always said we’d be equal, but we never were. You know I never wanted to be a leader, but that doesn't mean that I can’t be trusted. But still you never trusted me. You watched my every step, questioned every decision I made.” He had yelled, but knew that the hurt in his voice was still distinct and right now he couldn’t care less. Steve should know how much it had pained him to know that he wasn’t good enough for him. For his so-called friend.
Tony’s thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of his phone. As soon as he answered, not even waiting for a greeting, Natasha started to speak, “everything worked perfectly. Steve still thinks Happy is driving him to some kind of interview. When they’re on 59th Street and 6th Avenue Happy will kick him out and tell him to walk to the Pond, where he’ll find you. ETA about five minutes.”
Different expressions flickered over Tony’s face, but Steve couldn’t guess what he was actually thinking when he answered. “Does that mean, Lincoln was.. a good choice? If he made you want to stop dating? But why aren’t you with him then?”
While the first two chapters were from Steve's POV, this one will be from Tony's. But I guess you would've figured this out real quick :D
Shifting in his seat Steve leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his knees. “Look, Tony. Try not to interrupt me, okay? I just wanna get this off my chest, even though it doesn’t have to mean anything.”
“Sooo, uhm I was thinking, could we.. you know.. expand the dating pool? Maybe add some.. men to the mix?”
“We've been talking about jerking off for the past 10 minutes, of course I'm hard. But fuck, that feels good.”
Zapping through the channels, Tony didn't find anything particularly interesting so he decided to go with Family Feud, which never failed to amuse them.
When the last Chitauri had been defeated, the only thing Tony wanted was to shower and spend some time alone with Steve, but apparently that was just too much to ask.
It's been a little over a week of hiding in the workshop, being irritated and occasionally snapping at teammates and Tony wasn't exactly sure what was wrong, but somehow everything and almost everyone seemed to annoy him. Steve was probably the only exception, but maybe solely because he knew Tony's moods and how to handle them.
He should be fast asleep. Almost too tired to keep his eyes open, he still forced himself to do just that. The pictures of a demolished New York were still way too present, shattered buildings, scared civilians and the far too close call when one of the aliens almost shot Tony out of the sky. Steve breathed in, but cut off the sigh before it could escape his mouth, just remembering that he wasn’t alone. Stuffed in a tiny bed, for a supersoldier at least, he laid next to Tony. On their backs, shoulder almost touching, they just about managed to not have any body parts hanging off the edges of the bed. It wasn’t comfortable and sleep was nowhere in near sight, but just because he couldn’t sleep didn’t mean he needed to keep the other man awake, too. Even though Steve mused that he wasn’t the only one having trouble sleeping if Tony’s not so even breath was any indication.
He arranged a balcony loveseat so that it would have the best view on the city, took a few blankets outside and made a bottle of wine available. When he was done, he sat down and let his eyes wander over the city. He really enjoyed the perks of owning a building like the tower all too rarely.
Clint had left an hour later and Tony was about to make his way over to the couch where Steve had been sitting when the alarm went off. So whatever they wanted to do had to wait until they saved New York City once again.
Tony pressed himself into Steve’s side, putting his head on his chest, tracing the muscles of his abdomen.
Tony watched him for a few seconds before he took off his own sweatshirt and replaced it with Steve’s.
Pacing back and forth a few times, Steve finally stopped at the wall opposite the entrance. Just about managing not to bang his head against it, he leaned his forehead against the cool wood, closing his eyes, taking a few deep breaths. This is stupid, he thought, pinching the bridge of his nose. Ready to get back and apologize, he turned around just when he heard footsteps approaching. Stomping through the door was Tony, eyes fixed on him.
He mentally checked off everything he just thought about Steve seconds ago and his eyes went wide with realization. “Well, shit!”
good. Not only because it was a sexual act per se, but because Steve couldn’t remember the last time it was someone else's hand on him. Never would he have thought the night would go like this, but the hand skillfully stroking him paired with the adrenaline of the mission and the fact that it was
“Cap, the world needs you,” he said, voice dead serious as if the earth was being attacked by aliens once again.
After another few seconds of watching him, Steve replied, “it just.. calms me. When my other senses become more awake, my thoughts pause. At least for a while.”
Steve slowly entered the balcony, his steps rather hesitant. Apparently he also wasn’t sure where they stood.
They laid low for a few days. Mostly because they didn’t meet any of the other Avengers since Barton was with his family for a few days and Romanoff and Banner were nowhere to be seen. Not that Tony would want to know where they were or what they were
“I..,“ Steve seemingly wanted to answer his question, but he didn't. Instead he said, “this isn’t just about the rumors, is it? What’s really up, Tony?”
“I might..” But Tony was cut off by Steve kissing him again. Apparently he didn’t really want to hear the answer. It would be embarrassing to admit that it took Tony quite a few days anyway.
Tony had to suppress the urge to snort at Steve calling him a good man, but that wasn’t the point right now. He still couldn’t deny that hearing Steve’s words, hearing that he apparently appreciated him made his anger die down a little.
No matter what he thought he would find, he would never have guessed this. Steve blinked as if to check if the image in front of him would disappear. It didn't. Tony was standing in front of him, his sweater soaking wet from the rain, his hair hanging into his face and his expression kind of wretched. And still Steve wasn’t sure if he was really awake, if this was real. But before he could continue to rack his brains, Tony started talking. “Steve, I.. I’m sorry, I..”
Another afternoon, another date, but this time Steve was facing a man instead of a woman. Not that it made him any less anxious. Maybe even the opposite. He didn’t really make a difference, new people in general unsettled him, but at least he had slightly more experience dating women. He had noticed that he was attracted to men years ago, but that was about it. He had never mentioned it until recently and he especially had never acted on it. Until about half an hour ago when Lincoln had entered the café.
“I guess I’m just pretty anxious all the time.” Steve gave him a crooked smile, but Bucky just frowned at him.
And then there was the sadness. The sadness even overshadowed the hurt. Steve had really thought he’d reasoned out the whole thing, but the truth was far from that. His plan had sounded so simple, no matter how hard it was to go through with it. Walk up to Tony, tell him about his feelings for him, get a response, walk away and continue with everything like usual. There hadn’t even been different options for various reactions he could get from Tony. If he would’ve told him he liked him, they would’ve figured it out. If he would’ve told him he didn’t have feelings, they would carry on being good friends. Simple as that, at least that’s what Steve thought. Even though it had crossed his mind, he kind of ignored the possibility of completely destroying their friendship.
“Morning,” Steve greeted them and instantly earned a groan in response. “What is wrong with you? Seriously. You can’t just get up at ass o’clock and go running every day. That’s not.. normal.”
When Steve woke up the next morning it took him a minute to realize where he was and how he got there. And even though he remembered that he was at Clint’s as well as why he was there, he was a little surprised to find Tony in bed next to him as he opened his eyes. That was when he
The next few days were no different, they joked, bickered and discussed their mission plans a once over just like they always did. There was no mention of the first night and no repetition. There wouldn’t even have been a chance to do it again, since their sleep schedules didn’t overlap, but Steve was assured that it had been a one-time thing anyway. Even though now that he did think about it and was at least partially prepared for what would be to come, he wasn’t opposed to the idea of repeating it.
“Of course.. thanks for the heads up by the way,” Steve said teasingly, when he stopped in front of Tony who was standing in the middle of the living room, disabling his armour with a chuckle. “Yeah, sorry. Wanted to have you to myself.”
Taking a deep breath which turned into a soft chuckle, Steve shot Lincoln a smile. Going by the look on his face he already noticed something was off.
“I told you, Bucky needs me.” Steve tried to soothe him, his voice calm, his thumbs stroking the back of Tony’s hands. It didn’t help though. Tony pulled his hands away, taking a few steps back.
“I still don’t get..” “Tony!” “ ‘m sorry,” he mumbled as he pushed off the backrest, sitting upright on the edge of the couch.
When he slowly came back to himself, opening his eyes, sitting up a tad straighter, he glanced at Tony, who was still crouching on the floor. A small smile played on Steve’s lips. “You want me to..,” he trailed off, vaguely gesturing in Tony’s direction.
“Don’t.” Tony stood up and with only a few steps he reached Steve, pulling him into his arms. Seeing him like this was just too much, Tony wanted to comfort him more than anything else. “There’s no reason for you to be sorry..”
A few weeks ago Steve started to think about confessing his feelings, almost every day he had been pondering if it would be worth it. Could he really risk losing their friendship over this? He tried to tell himself that it was only a crush, but he couldn’t even convince himself for more than one second. The chances of Tony having feelings for him were slim and that wasn’t even why he wanted to tell him in the first place. He just couldn't take it anymore. With each day his feelings grew even stronger. Every compliment he made him, every playful banter they shared, every unintentional touch, all those things sent fireworks through Steve’s whole body. Whenever he playfully kissed him on the cheek, it took Steve everything to not turn his head to welcome the kiss with his lips. It couldn't be long until he wasn't able to resist such impulses anymore and that was why he needed to tell Tony. Steve's consciousness also told him that he had a right to know.
They almost made it to a free table without being recognized or addressed. Almost. Only a few steps before reaching his goal Tony was stopped by someone he might have seen somewhere but didn’t really recognize.
Lost in thought, Steve had been quiet and was reminded that he didn’t answer when Tony shifted a little next to him. He closed his eyes, even though he couldn’t see much anyway, but if he really was going to make this suggestion it somehow felt safer with his eyes closed.
Steve closed the door behind him and leaned against it. He pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes for a moment. He needed a moment to calm down apparently. Tony had either done something right or pretty wrong. He didn’t want to think about it. but maybe having three scotches and not a bite from the buffet helped along. He raised himself on tiptoes once again and slowly leaned in, ready to kiss Steve in a now or never kind of way. But before he could lean in all the way, Steve opened his eyes again. He quickly put his hand on Tony’s chest. “Tony, what are you doing?” His expression still didn’t indicate anything. His tone was calm, but that wasn’t exactly enough to think yourself safe. Tony leaned back a little precautionarily.
Of course finding out about those few dates hadn’t satisfied Tony the slightest and he had kept on bugging Steve about it. About a week ago he had started suggesting different women they knew that could be interested in Steve. Just like he did with Shannon and Kirsten right now.
