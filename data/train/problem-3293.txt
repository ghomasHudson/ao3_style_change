“The entire wall around of Diamond City is painted an emerald green.”

They walk directly towards the room where Mr. Nichols’ is staying. The doctors had been notified ahead of time about their arrival so they were able to get everything prepared. “Can you tell me about the package, Mr. Nichols?” Castiel asks.
“I didn’t!” Castiel smacks him lightly on the arm. “Don’t ask stupid questions.”
“This is wondrous news!” The Guardian exclaims. “May the Great Alpha aid you in this endeavor to bring forth His blessed miracle!” If Dean wasn’t in so much pain right now he’d probably roll his eyes, but as it is he’s having a difficult time even opening them. “We have all the information we need.”
“Gabe, it’s me,” Castiel says in a panic, and Gabriel is immediately on high alert. “Sam got a list of the people who accessed that website Gadreel was posting to and one of the people on the list is Guy Jackson. Isn’t he the antiquities dealer you and Jo were going to meet?”
“It’s okay, I’m just signing in.” Dean quickly flipped through the book. “Babe, why don’t you go wait outside?” Castiel was too alert to appreciate the pet name. He moved to the exit door, but he didn’t want to leave Dean there alone. He wasn’t sure what he was planning to do.
“I can’t wait to see the look on that dick’s face when they find out,” Crowley laughed.
The Alpha holds eye contact with him. “It’s a date,” he says. “Now I think it’s time for you to go to bed.”
“I have my own garrison now, but I’m still working beneath Alistair.” Dean couldn’t help but shudder at the mention of Alistair’s name. Blue inconspicuously moved his arm to rest on the back of the couch and over Dean’s shoulder. “Hoping to get out of that situation as soon as possible though,” Blue continued and subtly ran his hand through the back of Dean’s hair. He stiffened at first and then leaned back into the touch. He wasn’t sure what was happening between them, but he wasn't going to complain if it involved Blue touching him. He made sure to file away the information that Blue wasn’t planning on working with Alistair for too much longer if he could help it. He’d have to ask about that later.
to be. It must've show on his face because Blue reached out again, and this time he wrapped his arms around Dean and pulled him into his chest.
“We need to talk,” Castiel says, his tone turning harsh. He can see Crowley stiffen.
“It’s so crowded in there,” she says. “At least someone spiked the juice.” She takes a big swig of what looks like orange juice from a glass and then passes it to him. He takes a sip and relishes the pleasant burn of alcohol as it slides down his esophagus.
“I find that these conversations are easier for everyone if we’re all on the same page from the beginning,” the Guardian says in a calm voice as he sits on the living room couch. He has a clipboard and pen ready to begin taking notes during Dean’s interrogation. “Eyes up, omega.” Dean slowly raises his eyes up to look at the Guardian. He’s dressed all in black as they always are, but other than that there’s nothing remarkable about him. He looks like a normal person. “Good,” the Guardian continues. “Ofal, if you answer these questions honestly, this will all be very painless for you. Alright?”
“He can be a bit insufferable at times,” Castiel said, making Dean chuckle because he definitely had seen that side of Gabriel. “But he’s always been there for me. We haven’t been as close in recent years simply because we were living on different sides of the country, but I wanted to come out here to fix that.”
When his Alpha kisses the base of his spine, he finds himself instinctively spreading his legs further apart. His Alpha seems to like that because he can hear him tearing off his clothes in preparation. He feels his Alpha’s big hands spreading his cheeks gently and blowing warm air on his hole. He feels so exposed, but surprisingly he feels safe. The first bit of slick starts dampening his hole, and his Alpha breathes him in deeply.
Dean rushes down the back staircase and opens the door to the courtyard. He’s desperate to feel the fresh air on his skin. He’ll never take these simple pleasures for granted again. He steps outside and takes a deep breath before making his way towards the metal gate where the new Ofmarv is waiting for him.
let that attraction turn into an unrequited crush.
1:30pm
“Do I look like I’m joking?” Dean asked, frustrated. “I’m serious. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know where I’ve been. I don’t know where I’m going. None of it.” He paused to let that sink in. “I only figured out my name a couple hours ago.”
“There’s a toll to cross this bridge, friend,” a raider called out from the lookout spot on the ship. He must've been the one on guard duty. Dean noticed how he called Blue ‘friend’ instead of ‘stranger.’ He must've been able to tell that they were raiders too.
“I know, it’s just a little awkward,” she giggles. “Anyways, I was thinking—“
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe that is the way to survive around here, but he’s not ready to give up yet. His daughter is still out there somewhere. They walk for a couple minutes in silence before he breaks it. “Are you from here?”
Gabriel steps forward holding a tiny computer chip from one of the S.W.A.T. team’s walkie-talkies. It doesn’t look like much, but Dean figures it’ll look better when it’s covered in the unsub’s blood. Gabe hands the chip to Sam and asks him to show him the magic trick. Sam pulls on a pair of latex gloves and tries to do his trick. The chip slips out of his hands and onto the ground.
“Of course I have to go!” John exclaims. “Plus I’d like to get a look at this girl, Lisa, Sammy says you’ve been dating.” Dean turns lightning-fast to glare at Sam who is shaking his head with wide eyes.
“Is this okay?” Blue whispered as he leaned in impossibly closer.
“Shhh, here they come,” Crowley whispered. He was sitting closest to the opening in the bushes where he could peek out at the girls without any of them being able to see him. Castiel rolled his eyes. He couldn't believe he'd let them talk him into doing this.
Castiel sat down on his sleeping bag and pondered for a minute, trying to think of a good one. He took another big sip from the bottle and everyone cheered. His tongue had definitely loosened up a little bit already. “Would you rather be in a loveless relationship or be single forever?” The other boys silently weighed their options, but he knew which one he’d pick right away. He’d rather be single and lonely than forced to fake feelings for someone he didn't love. He didn't know why this one seemed to be hitting so close to home tonight.
“Come in,” an accented voice said. The bouncer opened the door and motioned for the two of them to step inside. Once they had, he closed the door, and Dean could hear his footsteps retreating down the hallway. It looked like they were inside some sort of office. There was a bearded man sitting behind an ornate wooden desk. He was probably ‘The King’ that Blue had asked to see. The raider stepped forward with a smirk and ‘The King’ gasped.
Balthazar says he’ll go next. He takes a deep breath, and shoots Dean a small smile that Dean returns.
“Oh, come on, I was kidding!” Castiel can’t believe he’s begging to hang out with Dean and Benny at the mall, but this is what his life has come to apparently. It’s all Crowley’s fault.
The confusion must show on his face because Dean gives Charlie a light shove on the shoulder. “Stop scaring him or he’ll never want to hang out with us again.” The two of them share a loaded stare which almost makes it seem like they’re communicating telepathically.
,” Castiel mouths from across the table, but there’s that signature small smile on his face. It’s just a slight upturn of his mouth, but Dean has been on the receiving end of lots of those smiles recently, so he’s getting better at noticing them.
“She saw me after the presentations when you were backstage and gave it to me to give to you,” Sam whispers back.
“4:30,” Gabriel mutters. He’s starting to look a little nervous.
Balthazar laughed, “Same with me.”
“I’ll call Charlie and see if she can work some magic to identify who is on the bus from that low quality camera footage,” Dean says, pulling out his cell to call Charlie. He puts it on speaker so the rest of the team will be able to hear.
“How do you know?” Gabriel asks.
The sound of whimpering and crying was loud enough to wake up most of the omegas. There were grumbled complaints from some of them, and others got out of bed to try and assess the situation. As two of the older omegas, he and Charlie got out of bed to see what was wrong.
,” he mouths over his shoulder to the other boys, but also as a reminder to himself. “I consider this a win for all of us,” Crowley continues. “I mean, we’re still friends right? I’ll even let you guys help me design the new uniforms if you want.”
“Uhhh,” Balthazar says when the actor asks who is calling.
8:07am
“Please tell me you guys are going to the Novak charity benefit tomorrow night,” Dean said to Benny and Anna. Since he’d been exiled from Castiel’s group, the two of them had been picking him up for school.
“Me?” Gabriel huffs. “How could
“But shouldn’t I sleep on the couch?” He asked timidly.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” he says quietly, keeping his eyes shut. “I’m sorry about the costumes.” He pauses. “I’m sorry about everything.”
Dean spent most of the night arguing with himself. His gut was telling him that Castiel was bad news, and he needed to avoid him wherever possible. Obviously he’d have to interact with him some since they lived on the same property and went to the same school, but he needed to stop going out of his way to spend time with the guy. His heart was telling him that there was something more to Castiel than he could see, but that it'd take time to break him out of his self-absorbed shell. If that was even possible. Regardless of which part of him was winning the argument, it’d become clear that his little obsession was starting to get unhealthy.
“With you?” Crowley asked. “It might.” The boys laughed again, and Dean just rolled his eyes before running and launching himself into the air. He landed in a perfect cannonball that createed a big enough wave to splash the boys. Balthazar shrieked, but Gabriel laughed. He even saw the beginnings of a smile on Crowley’s face.
“Crowley, are you still there?”
Dean didn't notice that he’d been staring at the clock on the microwave for a full ten minutes, until he heard his father’s thumping footsteps come down the stairs. Great, he’d been drinking again. He hadn’t been doing much else since they moved in, and there were only so many times Dean could cover for him before the Novaks figured it out. What was the point in Dean trying to make friends when they’d likely get kicked out soon anyways?
(See the end of the chapter for
“If these living arrangements aren’t up to your standards, I can arrange to have you move down there, but I think you’ll find they are more hostile company than I am.” Blue raised his eyebrows in a challenge. Fuck, he could tell Dean was bluffing.
Castiel walks behind the rest of the group in a daze. Two hundred years. He can’t believe it, and yet there’s absolutely no reason for these people to lie to him. He can see the evidence with his own eyes. Parts of the landscape are the same, but the world has definitely changed drastically from when he went into the vault. What vegetation there is looks warped and twisted. There are some types of plants that he’s pretty sure didn’t used to exist. One of them has weird-looking purple fruit on it. Rufus picks one of the fruits as they pass by and immediately takes a bite out of it. Castiel guesses that means it isn’t poisonous.
“Huh. Thanks.” Benny heads over to the punch table, and Dean can’t help the small smile on his face. Cas is actually helping them out because Dean asked him to. Well to be fair, he kind of threatened him, but Castiel hadn’t put up as much of a fight as he normally would have. Dean has to celebrate the little victories.
“I’m not whining,” Dean whined.
He climbs the stairs up to the loft above the garage and knocks raptly on the door. Castiel opens it immediately. He’s wearing a plain t-shirt and sweatpants. This is the first time Dean’s seen him in anything other than his usual uniform. He looks surprised, but Dean doesn’t wait for him to say anything. He steps into the apartment and closes the door behind himself.
Castiel looks down at the ground. “Don’t get too close to her. It’s dangerous.” Dean’s eyes narrow, and he can see Castiel’s jaw clench a couple times, but he doesn’t look up at him.
I got really excited about Taylor Swift's new album, Folkore, and it made me want to write an angsty high school au. The story isn't necessarily inspired directly from the album, but I am using lyrics as chapter titles and am drawing inspiration from the nostalgic, high school feel of that record. Also, if any of you haven't listened to it yet, you really should!
“Seemingly intelligent,” Castiel corrects him. “She’s pretentious. She wants us to think she’s smarter than she is.”
“Get this off.”
“When is the shoot?” Balthazar asks. “It’s not on a school day is it?”
“She’s sweet,” Brady giggles, and Castiel barely stops himself from rolling his eyes. “I’m sure she’ll make
“The first victim must’ve found out that he was being scammed, and in order to shut him up, Jackson blows him up,” Gabriel muses. “We were right to think he’s doing this to cover up a crime.”
He zooms in on the note so they can see it. Sam squints at the screen and reads it out loud. “You will follow these instructions carefully to ensure the safety of your son. You will wait for a call and answer it at eight pm. You will write down the instructions and follow them exactly.”
“You can’t just take the book!”
“A beautiful, healthy baby girl,” Aunt Naomi says with joy. Everyone in the room releases a loud exhale before beginning to laugh with relief and excitement.
Dean moves his hands down to Castiel’s hips when he starts to feel them stutter. He knows if their hips connect, it’ll all be over. He refuses to come inside his pants and be forced to make a walk of shame back to the guesthouse. Cas’s hipbones are sharper than he thought they’d be, perfect for holding on to. And he’s stopping that train of thought before it can leave the station.
“Do you think they were sent through the mail?” Jo asks.
“What if it doesn’t?” He asked, and Garth just looked at him with a sad expression on his face, so he continued, “I’ve been down here for two weeks looking through all this shit, but I don’t even know what to look for. We’re going to make port tomorrow, and I don’t even have a name! All I have is this bank account number.”
“Yes,” Sam said. “He went to the bank. Our source at the bank is the person who called it in.”
“What?” He started, but then she quieted him.
“I just needed some fresh air, Mrs. Rolston,” he explains, hoping she’ll buy it. He does feel a bit faint, but not for the reasons she’d think.
Before Alistair had a chance to violate him further, the sound of a shotgun cocking came from behind them. “Step away from him now or I swear I’ll shoot!” It was Meg. Dean sighed in relief as Alistair released him. He quickly pulled his pants back up and looked up to see Meg push her shotgun to Alistair’s throat.
“And what?” Gabriel asks, frustrated.
Dean feels a hand on his arm, pulling him away. “There you are, Ofal!” It’s his shopping partner. “Hiding away in the vegetables.” She pulls him away from Jo, and he can’t help rolling his eyes. She must feel threatened by Jo since she was the original Ofmarv.
“I don’t know about news traveling fast, but the gossip sure does,” Garth replied.
Castiel pulls back briefly, his eyes hooded. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.”
Benny sighed, “This is gonna be a long night. What do you want to do?”
“W-who came?” He asked shakily.
Dean was just stepping in the front door when he got bombarded by Sam. He was still a kid, but he was getting noticeably taller. Dean wouldn't be surprised if one day Sam grew taller than him. He looked around Sam to see John struggling with whatever he was attempting to cook for dinner. The burning smell he'd noticed right when he stepped inside now made sense.
Dean used this time to take a closer look around this guy’s bedroom. Besides the sheer size of it, which had initially thrown him off, it looked pretty normal. Everything was in shades of blue, which was interesting since the first thing Dean had noticed about Castiel was his bright blue eyes. He wondered if the decorations were a purposeful choice. There was a desk with a laptop open on it, a television, and a door that Dean guessed opened up to a closet. There was also a shelf full of trophies on one wall. Dean took a step closer and saw that the trophies were for horseback riding and tennis. He rolled his eyes—typical rich kid sports. In the center of the trophies was a picture of a younger Castiel standing next to a black horse. There was also a cat tree in the corner with a sleeping Siamese cat on it. No wonder his nose had been itchy since he walked in here.
They got to the Red Rocket a few minutes later. These pre-war gas stations often still had salvageable materials scattered around if you knew where to look. Of course they'd already scavenged everything valuable from this spot when they'd checked it out a couple weeks ago. Castiel nodded at Meg to signal that it was time, and she and Ruby stood to block the alley so the other men couldn’t escape.
“That’s a pretty good one,” Garth admits. “For you.”
“No, don’t do that,” Dean managed to say. “I haven’t talked to anybody in a while.”
Dean stepped back out to pick the lock to the trunk. When he first opened it, there didn’t appear to be anything out of place. It just looked like a trunk. There was a blanket, a few receipts, and a porno magazine. Dean quickly moved the blanket to cover up the magazine, but he heard Cas’s deep chuckle from beside him, so he knew he must’ve seen it.
Directly across from where he’s sitting is the door to his closet. He’s gotten well acquainted with his room in the last twelve days he’s been stuck in it, but he hasn’t spent as much time in the closet yet. He slowly crawls across the wooden floor towards it. Walking would be way too difficult right now. He does have to get up to open the door and turn on the light though. After that’s done he sinks back down to the ground in between the identical hanging red dresses that make up his entire wardrobe. He didn’t used to have much opinion about colors, but he can safely say now that he hates the color red.
“Perfect! Now is there anything in particular you want me to plan for?” She asked while taking notes on her iPad.
“Yeah, see ya!” Dean hung up, a bit perplexed by the short call.
Monday, September 7
They’re interrupted by Jo and Sam peeking into the room from the top of the stairs. It seems Gabe has enlisted Sam to help Dean out with the CDs while Castiel drives Jo over to the prison. Apparently she doesn’t have a driver’s license even though she’s twenty-three, so she needs Castiel to drive her. Apart from that, she’s too new of an agent to go out in the field by herself anyways.
“I had to tell my mom that the two of us would co-host the party in order for her to give me permission,” Castiel explained.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed. Dean cooked him meals, watched his favorite shows and movies with him, let him sleep in his bed, and he didn't consider that a relationship? “What are you so afraid of, Dean?” He asked angrily. It’d be one thing if he was reading too much into things, but he’d seen the way Dean looked at him. It was the same way he looked at Dean. He’d heard the things Dean had said to him, the way he’d called him “baby” and asked him to stay after their first time. He knew Dean felt the same way, even if it didn't make any sense to him why he would.
“Oh, now they want to play,” Gabriel mumbles to Castiel.
“I feel like I’m sitting in a box of colored pencils,” he grumbled.
Jo gasps, “You’re?” She stops walking and turns to look at him.
The two of them are standing outside the gazebo, and the sun has mostly set behind them. “You’re the one who started this,” Castiel says. He doesn’t say it in a mean way, he’s just confused, but he notices Dean’s jaw clench.
“And finally,” Castiel says. “I think this last part speaks for itself.” He points towards the right side of the board where he wrote two names. On the left is Crowley’s name. There’s a big red ‘x’ across his name. On the right of that is Dean’s name which has been circled. Castiel watches as the tears spill over, and Crowley begins to cry. He turns around and runs out of the barn. Gabriel and Balthazar high-five, but Castiel instantly feels a pit in his stomach. This was supposed to make himself feel better, not worse.
Nobody else bid any higher, so Naomi called Dean forward to get his outfit. After the fight, he’d decided that he should give it back Crowley. He didn't like being in anyone’s debt. Then he thought about it and realized if he auctioned it off, he could buy it back with the money he had saved up, and he’d have the satisfaction of embarrassing Crowley a bit in the process. Plus the money was going to a good cause.
Castiel had no idea what his neighbor was talking about, but he found himself answering anyways. “Green wall,” He croaked. “Follow the white arrows.” He didn’t know how that was the right thing to say, but Dean seemed satisfied.
“Wake up! Wake up, dammit!” Castiel felt himself being shaken forcefully by someone. “I’m sorry it took me so long, man. Please wake up! Don’t leave me here alone.” The voice sounded familiar. He batted his eyelids open slowly and was greeted by a pair of glassy green eyes. Dean. He came back for him. “Thank fuck,” Dean leaned his forehead against Castiel’s. “I thought I lost you for a second there.”
“You’re right, I don’t, but when I tell him about what you did, you’ll be lucky if he doesn’t come slit your throat,” Meg hissed and then shoved Alistair away so she could grab Dean’s arm. She pulled him along until they were back in the main area with all of the metal staircases. “Blue has been freaking out, Dean, what the hell were you thinking?” Dean felt the tears streaming down his face again, and he was powerless to stop them. Meg looked at him and her face softened. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have…” She paused. “Let’s just get you back safe.”
“What do you think of this sweater?” Balthazar asks Gabriel.
A cute blonde girl Dean hasn’t seen before is standing by the glass doors to the BAU holding a manila envelope. She looks like she’s in her early to mid-twenties. Dean is about to raise his eyebrows at his brother in their silent language to say ‘wow she’s cute,’ but he stops when he sees the look on Sam’s face. He is looking at her with heart eyes, and Dean tries not to chuckle. She is so far out of his league, but if he wants to shoot his shot, Dean will let him. He has Lisa anyways.
He tries to surreptitiously glance towards the desk next to him where Crowley sits. He’s trying to gauge if Crowley has been affected at all by their fight earlier. Castiel is really upset, so why isn’t Crowley? Does their friendship mean nothing to him? He keeps thinking that the right time for their revenge will be obvious to him, and that he just has to be patient, but now his Friday night sleepovers are at stake. He can’t sit still any longer. Crowley has woken a sleeping dragon, and the dragon is PISSED!
“Yes, ma’am,” he answered. “After the new mission is complete, do I continue with my current mission?” Charlie could hear the apprehension in his voice, and she knew the reason for it. Benny and Dean were friends, and he must've been struggling with the idea that he was supposed to take him out.
“What does he want?” Castiel asks.
Garth watched while Jim and a couple other crew members brought the man’s body down into his cabin. They pulled him onto the cleared off desk, and Garth thanked them before he asked them to leave. He immediately noticed two bullet holes in the man’s back. He carefully cut through the man’s wetsuit to get access to the wounds. He was able to remove both of the bullets without waking the man up. He must be really out of it. There was no way for Garth to tell how long he’d been floating in the ocean or how he was still alive.
“Says the guy who moves slower than detention,” Garth mumbles under his breath making Dean laugh. He starts to jog over to the limo. He doesn’t want to make them late. He can feel Garth following behind him, the decorations on his headgear clanging against each other as he runs to keep up.
“Well then why are you guys just standing around?” Larry asks angrily. “Everyone is just standing around here. Go find my son!” One of the secret service agents comes forward and grabs onto Larry. Castiel can’t hear what she says to him, but Larry deflates and lets her lead him to the couch away from the BAU team. Jo and Jessica come to join in with their huddle.
“Yeah…”
“The Letters,” she says quietly.
Benny sits with him while they wait for the medicine to take effect. Eventually the cramps have subsided enough to where Dean can go clean himself up in his bathroom. When he comes back into the room, he sees Benny working on removing the dirty sheets from his bed. He blushes in embarrassment, but Benny doesn’t seem to mind. Since he’s a beta, he’s not affected as strongly by the smell.
Balthazar answers for him. “Nope, he was actually really cool about it.” The two of them smile at each other again, and Castiel has to admit he’s impressed. Dean hasn’t told anybody about the secrets the two of them share either, and now he knows he can trust he won’t.
I'm on a roll with this story and having writer's block on a couple of my other ones, so I guess I'll keep posting. Hope you're enjoying it!
Richard just smirks and says, “Whatever, man.” Gabriel sighs. He’s not going to be able to crack him, or at least not in time to save Ashley Frank.
Dean opens his mouth to respond, but no words come out. Before he has the chance to say anything, the door opens and Benny and Castiel step inside. The Commander quickly stands up and moves to the other side of the room. Dean shoots a quick look towards Castiel before he turns back around to face forward. The driver’s face looked closed off and possibly even angry. Is he mad at Dean or at the Commander?
“Well, I’m transferring you to the Office of Too-Fucking-Bad,” Charlie retorts, and Dean hears Castiel gasp quietly beside him. He’d almost find that funny if he didn’t have only five chances to get onto this kid’s computer. Dean tells her that he’ll call if he has any more questions.
The other Guardian came up behind him and grabbed his arm to start leading him away. Dean kept his eye on the train as it pulled out of the station, knowing this might be the last time he’d be able to see his best friend. Once the train was out of sight, he let himself be dragged away. He was probably going to be harshly punished when he got back to the training center, but he couldn’t find the energy to care. Charlie was gone and any dreams of escaping were gone with her.
Dean tried his best to contain his giddiness as he prepared to run from the Parisian police. Now wasn’t the time to be happy that Cas chose to stay with him. He had to focus. He put the stupid Prius in drive and waited for the police officers to get closer to him. He couldn't believe he was about to initiate a car chase while driving a fucking Prius, but that was the hand he’d been dealt today.
I wasn't planning on posting an update to this yet since I have other stories I need to update, but after the finale last night I think we can all use some fanfic. This chapter was already written so I figured I'd go ahead and post it.
“That’s why I’m in charge,” Blue chuckled. “Alright everyone, we’re checking the hospital. I’ll take the first floor. Meg, you take the second. Ruby, you check the basement, and Gordon and Zach you guys keep a look out. Let’s try to get this done before sundown.”
Dean slapped Sam lightly on the shoulder. “Alright, quit bragging,” he said fondly before turning to the brother. “Yes, he’s a genius.” Sam looked embarrassed when he shrugged Dean’s hand off of his shoulder. It was clear that the two of them were close, and Dean seemed to be very proud of his brother.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Dean asked.
The raider nodded and motioned for them to come forward. Blue reached into one of the duffel bags and pulled out a couple chems to give the man. Dean had never taken chems before, but he’d always wanted to try them. They were created to aid in combat, but mostly people took them to get high. That meant they were pretty valuable. Dean wondered if Blue used them himself or just collected them when he saw them to trade in moments like this.
“Benny is at the doctor, so Castiel said I could sit here today,” Dean responds evenly.
Gabriel calls the BAU members and the detective in charge of the case into the conference room to show them something. Castiel hopes they’ve caught some sort of break because their one lead, Nichols, went nowhere. Gabriel pulls up a few pictures on his laptop of four reassembled bombs lined up in a row.
“Shut up, Sammy,” Dean growled at him, but Sam just started howling in laughter now. He ended up running out of the room to try and compose himself. Castiel could still hear him laughing from the living room.
“There has to be something else,” Dick mused, and Sam wondered if he was just thinking out loud. “Maybe check to see if there are any angles from the street or nearby buildings.”
Sam was trying his best not to fall asleep while he looking through hours upon hours of Parisian surveillance footage. Dick had him—and the majority of the other agents who didn’t already have a task—sifting through various CCTV footage from restaurants, businesses, and anything that had views of the streets. They were trying to see if they could find any trace of where Dean might be.
“What time were you supposed to bake together?” Castiel asks Gabriel.
“Uh,” Castiel groaned, fumbling with the bag. He dumped the contents out on the floor. “He has pills like yours.”
“It’s fine, we’re leaving.” Dean quickly ripped a few pages from the register and grabbed Castiel’s arm to pull him out of the office. They started walking back to their hotel in silence while Dean read through the pages. It was dark out by now, so he was using the dim glow from the street lights to read.
Blue groaned again and leaned his head back against his shoulder. Dean just about melted. He was so beyond fucked. He should use this chance to escape, leave Blue here to die, and run as fast as he could back to his farm. The pain he felt when he thought about leaving Blue here was proof in itself that this had grown way past physical attraction into something Dean didn’t even want to think about. He leaned down and kissed Blue’s forehead, rationalizing to himself that he was just checking the older man’s temperature. Really he was trying to be as close to him as he could be before he wasn't allowed to anymore. Blue's temperature had gone down slightly. He was still warm, but not disconcertingly warm.
Dean got ready to step in, but Castiel just smiled and pulled out the article, slowly pushing it across the table towards the suspect. “Are you a fan of Gadreel Pinikett’s work?” That was the name of the bomber who blew up all of those agents.
“One moment please,” the woman replied, and he heard her typing something into a computer. “I’m sorry, I have nobody by that name registered there. Is there something else you need?”
“It’s not going to be that easy to get rid of me, Blue,” he laughed. Dean leaned over to get him another cup of water which he eagerly gulped down. The sun was definitely setting now, and Dean knew there was no way they’d be able to travel tonight even if they wanted to, so he laid down next to Blue on the sleeping bag. “I’m kinda terrified that if I let you go to sleep right now, you won’t wake up,” he laughed nervously.
Dean was twenty-nine now, but he’d been in the FBI since he was twenty-three. He was originally just a basic field agent, but when he happened to work on a case with Bobby, the older man had seen potential in him that nobody else in his life ever had. Bobby showed him how he ran the BAU, and Dean was immediately hooked. He’d always been interested in criminal psychology, but he'd never thought he’d be smart enough to get picked for this elite team of agents. Sammy was the Winchester with the brains, while Dean had always been the brawn.
Dean was about to hang up when he remembered something. He quickly dumped out the bank bag onto the desk, looking for the French passport that had only the front page and a name on it. “Could you look up another name for me?” He asked, pulling up the passport. “Dean Michael Cain.”
“Yeah, me too,” Kali says. “I’ll play.”
“Then tell me this, and I’ll drop it.” Dean looked at the ground to avoid a massive puddle in the middle of the road. “Are you on the level?”
“Maybe you should invite them to join you and your friends at the tennis club, then you wouldn’t have to miss out on your plans,” Naomi offered.
is what you want, cher?” Benny chuckled, and Dean rolled his eyes. He never should’ve opened his mouth about Castiel to Benny. Of course his friend wouldn’t understand. Yes, his neighbor was insanely attractive, and Dean would do just about anything to get his hands under those tight vests he always wore, but that was different from having a crush on the guy. “Seriously, Dean,” Benny continued. “The quiz didn’t say this, but you can’t expect someone else to make you happy. Happiness comes from within.”
He trudges up the front steps of the guest house and is about to open up the door when John does it for him. “Welcome home, son!” John wraps him up in an unexpected hug. He’s drunk again. Typical. Then again, Dean would much prefer overly-loving drunk John to angry, yelling drunk John. “You smell like a man!”
“He’s very loyal, and he’s been with us for a long time,” she explains. “We can trust him.” For a second, it looks like she’s waiting for him to agree, but when he doesn’t, she continues. “He’s already said yes.”
He’s honestly surprised he’s grown this obsessed with the willful omega after a few short weeks. Not only is it throwing his head for a loop, it’s also making him question his sexuality. He keeps this secret for many obvious reasons, but he’s always considered himself gay up to this point. He’s only ever been attracted to male betas or other Alphas. He’s always been attracted to the idea of male omegas, but despite some people swearing up and down that they exist, he hasn’t ever met one. He thinks if he ever did, he’d lose his damn mind.

“What picture did you send of me?” Gabriel asks nervously.
Blue was standing still waiting for him with an indecipherable expression on his face. Dean could see that the leader of the group was watching them. When Dean got within a few feet of Blue, the raider grabbed his wrist and yanked him forward towards him. He leaned down to Dean’s ear and whispered, “I just saved yours and your brother’s lives. Don’t fight and don’t run.” Then he shoved Dean hard so he fell down. He didn’t have time to react before the man kicked him in the ribs. Dean grabbed his side and groaned. “Get up, bitch. I don’t have all night.” Dean looked up at the leader and saw him smile and turn away to follow the rest of the group. He slowly got to his feet and looked up at his captor with hurt on his face. Blue turned and started walking, expecting Dean to follow. He had no idea what was happening, but he knew for right now he needed to behave and do what he was told. He couldn’t risk them coming back to hurt Sammy.
Gabriel looks up. “What?”
“While that was enjoyable, that’s not why I stopped you before you could leave,” Castiel says. “He wants to see you.”
“At random times like this?” Castiel asked.
“No!” Castiel stood up quickly, and everyone looked at him in shock. “He’s my only new recruit so I’ll be taking him.”
~ * ~
Dean leaned down and kissed his forehead again reflexively. Hopefully Blue was too out of it to notice. “I’ll come back as soon as I can. You better not be dead when I get back!”
Dean smiled. He couldn't believe such a perfect opportunity had just presented itself like this. He got up and paced around while trying to think of how he could use this to his advantage. He pressed his ear up to Castiel’s closed door to make sure he couldn't hear anyone coming down the hallway.
“Alright. You wait here and cover me then,” Blue ordered before jogging off towards the building to start checking the bodies. Dean wasn't sure what he was going to find, but ghouls did sometimes pick shiny things up that they saw on the road. Sometimes they still had whatever the original person was carrying when they got turned into a ghoul. That was one of the creepiest things to Dean—these were real people at one point. They could’ve been alive during the time of the Great War and turned into ghouls by the radiation, or they could’ve been alive during his time and were unlucky enough to get bitten and turned. Either way it was creepy, and Dean shivered despite the fact that it was pretty warm out tonight.
“Yes, hello,” Dean responded. He was unsure what else to say, so he waited for her to speak again.
“I said I’d fix this,” Dick assured him. “I promise I will.”
“Well that makes sense,” Dean chuckles, and Charlie punches him lightly on the arm. He fakes being hurt for a second before getting serious again. “How these things are put together can tell us a lot about how the unsub thinks.”
“Be quiet,” Castiel hissed and puts his hand over Gabe’s to stop him from crinkling the noisy plastic anymore. Some girls were walking towards the bushes, but he didn't see Anna among them. “She has red hair,” He said and tried to move slightly so he could peek around Gabriel.
“Have you worked many cases like this?” Alfie asks him.
“Perfect timing, Blue,” She said cheerily. It was an act. He knew her better than he knew himself, and he could tell she was nervous about this meeting tonight. She was also probably concerned about how he’d acted when he killed Gordon this morning.
The unsub on the other end of the line is already yelling. “What are you doing?! I will kill him if you don’t stop. Do you underst—“ Dean hangs up again. Castiel looks over at the living room and sees that Alfie is crying. Jessica is holding him and rubbing his arm soothingly. He can tell that she is also stressed out. She’s very new at this job, and she’s not a profiler so she doesn’t know how these tactics work.
“Ew, why?” Castiel asks.
. He gasped and turned around briefly, instinct urging him to help, but he knew there was nothing he could do. The two most important people in his life had been in that car with him, and now all he had left was his pup.
“Dean,” Blue started hesitantly. “You know you could’ve called out for them, and they would’ve saved you.” He looked reserved, like he was waiting for Dean to snap at him or something.
“Yes, baby?” Dean whispered.
“He did?”
“I’ll be back to help unpack as soon as I am able,” Castiel promised, giving her a gentle kiss on the lips. He picked up his bag and walked towards the door.
“Welcome to the Combat Zone,” Charlie said, stepping forward to embrace him in a hug. Dean was too surprised to react, but whatever look was on his face made Blue chuckle.
“It’ll go public at an assembly tomorrow morning, but if you want to hear it before then, it’ll cost you ten.”
“I have my fair share,” He said quietly, and he heard a snort come from next to him.
He sits up slowly when he hears footsteps coming up the stairs towards his room. There’s a hesitant knock on the door, and then he hears Castiel’s low voice ask, “May I come in?”
(See the end of the chapter for
he saved his life when he could’ve left him to go back to his family. Castiel had to give him something. “Gabe is a good friend,” he said quietly. “Honestly he’s more like a brother. I promise I’ll tell you more later. I just can’t right now, Dean.”
Dean barely stifled a whimper at the feeling of Blue’s stubble against the sensitive skin of his neck. He felt Blue press a couple kisses to the skin below his ear, and then he did whimper quietly when he felt the smallest hint of teeth against his neck. Blue groaned and thrust into him again. “Don’t you dare hide those noises from me,” He whispered against Dean’s ear. “I want to hear you come apart for me.”
“What’s wrong?” He asks when it seems she isn’t going to say anything.
“Is that so?” The man holding Sam turned to look in Blue’s direction. “What makes you say that?”
The morning bell rings three times in a row. That’s not the bell to signal shopping time. That bell means all the omegas are to meet in the town square immediately. He goes downstairs to tell Benny that he won’t be able to do his shopping today. A summons is considered more important than his normal duties. “Good morning,” he says. “I’ve been summoned-"
Dean rubs his arm. “The signature is the thing they get off on,” he explains. “Using certain materials to make their bombs, stuff like that. These guys think of themselves as artists. It’s like a way of signing their work.”
One day Castiel woke up to find Mary hanging from the wall where Alistair would string up his enemies as a warning to passing groups. Apparently Mary couldn’t take the abuse anymore, and she’d tried to run. They caught her, and Alistair killed her. That same day, Castiel left Alistair’s garrison to take off on his own. The only reason Alistair didn’t send people after him was because he knew he’d never be able to beat Castiel in a fight.
“I’m not sure…” Dean replied. “I just have a feeling.” He turned to look at the window at the end of the hall and took a step towards it. Right when he moved there was the sound of gunfire breaking the glass, and a man swung into the apartment on a rope, Tarzan style. The man was dark-skinned and holding an AK-47 that was firing on automatic.
Now he was standing in a mansion that had to be at leave five times the size of his old house in Kansas, next to a boy who apparently chose to wear a vest and tie on the weekends. He looked down at the swimming pool and tennis courts in the yard and tried his best to stay relaxed, but inside he was freaking out. He’d never been in a house this big before. The other boy didn't show any signs that he was going to be the first one to break the awkward silence, so Dean looked around the room desperately for anything to talk about. He walked towards a corkboard over a desk with a bunch of pictures on it.
, but he's not allowed to use it anymore. It's against the law now. It feels like everything is against the law now.
“I know,” Dean replied simply.
“Fuck, I think it got you,” Dean pointed to Blue’s leg where he was bleeding. Dean couldn’t tell if it was a bite or just a scratch from something else, but it wasn't worth taking a chance.
The train came screeching into the station then, and Charlie looked back to meet his gaze. She immediately noticed the Guardian standing next to him, and her face quickly switched from confusion to terror.
“Alright, Cas.” Dean stepped over towards the sink. “We need to fix your hair.”
“What did you say your emergency was?” Crowley asked.
“Hey guys,” Dean says quietly, probably trying to alleviate some of the tension. Crowley sits directly across from them, Gabriel is on the left side of the table, and Balthazar sits across from Gabe on the right side. The three of them look up at Castiel first, silently asking if they’re allowed to respond. He gives a small nod. Dean probably doesn’t even notice, but it’s a move they’ve perfected over the years.
Dean didn’t know how long he’d been asleep when he was woken up a second time. Instead of being woken up by the silent sounds of Blue shuffling around in the dark, this time he was woken by the thrashing body next to him. He bolted upright. Blue was groaning and flailing his arms everywhere, and Dean immediately could tell he was having some sort of nightmare. He sat up and tried to grab hold of his arms, but the older man was moving around too quickly. He ended up catching an elbow to the face which stunned him momentarily before he was able to finally catch both of Blue’s hands in his own.
“Well, then you better start bidding,” Dean winked at him. Benny looked like he was about to jump in to defend his friend, but his mouth dropped open. He wasn't used to seeing Dean act all defiant like this and was caught off guard.
“Broken rank to claim responsibility for a new recruit. Or insisted that said recruit share his personal quarters instead of staying downstairs in the dormitories we specifically set aside for new recruits. It’s not like him.” Now Dean was confused as well. Why would Blue go through so much effort for him? Especially since it looked like it’d gotten him in trouble with the Boss.
He leans over her to give her a lingering kiss. “Gabriel told me that whenever we get called out to work on the weekends, Bobby gives us weekdays off to make up for it. Hopefully that means I’ll get a three day weekend with you.”
“This is only going to work if you relax, babe,” Dean said, gently rubbing his hands against his ass. Castiel knew the endearment probably just slipped out of his mouth in the heat of the moment, but he couldn't help the feeling of butterflies that erupted inside of him. He tried to take a few deep breaths to relax himself. “That’s good, Cas,” Dean praised, and then he jumped at the first touch of Dean’s tongue to his entrance. “Is this okay?”
The man smiled. “You’re welcome.” Dean put the bottle in his bag and looked up to see that he was still staring at him. “By the way, my group is camped out at the Corvega Assembly Plant, and we plan on staying there for a while. You should probably find another place to scavenge for supplies. The rest of them aren’t as friendly as I am.” Dean nodded in understanding, and with a final small smile, Blue left just as quietly as he'd arrived.
12:10pm
It was also nice to have Cas around, because he remembered things about him that Dean had forgotten with his amnesia. He wouldn’t have known to check his car for potential clues if Cas hadn’t reminded him that was where he’d likely hide something for himself. Hell, he wouldn’t have known he even had a car.
He listens to the second message. It’s from Balthazar.
“What’s Diamond City?” Castiel asked, his voice gruff from disuse.
Gabriel turns towards Sam. He has a notepad and a pen ready to take notes if he needs to. “Sam, are there any delusions that are more common than others to a paranoid person suffering a psychotic break?” He asks. “If we could narrow down what we’re dealing with that could help.”
The fight moved from the hallway into his office. Dean grunted as the knife nicked him in the side, but he could tell it was just a shallow wound. He dodged the next slash, landed a kick to the man’s ribs, and then grabbed the hand holding the knife. He twisted the man’s arm at an angle that had to be painful, trying to get him to drop the knife, but he didn't. The man swung his leg out, forcing Dean to fall onto the ground.
“What are you—” Dean started.
“What the fuck did you do to me?” He yelled at the man. “Where am I?” The man choked and tried to respond, but he was holding him too hard. He let his grip on the man loosen enough for him to reply but not enough for him to be able to break out of his hold.
“Why not?” Alfie asks, confused.
Castiel looked up and saw that the sun was directly overhead. He wondered how long he’d been lying on this hard ground with nothing but a ratty sleeping bag as a cushion. No wonder his joints hurt. “The storm finally passed,” Dean said while he rummaged through one of the backpacks. “Here take this.” Dean handed him a couple pills and a cup of water. They were Rad-Away pills. Hopefully that would help him start feeling better. The radiation poisoning must've been what was causing this sickness. He took the pills and grimaced as he felt them leave a bitter residue down the back of his throat. He took a few more swigs of the water to try and wash it down.
“Guided by His howl,” he says instead, using their traditional closing.
He hears footsteps coming up the stairs, and he hopes it’s not Castiel. Another rush of slick pours out of him at the thought of what might happen if Cas were to get a whiff of him right now. He seems to really like Dean’s scent. He moans pitifully. Now is not the time for illicit fantasies.
“Wait, your dad knows the actor who plays Denny Drake?” Dean leaned forward in his seat. “How?”
“Yeah, we can get you something new,” Castiel says with a smile.
“I did, but you were probably so tired it didn’t wake you up,” Cas said with a smile. “Besides, I didn’t mind driving.” Dean could tell they were probably in Paris based on the architecture around them. “Oh, here.” Cas handed him a McDonald’s bag. “For twenty-thousand dollars, I figured I should throw in breakfast.”
Everyone goes completely quiet. Castiel doesn’t even know what to say. He’s heard about how some people don’t have money to buy food, but it’s completely outside of his reality. He hadn’t thought that someone he knows might have gone through something like that.
“Or I was working some sort of job involving boats,” Dean said. “Come on. It shouldn’t take too long for us to walk there.”
“Can he do that?” Crowley asked, shocked.
Castiel smiled, and Dean swore he could see a hint of a blush on his cheeks. That was an interesting development. Was there a chance Cas might be into him the same way he was into Cas? He’d need to investigate that later. The two of them crossed the busy street when it cleared and noticed a bunch of doorbells at the side of the door. He saw
“What about a small guy like Svenson?” Castiel asks.
“That’s not all the doctors are saying though,” he said in a panic. “I know three omegas at work who have had miscarriages, and some of them were pretty far along.” He ran his hands through his short hair nervously. “One omega I know was able to carry to term, but her pup only lived for a few days.”
Castiel waits for Crowley, Balthazar, and Gabriel to set up their lunches at the table before he speaks. “I have an update that’s worth ten gossip credits.”
Castiel was startled out of his thoughts by a light snore coming from next to him. He looked over to see that Dean was completely out. It was probably a good thing since he said he hadn’t slept in a while. Plus, it gave him more time to think about everything.
Castiel puts his hand on Dean’s left shoulder. At first he wants to flinch away, but the touch is actually grounding. “We don’t have any other choice.”
“That’s why I brought this,” Blue pointed to a water purifier. Dean had never used one before, but in theory they could heat up water to boiling and that would kill off the radiation and other harmful bacteria so it became drinkable.
“Because we can see her right now,” Dean says. “We finally got into Svenson’s computer and there’s a live webcam trained on her. Her eyes are covered with duct tape, and she’s bound and gagged, but she’s definitely alive.”
“I like present you too,” Dean said softly as he started to lean in.
Castiel looked at him in open-mouthed horror. What was wrong with this kid? “Feel free to have the rest of mine then.” He couldn’t possibly force any more down, so he scooped what was left of his into Dean’s bowl. He couldn’t wait until they were on the road again so they could hunt some real meat to eat.
Suddenly it all clicks. Jackson has absolutely no intention of coming out of that room. He’s not a bomber, he’s a forger. Castiel clicks on his earpiece and yells at Gabriel, “Get out of there NOW!”
The Guardians must’ve had time to set up a spike strip on the road, because when Jo runs over it, the tires immediately pop. When the car finally stops, the Guardians rush it, breaking out the window, unlocking the door, and forcing Jo out of it. They drag her towards a black van and shove her inside.
One of the wives groans, “It’s taking forever.” Dean wants to hit her. She has no idea what it’s like to go through labor and push a pup the size of an eight pound watermelon out of her body.
Dean taps his foot impatiently while he sits at the computer and flips through screenshots of the webcam feed trying to find anything that could give them a location. There’s nothing distinguishable in the room Ashley Frank is being held in. She’s in a cage that’s bigger than a dog cage, but not big enough that she can really move around much. Other than that there isn’t really anything of note in whatever room she’s in. The webcam is in greyscale, but he can tell it’s pretty dark in the room except for some sort of light hanging from the ceiling.
Crowley sighed. “Fix this, Roman. All of our asses are on the line here.” He opened the door and stormed back into the hallway before Dick could respond.
“You should go,” Cas looks down at his feet, his cheeks flushed. Dean feels like he’s been punched. This was a mistake.
“I’m officially declaring this place B.L.U. Headquarters,” Castiel says when Dean finishes. Dean tries not to laugh. His neighbor can be so extra sometimes. “Well except for when my mom uses it to host her yoga group.”
Adding a note cause I made a slight tweak to an earlier chapter. I was thinking about when their birthdays would be. Dean's is obviously January 24, but I decided to make Castiel's birthday the same as Misha's, August 20th. That means Castiel in this story has already turned 17. Dean is 16, so he's a half year younger.
Dean thinks about it.
This time Blue groaned and pressed the length of his body into Dean. He kissed him back with a bit more force this time, and Dean let him lead since he didn’t know what he was doing. All he knew was that it felt incredible. Dean felt Blue’s tongue at the seam of his lips, and he opened up for him. When Blue’s tongue wrapped around his own Dean let out his first moan, and Blue captured it eagerly with another kiss. Blue’s tongue continued to explore the inside of his mouth, and the sensation lit a fire in his groin. He felt himself starting to get hard, and when Blue pressed his body into him again he could tell he was just as turned on. Dean had a couple of wet dreams before, but he’d never taken things into his own hands while awake. Back on the farm, survival was their only priority, and there was no time or desire to partake in the pleasures of the flesh. Of course, if Dean had known it would feel like this, he would’ve tried it out ages ago!
“Ah so you’re into Leia
After their standard prayer is finished, the household staff files out of the room followed by Abbadon. She sends one lingering look towards her husband before she leaves. Dean’s nerves accelerate now that he’s alone with the Commander again.
<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>
“Have fun!” Dean said cheerily. He and Benny waved as the car pulled out of the driveway, and then Benny turned to him with a smirk on his face.
Castiel and Dean have been staring at these CDs for what feels like days, but he knows it’s probably only been about an hour. Dean is humming something under his breath, and he keeps mentioning that it’s too bad Svenson is a psychopathic killer because he has a “good taste for the classics.” Castiel doesn’t recognize most of these bands, but he’ll take Dean’s word for it.
“Crowley, I don’t know if…“ He starts, but Crowley interrupts him.
“Us?” Dean asked, his eyes narrowing.
“Yes, but I don’t want anyone else to see you like this,” Dean explains.
number on the RSVP so they know to call
“I think you can’t be two people at once,” Gabriel says. Sometimes his brother can be the crudest and most obnoxious person in the room, but other times, like right now, he can be really profound. He’s right. Castiel can’t be two people at once, but compartmentalizing is different from dissociating.
“The woman standing next to the unsub is his psychiatrist,” Dean fills them in. “She was supposed to be taking him to a conference to show off her successful treatment techniques for severe psychosis.”
The joy is short-lived though, because it only takes a second for Dean to remember where he’s seen this bomb before. “Fuck, I know this bomb,” he says quietly. “The guy who made it is doing life in federal prison.” Charlie’s face drops to mirror his own. Both of them know exactly what is left unsaid. For the first time today, Dean wishes Castiel had stayed behind with him back in D.C. instead of flying out to Miami.
Once the Jeep in front of them stops, the two of them draw their weapons and get out of the car to approach the suspect. “FBI, put both of your hands out the window!” Jo yells. The man in the car puts both of his hands out of the window immediately, and Castiel breathes a sigh of relief when he sees that both hands are empty. The two of them start approaching the car but keep their guns raised. “Now, I want you to slowly open the car door from the outside,” Jo says firmly.
He takes as many lung-fulls of crisp autumn air as he can in the short distance down the sidewalk to where the car is parked. Castiel opens the back door for him, and he gets into the car immediately resting back against the plush seat. He looks up when Castiel gets into the driver’s seat. Mistress Abbadon opens the passenger side door and for a horrifying second Dean thinks she’s planning on accompanying them to the hospital. She just reaches inside the door to raise the partition up between Castiel and the backseat.
, Castiel thought to himself. Alistair continued, “Since I don’t have any new recruits at the moment, I’ll take your new one, Blue.”
Dean plants a fake smile on his face in response. “Where are you going?” He asks, trying to steer the subject back into calmer waters.
“No actual punches,” Castiel said. “We don’t want to injure each other before going on a multi-day trek across the wasteland.”
Sorry this was a bit of a slow chapter. Next chapter will be in Castiel's POV so we can start seeing what he's thinking
. The fact that this man who looked to be about his size, maybe a couple inches taller but also a few years younger, was strong enough to pick him up and carry him was incredibly hot.
“It’s okay,” Dean smiled. It looked like he’d been staring at Castiel’s lips before speaking, but that could've been wishful thinking. “I’m guessing that I have a high pain tolerance.” Castiel was pretty sure he was right about that, but Dean still winced when he started stitching him up with the supplies they had. It was messy, but it got the job done.
Castiel’s face hardens. “What reason would I have to be jealous? She’s just a boring jock. You guys are perfect for each other.”
By the time he gets into the house, his cloak is soaked through from the rain. He sits down on the bench in the casual dining room meant for the ‘help’. It’s adjacent to the kitchen, and Dean can see Benny working on something in there. He hears footsteps and sees Castiel walking towards him. He pulls off his blinders and gets up to hang up his drenched cloak when Castiel enters the room.
As far as the finale goes I'm not posting spoilers because I'm not sure if everyone has seen it, but I think I'm okay with it. At first I was very mad, but basically where I stand is that I think the ending for each character was what I wanted. How they got there was a fucking mess though. So I liked the ending, but not the finale if that makes sense. I think a lot of it can be blamed on COVID and them not being able to bring certain people back or being forced to change things, but overall I'm fine with it. Very emotional, but fine. I've adored this show for a decade, and that doesn't change now just cause it's over
One police car was right on his tail, sirens blaring, as he came up to a red light. He drove straight through it and saw Cas holding onto his armrests with white knuckles out of his peripheral vision. He heard a few honks as he passed through the intersection and breathed a sigh of relief that the cop car was a bit further back now. Unfortunately, another two cars had joined in on the pursuit.
“I’m just lucky she didn’t decide to gut me while I was unconscious,” Dean sighs. He’s still feeling ashamed about fucking up that majorly. It’s not like him to make mistakes on the job like that. “I had my back turned like an idiot.”
“It’s not a required field so not everyone filled it out,” Sam says.
“No,” Castiel responds calmly. “I’m just asking you to let us handle Gadreel.”
“Your seven minutes is up. It’s our turn.” That’s Gabriel’s voice. They must’ve gone a full five rounds without them in the time they were in the bathroom. Dean raises his eyebrows at him as if to ask if he’s okay. Castiel takes one last look in the mirror. He still looks like a mess, but there’s not much he can do about that now. He nods, and Dean opens up the door to let Gabriel in with Kali. Crowley is not going to be happy about that.
“But he said if anyone follows Alfie he’s going to kill Matt,” Larry Pike says frantically.
“Could you scoot over?” Castiel gave him a little shove, but Gabriel just shimmied his ass a little bit as a joke. He always had to be so obnoxious.
Dean spent the next couple days recovering and tending to the crops with Sam. John had run off again to wherever he went when he was hunting down the raiders. He left in the middle of the night after he'd talked to Dean and didn’t even tell Bobby where he was going. Bobby and Sam were both angry at John for taking off like that, but Dean was just upset. He couldn't help but feel like this was all his fault somehow.
“I just didn’t want to make a fool of myself in front of a cute girl during my first game,” he winks at her and she blushes.
of you very happy.” Crowley and Gabriel shoot glares at each other, and Castiel wants to bang his head repeatedly against the cafeteria table. He is so tired of this constant fighting between the two of them.
“Okay guys,” Castiel started, “We’re going to the Red Rocket truck stop today. I’m not sure if we’ll find anything, but we might as well check it out.” He could hear Zachariah snort behind him. “Unless you want to go back inside and be stuck on guard duty.”
As he’s about to open the wrought iron gate to the driveway, three black Guardian vans speed past on the street. He wonders if they’re heading to clean up the mess at the market or if something else happened. He can’t help the image that comes into his head of Castiel driving one of those cars. Dean wants to believe he’s different than the rest of them. Maybe he’s doing what he has to do to survive the same way Dean is. Maybe he’s trying to dismantle the system from the inside.
“No,” Castiel says again.
“Wait,” Castiel commands. “Don’t tell anyone. Not yet. Let me think.” The other boys exchange looks but don’t say anything. “We need to stay still, crouching in the weeds until the time is right to pounce.”
Castiel uses the distraction to escape into the crowd of people. He doesn’t want to run into anyone from school in case he starts crying. He keeps wiping his eyes, frustrated to find liquid there every time he does. How can he stop himself from crying though? His worst fears have come true. His friend group has imploded, and he’s stuck at the mall without a credit card.
“I’d love that!” She says, and he exhales in relief. “Maybe we can try for next Saturday?”
“Castiel hosts a sleepover every Friday, and I’d like you to come tonight if you don’t already have plans.” She smiled encouragingly at him.
“Is that for you?” Castiel asked, meaning the sirens.
Dean splashed some water on his face and tried to control himself. This was fine. Everything was fine.
“Well you got most of it,” Charlie pats him on the back. “I give you a B+.”
Dean quickly lunged forward and kissed his unsuspecting lips. “That’s perfect, Cas! Now, tell me where I parked it.”
Dean used to take them every morning while they were together. Castiel never asked what they were for, because he’d figured if Dean refused to tell him about his job, he definitely wouldn’t tell him about his medical history.
“I don’t know,” he sighed. “You’re the expert here.”
“Is this a secure line?” Charlie asked in a hushed tone.
Castiel looks over towards Dean, making eye-contact directly with him for the first time since their disastrous Thanksgiving dinner. He expects Dean to look scared or nervous, but he doesn’t. The green-eyed boy stares evenly back at him without betraying any emotion, except for maybe anger.
“Yeah?” His voice came out strained.
“Did what?” Dean tried to look over his shoulder at his back, but he couldn’t see the full extent of it. “Shit,” he gasped. “What the hell?”
“And don’t leave anything out,” Balthazar says.
“That’s what feels wrong about this?”
“Fuck, Dean,” Blue moaned. “Where the hell did you learn how to do that?” Dean didn’t respond, he just continued his assault on Blue’s neck. He wished he could leave a mark, but he knew he couldn’t. It wasn't like Blue belonged to him or anything. Though the thought of him walking around with a hickey that Dean left there made his dick twitch in his pants. Dean brought his lips back to Blue’s, and they started kissing frantically again. The intensity continued to ratchet up until he felt like he was about to explode. Blue pressed into him again, and they both moaned when their groins connected.
“See this is the problem with having girls at the party. If it was just boys you wouldn’t care. You’d be dancing already,” Benny says.
“So much for not spreading panic,” Gabriel mumbles. Just then there’s a fourth explosion in the street right behind where the live coverage is being filmed. Everyone in the room grows silent until Gabriel speaks up again. “I guess we’re going to Miami. I want everyone at the airstrip in fifteen minutes.”
Right as he has that thought Charlie opens the door holding a big silver box. “I come bearing gifts.”
Castiel felt so out of it. It was hard to make sense of what was happening in this dream. He thought Dean must've been one of his neighbors because he recognized him. He just didn't know where from.
The reason Castiel is being such a grump is because he can’t deny it anymore. The way he felt when he saw Dean interacting with Lisa was obvious. It’s the exact same feeling he has when he thinks about how Crowley is hanging out more with Brady than with him. Jealousy. Not jealousy over Dean getting along with the girl he thought he was crushing on, but jealousy towards Lisa. It's like getting a bucket of ice water dumped on his head. He doesn’t have a crush on Lisa, and he didn’t have a crush on Anna, because he isn’t attracted to girls. He’s attracted to boys. More specifically, he’s attracted to Dean.
“They’re called The Institute,” Bobby’s voice drops to a whisper. “I always assumed it was an urban legend. I’ve met people fleeing from Diamond City saying that their neighbor got kidnapped by The Institute. Again, I just thought they were in the chems, but maybe they were telling the truth.”
“Since a couple days after I woke up.”
Dean hated that Cas had so little trust in him, but after the story he’d heard last night, he couldn’t blame him. His past-self had really been a dick. He quickly moved forward to sit on the edge of the bed. “I’m right here,” he said softly. Cas’s breaths were still hitched and panicked. “Come here.” He gently pulled Cas towards him until they were holding each other in an awkward hug. The way they were sitting on the bed wasn’t the most conducive to hugging.
“It’s okay,” Dean says. “You’re among friends.” Castiel can tell he’s making a joke to lighten the mood, but he appreciates it.
Castiel gets hit in his upper arm, and he slumps down onto the pier. He motions to Jo that he’s alright, and she quickly runs over to Jesperson to kick his gun away and untie Ashley Frank from her bindings. Castiel hears sirens pull up behind them and relaxes a bit further onto the pier now that he knows their backup has arrived.
He'd spent the vast majority of his life outside. Their farm had a living area on the ground floor and then a place for mattresses in the loft above it, but usually the only time they'd spent inside was during the night or during a storm. Other than that Dean had been outside hunting, working in the field, or standing guard. This was the longest period of time he'd spent indoors without windows in as long as he could remember. He needed to leave this room today. He didn’t care what it took. He couldn’t stand another minute being cooped up in here.
When they got to their box, the bouncer brought in a tray full of food and a pitcher of beer. “Enjoy the fight,” he said and left with a small bow. Blue sat down in one of the theater seats, and Dean sat down in the other one. The seats were directly next to each other so their legs were touching. It was the first time that Dean felt uncomfortable about their closeness.
Dean looked down guiltily because he wasn't wrong. “That’s what I was trying to apologize for if you’d let me finish,” he muttered. When he looked back up, he could see a slight pink tinge on Castiel’s cheeks as if he was embarrassed for snapping at him even though he deserved it. “I didn’t want to admit it, but I was jealous that you got the promotion over me,” Dean said. “I’m sorry for judging you, and I’m sorry for being an ass.”
He would give almost anything to be able to Dom a willing, but somewhat bratty submissive right now. An attractive face with green eyes and a smattering of freckles pops into his head, unbidden, and he flinches. Not only is it entirely inappropriate for him to have sexual thoughts about one of the agents in his charge, but it’s especially inappropriate for him to have those thoughts about the agent who most likely hates him. As much as Castiel is physically attracted to Dean, he knows that Dean is the complete opposite of a submissive. He’s also most likely straight because Castiel can’t seem to be attracted to any men who
“Did you ever study German?” He tries his best to keep his voice light.
Once he’s on the first floor, he opens the back door and steps out into the courtyard. The crisp night air helps to ground him, and he puts his hands on his knees while he tries to calm down his breathing. After a few minutes his heart rate finally begins to slow, and he can feel himself coming back to reality. He stands up straight, and his heart stops for a second.
“You’re right,” Castiel says, his voice betraying no emotion. “And if we do nothing, everyone will die.”
“Good morning, Dean,” Castiel says. He’s not smiling, but Dean does notice a slight upturn in his mouth. At first when Castiel joined the team Dean thought he was pretty robotic. It’s only been about a week, but he’s already starting to pick up on the tiny nuances in Castiel’s facial expressions. It’s something a normal person probably wouldn’t notice, but he’s trained to notice nonverbal expressions and subtle behavioral cues.
“I will call Alfie on a cell-phone as he drives to give him directions on where to go for the drop. He must make the drop at three am exactly. He must follow each instruction to the letter or Matt dies.” The voice hangs up the phone without giving anyone time to reply. There’s a moment of silence while the team processes this information and tries to decide how to proceed. Alfie and Larry Pike look around at the different agents nervously.
“I’ve got it,” Castiel exclaimed. “Loser has to wear my old snow outfit to school for a week. That includes goggles, ski mask, gloves, and hat.”
“You what?” Dean asked. “How?”
Charlie grabbed his arm to stop him. “Just wait here. I’m going to go ask them.” She nodded her head over towards where a couple Guardians were standing on the train platform waiting for the next train to come in. Dean’s heartrate started picking up again, and he pulled on her cloak to stop her. “It’s fine,” Charlie smiled at him. “I’m an Aunt.”
Friday, November 13
Castiel must think the same thing because he takes a deep breath and gently hands the ice to Dean before walking towards the door. He stops at the door and turns back around looking like he’s about to say something, but he just sighs and leaves the bedroom closing the door behind him.
He looks up when he hears Castiel’s work boots on the wood floors that lead to the kitchen. The driver looks good today. Even better than usual. There’s a redness to his cheeks which makes Dean wonder if it’s cold outside. Or maybe he’s blushing about something.
Castiel keeps his eyes on Dean while he licks a long stripe up his rapidly filling cock. Dean throws his head back against the pillow and barely stifles a moan. The Alpha pulls back but continues slowly jacking him off to full hardness. “You don’t have to be quiet or act like anything you’re not with me,” he says. “You can be yourself.”
“Single forever,” Dean answered quickly, and Castiel couldn't decide if he found his honesty brave or stupid.
“Charlie…” Dean warns.
“Hurry!” Crowley hissed. “My mom will freak if she walks in to people standing barefoot on her precious counter-tops.”
The office was a flurry of activity when Sam entered it. Everyone, or at least everyone in their unit, had apparently been made aware of the situation. He shot a concerned look towards Charlie, but she immediately turned away. Sam got it. Dean was a traitor, and right now they were working to bring him to justice. If Charlie or Sam acted too friendly or seemed in any way opposed to the idea of taking Dean out, it could be bad for them too. It was going to be a tricky situation. He just knew that he had to find a way to help his brother, even if it put himself in danger.
“It is over,” Castiel says.
Later that night as Dean was filling out all of the invitations, he did exactly as he was told. Except he spelled his name
Castiel is really fooling himself if he thinks he'll be able to keep his hands off of Dean for long ;)
“What’s that?” Cas asked as he stepped closer to look over his shoulder.
“I’m Anna Milton, by the way." She smiled and waved at him.
“Did you know she was a gender-traitor?” Aunt Naomi asks. Dean feels his anger beginning to overtake his fear. Yes, he knew Jo was bisexual, just like he is bisexual. They are not abominations or ‘traitors’ to be exterminated or sent to The Empty. They are people.
Tuesday, September 8
“What?”
“Hey,” Dean echoed right on cue.
10:40am
Castiel walks over towards where Dean is sitting at the kitchen table trying to get a good look at the spot where he was tazed. Unfortunately it’s on his hip closer to his back which makes it hard for him to reach. “Do you need help with that?” Castiel asks as he approaches.
,” Cas moans, and the sound shoots straight to his dick.
wife. Dean needs to remember that he’s married and stop fantasizing about him or whatever it is he’s been doing. What he really needs is to get laid. Maybe that would help him stop thinking about blue eyes and dark, messy hair.
Nothing about this is alright, but Castiel nods as he sips his water.
Dean pulls away to look at him in shock. Maybe if the word gets out what’s happening down here some other countries will help what’s left of the United States take back control of the country. He feels something resembling hope begin to bloom in his chest, and he has to quickly squash it. Hope only leads to disappointment.
Bela looks over her shoulder towards the produce section. “She’s back.” Dean follows her gaze and freezes when he sees Jo shopping by herself. She’s wearing her usual omega uniform, so that means she must’ve been posted to a new house. She probably felt them staring at her, because she looks up at them for a second before going back to her shopping. From that short glance, Dean can tell that she’s changed. Her eyes look haunted.
Dean mouths to himself.
“Dean Corll is the Candy Man killer right?” Dean asks. That case happened back in the seventies. The Candy Man operated out of Houston, Texas, and between 1970 and 1973 he raped, tortured, and murdered at least twenty-eight teenagers and young men.
Castiel tried to keep his face blank, so he wouldn’t betray how weird he found this whole situation. Twenty-seven years of Dean’s life, gone. On one hand that was terrifying, but on the other, it meant Dean got a completely fresh start. Once they found a way out of this mess and figured out why people were trying to kill him, maybe then they could start over together.
“I don’t see him,” the officer said into his radio. His voice was way too close to them, and it made the omega jump. After another panic-inducing moment, the man finally walked away. The omega waited until he couldn’t hear his footsteps anymore to start running again. That little break gave him enough rest to start back up again.
“You sound like Sam,” Charlie sighed. “I love Dean too, but look at the evidence here. We’re talking thousands of dollars in damages, a body in the streets, seven people in the hospital, and that’s not even mentioning the potential for someone in Lucifer’s crew to release the information he’d gathered even though he’s dead.”
angle,” Sam emphasized. They’ve watched this footage multiple times now. Dean definitely didn’t leave by the back exit.
Dean shakes his head. “It was somebody.” They have no idea what the man had done of course, but it could’ve been anything. The list of infractions worthy of being taken by the Guardians is so long, it’s easier to say what they’re actually
“Sam—” Charlie started, but he hung up before she had a chance to finish her sentence.
“Alrighty folks,” Naomi continued. “First item up for bid is this five-speed massage chair. We’ll start the bidding at $500.”
“Pardon?” Blue asked.
Castiel pushes himself up from his seat to throw away his trash. Balthazar and Gabriel follow quickly behind him. “Is it safe to assume you guys are going to work for my campaign instead of Crowley’s?” Castiel tries to keep his voice from sounding nervous, but he also doesn’t know how his friends feel about the fight that’s brewing between himself and Crowley.
3:20pm
Part of his brain tries to remind him that Castiel is a Guardian. He’s part of the secret police. Out of everyone in this house, Cas is probably the person he should trust the least. The other side of his brain tells him that Cas has had multiple chances to report multiple people in this house, and he hasn’t. He’s not like other Guardians.
“Castiel, is it true that Abbadon planned your party?” Ash Harvelle asks.
Jo spoke up, “Manual strangulation is a lot more difficult than people think. He probably tried to use just his bare hands but found out that it took too long so he resorted to using the knife.”
“Yes, please,” he says so quietly Dean can barely hear him. He can’t believe his luck! This is not what he was expecting when he got that text from Cas a few minutes ago.
“I understand that,” Castiel says. “My wife is very understanding when it comes to the demands of the job, but she does still worry. It’s kind of hard not to with what we do.” He shoots Jo a small smile which she returns.
They’d tried to claim that Dean Michael Cain had died and even got a body to ‘prove’ it, but apparently, they weren’t as clever as they thought they were. Lucifer went to the morgue, somehow convinced them to let him examine the body, and must’ve found something to prove that it wasn’t the same person who tried to kill him. That person being Dean. They all knew it was only a matter of time before Lucifer went to the press again with proof that the C.I.A. tried to assassinate him. They couldn't let that happen.
Dean stayed out on the porch not moving at all as the sun set and it got dark. Thankfully Sam was over at a friend’s house tonight, so he didn’t have to witness any of this. It was embarrassing enough that Castiel heard some of it. He already thought Dean and his family were poor, country bumpkins. Might as well add alcoholic and abusive to the list.
Alistair’s hand stops in mid-air for a second before it continues putting away the poker chips. “Where did you hear that?”
Two Neiman Marcus salesmen are fussing over Castiel, Gabriel, and Balthazar trying to get their measurements so they can find pieces that fit them properly. Between Thanksgiving tomorrow and then Christmas and New Years coming up, Castiel is in desperate need of some new outfits. They also need to find outfits to wear for the photoshoot they’ll be doing in Bangor.
“Thank you,” Castiel's voice is full of emotion. He barely knows these people, but it means a lot that they’d be willing to help out a complete stranger. He figures he should return the favor. “There’s a place not far from here that I think would make for a good settlement,” he says.
They flagged down a taxi and gave the driver the address to the morgue. It only took a few minutes to get there. Before the car fully stopped, Dean opened the door and stepped out, pulling Castiel with him. The office was closing when they got there, but Dean was able to bribe the technician with some of the money he’d found in his deposit box.
“Fancy-pants!” Bela says enviously. “Nice house, I bet.”
“Can we do crop tops?” Balthazar asks.
“You said it translates to ‘good appetite’,” Dean said. “Translates from what?”
Benny thought for a moment. “Do you have any video games?”
“Can I help you find anything?” One of the salesmen comes over to them.
“Offer her a test drive,” Castiel said, impressed by Dean’s logic. He might act like Sam was the smart one in the family, but Dean was clearly intelligent as well.
“I thought you were going to teach Kali how to bake tonight,” Crowley glares at Gabriel.
“What is going on? You’ve been on edge ever since we met up with Alfie and his body guards.” Dean can tell that Castiel doesn’t want to respond, but Dean needs him to. They need to be able to work with this family if they’re going to have any hope of finding Matt. Then it hits him. “Is this seriously about what happened at the crime scene?” Dean asks, insulted. “Do you think Alfie is crazy because he says he can feel that his brother is still alive?”
“Well, I already gave you my number,” the woman flirted in French, gesturing to the tickets and winking again. “Call me.” Dean looked down at the tickets and noticed there was a scrap of paper with a hastily-written phone number on it.
“Have you noticed anything odd over the past couple days since your sister has been missing?” Castiel asked to get them back on track.
Castiel can feel her looking towards him from the backseat, but he doesn’t say anything as he starts to pull out of the Abels’ ridiculously large driveway. After they’ve driven a few blocks in complete silence, he hears Ofal’s soft voice come from behind him. “Have you seen the Abels’ baby? She’s really cute.” Castiel feels like there’s a knife in his lung, making it hard to breathe. He’s not sure what his voice would sound like if he were to reply, so he stays quiet. “I love pups,” Ofal says, and Castiel glances in the rearview mirror to see that she’s turned away from him and is staring out of the window.
How could he make Cas understand?
Castiel quickly checks his messages. “Yes! We are going to be models!” He runs over to Dean and hugs him, even going so far as to pick him up and swing him around in a surprising show of strength. When Castiel puts him back down, Dean tries to hide how flustered he is by taking another sip of his water.
Dick tapped his finger against his leg for a few seconds before speaking again. Sam felt like he was watching the tennis final at Wimbledon. Both of them were rallying back and forth, testing out each other’s weaknesses before one of them went in for the winning shot.
As he walked up the gravel driveway in between the guest house and the main house, Dean could see the lights on in the living room. He felt a wave of nervous butterflies in his chest and almost turned around and walked back to the guest house. He couldn't remember the last time he’d been to an actual sleepover. He didn’t know boys in high school still did that. He knew in his gut that Castiel had nothing to do with inviting him to this sleepover. For some reason he couldn't understand, Naomi was doing her best to foster this unlikely friendship between the two of them. Maybe she was aware of how territorial Castiel could get and didn't want any teenage turf wars on her property.
When he gets back inside the house, he’s immediately confronted by Gabriel. “Are you okay?” Gabriel asks, concern etched all over his face. Castiel is getting really tired of everyone handling him with kid gloves. His psychiatric evaluation cleared him for field work, and Gabriel had practically begged him to come here. So why is he suddenly questioning Castiel’s ability to do the job?
“From the beginning,” Castiel says. “What do we know about bombers?”
“I can see you watching me,” Castiel says without turning his head. Dean blushes at being caught staring.
The older man steps forward into his personal space until he’s only about a foot away from him. Dean wishes again that the household staff wasn’t forced to wear scent blockers because he wants nothing more than to be able to finally scent him.
“Would you like to try one out on each other?” Dean asks with a completely straight face. “Just to get a hang of how long it should last.” Castiel thinks he can’t possibly have heard that correctly, but he replays it in his mind and realizes that he had. He’s not sure what look is on his face, but whatever it is causes something to flash across Dean’s face in response. Then he’s laughing, “I’m just kidding, Cas, jeez.”
“That is one of the more common delusions,” Sam agrees. “Many paranoid psychotics think they’re being spied on by the government.”
<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>
“I can see that,” Benny was still chuckling. “He just about tore my head off before he left.” Dean found it hilarious that Blue constantly called him 'kid' when he was the one acting like a child. It was one thing to be unnecessarily rude to him, but he shouldn’t be taking his anger out on Benny. He didn't deserve that.
Alfie unmutes the mic. “This is Alfie,” he says quietly.
Synths and the Institute were the basis of many urban legends kids told to scare each other. Synths were basically androids that were made in Institute factories. The purpose and existence of these synths was widely contested throughout the Wasteland. Some people believed that there were synths who were so developed that they were indistinguishable from humans. Those people thought that the goal of the Institute was to replace humans with identical synths without people knowing so that they could slowly take over.
. He’d wondered if his father was homophobic based on little comments he’d made here and there, but he’s never said it so blatantly before. This is why Dean hasn’t come out to him yet.
As much as his neighbor infuriates and confuses him, Dean is impressed at how he seems to have the entire class wrapped around his long, delicate fingers. Not that Dean has been paying attention to Castiel’s hands or daydreaming about what those hands could do. That would be absurd.
Dean pulled the car into the parking garage and parked it on the bottom floor. After it was parked, they both took a few moments to catch their breaths. He could feel Cas’s eyes looking at him like he was some sort of freak, and Dean guessed he must be. Normal people didn't do shit like that, right?
“I’m telling you,” Lucifer said angrily. “Everything I’m saying is the truth. These people have threatened me and my children. We are in the process of gathering evidence right now, and when it comes to light you can trust that I will share it with the whole world.” He turned to look directly at the camera. “And the people who have done this to me will be the ones in trouble then. If they tried to do this after I’ve tried to work with them, there’s no telling what they’ll do next.”
His only option was to move forward and hope he could find some place to hide. He couldn't explain it, but something in his gut was telling him that he couldn't get caught. There was a feeling or a memory struggling to break loose. Until it did, all Dean could do was follow his instincts, and his instincts were telling him to run and hide. He turned another corner and heard more sirens approaching. This time it was definitely police cars. It might not be for him, but it also could be the backup the guys following him called in. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the American flag on a building one block away. That had to be the American Embassy. If he could make it to that building, he’d be safe. Dean pulled out his U.S. passport as he jogged towards the embassy. He showed it to the soldier guarding the door just as the police car stopped outside and yelled for him to stop.
Sam leans in closer. “They’re identical. Same materials, same structure.”
Maybe he’s a Guardian.
Castiel rolls his eyes at his half-brother. “In a sense,” he replies in that deep voice of his.
“Talk to me,” Castiel sat down on one of the chairs facing the unlit fireplace. The Novak living room was as extravagant as the rest of the house, but it was still cozy. Naomi spent a lot of her free time working on interior decorating and keeping the house up to date with the current styles. It seemed like there was always some sort of construction or renovation project happening on the property.
As Dean walks back to his friends he wonders if anything is worth this kind of trouble.
“I was telling Abaddon I had an idea that we could go as angels and demons,” Castiel explained to Dean. “I’m going to be an angel, so I figured you could be a demon.” Dean didn't know if Castiel was actually planning on including him originally or if he was just offering it now because he could tell he was annoyed. Either way, it didn't really matter. Dean was happy to be included at this point. “I love the Heaven and Hell idea, Abaddon,” Castiel turned to face her.
Dean eats his morning oatmeal mechanically. It tastes like shit, but he’ll take food however he can get it. Benny is doing dishes while Dean eats at the kitchen island. He’s started coming down for breakfast a bit later in the morning because it means he’s able to avoid the Rolstons’. They eat a bit earlier in the fancy dining room before the Commander has to leave for work.
Benny stares at him for a moment, probably trying to decide whether or not he is being genuine. “I won’t, but be careful. You know she has more to risk than you do.”
“I’m not,” Brady blushes and continues to awkwardly giggle.
“I’m tired of him looking down on me,” Dean whispered into the phone.
“Well obviously you haven’t seen me try.” Castiel picked up his bag and briskly walked to his next class, leaving Dean behind him.
“If it starts going too far let me know, and I’ll handle it,” Azazel promises. Castiel hopes it doesn’t come to that. He doesn’t want to know what Azazel ‘handling it’ might look like. “How close is she to her shopping partner?”
“It’s a sign of remorse,” Castiel explained as if he was a rookie.
“I heard you and Castiel are co-hosting it,” Anna glanced in the rear-view mirror and shared a loaded look with Benny. Dean rolled his eyes. He was so tired of the two of them and their obsession with his nonexistent love life.
“No,” Castiel says again, but then he looks up at Dean. “Dean.”
Dean shook his head. “No, we’ll just have to make a stop at Diamond City before we go to the Combat Zone. It’s near here right?”
Friday, September 25
“Yeah,” Cas is looking down at his shoes and blushing slightly, but at least he’s not visibly shaking anymore. “I’ll be honest… I don’t have any experience with this.”
“And you’ve never… not even once?”
“What’s going on here?” Zachariah asked.
“What’s it look like? Coming with you.” He replied as if it was obvious. He was wearing all black and posing like a ninja.
Castiel sighs, but looks at him with an expression that can only be described as fondness. “You are one strange omega,” he chuckles, and Dean blushes. He’s not sure if Castiel means it in a good way or not. They continue to pick up pieces of broken dishes in silence for a few moments. Every once in a while their hands accidentally touch, and each time it feels like a shock against his skin. “Want to hear something I just found out?” Castiel asks.
Dean runs all the way back to the guest house. This time he isn’t running because he’s afraid there’s someone lurking in the dark who will try to kidnap him, but because Castiel is finally being nice to him and Lisa has a secret crush. He has a feeling that he’s the one Lisa likes, and that makes him feel like running.
“You made me drop my scone, asshole,” Gabe grumbled.
“Nothing, I’m just,” She sighed, “He’s never done this before so I’m trying to figure out why.”
Dean can’t believe how thirty seconds of Cas’s voice can change his mood so drastically. He was crying not a minute ago, and now his cheeks are starting to hurt from smiling. There’s so much to unpack about the message, so he listens to it again… and again.
“I wouldn’t know, but I’ll take your word for it,” Castiel said in a bored tone while he tapped away at his phone. “Hope you don’t mind we have to make a few stops to pick up my friends.”
Cas nodded shakily, and Dean sighed lightly before leaning in and finally kissing those lips he’d been trying not to stare at for the last day. When their lips met, Dean was filled with a sense of
After a few seconds of that Charlie groans, “Fine. I’m going to go grab us some drinks.” She stands up. “Novak, do you want anything?”
Benny moved into her space and looked down at her. He didn't have any intention of hurting her, but he knew his size and his gaze could be intimidating. “Where is it?”
“We’re being set up,” Kevin says quietly. “There’s no other reason why he’d tell us to wait in the bathroom. This is a set up for a bad prank.”
Castiel was brought back to the present when he heard the hotel room door creak open. He hadn’t realized he’d started crying until he felt the wetness on his cheeks. He barely had a chance to be relieved before Dean opened up the bathroom door holding a flashlight. Castiel tried to wipe his eyes before Dean could notice he’d been crying, but it was too late.
“Protect the people at a minute’s notice,” Rufus explained. “That was the original idea anyways. I joined up because I wanted to make a difference, but then things fell apart. Now Bobby and I are the last Hunters left it seems.” Rufus gestured towards another man who appears to be about the same age as he was.
One of the officers put his baton on his shoulder. “Komm mit uns,” the policeman said harshly.
“The things the beta said sounded...” Castiel takes a deep breath before he continues, “Was Purgatory as bad as she’s saying it was?”
He stops pacing now that he’s made his decision. He picks up the phone and dials Lisa’s number.
“Dean and Novak were acting... intimate.”
At first Dean wants to dismiss him, but he really could use the help. “Please.” Castiel bends over to get a closer look at the wound, then he winces in sympathy. “It’s not as bad as it looks,” Dean says. It hurts, but he’s definitely had worse. Being shot is worse. Speaking of being shot, he wants to ask how Castiel’s arm is doing after being shot on his first case at the BAU. Or how his leg is healing after the incident in Chicago. He’s noticed that Castiel still walks with a bit of a limp though it probably wouldn’t be noticeable to the untrained eye. It’s only noticeable to Dean since he’s spent an embarrassing amount of time staring at his boss.
Castiel is loading boxes into the trunk of the Commander’s government issued Range Rover when he sees Ofal walk past him to meet up with her shopping partner. He’s heard about Ofmarv. He’ll need to find a chance to warn Ofal about getting too close to her. Already he overhears her greet Ofmarv like an old friend. The other omega is alert enough to see him watching them out of the corner of his eye and makes sure to use the standard greeting.
Bobby steps forward. “They’re people, or at least they were people,” he explains. “Some of them were around back when the bombs fell. The radiation rotted their brains and made them feral. Others are people from this time who were bitten by a ghoul. One bite is all it takes to turn you into one yourself, so watch out for them.”
After a couple more minutes, a shorter boy with a beard emerged from behind the gates. Dean caught a glimpse of the house when the boy opened the fence. It had to be at least twice as big as Castiel’s mansion, which was insane. This boy was also wearing a suit, but his overcoat was black instead of tan like Castiel’s.
“Do you want to see our suspect list?” The police chief asked Gabriel.
By the time the boys sift through the clothes that are available in the lost and found, the bell is ringing for passing period. They walk through the hallways to their next classes, and as usual they turn heads, but this time it’s for all the wrong reasons.
“Hey, man, I’m just glad it didn’t land on Brady,” Dean laughs. “He creeps me out.”
“I like the rain,” Ofmarv says, standing up and waiting for Dean to join her.
Later that evening after they’d been sent to bed, he had a quick whispered conversation with Charlie. It was the first time they were able to chat since he was brought here. They purposefully chose beds next to each other because all of the omegas sleep in the same big room. Routinely the women wearing brown or gray, betas apparently, would come check to make sure everyone was asleep. They have to time their hushed conversation around those bed checks.
“Dean,” Castiel pinches the bridge of his nose. “This yard is huge. Is it really that hard for you to find somewhere to go that isn’t all up on me?”
“Why should I have to cancel my plans to meet Dad’s freeloading friends when they’re going to be staying here for a while anyways? Surely there will be plenty of time to meet them later,” Castiel reasoned.
Blue chuckled at that. “This place gives me the creeps.” Dean was surprised to hear him say that. After all, he was living in it. “It’s almost all made of metal so it’s constantly creaking, and even though it’s huge, it almost feels claustrophobic inside. I wouldn’t be surprised if the place is haunted. It’s a relic from an older age. Feels wrong to be tramping around in it.”
“We need an ambulance,” Sam says.
“What the fuck!” Castiel hisses at him.
“No, Gabriel, you told me,” Balthazar chuckled.
and put a certain someone’s cell phone number on the bottom, with an extra note to “call anytime!” He knew this was going to set their friendship an extra five steps back, but he couldn't resist.
The teenager leaned down and kissed his forehead. “I’ll come back as soon as I can. You better not be dead when I get back!”
“I’m already grounded for like a month,” he sighs again. “I don’t want to turn that into two months.”
Crowley slapped a piece of fish on his back. “So does smoked salmon,” he laughed.
By the time Dean gets back to the Novak estate, he’s sweaty and exhausted. Coach Singer has been increasing their training since the season is about to officially start with their first game on Saturday. Dean’s finally been given a position on the squad. Bobby says he’d be a great attacking midfielder, which is the same position he played back in Kansas. It’s a comfortable role for him. Bobby also said they might need him to rotate in as a false number nine at times, and he’s cool with that too.
“Welcome to the club, Cassie!”
Crowley ignores him, leaning forward to talk to his driver. “Let’s go! We don’t want to be late for dinner in the city.”
“Uh, okay,” Castiel says.
Saturday, October 31
Castiel motioned for her to lead the way. They walked through the main area of the factory where people hundreds of years ago worked on manufacturing cars. There were staircases and walkways made of steel that lead to the room that they used for their command center. It had a good vantage point of the entire area as well as a few working computers that they used to control the turrets. There was really no reason to have working turrets inside of the building, but raiders were a suspicious bunch. In the unlikely case of one of the garrisons trying to mount an attack on the rest of them, the command center would give the leaders a place to defend themselves. The command center was also where they held all of their meetings and where Castiel would meet with the Boss and the other captains that evening. He hated these meetings, but it was better to be included and know what was happening than to be left in the dark.
I am so sorry it has been an age and a half since I've updated this! I am in graduate school now, so while I'm working on my classes I have limited time to write. I have a couple weeks off in between quarters so I'm going to try my best to get my fics updated :)
Dean rolled his eyes. “There’s nothing to tell.”
He almost jumps out of his skin when a firm hand clamps down on his shoulder. He lets out a childish squeak and hears his favorite laugh come from behind him. It’s Dean.
Dean answers the phone. “Pike residence,” he says sarcastically.
Dean sits down and bends over to take off his boots. When he raises back up, he accidentally pulls his dress up to reveal part of his thigh. He has a moment of panic before he remembers that he’s been required to shave since he went to Purgatory so he can stay ‘presentable.’ Dean notices Castiel’s eyes land on his exposed leg and then move up to meet his eyes. Dean holds eye contact with him, toying with him a little bit by pulling his dress slightly higher up his thigh and then smoothing it down to where it’s supposed to be.
“Here’s what I think,” Gadreel leans forward and crosses his hands on top of the table between them. “Sending those agents into the warehouse didn’t make any sense. You said it yourself, I display the homicidal triad. I even came from a broken home. I’m a textbook sociopath.” He laughs maniacally. “I may have given myself up to you, but I was still holding the remote. When I had the opportunity to kill six agents and a hostage, you should’ve known I would do it, no hesitation. The release I felt when I pushed that button,” he grins. “That was too good of an opportunity to pass up.”
They walked their horses up and down the beach several times, talking about anything and everything that crossed their minds. Throughout it all, Anna kept her hand in his. Occasionally he brushed his thumb back and forth the way he’d seen Dean do earlier, and he understood the appeal of that now. Her hand was surprisingly soft, and though it was smaller than he was expecting for some reason, it fit nicely in his.
At the edge of the city, there was part of an old highway up above them. There were a lot of those around the Wasteland, more relics of an earlier time. The shells of old cars littered those highways just like they littered the streets down on the ground. Underneath the highway was a collection of water. It almost looked like a small pond, but it was probably just there because it was a lower area, and Dean was assuming it’d rained recently.
(See the end of the chapter for
5:00pm
“Why would I bring them? Meg is my second.”
He tried his best to fight back, but Alistair was much stronger and was able to turn him around so his face was pressed into the wall. Dean can feel his breath hot on the back of his neck as he thrust his erection against him. Dean continued to kick and do whatever he could to try and get Alistair off of him, but it only seemed to spurn him on. Alistair bit down so hard on his neck that he might have broken skin, and that was when Dean began to cry.
Their train came suddenly, prompting a flurry of activity from commuters rushing to board and take the best seats. Dean stood back a bit until the rush had passed them. Then he stepped onto the train with his hand resting on the small of Cas’s back. He hoped his gentle touch would help calm him down a bit more. Either it was working or Cas was relieved that they’d actually made it onto the train without anyone spotting them, because he let out a sigh of relief.
“You are, Cas. I’m sorry,” Dean apologizes. “I just don’t get why you even care. I thought you’d be happy for me.” Castiel doesn’t respond, he just turns around to start cleaning up their painting supplies. Then it suddenly clicks. “Wait, are you jealous?” Dean asks.
Blue didn’t answer, he just turned off the cooking station and started cleaning up their empty bowls.
Dean knew they were probably going to start firing off rubber bullets into the crowd. That had been happening in other protests around the country and people on social media and in the news had been arguing about whether or not it was a proper way for these protests to be handled.
“I can’t believe this is the first time you’re telling anybody!” Gabriel exclaims.
“Nope.”
“Yes, I’m here to access my account,” he said quietly, looking around to see if anyone was paying attention to him. Everyone seemed to be going about their mornings without looking at him. That was a good sign.
Castiel knew that his initial attraction to Dean had grown into infatuation. He also knew that there was no way Dean would want a relationship with someone like him. This living situation was temporary, just until Castiel found a job, and then he’d be out of Dean’s life for good. He knew this, and still, he couldn't stop himself from falling a bit more every day.
“I was a mechanic,” he explains. “I worked at a car shop while my brother was going to law school.”
“No way,” Dean stepped back inside his room. “Wait, how’d you even know where I was going?”
“I’m sure he and Cassie will be able to work things out on their own,” Gabriel answers diplomatically. “Now go help your brother try to figure out Svenson’s password.”
“Woah, buddy,” a worried voice came from next to him. “Might want to take it easy on the sauce there.” Castiel wanted to ignore whoever it was, but he was intrigued by the stranger’s American accent. They were inside a tiny bar in a sketchier part of Paris. This wasn’t somewhere a tourist would find themselves. He wondered how this American ended up here.
“No, not since Purgatory.”
Dean continued without paying attention to him. “Don’t you want that feeling where you get giddy and nervous being in the same room as your crush, and you feel like you’ll spontaneously combust if they so much as look at you?” Dean tried and failed not to think of a specific person when he said that.
The boys at the table all groan at the thought of their fashion futures being reduced to a vote for the normally useless position of class president. Crowley was already in the running for president with Brady as his running mate. Castiel had been pissed when he found that out earlier today when he’d walked past a poster announcing their campaign on the wall. Even though they weren’t talking at the moment, Castiel still considers Crowley his best friend, and it hurts to see him not only choose
“Well she’s a bitch!” Claire laughs.
Crowley pulls out his phone and dials a number, putting the call on speaker. “Now, if you don’t mind, Cassie, we have a call to make.” The rest of the boys crowd around him to listen. Castiel knows he should probably leave, but he’s too curious to make his feet move. “Hey, Missouri!”
“Alright, everyone,” Bobby claps his hands together loudly and stands up. “I want you on the plane in fifteen minutes. Get your asses down to Texas!”
Fuck yeah, Dean is so on board with that plan. He leans in again, this time pressing into Cas with a bit more force. He tugs lightly at Cas’s hair because he can’t get enough of the feeling of it between his fingers. Cas lets out the smallest moan which sends Dean’s blood straight south. He has to control himself from pressing his body into him. He wants to feel Castiel’s lithe body against his, but he knows that would be taking things way further than a practice kiss warrants.
The sun was setting by the time Blue said they were getting close. The buildings here were closer together again. They were definitely in the heart of the city. The orange light from the setting sun caused the tall buildings to give off eerie shadows. Dean shivered a bit even though it wasn’t cold.
“We should grab some water here,” Blue said, putting down his pack to open it up and look for some of the containers they brought to hold water.
“If you say so,” she replies, but he can tell she doesn’t believe him. “Promise me you’ll stay safe.”
I’ve never understood it when fanfic writers say they’ve grown attached to their characters because I would just think “of course you’re attached to them, it’s Dean and Cas. We all love Dean and Cas.” But now after I’ve spent so much time writing this story, I think I get it. I have grown so attached to these guys, and I’m very happy that I have a lot more plans for this story so I won’t have to say goodbye to them any time soon.
“Lots of people have red hair,” Crowley replied, squinting through the bushes.
Dean sat down at a cafeteria table alone while he ate his lunch. He was tired of eating in the bathroom. It was disgusting, and someone kept taking nasty shits while he was sitting there. He looked over at Castiel’s table where the four boys were back together and very happy about it. Dean’s little plan had only lasted a couple days, and now he was back to being alone.
<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>
“You trust Ruby?” He asked her.
“Just because they live on the same property doesn’t mean they have to be joined at the hip,” John reasoned. “It’s only been what? A little over a month? They might need more time to adjust to each other. Like territorial cats.”
“Castiel,” Mrs. Rolston calls from the living room where she’s busy knitting. He sighs inaudibly before stepping into the room to see why she’s called him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Betas were usually responsible for the menial tasks in this new world. They did the cooking and the cleaning, and Alphas gave them a place to sleep in return. Their roles weren’t good by any means, but at least they weren’t sex slaves.
“What you don’t know,” Sam replies. “The unknown.”
The omegas all walk to the center of the town square and form a circle. The two Guardians bring forward the condemned man and throw him on the ground. “When I blow the whistle, what you do is up to you,” Aunt Naomi says, bringing the whistle to her lips. “Until I whistle again for you to stop.”
The man looked back down at the money in his hands and sighed audibly. “Get in."
Dean slumped back in his seat feeling like he’d been punched in the stomach. Maybe he just shouldn’t talk because he couldn't ever seem to say the right things. This year was going to be a nightmare.
“Truce,” Crowley agrees. The two of them vow to never let a girl come between them again, and Castiel can’t help but take a deep breath in relief. He hated watching two of his best friends constantly be at each other’s throats. He’s glad that for now at least the fighting is over.
Dean could hear Castiel talking at him, but he couldn't make out any of the words. He was frozen, staring at the picture of his past-self holding Cas. It was definitely him. Dean would've been able to recognize those blue eyes anywhere. They both looked a bit younger and maybe a bit more naïve. Dean was smiling in a way he didn't think he’d smiled since he woke up, and Cas was looking at him with unmistakable adoration in his eyes. The background of the picture looked like some sort of carnival or festival, but Dean wasn’t focused on the little details. He was focused on the expressions on both of their faces and the way they were holding each other. They looked like a couple in love.
Dessert is dessert, except here it has to mean something. What it means is the question. “It looks delicious,” Dean says, his voice shaking.
“And my heart leaps with joy,” Ofmarv responds enthusiastically. He rolls his eyes at her over-the-top enthusiasm since she can’t see him under his blinders. “I heard that the war is going well.”
“Grouch!” Gabriel shouts with his mouth full of food.
He feels nauseous.
Maybe Dean didn’t regret taking him home. “But I want to,” Castiel complained. He realized he must sound like a child right now, but he didn't care.
The man pulled a tiny knife out from inside his shoe, and Castiel must've seen it because he shouted, “Dean!” The intruder slashed towards him, but he ducked out of the way and was able to land two more blows. The man spat blood out of his mouth, but he kept coming at him. Apparently, he wasn't going to stop until either one or both of them were dead.
Dean looked up at him again. “Then what is your name?”
“So, Castiel, it’s been a while since I’ve seen you,” Azazel says. “How is the new omega?”
“Just wait there,” Sam said again.
The two of them finish patching Dean up, and Castiel checks his phone. It’s almost 8:30. He has to get back to the house for his nightly walk with his dad or he’ll get suspicious. He helps Dean back to the guest house, and once he’s safely inside he rushes back to his own house to get ready for their walk. The entire time his mind is racing with possibilities. He knows he shouldn’t get his hopes up, but it’s hard not to. Dean likes boys. Maybe Castiel does have a shot.
. It was getting on his nerves!
“I lie to him a lot,” Dean hissed. “The problem is there’s a difference between your dad getting mad at you when he catches you in a lie, and my dad getting mad at me. Got it?” Castiel’s quick pace stuttered for a second as he remembered the time he heard Dean’s dad drunkenly yelling at him. He was surprised Dean had brought it up so casually, but maybe it was because he was stressed.
“You really think I’d leave you here to die?” Dean asked, offended.
“Thank you,” Blue said and gently tugged on Dean’s jacket to get him moving again. They walked past the scavengers without any problems, and Dean let out a sigh of relief once they were out of range of them.
“I swear it wasn’t!” Brady’s eyes are wide. “My phone is in my dad’s BMW.” Principal Richings glares at him anyways.
Dean wasn't quite sure what he meant by the question, but he said, “Yes, I am.”
“Dean, I’m sorry,” Castiel says quietly.
“Where are you with the website users?” Castiel asks, his voice a bit hoarse.
He felt Castiel turn to look at him, and then he must've noticed that they were heading full speed towards a flight of stairs going down at the end of the alley. Cas started screaming and didn't stop until they’d crashed and bounced down to the bottom. Dean wasn't sure how, but the tires were somehow still all functioning. He put the car in drive again from where he’d switched it to a lower gear, and he was able to drive back onto the street. The only sign of anything wrong with the car was the metallic thud as it lost its back bumper.
Later that evening, he sits in his closet staring at the carving on the wall. It’s become his go-to spot when he needs to think. Tonight he thinks about Jo. Even though she got taken away in the van, the Guardians hadn’t managed to take everything from her. She still had a spark in her eyes, something inside her that they couldn’t put out. She looked invincible.
“Should I read it out loud?” Dean asks.
Dean stops mid-step and turns around. “You think?” The idea that the Alpha is calling the ritualistic rape of omegas once a month impersonal borders on hilarious.
scared. Hell, I’m scared.”
“It’s going to be okay,” Charlie repeated. “The doctors are saying getting pregnant is the hard part. You’ll be fine!”
“Like I almost died but was brought back to life by a stubborn kid named Dean,” Castiel said with a small smile. “Thank you,” he added sincerely. “You easily could’ve left me here and gone back to your family, but you stayed. That means a lot.” Castiel coughed a bit as if that would help to clear the awkwardness he felt in his chest.
“No!” Andrew May shouts through the phone. “Only one technician.”
“Okay, okay,” Jackson says frantically. “I’m sliding you my gun. Don’t shoot, I’m coming out.”
“It’ll come back to you,” Garth interrupted his rambling with a soft smile. The captain was incredibly patient with him.
“No, Mom, this isn’t about the landscaping,” Castiel insists. “I was just wondering what you say to Dad when you know he’s mad at you.”
Castiel sits down on a cushioned theater seat in between Crowley and Gabriel. The two of them purposefully left seats in between them so they wouldn’t have to sit next to each other. Things have been extra frosty between them since the party. Kali and Gabriel seemed to really hit it off, and Crowley is not pleased. Castiel’s sure that it’s less to do with him being upset about Kali not liking him and more to do with him being upset that she chose Gabriel over him. It’s a bruise to his big ego.
“There what is?” He asked once he regained his ability to speak.
“I mean, I would,” Dean reasoned. “Unless you want to listen to him constantly make fun of your haircut.”
“Thank you,” Dean says after Benny finishes fastening his cloak.
For a second, he thought about telling Gabriel the secret Balthazar shared with him, but he banished that thought as quickly as it arrived. That would be cruel. “That’s it!” Dean said, making his voice sound cheerful.
Dean can’t believe how thirty seconds of Cas’s voice can change his mood so drastically. He was crying not a minute ago, and now his cheeks are starting to hurt from smiling.
They ended up stuffing the two bodies into the back closet of the gas station. There was a lock on the door that Castiel had to pick in order to shove them in. It was good they'd managed to find a place they could put the bodies behind a closed door because that would make it less likely for ferals to find them. By the time they made their way back to Corvega, Castiel could see the sun starting to set. He had to admit that the Wasteland was strangely beautiful whenever the sun went down. The oranges and yellows stood out against the broken landscape, and it gave him hope that beauty could still be found even in these dangerous times.
“Okay,” was all Castiel could manage in response.
. Castiel wasn’t going to think about that. He wasn't going to think about what would happen if Alistair got the kid alone.
Castiel climbed up the steps behind Dean, trying hard not to admire his ass in those jeans and trying even harder not to remember the last time they’d climbed these stairs together. He couldn't help but wonder if being back in his apartment would trigger any memories for Dean. Would he remember their time together? Would he be angry that Castiel didn’t tell him that they knew each other?
“Did families really used to live all on top of each other like this?” Dean asked, pointing to how the houses are lined up in rows right next to each other. He figured Blue might know the answer since he was interested in history like his mom used to be. He wondered if that was where Blue learned all of this.
Up on the main video screen they were searching through surveillance footage from Zurich. They only had access to a couple of street cameras, but there was a camera facing the entrance of the bank. They were watching the feed from around the time their agent made the call that Dean had just left, but they passed the time and never saw him exit the bank.
been responsible for the deaths of any fellow agents. It must've been because he was Gabriel’s brother.
“Dean is a guest in our house. I’m sure you’ll like him if you give him a chance.”
He put his head in his hands and wondered how a boy from Kansas was able to climb this far under his skin in a matter of a few weeks.
When he got to the table, the boys sitting there looked up at him curiously. “Mind if I sit here?” Dean asked.
“What?” Blue chuckled. “It’s no worse than looting a human corpse.”
The drive back to the house with Castiel and Alfie is a pretty awkward affair. Dean is driving and apparently he is also the only one trying to alleviate the awkward silence in the car. Novak is a weird guy by any measure, but he is surprised by how much the other agent has closed off.
Castiel would be lying if he said he wasn’t taken aback by Dean’s seemingly sincere apology. After all, the green-eyed agent has been nothing but hostile towards him the past two days. Maybe seeing Svenson attack him like that during the interrogation was enough to humanize him. Whatever the reason, Castiel is just happy that they can be civil towards one another now. He didn’t want to make any enemies out of his coworkers on his first case.
“My brother...” Castiel paused, unsure if he'd ever told Dean about Gabriel. Not that it mattered since Dean didn't appear to recognize him, much less remember anything about him. “Gabriel and I decided to start café bookstore together in Iceland last year. It had comfortable couches where people could read while they drank their coffee. It was lovely! We had enough money left over to get it up and running, and it was everything we’d dreamed it would be. I was happy for the first time since…” He drifted off with a blush, but Dean didn't seem to notice. “Well, it was near Reykjavik, and it was the only shop like it in town, so everyone loved it. It was amazing for about six months until it turned out that the jerk who had fronted us the lease was scamming us, and we had to give it up. I wanted to try it again, but Gabriel was with Kali by that point and they…”
They’re both quiet for a few more minutes while Castiel drives them out of town and towards the edge of the country where the prison is located. After a little while Jo speaks again. “Thank you.”
Tuesday, September 29
He’d already grown a bit attached to the boy after running into him those couple times in Lexington, and it was enough to put his reputation on the line to claim him and keep him out of Alistair’s sadistic clutches. But now that he knew he was Mary’s son Dean, he had to protect him like he was unable to protect her. He had her eyes—those same green eyes that had haunted him for the past six years.
“Is there any way I’ll be able to tell when I’m close?” He asks.
Dean doesn’t know who to believe anymore. It seems like everyone is only pretending to like him when they’re really just scheming about how to get back at and backstab each other. He makes up an excuse and hangs up the phone before he can embarrass himself further by crying on the phone.
“Blessed day,” Benny greets Castiel without pausing in his work.
When they appeared to be ready, Castiel leaned forward and dropped his voice into a gravelly whisper. “So who wants to hear about the date I have planned for Saturday?” When the boys looked sufficiently excited, Castiel continued, “I have plans with a Hancock girl.” Their faces lit up, and Castiel breathed a sigh of relief. So what if people are spreading rumors that he was hanging out with the loser from Kansas? At least his friends were still looking at him the same way as they had last week.
“Maybe he did this with the omega before you. Maybe she told someone about it,” Jo speculates. “I’ll try to find out.”
at that. Dean must be playing his part very convincingly.
“Good morning, Dean,” Castiel says with a hint of a smile. “What can I do for you?”
“What kind of player is Svenson?” Gabriel asked.
Dean looks down at his feet. “I don’t know. I thought you could use a friend.”
“Nah, it’s alright if it’s only BAU members in there,” Dean finally says.
“I mean it shouldn’t have happened, period,” Dick said angrily. “All of the Letters go through a rigorous training program over a period of several years, and like I said, we put in the money required to make them into virtual machines. They go into the training program as humans with flaws and free-will, and they come out as Letters. It’s that simple.” Sam had to brace his hand on the edge of the desk to keep himself in his seat. All he wanted to do right now was launch himself across the room to beat the shit out of his boss.
Dean rushes out of their makeshift command center and runs towards the bus as the S.W.A.T. members move in. He can hear footsteps chasing behind him, but he doesn’t know which of his team members it is, but he doesn’t care right now. He just needs to get to Sam. He steps onto the bus and sees Sam leaning over Andrew May.
“Wait,” Castiel said, holding up his hand. “There she is.”
“I-I don’t know,” he winced. “My head.”
“I do,” Dean’s voice comes out of nowhere. He’s standing by Charlie. They must’ve decided to switch bonfires when they saw how much fun everyone was having over here. Castiel feels slightly bad about setting Dean up with Charlie since he knows she’s gay, but then he sees how well they’re getting along. He told himself the reason he picked Charlie was so Dean couldn’t win the bet, but really he just didn’t want to have to see Dean kiss anyone. He knows that isn’t fair. He doesn’t have any claim on Dean. They had one practice kiss, that’s it.
Castiel isn’t sure if he’s talking about his bullet wound, how he feels about his first case on the job, or how he’s dealing with the aftermath of the trauma he’d been through. The answer to all of those questions would be ‘not good,’ but Castiel finds himself saying, “I’m alright.” He can tell that Gabe knows he isn't telling the full truth, but also that he doesn’t have the energy to go into it right now.
“Hey, Cas,” he said softly, letting his gaze drop slowly from those lovely blue eyes down to his slightly chapped lips and back up again. There was a nice red flush on Cas’s cheeks now. Dean took another step forward, and Cas stepped backwards, but he didn't seem uninterested. If anything, he seemed like he was holding back. Dean continued to walk forwards until Castiel’s back was up against the wall. “Is this alright?” he asked gruffly. Castiel’s body language was giving him the green light, but he needed to ask to be sure.
“If you’re the Supreme Entity, then you can remove it,” the unsub says. His voice is a bit clearer this time.
“Who is this?” Dean pointed to a name with a question mark next to it.
“Guided by His howl,” he greets her with a whisper.
His old neighborhood was situated at the edge of the city of Concord, Massachusetts. Maybe he’d be able to find some people there even though he couldn't see any signs of life. He grabbed the backpack that held the few items he’d collected so far: the medicine, the gun and ammo, and the cash he’d pulled from the vault technician’s desk, and he made his way towards the big bridge at the edge of the neighborhood that crossed over the river. There was more water flowing in the river than there had been in the smaller creek he’d crossed earlier, but it was still not nearly as full as it had been before he'd entered the vault.
“Mhmm.” Benny clearly didn't believe him, but that wasn't his fault. Though for a second Dean wondered why Anna got a similar impression from Castiel. It didn't really matter, because even if Castiel was harboring a secret crush on him, which he obviously wasn't given that he’d made his life hell since he got here, it wouldn’t matter since Dean didn't feel that way.
“It doesn’t feel very private,” The girl responded and took a sip of water from a water bottle attached to her saddle.
He pulls his hardened cock out of his pants when Ofal gets up on all fours on his bed. He gently pulls Ofal’s dress up just enough to see what he’s doing. He’s trying to help Ofal maintain as much of his dignity as he can given the situation. He can’t help the small grunt of pleasure he releases when he sinks into the omega’s slick heat. It’s unlike anything he’s ever felt before.
There’s a Guardian in the house? He walks up the steps to the back door in a daze. Ofmarv wouldn’t have risked telling him that if it wasn’t true. He’s not sure how she could possibly know, but he trusts her.
“Well you should try,” The other boy said harshly. “Me and my friends have our own thing going, and you’ll probably feel left out if you try and join in. You know, since we’ve known each other for so long.” Castiel phrased it in a way that made it seem like he was trying to look out for Dean, but he knew that was bullshit.
Blue rubbed his hand across his face and then sat up straight. He looked worn out but more focused than when he first entered the room. He squeezed Meg’s hand and said, “You’re right. I’m just tired of being in the same vicinity as that dick.”
“I can help you,” the doctor whispers to him. “If Rolston can’t get you pregnant, they won’t blame him. They’ll say it’s
“When did you meet her?” Balthazar asked and then turned to check out the crowd of varsity football jocks walking past them. Castiel was happy that Balthazar had become so comfortable in his sexuality. Even though they lived on the east coast, they were kind of in the middle of nowhere. People were more accepting here than he assumed people were in Kansas, but it was still risky to come out as gay during high school.
Castiel tried to calm himself down now that Dean was out of the car. He spent a couple minutes trying to even out his breathing, but nothing was working. When he closed his eyes, all he could see was Dean and that assassin fighting. All he felt was the overwhelming fear for not only his safety, but for Dean’s, which was a bit silly given that he could clearly take care of himself. Even more horrifying than the fight, though, was the blank look Dean had on his face the whole time. It was like he was a robot or something. The methodical way he’d reacted to that guy jumping out of the window, checking his watch and packing up his bag like nothing happened, was going to haunt him for some time.
“Yeah, you told him that Castiel has lonely conversations with his cat,” Gabriel laughed.
anywhere to stay.”
a costume,” Benny retorts. “You look the same as you always do: identical to Castiel.” Dean stiffens because he’s also wearing the same costume as Cas is, but Crowley and Gabriel walk away without responding. “I wasn’t talking about you, Dean,” Benny clarifies. “I know the costumes were your idea.”
It took him a few seconds to get his brain back on track after the sensation of their groins pressing together. “I-I haven’t…” Dean stopped what he was doing to pull back and look at Castiel’s face. He was hovering over him now, and Castiel couldn't help running his hands along his well-defined biceps. Dean was muscular all over, but not in an overly built sort of way. It was all lean muscle.
“Guys, look at his arm,” Dean points towards the screen. “It looks like he tried to cut whatever ‘it’ is out of his arm by himself.”
“You shouldn’t know about that,” she argued.
It is explicitly forbidden for omegas to read. Everyone knows that knowledge is power. In every oppressive society throughout history, the lower classes were either forbidden to read or not educated enough to read. Now that this regime has taken formerly educated and productive members of society and reduced them to their biological functions, the government has to forbid them from reading or listening to news in order to keep them docile. It’s all about control.
Dean straddled the intruder to keep him from standing up. He was still conscious but only barely. Dean grabbed him by the hair, pulled his head up, and then shoved it back onto the floor with a thump. “Who are you?” The man coughed up blood. “Who are you??” Dean repeated, slamming his head against the floor again.
“You can ask me anything,” Naomi says seriously. She sits down on the edge of his bed to avoid messing up the comforter and stares at him patiently to show she’s listening.
“Something like that,” Blue said evasively. Dean wanted to ask more questions, but he could tell that was all he was going to get out of him tonight.
“I’m actually happy I told you and not Castiel,” Balthazar said, his voice low. “There, now you have two secrets to keep.” He turned around and walked away quickly to follow his friends.
“Yesterday at Morningstar Farms," Castiel finally answered. "She has the reddest hair I’ve ever seen, and she has her own horse too.”
“No way,” Gabriel rolled his eyes. “I told him first.” Castiel groaned. The last thing he needed was for two of his boys to start fighting over some girl they both saw once at a party. That was one advantage of Balthazar being gay. He wasn't ever involved in this sort of drama.
“No, I need to see the body,” Dean explained. They needed to see it for their own eyes not just trust this guy that it was here.
Dean turns to Ofmarv, hoping she’ll pick up his hint that he’d like to talk more. “Would you like to take the long way home?”
. Really, Dean?” Dean just shrugged.
They pull up to the prison fifteen minutes later. They’d scheduled a meeting with Keith Jespersen who apparently is the guard who worked in Richard Svenson’s cell block when he was a prisoner here. When they meet up with Keith, they explain that they were originally here to ask about Svenson’s old cell mate, but since he is dead they want to know if there’s anyone else who had relationships with Svenson while he was in prison.
“You’ll have to wait and see.” Balthazar turns around and slaps the ass of his leather pants.
Dean stepped inside towards where Castiel and Sam were talking. “There’s no sign of Ashley Frank here. We can arrest him with probable cause, but we won’t be able to hold him,” Sam said. Once they’d finished the profile, they were able to check out the suspect list the police had compiled. Richard Svenson was at the top of the list and he fit the profile almost exactly. Dean knew they had the right guy.
Bobby zooms in a bit more on the page. “The crime lab matched the handwriting to Matt’s handwriting. It must’ve been dictated to him.”
“I don’t know!” The man says.
“Dean?” He asked in confusion.
The two of them begin the walk towards the river and back towards their houses, and he thinks about Charlie.
“Okay, I’ll tell Dick,” Sam said brusquely.
“I want to believe you, Sam, but I’m not so sure,” she sighed. Before he could argue with her some more, she continued, “Put Roman on the line.”
“Heya,” Gabriel says and then takes a huge bite of his fro-yo.
Castiel nodded, unsure how he could convey to Dean that this wasn’t an issue. He wasn't sure what Dean had to be insecure about, but he would never cross any of his boundaries. While he was trying to figure out what he should say, he could see Dean’s face become progressively more anxious. He knew he needed to act quickly, so he leaned in and kissed Dean again. He must've caught the other man by surprise, because it took him a few seconds to respond. Castiel moved his hands down towards Dean’s ass to see if it felt as perfect as it looked. It was better. Dean groaned when he gave an experimental squeeze.
The eastern light shines through the window as he waits in stillness for the morning bell to toll. He takes stock of his room as he often does because there’s nothing better to do. There's not much to look at, but he's grateful for it nonetheless. There's a window, a desk, a lamp, a chair, and of course, a bed. The window has pale curtains that do little to filter out the morning sunlight. It's also been sealed shut. He wishes for the hundredth time that he could open the window to let some fresh air into his musty room, but he's given up trying to open it. The Powers That Be don't want to take any chances of an omega running away. He thinks it's a bit silly. Why would an omega try to run away? There's nowhere to go.
“Okay, people, costumes,” he claps his hands. “We have three days until Halloween. Anybody have ideas?”
Sam sighed. He didn't want to admit it was possible for Dean to be a traitor, that was true, but he also didn't think Dean had it in him. Besides, it was like Crowley said earlier. If he was a traitor, why hadn't he immediately gone to the media? He should've known they’d have everyone out looking for him. A traitor would've made their story known so that they could've been granted asylum in a different country where they would be protected.
“You’re right,” Dean said. “We didn’t sign in.”
“He said he’s trying to get a feel for what happened to his brother,” another agent responds. Dean nods as if that makes sense, but Castiel doesn’t get it. It reminds him of what Dean had been doing on their first case when he said he was ‘role-playing’, whatever that means.
“Yes, Mistress.”
“Thanks,” he exhaled.
“Wait, I think I’ve got something,” Ash said from where he was looking at the surveillance footage. It was a still shot from a surveillance camera across the street from the bank. The picture clearly showed Dean walking purposefully across the street with a bag slung over one shoulder. “It’s from forty minutes ago.”
? That wasn't how a hostage situation was supposed to work. If anything, he was the one who should be having trust issues here. “Clarence…” He tested the name out, and the older man looked up at him. “I’m not going to do anything stupid, but I need you to do something for me. I’m trying to trust you a bit here, but I can’t until you promise me this.”
“He said ‘Roman’, but I have no idea what that means.” Dean sighed. “It’s probably some sort of code anyways.”
“She’s just my friend too, Dean,” Castiel replies, perplexed. Oh. He must’ve read that wrong. He takes another small step forward so he’s fully in Castiel’s personal space now, and the other boy has nowhere to go.
He feels Castiel move away just enough to place a kiss on his forehead. Dean opens his eyes and sees that Castiel looks surprised almost like he hadn’t meant to do that. Dean smiles softly at him because he doesn’t think he’d be able to use words right now. He’s never been good at expressing his feelings, but he does know that he didn’t mind Castiel kissing him. He tilts his head to the side in invitation, because actions speak louder than words anyways.
Dean walks around the backyard aimlessly while he looks for Benny or any of his friends. He’s still reeling from the full blown make-out session he’d just had with Cas. That was so far beyond practice kissing. It had been incredible, but as usual it left Dean wanting more. Holding Cas on top of him like that had felt so right, and when he’d ground down on him…
Castiel wasn’t sure, but he nodded. Dean was right about it feeling better with a second finger, and he was curious to see if it was even better with a third. He heard the sound of the lube bottle cap opening again, and then a few seconds later, he felt more pressure at his entrance. He groaned when Dean started fucking him slowly with three fingers.
Friday, October 23
“I’m really good at it,” Sam insists. He pulls a dime out of his pocket and demonstrates. “I can make it appear and disappear. Watch.” He moves his hand smoothly, and the coin disappears. Then he does the same motion again, and it comes back.
“Thanks for the ride.” Dean turned away from Cas, so he could open the door. Maybe if he left without looking at his face or those blue eyes, it wouldn't hurt as much.
While he’s staring into the room, Mistress Abbadon looks up and catches his eye. He still hasn’t been able to get a good read on her. So far she’s seemed pretty sympathetic apart from being upset on rutting day. Dean understands on some level that it must be hard for the wives too. Even though they’re Alphas and have more rights than pretty much anyone else, they’re still women and therefore still have to be subordinate to the Commanders.
First he spotted Meg sitting down at one of the tables, and when she stood up, the rest of the group followed. They were all there except for Garth who was probably already making his way to the apartments to get set up. Castiel was happy to see that Gordon and Zach seemed to have no clue what was about to happen. They both looked excited to go on a raid.
“He jumped out of the window,” Cas muttered quietly. “W-why would he do something like that?”
“So, he did manage to get away?” Sam asked.
“What is it?” Gabriel asks, noticing the small smile that’s formed on Castiel’s face.
“Maybe he thinks he’s been microchipped by the government,” Gabriel offers. “He might be paranoid that the government is watching him.”
“Okay,” he said quietly. Dean smiled and wiped the tears off of his cheeks before pulling him into another hug. This time Castiel hugged him back tightly as if he could keep Dean from leaving again. The other man hissed in pain. “Are you hurt?”
He reaches into the back pocket of his jeans to make sure Lisa’s note is still there. Maybe he’ll show it to Cas after dinner. He can’t wait to see his neighbor’s reaction. He imagines that they’ll read it over and over again, analyzing every single word. He can’t stop smiling, because he finally has a friend to share stuff like this with. Dean has a feeling life in Bar Harbor is about to get much more exciting.
“Drop your gun now or I’ll kill him!” An unknown voice shouted. Dean’s heart was beating so fast, he could hear it in his ears. He peeked around the door so he could see what was happening outside. There was a group of at least five people with torches standing on their land. There appeared to be more figures standing further back, but they were hard to make out in the darkness. His stomach dropped when he saw a man holding a knife to Sammy’s throat. Bobby had his gun raised to the man, but he was way outmatched. Dean didn’t know what to do. There was no way he’d be able to take out enough of them quickly enough to turn the tide in their favor. He couldn’t accurately shoot the man holding Sam, and if he shot any of the other men, Sam died, Bobby died, and then he died.
“Dean,” Blue said softly, looking back down at his lips.
“We thought you guys would be excited about this,” Dean chimes in. Castiel is glad that he has his back at least. He’s much more loyal than Crowley anyways.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Alistair feigned innocence and took a step to the side to try and get away from him.
Castiel laid there like jello for a few seconds, enjoying listening to the sound of their combined panting as they both come down, but then he realized he should probably get up. Dean wouldn't want him to stay. He was about to sit up when he felt two strong arms come around his middle and pull him back down onto the bed.
“You take care of this car?” Dean asked him while he scanned the map.
“Okay,” Castiel nodded.
Castiel rolls his eyes but steps back out onto the sidewalk to their usual meeting spot. He sees Inias making his way through the pick-up line and looks over towards where the three boys had been huddled. Crowley is nowhere to be seen, but Gabriel and Balthazar are heading this way.
“Where’s the fun in that?” Dean plays along. Alistair chuckles.
“The water is still cold,” Cas said with a small smile. Maybe he wasn’t mad about the kiss. Dean leaned up against the doorway and dropped the knife behind him out of sight. It fell and stuck itself into the wood floor.
“Wait,” Castiel grabs his wrist to stop him. “Go to the Out of Order bathroom by the pool, and I’ll bring some girls over.”
“Control is an illusion.” Dean turned to look at him, but he was facing forward again. He could see Lexington off in the distance, and he could just make out the looming towers of the factory through the fog. It was still at least a thirty minute walk at this pace. Dean waited for him to say something else, but he didn't until a few minutes later. “I really am sorry about this. I had no idea this was your farm.” Dean gritted his teeth but stayed silent. “I am going to do whatever I can to make this as easy as possible for you given the circumstances, but you must understand that I have to keep up appearances. I’m only
He tried to think of where they should go, but that was difficult when his brain was like Swiss cheese. Then he remembered that Cas was here. He was someone who knew the old Dean intimately, who knew his habits and patterns.
Crowley smirked, and Castiel immediately knew where this was going. “Well you’re in luck, you probably will be!” Crowley looked at Castiel for approval because his comment was extra nasty, but he was too busy reeling from the realization that he might actually be forced to make this Would You Rather choice at some point if he ended up going out with Anna and not falling for her.
“Are you a con man?” Castiel asked.
There was a pause on the other end of the line. “Sam, I’m not sure that you do,” Charlie said sympathetically. “Dean is in a romantic relationship with Castiel Novak, and he backed out of his mission to kill Lucifer Morningstar, Castiel’s cousin. It’s clear the two of them have known each other longer than a couple of days. I mean, it looks like...”
“Blessed day,” Cas repeats. He leans up against the kitchen counter and starts sipping his coffee.
Sam clears his throat. “Statistics show that if you follow the instructions in the ransom, your son won’t be harmed.” Larry nods and takes a deep breath to calm himself down.
Jo looks around. “There’s a way to help them,” she whispers. “You can join us.”
“Three-fifty,” Someone shouted from the crowd.
Charlie’s eyes widened. “That’s pretty far north. You guys must be tired after traveling all the way down here.”
Before he has a chance to remember what he’d been planning to say to end the argument, Dean closes the remaining distance between them and kisses him hard. Castiel’s hands latch onto his hips to push him away, but when he feels Dean trembling slightly, he pauses. Dean was
about giving you an invitation.”
“I don’t know,” Castiel says, confused why they’d care. “A million dollars or something. Whatever.” He hears Dean cough out a stunned laugh to his right.
“Where’s Sammy?” John slurs. “I need to talk to my boys.”
“I’ll need to stop by the hospital after work for a bit, but I can join up with you all later.”
