“It’s not all that much. It only looks like a lot, especially when you’re tired.”
“Yeah, well, sit down and we’ll make sure.”
“I know that this is… a lot. It’s frightening. You think I don’t feel that too? It’s frightening because it feels important.”
“No. Maybe sometimes. I don’t know.” Dean sighs. “Maybe sometimes I feel like I was lucky, in a way—hunting has felt like my responsibility for a long time, and it just happens to be the one thing I’ve ever really been good at. Now sometimes I just feel sort of… out of place.”
“Will it?” Dean sighs, closing his eyes. “A good night’s sleep won’t give me an education. It won’t give me experience that I don’t have. I’m not sure tiredness is the problem here.”
Dean feels Cas’s shrug. “Sometimes I do, I guess. But I like what we’re doing now. This feels right.”
He glances up to survey that sea of boxes, desperate to give his eyes a break from the harsh light of the laptop, and he nearly jumps out of his chair at the sight of the silent figure in the doorway. Even as a human, Cas hasn’t lost his ability to seemingly appear out of nowhere.
It’s not the worst condition either of them have been in upon stumbling into a rundown motel room after a hunt, but it’s the first big hunt they’ve gone on since they’ve been together. It’s the first hunt since Cas has been human this time around, and the blood trickling down his face is enough to send Dean into a near panic. He ignores the ache in his side as he crosses the room to dig through his duffel bag—there’s undoubtedly a nasty bruise forming just below his ribs, but that doesn’t matter, not when Cas is bleeding.
Dean gives a slight nod before leaning up to meet Cas’s lips, letting the embrace dissolve his doubts for a little while. Cas’s mouth is warm against his, that scrape of stubble that’s only just started to become familiar sending a thrill through him. Even if everything goes well, Dean knows it’ll be a long time before these thoughts stop plaguing him, if they ever do. They could be together still twenty years down the line, and even then it’s hard for Dean to imagine not worrying about losing Cas. It’s hard for him to imagine ever not worrying that he won’t be enough. But they’re together now, and Cas is so patient and gentle with him, and all Dean can do is try his best. Maybe that’s enough, at least for now.
“I’m fine. Just a few bruises, probably.” Cas’s voice is warm and gentle, and Dean allows it to ease some of his tension. “You?”
good things are okay, too.
“But you know that if something serious does happen and you can’t heal me, that’s not some kind of failure on your part. You’ve always been more than just your powers, Cas. And, for the record, just because you can’t heal me anymore doesn’t mean you don’t help me. Just being with you does me a world of good.”
Cas obeys, although his expression tells Dean he’s only humoring him. Dean can’t find it in himself to be even a little blasé, though. Even now that things are slowing down enough for him to see that the cut above Cas’s eye is not as severe as he’d first thought, he’s still struggling to keep his hands from shaking as he opens the kit. He won’t feel better as long as there’s such an alarming amount of blood.
Dean wonders if
“And if the bar fails?” Dean presses.
“Hmm?”
“Geez, man, how long have you been there?”
Dean rubs his eyes again, the headache growing more persistent. When he looks up, he’s met with that familiar, concerned expression that means Cas thinks he’s overdoing it. It’s a look Cas has worn quite a lot over the last few months, no longer as urgent as it was when Dean would jolt awake from a nightmare or get injured on a hunt, but just as persistent.
“Sorry.” Cas sounds sincere, and great, now Dean also feels like an asshole.
“Why not,” Dean chuckles. “I can give it a go. But I still think I’m going to run this place into the ground.”
“It’s hard to accept. But I think I want to believe it.”
Maybe it’s the certainty Cas said it with, or maybe it’s the post-hunt, adrenaline-crash exhaustion starting to settle over him and muddle his thoughts, but for a split second the idea doesn’t sound entirely crazy.
“It’s okay,” Cas says, stepping further into the office. “I just wanted to check on you.”
“’S nothing,” Dean says weakly, not actually expecting Cas to buy it.
Letting his eyes droop shut again, Dean yawns and buries his face in Cas’s shoulder. He still can’t quite believe that Cas is here with him, that they’re
“That’s not funny.” Dean’s voice comes out a little harsher than he’d meant it to. Yes, now that he’s actually looking at the wound, the panic is starting to recede and he’s realizing that maybe he’s overreacting a little. Maybe. But at the very least, it doesn’t feel like an unfounded overreaction. Cas could have easily been hurt more than he is.
“You’re beautiful, Dean Winchester.”
Dean just nods, heat creeping up the back of his neck even as the fear that this will be the moment Cas decides he’s not worth the effort settles in his stomach.
“But what does that mean?” Dean props himself up on an elbow, his agitation growing. “Does it mean we… we spend our lives together? I don’t know if you’ve noticed, Cas, but the people in my life don’t tend to meet good ends. And that’s assuming you don’t get fed up with me first, which seems like a bit of a stretch.”
It was a pretty straightforward case that led them to a couple of ghouls—nothing to write home about. Sam had even offered to find someone else to put on the case, someone already in the area, but Dean had insisted that he and Cas could take it. With the new leadership in both heaven and hell, things have been relatively quite lately. That sinking feeling of being certain you’re going to die soon has started to ease out of Dean’s chest. He was actually starting to get a little antsy, stuck in the bunker without any real work to do. Cas, on the other hand, had seemed perfectly content with the quiet existence, but he’d made no objection when Dean suggested they head out on this hunt. It occurs to Dean now that Cas might have only been on board for his sake, and the thought makes his stomach twist with guilt.
to keep doing this…”
Dean pulls back just enough to see the worried pinch between Cas’s brows, and Cas raises a hand to his face, carefully running his thumb along the bottom edge of Dean’s lip. As he does, Dean can feel the sting of a cut he hadn’t noticed before—a split lip isn’t exactly a rare occurrence and normally Dean wouldn’t pay it any mind. But Cas frowns at it, even as Dean presses a kiss to the pad of his thumb.
. Why Cas fell in love with him to begin with is something Dean is certain he will never understand, but now that Cas is human, now that his life is finite, it makes even less sense that he would want to spend that life with Dean. Sure, the last couple of weeks have been great, but there’s always a honeymoon phase. It won’t be long now before Dean starts letting Cas down, and eventually Cas will realize that it’s no good trying to be with someone so deeply broken. Or Dean could fail him in a much simpler way: he could just fail to keep Cas safe. They could be out on any old hunt, and one little slip-up could end up costing Cas’s life. Of course that’s always been a possibility for Sam and him, and it’s one that they’ve even experienced a few times, but with Cas it feels different somehow
“Will I make it?” Cas asks drily as Dean examines the gash.
A slow smile spreads across Cas’s lips as Dean speaks, which Dean watches with pleasure. Sometimes it hits him afresh how beautiful Cas is, and he can’t believe how he could have ever gotten so lucky. But even when he’s hit with that surprise again, he doesn’t fear that Cas won’t be here tomorrow, not like he did at first. Cas has said for months now that this is what he wants, and day by day, little by little, Dean’s doubts have eased. He goes to bed at night knowing that Cas will still be there in the morning. And if that’s the case, then maybe there’s hope for him after all. Maybe he can at least partially accept that he’s capable of having something good in his life. Maybe someday he’ll be able to accept that
“I’ll try if you do,” Cas says, settling down beside him. They’re not quite touching, but their faces are barely an inch apart.
Cas shrugs, the muscle of his broad shoulders moving under one of Dean’s old t-shirts, the hem of which just barely reaches the top of his pajama pants. “A minute or two, maybe. You seemed pretty focused.”
Cas seems to think this over for a moment before responding, catching the edge of Dean’s jacket and rubbing the material between his fingers. “No, I suppose I can’t.”
“You don’t miss hunting or anything?”
Dean’s quiet for a long moment, his thoughts a jumble of half-formed words that are gone too quickly to take on any coherency. It’s been a long time since he’s considered leaving the life. After everything that happened with Lisa, Dean came to accept that it just wasn’t in the cards. Hunting is a part of him, and it’s something he knows will follow him through the rest of his life no matter what, even if it only takes the form of nightmares. And sure, Sam and Eileen are more or less out, preferring to take on something more akin to Bobby’s role as resident researcher and coordinator. But Sam’s the one who was always meant to get out. Dean doesn’t even know who the hell he’d be if he wasn’t a hunter.
“I understand,” Cas says softly. “I suppose I feel similarly myself sometimes. Not about hunting, necessarily, but about… Heaven. For millennia I’ve been part of some grand, cosmic plan. Whether it was good or not, the work felt important. This feels… selfish, in a way.”
could do something else.”
feel?”
Cas does as instructed and Dean goes to work wiping away the blood that’s been cascading down the side of his face. He can feel Cas watching him, their faces only inches apart, but Dean won’t meet his eyes. He tells himself to focus on the task at hand. If he lets himself really
“Okay, let’s say it doesn’t fail, at least not right away. Are you sure you’re okay with living like this? Isn’t there a part of you that feels like, I don’t know, we’re shirking our responsibility or something? Like we owe it to the world to keep hunting?”
. And it’s not like everything’s perfect now. It’s not like he doesn’t have doubts and fears or moments when he’s suddenly certain that every decision he’s ever made in his life has been wrong. But in his gut, he knows that things are okay. He can face the things that might arise from here. He and Cas can face them together.
Dean raises his shirt without protest and tries to sit still as Cas’s fingertips lightly trail over his skin. It would tickle if he weren’t tracing the edge of a bruise that’s actually pretty damn sore.
Dean starts to make some crack about how comforting that is, but something in Cas’s expression stops him. “Hey. Something wrong?”
“If I didn’t wake you up, you’d sleep all day.” There’s no real rebuke in Dean’s words, and as he speaks he tangles their legs and presses a kiss to the top of Cas’s head.
“Why don’t you come upstairs now?” Cas says, more insisting than suggesting. “You can come back to this in the morning. I’m sure it’ll be easier once you’ve gotten some sleep.”
. That’s why he’s been doing all of this—to give them a fighting chance at a peaceful life.
Cas’s voice draws him from his thoughts, and when he looks up he sees that Cas’s expression has softened into something a little warmer than concern. Cas comes around the desk to put his hands on Dean’s shoulders, and Dean leans back into him gratefully. The expression is just plain care, he realizes, and that too is a familiar look coming from Cas.
But his awareness drifts back to the exquisite feeling of Cas lying in his arms, the safety in the warm press of their bodies, and Dean feels his throat tighten. He’s been bouncing between anxiety and grief and doubt, and now it all seems to hit him at once. He closes his eyes and tries to take a deep breath, but of course Cas feels him stiffen.
Cas presses a kiss to Dean’s shoulder. “At the moment I’m mostly sleepy. But generally, yes.”
Still, it’s surprising how homey a place can feel with just some natural light and a few pieces of secondhand furniture. The bunker will always be the place Dean considers his first real home since Mary died, but he is finding that there’s something about the legitimacy of living somewhere normal that he takes pride in. And this isn’t just his home—it’s his home with Cas. There are little things everywhere to remind him that this is their place. The plants lining every single windowsill that Cas likes to tend to. The bedroom closet where ostensibly their clothes are each contained to their own side, despite the fact that Dean’s clothes have the mysterious habit of showing up among Cas’s. The framed photo of Cas in his cowboy hat that sits proudly on Dean’s nightstand. Maybe none of it screams “domestic” on its own, but all together there’s an odd kind of cohesion to it, making up a place that’s comfortable and permanent and
Dean reflexively tightens his arms around Cas at the thought, and Cas notices, pulling back a little to look up at him.
“I’m glad I’m more than a regrettable one-night stand for you.”
really what you want? Have you really thought about this?”
Dean long ago got used to waking in the perpetual darkness of the bunker with no clue whether or not is was morning. More often than not it turned out to be too early to be awake, but whatever nightmare woke him would be lingering on the edges of his mind, making him just uneasy enough to keep him from returning to sleep. He had gotten used to that, too. He’s always had nightmares, and ever since his time in Hell they've regularly kept him lying awake through the night. For years that's just been an accepted part of his life.
There have been plenty of times in Dean’s life when he might have hesitated, even flat-out lied.
Dean glances at his watch, somewhat startled to see that the wee hours of the morning have crept in. At least that explains the foggy, achy exhaustion he can’t shake.
He’s met with silence, and when he looks up again Cas is watching him thoughtfully.
Cas mumbles something incoherent, pressing his face into the pillow, and Dean can’t help but chuckle.
“Dean.” This time he sounds fully alert, his tone telling Dean that they won’t be brushing this off. “What’s wrong?”
“But after all this time, after everything we’ve been through together, do you really think I could expect something from you that you can’t give?” Cas’s brow is furrowed again, and Dean fights the urge to reach out and smooth the creases. “I know you, and I love you for exactly who you are. You don’t need to worry about that.”
They lie there quietly for a while longer, Dean running his fingers lazily up and down Cas’s spine as Cas traces patterns on Dean’s side where his shirt has ridden up. The light touch makes Dean shiver, and he can feel Cas smile into his shoulder. It’s too good to be true, he knows. Despite Cas’s insistence that good things do happen, in Dean’s experience they certainly don’t last. Sooner or later—probably sooner—he’s bound to mess this up. He’ll say the wrong thing one too many times, or not be able to say something when he needs to, or push Cas away because that’s what he’s best at. Maybe Cas will just get fed up with him. Hell, he doesn’t even have to be the reason this doesn’t work. Given how dangerous their lives are and how fragile humans are, it’s more than possible that one of them will die. And if there’s one thing that sounds more painful than losing Cas because of his own ineptitude at relationships, it’s losing Cas to some kind of sudden, violent death.
familiar with.”
“I donnnt need your azzistance!” Kevin slurs, trying to extract himself from Sam’s grip. “I am perfegtly capable – capable of – I’m a grown-ass man, dammit—!”
“If I could go back, Dean—”
and washing their pie tin; her making him a sandwich with the crusts cut off and smiling when he finishes the whole thing. In a moment of unusual clarity, Dean wonders if she’s why he’s drawn to food, cooking, the kitchen. It was always her place. It was
“I swear it’s like they speak a different language,” says Dean. Cas nods.
. And you know it isn’t healthy. In the corners of your mind, you know. The thoughts in your head and the ways they keeping circling around and back are not good for you. Sometimes you see reason and come to your senses. Sometimes you don’t. Sometimes you know you’re spiraling and you see the way out plain as day and you decide you just don’t care. You stay locked in the comfort of that destructive cycle until it’s broken. And normally you’re not the one to break it.
Kevin manages to push Sam away long enough to stumble and lurch forward again. Sam catches his arm before he hits the floor.
“Uhh, kind of, actually. It’s just a style. We can try something else.” Charlie adjusts Cas’s tie and straightens his sweater.
“He told me, in no uncertain terms, that if I couldn’t comprehend the tablet maybe I had no business being a prophet at all. But I’m paraphrasing.”
“The eyes of humans often perceive reality at a less than perfect rate.”
“Yes,” says Cas. He crosses his arms over his bare chest.
Dean glances back at his friend, who looks so small and so human. His shoulders are slumped, his eyes just as piercing as ever, and there’s something sad about the way he stares. It’s like he’s pleading. Dean considers how strange their existence is. The close quarters amplify everything, take the volume and dial it up to eleven.  Minutes ago they were laughing and joking and unacknowledged rules were being thoroughly broken. And now… as much as Dean feels sorry for Cas—and he does—nothing good ever comes of pity. He walks out of the training to find Sam and relay Garth’s message. Before he leaves he calls back to Cas and his words echo in the wide open space between them.
“We could all use a little food right now,” he says smoothly. “When’s dinner?”
like to purchase a pair of pants that fit properly.”
“You mentioned I need a way to channel the anger?” says Cas.
“I think it’s time we got you off to bed,” Sam says, hoisting Kevin onto his feet.
“Oh yeah? And what’s so vital about a shopping spree?”
“I’m sorry, okay? I didn’t know it was such a sore subject. I didn’t even know you guys were aware of it to be honest. I was kind of holding out hope that I was secretly an original character in some sort of really accurate alternate universe Supernatural fanfiction.” Charlie huffs and blows at her bangs.
Dean croons off-key at the top of his lungs while whisking a large bowl of eggs. He lays out slices of bacon to fry, pours scramble into a separate pan, and starts to brew a pot of coffee all without skipping a single lyric or missing a beat. Dean thinks Kevin may have actually started crying. The irresistible aroma of freshly cooked bacon begins to fill the kitchen and filter into other parts of the bunker. Just as Dean is plating the food (and warbling that ‘
“It’s something I used to do a lot.”
Sam cuts him off with a short hiss.
“Sounds like I missed a good one,” says Dean as he approaches the table.
“Yeah, come on
“You mean you hacked it.” Sam glowers.
Dean makes a point of staring directly at the floor. He feels Cas train a powerful gaze on his left shoulder. He tosses a couple of glass shards into the pile on his right.
“Night.”
“Don’t lie to me,” he says, low and quiet.
Sam sighs. He runs a hand through his hair and clenches his fingers. His eyes close. He takes a deep breath. How many times had Sam assured Dean that the cure would hold? How many hours had he spent watching Sam review the original cure tapes and files? Sam had read them over and over again, interviewed Crowley almost daily about his state of mind and emotional stability. Dean had allowed Sam to get chummy with Crowley. He hadn’t said a word.  And the two shared things now, like secrets and jokes. Dean had let it happen again. And now the revelation that “history repeats itself” starts to darken the skin under Sam’s eyes.
“Sounds like a plan, MacGyver.”
that one.”
He’s about made the decision to turn and leave when the handle of the door in front of him jiggles. It swings open from the inside and Cas stops in his tracks, nearly barreling into Dean’s chest. They stare awkwardly at each other. Dean’s fist is still raised and he lowers it slowly.
“Hey! I lost my phone God knows where. I had to get a new one—”
“I watched out for you… probably more than you knew. It made me feel of import, as if I alone had a very special job to do in keeping you safe. I felt it was my duty to act as your protector… I wasn’t very good at it, was I? ” Cas lifts his head from his chest and avoids Dean’s eyes.
Cas snaps his head up.
And I drove up to South fucking Dakota to try and find your dot and – and – and I thought – Jesus! I thought –” Charlie is trying very hard to avoid crying. She is trying to be a hard ass. She is trying to reprimand Sam and Dean for being the inconsiderate human beings they sometimes are. But Dean sees straight through the routine. He sees through it because he’s given the same kinds of speeches to Sam more times than he can count and they’re always about one thing and one alone: fear.
Dean takes this as his opportunity to emerge from hiding.
Sam and Dean share a look.
Sometimes I think I would have preferred death – preferred it to being
“Alright. Alright. We’ll stay put. But you call me the second those wingless dicks get any closer, you understand?”
“There’s a lot I never say. I’ve been pushing crap toward the back of my skull since… well since I can remember. I just shove it down, you know?”—Dean shifted slightly under the weight of Castiel’s arms, but he did not retreat—“I don’t think about it and I don’t let it be a part of me and I drown it with liquor and women and just about any other vice I can sink my teeth into. And this is one of those things I don’t talk about. And I’m pretty sure this isn’t even real. And I’m
“To be fair,” Dean says, “You had your work cut out for you trying to keep
“What do you need?”
When Kevin seems unable to stomach any more food, he slides his plate away and resumes using the table as a makeshift pillow. This essentially signals the end of the meal and one by one they all take their empty dishes to the sink. Crowley acts as if he’s going to start washing the dirty plates and Dean is about to pry the dishrag from his grubby little hands when a loud series of bangs sound from the control room. Everyone in the kitchen stops moving. They wait. Kevin raises his head from the table. They hear it again.
Maybe it was just time to step back from the frontlines.
Dean smiles, his arms tightening around Cas. “Yeah. I do.”
Cas smiles a little, though the expression is guarded. “You don’t believe that it’s true for you, do you?”
Cas’s voice is firm, unyielding, and when Dean meets his eyes, for a moment he sees the magnificent, commanding soldier of Heaven who pulled him out of Hell all those years ago. It’s enough to silence his spiraling thoughts for a moment, and Cas takes advantage of that.
, he’s… he’s probably doing his lover a favor by keeping the two halves of his lives separate.
Dean and Cas shared a disquieted look. That… sounded ominous. Not something Dean wanted to happen to them at any rate. Another good reason to avoid Michael and get home ASAP.
Cas let out a huff like a chuckle against Dean’s forehead and pulled him close, putting an end to any conversation.
“Shut up?! Shut up?! Do you have any idea what Squirrel has unleashed on this world?!”
“That is good to hear,” said Bartholomew, rather than ‘damn you for finding the best protection a human could wish for in this day and age.’ The League was a power not to be neglected. It wasn’t just that each and every one of them could argue until the sun went down and even an angel got bored. The members of the League communicated, they were organized, and people respected them, the good people, including many of the Sheep, and yes, even a few angels believed firmly in their cause and helped them out as much as they could. If Sam was kidnapped out of the home of the current head of the League, the kind of woe that would generate would cause unrest, worry, protests and paranoia from P1 to P419 or higher, and the angels did not want their charges disturbed, after all. They trod carefully around the Advocates.
He’s trying very hard not to step in the lasagna, he really is. He’s been working on it all afternoon. No, actually he started yesterday, Friday, when he got home from Sandover at seven pm, but his first attempt at a vegetarian gluten-free lasagna was- well, best not go into that. It’s buried at the bottom of the bin outside. The second try is palatable, and he’s sure it scores points on presentation as long as he doesn’t leave a footprint in it.
“By which you mean, he’s not going to stop Hen-... he’s not going to stop Michael and Lucifer from fighting and taking the planet down with them?”
The demon looks ever so surprised when the blade nestles into its chest. They’re arrogant, these misshapen beings born of Lucifer, they’re always flaunting their strengths until an ex-angel plugs them full of holes, and then suddenly oh, dear, how dramatic…
“He’d been imprisoned in a tower for years due to his use of foul magic, ever since I was a child.” Swan Prince looks like he’s searching through ragged snippets of long past memories. “Unfortunate that my royal father did not simply execute him… The damned wretch escaped, unleashed his powers, killed my royal parents, snared our subjects in endless sleep and walls of bramble thorns, and turned me into a swan.”
A thunderous silence greets that understatement, punctuated by the soft growls of the raccoon in the background.
The tutor gave him the look of a man who failed to see the difference. City-born as he was, he’d have never witnessed the kind of damage an adult badger could do when riled.
This again? “Charlie’s fine. Ellen checks all new arrivals for fever. We’re only let slide with people we know well, we trust ‘em to stay away or warn us if they’re feelin’ off."
Castiel glanced around, quite needlessly; angels never got lost on the planet their Father had created. “It’s a good five days walk from here.”
“You know what happened, I suppose.”
“These days, everyone agrees that multiple concussions are a really bad thing, even the NF-bloody-L,” Sam says in his pissiest tone as he helps Dean out of the haunted house, Dean’s legs as cooperative as cooked spaghetti after that brutal head-to-wall contact back there. Dean grunts, because nodding and talking hurt. He lets the little flashes of light in his vision distract him from the nagging. Lucky he’s got a hard head, another guy’s skull woulda caved in.
A jug of boiled water, a clean basin, the pillow case of his sheet set used as clean linen to wipe away the blood, the other ready to cut into strips for bandages, and his penknife heated under a match flame, ignoring grumbles from his patient. Good thing Dean was a rebel in final. His adventures on the front line and in the Wilds meant he knew first aid. Most people in Paradise didn’t know the basics of tending injuries. Few here got hurt, or if they did, they went to the altar to get healed, or the Machine sent an angel to tend to them if it was serious enough they shouldn’t be moved. Unless they died on the spot, in which case it’d just been Their Time To Go.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean carefully untwisted the wire from the door, then for extra precaution, he broke the part of the jar where the scratch pad was glued to remove the igniter. A couple of lead ball bearings and a few nails fell out of the hole, and gunpowder blackened Dean’s fingers. He brushed them absently against his trousers before knocking at the front door.
“Uriel was different, once,” Castiel said softly, staring blindly at the basin on the shelf. “He was always strong in faith, but he used to be easy going for all that, and with a great sense of humor.“
“Sam didn’t carry through with it - he was emotionally distraught, I would not judge,” Cas added quickly.
. They had been following all these strictures their whole lives, and were now cheek by jowl with people they considered sinners.”
It could be weeks before Big Mike was ready to come down and meet his new burro, but the Free Will gang did not have months in which to plan. No. Because tomorrow Bartholomew was going to debrief Cas, or maybe Naomi would, or somebody was going to take Dean aside and start
“Or with an angel who’s not losing his rag at the idea.’
Castiel is all too glad they stepped away from the pretty trap back there. “Dean, be careful. She has men dotted around the city and this castle - we need to figure out what she’s doing here.”
“Oh no, the repeal of Mary’s decree is just the start of what we needed to talk about.”
Dean flinches. His hands curl into fists in the sand. “Cas- I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have said that, I was-”
Dean gave him a very exact description of what kind of wood he needed for his various projects. Then he cleared his throat - and felt irritated at himself for the hesitation, because this was just one more thing he was asking for, and he’d been helping out neighbors all over the place this month, he had merit to spend for once, and-
Cas is sure cleanin’ them tongs. Dean opens his mouth to suggest the omega finish up and hit the hay.
Castiel takes a deep burning gulp of air, pressing his face into the comforting pillow of his forearms crossed over his knees.
rather than boneheaded. At any rate, Cas frequently swings by to say hi to Dean when he can, he’s obviously enjoying their talks too. Is there a law that says a beta and an omega can’t be buddies? Of course not. And hey, if Dean does take over as alpha, he’ll be responsible for every omega in the Hunter compound, he needs to understand where they’re coming from. So he’s doing it for the pack, really. There.
“Yes, it’s so strange, I thought they were shy creatures. But it’s been snarling at me. I opened the front door and stood back, and it ran right at me instead of going out.”
The perpetrator was standing in front of Castiel now like a miniature of the man Castiel loved, with the same glower, the same pout, the same fierce eyes full of pride and combativeness. Jo paused in the doorway; at twelve, she was Ben’s faithful squire (self-proclaimed) and wanted to show solidarity. But one stern look from Castiel sent her trudging out. Unlike Ben, it was his royal prerogative to order her around, even punish her severely if he wanted to. Not that he would ever dream of it. No, he’d just hint to Dame Ellen that Jo was getting out of hand and then the castle would shake to its foundations as mother and daughter had a row that put Ben and Castiel's to shame...
Dean does, though. Eventually. When he finally breaks for air, “Been wanting this forever,” rushes out on the exhale. His breath brushes Castiel’s mouth, enters his lungs, bathes him in warmth, like the feeling of sunshine he’s getting from Dean’s eyes, his soul.
The bar and all its mirrors tip and spin around him. Oh god… this is insane…
Dean stood staring at the blade for a long time.
“Come in, son!” Dean declared in his commander-of-men voice, “You absolutely have to help me take care of this stubborn guy here!”
“I personally believe it’s related to the free will of humans,” he elaborated when he caught Dean’s half-suspicious half-surprised glance. “Humans have a capacity for amazing change, for redemption, for making life-altering decisions with nothing more than their intuition. I believe our Father did not want to interfere too much in that. He wanted to keep a light touch.”
“Who knows? Uriel?” Dean asked, speaking calmly. Sam was shuddering beneath his hands. His eyes were wide, pupils blown, signs of saccade - shock and stress and angel mind tampering, Dean knew the symptoms. It was a minor miracle Sam had managed to get to the Roadhouse without running straight into a wall.
No words needed. They silently follow Dean who follows Ginny’s nose, feet finding twig-free dirt to step on, the ever present breeze flowing through the trees covering the rustle of the buffalo grass. They’re twenty minutes out from the pack’s compound at a hunter’s run. The terrain is sloped, the mule is slow, Dean can hear it up ahead complaining in the way only a mule can.
she wrote in wax, he read it over her shoulder by the light from the gap into the kitchen.
Dean’s jaw dropped.
“Right,” Sam says as if this confirms his own thoughts rather than agreeing with Dean’s. “You know you don’t look any different than three quarters of the male population in Alma right now, and a good half of Nebraska, right? You don’t need to wrap yourself in that many layers, anybody looking at you will just think it’s a beer gut.”
And in that view, ‘fair’ isn’t a concept they can afford anymore. Yeah, Adam had it a lot easier growing up than Sam or Dean ever had, he had a
“That’s good. I’m surprised he’s not here, banging on the table asking for your release.”
“Oh, am I? If the omniscient manifestation of our Father was speaking to Michael and fully agreed with his plans, don’t you think He would have told his favorite son where to find his perfect vessel ages ago?”
He told Cas the angel gives him a reason to live. It’s almost beyond hope that he’ll actually be able to do so… Cas is being very philosophical about the fact that they could have been boning for years now if fate - death, disaster, the usual - hadn't cockblocked them at every turn. The angel seems to think that hooking up happened when it was supposed to. But that's an immortal point of view if Dean ever heard one. Dean can’t be that sanguine about it; the thought of all the years he might have had with Cas versus the countdown of months on his arm keeps him awake every night Cas is not here. So the thought the Mark might fade, that they might have accidentally beaten it, is alluring. He might get out from under it. Cas and Sam might escape the obligation of putting down the rabid thing he’ll become…Shit. It makes him dizzy, he wants it so bad.
Some of you may be wondering, where’s Ben in all of this? He’s in the background for now, and in the foreground next chapter. Sam and Eileen will show up too, and so will Michael, to Castiel’s unparalleled joy, oh yay.
Cas breaks off with a gasp as Dean claps him on the backside. “Yeah, you’ll be fine.” Being alpha isn’t always about being toughest, especially nowadays and in the kind of community the Winchesters aim to become; it’s about organisation, responsibility and wanting the best for the pack, and Cas is already there without even noticing.
“Jeez, Dean, can you be a bigger horndog?” grouses Jo.
behind his back. Dean catches up to him in three long strides, grabs him by the shoulder and spins him around. And then there is a mouth pressed against his.
“My... uh...”
“Cas? You ever hear of a Lucifer?”
Cas turned his hooded blue eyes towards Jo. She stared back, smart enough to be cautious, but too proud and bold to hide the defiance on her face (fortunately that wasn’t penalizable.)
Cas looked at him, really looked with those two beautiful blue peepers in that wholesome serious face that Dean would follow anywhere, with or without a leash, not that he felt like admitting it, or admitting that he hadn’t actually tried to plug the bastard who wore the same features and who might conceivably be said to be the guy that Dean lo- that Dean had kinda gotten used to having around.
are also an angel on earth, and what happens when all the runaways are back home or six feet under, huh? Aren’t you in a ‘last man out turns off the lights’ kind of situation here?”
“If we haven’t run out of coffee, I will be,” Sam says, lumbering off in the direction of the kitchen. Rowena follows, clucking about food and how Sam’s a growing boy.
“Yes, I am strange. I’ve also never been in a relationship before. But you know all this already and you still chose me,” says Castiel, breathless with the wonder of it all.
“I only saw her for a few short seconds, but I’m sure I’ll recognize her when I see her again… I know I’ll never forget her… I owe her everything… But I suppose you don’t approve all the same.” Dean’s distant look switches to a much more astute one centered on Castiel. “Since healing magic is still magic.”
“...I don’t want to do this. To you.”
“Both of you stay here,” Dean ordered.
Dean lowers Robbie towards the water. Little bare feet kick in anticipation. But then the wind chases a small wave over the lake towards them, a ripple of breaking white water and a tiny splash.
“He meant as a vessel, not a date,” Sam said with a trace of dry humor - very dry, hardly humor. “Because you’re the first born and a soldier. A second born advocate wuss isn’t to his liking, apparently.”
“No. I read a paper once- it was printed in book-form, I wonder if they have a copy here. I had to leave mine in Novak, it was too old to carry without proper protection. It’s a treatise about the behavior of wolves in reserves versus wild wolf behavior. They’re not the same. What we have nowadays is a caged wolf society.”
Castiel swallows away the bitter taste in his mouth along with a sip from the tumbler, still chewing over ‘magic’ as well as a bunch of imprecations in Enochian, when that last word catches up to him. “Beautiful?”
The only answer to that is an ill-tempered growl. Dean presses down harder. Cole’s face must be picking up streak marks that match the broken concrete.
“Got it,” Castiel says with a nod, and turns towards the kitchen’s exit.
“Yes.” Balthazar heaved a sigh as he stepped away. “Yes, I can. And since I would like you to be able to come back one day, I’ll create a masterpiece of reporting that’s going to make it sound like you really had no other choice but to do as the abductors ordered, rather-”
“Silence!” Uriel’s glare finally escalated from ’you are beneath my contempt’ to ‘changed my mind, you and your human mannerisms are fully worth my contempt after all’, which was what happened when Balthazar truly got under his skin and was cruising towards another reprimand and Penance. “Go do your work. For once.”
Cas shrugs and reaches for the next box. Dean follows suite. Garth, still bloody, has wandered over with his eye on the last one.
“Don’t have no choice,” Dean growls, making an irritated gesture at the bottle. What would happen if he goes to the bar for a new one? Good god, every bottle in the joint could blow up, or turn to water like some fucking upside down miracle, and they have to be careful now. Very careful. A lot of bad attention is heading their way at mach three velocity.
“Charlie,” says Charlie in a grumbly sort of way without looking up from her screen. Her laptop is chewing over complex squiggles, trying to figure them out without a PhD in Witchery.
Castiel gingerly feels at the bump on his head yet again. His fingers, without any form of order or consent, keep prodding at it as if to measure just how much it still hurts or to see if one more poke might somehow lessen the pain of it. That was one burly demon that caught him in the head with its mace. If he hadn’t been wearing a helmet…
“Scared, you mean?” Dean asked with a hint of irony. “I know the odds. But no. No fears. And no regrets.”
“He said you killed his folks and then- are you even denying you cursed him?!”
Sam’s world turned inside out.
“There are still rogue angels that need to be dealt with. Other matters too. We have decided that angels should no longer go down to earth. It is too confusing down there. We will make an exception for you, since you are...  acclimatized. But you need to be aware…”
“Yeah, I heard.”
“It wouldn’t matter.” Sam still sounds dazed. “He’s not been able to get drunk for months. It’s… Dean, I think the-... er, the thing. It’s cleaning out your blood.”
“Guy accosted Cas!” Jo’s spitting mad. The stranger not only approached a Winchester omega on the sly, he did it in the roadhouse, Ellen’s territory and Jo’s second home.
“Hah! The gang’s all here! Congratulate us, guys!”
“You... meant earlier - with your wish for copulation - you meant with another human. Right...?”
No response.
“Dean?”
“Coward,” Dean said softly as he picked up the split log and set it on the block.
meeting has run him ragged. What if he fell ill in some dark passage and we can’t find him?!'
“Hey, you want a beating, I’ll provide,” Tyler drawls. “But as far as I’m concerned, the man has spoken: he can’t be bothered with you. I’ll stand in for him if you insist. He’s a bit too nice at times, but he’s tougher than ten of you, he’ll do as my alpha. It’s the Campbell blood in him,” Tyler adds, because even now when he’s being supportive and nice, he still has to fit in being a bit of an elitist asshole.
“No we’re not.”
But Benny’s not gonna join her in Ranchers. Dean… he understands Benny; that soft-spoken Cajun is as much a brother to him as Sam is, so he knows. Benny will live and die a hunter because he likes it, he’s very good at it, the Hunter pack is his family, and because if he joins Ranchers, Andrea will be that much closer to taking over the whole shebang and even Benny, who loves her more than his life, knows this would be a Very Bad Thing. Biology’s triage is a strict mistress. Some people are omegas by nature, from their heads and hearts down to their gonads, others are eternal betas and happy with that. And some have the strength, brains and charisma to evolve into leaders, into alphas, and the kind of character that’d lead the pack straight off a cliff…
“I think this will turn out to be a valuable growing experience for him,” Cas said serenely.
“...th’fuck…”
“Yes, yes,” Dean says shortly, flapping his hand to peremptorily shoo away his putative savior from the conversation, “I’ll make sure I got the right person this time, and I’ll reward them and give them anything they ask for that’s mine to give, they can have a fortune, they can take over the royal hospice tomorrow, hell, they can join the nobility if they’re not completely insane, and maybe end up on the throne one day. But they can’t have my heart. That already belongs to somebody else.”
“Smells good,” the man adds, but his eyes have drifted back to the dish on the table and now he doesn’t sound quite so honest. “Er, what cut of beef did you use? Or some kind of sausage meat?”
“The number of fingers you were holding up earlier.” Dean struggles and eventually gets to his feet on his own, ignoring Charlie’s exasperated sigh. Yeah, Dean knows he’s a hard guy to take care of, but that comes with the territory. In the future, once this shit-show is finally over, he’ll get Charlie and Cas together for drinks and commiseration, Dean’s tab.
“Suck it, bitch. And go away. I’m gonna kiss this guy again, which was what we were in fact doing before your barged in,” Dean declares with a jagged smirk, before putting words into action.
“I beg your pardon?”
“Sucks,” Dean summarizes. “Hey,” he adds in reaction to Swan Prince’s slightly put out air, “you’d be surprised how often shit like this happens on our continent. Pliny the Really Old called us the Land of a Thousand Kingdoms in his Histories, which sounds awful pretty and all, but let me tell you, it’s really just one thousand flavors of weird magical problems. You can’t ride three days in any direction without tripping over some nasty old spell, curse or monster. Trust me, I know; in the past fifteen years, I’ve travelled from Saxony to the far east, from the Blood Red Sea to the endless Twisting Steppes, and I’ve dropped by that bedlam of Fairy Land a dozen times to boot. You wouldn’t believe the stuff I’ve seen. So, in your particular case, what did it for your kingdom?”
Dean gets distracted from the way his liver his reconstituting itself (uncomfortably) and finally thinks to glance up at whatever - or rather, whoever - is pulling him out of the Pit and back to life willy nilly.
“Yes.”
“You've changed.”
“Blackbirds,” Dean said, hand covering his mouth.
“While you’re down there, we have other matters we would like you to attend to on our behalf.”
Victor goes to salute Kate, and John’s crusty features break into a more genuine smile as he helps Bobby with the small beer keg the latter is carrying. They’re old friends.
“Brother,” said one of the trackers. “I don’t think this human can help. We are going to return to our quarry.”
She gestures over the red candle, burning, sputtering and dripping big fat globs of pungent wax onto the cat’s skull it’s using as a holder. The candle flame goes out and the pain abates.
with the maker of this curse.” Dean can honestly not tell if she wants to congratulate the guy or crucify him. Right this minute, Rowena herself sounds like she’s on the fence.
“I’ll be fine.”
Someone nailed a cross to a fence post above a memorial shrine of wilted flowers and rain-warped photos. A reminder that it’s all well and good kicking against the pricks, but like death and car accidents, the fucking Host is out there, they’re a reality Cas has to deal with, and Dean’s not sure how much leeway his angel has to argue with the others. That’s another thing that keeps him from really putting his foot down.
The convulsing hellspawn drops Dean, who lands hard on his back with a ragged groan. But he’s alive, he’s alive. Castiel quickly looks around the beach, sees no other demons. Dean himself took care of most of them before the angel arrived, and thank their Father that Castiel was there to finish off the remainder. Now-
“Do you remember what it is?”
Next chapter sees a change of venue and things get iiiinteresting ^__^ Though it might get delayed,  or the next one might, depending on how much real-life work gets dumped on me and how much sleep I forgo (kudos and comments encourage my insomnia!)
...When Cas had ‘stopped the sun’, Dean had slapped ‘bible shit’ on that and walked away without thinking. This sounded more subtle and more complicated and a lot more
Cas glances at his brother’s face a little sadly before focusing back down on the snow. He massages his forehead with his gloved fingertips. “I appreciate what you’re trying to do - and the knowledge you’ve recovered. If you want me to- to read journals, if you have any here-”
The next second they were in the garrison’s loft, which had been quickly reconverted into a courtesy office for the Seraph grounded here, and which Castiel had promptly given over to Balthazar, to the other’s evident satisfaction in the face of general disapproval. It was a large room with high ceilings, void of any decorations or furniture since angels did not require any and this was not a room set up to host human visitors.
“How? How are you tracking him?”
Cas finally meets Dean’s eyes. What Dean sees reflected in his old friend’s stare surprises him. Dean knows that look well. All too well. That’s the look of pure, unadulterated anger.
“Don’t – you – ever – do that – to me – again!”
Dean opened them to a motel room with plasticized curtains and yellowing floral bedspreads.
Things aren’t fitting together. The more he thinks about the pain, the more it hurts and the more it hurts, the more he thinks about it. He lifts his head and stares for a moment at the shut laptop. Highlighted roadways crawl over a bird’s eye of Kansas in his mind.
“We don’t hate you,” says Sam with a sigh.
“Charlie!” Dean’s never told anyone what Cas first said to him. It always seemed a little weird. A little private. He’s overreacting, he knows it, but it still doesn’t feel like the kind of sentiment you just throw out casually. Dean doesn’t always acknowledge it, but he’s unfailingly grateful for all that Cas has done for him. Cas didn’t just save him from the cage. Cas saved him from himself. He shudders to think what he would have become had he stayed in that godforsaken place.  Charlie grimaces and looks regretful.
I am the worst. But thanks for sticking it out with me anyway. Here it is! The fourth chapter! And do I sense the hint of a plot emerging from the fluff??? Can it be????? Oh my! Shocking! (I'm pathetic.)
. Please don’t hate me.” Charlie looks up through her eyelashes and bats them in what Dean considers a fairly accurate impersonation of a Disney princess. Not that he’s ever seen a Disney princess film… more than once… maybe twice…
Charlie is speaking with Cas in a newly serious manner about his preferences in fabric and color. Dean and he share a momentary connection. They don’t say anything. They just lock eyes and Cas smiles slightly with the side of his mouth. Dean smiles back and nods. Cas needs this. Dean gets it. Only this morning he was admiring his own identifiers – the Led Zeppelin album on his bureau, the guns racked on the walls, the pictures he’s finally rescued from the depths of his wallet sitting in frames around his very own room. He’s lived a life devoid of ownership before. He’s hid beneath the shadows of others and neglected his own desires. He doesn’t want the same thing to happen to Cas.
"Arrive at destination."
“Oh.”
“How old is the kid again?” he asks.
“Me? Uh, no. Well – yes.
Charlie snorts and puts a hand over her face.
“No! Yeah! I’m – ahem, fine. I’m good.” Sam smiles with his lips shut and Dean returns the gesture.
“Make sure to leave some for Cas…” and even as Dean says this he notes how strange the lack of the former angel’s presence is. Cas hasn’t been adjusting to sleep so well. As such, he’s normally the first person in the kitchen each morning and the last person to retire in the evening. But Dean hasn’t even seen him awake yet – puttering around the library, or tracing over the borders of countries with a single finger on the control room map. Cas puts up a good front. After the first week of inaction he began to religiously groom himself before joining their company. He showers each morning. He dresses neatly and immediately. Dean wonders if Cas even
“That said,” says Dean with a frown. “The looming over me thing… I’m not gonna lie, it’s pretty creepy.”
Cas looks taken aback, but answers. “34 when I first asked him to allow me in, why?”
“Eat as much bacon as you can stomach,” Sam says soothingly as he takes his seat next to Kevin. “The fat’ll soak up the alcohol. Trust me. Bacon got me through my first semester at Stanford.”
. I write a lot of rants and meta and post a lot of fandom nonsense. So feel free to check it out if you're into that kind of thing and also wouldn't mind knowing where I am in the writing process while you're waiting for the next installment.
“Let’s at least talk to him first. Maybe there’s an explanation to this that doesn’t end in shackles.” Sam opens his eyes and looks up through his eyebrows at his older brother.
I don't own Supernatural. I don't own these characters. I don't own a calender either, apparently.
You’ll get wet and cold, there are unknown monsters about, and there is a very good reason you shouldn’t run around in a thunderstorm, were all very valid objections to this behavior that stayed lodged in Castiel’s throat where they twisted, almost solid as they lay there, something that both hurt and tingled pleasurably as he watched his husband laugh in the rain. That feeling... it seemed to start in his vessel and spear right into his higher being as if they were both pinned by the sensation, a good/bad ache he didn’t understand.
Oh, good one, thought Castiel in the privacy of his own mind. “I presume it was the baby badger that the gamekeeper took home to his son? Not a full grown animal?”
“Oh, he’s not here. Demonic energy can interfere with the spell, so it was best he stayed away.”
Silence descends upon the two teams, tension touching them like a live wire. It’s early morning, the sun still snagged on the low-hanging branches of surrounding trees, and they are only one hour away from the mining camp; to find a foreign force so close is a shock to the system. The Hunters move quietly through the sparse woods, following those tracks. Five guys. Could be a hunting party from another pack, but this is Winchester territory; foreign hunters would not come without a polite request, they’d not move around without frequently cutting their pack mark into tree bark to signal themselves, they’d leave promptly once they realized where they’d trespassed. These guys… Dean glances over his shoulder and easily finds the plume of smoke rising from the wintering cabins chimneys and hanging in the early morning air a few miles away; there’s no way the strangers missed that, they have to know there are people close by. But instead of coming forward and making themselves known, the prints, heading this way from the direction of Coppertop Hill, swing to the west to circle the mining area in a long meandering itinerary. Which is odd. If they’re trying to be discreet, hoping to hightail it out of here without getting spotted, they’re going about it in exactly the wrong way.
sprouting from his goddamn
“They got somewhere in mind?” John asks after digesting the news a bit.
“No, dear,
”...Where else am I supposed to recuperate?”
The angel nods once. He has spent the last nineteen hours in planes or airports, and the last five minutes trudging through the long-term parking lot, he has little patience to talk with mortals. Especially uniformed ones. They tend to be tedious.
Break it down here. Dean Winchester, the guy who chased every skirt and tail that’d let him, was married. Humans liked to officialize their weddings in temple before their congregation, but it didn’t matter that there was less than a snowball’s chance in hell he’d get the angel in a white dress standing before Pastor Jim anytime soon. At the end of the day, if the Machine said he was married, then goddamn, Dean was married. That was already pretty crazy; only one human in five ended up finding a soulmate and Dean had comfortably assumed he was too ornery to ever meet someone who could put up with him. And who did the Machine decide was Dean’s perfect match made in Heaven? Hmm? Oh yeah. An
It’s probably stupid, but Dean keeps looking after the bitch for another month until it’s time to choose under John’s stern gaze and Kate’s encouraging one.
Yes, it was odd, he’d thought this Paradise dangerously overpopulated initially, but other than the man who’d made tea and a couple of humans sitting at the farthest table, pretending not to stare at him as they made a hash out of their knitting, there was no-one around. The kiln’s fire was burning out and nobody seemed keen to walk over and keep it fueled.
Tom’s eyes flickered left-right and then centered on Dean. “Seems like a smooth operation.”
“Yeah, and I’m looking right at it. Damn, Bobby, you scared me half to-”
“Did you wait thirty minutes before you contacted me? Are you certain there’s no angel activity?” the voice asked tersely.
“Uh-uh. Okay, coffee.”
done,” said Cas, not too strenuously, more like one knowingly fighting a losing battle. “All those other friends of hers who came in and out today to help must have tracked in more dirt than we cleaned away.”
Then the blue eyes narrowed and Dean realized they’d been wide in surprise and a growing fury. Not the glazed-eyed stare of a dying man. Cas being an angel (of course).
A wave of his grace restores the autonomy of her nervous system, and takes the remains of befuddlement out of Charlie’s psyche. He keeps himself interposed between Rowena and Robert just in case, but both women ignore him as they scramble towards each other, both intent on helping the other up. Castiel lets them manage and strides towards Dean. The hunter is struggling to sit despite the terrible cuts and contusions to his abdomen, and the concussion making his world hopelessly spin.
“I’ll lead the way,” says Swan Prince, putting a decided foot ashore.
“Right. Be it as it may, I don’t think he wishes to pursue etiquette lessons with you, and I am way too busy to take over today.”
A hand reached down, fastened on his collar and pulled him up.
”...Right.”
“But- but how-…”
“We always sluice them off outside the sheds, but every once in awhile one of us has to go give them a good scrub. I drew the short straw.”
“Save your breath,” Dean says easily. “Vic’s team is on scouting detail today, my job is to look after the convoy in general and you in particular.”
“You don’t believe in that,” Cas shot back, gaze still nailed to the ground. His mouth twisted on the words as if they’d tasted sharp and bitter on his tongue for a brief moment he was now intent on denying.
“Dadadadadada.” Apparently Robbie is trying this new noise on for size.
“Hmm. Now that you mention it…” The hunter sweeps up his laptop and clicks through information and emails at top speed. “You know, I think Hannah may be right. There have been demon signs here and there, more than usual… it’s subtle, but if Heaven’s picked up on something -” Sam’s face goes dark as he remembers that the Winchesters and Heaven are currently on the out. For a moment dangling like a sword on a thread, he almost looks ready to refuse to help out of principle, but then he focuses on his screen and presumably remembers who the greater evil is. “Hmm. They don’t know what the demons are planning?”
”-I didn’t think they even went any higher than the 390s.”
Dean snorts. “You never met teenage Sammy, or you’d know that there is no offence large enough that he didn’t deserve back then, the long-haired leggy brat.”
Dean watched Balthazar stroll off in a southwesterly direction. There’d been something awake in the angel these past few weeks, he only realized it now when he saw it gone. Like the color had been drained out of him now. Dean hesitated... but what could he say? I’ll keep him safe? I’ll bring him back? Dean Winchester had done a lot of dubious things in his life, but he was not deliberately going to make a promise he could in no way be sure to keep.
“We ain’t so happy about it ourselves. Specially when Uriel’s knuckles end up in contact with my kidneys. And we shouldn’t
“Yup. The kid knew John better than you did, Seraph.”
“Was that before or after he kicked you out for being a manipulative bitch?”
But Winchesters, blood or adopted, don’t talk about shit like that.
“Didn’t he text you?”
“Gur,” Dean said, or at least that is what he would remember saying later.
“I didn’t, brother, but the Joker did. Don’t worry, he’s fine. You have my word.”
Dean sniffs scornfully - managing to reposition the bottle his boy spat out for reasons best known to himself. The gumming action starts up again almost immediately, the brat is still hungry, he’s just being contrary with the bottle. “I’m fine. C’mon, Charlie, this is me. I can stake out monsters for weeks with nothing more than a catnap of three hour in every forty eight, you think I’m gonna buckle under the pressure of watching a kid no heavier than an unloaded shotgun? Give me a break and go take a nap.”
“Tomorrow - and hell, every day until Christmas - I’ll beat your ass black and blue, Cole, but tonight we have more important shit to deal with than putting down puppies. Right now, we need a leader, and one who thinks with something other than his balls or his fists.”
Charlie's tapping up a storm on her screen. “Hmm?”
For a glorious second of free-fall, he thought he’d made it - maybe with a broken ankle, but he’d made it-
“M’fine. I’ll make my way home in a minute.”
Winter set in, and Castiel found more ways to fall short of the expectations of what Dean’s consort should be, expectations set by the better, more beloved Lisa, no doubt. Dean loved to tell jokes; Castiel didn’t get them. The few jests Castiel knew also fell flat, either because they were based on some cunning use of a long-dead language or because he always blew the delivery. Dean loved weapons and horses; Castiel could fence and ride quite well but didn’t actually care about the subjects that much, seeing them as merely a means to an end. Dean loved to eat, particularly sweet crust pastries; Castiel had Crowley up his sleeve, he was confident he could provide his husband with such pleasures, but he himself didn’t share them. He was a bit of an ascete, and when he ate complicated dishes, he found his mind chasing down and identifying the various flavors (and accounting for the cost of the ingredients) rather than actually enjoying them.
“With prussic acid. And a slice of lemon.”
stories imaginable for their winter fireside storytelling fodder, the ‘love at first scent’ kind that makes Dean cringe, especially when he catches people talking amongst themselves in low voices, then looking at him and a bemused Cas before giggling a lot. A disgruntled Dean is ready to hunt down a bear in its den, kill it with his bare hands and wear its bloodied hide back to camp if that’ll restore his Badass image and stop teenagers coming up to him to ask in a breathless way, “So, did you just look into his eyes that first night and
Warning for blood and battlefield surgery. Pretty tame compared to some of my other stuff... Also, as the warning implies, things heat up!
- there had to be a word greater than ‘complicated’ for these tangled bags of flesh, soul and free will.
“Whoa!” Dean instinctively caught him by the elbow, and then around the waist as Cas listed to the right. It was only for a few seconds, the angel managed to straighten up, but there was something heavy and off about his movements.
Pretty much since the day Sam could talk in full sentences, it’s been obvious the kid’s brighter than Dean by far. More than that, Sam’s got this- this inner light, this charisma thing going. And that’s fine, Dean’s proud of him, damn proud, no ifs, ands or buts. It’s only occasionally that in the shadow of this great pride lurks that ill-bred varmint full of hurt and loneliness, a nasty jealous rodent who’s seen everyone - his dad, Kate, Adam, Bobby, everyone - treat Sam like the second coming, like his prickly temper and bitchiness are the signs of intellect, independence and greatness, while Dean’s been relegated to ‘good soldier’, the reliable one who'll follow orders and needs no further concern. Now it's not that Dean covets the primary alpha position, Christ no, he'd run a mile if you tried to pin that on him. That’s got nothing to do with it. It’s hard to put into words exactly how Dean feels about it, really, he’s not great at chalking his own thoughts that much. He just knows that every time in the past week he’s seen Sam and Cas head down in deep discussion, he’s had this inky black foreboding that Cas, like everybody else, will quickly conclude that here is the more interesting of the Winchester brothers, and split his time and attention accordingly. And hell, makes sense, right? In the years to come, Cas is going to be working closely with the primary alpha, and that’ll eventually be Sam. Why would Castiel Novak waste his time on a hunter for? It’s not like Dean’s gonna be lighting up Winchester pack with electric doodads in the future. He’ll just be hauling back deer carcasses all his life until something bushwhacks him and another beta takes over.
His intent is on Lutecia; take that one out of the equation and whatever else may befall, Dean will be a whole lot safer.
“I don’t know. Maybe the Machine Himself decided it wasn’t fair.” He gave a snort.
Dean passed by a few tables with a smattering of people sitting at the benches, breakfasting or starting little projects. Nobody he recognized, so he kept his gaze straight ahead, aiming himself at Maurice’s little chuckwagon. Maurice was absorbed in a book, sitting on his stool same as most days, dressed in well-pressed cream cotton shirt, bow tie, red floral brocade vest and trousers, his moustache neatly pomaded to clean points. Though he didn’t wear a hat or cap, Maurice was not one of the sheep, and certainly not one of the loafers either; he took pride in both his appearance and in preparing little snacks and treats for his neighbors who visited Kiowa.
Still looking at his husband’s face, Dean eased down to his knees between Cas’s legs. He teased at the pants, pulling down slowly, tugging a little against Cas’s weight when he got to where they were pinned to the covers- then groped wildly and snapped his head down to stare. The cloth beneath his fingers had abruptly vanished. Cas was sitting naked on the edge of the bed as if he did this all day long, his pants nowhere to be seen.
Castiel has asked himself that self-same question, standing at the edge of the road with smoke hanging over the scene like a mourning veil. He still doesn’t have an answer. But his lack of answer is in itself a response.
“I- Im sorry, in perfect innocence!”
Cas catches him by the shoulder and pulls them back together before Dean, a little alarmed, can lean away further to look at his face in more detail. “I just mean, don’t use that word. ‘Mated’ is a ridiculous term, primal- slavishly adherent to the Animal Model. Just say that we’re in a long term commitment between two consenting adults, instead."
Though he welcomed her to the castle on his son’s behalf, some said king John had disapproved of a commoner aspiring to be queen. Once Dean was off to war again, John had made her life miserable by demanding impossible feats: hosting a dinner without a purse, weaving gold from straw and such. Tasks that a spirited but relatively inexperienced lass couldn’t possibly master, not without the benefit of dancing singing magical mice or some other sort of phenomena that Dame Ellen’s meticulous housekeeping forbade. More rational storytellers painted the tale with a darker gloss. By her very existence, Lisa was robbing Dean and their war-torn kingdom of a marriage alliance with another country when they needed it most. Even with John’s support, her reception amongst the nobility would have been chilly, and perhaps even dangerous. It wouldn’t be the first time in history that an inconvenient fiancée had been removed from the political chessboard through calumny, hostility or a drop of poison. Whatever the reason, Lisa abruptly renounced the betrothal and disappeared into the night.
He was sitting by a campfire that he’d lit for both warmth and light. It was noon according to his old pocket-watch, but it was as dark as soot. One of the many weird things that had happened in the past two years. So many weird things occurred on a daily basis that one hardly even took much note of them anymore, once categorized as fatal or non-fatal. A man appearing next to Colt out of thin air barely raised an eyebrow from the tired people around them, though a few shuffled away just in case smiting was in the offing.
And you involved my
your car?” the official asks, surprise and relief lightening his voice.
Lydia’s unmated, but this kind of boiling froth of betas here, with their previous alpha fallen and the other alpha having stepped back, that produces all kinds of strange chemistry. This is where biology takes over from the nicer, more human ways of doing things. If Lydia can stomp down hard enough on Cas, she might take advantage of a rather unfortunate timing; Cas hasn’t been a beta all that long, few of the Hunters actually know him, and he and Dean have only been mated three months, they’re still in the binding period. Dean’s heart belongs to Cas, but his body, oh, his body is heading towards alpha, the touchpaper was lit three days ago already. So Cas
“Knew it. From the minute that hair came in on his chin. Sooo obvious you were done for, Dean.”
...Or not.
Cas turns, takes a step towards his bag and toolbox, but then he makes it a one eighty to face John again. He licks his lips, hesitates.
“I’m sorry. I know you don’t understand. But I could not stand by, Dean. I saw what they can do. I will not let humans fall prey to one of these creatures again,” Castiel concludes, and he
...but chains sunk into the deepest part of his heart bound him there, staring at the depth of Dean’s revealed feelings, the honest worry without a hint of anger or disappointment or suspicion… This is unworthy of you, sermoned his conscience, but Castiel just couldn't stop.
“Nobody knew this until now. I held this one detail back for just this reason, to make sure some pretty face in a white dress wasn't going to try n’ play me for a fool. Not even Sam or Bobby knew about this to start with, and they still don’t know the exact detail, the crux of the matter. Only I do. And you, apparently.”
was Cas, more than the man walking around that Dean usually addressed by that name.
“Bartholomew.” Cas was unreadable as he turned around. “You didn’t need to come and meet us in person.”
“Language!” Bobby rapped out. “That I did not teach him, if you want to know,” he groused in the direction of the angel.
“Uriel, did you decide to bring the advocate yourself this time? How considerate.” Balthazar sauntered over, pretending not to notice the look of pain and the bruises on Sam’s face.
“Castiel, I- it’s Dean, I need your-“
“Absolutely not,” Ellen rapped out, coming back to her larger-than-life self with a jolt. “Here, I’m sending you to the kitchens. We have some old bread, cheese and watered beer set aside for the teamsters, take it out to them and tell them they can pray peacefully in the farrier’s yard in the bailey. It’s what our prince would want. Tell Crowley to give you what you need or I will paste him upside the head. I-”
Dean was out the door as soon as he heard the hiss-bang behind him, knowing that would catch the Seraph’s attention for a few precious seconds.
There were times he thought his best bet would be to leave in the dead of night, sail to the far, far north and make some kind of living with Gabriel. But ultimately Castiel's sense of duty forbade it. Maybe his kingdom didn’t need him, and his family certainly didn’t, but Castiel was born a prince, it was his duty to stand by his land and liege until his death.
Dean cocks his head, appearing puzzled by the curt monosyllable. “So why are you still lollygagging in the sheets?”
It wasn’t what he said, it was the way he said it. Slowly, as if putting the words together one at a time like paving stones in a path leading forward. And the way he had, perhaps unconsciously, reached for Dean’s hand even as they both faced Gabriel. Dean felt something uncharacteristically warm go through his middle, which was normally more comfortable with anger, violence and cynicism. What Cas had said could be construed as, ‘I just do what Dad tells me to’, but the slow way he’d said it told Dean, at any rate, that what Cas was really saying was, ‘I’ve decided to stand alongside my ol’ ball and chain, and I’m just finding a way to justify my decision that ensures I’m not actually betraying the other person in my life I care about.’ It was a lot to get out of just a few words and fingers arounds his own, but angels could accomplish miracles, and the intriguing otherworldly puzzle that was Cas had miraculously taught Dean to read between the lines in a way that would leave Sammy, the communicator in the family, standing at the gate. Well, hot damn…
“This situation doesn’t compare,” Castiel feels obliged to point out. “I was blindly following orders that were bringing about the End of times. Now we have full disclosure, and all we’re trying to do is bring our brothers and sisters home.”
“Yeah. Just cruel, innit? The dispersing, I mean. We all pack around Annabelle after it’s done, take her hunting, help her shake it off. And Vic too, us guys, higher betas, me n’ Benny n’ Tyler, we take him and get him drunk, just a bit. But it’s gotta be done, right? I mean, if we kept our kids and didn’t swap ‘em with other packs, then hello inbreeding.” He scritches Ginny, making her turn her head into the gesture while her white tail wags like mad. “Nothing but a hundred lil’ Winchesters and Henricksons and Cuevas running around, all tryin’ to be alpha I bet.” Any way you cut it, it’d be the apocalypse all over again.
“You can?”
Dean gaped at the ordinary stone posts and lintel, and the darkness beyond. “... For real? Like, the real deal?”
Dean snorted. “Good luck with that.” Then he leaned to the left and looked over in the direction of the kiln. “Huh, now it’s your family’s turn.”
Well now, Dean’s in his right to expect the worst, since it does seem to happen to him so very regularly, but if the rest of creation is waiting for Castiel to perform an angel’s duty… then it can wait a very long time. Castiel awkwardly fumbles his blade back into his coat with one hand, then shushes the scared child, letting the small forehead rest against his shoulder and chin so the little boy can hide from the world and all the dead bodies around them.
better than nothing, so much more than an unfruitful prince of an eccentric disposition might have expected out of a political marriage, that Castiel at times found himself to be almost, if not quite, content. Buried in duty, invisible when the castle ran well, at the center of the problem when it ran poorly, tired, worn and his heart, foolish thing, still yearning for the unattainable, but yes, overall, he could lay down at the end of most days and call himself content. And he would be so until the end, when he would lay down his duties for good and go to his eternal rest.
Yet even now he can’t bring himself to speak. No, he does not want Dean’s gratitude, yet he does not want to give up his secret either. Reason comes to the fore belatedly; another Lutecia could show up one day - someone a little smarter who would attempt to use divination or some magic trick to obtain that secret word, that intangible proof, and then Castiel would need his knowledge to counter it. It’s a perfectly valid reason, it makes sense, but it’s not at all what moves Castiel to remain silent now. No. Just like a gold coin still hanging around his neck - a coin returned to him on that night ten years ago when two bodies became one, never to truly sunder - this knowledge belongs to him, it is precious and not to be deliberately thrown away even if he will never, ever need it and will certainly never use it in this lifetime.
...Dean and Castiel looked at each other, then at Panic and Pudding swapping bromancy back thumps. Then the angel and the demon looked at each other again. Castiel closed his eyes and let his head thunk back against the broken wall Dean had propped him up against.
Luke gives Dean a vaguely triumphant look that suggests Dean’s gone and proven the bastard right in his approach all along.
That was so... vastly incorrect that it left Castiel to fall back on a more easy conclusion. “Babies are not an option.”
“And?”
“You should know what I said to the person who saved me that day.”
The muscles in Cole’s jaw bulges and his fists leap up. “Right. You’re right. We do this the right way. Come forward, Winchester! I’m calling you out!”
A clarion call in the distance heralds the end of their current savage entertainment. Dean makes an aggrieved “aww!” echoed by Jo and a few of the other younger Hunters, but Castiel, who is responsible for all their lives, does feel relieved.
froze Castiel to the bone.

“You have duties before the noon.”
Balthazar’s blood ran cold, so to speak. Normally Uriel dragging in a human with Sam Winchester in tow meant hours of entertainment, as Uriel tried to do that job he loved so much - ie, harry and hurt humans until he somehow single-handedly dismantled the resistance  - while Sam found a million reasons why it went against the decrees. Granted, it wasn’t high theater, or even a burlesque, but Balthazar had learned to take his amusement where he could.
He gasped and looked in horror-... but instead of crushing the delicate mechanisms, the tablets just lay there, one of them getting nudged aside incrementally by a filigree-fine hair spring, the others failing to do anything spectacular.
“Yes Dean.” Pah-Ne-Me darts away. Her hound Shú-n-Ta is already ahead of her sniffing the ground carefully. Not sure if the dogs will signal a trap beneath the snow. They might, if the things stink of sulfur, gunpowder or whatever made it explode. If only Wákida was still with Vic… Clancy’s not come out on this expedition, he’s still too little for all this snow. Vic didn’t have a sharp nose to warn him, or a dog walking ahead who might have tripped the trap in his stead. Losing a dog is tragic, but better than losing their alpha.
“The spheres are not meant to mix like this.” Chuck waved a vague finger around as if stirring a stew. “It unbalances everything. Angels are great defenders and warriors, but they’re, ah, pretty straightforward. Humans need free will in all its nuances, it’s what they were made for. Normally your species are kept mostly apart - and the Purgatory critters, and the demons. But when I got smashed and lost my tablets, well, my function was lessened and things became fluid.”
Bobby drew up near Rufus and dug his watch out of his vest’s pocket. “This goldurned contraption must be running early, because it can’t possibly be eight.”
Rufus, sitting low on an old milking stool, read the note, then looked straight up at Dean. “I had no idea this was coming.”
being confoundedly, almost endearingly boneheaded and blunt, and sort of helpless in the face of the human drama the poor sap had found himself plunged into against his will. Since Cas wasn’t hurting Dean, and had even gone to some lengths to protect him, Sam was slowly making his peace with this crazy state of affairs, a bit like the southwest city quarter around him. He had not yet re-conquered his calm and his routine, but he was pretending everything was
Above the archway, the clock ticks and tocks, and the hand nudges towards 7:35.
“Uh?”
The rest got damp, ink ran.”
Eventually Dean cleaned away all signs of rampant sin, brewed some decree-approved herbal tea and put a scone on a plate for his brother.
He squats, thinking his boy just needs to see the water up close to lose his fear of it.
Castiel follows the motion from the corner of his eye, then turns fully to evaluate the way Jonah now stands, his pose, the tilt of his chin, the smirk on his features hiding a little uncertainty.
“...I have some concerns about Sam. He’s told you about this hunter named Smith?”
“No.”
It’s still the first day of being mated, they have an hour before dinner with Kate and John and Dean’s brothers, and the two new mates are wandering around the hunter compound hand in hand looking for people who might not know the happy news yet in order to tell them. It’s possible the two of them are a little high on those ‘hormone’ things Cas is so keen on, which are making their mating more and more permanent every hour and every day from now on, like cement setting. So far they told half the Makers and most of the Hunters, and Cas just remembered Garth. They definitely need to tell Garth, he’ll be over the moon.
Castiel stood there blinking like a duncecap before recalling that he’d only heard complines rung on the bells of nearby St Bibiana a short while ago. There was still a dash of light beyond the fortifications so- “No, I suppose not.”
“Well… it’s probably the light. Here, let’s go to the window.”
“Thank you, brother,” said Zachariah, visibly ruffled. Then he gestured abruptly. Dean staggered as he found himself fully dressed. “I suggest we keep him like this - decent and
Indeed, how hard could it be to pry a young boy away from the father he adored, riding, hunting and learning to fence before running wild with all the other children, their leader in most of their juvenile mischief… and instead dedicate himself to history and heraldry in order to master the most important position in the kingdom that would be his one day? Right. Castiel was not, as a whole, a naive man, but he’d not had any exposure to children before, certainly none like Prince Benjamin.
failure. They had failed their Father and the Plan he’d entrusted to them.
Cas got the hang of snow-shoeing at some point yesterday, keeping up okay as the convoy reached the mining site, but, collapsed on an empty coalbox in the wintering cabin, he still looks like something long dead and dragged back to a wolf den. This morning Dean dangled the possibility he could ride a mule, just for a while, but Cas didn’t waste a breath on even a short ‘no’. Because he’s that stubborn, and because there are assholes like Lydia in Vic’s team and Cole in Dean’s who’d love to make ‘lazy Rancher’ or ‘weak Maker’ cracks. Cas won’t give ‘em the satisfaction, or let down those of his Hunter friends who believe he’s already as tough as any of them, being the mate of Dean Winchester and all... Cas is dogged. Dean’s inner beta approves, but that puts him into conflict with the rest of Dean who wants to wrap Cas up in warm cotton wool and carry him everywhere for the next few days. Fortunately Cas doesn’t have to do any digging or heavy lifting at the mine, he’s here to ‘improve the process’, his usual shtick. And since he’s now a beta, Jesse promptly put him in charge of mining operations and the omega workers. Nicomi LaPaire, the Maker’s usual beta handler for mining, is staying home this year; she’s getting a little too old and arthritic for long winter treks, bless her heart.
Dean and Ben conspired to spoil him that afternoon, and Castiel let them. They dragged him, settee and all, to a spot by the fire with furs over his lap and a mantle around his shoulders, where they fed him beef tail consomé which was apparently good for the blood and fainting fits. Then Ben read to him from
“Sammy drove me crazy for years.”
The words ‘under attack’ rise like the tide, carried by waves of different voices. And there’s the smell of course. Sulfur. Olefiant gasses. Rot. Corruption.
“You love me for it.”
The bar was Dean’s idea, of course, but from the way Cas had lit up when he’d first mentioned it, he’d known he didn’t have to worry about Cas not being on board. And then when Cas had compared the idea to Harvelle’s, Dean had swelled with pride at the thought of following in the path of the Roadhouse. From there, things had moved too quickly for doubt to really settle in. It had just so happened that Garth knew someone who would rent a building to them in Ottawa. The space had definitely been in need of some work, but it had promise, and the sunny little apartment that took up the second floor was an added bonus. Just like that, he and Cas had packed up what they wanted to take from the bunker and moved right in, filling their days with handiwork and orders and a million other things that wouldn’t even have occurred to Dean to do until it was clear they were necessary steps in opening a business.
“No, I just—” Dean sighs and turns to rifle through the first aid kit for the butterfly bandages. “Maybe I panicked a little. But can you blame me for worrying about you?”
do something else.” Cas speaks slowly, like he’s measuring Dean’s reaction to each word. “
Dean’s quiet for a minute as he thinks this over. It’s just the sort of thing he’s always thought about Sam—that he deserves to get out and choose another kind of life—but he’s never quite felt entirely deserving of that himself. The way Cas puts it makes it seem so straightforward, though. All his life he’s been playing a role in some cosmic game, and now he’s managed to fight his way out of it, and this is his compensation. He’s not sure he really buys that, but something keeps him from dismissing the thought entirely, and that’s not nothing.
It’s been downright domestic lately, and Dean’s man enough to admit to himself how much he enjoys it. With Sam off spending more and more time at Eileen’s—Dean knows that it won’t be long before he decides to move out of the bunker completely, but he doesn’t want to think about that just yet—he and Cas have practically been playing house. Cas had needed time to recover after becoming human, and after going up against Chuck himself Dean hadn’t thought a bit of a vacation sounded too bad either. So their days have become a comfortable routine of cooking and movies and naps and sex, and it’s been pretty damn nice. But starting his days cozied up with a warm, sleepy Cas is definitely one of Dean’s favorite parts.
“Maybe not,” Cas concedes, “but it definitely isn’t helping, either. Come on. Just humor me. We’ll figure this out later.”
Dean smiles at this, broad and easy. “Yeah. I guess we do.”
No matter the case, it’s obvious that Dean is ill-equipped. It seems that regardless of the exact details, he’s bound to lose Cas. What they have now, no matter how good it is, can only end in heartbreak. This is why it’s been his rule to keep flings short. Any time he gets attached to someone, it ends badly. Surely it’s just plain irresponsible of him to risk Cas in that way. Cas matters too much. And if Dean has any decency at all, he should explain all of this to Cas and just let him go.
Cas shifts, propping himself up so he can see Dean’s face. “Is that how
important thing. And that makes it utterly terrifying.
The sleepy smile that Cas gives him makes his stomach flutter. “I like it too.”
At this Cas turns to wrap his arms around Dean, burying his face in the crook of his neck. His voice is sluggish and rough with sleep. “Stay. Stay and go back to sleep.”
“I’ve thought about it for twelve years, Dean.” Cas’s voice is low and steady, leaving Dean no room to question. “As for being human, I’ll admit that it’s an adjustment. I’m still not used to being tuned out of angel radio. And I worry that without my powers I won’t be of much use to you on hunts. But a life with you is more than I’ve ever dreamed of having. I promise you, Dean, that I’ll stay with you for as long as you want me.”
“Dean, it’s not that bad,” Cas insists, coming to stand behind him. Before he can pause to reply, Dean finally finds the first aid kit.
“Dean—”
He turns to see that Cas’s face is stony, set in what Dean guesses is some combination of fear and grief, if it’s anything like what he’s feeling. He continues quickly.
Cas’s brow furrows. “What do you mean, Dean? Are you talking about
- Dave Malloy, “Epilogue”
What he isn’t used to is waking comfortably and leisurely, rested enough to get up if he wanted to but preferring to keep dozing until the alarm clock goes off. These kinds of mornings have been becoming more common over the last couple of weeks, and while they feel a bit odd, they’re certainly enjoyable. So when he drifts into consciousness now, he only stretches and rolls over in search of the warm body beside him. Pressing himself into Cas’s back and wrapping his arms around him, Dean smiles at the feeling of the former angel relaxing into him. Turns out that human Cas is pretty fond of sleeping, and Dean’s mornings have been getting lazier and lazier as a result. Not that he’s complaining.
“What?”
“Dean? What are you thinking about?”
one is an entirely different story. What the hell made him think he could handle the finances when his primary source of income has always been credit card fraud? How is he, a man who has been wanted by the FBI more than once, now responsible for obtaining licenses and paying taxes? And yeah, it’s not like he’s in this alone. Cas has been an absolute lifesaver in a lot of ways. But in others, it’s the blind leading the blind. Sometimes Dean can’t remember what about this whole thing had seemed like a good idea.
Cas nestles back into Dean, trailing soft kisses down his throat, making Dean’s breath catch. But the tension won’t quite leave him, not entirely. The anxious thoughts have found a handhold in his mind, and they won’t let go. Cas deserves better than this—better than
“I don’t know,” he sighs eventually. “I guess if… if something bad happened to either of us, we’d just have to deal with it in the moment. I don’t know that there’s really a way to prepare for that kind of thing, even if—” Dean swallows thickly, the words sticking in his throat. “Even if it’s likely to happen sooner or later.”
As they weave their way through the cluttered back room, though, Dean can’t resist pausing to poke his head out into the main space. It’s mostly dark, only illuminated by the light from the streetlights coming in through the large front windows, and it’s mostly empty except for a few scattered tables and chairs. There’s a fresh coat of paint on the walls, but nothing else, and the remnants of the paint smell mixes with the scent of sawdust and stale air. Between Dean and the main room is the empty bar that he and Cas had spent days painstakingly refinishing and polishing to a shine. No booze, no glasses, hell, even the taps haven’t been installed yet. There’s so much left to do, and somehow all of that is the easy part.
Forcing the thought to the back of his mind, Dean takes a deep breath and presses a gauze pad to the gash, holding it carefully so he doesn’t hurt Cas. “Hold that there. I’ll clean up the blood so we can see what we’re dealing with.”
options. We could find something.”
“The same has been said about me. Suppose that means we’re well-matched.” Cas lowers his face to press a kiss to Dean’s forehead. “I don’t want you to worry, Dean. But you should never feel bad about it. After everything you’ve been through, I understand why you do.”
“Are you okay?” he asks softly after a moment, though he makes no move to pull away from Cas just yet. “You hurt anywhere else?”
Dean shrugs. “Not really, but I don’t not believe it. You?”
“You’re such a ray of sunshine in the morning.”
“I don’t know,” Cas admits. “I guess I never really thought about it until now. Hunting with you is what I know. And I like helping people. But I don’t like seeing you hurt, seeing you risk your life.”
“I don’t see a problem with that,” Cas says flatly.
“Dean, I have no intention of ending any of this.”
This doesn’t erase the concern from Cas’s expression, but it at least makes him smile a little. He cups Dean’s cheek, and Dean sighs at the familiar feeling of the warm, rough palm.
Cas leans in to press a chaste kiss to his lips. “I love you too, Dean.”
Of course it’s a little silly to be so anxious over a few scrapes and bruises. Dean knows this. It’s not like he’s never seen Cas injured before. He’s even been the cause of those injuries. But it was never a sight that Dean could really stand, even when Cas had his powers and could easily heal himself. And now that he’s human, Cas just seems so… fragile. Yes, he can handle himself perfectly fine in a fight, just as much as Dean can. But that doesn’t stop that deep, uneasy fear from pooling in Dean’s stomach. It doesn’t keep his brain from replaying every horrible time he’s seen Cas dead or dying. So quickly and easily, he could just be gone.
Maybe years from now, when the pain of it all has receded into distant memory, Dean will give Cas shit for only confessing his feelings when he was sure it would kill him. Dean may not be the quickest at processing emotions, especially the big scary ones that he’d spent years pretending didn't exist, but Cas could have at least given him a
