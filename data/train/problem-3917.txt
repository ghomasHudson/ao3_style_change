Couldn’t Dean simply… let Castiel give him this one thing? The only thing Castiel ever truly had to give Dean in the first place, the only thing sad, well-intentioned Castiel had that wasn’t somehow polluted by his past misdeeds: his own life in exchange for a second chance, a tiny extra burst of time snatched surreptitiously out of God’s grasp for Dean to breathe and plan and act and
So, I drew the little picture of Cas in a fit of artistic abundance; I'm not much of a visual artist but I was inspired. ::shrug::
They’ve stopped walking, paused in the long corridor leading to the bedrooms. A long moment passes with Castiel studying Dean’s face from up close, brow furrowed as it is whenever he’s working out a particularly difficult puzzle. Dean sees the moment he decides to abort mission, but Dean’s pre-caffeinated brain is kinda tired of fighting this thing that’s been simmering between them from the very beginning and has, if he’s honest, boiled over since Castiel came storming back into his life like it’s where he’s supposed to be.
But Dean didn’t get to have nice things. Cas saved him. He fell for him, and they met somewhere in the middle, only Dean was too frightened to let the parts of him he thought were delicate and vulnerable out into the light. If it was all out in the open – if he admitted it to
Dean had to also give him a nickname – approaches the box and examines the shiny coins curiously, sniffing at a nickel and giving it a tentative lick. The taste clearly doesn’t agree with him; he shakes his head vigorously and growls and Dean is sure if he could speak Cas would be swearing a blue streak.
“Cas?” Dean calls, turning to look behind him. He can’t believe he didn’t notice Castiel peeling away from the group.
Barista Cas flirts with Dean by writing his number on a napkin, Dean smears it on his face, and Cas has to fess up.
Sam nods, solemn, and hands Dean a small crystal vial, which Dean stuffs carefully into the breast pocket of his jacket. Sam gives him an angel blade next, hilt first, and Dean tucks it away in his sleeve. Finally, Dean watches as Sam hesitates before producing a small, fluffy black feather. He puts it square in Dean’s palm, then closes his fingers over it gently. Dean doesn’t even have to ask; he knows, even though he’s never seen them, this is one of Castiel’s feathers. He wonders how Sam got his hands on it, looking to his brother for any sort of clue.
things, things that are wildly inappropriate for a person to think in public at seven o’clock in the morning on a random Monday.
With a sigh, Castiel carefully folds the panties and holds them, awkward, in his hand. He gathers his courage and marches down the hall, looking for Dean, finding him in his bedroom, sitting at his desk reading with the door ajar. He knocks on Dean’s doorframe, waiting for Dean to look at him and
Speechless, Dean just stares at Cas while silently, Sam slides out of his chair, coffee mug in hand. He offers Dean an awkward smile before he excuses himself from the kitchen, to Dean’s great relief.
“Yes, you are,” Cas says in that dry way of his, and Dean laughs. He’s happy. Like, really happy, happier than he ever thought he could be, than he would even let himself
He gets back to his room, changes into comfortable clothes. It’s then he notices the cassette tape laying nice and square in the middle of his desk, innocuous.
Dean doesn’t know how much time has passed. He’s barely aware of anything at all besides the wall at his back and the ache of his body, cramped in the same position for too long. He thinks he hears something in the bunker, but the world outside this room is… so far away. He’s floating on an island of misery in an endless ocean. Hopeless.
“She really is,” Sam agrees dreamily. Dean has to literally bite his own tongue to keep himself from saying something… inappropriate. He does get it. He sees the way Sam lights up like a fucking Christmas tree any time someone even
“They all do,” Castiel continues, and his cheeks are suddenly flushed bright red. Dean licks his lips and watches Castiel’s eyes follow the motion. He leans down to kiss Castiel, but stops just short of his mouth, a light bulb suddenly coming on in his brain.
“Cas,” Dean interrupts him, exhaling against the dip under Castiel’s throat. “Shut up.” Castiel can feel the smile Dean’s hiding against his skin and decides he is going to take whatever Dean is offering.
Reality crashes in on Dean like a tidal wave, his hopes, foolishly raised, dashed to bits against this answer. He frowns at Jack across the car. “It sounds to me like you’re saying we gotta pick between you stickin’ around or us saving Cas,” he says, incredulous, “’cause I don’t see how we’re gonna get him back without some divine assistance, and no offense, kid, but–”
He loves that having Cas in his arms has taken him from absolutely wolverine-furious to powerfully affectionate in only moments. He loves that Castiel provides him peace, just by being here. Just by staying.
“What the fuck!” he yells, spilling hot coffee all over the counter, when the wriggling shape resolves itself into something resembling a miniscule white snake.
Dean looks at the tape in his hands, turns it over and over, cool plastic warming with his touch. It’s not much and maybe it’s more of Dean than Cas, but it’s still a piece and one Dean didn’t expect to get. He fishes a bottle from the six pack, crosses to his bedside table, digs through the drawer for his (ancient) Walkman and headphones, and gets settled on the bed. Pops the cap on his beer with his ring and the mixtape into the Walkman. Settles his headphones over his ears. Hits play.
Dean closes his eyes, shakes his head. “It wasn’t Billie coming after our people,” he tells them. “It was Chuck. It was Chuck all along.”
“…okay…” Dean says hesitantly, not sure if he’s relieved or terrified to have Cas in the driver’s seat for this little heart-to-heart.
of air hockey), and decided to spend their remaining tickets running through the fun house. Dean thought it was a weird choice until he got inside and saw how many dark corners there were.
“Hey,” he says, nodding over his shoulder down the hall and saying, steam-rolling right over the brain gremlins trying to stop him, “C’mon back to my room. You can sleep there for now.”
He does so now, coming up behind the witch and grabbing him around the waist, hauling him off his feet and throwing him across the room. It’s an impressive show of strength (What? Dean is allowed to notice when his bestie is flexing, sue him), and, what’s more, it breaks the witch’s hold over Dean. He sags to the floor, gasping in air as the last tendrils of magic slough off his shoulders but still on alert, still aware of the danger. He hears a scuffle off to his left and then the tell-tale prickle of magical build-up starts skittering along his arms, a rash of goosebumps following in its wake. Dean looks up in time to see the witch get off one last spell before Sam thunders into the living room and shoots the son-of-a-bitch with a witch-killing bullet.
” and then makes himself conspicuously absent for days at a time. Maybe it’s because he’s started wondering if Cas’ lips would be soft, or dry and chapped like they’ve always looked; he’s started wondering if Cas would kiss him tentative and unsure, or fiery and assertive, or so goddamn tender it’ll make Dean weak in the knees.
“C’mon,” he says, standing up and pulling Castiel after him, tightening their fingers together. “I got all the ‘somethin’ else’ you can handle down the hall.”
. He can’t remember anyone besides family ever taking such an interest in him, in being with him, and clearly wanting to
“Sounds perfect, angel,” Dean murmurs in Cas’ ear. “Sammy’ll probably throw a bitch-fit, but maybe we can get a beehive to go up in there, too.”
When Sam finally nodded at him to do it, Dean surprised even himself by first bringing the jacket stained with Castiel’s blood to his lips. He closed his eyes, breathed deep, and kissed the handprint again before chucking the whole thing into the fire. It went up in a shower of blue-white sparks and the magical energy around them exploded outward, knocking the brothers back as the fire blazed high once more before guttering out like a candle.
“Hey,” Dean says after what feels like a lifetime has gone by. Castiel hums quietly but doesn’t move, and Dean’s grateful he’s not looking Castiel in the eye right now. “You remember when you said, uh. That my, um, heart– called, it–” he coughs, nervous and embarrassed, his voice kinda shaky. He takes a steadying breath and tries again: “You said my, uh, heart called to yours?” he gets out in a rush. He watches the clouds of his breath dissipate into the snowy air.
He starts out slow, standing closer to Cas, thinking fondly of how he had tried (and largely failed) over the years to follow Dean’s guidance on personal space. He crowds into Castiel’s now whenever he can. In the kitchen doctoring their coffees, Dean stands next to Cas and lets their elbows brush. When Cas is at the table typing one-fingered on a laptop, Dean drops a hand on his shoulder and leans over, faces so close as they look at a news article that might be their kind of hinky, their noses would touch if one of them turned. At a diner on the way up to visit Jody and the girls, Dean knocks his foot into Castiel’s under the table and casually leaves it there even after Cas throws a perplexed look in his direction.
Sam looks at Cas’ pale face and shrugs helplessly. “I don’t know,” he says, apologetic. “I think, for now, he’ll be alright, but…”
for chrissake, thinking maybe he should take Sam’s comment about bowerbirds more literally (after he even remembered it and then thought to look them up). The flowers do seem to please the fickle dragon, but even though Cas deigns to take a nap in the basket on Saturday afternoon, the next morning, he’s curled up snug and sound inside Dean’s crockery.
“There’s nothing creepy about it!” Charlie looks around the coffee shop and plants her hands on her hips. “People do it all the time. This is how we live our lives, Castiel. People
The dragon’s face peers up over the rim of the mug, and it looks up at Dean through the world’s tiniest eyelashes. Dean is totally caught, stunned into silence by how his heart just stutter-stalls in his chest.
looking at Castiel, before stomping off towards their picnic blanket set under the shade of a broad oak tree.
He can feel his face turning red, heat licking at his ears, but he’s opened the door and now he’s gotta walk through it.
Dean answers the door with Cas clinging to the inside of his hoodie. When Sam comes forward to hug Dean, Cas pokes his face out of the collar and legitimately
“Mmm, yes,” Cas murmurs, sliding his hands around Dean’s back, digging his fingers in. Dean arches up into him and reaches for a handful of feathers. Cas drops his head to Dean’s shoulder with a groan.
“Cas,” Dean manages, but doesn’t know what to say, overcome by the fullness in his chest even more than the unsettling twist in his gut.
Ever since Cas had been cut off from Heaven, his grace gradually waned, until no spark of angelic æther was left in him. Usually, Dean can easily forget, because Cas is still
laying unmoving on the cold ground. Dean’s got a lump in his throat the size of his fist, and his stomach ties itself into painful knots as he looks between two pieces of the same entity.
It gets worse when Cas’ pain goes beyond the capabilities of his vessel to handle and the piercing static shriek of his true voice ricochets around the room, bouncing off the walls of the witch’s house. Dean and Sam clap hands over their ears as all the windows explode outward in a crashing shower of shattering glass. Castiel starts to blur at the edges, becoming immaterial beneath the grace eddying and swirling around him, forming fantastic shapes in the air.
When Cas steps down into the kitchen Dean glances up. Their eyes meet and Dean offers a weary smile. Castiel seems to take this as permission and sits down to join him.
“Well, basically,” Sam hedges, “it’s a mating bite. Like they, um, bite each other? And then they’re. Well.”
Didn’t matter that he was still walkin’ around. His heart stopped ticking the moment Cas disappeared from the world, smashed to bits, pieces of it scattered over every part of his life that Cas had ever touched.
Dean tries again. “Cas,” he says, dropping his head back to hang heavy between his shoulders. He licks his lip and leans up, taking in Castiel’s glassy-eyed stare, his flushed cheeks, his lips shiny and oh-so-temptingly pinked, and gets that swooping sensation in his gut again.
Decision made, Dean looks back up at the dragon clinging to the side of his house and smiles ruefully. He unlocks the back door and pushes inside, making sure to leave the door open long enough for the dragon to scurry through. When it does Dean pretends he doesn’t notice it wiggling its way down to the floor, where it promptly bolts across open space for the kitchen cabinets. By the time Dean locks up, hangs his coat, and turns back to his haul of groceries, the dragon is nowhere to be seen, but Dean is fairly confident he’ll find it in his mug in the morning.
“Cas…” Dean breathes, a barely-there sound. He clenches his fists to keep himself from reaching out again. But Castiel inches toward Dean as though compelled, and that’s about as much self-control as Dean can muster anymore; something finally gives and he steps into Cas’ space, over that invisible threshold, hands coming up to frame the other man’s face, waiting. When Castiel finally looks up at him, catches his eye, Dean leans their foreheads together, a shaking, relieved breath punching out of him.
“Dean!” Sam shouts, and it sounds like Dean’s hearing him through mounds of cotton balls stuffed in his ears. Sam leaps towards Dean as he collapses back onto the floor, Castiel sprawled out on top of him in an unsightly jumble of limbs. In the air, the inky black gateway flickers and vanishes. Dean drops his head to the concrete floor with a heavy
But Cas seems to have something else to say, now. “Dean,” he begins, treading carefully, “when… Belphagor was– was with us, you told him that Jack was our child.”
Cas pins Dean with the intensity of his stare, grace making his eyes shine in the dimmed lights. Dean opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. His voice sticks in his throat and he tries to swallow it back down, watching as Castiel tracks the motion, his whole body suddenly alight in a way it hasn’t been for years.
honest, before Cas breaks the spell with a disbelieving laugh and throws his arms around Dean, pulling him into a crushing embrace. Cas’ hands grip the back of Dean’s shirt like he’s never gonna let him go, and Dean is one hundred-percent on board with that. He turns his face into Cas’ neck and noses behind his ear, inhaling and reveling in the solid warmth of him, real and here and alive and loving.
He says this out loud as if he’s said it a hundred times before, as if Cas knows what he even means. The dragon pauses and licks delicately at his mouth, looking up at Dean with the crests above his eyes raised. Dean shrugs. “I dunno, it looks nice out today,” he mumbles, feeling suddenly awkward, and then feeling awkward for feeling awkward because, really? It wasn’t like Cas was gonna judge him.
“Good thing Sam’s a gigantor,” Dean says as he laces his fingers with Castiel’s and tugs him along through the throngs of shoppers. They wind their way over to Sam and Eileen, shoulders brushing, sometimes bodies pressed tight together as they squeeze between the oncoming crowd of people.
Castiel reaches up to cover the spot, his broad palm spread over tanned flesh, uncomfortable. He’s silent for long moments, and Dean sits, waiting, wishing he knew more about what was happening to Cas. They’ve known each other for so long, and have so much between them, but somehow Dean still doesn’t know some of the most basic things about angels in general, and Cas specifically. Though, with all that’s happened in the last year, Dean supposes the rules and regs may be different now, anyway.
Dean scowls at his brother. “Sam,” he grinds out, trying to keep his temper leashed. “Is Cas gonna be okay?”
For the most part, Cas keeps to his room, only coming out on occasion to have a snack or take a shower, small human annoyances he tackles with less grumbling than Dean expected to hear from him. It makes Dean’s blood pressure spike, knowing Cas is all fucked up because of him,
But Meg only shook her head at him again and pushed past him. “I don’t want to talk to you right now, Cas,” she growled as she went by, marching towards the front gate of the rec center. Castiel watched, shaken, as Meg mounted her bike and kicked off, out of sight down the bike path before he could even throw on his t-shirt, much less pack up his own towel and the blanket.
Dean shuffles around in the kitchen, getting himself together for a long day of holiday baking and shopping. Why he’d agreed for them to meet up with Sam and Eileen – at a craft market,
on Aaron’s Sega, and Dean thrilled at the idea that he both had a friend he’d made all on his own, and that his dad had
He’s climbed to the top of the hill on the bunker’s eastern side and sits with his arms wrapped around his knees, watching the sun sink into a cushion of oranges, reds, and purples. While he takes in the setting sun, Dean hears the crunch of boots on the frosted earth behind him, but he doesn’t turn, doesn’t acknowledge that anyone’s come to join him. He squeezes his knees closer to his chest.
sure Gabe didn’t dose his coffee this afternoon, but he honestly wouldn’t put it past his boss to slip a psychedelic into Dean’s drink as “payback” for him having to get all the stupid croissants ready to go by himself this morning.
Dean sits, Cas’ weight against him, as goosebumps chase each other down his body, head-to-toe. He thinks, for a minute, that he should feel more troubled by this information, because, really, how is this even a thing that could happen? What possessed Castiel to even… even
Yep, this stupid piece of rebar is the thing that’s done Dean in, and he’s hallucinating as he stands here bleeding to death.
“No!” John barked. “You know the rules in this house. You come home past curfew, you’re grounded.” His father’s eyes narrowed and Dean realized he was looking at the scrape on Dean’s shoulder. Too late, Dean’s hand flew up to cover the wound, the pressure of his hand on the tacky surface stinging. He watched as John took in his appearance, his bloody lip and scuffed knees, his father’s face darkening as the silent seconds ticked by.
The breeze tickles his hair, fluffs it, grabs some of Castiel and whisks him away. Snapping to, sniffling, Dean shakes his head and presses Castiel’s ashes into the soil in front of him. He tips the ashes from the jar one slow handful at a time, letting them sift through his fingers and into the earth, mouth set in a hard line and eyes burning with unshed tears.
“It means exactly what it sounds like, Cas,” Sam interrupts, standing. He gathers up the heavy book he’d been reading earlier. “Dean will make you wait forever while he’s figuring out what he wants.”
Gritting his teeth angrily against the threat of tears, Dean gets out of the car and breathes deep. He can hear birds chirping at each other, insects droning, the mighty yet gentle
With a groan Castiel releases his grip on the sheets and reaches for Dean, needing to touch him, to know his touch is welcome. It dawns on Castiel that he
Aaron had sat next to Dean in English class during their freshman year, and they’d done a few projects together for Mrs. Mills. A year slogging through the freshman English curriculum together had offered a rare opportunity for Dean, and he was glad to say he and Aaron were friends. They spent most of their summer days biking out to the lake to swim or hanging out in Aaron’s room, the AC cranked as high as it would go while they took turns playing
“That’s two weeks, by the way,” John added as Dean made his way up the stairs. “For breaking curfew and for fighting.” Dean clenched his left hand into a fist, nails digging into his palm. “Yes, sir,” he ground out, before he stomped the rest of the way upstairs and into the hallway bathroom. He badly wanted to slam the door but didn’t want to draw John’s attention again.
“It figures the first time I need stitches Sam isn’t here,” Castiel pants, gripping the edge of the bed, jeans ruched up and rolled to the knees. He’s incredibly busy bleeding everywhere; he’s allowed to complain about the quality of care he knows he’s about to receive, thank you very much. He loves Dean, but they all know Sam has the best bedside manner when it comes to first aid.
He knows Sam will be waiting for him with a thousand questions, but maybe if he gets good and wasted he can avoid the interrogation for a while longer. The last thing he wants to do is talk about
By the time Sam and Dean are both driving off Rainbow Road every fifteen seconds because they’d had that many beers, Castiel is sitting in Sam’s lap, curled up in the well of his legs, nose poking up over Sam’s crossed ankles. Dean smiles. He’s glad they seem comfortable with each other. It makes him feel like his little friend is an official part of his family, now, too.
“And?” Castiel says with a pinched look, his tone telling Dean in no uncertain terms he knows there’s more. Dean’s discomfited to discover Castiel maintains the ability to look at Dean as though he’s looking at the very center of him, even when he’s human.
They both glance up at the door when Sam’s hulking frame comes into view. Dean shifts in his seat, both hands wrapped in a white-knuckled grip around the tumbler of whiskey.
It would have to be enough. Settling sat like lead in his gut, but Dean convinced himself that what they had was
, can he? Won’t it be strange if he does? Or would it be more strange to hold on to them, and pretend he never saw them?
“Cas,” he says aloud, or at least he’s pretty sure he’s spoken aloud, “I’m here, I’m comin’ for you, I gotta, I can’t– shit. Help me find you, man.”
He can hear the light scrabbling of tiny claws on ceramic. The dragon sneeze-squeaks again, and Dean can see it shake its tiny head, shaking up a cloud of sugar-dust.
“Sam, stop the car,” Cas suddenly grates into the dark interior of the Impala, the first words he’s spoken in hours.
Dean’s pulse jumped in his throat. The gesture made him feel somehow even more vulnerable than the kiss they’d shared, but he didn’t pull away. He liked it, this wild, unfettered thing inside him, this feeling of endless possibility. They walked the rest of the way to the school in a friendly silence, hands held and swinging gently between them.
Sam and Dean exchange a look. Sam’s got this frown on his face that looks like it lives there, and Dean can see he’s already picking through possible longer-term solutions, but for now…
“Damn,” he finally manages, and Castiel growls warningly, “Get out!” He looks away from Dean, his wings drawing closer around him, face aflame.
inside him, in the deepest place, his most secret self. It was the kernel of consciousness, anchoring him; it was the place from which the ties that bound him in life to those he called kin sprouted and grew. Closing his eyes, going within, he turned his attention to the pull.
at Castiel. Who is, impossibly, sitting before him on his bedroom floor, a full-grown man instead of a dragon the size of a large-ish python.
“Can it, Samantha, it’s bedtime for you, too,” Dean grumbles. He pushes himself to his feet one-handed, carefully cradling Castiel against his chest as he struggles not to tip over once he’s upright. He turns slowly to Sam and offers his brother a hand; how they manage not to go down in a tangle of limbs is beyond Dean.
Cas is looking at him with his blue eyes wide and sad, and he slowly shakes his head, perhaps at himself. “I have no defense,” he rumbles miserably. “I agree that my actions have been… less than courageous.”
a big deal. Dean’s honestly kinda terrified of how Castiel showing up in the barn earlier turned his final moments from
Cas raises his head, props himself up on his elbows. Dean is still getting used to Cas smiling like this, fond and delighted, full of light, and is so distracted by it that he misses Cas’ question entirely.
A shaky breath escapes Dean, and he leans in close to Cas. “Okay. But, uh. I gotta tell you somethin’, first.”
Hands roam and teeth nip and Cas slides his knee between Dean’s legs, dipping his tongue into Dean’s mouth for the barest taste. He pulls away slowly, blue eyes dark like the nighttime ocean, and then reaches under Dean’s thighs and heaves him onto the table, pressing into the space between his legs and kissing Dean breathless.
“Yeah,” Dean tells him. “She’s around here somewhere. Lives here now.” He lets out a slow breath and continues, “Once Chuck was out of the picture, Jack– well, he sort of reset… everything. Brought everyone back like that Rapture shit never happened.”
“I don’t know,” Dean murmurs, reaching a tentative hand out to push at Cas’ shoulder. For a moment, nothing happens. Dean looks up at Sam, lost, before turning back to find Castiel blinking up at him, disoriented but awake.
Dean blinks, and his fingers flex like they wanna make a fist. “Mhmm, mhmm,” he hums, running a shaking hand over his mouth. “And when, exactly, was this? This morning? Last Tuesday?”
Clutching himself tighter, wrapped into a ball of confusion and grief and fury, Dean screams into the empty room.
before he thinks, yeah, okay. Watching Cas make himself a bowl of cereal one morning, Dean decides he’s going to test this theory. He can’t… he can’t outright
him, even — but he’d shoved Dean out of the way of danger, his very own personal guardian angel to the bitter end.
Dean is driving through Louisiana on his way to visit with friends. He stops, as he always does, at Benny’s all-night diner, and that’s the first time he sees Castiel: sitting at the counter, nursing a steaming mug of coffee at three o’clock in the morning and looking for all the world as though he’d just tumbled out of someone else’s bed, thoroughly fucked. His hair, shiny and dark as a bird’s feather, sticks up in every direction, and he gazes into the distance with eyes hooded and sultry, while Dean stands in the doorway staring, totally fucking gobsmacked.
with Castiel, murmuring in the scant space between them, warm: “‘I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true).’”
He knows eventually he’s going to have to get off this floor. He knows he still has work to do, and he is running out of time. He can’t afford to sit here forever and mourn.
The sight stirs something in him and for a moment Dean is caught up in a distant memory, one of an imaginary future in which Cas seemed always to go barefoot, communing with the earth or some shit, and a smile tugs at Dean’s lips before he remembers how things ended for those versions of Sam, Dean, and Cas.
Dean takes a long swallow of his whiskey and savors the smooth burn of it down his throat, wishing he knew what to say to make things okay between them.
Dean gets it now. He gets how important it is that no matter what, against reason, against fate, Cas has chosen him, again and again.
A tiny frown crosses the man’s face and he tilts his head to the side curiously, the move eerily reminiscent of…
So partly in the interest of time and partly because this is just the way this shook out, I combined these two prompts into one fic. Which is
“Dean, you did it. You did it!” Sam is exclaiming, shaking him on the shoulder, heedless of Dean’s injuries. He swivels his head around, eying Sammy upside-down, and then Jack, hovering uncertainly outside their little bubble, somehow
Dean goes to the fridge and takes out the milk, then sets it beside the sugar bowl on the counter, standing sentry next to the coffee machine because he can’t be fucked to ever put it away in the pantry.
“Fuckin’ nerd,” Dean accuses, before closing the last of the distance between them and pressing his mouth to Castiel’s, the final step in feeling like he’s come home.
“Right,” Dean mutters, examining the amber again. It rests against his chest, lighter than anything, but he can feel the lead weight of it pressing against his bones.
. He’s failed again, but this time he’s fucked up so stupendously he doesn’t know if he’ll ever be able to trust himself. An enormous pit opens up inside him, a well of misery, and Dean has no idea how to keep everything he’s feeling from spilling out.
, but let’s just say his name is Sam and he should be cautious around his shampoo for the foreseeable future.”
He says it lightly, teasing, and a tension Dean didn’t even realize he was holding onto melts from his shoulders. He sags back in his seat, relief washing cool through him like the tide, unreasonably proud of himself — for asking for something he wanted in the first place, and for being ready to ask for it
And while that is a wonderful, cozy feeling that makes his chest feel warm, Dean suddenly thinks of something absolutely
“I’d hardly call this a fight. It’s barely an argument,” Cas says in a surprisingly gentle voice. “I’ve hurt you,” he says, contrite, and Dean ignores the twinge behind his ribs at the admission. “You’ve every right to be angry.”
Right. Dean came in here with a plan, and maybe they’ve taken a slight detour, but he can get them back on track. He reaches for Cas, pulling him up and drawing him into his arms, kissing into him, sated and slow. He can taste himself on Cas’ tongue, and he lets out a whimper, impossibly pleased.
And Castiel comes along for the ride, placid, smiling sometimes when he thinks Dean’s not looking, noticeably not saying anything about Dean’s behavior and continuing to miss all of Dean’s attempts at what could now only be described as –
Dean smiles, too, as he strokes his finger down the dragon’s spine, tip to tail, and watches it arch up into the touch like a cat. “Yeah,” he says, soft and embarrassed, “maybe it’s stupid, but. I
For a few harrowing steps, they’re wandering practically blind in a cornfield in the middle of the night, stalks cut to the quick, the brittle remains of this year’s harvest crunching and clacking together beneath their feet. But then the blue-white glow of Cas’ grace grows and floods the area. It starts as merely outlines of the broken cornstalks, each line and leaf limned in a silvery sheen, before it balloons into something painfully bright in the darkness.
), Dean is combing his fingers through Cas’ dark, wet hair, an easy sort of affection so natural to him now, he can’t remember what it was like before. What
A stifled, pained sound fills the silence, and Dean turns back to Cas. He leans close to him, and he can’t stop himself from reaching out, cradling Cas’ neck, pushing fingertips into his damp, tousled hair. He manages to squash the urge to grab Cas’ hand, at least, berating himself for even having the thought, especially with his anxious moose of a brother hovering over them.
“Yeah, Cas,” Dean mutters, standing slowly and coming to stand in front of Castiel. “I said ‘they’re mine.’ Because they’re
“Uh, guys,” Sam interjects, and Dean and Cas both turn to him, belatedly remembering he’s there. “What exactly
– had the nerve to tell Dean the one thing he wanted, he couldn’t have? That being happy was just in the being, just saying it? That, essentially, Dean had spent the last few years tormenting himself about
“I know you don’t want to hear it, but don’t worry about that, either,” Anna said from somewhere near the bathroom sink. “Now let’s see your arm.”
Dean laughs again. “Yeah, I guess I do,” he agrees, rubbing at Cas behind the ears. His soft, rumbling purr fills the air as they all wander back in the direction of the kitchen in search of coffee and breakfast.
Mouth twisted into a sour frown, Castiel jerks a pen from the tin can behind the register and reaches around to the napkin dispenser, grabbing a brown rectangle and making a huge show of writing his name and number on the paper. Capping the pen, he tucks the napkin carefully into his wide apron pocket and turns back to Charlie, who gives him a triumphant smirk before getting back to her morning prep.

Dean swallows the sound that wants to crawl out of his throat. Cas died right in front of him and he
. Lucifer’s spawn, merely existing while Castiel is dead and gone. Hell, Dean’s just as likely to set himself off as anyone else.
“Well damn, Cas, tell me how you really feel,” he says, trying for humor, to keep things light, but it seems Castiel is determined not to allow the deflection.
Castiel raises one dubious eyebrow. “Given what you do for a living I find that deeply concerning,” he says, dry as the goddamn Sahara.
for their awesome love and support (and catching of grammatical errors)! Also, conversationalpurgatory introduced me to the glory that is the London Fog and all I can say is Dean is a fool for not trying it.
Looking back at Cas, chewing his lip, Dean comes to a decision. He cups his hands around his mouth and shouts up to the angel. “Hey, Cas!” He can’t tell if Castiel can even hear him; the colossal creature before them doesn’t react. And hey, Dean gets it — if he were a towering alien being with wings, he probably wouldn’t pay much attention to any little insignificant humans making noises at him. They’re essentially ants to Cas right now. Maybe they always have been, Dean realizes with a sudden chill.
“But as I said, Dean. You owe me nothing. You don’t have to give me a piece of yourself in exchange for me loving you. Being
shy of 2K, so I don't know if this one will count. This may become a longer thing in the future, we shall see!
“She woulda liked you, I think,” he continues. “She was big on being kind to all creatures, big and small, you know?” If Dean had initially felt a little strange talking to a dragon just like he would talk to another person, that feeling is long since past. He tells him all about Mary Winchester as they continue through the house, searching for something Dean can try passing off as a nest, until he hears a weird gurgling noise. Looking down at the dragon, he hears it again and watches as the dragon’s tongue snakes out to lick at his own face. He looks up at Dean with nothing short of Sam-level puppy eyes as the little gurgle happens again.
“I’m not sure,” Cas says, tilting his head in contemplation. “Maybe it’s come to the surface because I am… dysfunctional at the moment.”
“I know, Sam,” Jack says, voice gentle as he crosses into the room and lays a hand on Sam’s shoulder. He, too, crouches beside Dean, reaching out to cover Sam’s hands, lifting them slowly away. He closes his eyes, stretches out his hand, and lays his palm over Dean’s heart. Buttery light spills out from under Jack’s fingers, soaking into Dean’s clothes. Castiel sees tendrils of glowing gold twist and twitch under Dean’s skin, flaring and receding with a steady pulse-pulse-pulse, and closes his eyes.
The little dragon is plainly thrilled by this development, circling and sniffing around the mug on the table, scampering up and into it and then immediately scurrying out and across Dean’s pillows, back and forth in wriggling joy. Cas finally settles down, curling protectively around his mug and purring, the picture of pure creature comfort. When Dean reaches out his hand to offer petting, Castiel meets him halfway, pushing his head up into Dean’s palm and rubbing against him, pleased.
Dean grunts as he pulls the back door shut behind him, wrestling with the lock and juggling his phone. “’Course not. I’ll be right there. 15 minutes,” he grunts.
“Of course,” Cas says, but Dean still sees wariness written all across his face, in the tight way he’s carrying himself. He doesn’t like it. He’s never liked it when things between him and Cas are weird. It always unbalances him, somehow.
“Jesus,” Dean breathes. He twists in his seat, laying his book on the desk, before turning back to Castiel and leaning on his elbows. His hands hang between his knees, fingers tangling apart, together, apart, together. He clears his throat, wets his lip. Looks Castiel in the eye. “Sorry, uh. Been thinkin’ about this a lot, but I guess now that you’re here…” He steadies himself, moving fluidly from awkward to confident in a way that makes Castiel’s mouth feel suddenly dry. “Damn, it’s good to see you, Cas,” he finally finishes.
“Like hell I will,” Dean growls back. “You’ve been in there alone all night, I just wanna make sure you’re okay.”
be a timestamp eventually, but as it stands right now I might just have to turn it into a full-blown sequel because it turns out I can't write porn without plot. ^.^;;; In either case, more of this version of Dean and Cas is forthcoming - sometime. As soon as I can get it out of my head and to my alpha and betas, anyway.
“The bed was too cold,” Castiel complains gruffly. When he doesn’t continue Dean puts his hands on Castiel’s shoulders and pushes him back, letting his gaze sweep over the other man’s face, his sleep-tousled hair, his broad chest…
Sam at least has the decency to look like maybe this is one of the weirder ideas he’s had in a while, though Dean is pretty sure they can’t entirely blame the alcohol for Sam coming up with it. “Right.”
The smug look on Cas’ face as he helps Dean to his feet is, Dean has to admit, extremely well-earned.
With a sad laugh, Dean looks back to his glass, rolling it between his palms and watching the light glint off the rim in bright flashes. “I thought I knew exactly what I was gonna say to you if I ever saw you again,” he muses, deflating. “Figures I’d just start a fight.”
Dean starts imagining all the ways Cas might finally do it. He’d seen Cas kiss Meg that one time, and boy howdy, did that passionate sort of
It’s a risk and he’s pretty sure it’s either going to make him go deaf or insane, but Dean pulls his hands away from his ears and grips the amber pendant in one hand, feather in the other. He does his best to block out the waves of sound around him and turns his focus inward, picturing Castiel’s face.
“Cas!” Dean calls, scrambling to his feet and rushing to the angel’s side. Castiel is sprawled on the floor like a rag doll, unconscious, and when Dean rolls him gingerly onto his back, he has an awful moment where he’s sent hurtling back to the lakeside in North Cove, cold damp earth soaking through the knees of his jeans and Cas’ wings burned into the ground. He shakes his head and blinks hard; no wings here. No wings.
shoot up, and Dean has to force himself not to tell Sam it wasn’t what he’s thinking, because somehow it seems like the wrong thing to say. He clears his throat and stares resolutely at his hands, waiting for Sam to say something.
“That you felt it, too. No matter what form I take, what face I wear… I will always be yours. As… you will always be mine.”
He pulls back to look Castiel in the face. “I love you, too, Cas,” he murmurs, and if he’d felt free and light in the wake of Chuck’s defeat, well. Right now he thinks if he wasn’t holding on to Cas he’d legitimately float away.
And so he had. And here he was. Alone, constrained, the glacial press of true nothingness frigid against the somehow still-substantive flesh of his vessel. The sole creature in a stygian blackness so complete, he could very well have been standing next to something or some
, for chrissake, and closes the door on Cas, who had followed him from the living room. The dragon spends the entire time Dean’s doing his business scratching frantically at the bathroom door.
“Castiel is in the Empty,” Jack intones, profoundly sad and solemn. “It took him.” He looks at Dean, looks into his eyes and
“What? What’s wrong?” Castiel asked, worried. Meg was not the go-silent type. Meg was the blow-up-in-your-face-at-the-least-convenient-time type. The I-don’t-give-a-single-fuck-who-hears-all-about-our-business type. The I-never-cry-for-any-reason type. When Castiel saw actual tears glimmering on Meg’s eyelashes, his heart leapt into his throat.
It’s not enough that he’s spent every single day of the last six months walking around like something so big inside of him was missing that he’d spend the rest of his life feeling its absence like a phantom limb. As much as Dean hates to admit it, he’s always felt that way whenever he and Cas were on the outs, and a thousand times more so any time Cas has died. And this last one — this last death — nearly destroyed him. Sure, Dean’s been getting up, going through the motions, pasting on a smile for Sam and eating as much pie as his forty-one-year-old ass can consume, but it’s all felt… empty. Hollow. The echoing insides of a tinman, gutted by grief.
Charlie appears at Castiel’s side and shoves him bodily out of the way, towards the espresso machine. “Move over, loverboy,” she crows. “I got this.” She turns to the woman waiting and gives her an apologetic smile. “What can I do for you this morning, ma’am?”
ing in mock disappointment. “Didn’t take you for a fuckin’ fairy, Winchester,” Lee Chambers said, emerging from the shadows at the side entrance to the school, flicking a cigarette butt into the dark beside him.
Dean starts finding Cas asleep all over the bunker: at the kitchen table at 2 a.m., the library table mid-afternoon, the laundry room one morning, even on the stairs leading up to the front door. It’s like he’s just nodding off wherever he happens to be when the urge strikes, an angelic narcoleptic whose grace keeps spilling out of him, taking strange forms when it’s visible to the naked human eye.
Castiel blinks and rolls his head toward the muted sound of Sam’s voice calling for his brother, sharp with panic, aiming to hold him away from the precipice of death. Colors and shapes float lazily across his vision before resolving into Sam, crouching over Dean, who is sprawled like a rag doll on the concrete. Sam’s got his hands over Dean’s heart, leans his full weight into it, looking between his brother and the open door, distraught. Castiel sees the blood staining Sam’s wrists and forearms and commands his body to cooperate, to sit up. The room spins. He collapses against the icy concrete floor, squeezes his eyes shut, swallows.
Overhead, a sound like shattering glass crashed into Castiel’s awareness, something strangely tangible in the evanescent expanse of the Empty, substantial in a way nothing else was or felt.
. Castiel was a danger to him, here. He was a danger to him because every monster in Purgatory could sense Castiel’s angelic grace and would be drawn to it like moths to a flame. And he was a danger to him in the flesh: Castiel’s latent feelings for the Righteous Man were ultimately a corruption, something deeply frowned upon. What would those feelings do to Dean, here in this place where it was impossible to be anything other than who and what they were?
For a minute, Dean stands, stunned into silence by this idea. But then it begins to make sense to him. It’s… pretty much his fault Castiel is trapped in the Empty. Yeah, Cas made the deal, but Dean is the one who gave him a reason to be happy. Just by
“Okay,” Sam says, drawing out the ‘o’ in further surprised confusion as he half-turns to leave the kitchen. “I guess– I guess I’ll just– go, then?” Dean nods, curt, and Sam goes, but not without first shooting Dean a look that practically screams
“Alright, alright,” Dean mutters to himself, chewing on his lip. He looks at Cas and reaches out to push sweaty hair off his forehead without thinking about it. They sit in silence, just existing side by side, tiny wisps of grace swirling up out of Cas only to get sucked back in moments later as he breathes. Dean can’t stop petting Cas’ hair and Cas doesn’t call him on it, lying there with his gaze fixed, thoughtful and exhausted, on Dean’s face. Feeling weirdly exposed, Dean shrugs and grunts out, “What?”
Aaron, for his part, jumped on board, draping his arms over Dean’s shoulders, a tiny noise caught in his throat as Dean swept his tongue across the other boy’s lower lip. When his mouth opened under Dean’s, a jolt of electricity stabbed into Dean’s brain and shot down his spine; butterflies swarmed in his belly. The longer it went on, the more Dean’s knees turned to jelly, but he didn’t care if they ended up on the floor because it turned out kissing a boy was
follow this prompt? I dunno, I was even watching TGBBS for inspiration and to get in the mood (and of course, now I want every baked treat known to humankind), and this is what came out.
bottles rattling against each other, jarringly cheerful. Hands shaking, he finally lets himself reach for the tape, and sure enough, his own handwriting stares back at him as tears well fresh. He digs the heel of his hand into one eye, angry. The temptation to throw the tape against the wall and watch it pop and spill its ribbony insides almost overwhelms him, but a piece of paper with Sam’s scrawl on it catches his eye, gives him pause. He pins the note to the desk with two fingers, reading:
Castiel was weary from the wanting, but it didn’t stop him from picturing irises green as tumbled sea glass, or freckles scattered like stars on sun-kissed skin. It couldn’t stop him from remembering the feeling, in Hell, that the soul he had been tasked to save was the very reason for his Father’s creation, bright and strong and shining under the thick layers of angst and shame, radiating love in even the darkest of places.
In the meanwhile, he sat atop the tumultuous ocean of pain in this place, buoyed and clinging to the love that brought him here, and remembered: Dean knew, now. He knew he was loved, and precious, and good, and Castiel was overjoyed. He gathered his joy around him like armor against the dark, and he sat, and he waited.
in their wheelhouse but they’ve figured out crazier shit than this, right? Dean knows Jack isn’t gonna step in, but if Heaven’s back online and Cas is welcome there, maybe it’ll be as simple as returning him topside for a while. He looks over at Sam helplessly, and all he finds on his brother’s face is an answering frown.
Her eyes widened and, bafflingly, a hurt look crossed her face. She looked at Castiel as though he’d done something to intentionally harm her, mouth set in a firm line, stonily silent.
” Sam says, nettled. He drops a heavy hand to Dean’s shoulder and Dean angrily shoves his brother off, twisting to glare at him. Sam raises his hands in a placating gesture. “Look. We can’t figure out what’s going on if you keep biting my head off!”
Forty-five minutes later Castiel spots Dean waiting at the back of the usual morning queue and feels butterflies swarm and take flight in his stomach.
Deciding he needs a goddamn drink for this, Dean goes to the kitchen to retrieve the first of several six-packs he dropped there on his way in earlier.
It’s such a strangely tender kiss, in direct contrast to the force Castiel had used to manhandle Dean onto the table, the aggressive press of his body against Dean’s, hands sliding down his chest to land on his hips, squeezing them and pushing Dean back flat against the backlit surface beneath him.
It’s one of those nights where Dean’s gonna be up with his thoughts no matter what, so he gets out of bed and heads to the kitchen to make himself a snack. If he’s gonna torment himself about a certain blue-eyed, devastatingly handsome angel all night, he may as well enjoy some cinnamon toast while he’s at it.
“Find anything we can use?” he asks, coming up to the table and pulling out the chair opposite Sam. He flops into it and reaches for one of the ancient leather tomes, dragging it close and flipping it open.
Castiel is kissing him like he’s a guttering candle and Dean is oxygen and it’s real nice, but then Cas leans back and cups Dean’s cheeks in his hands, blue eyes searching his face, pleased but a shadow of doubt lingering there.
implied panty kink, post-series, ignores the events of 15x19 and 15x20, a fix-it of sorts I suppose, Cas POV, Dean is Bad At Words, fluff, getting together
“Heaven hasn’t been my home for a long time,” Cas goes on, reaching over to draw Dean’s hand into his. He brushes his thumb over Dean’s knuckles, tender sweeps of affection that take root and bloom in Dean’s chest, pressing against his ribs with a physical ache.
shirts is insane enough, but the glowing blue bottle of Grace dangling from Castiel’s neck sends a jolt of panic through Dean like nothing else.
Cas runs a hand up the back of Dean’s neck and into his hair, pressing him close, and Dean allows one final temptation, nipping at the skin over Cas’ thudding pulse before swallowing and moving to draw Cas’ earlobe into his mouth instead.
“You guys are gonna be so gross about this, aren’t you?” Sam says in mock distress. “I know what I want for Christmas. Noise-cancelling headphones. Or maybe a billion gallons of industrial cleaner? Oh! No, I know. Soundproofing for the bedrooms!”
“Uh, actually. Um. I dunno,” Dean stutters out. He looks down at Cas, who looks up at Dean through his eyelashes, both apologetic and possessive. He huffs up at Dean, his brows drawn down in a frown, and chirps in the direction of the phone, as if he’s offended Dean is using it right now. Dean does not know what to make of this.
There’s a sudden shuffling of footsteps in the hall outside, and Dean raises his tear-streaked face from his arms as Sam comes skidding into the room, catching himself on the doorframe.
The barista finishes his concoction and pushes it to the edge of the counter by Dean’s elbow, calling for someone to come pick it up before he turns to Dean with a raised eyebrow.
He attempts to approach it with math and logic, thinks, yes, golden and spiraling and ratios and perfection, and finds himself back where he started, loving and yearning in equal measure, but maybe it is the nature of anything time-bound; always spiraling back to what is, ultimately, immutable.
Thumbing open his phone, Dean sees the time and swears, tumbling out of bed and pulling on the nearest pair of jeans and what he’s pretty sure is a clean henley. “Gabe, shit, man,” he grumbles, voice rough with unrestful sleep. “I’m sorry, I slept like crap, didn’t even hear my alarm. I’m– I’m on my way–” He’s babbling into the phone, shoving his socked feet into his boots and striding down the hall without bothering to tie them. He comes into the kitchen, grabs his keys and his coat, and hustles out the back door. He’ll have to make a coffee at the bakery, no time right now.
Dean can hear more page-flipping on the other end of the line. “It, uh, it says here that generally, male dragons will have a colored stripe on the underside of their belly,” Sam says eventually, “and that females tend to be less colorful and even smaller than the males.”
as Castiel plunges his mouth over Dean, wringing noises out of him that are sweet and airy, and indeed a sort of unguardedness Dean had long since buried floats to the surface, loosening his limbs, turning him languid and pliant under Cas’ deliciously spit-slick lips.
A sudden noise echoes over to them from further down the hallway, and they both freeze. For several long, terrifying seconds Dean thinks they’re caught; however much he thinks he’s ready to do this thing with Cas, he doesn’t want Sam to find out by walking in on something he’d consider scandalous
“You’re thinking very loudly,” Cas observes, and Dean looks down at his hands, clenched together in his lap.
“That won’t be necessary, Dean. But thank you,” Jack says primly. “I don’t intend to stay for long.”
Sam mutters something to himself, too quiet for Castiel to hear actual words. He is clearly talking to Dean, but it’s just as clear Dean is unconscious. Castiel prays,
Castiel pulls back from Dean, and when Dean tugs gently on Cas’ hair he pulls back further still, studying Dean’s face, looking simultaneously like he can’t believe his luck and that Dean will be snatched away from him at any moment. Dean presses his thumb to Cas’ bottom lip, takes in the blue of his eyes from up close, and waits, unsure of what’s going to happen next, wandering into uncharted waters.
At the moment, his ire is directed at this particular witch who has Dean on his knees, finger twitching eagerly on the trigger of his own gun as he fights hard to pull the barrel away from his temple.
“This isn’t my fault,” he said with a frown, gesturing to the sunflowers on his shoulder, now a rich, buttery yellow, their dark centers a perfect earthy ochre. Curling, viridian leaves framed the flowers and made Castiel think of the warmth in a familiar embrace.
“‘It was supposed to end like this’?” Castiel demands, shoving Dean upright and leaving him to stand on his own quivering legs. He whirls on Sam and glares murder at him. “‘It’s okay’?” Castiel’s expression is dark; he’s a thunderstorm contained in the shape of a man. Dean is shocked the lights in the joint aren’t exploding all over them.
,” he tells Dean, some unnamed emotion in his voice that all the same makes Dean’s heart stutter in his chest. “It is how it has always been,” he adds softly, almost to himself.
“Bath time,” he says, heading down the hall to the bathroom. He runs the water in the tub until it’s just overly warm, then plugs it up and lets Cas slide into the shallow bath. Dean watches as he swim-slithers around, rolling over and using his wings to flick water up at Dean.
“You ok, Clarence?” he heard Meg ask from close by; blinking hard, Castiel turned to find her sitting on the dock’s edge next to him, kicking her legs in the water, too. There was genuine concern on her face; he wondered how many times she had tried to get his attention before he noticed.
? “He saved me, Sam,” Dean whispers, more fucking tears spilling over as he suddenly thinks Cas saved him in more ways than one today. “Billie, she– she was comin’ for me, man, and Cas–”
The floor comes up hard under Dean’s ass as his legs finally get the message from his brain to give up on being vertical. Sprawled on the ground and looking up now at his bed, he watches as Castiel sits up and gives him a look of mild concern. For the first time Dean gets a good look at Castiel and the blue tattoo on his body, narrow lines drawn from shoulder to shoulder meeting at a point right in the center of his chest and trailing down the midline of his abdomen, like a “Y”. If Dean had a shred of doubt, the tattoo erases it. He thinks of how much Castiel liked to have that stripe on his belly petted and the thought
About halfway through Dean has to stop; he recaps the jar and stands, walks away, digs fingers into his hair and grips so tight his scalp burns. At war with himself, wanting to rage against harsh reality, Dean barely keeps his anger in check, but he wants to do right by Cas, too. He knows it won’t do – laying him to rest angry. He deserves peace, Dean reminds himself. Cas was good and loyal and beautiful and brave and he. deserves. peace.
“Guess he doesn’t like you, Sammy,” Dean teases, stepping aside to let his brother in. He claps a hand on Sam’s shoulder and shakes his head. “Don’t worry, man. He’ll warm up to you.” He draws his finger down Castiel’s snout. He looks up at his brother, and if Dean were anyone else he’d admit he was feeling pretty nervous about introducing these two. “Sam, this is Cas. Cas, this is my brother Sam.”
Wake up. Zombie-shuffle to kitchen. Flip on lights. Flip on coffee. Find small dragon creature lying curled up in coffee mug. Return small dragon creature to the wild. Repeat.
“Cas,” Dean said, whispering into the unrelenting dusky gloom of the forest, face pointed at the starry sky. “Castiel, I– I hope you can hear me, man. I hope you’re here and you can hear me.”
“I needed an excuse to talk to him,” Castiel says, and Charlie squeals at him before turning on a mock frown.
okay if he’s laying on the sarcasm this thick. He can’t help the tiny relieved smile that tugs at his lips.
But eventually he does pull away, with one last, fluttering kiss to Castiel’s throat. Dean meets Cas’ eyes and is beyond pleased with himself for putting that lust-drunk look there. He licks at his lips, collecting every stray drop he can gather, and then Castiel is pushing into his space, pressing their mouths together, tracing his tongue along the seam of Dean’s lips until he gives in and opens. The noise Castiel makes when he tastes his own blood in Dean’s mouth would take Dean out at the knees if he were standing.
“I mean,” Sam hedges, tilting his head back to look up at Cas’ face high, high above them. “It’s possible that his vessel’s been made unusable.”
They’re certainly not the sort of best friends who sit around braiding each other’s hair and talking all about their feelings, so Dean thinks it’s totally possible there was nothing romantic at all in what Castiel said to him when he summoned the Empty. Just. Just a bro, telling his best bro how much he means to him before he kicks the bucket. Like the last time Cas thought he was dying. He’d said “I love you,” but then he’d said it to
Sam clearing his throat is loud in the sudden silence that falls over the kitchen, and he shifts on his chair before poking at his side-salad with a fork, eyes on the table. “You, uh, you think about what we’re gonna do about your Grace, Cas?” he asks, too casual. It’s been… not a sore subject, but not something any of them have been comfortable openly discussing.
Over Sam’s shoulder, Dean can see Jack come cautiously into the room, a deep frown on his face. His vision blurs. He’d never noticed before how much Jack looks like Cas when he frowns.
looks like for the first time on this earthly plane. “You’re incredible.” It’s an insanely private opinion to admit, but the words sneak their way out of Dean before he can snatch them back in.
Shakespeare. He thought of all the days of summer stretched out before him, empty of her presence, and felt tears threaten again.
Sam’s apologetic look instantly morphs into an epic bitchface. He turns to Castiel, presumably for backup, but Cas merely stares back at him sternly, brow furrowed.
Castiel heard, loud and clear, Dean’s unspoken fear: not that Castiel was in Purgatory, too, but that he was dead. And Castiel knew he could allay Dean’s fear in an instant, he could snap his fingers and stand before him, he could bring him hope –
quickly, focusing again on the movie. Dean wishes he could ignore the way his chest tightens as Cas leans away from him, the unpleasant roll in his gut, but they’re both so sharp and immediate it proves impossible. He spends the next twenty minutes hoping Cas will lean back in, and then the remainder of the movie berating himself for hoping anything because, c’mon, it’s
imagined it, plenty, sue him – he’d somehow never thought that kissing Castiel would feel so… normal. Like it was just an extension of who they were and how they interacted. Like they were already so deeply a part of one another that this mere brushing of lips was only a reminder that they… belonged. That, for better or worse, they were bound.
manages to turn his head to the side so he doesn’t spit beer right in his brother’s face, while Sam sputters and looks so fucking constipated Dean would laugh if he also wasn’t turning the color of a fire engine, thinking it couldn’t possibly get any worse.
“Have a nice day,” the barista tells him with a smile, and Dean actually manages to murmur a half-brained “You, too,” before escaping from
“Hey little dude,” he says eventually, tipping the mug up towards himself and peering inside. The dragon slithers over and over itself, almost tying its body into a tiny knot of scales and feathers. Dean watches, fascinated, as its scaled skin shimmers in the kitchen light, an iridescence that flashes blue to match the tiny, feathered wings and tip of its tail.
Castiel raises his eyebrows and Sam laughs when he sees Dean’s look. Shaking his head, his long legs carry him back out in the hall. “I’ll leave you two to it,” he calls over his shoulder, disappearing as immediately as he came.
The string stretched between his heart and Dean’s vibrates, intense and pure, imploring Castiel to make the space between them disappear. He reminds himself that the being – the
He finds it, eventually; he isn’t sure what about the old windmill catches his eye exactly, but its red-rusted steel supports and softly spinning sails draw him in. He pulls the car off the road with a crunch of gravel and kills the engine, sitting for a minute with his hands on the wheel, chewing his lip. Dean watches the windmill turn, the blades slicing through the air. It’s quiet here. Tranquil.
Arms curling around Cas, Dean buries his fingers in the downy not-feathers at his shoulder blades and presses. Castiel lets out a positively unholy sound that ping-pongs around inside of Dean and settles warm and low in his belly, so he does it again, nibbling at Cas’ lips. He’s secretly, deeply pleased when Cas opens to him so Dean can swallow that noise and keep it for himself.
“Well, kinda, Dean,” Sam huffs. “I don’t know. It’s like… I used some scotch tape to pin down a meteor.”
“Uh,” he says stupidly. “Um. Yeah. I mean, no, I–” Dean shakes his head and laughs lightly, flustered, and surprised to find himself so. “I could stay a minute,” he finally manages, “if you wanted some company.”
There was a knock on the door, and then chilly air burst in and interrupted the glorious, steamy warmth swirling around his legs. “Cas?” he heard his sister ask, and all the adrenaline that had pushed him this far suddenly disappeared, leaving him shaky and tearful in the tub.
Nothing fancy about it. Just iced coffee. How the guy had gone from “an iced coffee, please” to “fancy tea latte thing” was beyond Dean, but luckily he realized before he got too far away from the counter and spun back to catch the guy’s attention.
“Don’t– don’t worry about it,” Dean stammers, backing away from the counter, but unable to drop his gaze.
Seriously, this is news to no-one, least of all Dean, but with the exception of Rowena, Dean would happily toss every single one of them into the Pit. Even Rowena barely gets a pass, okay, and she’s busy being the Queen of Hell now or whatever so maybe things are good for witches down there, who knows?
“Thought things were gonna be different with the kid in charge,” he says, his voice simmering with his barely-contained emotions, months of grief, of anguish, threatening to spill out all at once. “But it looks like angels are all back to being dicks, huh?”
It takes a bit more work and a great deal more of Castiel grumbling, clumsy and unhelpful, but Dean wrestles the trench coat off and drapes it over the back of the chair at the room’s lonesome desk. He pushes an unprotesting Cas onto his back and pulls the sheet up over him, willing his face to stay blank as Cas continues to stare at him.
, y’know?” He rubs a hand down his face and blows out a sigh, looks up at the ceiling and then finally over at Sam, who’s standing in the doorway with compassion written all over his face.
“Dean!” Sam exclaims, striding across the floor in three quick steps and dropping to his knees in front of his brother. He puts his hands on Dean’s shoulders and pushes him back, panic and relief warring in his eyes.
A trip to the hospital and fifty-six stitches later, Castiel lay in his bed under the eaves in the attic, right arm cradled against his chest and gaze on the stars through his window.
Dean stumbled back and lost his grip on his bike. It crashed to the ground between them and he stepped over it, shoving back. “Shut up, you shut the fuck up,” he said, failing to keep the desperation out of his voice. The last thing he wanted was for Lee to know how truly terrified Dean was of John Winchester getting even a whiff of Dean maybe, sort of, liking boys, but he couldn’t stop himself from rising to the bait.
They sit together on a well-loved quilt Dean keeps in his car, laid out in the grass on top of a hill in the middle of nowhere. Dean had driven them far away from town, out into the country where the darkness was dotted only by the occasional farmhouse, for one of his favorite views of the night sky.
After a moment, Dean blows out a breath and runs his hands through his hair before grasping his glass again, thoughtful. He shakes his head at himself and keeps his eyes on the table as he speaks. “But I guess I shouldn’t be that surprised,” he says finally.
“C-Cas,” Dean manages to gasp out as Cas slides his hands, whispering ghost-like, up over Dean’s arms and chest, affection in every caress of his fingertips. He ducks in under Dean’s chin and bites down his throat, leaving a scorching kiss at the dip between Dean’s collarbones before sweeping his hands up Dean’s neck and into his hair, petting.
“I — I want you to have all of me,” Cas tells him, the braver of the two of them, as usual. “I trust you to keep me safe.”
Dean digs his fingers into his hair, scrapes his nails down the back of his neck, and tries not to let the edges of despair creep up on him. This is — well, it isn’t
Castiel gives Dean a hard stare. “Perhaps I was enamored by the… mugs, and the food. And your keys,” he adds with a small smile. “But your heart called to mine.” His gaze softens, a hopeful glint sparkling there. “And when you took my feather, when you allowed the bite, I assumed–”
come back – then that would be it. All Dean would have left of Castiel, Angel of Thursday, were his memories.
Nothingness stretched in every direction. Castiel turned a slow circle, listening, feeling the pull like the sweet ache he had come to live with tucked cozy beneath his ribs.
Dean comes home from the bakery laden down with a bag of pastries and a brooding look. Shouldering his way in through the back door, he leaves it propped open to catch the crisp October breeze while he tosses the white, grease-stained bag of baked goods onto the counter next to his coffee maker. He hangs up Baby’s keys on the empty hook closest to the sink, watching them glint in the sunlight streaming in through his kitchen window as they swing to a standstill. He shucks his green army jacket and tosses it over the back of a chair, then sinks down into it, head in his hands.
. He hadn’t read it, but the title stuck with him that night as he lay on yet another shitty motel bed, sore from getting tossed around by an angry spirit and longing for his bed back at the bunker. On the drive back to Kansas, he’d mulled over what made a bed a good one, a
“They mate for life, Dean,” Sam explains, sounding constipated. “The bites are like, the equivalent of putting a ring on it.” He pauses, and Dean senses something weighty in the silence. “I think… I think it means that Cas, uh. Castiel loves you. A lot.”
Dean freezes, mouth hovering bare millimeters from Castiel’s skin, as Cas continues, “I know you want to.” And, most quiet of all: “It’s okay.”
They’re in the middle of nowhere, someplace in the long, lonely stretches of empty Illinois cornfields outside Champaign. It’s dark; wisps of grey clouds scud across the sky, blotting and blurring the stars, a sliver of moon hanging just over the horizon. Sam drives a half a mile further and pulls off onto a dirt turnaround.
sound preceding the low electric hum of the compressor. It drags Castiel from his daze, endorphins stirring a wild exhilaration inside him.
“What happened, buddy? You forget where your bed is or somethin’?” Dean jokes, his arm sliding around Cas’ waist when the angel sways against him, clearly exhausted. Dean remembers the last time they’d come down these halls like this, holding onto each other when the world and their plans were falling apart around them, and he sobers, telling Cas in a low voice, “I got you, too.” Castiel looks at him then, his blue eyes sharp and laser-focused and way, way too awake for someone who, only moments before, was sleeping so soundly Dean thought he might’ve been
“Yes,” Castiel sighs wearily and the liminal glow of his feathers shifts in a rippling tide of twinkling lights. “This is one way it can manifest here.”
Dean nods and takes another bite of his toast, chewing nonchalantly but internally going into a tailspin at this, trying to come up with what — if anything! — could keep an angel up at night when all is, essentially, right with the world, for once. And as he sits and wonders about what keeps
He trudged to his bike and wearily unlocked it, winding the chain around the bike frame and dropping the rolled picnic blanket in the basket set between his handlebars. The wind blew suddenly ferocious and carried the smell of rain to him, and when Castiel looked at the sky it did indeed appear as though a storm was rolling in. Upset, confused, and tired, Castiel just wanted to get home. He took off and raced ahead of the storm clouds. He hoped he’d make it home before the rain.
When the last bits of Castiel’s Grace have eddied into the vial, Dean shoves the stopper in and wraps it in an old bandana he’s got in his jacket pocket before tucking it carefully away. He squeezes his eyes shut, counts to ten, and then digs his arms under Cas’ armpits and propels himself to his feet. He takes three steps back, dragging Cas’ dead weight, before he trips and crashes down in a heap of tangled limbs.
“You wanna tell me about what’s going on?” he asks, offering an ear as he’s done many times in the past.
It makes sense. It makes sense, but Dean can’t think, not with Castiel’s voice ringing in his ears and a pounding headache starting up at his temples. He looks up at Sam, frantic, and watches as Sam springs into action, striding over to a glass-doored cabinet and wrenching it open, risking his hearing by taking his hands from his ears to reach in amongst the tiny glass bottles and loose bundles of herbs inside. He grabs a few things from the shelves, inspecting them quickly, then turns and looks around, dashing to the other side of the room to retrieve a small brass bowl from the dead witch’s desk.
Loved. Each and every single piece of him, loved by this angel in his arms. He still can’t really believe it.
When he’s finally sliding the pie into the oven, Dean turns his attention to Cas, who now lies wrapped around himself, sticky from his snack. Red streaks of strawberry juice defy Castiel’s attempts to clean himself to his usual meticulous standard, and he looks mightily grumpy about it. Dean smiles and picks him up.
Castiel does so, passing it back over the counter and watching as Dean stuffs the ruined napkin into his back pocket before cradling the phone in both hands, thumbs flying over the screen. He gives the phone back to Castiel once more and nods at it.
They were well outside the entrance to the fair, the sounds muted and distant, when Aaron reached out and tentatively tangled his fingers with Dean’s.
, and laid hands on first Dean, and then Sam, healing their injuries from their (reckless) fight with Chuck.
Cas is grouchy and irritable, growling and snapping at Sam when he comes over for video games that night, giving him an unfriendly snarl when the Moose greets Dean with a hug at the door or any time he makes casual contact with his brother. Castiel spends the evening with his body curled around Dean’s throat like a living collar, alternately hissing at Sam in warning and poking his nose up into Dean’s chin, delicate tongue flicking out to barely kiss the skin there.
Dean feels a tear escape down his cheek and he angrily wipes it away, furious that his brain seems to be running a lot of background programs without his permission. “Well, yeah, Cas. C’mon, man, there’s so much shit between us now. How would we even– I don’t know, dude, I can’t just up and forgive myself like that.”
Dean swallows visibly, his jaw working as he searches for a response. Castiel waits. Pets a tentative hand down Dean’s side, takes root at his hip. Can’t ignore the pang of lust that shoots through him when Dean darts his tongue over his lips, unconsciously tantalizing.
Late that night, after unloading their goodies from the market, Dean is setting up his coffee for the next morning when Castiel comes into the kitchen carrying his hoard mug. He comes over to Dean’s side and drops a kiss to his shoulder before pushing the mug across the counter and up against the backsplash, right next to the ever-present sugar bowl. Then he reaches for the new white-and-blue mug and carefully arranges it so that it touches the green-and-blue mug, handles pointing away from one another.
“Yeah,” he agrees, leaning his forehead against Castiel’s. “I think you’re right.” Dean inhales the cold wintry air and lets the breath go slowly before he leans back and reaches into his jacket pocket. A sudden nervousness washes over him as he grasps the object inside and he catches his lower lip in his teeth. Castiel looks at Dean curiously, and Dean can feel the tips of his ears growing hot.
Still petting down Cas’ back with shaking hands, Dean winces when Cas’ tongue catches a rough edge of the bite, the sensation momentarily bleeding through the numbness. He can’t explain why his voice is shaking, too. “Not really, no.”
“Hey Cas,” Dean says softly. A beat passes and Dean can feel his smile slipping. He doesn’t have the juice to pretend right now. There are just too many things clamoring for attention in his head.
Better to keep on in their usual way, bound in each other’s orbit, drifting apart and then colliding again in a shower of sparks, Dean silently wanting, but telling himself over and over they weren’t meant for anything other than what they already had.
He closes his eyes, counts to ten, and turns, reaching for the doorknob, ready to hunt Cas down if need be so they can sit and talk about this like mature adults.
Cas’ tiny, self-satisfied smile as he turns to head into the hallway lives rent-free in Dean’s head for days.
“Yes.” Castiel gives him a sidelong glance. The corner of his mouth is tilted in a smug smile. “Something
Dean unlocks his phone and pulls up his music, setting the phone on the deep windowsill over the sink. Humming along to
Today had been utter shit. He had been the only assistant on hand for the early morning shift, which put Gabriel in a mood with a capital “M”, which put Dean in a mood as well. Then one of their ovens shit the bed and literally
It hits him like a stroke of lightning, how badly he wants Castiel. He suddenly knows he’s wanted Cas just that badly for years, and it’s all spilling out of him now, all the things he’s wanted but was too busy or too afraid to give them space to grow. Every atom in Dean’s body yearns, trapped in Cas’ orbit as surely as the planets orbiting the sun; he needs to touch Cas everywhere, needs to get his hands and his mouth and his cock all over this strange, beautiful creature as fast as possible because he’s already wasted so much time.
“Yeah,” Dean says, voice firming as he gathers up the pieces of himself shattered on the floor and tucks them back inside, slicing and pricking like shards of glass. He pushes himself slowly to his feet and finds his entire left leg has gone numb. “Sonuvabitch never stopped pulling the strings.” With a grunt, Dean stamps his left foot on the floor and feels the jangle of his prickling nerves from ankle to hip. “I don’t know how we’re gonna do it, Sammy, but we gotta take him out.”
For a few long minutes, the only sound in the library is the dry whisper of ancient book pages being turned, and that infernal clock ticking off somewhere in the stacks. Dean picks at the corner of his thumbnail, nervous, before blurting out, “Does this make me the biggest hypocrite on the planet?”
Dean parks Baby in the bunker’s garage and kills the engine. He sits, listening to the sudden silence in the cab, and runs his hands over her steering wheel, dropping his forehead to the warm leather and heaving a sigh. He maybe took a much longer drive than he originally intended when he stormed out earlier, but something about the open road has always soothed Dean when he was restless, and it had greeted him like an old friend and convinced him to stay just a little later than he’d planned. It’s well past midnight now, and there’s a good chance no one else is awake, but Dean’s still not ready to go inside and face… any of it.
“Anyway, this will hopefully make it easier to find him,” Sam murmurs. Both brothers look over at Jack, who smiles at them again and merely nods. It’s not an answer, but it somehow makes Dean feel slightly less like this is the worst idea they’ve had in a while.
Castiel watches, astonished, as Dean reaches across the bed and touches his fingers to the backs of Castiel’s. It’s a barely-there thing, the lightest pressure, but Castiel can feel the touch all the way to his toes, his whole body thrumming with a rarer and perhaps more precious happiness: the joy of coming together again, a unified whole.
He saw right away how beautiful Dean was. Broken and bleeding and ashamed, and beautiful nonetheless. Though he knew it was forbidden by his Heavenly Father and all the laws of creation, from the very first moment, loving Dean Winchester was, for Castiel, inevitable.
Dean is quiet, absorbing this hypothetical with every ounce of calm he can muster. He clears his throat and then asks, kinda terrified, “Mate?” He knows, he
When Cas doesn’t say anything, Dean chances a glance up. There’s pain written across Castiel’s face plain as day. And resignation, too, like he knew this was exactly how Dean was gonna react, and, okay, Dean can maybe see how that makes him the asshole here, actually.
Dean takes a breath and reaches out to touch the spot on Castiel’s wing that is clearly missing a feather, keeping the pressure of his fingers light. He looks at Cas’ earnest face and asks, quiet, “For me?” When Cas chirps in agreement, Dean takes up the feather Cas has offered him and turns it this way and that in the light of his bedside lamp. A minute shimmer in the blue catches the light, making the colors shift from aqua to azure to cerulean and back.
The man beside him huffs a laugh and slides his dark blue gaze in Dean’s direction. “More like a little bit late,” he says with a voice like gravel. “Haven’t slept yet.”
Clearing his throat and hoping his face isn’t on fire, Dean backs out of his own bedroom with his tail between his legs. “Uh,” he says, “gonna go get that coffee now.”
, in the passenger seat. He should be sitting there, and he isn’t and Dean is sure it’s his fault. As usual. As fucking usual. Half his drive had been spent in a total daze, true, but the other half Dean spent second-guessing every decision he’d made that culminated in building Cas a funeral pyre.
One of the vampires, a woman, broke their grapple and got a hand wrapped around Castiel’s throat; his vessel struggled to remain conscious and Castiel kicked weakly at her, trying to dislodge her but only managing to tire himself further.
And Dean… doesn’t even know what to do with that. He’s spent his whole life knowing in his bones he was unlovable, worthless. He can’t wrap his head around Castiel telling him different.
Sam continues to give him the sympathetic look for about another two seconds before rolling his eyes and wrenching the car door open. “No shit, Dean,” he says, ducking into the front seat. “I’ve lived with the two of you for
“Why?” Dean asks, dumbfounded. His mouth goes rogue again and he says, “They’re amazing, Cas. You — you’re amazing.”
The sex-haired beauty sitting beside him regards him with narrowed eyes for a long moment before taking Dean’s hand in a firm, warm grip. “Castiel,” he rumbles, mouth lifting in a tiny smile.
Maybe the next time it does come to a boil, though, he’ll think about a tranquil meadow, untroubled and languid, windmill in the distance turning slow and soothing. The place where a piece of him will stay, always, soaking up the sun and keeping Castiel company.
“Ain’t nothin’ dysfunctional about what just happened, buddy,” Dean says, huffing a low laugh, but Cas is frowning, serious and quiet.
It’s this weird dance thing they’ve got going on, right? Dean comes in swaggering and by the time he’s made his order he’s a complete mess because Mr. Stuck-My-Finger-In-An-Electric-Socket-But-In-A-Good-Way has that goddamn
, and besides, he was sleep-drunk. Or tired-drunk, whatever. All he knew was he was exhausted, his shoulder hurt like hell, and he had to be up at
bit more than he had – which is to say, not at all – but he thinks it’s probably forgivable in this instance since he was Extremely Busy off saving the world and all. But he also realizes Castiel deserves to hear the truth, so however much it feels like he’s cracking his own ribcage open and baring his insides, Dean fortifies himself and ducks his head to catch Cas’ eye.
Castiel is quiet for a moment, collecting his thoughts. Then: “Dean. I know. I do know. I could see it on your soul like a stain as soon as I was back. Your grief. Your sorrow. I thought– I thought it was because of your mother.”
“You don’t have to do this alone,” he adds, gruff and self-conscious, and before Cas can answer, Dean turns tail and runs.
“Yeah, Cas, us,” Dean says, dropping a kiss to his hair, easy affection at odds with how difficult it clearly is for Dean to say these things. Castiel smiles fondly. He thinks about Dean’s prayer to him in Purgatory and how even a year or two ago he would never have been able to say any of it to Castiel, prayer or no. He’s made progress. He’ll keep making progress, of that Castiel is quite certain.
Too many emotions trip over themselves, vying for his attention; it’s impossible for Dean to give voice to any of them beyond what he’s already said. Dean hopes Cas understands. Understands, and knows he deserves someone looking after him, sharing some small measure of affection, after all of the unbelievable shit they’ve survived over the years.
Sam laughs again and heads for the door. “Sure, Dean. Whatever you need.” He disappears into the hallway, leaving Dean alone with his thoughts in an otherwise empty room.
Sam also rolls his eyes, but at the request or their antics it’s hard to say. He grabs the plate with all the fixin’s on it (not just bacon, jeez, Dean’s not an
“Well, give me a fucking minute here, okay!” Dean blurts out, thoroughly freaked. “You could be wearing a goddamn three-piece suit, I’m still trying to wrap my head around you even
Brushing glittering obsidian slivers from his shoulders, Castiel glanced at his feet and watched as a glowing red line materialized out of the nothingness and stretched off, sinuous, into nowhere.
“No, Sam, we don’t. But you know how we could find out? If you go talk to him.” Dean would very much like for his brother to kindly
A blush floods Castiel’s face as he smiles self-consciously, one corner of his mouth tucked up into his cheek, and shakes his head against Dean’s chest. “It was so stupid,” he says, exasperated with himself. “I don’t know
and it is way too early in the morning to be dealing with what’s happening in his pants without coffee first.
. He’s imagined a million different things to say to Cas if he ever got the chance to see him again, and now that he’s here, sitting in the kitchen as though he’d never been gone and having a drink neat as you please, Dean can’t filter out a single one of them that seems appropriate. Not even the arguments — because, of course, the glaring misconceptions in Castiel’s opinion of Dean need to be corrected — feel like they’d hold any water right now.
, he sways his hips a little as he fries up the bacon. He catches Castiel moving from the corner of his eye, the dragon bobbing up and down with Dean as he dances in his kitchen. A grin spreads across Dean’s face.
not act on his instinct to answer Dean’s prayer, and yet every molecule of him was desperate to do so.
Time and again, through meetings, and partings, and meeting again, Castiel came to realize not only was his love for Dean inexorable, it was
Dean shoves his phone back into his pocket, muttering “bitch” under his breath. He huffs out a sigh before reaching for his pen. He picks it up and the dragon gives a little hop, balancing on its hind legs and flaring its wings out to continue its vicious attack on Dean’s innocent writing utensil. Dean notices a flash of darker blue on the dragon’s underside. Curious, he teases the dragon with the pen for a minute, watching it rear up and swat playfully, before scooping the creature up and turning it carefully onto its back.
It’s the first of many, the first of a lifetime of kisses, but as Dean threads his fingers into Castiel’s hair, reveling in the newness of discovery, it feels like they’ve already done this a thousand times before, in a thousand lifetimes, on a thousand worlds. It feels like his heart is home.
to imagine what’s going on in the kid’s head. Can he even call him a kid anymore? He guesses not – however much he and Cas and Sam had had a hand in raising Jack, he’s more, now. Bigger and honed, somehow. Ineffable. Complete.
Dean strokes a long line down Castiel’s back, wondering if he ever misses his feathery wings, and drops a kiss to Castiel’s hair. “Everything okay?” he asks gently, twisting quite impressively to set his muffin behind him on the counter next to his coffee without breaking Castiel’s hold on him.
Instead, he couldn’t help but think, as he traced the outlines and secretly marveled at the colors: if they hadn’t appeared, Meg would be here right now and they’d be creating constellations and telling silly stories, or reading Shakespeare to each other because something about the meter begged for it to be read aloud, and besides, she was the only girl his age who even
acknowledge that he's done so, and bury him not only permanently, but in a place where he'll be tormented for all eternity by a being that has a personal grudge against him. Fuck you, spn showrunners.
Fortunately, he sees Castiel stopped several booths behind, completely absorbed. Dean yells over to Sam that they’ll catch up in a bit and pushes his way through the crowd back to Castiel’s side.
Dean finally looks up at Sam, still surprised by how overjoyed he is that Castiel isn’t gone. Sam is smiling, too. “At least now you know where to look for him if he ever disappears like that again,” his brother says with a nod towards Dean’s pocket, where Castiel’s nose pokes up just over the edge. He barely fits inside anymore, but is clearly content to be tied up in knots and crammed into a tight space as long as he can snuggle right up against Dean.
Dean does his best to ignore the looks Sam keeps shooting him in the rear view, distracting himself by holding Cas upright and feeling him warm and alive against his side. Every so often, Cas twitches and groans, his grace sparking, and Dean just holds him through it and doesn’t think too much about the why.
Well, shit. Dean swallows thickly. He doesn’t want Castiel walking around thinking this is his fault. Dean can give Cas an honest answer, can’t he? After everything Cas has done for them – for
Dean looks up and his eyes roam over every inch of Castiel’s face, as they often do, now. Like he’s making sure Cas is actually, physically here. Like he’s hoping this isn’t all some fucking fever dream. Castiel isn’t sure himself, sometimes. Right now, he can’t be sure he isn’t imagining the quiet hitch in Dean’s breathing, the hesitant look when their gazes clash, the way his jaw flexes as he swallows nervously.
“Sorry,” he says, soft, “sorry. Just. You’ve been actin’ weird all week. Guess I’m worried a little, is all.” Cas huffs and opens his wings, flopping over onto his side, exposing the thin blue stripe on his belly. Dean reaches out to trace it with the tip of his finger before rubbing Cas’ underside in long circular strokes. They lay on the bed in silence until Castiel’s purring softly fills the room. Dean watches his tail twitch back and forth, lazy and slow. Dean sits up, cross-legged, and lifts Cas’ pliant body into his lap. He continues petting Cas on his back, now, head to tail, and Cas sits, beatific, his face pointed up at Dean and his eyes closed, just… enjoying.
And perhaps it was that spark, that fluttering ember, which prompted Castiel to stand still and let Dean finally catch up to him. That spark, which took all of Castiel’s noble intentions and grand ideas about protecting Dean and ground them to ash.
A final nod, a last, desperate glance at Sam, and Dean stalks into the Empty, Castiel’s feather clutched tightly in his hand.
When he finally reached their picnic blanket, Meg was furiously stuffing her towel into a neon pink backpack covered in pins and patches. She threw a glare at him over her shoulder before she reached for her shorts and pulled them on over her bathing suit, movements jerky. When she bent to grab her backpack and throw it over one shoulder, Castiel saw she was still crying.
“If I return to Heaven —” Cas stops and looks cautiously at Dean’s face, an apology in his eyes, though Dean has no idea what it’s for. “If I go back, I won’t be permitted to return to Earth. I’ve already broken the rules.”
“Well,” he says at last, standing and turning the dragon back over, mindful of its blissful lethargy as he drapes it on his shoulder, “let’s see about getting you all set up, huh?” The purring continues, volume increasing, as the dragon cuddles up close to his neck and snuffs up and down the sensitive edge of Dean’s ear. He feels a tiny warm wetness and realizes the dragon’s licked him – is still licking, actually, in what feels like teeny kisses.
Dean’s shoulder burns but Cas won’t let go. Dean grits his teeth and tries to breathe through the pain and his automatic reaction, his hands around Castiel’s wiry body slowly unclenching. Long minutes pass with Dean breathing hard through his nose, reaching for patience, hoping that if he relaxes, then maybe Cas will relax, too.
“Quit your bitchin’,” Dean grumbles, diligently cleaning blood and grime from Castiel’s calf with a wet washcloth. “I’ll be careful, okay?” He glances at Castiel for a heartbeat, and the look goes straight to Castiel’s groin like a lightning rod, powerful and bright, before he hisses in pain as Dean begins his work.
Castiel rolls over on his chest, bringing Dean’s attention back to him and his exposed underbelly. With a soft hum Dean strokes a finger down the long blue stripe adorning Cas’ skin. The dragon looks up at him, eyes half-closed, and purrs louder, his little body quivering from tip to tail. Dean smiles down at Cas and says, “Thank you.” For some reason he feels like he’ll insult Cas if he puts the feather down. So Dean, carefully juggling both the delicate gift and his languid friend, leans over to turn off his lamp and settles himself under the covers.
He definitely remembers falling asleep with the white-and-blue dragon lying on his chest. He doesn’t see Cas immediately, though, so Dean looks over to his nightstand. It’s not uncommon for Cas to curl up around his mug after Dean’s fallen asleep, but when he peers over, there’s no sign of the dragon.
“You told me that good things do happen,” he says at last, glancing up at Castiel and holding his gaze. “We’ve lost so many people, so many times, I guess I’m just not used to the coming back part, still.”
I'm so thankful for this fandom and the friends I've made through it. I'm thankful for all of the stories I've read that have made me feel seen and validated. And I'm super thankful that SPN lit the fire in me to write again, and for all of you, who are taking the time and energy to read my meager offerings to the incredible extant body of work that is destiel fan fiction.
And Cas, practically transparent and arched up off the floor like a bow, suddenly snaps back into this plane of existence and collapses in a heap. The cacophony of Cas’ screams cuts off just as suddenly as it began, and Dean cautiously takes his hands away from his ears. He looks over and sees Sam’s are bleeding. Not good. They sit in the echoing silence for a moment more before terror explodes back out of Dean in a rush.
Jack smiles and shakes his head. “I’m sorry, Dean,” he says simply. “If I’m going to stay, I have to remain… impartial.”
sparks through the air, skipping along every inch of Dean’s skin and making the hair stand up all over his body. From the corner of his eye, he sees Sam shudder.
The more monsters he could draw off and fight, the safer Dean would be. The more Dean could rest and regroup perhaps meant he would survive long enough to find a way out of this place.
He gets out of the car and pulls his jacket tight around him, and heads right back out the way he came in, on foot, taking the longer walk around to the bunker’s main entrance in the chilly December night, inviting the cold snap against his face, the cloudy puffs of air swirling out in front of his mouth. He welcomes the bite of the wind, the crackling sounds of leaves and detritus under his boots, the silvered light of the moon and sprinkling of stars overhead. Welcomes them and takes comfort in their presence, or more, his being here to actually enjoy them.
Looking at Cas now, seeing how he carries this weight around with him, makes Dean’s heart ache. He knows he can’t let Cas keep carrying it alone anymore. He knows what he wants. And… and he believes that he can have it. He
Out of nowhere, the memory of Castiel’s weight slams into Dean, the way he’d felt in his arms as Dean carried him, senseless and sorrowful, into the house to lay him out on the kitchen table. A pang stabs through his gut when he thinks about how carefully he’d rolled Cas onto the wooden surface, cradling his neck so his head didn’t smack onto it; how he’d looked in the light, how Dean’s heart felt like it was being torn completely asunder as he wrapped Cas in colorful curtains because a plain white sheet just didn’t seem right.
He stomps all the way to his room, feeling the cloying tension in the library sliding over his skin, following him as he disappears deeper into the bunker, far away from Dean.
– around his neck and then mashing a hat Eileen had knitted for him down on his head. The long tan trench coat he’d picked out at their local thrift shop hangs off his frame, giving him a slightly starved look, and as much as Dean hates the thing (he’d argued that it was going to be too cold for such a light jacket soon, anyway, but Castiel had been insistent), he knows that Castiel likes it, and that’s all that matters. It turns out Castiel happens to have an eye for the strange, the weird, the discarded. Like the coat, and the mug, and Dean.
