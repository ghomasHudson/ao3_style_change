“Protect me from what?” Steve grunted, keeping his tone in check and not letting any sliver of pettiness in the way. He’d just sound like a child and his reputation—whatever that was—might not lead to good results in the future. “I’m sorry. I just want to see my country after… seventy odd years? I think this is unfair.”
He bent down to get the bags that Steve had carried the whole night for the both of them, and called Happy, who was just relieved to hear him safe.
on how we could meet again, without people hounding us, ever. I’m going to spend the shit out of this time.”
“Nah,” Tony shook his head. “-I’m fine, despite bulldozing on me. Continue doing your running.” He waved his hand. “I’m chill.”
“Alright, this is enough, I need to walk again.” He declared, shooting up from the bench and startling the resting Steve. He felt bad immediately. “Oh, uh, didn’t mean to startle you.” He laughed awkwardly.
Steve gave him a full once-over, and Tony involuntarily stood in a way that showed his best assets, which was a dangerous smile and absolutely great back. And everything else that wasn’t hidden by his stuffy costume. The blond blushed lightly, shifting to stand straighter, newspaper clutched on his other hand to the side. “Okay. If you really are a star, or an actor, I just assumed that you were trying to be under the radar, with your… costume.”
He looked at his chicken tentatively when Tony didn’t answer right away, then just quietly ate his food.
Steve looked at him at the corner of his eyes. “But we’re just walking, why would that already make you ache?”
Tony blinked, and wiped his eyes with his ridiculous coat sleeves. “What? What about the time machine?”
He knew he was being vague with everything he was saying. It seemed like Steve really didn’t have any idea who he was, because he had been spilling his stories left and right and the man had just regarded him with awe.
“Well, you’re a tech-genius, you might.” Steve mused, scratching his chin in thought. “I believe you can do it.”
Steve’s eyes crinkled in genuine joy, and Tony found his lips stretching into a smile. “Yeah, Tony. Yes.”
“He’s swell.” He almost said immediately, making her raise her eyebrows. “I, hm. He’s really great, with his green technology and his arc reactor. He’s got the Maria Stark Foundation and—“, he stopped as he noticed Maria’s stare. ”—such.”
Steve breathed out a laugh, lifting his other hand to stroke Tony’s cheek. “That was very cheesy, and you say you don’t say cheesy things.”
“Steve,” Tony whispered, because he was getting a sense of who was standing in front of him. How his mind ended up on that, he didn’t know, but he knew to trust his instincts. “Steve.”
“Stop it.” Steve mumbled, suddenly conscious, promptly ignoring her proposal. “I just want to see him again.”
Steve willed his face into a blank slate as the redhead roller her eyes in response to Agent Hill. “Miss Romanoff.”
(Epilogue will be in a few days. I'd love to hear your comments! Also, thank you to those who gave me comments aa)
you try talking for five hours and more straight.” Tony mumbled against his chest. “This is a give and take. I tour you around, you give me compliments, you kiss me, I kiss you, I say stuff, and you say stuff.” He prodded his arm and his lips quirked a little at a little realization. “Come on now. You still haven’t said why you were looking at the clock.”
The man looked defeated, and distraught was visible in every part of his body. Steve felt his heart clench, and he wanted to reach out, but it was obvious that Tony wasn’t done.
There was a beat of silence before he sighed. “I’m sorry, JARVIS. I’m just stressed. I don’t need someone babysitting me, god, I’m an adult.”
“Thank you.” He took the card and hurried to the elevator. He didn’t need to look back to see that Steve was trailing behind him, tentative and unsure.
“Okay, yes, that’s actually an insult, so no, I won’t call you chicken, no siree,” Tony waved his hands. “Jesus Christ. I can’t keep my mouth shut.”
Okay no lie, I was in ugly tears at the 7 am part asldjkksad Please tell me your thoughts down below!
“Hello to you too, you adorable dork.” Tony laughed, kissing him fully on the lips. He held his face between his hands.
The man gave a squirrely smile, like he somehow took his wallet. Tony idly checked his pockets—his wallet was still there, so it just meant that he was just fidgety. The guy didn’t also seem to be innocent enough not to look like a thief, but hey, looks were deceiving.
person I’ve ever heard say that. Board meetings are the worst!” He looked at his bag and got a gold-wrapped ball. “You want?”
heartfelt laugh came out of Steve’s mouth, surprising Tony. He felt alive. Like those—like those plants, that lived under the electric charges of lightning. Tony—he sought out Tony.
Tony looked at his hand and tentatively reached for it, and couldn’t help a smile when the man accepted it. “Sunrise, huh? After your little romantic tryst on the tower, I didn’t think you’d even do anything more romantic than that.”
“Steve,” he breathed out when they separated for air. “—Steve, shit, this isn’t some one-sided thing?”
his mind shouted, amidst his ragged breathing. Why did Steve want to see the sunrise with him? Because those things—those are for
A smile appeared on the other man’s face, and somehow Tony’s guilt that was bubbling in his stomach ebbed away. That smile could cure cancer, if that was possible. “I said, Tony, the Chocolate Connoisseur who talks a lot. Not the Billionaire.”
“Dr. Banner, yes,” Steve had smiled, and shook his hand as the man approached him. “Intelligent and capable. Plus more, I assume.”
Steve was the one to release the kiss, but not the embrace. “Did I just see sparks?” he sounded awed.
wasn’t the right word for that conversation, but the man was truly brilliant, in many ways than one.)
those were the safest areas. People made sure that the main tent was the safest because war operations happened in them. Meetings were important, and safe, and everyone in the room is there to save someone.
So he didn’t mean to just stare at nothing. He jolted when someone smaller than him—and oh god, the one with the particular beard trim that he
Tony in turn was sleeping; he was on his lap, quiet. He had dozed off moments after sitting next to him, and wasn’t even able to eat the bag of chips he bought earlier.
When they got onto their floor, the air was tense, and a bit constricting. Tony unlocked their door, quietly, mind still
It was such an inane, little request, and Tony, for once in his life, realized that he never had seen the sunrise just for what it is.
“Are you some kind of a secret agent?” He suddenly asked. Steve’s eyes widened in what he presumed to be confusion, so he barreled on. “Like—how can you
“Steve.” Tony answered back, a smirk on his face. He turned his gaze to the water, and Steve followed him.
“Tony?” He gently asked, taking into note the numerous bags surrounding him. “Are you alright? What happened?”
Tony stopped walking suddenly, making Steve bump onto him. “Tony-!” he spluttered. “Tony you shouldn’t do that oh my god I’ve been hitting you—“, and then Steve was checking him like a harried nurse. But Tony wasn’t responding—no.
“Stark.” Fury called with a deadpan. “How nice of you to join us so early. I didn’t think you’d be here for another, let’s say, hour?”
“Tony.” He laughed, just glad that Tony was next to him. Learning to not mind Tony’s little ministrations was more fun than not experiencing them at all. It was probably the same as how he kept stroking Tony’s back. “I still need this. Got to save the world as Captain America, after all.”
Steve clasped together his hands, and stared off to the other side, to a tree. “Stall the time machine. I wouldn’t have met you if I changed anything differently.”
Steve searched his face for something—a sign on why he was asking so, but shrugged. “It might be cool to have one, just in your laboratory or your sink for dishwashing. You know.”
Steve quirked an eyebrow. “Tony, you ordered Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Ice Cream. You said you wanted to check out the chocolate shop after eating dinner. You thought Ferrero Roche was going to take over the chocolate industry. How am I not supposed to call you one?”
“Let me believe in magic, for once in my life. Let me believe in something that I’ve never had before.”
Steve laughed, pushing him to their table gently. “Nah, I think I overreacted as well. I’m sorry.” He sat down after pulling Tony’s seat, which,
“You are sometimes annoying, and this? Random things about me?” He poked the man on the cheek with his free hand. “It does. Things. Don’t do it Tony.”
His hands shook, suddenly. “Steve, I just—realized, that I’m not someone who should be with you.” Steve was silent, which made him even more nervous, if it was possible. “Steve—I want, so much, but I can’t, because I’m me. I have.” His words were lost. “I have one night.”
Steve had to break out a laugh at that, pleased to see the smile on Tony’s face. “I know you would.”
“Or something,” Steve admitted, hunching over as if trying to look smaller in his place. Not that Tony noticed, because the man was huge and he was sitting in a chair that was smaller than his shoulder width. “—kind of a relaxing thing to me.”
he knew that voice, have heard it in different ways, from sad, to melancholic, to happy, to elated. Now, it sounded confident, brilliant, and undeniably—
“They tried a lot,” Steve chuckled morosely. “That night with you was the only time I was actually out of SHIELD premises.”
Steve kissed the man again, and again, and again, until even his super soldier-enhanced lungs felt like bursting. “I’m sorry, baby, please tell you’ve forgiven me,” he pleaded, putting his head on the crook of Tony’s neck. He lingered a kiss on it, stroking Tony’s back at the same time. “I let you down.”
Tony. She was the one who filmed us in the café.” Then, after a beat, he muttered, “And she didn’t tell me earlier.”
He sighed as he picked the punching bag from the floor, mulling over the past week that he has been basically trapped in SHIELD’s “helicarrier” (or whatever they called it). So far, he has seen six people not recognize him, two people recognize him but weren’t allowed to approach, and if he was being honest, he was just craving for someone to talk with, just not with Nick Fury or Maria Hill. Coulson was pretty nice, but Phil usually lost composure around him.
His slightly-inebriated (very slightly, he hasn’t even gotten half of the bottle) brain wired into working again just to check if that was the guy earlier, because meeting New Yorkers two times in a row was surprising, since everyone was usually so busy.
and honestly he wasn’t listening anymore because that was one of the nicest things someone has ever said about him and his extravagance.
He couldn’t stop the tears from flowing, and he was doing this weak attempt to hit the man hugging him. It was futile, and he was spilling so much, and he didn’t know what he was saying.
“Today, you’ll be meeting your team.” Fury directed, crossing his arms. “I expect that you will be able to reign in your teammates, if ever they are out of the line. You were regarded as a tactical master, more brains than brawn if ever. I will depend on that ability for you to be able to lead this team, because you are a bunch of individuals that have not interacted before.”
“Look, humor me. You’re young looking, are you like, twenty-two?” The other man raised his eyebrows.
“Well, yeah, what’s not amazing about that? You’re intelligent, Tony.” He meant it, because someone who just had those degrees weren’t pushovers. Had a company that apparently did “green energy and technology”, whatever that meant today. And he was just, so, brilliant. He suddenly felt small, and insignificant. “God, I’m—I’m.” He went silent.
“I remember the words as ‘little shit’, but okay.” He could feel Tony’s smile. “That’s true. Oh. You’re tarnished now.”
Tony climbed over to meet him face to face, and they paused for a moment, just staring into each other’s eyes.
Tony huffed, lightly patting his chest in a mock punch. “No, I reserve that with certain types of people.”
Tony’s eye twitched, rounding to him, glaring. Steve stopped immediately. “Okay, I can detect some type of condescension here.”
Steve looked out of breath, but a wide grin was in his gorgeous face, and it felt like Tony was whole. “I think I’m in love with you.”
“It’s not, believe me.” It boggled his mind that Steve could read him well, just after a few hours. He had to remedy that. “I’ve made my face as unreadable as possible, for the—“
He had, after Nick Fury escorted him out of Time Square. He requested to be brought back to SHIELD as normally as possible. He’d ridden the trains. At least trains were still the same, just a lot more electricity-based.
Tony laughed out loud. “Shit, why’d I’d ever think you were innocent, I don’t know why. You are a dangerous man, Steve.” He kissed him fully on the lips, laughing. “One night, and your personality goes three hundred and sixty.”
But no; Steve, adorable, awkward, parade-rest-when-embarrassed, artistic Steve, was a far braver man than anyone he has ever met in the world and in his lifetime. He took his opportunity, tilted his whole world by its axis, and shook him to the core. That kiss changed
nothing for him, because it was basic human decency, but Tony’s been around people who’d rather see people burn than live, so it was a nice change of pace. It wasn’t a big gesture, but Tony always preferred smaller, more meaningful ones, anyway.
Tony suddenly clapped, startling Bruce beside him. “Right!” He shouted loudly. Natasha smirked even more, in his line of sight; Tony had blatantly taken the bait she had laid.
The elevator was quiet, and as they reached the first floor and the elevators opened, the employee looked at them both and laughed.
Not that anyone would even care to barge in at this time, because from what he has learned, whenever he was in the gym, Nick Fury would clear the area because he was still a “state secret”. Which is new, because after being Captain America, he attracted too much attention sometimes.
“—all that time, I was. I was imagining coming home to you, after this. Somehow, I just know, that I belong with you, here.” He murmured truthfully. “And I don’t know how to handle that, but—“
He secretly looked at the other man, who was somehow content, feeling the breeze of the night. He looked peaceful, just sitting there, and Tony felt disgusted at himself because of different things. He’s been making the man bring his impulse buying as well.
of a person being a potential reincarnation who has a hidden agenda of taking over the world’s chocolate industry. How was I supposed to think?”
“You do know Grand Central Station, right?” The other teen—one with bright red hair—asked curiously. “That’s somehow been in your knowledge being a tourist.”
Steve breathed in deeply, eyes open wide, a contented smile setting on his face. “Just thinking about you.” He admitted, sliding a hand over Tony’s back. “And a lot of things.”
Tony blinked, and then as if that was the funniest thing that had happened to him his whole life, doubled over, clutching his stomach from laughing. Some onlookers became curious, and Steve was rapidly becoming red (from embarrassment or worry, he didn’t know).
Steve silently watched Nick Fury walk from each end of the platform he was standing on, perfectly content on sitting down and watching people in SHIELD run their own business. He was officially in his Captain America suit (which wasn’t… what he wore in the past, weirdly enough, it was spandex) and apparently, Fury had started the Avengers Initiative.
Steve didn’t budge, busying himself with eating his ice cream, trying not to make eye contact with the other man.
things while I’m planning here, and while being naked. How dare you,” he was furiously scratching out something from the pad paper. From his enhanced hearing, he could hear Tony mumble out, “—making me feel this way it’s so stupid, it’s my arc reactor he doesn’t get to make me feel this way…”
“Damn you, Steve,” Tony whispered, gathering the things as he saw Happy arrive. Every step felt like he was walking in quicksand, ready to fall at any second. For a moment, he thought it wouldn’t end like this, but he knew reality would come crashing down once again.
It felt like time was going faster again, and by his internal clock, it was around two in the morning, and he didn’t know what that means.
Tony looked up to him and kissed him lightly on the lips. “Can you tell me?” He asked, holding Steve’s hands. “And different things in between? I promise I’d keep them secret. No paparazzi will hear them.”
Tony patted Steve’s stomach, which made him blush. “But I think I’d have that ingrained in my brain, honestly.”
“They called me a miracle... I was asthmatic and attracted diseases left and right. Would probably fall victim to the common cold in the past. I had all allergies known to man. My mother had to check everything so I wouldn’t just have attacks left and right.”
That warmed Tony all over, more than he would like to admit. “You aren’t real, Steve. You aren’t, at all. How the fuck are you alive?”
the man? He was so out of it that somehow his senses didn’t register the man in his way. Usually it would’ve been his body angling him to avoid any obstruction) and that did not settle well with him.
Tony wanted to say something, but Steve kissed his head again, silencing him. “And yes, I know—I don’t know you, Tony, and I don’t know what will happen after this day. Maybe we go back to who we are, what are lives are. But I’m not going to deny and forget this night with you. You’re amazing, Tony, and I can’t believe I’ve got to know you.”
It was only after a few minutes that Steve broke off the embrace, and he stopped himself from whining at the loss of contact.
“You’re such a little cheeky shit, you know that.” Tony griped. “ I can’t believe you—“ The hair on the back of his neck stood up when he felt the golden foil hurtling—and there wasn’t any other word but
“I’m an inventor,” Tony suddenly said. He led them to an area named Bryant Park. Steve thought it was calm, and befitting the mood. “I create things. Technology is my forte. I made my first circuit board at four. Built my first gun at six.”
Natasha had an indecipherable look on her eyes, but she had a knowing smile now, not a smirk, which comforted Steve a little. “I didn’t peg Captain America as a romantic, honestly. None of your files ever said that.”
“You could stop doing parade rest, Steve.” He jokingly said, raising his eyebrows. “Your muscles are so tense that
He suddenly stood up, and he went over a woman, to the end of the room. Tony curiously looked over, wondering what his companion for the night was going to do.
Tony didn’t know how he ended up shopping around the chocolate shop in Grand Central Station, but he did.
“I like this pod,” Steve stated plainly. “If this is what I have to do to help, then I’ll do it. Besides,” Steve’s voice softened, “it’s the closest thing to home than what I’ve had for a long time.” Howard gave him a small smile. Steve’s face hardened with guilt. “Also, if it’s true that Prince Tony is barely breathing because of me, I don’t deserve any less.” Howard’s face turned solemn.
angry. Angry at the Winter Soldier. Of all his time in his grief, Steve never had anyone to blame. Now he did. He wanted to… He wanted... What did he want? Steve didn’t know. Then he realized, he wasn’t angry at the Winter Soldier. Why? His own thoughts didn’t even make sense to him. Why was he housing this newfound anger? Where was it coming from?
“When my friend tried to pull me from under the rubble before you came to help, I lost a few scales,” he replied.
Both of them locked eyes. Steve tried to find the right words to say, but all he could focus on was the Soldier’s eyes. They gave no sign of recognition.
"Aahhsssss!" He tried to keep himself quiet for the others who hadn't woken up yet and his outburst came out as a hiss. He fell to his hands and tail and turned around just in time to see the doorknob click in its place.
Tony watched with worry. Frustrated that he was compromised. Frustrated that he couldn’t swim to Steve and protect him.
“Speaking of ‘anything for my best friend’, I asked Father for something a little special for you -- before the whole argument happened so it’s already written in stone until you die. Or get fired.” Tony said. Pepper frowned in confusion. Then, Tony gave a small respectful bow, “Doctor Virginia ‘Pepper’ Potts, Honorable Physician of the Royal Court.” Pepper gasped.
P.S. - IF YOU ARE CONFUSED ON A PART OF THE STORY; Please let me know in the comments so that I can do my best to fix it and make it the least confusing I can.
“Who are you?” Steve asked. The Winter Soldier stopped for a moment. His brows furrowed as he locked eyes with Steve but didn’t answer. “You used to be somebody,” Steve persisted. “I heard you were a prince.”
“He is,” Thor agreed and smiled. “He also tried to get rid of the spear of Laufey but no matter how hard he tried it would always return to him. Though the potion wore off, there were still permanent side effects. It affected me too since I consumed the potion and the potion is magic. We gained the power of the change, as you saw us earlier. I obtained the power of underwater thunder, and Loki obtained the power of illusion. We named ourselves Thunderer and Deceit. We kept our powers to ourselves therefore, no one knew but us. Loki shield's our faces with illusion so no one would see our faces.
Steve was a little surprised at the contact but hugged back -- fist still closed with a metal chain similar to his own in it. Loki’s green glowing spear grew into a blinding white light. Steve buried his face in the crook of Tony’s neck to block out the light. Tony shut his eyes.
Speaking of the nation’s patriotic icon, Tony clicked on his chat bubble with Steve on the tablet and read their conversation last night. His husband had sent two pictures to him: one was a photo of Steve, Nat, Maria Hill, and a newbie named Sam if he was not mistaken. The other photo was Steve himself, smiling goofily at the camera with a caption that reads “See you tomorrow!”, which was today. Steve and co. were on a mission to make HYDRA’s plans meet their ends after the sudden news of the organization had infiltrated a lot of firms, companies, and agencies, including S.H.I.E.L.D. Steve had also told him about the once alleged story of the Winter Soldier that turned out to be true and the guy behind the mask: James Buchanan Barnes.
Now, looking at his empty coffee cups and then at Steve, he probably would think that his husband will lecture him if he ever found out Tony had been drinking more than a cup of coffee without a meal to accompany with. The thought alone made him smile to himself, wishing they were back to their lovely domesticity at the tower right now without any villains devastating their moment.
Steve giggled. They had been in this situation before where Tony returned to the tower exhausted and injured after a major scuffle with the alleged ‘Mandarin’ guy. Steve almost had a panic attack after witnessing the absence of the arc reactor’s glow on Tony’s chest. He ran towards the genius, slinging his arms over his and walked him to Tony’s floor. Although Tony had reminded him that he was good, Steve still insisted to help. After Tony described to him about his incident, Steve’s mind went into complete worry. Poor Steve, terrified with the idea of Tony leaving him alone in this world. He had the rest of his friends, sure, but Tony was just… perfect.
“JARVIS, look up to any info on the relationship between the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes, and HYDRA.” Tony requested as he slouched on his chair while ignoring angry orders from the board members to pay attention during the meeting.
Bucky gestured Nat with a peace gesture and the super spy nodded. She reached out her back pocket to grab something and revealed three copies of a mesh Photostatic Veil from her grip. He recalled her once telling she used the veil to go undercover and spy on a former HYDRA agent; as expected, she succeeded in her mission. She’s the Black Widow.
"It hurts so much, Rhodey. Why on earth would he do this to me?" Tony started sobbing, grasping onto the flip phone.
Speaking of the billionaire, Steve, slowly but surely, started to fall deeply in love with Tony Stark. Since living in the tower, a conversation or a chat between him and Tony surely happened – Steve asking him questions about the 21st century and Tony providing comfort for the super soldier. Most times, his gaze would land on Tony’s gorgeous face and memorized every detail of it. He would then sketch the man’s features precisely on each page of his sketchbook and hug them before sleeping at night. He believed that this would help reduce his nightmares and thankfully, it worked.
“Since you spewed out all of your words, Nat, now I’m terribly missing Sharon and S.H.I.E.L.D.” Clint dropped all of the snacks on the couch and slumped himself next to the food, clearly indicating he needs a short rest.
Tony threw the flip phone towards the wall with an amount of force, but the phone didn't break or had a single dent on it. He was frustrated and began to fret about Steve's whereabouts. Tears were streaming down his face as he felt guilty for not picking up the phone. He slumped against the TV cabinet, crying his eyes and heart out.
His eyes glistened as the one shot of beer went down into his throat. He was feeling a certain satisfaction at the moment since Steve left. The drink gave Tony a little while to forget all of his pain, all of his bewildering thoughts. He needed more. He poured more alcohol in his glass and took another shot.
And Bucky was right, unfortunately. JARVIS had confirmed a hidden base underneath the abandoned bank, with two passages connecting the above and below.
He was fortunate enough that the previous incident was just a minor setback and didn’t compromise the whole experiment. Call him a perfectionist all you want, but he wouldn’t back down from an issue and pressed on and on until he’s satisfied and reached his goal.
He grabbed a pair of fine tip scissors and set up another anastomosis between the arteries. Using a synthetic suture, he ligated both of the arteries in an end-to-side configuration to ensure no sudden slips and snaps between the muscles and the blood vessels.
“I hate it when you’re right,” Tony scoffed in annoyance as he saw a smug crept up the man’s face. “So, you’re saying?”
Bucky’s voice interrupted his thoughts. He looked up and saw a weak smile on his face. “It’s not your fault for what happened to Steve. He would be proud of you instead.”
He asked Bucky to confirm that they were in the same HYDRA base that once held and imprisoned the Winter Soldier, and he nodded. A wave of relief and anxiety dampened his heart: they were in the right place, and Steve might still be in jeopardy.
He would be a sailor on the ship with Bucky, then a storm would come. He'd look up to the sky and see a red symbol. A skull with 6 tentacles. Black tentacles would come out of the water and come towards him. He'd scream something and the tentacles would stop and turn to take Bucky. For the last 2 years, he never knew what he screamed in the dream. Last night, it was crystal clear; "Hail Hydra". He had to write it down.
"When we arrived, the merman was fighting bravely against Obadiah Stane," Thor declared. "Our battle cries distracted him and Obadiah struck the merman."
"That is one nasty mark you got. Just a poke and it hurts like hell right?" Steve nodded. "And it's an open wound. That would rate a 42 on the scale so about 3 weeks."
“This is a useless condition when there is only 1 of the 3 available to give consent of my request! Loki is missing, and your son has been unconscious in the infirmary for the past 2 days alongside the foreigner.”
“Let’s,” King Howard nodded. They made their way to the throne room. Guards, led by none other than Captain Carol Danvers, joined them around 3 quarters of the way there. She gave Steve a distrusting look. They confronted the doors of the throne room.
“Oh, that’s not that bad,” Steve shrugged. “The first time I was dragged in there, they rated me at 42.”
“Odin,” Howard spoke in a soft voice. “Relax. Yes, my son is barely breathing because of this merman’s blood.” Howard gestured to Steve. “But it was my son’s choice. He saved this merman. This merman saved him a week before. The merman is not at fault for my son's actions.”
"Steve!" He turned to see Tony swimming after him. Steve tried to swim faster but he couldn't swim properly. His tail kicked around aimlessly. It wasn't helping. Tony soon caught up. Steve slowed to a stop and faced Tony. "Steve... Why did you think you were going to be banished?"
"Yes, sir, almost every night for the last 2 years, sir." The Shield stopped glowing when Steve took hold of the railing for support.
"Oh! Wait. Sorry. It’s your ring. You um… dropped it when Obadiah hit you. Here," Tony said handing him the shield/ring back.
“Hey!” A familiar voice called causing Steve to turn his head, the developing anger relinquished. It was the lieutenant from earlier.
“I’ll escort myself out, sir.” Steve miniaturized the shield, put it on his finger, and turned to leave.
Tony struggled for who knows how long, trying to get Steve through the tunnels and to the castle entrance. Steve helped as much as he could but eventually passed out due to the amount of blood he lost. The pressure Tony was creating on Steve’s back was slowing the blood loss. Tony didn’t fail to notice how close their tails came to wrapping around each other — which, for merpeople, was a very romantic gesture.
Three mermen followed the Black Widow. The first was a green-skinned merman with a ‘hulk’ of muscles. His tail was purple with a green gamma symbol on his lap. He was almost 3 times bigger than Steve.
Steve didn’t think. He let his instinct take over. He took the Soldier’s arm and flipped counterclockwise so that he twisted the Soldier’s nonmetal arm in a painful position and swung around using the Soldier’s arm for momentum and, with the knee part of his tail, kneed the Winter Soldier in the back.
“The formalities are necessary so all know who the superior is, Prince Tony,” Captain Danvers said bowing deeply.
“You are too merciful,” Odin spat out. “I shall stay here until our sons give their consents. I’ll see you at the trial.” With that, Odin left. There was a moment of uncomfortable silence.
"Ok, so the names are the ones in use. The other marks are the rooms you get to choose from. They aren't in use."
The scream came, not from a man, from another merman. His red and gold tail looked metallic. Like a metal suit. He had brown hair long enough to float in the water with an anchor beard and a mustache. His left hand was in a red and gold battered, metal gauntlet. There were parts of battered red and gold armor still clinging to the merman’s upper body and a light blue glow in the center of his chest.
"He was angry at me and took it out on you. I'll talk to him tomorrow or- today," Tony chuckled as he checked the clock on the wall. "5:30 a.m. already?" Tony muttered.
But the change didn’t stop there. An upper part of a suit the same shade of blue for his new tail formed around his upper body there was a white star in the center of his chest and 2 thick white strips wrapping around his shoulders aligned to the star. A mask formed around his face covering his blonde hair.
The last chapter was kind of short... Ok! Ok! It was REALLY short. I hope this chapter kind of makes up for it.
“Bruce? My son’s friend? Why?” King Howard turned to see Steve leaned against the door frame for support. “Are you alright?”
“And what, dear Father, does King Howard think of this spontaneous request?” Thor looked up at Howard, who was able to calm down a little.
“Tony said that his father, the King, doesn’t know about his suit hence, he doesn’t know Tony is IronTail. Does the king know about the group?”
When the glow died down, they looked to see a blonde, muscular merman. His tail had changed to a lighter blue and his scales had a white reflection. The tips of his fins had the alternating striped pattern of red and white. The merman had a chain around his neck. It had a name on it:
"The tail change, I can’t explain. I do know that the shield glows only 3 different colors for 3 different purposes. I believe Blue; is when you first claim the shield, White; when you give the shield a command or a summoning, and Red; no patriot has been able to discover what that does. In this case, you manipulate the shield's form. That is not one of the normal functions of the shield. In fact, only 1 of the 6 previous Patriots was able to do this. This function of the shield is a bonus — a courtesy of your righteousness."
Tony thought when he saw her leave. When Steve delivered a blow to the Soldier’s back, Hawkeye gave a quiet but excited “Go Steve!”.
Tony lead them to the infirmary to get Steve to finally treat the wound on his back. Tony felt guilty for the mark on Steve back. It was his gauntlet from his suit that gave Steve the mark.
Wow! Thank you so much for the Kudos, comments, and views! It's more than I thought I'd get. I know this is a shorter chapter. I promise I'll post something tomorrow or even later tonight. I'm on a roll today -- writing wise -- and I'm always excited to share my writing as soon as it's done!
“Alright,” ‘Fury’ said as he opened the doors and swam into the room. Steve's shield followed hence Steve was dragged with it into the room. The room was a study filled with books and maps. “What’s your name?”
“I will not give my answer, Father. Not without Loki. Not without Prince Tony. King Howard is right on that matter.” Thor swam away, not allowing anyone else to speak.
"Am I going to be banished?" Steve looked into Tony's brown eyes. Tony could see the sadness and loneliness in Steve's eyes. Then Steve looked at everyone else. Queen Maria spoke first.
"Anyways, past aside, will you come with us to Hydra?” Steve swam backward. His back fin hit the rock wall he was pushed against earlier. He looked up to see the top edge of the rock wall curved out enough that if Steve swam up to escape, he would hurt his back so much, it may never heal correctly. He had to be careful.
Steve tackled the Winter Soldier and caught the Soldier by surprise, causing him to loosen his grip on the mermaid who wrestled her way out of the Soldier’s arms and was gasping for breath.
Steve looked around. At the base of the pool, there was a tunnel. Curious, he clumsily made his way through the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, there was a mirror-like wall and a big bolder with carving. Other than that, the tunnel was mainly empty. He first looked into the mirror out of nagging curiosity. He was extremely muscular and had gills on both sides of his rib cage. His human upper part was decorated in scattered individual blue scales. His tail was made of blue scales and gave a white reflection. He looked more closely and saw the tips had a striped pattern of red and white.
Steve’s blood was all down Tony’s abdomen and tail. Steve’s wound was creating another cloud of blood. Tony looked up when he heard a piercing shriek.
"Follow Director Fury." The shield and Steve started glowing white. Steve's glow died down after a moment. It brought Steve upright forcefully and suddenly jerked him forward towards ‘Director Fury’. "Ah!" Steve exclaimed out of surprise. The ‘Director’ shushed him and continued down the hall the shield followed dragging Steve with it for a while. When ‘Director Fury’ finally stopped in front of a large set of double doors he turned to see the white glowing shield dragging Steve and cracked a smile. Steve smiled back sheepishly.
“It seems fitting that the first of the two to wake is the foreigner,” Odin sneered. Steve automatically felt unbelievably guilty. It showed on his face. Howards face remained calm. Why?
“Let’s see,” Steve said. The mermaid opened her mouth to protest, but the Winter Soldier swam at Steve, attacking him. Steve avoided the knife. The Winter Soldier swung the knife at Steve again and Steve blocked it. He tried to disarm the Soldier by holding the Soldier’s arm back but the Soldier dropped the knife and caught it with his metal arm and proceeded to try to stab Steve again. The 2 mermen danced around like this for a while. The Soldier's knife skills were superb.
“I’ve cast an illusion. They can’t see you. They won't get in your way. I’ll find a safe place to make the change back,” Loki said quickly to Tony. “Just get him to the infirmary.” Then he swam right through the guards and down to the city.
"Hello, Sir." Steve jumped at the disembodied voice and, becoming unbalanced, fell forward. Tony swam over to him and wrapped Steve's arm around his shoulder. "How may I assist you?" Steve's cheeks turned a little pink.
“I’m very sure, sir,” Steve assured. Halfway down to the dorms were Bruce and the others slept, Steve gave a small hiss of pain as he leaned on a wall for support. King Howard barely heard it.
"Let's get you a room in the castle to stay in," Tony chuckled. Thor and Loki wrapped Steve's arms around their shoulders and the 7 of them started to make their way to the door. Pepper grabbed Tony before he left.
“My apologies, sir, I only just found the shield yesterday. And how did you know my ring was actually a shield?”
“Because of this,” Steve took the dart off the nightstand and handed it to Bruce. “The Winter Soldier tried to get him with it.”
“This will be a sentencing trial in a week. We caught one of the vigilantes,” Dum Dum said gleefully. “But today, and probably for the rest of the week, this is a Court of Argument. King Odin of the Asgardian pod wants his sons back.”
"That potion is not to be messed with!" The strawberry blonde nurse said quietly but urgently. "It has the power to show the user the past!"
“STEVE!” Tony yelled when he reached Steve he floated down next to him. “Steve?” Tony said softly. “Are you ok?” Steve didn’t respond. He didn’t even look up.
“It was my choice to tell you my past as well as Tony’s when he told me a part of his. None of you said anything afterward, so I thought it wasn’t my business.”
friend,” Tony said with a cocky grin. “Tell the others about your promotion a little later when I get you a copy of the document with the Royal family’s seal -- which is in my room -- so you have proof.” Tony winked. “Anyways, exciting news aside, we should probably check on Steve." Pepper nodded, not able to wipe the smile off her face. The 2 headed to Steve where the nurses were already wrapping the wound.
“I want you to come back to Asgard, my son,” Odin said quicker than Howard could say anything. He swam up to Thor. “Both you and Loki. I want you back as the Princes of Asgard that you were.” Thor raised an eyebrow.
“How about this; My son and your sons will be given your request. If there is no problem among the 3 of them, Thor and Loki may return to you and your pod and become the princes of the Asgardian pod once again.” Steve frowned.
The 2 kings were now in an argument. Both Queens trying to calm their husbands-! Well... Queen Frigga of Asgard was. King Howard was on the verge of bursting out in frustration.
“I… c-can’t,” Hawkeye managed. His voice showed he desperately wanted to. “I have orders to keep you all safe. I shoot, I draw attention to us. I can’t leave you unguarded. I’m c- I’m compromised,” He said with pain in his voice.
“Your banishment?! Why don’t I remember? And why, above all, did I want to banish you?” The King looked genuinely concerned.
"You know, the mermen who have wielded the shield you hold have had recurring dreams. They were all warnings of enemies they would eventually have to face." Steve thought for a moment.
There, in the middle of the new room was a rock. Embedded in it was a red, white, and blue shield with a white star in the middle. Around the room there were statues but Steve didn't pay much attention to them. Steve made his way to the shield. On the rock it was embedded in, there were more words carved.
"What did I tell you? He saved me!" Tony looked at the others. He made a motion with his hands that made Steve notice the ring he was wearing. It looked like his shield.
Tony swam around so he was swimming on top of Steve’s back and slipped both arms underneath Steve’s armpits and locked his hands around Steve’s chest. Tony slowly brought Steve closer to his chest to carefully fold Steve’s back-fin and began to swim as fast as he could to the castle entrance. If Tony could at least make it there, he could get some help.
"If you don't take my word you can ask Mr. Squid-man," Steve said pointedly. "Also... um... If you don't mind me asking... Where did you get that ring?"
“Stay if you wish,” King Howard told Steve. “But only speak when spoken to,” he warned. Steve nodded. He watched King Howard swim to his throne and take a seat next to his wife, the Queen.
Nurses swam around the room doing their jobs until the big double doors of the Infirmary slammed open. All turned to see the Prince and his friends holding an unconscious merman up. The nurses all bowed to Prince Tony.
Steve put Bucky’s tags around his neck and peaked his head out of the infirmary door. Empty. Why? Where is everyone? He ventured out of the infirmary and down the hall. Curiosity killed the... cat? Fish? Catfish?
Steve was so taken aback by this statement that he straightened his back in a swift and sharp movement. His back, still being sore, did not agree with this and gave Steve a sudden sharp stabbing pain to which Steve responded to with a yelp.
"NO!" Steve got in between the 2 and raised the shield to block Obadiah's blast. The gauntlet fired and the shield withstood it. Not a scratch on it. Steve charged at Obadiah and slammed the shield against Obadiah's head. The squid's tentacles loosened. Anthony was able to untangle himself. "Get out of here!" Steve yelled at Anthony.
Tony caught up with the others who made their way to the part of the palace where their rooms were. They were waiting for Tony.
“With all due respect sir, I’m going to need more information than: ‘the prince you saved is actually a masked superhero’ and ‘we need your help’.” Fury smiled.
Tony looked at Steve’s blue eyes. They were empty. The smile Steve gave him so many times since Tony’s met him wasn’t there. He had no emotion on his face. Yet a feeling of dread and hopelessness radiated from him.
“Soldier?” A new but all too familiar voice said from behind the Soldier. Steve hid the tags in his fist and didn’t dare to move. It was Obadiah.
“To tell you the truth, I’ve been having blackouts for quite some time. After them, my son wouldn’t talk to me, my wife would be exasperated, and there would be random new orders like tracking down that group of vigilantes. I think it may have been Obadiah but he has been gone from the castle for over a week, yet I’m still having them.” King Howard looked miserable. He pinched the bridge of his nose.
P.S.: For those of you who are wondering if there will be any action; YES there will be FOR SURE. In maybe 2 or 3 chapters? Idk.
Then he saw Obadiah. His heart pounded so hard when he saw Steve swim to the point where his back was against the wall. Then he saw the Winter Soldier and Obadiah swim away as fast as they could.
Steve thought. If he could get the Winter Soldier to say something, maybe Steve could recognize him. “What happened to you?”
“IronTail? I don’t know who that is. I thought the conflict was between Prince Tony and Obadiah.” The merman sighed.
The 3rd merman had a dark green, black and gold lined tail. He, too, had a helmet that was gold with long horns and made no attempt to hide Loki’s face either. He had an actual cape made of dark green seaweed and he held a golden scepter.
“The quiet type are you?” Obadiah chuckled. “You two should be best friends.” He gestured to the Winter Soldier. Steve gripped Bucky’s tags tighter. “Alright then..." Obadiah's eyes were drawn to the tags around his neck. "You know, that chain that you have around your neck, you got it from the Soldier, didn't you?" Steve nodded to hide the fact that they were actually his. "I don't understand why the Soldier keeps it. It belonged to a human he was ordered to kill years ago."
Tony thought to himself. He put on the ring for safekeeping. Tony snapped out of his thoughts and turned his attention to the merman.
“The castle? Deserted? My boy,” Howard chuckled, “Odin is just very dramatic when he sees a servant. He normally doesn’t have to see them in his palace. This part of the castle was ‘evacuated’ so that we would all be spared from Odin’s tantrums,” Howard grinned. “The servants should be back at about 7:30 this morning.”
The scales made a wave from the tip of his tail to his waist and seemed to flip over revealing another side. His tail was now a darker shade of blue. His fins were the same color as the base. There was a striped section around the thigh part of his tail alternating red and white. There was no reflection.
“Why would you want both of us back, Father? Why the sudden change of heart for Loki? Do you not remember why Loki left in the first place? Why I left?”
Peggy swam up to Pepper. “‘He looks strong’, huh? Then the Prince blushes? Are you implying something, Pepper?” She asks playfully.
Steve wandered down the deserted hall. Then down another. The library. The lab. A few more corridors. He found no one. Not guards, nurses, servants. No one. As Steve was passing the study that Fury brought him to earlier, he froze.
“Be careful,” Fury warned then he turned to Agent Hill and said, “What’s the location of the blip?” He and Agent Hill began to swim away and Steve turned to leave again.
“Though in Asgard, Loki and I were royal, I can see now that we would never truly be happy there. We are both in debt to the Stark family. I would much rather serve and protect the Stark pod than sit on my bottom in Asgard. Besides, I do not truly believe Odin would ever treat Loki the same.”
Steve was in the army. His dream had come true... Kind of. All the soldiers made fun of his size and lack of strength. In training, they'd trip him and rig the course to make it harder for Steve. Steve tolerated this for almost 2 years.
Tony studied the merman's body. Admiring the structure of his muscles. Someone cleared their voice. All turned to see Thor, who had a large (but not deep) cut across his stomach, and Loki, who had a smaller but deeper cut on his arm. Loki was bleeding.
“Where did you get those?” Steve breathed. The Winter Soldier breathed in sharply through the mask. His blue eyes widened in shock. He tried to pull away before Steve had a chance to read the name but the tags were tangled. So, instead, the Soldier ripped away -- tag still tangled in Steve’s. Steve took the second set of tags. The name is written clearly.
The last 3 words were so cold, everyone in the room could have sworn that the water's temperature dropped by 10 degrees. King Howard turned and left. The rage had not left his face. Without anyone else noticing, a merman with a black tail, black trench coat, dark skin, and an eyepatch slipped into the room and seated himself in the back.
Tony looked to the shield in his other hand except, there was no Shield. There was, instead, a ring in his fist that had the colors and pattern of the shield on it.
Steve shook his head skipping over the shield and started over. “... I heard a yell. So I sped out to help them. I saw you." Steve looked at Tony. "You were in the squid-man's tentacles and he was going to kill you."
“We can’t tell anyone,” Natasha whispered frantically trying to shut Clint up. Bruce just put a finger to his lips with a ‘stop-talking-right-now’ face.
“Is that a no?” Obadiah asked. Obadiah frowned and swam forward toward Steve. Steve’s back fin folded in as Steve backed up even further. His back was now pressed against the wall. Steve had nowhere to go. He was trapped. “Huh. You have guts to turn us down like this. I like you.” Obadiah winked before addressing the Winter Soldier, “Soldier,” he said as he turned around. The Winter Soldier turned to leave and both he and Obadiah swam away and out of sight, probably faster than Clint would be able to say, ‘well that was fishy.’
“So there seem to be quite a bit of merpeople who can make the change for one pod, don’t you think?”
“Believe me, Loki’s and my reactions were more extreme than yours. Aye, Loki was adopted. Before becoming a prince of Asgard, Loki was born in a Mer-frost Giant pod called Jotunheim. He was born to the king of the pod, Laufey. Now, you should take note, Asgard and Jotunheim had their differences.
The merman was entangled in a squid's tentacles. Except the tentacles were connected to another man's upper body. The squid man was holding the other red and gold gauntlet. They were far away but just far enough for Steve to hear them. Steve started to swim toward them clumsily.
Steve pushed back against the Winter Soldier and grabbed him by his uniform and turned him around and pushed the Soldier against the rock wall. But the Winter Soldier pushed back and again, Steve was up against the wall. A chain slipped out from under the Winter Soldier’s uniform. It looked like the army tag Steve wore. Both froze.
The infirmary was a large room. The lighting made the walls look like a beautiful mix of cyan blue and light teal shades. It was a perfect square room but fairly large. The ceiling was high. There were fairly sized arched windows at the top of the wall to the right. The floor had a giant gear carved into it that served as a pathway to the beds, that were positioned all around the gear pathway, were made of white giant clams that had a minor ruffle effect around the edges. They had mattresses made of soft material and were covered with dense but soft sheets.
“However, my father was ashamed of Loki after everything. He banished Loki from Asgard, but I thought this wasn’t fair. It was my fault Loki was in this mess. When Odin proclaimed Loki’s banishment, I stood against it openly. I knew Odin would never go back on his word, so I told him to banish me as well. Out of rage, Odin did so and Loki and I wondered from Asgard together. In our time out in the open ocean, Hydra tried to kill Loki on multiple occasions for revenge of their army Loki destroyed. Shortly after, we accidentally swam into Prince Tony and his battalion as they were traveling to Asgard to discuss the war’s events.
“Loki, the team, and I discussed this,” Thor said in a hushed voice. “He will break out and leave an illusion of Deceit in the cell and return as Loki before Deceit supposedly ‘breaks out’.”
“Well I’m not,” Steve said frustrated. He couldn’t leave the masked mermaid to die. He swam fast toward the Winter Soldier and the mermaid.
“Help me get his red, white, and blue tail to the infirmary!" Tony said. He and Natasha led as the 4 of them raced the mysterious unmasked merman to the infirmary.
Steve thought in grief. He floated down unable to tread water any more. It was as if everything but his mind shut down as he thought the only thing he could:
After the both of them finished inventing the gadget, Tony gave it to Peter for him to check and probe with his web shooters, but the teenage boy was doing his own agenda after their project. He was checking on his smartphone. Typical teenagers nowadays, he thought. Tony hemmed loudly, making Peter to look up at him with worry. Why was he worried?
Tony nodded with a reluctant grin on his face before Rhodey walked away. He continued to stare at the phone. He decided to flip open the gadget and turned it on. To his surprise, there was a wallpaper of him and Steve hugging each other. He then noticed an unread message in the inbox and clicked on it using the keypad.
“God, Tony, you found me,” Steve murmured in between kisses, and he kissed, and he kissed, as if stopping would let them be taken away from each other again. “You found me.”
street, yeah, and you see that building right there?” She pointed upwards, where he looked at the skyscraper with a large point. “That’s the Chrysler Building. Follow that and you’ll be at the train station.”
“You wanted to get here as soon as possible, Steve.” The brown-haired man rolled his eyes. “I was ready for breakfast in bed, and I could see you naked.”
Tony’s lips quirked into a smirk. “I looked great in the coat, but I guess I agree. You, however,” he gestured to his clothing, “—I am actually afraid of. I preferred the tight shirt and the jogging pants. Those looked amazing on you, despite being plain as hell.”
“And. Well.” He looked up to the sky, mouth twitching between happy and sad tears. “I miss. I miss a lot. I. I just want to turn back time, and, turn back and go to the better times.”
Steve hissed, and oh my god, he’s gotten the Pepper hiss down and they’ve known each other for two and half hours right now?
“Look, Captain Rogers,” Agent Hill sighed, putting a hand on her head to rub her temples in what he perceived as annoyance. “I’ve told you, time and time again. You
“Like you,” he confirmed, “—and only you. But what keeps me up at night are my inventions… genius, you know.”
“Hey, you’re thinking again, you’re awfully non-verbal.” Steve huffed. “Come on now, Tony. Talk to me. You’re making me nervous here.”
Steve shook his head, still surprised but a bit better. “N-No. More in awe. I haven’t exactly… taken appreciation of Grand Central Station.”
Tony wasn’t kissing him gently, no-- this was a whole new level that Steve didn’t know how to maneuver. There was tongue and he felt weak against the smaller man’s hold. He was weak in the knees, powerless against the other man’s passionate kisses.
Tony hummed in assent. “That’s what lightning does. It gets a bit heated and it goes off to many, many directions, but it would always find something to stabilize with. Mushrooms love it too.”
“Tony.” He closed in, and wrapped him in the hug, but Tony kept protesting against the hold. “Tony—I’m sorry for what I did, but I don’t know what you mean—“
Steve raised his eyebrows, looked at where his wallet was, and looked at him again. Then as if to mock him, he gestured to the bottle on his hand and the bag of chocolates laying innocently on the crook of his arm.
“Hey.” The driver-- an old man with shades, what a legend-- called, halting Tony from exiting the cab. “He needs a hug.”
oozing out of his posture and look. Steve suddenly felt horribly insignificant, standing in front of the man.
Fury turned to him again, and Steve sat ramrod straight. “Captain. I suggest that you get to know your team before the first deployment mission later, since we are tracing the lead of one our agents in Europe. If we do this right, we’ll be able to call you out later for the mission.”
Tony snorted out a laugh, and then he was laughing, breaking the peace between them. Steve had a grin on his face.
Steve risked a look to Natasha again for comfort (as comforting as a blank stare or a curved smirk could be) but she was looking at the side, lips curling into a
That was correct, it seemed. This guy knew what he was always talking about, his chatter full of knowledge of different things and opinions on other tasks. He talked really fast. He was amazing.
But honestly, wasn’t Pepper—“Miss Potts, if you aren’t ready to do so, just stop deluding yourself that you’d even understand what’s happening”—wasn’t Pepper
When Steve went quiet, Tony had another second of panic, thinking that he was revealing too much; and he
“Come on Steve!” He beckoned towards him, and Steve shook his head as he fell in step with the other man.
Tony tried a smile. If cab drivers could notice, then it was going to be serious. “Yeah, I figured.”
Tony snorted. “I’ve been calling you nicknames ever since we met, honey. I think ‘baby’ is excusable.”
Tony tilted his head up, and Steve was struck again, on the realization—that somehow, he must be here for the future, for a reason. Maybe this particular reason.
“The jacket looks good on you,” he said after a minute or so. “I’m glad that you wore it. Your shirt was totally inappropriate the whole time.”
Pepper, who was the tipping point, but there was also Rhodey hounding after him and asking his decision on several things, as if him skipping out of conferences was anything he hasn’t done in the past. Maybe it was how the man raised his hands in exasperation, shouting “Tony! I was all up for this
“It’s twenty bucks.” The driver called. He handed him a fifty just for the hell of it, and bolted out of the car because he can. He vaguely heard that
“You just got to know me, Tony.” Steve answered honestly, staring up at him. He shifted him downwards, and then he was kissing him again. “You just got to know me.”
“But it wasn’t,” Steve pressed, stroking his sides as they swayed together. “It led us to here. I… despite everything that has happened to me, I wouldn’t give up this day for the world.”
Steve pursed his lips. “It’s for action too.” He still said with the accent, and Tony filed it as an ‘embarrassed’ quirk the other man had. “Stop it. It wasn’t funny.”
Steve brought his hands together and blushed. “I just. Wanted to hold you. Till.” He must’ve looked ridiculous, standing in front of Tony in a robe and boxers. “Till the sun rises. I want to hold you in my arms till we go our separate ways.”
Though the other man could really use some relaxing. He looks like he was in parade-rest all the time, and he was
Tony unwrapped the golden foil ball and showed him. “Chocolate, with hazelnut.” He bounced the chocolate ball before popping it into his mouth. “Ishh delisshoosh.”
“No, you don’t understand, god, this is probably a curse in itself, you know?” He was laughing again, and it was painful to see. It made Steve’s heart break. “Tony Stark, finds the love of his life but we can’t be together. Fuck, it just—why does my life always turn into shit? Why?”
Tony grinned, and dropped from his actions, opting to stand next to him. “Well glad to know that blush goes down. That’s adorable.”
“Please don’t remind me,” Steve groaned, getting redder and redder by the minute as his mind replayed
He knew that. “I know that,” he nodded, seeing the logic. “But really? I think I look like the most American person to be American, if that makes sense. I’m not special. I’m,” he paused, “—just a kid from Brooklyn. That’s just what I need to be. It’s not like, the first thought of people when they see me is
For some reason, that statement stuck to his mind. He didn’t know why, but he felt—he felt a connection to it. “That’s. That’s amazing.”
But the bigger thing was the fact that Steve kept saying that there was a time for them to meet, somehow, that was out of this magical night.
He couldn’t stop the sob that crawled into his throat. His dream was so vivid; he had remembered every single thing. Tony’s ridiculousness, his jokes, even his innuendos, and then to the tender parts of their evening, where he discovered the man who brought out his heart for everyone, the man who was so generous the world was indebted to him.
They called the three o’clock the devil’s hour, and it feels like it was the absolute moment for Tony Stark to snag his companion into a hotel (and god, it still ached him that he couldn’t take him to Stark Tower). He was going to do this greatly, and he was going to put his talent full-blast, devilish moves and wicked smiles all the way.
He’s been denying the fact that seven would even come, from the back of his mind. Seven am was when SHIELD checked up on him, and it’s not like he left a note or anything to indicate his absence.
Which probably gave him this way of thinking, because it’s pretty obvious that this time, there wasn’t much of a war, or anything. Today’s war was mostly media, apparently, because Tony was afraid—well, not exactly
“—shut up, don’t interrupt my thinking.” Tony waved his hand again in a flurry. “My face has been in the media for more than three hundred lifetimes. I’ve seen myself photographed until I go blind due to the flashes. You haven’t
Steve was new to the world, and he was still frightful of cars (because they were plenty faster too, and there are so many
Steve couldn’t stop the snort from escaping him now, which startled Maria marginally. “And I told you to stop calling me Captain.”
Tony snorted. “Your first thought of ‘furnished’ was a sofa, Steve? Not that you have a room? Come on.”
“Steve,” he said the name like a plea. “Hang in there. Bruce is on his way to stitch you up. Stay strong for me. Please?” Tears lingered in his eyes. “I can’t lose you after a year of our marriage.”
“No worries, Captain,” he whispered in an ominous tone in the left ear. “Your massive contribution to the world is just getting started. Even your loving husband knows that you’re worthy with HYDRA.”
All of them laughed including Tony, capturing the lively domesticity surrounding their atmosphere. His husband must’ve been proud of his friend for breaking free from HYDRA’s mind tricks. And Tony was proud of his husband.
Just as he was conducting his cyber hunt, Pepper rushed into the conference room with a worried face as if she was been chased by ghosts. The whole room went silent and she took a glance at him. “Tony, have you seen the news?”
Was Tony okay? What would his husband react if his mission went sideways? Did Bucky manage to snap out of HYDRA’s hypnosis?
“Remember,” Whitehall reminded him, although his brain was trying to process the words. “Discovery requires experimentation.”
He has a point, Tony thought. Both of them have so much to catch up on these past few days. Probably the best thing to do after Steve has been discharged is to immediately go on the planned honeymoon and ignore all calls related to work. They deserved this long vacation.
“Bucky, you’re with me,” Tony said while Nat nodded in agreement. Bucky became shocked but simmered down when Nat glared at him. “I might need your help in finding Steve’s position in that bank as you know that place all too well. They are going to retrieve any remaining HYDRA intelligence to be disposed of. Bruce, we need you to stay in here. If we found an injured Steve, you’re our best guy to treat him – unless the Big Guy is needed.”
"The Black Order are also known as the Children of Thanos, consisting of Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight and Supergiant. I believe they are here on Earth to find something known as the Infinity Stone,"
Steve. Oh gosh, how were they still delaying the inevitable when his husband might not have a lot of time? Thank the heavens that Nat reminded him and everyone else.
“Yeah, Pepper and I will go out for a grand dinner in about ten minutes, not that I’m saying the dinner just now was awful. We both planned this yesterday and I don’t want to miss it. Why did you ask?”
“She won’t,” Bucky smiled, only to be ignored by Tony. A minute had passed and he felt uncomfortable; not because of the spooky graveyard, but the judging glare coming from Mr Spook-Up-To-People. “You’re scanning the building, aren’t you?” When he didn’t respond to the question, Bucky sighed. “You won’t find anything here because the base is a hundred feet beneath the surface.”
After a minute, he reached the end of the passage and landed safely in a gloomy room. If it wasn’t for the suit, his ass and legs might suffer from the drop. From what he could deduct after a quick glance, this was a storage room – he wasn’t sure what were they keeping; probably guns and ammunition. Tony heard the shaft rattled and Bucky touched down to the cement floor.
Then, he remembered about Steve. Where did he went at the moment? Why he wasn't at home? His mind started to run wild with daunt. He needed to calm himself down.
Upon hearing those five words, it hit him and he scanned Steve’s body. Please, let it be in him, he thought.
They were standing in front of the grave, under the gloomy, rainy sky with their umbrellas and black suits, paying respect to their fallen soldier, their teammate and their friend.
Then, the Sokovia Accords took place. He couldn’t sign away his freedom of helping people to the government despite there were some good clauses pointed out by Tony. To add insult to injury, he really couldn’t have faith in any government agencies; not after HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD a few years back. There were many possibilities playing in his head, regarding a traitor disguising themselves to take down an organization. The issue itself shocked him. Steve tried to see from Tony’s point of view, on how they would make this successful, but his shoulders couldn’t bear the additional weight.
"And by the way, there will be no appropriate funeral for him. His body deserved to be left there, nibbled into pieces by dirty street rats,"
Tony would’ve solved their problems by brainstorming multiple ideas but the board members had been ignoring him for a while since he was once caught having sex with his husband in his own office two months ago. Pepper gave him a warning glare while the other board members decided to not let him speak and voice out any opinions.
The results showed no traces of the anaesthetic drug. Zero. Nada. Of course HYDRA did the operation on him without the fucking drug. They knew he was a mighty super-soldier and Captain ‘Murica for god’s sake, but they didn’t know about the man behind the flashy cosplay named Steve Rogers, who was also a normal human being and had a heart of red and gold.
Upon hearing the question, he backed off from the hug and slapped his husband on the chest, causing Steve to groan slightly.
After placing the kidney into the jar and sealing it tight, he put it down on the surgical trolley gracefully, ensuring the jar wouldn’t stumble and fall. Then, he ordered the doctors and surgeons to prepare for the next operation without fail. In his mind, he planned to harvest the pancreas next as the said organ won’t cause much harm to the body.
For Tony, his friendship with the team had grown significantly for the past two years. All six of them were so different yet had the same values; Thor frequently beats Clint in a video game even though he is an Asgardian, Bruce falling asleep while watching a late-night movie, Nat grocery shopping all by herself and sometimes bought her stuff only, and he and Steve… so many memories, ranging from their bickering to their intense kissing and to their honeymooning. And so far, they were all living the best of their lives in the tower because they had each other.
The genius continued to monitor the satellites’ search radar on his minimalistic, holographic screen. He ran through every potential coordinate that could possibly detain Steve: Nevada, North Dakota, Illinois and others. Fuck, this search was a lot harder than taking an aerial picture on Area 51 with his tech.
"Because the Avengers are under the government's laws. If you ever try to violate them, you will be punished," Ross said. "I got my eyes on you, Stark. Try and go to London and I'll make sure that it will be your last trip,"
“Says the guy who made me waiting for his arrival in forever.” A light giggle comes out from the both of them.
Once the two of them approached the large commercial garbage bin and opened its lid, revealing the hidden vent, Tony straight away dug his left foot in it. He sensed the same judging glare from the soldier. If only he could stab this man’s eyes…
She’s right. There was no point in pressurizing Barnes to be forced to talk. Despite the man was once his husband’s best friend, he should prepare himself for the worst if Barnes went wacko and murder them all. So, he let go of Barnes and stepped backwards, alongside Bruce and Clint.
The news of Peggy’s death and the defamation of Bucky happened simultaneously; two people who played a significant role in Steve’s past life. Her funeral was graceful but he didn’t get to say goodbye to his first love. And Bucky, he could tell that his old friend wouldn’t detonate a bomb willingly. Zemo framed him at a very high cost: hunted down by every federation around the world. And when he could finally prove Bucky’s innocence, his alliance with Tony went sideways, and well, it’s complicated.
"Oh, let me get to the point," Steve started to clarify. "By afternoon, I have to leave Wakanda since the international cops have detected my location. And I'm pretty sure there might be no chance for me to get into hiding anymore.
resourceful. If you give him any scenario, he will use anything as an advantage. I’ve yet to find something to get him with. Then this happens. The prince all of a sudden needs saving and the merman happens to be around when Obadiah has the prince cornered.” Tony became really annoyed at this and knocks on the door before opening it.
Tony thought to himself. Natasha, Bruce, and Clint all went into different rooms in the hall. Thor and Loki led Steve to a wall and Steve was able to support himself and did the same. "Hey JARVIS!"
Okay so I know I said that I may be slowing down due to midterms, but I'm on a roll today! Thank you, people who are giving kudos and commenting and asking questions about some characters --  which has given me a bit of inspiration. You guys are what makes me so excited to update.
“Hello,” Steve gave him a tired smile. They shook hands. He noticed that the lieutenant had a bandage around his lower tail. “What happened to you?”
But before Steve got a chance to read them, he heard a scream of another man. 'Oh no! I have to help him!' were Steve's immediate thoughts. He felt an incredible determination to help this man. He grabbed the shield and pulled. It glowed blue before it was separated from its place in the rock. When the rock and shield lost contact, the shield continued to glow and Steve began to glow as well. He looked down to see his tail change color.
The Winter Soldier let out a cry of pain and dropped the knife. It missed the ledge they were fighting over and floated down into the depths of the ocean. Steve looked the Winter Soldier in the eye and saw frustration. The Soldier charged at him again pushing Steve into the rock wall, again and again, punching Steve in the stomach. The last push against the rock wall put the pressure on Steve’s back too much and the wound opened up again earning a short but sharp cry of pain from Steve.
(Omg it's 2019 already. But just cuz I'm an idiot, like every beginning of the year, I'll be writing the previous year in the date on all my schoolwork papers. Lol XD)
“Tony told me he had a suit. I saw him wearing it… well… pieces of it. He never said he had a secret identity.”
"Hello, Friend Tony. Obadiah Stane is in custody," Thor said as a nurse took Loki’s arm and wrapped it with a bandage. She then went back to her original duties.
Tony was greeted at the gates by a worried Natasha and Bruce and a smug looking Clint. Clint's and Bruce's jaw dropped, and Natasha's eyes widened as they caught sight of the shield Tony was holding.
“What happened?” Steve asked in a hoarse voice. He looked tired and was starting to turn pale. The cloud of blood was reforming behind Steve.
"How...?" Steve dove into the water to retrieve the tags. As Steve grabbed his tags the water grew bright. Steve shut his eyes. He couldn't hold his breath anymore. Eyes still shut, he put on his tags and swam to the surface of the water. To swim felt completely different. When he resurfaced he gasped for breath and looked at his feet. Steve gave a yelp of surprise. He expected to see his 2 scrawny feet. But instead, he saw a decently sized blue tail.
When he heard Steve’s sharp cry of pain, Hawkeye held him back. He saw the water around Steve’s back turn red.
“Welcome all to the Stark Pod Court of Justice. We have gathered here today to discuss the events of the prison break out, here in Stark pod, 2 days ago and King Odin’s request…” Steve stopped paying attention and reverted his mind to Tony. Was he the one in that bed with the wires and machines? What did Steve do to him? When will he wake up? However long Steve was spaced out, he entirely missed the change of tone in the court from professional to pure rage.
A scrawny, young man ventured to the cove in tears. Nothing but laughter had followed him. It echoed in the blue, moonlit cave.
"You have moved passed that Loki. We have all forgiven you," Queen Maria said kindly. "I must go now. Your King, Howard needs to be persuaded."
As they all trailed out of the broken window and into the murky waters, merpeople made small sounds of horror as they swam through the battlefield that was currently littered with the floating lifeless bodies of guardsmen. Tony looked away. Steve put a hand on his shoulder. Tony looked up at Steve and gave him a small smile. His eyes didn’t reflect the smile. They looked full of loss and grief. Tony must have known some of these guards. Steve gave Tony’s shoulder a squeeze for comfort. The group stopped. Steve looked ahead.
"This merman saved my life father!" Howard's expression had not changed. Rage radiated from the King's face. "Using this," Tony raised his hand with the ring shield. The King swam back in shock as the Queen moved forward by the King's side. No one but the King and Tony’s friends seemed to know what it was.
"You're going to pay for that merman," Obadiah said as he fired at Steve using the gauntlet. Steve dodged out of the way. The blast missing him by a centimeter. 'This is harder underwater,' Steve thought. Steve weaved through the forest of black tentacles and slammed the shield against Obadiah's back. Obadiah gave an angered roar as he turned around and fired at Steve who raised his shield again to defend himself.
“My pleasure,” Steve smiled. “Wait,” Steve lowered his voice. “So Loki is in the prison block as Deceit? Is there a way to get him out?”
Also, "'The quiet type are you?' Obadiah chuckled. 'You two should be best friends.' He gestured to the Winter Soldier." Oh, I love the irony there.
So basically, for those of you who have been wondering about the magic in the story so far, this chapter is exactly what it was named; clarity. NOT EVERYTHING is explained in THIS chapter but I'm hoping that I haven't lost people because of unexplained details so PLEASE be patient and  BARE WITH ME! Thanks.
Steve made his way back through the door that closed and locked itself and then the bookshelf opened once more to let Steve out and closed behind Steve when he swam out. He left the study that hid the secret door. All this new information was so much. Steve decided to go back to his room to sleep a little more.
“Actually, only 2 of the 6--,” Fury paused for a moment and shook his head. “Now 7 merpeople that we know,” Fury corrected, “-- can make the change were actually born in the Stark pod. The rest are foreign.”
“Your Highness, I would be comforted if You would be escorted to your destination with protectors,” Bruce proposed.
“I don’t think anyone really knows except maybe Queen Maria and Prince Tony,” said a voice that definitely wasn’t a nurse. Tony knew that voice well. It was Carol Danvers, the most loyal and overprotective Captain of the royal guards. Carol’s dark blue tail and bright red fins were now receiving a treatment of some sort. She brushed her blonde hair out of the way of her sharp blue eyes as she said, “But I don’t trust this new merman.” At this, Tony made a face of annoyance but quickly regained his composure. He glanced at Steve and the others who also could hear. Steve’s face showed a flash of guilt. “Something's not right about him.”
The Throne room was set up not like Steve expected. It looked more like a courtroom. Odin was there along with other elites from both the Stark and Asgard pods. Their seats made a semicircle around an empty cage that was front and center. In the middle of the semicircle, there were 2 larger thrones. Queen Maria sat in one of them. Steve spotted Pepper sitting in the Royal Physician's seat, a seat away from the empty larger throne. Horns trumpeted an entrance tune as King Howard, Captain Danvers, the guards, and Steve entered the room.
"A 42 on the scale?!" Clint whisper-yelled. The others made surprised noises. "You know how rare that rating is for merpeople?! It must really be bad, huh?"
“No, Clint. I don’t want to prank Thor and Loki while they’re training,” Bruce mumbled and turned over onto his back, his head facing the window of his room, away from Steve.
"Huh, You wouldn't happen to have this nightmare before would you?" Director Fury asked as he pulled a lever behind some books. The bookshelf opened. They both went in. Shield still glowing white. The bookshelf closed behind them. In the small metal elevator they were in, there was a railing and a second door.
"Steve?!" Tony reached out to Steve. Steve gasped when Tony’s hand made contact with his shoulder and his ocean blue eyes returned. Steve was breathing heavy. "Steve are you okay?" Steve’s eyes flickered between Tony and the shield/ring before settling on Tony.
“I was hoping IronTail could fill you in on that. Yes. The king does know. But he proclaimed them all as wanted vigilantes.”
"Your father doesn't seem to be fond of foreign merpeople... He um..." Tony sat Steve down on the bed.
The water's reflection danced on the dark grey rocks of the cave. Steve looked out to the opening of the cave. Below the rising full moon, it was all ocean. Across the Atlantic. That's where the enemy lines were. Steve had tried so hard to get across to the Army base across the ocean, but he was just not good enough. It was pure luck that Steve was accepted into the army in the first place. Steve looked at his tag.
HHHH I'm gonna die cuz of midterms. I may slow down a bit after this chapter cuz midterms are all of next week. But afterward... WINTER BREAK! IM SO READY FOR IT.
“Thank you for the help I can take him,” she said, voice wavering. She looked overwhelmed and was, at the moment, capable of doing the exact opposite of what she said.
“I can’t exactly explain. But I do need to know why the castle is deserted.” Steve said as he picked the object off the bookshelf. It was a dart. It contained red liquid in it.
“Steve. If we don’t hurry, you’re going to bleed out,” Tony said worriedly looking down at Steve, as they swam through a steep upward tunnel. Steve looked at him dazed. He looked as if he was about to pass out. Tony had to do something.
"Why is your rescuer so nervous Prince Tony?" A blond merman with longer hair and a silver-scaled tail asked. He and the merman beside him, who had raven black hair and a dark green tail, where covered in small scratches and bruises.
At first, it looked like there was nothing there. Just barren rocks and cliffs. Tony continued to swim to what seemed like right into a huge mountain. Then he passed through the entrance of the Barrier. A whole castle was revealed. Tony and the merman were showered in the light it produced. A reef full of colorful coral plants surrounded the base. The castle walls were smoothe in contrast to the great mound it stood on. It was as if the castle was carved out of the mountain that Tony saw outside of the Barrier. Tony looked back. He was surprised to see that the merman was not bleeding. Why?
“I hope that one day I will understand your hate towards me, Captain Danvers,” Steve said sternly yet confidently, showing the side of him that he has yet to show any sea creature —  not to mention everyone on the surface and himself. Carol smirked to cover up her surprise from the tone of voice she was spoken to.
“Of course, your highness.” Steve and King Howard traveled down the halls as Steve explained about the Winter Soldier attacking and Obadiah’s escape. When Steve finished, King Howard shook his head in disbelief.
“Yes, sir. Back in the hall where we met, I enlarged the shield but why didn’t it glow blue? Why didn’t my tail change like last time?”
“Ya gotov otvechat.” The Soldiers reply was muffled due to the mask that covered his mouth, but rough. Steve didn’t recognize the voice. The language was different.
“Approximately 35 miles from the prison block.” Agent Hill answered. “What if they try to break in-?” Steve heard no more of the conversation. ‘Break in?’ Steve thought to himself. He decided not to worry. Director Fury looked like someone who could handle it.
“Now, hold the shield out in front of you and say 'Follow Director Fury'." Steve followed ‘Director Fury’s’ instructions.
“What?! Stop the tough-guy act. That’s really bad for a merperson,” the lieutenant said more playfully than anything. “I never had a rating higher than 9. I think you set a new record in the Stark pod medical wing: Lost the most amount of blood and survived,” he and Steve chuckled humorlessly. “The name’s Dum Dum Dugan, by the way.”
"Thanks, Pep." Tony hugged her. "Honestly, I don’t know what we’d do without you.” Tony gave her a smile and turned to follow the other 6.
He finally took notice of his broad upper, mainly human, self. His arms were muscular. He curiously poked at his biceps to make sure he wasn't dreaming. 'No, they're real…’ Steve confirmed to himself, bewildered.
BOOM. Can I just pride myself on that ending? I really liked it. (Sorry XD. That was a little narcissistic and arrogant.)
"Now, Steve," Peggy said. "You know that with the fin on your back folded in, you won't be able to swim properly."
Tony thought again. Tony was worrying like the world was ending and he only met Steve a week ago. Why did he feel this way? Tony mentally shook his head. He needed to focus. Loki’s spear grew brighter.
Captain of The Royal Guards. She was always shown the utmost respect from everyone. Even the Royal Family. Prince Tony was... getting there. Carol did not reply to Steve. She instead turned her back, swam towards the King’s throne, and took her seat right in between Pepper and King Howard. She smirked at Steve as she sat down gracefully as if to taunt him.
Tony stopped at the door. The nurses were speaking with each other in an urgent voice. Tony stopped his friends and motioned to them to be quiet.
“We have to get him. As far as I have seen, Hydra moves fast. I’d much prefer if you came with me just in case if you don’t mind, your highness,” Steve said.
"Of course Prin- I-I mean Tony," Peggy said giving a small bow out of muscle memory. "Come on girls!" Peggy led the nurses to a bed and Tony's friends helped Steve to the clamshell bed. Tony grabbed Pepper out of the crowd. Steve was swarmed by nurses and Peggy had him turn on his stomach.
“Steve? Look at me. Please...” Tony was now begging. Steve turned his head and looked Tony in the eyes. He said nothing. His eyes showed devastation and grief. Tony knew he wouldn’t say anything. He tried that already. So instead, Tony pulled him in for a hug.
Tony remembered that he found out a lot of the new proclamations through the nurses' gossip and rants. He opened the door a little bit and peeked through.
"What is all this ruckus!" King Howard questioned, his voice raised. The nurses all immediately swam to the edges of the room revealing the merman, Prince Tony, and his friends. "A foreign merman? In my castle?!" King Howard swam forward Prince Tony swam in between King Howard and the unconscious merman stopping the King in his tracks.
“Speaking of pasts, I find it curious that after sharing your full past with us you asked us nothing of our pasts in return,” Thor thought out loud.
“Oh goodness,” King Howard said glancing at the clock. 7:45. “I have to be in the throne room. Merpeople are expecting me.”
Wires, that were connected to weird looking machines surrounding the bed, were connected to something - or someone - in that clam bed. There was a timer on one of the bigger machines. 25:23:30 and counting down.
"I... I don't know. All I remember is my father abandoned my mother before I was born and then she died a few years ago... I... I've been alone ever since..." Steve trailed off. It was the truth. Kind of.
“Yeah sure. You had him on the ropes,” Steve said sarcastically as the Winter Soldier drew a knife silently from his black uniform.
When Tony saw Steve float down to the ground, he took the chance to swim to Steve faster than Hawkeye could stop him. The Black Widow came back with reinforcements.
"I can't..." Steve said to himself as more tears made their way down his cheeks. He dipped his feet in the water, buried his face in his hands and cried for who knows how long.
“Don’t see the problem with it,” King Howard shrugged. “Are you sure you don’t have a pod? You must have been trained in some way.”
“I… I’ll have to think about it… I’m… not on the best terms with the king. He doesn’t trust me. IronTail told me that the king was angry and took it out on me but-“ Director Fury interrupted Steve’s pointless babbling.
“The glow in his chested stopped working,” Thor explained. “They say it is because of the rarity of the exposure of merman blood, Friend Tony did not put a shield for it. So when his chest was exposed to your blood...” Thor trailed off. “In truth, I was afraid for both of you...” he said uncharacteristically quiet. “I have not seen injuries quite like those, even in battle.” Thor’s tone then changed. “But if you woke, Friend Tony will as well!” Thor put on a smile. A moment of silence rolled over the two.
Steve’s blond locks shone as the sun rose slowly, and then he could finally make out the man’s azure eyes, glossy, with tears. Tony opened his mouth to say something, something idiotic like
Tony’s eyes began to move, and he blinked blearily awake. His hand tentatively reached out to caress Steve’s face, and the slow delight that built up on his face made Steve lose his breath. “Oh, wow, I could get used to a view like this, damn.”
Steve quirked a smile. As he looked at the paper—and whatever the hell was Tony computing now, he didn’t know (but
“Right!” Tony clapped his hands. “So yeah. Lightning strikes and it feels like they energize the mushrooms and they go into panic mode. So they want to live, and they double their reaction processes, and boom, they multiply! Or that’s what they say, anyway. Maybe plants like the energy?”
Mr. Blondie, don’t give me that, there are many things I forget but remembering who steered the conversation away isn’t one of them. I’ve got half a mind to yell at you more, but I’m starving. We’re going to eat.”
“We can be okay.” Steve smiled, and his lips wobbled. “I just need you close to me. And we could be okay.”
A beat passed, before he huffed as they exited the building. “That. That was so awkward. Gosh, that was so awkward, why didn’t you
“Yeah.” Steve nodded, embracing him. He didn’t think that was a bad thing. “And I’m never going to leave.”
“Couldn’t you have done like—small talk, Tony,” he almost-yelled. “—I’m, I’m trying here, I don’t know what you’re doing to me, and this day, this day—I kissed you, Tony, and I—
“I’m a normal man, Steve,” Tony murmured. “And… I have a feeling that you’re more than you let on. I don’t understand why, but maybe there’s a reason why, and… I trust you.”
distinct and really, some people need to get their lives in check because someone almost snapped a picture of him. He was used to it, honestly, but he had a life too.
“Steve, I, I’ve done so much wrong. Pepper—Pepper is angry with me, because I’ve been wasting away in my tower, and Rhodey’s been angry with me because I’ve been a literal child for the past months. I yelled at Dum-E, I yelled at U,
Steve nodded. “Is this the whole group?” He asked, looking around. He was concerned on how they were going to ‘save the world’ just by having four members. The Howling Commandos were a whole regiment, and most of the time, their forces were overwhelmed twenty to one.
Bruce’s smile was nice to see. “Yes, uh, and there’s also Mean and Green, which I’m more useful of.”
Wait that was a lie, he spent debating to go out of the helicarrier for an hour, tried evading people for another, and ran for the rest. There was also that moment where he practically bulldozed a person down (that still made him embarrassed, he could’ve
again, and what was going to happen? This--- fantasy, escape, would end too early. He knows Pepper would call him any time soon, especially since he just turned off his phone.
“Hey,” he started awkwardly, before clearing his throat. “I’m not exactly…well-versed with New York yet, and I forgot my map and I need to know where I am. Can you tell me?” He shifted his feet, unsure what to do.
Here’s a man who seized Steve’s heart from the past and opened his eyes for the future. Tony was grounding him to the future, and he was so,
Eyebrows scrunched together, as he tried to piece together the rapidly blurring images of his dream. That wasn’t—that wasn’t right. Why is he hunching over? Why’s he going farther?
in the middle of his sad state. Maybe it was the sad whirring of Dum-E, which sounded too pleading. It made him guilty, and he didn’t like the feeling, or the taste of disappointment linger on his tongue, especially when it came from his own creation. JARVIS was bad enough; Dum-E was worse.
Brown eyes blinked in dryness, and he must have been up for more than two days now, which wasn’t a surprise. He’s been in his workshop for so long and he hasn’t eaten since—that night when Pepper and he fought. She was agitated, annoyed at how he was being so flippant of (“Tony! You’ve got to stop doing this to yourself! It hurts to see you like this!”) whatever he was doing at the moment.
The rest of the team were not far behind as he turned his head around, except for Bucky. Where is he?
Steve’s mouth was no longer spitting out words but painful screams. He was electrocuted again and this time, more joules were channelled into his body. If this trend continues, he might not survive before what Whitehall had in plans for him. He hoped Tony was already on his way to save him.
And then, there was a bottle of beer in the highest kitchen cupboard. It was perfect. No one will come to see this, not even Steve, he thought. He slid a rolling ladder along the side of the wall and moved towards the cupboard. He climbed the ladder, grabbed the bottle and descended down.
“Oh, they possess dark magic and hunt stray people after dawn, unlike the ones we watch during our movie night.”
The cycle didn't stop. Tony kept repeating the process without worrying about his health. He ignored all those ted talks from Steve about the disadvantages of drinking alcohol. He didn't care. He wanted to drown in his own fantasy and leave the real world, filled with despair, for a while.
“Well, I’m sure we all adore this fluffy relationship, but what about my fluffy relationship? Steve is still out there, scared and lonely. So, I suggest Barnes tell us his location.”
They part their lips to catch a breath and stare into each other’s eyes to find a real meaning. Both of them have been waiting for this moment since who knows when. Steve’s eyes are sparkling with tears, trying to process everything within a single gulp. Tony really did love him, even when they fought. He won’t be alone anymore – he finally has Tony as his eternal lover.
Whitehall grinned happily behind the mask, proud of himself as he reminisced the day he successfully cut open the ageless Inhuman he captured a few decades back. He was one step closer to achieve his goal, and this experimentation was an astonishing breakthrough – opening endless possibilities for discovery.
Tony should be here with him, holding each other’s hands and walked beyond the tunnel. He always wanted to show off his little genius to his mother; they would get along perfectly, he thought.
"We are here, live in London to report that the Captain America, Steve Rogers was killed by the leader of the Black Order who came here yesterday. The leader's name was Thanos,"
"Hey, Steve," Tony replied. "Mind telling why are you calling me at this hour because I need some sleep," He was still confused with what Steve wanted from him, trying his best to forgive him.
Tony was scared. The chances to locate Steve became slimmer and slimmer with every hour. And every hour wasted could lessen Steve’s chances to live. He felt like an absolute idiot and he was not going to let that slide away. He was not going to let HYDRA give another painful event for his husband to remember.
Upon arriving at the advanced lab, he offered Bucky a seat while he and Bruce were on their way to create a temporary diluent – specifically to block hypnotic suggestions by HYDRA. Luckily, Tony knew every trigger word of the Winter Soldier’s programming from his previous data search, so he asked him to formulate a suitable concoction for it as Bruce was more of an expert in the biochemical field than himself. The scientist nodded and started with his experiment.
