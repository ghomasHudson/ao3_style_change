‘’Death’s …scythe.’’ God chuckled with a hoarse voice.
____________
Someone knocked on the door.
‘’That’s Cas’s.’’
Poor Castiel is at peace now. He’s sleeping perfectly fine, like
That just maybe, the cuffs had drawn him forewards.
And then Cas’s lips were against his again.
________________
''That I will need something to bite down on.'' Cas said with a tired smile, the pain was really getting to him now and he just wanted to rest.
‘’Of course you would befriend yourself.’’
Castiel smiled.
But he liked to hear Dean talk so he said;
For the first time in a while,
He’d wanted to bring a gun too, but his aim was still terrible, and as soon as he’d finished this he was going to ask Dean to teach him how to shoot.
Gabriel threw himself on Chuck, and managed to pin him against the wall.
‘’I knew you’d be smart.’’
If home would have a taste, would it be this soapy towel?
Castiel bid his lip to prefent himself from screaming.
The next few days allowed Castiel to really get some rest, he didn't sleep of course. But by not moving his body was relaxed and would heal faster.
‘’I don’t want to talk about it right now Dean! Just leave it alone please.’’
''No!'' Jack screams.
Still no fun.’’
‘’Yeah, I realised.’’
Castiel pretended he didn’t noticed it and when he was done changing, Dean seemed to be very busy staring
‘’Hey, it’s just me. You were having a nightmare.’’
‘’I’ll go get the ingredients from the back of the impala.’’
‘’I think your brother is kinda drunk.’’ Chuck chuckled.
‘’Glad to see you’re with us Cas.’’ A low pitched voice said with a sarcastic tone, waking him from his daydream while doing so. Meg had been looking at him with raised eyebrows, apparently he and Luke had reached their destination and made their way over to were she was standing in the corner of the room.
Cas knew he was save here, so he didn’t fight it when darkness was forming around the corners of his eyes.
‘’Dean.’’ Castiel grunted.
‘’Now, I must say Castiel. You don’t really look like an angel. Sure these.. ‘’
‘’Really.’’
After a while he couldn’t stop yells and whimpers from escaping his mouth.
‘’Oh, yeah, I guess we both got little brothers named Sam to worry about. I’m talking about Samandriel.’’
‘’Fine fine- touchy touchy.’’
Yes, there had been moments in between world endings and hunts were he had allowed himself to be happy, with Dean...and Sam.
‘’It’s not. And everyone who knows you sees it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love, you fought for this whole world, for love, that is who you are.’’
Dean wasn’t anywhere to be seen when Castiel woke up.
As Chuck was distracted by Gabriel, Dean took an angel blade out of his boot and plunged it in chuck’s stomach, he wanted to say something snarky and punch the motherfucker in the face for all the shit he put them through, but his first priority right now was getting Cas and Sam to safety.
left me no other choice.''
''I love you too Dean.''
Ouch, that one hurts. But Sam had a point.
But… I have the upper hand, and I want you guys to know that.’’
Michael raised the angelblade above Castiel.
Sam nodded. And they went on.
‘’CAS!?’’ He shouted, he banged his hands on the glass, but his friend didn’t wake and the glass was still whole.
She took a deep breath to calm herself, and went on;
‘’Does.’’
‘’He can’t hear you.’’ A woman voice said.
‘’Very little flesh but good crunch, oh so tempting.’’
Sam hadn’t seen that one coming.
‘’Yeah sure, if they can handle your insufferable ass.’’
‘’No.’’
He closed his eyes and lied down on the cold frozen floor.
''Castiel, just tell Sam. He deserves to know.'' Jack said.
After all, Heaven still wasn’t his biggest fan, even after all this time.
He clearly hates taking orders like this.
‘’I can’t.’’
In the meantime he was going to continue helping and healing Castiel like this.
His brother better gets his shit together, and fast.
‘’I’m sorry.’’ Chuck pleaded.
He stepped over Uriel’s body (Uriel got the better deal and went to the empty, he didn’t disobey his orders directly but still didn’t stick to the plan) and went to take a stroll in the park.
’’Luke I’m busy, I need to finish this essay tonight and I’m nowhere near done, either tell me what you need
‘’Since she fucking touched Cas. Nobody gets a free pass after touching Cas.’’
‘’I know smart-ass, but I remember something. When we went to bed, I specifically remember closing the door, because it wouldn’t lock properly.
‘’They really did a number on you huh?’’ Chuck said as he took in the angels injuries.
‘’It is hard, especially with Sam he-…’’  Dean raised his eyebrows.
‘’…Let there be no mercy.
‘’She shot him, but I got the bullet out and I think the wound stopped bleeding.’’
''Want me to add another hole to the collection Deano?'' Michael sneered.
‘’No, you did something incredibly dumb. I made a deal, with a cosmic entity, I don’t know what you did to break it but I have a feeling its reckless and dangerous.’’
‘’I love this song.’’ Dean said.
‘’Hey Dean.’’
‘’Can I have this Dance?’’
‘’All in time. Because I know you two are not
''Don't use such language, it will not help your angel. Now, something that will help Castiel is one simple word. Meet me and face your destiny Dean. Or I will torture Castiel for all of eternity and he will wish he was dead.''
Gabriel tried to control his anger towards Chuck.
‘’Except me and Jack.’’
He reminded himself that it was just a dream, his father wasn't here, and he was on campus.
‘’You’re the most caring man on earth, you are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know.’’
''Dean? Are you in there?'' Sam asks, still hoping his brother can hear him, somehow.
“I still think you’re a dick. But you’re allowed to be his dick…’’
Castiel had to act now, if she shot him he didn’t know if he had the energy or strength to get back up.
‘’How do… you know me?’’ Castiel grunted, he could still move his lips, but it took a lot of effort to talk.
Castiel smiled.
Sam knew better.
‘’I thought you were gone- I thought the empty…’’
But now even Chuck had let him down.
Sam walked over to the waitress as she put her phone away.
''Yes, Dean I know.''
Castiel let out a painted gasp as he shifted in a more comfortable position in the backseat, and after a while Dean could hear him snore slightly, he let his hands relax on the wheel a bit.
‘’You can keep me in here for centuries, but Dean will be dead in under an hour. And you want him alive right? Don’t freeze him, please.’’
The door bursted open and thunder was to be heard.
Castiel felt strange when they got back, like he was being summoned by something in the back of his mind.
More voices.
''But in a good way?'' Dean grinned.
''What are we gonna do Cas? Michael won't let him go this time.''
But all in all, Dean was witty, quick with a comeback and had Castiel laughing until his stomach hurt and tears were starting to form in his eyes.
‘’And?’’
‘’I thought so too. Maybe Gabe knows something. Or it was nothing.’’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘’Is that 24/7 diner still open?’’
‘’I’m going to shoot you you fucking bitch-‘’
Gabriel scratched his head.
''I think my dad did the best he could, I think, at the time.''
done this before?’’ Dean asked as they slowly started to sway to the song together.
be angry at you.
‘’Enough! That’s quite enough Uriel.’’
She opened the door to the empty room that wasn’t frozen.
Hey guys!
‘’No Sammy. Fuck her, she doesn’t deserve to be burned.’’
Castiel sighed and dropped his pencil onto his desk in defeat.
‘’Come in Jack.’’
Castiel's back arched and he screamed, he bit down hard on the soapy towel. The room was spinning. Although Sam's hand had dissapeard of the wing and Dean's hand was currently on his shoulder trying to keep him still so he wouldn't hurt himself worse, the pain didn't dissapear and Castiel didn't stop moving and thrashing.
‘’Okay, I get that you’re worried. But we have to be careful, if something happened to Cas- and that’s a big if.. it probably has something to do with Chuck. And for Cas’s sake, we’ll have to be careful. ‘’
Dean frowned at Cas.
‘’He had a weird attitude towards me. It was somehow possessive and It made me feel really uncomfortable.’’
‘’Maybe you could cuddle up next to him? Bed is big enough.’’
‘’If you so say.’’
He closed his eyes and drifted away in less than 5 minutes.
Castiel counted the seconds in the back of the van, it was hard to not let his mind wonder.
‘’I know you’re a Winchester, but do you have to be so rude?’’ Chuck said when he finally stood facing them.
He felt sad when she ripped his trench coat to shreds, just to see the look on his face. He hoped he was still able to fix it later, but he was probably just going to have to buy a new one again.
It had been a while since his father, and that particular scene had crept into his dreams and made them nightmares, and he had to admit this was really poor timing as well. His eyes shifted to the now cold coffee on his right and he almost automatically grabbed the cup and gulped the rest down.
‘’He told me he had written me out of the story.. But I maybe that’s been going on long before you two were even born. I think to some degree, he knew the entire plan from the very start. He knew Cas was going to choose Dean. And that’s why he wanted me out of the way.’’
‘’I am.’’
Dean fell silent again.
‘’Heaven is just as bad as hell.’’
Castiel finally screamed both out of hurt and pain and when Zachariah had dropped the whip and left the room, he passed out.
He smiled slightly of relief. They were coming.
''Cas, no... We just got you back, why would you do that?''
Dean and Cas pulled apart quickly, just when Sam also appeared in the doorway.
‘’I won’t let it get bad unless you guys won’t do what I say. I can either leave Castiel human. And alive… or drain his life-force really slowly.. and really painfully while letting Zachariah and Uriel be artistic with him… If you know what I mean.’’’
‘’Yes? What- tell me how to fix this, why aren’t you healing?’’
Because something was off here and Sam had the feeling that that something is an archangel who apparently- Doesn’t listen very well.
''But it doesn't matter, I won't be happy for now. Not with Dean gone.''
‘’Welcome to my headquarters! You won’t be able to see much of it because I know you will try to escape or kill me when I’ll try to give you a tour, so we’re just going to skip that part.’’
‘’No.’’
‘’…he seems a little-’’
Dean seemed to think about that for a moment, Cas was glad his words were reaching him.
‘’Thought you told me you were healed?’’
Dean gripped his brother tight.
Finally, Sam and Jack entered the room.
''Not that good, are we almost home?''
''You guys found me- Michael came.. He had his little scary villain talk and.. I banished him? Right?''
‘’Much better. Now where was I… Owh yes. So, the part about Castiel getting human. Well, he’s a really big concern for me at the moment. If I didn’t have him so well looked over for me.. I bet he could mess up the entire plot… That would mean that I have to start over all again.. And well we wouldn’t want that wouldn’t we?’’
He would probably make a stupid joke about them.
‘’I’m a Winchester, we don’t exactly have a clear history with following deals.’’
TW// Alcohol
That was a red flag for sure.
‘’And why would that be a hard deal for me to make? Because I’m not getting what’s the catch for you here.’’
(but we can't predict the future now.. can we?)
Zachariah had started with just an angel blade.
''You're drained man. Just close your eyes.''
Brothers and sisters, we may not always agree on most things. But I need every single one of you right now….’’
And Gabriel’s eyes went back to their normal honey brown ones before he fell to the floor,
“When he gets his strength back. When we know he’s okay. I’ve waited this long, I can wait longer.”
‘’I’m doing you and the world a favor. You act like you can’t see your feelings for the frozen, broken halo laying on the floor outside. But he’s come to terms with his feelings you know? Hell I think he even thought about saying them out loud once or twice! But you
‘’Thanks- uh.. I guess.’
‘’Well.. it’s a complicated situation to sum it up. But my parents are very religious,  and try to put words in all of our heads, I didn’t want them there, just like my older brother Gabriel, and Samandriel and Anna. But Zachariah and Ishim continued my parents way of life, which doesn’t have to be a bad thing, but the way they lived it meant they automatically hated me because of who I am and love.’’
''Cas. What was Michael talking about?''
‘’And the scourge was made out of melted down angel blades. But that’s not the point..’’
‘’Don’t be.’’
‘’Yes.. yess! Same team! Gimme something to work with here!’’
Yet in pain.
Things only went down hills from there.
‘’After we’ve figured out what to do with those wings.’’
‘’Okay? You don’t have to do it-‘’
After 30 he was wondering why it was taking so long.
‘’Dean?’’
‘’Sometimes you need to talk about something in order to forget it.’’
But that was a problem for later, right now he needed to focus on his mission.
''Yeah, that was a big win. We haven't had a big win with no strings attached in a long time.''
‘’Yes, you are a stubborn little creature and I have the feeling that all that pain will only test you to try your limits. That’s why I’m healing you next. Give me your hand.’’
‘’Castiel!’’ Chuck yelled happily as he flew the doors open of Castiel’s room and walked inside.
‘’ n.. -ot real.’’ Casiel half screamed.
Hi guys,
''We still have a few hours left to drive, just try to get some rest okay? Maybe it will help you heal.''
Castiel laughed.
‘’Hello Castiel.’’
''No, he left the door open, he's back.''
‘’Goodluck, and be careful okay? If anything goes wrong, call me, right away.’’
Something older.
But first this woman needed to die.
''Don't linger on the bad thoughts man, there's so much more to see.''
‘’Agreed.’’
It left firery, and painful marks along Castiel’s wings which reminded him of hellfire, but he may actually prefer hell over this.
''You do.''
Point is, he liked how his dorm looked, it felt like him. He didn’t have that at home, so in a way, the little space he’d gotten from Redwood felt more like a home than his real one.
‘’Let him go!’’ Jack yelled.
‘’You’re not all angels.’’
‘’Sam, shut up. The spotlight isn’t on you right now.’’
He wouldn’t let her get her dirty hands on Dean, Castiel knew that much.
‘’Why was it saying that?’’
‘’Nah, I still have some leftover rice. But bring some for Gabriel, I’m sure he would appreciate that.’’
Castiel was done with being useless.
badly.
‘’Yup.’’
‘’I know, I know how you see yourself Dean, you see yourself the same way our enemies see you.
''So where is Dean?''
Castiel could hear Dean say more words.
‘’What the hell do you mean by that?’’
(I may be posting another chapter in a few minutes from now)
Chapter 5
‘’Luke.’’
‘’Sssht! I’m coming, but- ‘’ He opened the door, ''Its 3 fucking am! What-‘’
‘’Dean.’’ Sam grabbed his arm. ‘’We need her.’’
Or it could be
Dean frowned at him while exhaling smoke from his mouth.
Castiel watched with wide eyes as Michael carefully took a can of holy oil and poured it over what looked like an whip, Michael hummed as he lit the end of it on fire with a snap of his finger.
Dean’s words where coming out in raspy breaths.
his point by badly faking a dramatic faint.
‘’C’mon Cas, It’s not that bad. Besides I can’t just leave you here on the ground.’’
‘’Uhm.. Good question, I think there should be like an emergency button or something, in warehouses like this it’s standard procedure. We’re just going to have to find it, what are we gonna do about Louise?’’
Sorry guys, I'm really sick and did not feel motivated to write at all.
Sam went to the dungeon to get some chains and Castiel double checked the cuffs when Michael sturred.
‘’What makes you think he feels the same now?’’
Okay, sure, maybe a big crush.
‘’I highly doubt that, you smell nice, if it smells bad in here it wouldn't be because of you.’’
Castiel sipped his beer, as he looked around the room, the green eyes still in the back of his mind.
I'm gonna upload every 2-3 days, I almost have a break off school (because Christmas n shit.) But I'll be in Germany with a friend for one week, so I I may upload less or not in that week :(
‘’CASTIEL!!’’ Dean yelled.
Dean Winchester was leaning in his doorpost with a mischievous grin on a face.
Cas let out a hiss as Dean’s elbow accidentally bumped into Cas’s left wing and Dean muttered a small; ‘’Sorry.’’
The Empty’s smile grew.
‘’Okay?’’ Dean was surprised, he thought this was gonna be another long discussion but Cas gave up too easy, didn’t seem to be as fine as he said he was.
Sure.. He had changed. Heaven had changed.
‘’I'm going to ignore that, because you never care about your own well being so I'm allowed to, and ask; do you remember what happened while you were
‘’You’re probably right. Plus if the warding would’ve failed the alarm would’ve woken us up. You hungry?’’
‘’You can't. But I know what to expect from you guys. I trust you. It’s up to you if you decide to trust me, although from what I gathered, It seems like you don’t have much of a choice.’’
‘’Walk.’’
After that, Zachariah went to get something new.
Castiel huffed.
He walked through the halls until he got to the right door, opened it, and when he went inside he found Castiel and Dean very much asleep in the same bed.
. I was willing to work with you because I fucked up on my behalf, but if you’re not willing to obey, I’m going to leave you here…’’
Dean really was disgusted by Chuck at this point.
''Of course Dean.''
This time Cas couldn’t say what he’d wanted to say.
‘’So.. you had to write you out.. because that way Cas would be all alone?’’
‘’Is that Billie’s scythe?’’ Jack frowned.
‘’…Sam and me are trying to get to you. We’re going to fix this.
Suddenly Bright blue light filled the room.
Castiel had waken up halfway and couldn't fall back into sleep.
‘’Don’t listen to him.’’ Dean said.
They watched as Castiel looked up out of nowhere, like he heard something.
‘’Uhh.. well. Yes. Although I was close to being one a few times.’’
‘’Cas.. He’s always been a different type of angel. It was what spoke to me. He questioned his orders right from the start. He was gifted, talented..  smart. And could see from a different perspective than most of the angels his age.
‘’Missed ya too Cas.’’
Sam had to look through the entire bunker until he thought to check the backroom with the demon trap, ( nothing good ever happened in there ) he opened the door and Dean was sitting in a corner, staring at a wall, completely out of it.
who I thought was cute.’’
Dean walked over to where Sam had been standing and saw his brother pull an angelblade from underneath the bed.
‘’This is where we lost the signal, I hope he’s still here.’’ Dean announced.
They went inside and emptied every last drop off oil and gasoline they had.
So yeah, it was better to ‘’just enjoy it while you can still taste it.’’
‘’Maybe he liked the gesture.’’
‘’Who said anything about you leaving Cas?’’
'' I'm fine Dean.''
Sam, Dean and Cas were sitting in the impala, it was late at night and there were a lot of stars today, Castiel was looking out of the window lost in though, he’d had a discussion with Dean earlier today about him not coming with them, Dean had said that Castiel was still too weak and needed to rest, but because Cas was a trained soldier and was able to shoot the most terrifying of looks, he had won.
‘’A hunter killed your… ‘’
couldn’t conceal the blush that crept onto his face.
That was all that mattered.
Dean looked a bit taken aback at that, it was a strange compliment.
‘’What do you mean?’’
Castiel sighed.
‘’That’s because you were singing along and your voice is worse than terrible.’’
''Go to hell.'' Sam spatt in his face.
Eventually, they came across an empty room that didn’t appear to be frozen and Dean wondered why that was. He then turned around and almost had a heart-attack.
''Why is it always a creepy warehouse?'' Dean sighed as he parked the impala, they had traced the phonecall to this adress and ignored all the stop signs on the way.
‘’That’s what I thought.’’
‘’And.. ya know, thanks for.. stepping in like you did. You were pretty badass.’’
‘’Most of the things in there are innocent, they had to be an easy target for Louise.
‘’But can’t Angels and Demons see each others real forms or some shit?’’
Cas nodded with a yawn.
‘’What’s wrong?’’
‘’Okay, right. Well, there’s still a huge warehouse with frozen monsters out there, what are we going to do about that?’’
‘’Stop.’’
‘’I love you too, you idiot.’’
‘’I’m sorry we couldn’t get there sooner.’’
It was silent in the car he’d stolen from the bunker.
Cas huffed as he put the joint in his mouth.
‘’That’s why the deal is not about your life.’’
Chapter 13
Chapter 2
‘’Dean, you haven’t slept in 3 days. We can do this tomorrow, you need your hours or you’re going
Dean was looking at a mirror image of himself.
through gritted teeth.
‘’You don’t have to do this… uhm..’’ He didn’t even knew her name, it wasn’t like he really cared. To him she was a monster, but it had more become a habit of his to call people by their names.
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked guilty, and emotional.
But the only thing keeping him up right now was the thought that if he fell asleep, Castiel could wake up and he couldn’t do anything because he was asleep- and Chuck might’ve done something so bad-
‘’I know where he is.’’
‘’You said Cas mentioned his powers were failing. Besides, he once told me that it’s more of a tune on tune off kinda thing, and he doesn’t like looking at Demons their real form.’’
‘’Right, okay.’’
He took the scythe away from the Empty’s neck.
Dean looked at Cas, his mouth fell open a bit, and he blinked.
''Yeah. I'm fine, let's keep on walking.''
‘’I used to hate him. But now I feel for him. What you did it’s.. it’s monstrous.
‘’I don’t know, I didn’t drink alone.’’ Cas said as he tilted his head at Meg and frowned.
‘’Easily. He’ll ace his college with his eyes closed, and even if he doesn’t, I’ll be proud of whatever he goes on to do.’’
‘’What are you going to do to me?’’
‘’You’re scared? That’s okay Castiel. You should be. But I’m not done yet, when I get to the Winchesters, and I WILL get to the Winchesters, I’m going to bring them here, I’m going to kill Sam and make Dean watch, then show him your frozen form so he will be completely and utterly broken when I freeze him with his lonely sad little thoughts, and I’m going to make sure that his cell will be facing yours, so you’ll see each other but you’ll never be able to reach each other.’’
Was he stil an angel?
Eventually, after a month of calm before the storm, something happened.
‘’So that’s why your attention
Chuck was going to have to figure that out later.
‘’He made a mistake. Jack was his son. I would’ve done the same.’’
You’re destructive, you’re angry, and you’re broken, and you’re daddy’s blood instrument.
‘’We brought you here. You’re still alive. I’m sure Chuck will understand when we remind him how infuriating you really are.’’ Zachariah said, still keeping himself calm.
Castiel raised an eyebrow,
Okay, not the point.
He turned his head to look at the figure that was now sitting next to him on the park bench.
‘’Chuck’s energy is in him. It’s sucking out his grace slowly before what I assume retreating and leaving him human…But the process..it’s excruciating. ’’
Castiel hurried over to the tray once again grabbed the keys off it and hurried over to open the door that stood between him and his family.
‘’Is that why he seemed so mad to see you hiding on earth?’’
is a mouth full, nicknaming is probably a common thing y’all do.’’
‘’I think we should introduce Cas to Dean, like I said before, but you probably conveniently
Cas would not recover from this in one night.
''No, I need you.. to get to Dean Winchester.''
little remains of soap on it.
He was reliving every time he used his grace and although it was very traumatising, Chuck had been right. It didn’t hurt. It felt just like dreaming.
‘’What?’’
''Cas? What's happening? Are you okay?''
And then Castiel kissed him.
‘’No, I forgave you for that a long time ago. I was talking about the times when you knew what we were fighting, but decided to do nothing.’’
‘’No? Wait- so .. what?’’
Castiel jumped up from the bench, his angel blade ready and aimed at what he considered his brother and adviser a long time ago.
‘’Thanks, but I'm not perfect, he deserved someone better.''
But Castiel was just.. not listening.
Trigger warnings for this chapter are in the notes if you need them!
Cas sighed and let his head fall back on the bed, he hadn't been looking forward to this part.
After Cas told him he loved him.
Cas mentally slapped himself in the face as he pretty much set Dean up to that one. ‘’If your next pick up line is another dad joke
Dean Winchester passing up an opportunity to use humor as a coping mechanism?
The Empty stepped closer, now standing right in front of Dean, with the sigil being the only thing holding it back.
Yes, Castiel knows that.
It felt very wrong to accept this deal, immortal sounds great at first glance, but Dean didn’t want to think about the angel being completely alone after he was gone.
‘’Dean?’’
And Castiel stood up, walked to the door and got into his car. The pain as gone as fast as it had came, he felt kind of.. numb now.
''Because I only wanted to banish Michael, and I have the control in here. From now on that is.''
‘’Figures. Still don’t feel bad for her death, she had It coming.’’ Dean said.
''Dean's mind.'' Castiel replied.
Wheee,
Dean cupped Castiel’s face carefully, to not trigger the angel.
Sam smiled.
‘’What are you going to do?’’
‘’You really thought you could just teleport them out of this? This whole thing is about them. One of them dies and I let Cas go. I can let you go too and take care of your brother if you stop fighting this. Stop fighting me.’’
‘’ I will be reminding Castiel that he choose the wrong team. Knock on the door twice and I will heal him like nothing happened.’’
But he had told himself he was going to stand his ground.
Chuck was in a bad mood.
Zachariah had to take a breath to control himself and Castiel was sure he was convincing himself that killing him was not worth Chuck’s wrath.
‘’No, but I assume you do so you want me to do so as well.’’
__________________________________
‘’You’re saying I’m broken.. ?’’
‘’I told you I can do this alone, now get your ass out of here and have fun playing detective.’’
‘’Alright, yeah, I know. I’m not flirting my way outta this one. Okay, so. I summoned the Empty, because I wanted to get you back.’’
‘’We lost the signal. Why does the dibshit always forget to charge his goddamn phone?’’
Castiel frowned at Dean and managed to look.. offended?
Dean was about to say that yes, that’s what drives him, that’s what he is.
‘’It’s mum!’’
Dean looked at Cas one more time, and walked to the door.
Like the entity had said it was worse than hell, because at least hell was something.
Cas avoided Dean's eyes as he continued, he felt guilty for not being able to be there for his younger brother.
He sighed and let his head hang as he heard footsteps announcing that Louise had returned.
‘’Owh Castiel.. ‘’ Another voice appeared behind him.
Dean was really good at messing with his feelings.
He hovered his hand above the angel’s forehead and began to search.
‘’Dean will confess his love if you go back. And you will too and you will be happy and die.’’
‘’So what? She caught herself some demons and had some fun? Cas wouldn’t go after someone who was murdering monsters. That’s just seems like another hunter.’’
‘’Because you know that if you die. Cas would kill me.’’
falling.
‘’I wasn’t finished, it says here that she’s a collector of supernatural artifacts. She’s been wanted for kidnapping, murder and several car thefts. The police caught her once and she told them that she’d been experimenting on things that weren’t human, that she was doing gods work.’’
And it was not Castiel’s father that did it.
That must’ve been hell for Cas, Dean thought, and he still only screamed once.
‘’I’m not. I will give him all his grace back. He can live as an angel again. I’ll restore heaven as my final act. Dean listen to me… ’’ Chuck walked over too Dean. They stood face to face.
''We were always going to end up here. You're my sword Dean, my perfect vessel.. ''
Castiel sighed.
They were silent for a moment as Cas smoked some of it.
Castiel walked over to Dean, he put his hand against Dean's forehead, letting his grace sowly flood to his fingertips and enter Dean's mind again.
Maybe this would go faster if he was asleep?
‘’Yeah- And I was a douche. I Panicked, hurt him more by sending him away- But he was better off without me anyways. I would only attract danger… It was my job to protect him. But I guess you two have been doing that for me lately.’’
TRIGGER WARNING
Chuck had been so focused on getting Dean over to the dark side,
They rode for a few more hours in silence with low volumed rock on in the background.
‘’Jerk.’’
Dean looked disappointed by that.
‘’Sensitive subject huh..’’
___________
‘’Well he didn’t drink enough to be drunk, or have you been pre-partying before you
She turned on the light and grinned.
completely crashed with another one of Cas’s screams.
‘’-and you need your strength. I promise you, sleeping through the whole ordeal is a lot more pleasant than feeling the last of your grace fade.’’
‘’You never talk about what you feel.’’
It was like a punch to his gut.
‘’Hello Dean.’’
Gabriel placed a glowing hand on Castiel’s forehead, and after struggling a little more, Castiel relaxed and his eyes closed slowly.
‘’Cas… jezus.’’ Sam whispered.
Luke was like this, always doing the most to get a laugh out of people, but it (for the most part) seemed to work, and at times his best friend could be genuinely funny. But Luke wasn’t just that, he was more than trying to be the clown at every party,
and he’d fallen they had been damaged, since he got his grace back he still hadn’t dared to look at them.
''A really good way.''
‘’That’s why I wrote you out of them.’’
He got closer to the angel and placed his hands on Cas’s hips.
with a smile.
''Uhm.. okay.. and which bone-..''
‘’Because it’s poetic. You became human here for the first time, and you will become human here for the last time. Uriel, Zachariah, guard him. Do not
Chapter 14
‘’Nothing. There are more angels with black wings, they're just not as common as white.’’
''Okay, about what Michael had said.. God-'' Dean scratched the back of his head, struggeling to find the right words. ''This is gonna be impossible, but uhm- Wel.. He's right... I don't know when it started, but these feelings... I don't really understand them. I just know that they are there for a reason.. And I didn't think I would ever be able to feel them for a men.. But then again, you're not a man. You're an angel, so maybe that's even more impossible. I don't know Cas.''
‘’She’s human right?’’
He needed to forget about the deal.
‘’It’s not Gabe, he’ll get better.’’
Castiel liked that about Dean.
But he thinks he got why everyone liked it so much now.
‘’C’mon man of course we’re not.’’
forgot to mention that.’’
and if the answer is attention go find Meg.’’
‘’Well, I was hunting for your boyfriend first.. But I can’t say no to an Angel like you Cassie. You always seemed fascinating to me. And I was planning on getting you soon anyways!’’
Like he was happy to die, like he said what needed to be said but before he heard what he needed to hear.
‘’That I fought against Castiel…’
‘’Please Cassie. Pull through.’’
Dean seemed even more shocked, he covered his mouth with his hand and looked at the damage as if he didn't know where to start.
‘’Dean got me back.’’ Castiel smiled at the young boy, slowly rubbing circles on the back of his head to calm him down a bit.
But before Sam got an reply Dean had already knocked down the wooden door.
Dean sighed.
‘’Heya Cas! Glad you could make it dude.’’
‘’Again?’’
Chuck snapped his fingers and Castiel’s chains disappeared, the angel fell to the ground with a grunt.
‘’You can’t really call him my husband now, can’t you? Because I was stupid and dumb, I didn’t realise what I had until it was gone. So like you.’’
Castiel spat out the blood that had formed in his mouth, and it landed right in front of Zachariah’s shoes. (He went for the shoes, but his aim had taken a toll when Uriel had beaten the shit out of him).
‘’Call it Daddy issues, but god.. I never liked you.’’
‘’Why does he never tell me things like that?’’
‘’Let this be a final warning. Your angel is still alive. I will keep it that way. But only if you remember our deal…’’
‘’Rebel.’’ Dean smiled back.
He could feel his grace starting to weaken, faster than it had before.
‘’I’m sure, I’ll make it work with us believe me, and if it takes me I’ll be with Cas, so I’m good.
He hoped he wasn’t, but of course the one time he wanted to be wrong, his gut had told him it was his deceiving father, and he’d been right.
He gathered all the power he had and somehow managed to send Michael flying across the room, and although the piercing pain from using it all at once shot through his head, he darted towards the archangel lying on the ground and placed the special cuffs Gabriel had gave him on Michaels wrists.
''Sam! Help me get him down!''
‘’Let’s get you to sleep.’’
There was nothing to proof it was even there except for the blood still on Dean’s hands.
‘’I will sit here and ‘'heal up a bit.’’ But if anything goes wrong you will call immediately, understood?’’
Dean huffed.
Sam huffed.
‘’Oh my god I know you're worried. I know your madly in love with my little brother- which by the way is a surprise to absolutely no one, and by the way you should still get my blessing for because you’ve been a dick to him, but can you shut up for one darn second and let me talk before I make your nostrils disappear?’’
‘’Raphael.. You must see some sense here!’’
Castiel gave Sam a small smile, and they left the room.
''Good.''
Dean huffed, ‘’I bet they are, how many?’’
Dean didn’t mind though.
‘’It’s fine Dean, I want to try.’’
''Uhm... I'm just afraid.I-I guess..''
‘’You don’t know what dignity is, you have controlled them their entire lives, and I suggest you stop talking now so you can go down with your last bit of dignity.’’ Castiel bit back.
‘’Did you know you got something on your shirt Castiel?’’
''I'm not dead... so yes.''
Anyway, his shouting seemed to have worked, because the angel shot to a sitting position right away.
*Comment and Kudos are really appreciated! I love to hear what you guys have to say <3
continuing their search for Dean.
''We'll take it slow.'' Dean got closer, Castiel caught his staring at his lips, but he didn't mind. It was no secret anymore, they could stop pretending that they didn't do that.
But now I'm back with even more angst, just remember; it gets worse before it gets better. :)
The next part was even worse.
‘’Sorry to interrupt this emotional moment but we're switching from the commercial break to the real deal.'’
I caused a lot of suffering on earth. But I devastated heaven.. I vaporised thousands of my own kind.. And I- Du.. I d.. I can’t go back.’’
''Well, I'm not going to deny that that has crossed my mind a few times too.''
Dean was sitting in front of the map-table, a beer on it and his laptop in front of him.
‘’That was very amusing.’’
Dean could only hope it gave him some form of hope.
Although he had only dreamed once when he was human and he had hated the experience,
‘’Oh.’’ Cas slowly reached out for Dean’s hand and Dean took it halfway.
‘’Uh.. yeah.. just as like, everything…’’ Sam frowned.
‘’Dean, are you sure? What if it doesn’t want to work with us? What if it takes you too?’’
But it could be.. just maybe..
''Don't you dare! Leave him the fuck alone you evil son of a bitch!''
‘’Open the door, get him out.’’
Torture/ graphic violence
‘’You fell asleep yesterday so that means you can try eating now, and most of the damage is not all of the damage.’’
At least the bullet hole had started to heal.
‘’Cas! Cas..Shit, fuck.’ there was a lot of blood on Dean’s hands- Castiel’s blood.
Cas put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, just like he’d done so many times before in a moment of comfort. Just like he had did when he pulled him out of hell.
‘’Fine, then I’ll get some sleep. You good though?’’
Cas send a glare at Dean, who shrugged.
He was turning his head from left to right- and his breathing came in ragged, short breaths.
‘’You guys hungry?’’
Dean pointed the scythe at the Empty’s throat, it put its hands in the air.
Be grateful that we are ending you swiftly. Although you do not deserve it. ‘’
‘’What the fuck do you think you’re doing?’’
Castiel had one more weapon left.
He also liked the way he scrunched his nose when he needed to think, the small freckles on his face that only appeared when hit with the shitty lighting that came from Dean’s slightly flickering lamp, his voice and Dean’s stories that seemed to have matching themes with Castiel’s adventures, and Castiel couldn’t get over how easy it was to loose himself in Dean’s eyes, Cas was sure he loved Dean’s eyes,
Cas took in the whole backseat, so Sam and Jack had been cramped in one seat.
So Dean didn't know he was a prisoner in his own mind, most of the times, people who were possessed by an (arch)angel or even an demon for that matter knew that they weren't in the real world.
‘’Go stand guard.’’
Castiel said nothing.
‘’Because if I see.. What heaven’s become.. What I..’’ Castiel had to look away and let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. ‘’What I made of it..’’
Dean tasted like vodka and mint, and Castiel could smell his cologne, it was a strong one, and kind of spicy, but it smelled like Dean. Castiel liked that too.
But now Cas was moving on…
They hurt, he couldn’t move them and he knew they needed a lot of work and care, but he himself couldn’t reach them and he wasn’t going to ask someone else to touch his wings.
‘’Hi friend of Meg, I’m Dean.’’ Dean said, with a grin as he took Cas’ hand and as he shook it,
Michael hang up.
after searching for a while he found the one he was looking for and he tried it out.
Now what do I have to say, what do I have to do?
He left his father's body at Bobby's door
I touch.
Dean is not coming back. He is very angry, but Dean would not abandon me, he would never leave me.
"Yes, I left you but now I'm trying to fix it." He snatches.
I run towards the field, but I hear that they begin to follow me.
Look boy. The officer says. Your dad is currently being wanted for child neglect, and you are still a minor and have only two options. My gaze goes to the officer, great now I can't get out of this. One: You end up in a juvenile center and your brother in an orphanage. I tense up, never that. Two: You and your brother will stay with your older brother, if so he prefers, so he decides?
He'll be fine with Dean.
He will be in his 20s, his short hair.
And what is this place? he asked, looking at the ways out, I don't have much time until dad goes with my little brother.
-I stopped being your brother a long time ago Jack, I left you, I left you here with someone who knew that you would be better because the hell they do not lose hope with me.- I feel like a teenager even knowing that I am of legal age.
That? Why are you telling me this? Dean approaches me, but he didn't pay attention to him now he turns to Jack.
My only real brother.
He's my brother. He says, my fists are clenched leaving my knuckles almost white.
Did you call him? The officer asks. To who?
When I arrive I see the big house.
"No, you're our brother." Jack whispers looking at me.
I'll go with you, I'll do whatever it takes but don't separate me from him. Whisper looking at the men, Dean frowns, true he does not know who the child is.
What were they hunting? Jack asked looking at the older ones.
Chill chill. He raised his hands to show them. I just wanted to put my jacket on my brother. I remark brother in his face. He's cold, I can't let him get sick.
Time to be a big boy, Sam. He starts to pull his belt off him, what is he going to do? And for that you must bear the pain, no matter what, tomorrow I will teach you to shoot, and use everything.
-Okay Sam, we're here and we won't go anywhere else.- Jack smiles at me and at that moment I just want to cry, it's all over. But what do I do now, I'm a hunter. Was he? John took away my childhood just like them, but they could make a life, not me. I do not know yet.
Two policemen, Sonny and Dean Winchester are in front of me.
Jack. I stop him before he eats. Hands. I tell him and he snorts but he gets up.
Thanks, Sony. The officer says goodbye and walks out the door.
Which was what surprised Jack but in the end he got along very well with the thick Dean
I run until he can't take it anymore, my tears come out loud but I know it's for the best.
When he finishes I get up and look down.
Calm. Sonny grabs Dean by the shoulder pulling him away from me.
Dean 31
After all that the road is only silence.
Jack. I speak but Dean looks at me looking for an explanation, which I don't give.
Sam, what the hell are you talking about? Dean looks puzzled.
I know Jack will be better off here with Dean.
Because I think you are hungry. He looked at him mockingly.
He's had little episodes from his previous life, but he's still trying to move on.
He will have a happy and beautiful life.
It's all good, sleep. I whisper gripping him tightly.
Don't tell me, him. The man spoke to which the policeman nodded.
He rents a small apartment with his girlfriend Jessica Moore.
Yes, it won't be long in coming. Whoever it is, I don't know him.
We don't know, he was hunting with your father. Ellen looks at the two brothers that she has heard since she met Sam.
We went to bed, in the room there are two beds and furniture, I know that Dean lives with someone else but I don't know where he is.
Shit.
I walk and I walk.
"I'll only bring you pain and destruction." I whisper to the point of crying. And it's the truth, John always convinced me that it was all my fault.
"Why does John hate my brother so much?" My body completely paralyzed. "Why does he hurt or torture him when he takes his special juice? Why does he do it by screaming your name Dean? What did you do? Living a life of your own? For thinking of yourself? Why can't my brother think of himself like you? Is it me? Is it my fault? - Dean and I are crying looking at the 5-year-old boy who just gave us stop our thinking.
So If you don’t bring him back right the fuck now I will cut you open and flip you inside out.’’
DESTIEL! DESTIEL? OWH WAIT NOPE- CUZ IM MEAN AND NOW CAS IS IN TROUBLE.
But It's still not quite how I want supernatural to end.
Also, more alcohol did sound like a good idea.
‘’So? Let me continue on, I don’t care about god’s
‘’Still nothing. I’m starting to get worried.’’
‘’Yeah, I thought you would say that. But Dean didn’t call you back when you left… or did he?’’
And that broken angel? You're the one who broke him.
It’s was weird having them out of his vessel and in reach like this, he’d never had them out in a vessel except for the shadows if he wanted to be intimidating.
That hellish spear.
‘’Go on, your vessel’s waiting for you.’’
Okay so a few disclaimers:
That got Castiel’s attention for a second before he shook his head.
with beer and rolled his eyes at Dean.
Meanwhile Cas and Dean we're arguing like a married couple because Cas wouldn't take his clothes off.
Who was currently tapping his finger to the beat of a song.
After 15 minutes Sam regretted that he didn’t order anything else.
Castiel had told Sam that he was able to travel into Dean's mind without them, also giving them an easy way out if things got too risky.
______________________________
Gabriel couldn’t see the problem in what he was doing.
gain for you if I die, but you know what, it’s also very selfish too.
Sam and Cas stepped trough the door.
Castiel was not destined to have the one thing he wanted most in life.
Dean and Cas continued talking about nothing and everything until the sun started to go up, with their hands never leaving each other, that was until Cas remembered he had barely eaten anything yesterday because of that stupid assignment and his stomach was beginning to growl at him for it now.
‘’What? He would’ve, if he hadn’t robbed you.’’
Castiel rolled his eyes. ‘’You got anything to mix it with?’’
‘’I love you.’’
''No!'' Dean and Sam shouted together.
Maybe one of Naomi’s erased memories had slipped back?
‘’My name is Castiel.’’ He sneered as she put the cuffs on.
‘’Sammy and I managed to get the bullet out, but it’s not healing. Is there something else she did with your grace?’’
‘’Sure..’’ She sounded like she didn’t believe him.
‘’You want to continue?’’
‘’I’d go crazy not knowing if Sammy is okay.’’ Dean took the joint again as Cas passed it to him.
When Zachariah had told Castiel that he was going to make the angel (slowly becoming less angel) scream.. Castiel had a stubborn mindset.
Finish this man, who thinks he can play our saviour, while he has abandoned us, time and time again…’’
‘’Close your eyes.’’
Cas nodded.
''...Every second.''
Castiel could feel his eyes burn and had to blink several times to keep them from falling.
shouldn’t have had to, but if it brings you comfort, I think your mother would be proud of you. And Sammy definitely is too.’’
Sam smiled.
Emotion washed over Castiel’s face.
Castiel didn’t like the way Chuck had looked when he talked about him.
Zachariah pointed out.
Castiel knew.
‘’Oh. Sorry, Hi Meg.’’
Chuck rolled his eyes.
‘’Mmmhhh.. interesting. Now Cassie, it’s time for you to change your clothes. I have a nice set here.’’ She showed him the clothing she’d picked out for him, it was a white dress-like t-shirt with small golden details, Louise was holding a headpiece in her other hand, it was a golden laurel wreath.
Eventually Dean spoke up again, softly.
''Hey, Dean. Calm down, breath.''
‘’Zachariah.’’
‘’We’re free. We’re free!’’ He laughed as he gripped onto all of them.
he started drinking. He would be there- but he wasn't himself. He wasn't a good dad, and Sammy needed someone to look up to- I'm not a good role model but I'm
‘’So you’ve met Dean!’’
He awoke about 2 hours later when his door was knocked down.
Again Castiel shouted out in pain, Dean slowly brought him down.
and he had to admit it would be nice to have an excuse to stay in bed all day and watch his favourite
He had been so damn stupid.
‘’t-t-t. None of that, we need to have a nice long chat.’’ She told him.
''Interesting point, do you know where angels go when they die?''
''Well.. It looks like a door, so I think we would know when we've found one.. yes.''
‘’We don’t have to talk about this now if you don’t want to.’’ Sam said, a soft look in his face.
‘’Well- I have a feeling my room is occupied at the moment’’ Castiel said while waving around him.
Castiel nodded, he wasn’t a big beer drinker but it was always good to start with, while saving the heavy hitters for later.
''Watch me do it, tonight. I will escape tonight. So tonight... everybody dies. Except for me of course.''
Because they figured out very quickly that Chuck had left nobody on the planet except for his final draft.
‘’I told Gabriel already, you don’t have to be, It’s none of your faults and-‘’
‘’I meant it. I meant all of it.’’
son die, he will be alone, in a world that will be gone or has no place for him, in a universe that has always worked against him with no one else besides him.’’

‘’So what are we going to do now? We have no leads, no evidence we can use, not one fingerprint and there’s no sign of a struggle or a fight in Cas’s room. How the hell are we going to find him?’’ Dean said with a sigh, they had been sitting in the abandoned motel room and trying to come up with a plan.
‘’Hate to break it to you, but I don’t sound like that.’’
''Well, somebody had to. I know for a fact you weren't planning on doing it. But Castiel, it's not like it matters. You are gonna die tonight anyways, and I'll make sure you are last. First I'll kill Jack, slowly, and painfully. Then Sam, owh and believe me... I'm gonna get creative with Sam. And then I'll break all the bones in your body, making sure Deans feels every snap of it, and cut off your already broken wings.''
They lay Castiel down into the backseat and Dean had to ignore the ache to sit beside him and check if he was alright along the way, Sam couldn’t drive and Cas’s wings were making sure there was no room for Dean anyway.
‘’I think you do.’’
‘’Finally.’’ He muttered under his breath.
Cas let his head fall onto the desk in defeat.
Cas has been sleeping with an arm over Dean- and okay let’s be honest here, they may have fallen asleep spooning.
‘’Meg.’’
He’s been on his own before, he’s fine.’’
‘’Where to start where to start… Oh! I’ve been wanting to try this for a while now.’’
The next door was one labbeled with; ''Home''
‘’I’ts a shame. He had so much potential.’’
his eyes opened, then they glowed, first a bright yellow, then a fiery red, a light blue, and lastly a dark purple.
‘’What kind of clue?’’
‘’He’s dead.’’ He declared.
Castiel felt a surge of bravery (that may or may not have been caused by the vodka) and when Dean’s eyes briefly flickered to his lips, he didn't linger or wait and
''He's gone. I thought you would've seen him, why weren't you in the room with Dean?''
''D-don't.'' Castiel grunted out.
After Cas had filled everyone in, they got ready for Chuck.
Focus Dean.
His headpiece had fallen into the ring of holy fire, creating a possible escape for Castiel.
‘’Owh you stupid angel… I’m going to enjoy taking that rebel feature of your hands. After I’m done with you, falling seems like a walk in the park.’’
‘’Cas thought he was still dreaming, I don’t know exactly what god did to traumatise him this much, but I think a big role is that chair he's laying in.’’
‘’Well I was gonna ask your name, but if you’re cool with being called friend of Meg then that’s also fine with me, you look like you have a better name than that though.’’
''Yeah.. I guess my wings are almost the same as those of a normal bird. They're just bigger and contain a large part of my grace and being.''
Castiel shook his head.
He was a lost cause. And he didn’t want them here. Chuck was going to be here any minute.
‘’Well, I assume that nobody in Heaven is happy to see you except Father.’’
Hey, do you want me to drive for while? You look like you can use a nap.’’ Sam suggested.
Castiel whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
You need to ward the scythe, as far as I’m aware God doesn’t know you have it in possession yet, if he comes to close presence to it he will be able to feel it.’’
He really didn’t like where this was going though.
Sam stared out of the window, there weren’t a lot of stars to see. The room was on the second floor and Sam could see quit a lot from here, the streets had a creepy glow caused by the streetlights. It was completely empty, no cars in the parking lot and no people wondering around.
Castiel said nothing, so Chuck helped him stand straight and when the angel didn’t complain,
But Sam was not going to put up with that anymore.
''No. It's important.''
’No Dean, I don’t want that.’’
Sam stopped.
Which wasn’t fair.
Needed to go back to Dean.
It also was very cold, a lot of his skin was showing. The material of the dress was very thin and half of his shoulder was still exposed, along with his legs, arms, back and his wings.
help him get his thoughts straight and make him feel safer. Even though he never replied.
‘’When his wings are better, I will tell him when he’s got all his strength back.’’
‘’Heya Cas.’’
all came to crush him at once, but they were all good new sensations, even if they felt suffocating.
. “You’ve made me leave before.”
He almost didn’t have enough to heal her. The knowledge was haunting.
But if their lives were a fairy tale, they were one of the dark ones, full of blood and warning. Even as Castiel kissed Dean, as he reveled in receiving the one thing he’d wanted above all else, he could still feel the Mark whittling away at his self control. It was only a matter of time.
Castiel sighed, raised his hands to cover Dean’s. “The only way to keep God bound is through the Mark. And the Mark needs a bearer to stay secure.”
Castiel moved to the Mal’ak box and climbed awkwardly inside. He laid himself down on his back, staring at the ceiling until the Winchesters’ faces appeared above him. Sam reached in, touched his arm gently. Dean looked at him mutely for a long moment, then leaned over to turn Castiel’s face towards him. He stroked his fingers through his hair, traced a thumb over his eyebrow and down his cheek. Finally, he kissed him, holding his face like something precious.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean said. He moved his hand from Castiel’s cheek to curve around the back of his head; his fingers curled slightly in Castiel’s hair. “You feeling okay?”
Castiel thought about it, the way Sam and Eileen acted around each other, the fond glances, the teasing. They made a good match, but sometimes absence brought clarity. Even if Eileen left, it didn’t mean the end for them. A lesson Castiel finally felt he might be starting to learn himself.
He needed to get far away from here.
Castiel shrugged out of his coat and suit jacket, then held out his left arm where he’d felt the Mark manifesting on his skin. Dean hesitated before carefully unbuttoning the fastenings on his sleeve, rolling it up to his elbow. Then they both laid eyes on the Mark for the first time.
Dean’s eyes met his. “And how do you feel?”
Her girls. Claire. Jody was mother to her now; it was clear how much Claire loved her, underneath her bluster. And here Castiel was, destroying another iteration of Claire’ family.
. To Sam, standing idly by as he always did, a tacit endorsement of Dean’s every action.
, Castiel thought.
Sam sighed and nodded. Dean said nothing, the grip on his silver knife tight.
The shape of Castiel’s Mark was a mirror opposite of the one Dean had borne. Instead of blood-red, it was a deep black, like the void itself etched into his skin and echoing through his grace.
Dean nodded, but Castiel could see it was a gesture of relief, not agreement. Dean had never let anything go without a fight, not his brother, not his car. Castiel used to think he was the one exception to that rule, an implicit signal of how little esteem Dean held him in. But looking at Dean now, the way he let Castiel hold his face with no fear, the pleading and relief in his eyes, the grip he still had on Castiel, he had to wonder if maybe he’d been wrong all these years, to doubt.
Dean cut him off. “I know exactly what it was, okay? I know what you did, I even know what you want to do, the things you won’t tell me.” Dean shook him softly, uncaring of the blade Castiel still held to his throat. “I’ve been where you are, man. I know what that thing does to you.” Then, Dean moved his grip from Castiel’s coat and clenched his hand tightly over the Mark.
“I am, Dean,” Castiel insisted. “What I did tonight, it was–”
Castiel shrugged. “I don’t feel angry, if that’s what you mean.”
Castiel stared at him.
Castiel lurched away, the blade tugging free of Jody’s chest. She sucked in a wet breath and crumpled to the ground.
He’d sit himself down with a book at night, curled in the armchair of the Winchesters’ motel room, and only be able to focus on the words on the page for a few short minutes before his mind wandered to the last fight, or the one before that, or one from years ago. He would turn it over from every angle, relive the thrust of the blade in his hand as it punctured flesh, the sight of one of his siblings burning out before his eyes, and the Mark would twist inside him with glee. He would only escape it when Dean startled him from his thoughts by shaking his shoulder, the night having passed without him noticing.
“As well as can be expected when one binds God himself,” Castiel said dryly.
Of course, Jack had barely lived at all. His room was as good a place as any to go to when Castiel missed him.
He left the war room, silent behind him, and went where he always did when all he could feel was despair.
Sam spluttered a laugh. Dean snorted. “So you feel like shit, got it.” He shifted, using the arm still curved around Castiel’s shoulders to pull him closer. “C’mon, let's get you up.”
Containment was the only option. And there were few things that could completely and securely contain an angel. The Ma’lak box was necessary. Castiel was only being realistic.
Distantly, Castiel felt a warm palm on his face, an arm around his shoulders. He could vaguely feel another hand resting against his bicep and a familiar voice saying his name. They brought Castiel back to himself.
He took a deep breath, took one step forward, and was stopped by a hand grabbing his shoulder. Dean pulled him around and stared at him with such devastation he could hardly bear it.
He thought he’d made his escape successfully until he felt a hand grab his shoulder.
Castiel held him there, blade shaking slightly against his throat. “I need to go. I’ll hurt you. I’ll hurt Sam.”
But as time dragged on and the hunts continued, it became more and more annoying.
All he could do in the end was bring Dean close, kiss him again, and say, “I love you,” one last time.
As always, the Mark surged forward at the taste of anger. “Yes, I do,” Castiel snapped, biting back the vitriol of the Mark. Now was not the time, godammit. He wanted to say goodbye properly. “Dean, you’ve seen what I’ve done. I-I have no control.” He stared at Dean; Dean knew all this, intimately. He knew this was for the best, he just wasn’t letting himself see it right now. “I will burn the world before the end.”
Castiel suppressed a flash of anger, as he always seemed to need to do these days. “Yes.”
Castiel had an instant to feel accomplished before the Mark burning itself into him knocked him to his knees. It was a feeling unlike anything he’d ever felt before, something both absolutely foreign and absolutely divine, wrapped and warped into one. It was awful, in the truest sense of the word.
Castiel smiled, held his wrist. “Dean. No time with you has been a waste.”
“Listen, Cas, I have lost you too many goddamn times, okay?” he said, voice shaking. “I’m not adding another to the list. There has to be another way.”
When howling stopped and the beast was so much ash, Castiel looked to Dean. He was staring at Castiel, and the fear Castiel saw there cut through the anger, just a little. But then the next werewolf closed in and the anger swept back in, eclipsing everything else.
“A failsafe,” Castiel said. Dean stared at him and Castiel was unsurprised to see the spark of betrayal there.
Castiel took the seat across from him. “Do you mean–”
Dean shook his head, his hands coming forward to grip tight in Castiel’s coat. “No, you’re not. Don’t say that.”
When the three of them returned home, Castiel turned toward the Mal’ak box. Neither of the Winchesters interrupted him.
Castiel would like to pretend that he didn’t remember what happened next. But that would be a lie. He remembered making his way to the building, easing silently inside through a broken window. He remembered realizing he’d gotten the right house, the scent of corpses and the sound of rending flesh lingering in the air. He remembered discovering the first vetala, hunched over one of its victims and feasting. He remembered killing that monster, digging his blade into its heart and twisting, watching the sparks in its eyes as it died. And then he remembered leaning over the victim, gasping for life, covered in blood. He was young, a soul with a long life ahead of him, just back in town for the summer before his last year of college. He was slowly choking on his own blood and thinking that he was too young to die.
It went against everything that should have been possible. Of course, werewolves could have a familial structure–Garth was living proof of that. But these werewolves were wild, feral, with absolutely no control or memory of their actions on full moon nights. Co-existence shouldn’t have been possible, but here they were, slavering for the Winchesters’ blood, all the same.
It became a habit; Castiel lost track of the number of times he’d glance up and find Dean already watching him.
He quickly made his way to the garage; his truck was still sitting there, unused in all these past months they’d hunted together. It suddenly seemed like a safe harbour, one he desperately needed. He had to pause when he reached it, just to lay his palms against it and close his eyes and breathe.
Dean’s brows raised. “Alright, just checking.” But he watched Castiel for the rest of the night, eyes drifting to him constantly in the rear view mirror.
Dean swallowed heavily. He couldn’t look Castiel in the eye. “Yeah. I read you.”
Castiel deliberately met his eyes on one such glance and let his mouth curve into a small smile. Dean’s eyes crinkled with laugh lines seemingly automatically and he had to bite his lip to keep his own smile in. He aimed a sharp poke at Castiel’s side in retaliation.
Castiel enjoyed the next days at the bunker. He whiled away the hours, content in Sam and Dean’s company. Once, Dean roped him into baking a pie with him, watching eagle eyed as Castiel kneaded the dough. Another time, Sam and Castiel had an invigorating multi-hour discussion about the pronunciation of Enochian and the effects it had on spellwork. At some point, Dean sat beside him, passed out some beers, and good-naturedly called them nerds before settling in to listen. At night, while the Winchesters slept, Castiel sat in the library and methodically made his way through the Men of Letters’ collection.
Castiel put his hand over Dean’s. “I have to, Dean.”
Sam shrugged. “I don’t know, something. We’ll figure it out, we always do. Just don’t give up, okay, Cas?”
Castiel suppressed a burst of irritation. This hunt had been messy and he found the feeling of blood between his fingers disconcerting. “Yes, Dean. I think I would notice if the Mark suddenly disappeared.”
“How?” Castiel asked. “This was our plan. The only way we’d ever be free.” He glanced at Sam and Dean, held both their gazes. “There is no fixing this.”
At first, it was endearing, a sign of Dean’s silent care for him. He had only to meet Dean’s eyes to know that he was wanted here. Maybe not in the way Castiel ultimately desired, but that didn’t make it meaningless.
Castiel curled up tighter, closed his eyes, imagined Jack in front of him. He was grateful for his exacting memory now; it meant he could picture Jack perfectly, down to the last hair.
“You aren’t using this,” he said.
It came to a head after the werewolf hunt near Silver City, New Mexico.
“There’s nothing to talk about. We all knew something like this was a possibility,” Castiel said tonelessly.
Dean’s face crumpled. “I know I have, and I’m sorry. I regretted it every time, man, every time.” He looked away, over Castiel’s shoulder, for a moment, seemingly lost. Then he took a breath and met Castiel’s eyes directly. “This is your home, this is where you belong.” He let go of the Mark, slid his hand up Castiel’s arm to grab his shoulder. “Don’t leave. Don’t you give up on me.”
“Not yet,” Castiel agreed. He turned back to the box and waited for them to leave.
Dean shook his head, looking back at Castiel’s face with that familiar earnest expression, the one he wore when he was most desperate to be understood. “That’s not–I know you are, Cas. I’m saying you shouldn’t have had to.”
I leave the room closing it, and start running.
For 30 minutes I keep running, I enter again in silence I carefully climb the stairs I see Jack continue to sleep.
I look at my and Dean's initials on the back of impala.
"You should have told me." He speaks but I keep looking at him.
But I keep quiet, I know he's angry but I know what I have to do to calm him down.
I have to get there, take Jack, and disappear from town ASAP before the police find us.
Sony opens the door, the man walks in.
Peanut butter and bread. The policeman answered.
I fall to my knees on the pavement of the road, at this moment I want any car to pass and run over me.
I'm a hunter, Dean. I have to find who killed mom. He smiled crying.
D.W S.W.
-For the same reason that Jack did not lose hope every night, day, his birthday parties, when he won his basketball tournaments, because Sam loves you and maybe I will leave but I love you, and I know you can leave everything from being a hunter back, it's all over Sam.- Dean tries to get closer, but I take a step back.
Dean has left me, he abandoned me.
"Why?" The question surprises us both.
The two brothers couldn't believe that, they couldn't let their brother.
The damn police siren sounds behind my back, but I keep running, I get between the streets and home trying to lose them but it is more difficult than I imagined.
What did I take? The man in the glasses and the ponytail spoke to the policeman while he was sitting with the handcuffs.
Such for which. The policeman says as he approaches me to remove the handcuffs.
He looked everywhere, and no one follows me.
The man changed too much, with more scars on his body and more pain inside him, but he was able to defeat John Winchester.
It's Jack, my brother. Dean is surprised and looks at me blankly.
Who is the boy? The officer asks, slowly approaching.
Dean abandoned me.
I let sleep consume me wondering what my next steps would be.
It is not true. I speak and it was true, I could endure a long time without eating, I have gotten used to it but not my little brother.
Very well. I hear how he takes off his belt and the blows come I try to keep a serious look but it hurts.
I try to avoid crowded places, Jack has fallen asleep.
Jack, it's me. I speak playing twice in a row, I allow 10 seconds to pass to play three times, it is our key to know that it is us.
Nice try but you know very well what I want but calm, it will be after everything you have said. He he leaves and I know I have to start with all that before dawn I have to be prepared.
-Yes, of course, old news, you arrived 5 years late, where that scared and fearful child left And it was thanks to you! , John trained me stronger than you, more skilled, resistant to pain and you know? He didn't even leave me money to take care of Jack, I. -I pointed in front of his face.-I did it for him, I worked and took care of him, ME! WHERE THE FUCK WERE DEAN !? - Suddenly my Tears are falling. "Where were you when I need you?" I whisper turning around to meet Jack's gaze.
Well, what about his family? I clench my jaw, I have to go before Dad comes with him, don't let the same thing happen to him.
I know very well that John is going to look for me, he may lose Dean and Jack but he needs me to get revenge for the damned one who killed mom.
And Jack Winchester is finishing his studies at MIT University where he studies medicine.
No. Jack, it's not your fault. I approach him. None of this is your fault. His tears break me, I have to make him live happy, I was glad. May he smile and live longer than me. Dean. He whispered making a decision.
Dean Winchester married Castiel Novak and they adopted a small boy named Sam Jr. Winchester Novak.
They had both come a long way.
I get to the door of the room where Jack is.
I allow myself to be consumed by the darkness.
Jack falls asleep completely but I'm still awake.
-Quiet Sam- I don't understand why he told me that until I can feel like I'm panicking.
I keep walking down the road, when I see the cop who had caught me on his patrol, shit.
I need to run away, I need to get to my brother before dad.
This is Dean Winchester. Jack looks at me without understanding.
He smiles.
And John? Jack asks and I see Dean furrow his brow in doubt.
I can never hear from him again and I missed him every day, and Dean tells him the story and anecdotes of little Sam.
But I don't have time, I give him a big blow in the face causing him to go back and I run towards the road, I run and I do not stop running.
They refused to think that he was dead, he is alive.
The Winchesters were hunters but also people with a life ahead of them.
And Sam? Jack asked looking at the men, thinking the worst.
Castiel an innocent and weird but great man
I get up leaving my bed made, although this here should not be messy.
