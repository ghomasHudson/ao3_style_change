"Don't lie to me, Dean. I'm not stupid." Cas hisses, and Dean trembles, reaching around to pull Cas towards him. Cas gives in, releasing his harsh grip on Dean and wrapping his arms around the brunette's middle. Dean shakes in Cas' arms, digging his face into the angel's shoulder and allowing himself to finally weep. His sobs are long, ugly and wet and drawn out, and he holds onto Cas for dear life.
"—You don't seem very dead to me."
The two lock eyes.
Cas has to fight the urge to purr in Dean's presence. The whole situation feels so out of his control, and any ounce of self-preservation he has left leaves him as he reaches up to kiss Dean. The man softens immediately in Cas' arms, and he dips down, pulling the angel impossibly closer as their lips brush tenderly against each other.
“Yes, I am.” Dean replied quickly, nodding earnestly. He didn’t want to be kicked out of somewhere that he felt at home, at least, not again.
Abaddon shook her head before she asked, “And you, Sister Sophia?”
Castiel sighed before he walked off and looked back at Dean. “Oh, yes you are, Captain--” Dean chuckled a little when Cas said that. Castiel pursed his lips before correcting himself, “Sir. Now, you will pack your things this minute and return to the abbey.” Dean blinked at Cas and huffed.
Dean hummed for a moment before he looked at the window Krissy climbed up to get to. “How in the hell did you climb up here?” He asked as he looked out the window. For a nun, he had quite the potty mouth on him.
“That’s the Klopmann Monastery Choir.” Castiel said to Gabe as the choir continued to sing.
“Birthday presents!”
Reverend Mother thinned her lips as she looked at him. “But are you truly ready for it?” She inquired, cocking an eyebrow.
Abaddon cocked her eyebrow then nodded, “Then say it, Sister Kelly.”
“How do you keep a wave upon the sand?” Mother Abaddon said as she looked at Sister April, shaking her head back at her.
She chuckled as she started to leave, “Goodnight, now.”
Dean snorted and rolled her eyes, “I’d say, you could find out yourself.” That made the children laugh a little. The captain nodded and as he went to walk away, Dean looked at the whistle and blew into it, making him stop. “Excuse me, sir, I don’t know your signal.” He said smugly.
Rolfe leaned away again, Krissy almost falling before he caught her. She looked up at Rolfe with a gentle smile before the boy kissed her passionately for just a moment, setting her on the ground before he ran away with his bike.
Castiel looked up at him with mild adoration in his eyes. “You brought music back into the house. I’d forgotten.” How great it sounded from how good it felt to listen to it.
“Let’s start at the very beginning. A very good place to start.” Dean sang softly as he started to strum notes on the guitar. He learned at a young age to sing and play instruments like the guitar. So, he very quickly knew that his voice would go with it. “When you read you being with-”
“Snakes!” Kurt teased, throwing a pillow at his sisters.
“I’m Jack, I’m fourteen. I’m impossible.” He said, again very confidently as if that was a good thing.
“I shouldn’t be saying this -- not to you,” Frau said as if it was a secret that she needed to keep to herself. This should be good then. “I mean, I don’t know you that well,” I am very charming, thank you. “But if you ask me, the Captain’s thinking very seriously of marrying the man before the summer’s over.” Wait…. The Captain likes women and men? Did not see that coming….
“Oh, I’m sorry sir but I am not whistling for them.” Dean told him, shaking his head. Children didn’t need whistles like dogs, they needed to be loved and to feel like they were by their family. “I’ll use their names, after all they are such lovely names.”
“Re.” Dean sang, stepping up the stairs slowly.
“You act like they’re not even your children! So, you’ve got to hear it from someone. You’re never home long enough--” Dean started. He wanted to help these kids and if it started with knocking some sense into the idiot of a father they have, then so be it.
“I always try to keep faith in my doubts, Sister April.” The Reverend Mother said as they walked through the square.
Novak said again, a bit firmer. “Turn.” Dean twirled slowly, confused. He shook his head as his eyes scanned Dean’s form. “It’s the clothes. You’ll have to put on different ones before you can meet the children.”
Rolfe gently set a hand on her shoulder this time, Krissy smiling as she walked back to the bench. Thunder crackled as did a bit of lightning. They sat down at the bench before Rolfe noticed it was starting to rain. He took Krissy’s hand and dragged her inside the bungalow, the rain really picked up by the time they got inside, a thunderstorm most likely.
The Captain sighed as he looked at his youngest child. “I’m not sure, Gretl, not sure.”
They answered back, almost sad he didn’t sit down on it. “Good evening, Mr. Winchester.” Then they all started to eat their food, quietly. Dean didn’t like quiet, maybe that was why he sang in the abbey all the time.
Mick looked out at the lake. “This really is exciting for me, Castiel, being here with you.” He sighed amorously, looking at Cas.
He mentally curses himself, shutting his eyes. Maybe if he hadn't been so stupid. Dean is good at his job, and if he'd gotten himself hurt on a doozy case like this one, it's because he hadn't been able to fully buy in. It's no secret that he's been wanting to quit. If only he'd just let Billie take him. He would have died for something, anything. Maybe she would have spared Cas, too.
"Yeah, whatever." He says, and it's honest. He hadn't exactly despised being carried to his room.
"Dean-"
"Yeah, I know it's not. Have a sense of humor, will you- hey! No, you are not putting me in my damn bed!" Dean shrieks, but it's no use, because Cas has the upper hand right now and he's already lowering Dean onto his mattress.
"Meg?" He breathes out, eyes darting around space only to be met with absolutely nothing. Cas is here?
"What did he say?"
He pushes the needle through Dean's skin, careful as to not break through too slow or
"I wanted to die," Dean gasps out, wilting in Cas' arms, and the angel holds him tighter still. "I wanted to die, because I wanted— I wanted there to be nothing after, Cas, I just wanted everything to be over."
He's on the verge of tears, it's obvious. Unheard sobs shake around at the pit of his throat, turning his tone scratchy and deep. Sam looks at him through furrowed brows, a deep frown planted across his lips.
The barn begins to rumble, and poor Dean can't decide if he's hallucinating or not. He closes his eyes, thinking, this must be it. But something walks into the barn and lifts him up into it's arms and it's so familiar, something Dean feels he's always known, but he just can't put his finger on it.
Cas sighs in smitten content, running his hand through the back of Dean's hair. Dean hums, his voice rolling high in his throat, and he presses a soft kiss just above Cas' adam's apple.
"Look, it's not your fault." Sam says after a minute, looking over to meet his brother's eyes. "He did it for you. It was his decision, Dean. You know that he wouldn't want you to go around blaming it on yourself."
Dean is rendered speechless. He offers up only a small shake of his head before shuffling around the Impala and curling himself into the passenger seat. When Sam lowers himself into the car alongside him, Dean tosses over his keys, leaning against the window.
Jack has said his goodbyes. He's leaving the boys, for now, spreading his own wings. He says he needs to work things out on his own for a minute. Sam and Dean watch side by side as he moves to walk away, to leave them for- well, Jack knows how long.
"God, I know. You better find a way to bounce out, pretty boy, because he's not leaving and I don't like little teeny bugs like you prancing around my playground." It says. Dean opens his mouth to speak, the words forming in his throat, but they cease to exist when The Empty jerks up. "Great, now he knows that you're here."
They trudge back to the Impala, loss weighing down on their shoulders as they get closer and closer. This is it, they should be happy. They beat Chuck, everything is back to normal- son becoming God aside.
He looks up at the ceiling, watching the cracks along the bunker walls to meld together as he allows his eyes to unfocus. The pills don't take very long to take effect, but they do take long enough to draw the whole thing out. He's shaking like a mad-man, the bashing pain in his head alone enough to pierce through the veil itself. He can practically feel the chemicals burning through his stomach line, and he's scared, he doesn't want to do this all alone, but it's for Cas, it's always been for Cas.
"Killing you won't put everyone to sleep, but maybe it will finally shut your stupid boyfriend
With trouble, Dean lifts himself from his chair, stumbling towards Cas and throwing his arms around the angel. Cas' name leaves Dean's lips, and he doesn't even notice, doesn't even care. Cas is here, he's here and alive and Dean is in love with him, Dean got him back.
"Good luck, Dean. You can do this, I know you can," Sam says, but it's more of a gesture towards himself rather than Dean, who pops the lid from the bottle of pills with ease.
The Empty doesn't reply, but it's grip on his throat releases. He inhales deeply, doing his best to choke down an impending coughing fit.
“How many clothes does a governess like you need?” Frau asked him, cocking her eyebrow as a window banged against it’s hinges.
Now they were going through a tunnel with vines and roses all along the outside, the sun peeking through. “Me, a name I call myself.” Dean was having fun, himself. This is probably the most fun he’s had since he joined the abbey. “Far, a long, long way to run.” They now ran through the tunnel, laughing happily.
“A clown.” Sister April said again, leaning over to Abaddon before the Mother put her hands up to make them stop.
Kelly shook her head before she looked over at Sister Jessica, “Have you tried the barn? You know how much he adores the animals there.” She tried, gentleness in her voice. Which is completely different from the hatred Sister April feels for Dean.
“Oh, they’re alright, Captain, they’re just happy.” Dean said as he ate, shrugging. And those words just made them cry harder.
Kurt and Jack jumped to the top stairs, Krissy and Claire jumping to the bottom one. Dean stepped up one as they sang. “So Do.”
Dean’s eyes widened, “Oh…..” He sighed and shrugged, “At least the children will have two parents again. That’d be wonderful for them.” He smiled.
And that Captain, he didn’t even know what he looked like. Gay people around this time were common, but he was still a little ashamed. He kept it a secret cause he felt the abbey wasn’t ready for a gay nun, let alone a gay male nun.
He did the sign of the cross as he kneeled down, clasping his hands together. “Dear Father, now I know why you’ve sent me here.” He smiled, closing his eyes as well. “To help these children prepare themselves for a new father and I pray this will become a happy family in thy sight. God bless the Captain. God bless Krissy and Jack. God bless Claire, Brigitta, Marta, and little Gretl.” Dean prayed softly, taking a small breath. He felt he was forgetting someone.
Now they were on a carriage, wearing another set of clothes. Dean was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and high-waisted brown pants, basically casual-wear for the times. “Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti.” Different children sang.
“A flipity-jippit?”
“Don’t you think you’ll get tired of it, Claire?” Dean said back, licking his lips as he ate an orange. Maybe they could do other things though, more fun things. He’d have to think though, he wasn’t allowed to have too much fun at the abbey, the mountains being the best thing he was able to do….
“Fraulein Josephine, four governesses ago.” Jack answered. Dean chuckled, they must love to play with their governesses, bad ways probably.
Castiel joked softly, “Well, I’m a dangerous driver.” That made Mick laugh softly. Castiel wrapped an arm around Mick as he began to walk a little bit.
Now they were all riding bikes, little Gretl fit on Dean’s bike so she was gripping onto him. “Doe.”
“He’s always late for chapel.” Sister Agatha said.
“More or less, yes.” Mick laughed a little, leaning into Castiel more as they walked.
“Marta.” One of the youngest girls said.
“A deer, a female deer.” The kids sang with a smile as they rode their bikes on a trail by the main lake by their town. “Ray, a drop of golden sun.” Dean hummed as he listened to the children. They were actually very good at singing. “Me. A name I call myself.” Kurt and Jack rode their bikes to be in front of the girls. “Far. A long, long way to run.”
He waved at the bus, a big smile on his face still. “I have confidence the world can all be mine! They’ll have to agree I have confidence in me!” For a moment, the man looked around before he walked to the house he needed to be. As Dean walked down the path, he skipped happily. “I have confidence in sunshine! I have confidence in rain!” Dean clicked his heels together. “I have confidence that spring will come again! Besides which you see! I have confidence in me!”
“Oh, and why not?” Dean asked, fiddling with his sleeve nervously.
“When his wife died, she left him with terrible heartache.” Mick sounded sad for him. Castiel didn’t deserve that but he wouldn’t be able to stop that anyways.
“Well, no one’s supposed to know he’s here.” Rolfe told her, sitting next to Krissy again. “Don’t tell your father now.”
“I’d like to thank you children for the precious gift I received in my pocket today.” Dean smiled as he ate. The children looked at him then back at their father.
“Never eat your soup quietly.” Krissy said too.
Then they passed a row of trees that had children climbing up into them. They laughed as they did. “Good heavens, what’s this?” Mick asked as he looked up at the kids.
“You know I have no political convictions. Can I help it if other people do?” Gabriel shrugged, cocking his eyebrow at Castiel.
The two boys out of the seven children ran in, Dean chuckling a little as they tried to look ‘manly’ and brave. “Uh, you boys weren’t scared too, were you?” He asked teasingly, some of the girls giggling.
“I made them. From the curtains that used to hang in my bedroom.” Dean admitted proudly. Obviously, the Captain didn’t like them but Dean was quite proud of how the clothes turned out.
“Oh fuck....” Dean mumbled under his breath as he walked closer to the gates. He’s never really seen such a grand place like that before but what else could he expect with a Captain who has seven children. He sighed as he opened the gate and walked the driveway to the front door. “I have confidence in confidence alone....” Dean sang softly as he walked.
Dean chuckled and poked Gretl. “Oh no? Look.” He told her. “Alright, everybody. Up here on the bed.” He got in first, setting Gretl next to him.
“You are sixteen, going on seventeen. Fellows will fall in line.” Rolfe stood in front of Krissy now, giving her a gentle smile. “Eager young lads and roues and cads,” He set a foot up on the bench next to her. “Will offer you food and wine. Totally unprepared are you to face a world of man.” He walked to stand behind Krissy now.
"Better?" Cas asks, and Dean rolls his eyes.
"Look me in the eyes and tell me you don't want to die, Dean." Cas says, his harsh voice toned with an underlying softness that makes Dean even more guilty, so he doesn't say anything. He just stares at Cas, mouth pressed into a frown and eyes wide, because who is he to lie to Cas? "That's what I thought." Most of the anger has left Cas' tone now, and he tenderly releases the fabric of Dean's shirt.
Is he dead?
A loud yap emerges from somewhere in the bunker. One yip, then two and then three and then suddenly bursts into a whole fit of assorted barking noises.
"Thanks, Jack." Sam says, offering up a little wave as Jack turns for the second time and vanishes in thin air.
"No way. No way in hell." Dean says, staring up at the cartoonishly large needle in Sam's hand with wide eyes. Except he's already strapped down into the chair, and he's already agreed to this. Not even the thought of that needle lodged into his neck can really change his mind, because all of his thoughts are occupied by Cas.
But everything in the bunker reminds him of Cas. Not even just watching him die in the dungeon. All of the nights spent on aimless conversation, all their useless squabbles- the entire building is flooded with memories of Cas.
"Don't leave me," Dean whispers against Cas' skin, ghosting his hand across Cas' jawline. Cas shakes his head, leaning into Dean's touch.
"Alright, stand up on three," Sam mumbles, blowing a strand of hair out of his face. "One, two- yeah, there we go." Dean heavily groans, letting Sam lead them through the halls.
The Empty is gone. Well, everything's gone, everything that nothing is, at least. Dean's eyes shoot open, and he gasps for air, looking around. He's back in the bunker, strapped down in the chair just as he had been before.
"I didn't try to kill myself, Cas—" He tries, but Cas sees through him, of course he does.
Cas doesn't speak for a long time. He remains standing there, Dean in his arms, fingers trailing over the nape of the Dean's neck. He admires the warmth that radiates off of the beauty that is Dean Winchester as the human's sobs begin to ring silent.
"It's okay, I know you're afraid. I know you're afraid, but I'm not going to let you die." A voice says, and Dean wants to protest. He's not afraid, of course he's not afraid, he's been welcoming death almost all of his life. Except, to say that would be a very big lie.
"I can't." Jack says simply. "I've tried. I've called out to him, but he- I haven't gotten any luck." Jack exhales a bit, eyes softening in a manner of sympathy. "I'm sorry."
Cas paces. It's all he's been able to do. He walks back and forth and back and forth and then over again.
"No, Sam, you don't. You don't get it." Dean says, lip quivering as he speaks. He trembles against the Impala, knees threatening to buckle under his weight. "He told me something, before he- before he went. And,
Krissy smiled again and looked at him eagerly, “You have? How much?” She looked at him admirably.
Castiel rolled his eyes, he hated that nickname, and absolutely loathed his brother’s jokes. “Unless the jokes improve, Gabe, I’m leaving you in the middle of nowhere.” Castiel told him.
“As a matter of fact, yes, Claire.” The Captain answered.
“Sir, did I not tell you that bedtime is to be strictly observed in this house?” The Captain asked sternly, his eyes not changing in silent anger towards him.
Claire stepped closer to Dean and smiled, a mischievous glint in her eyes that wasn’t there before. “Well, the best way to start is to be sure to tell father to mind his own business.” The other children started to surround him. Dean’s eyes widened, this looked creepy.
“You have already. More than you know….” Castiel whispered to Dean.
“Then you must learn.” Dean told them, tuning his guitar still.
“How do you hold a moon beam in your hand?” Reverend Mother sang, sighing. Dean was a lot of work but she loved him and wanted him to stay.
The boy nodded and walked to sit down in front of The Mother’s desk, sitting down nervously. A million things were going through his mind all at once and he didn’t know how to stop it. “Reverend Mother, I’m so sorry! I just couldn’t help myself. The gates were open and the hills were beckoning, and before I-”
“What is the matter, Marta?” Novak asked his daughter and Dean wasn’t even sure if he cared. It definitely looked as if he didn’t.
“Make that an uneven three.” Gabriel said as he grabbed another one and put it on his plate. The maid chuckled again and nodded before she left to put the tray away. Castiel and Mick stepped up onto the stone porch with Gabriel.
“What? Is it your father?” Dean asked before he turned to look at Castiel. “Oh, Captain, you’re home…” He said unenthusiastically. Dean didn’t really like Castiel, but he knew the children absolutely loved him. Since they were all standing up on the boat, it started rocking back and forth to the point all of them fell off.
Dean chuckled as he told him. “The poor didn’t want these.” He realized how funny that must sound. That even the poor didn’t want his clothes. Novak hummed and looked at Dean again, his eyes scanning his form. “Well, I would have made myself new clothes, but there wasn’t time. I can make my own clothes.” Dean smiled and nodded at him.
Rolfe sighed and got up from the stone bench. “Well, let’s see.” He thought before he looked back at Krissy. “I could come here by mistake,” He suggested. “With a telegram for Colonel Schneider.” Rolfe smiled as he went on, “He’s here from Berlin, staying with-” He cut himself off, he couldn’t tell Krissy, not now anyways.
“Ti.” Dean set his hands on his hips, looking proud of the children.
Dean rolled his eyes at himself as he walked through the city, admiring the sites. “If I don’t, I just know I’ll turn back. I must dream of the things I am seeking. I am seeking the courage I lack.” He admitted softly, shaking his head at himself again. “The courage to serve them with reliance....” Dean looked up at the big fountain in front of him, walking around it. It was amazing if he was honest, but he had no time to think about it at the moment.
“How long will you be gone this time, father?” Gretl asked her father with a small frown.
“If I could just get some material-” Dean pleaded softly. He didn’t really have any money to buy anything for himself or for the children.
All the children got up, out of the lake, they all laughed and talked at once. The Captain grabbed his whistle from his pocket and blew it, the children immediately getting into their line. “Straight line!” Cas snarled, the kids stiffening.
“There you go, running yourself down again.” Mick shook his head before he looked up at the mountains again, sighing. He hated hearing whenever Castiel was mad or sad with himself. He was pretty exciting to him.
The first girl went first, “I’m Kristen, but a lot of people call me Krissy. I’m sixteen years old and I don’t need a governess.” She said confidently.
“Don’t you like children, Dean?” Reverend Mother asked him, cocking an eyebrow.
Dean was waiting outside the Reverend Mother’s office, looking around. He was in his nun uniform but instead, he was wearing black trousers than the usual skirts the sisters wore. The door opened for him and he saw Sister Kelly, one of his favorites out of all the nuns there. She was so nice.
Oh, well, that changes things a bit for Dean. See, he’s had this secret that only his bestest of friends know.  “His wife died seven years ago, leaving him alone with the children and I understand he’s had a most difficult time keeping a governess there.” She explained more to him.
“Cordially?” Krissy pouted, turning away from the mail boy.
“La So. Mi Fa.”
He looked up at the abbey as he heard the sisters singing again, Dean was saddened to need to leave them for this quest. But he was so excited to see what it’d be like in the world. “When the Lord closes a door, somewhere he opens a window.” He whispered to himself, almost in reassurance.
“He’s leaving for Vienna in the morning.” Frau reminded him gently. Oh shit! Well, when would he be able to get material for their clothes?
“Play clothes.” Dean finished for the Captain.
The children immediately went to line up, stiffer than they were just a few moments ago. Dean sighed as he looked at them then back at the Captain. “Uh, hello…”
“To visit Baron Davies again?” Claire asked her father with a disapproving voice. Dean cocked an eyebrow at that. Baron? That would be a man’s name, right? Why would the Captain visit him?
Then Dean heard stomping on the wood. “Ah, yes, little Gretl.” He smiled and looked at her. The little girl held up her hand, all five fingers up. “Oh, you must be five years old then?” She nodded at him. “My, you’re practically a lady already.” Gretl giggled softly and smiled at him.
Krissy let go of Rolfe and put her hands on his shoulders. “Dear Rolfe. Stop. Don’t stop!” She smiled, hugging the boy again happily. “Your Krissy.” She sighed and looked at Rolfe. “If only we didn’t always have to wait for someone to send my Father a telegram. How do I know when I’ll see you again?” Krissy frowned and took Rolfe’s hands tightly. She was a bit sad that this was the only way she was really able to see him.
And then he- he and whatever has him in it's grip- are somewhere different, somewhere much brighter, and has Dean been yanked to heaven? No, he hasn't, he's still alive. Just barely alive.
Cas, who had practically killed himself, just for Dean. All to make sure Dean made it out of there alive, and what does it add up to? Dean dying to a damn piece of metal sticking out of a wall.
"What did you do to get into the empty?" Cas asks after a minute, and Dean feels like he's been punched in the gut. He doesn't let go of Cas, though, because he's too sick to hold his own weight. He knows that Cas probably senses this. If not, he can most certainly feel Dean jittering, leaning on the angel for support, and this is probably why he had asked.
"Enough?" Dean asks, neglecting to open his eyes. He's completely and utterly exhausted.
Dean nods.
He hates the fact that Dean could, in fact, be dead. He hates the way that if anything does go wrong, if Chuck decides to pull the plug, there's no way that he'd know. Other than The Empty, of course- and even still, Cas has no reason to trust what it says.
There's a blinding light and a shrill screech in his ears, it calls to him, curses him and tosses him this way and that, except he's not moving, he's tied up to the chair, so how could he possibly be moving?
"Yeah, Dean, listen. I know that it's Cas, okay, I get it. But you seem really torn up about it."
"No, no, just- just give me a minute." He says, shuddering heavily. He stays there for a minute, trying to process all that had happened.
"What?" Cas asks, eyes narrowing in confusion, and Dean only shakes his head, grinning.
"Okay, I'm- I'm good." Dean whispers under his breath, "give me a hand, will you?" Sam quickly nods, letting Dean wrap an arm around his shoulder.
"But you had Sam," Cas finally says, brows furrowed in distraught. "You had Charlie, and Bobby, and Eileen. I don't understand."
"Don't make this weird." Dean says, and Cas nods. He lowers himself to sit at the ends of Dean's bed. "Cas, the friggin' dog sleeps there. Come on, really." Dean wraps his arms around Cas' shoulders, laying back and allowing Cas to rest his head on Dean's chest.
"I hate you so much right now." Dean mumbles, crossing his arms.
Dean falters.
"What's the matter, little dude?" Dean asks, reaching down to run a hand through Miracle's fur.
And oh, what a grand gesture it is. Affection seeps through Dean's skin and wraps itself around Cas in a warm embrace, throwing him further and further into the abyss that is Dean. And god, Cas welcomes it. He'll have it all, he'll lose it all- he'll give it all, just for Dean.
Dean knows, of course he knows, but he doesn't want to look up. He doesn't want to be disappointed, doesn't want to see if it's real. But Miracle is still bouncing around the kitchen, tumbling this way and that, and Dean has to look up, because it's Cas.
"I found it. I have to keep going, are you really sure about this?" Sam asks, voice crackling, because he remembers how it feels to have that same needle shoved through his skin and he hates putting his brother through the same grueling pain.
"See you on the flip-side, little brother." Dean says, sticking Sam a thumbs-up and swallowing all the pills down dry. Sam huffs a laugh, taking both of the bottles from Dean's hand before strapping him back down into the chair for safe measure.
"The angel stays." The Empty says, voice low in a frustrated growl.
Sam frowns.
"Sorry, bucko, I'm not your little demon pal." Meg- no, not Meg- says, tapping it's fingernails against it's chin. "How did you get here?"
"I'm going to go out and take Miracle for a walk, yeah?" Sam says, nervously swallowing and giving the angel in the kitchen a nice pat on the shoulder. "It's great to see you, Cas."
"You see, Dean," The Empty says, taking a step towards him. "when your little time bomb popped in and decided to explode, he woke everyone up. Do you know how annoying it is to have everyone awake? I need my beauty sleep, boy."
Dean chokes on the complete absurdity of this, slamming his hand down on the table and leaning forward to recover.
The warmth reaches around his wound, suddenly becoming burning hot. Dean grimaces, fingernails digging into palms, and wait, he can move his hands again? He twitches an arm, then a leg, and then his eyes and his nose and his mouth. The burning sensation finally seems to subside, and he realizes- he doesn't feel the pain, not anymore. Is he dead? Has the thing killed him?
Dean pushes out a breathless cough, shooting a glob of spit in The Empty's direction. It lands at it's feet, and it doesn't seem very amused. The grip on Dean's throat tightens, and he doubles over, falling onto his knees.
"How did you two manage to get a dog?" A voice asks.
Sam scoffs, shaking his head.
With no warning, Cas lifts Dean from the ground, scooping him up in his arms and beginning to carry him in the direction of his room.
He hadn't been able to save Cas. The whole thing had been completely pointless.
And Dean breaks out into tears, because god, he misses Cas. He misses Cas' voice, and his eyes, and the way he highlights situations with shit vocabulary. Cas pulls him back into a hug, holding Dean as he sobs.
"Dean, it's about Cas." Sam says, and it's all he has to say, because Dean is already twisting the lock and turning the knob to open the door. Miracle bounces out of the room with a yap of excitement, running a circle around Sam's ankles and then prancing further into the bunker.
"Pretty much." Sam says, a smile ghosting over his lips. It fades when he turns to look at his brother. "Listen, Dean, I get it if you don't want to do this. I know you don't exactly have a good history with the whole angelic possession thing, so-"
"Alright, then. I'll going to go and wait for Sam
There hadn't really been a specific waking moment as there had been the first time. One second he was standing in the bunker with Dean, the next he'd been standing in the middle of- well, the middle of nowhere. Quite literally. Something is wrong, something is obviously wrong, as he shouldn't be awake in the first place. The Empty obviously hadn't taken very much interest in his arrival, other than taking it's claim on him in an obvious moment of pure pettiness.
He doesn't really want to live, anyways.
"Can't you, I don't know, do something about Cas?" He asks, words toppling out like jello from a carton. "I mean, Chuck brought Lucifer back from the empty, right?"
"I didn't give up," Dean barks back, folding his arms in front of his chest. Cas raises his brows, disbelieving, and Dean glances up and then back down, releasing a breath. "I tried, Cas. I tried. I got a dog, I applied for a job, and it just— it didn't work out."
"You don't get to make excuses." Cas finally says, expression softening. Dean subconsciously leans closer to him, wanting. It isn't lust, he doesn't crave Cas in a sexual sense. He wants affection. He wants Cas' fingers through his hair and his arms around his neck. He wants Cas to hold him, he wants to hear his heartbeat and think god, he's alive, because it feels like he's been gone for centuries and Dean doesn't even have it in him to wonder how he's back, standing in front of him at full power. Reluctantly, he pulls his attention back to the situation at hand. "You don't have to make excuses, just tell me the truth. Why did you give up?"
Dean laughs. It's a sweet, bright laugh, and he looks up at Cas with a wide smile.
"I so happen to be one of God's, y'know, father figures," He says, playing a smile on his lips. "and we aren't playing by Chuck's rules anymore, sweetheart. So go ahead and kill me, but-" He chokes out a laugh, "he'll probably be royally pissed. Sure, you can have me, but you can also kiss a wink of sleep bye-bye for all hell of eternity."
Still, Dean thinks, does he not want to see me? Is he angry that I got him out? Does he want to go back?
He's here, and he knows that Dean loves him. In the end, that's all that really matters, isn't it?
"But I didn't have you." Dean whispers, a wobbly smile forming gently on his lips as his freckles begin to swim in his tears. "I didn't have you, Cas."
"Do not get snarky with me right now, Dean," Cas growls. "I died so that you could live, and the first thing you do is go and get yourself practically slaughtered—"
So, Cas paces. He doesn't think about stopping, because he's not ready to go to sleep. Not yet.
"Cas," Dean breathes against the angel's lips, staring up into the blue of his eyes. Cas stares back. "I love you, too." Emotion tugs at Dean's throat, piling up at the bottom of his gut. He can hardly breathe, he's so hell bent on Cas. It's exhilarating, and it's scary. He's lost Cas so many times, too many to count, and now— now, he doesn't think he'll be able survive it again. He chokes up on more unshed tears, breath hitching on panic, and he dips downs to press his face against Cas' neck.
"Dean, no." He pauses, glancing back at Dean's room. Clothes and beer bottles are scattered lazily across the ground. "I decided to do some, uh, light reading? And- I think really I found a way to get him back."
Still, being completely alone with himself after what had happened in the bunker is no ball game.
too fast. Sharp, cold pain explodes where the needle rests in Dean's neck, shooting a terrible ache all throughout his body. He gasps for breath, eyes squeezed tight, nails digging into palms, but he doesn't scream. Screaming would only make things difficult for the both of them. Sam slowly begins to pull the base of the plunger back, digging the needle slightly further into Dean's skin.
The bunker is empty without Jack wandering around in search of something to do. It's empty without Cas pacing aimlessly through the library, fingertips grazing against the old spines of every book on each shelf. It's empty without some big bad screaming down in the dungeon.
"Doesn't matter," Dean says, voice cracking under emotion, "I got you back, Cas."
"Dean, hey, I'll go and get you a glass of water-" Sam quickly says, but Dean only shakes his head, holding his hand up in protest.
Everything else can wait. Feeding the dog, Sam could do that. Feeding himself, Dean couldn't care less, but Cas will probably make him eat something later on. For now, it's just the two of them. Dean is with Cas, and that's all that could ever matter to him, at least in the moment. After days of calling out in the middle of the night and prayers that fall over deaf ears, Cas is actually here.
"Dean. Dean," Sam calls from the other side of the door. "Come on, Dean, we have to talk about something."
"Yeah? What leverage?" It asks, a cold laugh emerging from somewhere in it's chest. It takes another step towards him, reaching down to yank at his hair. He flinches back in pain, scoffing up at her.
"Winchester? What are you doing here?" A voice asks. Dean snaps into awareness, eyeing the figure in front of him.
Dean shuts his eyes, risking a shaky inhale. This is it, his big secret is out. The blunt foundation that had kept him going for years and years, unbeknownst to anybody else. Dean loves Cas.
"No, Sam, he didn't explode," Dean says, voice cracking under thick emotion. "It wasn't- okay, no. It was bad, but he didn't seem to be suffering through it or anything."
"That's not what you said five minutes ago." Cas mutters, and Dean looks up at him, frowning.
"No. No, Sam, I'm not okay. It's Cas." Dean grumbles, afraid to say anything more, because if he does he knows he's going to break out into tears. No chick flick moments.
"Yes, I'm sure," Dean growls through clenched teeth, "just do it, I don't care."
"Cas, where's Cas?" Dean asks, looking up at Sam expectantly.
He pauses, a soft sigh escaping his lips. "Was it, y'know, bad? Did he explode or something?"
"Hey, no. Sam can wait, come on," Dean mutters, hoping Cas will understand, and Cas swallows.
"Where would we even get the grace?" Dean asks, choosing to ignore Sam's words.
"No." He says, plain as day, and Dean feels his face grow red.
Dean jolts up, searching the room for the source of the voice, and his eyes are met immediately with those of Castiel's. He's standing along the corner of Dean's room, arms crossed, and if he didn't look like he was about to kill Dean all over again, he would find it kind of attractive.
"So... I have to die?" Dean asks, posing the question like it's one of the most normal things in the world. To be fair, it kind of is. He cocks an eyebrow as Sam grabs hold of a book on the table, skimming through the pages and slamming it back down onto the surface.
"He told me that," Dean glares up at the sky, trying to contain his impending emotions as he talks. It's damn near impossible. "he told me that I changed him. He told me that he loved me, Sam, and I-" He takes a breath. "And I never got to tell him that I love him, too. And he's dead, and it's my fault. It's my fault."
By the time there's enough grace in the syringe, pain driven tears are pooling down onto Dean's cheeks. They splotch up over his dusted freckles, practically burning into his skin as his head pounds in protest, but he still doesn't scream. Finally, finally, Sam yanks the needle out of Dean, leaving the man panting for air and tilting his head back in sheer relief.
“Even if it’s to the height of ten thousand feet, Cas always believes in rising to the occasion.” Gabe teased, looking up at the mountains for a moment. Now Gabriel Novak was the complete opposite of his brother, very much straight and more fun. Mick giggled a little at the joke Gabe made.
“You must never come to dinner on time.” Jack said to him, chiming in with Claire.
“Affectionately?” Rolfe asked with a warm tone. Krissy looked at him, smiling as she threw her arms around him. That was definitely better. “Will there be any reply?” He asked Krissy in a gentle tone.
Dean had never seen one before but he always wondered what it’d be like to dance with a nice man. Dean walked in the room and smiled as she looked at the nicely decorated walls. He started to courtesy and bow at imaginary people.
“I’ve never had one of those before.” Claire admitted softly.
“Or…” Castiel admitted, “Perhaps searching for a reason to stay.” He started to walk with Mick again, back up to the back porch of the house.
“He’s a boy!” Reverend Mother Abaddon shut them both down before she put her hands together in a praying position, all the nuns doing the same.
Castiel raised his voice, “I said I don’t want to hear any more from you--”
“So Do.”
Dean walked to the middle of the room and faced the children, biting his lip and sighed. “Um, at ease?” The children stood more relaxed now. “Would you please tell me all your names again and how old you are?” He wanted to get to know these children, they seemed very nice.
“Is it possible--or I could have just imagined it--Have my children, by any chance, been climbing trees today?” The Captain asked him, a remorseful smile on his face.
Gabe looked at Mick and rolled his eyes, “Yesterday, Sascha Petrie stole them first.” He kept eating his strudel angrily. More frustrated than angry though. “If there’s one thing I hate, it’s a thief.”
Marta looked up at her father, “Why can’t we ever see the Baron?”
“To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls,” Castiel hummed a little along to the song, his head swaying as he did so. “Over stones on its way, on its way. To sing through the night…”
“Yes. And I am their father. Goodnight.” The older man said as he closed the door to Dean’s room.
Then the young man heard bells chiming in the distance, his eyes widening. He completely forgot! Dean ran to go back down the hills then gasped. He almost forgot his hat! Dean ran back to go get it then down again from the hills. “Damn me.” Dean said under his breath.
“Well, they wouldn’t dare!” Dean started to yell at Castiel now. “They love you too much! They fear you even more!”
“Let me think. Nice things -- Roses! Green meadows. Skies full of stars.” Dean listed then smiled as he began to sing to the children, “Raindrops of roses and whiskers on kittens. Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens.” He looked at Gretl and scrunched up his nose with a smile. “Brown paper packages, tied up with strings. These are a few of my favorite things!”
Castiel shrugged, “I haven’t heard them complain yet.”
“They’re asleep. They’re not scared.” Gretl pouted as she leaned into Dean’s arms. Thunder cracked again and Gretl buried her face in Dean’s chest, his hand at the back of her head as the other girls ran in.
Abaddon looked down for a moment. “Perhaps, if you go out into the world for a time knowing what we expect of you, you will have a chance to find out if you can expect it of yourself.” She told him.
“And, oh, I forgot the other boy. What’s his name?” Dean murmured, his thumbs tapping against each other as he thought for it. “Whatever, God Bless what’s-his-name. God bless the Reverend Mother and Sister April and everybody at Nonnberg Abbey.” He whispered as he heard a scruntching noise behind him, catching sight of Krissy in his bedroom.
“Y’know, if we washed that dress out tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow. You could put this on.” Dean had seen a white nightgown, probably from the last governess who forgot it. “Take your dress in there, put it to soak in the bathtub.” He grabbed the nightgown and gave it to Krissy, giving her a gentle smile. “Then come back here and sit on the bed and we’ll have a talk.”
All the children looked down at their laps and Dean just smiled at the Captain, who was staring at him. But then Marta started to cry, which Dean didn’t want her to cry necessarily.
Dean shook his head, “No, it was Claire, wasn’t it? And you didn’t tell me how old you are.” He pointed out in a gentle voice. The girl looked down at her feet, ashamed for a moment.
Brigitta went over to grab a snack and answered, “Oh, it’s easy.”
Dean looked back at the kids, “Let’s think of something to sing for when the Baron comes to visit.” He told them, tuning his guitar a little.
Castiel laughed a little as he looked at Gabe. He was now sitting down as he ate. “Still eating, Gabe? Must be unhappy.” He observed.
“Why would he want to see you?” Kurt retorted back at his sister. Suspicion complete. Dean was right in saying the Baron was a man, but why is he so important to the Captain?
“Do Re Mi.” The children said again.
Gabe nodded and smiled at him. “Marvelous.”
Then he heard knocking on the door. “Oh, come in!” He said, looking back at the door as it opened. “Frau Schmidt.” Dean sighed and went over to her.
“I wouldn’t like it any other way.” Dean sassed with a smirk, a hand on his hip. That seemed to make Castiel angrier. Or more frustrated with his feelings, he didn’t know.
“A name I call myself.”
“Dean makes me.... laugh.” Sister Kelly smiled as the other nuns laughed too.
Castiel shrugged and chuckled, “No. Just highly improbable.” He barely thought he was exciting. And, right now, neither did his children or Dean.
Dean sat up now, the children in a circle. “Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes. Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes, silver white winters that melt into springs. These are a few of my favorite things.” The kids definitely enjoyed this song, far better than the storm that kept on coming.
Dean closed the door before he looked back at the Reverend Mother, pursing his lips. “Come here, my child.” Abaddon said, her glasses were on now. They weren’t anything fancy as she couldn’t have much ‘other worldly’ possessions.
Castiel nodded, grumbling, “Yes, you can help it!” The Germans were gonna take over Austria if no one did anything. And that’s what he hated, no one was really doing anything about it. It disgusted him. “You must help it.”
“How many have I had?” Gabriel asked her as he looked back at her, rubbing his stomach a little. He loved food. He thought it was one of life’s greatest pleasures, especially when he ate a lot of it.
“Claire.” A girl with blonde hair said.
The Captain looked at Dean and narrowed his eyes at him. Normally, he would never let this slide and he wasn’t sure what made him let it. “Kristen?” He went to walk near his kids.
“A retired officer of the Imperial Navy. A fine man and a brave one.” She explained as she wrote a telegram for the Captain
Castiel sighed, “I was hoping they’d be here to welcome you.” He looked over at Gabe and told him, “Gabriel, do step out of character and try to be charming.” Cas patted Gabriel’s shoulder as he went to look for his children again.
“A needle pulling thread!” The kids sang after he did. “La, a note to follow sew. Tea, a drink with jam and bread. That will bring us back to Do.”
“You may call me Captain.” He said before he walked away again.
The boys were playing with a ball, Brigitta was playing jump rope and Marta watched. The other girls were eating, Claire laying down as she ate her apple. “Mr. Winchester, can we do this every day?” Claire asked him with a happy look in her eye. It was honestly sad that this might’ve been the first time they’ve ever had fun in quite a while.
“Cats!”
Castiel came out of the house and spotted Rolfe throwing rocks at his house, going over to him. “What are you doing there?” He asked accusingly.
“Well, you’re so-”
“He’s as flighty as a feather.”
“La.”
The bus stopped where Dean needed to be and he got off, a smile on his face. “With each step I am more certain.” Although he almost tripped down the bus stairs, laughing a little at himself. “Everything will turn out fine!”
Gabriel laughed a little, “Not at all. I’m a very charming sponge.” He winked at the Baron with a smug smirk. Then they started to hear a choir singing. “Listen…” Gabe’s ear quickly caught the sound of them.
Dean’s eyebrows furrowed before he looked at the Captain and smiled at him. “Well, I find it very unlikely they’ve had a male governess before. And especially one like me.” He said confidently.
Dean sighed and nodded, closing his mouth now. “Yes, mother.” He went to sit down again, his hands folded on his lap now. “If it is God’s will.” He said sadly. He didn’t want to leave, but if Reverend Mother thought it was best, he had no place to argue.
Dean nodded, laughing a little, “When you sing, you begin with Do Re Mi.” He looked around at the kids, smiling at them. He already liked teaching the kids to sing.
Dean was getting the boat to make sure it didn’t float away before he spotted Mick. That must be the Baron then. Mick stifled his laughter as he watched the children, Cas looking at him with a serious face.
“Jack.” The oldest boy, one with blond hair said.
“So Do La Fa Ti Do Re Do.” The children repeated this too.
“Pretending to be madly active, I suppose.” Castiel shrugged then told him with a small smile at the corners of his lips. “Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.”
“We are not talking about sheep, black or white, Sister Kelly.” Sister April rolled her eyes. She always looked so stern. Dean wondered if she had ever relaxed before. “Of all the candidates for the coronation, I’d say Dean is the least likely-” But then The Reverend Mother cut the two off from arguing any longer.
“Of course, but Fraulein Hilda’s dress was ugliest.” Kurt answered back. Dean was practically cackling at the banter which made them look at him weirdly.
“It wasn’t my idea. It was Kurt’s!” Jack blamed it on his younger brother. Oh! That’s the name I forgot!
Some nuns laughed before they sang, “How do you hold a moonbeam.... in your hand?” Reverend Mother walked off to her quarters as well, thinking of a way to deal with Dean on her walk to her room.
Dean sighed as he got up on the stone path. His hair was down on his head after falling in the water, usually it spiked up though. And all of them were soaked in their clothes. He looked at Mick and gave him a small smile before looking back at the Captain, disgust on his face. Castiel really was no fun.
“You are correct in that first part. The second, I’m not so sure of yet.” The Captain said to him, his eyes stern. It almost reminded Dean of Sister April. Then he began to explain the children’s schedule, “Every morning you will drill the children in their studies, I will not permit them to dream away their summer holidays. Each afternoon, they will march about the grounds, breathing deeply. Bedtime is to be strictly observed, no exceptions.”
“I love him very dearly.” She said wholeheartedly, “But he always seems to be in trouble! Doesn’t he?” Sophia pointed out.
“I know you don’t, but you’ve got to!” Dean growled. That made Castiel stop for a moment and look at him, narrowing his eyes. “Now, take Krissy-”
Castiel pursed his lips before he stepped closer to his children before they all hugged him happily. He hugged them too, smiling. He finally felt happier. Not only because of Mick but because of his children.
Mick shrugged with a smile, “But take that all away and you just have…. Wealthy, unattached little me searching just like you.” They were very similar yet so different. Mick loved having parties and other things like that while Castiel mostly liked to keep to himself.
Abaddon went to a group of nuns to ask them about their opinion of Dean. “Children! We were speculating about the qualifications of some of our postulates, The Mistress of Novices and The Mistress of Postulates were trying to help me by expressing two points of view, tell me, Sister Katherine, what do you think of Dean?”
Krissy’s fingers went to her lips and she watched him leave. Once he was out of her sight though, she squealed happily as the rain just kept on pouring, thunder cracking again.
Mick shook his head. Of course, he could probably do it. But it may be hard. “Oh, he’s no ordinary man.”
“‘Sincerely’?” Krissy asked with a small frown.
Then the group went to the mountains, skipping along by a riverside. They went on a train to get to mountains safely, the kids waving at one of the conductors. They all ran through flowers to get to a nice spot for their picnic.
Although Castiel was a bit preoccupied with worrying about where the kids were. He couldn’t find them anywhere. So, where were they?
Dean was still fuming and wasn’t gonna stop until he got everything off his mind. “The way you do all of them. Claire, I don’t know about, but someone has to find out about her!”
Dean bit his lip and thought. “Yes, I’m sorry, I remember. How long will he be gone then?” He asked her.
The nuns sang all together again, “Many a thing you know you’d like to tell him. Many a thing he ought to understand.”
“I had them put up just for you, darling.” Castiel told him with a smile. The only time he’s really ever smiled was around Mick, especially after his wife died. Mick made him happy.
As the reverend mother came back from the chapel, two other nuns following her, Sister April and Sister Kelly, another nun, Sister Jessica ran up to them. “Reverend Mother.” She said urgently.
“Mr. Winchester….” The Captain sighed.
Dean nodded, glancing over the children for a moment. "I’m Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper.” She said to him, shaking his hand.
“That marvelous mixed quartet I’ve been trying for months to steal away from Sol Hurok--” Gabriel started, a bit angry.
Castiel’s anger flared for a moment then sighed, pursing his lips. Now, he was in silent anger. Hitler was a disgrace. Gabriel and Mick walked up next to Castiel, watching him and the boy. “Who are you?” The Captain asked Rolfe, narrowing his eyes at him.
Sister Katherine walked off the steps and smiled. “He’s a wonderful boy! Some of the time.” She sighed softly.
“See what fun it is?” Dean smiled as the kids started to look like they were having fun. “Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens,” He stood on the bed now, looking down at the children. “Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens.” A window opened and banged against the wall. Dean sighed and went to close it again. “Brown paper packages tied up with strings, these are a few of my favorite things!”
Kurt nodded at him before he stepped forward, “I’m Kurt. I’m eleven. I’m incorrigible.”
Castiel’s eyes widened as he watched them then opened the gate, “Come out of that water at once!” He yelled at his children. They were still laughing and having fun though, Claire helped Gretl since she couldn’t swim yet. Mick rushed to be by Castiel.
The Captain shook his head at Dean, “Mr. Winchester, this is a large house. The grounds are very extensive and I will not have anyone shouting. You will take this please, learn to use it.” He said firmly, again, not one of those times Dean dared to question someone. Even if.... that person was shorter than him.
“Brigitta, you shouldn’t say that.” Kurt told her.
“Kristen.” The first girl said. She had dark brown hair.
Castiel’s eyes widened before he looked back at the house. “The children…” He repeated in a whisper before he quickly walked into his house.
The Captain shook his head, “They have uniforms.” He growled.
Castiel’s eyes widened. “Don’t you dare tell me about my son!” It was honestly like he barely knew them. Because it was all true.
Claire sighed and nodded, “I suppose so.” She smiled then looked at Dean again, “Every other day?”
Frau shrugged back at Dean, going to leave the room now. “Nevertheless, new ones have been ordered.”
Rolfe laughed softly, shrugging, “But, I’m here.”
Claire shook her head, “You won’t see them. They’re like you! They’re brave.” Well, that one I’ve never been called before. At least, not in any positive way. The thunder cracked again, making all the girls hide, covering their ears too.
“Do Do.” Dean sang, winking at the kids with a smile. “When you know the words to sing, you can sing most anything.” The kids sang under Dean, in a pattern of the different notes.
“A clown.” Sister April interjected, sighing out of frustration.
“To write on….” Krissy sang softly, leaning over Rolfe. His eyes widened at that.
“Cordially.” Rolfe tried again.
Dean nodded again, “How do you do?”
“He’s a demon!” Sister April snarled.
Mick looked back at Castiel, “Well, what would you call me, Castiel?” He asked with a smile, leaning into his arms more.
“Leave?” Dean’s eyes widened, his heart quickening a bit. Would they really send him away just because he didn’t listen?
“I said that will do!” Castiel talked over him.
Gabe looked at Rolfe, “I’m Herr Novak.” He told him.
“And listen to all you say.” Sister April nodded and looked at Abaddon with fake sad eyes.
“How do you do? I’ll show you to your room. Follow me.” Frau said quickly as she went to grab Dean’s bag and he grabbed his guitar. Dean looked at the children before he started to walk up the stairs.
“He’s a riddle, he’s a child.”
“Yes, of course. I’ve missed you, Krissy.” Rolfe said quickly, grabbing her hands again. He never wanted her to doubt him in any way. But he had a few doubts himself.
“Strength doesn’t lie in numbers!” Dean almost yelled, swinging his bags around. Although, he was pretty strong too. “Strength doesn’t lie in wealth! Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers.”
“I’d like to say a word on his behalf.” Sister Kelly intervened.
Rolfe shrugged as he held hands with Krissy and sighed, “I don’t know. It’s just-”
“Many a thing you know you’d like to tell him.” Abaddon stepped up the stairs so she was on the same level as the other nuns. “Many a thing he ought to understand.”
Krissy laughed softly and smiled at Rolfe, “We’re all Austrian.”
That made Rolfe immediately stop. “Captain Novak! I was just looking for--” He sighed as he looked at the Captain. “I didn’t see-- I mean, I didn’t know you were--” Rolfe stammered nervously. He pursed his lips before he posed, “Heil Hitler!”
“Dean, I haven’t summoned you here for apologies.” She told him, her voice cutting through Dean’s words. It quickly made him shut his mouth. “Dean, when you saw us over the abbey wall and longed to be one of us, that didn’t necessarily mean that you were prepared for the way we live here, did it?” Abaddon asked, taking off her glasses now.
Mick smiled at them. He wasn’t mad or anything like that at them. He thought that would be fun to do. “How do you do?” The kids still didn’t stay anything.
“Now, I have to admit, I’ve never been a governess before. So, I’ll need lots of advice.” Dean said, hopeful that they might help him.
Dean smirked for a moment before he looked up at the ceiling, “And about Krissy, please help her to know I’m her friend.” That made the teenager stop in her tracks. “And help her to tell me what she’s been up to.”
“He’s always late for everything!” Sister April rolled her eyes at that.
Jessica sighed and looked up at the Reverend Mother. “I simply cannot find him.” She said sadly. She kind of liked the young man, he was funny and nice.
Sister Kelly walked up next to the Reverend Mother, smiling as she shook her head. “How do you keep a wave upon the sand?” Abaddon chuckled and nodded at her.
Castiel licked his lips then looked at him, cocking his eyebrow. “Now, whatever gave you that idea?”
He stopped by the water fountain and washed off his hands and face before running again. Dean stopped and sighed when he spotted the nuns. He looked at them then shook his head, sighing before he walked off to his room. Of course they already knew he was late...
"Cas, I—" Dean starts to say, but stops when Cas shoots him another glare. Neither of them move.
"Not exactly- but also, yes, exactly." Sam says, gesturing to a paragraph on the page that Dean has no interest in reading. "You have to consume a very- very- small amount of grace. Just enough that you, you know, don't explode."
It sucks.
"How long?" Sam musters up, offering Dean a sympathetic glance.
"What about him?" Dean finally asks, ripping his eyes away from the place Miracle had just been to look up at Sam. "Why are you still here, anyways? Eileen should be getting her back blown out right now."
Dean realizes who the voice belongs to with both great and no pleasure. He cautiously opens his eyes, glancing up at the ceiling and then down at his body and over again. They're in Dean's room, of course they are, because why would Cas take him to a damn hospital?
"Listen to me for two seconds, or I will not hesitate to zip your mouth shut." Cas warns, tightening his grip on Dean's shirt. "I know you, Dean. I know you're lying to yourself. I know you've been lying to yourself. There is no way, no way on heaven or earth, that you would allow yourself to die on a milk run like that. Not unless you wanted to."
And Dean realizes that it isn't a losing game. Hope is, that's for sure, but even if he fails in an attempt to save Cas, it's okay. It's worth the small chance. And if he dies trying?
"Sam, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I'm going back to my room, now." He says, trying to mask the overwhelming loss of what little hope he had as he turns in the direction of his only safe haven. Sam doesn't protest.
"Yeah?" Dean chokes out, scratching at his throat and trying to get any air possible into his lungs. "Well, I have leverage."
The angel turns back to Dean, swallowing nervously, because he hadn't planned for this.
Cas nods, flashing a small smile at Sam and watching, neck turned slightly, as the taller man walks out of the room. Dean allows his eyes to trail over Cas', taking in the blue of his eyes and the pink of his cheeks and the stupid trench coat and everything that is just so Cas.
He doesn't know what Sam's doing out there, and in all honesty, he doesn't really care. Sam's the lucky one in this situation. Eileen is alive, Sam should be out and getting it up with her.
"So, I have to go all Pablo Escabar on go-go juice and then kick the can?" Dean asks, staring down at the book. Sam huffs out a laugh, nodding.
Jack turns, raising his brows in the signature confused expression that has taken up his features since he'd basically popped out as a grown man. It's warm against all odds, and that only seems to make Dean impossibly furious. How was he the only one that cared?
"No, you don't know. I'm in love with you, you friggin nut." Dean says, tears tracking down his own face, and Cas lean's against Dean's touch, exhaling.
"Yeah, well, that's the hard part. I'm thinking that since Michael had spent so long in your, you know, meat suit, it's possible that you have a little bit of Angel left in you." He says, nervously chewing down on his bottom lip.
"Can't it wait, like, an hour?" Dean grumbles, watching as Miracle begins to throw himself mercilessly into the door.
Dean is holed up in his room, sitting on his bed. Miracle is lying next to him with his head wedged between Dean's knee. Dean gently scratches at the tuft of fur under miracles ear, exhaling with a soft smile as the dog nuzzles against his affection.
So this is how he's going to die. Man, screw him for thinking he was even going to at least score a death next to Sam. Instead, he's bleeding out alone in the dark, sprawled uncomfortably across the dirty floor of a random barn. Dean knows that he doesn't deserve this, even through all of his self-hatred and anger. He's the guy who saved the world, more times than not, and the universe still won't do him any favors. It doesn't make a lick of sense.
The barking doesn't stop. In fact, it grows louder and louder and then Miracle bursts into the kitchen, jumping up excitedly to paw at Dean's side and yap right in his ear.
He retches violently, except there's nothing for him to hurl, he hasn't eaten in days, so it's just another source of pain to cross a tally through. He trembles even harder, his eyes rolling back into his head. He feels overwhelming moisture in his mouth and drool and foam and acid frothing up in his throat, but he doesn't scream.
The Empty's grip slightly weakens.
up." The Empty says, glaring down at Dean with a grimy smirk.
Dean trembles next to Sam, clenching his fists, a shaken up bottle of carbonated sludge about to explode. He's pent up, sad and angry and he needs to say something.
But Dean had.
Dean frowns. He knows that Cas is right, but he fears that if he lets the angel out of his sight, he just might go into cardiac arrest. So Dean being Dean, he fights it.
to get back," Cas turns to leave, but Dean can't take that, he doesn't want to be away from Cas for another second.
"Sam, do not dick around with me about this." Dean says, moving to close the door. Sam firmly grabs onto the handle.
