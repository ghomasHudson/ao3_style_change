But when Mycroft summoned him to the Diogenes Club for dinner, Sherlock always went. The food was delicious, even if Sherlock had to watch Mycroft eating, but the rules of the Club were so strict that Mycroft couldn't talk to him throughout dinner - only afterwards, for an hour, in one of the Club's private rooms where short meetings were permitted.
John fixed his eyes on Sherlock. "That's why you should use me," he said. "I don't get irked when you cancel at the last minute.
"Yes," Sherlock said, with almost frightening satisfaction. "
The next day, after jerking off three times (once before he could go to sleep: once when he woke up, full of a dream of Sherlock: once in the shower, just because he could) something occurred to John.
Sherlock realised, about halfway through, that he was becoming aroused. Not by accident, not by a passing thought, not with the sudden feeling that he must come now or he wouldn't be able to think - but a kind of slow, building, entirely strange feeling that increased every time John only licked at his fingers or the palm of his hand, every time Sherlock pushed his own fingers into John's mouth with a morsel of food. He wanted to have John make him come, and he never wanted this strange kind of meal to end.
Sherlock's gaze fixed on John's face and travelled down his body speculatively. "Interesting," he breathed.
Sherlock came up behind him and enfolded him. His coat swung out and round John. His arms pressed John tightly and he rested his chin on top of John's head. He held him for only a moment, but the warmth seemed to stay with John. "Ropes or handcuffs?" he said into John's ear, and let go.
He watched John's face change. He enjoyed that. It was like nothing he could remember experiencing before - not even with Redbeard. John licked his lips, and nodded.
"Use the safeword, and we'll forget this ever happened," Sherlock said. "I'm going out shortly. I'll be back in two hours. You've been in the stand for longer than that before."
"Hello? Yes?"
"I'll use you however I want," Sherlock said. "I'll stretch your ass til I can fuck you whenever I want. You'll come only when I tell you."
"Okay, I'm used to it. Would have been more convenient with the Battersea Trunk murder," John added. He remembered that. "I was right there when you walked out, and I got your text when I was on my way to bed. Joined you half an hour later. You could have got yourself off and me off in the time you spent going to the hotel."
" but a man who - however accidentally - walks in on his flatmate and interrupts a very nice blow job, does not have the moral high ground.
"No."
Sherlock was texting and stalking round the room. He had been texting Lestrade, information about a case, and John only realised the mood had changed when Sherlock snapped his phone into his pocket and went into his room, coming out with a different kind of look to him. Not only what he had stuffed into the pockets of his coat, spoiling the line of his jacket, but the look John had learned, hairtrigger Sherlock.
"What?" Sherlock stared at him. "I didn't ask you."
Sorry for the long, long, long delay, but I hope this is a satisfactory conclusion. (It took a long time for me to work it out exactly how it ended.) John and Sherlock take their relationship to the next level. This chapter begins some indefinite time after chapter four ends.
"Good," said Sherlock, and spoke down the phone to the take-out woman. "Just double all the portions, will you?"  He was not at all hungry. He hoped John was. "Oh, and add another portion of egg-fried rice."
"I'll still use other people," Sherlock warned.
"All yours, Sherlock," John breathed.
Sherlock was in the middle of typing a rather long text to Dimmock, and glanced up with the look that said "I don't care, and we're not going to discuss it."
John had assumed Sherlock was some variety of asexual. Or celibate. He didn't do relationships. John had got the impression he didn't do sex. John rubbed his face, trying to cure the blush and the tendency to gape. Well, he'd been wrong about that.
"John," Sherlock said. "Do you remember what your safe word is?"
"Me," John confirmed.
What if Sherlock kept asking when John had decided to stop?
"A virgin," Sherlock said clinically. "I'll expect you to let me know if you experience this as discomfort. Don't try to endure it bravely like a little soldier, John, you're just here to be used, and I don't like breaking my little toys. This won't be your first time being fucked in the mouth."
"I'm going to open your ass and mount you on one of these dildos."
from me?"
Sherlock withdrew from his mouth and John saw him neatly knot the condom. "Oh, you wanted my spunk?" Sherlock said. He sounded amused. "Greedy toy. Now I suppose you want to come?" Sherlock studied John a moment. He put his foot under John's cock and balls. touching the delicate, stretched skin between balls and asshole with the toe of his shoe.
He laid the boxes out on the table convenient for the sofa, and sat down on the sofa, convenient for John's mouth.
"I need to get dressed," John said. "And - " he smirked - "you need to change those trousers."
He had a succession of casual dates with pleasant nurses and friendly doctors, and a couple of not-exactly-dates with mates from the army, and it was all fine, and his dates were interrupted no more than usual by texts from Sherlock, and he enjoyed running around London solving crimes with Sherlock, and it was all fine.
move at all. Sherlock hand-fed John the small, tender pieces of pork, pushing each bit into his mouth with his fingers. There were four spring rolls: one by one, Sherlock slipped them between John's lips. Fried duck. Two dishes of everything. More pork. Rice. Another lidded box of duck. The egg-fried rice. A bag of pineapple fritters. More rice. This should have been boring, or even disgusting - if he'd had to watch Mycroft eat for two hours, it would have  been both - but John was so focussed on him, John's mouth reacted so beautifully to Sherlock's fingers, to the food morsels being pushed inside, John was so helplessly, delightfully aroused and so unable to do anything about it -
"What?" John was rubbing his bruised elbow and thinking happily about a long hot bath. Then it sank in, what Sherlock had just said, and he stared at Sherlock, feeling his flesh quiver, feeling his jaw drop open.
He looked away from Sherlock. "I don't care," he said in stony voice.
What if John didn't like it?  (Then he just wouldn't do it again.)
He went to stay the weekend with Clara and Harry. Harry wasn't drinking any more. John scrupulously returned on the day and train he had specified. He had no idea if Sherlock had used one of his men in Baker Street while he was away, and he knew he shouldn't ask. He kept wondering.
"This will immobilise you," he explained to John. "Completely. You won't be able to move it, no matter how much you struggle, and you can't get loose of it yourself."
mind me, gents," the taxi driver said.
Sherlock stopped mid-text. He looked at John intently, clearly very pleased.
"John," Sherlock said, nearer. He'd been at the foot of the stairs, he'd evidently gone up a few steps. "Are you all right? Answer me."
John turned to face him, drawing himself up as if to present arms. "Handcuffs," he said steadily.
"I need to talk to you," John told Sherlock.
of them?" and he wanted to say "
"Sorry!" John said, inadequately, and ran for the stairs to his room. "Sorry," he threw over his shoulder, and climbed the stairs, muttering to the bannister "Sorry, sorry, sorry - "
"Yes, grunt for me, John, let me know you're enjoying this, you like being filled, don't you, toy soldier, little man, you like it when you're filled, you're stretching, you can take this, your ass was meant to be plugged, John, you're just a little toy who needed to be used - "
to have
Sherlock preferred dildos for many reasons. First, and most importantly, he could have a dildo fucking a man in the ass while he himself face-fucked. But, secondarily, he could penetrate a man's asshole as slowly and carefully with a dildo as was needed, and vary the dildo by size, to ensure the man he was using was consistently excited and felt no pain: Sherlock preferred submissives to masochists, because while he quite enjoyed causing pain, he was too lazy to bother with a really dedicated masochist. Also, in his considerable experience, a man could either take Sherlock's dick up his ass, or he couldn't: but it was true, he had never had the opportunity to keep using increasingly-wider and longer dildos up the same man's hole on any regular basis. Scientifically, it was impossible to permanently alter a man's asshole, but it was possible to get an asshole so thoroughly used to having big smooth objects pushed up there that the asshole "learned" how to relax when opened and penetrated.
"I wish you could too," John said, in a dazed kind of voice. He stared up at Sherlock from the bathtub. "Let me," he said, and opened his mouth.
Sherlock was staring at him impatiently. John knew all he had to say was "I can't remember" or even "no thanks", and Sherlock would call someone else. One of the eight other men who'd "service" him.
John hesitated.
It was a cracking good case, including a long run on foot after a bloke who had a revolver, which John finished with a very satisfying rugby-tackle pinning him until Sherlock could handcuff him. Dimmock caught up with them, and a constable shortly after that, and it was all over bar Sherlock explaining how he had solved it, in his best tone of voice, the one that made it sound like everyone else was stupid. John loved that voice.
No, there won't be a sequel. (But if you want to write one, feel free.)
John closed down his laptop, and picked it and his dignity up. "No, Sherlock," he said. "Can't say I do."
"Quite impossible," Sherlock repeated. "I don't do exclusive."
There was a pause. John drank his tea. He was trying very hard not to blush.
But Sherlock never did. He and John were kept very busy for a few weeks on a succession of cases, and when Sherlock jumped off St. Bart's and left John alone, John's hide was still unmarked.
," he said. "Have you ever used a dildo before?"
Harry helped, and Clara helped, and his therapist helped, and Mrs Hudson kept saying John should find someone else, and eventually, John did. Mary said she knew John had loved Sherlock, and John never told her that Sherlock didn't do relationships: no one except Mycroft, perhaps, would have understood how John had been used.
John felt his skin crawl. He was, quite unexpectedly, actually terrified. It had been well over a week since that morning-after discussion, and Sherlock had said not a word about it. Somehow John had supposed that this kind of scene would start more... romantically? Well, less bluntly, anyway.
Sherlock called again "John? Do you want to come downstairs?" There was not a hint of double-entendre in his voice. He sounded, if anything, quite concerned.
more."
Had he? John had always fallen out of time whenever Sherlock locked him in the stand.
John nodded. Sherlock said this frequently. Much more frequently, John noticed, than he actually disappeared to use other people. As John had thought, the sheer convenience of having John to use meant Sherlock used John.
"I've never made an exclusive arrangement," Sherlock said. "Obviously we use condoms for anal sex and I have no interest in anything riskier. I'm regularly tested. I require the men to get regularly tested, too. I don't insist on condoms for oral sex if the man prefers otherwise, but I don't regard that as a major risk to myself, and I wouldn't have penetrative sex unless I was clean. I do enjoy filling a man's mouth with spunk and watching him struggle to swallow. What do you feel about that, John?"
John stood still. He felt the weight of that full attention on him, like chains. Sherlock had taken rope with him, not handcuffs. That would take longer, and Sherlock would be impatient.  Every scene with Sherlock had been almost exactly the same - even the things Sherlock said to him (which John wanked off to, afterwards, replaying the deep voice calling him a toy, telling him he was going to be plugged and used) were similar. And every time, John came. He needed less and less attention from Sherlock to come.
"Good pig," said Sherlock.
John didn't nod. He managed a strangled "no", and Sherlock looked mildly surprised.
"I know I can't have you," John said. "I want
"How many men do you...?" John paused, and as Sherlock went on looking at him with raised eyebrows, finally asked " - do you have that kind of... 'not-relationship'?"
John lifted his chin, consciously taking a deep breath. That wasn't going to happen. He'd committed to doing this at least once, he wasn't going to wriggle out of it just because it wasn't quite like he'd thought. "Mycroft," he said.
"I can make you a cup of tea if you like," Sherlock said. "But it would help if you could stay there for half an hour."
"Interesting," he said. He glanced at his watch. "But I don't have time." He left the flat and John heard him running down the stairs. He was gone.
Sherlock looked down at his trousered legs as if with surprise, and looked back at John. "Messy toy," he said, not sounding fond at all, and went in to his room. John pulled the blanket round himself and got up on shaky legs. He'd really liked all of that.
Sherlock moved round to stand in front of him. John could see the mouthwatering bulge in Sherlock's trousers, and if he squinted up, Sherlock's face from below, like being a dog.
(See the end of the chapter for
He enjoyed kneeling at Sherlock's feet and nuzzling at his hands and begging for food, he loved squirming naked with a stretching dildo inside him begging Sherlock for treats, for a drink, to be allowed to swallow Sherlock's cock - but of course that wouldn't happen in front of anyone else. Sherlock enjoyed paddling John for breaking the rules, but as he had warned John, he wasn't a very dedicated sadist: John would have enjoyed being paddled more often, but Sherlock could always think of an infraction of the rules to beat him for when Sherlock felt like causing pain.
"Yes," he said.
"I'm sorry," he said again. "Your.., friend, is he OK?"
"No loss," Sherlock shrugged. He looked at John. "You don't believe me. You think I'm being polite."
"I think it could get a bit weird, us having sex."
"What do you
As always, after coming, the world seemed brighter, sharper, everything more present. Sherlock stared down at naked pink John, still hard - his erection had swelled and bobbed and twitched throughout dinner, but as Sherlock hadn't touched him, John hadn't come.
"And you need to take that severed hand back to Barts
an emergency. I realised who committed the Battersea Trunk murder on my way
John said nothing.
"How would you do it?" John asked, interested.
"You understand I'll still have other people to use," Sherlock said to him.
Mrs Hudson was in, TV on, watching something loud and American. The door to 221b was shut, but violin music was leaking under it, so Sherlock was probably in his room, thinking aloud, and John could avoid a string of deductions about Harry, Clara, and John's relationship with them both - if he was quiet.
"Why?"
"Lock you in the breeding stand to immobilise you, and use a branding iron on you."
John swallowed. He didn't trust his voice to answer.
"You've got questions," Sherlock said. "Ask them."
Sherlock was pacing up and down, muttering to himself, when John sat up, still hot with afterglow, feeling both drained and relaxed. Sherlock was still fully dressed, still wearing his coat, and there was a splatter of cum-stain on one trouser leg.
He was left with remembering "You're a good toy. I like using you. A convenient mouth."
"Yes," Sherlock said, feeling for the latest credit card freshly purloined from Mycroft. "Big brother will pay." Mycroft had bought him dinner, Mycroft should buy John dinner, that was only fair.
John had made himself tea and toast with jam, and was sitting with his feet drawn up out of the way in his armchair. He expected at some point tonight he'd get dragged out again, and he wondered if he might catch a nap before that happened.
“Sherlock?” I said to the emphatic bang of the door at the end the hall.
It took me three cigarettes and a considerable amount of self-scolding to begin: every word I could offer him seemed a poor, weak thing. "Forgive me"—for leaving him without a word? How could I ask it? "Believe me"—that there had been no better choice? I had found none, but that scarcely justified me. "Come to me"? It was all I wanted, but clearly he could not, or the entire point of my flight was made moot. In the end I only told him the facts as they had happened, and tried to write out a little of my useless regrets. "I would very much like to hear from you," I added at the last, "at least to know that you are all right, and will take particular care of yourself until I can see you. I will promise to be as careful as I can if you will do the same.”
“Yes.” There was no expression in his voice; but the lines of his face showed bewildered exhaustion. Years, I thought, years without hope for his brother.
“Was there someone—have you ever—”
A flash of a glance, too quick to read, and then, “Mycroft has always been capable. Sherrinford takes after my father,” he said, and dropped his head back on the seat, and closed his eyes, and remained so until we pulled up before the august doors of the Diogenes. But his hand still lay in my lap, clinging to mine.
As it happened, John was perfectly capable of making clear to me what we were to do; and though he looked a little shy at first, within hours of our establishment in a quiet room overlooking the Senne, he turned to me quite suddenly from the little chest of drawers wherein he had been laying our clothes and said, “You don’t have to be afraid of me, you know.”
John Watson, outstanding in many facets of his character, is above all the most sincere man I have known. He may keep quiet, if he does not wish to be frank, but he will not mislead you; and even in silence a lift of his brows or an indrawn breath often speaks eloquently for and in spite of him. Sincerity is an enormously attractive thing: not least because of the single-minded loyalty it engenders in him, once his friendship is declared. The courage required to attain that kind of whole-souled clarity is enormous. It indicates a man on whom you may rely without question.
I wired Mycroft first, and then sent on three messages for John; one to the hostel in the mountains, hoping he had not yet left it; one to the hotel in Brussels where we had stayed together; and one to his rooms in London. I prayed Heaven he would not need the last. I shrank from the thought of him recrossing the Channel alone and afraid for me. Each said, SUDDEN ATTACK OF FEVER NECESSITATED SCOTT’S IMMEDIATE REMOVAL STOP APPLY TO HIS BROTHER FOR NEWS STOP I AM SORRY STOP.
The day of his brother’s wedding dawned early, cold and bright and blue. I woke alone; Sherlock must have gone downstairs sometime after I’d begun dreaming. He was often too restless to sleep, and too kind to disturb my hard-won rest. I listened, and heard a melancholy violin singing below.
You might speak to my brother. He holds the information I had gathered on the organisation as it stood, including the members we deemed unimportant, wherein you could search out those hangers-on and minor associates remaining at large in London. Our man must be somewhere among them. I would prefer you stay well out of it, but if you feel it is necessary to your peace of mind, my brother can bring you into the case.
“Rosie?”
“What’s wrong?” I am not usually so direct: I prefer to tease him toward happiness with little gallant unmentioned attentions when he is low. But I was so surprised at him, I spoke without thinking.
“Good,” he said, smiling. “I assume that was Mrs. Hudson’s doing. Have you taken steps to secure her safety?”
I am accustomed to being struck speechless in his presence. I rather relish it, but this was quite beyond me. “I beg your pardon?”
There was an endless, an epochal pause, and then she said, ineloquently, “Oh,” and at once I had an armful of Sherlock, a warm curly head pushed up under my chin, and then, wonder of all wonders, kisses were being pressed into my skin; and it was a very good day, Valentine’s Day.
It was not really a question; an order, more. I bowed to it. “As soon as I’m rid of our company on the street. And I must see my brother.”
“Sherlock.” Mycroft sounded bemused. “The Doctor’s writing has made you both famous. You must realize that.”
And the freedom would be good. In Paris I was not notorious, I would not be spoken to in the street, I would not even appear unusual. I might stay up all night, and live on coffee and bread, and wander about bookstalls and chemists’ shops dressed in the most careless fashion, and no one would say a word.
“Not since he moved back here. You should have seen him, day of, going in circles round his flat. He was so happy he couldn’t think,” she said in a tone properly described as maternal, and I nearly turned around and went right back downstairs. I’d had no idea I was that obvious. “I had to talk him through taping up the boxes and emptying the fridge.”
I've written it. Will send you on a copy when it's printed. You come off quite the hero in my version, if a little colder-hearted than is strictly fair. That's my feelings over the experience coming through, I expect; I can't write it any better than that, and I've worked over it a good deal. Wept over it, too.
He took that in with a sharp breath. “How?”
I've rewritten how Holmes and Watson meet in London. Clearly Watson couldn't write it as it happened, but he gives us permission to rewrite him pretty directly by admitting how often he has to change details to obscure sensitive facts. I followed their canon path through Europe, but again, changed the details of the confrontation at the Fall.
“I think you must. Alacrity of mind is crucial to what’s ahead. Eat what you can, and rest, if you can’t sleep. I will have you roused at five, to discuss what’s to do. At six you will go to him.”
“Only to me,” I reminded him, and he smiled a little more.
I had done worse than warn him; I’d mocked him. I’d goaded and scorned him, out of my anger. I was well and truly repaid now. “I was wrong to do that. I do not think it absurd. You may tell me whatever you choose.” I sounded an automaton.
For some moments he regarded me in silence. I couldn’t read his face at all, which was more frightening to me than everything else so far; but then he blinked, and determination writ itself across his forehead. “All right,” he said. “I’ll hold you to that in a minute. Holmes—I’m having difficulty—that is to say, Mary and I—” He stopped, and sighed, and rubbed his chin, clearly discomfited; his eyes dropped again. “I’ve not been able to fulfill my duties to her.”
We walked about the city for the better part of two silent hours. The loneliness on his face grew no less, but he kept my hand tucked close into his elbow, and felt for it, and patted it, now and then. I thought it steadied him. He asked if we might lunch in a tavern; and when we finally arrived in our own rooms he set aside his coat and went directly to occupy himself at his tabletop laboratory. I am no student of chemistry, but I am an observer of Sherlock Holmes. It was quite clear that while he was not angry with me, he might be, if I insisted on breaking in on his thoughts before he had sifted through them and found what he needed; so I remained nearby, attending to the Journal and my accounts, and preparing several submissions for the Strand. Sometimes he needed me only to stay, a presence beyond the borders of the wild country within him, so that he would not get lost there.
I know he slept, because he was wrapped around his pillow, open-mouthed and dreaming, when I came awake in the early morning, and went into my own room for my things. I settled in the sitting room. Mrs. Hudson brought up our breakfast, and left again; the clock ticked on. I read the newspaper through, and examined the post, and cast about me for something useful to do. It took some time, but at last I was wholly immersed in rewriting a piece for the Idler, a sketch of my time at school, which would provide me with a little pocket-change, when I heard the sitting room door open. I turned to see him entering fully dressed, dazed and blinking in the morning light. He looked miserable.
“You could let it be, give it time. Or you could write to him. Or you could go and see him.” I stepped to meet him; touched his jaw, which worked under my hand; brushed my fingers over his soft, damp cheeks, to catch the tears. When he still didn’t speak, I asked, “What time is the wedding? Seven o’clock?”
“I want to give him a kiss, take his hand, but then I start to think horrible thoughts.”
“Where?”
kind. I didn’t dance with anyone, if that’s what you mean.”
“At any rate, I explained about Mary, and then I found myself telling Maxwell about my current troubles. I stammered a good deal, and found it far harder to put the case to a friend than I had to strangers; but he seemed interested. He asked me a dozen questions no one else had thought of, about my diet, my history, mental and physical, and about Mary. About my experience, too, or the absence of it. Then—” and for the first time John hesitated, and searched my face. “Holmes, if I go on, promise me you won’t allow me to say more than I should. If I make you uncomfortable—”
“Never,” I vowed, into his chest, and his arms tightened around me.
“Just you?” I said.
"Absolutely."
His gaze flashed up to mine. “You said together, or not at all.”
“You have paid me several compliments, Mr. Moriarty,” said I. “Let me pay you one in return when I say that I would, in the interests of the public, die cheerfully if I could take you with me.”
We sat silent together in the morning light from the east window. It was a little as though the end of days had passed over us, and left us just coming to our senses, lost and amazed, on the charred new earth.
He shoved his hand into his pocket, and as I registered the motion I had my pistol in hand, and raised it. But he merely drew out a memorandum-book, very like the one John kept.
The breath had left him.
“I can pay your way, then. Just give me your company.”
“A scarf.”
“You crossed my patch on the fourth of January.” He was reading from the book. “On the twenty-third you incommoded me; by the middle of February I was seriously inconvenienced; at the end of March I was actually hampered in my plans; and now, at the close of April, I find myself in danger of losing my liberty, thanks to you.” He put the book away, and raised his brows. “The situation is becoming impossible.”
I haven’t often seen Sherlock speechless. Mycroft studied him curiously before adding, “I confirmed your relationship to the Doctor when asked. I did not volunteer details, but I thought that much was forgivable.”
Sweet William,
“Not at all. Just like any crowd--unthinking; boisterous and a little crass. But some of them were interesting; and some were kind to me.”
We lay like that a long while, wrapped in shadows. I had begun to drift toward sleep amid the heat of him, when I heard him whisper, “I wish I could.”
Sherlock Holmes is a contradiction, an enigma, a force; at once the most generous spirit and the most self-contained man I have ever known. I've heard heaven and hell in his instrument as he played for me; I have watched him grieve, and struggle, and triumph; I have known him better, I think, than anyone on earth. Yet for years I'd learned nothing about his boyhood, nor his fears, nor his future hopes, nor his father’s name. He seemed to want nothing but the present moment. I had felt his odd immanence as a mystery; a sense almost of faerie magic about him, as though he were a man outside time. I never felt it as a lack until I knew he loved me.
All at once I was wide awake. I pushed up out of his arms to look down at his startled, sleepy face, faintly rosy in the fire’s dying light.
A sound escaped me. I had not expected that, from him. He smiled a little, watching me, and turned it in his lovely fingers for me to look at. It was gold, gleaming but plain, till I glimpsed inside the band what appeared to be a miniature skull inlaid.
“I am not,” I protested immediately. “I couldn’t be, you are—you are—” But I found myself at a loss for words again. He softened immediately, though, and sat back in his chair again; took up a cigarette, and lit it, giving me time to collect myself. The silence between us was sympathetic, now. I was too lightheaded from the sudden exposure to feel much relief; but still—I had said it. And he had stayed.
“Will I?” Spoken so softly, it meant something more. He looked at me as though he wanted to know—he looked—
“How long?”
"Holmes." A wealth of feeling in the word. His hand still held mine; it tightened, and his face shone with sudden delight. I found myself speechless before his happiness a long moment: no one else had ever looked at me quite so.
“Yes, of course. Obviously.” I even tried a laugh, but it came out high-pitched and faint and I gave up and flipped the box open after two tries, curse my clumsy fingers, so he could see the ring and not doubt himself or me a minute more. “Would you–do you–want it? Should I ask you–”
Your William
He drew it out, and laid it in my palm, with a questioning look.
Still, I questioned my judgment in leaving him there—questioned it, semi-involuntarily, about twice an hour from my arrival in France, alone, until the morning I was served a cup of poisoned tea at a tea-house on the Boulevard. I had been about to take a sip when the faintly bitter scent of the cupful struck my senses like a warning note. I knew that scent. I could not place it for a long moment, and then it came to me: cyanide. A mouthful of that tea would have killed me in moments.
“If I am, there are apples in the pantry,” I answered, growing more intrigued when he flushed up irritably and tutted at me.

I find it difficult to put into words the sensations I experienced at this statement. I hardly knew where I was. For one, here was another brother, again, entirely unknown to me! After all this time! And a brother getting married. My experience of the Holmeses, regardless of the unforeseen and wonderful intimacy of my current situation with Sherlock, was all against the idea of them involving themselves in such a public, conventional, domestic contract as legal matrimony. A Holmes to wed--and we two strange bachelors asked to come together! Setting aside the fact that this Sherrinford knew of my existence, despite my ignorance of his--did he know what we were?
I couldn’t answer him. I rose to my feet, under the pressure of mounting emotion, and found I could not stand steadily. He rose with me, watching me—reached out, and grasped my shoulders, anchoring me.
“Why?” Ella watched him, untroubled, waiting.
. I said, “I brought you chocolate. And also poison. Not in the chocolate, separately. To adequately reflect the duality of your contradictory soul, which I lo—I love.”
“It’s just socialization.” She talks to me entirely differently now that she’s Greg’s. I had known she was intelligent, but am still startled by how quick she is when she and I are all right–now I don’t fluster her with my careful indifference. Now that she knows it’s not her fault. “We grow up on rom-coms and love stories. You all don’t.”
Dearest John,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why on earth?” I knew I sounded hurt. I was hurt. “As you said, you did not begin this affair. I did. Do you think I respect myself so little? Or do you still believe I am only using you for my own pleasure?”
That won me a smile, and he kissed my shoulder and let me pull him nearer, and I was glad.
John looked down at his laptop. He squirmed, involuntarily. He thought of being naked on the floor with the cuffs and shackles on, a dildo stuffing his ass, Sherlock's cock in his mouth. He was hard as a rock, and he saw Sherlock's eyes fixed on him, taking that in.
Sherlock got up again. Where he had touched, John's skin felt bereft. When he came back, it was with an armful of dildos, some lube, and two keys embedded in a lump of blu-tac. He crouched down beside John, and showed him the keys, then stuck them to the top of the coffee-table. "The red key is for the handcuffs: do you need to confirm you can reach that and use it with your mouth, if necessary?"
"You're not a sociopath," he mentioned.
"Mark your toy so everyone knows? I'm yours," John said.
"Excellent. If you safeword," Sherlock sounded quite smug, "I can get these chains open in less than half a minute, I have tested this. Is this your first time in bondage, John?"
Sherlock pressed send, and looked up. "Fine, we'll order take-out," he said. "Chinese or Thai?"
"You take what I give you," he told John, and began with the first dish of roast pork with black bean sauce. He'd thought of chopsticks, or spoons, but fingers were safest - John's head was the only part of him he
"There's  not a moment to lose."
John wriggled comfortably. "Of course you do," he agreed. "I want that too. But ... " his voice became slightly wistful, "I liked you feeding me. Even if I wasn't in that contraption. I really liked your feeding me."
Besides, John would be expecting that the evening would end with a blowjob. John liked having his face fucked. Sooner or later, it was going to occur to John that he was in this stand for use, not pleasure - Sherlock was too tall to use John's mouth with any degree of comfort, and John wasn't stretched enough for Sherlock to fuck him there. But it certainly wouldn't occur to John any time soon, from the dazed expression on his face.
"Shit," Sherlock said, eloquently.
"I need to come," Sherlock said. "I'm going to make use of someone else. I think it might confuse your feelings if I made use of you now. Don't ask any more questions." He paused. "All right.
Mycroft liked food.
will, though," Sherlock deduced. He paused. "You
"You're not a dog," Sherlock said. "You're a pig, John. A naked pink pig. When I come back, I'm going to ask you again if you want to be branded. You can lie to me and say no and I never will. You can tell the truth - you're completely naked to me - and then sometime, when I lock you up in this stand, yes, I'll brand you. I won't tell you when, and I won't tell you where, but the mark will be covered by your clothes when you wear them. You won't wear clothes again til the brand's healed, and I'll give you painkillers to keep you docile, because it will hurt. And then you'll be my pig, as long as the mark is on your hide. You can have it removed, but you'll always know it was there. If you safeword before I leave, we may have this discussion again sometime, but if you say no and you're lying - I'll never brand you."
"If you need to get out of it sooner, you can use this alarm." He put something down just out of John's field of vision. "My name, and I'll come back as fast as I can. Mrs Hudson's name, and she'll come up from downstairs. Mycroft's name, and he'll likely be here faster than I will. Of course they'll then know what you are to me, but you're a fool if you think they haven't guessed. If you want out before I leave, just use the safeword. The alarm won't activate til I leave the room."
"I wish I could fuck that now," he said out loud, realising suddenly John could hear him. He had spoken so entirely to himself, so focussed on the hole as the dildo slid out, that it was strange to realise again that John was there - and very, oh very aware of him. "Not quite yet, though," he said, in the same assessing tone, but this time very much for John's hearing. He certainly wanted to do this to John again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We can’t go,” he said, almost inaudibly. “I can’t put you in danger.”
“Go change,” I said. “Your cuffs are wet.”
, and
“All right. Ordinarily I should argue the point, but I understand the circumstances are—difficult. That said, I should like to be quite clear, Holmes. Do you mean to say that if you successfully bring this man to court and a charge, I may kiss you?”
So he could tell I was nervous, that night, but he thought it was about the party. Really I’d been trying to work up my nerve to talk to him for days, and I’d set the NSY party as a sort of deadline for myself, so he wasn’t wrong. I wanted to get it done before Christmas, so I’d have an answer for the questions at the family party. I knew Mummy, she’d definitely ask, and in front of him, but trying to be subtle–“Have any plans?” But he didn’t know I was thinking about all that. He’s gotten the idea that I have anxiety about public events. Well, he gets protective, so I didn’t say anything. I let him smooth my shirt over my shoulders, and tell me I looked wonderful–I do enjoy that, silly as it is, being tidied and praised. I let him tell me everyone would be so pleased we came, a blatant lie. A few people (Greg, Molly) would be glad to see us, but most of them indifferent. He was pleased, though, which was the main thing. He held my hand in the cab. I tried not to fidget. The box in my inside jacket pocket felt bulky and obvious, even though it clearly wasn’t; he hadn’t glanced at it once in the days I’d been carrying it around. (I would have noticed it within sixty seconds.)
He had flagged down a cab; it was waiting for us at the kerb. I helped him into his coat, and opened the door for him; went around to the other side in a daze,  and slid in, as near him as I dared. He tucked his hand into my elbow; squeezed it gently. His other hand lay in his lap. The ring shone amid the shadows, in the streetlights’ glow. We looked at it all the way home.
"You have less frontal development of the brain than I expected,” he said slowly, and smiled. The smile was much worse than the stare. He added, “It is a dangerous habit to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing-gown.”
With a hot baguette from the bakery next door tucked under my arm, I set out on foot for the harbour. Nearly there, on some strange impulse, I pulled a rosebud through the fence of a little fishing house on the borders of the dockyard, and tucked the soft bit of colour into my buttonhole. There was a tramper leaving port in four hours, with room for a paying passenger. Baguette and bag in my lap, I sat on a bench by the quay, watching the ships pull in against the waning tide, the gulls wheeling above us in the darkening sky, crying into the cold, clear wind, and came fully into the realisation that I would be in London by the morning.
A sudden, soft scramble. Further silence.
"Come to dinner with me," I said. I confess I wasn't asking; I was sure of him. I was already anticipating the pleasure, turning about for my hat.
He blinked at me, absorbing this; nodded. “Are you ashamed of me?”
It was only when he said, “Are these for me?” that I realized he was deeply pleased. His voice had gone gruff, and his ears were slowly turning pink. I got up then, quickly, because I needed to touch him.
“Define normal,” was Ella’s response.
“It was--a wedding. Nothing unusual.”
from inside the sitting room. I opened the door in time to see her fling something into the fire, whirl and throw a shiny, pointy thing at the back wall, and run.
“Only in public?”
“I’m sorry, Holmes.” He sounded the same as always. “I’m a little abstracted.”
He came to me; sat on the bearskin rug at my feet, and took my ankle gently in his hand, and laid his head down in my lap. His hair has silver in it now. I buried my hand in the soft strands; drew my fingers through again and again, till his eyes grew clearer, his expression less otherworldly.
I would like to see the stoat, and the river, and the mad chemist himself most of all.
. John had never said that, just that, exactly, and all at once things feel entirely, perfectly clear for one minute, at least, and he had said, “All right.” They’d stared at each other.
“Holmes,” I said, my eyes on the beautiful line of his back in the low light. I rose. He did not turn.
“There are assassins about. I only want to be sure everything’s all settled before I drag John into some accidental adventure,” I said. And then I heard myself, and my heart began to beat faster; but she only smiled at me.
The City of London exists for the sake and to the praise of money. The populace come to it looking for luck, for love, for a change, for acclaim, and find a chance at them all. But the chance costs money, and the city has flourished around the exchange—money, for life. So many fail to make the first and lose the latter, and the city goes on with its eternal trade in souls, careless of them all.
“Billy,” I said, and held out a handful of coins. We’d had several profitable cases the week before, and the day was dark and drear enough to fray the nerves of any active, healthy boy cooped up indoors. “Run to the corner store for some candy. Get what you like. Bring back toffees for Mrs. Hudson and ribbon candy for Anna.” Anna, bright, curly-headed, fourteen years old, helped in the kitchen three days a week. Billy was entirely smitten: stricken red-faced and silent when she was in the room. He flushed straight up, on cue.
“Holmes.” A warning in his tone. I’d thought we were past being mannerly together, but it appeared I’d thought wrong.
Billy entered, equipped with a sealed envelope and an expression of purpose. Holmes waved a delicate, desultory hand, and the envelope and expression were brought to stand behind his chair.
"No, but—Listen, Holmes, this is what we've been wanting. You know who I am; I am not changed. Whatever you wished for while you were gone, it's yours."
“You never do,” he said. He sounded terribly gentle.
“Say lover. Yes, but I find I am content to be rejected. If you can’t be satisfied with less than utter absorption in me—”
“Right,” he said, vague, but fond, “I’ll be done soon.”
“Is he dangerous?” A thrill of sudden anger went through me. “Was he cruel to you?”
“Flowers,” was all he answered, into my shoulder; “It’s absurd, me getting like this over flowers,” but then he turned his face into my neck and kissed it, and I knew I’d done something good. So I’ve been getting him flowers. Periodically. Which is still a surprise of sorts, but not such a surprise, after the first time. And the other things we like to do together are quite ordinary–movie nights and Angelo’s and walking around the city and raiding the morgue for useful bits. Ordinary for us, at least. Not really surprising.
A few women were studying for their medical licenses by the turn of the century; Doctor Liddell is a rarity, but not a singular one. See http://blog.sciencewomen.com/2007/07/victorian-woman-doctors.html.
“Well,” he said, “It’s a pity, but I have done what I could. I know every move of your game. You can do nothing before Monday. This is a duel between us, Mr. Holmes. You hope to place me in the dock. I tell you that I will never stand there. You plan to beat me. I shall not be beaten. If I were to be ruined, I should bring ruin on you at once.”
“Playing? At what?”
“You mean you’ve accepted your nature. You wouldn’t be ashamed,” he said, feeling his way, “to be known for it.”
A mouse had died behind the ancient, rusted-in heating vent on a frigid week in January, and festered there, till the entire building smelled of it. We couldn’t pry the vent cover off. It took the combined efforts of Mrs. Hudson (with biscuits to sustain us), Mr. Chatterjee, and me (persistent despite my bleeding knuckles) to free the despicable thing. Triumphant at last, I’d carried the corpse downstairs to be disposed of; had returned to find Sherlock kneeling there, eyes shining with determination and a screwdriver shoved between her teeth while she wrestled the vent cover back into place. Her teeshirt was sleeveless, her bare arms beautiful; that, I believe, influenced me considerably, but the worst of it was the coveralls she’d put on at some point out of, I assume, the idea that the costume made the handyman. Seeing her in them made me want to climb into her lap.
"John," Sherlock said, in his darkest, richest voice. "You're here for my pleasure. You're spread open, held, ready to be used. Feel your ass opening up to me. I want to see you well mounted on it, filling your hole, spitting you and making you grunt. Can you feel that? Very good, John, you're taking this very well, you were made for this, you were made to be used, weren't you? A little virgin, just a toy who hasn't been played with, something for me to pick up and use. You were made to be used, John, your asshole wants filling, you're squirming now as you feel me pushing into you, deep into you, stretching your hole, making you ready. Oh, you liked that, didn't you?"
John made himself comfortable with his head on Sherlock's knees, easing position, feeling the dildo thick inside him. Sherlock had bought a harness for him, and with delightfully conscientious regularity, John was fastened bottom up in a kind of folding structure - surprisingly solid - that rendered him unable to move even an inch, and Sherlock inserted increasingly fatter, longer dildos in him, and told him gloatingly how stretched he was, how much more he was taking every day. When John's hole was unplugged, he felt empty and fluttering inside. He knew he couldn't wear a plug when they were out and about, but more and more he was thinking of when they came home, of when Sherlock told his toy to get into position for stuffing, and made him beg for each inch more.
John swallowed, almost not words left in him. "Yes," he got out. "Yes, yes."
"I had already made an arrangement to meet the individual I intended to use tonight. It wouldn't have been good practice to cancel unless it was an emergency. Generally I lose them," Sherlock added a little grumpily, "because they get irked when I have to cancel because it
"Can't you just bloody deduce it, genius?"
the hotel last month, had to text him to let him know I'd be late, and then he sent me a very peevish email informing me he'd waited all night and he was blocking me everywhere."
He waited, and Sherlock didn't ask him. John wasn't even sure any more if he knew when Sherlock was going out to use other men.
The naked man suddenly, evidently, realised someone was there. He jerked his head back and said, in a panicked, choking voice "Jelly bean!"
After some time John could not measure, Sherlock called "John?"
"Yes," John called back.
A very complicated, deep shudder happened inside John.
Sherlock had gone out.
"Oh yes, you would," said Sherlock, still in that deep rough voice. "You're convenient, John. You're a good toy. I like using you. But I won't deal with a toy who wants me to use just him, because - " and his voice changed, lighter, more assessing - "I've been through this before. You're not a toy. You can think and feel, and you have your own needs. You won't accept that the way I use you is all I want from you. If you want only me, you'd want more from me. You can't have that. You want to be used by me right now, don't you?"
"Come on, then, toy."
the idea of wearing a permanent mark that hurt you to get."
"No," Sherlock said. "Were you safewording?"
"Strip," Sherlock said.
He couldn't. He literally couldn't. John struggled and would have fallen in an undignified huddle, but Sherlock kept him upright and then swung him round til his chest was on the floor and his legs upright and his arms locked behind him.
Sherlock pulled him up to a kneeling position. He was still fully clothed, John realised dazedly. "Now open your mouth, John," the dark rich voice said, and John did, and he didn't see Sherlock opening his own clothes but the long dick was in his mouth, and John tasted condom and was disappointed, but Sherlock thrust and John opened his jaws wide and choked and sobbed and hardly breathed and felt Sherlock come, pulsing thick inside the condom.
"Don't waste my time, John. Come." He pushed upwards, gently, and John's cock rubbed against Sherlock's trouser-leg, his balls rubbing against Sherlock's shoe. "Come
"You're going to take that severed hand in the fridge back to Barts before I do any more shopping for food."
"Yes."
John picked up a book, and tried to read it. He didn't get very far. He didn't hear anything more from downstairs, until - half an hour later - the violin music switched off.
Sherlock shook his head. "John," he said, and unexpectedly, it was in that deep-as-sex purring voice he used when he had John tied up. "Think this through. I enjoy using you. You enjoy being used by me. But as you must already have noticed, I have a very precise set of requirements to get me off. I don't need anything else. You'd get bored, John, and I'd lose a very convenient mouth."
Sherlock was in his bedroom before John could manage to get to his feet. He staggered a bit as he went to the staircase to his room. He was hugely, almost scarily, turned on.
Sherlock wasn't capable of the kind of denial he saw other people tell themselves, about their desires and their needs. He recognised facts. He'd just learned something new about himself. He'd never known he could get turned on by something so mundane. By having John lick his hands, by pushing food into John's mouth.  He never did this to the men he used, but John had earned it: Sherlock reached down and gently clasped John's prick with the hand he had fed John with. He stroked the prick unhurriedly, looking at John's mouth. "You can come now," he told him, and John did, spraying Sherlock's hand and the bathwater indiscriminately, and looking like a study in pink steamy bliss.
"Are you going to brand me?" John said immediately.
And John could go directly from discovering he had this turn-on to getting to experience it for real, no strings attached.
"Yes," he said.
Except that those six scenes with Sherlock - bondage, dildos, Sherlock fucking his mouth til he came, and then seeing to it that John came too - were clear and burning in his memory. They were wank fodder - of course: but when John realised he was fantasising about being on the floor of 221b Baker Street with Sherlock standing over him in order to be able to come when he was having sex with a perfectly nice nurse, he felt - weird.
John was clutching the teacup as if it was a rescue float in a rough sea. He felt giddy and breathless. He croaked "Do they know about each other?"
"Oh, very good," Sherlock said. He sounded genuinely pleased. He bent John over with a push. The spreader bar at his ankles was forcing his buttocks apart. Sherlock crouched down behind him, and John felt the cold wet brush of lubricant at his anus. John gritted his teeth. He had no intention of safewording out this time, but he felt awkward, cold, unaroused, and anticipated discomfort.
Over the next few months, Sherlock asked John what his safeword was five times.  Once, when John was planning to go out on a date with Penelope, he said no, and the other four times he said yes.
John stared off out of the window. It was a rainy night. He really ought to say "no," and then "thanks for the tea" and then "good night, Sherlock, see you in the morning".
"Would have been faster if you'd just made use of me."
Sherlock checked angles, and moved the low table. Perfect.
"You don't need to get laid," John said. "You've just solved a case."
"If he gets off on being verbally humiliated I'm quite willing to indulge him, though he needs to be very clear about his trigger words." Sherlock paused. He was staring at John very intently. His voice got darker, rougher. "Some men get off on being told they're greedy cocksluts. Or that they're squirming pigs just begging to be filled. Or they like being told they're whores."
I had not meant to feel for Mary. I had hoped (when I thought of her at all) to be distantly courteous regarding her, and never see her. I did not want to grieve for her. There was nothing I desired less than to comprehend precisely what she wanted from John Watson. I had long accepted that love made a fool of most, and a goblin of me. I wanted unforgivable things, things that would ruin me, things that would repulse him. But his tender, wistful tone when he’d talked of what she felt—he honoured the sentiment; and just then I could not remember why I was required to despise it in myself.
He didn't have an eidetic memory, but he had a pretty good grasp of visual detail, and he could see that scene like he was looking at a photograph. The man had been youngish - younger than Sherlock - blond, pretty fit. He'd been tied with meticulous care in a bondage harness made out of rope. There was something sticking out between his buttocks - probably the end of a butt plug. And Sherlock Holmes had a mouthwateringly gigantic cock.
There is a stoat’s burrow in the riverbank, out beyond the university. He has made himself quite a small hole, close to the waterline. Periodically he emerges, slips into the river and busies himself therein with stoaty past-times. He does not seem to mind me. I am very quiet; I sit still atop a log, with my hat in my hands, and breathe softly. The gnats and dragonflies hover over the water, but do not bother me. I have gone there daily since I discovered the place. I often do a little rambling early in the morning while the town is still abed.
Please pass Mrs. Hudson and my brother my gratitude for feeding you, and taking up the duty of your care which I am egregiously neglecting.
The words were shockingly harsh, but his expression was lost and wild; and I saw one thing clearly: he had not understood me at all.
The firelight shone a radiance round about him as he stood there, with such an expression in his eyes. He went on, softly, "But we are left to settle what is between us, anyway. The fact remains that he can't harm us any more, not lawfully, not in England; not a man in the court would believe his word against ours, now, thanks to you."
“Cards.” Blunt misery in his voice—I heard it, and suddenly I saw the facts fitting themselves together.
“That’s right,” she said. “You do take care of one another. That’s as it should be. Ring the bell, then, if you need me, and send your washing down when you’ve unpacked.”
He scoffed at that, and stood, looking down at me, with a discomfiting expression. “Money can be lost any number of ways, too, or haven’t you ever come to the end of yours? Have you always been so sure of it?”
“All right,” I said, surprised. His lashes had fluttered closed as I continued to stroke his hair, his forehead, his dark brows, and I was struck with the need to bend and kiss each delicate eyelid in turn, and then the corners of his beautiful mouth, before I continued, “I was reading an article on the common prescription of lobelia in treating the asthmatic. Doctor Salter is suspicious of its popularity; he suggests cigarettes, or Indian hemp.” I went on talking to him, any ordinary nonsense that came into my head, until he was nearly asleep in my lap, the candle guttering on the table, the house fallen silent save for the sound of my voice; and then I said, “Sherlock. Come on, darling, come to bed.”
You don’t understand what it is like to love you—which, by the by, I have also done for years already; it isn’t a feeling but a fact—nor do you comprehend what a miracle you are to me. You are too secretive, and damnably unwilling to care for yourself as you should, but that will never make me tire of loving you.
A scandalised sound emerged from under the pillows. “I wouldn’t fling acid-covered evidence about in the sitting room,” she said, muffled, but firm. “Really, you should know that.”
I had wrapped myself close about him. I said into his shoulder, "Yes," and then, finding it easier to speak in the dark, "I missed you the more because you were so near me here. Nearer even than you had been at Baker Street. I wanted to make the memory true."
“I haven’t seen him yet,” I said. Something must have sounded in my tone, for Mycroft’s brow went up again, and he leaned forward.
I had come to London for my chance like the rest, but I had always had money at home, and wasn’t heedful of it. Even on finding myself a poor student buried in the bowels of the city, living on the smallest stipend, supping on porridge and sausages, I had known that if it came to it Mycroft would not actually let me starve. Over the years I did fret a bit at the bareness of my lodgings. Among the many things that had made me glad to meet John Watson, I’d been delighted to go halves on better rooms, with heat and light enough in them. But I’d had no doubt of getting up in the world, sooner or later.
John,
“I was wrong. Forgive me. Alone, you could disguise yourself and attend with less risk.”
“No.” Not nearly obvious enough. “Not at all: I’ve only noticed just this minute, and I ought to have known you were sad when you walked in. Watson, tell me.”
After a moment he began again, “So then—” just as I said, “I’ve been packing my bag. I was leaving.”
The first bullet hit him in the shoulder, the second in his arm. He gave a cry, dropped his sidearm and stumbled, and I rushed him, meaning to fling him back upon the ground and secure him. He struggled my grasp a long moment. Desperation made him strong. Then, bleeding and gasping, he wrenched himself from my grasp, unbalanced and went over.
“Yes.” Sherlock looked as though he were in pain. “Thank you, Mycroft. I suppose--that is sufficient information. We can’t go to the wedding, of course. It wouldn’t be safe.”
A smile lit his face, and was gone, leaving behind an expression of such deep intent that I could no longer look at him. I dropped my gaze to my hand as he took it up in his gentle one, and slid the cool, heavy little ring onto my smallest finger.
“Oh, no.” She came around to arrange herself on the stool beside me, finger the stem of her blue iced something-in-a-glass and eye me. “I should say, it’s obvious to a woman.”
“I like you very much,” was all I could say. “Please continue.”
The only light in the room came from the lamp on the table; the only window stood beside it. We could be reached quickest that way. His expression grew more concerned as he watched me sidle round the edge of the room, keeping close to the wall, and fling the shutters closed, and bolt them. I bolted the door, too, on my return.
“Not like this,” I said. “Not having friendly, civilised dinners with him and his lover, talking over their future.”
"You said, 'We,'" he said, returning to take my hand into his own warm one again, and dab off the blood with a sure touch. "If you and I go together, I can have no possible objection."
(See the end of the chapter for
I was lying on the bed, smoking. I said to my stockinged feet, "I'm not afraid of you."
“I thought I was ruined at Maiwand.”
A sound escaped me at that. He glanced up at me, surprised. He must have thought me uncharacteristically pained to the heart on Mrs. Watson’s behalf. His brow contracted; he leaned forward, and under that look it began to be difficult to breathe. I held his gaze with all my strength: it seemed the worst possible time for my practiced serenity to fail, but it was faltering badly. Thank God, he did not understand. “I’ve said too much,” he said, after a moment’s earnest scrutiny of me, and sat back, releasing me from the effect of his bright, worried eyes. “Forgive me, this is precisely the irrational kind of tragedy you might have expected for me when I indulged in the absurdity of marriage. You did warn me.”
All at once I was waking to him watching me. The fire had died down, the shadows changed; and he was there beside me, lying propped up on his elbow. His expression was a study in conflicting emotions.
He stopped, taken aback by my laughter. But to see him stammer over me! He is master of all things, except what is between us. It is satisfying.
I did think his behaviour strange sometimes. Even after we’d settled in, and taken the measure of one another’s worst habits, and seen one another in our stocking-feet, he seemed embarrassed to ask me what I did for work—a delicacy of manners, on his part, past my understanding. Nor would he admit that he had nothing extra to spend beyond his share of the rent. I didn’t guess he was actually penniless till he’d refused my fourth proposal of an evening out in favor of another of Mrs. Hudson's plentiful but quite unremarkable suppers. And how he ate those suppers! As though he’d never had such food before, and might never again. He grew agitated when I refused to come to the table, or came only to pick at my plateful, and sip at the coffee, and satisfy myself with bread and butter.
I had expected the musty chill of three months’ disuse in my chamber, but instead the room smelled of lavender and washing-soap, and the ashes of a fire not long gone out. The curtains were drawn, but as I opened them, the sills revealed were clean. My poker was stained with ash at the tip. My dressing-gown was hung over the backboard, neatly folded. Mrs. Hudson had kept it all ready for me, as though I might come home at any minute.
Molly grinned, suddenly, and shoved out from under his arm.
So things continued. We lived together, and worked together more and more: I found it brightened him up, and that brightened me up. The black moods I’d always been prone to lost half their force under the influence of his attention; my hardest cases came clear twice as quickly with him near. And then he went on writing about us, which was flattering to my feelings as well as to his pocketbook, for the stories kept on selling. He began to be able to go out with me for a little music and a drink, now and again. He began to look at me longer, and to sit nearer to me in the evenings; and I thought we were making headway. I thought we could be happy.
“Holmes,” he said, when I did not speak. He looked far too brave.
Over lunch he behaved like his ordinary self, but consciously; as though he were determined to amuse us both. I allowed myself to be amused, half in relief that he was finally with me, half in homage to the effort he was making: I had known the day would be difficult. But he kept me out with him for hours, between food, and banter, and drinks, and a stop over at a book shop, and a side excursion for a fresh pig’s liver, on the way home--I thought it better not to inquire into that. When we arrived in Baker Street again the sun had sunk halfway toward the horizon. The city was bathed in light.
Again, he had left out Sherrinford Holmes. I let it pass. “Was it difficult for you?”
I have been back to our rooms, at Mrs. Hudson's urging—she's fed me more than one Sunday dinner. And I have been with your brother, too. Supposedly we are plotting, but I think he's mostly only humouring me; there's so little of substance I can contribute. He makes me stay to tea anyway, and indulges me in conversation about you.
I caught up my cane as he bent and scribbled out a missive upon his desk, and did up my collar as he sealed it. We went down together. At the foot of the stairs, he rung for Billy and ordered him to have the note over to the Diogenes at once. I minded my business, an occupation I am well practiced in. When he wanted me to know, I’d know.
Whatever he had feared or suspected, that was not it. He blinked, and blinked again.
“Oh.” Surprise lit his face. He set aside the notebook. “In that case, yes. I’ve found some help at last.”
“Marry you.”
“You never tell me anything. Is this why—? Holmes, loneliness isn’t madness. You’re all right. You’re quite sane.”
Our breakfast came and was after cleared away without disturbing his reverie, though he shifted at last from his wandering songs into a fiercer, wilder melody, something like a battle in the offing. I leaned back in my chair, and closed my eyes, and dreamed the fight with him, until at last he finished up with a sudden, decisive sound and an audible “Ha!” I sat up, to see him lay down the instrument, and turn about for his hat.
"He's desperate. His work is in shambles, his name ruined, his men in custody, his livelihood forfeit. He cannot go home to England. If you go back, you will be safe from him." I was having trouble keeping my voice down.
Mycroft's read, AM WELL IN SPITE OF APPEARANCES STOP FURTHER DETAILS FORTHCOMING VIA USUAL CHANNELS STOP. I hoped my brother had not been frightened. I forgot sometimes that I was really all he had in the world, but being alone myself just then, I felt it suddenly and keenly.
“Family’s family,” she conceded, but doubtfully. John Watson clearly came before Mycroft in both our minds.
On the third evening, the telegram came: the whole of Moriarty’s company, of any significance, was in custody. But Moriarty had escaped.
"What was that?" he demanded. My laugh made him more suspicious: he stared at me, and then suddenly looked down at the little gold ring on his own smallest finger (placed there by me privately some years before). When he looked up again his expression had changed entirely; his eyes shone bright and very blue.
After a half-hour’s lively debate over composers past and present, and the merits of various instruments (for which I stayed silent, but happily), Cox quite unexpectedly fetched a beautiful little Spanish guitar from another room, and played for us a while. Sherrinford watched with a softness which better recommended them both to me, since I have often watched Holmes at his violin with just the same feeling. After, I remembered Mycroft had mentioned they kept dogs, and asked to see the kennels; and that removed any remaining stiffness between us. Sherlock raced and tussled the dogs about, and tested their training, and asked after all the details of their puppyhood, and Sherrinford answered him with a light in his eye which was very good to see. Sherlock ended up coming away in a pair of Sherrinford’s trousers, having muddied his irreparably in the kennel-yard. As we boarded the train-carriage toward London in the gloaming, he was smiling to himself. I believe we will visit them again.
“Hm?” He looked up at me, smiling, dark-eyed in the low light, and my heart dropped down to my toes, because how was I ever going to find words? But maybe–maybe I should just try for the impossible, anyway. I tugged on his hand again, pulled him up off the stool and said, “Come outside.”
“So,” Mycroft said, after fresh tea arrived, and we had each taken a steaming cup. He settled himself into a padded rolling chair moved up before the fire, with a sigh. “Something rather dire has occurred, disturbing you, Sherlock, to the extent that you came here without warning, and brought the Doctor for support; but it is not so distressing that you would refuse refreshments, or shout out the news of it on your arrival. I conclude there is no immediate threat. Shall I deduce further what is troubling you? Or shall you tell me yourself?”
I said, “I do love you. I love you,” and then, “Heaven help me,” and I seized the strong hand that held my arm and brought it almost to my lips. I could do it; he would not stop me. I let him go. “Leave, then. I can’t bear this either.” And then I lost my breath again at his expression.
“What?”
“God, no. I never wanted to.” If I had been a woman, would I have been forced to watch romantic movies? Would I have wanted to? “What is it about them?”
He turned to Sherlock. “Take care of yourself,” he said, and shook his hand too. “Or at least let the Doctor do it.”
“If it's not the thoughts, is it a feeling that's stopping you?”
“You have me,” I repeated. I could not resist drawing near to him, holding my hands out to him, pleading as I rarely would. “As far as it depends on me. I should like to keep you with me. Will you allow me?”
I’d never seen Mycroft speechless. I no longer found the Stalinesque office intimidating, and I’d faced down a hundred versions of his poker face, but this was new. At first I thought he was angry, and then I thought he didn’t believe me, and finally I realized he actually looked moved, and uncomfortable about it. Well, I never can predict him. I don’t even think Sherlock can. “Anyway,” I said, “I wanted to tell you first. Before the CCTV team tracked us kissing somewhere in a back alley and you took out a hit on me.” Not even a pained grimace in response to the humour. He was still just looking at me. “I swear I’ll take care of him.”
“I think so. I’ll keep an eye on him.”
“I didn’t know.” Sherlock sounded flustered, but very pleased. I sat down on the top step and sighed. I could suffer a little embarrassment for that tone.
“Oh?” I sat up, and found I didn’t know what to do with my hands. I folded them, and did my best to offer him a courteous expression of interest.
I could not find a thought with which to object. I ate all of my beef, and drank two cups of tea, without really noticing the taste. Then I was shepherded to my room by Will. There was a beautiful fire made up in the grate. The counterpane was large and soft. I had enough presence of mind to wait until Will had gone to remove my outer clothes and crawl like a child into bed.
“Yes.”
“Tell me about it. Tell me something real.”
My heart gave a sudden, hard leap in my chest, but I followed him, schooling my breath. Where did all this leave us? What did he mean to do?
“Then what?” I said, and pushed myself slowly out of the chair (old man, I am) to kiss him.
“But you want to go. To see them. You could get a grasp on all this if you see them.” It was clear, now. “Go without me.”
She turned to me. “Is he all right?” Our landlady is the soul of loyalty, but not uninquisitive.
“Clearly. Yes.” A soft, tumbled head of curls poked up a little; the owner of the curls peeked over her sad bare shoulder at me. “Must we talk about it?”
“And the wedding itself?”
“I never saw him again,” he agreed, slowly.
I swallowed; nodded my assent.
He was at a loss for words, but I saw the truth in his face; he’d meant it just as he said it, and all at once I felt like weeping. “What, at the club, with a priest, and a crowd?” I asked, more softly; laid a hand on his cheek.
The day the letter came, and the change began, was less than a year into our affair. The whole thing seemed miraculous to me, and yet to anyone’s eye we would have appeared the same as ever. Only behind closed doors, and in the quiet of the night, was everything new. A mizzling fog had crept over the city, rendering the cold grey outdoors inhospitable, the glow of the hearth wholly heart-warming. Holmes and I had already passed several very comfortable hours settled in our chairs before a roaring fire, in the homely half-light of a stormy day, with books and tea and hot buttered toast, when the bell rang. Mrs. Hudson’s voice could be heard answering, and a minute later Billy thundered up (his enthusiasm indicating excessive boredom belowstairs) and rapped sharply at the sitting room door.
I am safe, and have had no trouble. I’d like to give someone trouble. It rankles me that there is nothing I can do for you.
He drew a breath at that, and followed it with, “My dear John,” in quite a new tone. He had brightened at last; in fact he was fairly shining at me. All at once he crossed to the bed, lifted my face in his hands, and kissed my forehead soundly; released me, and said, “I do love you.” Then he left me there.
My John,
“No. Yes. No, I—am rather poor company just now. Defeated, and angry. Hardly the right frame of mind for this.” He blushed as he said it, but he looked me in the eye.
“My dear boy,” I said, keeping myself calm with a considerable effort. “I have learned, all in one night, that you have another brother, with a lover of his own, of whom you never speak; and that some men like us marry publicly, before God and man. I am shocked. That does not in any way prove that I consider you and I, and everything we do, anything less than sacred.”
"I had a run-in with a rough on the way here," I said. "And that was the third attempt on my life to-day. We can't stay here."
“Good Lord,” said Mycroft, mildly, when I limped into his study covered in brick dust and mud. He was seated at his desk, the curtains behind him half-drawn. The hush in the room, even at midday, was absolute. It always felt in those rooms as though the rest of the world had ceased to be, not extant, exactly, but imminent in any meaningful way: it was sanctuary.
“For you.”
A minute’s silence. Then, “His death? I don’t know. Yes, I suppose it was. To be orphaned, even at twenty-five--but I didn’t think of that then. Mycroft handled the particulars; all that was required of me was to attend the funeral, and keep my temper with aunts and neighbors who meant to be sympathetic.”
His whole face changed. “Do you think she would think so? She mustn’t. But to admit I’ve never found my way to love her as I ought—I promised her everything!” His eyes were filling up with grief. “There must be some way to help myself—a specialist, a chemical aid, a treatment of some kind. I ought to try. She is good to me.” He looked at me, pleading, and my heart sank. What he wanted seemed unlikely. If a help for this kind of problem existed, would the creator not be known? Wouldn’t John have heard of it already in the course of his studies? But I was not a doctor; and I had never sought a medical correction to the course of my own development.
“Marry me?” I demanded.
“Quite. It grew pleasanter as we went on, and I supposed when we came together the joy would follow, but—” A deep sigh. A slight shake of his golden head. “I don’t much enjoy it. I find I have to distract myself from what I'm doing. I think—” A peep at me, at last, to see how I was taking it. “I believe I’m deficient somehow.”
“Apart from the grooms?”
My dear William,
“Seven years older than I. Two older than Mycroft.”
“Yes, thanks.” He smiled at me again. I turned away quickly to hide a surge of gratitude so strong it frightened me. When he added, curiously, “Anything to do?” I couldn’t answer; only shook my head, and poured out his drink with a hand that was not steady.
Mrs. Hudson stopped us in the entry. “This came,” she said, holding up another letter. He took the envelope from her and disappeared up the stairs without a backward look.
Sometime after midnight I was woken from a dreamless sleep by Mendelssohn’s Lieder being played below, slowly and tenderly; as he had always played it for me, from the start.
His eyes were solemn. “I’ve written it,” he said, and I struggled to think what he could mean. “The letter,” he added, when I didn’t speak. “To my brother. Refusing the invitation. Perhaps--you could read it over for me? Tell me if it’s reasonable.”
“I don’t know! That’s why I’m asking you!” It was almost a shout. Ella had nodded.
I was in sight of No. 221 when I became fully conscious that I was being pursued, as when a sound outside a dream suddenly startles one into the waking world. I had noticed, without knowing I noticed, a man coming through the crowds on the other sidewalk some way back, small, sturdy, his hat pulled down over his forehead. His clothes were all dark. He walked quickly, with a definite aim. I noticed all this properly for the first time as I realised that he was crossing the street, his gaze fixed on me. I began to think where I could throw my violin case and my carpetbag, if I had to run for it, so as not to harm the Strad. But now the door was approaching; and I reached it, and pulled hard on the bell, just as my pursuer gained the sidewalk on my side some ten yards behind.
“And he lives here?”
“I mean that you need to move out. Not—not forever. I hope.” It was quite terribly obvious that he might never come back, once I had him out. This could take months, or worse; and he was not a man who ought to live alone. If I sent him off lonely, someone else would soon love him—
“He didn’t touch you?” Suddenly I was breathless.
“Ha!” He turned to me fully at last, with a spark of something in his gaze--not humour; perhaps irony. “The latter explanation contains the former, my dear boy. His bride is called Alfred, and the club represents all the family they own.”
“Respect you! Watson, I think the world of you.”
“I don’t actually think it‘s weakened me. I don’t even think we’re going to get jumped in the streets. Maybe we would have, in secondary, but not - it’s not likely now, not anymore, and that’s a risk, the way we live, anyway. Someone could come after us for any number of reasons. I might as well add another and hold his hand, then, right? I might as well. I will.”
Which brought me sharply to the inevitable: I had to tell John, and then I had to get him away. He could not remain with me. He might not want to, after this. I could, very probably, have Moriarty in court in the end. He was very well-equipped in his chosen life, but so was I. But it would take time and there would be risks, enormous risks involved. If I let John be brought into it he would end in Reading Gaol in a heap of refuse with irons on his legs, and I would break my heart or lose my head, and the game would be up. So: John had to be removed from play.
“A brick flung from a rooftop,” I said, while his gaze traveled over my dirty trousers, “meant to brain me, but it missed and shattered at my feet. And a carriage tried to run me down.” The limp was the consequence of that. I had flung myself out of the way, barely in time, and jarred my knee badly on the paving stones. I’d given up foot-travel, then, and taken a cab the rest of the way to Pall Mall.
“I’m at your service.” I didn’t move; I didn’t want to disturb whatever delicate sense of safety had formed around us. His voice, when he spoke, was steady and low.
He raised his head, and looked at me. I had never spoken so to him; but he had never been quite so trusting with me before, and it had brought my heart to my lips. He took me in, and then his face contracted as though in pain, and he hid his face in my waist-coat like a child.
Alone, I lay back and smiled at the ceiling; laughed a little more. Paramour, indeed.
I had to agree, though I knew our solutions would be irreconcilable. “Have you any suggestion to make?” I asked.
Now he hears the water turn on, and John singing in the bath, off-key, something he remembers hearing on the radio in uni. They have plans: brunch, at the new place down the road. He’ll need to be at least minimally put-together. He puts on pants and silk socks and a decent pair of trousers, buttons up a soft blue shirt that makes John stroke his shoulders; runs his hands through his hair, once, twice, looking at himself in the mirror. There’s a little smile on his face he hadn’t noticed. He pads into the kitchen and gets a cup of water, rinses out his mouth; goes into the sitting room, does up his shoes. Picks up his violin and plays, little mindless ripples of music, like running water.
“I had been very angry with them both, Mycroft for leaving us, Sherrinford for involving himself with a boy without position or protection. The servant could have been beggared had my father not decided to keep it all quiet, for our reputation’s sake. I found it hard to look Sherrinford in the face. Through his fault I had lost both my brothers and any sense of security. By that time I knew--I understood what Sherrinford had seen in the boy. I could see it too.” He broke off again and swallowed. I had not discovered my own nature until years later. I tried and failed to imagine having kept such a secret, in growing fear, at fifteen.
Finally I gave due consideration to her silent, defiant door. Had she behaved that way six months, even six weeks ago, I’d have shrugged, made a cuppa and gone on about my evening, but now—well. Now I had seen Sherlock Holmes in coveralls, and I was a changed woman.
“No. I felt ashamed because I thought you might.”
“Come in,” said my boy, muzzily, from behind a fragile and enormous map of old Yorkshire, dated 1774, which he was studying for purposes as yet undisclosed but apparently enthralling.
“Well, yes.”
“Till death,” he repeated, and kissed the finger slowly. Then he took the book from my hand, and read out, “With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow--although they were yours already. So we are joined together, and I dare any man to put us asunder.” And he looked up at me then, and said, “I believe that makes us husbands.”
“It’s well written, of course,” I said at last. I was feeling my way. “But if it were a stranger’s letter, I’d say it was coolly phrased. I don’t mean to suggest it ought to be different. I assume he expects no more.”
“Never,” I agreed, moved to a whisper, “John—”
William
“There is almost material enough to convince a British jury evident in the actual facts,” said the cool lines, “but I am prepared to furnish you with several men of good, ordinary, honest-seeming quality, who will testify to the intimacies required to infer the act itself between Watson and Holmes.”
“John,” I said, but words deserted me, and he turned his face up to the ceiling and laughed aloud. His hand crept about my arm and squeezed it. The heat of it went right through me.
I thought you were dead for five days. I nearly broke my heart over it. Please understand me—I am extraordinarily glad that you are safe away, that you saw your chance and took it. I only wish you would have warned me.
“If you will be in attendance, to begin with.”
I saw satisfaction settle over him at my surrender. He nodded, and stood. "Come on, then," he said, "let's go upstairs. I have some things to say to you."
William
When he had gone, I sank into my chair, and tried to collect myself, but it was no use; my blood was up. After a few minutes of deep breaths and blank silence, in imitation of the sages of the East who seek enlightenment, which attempt merely made me intimately acquainted with the anxiety possessing me, I sprang up. There was another way to free myself from myself. I went into my room, and collected my boxing gloves from under the bed; stripped to the waist, and removed my slippers and stockings, and began a methodical pummeling of the old-fashioned punching ball which stood beside my bed. After a few minutes of this the rhythm got into my blood and bones and all the whirlpool of my mind drained into that single point of focus, the drum-drum-drum of fists against leather. The cool of the room soothed the heat in me; the sweat ran down my face; and the fear subsided.
“Paramour!”
Quick anger in his look; blank weariness after. “No, Holmes. I’m going to talk to her.”
A slow breath, beside me; the hand over mine tightened. “I am sorry,” he said, and then he turned into my shoulder at last, and hid his face in my neck. I drew him in; held him against me, and stroked his back, and kissed his temple, the pulse in his sweet neck, the curve of his slender shoulder. Angry as I was, I knew he loved me. I knew that he was afraid, and that there were things at work that I did not understand.
“No, it’s -” He’d hesitated, turning inward, searching himself. After a long moment, he’d looked up, startled, comprehending. “It’s fear of going soft. It’s - I’m afraid that I won’t be able to protect him. If I'm turning into the kind of man who’d hold a man’s hand on the street. That kind of sentimental, soft - lacking sense. Unaware - That I'll be useless if someone decides to go after us while my guard's down. But that’s - ” He’d stopped again. Revelation is a beautiful look on John. “That’s nonsense. I don’t believe that.”
“It’s very old,” he said. “Seventeenth century.”
“Do it,” said a voice at my elbow. Molly. I turned.
“Have I neglected you?” he said.
The week that went by after was a continual revelation; nothing was different, and yet I felt new. I wished with all my heart that someone, anyone could know how I loved him. That I was his. And yet I supposed that all England knew it, really. They knew he was the best and brightest thing in the world to me. They had read everything I’d written for him. It was only convention that kept them from understanding it.
Moriarty found us. John has written about it, since; but he has made it all different from what it was. We had set out together from the hostel to see the Reichenbach cataract, arm in arm, but he'd began to lag as the path up toward the falls grew steeper. When a messenger came, begging for John to return to the last night's quarters and help a dying lodger, I was glad for his sake that he should turn back; he needed a little rest. I was glad for the patient, too, to have so steady a hand to steer them toward Death's farther shore. I am not the infallible creature of my John’s fairy tales. I did not expect danger just then. I did not meant to get him out of the way; he would have wanted that least of anything. He would have wished to be there when Moriarty found me. "Good-bye," he called to me, as he started down the trail; "don't start any trouble without me."
Sherlock's hand stopped moving. John glanced up. Sherlock was looking at him with deep astonishment. "You like the idea," he said. He wasn't using his sex voice. He was deducing. "You want me to mark you. To make yourself permanently, ineradicably mine. You're not a masochist, but you're even looking forward to the pain. Not bracing yourself for it. You
"I will," John said, with certainty. "I want to be
When the door opened, he realised Sherlock was back early. Sherlock didn't greet him. He came over to the table beside the stand, and there was another click. The alarm was off. Sherlock released the clips that held him to the stand, and helped John up, with impersonal hands. Sherlock looked relaxed and satisfied.
John wanted to be used. He wanted to feel Sherlock's prick in him, fucking his mouth, fucking his arse. He was greedy for it. Pig. That same deep complicated shudder overcame him, all the stronger for not being able to move. Pig. Sherlock always knew the right words.
"Can you stay there for the next half hour?" Sherlock said.
"No."
"Don't come in!" John said hastily.
The fantasy of being used by Sherlock was still clear in his mind (even if, after three wanks, he wasn't getting hard over it any more) but it would stay a fantasy. Even if Sherlock actually made it happen, it would still be a fantasy.
"No," Sherlock said. He stood up. "I want to put you in the breeding stand."
Sherlock sat down on the couch, used his laptop for about quarter of an hour - he didn't speak, and John was quite comfortable. Sherlock got up, put his coat on - John could hear that - and spread some newspapers underneath John, without speaking to him. He pinched John on one of his buttocks, almost fondly. "Have a good evening, pig," he said, and leaned over. "Remember - me, Mrs Hudson, Mycroft." There was a click. "The alarm is now on," Sherlock said, and left the room.
John started taking his clothes off. He felt very cold suddenly. Not in the least turned on. Was this even a good idea? He had two more chances if he backed out from this one. He folded his shirt, and placed it on the chair. Then his jeans. He was shivering now.
He texted John an hour later, and John found himself caught up in the case and chasing after Sherlock, and it was as if it had never happened. Perhaps for Sherlock, John thought coldly, it had not. He supposed that if he only had the strength of mind to say "No" twice more, he already knew Sherlock wouldn't ask again after that.
"What did you say your safeword was?"
What if Sherlock did a scene with him once and he was "performance unsatisfactory" and Sherlock never wanted to have him again? (Then they'd just never do it again.)
"Of course, I'll let you out when you use the safeword," Sherlock told him.
Mycroft never had to know.
A few minutes later, John was out of the chains. The handcuffs went back in Sherlock's pocket, the shackles were kicked back under the chair. By the time John had recovered enough from the stickiness of the afterglow, the dildos were out of sight (he later found the one Sherlock had used on him soaking in a bucket of bleach in the bathroom) and Sherlock had dropped a blanket from the couch over him.
He really had. Even though Sherlock had monstrously overfed him, and John was probably feeling bloated - this hadn't worked at all as revenge. John had loved it too much. Sherlock realised he didn't care. It was strangely interesting to know that if he wanted to get aroused, he could do so by ordering John to his knees, mouth open, and making him eat from Sherlock's hands.
"I use various male-only dating sites. I sometimes post an ad, but I also look out for a specific kind of advertiser. What I am looking for is a man who enjoys extreme submission or humiliation, bondage, anal insertions, oral sex, and fucking. I like it if they also get off on a certain amount of pain, but I'm not a very dedicated sadist. Once located, we talk on the phone, then arrange to meet - I invariably use a hotel room for a first meeting, I find it lends reassurance to my target. We meet, I outline in detail what I intend to do to him, watching his reactions, and we arrange a safeword. He has the option of rope bondage or handcuffs and shackles. My preference is handcuffs, though I'm quite skilled at rope bondage. I have him choose the dildo I'll use to penetrate him. If he agrees to let me chain him up, of course the keys are left where he could, at need, use them to release himself. Can you guess why I prefer handcuffs, John?"
John came. His come splattered Sherlock's leg, and Sherlock grinned. "Messy toy," he said, almost sounding fond, and took his foot away.
John took his clothes off. Sherlock watched. Naked, John glanced down at the shackles. Sherlock came over to him. He was still fully dressed, and his coat still felt cold from the outside air. Sherlock wrapped him in his arms: not a hug. Sherlock had him immobilised. John squirmed, just to feel Sherlock's arms close more firmly about him.
John made the kind of "oh" face, that said he was relegating Sherlock's situation with Mycroft as something like  his own situation with his alcoholic sister, and that infuriated Sherlock, abruptly, silently. He took the phone away from John. "Did you finish placing the order?" he asked him.
John stared at the stand, and his jaw dropped a little, and his cock twitched, and his hands moved on his thighs. He was obviously picturing himself fastened into it.
"What?"
"Well - "
Sherlock composed new ads for the sex sites every month or so. He had just posted his latest version on three legal sites and one darkweb site, when he saw that all four were showing him the same ad - picking up on the keywords he was using. He had seen it before and dismissed it, as impossible to carry about with him on his peripatetic appointments with men who wanted to be tied up and face-fucked, and too expensive to abandon if he had to leave in a hurry to get to a case.
“I do not speak of danger,” said he. “I speak of inevitable destruction. You are standing not in my way, but in the way of an organisation whose extent you cannot have realised. You must stand clear of our progress, Mr. Holmes, or be trodden under foot.”
William
I had known that, or guessed it, but it was a comfort to be told, all the same. A question occurred. “Will Mycroft go?”
We had scarcely blinked awake into the morning light when a knock sent us scrambling for our clothes: we had a client. We lock the door to the front stairs before we retire, so I was not afraid of discovery; still, we do like to appear marginally decent before visitors. My mustache looks ridiculous when uncombed, so I hung back to tidy myself while Holmes went down to greet them. When I joined them he was already elbows-deep in mystery. It was one of those he could manage from the sitting-room; in twenty minutes he had it all sorted, and was escorting his relieved client to the door with a glimmering glance of triumph over his shoulder, for my benefit. Two more clients followed in quick succession; then there was a summons from Lestrade, and a ride in a shilling hansom, and a series of forged documents at Scotland Yard which took us half an hour to survey. That was finished off with an animated lecture from my love on the science of handwriting, which none of us grasped whatsoever. He was pleased with himself, though, which was enough for me; especially as he fell quiet again in the cab going home; took dinner wordlessly, abstracted, and afterward smoked a pipe in silence, with a lowering storm in his grey eyes. When he sat down at his desk, and took out paper and pen, but did not write, only stared rigidly down at it, “I’ll just take a nap,” I said into the stillness, and left him to it. I would not bring him back to me quicker by fussing about.
Paris at the turn of the century had a significant gay and trans population. The police still picked people up, but (if I've understood right) the culture allowed a little more breathing space for gay men. London had its own gay quarters and clubs, but the atmosphere was growing increasingly tense as people took sides on the question of LGBT inclusion, diatribes were written, and trials were publicized. Increased awareness meant increased polarization.
"Does that please you?" I managed, and the smile grew.
"No, I know. Not—everything, not until he is in irons and we are safe from his knowledge. But—only take me walking, Holmes, and let's see the city. Tell me about the people we pass. Bring me home, and talk to me, and let me read to you, and be with you." He spoke lightly, but his expression was hungry. "Just let me be with you."
“You do, and then you go out barenecked in February. It makes me chilly, looking at you.”
I was put to some trouble behaving sensibly on the day we’d chosen. We had agreed to wait until everyone else was abed; a practical measure, to make us safe from everyday interruptions, or (God forbid) the sudden interference of an actual case; but the hours stretched on before us. I suppose I was fidgeting, because Sherlock at last sprung up from the sofa, where I thought he’d fallen asleep, and said, “This won’t do at all. Come on!”
“Yes.” His expression said he more than remembered. Of course he did.
“I beg your pardon?”
“It’s perfect.” He had gotten me a ring, and such a ring. “It’s so like you.”
“Oh, you’ll always presume, and I’ll always let you.” Then his voice caught, as I caught his hands; and he laughed at me, and kissed me.
She has found a friend, too, among her new group—the sort of friend you and I are, now, I mean. I am glad. It is a relief to hear she is loved as she ought to be.
“He’s a great boy of twelve,” said he, “and you’re a mother hen.” He peeked out above the map at last, twinkling; winked at me, and laid it aside, and took up the letter from his lap, and plucked a butter knife from the tea-tray to serve him for a letter opener. “Let’s see what mysterious mess of iniquity we’ve been sent now. I hope it’s worthwhile.” In another moment, however, he had examined the handwriting and the return address, and his expressive face went quite blank.
and then came the tiny, gap-eyed skull.
“It’s nearly noon.”
“Yes.”
“I’ll be quick,” I promised. I was finding it hard to get my breath. I unwound my scarf, stalling for time; wrapped it around his neck, and he blinked at me. I’d dragged him outside without his coat; it was a rational thing to do. But he looked at me as though I was being sweet, but puzzling; his eyebrows were being quite eloquent about it. I gave up trying to find words, then, and just pulled the little velvety box out of my coat, and laid it in my palm where he could see it. His eyes went wide.
“Valentine’s Day,” she said into the pillows, and all at once my insides were turning bright, glowing, shining all over the room. She said, “One gives gifts to one’s—other. So I’ve heard.”
He returned too quickly. Hair smoothed roughly back by hand, cheeks still pink with cold, his quilted emerald smoking-jacket brightening his eyes and squaring his shoulders, making him look faintly royal. Wool stockings, my gift three Christmases ago. Incongruous, shabby, soft old slippers on his feet. I looked up and found his gaze clear on me. I quailed, but felt more certain still: I could not risk him.
I read Mycroft as asexual, and much more content alone than Holmes could ever have been. I think that as long as Sherlock and Sherrinford are alive and well and nearby, he is happy.
I sat down beside her. Considered my options.
My wits returning to me, I looked about me sharply for any witness, or accomplice, and saw (my heart began to beat faster) a man standing farther up the mountain, peering down into the mist.
“I must have looked lost. I didn’t understand, even then. He added, carefully, ‘I mean they look to each other for love.’ I said, ‘As spouses do—they love each other?’ and he nodded. ‘Body and soul’—those were his words. ‘And while the practice is unusual, it seems to settle them, much as marriage does another kind of man. Some waste their time and their energies on hired boys, as a rake would on women. Some despise their own nature, and are unable to accept any kind of comfort in it; but given your intelligence and your self-respect, I think you will do better than that—if this idea strikes you in any significant way.’ And he smiled at me. I think he hoped to reassure me. I was stunned. I am still stunned, but—I have considered it, and I think—I believe he is right.”
I did not. I could not. Faced with his furious clarity, I felt all my protection falling to pieces about me. I cast about me for some role to inhabit, some character who might have an answer for him, and found nothing but my naked self left undefended.
When the sun started to drop below the city skyline, and Lestrade got up to switch on the lights, “I’ve got to go,” I said, “Rosie’s sitter’s time is up. Sherlock?” I know by now when he isn’t hearing me. I brushed my fingers over the back of his hand, and his eyes flickered away from the paperwork spread over the table and came slowly up to rest on me. “I’ll meet you at home, yeah?”
“No, only disquieted. I think she’s afraid I’ve lost my affection for her.”
“It is absolutely out of the question,” he said, suddenly, after some minutes of silence. I startled; I had been quite lost in my own thoughts.
Christmas came and went. The year turned silently from old to new in darkness, without any appreciable change in the quality of our existence. The city huddled hungry and half-cowed beneath the lowering sky, sending up layers of defiant soot to stain the clouds. London was sunk into the mire of a dreary March, John absent from my rooms for three months entire, and I dropped down into the depths of a blank, black mood of the kind that left me feeling there was no substance left to my soul, when John rapped on the half-open sitting room door one morning, and came inside, cheeks pinked by the cold, and smiling. As he stopped to hook his cane over his chair, with a cheerful, “Hello, Holmes,” I stumbled to my feet and stared.
I stepped inside. There followed some minutes of the inexact, familiar, kind exclamations anyone receives on their sudden arrival home. She seemed surprisingly worried over me. My insufficient weight and my apparent weariness were fussed over, and the state of my shoes and my bag and my hat, and then she insisted on hanging my things for me, and hustling me up the stairs, with promises of tea and sausages, and no attention paid at all to my repeated, “I’m really all right,” which I meant to follow with, “but there is a hired murderer waiting just outside and you ought possibly to take a day’s holiday,” as soon as I could get a word in. This I only managed to convey once I was seated at my own table, with a napkin on my lap, and my cup steaming.
“What was it like?” I asked, finally, pulling away to see his expression. The complicated look passed over his face again.
let him go.
“Watson, were you out? All night? Without me?” I hadn’t meant to say that last, but he didn’t seem to think it unusual; only pinched up his lips and answered nothing. “But—why?”
"Forgive me. I had told you everything in my mind—a hundred times, I—You recall our friend, Professor Moriarty?” I said.
We’d promised each other a week, each to find a suitable token for the other. Something with which to promise each other our intent. I made a quiet trip to the bookseller on the Square; I needed a copy of the prayer book, for we’d agreed that we would have no priest. Neither of us wanted to ask in a stranger in, even if we could find a sympathetic one.
“Why trouble yourself what I do with my money?”
“Now, yes, but—all this—” (he gestured to the room, and me with it)— “it isn’t mine by rights, is it? It’s luck, that’s all. I was wounded the same as the rest who died in the mountains. I shouldn’t have made it out. And when I did, I should never have found you; I had no connections here, nothing to fall back on. I’ve gone hungry before—I know how to do that, at least. I should be living in privation like every other soldier past his strength.” I opened my mouth to protest that, but he shook his head at me. “Since by some chance, instead, I interested you, and found a living here, and recovered as I have—still any chance could take it all away. Why not test my luck now, and see what’s coming to me?”
Of course Holmes’ soul has never been near becoming a “dry, cold mechanisation,” but it’s how he feels it. He’s never been as duplicitous and inconstant as he feels either.
France was a sufficient distraction for about a week. I could forget myself in wandering the crooked streets, ducking in and out of second-hand shops and third-rate music-halls, a cigarette in my hand and my cravat undone; I could disappear into my research for hours, and go to bed at any time of day or night, and rain curses, unreprimanded, on my uncooperative fireplace and my draughty window and my empty room. For John wasn’t there, and the release of utter self-indulgence was failing to counterbalance the weight of his absence.
"All right."
“It’s all right,” I said, worrying as that statement was. “I’ll meet him now. Or do you mean to send our regrets?”
“Are you afraid of something? Here?” he asked. Calm eyes, steady tone, steel beneath. If we were at risk, he was ready. The feel of having him by me again in a fight—
“That my brother is also an inveterate self-debaser? That he cheerfully enjoys the fruits of his moral decay? That he would publicly claim a marriage founded on buggery?”
“A society?” That startled me. I would have expected the brothels and back alleys would serve well enough for buggers’ connexions. I supposed high-class liaisons might be arranged at the wilder society parties, but I’d never imagined a convivial group of chatterers having drinks in a gentlemen’s club. But then—“You’re not going to go behind Mary’s back?”
“They seemed happy,” he said. His voice grew softer and slower. “They looked well. Cox was very gracious to me.”
“You told Mycroft what happened?”
I had not anticipated how the loss would unravel me. I am not a narcissist: I had no idea of claiming a right to him. But neither am I the self-sufficient sage I have invented for my most often lived-in self. I do not think he knows it, but I need him. So at last I found a way to gather myself up and come asking for him, offering whatever I had, my stories and my work and my company. It seemed to be enough for him. He was happy when I came.
“To send a letter. And then to breakfast.”
“No! That is--no. Of course not. But we are known; we could be seen; we could be arrested, or fall prey to blackmailers or newspapermen. There are a hundred persons who would find a use for the news that you and I were seen arm-in-arm going into a molly-house with a bunch of queers.”
Any lover can imagine what followed. Till then I had been neither lover nor beloved, and was quite unprepared; but I had faith enough in John Watson. Whenever I have need of him, he proves himself; and I think I offered enough in return to put all thought of luck and the loss of it out of his mind.
