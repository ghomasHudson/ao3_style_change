“Hello, handsome,” Crowley says with a grin and Cas very nearly slams the door in the man’s face. “Fancy seeing the newest addition to the security team, in Dean’s room, wearing a bathrobe.” Crowley quirks a brow accusingly and Cas’ brain scrambles for an answer.
Dean smiles softly and cards his fingers through Cas’s hair as he hovers above. “I love you.” Dean’s eyes slide closed and he swallows hard. “Fuck, I love you so much.” He surges upward to capture Castiel’s lips and Cas can feel the swell of emotion pouring into the kiss, heating them both.
Suddenly, all the stress of earlier and his utter failure in the kitchen was worth it to have Dean this relaxed and unguarded.
Dean glares down at him, jaw ticking with tension as he digs harsh fingertips into Castiel’s hips. “Use your grace” Dean warns, hitching Castiel’s hips to where he wants him. Dean doesn’t bother with foreplay, he lines himself up and pushes. Castiel can take care of himself if he wants to, that isn’t Dean’s problem right now.
give up the panties Castiel bought for him. He wants more of those, actually. Anything involving blood, excrement, or Sam is on the hard no list, but beyond that? Dean is at a loss.
Meg huffs and shakes her head. “You’re smiling.” Her eyes narrow and she lifts a brow. “I know it’s Sunday, but who are you and what have you done with my little Angel?”
Benny swallows hard and licks his lips. “You, uh, you ought to see this,” He says and his eyes dart in the direction of the village.
“Let Odin see that I stand victorious.” Dean hefts his sword and brings the point down into Asmodeus’ throat, nearly severing his head. A gurgle of blood erupts from his uncle’s mouth and he chokes on his last breaths as he stares unseeingly skyward.
Dean nods and leans forward, pressing their lips together as his eyes slide closed with a hum. Cas’ knees tremble as Dean’s hands drift to his hips, cinching them closer and closer until their pressed together from groin to chest and Cas’ heart is hammering wildly.
He pumps his arms encouragingly, trying to coax the bat to take flight. “Go on,” he urges and they must be listening, because the bat chooses that moment to flap their wings and lift themself into the air.
He sets about emptying the barrel and ignores the many arched brows and puzzled looks of those who see him in the hall. His cheeks heat with their open stares and interested expressions but he repeatedly tells himself that he has nothing to be ashamed of.
“Cas,” Dean says, his soul full to bursting. He wraps his arm over Cas’ shoulders and pulls him close. “May the gods forgive me, but I can’t help but be selfish when it comes to you.”
“Now, suspension bondage can be extremely dangerous. You both need to prioritize communication and make good use of safewords. Dean, do you have one you would like to use right now?” James explains as he tightly loops the rope around Dean’s forearm.
He could just not show up and let the guilt eat him alive for the rest of his life because he’s never stood up a date and doesn’t intend to start now.
Ezekiel is standing close, too close in Cas’ opinion, to a young Norse woman who is also watching the scene unfold between him and Dean. His brother had been given the duty to protect the Jarl’s household. An honor Sam had said, one given to few slaves, but Ezekiel had nearly bested the Jarl’s warriors when he was tested, and Benny agreed to take the mild-mannered man under his wing.
“She can be a monster, gotta be careful. That woman’s got claws, just like her mother.” Dean crosses the room before opening his arms for Cas. “I can hardly believe you’re here,” he murmurs into Cas’ shoulder as he squeezes tight.
That’s Dean’s motto, although he is no boy scout. Besides, Cas is pretty sure that keeping lube within reach at nearly all times isn’t what that phrase is supposed to mean.
“Should I not be meant to resist?” Castiel offers, voicing a question he has thought on several times now but he can never find an answer that feels correct.
“Sometimes you just know,” Dean answers easily with a shrug. “Cas is incredible, we just fit, ya know?”
“What do I want?” Crowley scoffs with a smirk. “What does any good reporter want?” Crowley takes a step around Cas, his shiny black shoes clacking on the wooden floor of the exhibit front. “I want an exclusive, something juicy. Something everyone else doesn’t already know. What I want, you giraffe, is
By the time the sun dips below the trees, a village comes into view and causes Castiel’s heart to stutter with dread. The increasing murmur of voices and an outbreak of joyous song tells Castiel everything he needs to know.
Cas is relentless, tugging and squeezing until Dean feels blood roaring in his ears and his body tense.
Cas nods shyly but the mix of pleasure and pride swirling in his gut remains. He’s sure Dean wouldn’t mind coming back here sometime and the idea of showing him off is very appealing too. “I should get going,” he says, noticing the clock on the wall is slowly ticking past the time he normally gets to his spot. “But I’ll bring Dean by sometime, I promise.” He lifts his drink toward her in salute. “Congratulations on your classes.”
“This okay?” Dean whispers, glancing around the lobby that Cas is pretty sure Charlie cleared out before they arrived if the myriad of closed doors is any indication.
Charlie shakes her head and then nods. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry.” She squeaks and Cas’ heart sinks further.
Dean smiles. “Yes,” He says cheerfully before he takes a bite of meat from the platter. “Strong alcohol,” He says through the food in his mouth and he barely contains his laugh when Cas inevitably scowls.
The dark-haired man nods and pulls forward to park his car, leaving Cas behind to wait in an act of trust. Once the car is safely tucked in the next alley, he climbs out and follows Cas at a slight distance, hips as he beckons him deeper into the darkness.
Now it’s Castiel’s turn to pout. The idea of sinking to his knees for Dean in a place he loves so much sends warms tingles through Cas’ gut that spark into a raging inferno when he considers bending Dean over in the studio while the microphones record every delicious sound he manages to draw out of Dean.
Dean nods. “Let me order food first, then you can have a tour.” He’s already waking up his phone and pulling a takeout menu from the drawer nearest the refrigerator. “You wanna take a look?”
Dean stabs some steaming noodles with his fork and shoves them in his mouth unceremoniously. “Fuck!” He spits them out and takes a quick gulp of the cold soda Bobby had picked up for him from the gas station next door. The scorch on his tongue fades, but he’s certain there is going to be very little left of his taste buds.
He sucks in a careful breath through his nose and the combined scent of orange and cinnamon tickles his nostrils and makes him feel like headed as he waits for Cas to do
Sam has no such qualms and devours nearly the entire head Dean had cooked. “Very good Dean. Thank you” He mutters, seeking eye contact with his brother that Dean refuses to allow. He’d crack if he looked up right now.
He watches his brother go with his lip between his teeth and quietly pushes up from his seat as soon as Gabe is out of sight.
Meg recommended something that looks more befitting for the gay bar down the street from where Cas hangs out, at least from a distance.
Dean catches up to him and snags his hand again. “You think I’m pretty,” he says, pleasure clear in his voice as he bumps their shoulders together.
Dean nods. “If that’s okay. Sam’s been wanting to meet you properly and I figure nows probably a good time since we’re all on mostly the same place at the same time.”
Cas crawls up the bed and snuggles into Dean’s waiting arms with a mild huff of annoyance. His Norse has gotten so good that these times when he cannot find the right word frustrate him to no end. Dean thinks he understands though, after what Cas has been through, what was done to him, he needs time and patience.
Dean rears his head back and shakes his head. Surely, Cas must be joking. Poking fun at his obsessive need to keep his yard free from all weeds. “What’s that supposed to mean?” There is no way that Cas can know.
He’d been too focused on school and keeping his head above water when he left his family and he’s been too focused on his career over the last several years to date anyone seriously enough to warrant meeting their family.
Now it’s Cas’s turn to flush. “Not a creeper. I suppose that is high praise,” he says with a chuckle as he shakes his head.
Cas keens at the touch of Dean’s calloused palm, thrusting up into his grasp. Dean wraps his hand around them both, holding their heavy cocks tightly together as he slowly works them.
Dean barks a laugh and shakes his head as he straightens the white bowtie at his neck as he looks at himself in the mirror. “I think you’ll survive.”
Cas sighs as he tucks the extra money away, already deciding that he’s going to stop for coffee tomorrow night and spend a few minutes chatting with Missy. If he’s careful, he’ll have enough left to pay for his own meal when he has dinner with Dean on Sunday.
“I haven’t had pancakes in ages,” Cas admits as he reaches for the plate of soft butter and slathers it on each pancake in the stack. “These look wonderful.” He looks up in time to see Dean duck his chin with a shy smile.
Castiel can feel his cheeks heat as he realizes how lost in his thoughts he was. How long had Dean been talking to him? He nods and drops his gaze, but not before noticing the slowly moving river just a handle of meters away.
Dean nods and his cock stirs in his pants. “You, dressed like this?” Dean whispers with a hum. “I have all sorts of ideas.”
When they first arrived, Virgil was assigned to the barracks of bachelors who are also some of Dean’s best warriors. He did not last long there before Asmodeus scooped him up and now he’s serving the Jarl?
Not even the hammering of his heart or the shouted begging of the paparazzi can take away from the moment.
Dean moans and swallows, tongue sweeping around the underside of Cas’ cock as warm come fills his mouth. He suckles and licks until Cas collapses against the bed, spent and panting.
“Then go! It’s not like you don’t have the vacation time built up.” Balthazar down the rest of his glass and reaches for the bottle as the television drones on in the background.
Dean blinks lazily as he stares down his body at his angle and his brows furrow as he tries to think. “Huh?” He can’t have heard right, Cas must have fried his brain somehow.
Dean sighs and drops his chin to his chest before turning his green eyes on Cas. He smiles, trying to put this awkwardness behind them and points to the menu. “What’s good here?”
Inias sucks in a sharp breath as a cloud crosses over his features. “The culture here is far different from our own. They seem to value death as a reward instead of something to be avoided. It is, unsettling at times,” Inias continues and Cas finds himself nodding in return.
He finds the luxuriously soft furs bring him little of their usual comfort as a yawning emptiness fills his chest. His fingers drift toward the band on his pocket and stroke lightly over the warm metal as he closes his eyes and silently prays for revelation.
Checking out goes smoothly despite the realization that this is the first time he’s bought alcohol in months. Even though he will not be drinking any, he holds the purchased case like a ticking bomb until Cas gently pries it from his fingers.
Cas sighs and Dean can feel him shake his head but he refuses to open his eyes to look. Cas drops his forehead against Dean’s. “I thought I was reading something here,” he whispers and Dean cries a little inside at the sadness laced in Cas’ tone.
Cas shakes his head with an amused huff. “I remind you of your brother?” He’d be willing to call bullshit on that after all the talking Dean has done about how perfect his little brother is. How smart, how determined, how kind. Dean must be crazy if he sees those things in him.
Cas surges upward to drag Dean’s lips into another heated kiss. Their lips come together without the bruising force of a few moments ago but Cas is nowhere near ready to apologize for putting Dean’s safety first. He will make the same choice a thousand times if the opportunity arises.
The young man behind the counter gives them a chastising look but the corner of his lips twitches when Cas shoves playfully at Dean’s shoulder. “What can I do for you crazy kids?”
“Go to my room, I will get food,” Dean says once they’re inside. He has an idea and he hopes Cas will partake.
When he opens his eyes again, his grin borders on painful. It’s too soon to start talking about marriage, they’ve barely exchanged I love you’s and they have so much more to learn about each other. But in this moment, Cas revels in the thought that Dean is just as serious as he is.
“Oh, hell no!” Dean’s stomach drops and his mouth goes dry as he stares at the poor, poor man on the screen with his balls in a vice. “Who the hell comes up with shit like this?!”
The snick of the cap closing is all the warning he gets before slick fingers pry between his cheeks and circle his hole.
Cas wrinkles his nose and shakes his head in disgust, his anger rising hard and fast to consume his reasonable thoughts. “Watching so we don’t run away.”
Cas’ gaze flits between his brothers and his brow arches in confusion at Inias’ suddenly harsh tone. Alfie merely rolls his eyes with a shrug.
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Winchester, I didn’t mean to be morbid. The moment Dean turned around to face me when I was about to kick him out of the boathouses was probably the happiest moment of my life.” Cas squeezes Dean’s hand.
Dean does as requested without protest, and Cas whispers more affirmations into his ear that leave him shivering and begging for more. Castiel continues to use his grace to manifest lubrication and Dean keens when the thick head of his cock eases past the tight ring of muscles at Dean’s entrance.
Cas stares at his brother openly. He doesn’t know what to say. He feels like he should argue, tell him that giving in and addressing that strange flutter in his stomach every time he glimpses Dean’s smile would be a mistake.
“And how well you can read people? I remember going with you to the bar and watching you hustle pool. Those guys never stood a chance.” Sam tosses his hands around excitedly as he grins.
“I was glad Dean. I was so relieved that she was gone. I never,” Cas says before another wracking sob overtakes him. The guilt that he’s kept locked away breaks free of his chains and he feels like he’s drowning. “I was a terrible son.”
“Shoulda seen him at lunch, grinning like a damn fool.” Bobby fills his plate after Dean and soon, the three of them settle at the table.
Cas’ cheeks heat and his skin flushes. This went further than he expected but he doesn’t regret their actions even the slightest. He laid himself bare before Dean and found himself caught in Dean’s net, held safe and warm as he let himself fall away from everything he’s ever known.
“Castiel asked for our approval at Christmas time,” Sam says simply, as if that outdated, chivalrous bullshit isn’t the sweetest, most romantic thing anyone has ever done for Dean.
“Dean,” Sam says with a scowl as he narrowly prevents Gabriel from toppling to his knees in the rough gravel. Gabriel pulls away from Sam with a disgusted expression and scowls fiercely at Dean.
Cas can barely swallow, Dean’s voice is beautiful, all soft and sweet with nothing more than the guitar to back him up. Time may as well have stopped
Dean takes the opportunity of Cas watching him and licks a long stripe up Cas’ cock while watching Cas’ mesmerized expression through his eyelashes. Cas’ lips part and his eyes blow wide and dark with desire as Dean eagerly resumes his ministrations and his fingers curl around the sharp cut of Cas’ hips.
Samandriel nods. “He sees your acceptance of Dean’s attentions as a betrayal. We saw you run into his arms those weeks ago, how you embraced him and allowed him to comfort you after Lilith… Inias saw all of that and I’ve never seen him so wounded, Castiel.”
“Cas,” Dean whines, his voice low and gruff with sleep as he cinches his arms tighter around Cas. This can’t possibly be comfortable for Dean. His head is bent at an odd angle and he’s somehow wedged his arm between them and over Cas’ hip while the other arm is wrapped so far around Cas that he’s wedged his fingers under Cas’ back. Their legs are tangled hopelessly together and Cas
Cas understands. “I want to hear you.” He leans over to whisper in Dean’s ear just as he viciously rubs Dean’s prostate. “Do you think you’re ready?”
“Metatron,” Gabriel says sweetly as he places a hand over his heart in greet. “It is good to see you, brother.”
Sam lets out a heavy breath as Dean leans toward Cas again and Sam reaches forward to swat him upside the head. “Hotel. Now. I don’t wanna see any more of this than I have to.” He does his best to glare but his entire body is tingling and floaty from a mix of the weed and pride that these two morons finally kissed.
Cas doesn’t know what else to do as watches Dean take Benny’s place at the corner of the house where he assumes Ruby and Lilith are still scheming.
Cas, as it turns out, is more than proficient and manages to win four out of the five games they play. Dean sputters in amazement as Cas grins his victory and Ellen cheers.
Dean shrugs and smiles nervously as he looks at the array of heavy fishing gear surrounding Rufus’ chair. “Just on the lakes back home,” He admits and Rufus rolls his eyes.
Dean joins him, only inches away as he wipes his hands with the last of the napkins. “Why’d you stop?”
Dean’s jaw drops slightly. He does not remember speaking Latin in his sleep and his parents never mentioned that to him.
Dean nods, he can keep his mouth shut if he needs to. He can’t deny how curious he is about this entire idea. He’s enjoyed the few times Castiel had restrained him, and the even fewer times he had restrained Castiel. “Am I going to be your sub?” Dean asks, the only thing he knows about fetish stuff is that someone is the Dom and someone is the sub.
I'm trying something new and have created a Twitter for my writing adventures and Destiel that will also have some Jensen and Misha content. I'm just getting started, but if you'd be interested in seeing what I'm up to, my handle is @grimmlin_fic
Cas cries out when Dean starts to sink, guiding his dick to breach that first ring of tight muscle. “Dean!” Cas begs, eyes widening. It’s too soon, too quick. Dean needs to be prepped, stretched…
“I’m proud of you too. I know this wasn’t easy for you.” Cas leans into Dean’s shoulder, not minding the lingering sweat emanating from underneath his jacket.
Cas nods with a frown before taking another glorious sip of the amber liquid filling his glass. He doesn’t even rightfully know what he’s drinking apart from it being bought by Balthazar. Some kind of Scotch, he thinks. That would make the most sense based on the smoky earthiness clinging to his tongue.
“Steve,” Mick says warmly. “I missed you last week.” He steps forward, reaching out to touch Cas’s hip before remembering himself and tucking his hand into his pocket.
“So, you really do want to be my Dom?” Dean asks, arching a brow as he picks at an imaginary speck of dirt on the table.
How can he though? Especially now? Meg hasn’t been able to work a full night in almost a week and she’s barely earning enough to buy the drugs that keep her pain under control.
Cas smirks and the sudden fire in his eyes burns up any least vestige of doubt that may have been lingering. “Tell me you want more than this,” Cas says, hands stilling as he presses Dean against the wall with his hips.
Sam huffs into the phone and Dean nearly bounces with excitement. “If you don’t mind. I mean, I get it if you don’t wanna stay on the road another night, but yeah…” Sam trails off and Dean delights in how red Sam’s face has gotten in his imagination.
His chest feels hollow as he sets his phone aside and he settles onto his back. The sun is expected to appear by mid-morning, but they’re still looking at several more hours of rain.
“If you want to stop, we can. I don’t want to push; I didn’t think we’d go this far...” Dean starts to babble and Cas finds his nervousness endearing.
“You know what, Cas, trade places with me.” Sam is opening the car door and gesturing for Cas to follow before he can stop himself. His stomach swoops with excitement as he considers his half thought out plan.
He can hear Dean’s hushed tones from the other room, but he turns the water on and the sound is lost. He wets his fingers and rakes them through his hair in a vain attempt to make it lay in some sort of order.
Cas frowns, trying to remember how to say the word Lilith had thrown at him when she deposited the knife into his pocket. “What.” He swallows thickly. “What is whore?”
Sundays are Castiel's favorite day of the week. This one is no exception, especially when he hears from Dean.
Gabriel turns his chin skyward. “Good Lord, please grant me the patience to not throttle my brother.”
“A deer?” Cas arches a brow and stares with his mouth pressed into a flat line that exudes how unimpressed he is with Dean’s error.
Dean shifts against the well-worn leather of his seat and wrings his hands. Baby purrs around him, enveloping him with familiar comfort but doing little to soothe his racing heart. “I think I’m gonna be sick,” he mutters as he drops his forehead against the steering wheel.
Cas’ gaze flits to Dean, as has become his habit, only to find the man watching Cas out of the corner of his eye as he confers with Benny, but the man makes no move to interfere.
They’re the same eyes Cas glimpses from time to time even now, during the rare moments when Dean lets himself be at ease and his heart swells each time he sees them.
A dip in the cold stream outside the village border sounds heavenly but he fears that will not be an option today. Not that Cas would dare undress and risk becoming vulnerable even if it were.
His knees remind him that he isn’t eighteen anymore when he crouches under the shower spray to rinse the suds from his hair, but the water is hot and helps keeps his mind from drifting down the road he swore off when he dragged his sorry ass all the way out here from Kansas.
“Cas, Dean wants you to stay here until midday and help with my research. Then he would like you to return to his chamber and clean,” Sam says with a frown, glancing between his brother and Cas.
Cas stares longingly at the small capsule and chews his lip before reaching out to take her offering. “Thanks,” he mutters as he down the pill with a tall glass of water.
“Dean…” Sam warns and Dean can easily imagine the pinched frown he’s being assaulted with. “Cas was pissed. Whatever you said, you need to apologize.”
Cas grins at his enthusiasm as he reaches a hand behind himself with lubed fingers. He doesn’t take long, just enough to coat his rim with the slick gel and test his resistance with a finger. Mere seconds later, he's stroking lube over Dean's erection and scooting forward to straddle the man’s hips. “Tell me again what you wanted to do” his eyes lock on Dean's, searching for any sign of doubt in his Hunter’s gaze.
Dean snorts and shakes his head. “As if there’s any other option. I’d like three scoops of butter pecan, please.”
“Hmmmm, you know I like to hear you beg” Dean grins at Cas’ desperation before licking a stripe up the understand of Cas’ cock.
“Hey, I get it if you can’t stay. I’m sure you have better things to do,” Dean excuses him with a wave of his hand. Cas has got to be regretting his offer to help and Dean doesn’t want him here if he doesn’t want to be here.
She hangs up before Dean can manage another word and he’s left sitting on the edge of the bed with confusion swirling in his sleep-addled brain. With a wide yawn, he shrugs and shimmies back into the inviting warmth of his bed and closes his eyes.
As it is, Dean lifts his gaze with his jaw clenched as he swings his bloody ax and places it against the rail while he waits for Sam to lead Ruby into place.
Benny nods but a small smile tugs at his lips. “Damn right about that. Dean is one of the best men I know.”
Cas does something utterly sinful with his hand that steals Dean’s breath and forces his attention back where it belongs. “I know your feelings about the word penis, my love, but it is nothing to be embarrassed by.” Cas uses his free hand to put pressure on the most incredible places around the base of Dean’s dick, sharpening his pleasure in ways that he didn’t know existed.
“So, this Cas fella?” Bobby probes, gently nudging Dean with his elbow to convince him to lift his chin. “You like him?”
Castiel swallows hard as he takes in the idyllic scene. If he were here of his own free will, he would find the isolation beautiful and calming. He wouldn’t hesitate to sit at the water’s edge and lose himself to the passing of time as he basks in the gentle sunlight.
“She, uh, shesapornstar,” Dean mutters, flushing crimson and Cas has to bite the inside of his cheek a little bit harder to keep from cooing over how adorable Dean is when he’s embarrassed.
“Hey, Ellen.” Dean smiles back and lets himself be dragged into her warm hug. He folds his arms around her and holds on tight, breathing in the familiar scent her shampoo and letting the sense of
“Shit, man, I should let you get some sleep.” Dean scratches the back of his neck but his soft smile refuses to dim.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean grates as Cas hum and swallows around him. Every cell in his being vibrates with the need to take and be taken, to meld with Cas until there is nothing left but
“Chinese,” Cas is quick to answer. They just had pizza the night before he doesn’t think his stomach would be pleased with that much cheese again in so short a time. “Do they have Moo-Shu pork?”
“Alright, mom, what's next?” Dean claps his hands together with a cheesy grin as Cas strips off the gloves and turns to the sink to wash his hands.
“Let’s get out of here before they decide to mob you,” Cas laces his fingers with Dean’s and starts to tug him along, much to the dismay of their spectators.
“Dean, please. It...” Cas fumbles. He doesn’t know the Norse word for emergency and he doesn’t know how to communicate the situation without Jarl Samuel asking further questions. Cas knows that Dean has been keeping things from the man and he does not want to be the one to break Dean’s trust. “Please,” Cas says again, hoping that his steady gaze is enough to convince Dean that this is important.
Dean swallows hard and nods, green eyes tracking Castiel’s every motion with unfettered want until Cas has himself lubed up and pressing for entry.
“Ooh, Clarence is growing claws. You’re good for him Dean,” Meg says huskily from her perch with a smirk.
Sam chuckles and shakes his head. “I’m glad you and my brother are making peace. I was worried you might try to kill him at first,” Sam says jokingly but both monks can hear the serious undertone of his words.
Dean squeezes their cocks and bucks against Cas in a way that has him crying out in a sob as the glorious pressure building inside him finally swells outward. His vision darkens and his cock begins to twitch and spurt, coating their hands in sticky white that has Dean stiffening below him and following over the edge.
Dean sputters, shaking his head. “Then me and Sam’ll go talk to the family. You can probably get more out of the crime scene anyway” He protests. What he really wants is to pair with Cas, but his brother and angel are ganging up on him and he needs some sort of victory here.
Cas nods. “Very much,” he says, voice so low and rough that Dean’s cock gives a hard twitch against his thigh.
As promised, Cas is waiting for him outside when he finally pulls up to the curb and Dean can’t help but stare. The darker haired man is leaning against the crumbling red brick with his knee bent and foot propped up, effortlessly handsome in the late afternoon sun. His jeans are snug and his simple t-shirt hugs his biceps and showcases the flat of his stomach like he’s some kind of model.
“Dean!” Castiel folds his arms over his chest and bristles, flooding the room with the stench of impatient alpha.
Cas shoots Dean a half-hearted glare as he feels mayonnaise squish between his fingers. Even with the gloves Mary gave him, this is possibly the most disturbing food related thing he’s done.
“Here.” Dean hands him one of his oldest flannels, the green and white one that he typically only wears behind closed doors. “This should be comfortable enough.”
Cas can almost see Dean’s smile, at least he hopes Dean is smiling, and his fingers start typing before he can bother sparing Balthazar a glance.
Please please please check out the awesome art by Mrgoodbar for an imagining of Viking!Dean. I think he looks pretty darn good, don't you? 😁https://archiveofourown.org/works/27786415
“As you wish Mr. Winchester” Cas voice trembles as if he’s barely holding himself together, looking at Dean spread bare before him with only the thin hospital gown clinging to his patient’s strong shoulders. He grips Dean’s hips and tugs him ever closer to the edge of the table and he tightens thick straps across Dean’s ankles to hold him exactly where Cas wants him. “Mustn’t have you shifting out of place” Cas explains when Dean raises his head questioningly.
Cas rolls his eyes. Did Dean really expect him to be mad? “It would be hypocritical of me to be upset with you for enjoying a product that my brother creates.”
Cas holds him tighter, using his angelic strength to pull Dean against his chest and hold him there. “Rest a minute, Dean.”
Dean looks to Cas with his red-rimmed eyes and swallows hard. “I wasn’t alone,” Dean admits. “Benny, Charlie, Sam... they all knew.” Dean gives his brother a grateful nod and Sam flinches a smile.
This is all more than he deserves after all the shit he’s pulled, but he isn’t about to ask too many questions.
As luck would have it, they chose the right suspect the first time and pumped him full of silver the second he began to shift into a bloodthirsty monster and they were home before dawn.
“I know, Gabe, I understand. I’m just not ready to go there yet, okay?” Cas pleads. He doesn’t know if he’ll ever be ready, but he isn’t going to say that. Not yet.
The two men finish their meal in silence and Dean leaves to clear away the platter. The moment the door shuts behind the man, Cas hurries to his new bed of furs and wraps himself in a large pelt he thinks might have once belonged to a bear and angles himself to face the darkened fireplace.
His eyes burn and his nose runs as wet tears roll down his cheeks. He wipes them away with the back of his hand when he hears Dean come back. He wasn’t gone as long as Cas thought he would be, or maybe more time has passed than Cas realizes.
A chuckle escapes unbidden as a smile creeps across his face. Having dinner with Dean does sound nice. “Fine, but it’s not a date.” Returning to the phrase that is becoming increasingly familiar loosens the knot in his chest.
Cas uses his grace to summon the bottle of lube Dean keeps in his nightstand and pours a small amount of the cool liquid into his palm, warming the slippery material between his fingers before stroking a digit over Dean’s hole. Dean gasps and Cas smiles at the way Dean pushes back onto his finger, begging without asking. Dean is hesitant to ask for this despite enjoying being fucked just as much as being on the giving end. This is something he has only trusted Cas with, and if Cas has his way Dean will never be with anyone else.
Cas shrugs. “It’s cheap. Here, put your number in.” He hands it over and watches the way Dean chews his lips as his fingers poke at the tiny buttons. Eventually, Dean hands the phone back and Cas quickly sends him a text. “Did you get it?” He asks just as Dean’s phone chimes.
“Don’t worry, Dean. I’m not saying we should.” Cas covers his yawn but he knows Dean will be able to hear.
Dean's eyes are so wide and earnest that Cas can’t possibly deny him. He looks like a lost little boy that needs protecting and Cas’ heart aches at the thought. “I’m not in a position to be judgmental.”
Dean smirks and turns away to collect the box he left lying on their bed. He lifts the collar from its case and takes a moment to study the simple piece. The feel is softer than any dog collar he’s ever seen, which is good because he isn’t interested in being a dog. One afternoon of that is enough, thank you very much.
The single finger he snuck inside of Dean quickly becomes two, stroking over his silky insides in search of that wonderful spot that he’s sure will drive Dean wild.
Cas nods against Dean’s shoulder and presses a chaste kiss to Dean’s skin. “You have me.” Cas pulls back to prop himself up on his elbow.
“Dean?” A distant voice calls to him but Dean is too busy flying high to care. “Dean?” The voice comes again and he registers something vaguely familiar about the gravelly tone. A sense of utter safety and exhaustion floods his body and he barely notices when the tension holding his arms releases.
He quickly unbinds Dean’s hands and rubs the soreness from his wrists before dragging Dean into his lap on the small couch.
Dean, however, fails spectacularly and Sam is waiting outside the bathroom door with his arms crossed over his chest when they emerge.
“Maybe? We’re trying something new” Dean admits, finding this nearly naked woman surprisingly easy to talk to. He doesn’t spare her barely concealed breasts a second glance, not finding himself interested at all, which strikes him a little odd but he doesn’t let himself think on it.
Dean sits against a tree facing the monks who huddle together like sheep. His shirt catches on the rough bark of the tree when he shifts, but he finds a slight indent in the truck that cradles him comfortably enough to forgive the hard ground beneath him. Dean watches through the waning firelight as the Christians pass terrified whispers amongst themselves while casting him furtive glances with widened eyes. He doesn’t need to understand their language to understand what they’re feeling right now.
Cas sighs as he settles at the table. He’s been making this same sandwich every Sunday since they moved into this apartment. Store brand white bread off the discount shelf and even worse American singles that taste more like plastic than cheese. They melt well though, perfectly gooey and he can pretend it’s just like mom used to make.
Dean stares right back. “Yeah” He shrugs. “I mean, I trust you, and I heard…I heard that that can make things. You know, intense” He shifts his gaze then. “I understand if you don’t want to”
“Holy shit,” Dean says, breath coming in short gasps as James helps him lean forward and Cas lowers the ropes holding him up. His feet try to flail but the effort is wasted when he nearly trips and James keeps him from careening to his knees.
Dean expression falls as Sam translates Castiel’s reasons and the Viking looks almost sad. His shoulders droop and the corners of Dean’s eyes soften as the anger bleeds out of him. “Ok,” Dean mutters with a nod, waving at Cas and his tree. “Cas can stand,” Dean meets Castiel’s eyes as he says the words, but Cas finds himself looking to Sam for meaning.
He sniffles and blinks the fog from his eyes as he nods with pursed lips. “Yeah, I’m fine,” he says with false cheer as he turns a smile toward Dean.
The fact that a rock star has a public dating profile, to begin with, is something Cas had never imagined to be real.
Dean reaches out and snags Cas’ wrist. “I was serious when I said I needed friends,” he says, offering a timid smile.
Dean’s hands are hot brands on his hips, pinning him down with a warning growl that creates brain-melting vibrations around his dick has him sinking against the bed with a whimper. Dean’s tongue is clever, far more so than Castiel had expected but he can’t be bothered with
Cas scoots farther back, lifting one of Dean’s feet into his lap so that Dean’s toes barely nudge the tip of the Angel’s half hard cock. He rubs across the top of Dean’s foot, massaging circles into the sensitive flesh with his thumbs and kneading the underside with his fingers. Dean moans at the gentle ministrations, and each breathy sound from the hunter drives Cas onward. This certainly isn’t something Castiel had expected from Dean, but he’s all too pleased to offer this to him.
“That’s horrible,” Dean mutters and lets his arm wrap around Cas’s waist, holding him in a type of half-hug that Cas fights not to turn his body into.
Cas opens to him easily, already slick and ready as Dean slips inside as slowly as his patience can muster. He doesn’t think he’ll ever tire of this. Either him inside Cas or Cas taking him apart piece by piece until he’s nothing more than a whining puddle of need… Dean isn’t going to let this go for anything.
The one day of the week Bobby closes up shop so that he can spend all day making Ellen wish he worked seven days a week.
“Are you ok?” Dean pulls back Castiel’s bloodied trench coat, still searching for injury as he pushes the coat from his boyfriend’s shoulders.
Dean is on him as soon as the car starts to move, all but climbing into Castiel’s lap as he presses their mouths together and moans when
Cas seems to be waiting for Dean to continue speaking. His blue eyes narrow and his brows furrow in a way that Dean has come to associate with insecurity.
“Probably. I always get General Tso’s beef. It’s like the chicken, but better because it’s steak.” Dean answers and Cas nearly rolls his eyes at how
Dean paces with his jaw clenched so tightly that his teeth creak under the pressure. Cas tried to run away. His heart hammers and his pulse pounds in his ears as he glares at the man.
Cas hadn’t even noticed the squared set of Dean’s shoulders until suddenly they’re not. He shrugs. “I mean, I did know who you are as soon I saw you, but I promise that I’m not interested just because you’re famous.”
This is worth holding onto. This is better than anything he ever thought he would deserve but he isn’t going to ask too many questions.
Cas sucks in a breath and nods as he laces his fingers with Dean’s. “Thank you,” He whispers into the dark and Dean tilts his chin to kiss the bare skin of Cas’ shoulder in answer.
Dean grabs at Lee’s shoulder and spins him with a grunt, clutching at his shirt to try and get a hold of him. Lee spins with a laugh, dodging Dean’s grasp with a wide smile.
“She loves you,” Cas says simply. “And our situation is unheard of.” Cas reaches across to link their fingers over Dean’s thigh after the car roars to life. “Your father seems very understanding.”
The bed shifting under Cas weight pulls Dean from his wayward thoughts and he buries his face in the pillow as Cas pulls his ass cheeks apart. Dean can feel those blue eyes staring at him, admiring the intimate space that he about to ruin. “So perfect, Dean. No one else has ever seen you like I see you or given you what you’ve allowed me to give.”
“They had to perform a cesarean to save you boys, but Jimmy took the brunt of the fall. He was without oxygen for too long, the doctors did what they could but told us to expect the worst,” Andrew continues sadly.
He blinks in Cas’s absence, wondering how he managed to find himself standing alone in front of his apartment with his most beloved possession in the hands of another man.
Cas swallows hard and whispers to Sam while Dean strains to hear. Sam smiles at whatever Cas is saying and turns to whisper something into Cas’ ear in response.
When Cas had explained to him that on the rare occasions the Angel actually slept, he would sometimes dream of when Dean was a demon; Dean had backed away quickly. And when Cas had explained that in those dreams, he was at the mercy of the Demon version of Dean while Dean held him down with an Angel blade pressed to his throat; Dean had been horrified. Not because Cas fantasized about being a demon’s plaything, but because if he and Cas had been together then, like they are now, he certainly would have taken advantage of his Angel and the thought of doing that to Cas sickens him. Cas was adamant that he didn’t really want to be hurt by Dean, not for real, but the thought of voluntarily being powerless is exciting. Cas had told him how those dreams of Demon Dean taking away his senses and control would have him waking hard and aching, Dean had cocked a brow and considered.
Dean grunts with the force of Cas’ movements as tension coils low in his belly, their interruption nearly forgotten with the pace Castiel sets.
“This one’s mine,” James says softly as he fits a key into a lock and pushes the wide door inward. “The door’ll stay unlocked while we’re inside. Kick off your shoes and socks and then feel free to explore while I get the basics set up.” He waves toward the various furniture lining the walls of the small room and Dean tracks the motion with interest.
Cas swallows his mouthful roughly and shakes his head once. “Not really. I mean, I like his music well enough but I’ve never paid him much attention.” He can feel his cheeks heat as he tries to explain but he can’t shake the feeling of being judged.
Dean huffs and shakes his head. “Fine,” He says petulantly but with a wide smile. “Come on Cas, we should get ready to meet with Charlie. We’re going to play putt-putt, I hope that’s okay.”
Cas pushes back with a wince, letting his softening dick slip free as he looks down at Dean adoringly. “You’re incredible,” he mutters before stumbling from the bed to strip off the condom and tie it off. “I’ll be right back, don’t move.”
They had spent weeks tracking down the cemetery where his twin is buried and Cas is determined to be there for their birthday. They would be twenty-five in tomorrow and Dean is so
“What, he said if you need anything…” Dean starts to say but he stalls when he sees Mick’s wolfish smile.
Once their breathing evens out and they’re cleaned up, Dean pulls Cas into his arms and presses a kiss into his sweat-damp hair. Cas sighs with contentment and lets himself be held as their hearts find a matching rhythm that lulls them both closer to the edge of sleep.
Cas nods with a sniffle and lets Dean pull him to his feet and into a crushing hug. “I’m so glad,” Dean murmurs in Cas’s ear. “Come on, let's go home.”
Dean nods. He knows Cas is okay. No mortal weapon can harm them, but that is going to take time to fully sink in. He’s only just found Cas, he isn’t prepared to face losing him already. He forces himself to move on and scoots further down the bed.
“Tomorrow?” Cas squeaks, panic coloring his tone. “Gabe, I, tomorrow isn’t good.” He looks to Dean with wide eyes.
The man across from him looks so wholesome, so normal. He doesn’t deserve to be tainted by someone like Castiel. “What brings you in here this late?” Cas asks and swallows hard, unsure if he wants to know the answer.
“Steve?” A voice that makes Cas stiffen beside him is enough to pull Dean out of his memories and they turn toward the approaching man.
“If I put the phone on speaker, will you sit with me?” Cas drags his fingertips down Dean’s breastbone and back up, catching on the sparse smattering of reddish hairs that dare to grow there.
Missy locks the door behind them with a cheerful wave and Cas stuffs his hands into his too-tight pockets. “I can give you my phone number?” he offers with a shrug. He isn't going to let on how his heart patters in his chest at the thought of seeing Dean again.
He scrubs himself well enough and decides not to shave. Bal has always said his five o’clock shadow makes his eyes seem that much bluer, so he decides to with it.
Dean drapes his arms over Cas’ shoulders and looks him in the eye. “Like you could get out the door without me.” He smiles cheekily with a wink and Cas’ answering smile makes Dean’s stomach flutter wildly.
“Dean is hardly a secret.” How could he be with their pictures plastered all over the tabloids and social media?
“You had me at egg rolls, but dumplings sound good too.” At this point, Cas is ready to agree to anything Dean might suggest. He’s tired, impatient to be out of the car (not he would dare risk criticizing Baby’s comfort), and anxious to finally see where Dean lives when he isn’t on the road.
Cas looks at Dean with wide eyes that plead for forgiveness but Dean only smiles and crouches in front of the kid.
Dean’s smile grows and Cas knows he said the right thing. “Well, long story short, mom died when I was four and Sammy was a baby. Dad dragged us all over the country looking for work. He’d leave us alone for weeks on end once I got a little older and take-out gets expensive.”
His earlier mistake is downright embarrassing. He will not fool himself by assuming that Dean thinks highly of him, but he certainly has a lower opinion of him now.
The University was a little too excited to bend over backward to let a chart-topping band headline their little Pride festival, even when The Impalas demanded that all proceeds go to select LGBTQ+ charities.
“I’ll just be a few minutes,” Cas says, finally noticing how low his towel has fallen and he hurriedly hikes it back up and holds it in place as his cheeks redden. “What time do we need to be there?” He asks sheepishly as he shifts from foot to foot nervously.
“Nothing. Nothing at all,” Cas hurries to explain. “Will this be all for you?” He holds up the bag of Twizzlers with a harried smile.
around here is or even how the restaurants work. He’s only been in Italy for a day and he’s already exhausted from the emotional roller coaster he’s been riding.
Cas shakes his head as he stands shirtless in front of his open closet with his jeans open around his waist. He was barely awake and wearing nothing more than loose boxers when he decided to call Dean and he’s glad Meg at least waited until he had gotten his jeans up over his bare ass before she came barging into his room. “Come on Meg, he’s just a friend.”
Cas nods, seeing where Dean is leading. “Bad habits are hard to break,” Cas agrees as his hand reaches across the table to cover Dean’s without his permission.
Cas settles back in, tracing absent circles across Dean’s chest. “I already know you respond well to praise” He offers, listening to Dean’s heart rate increase underneath his ear. “But I think body-swapping would be problematic unless I take a different vessel, and we’ve already made it clear that incest is unacceptable”
The familiar swirl of self-hatred begins to churn in his gut and even the very temping plate of nachos in front of him isn’t enough to convince him that Cas shouldn’t hate his petty ass with every fiber of his gorgeous being.
“I need your help explaining to Cas about wearing my mark, and then we’ll need to bring all of them before Father,” Dean continues as his stomach twists and churns with dread.
He crouches down to their level and dips his chin in recognition. “Thank you,” he tells them and the fox stands and rubs against Sam’s legs like a cat before scampering off into the field. The coyote seems to smirk at Sam before licking a long stripe up his cheek and running away before Sam can complain.
He hurriedly strips out of the slacks and navy suit jacket he wore to work and carefully hangs the jacket over the hook at the back of his door and sets the shower to just cooler than scalding.
He drops his phone into a drawer and reshuffles the papers across his desk. He doesn’t expect to hear back from Dean any time soon. Or really, at all.
Cas takes a deep breath and lets it out with a sigh as he joins Alfie at the basin of water. He picks up a rag and takes over scrubbing the dishes while Alfie carefully dries them. “I fear Samandriel is closer to the truth then I would prefer to admit.” He swallows hard around his next words when he sees the way Inias’ shoulders tense. “I have been feeling strange about Dean lately and I know not what to make of my growing fondness for the man.”
Dean steps into the space between Cas’ spread knees and leans down to draw him into a petulant kiss that Cas smiling against Dean’s pouted lips.
“In here or the living room?” Dean asks once their clothing has been recovered and Cas is standing in the middle of the room with his old flip phone in hand.
A slow smile spreads over Cas’ features. “I did. Da Michele is fantastic, and I’ve gotten to know one of the cooks. You can’t stay in Naples without trying their pizza Margherita.”
Dean forces himself to turn away from the window and settle at his desk. The downside of living among mortals is needing to keep up the pretense of work.
“What is…?” Cas trails off as he reaches for the offered cup, his heart warming at the thought of Dean thinking this far ahead.
“Dean!” Cas calls, already starting to recover. He launches himself from the bed to chase after Dean.
“So, Sam,” Cas says softly as he looks to the youngest Winchester. “Have you heard what dorm you’re staying in?” When they had been in Italy, Sam was waiting for the information from the University.
The taste isn’t as awful as Cas was expecting and his stomach seems to immediately recognize the fish as sustenance and demands he eat more.
Washing the dishes goes quickly and Sam moves so easily around the kitchen that Dean has to tamp down on a pang of jealousy. Sam has been here enough to know his way around the kitchen. Even Jess has been here often enough to have Ellen doting on her and Bobby begrudgingly offering her a hug when they came through the door. Although, Dean knows his uncle well enough to know that he secretly loves hugs and would have been offended if Jess hadn’t accepted.
“Dean wanted to play a new song for me,” Cas answers with a smile, oblivious to how deep Dean’s flush is becoming.
Cas swallows hard and his eyes blow wide at the sheer hatred openly displayed in Inias’ tone. “Dean has been caring and kind to me,” He says, weakly trying to defend the man.
Cas sucks in another deep breath and fights against the tears threatening to well in his eyes. “I… I’m…”
The conversation drifts from topic to topic with Benny eventually getting roped in when Gabriel starts discussing the merits of Cajun cooking and they all lament the tragic lack of beignets throughout most of the country.
Cas shakes his head once and bites his lip. “I do, but I was just teasing before, we don’t have to if you’re not…” Cas starts to say but Dean’s huff of laughter makes his words trail into nothing.
Another flash goes off and a gaggle of voices suddenly erupt, shattering the quiet of the small arcade area they’ve found themselves in.
Dean smiles softly before glaring at the open text in front of him. “I’m gonna start dinner. Spaghetti alright with you two?” Dean asks, needing the distraction before his brain liquifies.
He winds his way through the dark alleys, sticking to the shadows. He’ll go back home with Gabriel is he has to, but he is not coming out here again.
Finally, Inias takes a deep breath and offers him a watery smile. “I could never forsake you. I have loved you for too long to forsake you.”
Dean takes a deep breath and shakes his head no. “I’m ok. Just wasn’t expecting all this actual medical stuff” He swallows hard, eyes flitting to where his legs are still resting spreading apart in stirrups.
Sam takes a long drag, taking the smoke deep into his lungs and holds it while he passes the joint back to Dean.
Dean nods along to the music, some old cassette tape of Led Zeppelin that Cas only knows a handful of songs from, but Dean has been singing every lyric under his breath for most of the last hour.
“Cas!” Dean shouts as a single shot rings out and his heart freezes in his chest. His feet may as well be made of lead for the speed they carry him to Cas’ side and his stomach lurches as Cas staggers backward.
“You told him what we do?” Meg scoots so she can wrap an arm around Cas’ back and trace soothing circles as he wallows.
Cas gives a doubtful huff but doesn’t challenge her. There is no point. Instead, he settles in closer and leans his head over hers to get a better view of the small television. The picture is fuzzy in the way that old TVs always have been but the sound is clear, and he’s more than happy to listen to Rick Steves’s soothing voice excitedly explain the culture of whatever small town he finds himself in.
“Yes. We’re all good here. I promise. See you next Thursday?” Cas shuffles in front of Dean again and pushes him back.
He snuggles in closer to the warmth at his front with a satisfied hum and he tucks his chin until something soft tickles his nose. He breathes out with a huff and wrinkles his brow, burrowing closer with determination.
Dean chuckles and reaches up to brush Castiel’s bangs out of his eyes and plants a tender kiss to the tip of his nose. “Try to sleep, then,” he whispers and Cas hums in agreement as they settle in tighter.
“It’s no trouble, Dean, I’ve been wanting a chance to speak with you but you always seem to have somewhere else to be.” Cas’ eyes have no right to make Dean feel so guilty, and yet they do. Dean would melt into a little puddle of shame if not for the cold glass of lemonade in his hand.
Samuel frowns and nods before turning a critical eye to Dean. “Do you agree with your brother’s opinion? Are you willing to take this monk for your own?” Samuel asks with an arched brow and careless wave to Castiel.
“I know,” Cas mumbles. Dean is a good man and Cas knows with all his being that he would never hurt someone the way Alastair hurt him. “Just...I need, slow?” Cas doesn’t know the right word. The one that asks for patience but he thinks Dean understands anyway.
“I’m running a little low on groceries, but I think I have everything to make bacon and pancakes. That sound okay?” Dean talks as he pulls open his refrigerator and starts digging around inside, but Cas is too busy staring at his boyfriend’s ass to listen to a word he’s saying. Dean rambles on, pulling things out and setting them on the counter next to the fridge, but Cas is lost in the vision before him, helpless to stop the disbelieving grin that’s spreading over his face.
Dean’s fingers twitch with the need to draw Cas into his arms but the yawning pit in his stomach stops him. He forces a half-smile as he reaches up to stroke the ears of the blanket. His fingers brush against Cas’ before he notices something odd at the bottom corner. “What’s this?”
Cas blinks at the screen, processing Dean’s words. It was enough to hear such a commitment from Dean when they were alone, but for him to voice those thoughts to someone important to him?
“Come on, Sunshine, you gotta tell me!” Dean whines but his eyes shine with laughter as he reaches out to snag Castiel’s hand and pull him closer.
He looks to the coffee shop as he emerges from the network of back alleys, as has become his habit, and frowns as his head tilts.
Cas sputters a laugh, remembering the incident in his apartment where Dean bravely defended him and chased out the trespassing rodent but he shakes off his amusement when he remembers Crowley calling Dean ‘Squirrel’ only a few minutes ago. “Crowley said that this was Squirrel’s room.”
Dean shrugs and leans back in for more delicious kisses but Cas pushes him off and quickly climbs over him.
“Of course it was necessary, Dean.” He wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t necessary. Besides, capitalizing on Gabriel’s arachnophobia won’t hurt anyone.
“Castiel?” the man asks, lips parting as he stares in disbelief. “Castiel Novak?” He says Cas’ full name as if Castiel weren’t already a unique enough name.
Cas sucks in a deep breath. He had suspected as much but to hear Sam put his thoughts into words causes a new spike of terror in Castiel’s gut. “Then let me go. If Dean wants to keep me safe, let me go,” Cas pleads, shaking his head as he speaks.
Dean chuckles. “Good” He mumbles, still flying high from his realizations of the night before. Why it took Cas literally beating it into him, Dean will never understand; but he’s thankful nonetheless. “What’s on the list for today?” He pushes himself up to sit and Cas follows, twining their fingers together.
