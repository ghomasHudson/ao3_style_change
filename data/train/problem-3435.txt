“Uh-last minute shopping?” Charlie said, not convincingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
But when he turned back around, intense blue eyes were still boring into him. “Uh, Cas? You okay there, buddy?”
The mug was glass -or, it felt like it, but Castiel was going to have to take the chance that it was glass- so if Castiel could just break it…
“No, Dean. I promise, I would never treat you like that. I know you have no reason to trust me right now, though.” Castiel leaned toward Dean, his brow furrowed in concern, then halted his movements when Dean flinched back minutely. “Dean, is there anything I could do to help you trust me?”
was the one who needed to be coddled by the people who had actually broken him.
Cas nodded, then absentmindedly snapped his fingers. The tree suddenly lit up with warm lights, the silver tinsel causing the light to bounce around the room. Charlie and Sam looked up at the tree in awe.
Sam grunted out a string of curse words. Dean had insisted that making his voicemail message sound like he was actually on the phone was going to be comedy gold, but Sam should really talk to him about making it shorter, should there be an emergency or some shit like that.
Cas flushed. “It appears that another basic need is human proximity. I-I woke up like this. I apologize,” he said, but he didn’t make any moves to get off of Dean.
Some of the best cookies I have ever had in my entire life. You guys are officially the bakers for every Christmas from here on out."
“I like that name,” Grace finally said, and she leaned forward suggestively, the neck of her dress dipping low enough to reveal some cleavage. Dean gave her a tight lipped smile and averted his eyes to the label of his drink, wishing desperately for some cosmic event to happen so he could escape.
It was truly a moral dilemma, and the fact that Castiel should
“-And I’m the lady of the house!” Charlie interjected.
“Dean, come here,” Cas demanded, and his voice left no room for argument. He held his arms open in an invitation. Dean swallowed thickly, before he climbed onto the bed and into Cas’ arms.
“And the gentlemen. May the odds be ever in
"I love you, Dean." Cas whispered from behind Sam. Dean blanched.
As soon as he was done, he held up the underwear Castiel had grabbed for him. But from where? Was there a closet in their room too?
“This is a terrible idea,” Dean grumbled, closing the trunk to Baby with what bordered on aggression.
p.s.- there WILL be a happy ending to this story but it may not be in this specific fic...
Dean sighed and rolled his eyes, wiping a hand on his apron. He pointed the spatula at Charlie, who stopped chewing mid-bite, her cheeks flaring out like a chipmunk caught eating too many walnuts.
Had it really only been a few days?
Cas looked at her quizzically. “Your...husband?”
Then he turned towards the house, and prepared himself for the hell that he would be put through as soon as he walked through the door.
Dean cursing was muffled, but he got the point across by glaring daggers at Tisiphone and Aphrodite, as if by sheer will and hatred he could make them spontaneously combust and make this all go back to normal (or, as normal as it could get for the Winchesters).
if he could manage to make Cas uncomfortable.
“Dee, Cas is gone.”
That was unacceptable.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief when he laid eyes on his car. “There she is,” he said, pointing to the Impala, one of the last cars in the lot.
Cas shook his head, an almost apologetic smile painting his features the same shade of blue as his eyes. “I’m sorry, sir, I don’t know who you are. Or what you’re doing in my room, for that matter,” he said, gesturing with a hand to encompass the entirety of their (
Castiel were to wake up and somehow escape his bonds, he’d have to step on Dean to escape.
Cas sighed. “Can you please stop singing that song?”
Dean looked out the back window as the man stumbled a little bit and ran in a diagonal before veering off the road and into a bush. He sighed, because when had
reading out loud to the whole class because everytime the letters would do a jig he’d get tongue tied and then his teacher -or God forbid,
Okay, maybe Cas wasn’t
Dean shrugged to Castiel’s leaving figure, then squinted around the room. There had to be a window in here somewhere, right? There was absolutely no way Castiel lived in a room without windows.
Dean studied his face for a moment, probably looking for any sign that Castiel was faking it, before reaching up to untie Castiel’s hands. The tension in Castiel’s shoulders released immediately and he let out a small sigh of content.
Cas seemed to notice Dean’s increasingly crumbling façade and smiled sweetly at the man. “We’d like to check into our room, please.”
“Can I request a song?” Charlie asked, her eyes sparkling mischievously.
“Shh, Lise, it’s okay. It’s going to be all right,” Dean said, and he winced at the lie as he led Lisa over to a plush couch that looked softer than any he had ever sat on in his entire life.
was talking to him, but by that point, Cas had pulled out his (faux) badge and said “We would like to ask you a few questions, ma’am. Are you the owner of this establishment?”
Charlie and Sam continued their teenage-girls-at-a-sleepover routine into the car, which allowed Dean to take a little peek at the package Cas had handed him.
“She’s sure the person I’m giving this drawing to will love it,” Cas said quietly, and he glanced nervously over at Dean. “I’m not so sure.”
<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>
Dean had always made it a game with Sam, when they were younger. They tried to see who could go out the farthest, dig the deepest hole, hide the most stuff in the smallest hole.
Luke was still out there, and if Dean was crying with his foot stuck in a hole like a goddamn baby, then who would protect Cas if Luke should try something like that again?
Castiel scoffed. “I would, except the door is closed and my hands are, quite literally, tied.”
Dean ran a hand through his sandy hair, and it came away wet, even though Dean didn’t remember taking a shower.
need to study, after all), but thought better of it. He wasn't learning anything anyways.
“It really wasn’t that hard to figure out. You seem to crave other people’s touch,” Cas said, and Dean pulled his head back to look at him. “I apologize if I’m overstepping boundaries.”
“-Don’t want a lot for Christmas. Therreee is just one thing IIII neeeeeed.” Dean sang, moving his arms dramatically. “I don’t care about the presents, underneath the Christmas tree.” Dean gestured to the Christmas tree. “I just want you for my own, moooore than you could ever know.” Dean sang, sashaying around the room with apparently no shame. Charlie reached for the speaker and turned up the volume until it she could almost see the sound waves vibrating through the air, rattling their teeth.
Seriously. The dude was wearing a fucking
Yeah, he probably should’ve asked how to get out to the back.
Then Castiel realized that the handle he was holding wasn’t sharp enough to do any damage, so he dropped to the floor and inspected the remaining pieces.
The door opened, revealing a taller and fuller body than Sam.
Cas looked down at Dean with empty, burned out eyes as he repeated himself. "I love you."
Oh god, the

Dean stuttered. “Well, I-I d-don’t either-

The record in the background
"Two words: Pizza. Man." Dean said as he walked down the hall. Cas stopped abruptly as realization dawned on him.
Castiel kept his eyes closed tightly as he swung the first aid kit as hard as he could at about head level. It was dark, and as soon as he had seen the door open, he hit the fucker in the face.

ever heard.
A song began playing on the radio, and suddenly, every house on the block lit up in tandem. Cas’ eyes widened and a small smile danced on his lips as he watched the lights blink and dance to the music.
Luke bared his teeth at Alastair, but straightened up immediately. Dean followed suit as he watched John rub a hand over his face and sit up.
Dean grabbed Cas’ hand and guided it over the
“Aye, it was, but now the cops are involved, and that could get us all arrested,” Crowley said calmly. John’s nose twitched.
Dean snorted and then made a face, trying to disguise his smile with a scowl.
Dean was about to say something about taking care of some business by putting his fist in Tisiphone’s face (it definitely wasn’t one of his better comebacks, but these were stressful times, okay?) when the door opened, allowing Aphrodite to walk in with a dramatic flourish. Behind her was a woman with light brown hair and grey eyes, fidgeting nervously with the hem of her mulberry blouse.
Lisa bit her lip, looking worried. “So be shy, demure, blend into the background but don’t do it so well someone thinks I’d make a good accessory.”
“Fuc-“
Dean looked away, blushing.
Castiel sat, and Sam hit play on the movie.
When Dean didn’t respond (because how would he respond to that? An alpha not just using him? Wanting to talk to him? It couldn’t be) Castiel tacked on “As equals. Talk as equals?”
He couldn’t help but wish that was what had happened. He’d trade in the gorgeous room in a heartbeat if it meant there wasn’t the presence of a strange alpha looming over him.
“P-“ Dean started, and he stopped, cleared his throat, and licked his lips before he could continue. “Please.”
“Dean,” Castiel breathed out, and Dean closed his eyes as he felt the alpha walking towards him. “Co-come sit down.”
and then turned on the radio. The sound of Christmas music filled the small Bug and Dean let out a growl.
Cas pointed towards a diner on the side of the road and Dean pulled into a parking spot. He turned Baby’s engine off and bounced back against the seat, running a hand through his hair.
the knife slipped, he would end up slitting his wrist. (Not that
The thought immediately embarrassed Dean so thoroughly that he blushed and briskly turned towards the door. He had his hand on the door handle when Cas’ voice over his shoulder stopped him dead in his tracks.
is Winchester Surprise a soup?? or am I losing my mind?? or both?? also, apologies for another short chapter, but the suspense is almost as high as my stress levels. :)
They walked out into the snowy night in a comfortable silence, Dean looking up at the sky in awe. Castiel watched as Dean stuck his tongue out to catch a snowflake, then giggled when Dean made a triumphant noise when one landed on his tongue. Dean grinned at Castiel, freckles shimmering against his skin that was tinted red from the cold, green eyes framed by dirty blonde lashes that glistened with snowflakes.
leg room! At all!”
“No, it’s not your fault, but it
Dean laughed humorlessly before whipping around to the bar and calling to the bartender for some shots.
Dean got up from his chair and handed Sam his phone. “Don’t go snooping or I will break your nose, got it?”
Dean looked at Cas in surprise. “Since when does an angel stop and smell the roses?”
outside, he wasn't feeling especially rowdy. (All he really wanted to do was grab a bottle of whiskey and down it.) Bass was causing vibrations to rattle Dean's bones, and there was a wave of bodies slamming together to the beat.
Dean cursed himself for thinking that about his best friend and turned over onto his stomach, his head facing away from Cas and all his perfection. He closed his eyes and let the tentacles of sleep wind their way into his consciousness.
Dean turned to sit on the bed. He kept his feet on the floor, and balanced his elbows on his knees, holding his head in his head. “Twisted bastard likes to see what he did to me the day after, then I can clean up.”
“Good job, buddy. Soon you’ll be evading the tax man and complaining about your back like a true human,” Dean said, and he reached across the seat to ruffle Cas’ hair like nothing had happened between them on the beach (and like Dean hadn’t had a panic attack while waiting for Cas to get back to the car).
He knew he should run, but he felt frozen in place; a literal deer in headlights.
Cas’ eyes were still closed, and Dean smoothed a wrinkle from his frown out of his forehead with his thumb. Cas’ entire face softened with the touch, and Dean melted a little bit.
With a snap of Cas’ fingers, Tisiphone was gone. (Dean hoped she landed in either a super-max prison or the bottom of a shallow grave, but hey, at least she wasn’t messing up their sheets anymore.)
Dean took his bags of groceries and ran out to Baby, fighting with his vocal chords the whole time.
Cas opened and closed his mouth like a fish.
“Dean,” Castiel said, softly, and Dean looked up, just barely. “You don’t need to get naked for me. Just take these clothes and dry yourself off, all right?”
untied him.
The waiter raised an eyebrow. “Perhaps the chardonnay, but my personal favorite is the merlot.”
Everybody avoided looking at each other for a good thirty seconds.
picked this God forsaken bar. They didn’t even have a decent tequila.” Dean put his hands on his knees and pushed himself into a standing position, swaying slightly from said tequila and the overflow of emotions he had been subject to in the past few hours. “Stupid Siri. I’m telling you, Sammy, the robots
Dean scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Well, don’t get too excited for me, you might pull a muscle.” With that, he threw the door open and walked out.
Sam rolled his eyes and settled in against the cold window of the Impala.
the mattress was actually really fucking comfortable, and it
The trunk was open, and Castiel watched as someone closed it back up, rocking the car again.
If Castiel wasn’t mistaken, Dean almost looked
Castiel hesitated before nudging the window open the tiniest bit. It creaked in protest, and Castiel pinched his eyes closed.
Castiel tilted his head. “I can take the floor. You sustained some injuries tonight that will only hurt worse in the morning if you refrain from sleeping in a bed.”
Sam looked at him, his eyes widening. “Hell no, Dean. Your face looks more awful than it usually does.”
Eileen snapped her fingers in front of his face. “Sam, I love you, but you have to focus.”
It suddenly struck Dean that the ocean in front of him, lit up by pale moonlight, was the same color of Cas’ eyes, and the calm water reflected how he felt with Cas in his arms or how he felt with Cas wrapped around him.
"Uh, Charlie, what the hell?" Sam asked, eyes practically bulging out of his head like a cartoon character. Charlie shrugged, as if to say
“Are you the pizza man? Do you have the pizza?” The woman asked again, pointing into Dean’s chest and leaning dangerously into him, almost swaying in her stiletto heels.
“Perhaps a romantic ghost?” Cas theorized, and Dean rolled his eyes.

, Sam’s baby pictures, and puppies), then he didn’t know what was. “Cas.”
need for legroom.”
He turned toward the massive shelves of the library, listening to the sounds of people getting lost in a world of words, following their favorite heroes as they journeyed far from home, accomplishing tasks and completing their adventures. (Granted, most of the population in the library was probably studying, clutching a cup of coffee like a lifeline, wishing they were literally
Aw, damn. Cas had been sitting there,
Cas smiled warmly at Dean before taking two muffins and offering one to the hunter. “Would you like to try? Some things
“Nice to see you too-“ Dean paused as recognition hit him. “I never gave you my name?” He had meant it to come out as a cold hard fact but instead it came as a question.
Tisiphone smiled, wicked and jagged. “Oh honey, we’re just taking care of some business. We’ll be out of your hair in a jiffy.”
Castiel didn’t help the heavy silence at all as he stared at Dean, seeming to look into his soul.
“We’re supposed to be a couple, remember?” Cas said, and Dean raised an eyebrow.
was in there somewhere.
Tisiphone walked back into the room holding a bucket she got from God-knows-where, the sound of sloshing water loud in the relative silence of the room, save for the low hum of the TV.
Dean sighed and rubbed his eyes as he sat up. “Nightmares?”
"Y-you got some, uh- s-some flour on your face." Dean said, his voice low and a little hoarse. He cleared his throat as he rubbed his thumbs over Cas' cheekbones, the ghost of a touch

when Cas was acting all suspicious.
“You didn’t come cause you thought I’d be an easy conquest and you could see the Capitol?” Dean could hardly believe it.
When he returned to his seat, the stranger was nose-deep in a pretty thick textbook, and Castiel sat down with a suppressed sigh so he didn't disturb him. He looked down at his book and sighed, more audibly this time, and began to cram for winter finals.
Sam was watching in the rearview mirror, and since the music was still blasting, he leaned over and said to Charlie, “They’re talking again.”
which Dean thought was a little weird, but whatever. The outside of the bar was a minty green with what used to be white shutters and a white door (now the paint was peeling, revealing a dark blue). The neon lights were starting to blink on, signalling that the bar was just opening.
Charlie put a hand to her ear. “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that.”
Castiel was still asleep in the same position as before, though the way that Dean had tied him up left little room for movement.
Dean was powerless to stop the tears.
to us and we'd just have a plate of cookies waiting. B, I'm the chef of the house, so I got this under control. And three, you guys should at least tell us why you want
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas said, and Dean opened one eye. Cas was facing him, his face so close to Dean’s that Dean could feel his breath. Cas was watching him, blue eyes sparkling like a lake in the moonlight. His expression was soft, and his lips were pulled up in a small, content smile.
“Pinky promise?” The man offered, holding his little finger out with hesitant -and almost hysteric- hope written all over his face.
“I don’t know, when we ganked that maid-witch-lady.”
see coming.
Then Dean took in his own room through Castiel’s eyes, and figured it was pretty decent looking. Compared to the rest of the house (except for Sam’s bedroom, because Dean made sure his room was always clean), Dean’s room was fairly well kept.
Dean glanced at Cas, who was looking back at him a
“Stay here,” Castiel said, and when he stuffed the sock in Sam’s mouth, he winced and added, “-please?”
Castiel sighed. “That’s why I didn’t say anything. You have incentive to keep me now,” Castiel tilted his head at Dean. “You’ll probably just get the ransom money and kill me anyways.”
Sam put his hands up in surrender. “A, I’m sure Cas would absolutely love fake dating you. Two, whatever it is probably won’t know that you guys are fake dating if you
Sam was intrigued by this. He looked both ways, then over the balcony to make sure nobody was listening. He turned back to Charlie to see her sprinting off towards her newly acquired yet ancient turquoise Volkswagen Bug, beckoning back to Sam to follow her. Sam rolled his eyes and sighed dramatically before running after her.
The Winchesters grunted, straining to push the mangled tree into position. “Better?” Dean panted, licking his lips as he looked at Cas.
Dean was raising his fist to do so when the door opened, revealing a middle aged woman with blonde hair.
Dean froze. He wasn’t sure how to react.
Castiel walked over to the bed and sat down, wincing. His shoulders shifted to an uncomfortable angle as he moved his arms around behind his back.
“Dean, we’re out of kale!” Sam called from the kitchen, pouting as he shoved one measly piece of green into his
It was obviously a tropical bar, with fishing nets and bobbers hanging from the ceiling. There were randomly shaped string lights, some were flip flops, some were fish, and some were… bikini tops?
gonna believe him.
Eileen threw her hands up in frustration. “Sam! What if whatever it is down in Florida has Castiel and your brother?”
"I'll bet you ten bucks they make out on the counter and one of them ends up setting the other on fire!" Sam said, wheezing a little bit.
He felt a burning sensation right between his eyebrows, Sam clawed at his cheek. "Ow!" Dean hissed. His jaw unhinged as realization struck.
Dean reached up to cover Castiel’s hand with his own. “He will - he’ll -“
Dean took a thoughtful bite. “How did you know Alastair’s name?”
alright, Cas?”
“Hopefully your dad calls us in tomorrow, ‘cause I wanna see this fresh meat,” Luke called as Dean opened the door and ran towards his car.
Dean could feel Cas’ tears dripping onto his shirt, the angel’s grace seeping into his skin through the small drops of water. When he pulled Cas up to eye level, the other’s eyes were glistening metallic with both unshed tears and the grace that was escaping through his sorrow.
something Dean needed added to this shitstorm of a criminal’s day.

“Whoa, whoa, Cas, take a deep breath. Dean’s fine, he’s just out on a beer run, he’ll be back soon, you don’t need to worry,” Sam said, pulling Cas back just as he began to hyperventilate, a new experience that came with more human, less grace. “And Dean loves you too, everyone but him knows it, but once he figures it out, he’ll tell you, okay?”
“Dean, for the love of God!” Sam exclaimed, shoving his brother out of the way and dropping his stuff. “Jesus Christ, you’re lucky you're my brother, or you would’ve been dead a long time ago.”
Castiel was only vaguely aware that the high pitched mechanical whining he had woken up to had stopped.
Dean sighed and ran into the room, quickly turned the TV down, and then ran back out. He walked into the kitchen, grabbed his leather jacket, and snuck outside through the door.
Cas smiled apologetically, like he was about to ask Dean to eat a slug or something (and not feel guilty about it). “I would prefer to learn in the Impala.”
Dean twisted and realized that it was Cas’ arm, keeping him seared against the angel’s body like a vise.
Dean shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat. “Well, as I was saying, the first rule should be to only act the way we need to where we need to.”
Dean finally let out a chuckle that threatened to turn into a full-on laugh when Cas looked at him with a wrinkle in between his eyebrows.
Out of the hundreds of slips of paper, Ellen chose one, flipping it open and pausing to bring the microphone up to her mouth.
Cas nodded and smiled, his eyes shining with tears. Dean’s entire body sagged in relief, and he felt his own eyes begin to sting with tears.
Dean nodded, still too shaken by

The man sputtered for a minute before climbing into the passenger seat and reaching for the wheel. Dean swerved, barely missing a collision with another car, and elbowed the guy’s arms out of the way. “Stop! Just stop! I don’t want to have to tie you up but I will if I fucking have to!”
Sam scoffed. “Yeah, go ahead, just completely ignore
Dean laughed. “It’s an exaggeration, Cas.”
that Dean had to look away to avoid a blush. Sam watched the whole interaction with amusement.
Cas nodded, but Charis was too busy sighing dreamily at the man who was now snoring loudly on the bed. “Isn’t he just the sweetest thing?” She whispered, and Dean just grabbed Cas’ hand and let himself out.
Castiel was flustered, pulling his hand back quickly enough that the sleeping boy whined softly in his sleep at the loss of contact. The stranger was most definitely

“Alright, Cas,” Dean rubbed his hands together. “Where to?”
“You guys are psychopaths.” Sam muttered, before wrinkling his nose and scampering off in search of water to get the God-awful taste off his tongue.
“Well played, little brother, and usually I would be proud, but we need some info. Pronto.” Dean said, tapping his thumbs on the steering wheel as he looked out the windshield.
"They aren't, no, but they're spending time together. We should go try to convince them to use the little walker thingies." Charlie said, leading Sam towards the edge of the rink near where Cas and Dean were sitting.
John’s snoring assaulted his ears almost immediately and Dean relaxed minutely. He took off his leather jacket, toed off his shoes, and crept up the stairs, moving as fast as he dared.
He sang along to the music echoing from the speaker Charlie had brought. Dean’s pointing caused the tree to collapse to his side, eliciting a yelp from Sam.
The last of the packages had been loaded, and Dean turned to Cas (and completely ignored his brother and Charlie).
Dean clenched his jaw, willing the tears not to escape. A single one disobeyed, and then he looked up at Sam, his eyes cold and hard.
He didn’t.
“You realize, I’ve been with Alastair for a couple months now. I can take care of myself.”
stopped the argument before it could really start. Castiel looked around, thoroughly confused as Gabriel looked as though he had had an epiphany (which was very rare).
. “Oh, Dean.”
“I have to show you something,” he said, and his voice was so nervous and stoic that Cas furrowed his brow.
The kid looked up and rolled his eyes.
"Castiel, nice to meet you." Dean held onto Castiel's hand for a moment longer than necessary, but not long enough to mean anything obvious.
The absence of Castiel’s sense of sight made his other senses heighten, and suddenly he was aware of how
also: listen to the Lorde version of this chapter’s song ;)
Cas’ face remained neutral, but his eyes flashed with something Dean couldn’t quite place.
Dean just sat there, because wow, Cas just said that he looked wonderful (like a prince, even). He was so stunned at the compliment that he jumped when Cas knocked on the window.
The door to the Roadhouse opened and Sam stumbled in, his hair (Dean would call it "luscious", as it was the only word that accurately described the sasquatch's hair, but Sam had been insisting it was luscious so Dean refused to comply) ratted wildly as he whipped his head around to look at Dean.
Cas’ eyes widened a bit when he saw Dean, and Dean returned the gesture. He rarely ever saw Cas without his coat, just in his plain suit, and he looked so rumpled and naked and
“Dean, I-“ Sam started.
likes him better’n he likes me, but what c’n ya do?” Dean lifted his shoulder in a sort of
Castiel blushed, a light red dusting his cheeks like the blush he had helped Dean pick out so long ago. “I’m just making an offer, Dean,” he said quietly, looking down at his meager serving of eggs.
Dean grinned sheepishly, then reached for Castiel's coat that was lying on the table. He handed the tan trench coat to Castiel, which Castiel took with a shy look, his fingers brushing Dean's.
(and maybe he could get sick to his stomach or something and hightail it into the bathroom and climb out the back window).
Cas looked up, contemplating. “Maybe it should be that there are no restrictions for showing affection when we are being watched.”
Dean threw his hands up. “Of course it’s ‘of import’-“ Dean pitched his voice lower to imitate Castiel’s deep timbre. “Before, you were just some random guy I accidentally kidnapped.
?” Eileen asked, setting down her wooden cooking spoon to sign to Sam. The flannel shirt she was wearing over her bra and underwear raised up just a little bit, and Sam got distracted. “Sam?”
Dean bobbed his head from side to side in contemplation as Baby’s steering wheel slid under his fingers like a snake. “So, what, we’re thinking it’s...something at this bar? A hooker, maybe?”
“C’mon, Dean, just until we can gank this guy.”
we’re working. Also, what the hell would infidelity have to do with soulma-“
Sam sighed and ran a hand over his face. “Research is harder than it looks, guys. You would understand if you had more than two brain cells.”
Sam had picked the room for them. He had reserved it ahead of time since it was a fancy hotel and all.
Cas smiled sleepily, and he shook his head just the slightest bit, reciprocating.
Castiel smiled, his heart
“So what you’re saying is that we need to find another guy who’s sticking his dick in places it shouldn’t be.” Dean said, enjoying his burger with half lidded eyes.
Dean blinked at him.
“I was doing
“Dean!”
snort Dean had ever heard. Dean’s smile stretched wide, and Cas covered his mouth with his hand while his hysterical laugh quieted down to a hearty chuckle.
Chocolate chip (obviously)

Castiel sighed and cursed himself. Why was he even considering this? Dean had
Castiel looked at him fully, a wistful and almost protective look flashing through his eyes. “Of course, Dean. Please let me know if you ever need anything, okay?”
Dean fought off a sigh, because he really
Dean hummed the rest of the lyric, not quite remembering the words. He maneuvered Cas backwards to avoid being tackled by a pair of ambitious teenage boys that appeared to be racing.
Cas looked around curiously, because Dean had rarely ever let him anywhere near the classic cars that were held in there (something about headlights busting when Cas got excited).
. Now Cas was semi-awake and Dean could shimmy out of the almost guaranteed conversation about the norms of waking up a friend you were fake dating-slash-fake married to.
“Shhh,” Castiel said, a finger on Dean’s mouth, and Dean snapped back to the present. Castiel had changed into some soft pajama pants, Dean could feel them with his bare shins. He was lying next to Dean, wiping the tears he hadn’t even known had fallen off of his freckled cheeks.
one wake up a complete stranger they had been watching sleep for the past few hours?
Dean.
Eileen shrugged. That had been the one part she hadn’t been able to figure out. Sam paced back and forth, mumbling to himself as Eileen read the book he had been working on. She was reading it upside down, untouched from where Sam had left it, when Sam sat back down with a huff.
Dean turned suddenly, throwing a glance at Sam before kneeling down in front of Castiel. “Heya, sweetheart. Gotta go down to m’ dad, but I’ll be back up soon ‘s I can.” Dean grabbed the rope from earlier and tied Castiel’s ankle back to the bedpost.
Cas sighed and looked longingly out the window like an overdramatic main character in a bad romance movie. “Unfortunately.”
Cas shook his head and bit into his bacon burger and made a little noise that had Dean regretting even
Cas looked down at his feet, tears threatening to spill onto his cheeks. Dean nudged his head up until he was seeing Dean through blurry eyes. “Talk to me, man,” Dean said softly, worry prominent in his chiseled features.
Maybe Castiel really just wanted to talk? It shouldn’t be possible.
Naomi waved at him condescendingly, before coming around to one of the back windows and knocking on it slowly with a single knuckle.
“Are you the pizza man?” The woman slurred, and yeah, that was the last bullet point on his date’s profile, so maybe it was her opening line or something.
Dean was touched by the look of sadness in Cas’ eyes, and was tempted to switch around into the booth next to Cas and give him a hug.
“Laurel, my dear, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have this dance with Castiel.” Dean said, charm dripping off his voice like honey.
Castiel‘s eyes looked full of apologies. “I know, I’m sorry. Let’s go get some breakfast and maybe some allergy pills, yeah?”
Anything was possible in the Capitol.
“Cas, this looks like a good tree, right?”
Castiel offered a hesitant smile in return, but he was still confused. “Dean doesn’t have friends?”
Mary never told anyone what the secret ingredient was.
It was pretty basic department store wrapping, but one thing stood out to Dean right before he set the gift down.
“Put your
Dean shook his head once and leaned forward to capture Cas’ lips in a kiss. Cas made a surprised sound, but then he relaxed into the kiss and Dean could feel the angel smile. Dean smiled back, and then pulled back the tiniest bit. “I think that’s how we break the curse, Cas.”
Sam huffed, and rolled his eyes as he reached for a cookie. His eyes widened as he sunk his teeth into it.
He was just...pretty.
Cas inhaled sharply, before sitting back down and nodding more than he needed to. “Okay,” he said, trying to convince himself to calm down. “Okay.”
Dean wouldn’t be prepared.
“C’mere, baby brother,” Dean said, patting the small space on the bed next to him.
to be a perfect child (but never succeeding), was almost intoxicating.
have accidentally broken cover to check her out. She was breathtakingly beautiful, her slight build covered in freckles from living in the sunshine state. She was wearing short cut-off jean shorts and a turquoise bikini top that complimented her tan skin wonderfully.
Cas sighed happily and opened his mouth for more, and Dean happily complied.
Before he could react, Laurel grabbed Cas’ hand and hauled him up with strength that Cas most definitely did
Cas shifted uncomfortably. “What if we-”
time).
“Shh, Sam, don’t say anything,” Castiel pleaded, leading the younger Winchester around his brother and to the bed. “Please.”
He called the bartender for another round of shots.
“What is it?”
Cas was sitting in his room, staring at the wall when Dean came in. Cas didn’t even register the other presence in the room until Dean put a cautious hand on his shoulder.
"Dean, get in the car." Charlie said through gritted teeth. The smile pasted on her face was intimidating in its sweetness, giving Dean some major
in the title, and after the pillow fight incident, Cas wasn't sure he was ready for that particular story.
Dean let out a hearty laugh. "It's 'biscochitos', Cas." He walked over to Cas to stick his finger in the bowl he was mixing, coming away with a fingertip full of cookie dough. As he licked his finger, Cas flushed. "Also,
“Dude, what the hell?” Dean asked when his brain quit short circuiting and he managed to realize that Cas was tugging him forward.
Dean cleared his throat (awkwardly, but he was trying extremely hard [heh] not to think about the problem making itself known between his legs). “Anyways, do you want to try again?”
Charlie woke up with a start, then stretched like a cat as she looked around the room. "Mmmmmm. Morning, Dean-o."
Dean stopped himself from babbling further by shoving a fry into his mouth. It was one of those good fries, fluffy on the inside, just a tiny bit crunchy on the outside, salty enough to ward off a demon, and fresh out of the oven. Dean smiled a little bit before he realized Cas was still looking like Dean had kicked his angel puppy.
Should he take the chance? Should he open the window, climb out, and make a run for it? Castiel wasn’t sure where his car was, which way was back to town, or even how long it would take to get there. Could he walk to the nearest house and get help? Was there even any other houses this far out?
Cas stirred,
Dean turned the corner into the self-proclaimed
“Who the fuck are you?!”
“Oh, shut the hell up and try one, Sammy!” Dean said (before Charlie could say something more vulgar), breaking his eyes away from Cas as the timer went off for the oven.
Charlie grinned as she elbowed Sam harder than necessary in the stomach. Dean watched this play out in his peripheral vision, but when Sam leaned over to listen to Charlie whisper something into his ear, he just rolled his eyes.
“I-you-oh my god.” Dean squeaked out, and the pink of his face matched the color that the lights around them turned.
Until finally someone picked up.
He splashed some water on his face and looked in the mirror, and considered saying
angel. “Y’know that nightmare I keep having? I went there.”

Sorry it took so long to get this chapter up. I’m still new to this.😂
grin lopsidedly back at Cas (like the idiot he was), and when he did, Cas’ smile stretched impossibly wider.
take over the world, and even we won’t be able to stop them.”
“Sammy, please tell me you got something,” Dean said, putting the phone up to his ear.
The noise would be a perfect cover for Castiel to leave. He could tie Sam up, sneak down the stairs, out the door and into his car without being spared a second glance.
Cas peered into it to find dozens of ornaments in smaller boxes. The boxes each had the name of a different city on them, from all over the country. He heard an almost inaudible
“Thank you. For everything.” There weren’t really words for how much Dean appreciated Castiel’s kindness. He hoped that a smile and maybe some courage on his part would be enough.
Dean led the way out of the room and down the stairs -“To the guest bathroom, ‘cause nobody ever uses it and I
"Well, Samuel, I will spread holiday cheer if I want to. I brought drinks, presents,
“We still need the goddamn money,” John retorted, whirling towards the boys. He pointed at Alastair and Luke. “You two camp out on the road, make sure no cops come sniffin’. I’ll handle the ransom drop, Crowley’ll take care of the money.”
“Okay, guys, I brought
He looked around frantically, starting to get claustrophobic, because he was sure there would be a window inside the bathroom.
“Just for the record, everybody, I said this was a terrible idea,” Dean announced, before opening the door to Baby and getting into the driver’s seat. “A fucking awful idea, really.”
If Dean was being honest, he was about to cut her hair off and fall asleep from boredom.
, Dean-o.” Charlie said brightly, intentionally ignoring the way Dean shifted his hand into his lap.
not, because he was only human, and he couldn’t help it if every so often a very specific angel made a guest appearance in some not-so-angelic positions.
Maybe Dean
Alastair struggled, feet kicking aimlessly at the dirt, before he slumped. Luke held on for a minute longer than strictly necessary, then let go of Alastair. He wiped his hands off on his wet jeans, picked up the duffel bag, hopped into the truck and drove away.
He was just beginning to study the cool table top of the bar, which was glass but had water underneath that was reaching towards him and then retracting like waves on the shore when the woman suddenly appeared behind the bar, scrubbing it with a towel.
downstairs wants me to do and by taking the hits for my little brother. So I
“Let’s switch teams, yeah? Cas and I versus you two?” Dean said, already walking over, planting himself behind Cas and slinging an arm over his shoulder.
After four and a half minutes of asking around (and some embarrassing moments of awful acting), Dean finally managed to find the woman outside, staring at the setting sun as her sundress nipped at her calves in the slight breeze.
Apparently, Charlie did this every year with Dorothy in Oz, so she was pretty damn good at it, skating circles around Sam as she laughed at his misfortune.
“In there,” Dean said instead, pointing to the last door on the left. Castiel obediently walked towards it and stopped in front of it.
“Let’s be a couple,” Dean blurted out, which, okay, that wasn’t what he had
Tisiphone nodded, smiling like she was going to enjoy putting an end to Dean’s life. “I was born ready, m’lady.”
Castiel chuckled, drumming a thumb on the steering wheel. “I know, Dean,” he said, glancing over his shoulder as a large car zoomed past. “But it doesn’t mean you have to.”
“I won’t try to escape,” Castiel assured, but Dean’s apologetic face turned into one of doubt. “I won’t! Can you at least untie me so I can use the bathroom?”
, and his entire body ached.
enjoy this chapter from Dean’s pov!
The man nodded. “What’s the name?”
he hit the
Then Dean realized something. “Hey, how did you drive for eight hours without waking me up by swerving or crashing or whatever?”
So he walked up to the counter, handed over the super soft bee pajama pants like a man, and then promptly provided one of the credit cards Charlie had given them that one time.
Castiel had spit the gag out (after a long struggle and some tests of his flexibility) and was rubbing his wrists together frantically to try to get enough friction to break the rope when someone opened the door.
Cas played with Dean's dirty blonde hair until the movie stopped playing, then turned off the TV. He took one last glance at how peaceful Dean looked, his eyes closed, lips parted, and then flew them to Dean's room. Cas was standing next to Dean’s bed, where he had placed the hunter.
The tree needs some decorating, and Dean gets a little carried away with the Christmas music.
"It's gotta be some kind of djinn. But these aren't g-good dreams. These are fucking nightmares!" Dean said, motioning towards the angel, who had slumped against the bar, cheek squished against the wood, mumbling "I love you, Dean."
An hour and a half later, the four musketeers turned onto a dirt road just outside of town in an old farmer’s truck with a large bed. The cabin only had a single bench seat, and because Sam had insisted on driving and Charlie had initiated a heated game of
It was this comparison that drew Cas’ attention to the cold of Dean’s hands, still enclosed in his own, and the slight fog that grew between them with each ragged exhale.
Cas blushed. “I-I don’t know, Dean.”
Castiel crept down the stairs as quietly as he could in his dress shoes, which, in retrospect, he should’ve traded out for a pair of Dean’s shoes, something easier to run in, but it was too late to go back now.
“Dean,” Castiel said, a warning tone in his voice.
"I think you have an unhealthy relationship with your car." Charlie said, looking
thank you thank you thank you again to my wonderful beta, you have made sure all the chapters are actually coherent and helped me in more ways then I can count.
Sam beamed at her, because while she was beautiful all the time, she was especially lovely in one of his flannel shirts and a messy bun, slurping the soup she had made for him.
Dean could hear Cas’ heartbeat speed up. He smiled. “I-I mean, if you would like to. It’s really okay, I know you don’t-don’t ‘swing that way’, as you would say, but-“
CHRISTMAS!!!
And even if he did get reaped, what real loss would that be?
Castiel shrugged. “Whatever. Can you untie me?”
So much for the kind, soothing friend.
“Echo! No! Get off the bed!” Another weight landed next to the other. “Bob!”
in his Dean-cave, it would have to be a neutral color.)
sorry this took so long but, yknow, Life™️
“What’s your name, son?” Ellen asked, her eyes reminding Dean all too much of Mary.
The waitress sighed dreamily but rushed off before she could explain herself.
(It would take longer than he would’ve liked it to, but Dean had come unprepared. He shouldn’t have let Charlie and Sam talk him out of leaving his gun in the car, because they would be with “innocent old ladies”. These women were anything but innocent, and Dean would never admit this out loud, but they were freaking
“Cas, it’s me,” Dean said groggily as Tisiphone tied him to the stupid king sized bed in their stupid honeymoon suite.
Dean was just a warm body. The guy who had fucking
“I care for you...
Dean blinked. He hadn’t thought about that. “No, we’ll let you go. I’ll make sure of it, but I can’t until someone pays.”
all the water stayed in the bucket by some magical force of nature.
Sam made an indignant sound that Dean chose to ignore. “And thanks for asking, but we ganked the fucking
Sam looked at Dean like he was an idiot (which is still up for debate). “Dude, he’s literally standing right-” Cas wasn’t there anymore. Huh. Sam turned around in a circle, looking for any awkward trench coats in his vicinity. “Where’d he go?”
He turned back around to find Castiel studying him, idly rubbing his wrists. “You realize you don’t have to tell me everything you’re going to do. I mean, I appreciate it, but I kinda concluded that you’d be tying me up again.”
“So get this,” he said, right on cue. Sam leaned forward, nearly bringing his book down on the bowl of Winchester Surprise. “Both myrtle and rose petals are symbols of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, beauty, passion, and pleasure. She came from sea foam, which was that bar… and pearls are also a symbol, which explains…”
“Dean,” Castiel said gently, yet sternly, and Dean looked to the floor as he fell to his knees. He could feel the disturbance in the air as Castiel strode towards him, and he flinched away, bracing for a hit, for
Dean full on laughed at that. “You realize we are two men, right?”
Besides, Naomi and Chuck couldn’t take away something they didn’t know existed, right?
Aphrodite shook her head, her hair shimmering slightly around her shoulders like a wave refusing to move. “Then why would you cheat on him?”
“Time?” He barked, knuckling the sleep out of one eye.
Castiel drifted off to sleep.
in his eyes that Dean would rather not think about.
Sam did a double take at the defeated look on Cas’ face before settling in front of the camera. “How would he be brea-oh.”
that’s it. wow, I can’t believe it’s actually over. I hope you had as much fun reading this chaotic bunch of words as I did writing it! :)
Before he could think better of it, Dean grabbed the sides of Cas’ face, and, despite every instinct in him screaming at him to
“You’re beautiful, you know that?” Dean said, reaching up to trace Cas’ jawline with his pointer finger.
we’re almost in the home stretch😬
Cas cleared his throat. “
Charlie gasped. “I love this song!” She whispered, and turned the radio up until the car was shaking.
When Sam and Charlie returned to the kitchen, utterly exhausted from their impromptu trip to town, putting up the lights, and maniacal scheming, they both stopped short at the threshold to the kitchen.
Cas nodded and led the way to their room. He slid the keycard into the slot, and as the light lit up green to indicate that the door was unlocked, he pushed open the door.
Dean pinched his eyebrows together, an action he usually attributed to Cas. “Uh, ma’am, who’s Harold?”
Dean and Cas had just settled in to watch a movie in their room (they needed to make sure to pretend to be a couple, after all) when Dean’s phone started ringing.
Castiel looked up, thinking. The corner of his mouth quirked into something in between a smile and a frown, and Dean found his eyes focusing on that part of his face until Castiel began to talk. “No, but I’m sure there’s an etiquette of kidnapping book somewhere that you could read.”
I hope I wrapped everything up okay…? if you have any questions, please let me know! :D
After a heated argument in which Sam insisted they watch
Dean? Really?” Sam said, tossing Dean’s phone back to him.
Sure, they might mate an omega, but that certainly didn’t mean they treated them like a lover.
lmk what you think!! :D
Sam stifled a grin. “Cas, why don’t you sing a song?”
Dean understood his house was not something to be proud of, but it was the best he could do on his own right now. Besides, he couldn’t afford to sell it; he barely had enough money to feed and clothe Sam and get his dad his liquor and the random shit he needed for his “job”.
Sam smiled, wiggling down in his chair to finish reading the book called
“Go sit on the edge of the bed, I guess,” Dean said, realizing he didn’t have a chair or anything of the sort to tie Castiel to, and he sure as hell wasn’t going back downstairs to get one until he had to.
, and maybe he didn’t necessarily want
Then why did he feel so cold and lonely when Cas left?
Cas grabbed his wrist with so little pressure that Dean almost just walked away. “Be careful, Dean,” Cas whispered, his eyes full of worry.
"Slug Bug!" Charlie cried happily as he approached, and when Sam was in range, she punched him in the arm with all her might. Sam laughed, but the punch had actually
Cas blushed when Dean looked at him, and he sheepishly handed over a box wrapped in white wrapping paper with a little green bow. “Please be careful with it, it’s...fragile.” Cas said, before opening the door to the Impala and hurriedly getting in the back seat.
After determining that nobody had seen him burst into song (this time), Castiel looked down at the muffin mix that was covering his shoes and the floor. He sighed before snapping his fingers, and the bowl was back in his hands.
"How do we get out of here, Sam? I want out! Get me out of here!” Dean said, panicking a little. (Okay, a lot, but who wouldn't panic if they were stuck in their worst nightmare?) He began clawing frantically at his shirt, desperate to
Cas was sitting against the head of the bed, eyes closed, with a determined expression on his face. He had a cute little wrinkle in between his eyebrows, and-
Cas looked at each of the remaining games in deep concentration. “I think anything ‘against humanity’ is a bad thing, considering we try to save it all the time.” He observed, pushing
Cas had been having a hard time, recently. All the expectations of being God’s supposed golden child stacked onto his new expectations of being human had him pulled every which way, and he felt as though if he kept it up, it would tear him apart.
"Christmas movie time!" Charlie said suddenly into the void of awkward silence. Her hair was sticking up randomly at crazy angles from being smacked with a pillow, and combined with the bright red color, her head looked like it was on fire. "I made popcorn and bought snacks at the store yesterday, so we just need to decide on a movie!"
Did he just sing “All I Want For Christmas Is You” to
Cas flushed. “Well, I-“
The stranger was still asleep on Castiel's textbook, snoring quietly, and Castiel made the executive decision to leave him be. He sat down across from the sleeping man (Castiel refused to acknowledge the fact that his brain automatically called the stranger
Castiel sat Sam down on the bed and cast a stern glance at him. “If I move my hand, are you going to make a sound?”
Dean shook his hips left and right as he bent over to preheat the oven. "Three seventy five, right, Cas?" He looked over his shoulder just in time to see the angel quickly moving his head to look at the recipe.
Tisiphone laughed at Dean’s resistance and some of the water in the bucket splashed over the side as she got closer to the bed. “Say goodbye, Dean.”
like a fucking teenage girl, and Castiel smiled sheepishly, the cute little worry lines on his brow relaxing the slightest bit.
He blinked open his eyes, the sunshine creeping through the sheer curtains (tonight he was gonna have to remember to close the blackout ones). Dean snuggled down into the weight that was strewn across his middle with a soft smile on his face.
Cas laughed softly and pressed his lips to Dean’s for a split second before pulling back and looking at Dean with dark eyes that were laced with mischief. “I learned how to kiss from the pizza man.”
“Let’s go catch the son of a bitch then.”
Dean was instantly aware of a warmth at his back when he woke up the next morning, drowsy from the best night’s sleep he’d ever had in the giant, fluffy bed.
with him, that was a self-inflicted torture.
“C’mon, Dean, you love
Dean and Cas continued to look soulfully into each other’s eyes for a good minute before Sam cleared his throat.
Dean laughed, despite it making his urge to pee shoot from a
"So, uh-hi. What time is it?" Green eyes landed back on Castiel, and Castiel looked away.
"I love you, Dean.") and Dean would do something to fuck it up. What if Cas finally admitted his feelings for Dean and Dean was so emotionally constipated that he did something stupid, like finger guns, in response? What if the angel had no idea he loved him? What if Cas
"Cas? What the hell? What happened to the bar?” Dean said, moving over to Cas. The other flinched slightly as Dean got closer, before he took a deep breath.
You got another slip of paper for every year, until you were mated, at which point you stopped accumulating more marks against you. Wouldn’t want to piss off the alphas and betas by killing too many of their omega sex slaves, after all.
Dean emerged from the bathroom, and his eyes immediately fell on Cas again, who was gaping at him like a fish.
Dean then looked around the car for anything that could be used to tie the man up. Rope would be nice, but he supposed desperate times called for desperate measures.
The engine started up, a quiet rumbling that vibrated the entire car. Castiel startled out of his sleep, jumping a little bit at the unexpected noise before settling back down. He rolled over, mentally asking for
“Finally!” Sam said, to nobody in particular, and walked into the bunker kitchen to make some coffee (‘cause Dean was sure gonna need it in the morning).
Yep, definitely some kind of mechanical whining. Castiel moved to get up, but couldn’t pick his arms up from above his head. He started tugging harder and harder, panic blossoming under his skin.
Charlie glanced behind her. “Sam, that isn’t talking, that’s eye-banging.” She sighed dreamily. “Or, that’s being so in love that smiling describes what you’re feeling better than words.”
It rang.
Not to mention Dean was one of the most beautiful creatures Castiel had ever seen.
“Five m’re m’nutes, S’mmy,” Dean grumbled, attempting to bury his face under his pillow but failing when -
“Did you seriously just say that?” Dean questioned, looking at Cas in fear, because the dad jokes (heh) were
and Dean adamantly explained why
“Scooby-dooby-doo,” Castiel sang quietly along with the TV, and Dean grinned at him with a mouth full of highly processed orange goo.
Sam just shook his head and reclined, letting out a sigh of content that was louder than a sigh of content had any right to be.
And with the way Cas was looking at him right now, smiling sweetly and
Dean shrugged. “Shock, maybe? Although, they were hitched for about ten years, so I don’t see how she could just up and forget that she was married to the guy.”
Dean sensed it was not a subject to be approached, so he focused on eating his fill. After being gone for so long - nearly ten hours - it would be a wonder if Alastair let him eat for a week.
it was because of the close proximity.
“Okay,” Dean replied quietly, suddenly
After a minute of (literal) crickets, Dean sniffled. “I’m an idiot, aren’t I?” He asked to the air behind Sam’s shoulder.
Dean pursed his lips and glanced at John, who was staring out the window at the still darkness, the peaceful quiet of the night that seemed to consume all of the life in their District for a few hours. “They ain’t gonna take me, Sammy. Promise.”
“Dean, door,” Sam said distantly, too far away, and Dean realized he was about to hit the kitchen door with his body. He stopped abruptly, the liquor in his system making him feel like he was still moving, though he could tell he had stopped because the rain was falling steadily now, straight down, the first rain of the spring.
, Cas?”
Dean shrugged and nodded as he slid into Baby’s driver’s seat. He turned on the radio and tapped his thumbs on the steering wheel.
Dean glanced at Cas and walked up to the bar. He took a seat and looked around the interior of the building.
Cas had no words. He turned to Dean and leaned forward, barely pressing his lips to Dean’s. Dean smiled against his lips and returned it, just a feather light kiss.
The man in the elf hat came back to the window, oblivious to the additional person that magically entered the car. “You’re friend get back to you yet, sir?”
song when Dean came back into the bunker, laden with grocery bags.
“Dean,” Castiel said, his deep voice carefully modulated. His blue eyes flicked from Dean to Lisa and back again. “I would like to speak with you in private. Come to our room?”
He had asked Dean earlier if he wanted to come with him; Dean hadn’t responded, which was an answer in itself, but Dean’s breathing had also been pretty even by that point, so maybe he had been sleeping…
“Dean,” Castiel interrupted, making Dean lose his spot in the speech he had rehearsed for every time Sam asked him a similar question. “No one deserves to be treated the way he treats you. You are a wonderful person, and you could do so much better than him.”
"Oh, uh, nothing I-I just found something Cas might like." Dean said, putting a hand to the back of his neck. Charlie glanced at where he was looking and let out a squeal.
“Hello?” Dean called, and suddenly he realized that if there
An hour after that, Eileen came into the library with a proud smile decorating her sweaty face and a bowl of something delicious smelling in her hands.
“I’ll show you to the bathroom, c’mon,” Dean said after a moment of awkward staring at each other.
Before Castiel could respond with an estimate in the low hundreds, the man spun on his heel and walked out, shoulder smacking into the door frame on his way out. A litany of expletives floated through the air as Castiel heard him struggle down the stairs in his drunken state.
Lisa hiccuped. “Don’t- don’t lie to me, Dean!”
Grace sobbed. Dean was really getting tired of this bullshit.
Dean and Lisa make alliances. Castiel struggles with the corruption of Capitol alphas.
That got Dean’s attention. He scrambled up, grabbing a blanket and wrapping himself in it grouchily. “Let me change, you pervert. Go, get a move on.”
Dean was vaguely aware of some sounds coming from outside his murder-helmet, but he was more focused on the fact that his lungs were aching and his vision was starting to go black.
Cas stood up, and walked up to Dean. Dean showed him the prompt and the angel’s eyes widened. He looked up at Dean and gave him the slightest shake of the head, practically begging him without words to just
Tisiphone laid on the bed, unconscious and bound the same way Dean had been before.
Sam opened one eye to look over at Castiel, as if he had had the same thought process as him and was wondering when Castiel was going to make a break for it. “Lawrence High. And before you ask, I’m a grade ahead of where I should be, ‘s why I’m a freshman but thirteen.”
not for a man.
They finished watching
Charlie and Sam were giggling like teenage girls at a sleepover. (Charlie's giggle was more of a cackle, and it scared Sam a little bit, but he was too absorbed in his own fit of laughter to really care.)
Cas offered a small, pained smile. “Alright. Thank you, Sam.”
Melissa looked at him too, her grey eyes like a stormy sky on a summer day, brimming with unshed tears she probably had no idea the reason for.
"Whatever, we're taking Baby whether you like it or not." Dean rolled his eyes at the angel.
Dean smirked at the joke he had made, and Castiel stared at him with a worried look that wiped the smirk off his face. “Cas?”
Castiel closed his eyes and turned his head to the side, trying to get in a good position to (fake) sleep in.
“Okay, then, well, you boys have fun in there. We’ll see you later!” Sam said as he and Charlie inched away from the other two like they were rigged to explode.
Ok, so maybe Dean was blabbering a little bit. The logic centers in his brain had been fried with the pure electricity that had flowed through him when Cas pressed his lips onto Dean’s. Cas hadn’t said anything, he was just sitting there, and Dean wasn’t sure whether to be smug or embarrassed.
“I guess I’ll go.” Cas said awkwardly, before standing up and walking to the head of the table. He grabbed a prompt, and when he read it, he blanched.
“Ah,” Cas said, and his face fell a little bit as he took another, more depressed, bite of fry (he wasn’t sure what comfort eating even was until that moment).
His brain was still foggy from the alcohol.
Dean blurted out with a fry in his mouth and eyes wide.
unsaid.
we’ll do our best to keep to a stricter schedule :))
Dean watched her go before turning to Cas with a stunned look and an impressive amount of saliva dripping down his face. Cas, for his credit, looked just as stunned as Dean, and reached across the table with a napkin to wipe the spit off of Dean’s face.
“Dean, change your fucking voicemail, nobody likes a smartass. And oh, by the way, I may have very important information on the case. I hope you’re pleased with yourself, your sense of humor is truly making me laugh so hard I’m crying.
His mother amazed Castiel with her perspective of him sometimes.
“But who-who’s that man?” Cas asked, his voice breaking in the middle, and he
Dean put on his full wattage smile and put his hand up for the bartender. “Would you like me to be?” The woman looked at him with pinched eyebrows in a look of confusion that reminded Dean way too much of someone he knew.
“Here are those burgers for y’all!” The waitress said, sliding two plates off her tray and onto the table. She placed her tray underneath her arm and smiled sweetly at the two of them. “Y’know, I always find it adorable when couples order the same thing. You two enjoy, and let me know if you need anything!” She beamed at them for a minute longer before walking off, her blonde curls bouncing slightly.
Cas’ lip quivered again. He looked away, blinking back tears.
Sam threw open the driver’s side door and hustled into the trees with Charlie on his heels, leaving an awkward angel on the lap of a hunter with a boner. It was going to be a long day.
Cas sighed happily. “Yeah, you’re right.”
Dean raised his middle finger instinctively, but it was by his side and Sam couldn’t see it. “Yeah? Well, at least we’re not...we’re not
Castiel shook his head and laid down on the bed, which was surprisingly comfortable, the old blanket worn and soft. “I’ll manage,” he said through gritted teeth.
He was leaning in to do so, properly this time, right smack on those beautiful lips of his favorite angel of the Lord, when Charlie cried out “a couple!”
“Damn right I am, and fuck, Cas. I’m sorry for standing you up on our -on our
The two were like freaking gossipy teenagers, and it was getting annoying as hell.
Dean’s eyes widened just slightly, and his cheeks pinked the tiniest bit. He licked his lips and looked like he was contemplating how to react when Cas let out a strangled hiccup. Dean cleared his throat and stood up awkwardly. “May I?” he asked, gesturing to the bed.
When Charlie wandered back into the war room, Dean was apparently trying to impress a very grumpy looking Sam in a crooked Santa hat and a wide-eyed Cas by singing an awful rendition of
“For what it’s worth, Dean,” Ellen told him, “I’m sorry.”
Dean’s face

Castiel nodded. The sound of glass breaking whipped up through the door. “I know the owner of Lawrence High. My parents are friends with him.”
"I think these'll do, I'm getting major badass vibes. Except they make
"'Night, my angel." Dean slurred, already asleep when his hand dropped to his side. Cas chuckled and watched as the boy on the TV dumped some (hopefully plastic) reindeer on his front lawn.
After some contemplation, Castiel decided there was no good answer to that question.
“Shhh,” Castiel shushed gently, wrapping a soft pajama-clad leg around one of Dean’s. “I won’t let anybody hurt you. You’re safe here.”
"Dean Michael Winchester, if you don't help your angel get his skates on and then get both of your sorry asses on the ice in the next five minutes, I will slaughter you." Charlie said, her tone implying that she would indeed slaughter them and then laugh about it with her grandchildren.
Dean was sitting on his knees, looking out the back window, so Cas mirrored him, but Dean shook his head. He gently grabbed Cas’ chin and moved it until Cas was looking down.
button.
“I do not see the need to travel in a car, I could’ve just flown.” Cas muttered under his breath, and Dean patted his friend’s thigh soothingly. Charlie nudged Sam with her elbow, and Dean seemed to break out of a daze and snapped his hand away from Cas’ thigh so fast he hit it on the window.
Cas must’ve noticed that Dean’s breathing changed, because he looked up at Dean with
“It seems as though Charis Parks has no recollection of her husband,” Cas interjected, and Sam perked up, looking at something just to the right of the screen.
Nope. Dean would not allow himself to be a freaking
Castiel was confused. Sam had just walked in before…
Castiel was really pretty. There wasn’t a better word to describe him, really, at least not one that Dean knew of: his blue eyes were bright and curious where Alastair’s were clouded over, and his hair was such a deep black it was like Dean was looking into the abyss.
"Dean?" Sam asked as he approached carefully. "Is that really you?"
Dean took a deep breath as Castiel held his own. “Would you -uh, like to, um… wouldyouliketogotolunch? With me? Sometime?”
Castiel hated December. His family life had never been all that great, Christmastime usually meaning a small box with poor wrapping paper, a small tree no taller than his waist, and a meager helping of turkey. He despised December for one other reason:
Dean took a long drag of a drink he didn’t particularly remember getting. “Where’d you meet this mysterious dick?”
He should’ve known. Alastair had always said he was ugly, and he knew he was ugly, his body too, and that that was why Alastair didn’t feed him too often, so he could lose weight, and god, he’d really fucked up not getting dressed when Castiel had told him to -
“Is that one of your good shirts?” Dean asked, setting Castiel down gently on the floor, where he leaned against the wall.
“Yeah,” Dean said, the lie tasting like ash in his mouth. “Yeah, I’ll come back.”
What he said must’ve made sense to Cas, though, because he smiled at Dean and said, “Sure, for the case. Obviously. It would make sense.” Cas looked away, biting his lip, and when he looked back at Dean his face was back to it’s usual stoic expression.
“Dean, you have to go to dinner at this place,” Sam said, no introduction. He wasn’t even looking at his phone, he was looking at something off screen.
Maybe these old ladies were witches? Or...demons? (They certainly acted like it.)
“You guys need to chill. We’re going to the light show, and we’re going to pretend like we’re having fun, okay?” Charlie said through her teeth. Sam glanced over at her and she offered him a tight lipped smile.
Well, except for…
Cas flushed and looked at their interlocked fingers before turning his eyes back to the road. “I was unsure of what you would like to do. I know we have been manifesting our romantic feelings for each other through displays of affection, but I was-“
Castiel sighed, rubbing his eyes as the radio cut in and out through static. He really hated this fucking car, and his parents had all the money in the world to buy him a new one, but no, they stuck him with a stupid Lincoln Continental older than he was (though, the car was in arguably better shape).
“Yeahhhh, okay, I mean, we can get one of the cars in the garage and I’ll teach you. We’ll go driving around-“
Sam ran a hand over his face. “Deflecting may be a personality trait, but it doesn’t mean you’re good at it.”
Cas snorted and rolled his eyes. “Like I would cheat on
Dean grunted one last time, pulling the man into the backseat, laying him carefully facedown so as not to hurt his leg or side or whatever had kept him from walking like a regular person.
“Ah, yes, the reason I have ventured into your castle today, princess-“
After a few minutes of fumbling around in the dark (and not the kind of fumbling he wanted to be doing), Dean found the stupid blackout curtains that hung over the fairly large window. He threw them open with more enthusiasm than he’d shown anything in a long while, before he realized that he was standing in front of the window in his black boxers that he hadn’t thrown in the laundry in a couple weeks.
“I need to sleep,” Dean said quietly, almost a whisper, and he closed his eyes and let the hand holding his mac n’ cheese-laden fork go limp. “I haven’t slept in a couple of days.”
Definitely not.
is not the problem, your car and God awful driving are what I’m disagreeing to.”
“I made it when I was younger, it can be your ornament.” Cas smiled at this, studying the angel from every angle.
The same soft lips pressed back against Dean’s and pushed a breath into his lungs, and Dean’s eyes flew open as he coughed up water.
This total, complete stranger had treated him better in a few days than his boyfriend had in a few months.
“It’s game night!” Charlie’s voice came singing through the hallway. “All participants please report to the war room.”
Castiel’s neck turned an interesting shade of red and he stared at Dean for a moment before hesitantly taking his shirt off. His face contorted in pain as the fabric clung to the blood that was already dried, and once he peeled it off, a fresh wave of red cascaded down his side.
Cas turned around. “Come in,” he called, and Dean opened the door to his room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean sighed and clutched his beer to his head.
Then, the deed was done. Dean was now the owner of bumble bee pajama pants, and he was pretty damn proud he managed to buy them with his dignity intact.
Cas snorted, and Dean smiled, looking up at the sky. The moon was just beginning to be bright enough to reflect on the ocean, and it was a sight that Dean could never get enough of (it had nothing to do with the fact that Cas was cuddled up against him like they were, in fact,
“Ummmm-Dean will definitely like this, don’t you think?”
he says. God, Dean, who’s the rude one now?”
“Dean, it doesn’t count as Christmas music if it’s AC/DC!” Charlie pouted from her seat at the table. She had been getting decorations out of her box which was still, miraculously, half full (Charlie had claimed to learn some Mary Poppins magic in Oz) and laying them on the table in the war room while Dean and Sam struggled with the tree.
Wait.

“I’m going to hand you two off to him and his team while I discuss things with Castiel. Behave?” Ellen asked with an eyebrow up.
Castiel helped Dean clamber into bed, before covering him with some very soft sheets and a very thick blanket. The sensations were almost too much for Dean, and he thrashed a little, but then Castiel was holding down his shoulders and setting a finger on his lips.
“Sure am, Sammy. You okay?” Dean asked, and Sam looked away, shifting his arms behind his back. Dean raised an eyebrow and sat up, concerned.
Sam had taken one step on the ice and fell on his ass, eliciting a laugh from both his "friends" (he wasn't really sure anymore) and some nearby spectators that were skating by (literally). Dean had made it all the way to the edge of the ice before realizing how extremely ‘girly’ ice skating was, and he took off towards the benches on the side of the rink, mumbling something about Elsa and
“He’s not my alpha!” Dean hissed, and Lisa’s eyes widened. Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to calm down. “We need to focus on ourselves, Lise.”
“I have not had to eat since I was human. I don’t even know where to begin,” Cas said, a little intimidated.
Dean looked at Sam for a long moment, wondering where exactly he went wrong in raising his little brother. “Their profile doesn’t say mass murderer, Sam, so I think I’m safe.” Dean tapped the screen a few times. “Do you wanna see while I go get ready?”
The Peacekeeper was coming toward him, and suddenly there were two of them flanking him, and the crowd around him drew back as though he were a leper.
let me know what you think! next chapter’s gonna be interesting, to say the least...
Maybe Dean would like this bar, after all.
That on the many,
Ambrosia beamed at them both. “You two are one of the cutest couples I have ever had the pleasure of running into. How did you meet?”
right?!?
Dean felt a finger under his chin, lifting his eyes until they were on Castiel’s azure ones. “I’m not going to hurt you,” he said quietly, and Dean felt his lip quiver. “There is nothing to be sorry about. I’m just surprised that someone that eats as much macaroni and cheese in one sitting as you do could be so -“ Castiel’s mouth continued to move, but nothing came out, like he knew what he was trying to say but couldn’t say it.
Damn. He was already bad at this couple-y shit.
“Sam said two seventeen, right?” Cas asked, squinting at the number on the teal door in front of them.
out of the goddamn car.
That was some voodoo black magic shit right ther-
Dean nodded, reaching his hand out for a shake. “Thank you for meeting with us, ma’am. We’ll let you know if there’s anything else.”
“Let’s get back to the room, we have a meeting with a mourning spouse in the morning,” Dean said, and he opened the passenger door for Cas.
Cas beamed at Dean, and Dean pretended not to notice, becoming extremely invested in following every traffic law known to man (and a few he made up) to avoid looking at Cas.
some dumbass monster be watching the security feed?
John cleared his throat and stood up from the table, nearly knocking over his full bowl of Sludge and his empty glass of liquor. Sam looked down at his bowl immediately, and Dean did the same.
Cas’ eyes widened. “I thought you prefer being the little spoon,” he breathed, but climbed into bed with Dean regardless, settling into his side and placing his head where Dean’s neck met his shoulder and chest. Dean huffed a laugh that Cas could both feel and hear.
“Nuh-uh,” Luke said, eyes sparkling almost red as the headlights reflected off the stop sign. “How does your old man let you do
(Which wasn't a lot, but Dean was in the middle of weaving between cars so he decided not to think too much about it.)
was crossing the line.
Cas licked his lips and turned his head, accentuating his jawline. Dean’s breath hitched.
"Shit, sorry Cas." Dean said, his face on fire. He wasn't sure why, but he was a little reluctant to climb off the angel, so he just stayed straddling Cas' waist with his thighs. Cas' hips bucked slightly, almost involuntarily, but that was just because he was trying to get comfortable with another person's full body weight on top of him.
“Holy shit.” Cas heard Dean breathe, and when he turned, the hunter looked stunning. He was backlit by sparkling lights that changed in the night, the warm lights turning to a red, throwing Dean into an eerie light that made him look like he was full of mysteries.
Charlie glanced at Sam with a sly grin and yawned dramatically, stretching her arms above her head. “Well, boys, as much as I’d love to help you find the angel you seem so keen on misplacing, I really oughta get some rest.” She jerked her head towards the hallway, mouthing something that looked like
Castiel froze, ready to deny any (failed) escape attempts, when Sam’s shaggy head poked into the room, followed by the rest of his lanky body.
"Our first movie night!" Charlie sighed dreamily, and she high fived Sam.
Dean clenched a fist. Both he and Lisa were going into the arena alone.
He maneuvered Baby into a parking spot at the crowded mall, which was decorated for the holiday season. He put her in park and cooed at her, rubbing her steering wheel. "Great job, Baby, way to go."
his boyfriend. Castiel didn't even know his name, much less anything about him besides the fact that he was the most outrageously striking human being Castiel had ever laid eyes upon. He sighed softly, not wanting to wake the man, not knowing how. How
“Grace,” The woman replied as the bartender handed her a margarita. Dean's smile faltered a little as he was reminded of someone he’d rather not think about on a
Dean could hear the exterior doors hissing as they slid open, and he tore his eyes away from the window to see the Peacekeeper from yesterday standing at attention, waiting to escort them off the train.
With this realization, Dean pulled against the rope holding him, trying to escape. His muscles strained as he struggled, but the rope didn’t move at all.
”You can’t tell me that God didn’t make mistakes, like when he created kale or hangovers. But he also made some pretty great things, like Baby, and honeybees,” Dean paused for a moment, inhaling a shaky breath. “-and you.”
that was probably worth more than Dean’s life and the car he had just stolen combined.
Dean knocked her arm with his elbow. “
“But she didn’t,” Dean said quietly, hugging Cas tightly. “I’m still here, you’re still here, Sam’s still here, even though he’s an ass,” Cas laughed at that, though it was strained “-and that’s all that matters. Who gives a shit about whether you messed up or not, hmm? I mess up all the time, and I don’t worry about it.”
“Dean?!”
Cas pulled away to shoot Dean a look before snuggling back into his chest. Dean laughed. “Okay, maybe I do worry about it, but the point is that I make mistakes, too. Everybody does, it’s part of living,” Dean stopped, looking up and thinking of how to prove his point.
(Cas couldn’t tell.)
Dean shot up, and he closed his eyes tightly as the world spun (or Dean spun, he wasn’t sure). He lunged in the general direction of the trash can he kept in his room and puked his guts out, retching around practically nothing, since he hadn’t eaten since -well,
Dean looked on the verge of tears, which was so unusual for him that Sam brought him in for a hug. “Dean, I’m your brother. I don’t care! Cas is Cas, and he loves you. You just gotta let yourself love him.”
“Dean
Dean cleared his throat awkwardly. “I’m uh-I’m making a run into town,” Dean said, then his breathing hitched a little bit as he watched Cas pull a shirt that matched the color of his eyes over his head. “Do you-do you need anything?” Dean winced as he squeaked out the question.
“Don’t you dare call me a sap, Sammy, but I like to collect ornaments from some of the towns we go to.” Dean fiddled with the ribbon on a Route 66 ornament. “It’s stupid, I know, especially since we don’t usually celebrate Christmas. I should probably just put them away.” He reached for the box.
Charlie shrugged as Sam stood to pick a paper. “I Googled some charades things, and just found a list and printed it out. I didn’t really look at it.” She admitted, looking everywhere but the boys as she twirled a piece of hair around her finger. (Which was totally not suspicious at all.)
Sam looked at Dean oddly, before nodding and taking a large bite of salad.
don’t need to worry.”
“Dean! Chill out, man, or I’m gonna ask Cas to help me and you’ll have to help Miss Merry over there with
“I said, I’ll be fine. Now go to your room,” Dean said, voice hard. Sam pursed his lips and Dean softened. “Please,” he added softly, and Sam inhaled sharply, like he was going to say something else, but decided against it.
“Nah, let’s just all work together. That way nobody gets asphyxiated with a pillow tonight.” Sam replied smoothly, throwing a pointed look at Dean and Charlie. Dean sighed and collapsed into his chair petulantly.
Dean was used to the floor by now; whenever Alastair or Luke stayed over, up late talking cars or football or trash about Dean with John, they always took his bed without a second thought.
either you or Cas needs to go to that bar and you need to leave-“
Lisa gulped and nodded, the water streaming down her face beginning to look like tears.
Castiel froze. “Why would I do that?”
If Cas was surprised to hear Dean’s voice, he didn’t show it. He just cracked one azure eye open at Dean. “I may be in need of your assistance to fall asleep.”
The first thing Dean thought was
Cas was waiting for him inside Baby. The car shifted as Dean got inside, and when he looked over at Cas, he was looking at his hands and giving a barely-there smile.
“Aha! There, he doesn’t know, then. I’m sure he’s fine, and he’ll be back soon, alright?”
Dean shook his head wildly, and Cas watched in amusement. They hadn’t even

Charlie listed the reasons why they should watch
in her, but-“
Charis looked baffled. “Why, he’s my boyfriend, of course.”
“No, Sam.”
Wow, he couldn’t even describe the guy. Dean’s education was truly top notch, thank God he dropped out of school when he did.
Well, fine then. If they were supposed to be a couple, Dean would do his damndest to be the most couple-y he could.
“Alright, everybody! Time to get back to crafts!” Laurel’s voice warbled unsteadily through the air.
“I’ll have a bacon burger combo, and he’ll have the same,” Dean said, handing over the menu that had gone unnoticed on the table.
Cas looked around once more before continuing to mix his batter.
“Yeah, it is, but Dean doesn’t usually bring friends over for some reason-“ Sam began, apparently missing the (probable) snark. He was walking ahead of them and glancing over his shoulder, looking like he was about to become their tour guide for the day.
“Did you and Cas finally work it out?” Sam asked, and Dean could almost see him leaning forward in his seat. “Am I going to be an uncle?”
“Right,” Dean said after a moment of charged silence. He clasped his hands behind his back to keep from making the situation more awkward and tension-filled than it already was. “You’re sleeping in my bed, I’ll take the floor.”
“I’ll get you another shirt, just don’t bleed out or anything,” Dean said, jumping up and opening his closet door.
Charlie nodded as Dean helped lift her up from the beanbag. "'Night, Cas." She mumbled as she shuffled sleepily back to her room. Dean chuckled again and sat down next to Cas.
“Well, really, I totally couldn’t tell based off the fucking website,” Dean deadpanned, and Cas snorted. Dean beamed at Cas, and Cas beamed back.
“Okay, okay.” Sam said, spinning around in a circle and finding a rag to stuff into Cas’ mouth. Cas relaxed, and mumbled something from behind the rag before Sam heard some more muffled singing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean nodded. “Can you remember when?” The woman shook her head. “What were you doing at the restaurant?”
Dean interrupted his thoughts, laughing from the other side of the door as he continued their conversation. “‘Course, we could always hop in the shower in there together-“ Dean abruptly cut himself off.
He finally gave in to the temptation to sing, and started from the beginning.
The woman laughed, cold and distant. “Who I am? Tisiphone. What I am?” She smiled, but it was serrated around the edges. “You’re
him. For this. For Castiel. For running away. Alastair would make the death as slow and painful as he possibly could. Alastair’s friends would come; they’d all take turns with him, the same way they had before.
“Art, Dean. That’s what we’re here for, is it not?” Cas replied dryly, then winced when Laurel walked up.
Cas nodded in confused agreement. “But you were marri-“
Sam pulled in front of some tall trees, putting the truck in park. As he turned off the ignition, the group could hear the lyrics of a popular Christmas song wafting through the trees. Dean shivered involuntarily.
Cas looked up at Dean and smiled sadly before gesturing towards the packed bar. “I was supposed to meet a date here,” Cas explained, and he picked idly at his beer label before continuing. “They haven’t showed, as of yet.”
Cas just nodded, tracing the lines on the wall with his eyes, the ebb and flow of the water stains and cracks until a gentle finger was placed under his chin. The -oh, it was a hand now- the hand carefully turned Cas’ head until it was facing Dean’s worried gaze.
Dean blinked, then sneezed again. “Wha-?”
Then he pulled away. “So, are we like...dating now? And...since when are you such a good kisser? What do we tell Sam?”
Dean reached back, plucked the phone out of the man’s hands, and threw it out the window, all while keeping his eyes on the road.
Sam grinned, and the two rushed off towards Charlie's car.
Dean sighed, but even in the low light of the bedroom, Castiel could see some red painting his high cheekbones under his starry sky of freckles. “Please just put your fucking arms above your head.”
Cas' eyes widened at the implication of the question, but Dean didn't wait for an answer and began shifting his body,
Peacekeepers patrolled the streets, hustling everybody toward the town square where the ceremony would take place. Casting a wary glance at one of them, who made a shooing motion, Dean set about moving the Winchester household toward the stage.
(See the end of the chapter for
maybe Cas liked Dean a little, too.
Eileen sighed. “Sirens are also from Greek mythology-“
I’m sorry. I’m so so sorry
“What?” Cas asked, both hurt and grumpy. He had forgotten how much sleep disoriented him, and he
Dean paused, before walking back over to kneel next to Castiel. “I don’t care. I’m simply saving my own ass, ‘cause damaged property ain’t gonna help get my dad the money he wants.”
Dean fell forward, and didn’t think anything at all.
“Ignore him, Cas, let’s get some grub,” Dean said, opening the driver’s side door.
Charlie poked Sam on the shoulder and held up her phone. Apparently, she was very good at typing and driving, and Sam nodded after he read the message she had written.
Castiel smiled as swayed to the song that was stuck in his head. That one song in the movie he had watched with Sam had been playing on a loop in his mind since they had finished the film.
Castiel sat on the bed, leaning against the headboard with his legs crossed at the ankles. He had his eyes closed as he fiddled with a particularly soft-looking pillow, and the expression on his face couldn’t be described as any other than
Dean woke up with his face pressed into the cold metal of the
“It says ‘stop’,” Dean said, proud that he hadn’t even had to read it.
Dean shook his head, and followed her. The woman took a deep breath and looked up at the increasingly inky black sky, then kept walking until the sidewalk thinned out into sand. She sat down, and Dean hesitated a moment.
“Yes.”
When the lights came back on, Cas was turned the other way.
three times just to avoid having to go back out there.
“Y-yeah it is, Dean! Cas doesn’t even sleep! Why would the bed be an issue?” Sam said, finally pointing the camera back at his face, which was red from laughing so hard and he wiped a tear from his cheek.
Dean sat up from the floor and squinted at him. “Yeah, man, all good. You know how it goes, getting matched on an anonymous dating site with your best friend and then accidentally standing them up on the date.”
Sam rolled his eyes. "Speak for yourself." He grumbled, earning a sharp look from Charlie and a piece of popcorn launched at his head from Dean.
Dean stopped. He hadn’t even thought about that. “What do you think? I would say feds so they feel compelled to answer questions but we don’t want to come back as a couple later if we’re not one now.” Dean sat back down with a huff.
Dean tilted his head. “You’ve been driving around for eight hours?”
Sam cradled the phone between his shoulder and his ear, shuffling his notes around. “Dean, it’s Sam, and I think you guys are fighting Aphro-“
, a fancy-pants French place.
Before he even knew what was happening, the car was shifting and the man was throwing open the door, hitting the ground running.
“Well you obviously don’t need it anymore.”
Dean shook his head, turning right off of the main road. “Aw, hell no. Nice try though.
“I didn’t-“ Dean bellowed, before containing the pure rage he felt towards this woman or
“Yeah, fucked that up too, Luke,” Dean said, drumming his fingers on his knee.
an angel, and I never cheated on him!” is what he meant to say, but it came out in a series of muffled babbles. Aphrodite shook her head sadly and put some myrtle on Dean’s crotch, which must be symbolism for something, but Dean didn’t have the brain capacity to think about that right now.
The words got lost on Dean’s lips, caught somewhere in his throat as Cas slipped a little bit, stumbling into Dean’s chest.
“Yeah,” he replied awkwardly, voice scratchy from just having woken up. Castiel smiled, though, and the embarrassment seemed worth it. “How long did I sleep for?”
Before she was
“Lunch will be served shortly,” the man reported in a gruff voice, and Dean felt like his mind was running at a million miles an hour, because he knew that man, but he couldn’t place from where-
Dean had the sudden temptation to do something that tap-danced dangerously close to the line between
Dean considered. “Just… consistent actions that match what you’re saying.”
this is it!!
“Hello, Dean. How was shopping?” Cas asked, setting down his book on the theory of evolution in fairies and looking at Dean with fond eyes.
Dean was done with the disrespect.
And damn, Dean really was just setting out to make Cas look miserable, wasn’t he? “I-I mean, once it’s over, it’ll be over. The case, I mean. Once the case is over, the relationship will be over.”
Really, Dean should’ve seen it coming.
Cas shrugged.
“Let’s go, lady and gentleman,” Ellen said gently yet sternly, and Dean followed her off the train and onto a platform.
Castiel made a sound of appreciation as he rubbed his abused wrists. “Dean kidnapped me earlier, and he was making sure I didn’t escape,” he said, nonchalantly, like this was something that happened everyday.
Dean gave it a cursory glance and yep,
was Alastair going to wake up,
Merry Christmas <33
“Come on, sunshine, let’s go get some rest.”
Cas stared at Dean with a sharp intensity, and said “Goodbye, Sam,” before ripping the phone out of Dean’s hands and hanging up.
Cas was obviously having a panic attack, asking existential questions like that. Maybe talking about the worst case scenario was not the best way to go. Dean rubbed a hand over his face.
Castiel barely managed to gather the brain cells to reply. “Buy me dinner first.”
Dean let out a mirthful laugh, and Cas looked at him with sparkling azure eyes. The flour was starting to settle, most of it on Cas. His black hair was a dark grey under the powder, and he had some on his cheeks. Both of their shirts were completely covered in white, and when Cas chuckled a cloud of flour lifted off of his chest.
Dean hated his dad.
"Deal with it, jerk, just sit on the couch."
A, Cas is not gonna wanna fake date me. Two, the...whatever it is would know if we were fake dating, right? So why should we be the bait? And D, Doctor Sexy’s cowboys boots are the only reason I watch Doctor Sexy!” Dean was yelling now, but he didn’t care.
Dean woke up to the sound of a seagull cawing right outside their window like the goddamn Purge was starting or something.
Ellen led them inside the building, and immediately into a terribly small room. Dean, Lisa, Ellen, Castiel and the Peacekeeper all crowded in, and suddenly the doors closed.
Castiel chuckled in disbelief, breathless. “Oh my god,
He pulled the blanket back over his head and sighed, the hot air of his breath coming back and hitting him in the face.
Dean shifted, suddenly freezing as the water from the shower began to cool on his skin and leave goosebumps in its wake. This seemed to shake Castiel out of his daze, because he blinked and shook his head softly.
The fact that his mouth went dry and he was sweating like he had just run a marathon was irrelevant.
Charlie tightened her grip on Sam’s arm from
“Right, okay,” Dean said carefully, still unsure about what boundaries he was allowed to cross. Then he looked at Castiel and saw perhaps the least threatening alpha he had ever laid eyes on and decided to take a chance. “Why are you here, Castiel?”
. Blech. Dean was definitely not a romantic person.
"I may be crazy, but
Eileen nodded, coaxing Sam through his mental writer’s block. “The restaurant where all the couples went the night before they disappeared.”
Dean tried to ignore the fact that Cas had no regard for his own safety. “True that, true that. So what, we call Sam and see what he’s found, then mosey on down to the bar and check it out?”
“Uh, when he yelled it out in front of everyone. I’ve never seen him before in my life.” Dean spun a golden spoon between his fingers, then fiddled with the crisp white tablecloth. “He says he couldn’t let us go out there without an alpha.”
"You are
He may be stunningly handsome and a decently good guy but he wasn’t someone a random stranger at a bar should go

“Oh, welcome, welcome!” A warbly voice from behind them exclaimed before either man could say anything in response to Charlie’s suspicious behavior.
credit card!” Dean practically yelled, his words echoing dangerously through the parking lot.
“Let’s get you in bed, yeah?” Castiel seemed to have regained his composure, because now he was lifting Dean up, and Dean let him, because he trusted him.
‘Twas the night before Christmas...
Dean sighed at his pizza as he set it down on a plate and patted his stomach. "Let's go, amigo."
, for real, someday, and Dean never told him how he felt?
The man staring back had absolutely no answers for Dean, and he silently cursed that stupid guy in the glass square as he pulled at his hair and paced back and forth.
Castiel didn’t see a window.
Dean glanced at Cas with an eyebrow raised. Cas rolled his eyes. “Yes, Dean, if I turn my grace back on, I should be able to save us the time and the hassle of going to buy an outfit that is suitable for a five-star restaurant. And, in addition, it will allow you to continue to be a lazy ass until we have to go to dinner tonight.”
played out, Dean rolled down his window and stuck his hand out of it, weaving his fingers through the wind. Cas glanced over at him and beamed as Dean sang along to the song.
Cas looked up at Dean again, his gaze making Dean’s heart simultaneously skip a beat and shatter into a million pieces. The angel looked solemnly over Dean’s shoulder, at where Dean presumed Sam was standing, giving his brother and their angel space. Cas looked back at Dean and a single tear fell down his face.
Dean considered this. "Dude, I have no freaking clue. Let's Google it."
for effort,” the steering wheel slid under his hand as he straightened the car onto the long dirt road that was ahead of them.
Dean turned around and hit Sam with his spatula. “You, your health drinks, and your logic disgust me.” Dean turned back around, expertly flipping a pancake from the pan onto a plate for Charlie. He added syrup and whipped cream in the shape of a smiley face before handing it to her with a dramatic curtsy. “For you, madame, the only other sane eater in this household.”
Cas smiled against Dean’s chest, breathing in his scent. After a minute of letting himself be hugged by the same hunter that had refused to show affection
Charlie had managed to convince the three boys that ice skating would be something fun to do. (They "save people, hunt things, and stop apocalypses all the freaking time" and should be able to handle some "cheesy, chick-flicky, clichè Christmas crap.")
Dean squinted at Cas again. “Why would we need that as a rule?”
in case you haven’t noticed, I’m awful about making references to my favorite movies/shows. sorry not sorry :) also the bartender’s name is not based on the pudding, just FYI ;)
Dean was sure it was meant to be light hearted banter. But beneath it, he could tell Sam was scared.
Dean sounded so nervous and adorable that Castiel didn’t hear his bedroom door open.
Castiel chuckled at the run-on sentence that was clearly the unfiltered thought process of a thirteen (almost fourteen!) year-old.
Castiel blew out a quiet curse and rolled down the window.

Sam sighed, all
“I think any tree that you like would be a good tree, Dean. Like the tree from Charlie Brown. That one was a sad, dying tree, but it was loved by the children.” Dean chanced a look at Cas. His intense glare had softened dramatically, leaving almost a wistful smile on the angel’s face.
“You know what Sam-“ Dean said, about ready to throw open the passenger door and give his brother a piece of his mind.
“Why’re you tied up?” Sam asked, leaning forward and untying the rope.
Sam blanched. “God, I hope it’s not your car.”
“Dean,” Cas said hesitantly, and Dean hummed in response. “I love you, too.”
“Oh, fuck you, Sam,” Dean sighed, and Sam hung up their call with a cackle that rivaled one of Charlie’s.
Heh, they’d have no problem keeping demons away, would they? And it’d sure be a struggle to be a ghost in this climate-
No one moved.

Sam tried again, slinging one hand over his shoulder and grabbing his stomach again, this time huffing the words
Alastair pushed off the hood of the truck and walked around to the driver’s side. Dean stood for a moment longer, watching the endless sky, until Alastair started the truck and he walked to the passenger side.
(Dean was feeling very poetic and very bitter.)
When Cas wandered into the Dean-cave, Sam was waiting for him on the couch with the remote on his thigh.
“You didn’t, did you?” She sighed, shrugging. “Whoops, my bad.”
Dean walked up behind Cas and looked around at the hotel entrance. It was quite nice, a bunch of different shades of tan and blue, with some splashes of green here and there. It was a walking distance away from the beach, and Dean could already smell the salt.
Dean chuckled. “So this whole thing was a ruse to get me alone? You coulda just asked me on a date, you know.”
“Two shots, please,” Dean said to the bartender, and told the woman, “drinks on me.”
Dean’s limbs thrashed on the bed, and he shook his head around trying to get rid of the bucket, but Tisiphone kept a steady hand on both the bucket and on the back of Dean’s neck.
Dean half heartedly pointed in the direction of the bathroom, and he was lucky Becky ran away before she puked on his shoes (they were his good boots).
“Jeez, I was starting to get worried, it took you-“ Dean sat up and his eyes widened comically as he got his first glimpse at Cas. “-forever.” His voice kinda died into a whisper at the end, but who could blame him when Cas looked like
“Thanks, Lise,” Dean said quietly.
Charlie smiled, almost bittersweet as she exited the light show and turned the radio back down to an acceptable volume (for her, anyways). “Did you guys like the show?”
“Sam, turn around.”
Dean was tempted to wipe his sweaty palms on his jacket but thought better of letting go of the (apparently) speechless angel.
“Did you get lost on the way to a beauty pageant?” Dean asked, which, okay, he’ll admit, it wasn’t the smoothest line, but at that point he was too intoxicated to care.
After a minute of admiring one of God’s wonderful gifts to humanity (and accidentally giving himself a [totally platonic] boner in the process), Dean gathered himself and strutted over to Cas with as much confidence as he could muster while silently calculating how long it would take to stab all these women with the demon knife he had strategically placed in his boot.
had happened with Cas. Sam walked towards him like Dean was a wounded animal, and honestly, Dean felt it was warranted.
Dean grunted, and he could feel himself shutting down. He’d already been to vulnerable with Castiel anyway, sharing a bunch of shit with him and crying in his arms -
a part of his life; not the part of his life he could remember, anyways.
*anyways* thank you all for the support!! <3
“You had better stop right now or I’m calling the cops,” the idiot threatened, taking a phone out of his suit pocket.
“When we get to the Capitol, we need to find a place where we can talk in private,” Dean said, eyes flicking around their new refuge.
Andes Mint (just devils food cake mix cookies with some Andes mint melted on top, it’s a chocoholic’s heaven)
Dean huffed aggressively (it was
It took Dean a minute to realize that this
Cas nodded and tilted his head to the side. “I was going for a sweet-savory combo, because that’s what the woman on the computer said to try.”
“I don’t understand, alpha. How would you like me?” Dean hated offering himself up like this, but… if he was good, it could be the difference between life or death in the arena.
way and patted down his pockets before pulling out a cell phone.
“Dean!”
But it was the principle of the thing…
If Dean remembered the window...
Dean went back to twiddling his thumbs. Cas went back to playing with his sugar packet (it was an all-natural sugar packet, with a green label to ensure it.)
“And you, that sculpture is...well-it’s quite...marvelous?” Laurel said, glancing at Dean’s sculpture.
Dean shook his head violently at Sam, who just tilted his head at them. “What Sam’s trying to say is that you need to watch your mouth,” Dean corrected, tightening his grip on Castiel’s wrists to keep Castiel upright as he lurched forward, his foot catching on some random part of a car skeleton that was half buried in the dirt.
Though, it could be argued that Dean already did when he kidnapped Castiel.
Sam nodded, typing away again. “Yeah, myrtle in the mouth and rose petals all around them.”
“They seem very nice,” Dean says, voice nasally from his allergy. “I’m not a cat person.”
Castiel shrugged and grabbed his newly-made knife.
Next thing they knew, the three men were sitting in the Impala, Sam and Dean in the front and Castiel in the back.
, it looks like one of the vic’s wives is still checked into the hotel, so maybe you and Cas can go talk to her over breakfast or something.” Sam added, and Dean exhaled a shaky breath. “Dude, what’s wrong with you? Are you okay? You sound like a teenager that just found out their crush doesn’t like them back and it’s starting to scare me.”
Sam mulled this over in his head before he figured yeah, that could probably work. He said as much before adding “if only we knew who your guys’ soulmates
Cas looked at him and beamed, his eyes crinkling and his gums showing. Dean couldn’t
Cas jumped up off the bed, noticing his yawn. “You must be tired. Here, you take the bed and I’ll sleep on the floor. Is that okay? Or if you want me out of the room entirely I can do that too.” He hovered, waiting anxiously for Dean’s verdict.
Dean was gonna say something along the lines of “that is no way to talk to your elders,

, not going there. He still had to pee.
Updates soon!!
The smile Dean was going for didn’t appear. “Don’t let them take you,” Sam said, and he looked up at Dean with teary eyes.
Dean truly felt like crying as he began to strip for his new alpha, first peeling off his soaked jacket and shoes, and he was just fumbling for his own too-large belt buckle when Castiel put a hand on his arm.
“Dean! It looks like a giraffe! How the hell was I supposed to know it was a dog?” Charlie yelled, clearly more frustrated than the game intended to make its players.
"I-I got no idea, man. Cas just-" Dean couldn't continue around the lump in his throat. “I don’t know.”

Who smelled like an omega. Sam had presented. When they went to check in later that morning, he’d be discovered and his name would be added.
Sam made a weird gasping sound. “Dude, where the hell have you been? I’ve been calling you since last night!”
“What the

Dean grabbed Cas’ hand and hauled him out of bed, and Cas let himself be led through the bunker until they arrived at the garage.
Dean came out of his room dressed in a black shirt with an unbuttoned red flannel on top and black jeans.
Yeah, that one had to have hurt.
Charlie gestured at the TV with the remote, then wiggled to get comfortable in the charcoal beanbag chair she had convinced Dean into buying for her. (She had wanted a rainbow one, but Dean had determined that if there was going to be a freaking

about wanting to deprive Cas of his newly minted basic human needs. “Jimmy enjoyed burgers, Dean.”
The cool air of the newly minted night made Dean shiver and pull his jacket tighter around him. He spotted a figure leaning against a truck and looking up at the sky, and he carefully approached him.
Dean blinked. “Huh?” Cas looked at him and Dean realized he was standing in the middle of the automatic doors. The automatic doors that were
“What, Dean?!” Cas blurted out, and he pursed his lips like he even surprised himself by letting those words slip out.
Cas’ eyes widened comically, but that was nothing compared to how much his pupils dilated.
Updates soon! <3
Castiel sighed, almost so quietly Dean couldn’t hear it, and gently closed the door to the bathroom.
Dean shook his head. “Just ‘cause I kidnapped ya doesn’t mean I have to be rude. Guests take the bed, host takes the floor. Common knowledge.”
now, so Dean did what any good boyfriend would do.
Castiel finished his little impromptu stretching session (stretching before bed is supposed to help you sleep, right? Castiel didn’t know) and grumpily opened the back door of the car, slamming it open harder than he probably needed to.
“My friend was just going to get back to us on the measurements, could you give us a second?” The man nodded at Sam’s kindness, walking towards a car that had pulled in behind them.
about that, Dean.” Sam said in disgust. “Why don’t you sing something and see if anybody sings back.”
Sam shook his head violently, clearing his head. “I love you too, and yes I do. Okay, okay.” He dialed Dean’s number.
Dean flinched, waiting for overwhelming pain or a bright light or an explosion or
Castiel smiled, because Sam’s enthusiasm to be a knowledge sponge and soak up all the information he could reminded Castiel of himself.
Cas blushed. “Driving is the same in execution as it is in theory.”

Dean shrugged. The asshole had raped him, assaulted him, tried to do the same to
please leave a comment or kudos! <3
Cas gave Dean a once over and licked his lips before clasping his hands behind his back and looking around the room, rocking forward on his toes and then back on his heels. “You look great, Dean,” he said hoarsely.
Alastair leaned over and Dean shivered as his breath ghosted over his ear. “Wanna trade?”
Dean swayed with Cas, and the rest of the world seemed to fall away. When he finally screwed up the guts to look at his partner, the other man looked beautiful.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel reached towards his feet for the door handle before pulling it closed. He settled down, yanked the blanket over his head, and closed his eyes, finally allowing himself to fall asleep in the relative peace and quiet.
The words echoed back to Dean in the small space of the shower and he sighed, leaning his head against the cool tile.
"I'm fine, are you alright?" Cas responded, using a combination of Dean's shoulder and his walker to stand up. He grabbed Dean's hand again and lifted the hunter up with his angel strength.
“Good,” Dean said, voice lighter, and he climbed off of Castiel (again) and let go of his neck. “Now go the fuck to sleep so I can think.”
The Peacekeeper pushed a button, and then Dean’s stomach was left somewhere below as the room shot up at a frightening speed.
Dean shook his head. “One’a my friends.
.” Jesus Christ, Dean really had no sense of self preservation.
enjoy!!
, you could be my dad’s ticket to riches.”
But at the same time, it was wonderful. Dean couldn’t remember the last time someone had so lovingly held him, had made him food; the last time he had let someone take care of him was probably before his mom died.
Cas woke up with his face in the mattress and-
Cas tilted his head, squinting intently at Dean, his gaze flitting left and right between Dean’s green eyes. Dean looked back, mocking the angel’s intense stare. Charlie snuck a sly grin at Sam, and Sam snorted and held a hand up to his face as some protein shake threatened to make its way out his nose.
<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>
Castiel sat down on the bed, wincing a little bit, and Dean realized that his side was still oozing blood from his earlier escape attempt.
A tense silence fell over the car, and yeah, maybe it was all Dean’s fault that everybody was each other’s throats, but he had too much pride to admit it.
<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>
"I love you, Dean."
Dean threw his arms up in exasperation. “So I don’t even get to eat your burger?”
“The barn, but he’s
Dean hummed, whether it was in content or in protest, neither was really sure, but soon enough, his eyes were closed and his head was rocking side to side with every bump that Baby went over.
, and if he does-“ Dean looked at Cas with a meaningful gaze, but Cas was busy watching Melissa instead of being impressed by the knowledge Dean was dropping, “-then
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nice house,” Castiel commented, (probably) snarky as hell, and Dean shoved him forward a little harder than strictly necessary.
Ambrosia actually wiped a tear from her eye. “Wow, that is so beautiful. You two must be so in love,” she sighed dreamily before smiling. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”
There wasn’t any, as far as he could tell.
“I really think I should stick with De-“ Castiel began to say, but then Ellen was grabbing his elbow and leading him into the hallway. Castiel sent Dean an apologetic look before he disappeared.
But then Dean had looked at him last night like he meant it, like Cas was the only thing worth seeing, and that had sent his guard tumbling down.
When Dean looked up, Cas was staring at him with a high degree of intensity that almost made Dean feel like an artifact on display. “Are you alright, Dean?” Cas asked softly.
Dean could understand that. He smiled at her once before going back to the window to stand by Castiel as they entered the Capitol proper.
“I don’t suppose you guys have anything strong?” Dean asked, hoping against hope. The waitress looked at him weird, a mix between
He wandered over to Sam’s room, opened the door and peeked in, happy to see that Sam was asleep in his bed.
“Get out, Sammy,” Dean said, trying to keep his voice from wavering.
Before Dean could respond, Cas cut in. “Do you have any information for us?”
Cas blushed when Dean caught him staring, and looked away.
The man behind the desk raised his head. “Hello, sirs, how can I help you?”
, Dean. Somethin’ ‘bout the people on the radio saying somethin’ ‘bout the ransom.”
Castiel had never walked through the car graveyard that was their entire yard, but Dean was happy to let him stumble along. If Dean believed in
Cas shrugged as he pulled flour down from the shelves lining the kitchen walls. "Probably chocolate chip, since that's the most basic one." Cas paused, his eyebrows pulling together, signalling he was deep in thought. "Do you find it odd that we have all the supplies we need for baking? We rarely have any food here besides bacon and alcohol."
As soon as he and Castiel were through the door and in their room, Dean dropped to his waterlogged knees in front of the alpha. He was expecting a punishment, but hoped that by being on his knees he could protect his chest and internal organs from blows.
Dean forced a smile and nodded. “Yup, fine, fine, totally fine. Are
“Dean is quite upset that you booked us the honeymoon suite, Sam,” Cas said, and Dean handed Cas the phone so he could properly drive Baby out of the hotel parking lot.
This was not going how Dean had thought it would.
Dean woke up with drool running out of the side of his mouth and pooling on Cas’ collarbone (and not in a sexy way).
One male and one female omega between the ages of sixteen and sixty were chosen from each District to compete in the Hunger Games each year.
“I know you’re lying,” Dean whispered, rubbing his thumb soothingly over Cas’ chin.
,” Sam threw a pointed look at Dean before continuing. “And D, you have a cowboy fetish!”
“Almost sounds like you care,” Castiel said suspiciously.
Dean’s heart broke a little at how small Cas’ voice sounded, how confused. His eyes were flitting all over Dean’s face, and Dean could see the gears turning behind those baby blues.
Dean looked down. Of course John didn’t have a place for him.
Cas sighed, and looked to the TV, which was playing idly. “He’s out on a beer run right now, but I worry he’s breaking cover.”
Cas sighed and pulled away to look at Dean. His green eyes, his freckles, his jaw, his
Cas loved mysteries.
Cas nodded. “I’m glad you like it, Dean. I was hoping you would.”
"Yes, ma'am."
“Cas-“ Dean cleared his throat. “
, he pulled away. “I knew that would work,” Cas said brightly, and Dean’s jaw unhinged a little bit. “Also, your logic is off, because you let Sam drive.”
Castiel’s family may have been totally fucked up, but at least his parents never hit him.
sorry?
The sundress was what had told Dean that there was something odd about the woman, because if Mr. Mustache at the front was anything to go off of, this place had a pretty strict dress code.
“Yeah, well, who wouldn’t be when
Charlie and Sam take Dean and Cas to town for Christmas shopping!
“Listen here, man, I’m seriously not going to hurt you. You look like you’re in pain, so please let me take you to my boss and we can get you fixed up and then we can sort this whole mess out, alright?” Dean said, standing above the stranger.
Dean sighed. This still-kinda-asleep version of Cas was really freaking cute (and adorably clingy) but was testing his patience
“Here are those colored pencils for you, dear.” Laurel said, handing over a box of colored pencils. She sighed, then leaned over to stage whisper to Cas. “I’m sure he’ll love it.”
to say, but now that it was out there he wasn’t gonna be the one to take it back. Cas looked a little taken aback, but then he nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. “Um, if that’s okay with you. Just since, you know, the vics were with their partners when they went to dinner here. It would make more sense,” and now Dean was blabbering. He sealed his lips to stop himself from talking even more.
Sam’s eyebrows were up so high that Castiel couldn’t see them anymore. “Dude…” he started, running a hand through his hair. “
“I’m sorry. I don’t want to die,” Dean blurted out, then a sob wrenched itself from his chest before he turned away, lips quivering in a sorry attempt to keep from making any noise.
“Do we have any idea who these people are that they left with?” Dean asked after a minute, and yeah, maybe he was avoiding the question, but he had assured Cas he would never fake cheat on him, and if he told Sam that tidbit of information, he would get all nosey. It just plain wasn’t something that Dean felt Sam needed to know.
Dean and Cas have been assigned to make...cookies?
Sam squinted at Dean. “Since when do you watch Hallmark movies?”
“Maybe we can do both?” Cas suggested. “We can be federal agents now but say that we have a personal relationship.”
Sam turned around and looked at them, and they finally broke eye contact. Dean looked sheepishly at his hands that had settled in his lap and Cas looked out his window, attempting (and failing) to hide a smile.
Dean looked at Cas, his confusion written on his face. Cas sighed, and looked pointedly out the windshield. “I may or may not know exactly where we are.”
“-iiiiiiiiiiiiis...youuuuuuuuuuu.” He leveled a finger at Cas, and as the beat changed, he climbed up onto the table and began to dance ridiculously.
“How can I help you two fine gentlemen?” She asked, throwing the towel over her right shoulder. The woman had brown balayage hair, her loose curls reaching just past her elbows. Her eyes were a light sapphire that almost bordered on unnaturally teal.
“I’ll go fix you some food, and then we can work on a way to get you home safely. Okay?” Castiel said, looking to Dean for confirmation that this is what he should do. “Are you going to be alright if I leave or would you like to accompany me?”
Dean groaned. “So basically it’s turning our lives into a Disney movie. Great,” he said, putting his forehead on the table. “How do we break the spell?”
“If you hold out your pinky again, I will break it.”
Sugar cookies (frosting them is so much fun, especially if you use cookie cutters)
Dean looked curious, and he was reaching for the paper when Laurel handed it back to Cas, who immediately hid it behind his back.
“Hello, tributes,” she greeted them, taking a seat next to Castiel across from Lisa and rescuing the last roll before Lisa could shred it. “So, how are you feeling?” She transferred butter from the golden butter dish to the roll, and started methodically spreading it. At that moment, Dean hated her. Hated that she could calmly eat bread and rich butter that would be much too expensive for him to even consider buying back home, hated her matronly, beta demeanor, hated the way she pretended to care about them when she knew she was taking them to their deaths.
John wouldn’t miss him, so there really wasn’t much to worry about.
Dean stared, open mouthed, out the window as the Capitol came into view. The place was a hive of activity, trains zipping everywhere. They crossed over the top of a dam that Dean knew provided hydroelectric power to the Capitol.
Because avoiding your problems automatically makes them go away, right? (Dean was no therapist, but that didn’t sound like it would be actual-therapist-approved.)
Dean contemplated a second before sprinting back to his room.
Cas almost started crying all over again.
Cas laughed, and glanced down at Dean for long enough for Dean to see the adoration in his eyes before he looked back up to the road. “Not as beautiful as you are,” he said, and Dean blushed.
Dean pulled into the bar seventeen minutes and thirty nine seconds later. (Siri had said it would take them twenty two minutes, but Dean wasn’t known for following speed limits. He enjoyed proving Sam’s stupid little phone wrong.
Dean led Castiel (what the fuck kind of name is that?) towards the house.
“I have seen you around the district, Dean, and I admire your strength and tenacity.”
in his car. No rope, no tape, no conveniently forgotten handcuffs.
The commotion outside the bucket suddenly faded, and Dean let go of his breath, dazedly mesmerized as the bubbles that held the last remainders of any hope of survival floated towards the top of water.
“With your

He closed his eyes and let the black consume him.
Dean settled into the couch with some blue plaid pajama pants with fat little bees on them and a large T-shirt that said

“Are you sure you want to sleep on the floor? I can share the-
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” Tisiphone sighed at Dean, and Dean was about ready to ask her (in a witty retort) why when something hit him over the head.
Eileen smiled softly and took the chair across from Sam, waiting for the inevitable-
thank you all for supporting me thus far! it really means a lot <3
“Cas?”
“Dean! I made lemon muffins!” Cas exclaimed as he thrust the basket into the arms of the hunter. “I hope you like them, it took me quite a while to find a good recipe.”
Dean and Cas were struggling to stay upright when Charlie's song came on.
“Get the fuck off the bed, dude,” Dean said to keep from wincing in second hand pain.
Dean blushed and looked down. “That doesn’t mean I want to.”
The man cocked his head, and Dean realized for the first time how
When he sat back down, Cas was focusing intently on a piece of paper in front of him, his forehead furrowing as he hunched over the table.
"No, you idiot, it's the song." Dean laughed. Cas visibly relaxed. "
“Dude, this is actually, like, really good. What the hell?” Dean said, taking another bite of his muffin.
"It shouldn't be of import which car we take, just as long as we get there." Cas said, rocking back on his heels and forward on his toes with his hands in his pockets as he studied a small patch of grass (with what looked like great interest).
Eileen looked back at Sam like he was a lost puppy. The adoration in his eyes was great and all, but Dean and Cas could be in serious danger. “Sam, you were calling Dean.”
Cas’ eyes widened even more. He tried to say something, but all that came out were a couple muffled sounds. Dean rolled his eyes and took the rag out of his mouth.
quite unique.” She grinned at Sam, who returned the gesture.
Sam hadn’t presented yet, and he just turned sixteen, which meant he would be eligible for the Reaping as soon as his scent changed.
Sam nearly choked on his saliva as he pranced around the room like his pants were on fire.
“I hate you.”
"Merry-uh-Christmas?" Cas said, looking at Sam with a confused expression, only to see that Sam was glaring at Charlie, who was beaming at Castiel. They stood in a triangle of stares for what seemed like forever before they heard a door shutting in the halls of the bunker. Dean walked into the room, and Charlie ran over and threw herself at him, nearly knocking him over.
“Cas?”
into the low hum of the night air.
Cas nodded and got in. “I paid the bill for dinner with our credit card,” he said, his voice muffled as Dean crossed in front of Baby to get into the driver’s side.
Cas nodded, albeit hesitantly.
“I love you too, Dean.” And then Sammy was gone and Dean was alone in the room, about to be herded onto a train and taken like a beast to slaughter.
ass look good, so that's always a plus." Charlie sashayed back into the dressing room and began to change back into her original clothes. She glanced at her phone and saw a text notification from Sam.
“The bunker is approximately eighteen feet tall in the war room.” Castiel suddenly appeared back on Dean’s lap. Dean jumped, then sighed, running a hand over his face.
“Hey, Grace, hold on a minute.” Dean slurred, and Grace saluted him sluggishly and swayed out of the bar.
Cas looked thoughtful, and he inhaled before he said, “Wasn’t her husband killed about three days ago?”
i’m not sure anymore, guys.
“G’night, Cas,” is what Dean meant to say, but his lips could barely move anymore as he drifted off into sleep.
, he just needed to sleep and this would all go away. It had to be a nightmare, right?
Charis blinked at Cas before laughing in confusion. “Oh my, well, Harold and I have certainly been moving fast, but we aren’t
“Oh look! It’s on sale! I’ll buy it, a-and it can be from you!” Sam said, fiddling with the object in his hands as he (totally not suspiciously) glanced everywhere but Cas.
“I volunteer as tribute!” he yelled, his voice echoing in the quiet, just as Sam reached the top of the stairs. “I volunteer! Let Sammy go.”
Cas sighed and looked at Dean with what was, quite frankly, a really cute thinking expression. “Nobody cares, Dean,” he said, and well. Dean wasn’t a dainty little snowflake, but Cas could’ve sugar coated it a
He blinked once, twice (he really needed to get his vision checked) before everything cleared and he locked eyes in the rearview mirror with a pair of the greenest irises he had ever seen.
The eyes widened and looked away as soon as they realized they had been caught.

Luke leered towards Dean, suddenly interested. “The dude, he our age?” Dean nodded. Luke whistled and leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms. “Man, is he hot? Might have to get my hands on that one,” Luke’s eyes flashed dangerously as Dean remembered Castiel holding his little finger out for a pinky promise.
Castiel looked away, as if trying to come up with the words. “I think you do,” he said slowly, looking back to Dean with a thousand words in his eyes. “I think you’re just scared of what might happen if you let yourself want better.”
"Dean!"
Cas gave Dean a small smile. “I love you, too.”
“Smooth, Cas,” Dean said when the doors closed, and he yanked his arm away.
Dean giggled, he
The dark haired woman seemed to be too drunk to care as well, ‘cause she turned her chocolate eyes on Dean. “Did you get lost on the way to a good pick up line?”
