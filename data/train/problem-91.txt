“Then what are you investigating? There is no new evidence, no leads, nothing. So, how are you assisting?”
In that moment, John stood there sobbing at the words. Sherlock walked over to him to be close and wipe the tears from his husbands face. He kissed John to distract him as he walked him backwards towards the exit. Sherlock reached behind John grabbed the door knob, turned it, and pushed it open to reveal the mundane world outside. They parted and John spun around fast to avoid seeing the look on Sherlock's face. He took a breath as he stepped outside but quickly turned back around to see Sherlock give him a wink and sad smile before the doors were closed by a nurse.  John turned once more back to the world in front of him, walked down the stairs and hailed a cab. He made it all the way back to Baker street before breaking down once more.
“Come on, dear.” Mrs. Hudson lead Emma downstairs. Once John knew Emma and Mrs. Hudson were out of earshot he inquired, “How is this possible?” Sherlock sat there not saying a word and John continued, “There’s no way he is back. He’s dead.” while waving the card with emphasis. Sherlock still sat there with his hands under his chin. John took a seat in his own chair and sighed while staring at the card in his hand, “This can’t be happening.” John was interrupted from his contemplation by a chuckle from Sherlock, “Brilliant!” he exclaimed.
. John watched Sherlock’s face go through a multitude of emotions starting with fascination and ending with realization. Sherlock looked over at Emma. He gave her a reassuring smile to let her know everything was okay. “Sherlock?” inquired John. Sherlock looked his way as John approached him and took the card. He watched John’s face pale as he examined the card, “No, its not possible.”
John and Sherlock looked at each other and agreed to call Lestrade if they needed anything. The three of them bid a good day.
Sherlock looked down at their joined hands, “John, I understand if you can no longer come to visit. You need to live your life. I need you to live your life.”
John chuckled sadly at Sherlock’s last sentence knowing he meant that with all his heart, “I love you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock threw his head back and exhaled in annoyance before looking to John again, “I’m just being me.”
“I am looking for patterns from our previous experience with Moriarty. I feel like I missed something. There I told, now can we please go to bed?” He replied overly annoyed. He wished John would let this go.
“Consulting only, remember.” John turned his attention to Lestrade, “Sorry, Greg. Sherlock is having a little trouble handing this over.”
The rest of their evening was uneventful until they went to bed. Something was still nagging at John about their conversation earlier. He could sense something was up.
“Because Moriarty is dead.” John regretted stating that name in front of Emma knowing that now she would have more questions.
It took him a few days before he started feeling a little better and with every passing day he grew stronger and felt a little better. One true thing about this was that Sherlock was right, he wanted to make a memory for John to relish in on his darkest days and for years to come that is exactly what he did. He recalled the memory of Sherlock wishing him a happy anniversary and the talk they had in the garden as well as their last dinner together. To others it would seem to be a sad affair that no one should relish in but to John is was pure gold. How could he have ever been so lucky to have the life he had.
Annoyed at this ultimatum, Sherlock agreed because he wanted to solve this as soon as possible. He grabbed the envelope and put it back in his jacket before proceeding to leave the flat. Halfway to the door, he turned around walked back to Mrs. Hudson gave her peck on the cheek as a thank you before returned back up to his flat. As he left, he called over his shoulder, “Sorry about earlier. Thank you for the stew.”
John dropped his hands from his husband's face as he went slack in surprise at the moment playing out before him. He burst in to tears when Sherlock stood from his chair bringing with him off the ground and they embraced in a loving hug. As they pulled away, Sherlock cupped his husband's face and gave him a tender kiss to the lips. John couldn't help but smile into the kiss. When they parted, Sherlock asked his husband to join him in the garden for some fresh air.
“I did. But I know you and you won't let this go. Not until you’ve solved it.” John emphasized by pointing at Sherlock which in return received an appalled look from him. He was going to add more but Sherlock was done with the conversation. Sherlock lifted Emma off his lap, steepled his hands under his chin, closed his eyes and “pretended” to go to his mind palace. Emma giggled at her daddy being so dramatic.
Sherlock walked over and sat down next to Emma on the couch, “Please inform us of your observations.”
While still looking at John, Sherlock steepled his fingers together, “Mrs. Hudson, please take Emma downstairs.”
Sherlock returned to the flat while John headed to hospital for clinic duty. As Sherlock entered 221B, Mrs. Hudson approached him with another envelope. He opened it in front of her, the card said, ‘Ready, Set, Go.’ He assumed that meant the game was starting. He headed up to his flat to work out the next anticipated move based on the last two envelopes he received. On the wall above the sofa, he taped the blank card and the current card next to each other. From there, he took a few steps back looking back and forth between the two of them. The blank card is where his eyes came to rest. There was something quite perplexing about it. He stared at the blank card with such spitefulness, one would think the card offended him with its blankness.
Greg was a tall, handsome man with sandy brown hair and a brilliantly awkward smile, “Hello, uh, you must be Sherlock, it’s great to meet you-,”
Sherlock gave John an unimpressed look, “Obviously.” He said with disgust, “One could tell just by the
“Rugby, of course - and I know you played a sport because you’re more physically fit that most teenage boys our age, obviously you haven’t been going to a gym - where would you find the time or money for that? So that leaves a sport, you’ve got broad shoulders, not the physic of a tennis player or a swimmer, you’re used to playing in teams, I can tell that from your friendliness, you’re used to meeting new people, which is odd as your sister and mother seem to be very antisocial in their behaviours, which leaves team sports, and therefore the most popular British team sports for the working class - rugby or football?” Sherlock finished his speech, waiting for the following anger patiently. When no anger came, Sherlock nervously took another glance at John and continued with his deducing, “I can also tell you’ve moved here because your father recently passed away, I overheard before I came in that our mothers used to go to school together, so I’m guessing your mum moved you up here to get away from any memories of your father, yet she didn’t want to feel alone in the move. However, you seem to be the only one unfazed by his death. Your mother still wears his ring, Harry’s sucking her thumb again, both obvious coping mechanisms, but you, you’re fine. In most part - I’m guessing you had a breakdown when it happened? Sudden then, either an incurable illness - obviously your family don’t do visits to the doctors for various reasons, be it money for prescriptions or… privacy,” John flinched at that, Sherlock’s earlier suspicions were solid now, “so he got ill and it wasn’t until he was on deaths door anyone knew, or he was killed in a work accident. From your mother’s accent, I can tell you’re working class, housewife, probably, if not something small to keep money coming in - waitress, shop assistant, etcetera - But your father, now he was a working man's man. Building, construction, something like that. So there leaves the choice from illness or work accident, however due to the fact you’ve moved so far away, I’m guessing your mother had some time to plan, save money - a couple of months maybe? Plus what used to be your university fund, so she made arrangements, that house on Oak Crescent was sold a week ago, and now you turn up - you haven’t just come here for hospitality. Which explains, your mother brought you here because she needs a friend, not just an introduction to the neighbours, the death of a husband is a hard thing to go through alone. So is the death of a father… but not for you. Maybe it’s because you love the rest of your family too much, or it’s because you
“Oh, calm down Harry! Just give us a minute, alright!?” John turned to pull his trousers on over his pants and realised with a forlorn look at his shirt, that it had been completely ripped in two… and covered in stains. He sent Sherlock a vicious look.
From that moment on, they were nearly inseparable through the entire summer hols. Sherlock was trying to teach John his art of deduction, most boringly obvious things John could see, but almost everything of importance needed to be pointed out or showcased. They spent hours solving petty crimes, for instance, who had stolen Mrs Hinkley’s prized cottage-pie recipe (really no one had, Sherlock had solved that one within seconds of being in the house and noticing the ashen smell which hadn’t come from the log fire but instead a poorly hidden pile of paper ashes on the floor of the kitchen, but he’d still spent the day trying to figure it out with John, until he’d finally come to the only sane conclusion himself; self sabotage) or capturing the culprit who was painting unsavoury things onto all the police cars in town (an old bully of Sherlock’s from the year above, Brendon Ward who’d returned for the summer hols, and was now doing community service for the church), and the most riveting of all crimes, the murder of Whiskers, the British shorthair who’d been the towns beloved cat for decades (that had turned out to be a hit and run, no malicious intent, just an asshole with no regards for local pets), they had become the crime-solving duo of the town.
Sherlock smiled, “Very good, John, how did you know? Most people just assume I’m a psychopath, as you previously witnessed.”
Sherlock smiled at him, “You’re my friend too, John. I’m not half as extraordinary as you are.” John didn’t say anything to that, because he knew Sherlock wasn’t talking about his smarts, but the change he brought to Sherlock’s life.
With narrowed eyes and a set jaw, Sherlock turned, only to see three more of her friends, along with Phil Anderson right behind him.
John fumbled for a minute, recovering from thinking he’d offended Sherlock, which was nonsense, because he’d been quite right in his deducing, “Well… I had a friend in primary school, he was a lot less high-functioning than you, but you’re aspergic, right? You show some of the same behaviours he did. The most obvious is your lack of understanding social signals and cues, which is what makes people think of you as ‘weird’ or ‘different’. You’re obsessive with your cases, and your deducing - and let’s not forget your bees.” Sherlock smiled at that. He’d remembered when they’d been curling up on the red sofa together in the living room, watching some silly sitcoms on the tv, someone had killed a bee for comedic effect and Sherlock had become so angry - John had found it quite funny, but was sympathetic all the same, “From what I can gather, before I came along, you’ve had a complete lack of interest for people in general, and didn't have any friends, which still upsets you.” Sherlock opened his mouth to defensively disagree, but John shut him up with a look, “Also, your complete lack of understanding for sarcasm just tops it off.”
“Um, Mr. Sherlock?” Harry tugged lightly on his shirt sleeve, obviously she had yet to have a growth spurt, and due to the look of John and their mother - height wasn’t in the family.
Sherlock’s hands were scraping gently down John’s back as they kissed feverishly, mouths melding together and hands wondering; just as John paused to trail kisses down Sherlock’s throat, there was a knock at the door.
Sherlock heated at the wanton words, but shook them from his head, “If you keep stalling, you won’t be the first to touch me right now.”
“Anyway, who’s this? Did your mum pay someone to spend time with you? Wow, that’s really something.” Sally laughed, her friends, who flanked her rather like cronies than anything else, barked out their own cackles. Sherlock simply rolled his eyes, glaring stubbornly at the floor.
John and Harry, who visited mostly and only for the phone and the food, practically lived at the manor, which was actually pretty good for their mum, who spent hours setting up her home business as a seamstress (she was quite good, even Sherlock could admit without bias, she’d once mended one of Sherlock’s suit jackets after it had been ripped in a tussle with a shoplifter, and she’d had it back to him, almost good as new in hours) so she could spend more time setting herself up to be a more steady income of money for her children. Sherlock had never had a friend before, and the moment when John first called him his friend, Sherlock had almost teared up. The two had been stopped by a group of teenagers that went to Sherlock’s sixth form, where John would be attending for his last year in the coming autumn, and immediately began shouting abuse at Sherlock.
Summertime was coming to a close, and for the first time in a very long time, 17-year-old Sherlock had a friend. Young John Watson was funny, smart, yet still average enough that Sherlock felt awed when John would describe him as ‘
friend like that? And no I’m not being paid, thank you very much, he’s got too much dignity for that, unlike you, who apparently has no dignity whatsoever.”
Now, they were alone by a creek in the woods past the back of the Holmes manor, John’s shirt was torn from his shoulder to his belly leaving room for golden skin to peak from its depths. Like children, only moments before they’d been pretending to be pirates, slashing at each other with sticks for swords. In a final battle fought most valiantly, John had slipped on a mossy rock and tumbled to a most imminent death, but not before Sherlock grabbed onto his shirt, thought momentarily
“There’s always something.” Sherlock locked eyes with John, knowing that apologising for what John’s father had put him through, wouldn’t help. John was the type of man who would talk only if he felt the need to, definitely not if he was prodded at, “Now, you want to be a doctor, help me with something, completely hypothetical. So a man has been murdered-,”
he thought explosively, he’d been hoping to keep this from John at least until they got back to school - weren’t all these idiots supposed to be on holiday in Ibiza or some other such moronic holiday destination?
“Hmm? Oh, just… how much I like it here. Didn’t think I would, thought it’d be too quiet and… peaceful, but it’s not really is it?”
Suddenly he felt compelled to move forward, and trace those stars with a trail of kisses, but he held back. Eyes moving to lock with John’s gaze from under his curls. He stared intently, irrevocably, unwaveringly at him, as if it were the first time he was seeing John Watson. He’d had many moments like this before over the summer, he’d spent hours alone at night thinking of the precise twinkle in John’s smile. The galaxy of colours that revolved his eyes, his laugh, the way his hair fell, the way his tone of voice changed when Sherlock looked at him a certain way. The way he-
With a quick nod from Sherlock, whose face was flushed red, John began to stroke Sherlock from base to top, twisting at just the right angle to have Sherlock throw his head back. John started to kiss up Sherlock’s chest, biting and sucking his way up to Sherlock’s neck. Once he found the most sensitive spot, he bit down, tongue flicking over the skin as he sucked it into a blossoming bruise. He carried on with his ministrations up to Sherlock’s ear lobe, taking the flesh into his mouth and tugging on it gently to elicit another one of those breathy moans from Sherlock’s lips.
“Don’t pay them any mind, Sherlock, they’re all just idiots.” John mumbled into Sherlock’s hair, despite him being much taller. Sherlock was almost hunched over in his embrace with John, yet he was more comfortable than he’d ever been standing straight, just being this close to John caused a wash of calm to sweep over him.
“‘Course, we’ve heard all about you. I’m Jane Watson, and this is my daughter Harriet and my son John. We’ve just moved into the village.” Her accent was softer than most cockney accents Sherlock had heard, yet was still very prominent. What Sherlock clung to most, however, was her son’s name, John.
Next Sherlock turned to John, “I’ve bought us a few minutes, come on, over here to the creek. Splash your face, it’ll help.”
“What were you thinking about? The other afternoon?” Sherlock asked, pulling back from John and hovering over him. They were sprawled out on Sherlock’s bed, John had been reading aloud some stories about white knights and round tables, which hadn’t interested Sherlock at all. The only reason he’d kept quiet until now was for the continuation of John’s soft voice echoing the literature and painting a beautiful picture with his passion.
“God, John! Take a picture, it’ll last longer!” Harry suddenly piped up, reminding both boys, that yes, she was still there, “And you might want to put a shirt on sometime soon, mum isn’t going to miss those, you know.”
Sherlock shook his head and began to shift, he couldn’t hold back any longer, “No.” he breathed, “Please don’t… freak out.” He murmured, then he was moving closer and closer to John. Eyes locked onto John’s lips, his own shirt, an unbuttoned white cotton, was draped haphazardly on his shoulders, and it slipped down his arms as he moved to glide a hand over John’s chest, and up his neck to rest on his face.
Then, slowly, Sherlock leaned in, eyes open and studying John’s face as he lightly pressed his lips to John’s. When he made no move to discourage Sherlock, the taller boy began to kiss him again and again, eyes now slid shut he moved from his face to his neck. He followed the breadcrumb-path of freckles down John’s torso and tore the rest of the shirt away with a simple tug. He trailed delicate kisses back and forth between John’s abdomen and the corner of his lips. Then, suddenly, as if he’d only just realised what was going on, John reacted. He surged into action, capturing Sherlock’s lips with his own and, opening his mouth hungrily, he allowed Sherlock to swipe his tongue over John’s lips.
“Well,” John began after calming down slightly, “you know what people say. If you don’t understand it, then it’s automatically weird. But, you know what, screw anyone who ever told you to ‘piss off’, you’re seriously intelligent. Obviously, in the future, whilst you’re out making the world a better place, all those who mocked you for being smarter than they are, will be busy becoming petrol station attendants, or till servers in Sainsbury’s.”
Sherlock was met with silence for a moment, before John was letting out a full, belly-aching fit of laughter, eyes squeezed shut and almost hunched over, clutching at his stomach. Sherlock couldn’t help but chuckle along with him, laughing quietly behind closed, yet upturned, lips.
“Where do you think you’re going freak? Running off back to mummy?” Phil sneered, looking quite pleased with himself.
Sherlock let out a strangled whine, head thrown back as John went back to his previous actions, stroking Sherlock’s cock and nipping bruises into his neck.
John shrugged, moving his hands up to smooth out the wrinkles in Sherlock’s shirt, “We lost track of time.” Then he pulled Sherlock in by the lapel and kissed him square on the lips. They kissed for a moment, then John pulled back, “Sorry, was that alright?”
“-alright, alright. Listen to me. It’s okay. You’re alright, you’re in our place, it’s me and you and your sister and it’s alright John. Come back to me.” The sound of Sherlock’s voice, a calm and cool baritone lulled his subconscious into security, and almost as soon as his panicking had begun, it subsided. Sweat dripped down John’s neck and he realised he’d been gripping onto his own hair so tightly, he’d pulled some out. Slowly he let his body relax, and with an unsteady breath he turned back to focus on Sherlock.
Her comment had only caused Sherlock to ache, knowing it was John who’d let her curse - John who’d accepted Sherlock within a heartbeat, John who’d stood up for him after knowing him only a week, John who always made sure the fridge at home was stocked and his mother had eaten, and that Sherlock had eaten. John with a heart of gold. John, who Sherlock had tossed aside due to sheer pride and stupidity.
Oh God, he found himself crouching down on the ground, breathing heavily, mind whirring a mile a minute.
Sherlock shot him a vicious look and ducked into a door by the side of the room. Directly next to Sherlock’s room was a bathroom with a luxurious shower, toilet and sink unit, on the other side of the room, was his brother’s bedroom - thank the Lord both doors locked from the inside. Sherlock shut the door harshly and John sent Mycroft an apologetic look.
John raised an amused eyebrow and let out a laugh, “It should scare me how gleeful crime makes you, but I can’t help but think how adorable you look.”
“That was too many adjectives, John.” Sherlock mumbled, eyes downcast and cheeks renewed with a magnificent ruddy red.
Suddenly, Sherlock was coming in thick ribbons onto his stomach and chest, flopping backwards, sprawling across their blanket. John straddled Sherlock and started to kiss and lick at the cum on Sherlock’s chest, earning himself another, slightly pained groan from Sherlock.
“Now, Mycroft, don’t be rude to your brother. How was the exam dear?” She asked, to which Sherlock gave a forced smile.
John nuzzled into Sherlock’s neck, whispering sweetly into his skin, “There are never too many adjectives to describe you, Sherlock Holmes. Extraordinary.”
“Oh no, I thoroughly intend to do everything I can to make you make more of those delicious sounds.” Sherlock mumbled, throwing an arm over John’s chest and curling into him. He wrinkled his nose at the drying mess and, without a second thought he picked up John’s already ruined shirt, and used it to wipe away the mess.
Sherlock palmed John through his pants before hurriedly getting rid of them, then suddenly he paused. He stared lustfully at the flushed head of John’s cock, tongue darting out to lick his lips. A droplet of pre-cum dribbled onto John’s abdomen as his prick sprung to attention.
“Hmmmm.” Sherlock opened his eyes to glare unconvincingly at John, “You were thinking. It’s annoying.”
Sherlock blinked at him, ever so slightly shocked. Despite the obvious grief his sister and mother held, the boy (who was definitely Sherlock’s age, if not, older) seemed to be completely unaffected. A step-father, maybe? Yet he and the girl were both too similar in looks…
“Not helping!” John found himself gasping, still hyperventilating, there was wetness on his cheeks, his heart was beating sporadically. His hands were desperately clutching his hair, but he couldn’t seem to let go. He was aware of what was happening, but wasn’t in control of himself.
John was his and he was John’s. Perhaps they hadn’t yet discussed their relationship, maybe they were still in a transitioning stage from friends to more-than. But Sherlock’s mind was made up.
John grinned at the sounds falling from Sherlock’s mouth and swallowed any more noises with his own lips. It wouldn’t do to have someone interrupt them now. Heat coiled in Sherlock’s abdomen as John curled and twisted his fingers inside Sherlock, drawing sound after muffled sound from his lips, face a picture of bliss. Fat droplets of pre-cum formed on the tip of Sherlock’s cock and John captured them with his thumb, pulling back from the kiss to lick the cum into his mouth.
Sherlock please, I’m going to-,” John let out a high pitched gasp and his knees buckled forward again, “Sherlock!” He groaned,
For a moment Sherlock was frozen, eyes glazed over and lips left in a crooked grin, then he was straightening, turning and sashaying out the door, turning only to throw a sultry look over his shoulder. John swallowed thickly and almost didn’t realise Sherlock had begun to speak, “If we carry on just standing here flirting we’re simply wasting precious time thinking about things we could be doing. And the more time that is wasted thinking, the longer until we can
Mycroft sighed as John shuffled to stand, glad that any hints of arousal were scared off as soon as Sherlock’s brother had entered the room. The elder Holmes placed a hand on his companion’s back to steady him, “This is my friend, Gregory Lestrade.”
“Dull, I was done much before everyone else.” He turned to glance at the other family, catching the boys gaze yet again, “Hello… my name is Sherlock.”
Mycroft sent him a blank look, “Neither did you two months ago, now well… you’ve got more than just a friend.”
John snapped back into action and continued to pull Sherlock off, “Answer my question. What do you want?”
Mollified that he wasn’t in the wrong, Sherlock grinned, and moved to place his lips next to John’s ear, and whispered, “John, when have I ever done something I don’t want to?”
In that same high pitched gasp, and he was coming in ribbons down Sherlock’s throat. The taller boy gagged slightly, swallowing down as much of the ejaculate as he could, the salty, yet bitter taste wasn’t totally revolting. The fluid dripped from the corners of Sherlock’s lips, and as he looked up, John collapsed to the ground, practically glowing. He kissed Sherlock passionately, like a dying man in a dessert in desperate need of water, with Sherlock as his only supply.
John grinned back, “A lot very good.” They linked hands absently, and began the walk back. It took them exactly 7 minutes and 48 seconds to reach the window at the back of the Watsons’ home, and there lay a red collared polo shirt, much like the one John had been wearing earlier. He slipped the shirt on and checked in the reflection of the kitchen window that nothing could be seen - thankfully everyone was in the living room at the moment. So, daringly, he turned back to Sherlock and took his hand.
Keening noises erupted from John’s throat, mouth now hung open in bliss loud moans echoing around them as Sherlock continued to wreck John with his mouth.
John paused for a moment, they haven’t got any lube to his knowledge, “Sherlock, I need some… do you have anything to lubricate with?”
It took John a moment to register that the reason his laugh sounded so wet, was because tears were still streaming steadily down his cheeks, “Hey.” He replied, taking a few long breaths, “Sorry, haven’t had one since… in a… in a while.”
When she, daddy, Mycroft and Mrs Watson had moved on and they’d arrived in the kitchen Sherlock turned to John, with curiosity on his lips and said, “So, which was it, football or rugby?”
“You’ve never…” John babbled, “But you just- that just then- you. Fuck. Sherlock you’ve never blown someone before?”
Sherlock was wearing nothing but a precariously placed blanket and was still very much half asleep, so it was as much as a surprise to both of them when a loud girlish scream, accompanied by words, erupted from the tree line.
As soon as they’d fought their way through the brush and into a copse of trees, Sherlock yanked on John’s arm to stop him and before he could say a word, pulled him into a bone crushing hug. He buried his face into John’s neck and took a deep, ragged breath, willing away the wetness in his eyes. Tactfully, John said nothing for a few minutes, and simply returned the hug, rubbing his hands up and down the arc of Sherlock’s spine.
John had grabbed Sherlock by the arm and marched away with him, a stormy look on his face as Donovan called back in a futile, last-ditch effort to retain the last word, “Oh yeah? Where so important!?”
“Nope!” John grinned, moving closer to trail little pecks up Sherlock’s jaw, “I love this, you look so peaceful, so… calm, sexy, even.” He drew back, punctuating every compliment with a kiss, creeping closer and closer to Sherlock’s lips, “Cute-,”
John snorted, and without hesitation leant up to smother Sherlock with kisses until his face was pink and a dopey grin crossed his features. He scrambled over the side of the bed to his backpack, and before Sherlock could register what he was doing, he was snapping a picture with his brand-new Polaroid camera. The picture came out and John held it steadily from Sherlock’s reach until it had developed.
They’d been solving a case - Sherlock couldn’t even remember what it was about now - and they’d been interviewing a girl a little younger than they were, Sherlock had been so harsh on her he’d brought her to tears. That had been a no-no for John and when Sherlock had sneered, “Oh, she’ll get over it, sentiment it simply a human defect, John! Really, I’ve weighed everything, and some tears from her are hardly worth saving for the end goal!” John stood up and made to leave the room.
John had left him there, and within minutes Sherlock had finished the case and anonymously tipped the local police. Then he’d gone back to the manor to sulk. It took two days before Sherlock realised what an arse he’d been, and from Harry no less, who’d practically been living with Sherlock and John at the manor, making phone calls to Clara whenever she could.
“Of course I remembered, I remember all the important things.” Sherlock said unblinkingly, as if it was something of real importance. Harry’s smile seemed to widen, “Now, what was it you wanted to ask me?”
John began to piston his fingers into Sherlock’s hole, scissoring them as he aimed for his prostate. Soon enough he hit the spot, and-
John shook his head, he couldn’t, everything was too much, why was everything too much? He felt a hand touch his cheek, and at first, he flinched away from it, but the hand stayed steady, it felt warm, and slowly he let himself be brought back.
John watched as Sherlock swept out the door, tousled curls bouncing as he flashed him a simply predatory grin. He shook his head, God, he couldn’t imagine a future without this brilliant and utterly baffling man. They made it through the rest of the day, and soon enough John was getting ready to head home. They were alone in the hallway, barely out of sight of Sherlock’s family and Harry who were saying goodbyes outside. He grabbed Sherlock by the shirt collar and planted a firm kiss on his lips. They heard Harry bark out laughter and the Holmes parents exchanging pleasantries. Sherlock was more than convinced by the look his mother gave him, warm and ever so slightly reprimanding, that they had most definitely been caught in the act. But frankly, he couldn’t care less.
A young boy with tawny blond hair, and sapphire eyes stared straight at Sherlock, lips twitching into a grin that seemed to say,
Anderson threw his hands up in exasperation, but Donovan wasn’t fazed, “Shut up, freak, he’s not my boyfriend.”
Soon after they were back to being as sickeningly sweet as before, now Sherlock was a little more mindful of how he acted to others, occasionally turning to John to ask if something he’d said or done was “not good”, to which John would usually reply with a fond, “yeah, bit not good, Sherlock”.
“Wrong.” John grinned, voice imitating Sherlock’s own usual impassive dismissal, “You do care, you pretend that you don’t. It’s okay to care. I care about you Sherlock, which is why I had to stand up for you. Also, you’re not a sociopath, being autistic doesn’t make you a sociopath!” John paused then, face a mess of worry, “Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that-,”
“Oh!” Her smile turned sheepish, “I was… um… well do you have a house phone I could use? I promise I’ll only be five minutes! I just want to call my best friend, Clara…”
“Anything. I could suck you off, like you did to me… I could edge you, touch everything else but your dick for hours until you’re so pent up, you’re begging for release… I could finger you-,”
“Us! If we don’t get back to my house-,” He checked his watch again, eyes widening in panic, “17 minutes ago!”
After an awkward tale of a made up case, involving a strange spike in the burglary of ornate Santa figurines, and falling asleep by the creek, backed up by way-too-enthusiastic shouts from Harry, eventually they all sat down to eat. John and Sherlock may have been holding hands under the table, but whose business was it but theirs?
“Wait- hold on- wait a minute.” John let out a breath, pushing gently at Sherlock’s shoulders to have him sit back up, “Sherlock-,”
John gave him a bewildered look, yet somehow continued to smile fondly at him, “I didn’t say anything.”
“Sherlock.” John scowled at him, “Neither of us could’ve known, we forgot… we were having fun. Don’t you ever apologise for that, you were magnificent, wonderful. You made me feel so special. My anxiety isn’t anyone’s fault. It’s irrational and there’s no one to blame for it. Come on, I’m feeling much better now, you did good, Sherlock.”
John groaned low in his throat, “This is so arousing.” He murmured, “Never been touched. I’m the first to touch you like this. Have you been kissed before? But you still seem so experienced… God, the way your mouth works, I’ll be ruined for everyone else, ever.”
Sherlock grinned, “Ah, yes, a shot in the dark that one, but you just confirmed a moment ago when I mentioned ‘privacy’. Now, privacy is something crucial to someone hiding a secret, there wouldn’t be privacy in changing rooms, which is why your father stopped you from playing rugby. It’s obvious you still love the sport, so would never quit by yourself and will stop at nothing to carry on playing, be that professionally with a league, or amateur games with friends. I’m guessing he also saw the sport as being homoerotic in subtext and pulled you out of it so you wouldn’t turn out ‘gay’ or some such other malarkey. Now, of course going for annual check-ups would possibly compromise your parents so blissfully constricted image of the nuclear family, should someone notice the plethora of bruises normally on your skin. There’s no doubt that he wouldn’t be sneaky about it, a prideful man, wouldn’t want anyone finding out he gets blind drunk and beats his son whilst his wife and daughter pretend nothing’s happening in another room - so no doctors, brushing visible only where clothing can hide, which shows in the way you dress. Long jeans, despite it being the middle of summer, there’s nothing to hide but the action has been beaten into you. You’re wearing a dark shirt, and still are wearing a tank top underneath, obviously to make sure no skin discolouration is detected. Your stance, the way you sit, the way you addressed my father, calling him ‘Sir’, more than a few times, I would’ve guessed a military background, but you’re only 17, and there haven’t been any wars, no reason your father needed to have enlist, so no military background. Just a father with a killer left hook when he’s wasted half the weeks wages on too many pints of dish-water tasting beer.”
He’d taken a leisurely walk home on his last day having just finished his final mock-exam, feeling a treat for himself was in order. He strolled through the wildlife that surrounded the small town and connected to the back of the Holme’s manor, following the creek and taking a pause at his special place - a small clearing at the edge of the creek that lead to a small set of mossy rocks and rapids. Mycroft had been back only a couple of days, and was found, as per usual these days, entertaining their parents in the parlour whenever Sherlock appeared home from school. After not having visited for the Easter hols; it seemed he felt the need to make up for it. (Sherlock didn’t much mind, he preferred the house without Mycroft. Mummy, however had thrown a fit and a half when the news came that her eldest would be staying at Oxford for the holidays.) So, when Sherlock grabbed an apple from the kitchen, he was rather startled by the unfamiliar laughter coming from the living room.
“You did miss one thing, though.” John cleared his throat, “It used to be mum. It started with her. I told him to hit me instead. That was before I started playing rugby, I was about ten when he first hit me. He didn’t make me quit to hide the bruises, he made me quit because he found out I was bisexual.”
“Sorry, did I do something wrong? I didn’t… did I misinterpret…?” John almost melted at Sherlock’s lost tone of voice, and quickly shook his head.
When John turned back around, Sherlock had collected himself, and was mostly dressed, left only to button his shirt back up. John found himself gazing at Sherlock, eyes wondering over the slowly disappearing skin, following the line of red and purple marks dotted up his chest and collar bone. Thankfully, as Sherlock finished the last few buttons on his shirt, none of the marks were visible. He looked up, realising he’d been staring long enough to be noticed, and glanced away bashfully when he saw that Sherlock had caught him staring.
“‘Piss off.’” John seemed slightly taken aback from Sherlock’s language, obviously thinking posh people didn’t swear, “Or ‘bugger off’, take your pick.”
“I was going to say extraordinary.” John muttered, “How… how did you know all of that? Just from looking at me? Honestly that is insane, that’s actually amazing.”
Sherlock hummed, “All of this doesn’t necessarily make me autistic, but you aren’t wrong, you’ve only listed the more prominent symptoms I show.”
“Didn’t think so, now back to my previous question, rugby or football?” Sherlock persisted, eyes narrowed in focus.
They lazed like that for hours, bantering, kissing and occasionally getting more passionate. As their kisses grew into something much more demanding, of
‘Sherlock, damn it, he can’t handle a rejection right now. You’ve got to knot him now,’ shouted Lestrade. ‘You’ve got to be in him!’
'Oh, oh my,' he was finally able to articulate. His diaphragm worked large lung-fulls of air into his body. He instinctively reached for his member and testicles and confirmed for himself that he had not ejaculated. He tried to frown in confusion, but his body was too relaxed to maintain the expression.
‘Lestrade, we cannot delay him anymore. I . . .’ Sherlock started but paused. ‘John is friend, and I do not want to force this on him, but I also cannot let him suffer anymore. We must act.’
John shuddered and weakly raised his leg unconsciously. As the fingers probed and prodded dryly, he buried his face into Lestrade’s shoulder.
The pain had eased considerably, though his sphincter throbbed around the pressure with every beat of his heart. John attributed his blackout to a sudden drop in blood pressure and exhaustion. Had he eaten anything more substantial than tea and crisps in the past three days, he was certain that he would have vomited right at that moment. He also decided that he would feel considerably better if he could have made a mess on Sherlock’s fancy queen sized mattress.
John groaned in obvious displeasure. 'Why?' John's voice was small. Despite having just experienced an overwhelming orgasm, he was keen to continue with the sex. Another flush of heat burned across his skin and weakened his muscles. 'Oh, please! I can't . . .'
Greg took his opportunity to call Mycroft. His thumbs weren’t steady enough right now to text, and Mycroft always preferred a phone call from him. He slipped down the stairs, and it wasn’t half a ring before Mycroft answered,
‘Help me get him to the floor,’ gasped Lestrade. They laid John’s limp, unconscious body supine on the rug. ‘He’s burning up. We need to be quick about this.’
Finally Watson exhaled a held breath. He pulled the sheet higher over his body and relaxed his shoulders onto the mattress.
Not one to be overshadowed when it came to dramatics, John moaned and grasped at the bedding to announce his slow awareness into consciousness.
John had a final sob before he could feel the change in his blood. There was a a coolness in his body that he noticed first. With each beat of his heart, the burning of every nerve in his body eased and then changed into a sense of well being. He blinked and looked up at Sherlock's face. His vision was splotchy and twinged with green. The face before him was a blur of pink skin and brown curls. His breathing calmed. 'Sherlock?'
‘I’ve got you, John. I won’t leave you,’ Sherlock assured John. He was holding one of John’s legs over his shoulder and had John’s hips elevated on a pillow.
‘Fine, fine,’ said Lestrade. ‘I agree. But I think we need to give it a better try than that. You want to avoid bonding and traumatizing him. For now, this is still the best way. His temperature is down, so he has been receptive. His body just hasn’t accepted you. Sometimes it takes a few tries. That’s why heats last for days, not an hour.’
Sexual orientation was an extremely private matter, and the only people who would have discussed this with John would have been his parents. John was in for a shock if he did not know what it was to be an omega.
'I,' Sherlock's voice shook. 'I don't want you to leave me. I don't wan you sick. I don't want you mad at me for what we've done. How can you ever forgive what we've done?'
‘Most first couplings never even knot. Successful knotting can take a dozen attempts. John we didn’t have time to work up to anything, and I’m so sorry for that. You will feel so much better when Sherlock releases inside you.’ Lestrade swiped his thumb against the back of John’s hand as he held it. ‘We’re doing this because we care about you. Sherlock is shite for manners, but he is a damned good friend. All you’ve gotta do is relax and encourage his climax.’
'John I'd love to use the living room, but my knees can't take another round on the floor, and that couch - '
‘John, we are far from over, and Sherlock is still growing. His knot will continue to swell a bit bigger each time until he has reached his full potential. I promise you’ll feel better for it in the end.’
John knew that Sherlock had no idea where Mrs. Hudson kept the clean linens and he quickly identified the sheets as being those from his own bed. John otherwise would have found it novel that Sherlock knew the exact number of steps from the door to the top of the stairs but had no idea that there was a linen closet at the top of the landing directly ninety degrees of the door to the sitting room. Instead Sherlock’s blatant ignorance made John’s cheeks flush red in frustration.
Lestrade sighed, but he wanted to confirm his suspicions before explaining to Sherlock and John that if John was truly a virgin, he could be intact. 'John,' he started, 'I'll have a look again, shall I?' As John nodded, Lestrade moved to center himself between John's legs again. When John winced at the first touch of Greg's fingers, Greg shushed him and ran his other hand over John's knee. John's channel was more dilated, and Greg instantly found it as Sherlock had adequately opened John enough for Lestrade to slip his first tow fingers inside. 'Everything feels fine so far. I'm going to push deeper with one finger now.' When John nodded, he removed his index finger and pushed his middle finger deeper until he stopped as his finger was inside to the second knuckle. 'Oh, yeah, I feel what you're talking about. Oh sweetheart,' he said.  Greg's heart swelled with pity for the further discomfort that John was about to experience. 'I think the easiest thing to do is to breech your hymen now. It'll hurt, but I'll try to make it fast.'
Sherlock pulled at John's leg until it was bent over his own thigh. The skin was moist and hot, and he caressed the knee with his thumb to offer what comfort that he could.
John kept his eyes shut tight, not wanting to see two men between his legs with their fingers disappearing inside of him. He felt Greg pull his finger out slowly as he'd explained to Sherlock. The most alien sensation of Sherlock's long, single finger slide past his sphincter, up along his bladder, and right where his prostate, the place where his other body had a prostate went inside that place deeply. John indeed had another channel. It still felt tight around the width of Sherlock's finger.
Then John had started to feel the urges. He felt closer to Sherlock than anyone and had considered propositioning Sherlock again. But Sherlock bungled that when he asked about John’s alpha, life-partner, thing. John didn’t want to have sex with anyone else right now. Except maybe the queen. Why was that?
“John, Sherlock are you out here? Mycroft said- Oh God! My eyes! My poor innocent eyes!” Harry stood by the edge of their clearing, covering her face as she simultaneously screamed and gagged, “Why me!?” She wailed.
“That was…” John trailed off searching for words it seemed - ah, Sherlock had miscalculated the reaction, of course he was stunned to silence with how rude Sherlock had been.
“What on earth did you do that for?” Sherlock groused, sniffing indifferently, but allowing John to nuzzle his way back into his arms.
Sherlock felt a heat rise to his cheekbones from the gush of compliments, having only ever received them from few teachers and his parents, hearing such things from John seemed to send Sherlock into a momentary stupa. Sherlock cleared his throat.
John gave a snort of laughter and carded his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, “Sorry, didn’t mean to think so loud and wake you.” Sherlock grumbled something that sounded suspiciously like, ‘s’okay, because you’re pretty’ and immediately fell back asleep. Or at least, he tried to.
Sherlock set him an unimpressed look, “Anderson, don’t talk out loud, you tend to lower the IQ of the entire street. And, please if you’re going to try to insult someone, do be original, instead of just copying your dreary girlfriend.”
It had been several weeks since that day, and no matter what Sherlock did John only got seriously mad at him once.
“Yes, Harry?” Sherlock didn’t really know what to do with a pre-teen. Sherlock didn’t really know what to do with anyone who wasn’t a direct family member, if he was being completely honest.
If mum saw she’d know, there would be no way she’d think John was off with some girl from the village - he didn’t have any time to do anything like that, what with spending every waking minute with Sherlock. Besides they hadn’t even really talked yet, it wasn’t a one time thing, but was it just a summer thing? Was it a relationship thing? Or a friends-with-benefits thing? Mum didn’t even know he was bisexual yet! This wasn’t how he wanted to come out to her!
They kissed and hugged. They spent the next few hours in the garden conversing about old cases and laughing about silly things Lestrade had done over the years. They talked about what they would have done if Sherlock's mind had not been waning. There moment came to a halt at the announcing of dinner. They walked to the dining hall together and had their last dinner. When dinner was over they walked hand in hand to the lobby of the institution. This was the moment they had both been dreading for the last few hours. John released Sherlock's hand and walked towards the exit but stopped and turned around when Sherlock said something to John that he would cherish forever.
Sherlock looked up at John, “Don’t be. You’re right. Emma comes first. I didn't mean to lose sight of that. It is just the thought of possibly dealing with Moriarty again is such a rush.”
As John was finishing up making breakfast, Mrs. Hudson walked in, “Yoo-Hoo. Sherlock, a letter was left for you.” She brought it over to him. John and Emma watched as Sherlock examined the letter. The envelope was made of expensive stationery in exquisite calligraphy on the front was Sherlock’s name; ink still wet. He flipped it over to find a semi-smudged fingerprint. When he opened the envelope, inside he found a small card with a handwritten message on it that said, 'the game’s not over.' on the back of the card was a Big
“Downstairs with Mrs. Hudson. I wasn’t sure what would happen between us when I got home and I didn’t think she needed to see us fight. So, are we?”
“I know. You’ve spent every minute constantly reminding me of that when I take a case. Just because you keep stating it, doesn’t change anything.” Right then and there Sherlock closed his eyes tightly regretting those words he just spoke.  “John. I am sorry. I didn’t mean it.” He stated soft and somberly.
Sherlock did not respond he simply turned and left Lestrade’s office. All the way back to Baker Street, his mind was all a buzz with this new information. Once he entered the flat, he pulled out the cards and put them up on the wall again. He paced back and forth in front of the sofa while going over everything again in his mind. A thought occurred, if anyone had an answer it would be Mycroft. He grabbed his cell to call his brother. Sherlock informed Mycroft on everything that has happened. Mycroft had no answers for him but he did assure him that he would look into. He could sense that Mycroft was withholding information.
Emma had had enough with her parents bickering. She closed her book and loudly placed it on the table in front of her; they both looked at her. John responded to her rudeness, “Oi! Was that necessary?”
John nudged Sherlock to hand over the evidence. He walked over to his desk and placed on it the envelope, the card that was inside, and the fingerprint square he cut off the envelope. He also placed a little notebook explaining the evidence he had already gathered on the desk. Lestrade looked up at them with a confused expression on his face waiting for them to explain.
He figured there was no point no point in hiding it now but he would subtly play the conversation by ear. “Yes. In a way.”
“John. . . .Thank you for being the best thing in my life. You have been there for me at my best and my worst. Know that no matter how bad my mind gets, I will never forget you.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I want to visit everyday but your right. It is becoming increasingly harder for me to come here.”
Lestrade picked up the card to look at it. When he flipped it over, he saw the “M” on the back and his face went pale. Sherlock squinted his eyes watching him intently as he sarcastically commented, “very good, Lestrade. I see you recognize the signature.”
John nodded in acknowledgment, “That’s exactly what we were thinking but we don’t want to take any chances.”
Around noon he was interrupted out of his mind palace by Mrs. Hudson entering their flat. She handed him the newest envelope and went back down to her flat. He opened it; inside was a bullet similar to the one  from the gun Moriarty used to shoot himself. A note was with it ‘Isn’t it interesting how something as simple as a bullet or a fall could allow one to wipe the slate clean and start anew.’
The moment Sherlock heard the door close he got up, grabbed the envelope, and proceeded with his deductions. He started by cutting the partially smudged fingerprint off the back in hopes that maybe Lestrade could get an ID from it. He tested the envelope to see what it was made from.  He recorded his findings. Sherlock finished just as he heard John, Emma, and Mrs. Hudson enter 221B downstairs. John shared a silent look with Sherlock, as he entered their sitting room, in a sort of agreement that the conversation from earlier would continue later. The evening went on as usual, John made dinner while Sherlock and Emma worked on a kid friendly experiment. They waited ten minutes after Emma went to bed to start their conversation.  John brought in two cups of tea and as he handed Sherlock his cup John questioned him, “So what did you deduce while Em and I were out?”
“Okay. Sorry.” he scooted closer to Sherlock to cuddle just a little.  But to his surprise, Sherlock grabbed his pillow and the sheet off John and walked out of the bedroom. Sherlock had never done that ever. John was upset, he couldn’t understand why Sherlock was acting so strange.
“Ta for lunch.”  John called out to her as she left. When he heard her door close, he turned around towards Sherlock, “You could have said thank you.”
“For loving me, for all of our crazy adventure, and for making this anniversary a special one. It will be a memory I will cherish for years."
Sherlock to look sadly at John. He stood up from his chair and walked over to John but he receded back onto the landing and reentered the flat through the kitchen entrance. John walked back to their bedroom. Sherlock stood their helplessly as he listened to John pack a suitcase. John then went upstairs to Emma’s bedroom and packed a few of her things.
John was brought out of his thoughts by the sound of Sherlock and Emma laughing. He caught Sherlock’s eyes and they shared a smile. Sherlock entered the kitchen to grab a cuppa for Emma and himself. He kissed John on the cheek before he returned to the sitting room. He placed Emma’s cup next to her on the floor while he took his seat again. John continued cooking while Sherlock and Emma conversed, he joined in every now and then.
John kneeled in front of his husband, cupped his face with his hands, and questioned with happiness, “Sherlock?” He could see the warmth behind Sherlock’s eyes, the kind of warmth the man got when he was lucid. Sherlock went in for a kiss and as he pulled away, he stated, “Happy 50th, John. Love you.”
There was something that unsettled him about all of it. He was troubled, frustrated, and perplexed over these envelopes and the whole situation, in general. Was this really Moriarty? If so, what was the reason behind it all? Sherlock sat down in his chair to contemplate everything.  He was drawn out of his mind palace when he heard John and Emma coming up the stairs.  He quickly got up, walked over to the wall to take down the cards, and put them in his desk.
John was brought from his thoughts when he heard a car honk nearby. As he stood up from the bench to climb the stairs and enter the building, he briefly reminded himself to stay brave and true to himself about his decision.
Upon hanging up with Mycroft, he ripped the envelopes off the wall when he realized John and Emma would be home any minute. He sat down in his chair and opened a paper just in time for John to walk in.
“Thank you, Greg.” replied John. Sherlock nodded. They discuss a little more in depth on how to proceed with everything. Once it was squared away, they bid Lestrade a good day.
From his desk, he grabbed his UV light and shined it on both sides of the card. Plain as day a message appeared, ‘Play the game fairly and no harm will come to John or Emma. I will be watching.’ It was then that he played even more with the idea that Moriarty may still be alive. He had Emma after Moriarty died. Or this simply was a ruse that Moriarty set up to mess with Sherlock but that reasoning was so dull.  Even so the message was understood, loud and clear. *Why wait nine years?*
“I did tell you. I was helping Lestrade with a case.” which in all actuality was true just not specific.
The next morning, John woke up to find Sherlock gone. He made a mental note to talk to him later. This new Moriarty case is bringing out the worst in Sherlock; almost as bad as he was when they first meet. John took Emma to school then continued to the clinic.
Sherlock was a little surprised that John took his words so personal. His words were not meant to hurt or offend John. Sherlock had always had an issue with human nature but he was getting better at it. He was not quite sure why John kept trying to turn this into an argument.
No response came from Sherlock. In an attempt to reach him one more time, John decided to do what he always does. He would tell him the story of how they met, “Mr. Holmes, do you mind if I tell you another story?”
Sherlock looked at his husband with confusion at the apology, “Don’t apologize. If one of us should be apologizing its me for making you put your life on hold. For my lucid days given you hope. You have gone above and beyond for me and I have rarely given the same in return." Sherlock sighed sadly, "Please allow me to spend what little time I have left in my lucid state to carve out the best memory possible to carry with you as a ray of light on your darkest days of missing me.”
John interjected, “She’s not wrong, Sherlock.” He sighed and wiped his hands down his face before continuing, “I do have to restrain myself from not yelling at you and telling you how childish you’ve been acting. There has to come a time when our family becomes first priority and the cases become more of an occasional hobby.”
The mood in the room, suddenly, became very somber and Emma felt quite responsible for it. “I’m sorry.”
“But if he is dangerous and unpredictable than why are we going to do nothing?” Emma inquired as a matter of fact.  Sherlock invoked his daughter’s sass with a “yeah.” Then teased John by pointing at Emma and saying “see she understands.”
“We would be back at our flat surrounded by family and friends, listening to music and eating good food.” John smiled at the thought before continuing, “We would end the day with my husband playing our song, the one he composed for us, on his violin. Toasts would be made by everyone in the room. We would have cake and after everyone left for the night, my husband and I would sit down and enjoy a nice cuppa while reminiscing.”
Annoyed, Sherlock replied with a twirl of his hand for emphasis, “This isn’t a case. You yourself said Moriarty is dead. It’s nothing.”
“Thank you.” He hung up the phone, “The hair shows growth within the last couple of weeks. How is this possible?”
“No need to explain yourself. I know that my lucid days are few and far between. One day I wont be able to remember anything and your stories will not pull me from the depths of my mind.”
John was not convinced but he knew throughout the years sometimes it was best to just let Sherlock have a little alone time. He pecked Sherlock on the cheek and headed to bed.
John looked down at his chair arm and started messing with a loose thread, “Oh, I remember clearly.”
John took a deep breath in out before he started his story telling, “I am going to share with you the story of how my husband and I met. It began like this. . . “
Lestrade looked from John to Sherlock than back to John, “I understand. So, care to explain what I am looking at?”
He didn’t answer John’s question instead he changed the subject as he turned a page, “I saw Lestrade today.”
Sherlock sighed in annoyance. He hated it when John played the family card, which he rarely did. Don’t get him wrong he loved Emma and would do anything to keep her and John safe. But as of lately he felt stuck in a rut and he was making no attempt to hide his excitement with this new mystery.
Sherlock sat back down on the sofa, “I guess now is a good time as any to tell Emma about Moriarty.”
Sherlock had forgot all about the letter until he reached into his jacket for something. Sherlock stood up and walked out of the flat.
“If you agree to turn the envelope and the card over to Lestrade then I will allow you to be on the consulting end. But the moment that it proves to be false, the case is done. No more working it from your angle because you think Lestrade is an idiot.”
“Being your daughter, I have seen my fair share of your disagreements. However, within the last two days there has been a shift between you two. I’ve deduced that Moriarty is more dangerous than you are letting on.  You’re both on edge. You’ve unknowingly put distance between yourselves. There is anger behind your words which I have rarely seen in your disagreements before.”
John looked towards Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson, “He’s upset because I made him hand over the envelope to Lestrade.”
“What does it mean?” He said out loud angrily. Then a thought occurred to him, what if the card wasn’t blank?
Sherlock could not sleep last night, so he got up and went for a walk around London. Mycroft called him to make sure everything was okay. He gave him a simple answer and hung up the phone. He had too much on his mind and just wanted to be alone. He found himself at a crossroad, so to speak, in his mind. He found himself wanting to be honest with John and tell him about the envelopes but at the same time he wanted to keep working the case himself. He knew that he would be the only one clever enough to stop Moriarty, if he did in fact turn out to be alive. After a couple of strolls around central London, he looked at his watch. John and Emma were gone by now so he decided it was best to return to the flat to continue his thoughts in silence.
Sherlock looked at John while he gestured a finger towards Lestrade as he sarcastically commented, “Oh, he is going to be a big help.”
Sherlock dramatically plopped down in a chair with a huff out of frustration while John explained to Lestrade the evidence. “The envelope was dropped off yesterday. As you can see by the front, there is no address, the ink was still wet when we received it. The card there,” John pointed to it, “was inside.”
John smiled towards the end of the sentence at the thought of their anniversary, “It is a very special day for us and I wished to surprise him. We are celebrating our anniversary.”
Upon entering, he was welcomed by the nurse at the front desk, “Hello, Dr. Watson. How are you today?”
Sherlock sat there for a second, comprehending what John was asking of him, “Lestrade is an idiot and I will accept those terms.”
“Holmes? Are we related?” Sherlock got a glimmer in his eye, the same one, he usually got while trying to make a deduction.
John rested a finger to his temple with his thumb resting on his jaw. He squinted at Sherlock, “Why do you do that?”
“Thank you, Lestrade. John and I will come by tomorrow.” He ended the call and placed his cell back in his pocket.
“For now, we’ll treat this as a ruse until we receive more evidence. If you want, we can put a patrol car in your neighborhood as a safety precaution.”
Still avoiding eye contact, John stated somberly, “I am going to take Emma for a few days to Mike’s place. I think that we need some time apart.” He stood from his chair.
Obviously the father had just passed away, as the woman still adorned her wedding ring - had she left him or been left, no ring would be in sight, and she definitely wouldn’t have been rubbing at it tenderly every now and then, which indicated a sense of loss. There was a hollowness behind her eyes that could have only been there after a death of some kind - therefore her husband was no longer with them, as opposed to simply being at work. She was frail and by the yellowing of her finger nails, had recently picked up smoking - a boring case, Sherlock thought, she read like an open book. The young girl next to her had short, blonde hair, big blue eyes, and despite being around 12-years-old was sucking her thumb, an obviously recently picked up habit, shown by how she would forget to do it every now and then. Leaving her thumb in her mouth without actually sucking at it. Yet another indicator that a close family member of theirs had passed away was the way she was burrowed into her mother's side, whose arm was wrapped tightly around her, as if to protect - yet they were both quite safe and comfortable in the Holmes house. Neither seemed to be on edge or anxious, yet both still sought comfort. Sentiment was a human defect, Mycroft had told him once, so fleetingly Sherlock moved on to the last occupant of the royal blue sofa.
One Sally Donovan’s voice was the loudest of them all, “Oi, freak! Go back to your mansion, bet mummy’s missing you, isn’t she?”
God, was he adorable, so sleep addled, John mused, barely able to keep the dopey grin from his face.
John captured Sherlock’s lips with his own, grinning to himself as he felt he pout melt from his lips. He deepened the kiss, drawing weak sighs from Sherlock’s throat, and suddenly pulled away, “You are a magnificent, wonderful, amazing, beautiful, peaceful, calm,
“You should apologise.” She’d said one day, passing him in the hall, having just hung up the phone, “He’s angry… but mostly upset. He thinks you don’t care about him.”
“I’m not a psychopath, Anderson, I’m a high-functioning sociopath, do your research.” Sherlock growled, only to still slightly when he felt a calming hand on his arm.
“I do hope you two aren’t too preoccupied for lunch?” He raised an eyebrow, earning a sneer from his younger brother, “Mother wants us all down in five minutes, if you wouldn’t mind… freshening up and coming down, I’m sure that would be appreciated.”
“Sherlock if you start deducing right now, I will be forced to take you straight back to that bed and have my way with you - now kindly shut up and let’s
Harry grinned, she felt like a special operative in some secret spy mission, “Crystal, boss!” Then she was turning tail and running back up the path to the house.
When John woke, the sun was setting and a rosy hue had settled over their clearing. He lay with Sherlock draped over his chest, sleeping soundly, both curled up underneath the shade of the large ash tree. John took a moment to watch and listen to the bustling wildlife, small critters, like hares and squirrels, scurried around the underbrush, blue birds sang sweetly above the treeline, and ducks waddled along the edge of the creek, guiding their ducklings toward the lake. He’d always loved the hustle and bustle of inner-city London, how you could hear ambulances, parties, people anywhere and everywhere, no matter the time of day or night. When mum had told them they were moving to Wiltshire, John had thought the country would be boring - somewhere old people went to slowly retire - but really, it was just as exciting. Of course, he’d had Sherlock’s craziness to balance out his own thirst for adventure, but the wildlife itself was always at work, always avoiding danger. From the small fowl avoiding the fox, to the deer running from hunters when in season, something dangerous was always afoot.
John stared at him, whilst Harry gave a squeal of delight and threw her arms around Sherlock’s mid-section, “Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!” She cried, rushed off down the hallway, and within minutes was babbling to, who Sherlock assumed was, ‘Clara’.
“Um, we won’t be a minute.” He assured. Once Mycroft and Greg were gone, John turned to see Sherlock emerging from the bathroom, hair combed and wearing a fresh change of clothing.
“Exactly.” She looked up at him with her big, amused eyes, “It’s stupid to make him think that, so go over and bloody apologise to him. And make it mushy, he’s got a soft spot for mushy.”
She sat down on the floor and unloaded her backpack. John thought it was necessary for her to attend school so she could have friend’s her age. The two of them walked over to the kitchen for a cuppa while Emma started on her homework.
Arriving back at the flat, they found Mrs. Hudson and Emma making stew for lunch. Sherlock noticed an envelope sticking out of Mrs. Hudson’s apron pocket. As they all gathered in the kitchen, Sherlock grabbed the envelope out of her pocket and put it in his jacket. Emma and John grabbed a bowl of stew. Sherlock walked over to his chair, sat down and steepled his hands together. Mrs. Hudson brought Sherlock a bowl, he took it from her only to placed it down on the end table next to him.
Sherlock listened with his eyes closed to the story John was telling him. Upon finishing, John stood up from the chair and moved it back to its original place. His husband still sitting there eyes closed, he appeared statuesque. John walked over to his husband, leaned down to place a kiss to his temple as a single tear fell from his eye. Holding this position, he sighed at the sudden sadness that fell over him and swallowed the lump in his throat before whispering, “Happy Anniversary, Sherlock.”
They had quite a lovely chat once they arrived in the garden and got comfy on a bench. As much as John didn't want to he still had to say goodbye forever but he took a slight comfort in knowing that Sherlock won't even remember it.
Sherlock closed the paper and threw it to the floor, “Don’t start. You were the one who gave me the permission to consult with this. Or don’t you remember?”
Sherlock’s cell rang right as he opened his mouth to tell Emma about Moriarty. He stood up off the sofa to answer it.  He turned to face John and Emma. “Do you have something?”, Sherlock’s facial expression changed. It was Lestrade calling to inform them of his findings. John could not hear Lestrade on the other end but he knew it was not good news by the look on Sherlock’s face.
The glimmer left just as fast as it appeared. Silence filled the room as Sherlock went back to his thinking pose. John stared at Sherlock and thought back on all the good times they shared. After seeing the deduction glimmer in Sherlock’s eye, John thought now would be a good time as any to tell Sherlock the story of the last case they ever worked together.  He pulled out his laptop and asked Sherlock if he could show him something. The man nodded in response.
Lestrade looked up to see them enter his office, “Good morning, Sherlock. John. What can I do for you boys?”
“Mrs. Hudson, I have something to ask of you but this must stay between us.” He pulled the envelope from his jacket and fumbled with it in his hands.
Taking a hint, John reached out for her hand as he stood up from his chair.  “Come on Em, let’s go see if Mrs. Hudson wants to go get some air and then get lunch.” She took his hand as she said, “Okay, but this conversation is not over.” John chuckled at her statement and they walked out of the flat down to Mrs. Hudson.
But before John could answer, Emma walked into the flat and cleared her throat to make her presence known. John and Sherlock both turned their heads to look at her. Sherlock patted his lap, she walked over and sat down. John wondered how Sherlock would introduce the situation to Emma. Sherlock could be very blunt at times. So, John waited until he saw that light bulb go off in Sherlock’s head and just as he was about to inform Emma, John stepped in.
Leaving Emma with Mrs. Hudson, John and Sherlock arrived bright and early to Scotland Yard. The cab ride there was a silent one. Upon reaching Lestrade’s office, John turned to look at Sherlock, “Remember our deal.”
He came back downstairs and stopped on the landing before walking halfway into their flat. He stared at the floor as he said with a quivering voice, “I’ll see you in a couple of days.” He turned to walk away but Sherlock reached out and grabbed his arm. John stopped but did not face Sherlock. He felt Sherlock close the distance between them before he felt a soft peck on his neck. “I have to go.”
He arrived moments later to discover that a box was delivered to Lestrade. They opened it together, inside they found evidence similar to what was found on the rooftop at Bart’s after Moriarty shot himself with extra evidence inside like hair clippings and a note. The note stated ‘have you figured out how I survived yet? I provided you with evidence, prove I’m alive.’ Lestrade called down to evidence storage to discover the original box had not left its place on the shelf. Anderson took the hair for forensic testing. Sherlock paced Lestrade’s office while they waited in agony for the results.
Their daughter sat on the sofa pretending to read her book but in reality, she was watching them. She was still unclear as to who this man, this Moriarty, was. She wanted to know why he had such a hold on her parents. Soon she would inquire to get an answer.
He entered the flat cautiously just in case Sherlock was still miffed. Sherlock glanced at the doorway gave John a little smile when he entered. He quickly to notice that his daughter was not with John, “Where’s Emma?”
“So…….Are you really not going to tell me what you did today?” he asked nonchalantly as he changed out of his clothes.
“Sherlock?” she inquired in surprise as he entered her flat and sat down on the sofa across from her.
It was then that Sherlock, surprisingly enough, stopped Emma from continuing. “I think that is enough deducing for now.”
Sherlock and John exchanged a look in agreement that they need to let go of the past and decided it was time to tell Emma about Moriarty.
Sherlock looked at Emma on his lap, “He is a consulting criminal mastermind who likes to play very dangerous games.”
He commented under his breath, “Oh, dear god.” He made a waving motioning with his hand for her to continue.
Sherlock continued when he knew that he had John’s full attention, “Moriarty does seem to be very much alive.”
Sherlock hung his head low looking like a child who was being disciplined.  John sat there looking at him realizing he was being unintentionally cross with Sherlock over something that could very well be nothing.
Sherlock went back to staring at the fireplace. They sat there for a good hour occupying themselves with other things. All the while their daughter secretly observing them in curiosity.
Sherlock stopped talking and glanced away from him. He was starting to wonder if things were starting to click for his husband. But instead John watched as Sherlock got up and returned to the leather chair he originally occupied. John joined him a minute later, they sat in silence for awhile before John returned to his book. As he started reading he thought to himself, ‘Don’t give up so easily. He is in there you’ve seen him lucid before.’ He closed the book, got up out of his chair and pulled it over so he was now sitting in front of his husband. He was going to use this time to strike up a conversation but was caught off guard when Sherlock asked him a question, “What do you plan on doing for your anniversary when your husband arrives?”
John embraced his hand and gave it a shake as he said, “John Watson-Holmes.” He couldn’t stop himself. It sort of came out, he mentally slapped his forehead.
Sherlock, of course, ignored him. When lunch was finished, John sat down in his chair watching Sherlock stare mindlessly into the fireplace while Emma sat down on the sofa with a book. After a few minutes, Sherlock returned John’s gaze and spat out, “What?”
They spent about twenty minutes telling Emma everything that Moriarty did and the reasons why they were so on edge about the whole situation. When they came to the end, they asked her if she had any questions or needed clarification on anything. Emma understood everything they told her. They spent the rest of the day enjoying each other’s company and not stress about the possible impending danger.
Lestrade informed them of the analysis as he took his seat again, “Let’s get to it, shall we? Analysis came back from the envelope. Everything points back to Moriarty. The stationary he used and the fingerprint. But by no means does that suggest he is alive. This could have been set up before he died just to mess with you in death.”
With that John walked out of their flat and down to Mrs. Hudson to collect Emma. Sherlock stood frozen where John left him in their flat. The next thing he heard caused his heart to shatter in a million pieces. It was Emma’s sad broken voice pleading with her dad to stay and reconcile. A tear escaped Sherlock’s eye as he shut his eyes tight to the sound of Emma’s voice. The sound he heard next brought him to his knees; the sound was the door of 221B closing shut.
When he heard John in the bathroom getting ready for bed, he pulled out the envelope. His name was on the front just like the first one but when he opened it there was a blank card inside. He put the envelope card in his desk and headed to bed.
They sat there staring into each others eyes longingly but John knew it couldn't last ans despised himself for what he was going to have to do next. He was surprised when Sherlock beat him to the punch.
“Oh?” John glanced over at Sherlock who was still standing in the doorway. He could see a little smirk planted on Sherlock’s face.
