Luke huffed. “I give you the world and this is how you treat me? You haven’t even spoken to me all afternoon!”
Dean nods slowly and continues. His fingertips brush against the slightly rough skin beneath the feathers. On the second pass, he gets to feel just how soft the feathers are. His fingers feel like they’re brushing through smooth silk. The sensation is unlike anything Dean has ever felt.
Dean earned full custody of Claire with the assistance of the paternity test, which was a massive relief. It was hard to feel relieved in that moment though, because Michael looked like he was ready to murder Dean right there in the courtroom.
Castiel turns to look at Dean. He looks good. He’s let a little stubble grow on his cheeks and it suits him. “Everything. How far we’ve come. I’m nervous, starting this next phase of my life, but I’m excited to be sharing it with you.”
Dean knocks three times on Gabriel’s apartment door, the sound echoing through the empty, carpeted hallway. Castiel stares at a fake plant at the end of the hall while they wait.
“Guess so. Cas seems to know more about this than me, but I think he’ll need help with interviews and some other investigative stuff.”
Gabriel shrugs. “Beats me.” Just as Castiel is about to ask another question, there’s another knock on the door. “I’ll get it.”
Castiel woke up and rubbed his eyes. “Hm?” When he noticed what time it was and Dean’s scent, he frowned. “Your heat is over? Already?”
Dean nodded and slipped the phone into his pocket. “We should get into town, see if anyone has seen either of them around. Do you have a picture of Jack, by chance?”
Luke wanted to leave during the reception. Castiel tried to ask him to stay, but he wasn’t in much of a position to ask for things. He searched the crowd and finally found Dean, gently grabbing his wrist. When the other omega turned, he smiled.
When Dean’s plate was clean, Michael finally arrived back at the table. “Sorry about that. Did you enjoy your meal?”
Dean is sitting in the living room when Castiel walks out. He stands up from the couch and grins. “You look good. Let’s go.”
“Of course, my love. Sit up a little.” He wrapped the collar around Dean’s neck, making sure not to fasten it too tight. He sat back and bit his bent finger as he looked at Dean. “You look beautiful.”
Castiel joins him a few minutes later with a bowl of pasta. After a few minutes of trying to decide what movie to watch, they settle on Mad Max: Fury Road.
“I don’t know what I did to make you run away, I tried to think of it but I couldn’t. I should have read you better, I usually can, I just don’t understand-”
Castiel feels tears welling up in his eyes. He looks around, desperate for a way out. He’s alone, helpless, and out of options. “If I do what you say, Dean lives? You won’t hurt him?”
Michael nods. “If you rebel against me, I’ll send all of Heaven after you. I do have that kind of power, unlike Zachariah. If you want your own free will, you have to give up your grace.”
“Because you need me to be. Truthfully, I’m as scared as you are. I don’t want this to mean what you think it means. But, I have hope. Our bond is too strong to just wither and fade. I think it would take a lot more than getting bored to bring us apart, don’t you think?”
“Great, city driving. My favorite.” Dean’s voice is dripping with sarcasm as he grabs his keys. “I’ll see you later tonight.” He kisses Castiel one more time.
Dean stares up at Castiel with wide eyes, heat pooling in his belly from arousal. “Damn, Cas. You like to be in control?”
Castiel kisses Dean’s forehead with a smile. “I’m still permanently afraid of water, so that’s okay.”
Dean smiled softly. “I’d like that.” He sat up fully and wiped his face again. “I can order the pizza.”
He heard a voice in the room and glanced towards the door. He saw a blurry outline of dark hair and scowled at the sight. “Go away, Cas!” He felt a cold hand on his face and got a better look at the man above him. He saw a lack of stubble and suddenly recognized Michael. More people entered the room in white shirts with red logos. Dean saw spots forming in his vision as he was jostled around, and the last thing he saw before falling unconscious was the ceiling of the foyer.
Dean shifts and slowly wakes up. He hums and sits up. “God, a nap didn’t even help calm me down from today.”
“What? No, I’m not. I’m not going to die, and I’m not talking like that either. I’m just saying, I’ll be okay, in a big ol’ mansion, and you’ll be taken care of too.”
Dean adds some syrup to his waffle and starts eating. “You’re right, this place would be fantastic for the munchies. I’d eat this for a hangover too.”
Dean bristled and held the steering wheel tightly. “My family ain’t exactly made up of kittens and rainbows.”
Dean looks at his duffel on the floor. “I’ll defend you if they come, but I don’t think I can hurt them. Gabriel said that nothing in my bag would do anything.”
For the rest of the afternoon, he explores the marketplace and samples food from several different vendors. As the evening approaches, he claims a spot on the field in front of the stage. He’s not right up in front of it, but he’s decently close with a good view.
“No, it’s okay. If I could contact them I would. Same with my sisters. I don’t even know how I would find a way to contact them. I’ve looked before, they’re not on social media.”
“Welcome to Georgia.” Castiel hands off the lawnmower to Dean and retreats to the air conditioning. He makes himself a glass of ice water and gulps it down, his throat thanking him for the refreshment.
Dean smiled brightly as he watched them push the toy trains around the little tracks. Claire did most of the track-building, and Jack made train noises and pushed the little toys around. It was adorable.
Dean leaned down and kissed Cas’s forehead. “I am thinking clearly. I know that I like everything about you, and there’s nothing that could scare me off. I’m just surprised you haven’t mentioned Luke.”
Dean’s alarm blared through the room early the next morning. He got up and rubbed his face before rolling out of bed. He opted to get dressed before going downstairs today, since Jack was here. He still felt weird, knowing that he wasn’t alone in his house.
Dean’s eyes widen. “Please tell me I didn’t give you your first kiss only to be a complete dick about it.”
Sam huffed and set his book aside. “I still don’t know why you’re doing this. I thought for sure you and Lisa were going to be mates.”
Castiel looks at Dean’s outfit of dark jeans and a collared short sleeve. “I don’t, but if you want to help, I can give you something to do once you change into more appropriate clothes.” Castiel chose to wear a fitted t-shirt and basketball shorts. He didn’t wear shorts often, but they seemed appropriate for being outside in the heat.
Dean walked over to the couch and sat down next to Castiel, curling up against his side. He pulled the other half of the blanket around himself and rested his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder. He took out his phone and ordered the pizza online while Castiel scrolled through Netflix to find a movie for them to watch.
“Darling, you already are mine.” Castiel pushed all the way into Dean with one thrust, making the submissive gasp in surprise.
Dean awoke to the sound of a knock on his door. Before he could sit up, Michael was walking in. He had a paper grocery bag in his hand.
“No, he didn’t sleep very well last night. I watched him. He kept having nightmares. He couldn’t figure out what they were about, but they still scared him. I watched him all night.”
The drive there is short, and Castiel spends the time telling himself to act like just a friend around Dean. It’s never too hard, and he knows it won’t be much longer before they tell their friends about their relationship.
Dean thought for a moment. “Probably. I could still get a little air in the whole time, so I felt safe. I think I was different with the collar too. I might be more aversive to hands. I’d like to find out though. It was really intense.”
Next, he had a big phone call to make: Sam. He took a deep breath before clicking on his contact name. He was pretty sure Sam didn’t have any classes right now.
Castiel frowns. “No, I think my choice is obvious. I’m not going back to the life I had before I rebelled.” He looks at Michael. “Take my grace. I don’t want it.”
Castiel led the way out of the station and to the car. They loaded the kids into their seats and got back into their respective seats.
“Oh, I babysit Jack during Castiel’s time of the month. He texted me last night. Is Jack awake yet?”
With that freedom, Dean grabs Cas’s hips and thrusts his hips up as he pulls Cas down. The added force makes both of them gasp. Cas grabs Dean’s arm with one hand while he strokes himself with the other.
“Because I fought alongside the humans, and they still lost. I hate that I couldn’t protect them, especially when they needed me most. I was one of very few angels fighting. The rest hid like cowards in heaven.”
Sam nods and finishes off his first bowl of cereal. He pours a second one. “Okay, that’s fine with me. When should we leave?”
“Wing maintenance is a pain. I need to groom my wings before we fly again. There’s a motel about a mile down the road.”
Dean kissed along Castiel’s jaw, nuzzling his nose against the scruff. “Don’t rush it and hurt yourself.”
After a solid five minutes of pushing the dildo in and out, Dean was no closer to release than when he started. It was deliriously frustrating. He wrapped his free hand around his cock and stroked himself as fast as he could. It almost didn’t feel good anymore, but he felt his orgasm building slowly. He stopped stroking himself to pump up the knot on the dildo. It caught his rim a few times before locking in place. Dean stroked himself a few more times, thinking that was all he needed to come, but nothing happened. He was so close, right there on the edge, and nothing was getting him that last push. He cried out in frustration and flopped onto his side, knotted dildo still locked in his ass. At least that gave him the tiniest bit of comfort, enough that after a while of laying there, he fell asleep.
Dinner was on the table a few minutes later. Castiel had made grilled chicken with mixed vegetables and rice. Dean cut up everything for Claire and gave Castiel a brief smile. “Thanks for the food.”
The next day, they were more rushed. They were clinging to each other desperately, riding every wave of heat quickly and passionately. Because of how fast they went, they had to take frequent naps to recharge their systems.
Castiel internally chastises himself for even thinking about Dean like that. Dean is his roommate, and if he’s not interested and Castiel makes a move, the rest of their one-year lease is going to be very awkward. Then again, Dean is being a little flirty, but that could just be his personality.
Dean soaks in the praise and nods. His head falls back, and he squeezes his eyes shut. “Fuck, I’m close.” There’s a hand on his face, tilting it up.
The next day, Castiel and Dean plan a new date. They decide that they can do Tuesday night, and they pick a local burger place that they both like.
Dean nodded and curled around a pillow, taking slow, deep breaths to try and calm himself. His stomach was tight and he worried that if he moved too much he might start vomiting. He had his eyes tightly closed, so the thing that signaled him of Castiel’s return was that delicious scent. He opened his eyes and saw a few bottles of water and a little medicine cup with pills in it.
Dean smiles and looks over the papers. “Thank you so much. Your advice actually really helped. I always skipped out on the outline stuff since I thought it was pointless.”
Castiel wakes up earlier than he expects the next morning. He looks at his clock and it reads 7:47. He rubs his eyes and sits up, sliding out of bed to go to the bathroom. He moves as quietly as possible to avoid waking up Sam. When he finishes his business, he starts to make his way back to his room.
It didn’t take long before Castiel was stripping slightly frantically, throwing his clothes so hard that they slapped against the wall before sliding to the floor. Dean followed close behind, pulling off his own clothes and dropping them off the side of the bed. He slid his hands along Castiel’s frame, holding him close as they kissed furiously.
Castiel pulled back and gave a soft smile. “Thank you.” He noticed that Dean's behavior was shifting a little. “You feeling okay?”
Dean looks over the mass of feathers and starts to notice just how out of place everything is. There are dozens of small sticks and leaves poking out, and none of the feathers are uniform. Instead of a row of neatly placed feathers that Dean would imagine on a bird, the feathers are facing every which way like a bad game of fifty-two card pickup.
“Dean? Oh thank god…” He got up and started to run to Dean to hug him, but suddenly stopped. “Sorry, I shouldn’t-”
Castiel shrugged. “You rearranged the sunroom beautifully. It was getting chaotic in there with all of the plants, but you made them all fit perfectly.”
“A few weeks, I think. Remember when the tinnitus started getting really bad and I went to health services? It was back then when I heard them for the first time.” Castiel wipes his eyes on his shoulder and sniffles. He finally opens his eyes and looks at Dean. “You think I’m insane.”
“I think this will work perfectly. You can stop the suppressants after the wedding, and then I’ll be the one to take care of your heats.” Michael took Dean’s hand and kissed the back of it. “I’m sorry you ended up in here again.”
Dean took a deep breath and tried to relax in the cold water. He felt a hand stroking his hair and closed his eyes. “I’m sorry.”
Dean was glad his back was turned, because his expression shifted greatly at that. That sounded delectable. Fortunately for him, Gabriel responded with a snort.
“If you’re trying to apologize about not showing up outside during the company dinner, don’t. I know Michael can be weird about that stuff sometimes. You don’t need to apologize for that.” He rubbed his scrunched-up nose, still focused on the fabric in his hands.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, the doctor said someone had to be with me or I’d have to start suppressants again.”
Dean frowns. “So, you’re not interested in a relationship anymore?” He wears his heart on his sleeve, despite the tough exterior, so Castiel knows he’s upset. His voice is a little smaller, his shoulders are slumped, and he’s drawn back slightly.
Dean fell asleep thirty minutes after retreating to his room to rest up. When he woke up four hours later, it was ten o’clock and he was getting clammy and hot. He grabbed his normal phone off the bedside table and texted Cas.
“Lawrence, Kansas. I was born there, then I moved around a lot with my dad and brother, and when my dad wasn’t in the picture anymore I got moved in with my Uncle Bobby. He’s not my actual uncle, we just call him that.”
Dean took several deep breaths and tried to keep his body relaxed. He started to feel some mild cramping, but a deep inhale of Castiel’s scent seemed to quell them. As the minutes passed, the room grew hotter and Dean felt slick leaking. He squirmed and whimpered, finding one of Castiel’s hands and holding it tightly. “C-Cas…”
The suppressants had worked wonders for Dean. He almost wished he could take them forever. The only ‘heat’ he had was three days of being unusually horny, which he could easily handle. He was still able to leave his room for food and water, and then return when he needed to. It was perfect...until Michael came home that night.
“Lastly, cut off the emotional bond. Now. If you don’t, Michael will eventually figure it out. He hasn’t noticed yet, but eventually he’ll get curious as to why he doesn’t only smell Dean’s arousal in there. If you blow your cover, Dean’s out of here and you stay.”
Dean let out a sigh of relief. “You’re a genius, Sammy.” He shook his head with a soft laugh. “I can’t believe I’m out either. It still feels surreal. Michael tried to get Castiel arrested with kidnapping charges. We think the driver saw us leave and we got chased down by police. It was terrifying, but with a few interviews there was no evidence that I was kidnapped and more evidence that Michael had made a false report. I’m supposed to go to the courthouse at some point to see if I can get a protective order on him.”
Dean stretched up and kissed Castiel again, one hand on his hip and the other brushing through his hair. “That goes for you too. I don’t care what you look like. You could ditch working out and get some matching love handles, and I’d still think you were smoking hot.”
Dean chuckled softly and looked over his shoulder. “I have more shredded potatoes for hash browns and we have lots of eggs.”
No, Castiel didn’t need to lie to Dean. He didn’t even have to give him details. He knew Dean well enough at this point to know that he wouldn’t probe. He didn’t feel the need to completely compose himself either. He got dressed and walked downstairs in his current state, his walk a little strained from his activities with Luke.
Dean woke up and squinted a little. The sun was coming up and shining in his eyes. He sat up quickly, not realizing that he just slept through the whole night. He rubbed his eyes and looked at his phone. There were ten missed calls from Castiel and a few texts.
Castiel excuses himself to his room after dinner, full as a tick. His mother is an excellent cook, so he always eats great with his parents. He closes himself in his room and checks the time, seven thirty. Dean still has a few hours to go. He pulls up his contacts and calls Dean. The phone rings twice before it picks up.
Gabriel sighs. “This whole experiment backfired more than I thought.” He shakes his head. “Okay, here’s the plan. You remember how to fight now, right? Here.” Gabriel pulls a long silver blade from his jacket and holds it out to Castiel. “This can kill an angel. Use it to defend yourself. The memories of using it will come back.”
Dean loved his relationship with Castiel. Things were moving at a good pace and they were happy. Lately, they had been doing kink related activities almost every day. They were growing in their practice of it, and it was fun.
Castiel raises his eyebrows, but he sends the address anyway. Meg is one of his closest friends, and he appreciates her company.
Dean stood up as well and started following Castiel out of the kitchen. He was led down another corridor and out the back of the house. The backyard was absolutely massive. All of the landscaping was beautifully done. There was a gazebo, a pond, and a huge vegetable garden. Flowers lined the back of the house and vines crept up the brick in weaving patterns.
Castiel looked at Dean and silently shook his head, a small frown on his face. He already knew Michael’s answer.
Castiel leaves the library and rides his bike to his class. The class is a discussion about the books they have read thus far and how they connected. Castiel isn’t the best at discussions but since he’s passionate about the subject, it comes more easily to him.
They got through two episodes before both of them were yawning. Dean looked at Castiel. “I’m gonna go to bed.”
Ash shrinks, taking in how bad his joke was. “Alright, seventy-five it is.” He pulls out his wallet and collects the cash. He walks over to Meg and holds it out.
Dean nods. “Took fifteen hours with all of my stops. I started at five in the friggin’ morning.” He picks up the mug and takes a long sip.
“I did, once. On one of my food runs while you slept, I took a quick shower. I believe that was on the third day.” He took a deep breath. “That smells delicious.”
He planned on sitting downstairs for a while, but paused when he saw Jimmy laying out blankets on the couch.
“Tired, but better. My heat ended early this morning, and I’ve been resting since then.” He seemed a little awkward around Dean, not moving as close as he usually did. “Did everything go alright with Jimmy? I’m sorry I didn’t have the chance to tell you he was coming. He comes every month.”
“They’re good. We just finished dinner.” Castiel taps his fingers against his leg. “I think they want to do an escape room tomorrow.”
Dean took off his shoes, belt, and pulled his wallet out of his pocket. Once he was clear of all metal items, he stepped through the detector. Nothing beeped and the TSA agent waved him forward, so he assumed all was well and collected his belongings.
Dean parades around the living room, bouncing Castiel on his shoulder. “Nope! I gotcha now!” He keeps one arm wrapped around Castiel’s middle and uses the other to hold Castiel’s legs to his chest. He swings him back and forth, cackling and grinning from ear-to-ear.
Castiel starts setting up their cups in the triangle formation. He pulls out the two ping pong balls that are in one of the cups and hands one to Dean.
“Thanks.” Dean navigated the halls of the station until he made it to the holding cells. What he saw in front of cell five startled him to say the least.
Dean nodded. “Uh, yeah.” He walked up to the cell and looked inside. Sitting on the floor was a boy who looked no older than twenty. He was chewing on a candy bar, a Three Musketeers from what Dean could tell.
His father arrives back at the house at five forty-five and comes in to see Castiel and his mother making dinner.
Dean followed Castiel into their house and immediately started stripping down to his lingerie again. “What are your plans?” He stepped out of his sweatpants and tossed his sweatshirt aside, then Castiel was on him, pushing him against the wall.
“Dean,” the man—Cas as Dean was now referring to him in his head since he’d already forgotten the rest—said. “It is a very great pleasure to meet you.”
Cas smacked his arm. “If I hadn’t already met your parents I would assume they were a vampire and a vacuum cleaner. How am I supposed to lead chess club with this?”
“Don’t worry, boss. I’d never let anything get traced back to you,” she assured him. “I like this cushy job too much.”
“Side project?” Dean asked, turning back from the door of his office to face her. “What side project?”
“We can’t exactly make a plan when we don’t know anything,” Charlie said. “Besides, there’s a bunch of police here and they have guns, so I’m feeling pretty good about this, actually.”
The others arrived about fifteen minutes later, Sam trailing awkwardly behind Meg and Hannah with his date, Ruby, in tow. She was a pretty, dark haired girl with a scowl to rival Meg’s.
Cas smiled as well. “To be fair, he knew a lot of them from deployment before he opened his donut shop.”
Dean immediately let go of Sam and spun around on the spot. “Cas!” he said as Sam stepped out of reach.
Dean heard Jack start to cry and reached back. “It’s okay, buddy, you’re okay.” He looked out of the car and saw more police cars pulling up, as well as an ambulance. Another cop came to the passenger side and opened the unlocked door. He announced that he had ‘found them’ and held a hand out to Dean, who shook his head.
Dean bathed Castiel as efficiently as he could, wanting to get him into bed so he could finally sleep. He skipped on bathing himself, deciding to do that later while Castiel was asleep.
Dean emerges from his room a few minutes later. He’s still bright red, and now wearing a lighter pair of jeans and a t-shirt.
“Alright. Sounds good.” Dean was excited to see Sam. As little time as it had been, it felt like forever. He and Sam never went as much as a day apart as kids. Dean was always there for him, and Sam never really went anywhere. It was scary to think that the kid was going to California so soon, but it was a reality Dean had to accept sooner or later, preferably sooner.
Jimmy seemed to have everything down pat with Jack. He thanked Dean for packing his lunch while he gave him breakfast.
Dean nodded and started cutting up Claire’s waffle, despite her protests and claims that she could do it herself. “Sounds good. I’ll probably spend a lot of time unpacking and making phone calls.” He passed the plate back to Claire once the waffle was in bite-sized pieces and started eating his own breakfast.
Castiel follows him, pulling the quilt around his shoulders. He sits on the couch with a sigh. He resists the urge to turn around when he hears a voice right behind his head. He takes a deep breath, calming himself down. There, he can handle this. This is manageable.
Luke blinked. “Oh, thanks for letting me know.” He rushed up the stairs, and Dean forced back a scowl of jealousy.
The pair sat in silence for a minute, panting softly and still holding one another. Finally, the feeling of come in his boxers made Dean grimace. “I should have packed more pants.”
Castiel wipes more sweat from his brow and continues working. The sun still sits high in the sky, its rays beating down against Castiel’s back. He was smart enough to have put sunscreen on before coming outside, so he’s well protected.
Castiel sighed. “We still don’t have a location or any idea where that woman came from.” He shifted uncomfortably.
Dean’s eyes widened in realization. A lot of puzzle pieces clicked together in his mind. “That’s a really shitty reason to throw someone out.” He huffed. “Cas, look, I get the feeling this is something you’re ashamed of. Fuck that. You’re a beautiful, amazing person. I always knew something was different about your scent, and I love it. I think it’s the best scent I’ve ever smelled. I don’t care if you’re a beta, alpha, omega, or anything else. I just want you.”
Castiel nods. “It’s me.” He smiles and looks at Dean. He throws his arms around his neck and kisses him. He feels Dean’s arms around him and finally feels relief wash over him. This whole mess is over, and he can return to a normal life.
It was a sunny day at the park, and Dean could see the top of Castiel’s head from where the driver had parked. He got Claire out of the car and brought her backpack. He took her hand and led her into the park, walking through the playground gate.
The morning of the company dinner was great. Every once in a while, Luke stayed home from work, and he’d be in a great mood. They were happy and acted just like a normal couple. It was perfect.
They stop for fast food burgers and eat on the road. Sam rants about his classes and his GPA for a while, then starts to get tired from traveling. By the time they arrive at the house, Sam is nearly asleep.
“So you’re just going to kill me? Good luck with that.” Castiel starts throwing punches, the blade Gabriel gave him in hand. He dodges the first few swings from Zachariah, then he takes a few hits. He wipes the blood from his lip and charges forward.
Dean chuckles. “He’s a little dork. Actually, I shouldn’t say little. The kid is six two and still growing. He passed me over the summer.”
Once the song was over, the music got way more lively and everyone started moving to dance or to mingle.
“Cas, I don’t know what’s bothering you, but you’re not taking care of yourself. You don’t have to tell me what’s going on, just let me help you. I brought you food and tea.” Dean stands at the side of the bed and sets the mug on the bedside table.
Castiel sits up and watches as the TV bursts to life with the colors of New York City at night. Announcers that Castiel thinks he’s supposed to know talk about how there’s two minutes until the ball drops.
Dean nods. “You aren’t talking like yourself anymore either. You sound way older, more hardened. It’s not you.”
Dean spots the Waffle House on the left and turns into the parking lot. “Well, I guess I’m finally trying it.”
Everything is quiet, too quiet. Nothing makes a peep in the empty bunker with Sam and Dean as its only occupants. Castiel is off on one of his angel missions. Dean made sure to text him everyday to make sure he was still alive. The only response he usually got to his question of “are you alive?” was a simple “yes”.
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell Michael. I know you’re worried about Dean getting the boot. I can make sure that doesn’t happen...if you make a deal with me.”
Dean shakes his head, struggling to find the words. “If, no, when we do this again, can we go out first?”
Castiel was sitting on the floor in front of the cell, talking quietly with whoever was in it. When he noticed Dean, he stood up. “Hello, Dean. Did you come to meet Jack?”
Dean shrugged. “You were busy with the bakery. We were actively trying to hide it from you too. Nothing against you, we just couldn’t risk anyone finding out about it.”
After a few minutes in the mosh pit, Dean starts to get why people like it. The energy is amazing. Soon, he’s bouncing along with everyone to the beat of a song he’s never even heard before.
Dean ordered a chocolate milkshake after his burger and thanked Castiel for the suggestion. They talked more about plans for the future. Dean shared his interest in engineering, and Castiel urged him to pursue it.
By ten o’clock, Dean was tired and ready for bed. He left Jimmy downstairs and bid him goodnight, retiring to his room.
The shower was lonely. Dean tried not to think about it, but it was hard to think that he’d never shower with Castiel again.
Castiel finishes his breakfast and puts his bowl in the dishwasher. “If you guys need a ride at any point, give me a call.”
“I love you too.” Dean let out a breath that he didn’t know he was holding. “Let’s try the no sex thing. I think it’ll work.”
Thanksgiving break is the first time Dean and Castiel are truly separated. Dean drives all the way to South Dakota to see his brother and family friend, Bobby. Castiel drives back to his parents’ house for the break. All of his extended family is in Illinois, but they don’t travel there for Thanksgiving. It was always a holiday with just Castiel and his parents.
That night, Michael was way more affectionate than usual. He held Dean close as they snuggled in bed, nuzzling his face into the back of his neck.
Castiel lays in his bed that night, staring at his ceiling and being unable to stop thinking about how his hot roommate just kissed him.
For dinner, Dean made beef stroganoff that Jimmy raved over all night. The kids really enjoyed it too. Bath time was easy tonight, and Claire went to sleep at eight-thirty, which was perfect for Dean.
Gabriel sticks his hands in his pockets. “Cas, if you want, I can wipe the memories of your time as an angel. I know all of that must be an emotional burden.”
It took Dean nearly thirty minutes of contemplation to decide what to do. He finally just picked up his laptop and left his bedroom. He drew in a deep breath before knocking on Castiel’s door, rocking slightly on his feet.
The car ride was quiet. Sam was much quieter than usual, staring out the window. It was eerily similar to the way he was acting when he rode with Dean to the airport before he flew to Chicago.
Dean finds himself fighting back tears. “No, no, I don’t want to leave. I’ve never met anyone like you and...I need you. I feel...I feel safe. No one has ever done that for me. You give me hope that one day, I’ll live like you.”
Castiel nodded. “I’ll close all of the blinds. Stay downstairs and away from windows. Don’t go outside, don’t answer the door.” He looked at Dean. “Do you know what your neighbors are?”
Castiel walked back over to the bed and sat down. “Well, as for us, I think we just need to make sure our relationship stays completely platonic. I’m happy with my husband and I don’t want to ruin my marriage. I know he’s not very loyal to me, but I promised to be loyal to him, so I will be. I won’t stop helping you through your heats, since that’s only temporary. I think it’ll be easier once Michael is the one with you during that time.”
“Fun. I won’t distract you anymore then.” Gabriel’s eyes move back to his laptop and he stops talking.
Castiel takes a step closer to him. “I still feel everything, which means I still love you. I still feel all of it. Even with all of these new memories, the best time of my life has been the time I’ve spent with you. I want to make this work.”
“Mmhm.” Gabriel looked between them. “Do you guys have any plans for the future? Anything you want to do? Anything I can help with?”
Dean draws a blank at first, but then his mind goes back to the weeks he’s spent looking at promotions for the event. “I wanted answers. I thought if I came to Pride, I would know if this was me or not. I guess I found what I wanted. I kissed a dude tonight. Probably going to sleep with him, too.”
Castiel emerges from his room to make breakfast. It’s Saturday, so they’re both home and free. Dean usually slept in on the weekends, but it’s already nine am, so Castiel hopes that Dean will come out in the main space soon.
Once Dean was finished and calmed down, things went back to the same sweet mood. They shared a breakfast of water, protein bars, and some fresh fruit Castiel had stored in a lunchbox with several ice packs to keep it cool.
“I’m sure it was. I just wanted to talk about how we want to handle your heat this time around. We can go with the same system as last time, or try something new.”
Luke didn’t acknowledge Castiel in the morning, as per usual. Castiel’s husband wasn’t a morning person. The morning and afternoon were lonely while he waited for the omega to arrive with Gabriel.
Castiel tilted his head. “You haven’t noticed? I think everyone in the station knows by now that we have a weird bond.”
Dean wrapped an arm around Castiel’s waist and held him to his side. He smiled when he saw the mating bite at the junction of the omega’s neck and shoulder. He had a matching one, which he reached up to touch softly. Calling Castiel his mate felt like heaven. To Dean, he was perfect. Their kids were perfect, and their home was perfect.
Jody folded her arms. “I thought for a long time about who it should be, and I feel like there’s only one right answer. We need someone we can trust, so, Dean? Would you take him in?”
“That’s awesome!” Gabriel high-fived Claire and looked over at Jack. He sat down cross-legged and smiled. “You must be Jack.”
“When I went on food runs during your heat I checked on my plants. There’s a large fittonia in there that hates me if I don’t keep the tray underneath it full of water and mist it daily. It probably looks dead right now just to resent me. Drama queen.” He immediately dug into the scrambled eggs. “Thank you for breakfast…and for yesterday. You didn’t have to bring me all of that stuff. That was really kind of you. You even found my heat towels.”
Castiel leads the way to a table and sits down. He picks up the menu from the back of the condiment carrier. “What breakfast foods do you like?”
That night, Dean really couldn’t sleep. Humans were back. Even if it was just one, it was one too many in Dean’s eyes. Whenever he closed his eyes, he could still see his mother crying out before succumbing to the demon blade that was driven into her heart by none other than a human. Dean let out a shaky breath and dragged his hands over his face.
“No! Don’t touch me! Get out!” Dean shouted. His mind was starting to get really cloudy now, and he felt tears forming in his eyes. He glared as Castiel left, only realizing how alone he was once he was gone.
“You too. Night.” Dean let go of Castiel’s hand and stood up, walking upstairs to bed. It felt amazing to get into bed when he wanted to without fear of someone reprimanding him. No constricting arms held him down. He was free.
Dean shrugged. “Might as well get naked. It’ll happen eventually, anyways.” He sat up and pulled his shirt and pants off, tossing them aside. He paused at his boxers when Castiel got up and started picking up the clothes. “Oh. Sorry.”
“I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.” Castiel knelt between Dean’s legs and slid two fingers down his crack and into his hole, checking to make sure he was slick and ready.
Castiel shook his head vehemently. “No, not at all. I don’t think they ever forgave me, but it was four years after that happened that I ended up on the streets.”
“Hm? Yes, I’m fine. Luke went into rut yesterday, and I can only stand it for so long at once. I made it through the wee hours of morning yesterday to just thirty minutes ago. He’s asleep, don’t worry. I didn’t just leave my husband alone during his rut.”
In the middle of the night, Dean shoots awake, which startles Castiel awake as well. He looks up at his boyfriend with half-open eyes, blinking slowly.
Dean looked up just in time to see Michael kneeling in front of him and reaching into his pocket. It was happening…
Dean is quiet for a moment. “Maybe you're right. If you are, I didn’t even know that about myself. I guess it makes a lot of sense.”
Dean took in a breath through his nose as he ate, and suddenly scented something different. When he glanced up, he saw that Castiel looked a little distressed and was eating faster. “You okay, man?”
Michael and Dean were sent to a room with a large couch to wait for the rest of the guests to arrive so they could be announced and walk in to see everyone. Dean was eager to sit. He thought about taking his shoes off, but then decided that he shouldn’t, because if he got relief now, it would hurt more to put the shoes back on later.
Sam seems to listen with interest, eyes curious and waiting for more information. “I think I might do a history and English double major. That would cover everything I could possibly need for law school, and it would look good on my transcript.”
Meg looks over at Castiel and her expression finally softens. She smiles at him fondly. “I know you do, Clarence.”
“Dean, I just need you to trust that I have good reasons for what I do. I do spend my heats alone, for the most part. I don’t stay with my husband 24/7. I stay home alone and Gabriel checks on me before Luke checks on me at night. I won’t ask you to tell me the intimate details of your sex life with Michael once you’re married, and I hope that you can respect that I don’t feel comfortable talking about my sex life. I’m sorry that you felt that I lied to you, that certainly wasn’t my intention, but I need you to acknowledge my boundaries and try not to cross them, okay?”
Dean got into bed, really not feeling tired yet. He wanted to stay up a little later, but Michael seemed to want something to hold while he fell asleep. Dean was practically a teddy bear to him tonight. He laid there, limp, while Michael held him tightly and drifted off to sleep.
Dean coughed a few times. “I’m not sick. It’s my suppressants. I usually take them every morning and every night. I’ve skipped two doses now. Last time I ran out I had a really bad reaction like this.”
“Ah, well just give me a time and day, and we’ll get him here. It sounds like you two are very close.”
“Don’t worry about it. We can plan our date for another night. I would get on the road now. You’re going to hit some really nasty traffic in Atlanta.”
When it dies down, the memories start flooding back. Castiel takes several deep breaths as he starts to remember everything. He remembers the wars, the millennia of human history, his own defiance, and even Gabriel. He has a different face in Castiel’s memories, but it’s him.
Dean walked to the other side of the car and opened the door. “Yeah, this is the one she has. She’s not quite at the height and weight requirement to switch to the booster seat.” He buckled Claire in and shut the door before hopping into the passenger seat.
Dean raises a brow at that. He scoots to the side and comes up on his knees to peer over Castiel’s wing. He finally gets a good look at his face and what he sees shocks him. Castiel’s entire face is beet red. His bent index finger is between his teeth and his hairline is damp with sweat. He looks like he either just had the workout of his life, or…
“No, not at all. Just relax.” Castiel placed his hands on the sides of Jack’s head and closed his eyes, his brows knit together in concentration. His eyes opened and pale blue light shone through them. His hands glowed softly as well.
Castiel tilts his head. “There’s no one in here. Come on, let’s go back to bed.” Just as Castiel turns to walk back to the bedroom, a pot goes whizzing by his head and hits the wall behind him.
“Oh, that’s great.” Castiel walked to the kitchen and made himself yogurt with granola. He looked a little dejected now, his head lower.
Castiel holds a hand out to Dean, ignoring that revelation from Gabriel. “I don’t know what lies ahead, but all I know is that I want you in my life.”
Once everyone was done with breakfast, Dean and Castiel worked together to clean up. While they were washing dishes, Dean reached for the sponge at the same time as Castiel. Their hands collided and immediately pulled back, blushes rising in both of their cheeks. It was quickly becoming obvious that the feelings that they had for each other years ago were coming back with a vengeance.
Dean wrapped his arms and legs around Castiel and held him like a koala bear as he was carried up the stairs. He turned his head and started kissing along Castiel’s jaw with a hum. “What did you think about all of those people looking at me, wanting me?”
Dean took off his work uniform and showered before dressing in a collared shirt and black jeans. It wasn’t his fanciest outfit, but he had made Castiel promise that they wouldn’t go somewhere super fancy, since those kinds of places tended to stress Dean out, even if he wasn’t the one paying.
“It’s just the term that I prefer.” Castiel showed his skill at taking the topic of conversation elsewhere. “Dean said you’re going to college this fall. Where are you studying? What’s your major?”
Dean stares at Castiel for a moment before groaning. “He’s never going to let me live this down when I come rolling up in a Prius.” He sighs before smiling a bit. “Okay, thank you.”
Dean shrugged. “Whatever.” He picked up the two dirty plates. “So, now we have to find this Nephilim? Where do we even start?”
Dean looked the same as before, but definitely older. He had filled out more and even had a little scruff going. He looked good. “What are you doing here?”
Cas meets Dean’s eyes, and his lip quirks up into a barely-there smile. “If no one has ever told you, you are good, Dean. I’m not just talking about what we’re doing now. You are so good. I wonder if I deserve to have this with you.” His words come between panting breaths. “I-I could go on, but it’s getting increasingly difficult to focus.”
While he sits alone in his room, a thud echoes through the house. Castiel stands up from his desk and listens closely. It’s barely four o’clock, so Dean isn’t due to be home yet. No more noises come, so Castiel sits back down. The house isn’t new, so there are bound to be weird noises coming from it.
Gabriel shakes his head. “Zachariah has used that vessel for centuries. He’s always been your professor. The school will notice that he’s missing and will either pass/fail the class or find you a new instructor.”
Dean pouts. “Well I definitely don’t want to do that. We just got reunited.” He smiles. “We’ll be fine.”
Michael nodded, tightening his arms around Dean’s middle. “I’ll do the talking then.” He yawned deeply. “Tomorrow night, we can talk about what we want to do this weekend, before Sam comes to visit. I’ll actually be home this weekend, and you won’t be in heat, so we can spend some more time together.”
The ride back to the house was just as awkward on Dean’s end. He didn’t try to make conversation since Michael was buried in his phone, reading emails or something like that. Michael led Dean back into the house. “Thank you for joining me tonight. Hopefully next time I won’t have to take a business call. If you need help with anything, I’m just down the hall. I’ll see you in the morning if you’re up before eight. I leave for work then.”
“Hey, it’s not your fault. Don’t feel bad about what happened. Let’s just get you home so you can relax.”
At five-ten, five minutes earlier than Dean usually got back, Dean comes busting through the door, eyes wide.
Finally, he leans in and kisses Cas’s lips once, quickly. It’s so brief that it was hardly there. His heart is pounding, but surprisingly, he’s okay.
Meg sits on Castiel’s bed and proceeds to tell him all about everything that’s been going on with her. She has a wide group of friends and loves to talk about them to Castiel, who knows none of them. He’s a good unbiased third party, so he gives good advice.
Dean raises his brows. “Oh. I guess you’ll be able to do that in your head, so he can get to you no matter what.”
Castiel squeezes Dean’s hand and pulls him close. “I’m happy too.” He kisses his boyfriend and hugs him close. “I love you so much.”
Dean slowly closed his hands into fists and gently tugged on the feathers to see what would happen. He grinned as Castiel gasped and bucked his hips up.
At ten o’clock, after some reading, Castiel gets dressed and hits the road. The drive is only about forty-five minutes long, so he’s home before he knows it. He parks in the driveway of his suburban house and carries his bag to the front door. He remembers the spare key hidden under a fake rock by the bushes and grabs it to open the door.
“She’s shy around adults that she doesn’t know. Give her time. She’s not scared of you, she just doesn’t know you well yet. She’ll love you.”
Gabriel smiled. “I like hanging out with him too.” He unzipped the shoulder bag he had. “I actually brought you something. I heard that you like trains, is that right?”
Castiel nods. “As much as I don’t think you’d screw up, I understand that you’re not ready. I’m probably not really ready for a relationship either. I’ve never been in one before, so it’s not my area of expertise.”
Despite his drunken state, Castiel is kicking ass at beer pong. He plays everyone one on one, and the only person to beat him is Meg, who is a stellar player. Castiel isn’t a sore loser, so when he loses, he just laughs and finishes his drink.
Dean had never seen Castiel during this time before. He wasn’t really in heat yet, just bordering on the edge of starting. He was anxious and pacing in the bedroom, chewing his nails. Dean wasn’t sure what to do to comfort him at first. “Do you want to come sit down? You should try to rest up.”
Gabriel hummed. “It’s not easy moving away from what you know into a new place. There’s gonna be some growing pains if you choose to stay. You know you're not being held against your will. You can leave at any point if it’s too much.”
Dean didn’t seem to know how to answer at first. “I kept the plants alive. Haven’t lost a single one. I take care of Claire. We’ve been trying to have another kid for almost a year now. I got some tests done, and everything looks fine, so hopefully soon.”
“Perfect.” Gabriel sighed. “If I had known it was going to be this bad, I would have gotten you out of here before the wedding. I honestly had no idea you were trying to leave, or that Michael was being awful. I’m so sorry.”
Dean kissed Castiel back and ran his hands up and down his back. “I’m proud of you. I promise I’ll take good care of you.”
Castiel took Dean’s hand. “Then you don’t have to today. I’ll extend my stay here. Can you be here Monday with your things? We’ll ditch the phone, I’ll get you a new one. I won’t feel right if I leave you under that roof any longer than I have to.”
Dean tilts his head and approaches the bed. “Can I help? Seems like you wouldn’t be able to reach most of that,” Dean offers, his mouth moving faster than he’s thinking.
“Yeah, I am.” Gabriel opens the freezer and sets out a handle of vodka, Jack Daniels, and takes a case of beer out of the fridge. “We’re drinking good tonight.”
“Hi.” Dean looks at the flag in his hand. “Wait, you were selling these?” Guilt suddenly punches him in the gut. He feels like he’s stolen something from this man. “How much are they? I’ll pay you for this one so-”
Jimmy smiled softly. “That sounds like him. He was always the caretaker sibling. It’s in his genes. Despite being identical, we’re opposites in a lot of other ways. I was a pretty selfish kid, and I was a troublemaker. My room was a mess while his room was pristine. I wish we had stayed together after what our parents did. Maybe neither one of us would have gotten into so much trouble. Then again, Cas never would have met you, and that would be a damn shame.”
“I was a warrior for most of my life. I was trained as a fledgeling. I fought in every heavenly battle and even led my own garrison. All was well until a particularly bad battle. I lost my entire garrison, and I was injured. My right wing, it has a scar, and it’s never healed properly. I can’t fly as much anymore because of it.”
Once Dean’s exploration was done, he started to worry about Castiel again. Was he okay by himself? Did he need food? Water? Dean chewed his lip and thought about going upstairs, but he shook his head. Castiel made it clear that he wanted to be left alone, so Dean would respect that.
“We can. Until we’re ready, let’s just focus on the other things, like how nice it is to be cuddled up here together.” Castiel held Dean a little closer and wrapped his other arm around him.
“Okay. See you downstairs for breakfast.” Dean stepped into the bathroom and closed the door. As he predicted, it took a few minutes to figure out all of the knobs for the shower, but once he did, it felt luxurious. He scrubbed away the sweat and slick residue that still coated his skin from the previous night. Part of him felt sad when he realized he was scrubbing away Castiel’s scent. He wondered if Castiel was sad about scrubbing away Dean’s scent.
The next couple days are tense while Castiel waits for the thirtieth to drive back to Athens. Castiel spends the days with his parents, enjoying their company before he leaves.
Dean led the way out of the alley and looked around the street they were on. He saw a little mart across the street and decided to try them first. He walked inside and asked them if they had seen either the mom or Jack, showing the cashier pictures. The guy shook his head, and they were on to the next store.
“Who’s the sap now?” Castiel grinned, pulling Dean in for a slow, sweet kiss. He brushed his fingers through Dean’s hair and held his lover close. He started moving again, slow and gentle.
Dean shook his head. “I’m going to say this over and over. No, you shouldn’t have. Even under bad circumstances, you got out. You deserved a better life.”
Dean swallowed. “Still, that does nothing but help me in the custody hearings. She’s not even his so he won’t get custody.”
Castiel feels a pit in his stomach form. “No, he didn’t do anything! Please, just leave him out of this!”
“God, it sucked! Both of my brothers suck. I’m glad I don’t have to deal with them much anymore. I’ve been disowned for helping Dean escape.”
Castiel makes a face. “No, of course not. It’s not like this with other angels.” There’s a brief pause. “I’ve only ever had this reaction with you.”
Castiel smiled softly. “Okay.” He laid on his back and pulled his pants and boxers down, sighing in relief when his cock slapped softly against his belly, out of the tight confines of his jeans.
“Someone named Sam has been trying to get in contact with you. I asked the other day and all you said was ‘ew’ so I assumed it was an ex, but he’s calling you for the third time this morning now.”
An officer finally walked in and looked at Michael. “Sir, this is supposed to be an interrogation just for him. You need to step out of the room.”
Dean had a lot on his mind, so it was hard to be fully present for Castiel. He had gone back to Chicago twice already with his lawyer to try and come to an agreement with Michael. It got ugly both times. The poor mediator had his work cut out for him. Michael wanted to leave Dean with nothing, and Dean wanted the money he had been promised back. That sparked Michael to try and get every dollar he had sent to Sam back, an amount that Dean could never afford to repay.
“You just said you spend all day lounging around. Why don’t you go check everything out?” Sam sat up a little more, that curious twinkle in his eyes coming in full force.
Meg crosses her arms. “I’m not mad, but if you lie to me again you’re toast.” She grins, clearly joking.
Dean nodded. “Of course, yeah. Go get some rest. I’ll rest up too. Should I call your regular phone or the burner?”
His heats were just like any other omega’s heats, only with the addition of a knot. It wasn’t easy to manage, but it was doable. His heats only lasted about three days, which was such a relief, given how uncomfortable they were. Sometimes Luke would come in and ask if they could have heat sex, but Castiel always turned him down. He spent five years on the streets terrified of people taking advantage of him during his heat. He only felt safe if he was alone. He still needed people to check on him, and he trusted Gabriel to keep from touching him, so he was allowed in if needed.
Castiel’s eyes were wide when Dean finally touched him. He reached down to hold one of Dean’s thighs, eyes locked on the omega. “Holy shit, Dean…”
Castiel frowned. “He’s just possessive. I don’t really mind it that much. They fade within a couple of days, and his rut ends quickly. It’ll be done by tomorrow morning.” He rubbed his nose and sneezed. “The smell is probably the worst part, but I just shower a lot and that usually resolves it.”
Dean knew he wasn’t supposed to talk, but he didn’t know how Michael was supposed to answer that for him.
A few minutes passed before Anna sent back a short email containing information about Jimmy. All she had was his last known location in St. Louis and his phone number. Castiel pulled out his phone and typed in the number as fast as he could read it. Before he could hit the call button, Dean stopped him.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “I got it for a great price, and it works just fine.” He walked out of the garage and got into his car.
Dean nodded, taking note of the Milton brother’s ages. He knew from Michael’s profile that he was 29, making him about seven years older than Dean.
Dean carefully sat on the bed, mindful of the bedspread that probably cost more than anything he had ever owned. He scooted back until he was next to Michael.
Castiel met Dean’s eyes again. “No, I stood my ground. Gabriel stood up for me too. I just hate the idea of you getting that sick again. It was really scary.”
Jimmy arrived later in the afternoon. Now that it was summer and Castiel was out of his classes, Jack and Claire were both home all day. Jimmy took them out of the house to go get ice cream once he arrived, so now the house was empty.
When he finally came to, everything felt a little more calm, cooler. That certainly had him satisfied for a bit. He let his hips drop to the bed and made a contented noise through his nose. “You’re magical, man.”
Castiel led Dean to a mid-sized sedan with a small u-haul attached to the trailer hitch. He opened the back door and placed Jack in his car seat. “I bought a car-seat that should be the right one for Claire.”
Castiel emerged from the bedroom with Jack to check on the food. “Make sure you eat everything. You’ve mostly eaten candy today.”
“Hunters usually have nothing to lose. They’re old men and women with hardened lives that make them leave peace behind. They’re good at what they do. I had a chance at a different life, one that makes me happy, and I took it. I only hunted for two years of my life, from the age of fifteen to seventeen, but those two years changed me. I’ve seen more than anyone should ever see. I couldn’t save everyone, no matter how hard I tried. If you take on a life like that, you won’t be able to save everyone. People are going to die in your hands, and it’ll stick with you forever. You’re such a happy person, Castiel. You’re throwing that away when you take that responsibility. I won’t be around to watch that happen. My heart can’t take it.” Dean wipes at his eyes. “You mean too much to me for me to watch you harden into someone else.”
Castiel immediately dodges the question. “Of course I like your brother. He’s my roommate and I haven’t asked to move out yet.”
Dean nodded and closed his eyes. He could probably fall asleep right there, but he knew that he needed to stay awake for this discussion. He spent a few minutes getting his mind back online. That had been very intense and new. Once he was ready, he nodded.
Bored of the scenery in Lawrence, he decided to drive down the highway for a little while. There wasn’t much around Lawrence, mostly farms. He drove down roads that he knew, just letting his head clear of everything.
“I just call him that. He’d probably get mad if you call him that, so stick with Sam.” Dean looks around the interior of the car.
“Come on, kiss me where it counts.” Dean pulled Castiel closer and leaned up, capturing his lips in a kiss. His body sang with joy as they reunited like this. “I missed this,” he mumbled against his lips.
“I didn’t know you were already twenty-one, Gabriel.” Castiel stared at the amount of food and suddenly felt a little bad that he didn’t bring anything.
Dean put up a fight when the officers tried to separate the kids from him. He finally relinquished with the promise that two officers would be with them in a separate room while interrogations were happening.
When he got back to the house, he got out quietly, since most of their neighbors would probably be asleep. He kind of hoped Castiel was asleep, since the poor guy didn’t sleep all night.
“You can talk to your sister now. She’s closer to him than you are, and maybe she’ll reach him soon.”
Castiel shook his head. “No, you’re the third, but Michael is convinced you’ll be the last. He was talking about it this morning.”
Dean looks around. “Damn. It really is rush hour. Is this the highway that goes straight through the city?”
Cas walks over to the bed and lies on his back, stretching out like a cat. “You can come sit with me.”
Castiel wakes up the next morning with his face still pressed against Dean’s shoulder. He opens his eyes and rubs them. He sees that it’s fully bright outside, and suddenly his stomach drops. He sits up and starts scanning his hands over the bed to find his phone.
They could smell food around six o’clock. Dean led Claire back downstairs and saw Castiel cooking. Jack was on the floor of the living room, playing with several toy trains. Claire walked over to him curiously.
Luke rolled his eyes. “Please, I pay attention. You were just ready to accept any deal to protect him. The scent that comes from that room is proof enough. You’re emotionally bonded to one another. My brother is just too much of a prude to notice, which makes you lucky. I could go tell him right now, and Dean would be out of here with nothing. His brother would have to drop out of school, and you’d be trapped here. I’m giving you what you’ve wanted for months.”
“You can’t drive one of their cars? What about Uber? Or the driver that picked me up at the airport? What about catching a ride with Gabriel if he’s around?”
Castiel’s birthday is coming up. It falls on October 20th, and he’s about to turn twenty-one. Meg wants big plans, but Castiel prefers to keep his birthday lowkey. As soon as Gabriel finds out Castiel’s birthday is coming up, it’s all over. He goes on about how he’s going to throw a big party at his place and everyone Castiel knows should come. Of course, that wasn’t very many people.
“So, whatcha working on?” Gabriel pulls a lollipop out of his backpack pocket, tears off the wrapper, and sticks the candy in his mouth.
“Jody said she’d take him while we were gone, but she couldn’t keep him there long-term. She said she had enough on her hands with her daughters.”
“Me neither.” Castiel hums and runs his fingers along the surface of the table. “What made you decide to be an engineering major?”
Castiel looked at Jack and back at Dean. “I’m visiting Meg.” He looked up at the girl on the playground. “You have a daughter.”
“Oh yeah,” Sam said. “Dad tried reaching for Dean to stop him and Cas got all intense and grabbed Dad’s arm and just—“ He snapped his fingers.
Cas laughed. “Those aren’t so bad, either. But if we’re going off of purely physical attributes, I’d have to go with your ass.”
“Yes,” Cas answered. “But our friend Benny runs it. He knows far more than either of us about how to run a restaurant. Also about how to cook, although Dean can give him a run for his money on some dishes.”
Cas stepped slightly in front of Dean, but Dean pushed him to the side and marched up to his father. “Get out of my house,” he demanded through gritted teeth, “or so help me I’ll let Cas rip you to shreds.”
Bobby looked between the brothers, a bit nervously, and said, “Uh, well. John seems more manic about this one than I’ve seen in years.”
The moment the door opened, Dean was flying around the corner to see if it was Sam. He beamed when he saw his lanky younger brother carrying a duffel bag into the house, wide-eyed and staring at everything but Dean.
Today was the big day. Sam was here, Bobby was here, and Dean was sitting in a Sunday School room in a massive church, waiting for Bobby to come get him to walk down the aisle. His heart was beating out of his chest. He knew exactly what to do, they had rehearsed it the day before. It just felt so real all of the sudden.
She sighs. “We didn’t want to scare you. To tell you the truth, it scared us. Before we had you, your father and I weren’t religious. We were both agnostic. We didn’t believe the angels when they first arrived, but they gave us signs, little miracles in our lives. Then you came, our biggest miracle. We had been trying for children for seven years, you already know that. Once we had you and we knew angels were real, we started going to church every Sunday to thank Heaven for you.”
Castiel was awarded with a massive divorce settlement and Luke was going to have to pay alimony for the next few years.
Gabriel opens his pantry and starts pulling out food item after food item. He fills a bowl with chips, sets out Chex Mix, crackers and cheese. “Get some food in your system, Cas. I bought you alcohol.”
Dean’s stomach growled and he decided to try and find the kitchen. He walked down the stairs and tried to guess which way the kitchen would be. He heard the sound of metal clanking coming from the right, so he followed the noise through a long corridor. He turned into a large kitchen, where Castiel seemed to be attempting to cook. Judging by the smoke and the frantic waving of a towel, it didn’t seem to be going well.
He kicks with his legs, searching the water for Dean. He doesn’t feel the need to breathe, but he knows Dean will run out of air eventually. Time ticks by as he kicks down deeper into the water. He spots a dark spot in the water off to the side and swims to it. He sees Dean slowly sinking down, completely limp and unconscious. The impact with the water must have been hard enough to knock him out. Castiel grabs him and holds him tightly.
After a quick stop at a fast-food burger place, they hit the road. Dean tried to stay awake, but he was exhausted. He fell asleep about two hours into the ride and didn’t wake up until Castiel gently shook his shoulder.
“They’re not human.” Dean crosses his arms tightly. He looks angry, but he wears his heart on his sleeve. He’s heartbroken.
“Gabriel works in food service. It’s a liability for him to be sick. I’m in charge of three floors worth of employees in that building. It’s a liability if I’m not there. I can quarantine myself in my office and still get my work done, and be there if I’m needed.” Michael sipped his coffee. “I’ll be fine, I promise. I already planned to come home early, so I’ll only be there for about five hours.”
Castiel was practically a zombie in the shower. He was pliant, so he didn’t move much on his own. He looked a little less sad now, but the exhaustion in his body was obvious. He looked like he had stayed up all night.
Castiel starts driving out of the airport. “Um, we shouldn’t stop right around the airport. The traffic should have calmed down some so let’s get to the other highway before we stop. It shouldn’t be longer than half an hour.”
They didn’t read personal vows. It was extremely traditional ‘I do’s’. Dean kind of liked it that way. Having to write vows felt like a lot of pressure, especially in a church full of extremely high-class people.
Dean sat up and took the water bottle, unscrewing the cap and taking a long swig. “Burning up.” He picked up the ibuprofen and took it with a swallow of water.
Dean flipped over onto his stomach and pulled himself up onto his hands and knees. He panted softly, swaying as he tried to come back from that orgasm.
Castiel’s face was flushed bright red, and his lower lip was drawn in between his teeth. “I told you, this is very intimate.”
The woman nodded, and fortunately for Dean, she seemed understanding. “There’s no rush, I was just curious. I’ve heard so much about these new arranged mates and marriages. Back in the olden days, poor Michael would have gotten stuck with whoever our most profitable business partner’s omega child is. I like that there’s an element of choice to it now.”
“We don’t have to do anything until you’re ready. You were willing to wait on me, I’ll wait for you.” Dean offers a small smile.
Dean closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep. Even though he had the ability to  never sleep for the rest of his life, something about the act of it was very calming to him. He fell asleep shortly after he started trying, snoring softly into the pillow.
For the rest of the night, Castiel and Dean freely express their affection for one another. It feels good to do, especially after being separated for several weeks. All of their friends are happy to see them together, finally. That night, once everyone sets up their sleeping bags, Dean and Castiel put their right next to one another and sleep with their fingers intertwined.
The limo stopped in front of the house and the driver let everyone out. Dean glanced at Castiel to see if he would be able to talk to him before bed, but the other omega seemed pretty focused on going upstairs with his husband. Michael was leading Dean towards his bedroom as well, so there wasn’t a chance to see Castiel and provide a better explanation as to why he didn’t join him outside at the dinner.
Dean smiled. “Then let’s do it. We never got a chance to reverse the roles. We were always too tired, and during heat anything involving my dick is just background noise.”
Dean was dropped on his bed and left alone in the room with nothing but a paper bag full of fake knots and lube to satisfy him. Dean clutched his stomach from the pain of the cramps. He groaned and peeled his clothes off for some kind of relief, only to find none. His head was spinning, sweat was pouring down his body, and everything hurt. When there was a knock at the door, Dean quickly pulled a sheet over himself. “H-hello?”
“Then let me help you.” Castiel gets a little more brave and walks all the way up to Dean, taking his hand and squeezing it.
Gabriel takes out shot glasses and lines them on the counter. “Birthday boy goes first. What do you want?”
The man slowly started walking over to them, looking Dean up and down. As he got closer, Dean locked his eyes on him.
Castiel nods. “You’re right.” He picks up his phone and opens up his student portal app. He makes an appointment at health services for first thing the next morning.
Castiel gets up to grab a snack, searching through the two cabinets he had claimed as his own. He pops a few chips into his mouth, leaning against the counters.
Dean puts an arm over Castiel and kisses his forehead. “I’m going to do some research tomorrow and help you get this figured out. It’s going to be okay.”
Castiel nods and holds his hands out. He takes one of the pills with the water Dean brought. “Thank you.”
Dean huffed. “Uhh, I’ve fixed up cars since I was twelve, and started doing it for work when I was 16. My uncle Bobby taught me.”
Dean nodded. “Yeah. You’re the only person I’ve told. I’d prefer if you kept that one secret for now.”
Castiel slapped Dean on the ass playfully and chuckled, moaning when he bottomed out. “Hilarious.” He started to move, and it was fast. After two quick thrusts, Dean put a hand on his shoulder.
Dean felt weird about looking in Castiel’s bedroom, so he didn’t bother. He returned downstairs and sat down on the couch. He yawned, feeling a little tired himself. A nap wouldn’t hurt. He laid down on the comfy couch and closed his eyes, easily drifting off to sleep.
Dean held Castiel a little tighter and kissed him sweetly. He never could have imagined having this life with him after everything. It was hard to imagine their lives back in Chicago. It didn’t feel real anymore. They were supposedly given everything they ever wanted: love, money, every material item they could ever want, but they weren’t free. Their supposed promised land wasn’t a promised land at all.
“For not freaking out when I was. I know what I was saying was scary. You calmed me down a lot just by being calm, so I appreciate it. Also, thanks for the idea to try and help us. I think it’s already working. There’s no pressure. It’s nice.” He paused. “We could even plan something fun for when the week is up.”
Dean chuckles. “I know you offered to pay, but I’ll get my own food. Consider it thanks for bringing me here.”
“Dean, look at me.” Castiel paused, waiting for Dean to make eye contact. “Tell me exactly what you want me to do.”
Castiel sighs. “When I was talking to Dean, I said that I could save people. He told me that a life of saving people would ruin my happiness, because I wouldn’t be able to save everyone.”
Castiel nods. “Same here. I think we’re both going to be exhausted for the next week. That was heavy.”
Cas straddles Dean’s thighs. “I’ll need some prep, so while I do that, I want you to jerk off. You said you’ve never watched gay porn before. Honestly, most of it is shit, so you’re not missing much, but I want you to get the experience of jerking off to a man. Don’t finish or get yourself too worked up.”
Cas lies back down, folding his arms under his head. “I don’t need them to know who I am. I’m just queer and happy. Labels are important because they help new and young queer folks find solidarity. They have a lot of value to some people, and that’s perfectly okay. I just don’t use them much for myself. I don’t want to fit into a mold.”
“Sam used to tell me how you always used to cook for him,” Jess said, turning her bright smile from Cas to Dean while attempting to subtly elbow Sam in the side.
Cas closed his book and stood up from his seat. “I was sorted into Gryffindor on Pottermore,” he told her seriously. “I was hoping for Hufflepuff, but was quite pleased with the results nonetheless.”
“No,” Cas replied, making a smooth exit out of the car. “You’re being ridiculous and I wish to speak to your brother about it.”
Sam shook his head. “Not in so many words,” he said, trailing off as he thought about how the words weren’t even directed towards him.
But Dean seemed to be gone again, making goo goo eyes over at Cas who was valiantly trying to avoid noticing as he checked Dean’s vitals.
John continued, undeterred, “Though, I gotta say. I never knew a siren to stay with their prey for so long. What the hell does he make you do for him?”
you anyway. I don’t always like you. Especially when you’re too reasonable about shit that I want to be unreasonable about.”
“We’ve been living off of takeout for two weeks, Dean,” Cas said, walking by on his way to the coffee machine.
“I love it,” Cas told him. He took the cord and carefully pulled it over his head. He looked down at the vial glowing on his chest and then covered it with his hand. Right over his heart. “Thank you.”
His adversary stood at the lip of the crater. His shape was humanoid, but his limbs were grotesquely elongated and it had two cruel and ragged wings protruding from its own back in a mockery of Castiel’s own.
John closed the door behind himself and walked in. “You said you found out where Dean is?” he asked, ignoring Sam’s comment.
Almost as if on cue, the screen door banged open and a sweat covered Sam stumbled in and sat down at the table.
Dean couldn’t believe what was happening. What the hell had these past months meant to Sam if he was just going to throw it all away at a moment’s notice? He cursed through his gag and tried his hardest to break free before Sam could retighten the ropes. His wrists were chafed to the point of bleedingby now, but he hardly even noticed. He had to get out, he couldn’t let his dad break his bond with Sam, he—
“I didn’t say it was.” Dean shrugged and looked anywhere but at Cas. Was he really trying to prove he was pathetic? “Just, you know, get your adjectives right.”
Ten minutes later Cas unlocked the door and let in the first customers of the day. They had a few regulars there every morning for their decently priced coffee and a muffin and today was no different.
She just laughed and snagged a fry off of his plate. “Like I didn’t know already,” she said popping the stolen fry into her mouth as Dean glared. “You’re very obvious.”
“Real mature, Dean.” Sam gave him a bitchface as he sat down across from him at the Gryffindor table. His blue tie stood out among the sea of red and gold, but his bright pink hair stood out more. “What did you do to my shampoo?”
He spun around to see Dean jogging up to him, waving his precious biology book in the air. Cas felt his face turn crimson and waited for the ground to swallow him whole.
“All dates are study dates to a Ravenclaw,” Dean replied with a wave of his hand. “You’re all a bunch of nerds.”
“That’s stupid,” Sam said. “If he had just told me then we could have done something about it, we could have—“
“You promised you wouldn’t make fun of me!” Dean’s face was flaming by now, his heartbeat in his ears.
.” He ran his hand through his hair a couple of times, making it stand up on end. “What am I supposed to do, Cas?” Dean looked over to him like he was lost, eyes wide and shining with tears. So much like the first time they met.
“The falling,” Dean said, tracing a path from the sky to the ground with his finger, “right.” Maybe he had hit his head as he slid down the wall of the crater. Maybe this was all a dream or a hallucination.
The next morning found Dean out in the junkyard scouring the broken down heaps for any salvageable parts that he could use back home. He’d already found three things on his list by the time Bobby found him.
Cas sat down for third period with his newly returned biology book. He and Dean hadn’t managed to talk during break since Dean had forgotten his math homework at home and had to hurriedly scribble down as much as he could copy off of Cas’. Usually, Cas wasn’t one for cheating, but he figured this didn’t really count since Dean actually had done the homework.
Dean chewed on his cheek as he thought it over. “I don’t like it,” he finally said. “Let’s go back home.”
After that Sam seemed to come back to himself, more so than he'd been since the whole monster debacle took place. Dean couldn't stop smiling. He had his brother back, he had the best boyfriend in the world, and his mom surprised them all with a cherry pie. It was pretty much one of the best days ever. Even after Sam saw Cas' hickey and started teasing them while simultaneously making gagging sounds.
He crashed through what felt like a ceiling, sending chunks of blue tile scattering to the blazing forest fire down below. On the other side of that ceiling, they were weightless.
Dean just rolled his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Just shut up about it, alright? We have quidditch practice.” He began walking towards the door, Cas hurrying to catch up.
Mary and Dean both glanced at Sam who was nibbling on a piece of pizza crust with his knees pulled tight to his chest, glazed eyes resting on the television screen.
Sam practically flew into the dirt lot, skidding to a halt next to John’s pick-up truck. Cas was already jumping out of the car before it came to a complete stop, his wings tearing his shirt to shreds as they burst from his back.
“Don’t get used it,” Jo told him. “You just sort of look like you’re about to puke and even I’m not that heartless.”
“Great,” Cas said with one last smile and sauntered over to where the rest of the actors were taking their place on set.
Dean opened and closed his mouth several times, before coming out with, “Fine. But I’m going with you.”
Dean nodded. “Friday,” he agreed, slowly backing away and towards his next class. He ran into a chair and nearly tripped, barely managing to not fall flat on his ass. “Right, uh—right,” he said, pushing the chair away but not taking his eyes off of Cas. “I’ll pick you up at seven?”
Sam was debating whether he should go to the bathroom and try to wash his eyes out with every last ounce of soap in the bunker, or just go all in and gouge his eyes out with whatever was on hand in the kitchen. In the end he decided to get a cup of coffee and try and forget the last ten minutes. For the first time, he was really envying Dean’s short term memory loss.
Sam shifted in his seat and threw another glance out the window before turning back to Dean. “Okay,” he said, and then started his story.
Gingerly, he pushed himself up and eased his legs over the side of the couch. He kept his left leg as straight as he could. The doctor had warned him that it was a bad sprain and the slightest bit of strain could cause some serious damage.
“You have a good memory,” Gabe said, eye twinkling a little menacingly. “So you’ll remember what else I said that night.”
Dean snorted and shoved at Cas as much as he could. “Well, thanks for that assessment, Cas, but I’ve really got to get going.” He gave up again with a sigh. “If you let me out of bed right now I’ll have time to suck you off before work.”
“Whatever,” Dean said. “There’s no room in my car for more than you, though, so you’re going to have to take it up with Meg.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Big brothers don’t actually know everything, Dean. If Sam says he saw something, then I’m inclined to believe him. He’s not exactly prone to bouts of hysteria.”
Charlie just laughed. “He’s just totally horrified that I’m telling you,” she said with a glance back at Dean who, she could see even from this distance, had a bright red blush covering his entire face, which he was still trying to hide. “But I’m sorry, I couldn’t take the barely missed stares of longing anymore. It had to end.”
Then, what—uh—“ Dean cleared his throat and purposely lowered his voice. “What do you think the problem was?”
Cas kept his eyes peeled for any type of movement through the rubble that wasn’t a flickering flame. It was why the blow to the back of his head came as such a shock.
“No problem, Cas,” Jo replied. “But know we’re expecting this level of dedication to our own birthdays.”
Cas snorted. “Okay, but you’re coming up with the excuse for why you ran away like you spotted a velociraptor in the kitchen.”
Cas pushed Dean away and stood up, trying to readjust his clothes and pat down his hair to make himself look more presentable. "Sorry, Sam," he said. He cleared his throat. "Your brother makes it quite easy to get carried away."
Dean pulled over to the side of the road and put the impala in park. “Please?” he asked, reaching out and taking Cas’ hand in his own.
“This book says a blade dipped in holy water will destroy anything evil,” Cas said. “I’m sure it could work on the monster.”
Dean leaned down and kissed him. “Can’t believe you ruined my big romantic gesture,” he said when they broke apart, keeping his face hovering an inch away from Cas’. “I got you roses and everything. Now what are we going to tell our kids about this, huh?”
Cas’ frown deepened but he followed in his husband’s wake. “Fine,” he said. “Then what do you suggest we do? Your father doesn’t seem the type to wait around. And you know he won’t hesitate to kill us.”
Sam began peeling the edge of the label of his beer with a thumb, avoiding Bobby’s guilt tripping look. “Yeah, uh, sorry about that, Bobby. I just… I guess I was just trying to get away from the whole hunting thing.”
Dean shook his head and went into his office. He dropped his stuff off at his desk and spared a glance at the pile of applications on his desk before he stripped his jacket off and grabbing the jumpsuit he always kept in his office to change.
Dean shrugged and closed the trunk. He leaned against it as he watched Cas locking the door to their house. “Hey, Sammy…”
“You just want me to take my shirt off,” Cas grumbled, but he stood and pulled his shirt off obediently. Two large and leathery wings unfolded from his back and Sam felt his jaw drop open. If this had been a cartoon he’s pretty sure his eyes would be popping out of his head.
His mother’s smile softened slightly, but she didn’t otherwise acknowledge his lie. “My flight leaves early tomorrow morning, so why don’t I take you out for a nice dinner before I drop you off tonight.”
stupid. Cas had come up and told him he was leaving, because, of course he was. Cas was always going to leave. Dean was just stupid enough to think that because he’d stayed so long this time that maybe he wouldn’t. Like two weeks could really make that big of a difference.
The desk he had been sitting at toppled over as Dean shot up to face his best friend. “Cas!” he squeaked, backing up a few paces. “I—what are you doing here?”
“Cas—just—stop!” he finally shouted. Cas finally relented and stood there seething as he glared at John.
Cas just raised his eyebrows and Dean noticed how close they had gotten to each other. Not that they hadn’t ever had a friendly tussle like this before, but it was a little different now that Dean was allowed to fantasize about the lips currently pressed against his palm pressing against his lips. He dropped his hand quickly and took a step back, jostling a group of dancers behind him. But Cas stepped right back into his personal space.
“Whoa, whoa, Sam,” Jess said, grabbing his shoulder and forcing him around to face her. “You can’t blame yourself for something like that. You were just a kid—“
“Okay, you’re right, okay,” Dean said, taking a huge gulp of air and flexing his chest out before letting the breath out and deflating. “I can’t do this. Do it for me?” he asked hopefully.
“Cas,” Dean sighed. “Remind me how much I like it here. Remind me that I don’t want to have to move.”
“What?” Cas asked, pulling away enough so that Dean could see the shocked look on his face. “You started that!”
“That’s very admirable, Dean,” Cas told him softly. “But he’s not seven anymore. He’s asking you for the truth and he’s old enough to handle it.”
Dean’s eyes widened and he looked the inch or two down at Cas’ strained features. Well, he can’t say this is how he pictured his Thursday night going, but what the hell.
“Idjit,” came the reply. “When you first called me and told me you’d gotten married a year after you left your daddy, I thought you’d gone nuts. Not to mention all that lovey dovey shit you guys do whenever you’re in the same room.”
“Cas, look,” Dean pleaded. “I’m not saying that I don’t trust you with all of this, I’m only trying to say that I like it here. I like living here and I don’t want to move and start over, okay? So of course I trust you, Cas. But if you’re found by hunters then that’s our only option.”
A smile grew on Cas’ face. He walked over to Dean and took him by the upper arm. “Like this.” Cas closed his eyes and put a little effort behind the thought. When he opened his eyes he was met with a breathtaking sight.
“That thing has your head all warped,” John sighed, pausing in his painting to look up at Dean sadly. “I’m breaking your bond.”
“I’m breaking the bond that thing has with him,” John said. “After that Dean’ll snap out of this. Don’t you want him to be free?”
“Hey, man!” Dean nervously ruffled a hand through his sweat damp hair to try and make it more presentable, but to no avail. “I didn’t even hear you come up.”
Fortunately, no one jumped out of any hiding spots yelling, “Psych!” so Cas let himself entertain the possibility that this was real. That Dean had actually meant the things that were written in his handwriting. Most were unfinished sentences, trailing off with unused potential. Some were complete sentences with words crossed out here and there. On the whole it looked like the longest rough draft to a single question he’d ever seen.
He could hear Cas heave a sigh behind him, but he still refused to turn around. If Cas wanted out then he had to respect that Dean wouldn’t watch him go. Not again.
“She’s introducing us to her new girlfriend. We shouldn’t be so disrespectful as to make a bad first impression.”
“You can’t laugh or anything, got it?” Sam told him in his best threatening voice. He even wagged a threatening finger.
Cas narrowed his eyes and opened his mouth to respond in the negative before he realized that Dean was once again trying to brush off his show of emotion with a hyped up sense of masculinity. “Apologies,” Castiel lied instead. “It was one of the earlier batches.”
Dean slid his window open as silently as he could. His mom was in her room, supposedly sleeping, but Dean knew she was awake. Her voice floated underneath his door, angry and tired and scared. Dean couldn’t make out any of the words, but the tone told him she was talking to his dad. Usually he’d try to sneak closer and get a better scope of the conversation, figure out if he needed to comfort her or leave her be, but not tonight. He had a job to do.
“I don’t know,” Dean said. “That’s what he said, but I believe him. I mean, all the kids that have disappeared have seen the monster, right? They were all there.”
Dean and Cas didn’t have fifth or sixth period together, so they were forced to part after the lunch bell rang, Dean following Charlie, Cas following Jo.
“Well not all of us can have our best friend set our schedule,” Gilda told her. “Now come on, sweetheart, I have to be up at five tomorrow.”
“Why does Jo owe her ten dollars?” Cas asked as the two of them finally entered the hallway where their classes were held.
The longer they stayed like that, the heavier the air between them felt. Things were shifting, subtly, but steadily. They were headed for something.
“We can just say you wanted to look nice for the whole dinner with the family thing. My house has air conditioning. You’ll be fine.” Dean added his most charming smile to really sell it.
“Oh Dean,” Charlie said, patting him on the cheek. “My beautiful but simple best friend.” Dean scowled and batted her hand away, but she continued, “I truly think this is the best idea you’ve ever come up with. I mean, if I was that obsessed with honeybees and you asked me to the dance like that, I’d say yes for sure. Even though you’re a dude!”
Cas just laughed. “Aw, don’t be like that, my love. Simba was fierce, too. Adorable, but fierce. Just like you.” Cas pinched one of Dean’s cheeks.
With a frown on his face, Dean tried finding something to dislike about Bobby’s plan, but it didn’t work. Instead of acknowledging it, however, he merely continued to allow himself to be led to the school.
Cas huffed in annoyance and looked down at his sweater. “It is a ridiculous notion, but I quite enjoyed the story nonetheless.” He cast a small smile down at the cartoon reindeer with his glowing nose.
But his older brother just slowly raised a forkful to his mouth and chewed obscenely with the sounds to match. Sam looked to Cas for help, but he was too busy smiling and blushing over Dean’s antics. If Sam wasn’t so terrified of the stories about Azkaban he would have throttled the both of them with their own ties. Instead he kicked Dean under the table.
“Good,” Bobby grunted. “I’d hate for you to get out of the life only to be killed by overworking yourself.”
And he was. Ansem lifted his head to look at them. Unlike Ava, his movements were slow, and he lifted a hand and pointed behind them.
Silence stretched out between them, but Dean didn’t recoil from Cas’ touch, which he took as a victory.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, of course.” He bit his lip. “It’s just a lot different than I expected it to be.”
Dean looked down at his bright red sweater with an almost neon green Christmas tree covered in what looked like small beads in place of the lights, and then back up at Sam. “What’s wrong with what I’m wearing?” he asked.
They ate sandwiches that Dean had prepared for them (turkey, lettuce, and tomato from Dean’s own garden) and played footsie under the table until it was time for the afternoon crowd. Cas smiled through that rush, too, even though he burned himself on a tray of snickerdoodles he had mistaken for the cooled sugar cookies.
“Flying should be instinctual,” Cas said, turning to face Dean who Cas could now see had his eyes squeezed shut. Cas couldn’t help but to let out a chuckle. “Dean,” he said, giving his boyfriend a nudge.
Mary sighed and nodded. "Thank you for taking care of him last night. You're a pretty good big brother, you know that?"
The four of them screamed as the monster came at them, running backwards and tripping over themselves to try and get away.
“Did you two have a good time?” Cas asked the girls, still gripping Dean’s hand tightly as they made their way outside to wait for their parents to pick them up.
The pair were led to a table at the back of the restaurant. Dean stared at the leather-bound menu and shifted in the fancy, padded seat. Michael took the seat opposite him and opened his menu. He was about to speak when his phone started buzzing. “Hm, I need to take this. If I’m not back in time, get me a glass of cabernet and the beef bourguignon.”
The officer stared for a moment, searching for a lie. “Okay. I’m very sorry this has been happening to you. We’re going to gather evidence against Michael for making a false call to us. Your friend is in a holding cell, but given that he gave a testimony identical to yours, it’s enough grounds to let him go. We have no evidence to arrest him. Thank you for speaking up. We can get you a protective order against your husband so that he can’t bother you anymore.”
Dean nods against Cas’s hand. “I am. Anyone that would have objected to my sexuality is far gone from my life.” Memories of his father calling him gay for wanting what was considered a “girl’s toy” from the store flash in his mind. He can’t even remember the last time he spoke to John.
The dark-haired alpha turned away from the light-haired alpha and laid his eyes on Dean, looking him up and down. He walked over and held out a hand. “Hi, I’m Michael.”
When he followed Michael downstairs, he really didn’t expect to see Gabriel sitting at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee. It seemed that Dean wasn’t the only one who questioned his presence.
The rest of the night went off without a hitch. It didn’t go super late into the night, so by 10pm, everyone was heading home. Michael led Dean out to the car that would drive them home.
“I don’t want him taking anything that dulls his scent. We’re supposed to be getting to know each other, and if I can’t scent him fully, that isn’t going to work.”
Castiel was very willing to answer Sam’s questions, and seemed to enjoy it. “It’ll be a year soon. I’ve been married for three months.”
Gabriel leans forward and grabs Castiel’s wrist, pulling him into the apartment. The inside of the apartment is the last thing Castiel expects. From knowing Gabriel, he expected the place to look like the inside of a frat house, complete with panels of beer boxes taped to the walls. Instead, he finds a modernly decorated apartment with chic furniture and a few houseplants scattered around. The balcony has nice furniture on it, and the doors are open, allowing a gentle fall breeze to make its way into the apartment.
Dean stared at the crowd as he was tied down. There were at least a dozen people who had turned their attention to them. He squirmed a bit to test the bonds, finding himself completely pinned down. It made his face and stomach heat up with arousal. “They’re all looking at me now.”
Together, they all walked out to the street where the parade would come by. They picked a spot on the sidewalk to stand and watch. Claire was a parade fanatic, as they learned at Disney World about a year ago. Jack got a little nervous with all the loud noises, but the bright colors were fun to him and he was happy as long as he was near Castiel.
“Easy, you’re alright. Just relax. If you’re thinking too hard about it, it won’t happen. It feels good, right? Just think about that. It doesn’t matter if you come right now. We have time. I know you’re not too feverish.” Castiel placed the back of his free hand on Dean’s forehead. “Just as I thought, nothing to worry about. Uncurl your toes.”
Castiel feels his body beginning to succumb to sleep. He stares out the window as Dean drops off each of their friends at their respective homes. The purr of the engine starts to lull Castiel to sleep, so by the time they arrive at the house Castiel is pretty out of it.
“Very much so. It’s lovely.” Castiel notices that Dean is going to sleep with a hand under his pillow. Part of him wonders if he keeps something under there, but given that Dean hasn’t said anything about it, he assumes it’s nothing.
When Castiel goes to bed that night, all he can think about is Dean, his hair, his smile, his laugh, and everything else that makes Castiel feel weak in the chest.
Dean stood up and led Jack to the next door, knocking before entering. “Hey, can the human sit in here with you?”
He thought about the offer to explore the house, but couldn’t bring himself to leave the room. He just needed to absorb that he would be sleeping here for the foreseeable future, at least until the wedding. He laid down and took a deep breath.
Castiel closed his textbook. “I’m about done for the night. It’s still only 9pm. I usually have a glass of wine and watch a TV show. You’re welcome to join me.”
Castiel shook his head with a sigh. “I’m so sorry you had to go through that. Both of you deserve better.”
“That’s to be expected. My wings really aren’t supposed to be in this plane when I fly. Don’t worry about how many I lose, I have plenty.”
Castiel kissed Dean’s forehead. “I knew that freaking out would only make things worse,” he hummed. “But, I don’t think we should plan anything. If we end up needing more time, we’ll both feel pressure to do something we’re not ready for. I think we need to commit to at least a week of nothing, and then feel it out from there.”
Castiel looks at Dean and considers telling him the truth, that he’s hearing voices. Fear bubbles up in his stomach and begs him to stay quiet. Dean will think he’s insane if he tells the truth. Castiel swallows hard. “It just hurt. A lot.”
He ventured towards the back of the house, looking out at the garden. He remembered seeing a bunch of windows in a room, which he found to the left. He saw a room stocked to the brim with houseplants. Vining plants trailed along the walls and ceiling, twisting into patterns. Large, leafy plants stood tall against the walls. There was a comfortable looking couch and a plush rug in the center of the room. Dean would hazard a guess that Castiel decorated this room. He sat down on the couch and simply enjoyed the view of all the plants.
He startled when a hand grabbed his wrist, but when Dean turned to see Castiel, he relaxed. “Hey, man. I’ve been looking for you.”
Dean dropped his eyes back down to his plate, letting his fork bounce in his grip. “Maybe you’re right.” He sighed.
“Uh, he was really caring. From day one he was trying to make sure I was okay and making the right decision. Super secretive. I knew nothing about him for a long time. Slowly, he trusted me and told me, but he still hid a lot from me. It was all to protect me, so I don’t blame him. He’s way more confident now. He looks powerful when he walks.”
Dean thought for a moment about how much he had calmed down with Cas around, until his body simply gave out, of course. “If I was able to y’know, help myself during my heat, but I just needed someone else there to calm me down, would that work?”
With a shake of his head, Cas leans forward a little. “I know what you’re trying to say, and I appreciate the sentiment.” He closes his eyes. “I’m imagining what it’s going to be like when you’re inside me. You’re big, so the stretch will be nice. What I’m most excited about is watching you come undone. I’m going to take you apart and put you back together again.”
Castiel buried his nose in Dean’s neck and took in a deep breath of his scent. “I don’t know if I have time to rest. It’s coming fast.”
“I’m not going to make a promise I’m not sure I can keep,” Cas told him, turning fully to face him. “If he tries to hurt you again I will not stand idly by.”
“I’m sorry, Cas,” he said, voice cracking. “Fuck, baby, I’m so sorry.” He leaned his forehead against the cool steering wheel.
“Afterwards would you like to set the locker room on fire?” Cas asked him, his tone utterly serious.
They were handed two tickets upon their arrival, one as a pizza voucher, the other for a raffle to win one of the door prizes. Spice Girls played over the stereo system and Dean caught Jo nodding along even though she claimed to not like the band. (Charlie had definitely accidentally let slip that she and Jo had choreographed a whole dance routine to “If You Wanna Be My Lover.”)
, he wanted to repeat again but thought it might come off a little too offensive. Dean didn’t know what to think.  Was star really so much weirder than alien? He debated for a moment before deciding that, honestly, it kind of was.
“There’s the Sammy I know and love,” Dean said, pointing at Sam’s bitchface with a forkful of eggs. He went through half his plate before he stopped to look at Sam again. “I thought you wanted to have breakfast with me,” he pointed at Sam’s empty plate, “not stare at me while I eat mine.”
Castiel cracked one eye open to see his oldest brother, Gabriel, grinning down at him. “Not too bad, considering.” Considering his head felt like it had been stuffed with firecrackers and they’d all gone off at once.
Dean and Cas were already sitting in the Impala by the time Sam got there, speaking in low voices—and was that—did Dean just giggle? Sam really did not want to know. He’d been woken up by their nighttime escapades one too many times to try and pry when the two were looking at each other like that.
“Oh, so accidents do happen,” Cas said. “From the way you’ve been acting you’d think I was just incompetent.”
They stayed one night in the fanciest hotel they could find where they ordered shrimp cocktails and champagne from room service just because they could and left the next day to spend a few days in their cabin.
Dean nodded. “We did. He’s probably still staring out of his dumb window. I seriously think that’s all he’s done for the past week straight.”
“Yeah, my jacket,” Dean replied easily, slinging it around Cas’ shoulders. His eyes lit up as he took in the sight. “Maybe you should keep it,” he added, licking his lips.
“Yeah?” Dean asked. “So how long has this,” he gestured his hand between the two of them, “been going on?”
Cas narrowed his eyes in a squint and turned to look at Dean. Dean had made them watch the movie in question two weeks prior. Perhaps this had been the point all along? “I don’t know what you mean. I’m not living the same day. If anything, you are the one living the same day over and over.”
“I would very much like to know how your father got a hand on the Sword of Bruncvik,” Cas said, resting his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“She always came into Gabe’s shop with another girl. And I once caught them kissing out back near the dumpsters. It was pretty gross.”
Dean kept chuckling to himself as he went about looking for the rest of the things on his list. Once he’d finished and wandered back to the house, Cas was up and sitting at the dining room table nursing a cup of coffee and looking like he wished he could inject caffeine straight into his bloodstream.
“Yeah, well, they didn’t have much to go on. You’d disappeared by then. New number, new name. They didn’t have anything to go on.”
Gabriel reached them before Mary did, with a broken, “Baby bro?” A gurney was hot on his heels and two EMTs carefully lifted Cas from Dean and Max and wheeled him towards an ambulance. Dean tried to follow but was caught up in a bone crushing hug by his mom who haltingly told him between sobs that he was grounded for the next fifty years for sneaking out.
The next day, Castiel was quiet, but present. He didn’t talk more than he had to, but he still had small conversations with Dean over breakfast, lunch, and eventually dinner. Gabriel seemed to help him open up a little more. From what Dean could tell, Cas had told Gabriel about contacting his siblings and how poorly it went with Jimmy. Dean was glad Castiel had Gabriel now. As weird as the guy was sometimes, he was caring. He looked after Dean and Castiel like an older brother.
Castiel shrugs. “Well, I can’t get pregnant so…” He immediately regrets saying that and his eyes go wide.
“Hopefully we don’t have to do that again.” Castiel looked down at the sheets, losing eye contact with Dean.
Things got harder when Dean’s heat started. He knew Michael wouldn’t want to be anywhere near Dean, so he would have to go through it alone. Early in the morning, Castiel got up to make himself some coffee. When he stepped out of his room, he heard Michael’s bedroom door open. He frowned as he watched the alpha just dump Dean into the other bedroom before retreating without a word.
Dean left the house and locked the door behind both of them. As he walked out into the garage, one of his neighbors stopped in front of his house, on a morning jog.
“Even give up being an angel? Being immortal? Look, I get it. I’d be torn too. I just need to know what you choose. I can’t sit around forever and just hope that you’ll stay. It hurts too much. It’s killing me right now.” A tear rolls down Dean’s cheek and he hastily wipes it away.
Luke glared, because he knew he lost this argument. He moved a few feet away from Castiel on the bench seat, too angry to be near him.
Dean chuckled. “You’ll get used to it. C’mon, Michael’s at work so it’s just me, Cas, and Gabriel here right now.” He led Sam into the kitchen. “This is Sammy.”
Castiel looked over at Dean while he was in the middle of fanning the smoke away from the smoke detector and to an open window. “I forgot about my casserole.”
The door opened and Castiel walked inside with a clothing bag draped over one arm. “Hello, Dean. I have your suit for dinner tonight.”
“Relax. You’re all coiled up. Find a good pace and just let it build. You’ll get there, I promise.” Castiel’s was a little deeper than usual, and it sent shivers up Dean’s spine.
Dean even had a thought about what it would be like if he had a kid with Michael down the line. Castiel seemed like someone who would be really good with kids, so it was safe to assume he’d be helping Dean with the kid all day. Despite some of Gabriel’s inappropriate remarks, he seemed like the kind of guy to be a really cool uncle that kids adore.
Castiel starts to drive home, then the anxiety hits. He feels a pit growing in his stomach and his heart starts beating faster. His head feels heavy and his hands tingle slightly. He pulls into a gas station parking lot and takes a big deep breath. It isn’t often that his anxiety flares up like this but it always happens at the worst times.
Castiel pulled his eyes away from Dean and started slowly retreating up the stairs to his room. Dean waited until he heard the door click before walking to the kitchen. He found a reusable grocery bag and filled it with water bottles and protein bars. On his way up the stairs and down the hall, he saw the linen closet. He opened it and looked for the least fancy towels. Surprisingly, there were a few older towels. Maybe these were for Castiel’s heats. Dean put a few in the bag and carried it to Castiel’s room.
His outfit is a force to be reckoned with. He’s in a rainbow crop top and cut-off denim shorts. He has on white high-top vans with rainbow laces. He has a backpack on with crocheted flags hanging off of it.
That night, Dean bandaged a particularly bad bite on Castiel’s shoulder. Since Castiel had only been with Luke for a year, this was the fourth rut he’d seen. This was the first time Luke drew blood.
The voices start to get to Castiel during spring break. He locks himself away in his room for an entire day and holds his head in his hands. He doesn’t eat all day. He wills that the voices calling to him to come home will shut up. He cries for a while, wondering what went wrong with him. Surely once someone finds out that he’s hearing voices he’ll be locked up in a psych ward forever.
Castiel left the room and retreated upstairs to his bedroom. Dean sighed and laid back down on the couch, running his hands over his face. He could go back to sleep, but after checking the time, he decided he needed to wake Claire up. Too long of a nap and she’d have trouble sleeping tonight.
“Yeah.” Dean’s eyes slip closed as Cas leans up and kisses him. This time, it’s a proper kiss. They stay connected for some time, hands beginning to slide over one another. The kiss becomes more frantic until Cas suddenly breaks it off.
Cas walked out the front door as quietly as possible. The car was there, and he gave the driver Meg’s address. As he rode away, he looked back at the house with vitriol. He hoped with every fiber of his being that Dean didn’t take this too hard. There was no going back or seeing him ever again.
Gabriel got home from work at his usual time, and Castiel wanted so badly to tell him what happened, to explain everything. Gabriel was probably the only one who could fix this now, but it was too risky. If Luke found out that Gabriel knew, surely the deal would be off, and Dean would get sent home. Instead, Castiel lied. He hated how good he was getting at it.
Dean’s mouth closes and his shifts, slowly waking up. He opens his eyes and looks up at Castiel. “You watching me sleep?”
Michael shook his head. “I guess not. Let’s just go to bed.” He waited for Dean to leave before putting his own pajamas on.
“I just can’t, okay? It’s too risky, and you’re getting married soon. We might as well cut the cord before this gets too big.”
Dean knew there were plenty of relationships with two alphas or two omegas. It was becoming more commonplace now and more widely accepted. That being said, Dean had never had feelings for an omega before. He was attracted to alphas and betas, dudes and women. It didn’t matter as long as the person fit into those categories.
If he were back in Chicago, he’d be with Michael now. They wouldn’t talk much, just sit near each other and do their own thing. They weren’t very intimate, and sometimes Michael would just vent all of his frustrations to Dean and then immediately go to sleep.
Castiel looks out at the buildings in front of them and closes his eyes to feel the breeze on his face. “You have too. That internship is going to be great.”
“Okay, then let’s do this: I’ll tell you something about me, and then you tell me something about yourself.”
Michael shakes his head. “After I heard the story from Gabriel, I planned on taking out Zachariah and Naomi myself. The experiment was conducted right under my nose and I didn’t notice. That’s entirely my fault.”
“Yeah, just to pick up Claire from school and then come to the park. Someone else drives me. It’s nice to get out.”
Dr. Barnes smiled and nodded, writing something down on her clipboard. “Okay, make sure that your temperature is monitored regularly, and if something’s not working, come back in so we can make sure you’re okay.”
“Yeah, but I’m so tough that being emotionally vulnerable is too hard so I constantly push you away, so we never get together.”
Gabriel was the first to look up and give Sam a crooked grin. “Heya, kiddo. Sorry I couldn’t make it to the airport. I was supposed to be the one to pick you up, but I’ve caught the plague.”
Dean kept his eyes averted from Castiel for a few more seconds before finally meeting his gaze. His eyes were sad, and he looked broken. “I don’t know…”
Castiel puts a hand on Dean’s chest to get the water out of his lungs. Dean’s body jerks and he coughs up a bunch of water, sucking in several deep breaths. “Oh thank god.”
Castiel nods and takes Dean’s hand. “That’s okay. We can just act like we did before we were together and it’ll be fine. Do you need to pick him up at the airport?”
When Dean arrived back at home, he saw Gabriel’s car parked in the driveway. Dean got out of the car, thanked the driver, and walked inside.
Dean had never had duck before, and it sounded good. He kept looking back at the duck confit and eventually decided to get that for himself to be adventurous. Maybe Michael would think Dean was more cultured for choosing duck over the other meat options. God, what was he doing?
Gabriel came to visit right after the divorce, excited to see Castiel again and to meet Jack for the first time.
Dean looked around inside. “Yeah, but this is where they came from. You going to do that angel spidey sense thing?”
Castiel takes in a deep breath and lets it out slowly. “I think I’m going to talk to Meg tomorrow too. I think she’d understand.”
Castiel starts moving them into the bedroom, taking small steps that push Dean backwards. He knows where this is going, and now, it feels right. His bond with Dean is the strongest it’s ever been, and the desire is strong too. It courses through Castiel like the very blood in his veins.
Dean had no idea how long he was out. When he woke up, something was on his face, covering his mouth and nose. He heard faint beeps from monitors and angry voices from a distance. When he opened his eyes, he saw white walls and a chair occupied by a familiar head of golden hair. He felt his face and found an oxygen mask there.
Dean looked around and his jaw dropped slightly. The room was massive, the centerpiece being a lush king-sized bed with a wine-colored bedspread. A dresser sat between two large windows and a door opened to a large walk-in closet. Another door led to a white marble bathroom. Dean had his eyes on the big, clawfoot tub.
Luke’s eyes finally moved to Gabriel and he growled at him. Dean thought that would be the moment that he’d leave, but he heard a growl from his left and saw Sam growling back. Luke’s head snapped back to Sam and he took several large steps towards the table.
Sam let out a sigh of relief. “Okay, well I’m glad to know you’ve just been getting railed all week instead of being dead.”
Castiel shook his head. “No one told me anything. I could only assume you started them since your heat hasn’t come back.”
Castiel nods and takes his spot across from Gabriel. They make eye contact and hold their balls up. “Eye. To. Eye,” both of them recite before throwing their balls at the same time. Castiel’s ball sinks into one of the cups on the right and he grins, turning to Dean. “We get to go first.”
His eyes snap open when he hears a moan from the end of the bed. His gaze locks on Cas, and suddenly he’s one thousand times more turned on than he was before. He can’t see what Cas’s hand is doing behind him but imagining it is almost just as good. He strokes himself a little faster, but not too fast as to get too close.
“I was scared. I thought I’d get tossed in the loony bin if I told anyone.” Castiel’s grip lightens as he calms down.
Dean does everything he can to help Castiel when the pain starts, but Castiel still tells him nothing about the voices. Dean is his caring self every time. He lays Castiel down and keeps him from falling or hurting himself on accident. When it’s over, Dean brings Castiel a glass of water and holds him until he calms down.
“No, but you weren’t honest with me. When I offered to help during your heats I didn’t mean return the favor of what you did to me if you didn’t want me to. When I started my heat, you came in and out of my room to check on me and even ran a bath for me. You know I’d do the same for you, right?”
“I think you made the right choice there, given your situation. Have you ever sought out someone to help you through a heat, so you could stop the suppressants?”
Dean walks up beside Castiel, watching him work. He doesn’t say anything for a while, which prompts Castiel to raise an eyebrow at him.
Castiel turned around and chuckled softly at the state of Dean’s tie. “Here, allow me.” He stepped forward and took Dean’s tie, expertly tying it with long, delicate fingers. Dean nearly drooled at how close the other omega’s hands were. His scent was there and stronger than before. Dean resisted the urge to lean forward and scent him.
“You’re nothing more than a petulant child who wants his way! This pain you feel, it’s only because you disobey. If you fall in line, I can take that pain away from you.” Zachariah swings his arm and manages to land a cut on Castiel’s cheek with the tip of his blade.
“Well, you did just stop suppressants and have your first heat in years. Your hormones are probably all over the place. It’s okay, I get pretty hormonal during my heats, hence why I was so grumpy when you saw me yesterday.” Castiel ate the last of his bacon. “Let’s just put it behind us. I’ll introduce you to my houseplants.”
He walked over to another hanging plant. It had bright green leaves with occasional spots of yellow and white variegation. “This is a golden pothos. It’s a true pothos. It gets more yellow and white streaks with more sunlight. Her name is Gilda.” He stuck a finger in the soil. “She can probably wait a few more days without water. Pothos don’t typically love to be over-watered.”
Dean shakes his head. “No, no...I want to. I just…” he stumbles over his words. “I don’t know what to do.” He finally meets Cas’s eyes again. “Can you show me?”
Castiel shook his head. “I’m not really supposed to say this, so you didn’t hear it from me, but Michael’s last omega never really went out a lot. When he did, he was with Gabriel or Michael. They were never mated or married. He left because he was having family issues back home and wanted to go back to them.”
The next day, Dean woke up again around 8am, already gasping and grabbing at Castiel’s arms. Whenever it got really serious like this, Castiel had to work quickly. There wasn’t time for being slow and sweet when Dean got this worked up. He was on the verge of getting too hot, so it took all of Castiel’s focus to keep him calm while he got him off with his fingers.
Castiel looked at Jack. “We keep Jack hidden. Nephilims are extremely dangerous. And, we find it. We have to kill it, wherever it is. We should also try to find out if there are more humans, so we can keep them safe. If there’s enough of them, we could end up bringing them back.”
Castiel showed Dean the linen on the hoop, revealing a pattern of delicate flowers and bumblebees. Parts of it were still sketched in pencil.
Dean chuckled and walked over to Castiel. “You have flour on your nose.” He brushed his thumb over the flour.
Castiel seemed to want to get this off his chest. “I was homeless from the age of 16 to 21. I hitchhiked around the country, mostly through the midwest, and found places to crash. I ended up in Chicago a little more than a year ago, and that’s when I met Luke. I was sitting in a restaurant to avoid the cold, and Luke approached me. We talked for a little while, and he offered to walk me home. I was having a really rough week, so I just broke down and told him I was homeless. He took me back here and gave me my own room, clothes, kept me fed, and just took care of me. We decided to get married and three months ago, we did.” He toyed with the diamond-encrusted ring on his left ring finger.
Castiel picked Jack up and put him on his shoulders as well. He knew Jimmy wouldn’t be able to hold Claire for the whole parade. She was getting big, almost at that breaking point of not being able to carry her anymore.
Castiel makes a cup of coffee and a bagel for breakfast. The table is nice to sit at. He can see the overgrown backyard and the houses behind it. Birds are chirping, and the sun is beating down on the grass. It was easily eighty degrees outside already. Georgia is known for its peaches and humid heat that drains the very life out of people.
It was hard to focus on one singular person or object in the room when so much was going on. Slow jazz and the sounds of people quietly conversing filled the room. Dean could hold his own just about anywhere, but this caught him off guard, even if it was only for a second.
Once Castiel was clean, Dean turned back around to lean against Castiel’s chest. They sat there for a while, just enjoying the warm water. Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s middle and held him close. He kissed his shoulder every now and then, humming against Dean’s skin.
“Yeah, it’s very consensual here. I like it and think it’s fun, especially because I get to make you angry. You have a cute angry face.”
Over the weekend, Castiel doesn’t do much except watch TV with Dean, work on homework, and hang out with Meg. It was relaxing and he felt good about settling into his new schedule for the semester.
Castiel watched Dean leave and chewed his lip. He needed to come up with a game plan for getting Dean out of Chicago safely, and fortunately, he had two days to plan. It was time for both of them to be free.
Castiel pulled back from the hug and nodded quickly. “Okay, no more talking for now. We’ll have time later. What do you need?”
Dean nodded and went upstairs to change into some more comfortable clothes before he started cooking. When he came back downstairs, he nearly had a heart attack. Castiel was on the sofa with Jack.
Castiel smiled. “I know, love. I just don’t want to hurt you.” He ripped open the condom packet and rolled it onto his cock. He used the slick leftover on his fingers as lube on his cock before shifting forwards, pressing the head to his hole.
Dean felt a little sad that Sam had to leave so soon, but he was really glad he was able to come at all. It made Chicago feel a little more like a home with Sam there.
It’s nearly dinnertime, and Castiel is hungry. He knows what he’s craving, but he’s not sure if he’s willing to get dressed to go there. After a minute of thinking, he knows his choice. He throws on a t-shirt and jeans, pulls his shoes on, and walks out into the living room.
Dean takes out a laptop and sighs, running his hands over his face. “My math professor, of all professors, gave us an essay assignment. It’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever had to do. We have to write about our experience with math and how it helps us with our careers. I can’t even figure out how to write the intro paragraph.”
Once it started getting late, Castiel made sure Jack was in bed before literally vanishing from Dean’s living room with the sound of fluttering wings.
“It’s okay. You were basically forced out of the house, and I stay cooped up so you don’t see me much. Also, he’s never laid a hand on me, so it’s not that bad-”
Dean’s eyes move to the floor. “It was...weird, I guess. It was weird when I started too. I had been dragged all over the country my whole life, and when I turned fifteen, Bobby insisted on taking us in. I stayed for a few weeks, and then my dad came to visit. He talked about the hunts he had been on, and I wanted to be a part of it. I wanted to be a hero. So I ditched Bobby and went off with my dad again. He still made me go to school wherever we were, which I’m grateful for. But after school, I’d hunt.”
Michael had changed from his work suit into more comfortable clothes, a t-shirt, and some silk pajama pants. He sat on his bed and gestured for Dean to join him.
Over the weekend, Dean had sent a few emails to the school about Claire moving and needing to change schools. The process was already underway, so all Dean had to do was find a new school for her in St. Louis and get in contact with the people there.
Dean nodded. If that was the narrative Michael had accepted, Dean would go along with it for the rest of his life.
Castiel continues trimming the bushes while he waits for Dean to return. They aren’t horribly overgrown, but little twigs of leaves are shooting out everywhere, and they will look much better once they are trimmed.
Dean nodded, feeling his stomach flutter like a teenage girl crushing on the high school football captain. He grabbed his keys and left the house with a massive smile on his face.
Dean takes the ice water with a thankful nod. “Pretty good. My hours are awesome. All of my classes are mid-morning and afternoon, so I just go after class and stay until five.”
“Eighty-seven points.” Castiel grinned as he watched. “Nicely done.” He wrote down the score on the little pen pad he had to keep track.
“If you don’t mind me asking, what was Castiel like in Chicago? He’s told me everything that happened, but I don’t know what it must have been like to be around him.”
