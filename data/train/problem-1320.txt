We parted enough to rest our foreheads together, grinning like idiots. I was reminded of the time we stole an ash tray from Buckingham Palace.
voice: “Wear it.”
should thank
He nodded forcefully into my shoulder. I could feel the brisk rise and fall of his chest pressed against me; the rapid beating of our hearts combining into a mellifluous rhythm through only the thin fabric of our shirts.
Greg shrugged. "I think you'd be surprised."
“John,” said Sherlock in a low voice, approaching him, “are you alright?”
They came to a stop. John, not releasing his flatmate’s hand, dismounted his bicycle, took a step over to Sherlock, who just about remembered to put a foot on the floor before John closed the distance between them and suddenly they were kissing.
It was summer. John bought us ice creams, even though they’re for children, but John smiled and he wanted me to have one and how could I refuse then?
A quick text message to his brother and the case was thereby closed...
He stepped out of the alcove and turned to see Sherlock standing at the foot of the stairs, his beautiful alabaster face lined in consternation. John avoided his eyes.
Things like when we went out for a walk one day. Together. He said I’d been cooped up too long and needed to breathe so we should go out for a walk. Just John and I. Just us. How I like it to be. How it should be.
That was it, then. I had to have a look. Didn’t I? Of course I did. Habit. Or reassurance? I probably shouldn’t have done, I suppose. But I did.
Breathing heavily, they parted, remaining close enough that John could see all the flecks of colour in those stunning eyes of the one who had dominated his thoughts, and his desires, for years.
Sherlock flinched; I felt the jump of his hands under my own. An expression of grave concern fell like a shadow over his face. He looked at me in a way which almost suggested he wanted to touch, to hold, to make sure I was alright and to protect me, but was too nervous to do so.
," he said, in what I presume was a more accurate pronunciation than before.
"Sherlock..."
When was this? What had happened? What was wrong with John? John! Are you alright, John?!
Sherlock, slowly, almost cautiously, extended his hand towards John, whose heart leapt into his throat as he realised what was happening. Taking a deep breath, John reached out and took Sherlock’s hand in his, threading their fingers together. They looked at each other and blushed.
A wave of emotion washed over me as I stared down at Sherlock. His dormant figure was just too reminiscent of the body I had seen... Then.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “No,” he said, a look on his face which could almost be called quizzical if not for the concern he also showed.
Greg opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by the teacher snapping at them both to stop talking and get on with their work. It was with reluctance that Greg did so, but John was grateful for the interruption.
Sherlock was far from convinced, but he refrained from commenting. This led to an awkward silence. A deafening silence. A silence so tense, the air pressure probably increased because of it. It was a wonder their ears didn’t pop.
"Sherlock... I love you."
I'd dreamt of visiting this place many times before (although until recently, I'd always imagined it to be with a woman) and now I was finally here I could hardly contain my excitement.
It was as if the air had been kicked out of Sherlock's lungs. His face seemed confused as to whether it ought to pale yet further or blush like a tomato. I wrapped him up in my arms, which he sank into obligingly. He gripped me tightly, as if afraid of losing me.
I wasn't surprised. I don't know what reaction I had expected from Sherlock, but utter shock and just overall
"I'm exactly ninety-seven -point three percent certain that Mycroft set this up, yes. Make that ninety-eight. No, ninety-nine-point-six." Then, as if on cue, I heard his phone ping. "One hundred percent," he growled. "The meddling bastard. How bloody typical of him."
Sherlock looked down at his feet for a moment, seeming to steel himself before looking up again and catching both of John's hands in his own. "John… will you do me the honour of accompanying me to prom?"
"Look, d'you mind?" I snapped. "Can't we just have this as our weekend off and try to enjoy ourselves for once?"
And then I kissed him.
“Don’t be alarmed if I try to dip you at the end,” said Sherlock.
Gloves, yes. I didn’t think. But I always think. Why didn’t I think? Oh. I was thinking about John. Again. Why does that keep happening? It’s distracting. I can’t focus on the work. I can only focus on him. Do I need to focus on anything other him? Why do I need to focus on anything other than him? I like to focus on him. My John Watson.
Expressionless, John Watson turned his attention to the speaker sitting next to him. "Yes, it is."
John stared, speechless.
nobody can love me, I'm... I'm a freak. I'm a sociopath. Everyone knows I'm... I'm just an emotionless, hollow
Ignoring him, I continued. "The night before we first met, I had a gun to my temple. Alright? I had a gun to my temple because I had nothing to live for anymore. Nobody to love, nobody who loved
ended rather quickly after I learnt that it was she who shot Sherlock.
We passed through to the back room. It was low-lit, the only windows facing the buildings across the narrow lane, and vintage wine bottles lined the walls. Sherlock chose a small table for two in one corner and I sat down opposite him.
"Well, you would, wouldn't you. I don't know why I even bothered asking. The point is, most people would say either Paris or Venice."
...leaving Sherlock Holmes and I on a cruise liner en route to Venice.
“I’ve adjusted it,” said Sherlock. “You’re supposed to be able to sit on the saddle and have your feet touching the floor, or so I’m told.”
Emphasis on
John grinned; this was one of the few times he’d seen Sherlock act excitedly over anything other than gruesome homicides. “We could take turns. I’ll start, you can finish.”
At this point, I think it may be best to confess that over the last couple of years, since Sherlock's... return, I have felt a little differently about him.
This was the last thing John wanted to hear. He groaned and sat back in his chair, giving in. There was no disguising it from most – that much he had come to terms with after several years of being addressed as Sherlock’s boyfriend by everyone and their mother, a happening which
"I know what we are, Sherlock."
There was a moment’s pause.
"What's so special about Venice, anyway?" grumbled Sherlock.
I ran my fingers over it and no: it’s older than any of those serviettes could be. Not one of those, then; unrelated. Irrelevant. Good.
"Jo-- sorry," he shook his head. "I don't... I don't understand. What was that? What does it... what does it mean?"
than Sherlock.
"God, yes."
"Right, she's horrible to Sherlock." Greg laughed, but then his grin slowly morphed into a serious expression of realisation. He raised his head, his features a picture of clarity. "God, you'll be going with him, won't you? Surely you're going with Sherlock?"
Sherlock sat there, an almost unreadable expression playing across his sharp features, and blinked. He seemed to be trying to form sentences, or just words... some way of verbalising what was going on in that beautiful mind.
have its benefits after all.
Then I read.
"John–" came Sherlock's voice from above, but John had already turned the corner, out of earshot.
No, stop: past tense. Read it. Don’t let emotions get in the way. I continued.
Suddenly, he took me by surprise by leaning over the table and kissing me. "I've wanted to do that for so long, you wouldn't believe."
"Much better, Mr Holmes," said the waitress (or, by the looks of it, government agent).
“Ahem, right,” he coughed as convincingly as he could, but only really succeeded in making his throat sting. “Must be coming down with one.”
The rest of the day dragged by for John, who spent it in a glum, reticent state, unable to shake the matter from his mind. The end-of-school bell had rung and he was climbing the staircase to the lockers, PE kit in hand, minding his own business, when he saw it:
, thank God. Mary. Only the tiniest bits.
"Of course. We are what we always have been. We are The Detective And His Blogger."
Back to skimming it. I couldn’t cope with reading it properly but I needed to know what else he’d put.
“Thank you,” said John, with the same authoritative tone.
I my face sank into his wonderful dark curls as I pressed a heartfelt kiss to his head.
Quickly, I pulled back. My heart raced; I couldn't believe what a rash, impulsive thing I had just done.
likes that shirt? Would
"Honestly, Sherlock, it's unusually kind of you but I'm quite happy to foot the bill. I just wanted you... erm... just try and enjoy yourself a bit, okay?"
Clearly, I had to up my game.
Fortunately, Greg didn’t seem to have noticed. “Took you long enough, both of you,” he grinned.
But it pained me, the way he dismissed romance as being so trivial... clearly, with a response such as that, there was no hope that my attraction to him could be mutual.
“Thank you, Graham,” replied Sherlock, soliciting a mild elbow in the ribs from John.
Bewildered, John nodded. "Wha– yeah, yes, of course, yeah. Anything. Ask."
"John... I was thinking..."
I loved, not Mary. I wonder, in hindsight, how I ever could've thought otherwise.
They then slipped back into comfortable silence, meandering over the moors, skirting round the curves of the headland, inhaling the bracing, salty sea air which rushed in their ears. Below, waves the colour of slate glittered and lapped at the shingle beach. Above, seagulls curved, soared, swooped, squawking noisily. Crickets hummed in the heather.
A sudden pang. I thought I’d deleted that. I don’t want to remember that. I don’t want that to ever have happened. Neither does John. I hope.
"John..." he repeated, quite incredulously.
I couldn’t read it anymore. Too much. Too personal, too… intimate. I scanned the rest. Couldn’t give part of it a second glance – the fall. I’ll never forgive myself for what I put him through. In trying to save the one person I care about most I made him suffer so much it was almost for nothing. Oh, John, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. John…
I took far too long to respond...
Back against the wall in a little alcove between a cupboard and a locker tower, John wiped his eyes and took a few deep, shuddering breaths, until, to all appearances, he was utterly calm, unfazed. He held up his hand: absolutely still. Good. But even with this near-perfect façade, could he really hope to fool Sherlock Holmes into believing that nothing was up?
I almost dropped the serviette.
"Sherlock..." I said, softly, brushing my thumb over his knuckles. "
"John..."
I was going to Venice with Sherlock.
"It's okay," I reassured him. "It's okay because I didn't, I didn't pull that trigger. I wonder... although of course you'll just scoff at this, but, but still... I wonder if it was some kind of, of
Some butterflies that had been lying dormant in John’s stomach since that morning suddenly flurried back to life, fluttering around with verve. But it took more than mere butterflies to overcome John Watson, and it was in the face of danger, or of uncertainty, that he was at his calmest. At his deadliest. At his best. Steely determination forced the butterflies back into submission.
Sherlock shook his head, lips pressed together in a thin, frustrated (but just slightly amused) line. He took the tray from the waitress. "
Anyway.
There was a rather tense pause.
Sherlock bit his lip.
"You're beautiful," I said, before I could stop myself.
as tourists - although very poorly, I might add; it is fortunate for them that most people are too busy getting excited over little boats to notice their wallets being stolen. Furthermore, there are no proper taxis and you have to get everywhere by boat, which is slow and cumbersome and impractical. If it's a beautiful city you're after, well, I much prefer London, where at least there's-
“John...”
“That might be a little awkward, with the glass pane in the way.”
“But why?”
“Well, why ever not?  I'm quite certain that she calls me far worse.”
I felt impossibly nostalgic for something not yet completely gone.
I find that there is nothing worse than waiting for an unknown eventuality.  I looked out glumly at the snow, cascading down in heavy flakes and settling thickly on the street, and wondered if we should be tramping in the midst of it quite soon.  Holmes was settled in his chair, legs drawn up tight against his chest, so much resembling a solemn bird of prey.  The air above him turned to fug as he smoked first one pipe then the next, some noxious mixture that matched well with his dark mood.
“Oaks has gone home,” I said, “but the ladder is repaired.  What will you do?”
The lady nodded.  “Yes, he was.  He was a kind man.  A little odd, but a kind man.  I was twenty when I first came here to work, and I'm forty-five now.”  She nodded again.  “Yes, I'm forty-five now.”
“You can't mean that?” I said.
I thanked her kindly for her trouble, and climbed the stairs in dread, for all the things that I might say and might be said to me in turn.
“Holmes,” I said, guilty now, “I do not think we handled that at all well.  The fellow does seem to believe in the crystal skull legend.  I have read a little of it myself, and I would say that--”
And so it was that Victor learned of the contents of the safe box.  His large blue eyes could scarce believe it as he picked up first one bundle and the next.  Securing his own future, and the future of the gables should he wish to set some permanence within it.  Never had he imagined that his dear eccentric aunt should have so carefully squirrelled away a trove while living in such modesty.  We listened to him babble as he expounded on all the things that he might do:  Repair the structure!  Refresh the décor!  Give up his humdrum job, follow his dream, commence to writing his first novel!
I remained where I was, a quiet smile on my face.
And having shaken the man's hand, I marched away towards the shore.
“Watson, they're everywhere,” said he, “you must get rid of them.”  He paused.  “Or I'll be sick.”
I peeped at the book's cover.  George Meredith's
“If that fellow shows up dead tomorrow morning, you will be sorry.”
, and tramped her way towards the gate, we watched her tracking footprints deep and heavy in the pile.  We were alone again, at last, with no intention of poking noses out for the fear of being frozen off.
“We were together for a year, I think, then I was invalided out.  The same fate befell poor Everett shortly afterwards, only he did not return to London.  He was scooped up by his family and sent to live abroad to best recuperate.  We wrote to one another, as you've seen by all the evidence.  Perhaps we hoped that time would find a way to work things out.  But then I met
“Well, more fool them,” said Holmes.  “If they want to lose, then we won't stop them.”
By twelve o'clock, he was half done with it, in fact had thrown his pen down and was standing at the window looking out.  The weather was quite frightful; it was raining now, the fall piercing the fog that settled on the looming lamp posts.
“That is all,” said he.  He edged towards the door again, his eyes still fixed upon me.
“Thank you, yes, but...?”
“What was that?” said he.
“With the Yard, just a few months.  I'm mostly independent.”
Adams shrugged.  We turned to look back at the house.  Through the large window of the drawing room, we saw more people gathering.  It was almost time for lunch.  We headed back, detouring through the trees and hugging at the shade.
Because they were inconsequential, and they made no sense to me, no sense at all.
, don't forget.”
“Not really,” I replied.  “For I'm still none the wiser.”
“I don't know what you like,” I said.  “I don't know anything.”  I kissed his mouth.  “What
“So things have changed?”
It opened without our having to ring the bell.  A maid – the same as our first visit, I thought – stood to greet us.  A summer coat and carry-all were set close by on a chair.  The girl was evidently completing her shift and about ready for home.  She peeped up through a pair of mournful brown eyes.
I touched him; cupped him through the flannel.  “As hard as Hades,” I said softly.
large enough.)  I fretted for a moment, while my stomach curled with glee.  “That's very kind of you.”
Holmes tapped his fingers thoughtfully upon the table cloth.  “All I can say for the moment is this:  it would have proven problematical, if not impossible, for the killer to carry a heavy, life-sized crystal skull down a perilous drainpipe and yet somehow still manage to keep a safe hold to the pipe.  Assuming that there truly was a meeting with Mr. Talmadge inside his study, the skull's habitual resting place was in the bedroom at the far end of the landing.  We have a number of hypotheses, therefore.  One: that the murder was committed, whereupon the culprit left the study, entered the main bedroom and stole the skull.  They then returned to the study, locked the door from within and exited through the window, with both their prize and the murder weapon in hand.  That, quite frankly, seems unlikely.  Two: the same scenario, except the killer had obtained a spare key to the study.  They created their 'blind' and left by the main door on the ground floor.  Our third hypothesis: that Talmadge had brought the skull into his study for some reason, and the crime was perpetrated along largely similar lines as I mentioned.  And the last: that there was, in fact, no late night visitor at all.”
“What do you say now, eh, my boy?” chuckled Holmes.  He rubbed his hands and closed the door.  “Although it's not so very deep.  It will have melted by the afternoon.”
“And when do I
“Why, Sherlock, John,” said he.  “How unexpected.”  He took a closer look at us.  “What has happened?”
you're dripping egg upon your cuff.”
sets of encyclopaedias?  John, this afternoon I think that I might start work on the apiary.”
“Well...”
My chuckles made the bed vibrate.  “I'll pickle you,” I said.  “I'll pickle you right here and now.  Don't assume that I'm insensible.”  I reached out and grasped his thigh.  “Wherever did you
Those precious words, as clear as from yesterday; and each and every one we uttered, stuttered inside that tiny room, and revealing for the first time:
“Aha!  I thought as much.”
,” said Holmes.  He disappeared.  For want of something sensible to do, I buttered toast and set a plate of it aside.  I moved the cold trays to the sideboard, straightened the cloth, and took my seat.  When Holmes returned, he was serene once more.  He joined me at the table.
I collected each and every last round white lace doily – there were a fair few – and then stood dithering, not quite sure what to do with them.
Do you see now, Watson?  To any question that related to those moments around the crime,
“You fall into these tremendous pickles, and then you expect me to pull you out of them.  Well, I refuse this time.  Point blank.  You must take responsibility.”
“It's best you speak to Sherlock Holmes about him, then,” replied Lestrade.  “If he won't tell you, then it's hardly my right place to sit here gossiping.”
And indeed, that was the most I could get out of him that evening.  I retired to bed not a little irritated and perplexed.  I resolved to reach the bottom of the mystery on the morrow.
“It's seven-thirty!” I exclaimed.  “I'd no idea it was so late.”  I scrambled up, to the dismay of my attendants.
“Not particularly.”
The window bore no curtain, and the evening gloom stretched in to meet the shadows that roamed freely by the glimmer of the lamp.  I rather wished we might have waited 'til the morning to begin this wretched task, but Holmes was set on his pursuit and I would tag along behind, avoiding spiders, blowing dust from here to there – did Mrs. Hudson
“I shall bring them across to you,” I said, and I did so.
The corridors we walked down were quite empty at this time, and our footsteps rang most pleasant on the tile.  Pike's room was familiar to us: a strung mess of chairs and shelving.  The morning sunlight, blazing clean straight through the lattice, had us blinking for our host, his usual perch now sitting empty.
“Call me whatever you'd like.”
His hand swept down my back to clasp my backside, and I jolted, moaned, and shivered.  “Give me time,” he whispered, ragged.  “Can you wait?”
“Love at first sight is quite ridiculous,” I told him.  “What would you
“We have been walking,” said he, “for just twenty five minutes.”
The gentleman perched upon our sofa, and mopped his brow with his 'kerchief.  He gazed up at Holmes in awe, as if my friend were an extraordinary deity.
“Yes,” Holmes replied, “but all the same, don't get carried away, John.  You and your hypotheses.  But, my goodness, these rural areas and their medics.  Should it really take such an eon to determine the cause of death?  And then there is the matter of the old crone who hangs by the gate, as Victor informs us.  What involvement might she have?  Well, it might be merely a curious local, but still – our man is on his nerves there at that house alone, and with so much to be done.  We had best take the next train to Surrey.  And I suppose we should pack for an overnight stay.  Our fellow's state might well wish for some moral support.”
“What
“I do not.”
“Come
“Yes indeed,” the fellow said.  “I've had a lovely time.  We all have, haven't we?”
For a number of seconds his bottom lip trembled, and I wondered if he might be about to throw some sort of fit.  To my astonishment, after the trembling, his face turned to smiles.
,” he said.
I refused to return home, however.  I told my friend that he should find me in the establishment across the road – I pointed – and to meet me there the minute he was able.
“Yes, you did,” said he.  I heard him move and rustle on the bed.  “That is my business, though, and little of your own.”
Archie Flowers came in and closed the door obediently behind him.  He hovered then, uncertain, but in a dash of strong resolve set to his worry.
“What I should really like,” my friend continued, “is a murder.  A mystery.  For something to
Our Blue Room was little changed from last we saw it.  I heaved the beds together once again, and unpacked our bag.  This could be our final night here, and after that no more.  The thought displeased me, made me frown for Victor's sake.  The lad deserved a better outcome; he deserved some happiness.
“Good morning, Dr. Watson,” said Mr. Holmes, and we held to each other's gaze as the room door pushed to and clicked, leaving me cast out and alone.
“The late morning mail,” said Holmes.  “Where is it?”
Would we?  Six months, or a year down the line?  Sequestered away, would we dull to the travel, and the concept of contact?  Or would we find ourselves stifled, and bored to distraction and aching for sport and the thrill of the chase?
“Let us hope, then, that it is us who go doolally first,” said Holmes.  “Then Mrs. Hudson can look after us.  How much older is she, do you think?  How long before her knees give out?”
toss things out.”
who offered you the spare bed in my room?”
, before crumpling the sheet into a ball and overarming it away.
At Holmes's prompting, the housekeeper recounted all that had occurred, and to the best she could remember it.  The speech was interspersed with sobs, and long pauses while the dear woman tried to calm herself.
“It will never be so,” I said firmly.  “Wipe that notion right out of your head, straight away.”
I laughed with him, indulgent.  “That sounds fantastical,” I said.  “It would make for the most perfect story.”
I removed my jacket and rolled my shirt-sleeves to the elbow.  I sat at the breakfast table and reached to snatch the flapping newspaper in mid-wave.  The front page was almost comical.
“I have an elder brother,” Holmes said abruptly.  “Who lives adjacent to Pall Mall.”
“You're right,” I said.
They nodded, mystified.
I leaned against the jamb, and watched.  “Do you know, I adore every inch of you.  Each and every damn solitary inch.  You are perfect.”
I hummed a little, pleased; the thought had not occurred before.  Now here: two hives, with larvae still developing; the lull before the buzz.
“You are not in any trouble,” my friend replied.  “We only wished to learn the cause, and now we know, and that's the end of it.”  He paused and looked to Victor in silent question.
“But you knew that I was out...?”
“It is a tattoo,” I said slowly.
I imagined that Holmes would tell him, then.  But perhaps he wished to spare him the perplexion and the doubt, for he said nothing much of solace but:
“It would be nice if
“It is in the shape of a moustache,” said Holmes, eager now to clarify.  He stood back, anticipating my approval.
“It just feels right with you,” he said.
Holmes pulled my arm in the direction of the dining room.  The other pairs were drifting off towards the drawing room and gardens.  We came up trumps, with three small eggs for our straw basket, hidden cleverly in lampshade, drawer, and soup tureen.
“Damn you,” he whispered.  He bit at my ear.  He tormented my neck.  “Damn you.  Please.
“If I had said all that I wanted to,” said he, “I would have been incarcerated.  John, I've
needn't play.  You can do whatever you'd like.”
“Go back to that silly fellow, then.  The one on Oxford Street.  The one with the gammy leg and the mutton-chop whiskers.  It's no wonder you like him.”
“That perhaps we might do better than play cards.”
He turned his head to see us trotting up towards him.
to ask you out,” I said, quite boldly then.
“What was that?” I enquired.  “They have lit a coal fire in the
The sky was clearing, finally, the white clouds peeking out in slithers, querulous.  It was so quiet, on the path, and in the lane; we could hear nothing but the gentle roll of wind, the tall trees echoing its tarry.  I felt the need to be outside all of a sudden: to stroll down to the cliffs again, to walk with Holmes, that he might share all of this joy with me.  I said as much.  He snorted, more's the pity.
He is asleep, I am certain of it, but:
“They say, nothing unusual,” he exclaimed.  “How can that be?  When I myself have observed the old woman, who stands by the gate and looks through with her dark, beady eyes?  And then there is the garden!  I ask about it, and all they can tell me is that this fellow popped up like some magic rabbit, and spent three weeks or a month doing all of these things.”
“Well?” all three demanded, Stone and the pair of married Dickens.  “Well?”
”  The elder Holmes let out a doughty chirrup that I supposed to be a laugh.  “Oh, he's remarkable, all right.  Ha ha!”  His grey eyes narrowed, took me in a little more.  “And you are friends?”
It turned out, in fact, we had.  Our nearest rivals had been Uncle Rufus and Aunt Rufina, who carried nine.
“Yes,” I said.  “In fact, they are.  Thank you for asking.”
“On the contrary,” I said, “it is a very good idea.”
“Well, that is elementary,” I said, with a broad smile creeping onto my face.  “As a grand lunatic, Holmes.  You should know that by now.  A clever one, yes,” I added – observing his crestfallen expression – “but a lunatic all the same.”
“The notes were in a woman's hand.  You dictated them, your mother wrote them down.”
“I am so deeply, incredibly sorry, Mr. Holmes,” our guest returned.  “I meant you no harm by my charging towards you.  I am not a violent man.  I was so caught up with the urgency to warn you of the danger.  For if anything should happen, well, I don't think I could bear it, with the knowledge that I might well have prevented the atrocity!”
“Because you could not pay the rent?”
I slammed my hand upon the table.  “No, Holmes, it does
“You're shivering,” I said.  “I'll poke the fire.”
“Neither do I,” replied Holmes.  “Which is why, my dear boy, we have arrived at this impasse.”  He looked at his watch.  “In heaven's name, whatever
He lay beside me on the bed, as I grabbed handfuls of his flesh: his thighs, his back, his rump.  I grazed him with my teeth.  He let out a high-pitched whine, bucked hard against me.
I chuckled.
“Where is he now?”
“That is wonderful news,” I said, smiling.
The string quartet began at two.  The music room was crammed, so many guests and servants, both, invited.  We took places at the front, on wooden chairs that creaked and wobbled, and we listened to the tuning up, and then – the music started! – Oh, the music – we heard Haydn, Schubert, Mendelssohn... and solo pieces, and duets; it was a blissful way to spend an afternoon.  My friend was in a perfect happiness; I watched him, too, his fingers waving gently to the music, his eyelids fluttering in harmony to trills and turns and slides...
We drew level with our friend.
“I have seen her several times from these windows,” Victor replied.  “Dressed in black, with an odd hooded cape.  But by the time that I open the front door, she has gone.  It is as if she is a phantom.”
“Aer-o-dy-nam-ic,” he repeated, stretching out each syllable as if the word was entirely new to him and he was not sure of the taste of it.  “Watson?  Elaborate, please.”
“On the sideboard,” I replied.  “And there is not so much of it.  Two letters and an invoice, as best I can tell.”
Holmes nodded.  He took a notebook from his pocket and scribbled down a few short lines.

much detail as to the possibilities.”  He laughed ruefully then.  “My god, those letters, they are something.  You must have blushed down to your roots when you first read them.  Were your own, to him, as colourful?”
It was a Thursday morning in late spring, and the sunshine, startled and drowsy from its full eight months of slumber, set to splay upon our sitting-room at 221B Baker Street.  The warmth was pleasant, and we sat, my friend and I, at the small table on which our breakfast had been laid, and eaten, and set aside.  I turned the pages of
We kissed again by the front door, and softly, gently, took our time.  “Thank you for trusting me,” I said.  I snubbed his nose.  I pressed my lips against his throat, and tongued a line of butterflies up to his ear, which I nipped sharply with my teeth.  He whined a little, jerking, twitching.  “When can I see you next?” I asked.
Yes, I know, but...
He came, like that, around me, as I fucked him with my hand, his body shaking, eyes tight shut, ungodly moaning, jerking, reaching, blindly pulling at my hair.
“--Yes, yes, all right,” said he.  “Good gracious, how you rattle on.  I'd rather that you chew your pipe.”  He paused.  “By the way, it is a
Holmes drummed his fingers on the mantel.  He closed his eyes.
“Victor, don't be noisy.  I am still collecting data.  Data, data, data,” he continued, in a sing-song fashion that was almost to himself.  “Please be patient, my dear fellow.  You may pull the curtains if you so wish.  Now, then, shall we turn our thoughts towards something a fraction more diverting?  I propose a visit to that inn with the ludicrous name, to sample their ale and most excellent pies.  I fancy that an evening in convivial surroundings would do us all the power of good.”
“Is anything supposed to happen, Holmes?”
“But how on earth did you manage to get Stone to confess?”
Winter sets a man to thinking.  It is a time for contemplation, resolution, and fresh spirit.  I thought about our home life, now at its happiest and settled.  I considered Holmes's practice, which was the busiest we had known it for some time.  We were at a pleasant spot indeed at this point in our lives – the beginning of the fifth year of our love.  All that had gone before it, all of the trials that had beset us, all that we had overcome, had made us stronger as a pair.
Which was not so long – two hours passed, and then the bell rang out below.  My friend unfurled himself, and stepped out to the landing.  When he re-entered, he was holding a small parcel.
Sherlock Holmes shifted uneasily.  “I say a great many things that people think are strange,” he said.  “Could you be more specific?”
We remained just where we were, upon a faded carpet runner.
“Aye!” said he.  “I've heard of him.  He's staying at the inn.  He's a little furriner.”
Lestrade was feigning busywork at the far side of the room.  I straightened out my jacket and I pulled the window shut.
I groaned.  “I think they may have been.  At least we only signed with our initials.  We had some little saving sense, at least.”
me,” he replied.  “My name is Sherlock Holmes.”
Holmes ducked his head.  I blinked, confused.  “Your bowls were sullied, Mrs. Hudson?”
We settled ourselves as the train pulled out slowly.  We were just three inside our carriage, and just as well, for so many bags and jackets, hats and sticks.  Gregson lolled back in his seat and fixed us with a lazy smile.
“John, I regret to tell you that the estimable Lady Augusta is deceased,” said he.
“--Patience with tongue-tied young clients, however,” said Holmes, his tone now sharp, “is not.”
“All of a high denomination,” said he.  “Aunt Augusta clearly held little respect for the humble street bank.  John, there are a great many thousands of pounds here.”
We drank our coffee, which was cold, then found ourselves entwined once more.
Sherlock swallowed. He blinked. It might have been the light, but John thought he saw those pale, razor-sharp cheekbones redden a little.
Exasperated, I crossed the small room and stood opposite Sherlock. He may be a good foot taller, but I tried my best to look as intimidating as I could.
"So, prom's coming up."
Suddenly the gondola struck a wall and rocked to a halt, and Sherlock leant back from me. Our trip now over, he stood up and stepped out of the boat, then stretched a hand out to me, which I took, and helped me out too.
"Oh, believe me, I would," and I kissed him back.
Deep breath. Steadied myself. Felt almost as though I was intruding, as though this was something too close, too intimate, but… I couldn’t stop reading. Suddenly my eyes were moving of their own accord, my brain interpreting involuntarily. Had to continue.
"Go on," I encouraged him.
I love you, John.
"I love you too, Sherlock. God, I love you so much."
John could feel the prickle of tears behind his eyes. A terrible wave of devastation and more than a little jealousy cascaded over him. He had no right to be jealous, he scolded himself; he had no more right to Sherlock and his affections than anyone else. If Sherlock was happy, and that happiness was caused by someone other than him, then yes, that hurt, that was agonising, but John loved him, and he valued his happiness over his own. If Sherlock was happy, then John should be, too.
"Aren't you going to read the message?" I asked.
We passed down a footpath flanked by tall, peeling-plaster buildings on the right and the glittering, grey-green water of the Grand Canal on the left, swept along by a crowd of tourists. Stalls crammed with merchandise including piles of flags, straw hats and Pinnochio-esque puppets speckled the street, their wooden struts adorned with eerie papier-mâché masks like gargoyles.
John thrust a second helmet – a blue, faintly shimmery thing – at Sherlock. Then, in his
"Then, of course, I had to leave you for two years..." I felt his fingers tighten on my shirt. "...to protect you."
Without even a moment’s hesitation, Sherlock took the helmet, and, adjusting his curls appropriately, fixed it on his head.
John frowned. “You never know, you might enjoy it. I find it quite relaxing. You should give it a chance.”
"Lovely place, isn't it?" I mused.
Then something occurred to me: "I just thought -- you don't think Mycroft..."
"John... I didn't think you'd ever think of me in this way. I know I was being selfish, but every time you brought home some girl it was a knife to my heart. With every new girl I thought maybe this is the one, the one who'll take my John away from me..."
“Sherlock…?”
is more relaxing than this, John," he replied, although not with quite as much bite as usual. I must've been making some headway.
He froze.
“When I was younger,” John began, after a while, “we used to play this game, on our bikes, Harry and I…” His countenance became a little wistful. Sherlock said nothing, allowing him time to continue. “We’d ride next to each other, like we are, and hold hands and see how far we could manage before one of us almost fell off.”
Nothing had changed, though everything had changed.
I couldn't live with the one who had endangered his life again, so soon after he had, against all odds, granted me that miracle I wished for at his 'grave'. I couldn't live with the one who had almost stolen him away from me again. It was then that I had realised that it was
John looked up in surprise. Sherlock Holmes did not repeat things. Was he really considering it? “Yeah,” he nodded. “I mean, we’re here at the seaside, it’s a lovely day, and you are supposed to be relaxing…”
A restaurant serviette, by the feel of it, folded neatly into a square – he wanted to preserve it, then. Sentimental value? Why would such a thing have sentimental value?
I poured us tea.
“It’s
“Why do you think I let you go last?” John winked, and Sherlock just
“What?”
“Watch the road, John,” he said. “Don’t want you falling flat on your face because you were staring at me instead.”
I couldn't believe my ears.
A little tentatively, Sherlock took John’s hand, and they began to head over to the floor. “Who’s going to lead?” he whispered, happily, in John’s ear.
“Helmet?” questioned Sherlock instead, nodding at his companion with a raised eyebrow.
we going to do?  I want to
for you tomorrow.”  And I blew a solid raspberry, and made my way to slumber, to my tiny room, my single bed, on blasted Upper Wimpole Street.
I stared, fascinated, as he dropped his toast and clawed with both his hands beneath the tablecloth.
“No, John, don't catapult like that.  I thought it wouldn't do much good, if I admitted it.  I wanted you so badly.  I didn't want you to make
I cleared my throat.  “Yes?”
I looked at my friend there on the sill, seated beside me.  I was not sure what I should say or do.  My impulse was to throttle him, but I am, I think, a gentleman.  “Holmes,” I said.  “You are an idiot.”
“Should I sort through them?”
Mr. Dooley was indeed a 'dapper dresser', for when he joined us at the table he was resplendent in a dark plum pinstripe suit, and boots so polished that one might have seen one's face in them (if one had so desired).  A handsome fellow, too, though delicate and fine-boned, with a sleek of ash blond hair.  I saw friend Adams fairly goggling, and tripping over words to pass the butter dish our way.  He caught me after lunch had been concluded, and the guests had wandered off to fresh amusement.
That afternoon I had occasion to pay a visit into town.  The air that day was frigid, and so Holmes declined to walk with me.  He pointed to his violin, and made a sawing gesture.  So considering that I had made a fortunate escape from an ear-torturing concerto, I departed, muffled up against the elements.
I shut the door, and it was now the two of us alone.
“I know.”
Progress had been made, then, since the blighting, drawn-out Winter.  Renovations to the cottage – the roof repaired, windows replaced, a fresh lick of paint around and under – and to the front outside, new bulbs and seeds already sprouting forth and bursting through the green.
“I love you,” he whispered.
“Thank you for letting me climb over,” I said gently.
Mrs. Hudson was at home.  She drew me in with a kind motherly concern.
Holmes's eyelids shuttered down.  He pursed his lips.  “Hardly worth mentioning,” he said.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Still perfect,” I countered.  “Your cock's still the same.”
“I have never been in love,” he said.
Mrs. Bruce allowed her jaw to drop and waver there.
I sighed.  “A hundred years!  That is a very long time, Holmes.”
(It appears that brandy makes me maudlin.)
This conversation was becoming quite as torturous as the one I'd had with Gregson.  (Had Gregson cared for me at all?  It didn't seem so at the time.  Perhaps I was not very good at all of this.)  “What is your history?” I asked him.
“I beg your pardon... Bugalugs?”
“It's February,” said my friend.  “That is what February does.”  He flicked the ash tip of our cigarette, and wrapped an arm around me.  “We'd do well to keep each other warm.”
He slid the letter back into its envelope, stuffing it into his left trouser pocket.
He looked put out.  “Well, when?”
Ten minutes later, and we were back out into the roil and brushing hair from our shirt collars.
are somewhat aggravating,” I replied.  “But let's not hold these facts against us.”
“You have had so much to bear this past year,” I said.  “But your reunion with Gregson is the silver lining, my dear fellow.  We are happy for you both.  His strength will help you see this through.”
“I had a brother too,” I said.  “He died.”
Holmes laid a hand upon my arm.  “Yes.  Please.”
“Well, let's forget what I was going to say.  It doesn't matter now.”  He pushed the chair back, rose, and strode towards the door.  He turned to look at me.  “You'll never know, you bloody fool.”  He left.  The door yawned widely in his wake.  I stared long after him, expecting him to have a change of heart.
"I lost face in front of my opponent. And it's all your fault. If anyone finds out about it... I'm finished." He took a deep breath before giving Sherlock a pained look. "Why didn't you say anything?"
Mike rolled his eyes and went to get the water. On the way to the bathroom, he muttered to himself, "Mental. Completely mental. The both of them."
“No?” Sherlock repeated in a whisper, and John saw him sway a bit before he steadied himself again.
"THANK YOU," Sherlock blurted out. "FOUR!"
"Do it again," John said calmly.
“I can't,” John admitted. “People are going to be interested in you. But... that doesn't matter! You're safe with me. As safe as houses. No one, absolutely no one, is allowed in my house without being checked over first. The property is guarded and kept under surveillance. I have an army of bodyguards on my payroll. Did you really think I of all people wouldn't have any enemies myself?” John laughed bitterly.
for a picture of Moran," Sherlock said with a shrug.
John took two deep breaths, grabbed Sherlock by the shoulders, turned him around, and pushed his upper body down on the coffee table.
Nervous once again, Sherlock gnawed on his bottom lip.
Sherlock took care of the mail and all the other tasks that came up, and then undertook an intense study of the structure of John's organisation. That would hopefully give him enough to do to keep him busy for two or three days and distract him from missing John. He barely touched the food that Mrs Turner served him at noon and in the evening (John had given Jacques time off from work for the duration of his absence). The cook noted it with a disapproving shake of her head, but Sherlock didn't pay her any mind.
John's eyebrow lifted. "Well... all that stuff about
“Why are you still here?” he asked. He almost sounded angry.
"Oh," Sherlock said, having first to digest that bit of information. "I hope you didn't fire him because you thought he was spying for Mycroft."
"You bought something..." Sherlock began hesitantly before crying out, "Oh, John! You're such an idiot! They would have given me half the shop for free! You shouldn't have spent any money there."
d bought his virginity? Good God, it was John! Of course he could tell him. John – who had always been kind to him. John, who had shown him what ecstasy truly meant. John, who ... had just violated him ... John, who had almost shot him... Perhaps it would actually be wiser not to confide in this man, but to fear him. But no matter how deep Sherlock searched within himself, he couldn't find any fear. John was a dangerous man – very dangerous, in fact – and even though it was insane, Sherlock found that extremely sexy and attractive. Wasn't John exactly what he'd always secretly dreamt of? Someone who beat him and was a little bit nice to him once in a while? Now he had all of that – and? Was he happy? No, he wasn't. Sherlock was troubled to admit that now that he had everything that had seemed so far out of reach before, it simply wasn't enough.
She pulled the sheet off the bed, threw it at Sherlock's head, and barked that he should go directly to her office. Sherlock wrapped the sheet loosely around his body and overheard on his way out as Irene continued to apologise profusely in an attempt to soothe the enraged client.
"It was obvious!" John hissed.
John acted as if he were giving serious consideration to the offer, but then he shook his head with a smile so sweet and friendly it was frightening.
The late afternoon sun fell through the generous windows, casting the room in soft, warm, pink light.
"John... no one seriously thinks that you..."
from the voicemail on the phone you found all those months ago? Do you also think he's the '
At the same time, Sherlock had long since become someone John could interact with on an even playing field, someone at his level and whom he felt was his equal. And who never shied away from the essence of his true nature. Someone who acknowledged his faults, admitted them with a sigh and accepted them with a shrug, and who still had such a low estimation of himself that he was amazed by even the smallest compliments. Someone whose face lit up when he was praised and who then turned around and said or did just as many things that he knew would get him in trouble.
Sherlock flinched back a bit but took the tools out of his pocket anyway.
"Stuff and nonsense," Mrs Turner waved off his objection and put a slice of bread on the serviette beside his plate. "What do you think Mr Watson will say to me when he comes home and finds you nothing but skin and bones?"
was weeks ago!" Greg complained with a certain amount of heat in his voice as he came closer.
"You're back already," he noted.
"Fine..." Lestrade said slowly. The gruff response took him by surprise, but he thought it wiser not to let that show. Mr Holmes' brother was obviously the black sheep in the family - and who liked to talk about the rotten apples in their family tree? No one. Least of all people who'd made something of themselves.
"Very careful," Mycroft answered soberly.
"Probably buggered off," Moran remarked stoically. "They're all pretty much pansies."
parcel,
"You can come any time," John said softly before ghosting a kiss onto Sherlock's moist glans, opening his lips, and taking the tip of his stiff penis into his mouth. It was the second time he'd done this for Sherlock. But the situation was different today. The other time, it had been just one part of the torment, one part of the ecstasy.
“Yes, you were,” Sherlock replied nonchalantly, re-arranged his legs so that he was straddling John's lap, and ground his hips against John's lower body.
"Sherlock..." John warned him. "Don't try to talk your way out of it now. You won't make it any better. You wanted to smoke. That's the only reason you hammered away at the suspect until he lit up. The only reason. Not because you knew it would turn up any evidence against him. If that had been the case... then you would simply have confiscated his cigarillos in the first place and given them to Greg. And the only reason Greg's reaction to your ridiculous '
"I could help you out a little, of course," John said, returning to the conversation as if the almost uncomfortably intense eye contact between them had never taken place. "I could make it a bit easier on you... so that you can get through the next few days without me... Should I do that for you? Hm?" He threaded his fingers through the dark curls with a gentle yet firm motion, tugged on them lightly, and just like that Sherlock was putty in his hands.
John tilted his head from side to side, considering. "But... I'm sure that once you start spreading your legs for all the guests three or four times a day, you'll bring in a pretty penny for Miss Adler."
Ecstasy and pain raged through his body, careening him from one extreme to the other until he thought it couldn't possibly get any worse - and it couldn't possibly get any better. And right then, the blows stopped. John interrupted his rhythm and stepped in close to Sherlock, holding a thin, narrow scarf made of dark blue silk in one hand.
Pictures of City Hall:
"You can't forgive me so quickly!" John pressed him. "You can't keep forgiving me all the time!" he entreated Sherlock urgently.
"Greg?" It was a call to action.
"So, Mycroft..." John said at the end of that eventful day, once he was alone with Sherlock in the bedroom. "You contacted Mycroft behind my back?"
"This Donovan seems to be a remarkable woman with a remarkably long reach," Mycroft stated in a tone that bordered on admiring.
Then he heard John's countdown again.
From that point on, everything around Sherlock lost all sense of meaning. The friction of the sheets against his wounded back, the tautness of the skin on his buttocks, the pain in his nipples. None of that was important anymore. He only wanted John, only felt John, only registered John.
From that time on, Sherlock would frequently put in a CD of opera music and sit at John's feet, nuzzling against him like an oversized Persian cat … or a tame black panther. John could never quite decide. However, he had noticed - from the early days of their meeting, in fact - that Sherlock had a tendency to cling, snuggling up so close that there wasn't room for so much as a slip of paper between them.
While Sherlock climbed onto the bed with catlike grace and took up a position mimicking the one from their last meeting, John went to the cupboard with the aids and confidently picked out a tube of lubricant. When he returned to the bed with it, Sherlock regarded the tube in his hand with a slight frown.
John bit his lower lip. It was really quite irksome that such a talented marksman was working against him rather than for him.
that he was the mayor's protégé. At least his status had now been made official by his new title, and the suggestive innuendos - which weren't meant to be taken altogether seriously - had ceased.
They walked silently back through the park.
Violet Sigerson was dying.
Tonight, Sherlock would ask John to let him take on the active role... just this once, he wanted to see what it was like to sink into John, to give John pleasure in that manner, to feel John that way, to experience his warmth, to... love John like that.
Mike, who had watched the exchange with both disbelief and amusement, thought it was about time to remind the other two of his presence.
The taunts of the other students weren't forgotten, but they faded even further into the background, lost their meaning and no longer influenced how he saw himself, while John's compliments assumed a much larger role in his thoughts and rose closer to the forefront. Sherlock hearkened back to how gradually this development had occurred... how John's words of praise had been so painful at first... how they had later become merely unpleasant... how he had finally learned to accept them as some sort of delusion John suffered from, and how he could now believe them himself.
Sherlock didn't move a muscle. He continued to lie there quietly, watching through half-lidded eyes as John went to the sideboard and took out the riding crop.
Still, John took it as a good sign that Sherlock had chosen that particular suit to wear tonight. He fancied it meant that Sherlock was willing to forgive, and to start a new chapter.
"No, it's... I mean, yes - I've passed urine and everything was fine... the same as usual. No blood, no pain, no burning..." Sherlock answered, trying to hide the thickness in his voice by clearing his throat.
Sherlock felt himself turning red at the memory of that unpleasant scene, and kicked himself for it. What had he been thinking?
http://lorelei-lee.tumblr.com/search/deflowered+director's+cut
Mycroft closed his eyes, pained. "I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that..."
"What... what are you doing?" Sherlock asked, heavy-tongued, in testimony to his fatigue.
The winter festival in Hyde Park is a real thing too:
"You've been making inquiries about me," Sherlock said. His mouth felt as dry as a bone, and it was incredibly difficult for him to speak.
On this particular day, Mike was sitting in his usual spot on the leather couch, going through account statements and payslips. John usually sat on one of the armchairs - since Sherlock had taken his chair - or paced restlessly up and down the room. That was the case today as well. Sherlock was engrossed in the invoices and was almost entirely hidden behind the mountains of binders and papers that towered over him on the desk, while John prowled back and forth in front of the windows.
“I know it's fine”, Sherlock answered with an amused smile. “But I'm happy that now you know it now, too.”
"Mike!" John protested. But the exclamation didn't carry any acrimony. "I can't be smitten with a..." He sounded exhausted and defeated. "For God's sake! The man is a prostitute!"
Once the aftershocks of his orgasm had let up a bit, he crouched over Sherlock. A bit dazed and uncoordinated, he rolled over beside the other man and gathered him close. Sherlock promptly snuggled up against him and buried his face in John's chest. Shudders continued to run through the slender form in his arms, and every time an incredibly lustful sigh fell from the full, red lips, making Sherlock's breath flow hot and moist over John's skin. The sighs were following by a seemingly never-ending stream of whispered utterances that sounded like "
Why hadn't he taken him with him to Harwich? Then none of this would have happened... He should have dragged him out of the house by his hair and stuffed him into the boot with brute force...
A split second later, he found himself enveloped in a suffocating embrace that seemed to involve more arms than a single person could possibly have. He tried to extricate himself, but Sherlock pushed him down into the armchair with his entire weight and kissed him frantically. He forced his tongue mercilessly in between John's lips and licked and kissed and bit and sucked until the taste of his climax was nothing more than a weak memory on John's tastebuds. Only then did Sherlock's kisses become more gentle and sensuous, the apparent number of his arms decreased, and John was able to finally take a breath. Sherlock rested his head on John's shoulder with a happy sigh and squirmed around on his lap like a sleepy, well-fed cat.
Mycroft's heart rate shot up, and for a moment he wasn't aware of anything other than Greg, leaning against the desk and letting one hand stroke playfully over his stiff cock. But then he returned to reality with a jerk, remembering who he was and what responsbilities he bore. Although everything in him was screaming for him to go join Greg, he first went to the door of his office, locked it carefully, left the key in the lock and dimmed the lights. He'd been much too careless on this evening already, but he thought he could suppress a few paparazzi photos of the mayor kissing. However, he didn't particularly feel like explaining to the world - and his mother - any images of the mayor having a fuck.
But then John would have more ideas. It wouldn't be long before John wanted to show him the world. A weekend in Paris... a jaunt to New York... holidays in Greece...
"I love you too," Violet said with a tired smile. "I shall always love you." She closed her eyes. It would be the last time.
"First of all, I had no idea what we were walking into," Greg replied as he started binding together the hands and feet of the man in front of them with the cable ties, not making any particular effort to be gentle. It would be virtually impossible for the man to free himself. Greg knew what he was doing. "Second, I don't exactly have six pairs of handcuffs lying around at home. Third..." He hesitated. "If you're not going to let me call the police at all then... it's better to use cable ties than handcuffs. It wouldn't be very bright of me if I had to requisition new handcuffs. Even the dullest copper would put two and two together."
Georg Friedrich Händel: „Largo“ -
John's smile grew broader. "Then you'd better do it as long as you're able to."
"Lucky I haven't taken the lid off yet." The hand disappeared from Sherlock's back, followed by the sound of a loud
"Yes," Sherlock whispered in a combination of meekness, desperation, and arousal.
Sherlock didn't give any sign of having heard John, but inside, he glowed. For the first time in a very long time, he believed it might be the truth.
"Yes," Sherlock said quietly.
Mike goggled at him, but all he said was, "Ah ha."
“So... the auction was also your idea?”
Sherlock felt the blood drain from his face, but he didn't move so much as an inch. "Why?" he asked with a calm he didn't feel.
He placed his tools almost reverently on the table between Sherlock's spread thighs. A paper towel, the disinfectant spray, the lubricant. He lifted the lid of the metal basin and put on the disposable gloves. He reached methodically for Sherlock's half-hard penis, sprayed some of the disinfectant on the head, heard Sherlock inhale sharply, and then wiped it clean with a paper towel and a fiendish grin. John picked up the lubricant, squeezed gently on Sherlock's glans until the opening to his urethra gaped open a bit and dribbled some of the gel inside. Sherlock was panting softly. John could hear the ropes creaking, but Sherlock's lower body remained as immobile as John had planned. With his left hand, he took the thinnest of the metal rods out of the metal dish and held it up over Sherlock's stomach. Only now did he look at Sherlock.
"Great!" the first man exclaimed, rubbing his hands. "I have a couple of fellows who are just itching to be let off their leads."
Had it really just been yesterday? It seemed like a hundred years ago.
WARNING!
He firmly pushed down the fluttery feeling threatening to rise in his stomach. With a certain objective distance, he decided he'd been through worse things in his life than having anal intercourse for the first time.
A knock sounded at the door. John pulled his fingers out, and Sherlock blinked slowly, taking a while to return to reality. Jacques entered a moment later without waiting to be invited. John wiped his fingers calmly on a serviette, which he then dropped onto Sherlock's plate.
"John? You do realise I'm still awake and can hear everything you're saying?" The casual question came from somewhere near John's left nipple, where Sherlock's head was still resting.
"Yeah?" he answered it, his voice gravelly, but the ringing didn't stop. He stared at the phone in confusion.
"Of course I'm all right, why shouldn't I be all right?"
your first... you never would have had all that experience otherwise... all the skills... the ability to command the entire spectrum of pleasure and pain so masterfully... I am the beneficiary of the fact that there were others, and that you could try things out on them and perfect your technique." He scooted closer to John and kissed his scar, following a sudden impulse.
"John, I don't need a pillow," Sherlock protested. "We didn't..."
Mike nodded reluctantly, certain that he was about to be given a watertight argument … and he was right.
"Why?"
"And all this trouble... for that? I mean... you could have just... set yourself up in business as a competitor. Kicked me out. Or simply had me killed."
At the same moment, John Watson was descending the stairs of the brothel as fast as he could. He couldn't stand that lost, empty look in those fascinating, pale eyes for one more second.
"Greg... I shouldn't even be here, by all rights," Mycroft objected. "Are those curtains closed properly?"
"Do that," Moriarty advised him. "Make yourself indispensible."
"Yes, for you," John said, and took a small, flat box out of the breast pocket of his jacket. "But it's not for your finger."
Finally, Mycroft gave in with a quiet sigh. "Some sort of non-aggression pact then?" he asked with a tortured smile. "Peaceful co-existence?"
He seemed to be ashamed of this admission, so John tried to soothe him again. "That will pass... but you really have to relax, or you're going to end up hurting yourself more than I will. You're so bloody tight... If you keep clenching down like this, you're going to crush my finger."
Sherlock, on the other hand, sat as still as a statue. Perhaps a bit pale, but with a completely calm expression. He didn't look at Mike, but rather at John, who in turn only glanced at him quickly before trying to stare Mike right through the floor. Following John's brief look, Sherlock lowered his head again over his papers and kept working.
Sherlock gave the question serious consideration. “Oh, I'd say... if you take all the factors into account, then the chances are one to...”
“Good morning, John,” said he.  “I broke my A.”
“I received a letter yesterday,” I continued conversationally, relieved and happy now the torture had concluded.  “From an old friend of mine, Anstruther, who has a practice newly opened up on Crawford Street.  He has invited me to join him.  I'm currently considering.”
“I compose, from time to time,” said he, looking very pleased.  “Oh John, I wish that you were musical, and that you played piano.  I would buy one, just for you, and then we'd play duets each evening...”  He drifted off into a reverie, a smile upon his face.
I read the paper as I walked.  Some minor scandal as regards a member of parliament, the Hon. Cole Ramsey, held my attention all the way to Scotland Yard.  A misting drizzle had begun as I ducked through the door, and on through the long corridors to where I had to be.  I shook my hat, removed my coat, and thought of Toby as I shuffled through my paperwork.  Two months or more we'd been a pair – if you could call it that – if random trysts could count; if weekend nights and days might tally also; sex, and mainly that, with no complaint.  It had happened very suddenly; in fact, I had despaired of ever finding any solace of that nature, so precarious I thought it, notwithstanding my escapades in my old regiment – but those were different times, of course.  Now throttled up in suits and ties and bowler hats, life seemed a jot more complicated.
Without meaning to, he opened his mouth in both awe and silent horror.
"These are props!" Sherlock exclaimed, pulling out an entire row of false book covers that had been glued together.
"Violet didn't realise she was pregnant until two months after you'd separated," Doris went on, more gently now. "She never intended for you to know."
Lestrade meandered along the Thames with the takeaway coffee he'd just purchased, as he still had a bit of time before his second appointment with the mayor. It had just stopped raining an hour ago for the first time in two weeks, and the wet streets gleamed in the light of the hazy afternoon sun.
More than 24 hours later, John lay in his bed in a multiple stars hotel, completely exhausted and bleary-eyed, yet unable to go to sleep.
"I'll go talk to Miss Adler right afterwards," John murmured into Sherlock's wet curls after what seemed like an eternity.
"Does your leg hurt very much?" John asked, concerned.
Mycroft stared at the proffered arse and swallowed hard. His pulse was racing, his erection was more than happy about the possibilities that were being offered, and yet... there was no way around it - Mycroft was nervous. More nervous than the time he'd had to give his first speech in public. Maybe more nervous than he'd ever been before in his life. It was an extremely unpleasant feeling that bore with it a hint of inadequacy. Even though he wasn't inadequate at all... and never had been! But his hands shook now as he unrolled the condom over his stiff penis and fumbled clumsily with the packet of lube.
Sherlock hesitated for a few seconds before seeming to come to a decision, straightening his shoulders, and rising out of his chair. John watched intently, curious as to what Sherlock was going to do, how he would act, but nothing happened. An odd look had come into Sherlock's eyes, which were peculiar, pale, and incredibly fascinating all at the same time. While a small part of John wondered what that look meant, a much larger part concluded that a quick reminder of why they were both there couldn't hurt.
"Then that makes me the idiot..." John said softly. "Sherlock... you don't need to have sex with me every day... you..." He reached for Sherlock's hands and held them firmly in his. "How often do I have to tell you I'd be lost without you? No matter what the situation... If you want sex, that's fine... but it's not your duty." John stroked the back of Sherlock's hand with his thumb. "Sometimes it's enough for you just to be here."
"It must belong to a very good friend of yours, Mr Watson, if you need to go to such painstaking lengths to ensure your security on his property."
"I'm supposed to ensure that your drug running and weapon smuggling activities aren't brought to the attention of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs?" Mycroft retorted, piqued.
The Highland Games had taken place in Crieff two weeks earlier. Afterwards, the tourists had left and the town had returned to its usual easygoing pace.
A smile flickered across John's lips at Sherlock's halting, tentative answer, and he breathed out another kiss over a different injury on Sherlock's shoulder. Although Sherlock seemed to enjoy it, his posture was still quite stiff.
"Yes, you know," Sherlock explained, all unruffled nonchalance. "To flush out the lower intestine. It's really very important for me and John. And Vaseline. Large quantities. You can get rid of the condoms, though. We won't have any use for them." He gave the maid a fake apologetic look. "You'll have to change the sheets more frequently in future. I hope you have a detergent that can handle semen. If not - I can recommend one to you." Sherlock sent one last look around the assembled company, which was met only with speechlessness. With quiet satisfaction, he gathered the remainder of his pride and swept out of the kitchen.
"Oh." Silence. "When?" he asked quietly. His voice sounded sad.
John blinked in bewilderment and looked around.
Sherlock listened to John's calm, even heartbeat, telling him that John had already fallen back asleep, and whispered softly, "Forever, if you want."
Stamford? Can I bring you something yet?"
"Are you suggesting..."
and the lock sprang open. Without further ado, Sherlock opened the door, only to stop on the threshold in a fit of self-consciousness.
"He won't," Sherlock tried to assure him. "He..."
An injured look came into Sherlock's eyes. "Yes, I've understood. I'm on my own."
"You dirty slag," was John's only comment before he kept moving inside him, and Sherlock knew John didn't mean him.
Just like that afternoon, Sherlock decided to be generous and close the door on the past. John was remodelling his house... for him... for the two of them... John was willing to embark on a new chapter, and Sherlock wanted to do the same. A new start. With a shared bathroom and a shared biscuit.
"It's a good thing you're back. I was just about to call you. Sherlock... Mr Sigerson... he went for a walk about an hour ago and hasn't returned... and we... we're starting to worry." Even as John tried to understand whatever it was that Thomas was telling him, the other man took a deep breath and went on quickly: "He's never left the house before, and now he's been gone so long and didn't say anything to anyone and I..."
"And your bottom?" he heard John ask. "How about sitting?"
"Third floor, boss," Naresh said. He'd talked on the phone to Higgins during the drive over to get more details and assess any potential dangers in the building. Anyone who was responsible for protecting a mob boss couldn't be careful enough when it came to such things. "Lift doesn't work, unfortunately. There's a reason the construction company went belly up."
When he realised that, he felt reality slowly returning to his brain and sinking into his body. He was dumbfounded to find he was holding something in his hand. When he saw it was his own loaded gun with the safety off – and that it was aimed at Sherlock – he was horrified at himself.
Occasionally, he'd eye Sherlock's plate to monitor what all he'd eaten. On his better days, Sherlock remembered to at least nibble on an apple or a bag of crisps. Once a case was involved, or if he was having a bit of a tantrum, it was as if he only ate when the growling of his stomach became too distracting.  Unfortunately for both of them, Sherlock was in the middle of the later.
" Please do. You look exhausted."
Day in and day out, blood seemed to be all he saw. It's to be expected, given his line of work, but seeing it come out of his patients was one thing. Seeing it on himself afterwards was a different matter.
" No, not really."
His parents used to take Harry and him there during the Summer, often for several weeks at a time. They loved it, but his mother always had her complaints. The property they rented didn't have a washer or dryer for the longest time, as the owners refused to make any renovations to their out-dated cabin. Even most of the light fixtures inside were kerosene lamps or wall-mounted candles. They'd finally caved and had a washing machine installed in the basement (alongside a few fluorescents), but that was it. John's poor mother had to dry their clothes on a line every time they visited.
He leaned further towards his side of the car, his elbow still in John's side as he fumbled for something in his pocket.
" Please... what are you going on about?"
John could practically feel the question in the air, but he wasn't sure why Sherlock was hesitant to ask it. He turned fully to face him, his eyebrows knitting together.
For particularly good episodes, John would even stop himself from immediately clocking out so the pair could pass a few jokes back and forth. He would lay back and soak in Sherlock's laughs, a welcome feeling settling over him. Their Research Nights were quickly becoming one of his favourite things, extending past even his original intentions.
John had managed to stave off sleep for roughly that same amount of time. And three days, John learned, could feel like an eternity. When he wasn't busying himself with 8-hour shifts at the surgery, or helping Molly to finally put the London Lobotomer (as the press had dubbed him) in cuffs, he was doing whatever he could to keep himself moving.
" No."
John broke his gaze with a scowl. He didn't have to look to know Sherlock had a triumphant little smirk on his lips.
-Butter
" I'm considering it, yes. I just need more details before I can be sure, though."
Half a dozen drains were lined up on the floors, an examination table accompanying each one. Medical scales were scattered here and there by some cupboards, along with the occasional bone saw or pair of rib shears. The attending, who was standing by the counters, was unpackaging new specimen cups and scalpels.
-Coffee Beans
" I know you felt it the moment you walked in- the urge to run. A guilty conscience can be overpowering like that, so I figured this would be a good way to keep you here- " Dr Graham nudged her head towards the bodies.
-Milk
All he could remember was the ocean, perhaps even the hint of someone whispering, which could only mean one thing.
He tossed the sheets off his body, haphazardly swinging his legs over the side of the bed. He sat
" But I'm not. The brain is a muscle at the end of the day- if you neglect to use it, atrophy is destined to set in."
" Who?"
" Perhaps Molly could sneak me a few femurs from the morgue. I've been meaning to observe how long it takes for fire to begin splitting the bone..." he murmured to himself.
Sherlock smirked to himself, his phone now in his grasp as his thumbs rapidly danced across his screen. John rolled his eyes in response, the corner of his lips turning up.
The sound of a refrigerator being shut.
" Is everything alright?"
Sherlock crossed the room in three strides, mumbling the address of the store to himself as he reached to grab his coat and scarf off the coat hook. John's knee-jerk reaction was to be annoyed. He figured with all the potential clients piling up in their inbox, Sherlock could have been making better use of their time. If he was as bored as he claimed, taking a few cases he considered to be a little dull should've been enough to remedy the situation.
Or maybe he should've even tried to tune out Sherlock's voice, his incoherent mumblings acting as a constant source of... solace, almost. A deep-pitched anchor that was constantly present, no matter where his mind wandered.
" Although it was forecasted otherwise, the clouds are telling me so. Just look at them."
" Are you sure? Because you know you can talk to me about anything, right? Nothing will leave this room if you don't want it to."
John knew for sure his friend had hardly even looked at the pad thai they'd ordered for dinner last night. Breakfast seemed as though it would be going the same route, as so far his meagre piece of toast was left untouched.
" Think of it as a vacation, then. And if it really does get that dull, you can always pick up more shifts at the surgery. It's fairly obvious the manager fancies you, so I'm sure she'd be more than happy to pencil you in somewhere."
" Well, there's no getting out of it this time. There's too much evidence piling up. Anderson will have no choice other than to take him into custody."
He resumed his examination of the ceiling, noting a few faded smoke stains here and there, as he half-listened to Sherlock's soft ramblings.
" Is anything wrong, Molly?"
John found himself groggily opening his eyes in the brightly-lit flat. He quickly threw up a hand to block the sun streaming in from the living room windows, the bright light sending spots dancing across his vision. Morning came quicker than it usually did, it felt like. He'd somehow slipped off during the night, though he couldn't recall much of a dream...
John crossed his arms, the frown on his face deepening. Sherlock was right, of course. Splitting up was nothing new to the pair. They often did when cases were piling up, or if one of them was sick, or for a scenario where Sherlock stubbornly refused to leave the flat. As far as Sherlock was concerned, there was no reason why it would be problematic.
1 new message: Unknown
What he wouldn't give to be stuck on suture duty for the week, instead.
But John couldn't find it in him to care.
" John. We're here."
Sherlock ignored him, the gloomy air around him seeming to darken. After a few moments, he spoke again
Before he could even finish the sentence, the phone lit up again.
" But it was the right one, not the left," he said softly to himself, his fingers going still.
" It is dreadfully boring in this flat, wouldn't you agree?"
John fought back the lump in his throat and swallowed hard.
A sharp inhale pulled him out of his thoughts. He turned to face the source of it, only to see Sherlock staring straight ahead, his eyes suddenly open.
"Anyhow, I'd better get going."
" That's what has him in such a stir... so his next step was to get in touch with you?"
" What's up?"
" Encouragement."
" I'm sorry," John's voice was thick, it's uneven timbre echoing back at him.
Two had been opened. The occupants had been rolled out of the freezer, their bodies unceremoniously concealed with grey tarps. An especially shoddy job had been done covering the body closest to John- the tips of their fingers greeted him from the corner of a tarp. A chill shot down John's spine as he turned to give his full attention to the woman with him.
" Oh, it's not that big of a deal. I just need to start incorporating more potassium is all... were you really that concerned?"
" I've already told you why. Besides, accepting the whole lobotomy situation was your idea. I found the affair to be entirely stale."
" Perhaps."
Sherlock warmed up to The Office in a remarkably short amount of time. Rather than muttering under his breath for most of it, he actually gave it a chuckle every now and then. The sound was a deep rumble that seemed to roll through the whole couch and ricochet through John's arm or leg or whatever was pressed closest to the man. It was a sound John had only scarcely heard before, but one he quickly grew to enjoy.
" Watching an office marathon sounds even more tedious than learning to knit."
He slowly propped himself up, stretching out his arm to retrieve the phone with a groan. The first few notifications were from Sherlock's mother. She'd sent a few photos of Rosie running through her back garden, absolutely covered in mud.
Sherlock eyed John, his expression dropping ever so slightly.
" Took Lestrade long enough," he said, a smile spreading across his face.
The lakeside.
Or so he thought.
" Oh goodness. You can't be serious."
John gave her a wry smile, taking a sip from the coffee in his thermos before leaving the room. He'd much rather be able to relay Molly's message in person, but he still had quite a bit of waiting to do. The consulting detective had been absent for only three days.
"Oh, that..." John chewed on the inside of his cheek and grinned. "That was to pass the time and prove something to someone." But before Sherlock could comment on that, he turned on his heel and went out the door.
John's hands wrapped around Sherlock's throat with an iron grip. Sherlock's fingers immediately caught John's wrists in order to prevent the worst from happening. But John didn't squeeze. He just held him there, showing no mercy. It seemed as if everything were frozen in place until John said, his voice broken, "Why... don't you just end it... put an end to it... Why don't you fight back? Why the hell aren't you fighting back?!" And Sherlock knew that John really did want Sherlock to fight back, to stand his ground against him, to use his safeword, to put up some sort of resistance... no matter how or what, as long as Sherlock didn't just let John do whatever he wanted. But that was precisely what Sherlock planned to do, and what he was doing right now. He was giving John free rein.
Sherlock blinked several times in a row before turning his head to look at Mike.
John didn't need to be told again. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, he drove the sound into Sherlock's hard, twitching penis, pulling it out at the same speed. Over and over again.
'. It was '
Mycroft didn't answer at first, and Sherlock listened to his silence with a mild bewilderment that increased the longer it lasted.
Ella shot him a cool look and tapped her pen against her paper. John hated when she did that.
"NO, JOHN!" she cut him off rudely, and John could hear her heavy breaths. "I don't want to hear one single word out of you. You're going to keep your mouth shut and listen to what I have to say," she went on. It was clear she was having trouble controlling herself, and John was just glad she'd called rather than seeking him out in person.
"Where to?" Sherlock asked, although he allowed himself to be led by the hand down the hall in an unusual display of compliance.
"No bloody way," Greg answered emphatically, taking a sip from the second cup. "Forget it, Mycroft. That's sure to be some posh gaff. I can't afford it."
“Oh no, my dear,” he scolded playfully. “No big words for such a tiny, ridiculous appendage. “Say: I make wee-wee with my little weenie...”
I hope you all won't hate me too much for this chapter. It contains a scene that I wouldn't call non-con but it is bordering on dub-con. So... that said... enter at your own risk.
"This..." he said calmly. He took a long puff from the cigar but didn't release the smoke from his mouth, instead keeping his lips together.
His breath caught for a moment as he admired the image on the screen. He straightened up a bit and felt for the handle of the plug with his right hand. His fingers touched the engraving, and he closed his eyes with a deep, heart-felt sigh.
"You can whistle yourself if you like it so much," John retorted and picked up his shower gel. He wasn't exactly embarrassed to whistle in front of other people - it was more that he didn't even really want to whistle, yet recently, he caught himself more and more almost unconsciously whistling some tune or other. Whistling opera music was inseparably associated with another time for him. A time when he'd been happy. Happy, a little ignorant, and very much in love. In other words: his time with Victor. But then Victor had broken his heart and his memories of that time had become unbearable. Whenever he started to purse his lips to make a sound, everything came back, including the pain - and, if he were honest, the thirst for revenge. And that pain ruined any pleasure he took in his current life, which wasn't so bad, actually; in fact, it was going better than he'd ever thought possible.
A vague smile passed across the other man's face. "Call me Sergeij," he said, taking a seat across from Patrick.
"You are the most incredible, fascinating, wonderful man I've ever met." As soon as John heard himself say those last words, he had the urge to wish he'd never said them.
The feeling was like a steady throbbing, as if all the energy were flowing out of his body. It was an indescribably intense feeling, and yet it wasn't quite enough.
Naturally, the topic had come up more than once in the meantime, and they'd talked about it... what had occurred... they'd discussed the events themselves... but they'd never discussed what had really happened
"How about you?" Greg asked impulsively without even thinking about it. "What would your Sunday have looked like? There must be someone waiting for you..." It was at this point that he suddenly realised how little he knew about the mayor's private life, and how oddly silent the boulevard press was on the topic, whereas any other public personality would have been the subject of countless insider interviews and revealing stories. But on Mycroft Holmes... nothing. No juicy details about his parents, his love affairs, or … his brother.
"Oh, that's easy.
His muscles cramped up... his thighs trembled... the exquisite torment of the piece of metal in his erect penis... the unrelenting stimulation of his prostate... He felt his muscles shaking, convulsing, pulsing around John's cock, and then John plunged in once more, driving his erection mercilessly across the erogenous zone deep inside him... once... twice... three times... Sherlock's testicles contracted... more... tighter... Sherlock heard himself screaming as if through a fog... and then... for the fraction of a second... Nothing... complete emptiness... utter detachment... then... something clicked in him... and... he
once more. And so John got a handle on his facial muscles, pursed his lips, acted as if he were giving Sherlock's request – no, his command – serious consideration, and then withdrew his cock entirely.
Mike reached greedily for the almond biscuit on his saucer and stuffed it into his mouth before taking the first sip of his coffee, sighing contentedly. It had been a while since they'd had coffee together. They hadn't worked such long hours recently that they'd needed coffee to stay awake, or else they'd been out of the house. Mike eyed the biscuit on John's saucer with a covetous eye (Jacques was remarkably stingy with those biscuits), and then he noticed: the cup that Jacques brought to Sherlock didn't have a biscuit with it.
Yes, he could have had it that way all along. Right from the beginning. Why hadn't he thought of it before?
And the most important question: will they say those three little words and will there be a marriage proposal?
“John – really. I can't. There's just no way.”
"Passports?" Sherlock repeated blankly. "More than one?"
Sherlock stuck his chin out defiantly, but despite his belligerent attitude, John saw the moisture glittering in his pale eyes.
"I assume as a lowly cocksucker you haven't been earning enough to work off your debt with Miss Adler, am I right?" John used the indelicate term deliberately, in order to remind Sherlock of his place; not that he should get the idea into his head that they were equals or something.
Gentle hands moved over his back, his arse, his thighs - inflaming his desire and at the same time torturing him with their tenderness. He still felt John, huge and hard inside him, felt the material of John's trousers (he was - as usual - still almost entirely clothed) against his legs, but John held himself completely still. Sherlock couldn't entirely suppress a rather pitiful whimper.
They were lying in bed together, with Sherlock on his stomach in order to spare his bottom, which was still sore and red where John had hit him with the riding crop – even if he was quite enjoying the throbbing echo of the pain. His head was resting half on John's shoulder, and his fingers inscribed circles around John's scar.
"Episode? Mycroft - stop speaking in riddles."
"Thank God," he heard Mike say, his voice muffled. "Okay - then open this bloody door so I can see for myself."
"And what should I do with Albright's body?" Moran asked.
"Oh?" John prompted.
They went down the hall past several doors, behind which Sherlock supposed were the other - currently unused - guest bedrooms.
"Yeah, I'm afraid I would have," John conceded before joining in Sherlock's liberating laughter. With every giggle, the pressure in his chest abated and the shock that had held him firmly in its claws since those two shots seeped out of his body.
John was a good chess player. He could calculate moves ahead of time, he was good at judging his opponent and was usually several steps ahead of him.
"A pay rise? Anything else?" Mike exclaimed. He was starting to get worked up, but calmed himself again in the face of Sherlock's unusually stern glare. "All right, fine. So I'll hire him back. But you're the one who's going to tell John about it. It's on your head."
"You never should have married," Mycroft pointed out, somewhat brusquely.
"Because we still have work to do," John said firmly - although it took all his willpower to push Sherlock away.
"What?!" John said.
"You didn't seriously think we'd do that
Aaaaaannnnnd: PICS!
"No, wear the golden plug, all right?" John told him.
Mike could only shake his head at such twisted devotion. Here lay Sherlock, in obvious pain, and he was defending the person who’d put him there... while John - just downstairs - was doing exactly the same thing for him. On the one hand, it was rather heartwarming, the way the two of them stood up for each other... but on the other hand, it was so cheesy it made Mike want to vomit.
. “Friday looks a lot better … I could...”
"Doc! What are you doing here? Today's..." she called out without thinking, before biting her tongue.
Translation by the talented
John's eyebrows drew together. "The bombers used their clothes to disguise themselves as employees... we need descriptions of those two men."
"Cheers, mate," Patrick said, raising his glass to him. "Moller... Molinay..." he mused out loud. "No, that wasn't it... Something like... AH! Moriarty! Jim Moriarty. Man, was he a swot. Always had his nose in some book or other. No idea what that totty saw in him."
"Right. That's exactly what it's for. And? Do you want to? Okay, you're shaking your head. That's what I thought. It won't take much longer... Just a little more... hmmm... yeah. See? Wasn't
The flaring nostrils were the only sign that Sherlock was aware he was no longer alone. His eyes remained fixed on an imaginary point somewhere just short of the ceiling.
John shrugged once again. "I know. What can I say? For some inexplicable reason, I've taken a fancy to you," he said lightly before taking a deep breath. "Aren't you the least bit curious what your reward might be?"
" As long as it takes. I'll try to keep in touch where I can, but there are no guarantees I'll be able to."
Sherlock looked at him and John looked back, trying and failing to keep a stony face. It was hard to keep it up for very long, especially when Sherlock's sharp eyes felt like they were peering into his very soul.
He shook his head, getting to his feet as he reached for the robe draped over his bedpost.
" Sherlock doesn't normally bother with the paperwork, you really think he'd want it?"
" Don't try to change the subject-"
He was still awake, then.
" Special instructions aside, leaving bodies out to rot probably breaks some sort of basic procedure."
John was cut off by a raised hand.
" No, they wouldn't."
" Eat your toast before you start thinking. Didn't you say digestion meddles with-"
" Do you know how many seasons this show has? It's going to take you a lot longer than a week or two to get through the whole thing, especially at this rate. We could be calling back some of the people who have reached out to us, or checking in on past clients, or really anything else more productive. Do you think this is the best course of action?"
-Earl Grey (Loose leaf. Enough with the bags.-SH)
" Look, if this is your odd way of asking me to add bananas to the shopping list-"
" He prefaced the phone call with some intriguing text messages, so of course I had to pick up. Apparently, the crown has found themselves in a bit of hot water again. Mycroft doesn't have the time nor patience to sort it out himself."
" Not at this rate you won't. It's getting cold."
He'd hardly consider his surroundings jarring, by any means. No, they were relatively tame... so what was it? What was so different this go around?
John collected his things before getting up from his seat, bowing his head as he headed towards the door.
He'd just started knuckling the sleep out of his eyes, vaguely wondering where the throw pillow under his head came from, before a buzz sounded from his pocket.
It wouldn't be a permanent fix, of course, but it would do the job for a few days at most. Throw in only one or two bad nights and Sherlock would be back before he knew it. He could get through this.
No, it was breathing. And not his own breathing either, but rather someone else's.
" I'm honestly surprised they let that slide. And goodness, lifting the prints on the screwdriver was a nightmare. He did a shoddy job cleaning up, but it was enough to botch the results. It dragged all of this out way longer than necessary."
Dr Graham lapsed into silence as she craned her neck to steal a peek at her abandoned chart.
" I will."
" Not for today, I'm afraid. I was given special instructions for your time down here."
John knew that would be the end of any conversation for some time, as Sherlock tended to get quite occupied when he was 'downloading' information.
" Huh? Why?"
" It's too late for that. I need to start researching as soon as possible."
" Now remove the tarp, John."
" It wasn't my decision. I made my opinion on the situation quite clear over the phone, but he's set on it. If I bring you, I don't get the case."
John's door swung open, revealing the smiling face of their ageing driver.
He rolled his eyes as he grudgingly leaned over John to pick up the phone, impatiently scanning the screen once it was in his hands. Suddenly, he grew attentive and he began reading in earnest, slowly sitting up in his seat.
He let out a defeated sigh, not even bothering to double-check the kitchen. He'd just finished up in there before heading out to meet Molly. The coffee beans he'd bought now had a jar by the grinder, the bottom of the sink was actually visible, even all of Sherlock's lab equipment was labelled and tucked neatly away in an empty cupboard.
He could feel Sherlock shift slightly beside him.
John glanced up from the paper in his hands, his gaze settling on Sherlock. He stood motionless by the window, watching the foot traffic just outside their flat with a hand on his chin. He tended to gravitate there when he was thinking, so it wasn't too out of the unordinary for him to blankly people-watch for extended periods.
" This morning in the kitchen," he started suddenly.
What made this instance any different?
He just had to get it off.
" ... Me?"
He grit his teeth, a natural-sounding chuckle still managing to work its way through them as he turned back to face her.
With that, he got to his feet and made his way towards his bedroom, bringing the phone to his ear just as the ringer started to go off.
Looking back on those trips as an adult, it was easy for him to understand why her expression was always so sour on the drive up.
He forced his legs to move forward, sweat starting to bead on his forehead. As he got closer to the tarps, the smell got stronger. He had to stop himself from reacting to it, biting the inside of his cheek to avoid any involuntary noises.
" Hush. We hardly use the fridge, anyway."
" And that would be... ?"
" Do join me, Watson. You're hardly three steps in the room."
" Oh. Right, right. Let's move along then."
He glanced out the window blankly.
" Are you alright, John?"
" Yeah, I'm fine."
He pushed even harder, ignoring his protesting fingers and his rapidly bluing lips.
John glanced around the flat as if the walls held an answer to his dilemma. He looked to his right and eyed the wrecked kitchen, his gaze slowly settling on the electric grinder on the counter. An idea popped in his head, one he didn't like, but couldn't necessarily dismiss.
-Deionized water
John scowled to himself.
" You still have those? I thought I told you to take them out of the fridge!"
He hurriedly thrust his arms shoulder-deep into the frigid water, ignoring the trembling in his limbs as he frantically scrubbed at them with his knuckles. He watched with a morbid sense of relief as the water around him slowly turned pink, the hue growing darker and darker with every second his sleeves stayed submerged.
He gave it a particularly hard look as it went off again before looking at Sherlock. His friend's eyes were still intensely focused on the TV screen, his hands flying over the keyboard in his lap.
" I know. But really, I'm fine. I've just been having some trouble sleeping, lately. That's it."
John exited the car, thanking the man as he went, Sherlock following suit not too long after. He soon found himself struggling to keep up with the detective as they made their way towards the crime scene, his shorter stature no match for the man's long strides. It didn't help that he seemed to get quicker and quicker the closer they got to the building.
" What?"
" How much longer do you think it'll take us to get to Grendell?"
He wasn't sure.
After refilling the jar with freshly ground coffee, John abandoned his coat on top of his armchair and shuffled into his room. He grudgingly laid out on the bed, plucking up the newspaper resting on his nightstand.
Just like last time- no carnage, no bloodshed. John meandered out of the car, blindly giving the driver an appreciative wave. He paused briefly to knuckle the sleep out of his eyes.
Sherlock seemed to consider the proposal for a moment.
John stared at her for a moment, his tongue resting heavily in his mouth. Finally, he nodded.
John looked over at him, his eyebrows raised.
Several minutes had passed before Sherlock meandered down the stairs, plopping himself back down in his spot on the couch. He didn't have to say or do anything for John to notice a stark change in his attitude. The whole flat's atmosphere had changed- it was excited but also dampened. Like a firework had been ignited in a thick fog.
" I'm... shouldn't those be closed? It seems like they've been out for a while."
The phone buzzed noisily against the coffee table as if to prove him wrong. He sat up from his spot on the couch, now thoroughly annoyed.
He quickly retracted his hand, the hairs on his neck standing at attention.
" Right."
" What's that?"
He eyed his bedroom door wearily, letting out a defeated sigh. He'd have to face sleep all on his own, which certainly entailed more nightmares. The thought was almost too much to bear. The Research Nights were working splendidly, but he never stopped to consider what to do in the instances where Sherlock had to leave. He desperately needed a course of action. And fast.
John grumbled under his breath as he opened up the paper once more, burying himself in a story he had zero interest in. As soon as he heard Sherlock pluck up his toast and head out the front door, however, his frown dropped.
He had reduced his sleeves to tatters, but couldn't seem to stop. He continued to scour his own forearms, feeling his nails tear into his flesh over and over. None of his efforts seemed to make a difference.
He turned his gaze to the alarm clock on his nightstand, his throat still tight as he gradually got his breathing under control. Every time the 03:04 flashed back at him, he could feel his heart sink a little deeper in his chest.
" I'm quite certain, yes."
" Come on Sherlock, you can't be serious."
No amount of washing would do anything to remedy the ever-growing stains on his hands.
" Is that really all that's going on here?"
" I'd suggest giving melatonin pills a try. I used them when I couldn't sleep during my exam seasons, they do the trick."
John's surroundings faded rather quickly and he felt his eyes flutter open, revealing the darkened sitting room of the flat. Not too long after, he could hear the muffled sound of a bedroom door being closed upstairs.
" John."
" Yes- I'm right behind you!"
" Eat something," he said, not looking up from his paper.
John smiled to himself before releasing the sheet, stooping down to pluck up a stone from the ground. He ran his fingers across it, taking note of the grooves in its smooth surface. He might not have been able to see, but that didn't phase him- if anything, it only added to the experience.
John got up from his stool and shrugged on his coat, shooting Molly a smile.
" For sure. Get some rest tonight, okay? And if you get the chance, let Sherlock know I've got a drowning victim waiting for him when he gets back."
" For how long?"
John gave up on his paper and lowered it on the table, running a hand through his short hair.
He wouldn't stop until it was completely gone, even if it meant stripping himself to the bone.
" Hmm."
He will be no longer than a week.
" It would've been rude to refuse."
He successfully made four dishes before deciding to give it a rest; nodding off by the stove wasn't exactly the safest thing to do while cooking.
He dragged a hand across his haggard face before propping his pillow up behind him, settling back on it as he gazed up at the ceiling blankly. He used to pass the time by conjuring up pictures with the cracks and chips in the off-white paint, making brilliant scenes of things like twisting trees or ladies with billowing skirts.
" It's only been one day since our last case. Stop moping and eat your breakfast."
" Why?"
While that was certainly well and good, it wasn't the only positive thing he noticed.
Speaking of which, the last thing he needed was to sit on the couch and do nothing. He wasn't exactly well-rested, so he'd surely fall asleep. Sleep meant nightmares and nightmares were something he didn't want to put up with-
John was interrupted by a sharp ping from Sherlock's phone. The man quickly snatched it up, their conversation left forgotten as he read a text.
" Six hours," John remarked softly to himself, perching on the edge of his bed.
John, on the contrary, couldn't help but shoot it a dirty look every now and then. He seemed to be right on the edge of sleep every time Sherlock got a notification. The abrupt noise would make his fingernails dig into the palms of his hands, his eyes opening with a start. Just as he wound back down, the ghost of a dream beginning to start up, the cycle would repeat.
" Actually John, could I, erm... could I talk with you before you leave?"
As John walked into the flat, his eyes dragged themselves across the living room. It was as spotless as he had ever seen it. The rug had long since been taken outside and beaten, not a spec of dirt clinging to it. The floors had already been swept and scrubbed twice, and there wasn't a single cobweb left clinging to the curtains.
" It had to be black mould, of course," he muttered to himself.
" Well, you see... it's... gosh, I've been trying to get it out the whole time you've been here."
" Yes. For a little while, you haven't really seemed yourself. These past few days, especially. You're more sluggish, and quiet, and not very John Watson at all, if I'm being honest."
John chuckled to himself, resting his hands in his pockets.
John could feel the blood rapidly draining from his face. He slowly raked a hand through his hair, his gaze frozen on the attending- Dr Graham, her name tag read. It took him a moment to find his voice.
Besides, he didn't need to see to know where he was. This wasn't another faceless beach or somewhere he'd never been. No, he'd been here before. Many, many times.
" You're more educated on these matters than I am, so you could be of assistance," he said.
" Irrelevant question, we're researching right now."
" What? No, no, nothing's wrong with me. I was just wondering-"
Regardless of what he should've done, John Watson was sure of only one thing. One minute he was staring at the ceiling, listening as the first sign of rain gently patted across the car's windshield. By the next, everything seemed to have long since melted into darkness.
Sherlock opted to press play instead of answering his question, leaving a fuming John Watson beside him on the couch. As they progressed into the first episode, however, John couldn't find it in him to stay mad. The near-constant staccato of Sherlock's fingers tapping across his keyboard and the consistent grumbles under his breath ('Good God, the humour is dry', 'I can see why the first season wasn't so acclaimed by audience members', etc.) were music to his ears. He was struggling to keep his eyes open, his head resting heavily on the couch cushion he had his arms wrapped around. By the time the second episode started up, John was already quietly dozing off.
John sat up, one hand bracing itself on his knee while the other dragged across his face. Sherlock would be gone.
Sherlock turned to look back at the window, his fingers now steepled beneath his chin. He was actually contemplating something, John realized. Somehow their brief discussion on the TV show had gotten the gears turning.
He sat up in a daze, once again from Sherlock's shoulder, dragging his hand across his face. His fingers grazed over his cheek, the folds in Sherlock's coat imprinted on his skin.
" I guess I can't say I'm honestly surprised."
" Good."
" Okay, okay. Bad idea. Why not watch some telly? I heard they're in the middle of an Office marathon."
" Nothing, nothing. I'm just thinking about the case- a woman drowning on dry land is something worth mulling over, wouldn't you agree?"
" There's supposed to be educational value in your time down here, John."
The wall to his left held the morgue's refrigerated storage. Most of the doors were closed, thank goodness, but not all.
" Then Sherlock's home."
He did his best to still his fingers before jumping into a story about a warehouse fire, his eyes glazing over more and more with every line they passed.
She merely shrugged her shoulders.
The third and final kind of busywork he'd found for himself had been cleaning.
A coffin of someone he couldn't save.
" He says he can smell the defeat in Anderson's words every time he admits to being wrong about something. He gets deep satisfaction from it, I suppose." John shook his head.
" Wait a minute. You mean to tell me you've never watched The Office?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes, a smirk just hinting at the corners of his lips, before turning his attention back to the TV and unpausing the episode.
His raw fingers pulsed in protest as he finally lifted his arms up to inspect them, a shaky sigh escaping his lips as he saw all the stains on his sleeves were gone. He took the time to peel off the latex gloves he'd also neglected to take off, letting them sink below the crimson surface of the lake. As he watched them slowly drift further and further down, he could feel his chin begin to tremble and his eyes started to burn with unshed tears.
“Holmes,” I said again.
“That was quite fair,” said Sherlock Holmes.
“I shall not drag him anywhere.  I think you underestimate my feeling in this matter.”
“Off!” I said.  “Off with your jacket.”
He winced.  “I mean, you state the obvious.”
“Well, then,” said Mycroft Holmes.  “I think that's Newton, and his sister Alice, too, who've just come in.  That's nearly everyone.  Do please excuse me.  Eva?  Will you?”
“Meanwhile, Stone wrote the note, pretending it from Barker, and packed the skull to deliver it to Dawkins' Curiosity Bizarre.  He made no mention of this to Barker in her revised hypnotic state.  Perhaps he did not think it of importance.  The result of this, of course, was that Mrs. Barker appeared forgetful and defensive and unsure, and so incriminating herself.”
There are at least a dozen things that I wish to do to him this minute.  Ten of which involve my tongue.
“Thank you,” I said.  “Would you please let me read it?”
The cab ride was swift, taking just fifteen minutes.  Peregrine Way is a three-storied terrace row of modern red-brick and wrought iron.  Neither overly well-to-do nor in the less thought-of locales, it maintains a pleasant aspect.  A gaggle of curious souls from the street had collected outside number nine.  All talking in unison, and no doubt distracting the constable at sentry by the black-painted door.  The curtains on the ground floor were still drawn; the first floor likewise.  The top level of the house had all drapes parted, one window raised.
“And it's
.  I turned the card over to see who it was from: a scrawled name, quite illegible.
“You know,” said Holmes, “this cannot be much good for the digestion.”
He smirked.  “That's what
“I've thought of you all day.”
.”  He tutted.
“Wait here, John,” said he, “I shall be just a few minutes.”
“You would ask for my help?”
“The baize is old.  The table is uneven,” I said, sulking.
“Alas, no.”
And he stood, still holding on, 'til we were near to eye-to-eye.  As near to it as I may ever be.  For I am five inches shorter at the least.
I frowned, my feelings a little hurt by his reluctance to share his great intrigue.  “Well then, is it for a case?”
“And then?”
“Well, yes.”
But oh, my goodness, how to make it through tonight, without combusting?
I had no explanation.  I arose and studied my reflection in my dressing table mirror.
I watched him as he sipped daintily at his tea.  His hair, cut quite shorter, was drying already.  A small, errant lock curled down on his forehead.
“All right,” I said.  I waited, patiently.
“What?” I enquired, confused.  “What is it?  Do I have jam on my chin?”  I rubbed with a finger.
“Done?”
Upon the odd occasion, it was the habit of our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, to refurbish and redecorate our rooms to some degree.  Whether a freshening of the paint, or of the wallpaper at the landing, we bore these changes fairly stoically for the most part.  Left to our own devices, I knew full well that we would alter precisely nothing; would be content with living adjacent to the same tattered rugs and curtains, with jaded paints and paper coverings, until their ultimate decay.  And I doubt – even then – if we should notice.
The housekeeper clapped both her hands to her face.  “Oh!” she gasped softly, rocking forward and back in her chair.  “Oh!  Oh!  The skull!”
Holmes manoeuvred his lean frame into the upright.  He rummaged in his pocket for his silver cigarette case, which he snapped open and, with long thin fingers, selected a tight roll.  He lit it, leaning back, his nostrils flaring acrid smoke.  “That is
I watched him as he bustled, moving books and binding papers.  Seventeen years! – as Holmes had just brought to the forefront of my mind.  Seventeen years, this blissful state, evolving, never static, though it might drive me to my limits, sometimes, often.
“It's just his way,” said Mrs. Hudson.  “When you come to know him better, then you'll understand.”  She laughed again on seeing my expression.  “Now, would you like a cup of tea, or have you other calls to make?”
“John, mind your boots,” said Holmes, side-stepping.  He pulled his watch out from his pocket and frowned at the time.  “Well, we should get back to the task at hand – which is
“My name is Sherlock Holmes,” said he.  “Perhaps you are aware.”
And ten o'clock came, and we cut off into pairs, and Mycroft went over the rules, and we were handed a small basket, and then the game began.  An egg hunt.  On a Saturday.  In June.
“That is not very likely to happen,” said Holmes.  His tone was now uncertain.  “What is it you are trying to tell me?  That I have shaved my legs for nothing?”
“Are you Mr. Dawkins?” my friend enquired.
“So the man is either a sot or a lunatic,” I said.  “And he believes in his dreams.  That is a great shame, Holmes; I was so hoping for an interesting case.”
, rather appropriately enough.  An adolescent birthday gift to me from my late brother.  I examined the flyleaf, a yellowing page.  His inscription upon it, in a featherweight scrawl:
Sherlock Holmes lit his pipe while I all but hopped in impatience.  He leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, closed his eyes and began.
“I wonder,” said he.  “I wonder.”  Then, with a sudden seeming realisation:  “The one place that I did not think to look!  John!  I am a fool.”
“Give me a minute.  Yes.”  He lifted up, and lowered himself down experimentally.  “Oh,
Mr. Dawkins smiled as he polished.  “Ah no, sir, 'tis but paralytic polio in my right leg, back from when I was a lad.  Feel free to take a look around the shop, sir.  Always happy to help.”
I waited.
“What on earth is going on?” I said, frowning at the lines of type.
“I doubt it, Mycroft,” said my friend.  He hauled me upwards to the Green Room, where we set to with a bowl of soapy water and a sponge.  When we had made ourselves presentable once more, we traipsed back downstairs to the drawing room, where Adams was now sitting by the window, deep in thought.  We made him jump, a little, at our entrance, but he greeted us quite cheerfully.
