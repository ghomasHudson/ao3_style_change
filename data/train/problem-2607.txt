The tension on Sherlock’s face cleared immediately. This was a question he could answer definitively and with ease. “Eighty-four female partners and one hundred seventeen male partners. Men are definitely the easier conquest.”
Mycroft considered. “As you know from the Eurus debacle, Sherlock was emotionally tortured by our sister. It changed him, made him lock his emotions away, and, fool that I am, I encouraged him to do so—to deride sentiment and suppress his emotions. That does not mean he no longer possesses them. If Sherlock loves anything in this world, it is you, John, you and Rosie... Good day to you, doctor,” Mycroft said as he turned and began walking down the concrete path, the tip of his umbrella tapping out a sharp cadence to his footsteps as he slowly disappeared from sight.
“She asked what she could do,” Clara sobbed openly now, pressing her damp face against her brother-in-law’s sodden shoulder. “And I told her I didn’t care…that I didn’t fucking care if she lived or died. I left her like that. My last words to her,” Clara said softly as she sat back and sniffled, rubbing the now soaked tissue over her face.
“What about the burns on the third victim and the bleach poured in the eyes of the first victim?” Donovan interjected.
Something raw and animalistic and primal screamed and clawed wildly in resplendent satisfaction deep in John’s hindbrain, and he felt more than heard a long, drawn out shout in Sherlock’s deep baritone, the reverberations heard on his taut skin—his senses so aroused and confused he could smell colors and taste music—the low tenor sax steadily playing its accompaniment to their lovemaking tasted of warm, sticky cinnamon buns; each of these sensations was closely followed by the tightening of hands on his hips and a flood of molten liquid deep inside that made things even more squishy squelchy than they had been before.
“Mmmmm…yes,” John moaned softly into the gentle, sucking kisses, realizing immediately that while Sherlock had used the same words, the nuances were different, creating an entirely different question. It dawned on him vaguely as Sherlock sent questing fingers under his jumper that it had been close to a week since Big Brain and The Hard Drive had had their necessary re-boots. While John had been incredibly stressed this past week with funeral arrangements and such, physical intimacy between the two of them had been mostly non-existent. He was almost surprised, in a way, to realize that he needed this as much as Sherlock did, maybe more.
“Guilt, mostly,” John answered mildly.
“Hullo,” John mumbled through a sleep slackened throat.
“Oh my God,” John murmured as he headed for the stairs, Sherlock right behind him. “I’m on my way. If anything changes, please call me right away.” They said their goodbyes quickly as Sherlock locked the door behind them. John silently thanked whatever deities were listening that Sherlock could almost magically hail a taxi even at three in the bloody morning.
Sherlock began flipping through additional photos, but these were screen shots taken from a computer.
Step 2 Continued: Additional Background Information Required
“John, I offered you a cheque…”
“You’re right,” he conceded. “You had no way of knowing what it meant to me. Let’s turn in. I don’t know about you, but I’m beat.”
Chapter 1: Preparations Must be Made
“Yes, Craig,” Sherlock said with a note of excitement in his voice. “Did you run the dark web scan?”
The Scientific Method
“On October 3rd another victim was found. Again the hands and feet were bound with the unusual double constrictor knots with a slipped bight. The body showed similar signs of torture. Unknown to our killer, apparently, this victim had an underlying heart condition that caused him to expire prematurely before shock and blood loss could finish the job. Like the second victim, the face was left intact.”
“Absolutely not,” Sherlock stated petulantly. “I unequivocally refuse to leave Baker Street.”
“Yes, I know. I know how people look down on addicts, how we are judged, how people say, ‘well, you should have known better than to inject that filth, that poison, into your body.’ And in the event of an overdose,” Sherlock mocked, “just another dead junkie. Isn’t society so much better off? And almost no one wants to look with compassion and see the people behind the addiction. If society could just give one moment of thought to how much emotional, physical or psychological torment a human being must be suffering to actually inject that filth, that poison into a vein? I know the legalities as well you do, but it doesn’t make it right.”
“John, she didn’t say anything; she’s just making random sounds,” Sherlock said dismissively.
“Got the lube?” John asked on a breathless sigh.
“Two actually. More efficient that way.”
“Why your office and not Lestrade’s?” John mused.
Of course! Sherlock metaphorically smacked himself on the forehead as he sat in his mind palace. He had been focusing too much on the women. Mistake. He forgot with whom he was dealing. What did John ‘Three Continents’ Watson want that he wasn’t getting from Sherlock? Why sex, obviously! If John wanted sex, then Sherlock would see to it that he got it, and plenty of it. He wasn’t going to lose John over something so trivial.
* * * * * * * * *
Not only was John already questioning his own sexuality, but a tiny part of him was already considering a sexual relationship with Sherlock. Now it was time to up the ante. John was going to rebel if he remained true to form, and there was no reason to believe otherwise. He would desperately try to find a woman and get a leg over as soon as possible to reaffirm his heterosexuality and prove to himself that what he really needed was the right woman.
As his closet was directly above the kitchen counter, all of his clothes now reeked like the rubbish tip behind a seedy dive pub. At least Sherlock had offered to pay for the cleaning bill.
“She’s not ready for that, Sherlock.” John argued.
“She’s in recovery now, and the prognosis is very good. We removed all of the gangrenous tissue. She’s on high doses of antibiotics and painkillers, and it’s unlikely that she’ll wake before morning. You should go home now. I hear from Mycroft that you’ve a little one at home.” The older woman smiled. “Go home and take care of her, Dr. Watson.” She removed the cover from her hair and turned tiredly for the elevator. She paused for a moment before turning back to the assembled trio. “Harriet’s full toxicological results came in early this morning. At the time she assaulted Ms. Burton, she was quite intoxicated, as you know. Her results also indicate recent heroin use. The medical staff have confirmed the presence of track marks between her toes. I’m so sorry,” she added softly.
“Speaking of which,” Mycroft continued smoothly, “how goes the campaign to woo the good doctor? You haven’t been to the brothel in several months now.”
He noted vaguely that, at some point during the conversation, Sherlock too had gotten up and begun to dress.
John laughed. “Yeah, took me longer than it should have to figure that out, but I’ve known about it for months.”
John looked up a few moments later to see Sherlock silently tracing the blurred outline of the ring with his right index finger as he mouthed the words in the printout description.
3) Real Doll Incorporated is an actual business in San Marco, California—I kid you not. I was doing some online research for dildos used by men devoted to prostate orgasms and several of their blogs led me to the RD website. Not sure if AO3 will let me put in a link but it’s RealDolldotcom and the Real Cock II is a very expensive, hand painted, extremely realistic dildo that costs five hundred dollars ($500) in US currency and has a waiting list. I did the conversion to British Pounds Sterling and then tacked on a bit for international postage/shipping and handling expenses and rounded it off to four hundred pounds even. It does not, however, come in the average size that John orders, only the X size referenced in this story. LOL. You can see it by going to the website and clicking on the link for toys and doll accessories. As soon as I saw it, I had to incorporate it somehow into this story. It was just way too much fun to pass up, and so the size kink fetish for this story was born.
“John, are you all right?”
Deciding that that course of action was unacceptable, and determined to be a doctor’s wife, she had sabotaged John’s condoms and stopped taking her birth control pills. John had felt the small, raised pricks in the condom packet, and miraculously, had the good sense to hit pause in the heat of the moment and really look closely at the packet.
Sherlock apparently took that as a directive because he was diligently trying to push John’s knees wider as he knelt in between.
The slick slide of hot flesh against hot flesh, harsh pants and low moans from both men punctuated the stillness, drowning out the low hum of the radiator.
“Rosie likes that one,” Nora called from the lounge.
Mycroft smirked into his scotch, and when the furor began to die down, he leaned down to John and said softly but sincerely, “Well done, Dr. Watson…well done.” That was all he had to say on the subject.
“Okaaay,” John replied with a grin.
“John? John! Don’t hang up,” Lestrade demanded, clearly agitated. “I need you down here immediately. It’s an emergency.”
“Yes what, Sherlock?”
“Two prostitutes,” Sherlock clarified in a bored tone. “More efficient that way. Weren’t you listening? Do try to keep up, Watson.”
The lamp on Sherlock’s nightstand flared into brilliant, blinding light as Sherlock lunged across John to grab for the phone.
He supposed it was inevitable. John knew the feelings were there, but the series of events as they stood was forcing him to act on them. If he didn’t, he knew he would regret forever letting Sherlock walk out that door. But Sherlock was catching on.
Sherlock flashed through several still photos that graphically portrayed these facts. “On September 27th two more bodies were found. Again, both victims had been bound with double constrictor knots with a slipped bight. The bodies revealed marks of torture identical to the first victims.’ This time the faces of both victims were removed.” More slides flashed across the screen. “So, why the removal of the faces?” Sherlock speculated. “It wasn’t a forensic countermeasure. All of the victims still had teeth and could easily be identified from dental records, even if their fingerprints were shredded.” Sherlock paused to let his query sink in.
“Please, god, tell me you weren’t going to get high,” John pleaded.
“Highly unlikely. I perused those crime scenes myself. One of those idiots noticing something I missed…,” Sherlock scoffed disdainfully.
“Lestrade called a while ago. CPS has decided to charge Harry with attempted murder.”
Sherlock’s eyes had narrowed shrewdly at the mention of Mycroft’s name and remained squinted as if in deep concentration.
**********
CHAPTER 5
“You were Sherlock’s night nurse when he was shot,” John interjected, brain beginning to process on adrenaline.
Sherlock exited his mind palace humming softly to himself. He was surprised to see that it was dark out. A glance at his phone revealed it to be a quarter of midnight. Shrugging, Sherlock pulled on his Belstaff and quietly exited the flat so as not to wake Rosie.
John sighed tiredly and signed the last of the charts for the evening, laying his pen down on his desk blotter and rubbing his slightly numbed eyeballs. For a secret government clinic that ostensibly wanted no paper trail to exist, there was a hell of a lot of paperwork involved.
Sherlock was about ten feet away and hadn’t yet attracted the attention of the scammer, who was humming along as he carried a couple of empty plates to the window by the kitchen door.
As part of the negotiations (of

Sherlock turned to face John.
“What do you mean, what ASBOs?  The ones from when Sherlock and I got a bit..um..carried away outside the Royal Opera House…”
John tried to remember to be discreet, as he realised that the conversation around him had lulled, and seven people were pretending not to be listening.  This caution was forgotten in a fit of temper after whatever Mycroft said next.

She patted his arm reassuringly.  “That’s fine, dear.  I
Then again, he had some reason to be wary of smart phones.  Last time Sherlock had visited he’d set some blaring alarm to go off if his phone was touched, meaning to play a prank on Mycroft, but he’d forgotten about it and needed to know immediately the range of the Monarch butterfly and asked his father to pass him his phone.  Fortunately, the phone survived being tossed across the room when Siger flailed with shock.  John had glared Sherlock into apologizing, but Siger still approached smartphones with caution.
abducted, he did him no good by calling the police in.  They’ve tromped around and contaminated any evidence there might have been on the ground.”
“Out again?  Do you need…”
While John considered the best technique for grabbing his arse, Sherlock had finished at the table and was now two feet away.  The v-neck top and Sherlock’s relative height mean the collarbone in questions was now directly in his face.  Sherlock pretended to be checking the thermostat next to the door.
Ah.  In the tackling, Sherlock’s shirt had been rucked up, leave his arse on full display as he exited.  Unfortunately, John got only a glimpse before it was back to business handing the suspect off to the officers Lestrade had sent over.
John spent the next half hour giving the highlights of his life since leaving Afghanistan; only Bill had read his blog, so he was able to regale them with stories of cases that made the blog and crazy situations he and Sherlock had gotten into that hadn’t made the blog.  His relationship with Sherlock came out naturally in the conversation, but the blokes recovered quickly from the surprise and didn’t seem to be put off.  The one who dared make a rude speculative remark about who was the bottom had his shin kicked rather sharply by his neighbor and kept further thoughts to himself.  The conversation eventually moved on to a review of the others’ lives, but John was the undisputed sensation of the evening.  By the time they staggered out after a pint too many, he was slapped on the back enthusiastically by nearly everyone, and had gained several new readers of his blog.
“Ah, yes.  One the one hand, having John in his life has given him stability and responsibility, and John’s a doctor, so he fusses at him to eat and sleep and all...but then, whenever there’s trouble John just jumps right into it with him.  They make quite a pair.”  Violet smiled fondly.
“I always thought he quite favored you, dear.”
one to come by before dropping that fork.”
He gave a last glare and huff of annoyance at the phone before sliding it back into his jacket pocket with a little more force than necessary before noticing the silence.
It was half eleven on Tuesday night, and John had two fingers buried deep inside his potential propose-ee and a nipple in his mouth when he had his next breakthrough moment.
“I’ll go with you!” she chirped with a falsely bright smile.
John glared. “AND SO I couldn’t help but give him a bit of a snog...I mean, just a snog, and yeah, it might have been a bit much for in public, but it was late, and we were in a dark spot, no kids around, so no harm, yeah?”
“John’s a doctor?  What is his specialty?  Our son-in-law David…”  Laurina made a bid at extolling the virtues of one of her family, but Violet jumped back in quickly to answer her question.
smirk.  He was giggling by the time he made it into Mike’s office, though; two ladies in the doorway of the office next door were giving him to oddest look for delivering flowers to Stamford.
“So.  We’re attracted to each other, and
He then cheerfully pocketed the phone and turned back to 221, where Mrs Hudson was waiting to provide him with the large batch of biscuits she’d promised him.  John had paid the boy, of course, but these Uni students always appreciated something homemade, and if this day ended with her very own married ones, well.  She just might have to send regular care packages.
He was home, dry, and he’d probably be able to feel his fingers and toes again at some point.  He could eat in the sitting room if Sherlock was still playing with the quivering
“No, I
“...Have a very naughty Christmas, and in case you didn’t see…”
John debated all the way down the hall to the breakroom.  Involving other people was a good way to get found out; he’d already taken a huge risk with Mrs Hudson.  But...Molly, as a soon-to-be-bride, might be able to get information he could not…
Stop that!  I told him that it’s more than just
?  You know, I think that at Mummy’s birthday party next weekend I’ll just mention what happened last Wednes…”
An impressive blister was already rising on the proffered finger, and John drug Sherlock over to stick in under cool water from the tap as a better alternative to saliva.  Sherlock sighed in relief, and then turned his attention to his non-hopping foot.
“It really wasn’t hard to act...Sherlock hadn’t died that day, but he was off on his own, away from London and unreachable, doing who knows what, and he’s never been the best at taking care of himself when he’s working.  Every few months Mycroft would let us know that he was still alive, but we didn’t hear from him directly--too dangerous for him and for us, if anyone was watching us--and we didn’t know how long it would be.  In the end it was over two years...as parents, I’m sure you can understand how it was easy to appear genuinely affected.”
“I dunno.  Lisa and I were alright for the first few years, but then we both got busy with our careers, and…”
The next morning, he was reliving the evening in his mind while flopped on the couch waiting for the paracetamol to kick in for his headache.  After a few minutes’ contemplation, he picked up his phone from the coffee table and typed out a quick message.
“Problem, John?”  Sherlock quirked an eyebrow at him before turning to scan the scene through the door that had been left propped open a few inches.
John’s phone rang before he’d walked out of sight of the jewellery shop.
(Or at least this was the story that Mycroft and Greg told to their parents.  It was partially true, but the real catalyst for taking their relationship from acquaintances to dating had been an incident in which Greg had been taken hostage when an attempt to arrest cartel members had gone pear-shaped.  The situation had been dire enough that Sherlock had called in a favor with his brother for help with the CCTV footage to track where they had taken him.  Mycroft had been the one to find him first, and had, despite his usual distaste for legwork, gone in to free Greg himself, while Anthea and a small team of agents made sure the cartel members highly regretted their decisions in life.  Mycroft felt the story would only worry his parents unnecessarily, and Sherlock wouldn’t be blabbing because he’d have to admit Mycroft had solved the case before he did.)
“Ha, yeah...I’ve barely got time to keep up with the one.  But anyhow, you’ve all heard my life story.  Kevin, what are you up to these days, besides pining over Jimmy’s sister?”
He did wash his hands several times with the antibacterial soap and let his cuffs be splashed so the scent would be stronger.  What else could he do?  Ah, a bit of ointment on his shirt, and a splash of stale coffee that had been sitting in the break room all afternoon.

“Oh, stuff it.  I’m going to have a few pints now; you’re going to fuck off.”
John looked up into his eyes again.  The look Sherlock was giving him was...heated.  Sherlock took another step forward and John stepped back until his back hit the door.  Sherlock placed his hands on either side of John’s head and leaned in, leaving barely an inch between them.

“And I know you had Mycroft run a background check on them, so the worst that could happen is a bit of boredom.”
“I’ll be back around six.  Text me if you want me to bring takeaway.”
Sherlock gave a noncommittal noise.  “Did you see either of them speaking with anyone else while they were here?”
fits that particular stereotype, the posh git.  Though not all of the other stereotypes; he’s absolute crap at interior decorating.”
Violet rolled her eyes, but she was smiling. “Oh, I think I can.  But I promise not to unless they prove to be particularly tedious.  So at least not until their second visit.”
Fortunately, Siger thought to himself as they resettled in the sitting room with coffee, getting older did have a few benefits; no one expected them to stay out late.  He and Violet weren’t really that type of “old people,” as they had gotten into the habit of staying up till midnight, at least in the summer when it stayed light so late.  He supposed that for Violet going to bed at midnight really was the equivalent of their neighbors going to bed at eight; she had always been a night owl and had done much of her best work at two in the morning.  It had made keeping Sherlock in bed as a child even more challenging: “But Mummy isn’t sleeping!  I have work to do! My experiment needs…”  And it got even worse after he turned five.  Bedtime was like that game they used to have at the arcade when he was a teenager.  Something about rodents, what was it?  Slower recall time, one of the less convenient aspects of aging.  Ah, whack-a-mole, that was it.  He rather thought that if blogging had been a thing back then, he might have preempted John in writing about Sherlock.  Just the creative excuses for why that child was yet again downstairs after bedtime would have given him plenty of material.  Mycroft hadn’t been much of a sleeper, either, but he would at least stay in bed and read a book.
Charles and Laurina were gracious hosts without being overly stuffy. Violet was feeling quite comfortable by the time they were seated at the dining table, although she’d let Siger do most of the small talk in the living room beforehand.   They’d learned about the Fitzgeralds’ three daughters and six grandchildren (rather boring; apparently the Fitzgerald’s progeny were ordinary in the extreme: a teacher, a nurse, an estate agent, ballet recitals and football), and a bit about their recently acquired interest in gardening.
“Well...I suppose she was rather enthusiastic.”
Sherlock coughed.  John glanced up and met his eye.
“Wow, Johnny, that was you?  I remember reading about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, but, well, Watson’s a fairly common name and I didn’t realise that was you. Wow, man.”

for nearly a year.  He had finally admitted to himself that there had been a certain attraction, some spark of something more than just simple friendship, since the day they met; after years of miscommunication and separation and knowing what it feels like to lose each other, he’d finally worked through his sexuality crisis.  It hadn’t been easy, adjusting his self-identity at this point in life.  It had helped a lot that everyone in their lives had not been terribly surprised when his bisexuality was confirmed, and as they all had seen Sherlock and him go through so much together already, they had just been happy that they had found some joy at last.  Greg had bought him several pints (and Sherlock one, when he’d bothered to come down to the pub), and Mrs. Hudson had made celebratory cakes until Sherlock had actually invited Mycroft over
Once they could all breathe again, Paul said, “Well, yeah, I guess everything you’ve been through would make you close...and if you’re happy with it, hey.  I never knew you were bisexual, though.”

He’d dropped his keys, couldn’t pick them up with his gloves on, had to stick his fingers right into the slush to get them, and then freezing rain dripped right down the back of his trousers when his coat pulled up as he bent over.
“No..no.  Just home, I suppose.”  John shrugged and followed.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock didn’t bother to change back into his suit before they left to find a cab.  He did take his Belstaff, leaving John carrying the bag with his suit, although it looked a bit odd with the blue tights.
“And then he started writing about Sherlock’s cases on the computer...what do they call that, again, dear?” Siger said.

“Um, yes, thank you, Angelo.  Wouldn’t seem right without the candle now.  Mrs Hudson will be there to answer the door and take the food.”
John fumbled in his pocket for the ring.  He’d taken it out of the box (Sherlock would be sure to notice a lump) and had used a large safety pin to secure it in the inside pocket of his jacket.  Only Mrs. Hudson knew that he’d practiced for ten minutes on Thursday morning to make sure he could unpin it, without stabbing himself on the pin, quickly and smoothly (and she’d promised never to tell, and she didn’t, until she had too much eggnog at the Christmas party two months later).
, right there.  John clamped his mouth shut to keep himself from letting out a little moan of frustration.
“Ah! Here it is!  I knew it must be down here somewhere!”  Mrs Hudson pulled a lacy bra in an alarming shade of pink out from the gap between the washer and the wall.  “Now, I must be off; I’m meeting an old friend for drinks in half an hour! Just let me know once you’ve made your plans if there’s anything I can do to help!”
John startled the nearest table by bursting out of the door in pursuit as Sherlock sprinted up the middle aisle.  They tackled the fleeing suspect easily as he tried to plough through a tangle of confused Tarts. The music cut off with a screech as John hauled him to his feet.
Mike just grinned. “I ought to tell them a crazy tale just to see how far they’d believe it.  Those two, I could probably get to believe that I have some secret admirer having flowers delivered to my office where my wife won’t see them.  All other evidence to the contrary.”

“ ’Night,” he waved to one of the cleaners as he reached for the door handle.
John just glared for a moment. “If you can’t deduce that for yourself, or hell, just look out a window occasionally, you can stop calling yourself a genius.”
Violet swiped the screen of her phone to take another fond look at the photo. “So, yes, these are our boys.”
They parted just far enough so that John could take Sherlock’s hand again.  The ring slid on easily, and John raised the hand to his lips.
“You know damn well where I am.  Can’t I just have
“Well, are you still man enough to order the next round?”
“I know, love.”  Siger smiled his half smile that had made Violet realize she did have a heart after all, so many years ago now.  “Besides, it seems fate has brought you back together, running into her just a month after she and Charles retired to a cottage just fifteen miles away from us.”
“Remind me again why I agreed to this…” grumbled Violet Holmes under her breath.
“Mike Stamford, the lothario of the anatomy lab.”
“Fucking…buggering…arse…shitty…
John was swearing under his breath within a block.
“Your last patient was a child, a loud one, and you now have a headache.  The back of your neck and your left hand are both red, so…”
“Adding soap would be helpful, dear.”
John attempted to look as moved as possible by the story and looked over at Sherlock with just a hint of the puppy-dog eyes.  Sherlock looked back and forth between them.
“Well, he was in the RAMC, with the 4th? 5th? Some number…”
He looked...thoughtful, after. He just wandered off
“MI6?  What are you
John kissed him harder and slowly let his hands, which had come up to rest against Sherlock’s shoulder blades, drift down his back. He had to stretch juuust a bit to reach without breaking the kiss, but...there.  He had been right; the curve of those cheeks fit just
“I think the Weetabix are only a little stale.”
“Yes.  I attended to the breaker as soon as I arrived home.”  Sherlock paused. “At 6:30.”
Right there, that bench over there, nearly seven years ago…
Laurina and Charles made the appropriate noises of pity for a wounded veteran.
As Sherlock made his way back around to where the scammer was supplying a table with more tea, several of the Tarts hopped up onto the low stage at the end of the room and began serenading the diners with lively Christmas carols.  John was only half listening as he followed Sherlock with his eyes as he circled his prey.
“What he thinks about…?”  Molly’s face lit up. “Oh! Oh,
“So sorry...I’ve got to take this…” he mumbled an apology as he scowled at his phone.  “It’ll be brief, if you all don’t mind, I don’t want to make you all move…”

John narrowed his eyes.
“Good afternoon, sir!” A cheerful grandmotherly woman poked her head around the humongous arrangement she was assembling behind the counter.
“Violet Holmes!  You cannot invite Sherlock to dinner and give him alcohol and free reign every time you want to get rid of dinner guests!  Our son is not your secret weapon!”
“No shit, Sherlock.”

been savvy enough to see through the deception, but one of the ladies in her book club had been taken in, and several others had been contacted but hadn’t yet sent any money.  Sherlock had promised to look into it after her indignant rant meant she burned the biscuits he’d been looking forward to.  As badly as John wanted this scammer caught and punished--those who took advantage of the elderly deserved a special place in hell--he’d have been tempted to just let him go if
he’s right, or he was.  It just occurred to me recently

in his hands.  He squeezed, and Sherlock let out a muffled squeak.
“I believe I may have once made a miscalculation.”  What was Mycroft on about now?
“Yes.  Come along, John.  We have an overly affectionate Italian to see.”
As before, sex proved to be a particularly useful mental lubricant for John.
“John! Oh, Joooohn.  Please...oh…”
So it took John Watson by surprise when, nearly twenty years on, he received an email from Paul, the former openside flanker.  He had just clicked to open it when he was distracted from his seat at the desk in his sitting room at 221B Baker Street by a howl of annoyance from the kitchen, followed by a cacophony of pot lids hitting the floor, followed by an even louder and more aggrieved howl.  After years of being the flatmate, friend, caregiver, and
He knew he shouldn’t encourage her, but well, she hadn’t changed in fifty years and he wouldn’t like it now if she did.  At least, unlike their sons, she generally managed to keep her unflattering observations of their acquaintances to herself until she had the chance to unleash them all to him on the way home.  He could have lived quite happily, however, without knowing that his cousin Edgar enjoyed wearing diapers.  He didn’t really envy his family’s deduction skills if it meant being able to remain ignorant of some things, especially the sexual kinks of his relatives.
Tony snorted.  “Lee, aren’t you colour blind?”  Lee threw up his hands in defeat, and they all cracked up again.
After leaving Mike’s office, John went to the clinic.  The nurses were a bit surprised to see him; it was more common for John to not turn up when he was supposed to be there, thanks to a case or other Sherlock-related catastrophe, than for him to show up on a day he wasn’t scheduled.
“Oh god...please don’t tell me your bare arse made the evening news…”
So I asked him if he’d ever thought
His affectionate musings came to an abrupt and horrifying end as he felt and heard a sickening squelch under his foot.  He paused a moment, dreading to look.  Apparently he had missed an eyeball in his roundup, and it was now goo under his foot. He let out a disgusted squawk and started swearing.  Thank god he was wearing shoes.  He toed off the defiled shoe and stomped off to the bathroom (carefully, watching for any other escaped organs in his path), pausing only to glare furiously at Sherlock, who
Oh, great, John thought.  Here it comes.  The who-tops-who question.  His cheeks started to flush a bit in anticipation of it.  Honestly...it was rude.  No one goes about questioning their straight friends about their favourite sexual positions.  Or at least not unless they knew each other much better than uni friends who hadn’t seen each other in years.  He’d been asked the question a couple of times before, but once it was a witness they were interviewing and once it was a nosy lady at the grocery store, so he’d been able to shut it down with a disdainful look and walk away...a few other times someone had started the question, but Sherlock had been present and had loudly deduced enough of their proclivities to discourage them from further curiosity.
, John was sure).  He’d seen enough of the costume just from a glance in the bag before they left Baker Street to be quite thrilled to play the sidekick on this one.
Sherlock pushed upon the door and walked straight to the bundle of incredible purple roses.  They were tied with a black satin ribbon, and had been laid carefully on the worktop beside his favourite microscope. The roses were resting on several pieces of sheet music; a quick glance was enough for him to see that they were from Mendelssohn’s and Wagner’s wedding marches. An envelope made of creamy, luxurious paper was propped against the roses, with his name written as carefully as it could be in John’s deplorable doctor’s handwriting.  He stopped breathing.
“I know, but I didn’t want you to know. I didn’t want anyone to know. I was so ashamed. How was I supposed to admit that I let my female partner, who weighs two stone less than I do, beat me up?” She began crying in earnest then, fat drops rolling down her cheeks, and she wiped, viciously, smearing her mascara. “When you visited me in hospital to tell me about Harry’s surgery, you blamed yourself for not going more ‘tough love’ on Harry. And I could see by the way you behaved today that you’re still blaming yourself for her choices. You thought her behavior was your fault. And your partner thinks that this mess is his fault. It’s not.”
He fought back a sense of despair and asked the next logical question. In for a penny…in for a pound.
Sherlock paused in the act of bringing his own mug to his lips and set the heavy, ceramic mug on the coffee table.
One incident stood out clearly in his memory. He had had to treat one young man for a perforated colon, ruptured bladder and rectal bleeding after some of the men in his squad somehow reached the questionable determination that he was gay. After tying stocking masks over their faces, they then cornered him in a supply closet and sodomized him repeatedly with a broom handle.
Just as he was re-thinking sedation by ethyl alcohol, inspiration struck. Sherlock wouldn’t normally consider something he did to soothe Rosie as appropriate for John, but he was out of his depth and needs must… John found it soothing when Sherlock played his violin. He obviously couldn’t play now, but…. He began to hum, his deep baritone doing poor justice to the Brahms’ Lullaby, in his opinion, but it seemed to soothe John even further.
And then, who pulled who he was never quite certain, but one of them pulled the other into a hug, and John could do nothing but hang on tightly as the tears threatened to spill over in his joy.
Sherlock chuckled softly. “John, I happen to know that you’re not some sort of sexual deviant. I doubt there is anything that you desire that I haven’t tried at least once. If you were to consent to this… arrangement …, nothing would happen that you did not want, and I would never pressure you for more than you are willing to give. Now, if you have any further questions, ask me tomorrow. I haven’t slept since Friday afternoon, and I need a few hours of sleep before I collapse. Goodnight John,” Sherlock said as he stretched and headed for his bedroom.
“You said earlier that you were in love with me, correct?”
“Yeah, I wondered why Harry, an alcoholic for more than twenty years, would be so affected as to pass out with a blood alcohol content of .19%. That’s enough to put me down, but not someone like Harry who’s built up a tolerance over decades of hard use. Add in the heroin, Jesus, that would cause heart palpitations, paranoia, … and, of course, the sudden loss of consciousness now makes sense.”
4) I also discovered during my research that the majority of men, who blog about/discuss prostate orgasms, indicate that while there is a fair amount of leakage during the stimulation of the prostate itself, the orgasm itself is usually dry. The majority also report that unless there is actual penile or nipple stimulation, they do not achieve more than a partial erection. There is some variation here as a fairly large minority report that they get rock hard and ejaculate copiously until their testicles are empty. The general consensus among all of them is that a prostate orgasm is far more intense and is of a much longer duration than a penile orgasm. A high number also reported that multiple orgasms were possible as well.
He felt the slimy squirt of lube then. Sherlock didn’t stop until it had begun to run down John’s thighs. The next moment he felt pressure as the blunt head of Sherlock’s generously endowed cock tried to penetrate him. John bore down against the pressure, which was abruptly removed.
More lube, and the second finger pushed in along the first. John hadn’t done this in a while, but it was like riding a bicycle. His body knew what to do, and soon he was working three fingers in, fucking himself a little roughly, a little urgently.
“And you were,” Sherlock stated calmly. “Very useful…indispensable to The Work.”
Unknown to John, Sherlock was about to take Lestrade’s casual, drunken analysis of marriage, a comment that Lestrade would no longer remember he had ever uttered when he sobered up the next afternoon, to a place even other high functioning sociopaths fear to tread. And he would do it all with impeccable logic and deductive reasoning based soundly on the scientific method. John Watson was doomed.
Sherlock stubbornly shook his head. “Not here.”
From there, no further instructions were needed.
Sherlock nodded continuing to search John’s face for signs of hesitation or uncertainty.
“The real one in the dungeon or the one upstairs where everyone thinks you’re a minor government employee?”
Clara smiled wanly with the right half of her mouth and shook her head minutely, in obvious deference to her painful head injuries.
*Please leave feedback.  If you are reading this story and enjoying it even a little bit, I'd really appreciate a few words.
“Yes, I think he needs to hear what you have to say,” he said firmly as he gestured the plump brunette up the stairs to 221B. “Damn,” he murmured softly. “I should have insisted on interviewing you myself instead of relying on the police reports; Lestrade’s objections be damned. I can’t believe I missed that,” he said with an angry, self-deprecating head shake as he pushed open the door to 221B and gestured her toward the interview chair.
John walked slowly back to 221B Baker Street, his mind a tumultuous swirl of conflicting thoughts and emotions. If someone had asked him later what route he had taken to get there, he really couldn’t have answered with any accuracy at all. Should he confront Sherlock first or wait for the other man to make this ridiculous proposition? Should he try to let Sherlock down gently? But, then again, Sherlock was about as subtle as a freight train. If he tried to let the other man down gently, Sherlock may not understand.
“I thought all of your eye rolling and the bored expression…,” John muttered slowly.
It was a bemused John who had met his mates at the pub that night. Half an hour later John committed an egregious and wanton act of alcohol abuse when he dumped an entire pint of stout into Mike Stamford’s lap.
John’s solution to the “aching loneliness” was to begin dating again. Clearly these little weekly jaunts to the Red Lion were insufficient to meet John’s needs for companionship and friendship. John also saw this as a way to “give Rosie a positive feminine role model” (ridiculous—she already had Mrs. Hudson, Molly, and Sherlock’s own mother cooing over her constantly) and perhaps if all went well “secure a real family with a mother” for Rosie.
“Well, you said several things actually. First you said that a serial killer doesn’t change his MO when we were discussing why some of the faces had been cut off and others left wholly intact. That led me to conclude that removing the face was not part of the killer’s MO. After discarding that red herring, I focused on the evidence that remained that was consistent, the torture knot always tied eight degrees counterclockwise to the victim’s center of mass, the cuts and the puncture wounds.”
“Anything else?” John said a few moments later, nearly numb as he began pulling on his jumper.
Just as he was debating giving up this ridiculous plan and attempting to locate the bottle of Scotch Lestrade had given John for his birthday, John began to settle, the sounds becoming less ragged and harsh, breathing settled into a more normal pattern and John’s arms came up seemingly of their own accord, as he clung to Sherlock, burying his face in the detective’s chest. Helplessly, Sherlock returned the embrace, resting his cheek atop John’s tucked head. He was completely and utterly baffled as to what to do.
“Why wouldn’t I? This did turn out rather well,” Sherlock admitted, a questioning frown beginning to form.
“I’m not sure. I think it’s some form of telepathic communication,” John whispered back.
Sherlock looked stricken. “You’re going to leave me,” he accused, voice high and a bit childish.
“Yes,” Sherlock stated simply. “This man is a criminal genius. He has never been caught, and he never will be unless we set the right trap.”
Sherlock nodded sharply, released John’s hand, and stood up abruptly.
It was nearing midnight as the two men crept quietly up the stairs to their flat. They had done as much as they could for the moment. Now it was a waiting game—either the killer would strike again or the DNA, autopsy and toxicology reports would come in. Sherlock hated waiting.
John shrugged. “In future after a traumatic event, it would probably be better if you asked before you left, but I’m a bit glad you left today. I needed to cry for Harry, and I’m not sure I could have done that with you here. I know I did it before, but I was morbidly embarrassed about it afterwards. I’ve still got a few hang ups, one of them being that a man doesn’t cry—especially not in front of another man. Sorry,” John muttered.
Sherlock moved closer and stopped at a table only about ten feet from where John was peeking through the door.  His back was to John and, instead of walking around to reach over the diner’s shoulders to refill their water glasses, he stayed where he was and reached.  John couldn’t keep his eyes from following the hem of the tunic as Sherlock bent slightly as he stretched.  Up...up...and oh, god.  The delicious curves where arse cheeks met thighs came into view.  John’s hands clenched by his sides with the desire to

keep a secret.  Just let me know when he says yes and I’ll bake one of those chocolate cakes he likes so much and bring it up to celebrate!”
Snapping out of his reminiscing, he rejoined the conversation. “Oh...no, not yet.  We had a dead tree removed last fall, and I’ve thought of replacing it with an apple tree, but haven’t decided for sure yet.”
There were three eleven-year-olds with shrill voices behind him, chattering about the latest Disney film and shrieking every time the bus hit a bump, there was a draft, or, well, he wasn’t quite sure why, only that they did it much more than seemed really necessary.
“Sure, not all marriages are great, and not everyone’s meant for marriage, but I don’t think that’s reason to swear off marriage in general.  There are a lot of good marriages, too.  I don’t know what I’d do without my Amanda.  We’ve been married for eleven years in October, and I love her even more now than I did when we started out.”
John spent a lot of time thinking and planning and googling odd things to the point that he was surprised he hadn’t had a message from Mycroft regarding his search history. He mostly worked on the details of his plan during his lunch breaks or when Sherlock was out or asleep; Sherlock’s observational skill were both wonderful and occasionally very inconvenient.

“So, MI6...cases?”  Rajesh asked.
John didn’t look at Sherlock.
“So sorry...I’ve got to take this…” he mumbled an apology as he scowled at his phone.  “It’ll be brief, if you all don’t mind, I don’t want to make you all move…”
Siger couldn’t help but chuckle out loud.  “My dear…”
“Yes, yes.  Thank you, Siger.  She was my friend..I just…”
Teddy opened his mouth to protest further, but John motioned from behind Sherlock’s back for him to leave it be.
“So, you got arrested for laughing in a posh place?” Kevin joked.
Sherlock gave a quick cheeky grin--after all these years, he still puffed up when he managed to impress John.
, (so much pain, over so many years, from being separated from each other, how could he ever leave the one person he truly trusted, who had sacrificed for him over and over, who brought colour and purpose to his life--he’d finally allowed love to overpower all of his self-doubt and insistence on heterosexuality) lover, John had learned to distinguish the frequent and various howls and screeches and shouts of Sherlock Holmes.
“Just one minute.”  Sherlock, still seated, grabbed him by the hips.  “I told Lestrade thirty minutes.  It’s only a fifteen-minute cab ride.”  He was looking up at John with a smirk.
“Of course I’m fully recovered from the altercation on the boat.
John glared.  The rest of his cup of tea had gone down the front, so he pulled his jumper off over his head.

Sherlock wrapped his arms around John and pulled him into an embrace.  John went along, but arched his back to quirk an eyebrow up at him. He didn’t trust him for a minute.

Yes, now Sherlock was looking in the window to see what caught John’s attention.  John watched out of the corner of his eye.  Sherlock’s eyes lingered just a moment longer than necessary, too.

“Oh.  OH, yes, love...Fuck.”  John’s cock had wilted significantly while Sherlock was on the phone with Lestrade, but perked back up quickly as Sherlock stuffed as much of it as he could fit in his mouth.
Siger was laughing now.  “Honestly, Vi, it’s slightly boring dinners, not espionage and daggers.  The Morrisons were nice people; there was no need to terrorize them like that.”
.  We had to get Lestrade to pull rank on that prick of a sergeant…

?  So far, nearly everyone who knew of their relationship was happy for them--most people in their lives had been in their lives through it all, through the crazy-flatmates-vs.-Moriarty era, Sherlock’s death, John’s grief, Sherlock's return, Mary’s secrets, Sherlock’s near death (again), the showdown when Mary’s past caught up with her, understood the kind of connection the hell they’d been through had forged between the two men, and were just grateful they had survived it all still with the capacity to love and to laugh, and that they obviously found comfort in each other.   But he’d never had to explain Sherlock or the mad life they shared to anyone from...before.  To anyone who didn’t already know Sherlock.

John had eaten in the park because it was on the way to his next destination, a small flower shop near St. Bart’s.  He remembered walked by it frequently when he was a student; he’d stopped to consider making a purchase on several occasions when a girlfriend he’d neglected due to the long hours of a medical student (okay, and rugby, slightly less excusable) needed to be placated. He’d only done it once, though (Lisa Lewis, third year); a uni student’s budget didn’t stretch that far.

“Here. I put it all in a Marks & Spencer bag so that you wouldn’t look odd carrying it.”  Sherlock shoved the bag that had held his costume and now held his suit and Belstaff into John’s hands.

Sherlock was elbow deep in a drowning victim entirely too early on a Thursday morning.  John and Molly were observing from just far enough away to avoid being splattered.
Sherlock looked back over his shoulder. “Of course.  The costume fits exactly as designed.”
?  You know, I think that at Mummy’s birthday dinner next weekend I’ll just mention what happened last Wednes…”
John barked out a laugh.
“You have a blog?”
“Now, sod off and leave me alone.  I hear Greece could use some help with its economy if you need something to interfere with tonight.
“Well, it’s all fine for YOU to say, but I’d rather wait.  Just in case it comes to...well, you know.”
A couple seconds more of silence, just enough for John to open his mouth to try to say something, anything, to change the subject, but then:
“Well, it’s all fine for YOU to say, but I’d rather wait.  Just in case it comes to...well, you know.”
Thank you, Molly.  I really appreciate your help.

Siger gave his wife a fond smile.  Their sons were really a lot like her; independent and intellectual, generally avoiding small talk and casual friendships.  But when they loved, they loved with everything they had.  He was glad she’d had the chance to talk so much about the boys, one of the few topics she’d really be enthusiastic about.  They were nearly to pudding now, so there shouldn’t be too much more small talk to manage without Violet beginning to fidget and bringing up her favorite logarithms as a topic of discussion when she couldn’t think of anything else to talk about.  Not that there was anything wrong with having favorite logarithms; he had gained quite an appreciation for them himself after nearly fifty years of watching his wife’s face light up when she solved a particularly difficult bit of math.  But now, time to be polite for a bit:
“I was gonna tell them off for prying, but yeah, mate, now I gotta know…,” from Kevin.
Ha ha!  It was completely natural in the conversation.
“Sherlock, I…”  John pulled the door shut behind him and turned to address Sherlock and froze.  Sherlock was bent over the arm of his chair, arse pointed right at John.  That beautiful arse, covered only in a thin, stretchy blue layer of fabric.  And then he
Sherlock gave John a lingering glance but didn’t comment.
John sipped his tea and was brought out of his thoughts by Mycroft rising from Sherlock’s chair as he prepared to give up and leave.

“I...assume that was a yes.”

“Something orange and furry.  If it wasn’t for the odd colour, I would have said it was a toupee or a wig…”
John swiveled, glancing behind him to find the man with the Kermit-the-frog t-shirt, and then back around, eyes searching the corners.  His gaze froze on the one at the angle that would put the muppet-shirted man behind him to the viewer, and gave it a pointed grimace while lifting a middle finger in its direction.

going to make, when we could just live together
"Calling me bad names, captain." He whispered.
"You smell..." John growled from behind the door and Sherlock's knees buckled. "Nothing is wrong. Just old books and honey with clove. Now go away, omega!"
"Yes, John." Sherlock hummed and hugged John's leg. He was so affectionate now.
That was the second thing that John learned when he started sleeping with Sherlock. He could come just from anal stimulation alone. And John thought that was so fucking hot and extraordinary like Sherlock was. But John did and he promised and buried inside that perfect arse and he started moving again, causing little 'ah's and 'oh's from Sherlock. Sherlock closed his eyes and looked maybe 10 years younger. In two minutes John came too. He never finished this early but he couldn't resist.
"Wax play, captain." Sherlock whimpered.
"Sherlock, why didn't you tell me about what you did in my old room? You know you can tell me anything," he said softly, his fingers still tangled in brown curls.
Next day was the same. John did everything he always did and Sherlock still cuffed to bed listened and imagined things that never could be true. It was almost like delirium but he didn't have drugs so he didn't break the deal he had with John. And this was something that his body requested and as long as John didn't know he couldn't leave him.
"I want to have your pups because you love me. Are you that stupid to understand?"
But three fingers weren't enough. He needed more. Four, five and then all hand just to touch his glands and cum for the first time in his life. On his lips was John's name and he tried to breathe as much of his scent as possible. He was still in a good state of mind, but now he thought like an ordinary person, or ordinary omega, not genius.
John finally put his hand on him and scented his neck. At that moment another wave of heat went thought Sherlock and he clinged to John. John kissed him thoughtfully and messily and scented his face and upper body. "Jooohn!" Sherlock moaned. "My alpha."
Except he couldn’t.
“Alright,” said Mycroft, “this is how we bait the trap…”
“Come on,” John said as he stood up and held out a hand to Sherlock.
“The orgasms are far more intense with a partner, as opposed to masturbation, but that will work in a pinch. The euphoria coupled with the subsequent crash and several hours of sleep is the best possible substitute for drugs that I’ve found.”
“Come down to the pub. Have a drink. Maybe chat with Lestrade or Donovan. There may be something they noticed but thought was too insignificant to put in their reports.”
“That’s why addicts are so convincing. They mean it. At the time, they mean every word. They have every intention of going to rehab, getting sober, getting their lives together. And every time, after time passes and there are no consequences or minimal consequences, all of those good intentions are forgotten until the next time they’re in trouble. And every time, the people who love them, over and over…we fall for it because we want so badly for it to be true, hoping this time is the time when they succeed.”
Sherlock heaved another put upon sigh. “Very well,” he said, giving in with ill grace, looking testily from John’s shoulder down to the end of the bed—a very short distance from where John was lying sprawled in the middle, “but I refuse to contort myself into a small pretzel to do so,” he said with an irritated frown as he awkwardly held his arms open for John to lie against him.
But, John had to be realistic…no pun intended. There was only so much he could hide from Sherlock. As it was, he hid his toys under a small, false compartment in his gun safe, which opened to John’s fingerprint only. It had been a logical purchase after their flat had been broken into multiple times, and Mrs. Hudson had insisted after a bored Sherlock had gotten hold of John’s gun and shot a second emoji into the lounge wall one hot Friday afternoon last July. The safe could comfortably hold his gun and a maximum of 3 average sized toys.
John looked at Sherlock, a bemused expression on his face.
Long, manicured fingers raked their nails delicately over the quivering flesh of John’s thighs. His legs spread wide of their own volition, the need to be filled, to be fucked becoming increasingly urgent. John blindly sent one questing hand toward the nightstand where it mercifully located the warm heating pad. A quick fumble, and he was squirting heated lube across his fingers.
Sherlock was panting now, eyes still fixated on John’s arse as the other man slowly fucked himself senseless.
“Brother,” Mycroft greeted his sibling, releasing Nora’s hand to gesture his brother across the room to the alcove where the coffee was situated. “I came as soon as I heard. When I arrived, I agreed to sit with Mrs. Hastings until Dr. Watson returned.”
“Okaaay,” John said slowly, drawing out the two syllable word into four.
Mycroft ignored him and continued as if John had not spoken. “One of the first things the professors teach you is to state your assumptions and define your terms.”
***Warning***
“Get the lube. You’ll need to use a lot.” He looked nervously at Sherlock’s very large, very eager cock. “I’m gonna turn over onto my knees and forearms. I’ll let you know what to do. You have to promise me that you’ll follow my instructions to the letter.”
“Sherlock,” Martha Hudson began slowly, breaking off as a particularly loud crash broke the sudden stillness.
John pushed himself out of bed and winced. Oh, he’d be feeling the effects of Sherlock’s version of the Real Cock II X for days; he felt a grin playing on his lips—it had been totally worth it, though.
“Fine,” John muttered as he succeeded in snagging his jeans with his left foot and dragging them toward the bed. “But you’re still gonna clean up the spare room you call a lab so they have somewhere decent to sleep tonight.”
Sherlock scrolled through the crime scene photos of the murder in rapid succession.
“Just how do you suggest I prevent it?” Sherlock gasped out petulantly in a choked whisper.
After twelve more attempts to fix his profile, even going so far as to change the title completely three times with the same results, John gave the whole thing up as a bad job and deleted his profile.
Sherlock pressed his lips into a pouty line, but John was unmoved, and at last Sherlock gusted a long, put upon sigh and muttered “fine,” but he made no move to get out of bed, just stared at John. “Roast beef or turkey this year?” he asked as he finally broke eye contact and pushed himself out of bed, locating his now wrinkled gray trousers and hastily pulling them on.
Sherlock sighed and set the laptop on the coffee table. “I am going back through Scotland Yard’s full database, year by year. I am convinced our killer did not just begin killing. I believe he has been at it for quite some time, changing a few significant details each time he killed to keep anyone from establishing that there was a pattern. I am looking for that pattern. So far, I’ve identified at least sixteen previous murders I believe we can attribute to our killer. They appear random and unrelated; there are both men and women included -- of varying ages, backgrounds, and ethnic groups. Except for the knots and the pattern of cuts, nothing else links them. I am, however, convinced that this was all the work of the same killer and that I have solved the case. I now need irrefutable data to back up my hypothesis,” Sherlock concluded as he again picked up his laptop.
“When did you figure it out?” Sherlock asked curiously.
“Don’t come. I know this is rubbing the head of your cock, but don’t you dare come!” John moaned loudly.
Anticipation was killing him. He flushed scarlet, grateful for the privacy his small office afforded and inordinately glad that he had had the foresight to have the package delivered to his medical office rather than to the flat at 221B Baker Street, which he shared with Sherlock Holmes, moody mad genius and human bloodhound extraordinaire.
“John, I took that ridiculous robbery case just for the fee, for Rosie. Nothing had even been stolen. The woman’s elderly mother simply suffers from dementia and had misplaced her jewelry, in the walk-in freezer of all places. It wasn’t even a 2, no challenge at all.”
Any time he had ever thought about asking a partner to finger him, he had remembered that boy and kept his mouth firmly shut.
John awoke Friday morning and decided to indulge in a bit of a lie in. His paperwork was caught up. This was his last day at the clinic, and he wasn’t scheduled to see a patient until 1pm. He rolled over and pulled up the corner of the sleep mask. As he expected, Sherlock was already gone. At some point, Sherlock had used the two pillows in the center to help prop himself up, as there was a small mountain of pillows scattered across the top side of Sherlock’s half of the bed.
“Um…just a moment.”  She held up a hand to stop him and stepped fully into the room. “I need to explain…it’s Mrs Johnson, and there’s a bit of a situation…”
“Yes, yes, you were very helpful
“John, please.  And yeah, I am divorced.  Thankfully, my ex-wife moved to America, so I’m spared any surprise meetings.”  Especially as her new home in America was in a maximum-security penitentiary.

Laurina laughed. “Oh, of course.  We’ve done it too, bickering over which side of the family Julie’s red hair came from.”
“Well...I…” Siger looked slightly guilty. “Actually, they did deserve it.  Paul couldn’t stop bragging about the attention he was getting from his new twenty-years-his-junior secretary every time Melinda was out of earshot...it was rather disgusting.”
Violet put on her best mutinous expression.  “After listening to Georgiana talk for
“And now, all these years later, I’m so happy that we’ve..that we have become what we are to each other.  There are so many ways in which you are brilliant and amazing. But I knew my knee would give out before I could tell you everything I love about you, so that’s what the letter in the envelope is for.”
“Go on then, no bother,” from Kevin, and nods from a couple of others.  Kevin turned to ask Jimmy if his cute little sister was still single, but before he could open his mouth, his attention was diverted back to John’s phone call as soon as he heard the rather non-standard greeting:
“I think that he still fears losing you too much to risk asking for something that you are not ready to give.  But if

Once outside, John turned left without hesitating and walked at his usual pace until he was out of sight, just in case Sherlock happened to have abandoned the microscope for the window in the past three minutes.
He had politely stepped aside to give more space to a lady helping her elderly mother into a car.  His right foot had sunk through a thin layer of camouflaging snow into a rather deep puddle of icy water, which immediately soaked right through the toe of his shoe, leaving him with an uncomfortably wet sock.
And thus all four had been caught grinning, and Violet and Siger were so charmed by the photo that they were considering blowing it up and framing it for the living room.  They had so few photos of both Mycroft and Sherlock together as adults, much less ones in which both were actually smiling and not giving the other the side eye.
“Ooooh, yes. Oh, your
“Of course you did.”  They were both smiling giddily.  John rested his forehead on Sherlock’s thigh and took a deep breath before meeting Sherlock's eye again.  “Okay, I’ll be serious.  You are the most brilliant, caring, amazing, sexy, insufferable, beautiful, maddest person I’ve ever met, and I love you more than I ever realized it was possible to love another person.”
And I said, would you do the smash cake
“What, am I not the type?”
John smiled and rolled his eyes.  What’s one more thing, on top of all the insanity he’d already told them?  “So, when I referred to Sherlock as my partner earlier, I meant it both in the Starsky-and-Hutch way, but also...partners as in, we’re together.  He’s my boyfriend...god, that sounds a bit juvenile.”
“Are you attracted to me?”
“Siger, have you planted any fruit trees?”
Ha, me too.  Now I have to figure out how.
“Yes, a...blog.  We were excited when Mycroft told us about it; we enjoy reading about what those two get up to.  Well, excited to read about their adventures after the fact, knowing they weren’t injured.  I couldn’t have chosen anyone better for Sherlock than a doctor and soldier all in one man.”
As soon as his eyes came out of the roll, they widened of their own accord.

Quick glance.  Sherlock was still looking out of the window, probably cataloguing the case in his mind palace.  John looked down while scratching his ear as an excuse to move his head.

“Oh, yes, yes...this one.  I remember ‘im...he was here with a girl?  Sister, maybe?  They didn’t ask for a candle, and she left before him.”  Angelo pretended to be thinking hard about his customers from the previous night.  “Why?  Is the boy in some trouble?  If he is, he’s lucky to have you on his side!”
This was obviously going to be fast and hard, so John grabbed Sherlock’s shoulders and held on.  Sherlock had one hand around the base of his cock and one squeezing an arse cheek and was bobbing his head just. right.

The walk around the corner from the bus stop to 221b netted him a wet, dirty knee from slipping in the slush and then…and THEN, the snow had abruptly changed over to a mix of freezing rain and sleet.  He couldn’t run for it without sliding and falling again, so he had to slog along with the rain dripping from his ears and soaking right through his coat sleeves.

“Oh, what handsome young men!” Laurina said politely.  “Four boys, must have been quite a handful!”
Sherlock waved this off with a flick of his hand.  “Go find someone else’s life to meddle with, Mycroft.  Preferably in New Zealand, as that’s the furthest you could possibly get from here.  The sheep need you.”

And yet, he’d spent half of those seven years thinking that his best friend was dead, or staying with his replacement when he was too afraid to trust again.  John shook his head.  He’d brooded on his pain enough in those years; now, he was going to propose and be happy.
“John.” Sherlock breathed, barely above a whisper.
Sherlock chuckled.
Fortunately, he arrived before the lunch rush, so Angelo came out into the back alley to rehearse his lines.
Siger cut in again. “Really...I think that was almost the worst part of it all.  John couldn’t know; he was being watched closely and it was absolutely necessary that his grief be seen to be real.  And I don’t know if you’ve ever had anyone close to you who committed suicide, like John believed Sherlock had--he later told us about how his grief was compounded by guilt--what if he’d said the right thing or been a better friend, and so on.  If I ever had difficulty in appearing as though I was grieving a son when acquaintances would ask, I thought of Sherlock’s friends who truly believed him dead.  As bad as it was, at least we knew…”
John kept his eyes steadily trained on Sherlock’s left ear to avoid accidentally finding out if he’d dressed the left or right, and...

Terrified. Joyful. Nervous. Guilty for not having reached this point long ago.  Grateful that he’d had his miracle; his Sherlock came back.  Thankful that Sherlock hadn’t given up on him through the entire debacle with Mary.  Anxious. So desperately in love.  And...just a bit of panic.  Is that panic?  Yes, definitely panic.

“So, Violet, Siger mentioned your children…?”
Sherlock ruffled his hair in a way that made him look younger (
“So, my chicken korma?”
“And all of your arguments are moot.  As I already plainly informed you, I won’t go by myself, and John’s busy. So no.”
“So, um, I have a question, and it may be a rude question, I’m not sure what gay--would you refer to yourself as gay? Or no, bisexual?--people would consider to be too personal…”

there were negotiations), Wiggins insisted on new boots for two members of the homeless network who he would have tromp around the scene early Saturday morning so that there would be evidence of two cops having stopped to investigate.  John planned for the “client” to say that he’d asked the police for help first, only for them to decline since there was no clear evidence that a crime had been committed, at which point the client thought of Sherlock.  John hadn’t argued too much; shoe prints

Feeling marginally better in his third-favourite pyjama trousers and the rather scratchy jumper Harry sent him last Christmas (he really needed to do laundry), he plodded back down again.
“Of course, that was years ago now...they were just acquaintances for several years, but after Sherlock’s John came into the picture...John insisted on a bit more socializing than our workaholic boys ever took time for before,” Violet smiled fondly, “and Mikey--how he hates it when I call him that!--and Greg started seeing each other in a less professional setting on holidays and such at Sherlock and John’s and realized they enjoyed each other’s company.”

“Yes, that was an awful time...what most people don’t know is that a criminal he’d been chasing for some time threatened to kill John, Greg, and his landlady, Mrs. Hudson, who’s always been like a doting aunt to him.  He faked his death to protect them...I know it sounds like something out of a movie, but that’s our Sherlock; he seems to
Violet continued her discourse. “We’re so happy that he and Greg found each other, really. Mikey has always been such a workaholic, thought the world wouldn’t run if he left his office.  Greg’s been good for him; he works too much himself and has crazy hours sometimes too, so he understands when Mycroft has to work late, but he also makes sure they make the time to relax.  I’ve heard Mycroft laugh more over the past couple of years than he ever had before…” she finished a bit wistfully.

Five minutes later, they were parking outside of the Fitzgeralds’ retirement “cottage” (small mansion would be a more apt description for most people). Violet and Laurina had run into each other by chance in the little bookstore in the village halfway between their respective homes, and after the usual “Fancy running into you like this after all these years!” and “Imagine us living so near each other without knowing it!” (Violet had mentally rolled her eyes a bit at that one...the Fitzgeralds had only moved in last month; not like they’d been just missing each other in Tesco for years…), Laurina had insisted that the Holmes come to dinner next Saturday to catch up, and Violet had been unable to think of an excuse not to.
“Aye, aye, captain!”  Molly giggled and headed back down the hall.
“Why are you…”
“Okay, okay. I’m getting it together.”  She fanned her face.  The tears stopped, but the overly enthusiastic grin did not.  “So, what do you need me to do? Suss it out?”

“What do you mean?” It was probably obvious, but John hadn’t quite recovered his full mental faculties just yet.
“Sure you won’t be too cold on the way home in that getup?”
“I know.”  John looked down at his shoes. “It’s just...I’ve never been in a long-term relationship with a man before.  With the women I’ve dated, well, there are expectations.  You know, how big of an occasion should be made of anniversaries, how the relationship should progress, milestones, things like that.”  He took a breath and glanced up.  Oh, great.  She was looking at him with that soft smile, like he was a precocious six-year-old.  “But with him...he’s never brought up expecting...things...because we’ve been together a certain amount of time or because we…” he trailed off.

He’d been too focused on getting done with work to look out a window for a while, apparently.  The snow was falling thick and fast, and an inch and a half was already coating the tops of cars and any bit of ground that hadn’t been walked on.  The icy wind made him suck in a breath.
