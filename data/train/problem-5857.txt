“Tell me what you are again,” Tony, who was still fully dressed, demanded as he ground the sharp heel of his dress shoe into Steve’s back.
Steve huffed a laugh and allowed himself to close his eyes. He’d wake Tony in half an hour or so.
Tony let Steve a present before he went to work. Something new for them to try.
Tony spewed his coffee across the table. “Okay, that was just not fair,” he sputtered.
Steve took in the heft of the toy in his hands. He understood why the harness would be needed, it was a bit heavy. He unwrapped the cellophane and gave the toy and experimental squeeze. It had a decent amount of give to it and the outside texture had a matte feel to it for added friction. Poking a finger inside revealed a series of spiral ribs which were sure to stoke his cock as he fucked Tony senseless.
“That you have dear, that you have.”
Tony pressed his heel into the middle of Steve’s naked back, forcing him to bend in half from his kneeling position until his nose brushed the floor.
Tony wiped up the coffee spit on the table. “Were you letting me win this entire week?”
Steve grinned, returning to massaging Tony’s backside. “Fair enough,” Steve said as he slowly pulled the plug free from Tony’s ass, eliciting a much louder moan from him, already hard cock beginning to leak precum. “I’m itching to use this new toy on you anyway.”
As Tony loosened his tie, he noticed the pile of wrapping paper on the counter. Suddenly all signs of exhaustion disappeared, replaced by a wave of arousal.
Neatly packaged in holographic cellophane sat a large cock sheath. Large was probably an understatement. The calming light blue color did nothing to mitigate just how gigantic this toy was. It had to be the biggest of their collection now, surpassing even the massive plug Tony had purchased the other day-
“Well, if nothing else it’s more convenient for me. Get up, elbows on the bed, bend over,” Tony instructed.
“Good boy.”
“Yes, Sir.”
Knowing Tony wasn’t going to last as long as he hoped, he leaned down to nip at Steve’s lips. “Please make me cum, Steve, and keep going after I have,” He whispered.
“Aw come on Steve, I’ve been wearing this all day,” Tony whined, giving Steve the best puppy dog eyes he could manage.
Steve tapped his chin in thought. “Don’t know about other groups, but for mine it was a nightly event. M’ still proud of my record. Took every one of em’ down to the balls in one night. I was awarded the title of ‘Best Deepthroater’.”
Tony’s eyes ran over Steve’s body as he bent over on his elbows.
“So, what’s your conclusion,” He asked dreamily.
Tony kept one hand still in Steve’s hair and used the other to guide his cock back into Steve’s mouth. Steve’s tongue laved at the sensitive head and glans as they passed his lips, making Tony shiver. He tried not to pause for too long and continued pushing into the back of Steve’s throat.
Tony couldn’t even take off his clothes. Steve was insistent on pushing him up against the wall, undoing the fly of his jeans with his teeth, and pulling out Tony’s cock and balls. He palmed Tony’s balls, giving them a light squeeze while taking the tip of Tony’s cock into his mouth.
Tony groaned and smacked his head back on the wall. He tangled his fingers in Steve’s hair and coaxed him to swallow more of his length. Steve obliged enthusiastically, letting his throat go lax, allowing him to take Tony down to the root.
Tony undid his zipper, pulling out his hard length and giving it a few pumps. The snap of a lube bottle cap made Steve shiver in anticipation. Tony kicked Steve’s legs further apart and drug the head of his cock over Steve’s hole, allowing it to catch on the rim.
Not seeing his husband anywhere in the kitchen or living room, Tony knew just where to look. He slowly opened their bedroom door, revealing the most beautiful sight on the bed that Tony had ever seen.
Squirming, Tony tried to wordlessly coax Steve into pulling out the plug, but Steve removed his hands and placed them on Tony’s hips instead.
“Ooh Steve, that was too easy for you,” Tony marveled through a moan.
Steve looked him dead in the eye. “No you didn’t.”
“Why? You wanna test it?” Steve winked.
“Of course. For science.”
Steve trailed his fingers over Tony’s round cheeks, teasing until his fingers brushed against the base of the large plug that had been missing from the drawer that morning. He gave it a light push, causing Tony to make a low moan in the back of his throat.
“You cum on my cock or not at all, got it?” Tony stated, tangling his fingers in Steve’s hair and pulling. “And you’re not going to cum until I do. You're my cumslut, remember?”
When his thrusts began to stutter, Steve’s hands slid up to Tony’s hips and forced his thrusts even deeper down his throat. With a groan, Tony came hard down Steve’s throat, which he obediently swallowed, just as the first tears began slipping down Steve’s face.
“Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir.”
The idea alone made Steve’s mouth water, his dick beginning to throb in agreement. He glanced at the clock on the bedside table, exhaling a long breath when he realized it was still early in the morning. There was a long way to go until Tony got home, so Steve resigned himself to spending the day in the gym.
Tony reminds Steve that he's nothing more than Tony's cumslut.
Steve slowly stood, feeling a rush of blood travel down to his legs, making them get pins and needles.
Steve’s back arched as he came hard across the sheets under him. He let out a pitiful moan that morphed into a sob of relief. Slowly pulling out, Tony marveled at work.
Tony grumbled, “That’s a problem for future us. Nap now, shower later.”
At exactly 5pm, the elevator chimed and opened to reveal a very worn out Tony Stark. He kicked his shoes off at the door, figuring he’d put them away properly later, and draped his suit jacket over the back of a kitchen chair.
Tony snorted a laugh. “What’s above ‘Best Deepthroater’?”
Steve shrugged, handing Tony a napkin. “It was perfectly fair. I was honest, that’s the requirement right?”
Tony pushed in with one thrust, making Steve howl from the stretch. He wasn't going to spend any time allowing Steve to adjust so he started on a brutal pace, pounding Steve's ass as deep and hard as he could.
Tony wants to know how good of a deepthroater Steve is.
“You want to be fucked, cumslut?” Tony purred in his ear.
“Isn’t this a lovely present to come home to,” Tony breathed, taking Steve’s chin in his hand.
Steve’s heart fluttered in excitement. They’d talked about trying something a bit new a few days ago and Steve was anxious to find out what Tony had picked out. Carefully pulling the gold ribbon off the package to save for later, Steve tore the bright red paper off the box. Sliding the lid off revealed something Steve hadn’t expected at all out of Tony.
Steve hissed but still managed to mutter, “Your cumslut.”
Steve made sure to tighten his throat just enough for added friction and to tease the head with his tongue when he could. Tony didn’t think he was going to be able to last at this rate, but he held on just long enough to see tears beading up in the corner of Steve’s eyes.
Sliding down on Steve’s cock was an entirely new experience with the added sheath. Not only was it larger but the texture added an absolutely delicious amount of friction. While Steve was used to the tight feeling of Tony’s ass, the sheath had a different texture inside that was enhanced by Tony clenching his muscles, giving Steve’s cock a series of small strokes with every movement.
Tony’s breath hitched, signaling that he was fully seated on Steve’s cock.
Steve chuckled, leaning into the touch, “you gave me such a nice gift, the least I could do is return the sentiment.”
Tony lifted his heel off of Steve’s back, allowing him to sit up. Steve exhaled a small sigh of relief that did not go unnoticed by Tony.
Steve was struggling not to cum, only just managing to hold back, but Tony’s voice was going to push him over the edge. Tony smirked when he felt Steve’s hole flutter around him, a sign that he wasn’t going to last.
Steve grinned, going back to his newspaper. This was a game that had been going on for days now. The rules were simple, questions would be asked back and forth about their sex lives. They had to answer truthfully but the first one to stutter or get embarrassed about the question lost. This was the first time Tony had lost. He’d thought that Steve was much more prudish!
Tony grinned a wicked smile as he smacked Steve’s left calf first, leaving a lovely red line over the back.
There was a perfectly wrapped present on the kitchen counter. Glittery red wrapping paper and sparkling gold ribbon made it impossible to miss walking by. It caught Steve’s attention immediately while he did his zombie walk to the coffee machine.
He pulled up the files in his head, examining them and storing the knowledge away.
Steve got up, stretching out his stiffened muscles.
“Yes.” Tony pulled up the AI database. The ship was a bit older, so it would take him a bit longer than usual to set it up. “Give me a few minutes and it should be up and running.”
Something must be done. But what?
“Hmph.” Bucky let out a grunt. His leg kicked out and his eyes shot open, body turning to look around frantically.
He sat down, sliding his backpack down to make the least amount of noise possible. Tony looked over at the kid, seeing that he was watching the teacher. He was tapping his pencil against his fingers, making a light tapping sound.
“What is this?” Tony croaked.
“Where are we?” Tony moved on, hardly listening. His mind was spinning and it was hard to keep a hold of the information being thrown at him.
“Thank you so much, Mr. Stark. This is wonderful!”
He squeezed his eyes shut, and pulled his legs to his chest.
The computer was similar to one Stark used in his classroom. It looked like a big white block, keys making a weird click as he assaulted them with his fingers. No other teacher had a computer, but they all hated it, preferring a simple chalkboard.
“So, umm.” Tony stuffed his hands in his jeans pockets. He had buttoned back up his shirt and ran his fingers through his hair one too many times. Tony rocked back and forth on his feet, looking more embarrassed than he ever had in his entire life.
Tony exited the apartment buildings and shooed away a few kids who were messing with his suit. Finally, he flew back home.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck and fought down the urge to give Tony the biggest hug he’s ever had in his entire life. To talk to him about the most random shit like they usually did. Goof off and insult each other and laugh at each other. When did all of this even start? When had Steve Rogers fallen in love with THE Tony Stark?
“Those are mine and my Dad’s guns.” Tony stated in disbelief. “How did they get our guns?”
Then, the door creaked open, revealing a scruffy, brown haired kid with a small box tucked under his arm.
Tony always waited for Bruce’s return, even though the others have lost hope. He has Friday constantly check for possible signs of him, weather it be Bruce in needy villages, or Hulk desperate to keep himself from harming others.
“Tony is right here with some delicious pancakes.” Tony entered Steve’s living room, two plates of pancakes in hand, and two mugs precariously perched at the edges of the plate, nearly touching the syrup.
Tony rebooted the AI and cleaned out some parts of the system. He saw a classified file embedded in the AI. Tony checked to see if Banner was looking, and since he wasn’t, put his finger to one of the slots on the computer and began to download the file. His finger morphed to the slot, and the download was quick.
“Friday! If you won’t tell me I’ll figure it out myself!” Steve said, as if it were a threat.
Steve stood next to Bruce, looking down at him with worry. He took the sickly scientist’s hand, rubbing a thumb across the back of it to provide a little comfort.
“But how did he find us? I mean, we moved,” Rhodes pointed out, voicing Steve’s earlier concern.
“Tony?” Steve shook Tony’s shoulder.
“I guess not.” Steve looked at his hands. “He also had something called the ‘Speed Force Bubble’ or something that protected him.”
Tony hit the daylights out of his dummy, thoughts running wild, getting angrier and hotter the more he went. One of the only people could relate to just ups and flies away, leaving him to be the brains.
Peter gave Tony a wide grin. “So, scratch each other’s back?”
“How much did I drink?” he asked, half to himself.
“Trying to figure something out for Pietro’s suit. He runs too fast for any natural fabrics, so I need to make some tech that withstand the friction and obstacles.”
Tony stayed silent, exploring the building and taking out the soldiers that came at him. He found a control room and began to go though, downloading the files.
Steve collapsed in his room, worn out from his meetings and restless sleep the night before. He pulled out his phone to see if he got any texts, disappointed to find none. He looked at the clock, seeing that it was 4:00.
Everybody was heartbroken after Rhodes announced Pepper’s death. He wouldn’t give specifics, and they didn’t ask. Tony didn’t leave the garage for about a month, Rhodes being the only one allowed in or out, with Steve only allowed in on “good” days. Steve knew how long the grieving process was, he’s been through it himself. So he knew around what time...
Tony was distracted by the sound of a splash in the dish disposal.
“Not in that onesie,” Tony remarked. Peter looked offended.
“Assuming that Ross is Red Hulk, and that Red Hulk is mostly similar to Hulk, he should be pissed all the time, right?” Tony talked to himself.
“Do. You. Love him?”
If only he had his own little stash of vibranium. Then he could get his team tip-top gear and the world would be safer. But he knew what would happen, what always happens. He would make something intended to help, but instead somebody would use it for their own twisted purposes.
“We need to talk,” demanded Steve.
“Organic technology that can react and respond to the needs of the wearer.” Since Tony didn’t have vibranium at his disposal, he could make something incredibly similar, but less effective.
“I’ve noticed your work. Chemistry and mechanics are looking... prosperous.” He gave Peter a knowing smile. “I sent you an email, I’m sure.”
“Who is it up to?” Steve asked defiantly.
“Psychology and Math. I have a lot of classes with James,” Happy stated.
“May, is it?” Tony put forward his hand and May took it. “I’m here about Peter.”
The family maid sat in the front seat.
Steve helped Tony into his room, flicking on the light. Sitting Tony down, he let out a huff as if he had accomplished a great task.
Sorry this came out so late, guys!
“Nicknames?” Bruce questioned.
Tony wanted desperately to talk to him, but he wasn’t too sure. Rhodes has been there for him through thick in thin, he should at least tell him about this, right? Maybe later, Tony decided as he flicked through the last of the cameras.
“I, ugh, wanted to apologize for this morning,” Tony said without looking up.
Clint passed him his shield, a smirk on his face. "Thought you'd want this back." Steve gave a smug grin, and moved to the front of the group.
He saw the different YouTube videos of the “Amazing Spider-Man”. One video he was retrieving a stolen purse, another he was stopping a car from hitting a bus. Another one showed him stopping a robbery.
"Nat!" Steve cried.
“That all you’re gonna give me?” Tony laughed.
The man finished shaving and knelt down by a fire. He fished out a pan and dumped some gruel inside, setting it close to the flames. He politely handed Tony a square cut of a mirror so he could further examine the device lodged in his chest.
“How did he even find us?” Steve asked, falling behind the doctors as they pushed Bruce the rest of the way.
“Oh, umm,” Tony moves his hand away from his chest, “nothing. Just thinking.”
Tony turned around in his cot and saw what was restricting his movements. The wires connected him to a small battery laying on a tiny round table right next to him. His breath quickened as he followed the wires to his chest, where a large metal rim protruded out his sternum.
Tony slowly crept into the living room, his breath quite. He left the hall, seeing Dad sitting in his chair and Mom in the kitchen.
Steve then untangled himself from Tony, setting his back on the wall. Tony's head slumped forward in shame. Tears pressed his eyes, but he forced them back.
“First things first,” Steve started, hands resting on his belt, “Bruce is back.”
“You are in dire need of an upgrade,” Tony stated.
“Tony,” he responded, packing his tools back up. The elevator doors slid open.
"You can't keep it from him forever." The voice was achingly familiar. "Sooner or later, he'll figure out how bad it is."
Helen ran to meet him, her crew of doctors/scientists following behind. Tony gently laid Bruce down on the cot they wheeled out. Steve was close behind, his shield no where in sight.
“Where’s Tony at, Friday?”
“Welp,” Tony clapped his hands together, “I’m gonna go to the lab. Call Steve if ya need me.” And with that, he took off.
“You saved my life. You didn’t have a suit on either,” Tony pointed out, trying to move into Steve’s eyesight.
“He’s feeling better, but I think he would like someone he knows better,” Cho explained.
Sam was already there at the stove, a pan sizzling on an eye.
"Come here."
Natasha was in charge of feeding Tony, as she has had to go a while without food during missions. She set him on a strict diet of bananas and dates for the first few days. Then Nat slowly let him eat more and more calories.
“So we’re your trigger men? Really! We’re thirteen.” There was a dance on Friday, Steve wanted to say, but decided to keep quiet. I’m thirteen and you want me to fight in a war we already won. Steve clenched his fists, blood boiling. He looked over at Bucky who was still sound asleep.
“Fucking idiot.”
“Nobody.” He quickly said, “And I intend to keep it that way.”
Steve lightly ran his fingers along Tony's oily hair. Tony curled up against Steve as he began to find comfort in his warmth.
He just gave a little smile before going over to check on Bucky. Stark pulled up his sleeve to check on Bucky’s healing.
“You spilt it dummy. Get the mop. Go get the mop and clean it. Don’t look at me like that.”
They both got comfortable, the new warmth making then sleepy. Tony's head slowly fell onto Steve's chest, and he fell asleep. He soon snored as he had the first good sleep in days.
Pietro had already left, getting upset at Wanda ignoring him. Steve, himself, eventually left the living room and to the med bay.
TW: Drunkenness and self harm.
“Videos, conspiracy theories, aliens, anything Hulk related.”
“Would you like me to start you some coffee, sir?”
“What’re you doing?” Steve asked, trying to end the silence.
“Friday. Tell me why Tony has a gun.” Steve made sure to use his army voice as if he would intimidate the AI.
They got tired of waiting for Clint and Natasha, but there was nothing they could do. They drank their last drops of water, pangs of hunger stabbing then in the gut.
“Thanks, man.” It was the tall black man. “What’s your name?”
All of Steve’s pent up emotions spilled out as he pulled Tony in. No kiss, just a hug. His arms wrapped around Tony and squeezed tight, as if afraid he would lose him there and then.
“Super strength, webs, incredible instincts and reflexes. He has potential.”
“Physics and Math,” Rhodey replied.
Tony sat up, taking note of his sleep attire. He didn’t remember anything from last night.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then you should start dating,” she said simply. She started the car and sped back down the interstate.
When he came to, a medical cord was shoved up his nose, and Tony grabbed it, pulling it out. He felt it move inside of him until he finally got the whole pipe out. Tony flexed his numb fingers and grabbed at a few trays on the table, which swiped to the floor.
"You know, I wouldn't be here if you had let me stay at home," Tony joked.
"Share warmth." Steve shuffled closer, stretching his arm out as an invitation for Tony to do the same.
"If they do give us food, you need to take it," Steve had said.
“He should be home any minute now. Wow.” She had a huge smile plastered on her face. “What kind of uses?”
“Big Green has returned,” Tony said, eyes scanning the room.
“Give me a weapon!” Dad demanded.
Tony and Steve had settled on Steve’s couch, a movie playing on the television. Tony had his head resting against Steve’s chest, and they were smiling at their newfound closeness.
“Line up!” Stark shouted in a booming voice. Steve jumped slightly from the intensity of it.
“I should go,” Steve said and quickly left the room.
“Yeah, Buck. I’m so sorry.”
Math went by quickly, the only thing they did was an About You sheet and introductions. The three split up afterwards, Tony going to Biology, while Happy and Rhodey went to English.
The jeep in front of them exploded upwards, leaving fire in its wake. The driver slammed on the brakes and grabbed her gun.
“Stuff, sir?”
“Aww. Party pooper. Tell ‘em, Friday!”
They took little sips of the water.
Stark clapped his hands, a wide smile on his face. “Aren’t they perfect? Just a bit of training and they’re ready!”
Tony let out his pent-up anger on his training dummy that he had set up in his lab. Using his different techniques, and slapping the hell out of it.
“Bruce...” Steve felt a twinge of guilt, for he hadn’t thought about the scientist for a while. “We did the best we could,” Steve was convincing himself as well as Tony. “He’s spent years in hiding. If he wanted to be found he would’ve let us get him.”
Tony grabbed a broom from a tiny storage room and began to sweep up the dust and dirt that settled on the floor.
“Clean this up, Friday.” Tony pinches the bridge of his nose.
“I’m Sam. Navigation.” Sam reached out to shake Tony’s hand. He took it, flashing a quick smile before retreating to his quarters.
Steve shook his head to clear the thought. No, it was cruel and it was selfish. He shouldn’t had taken advantage of Tony like that.
They got out in no time. Tony's suit finally got to them when they got outside. As they flew off, there was a massive flash of light and an explosion, wiping out the base that had them captive for a week.
Two guards gripped Steve by his arm, another two grabbed Bucky, dragging them forward to display to the new arrivals.
Helen helped Tony into a chair, complaining about how she can help treat this if he would tell her all the symptoms. She promptly left after she took a last look-over.
He saw that Ross worked with gamma bombs, and a few months scratched away from his record.
Tony crossed his arms, letting out a huff as he stared at the reports before him. He took a swig of coffee and sat the mug on a table.
“For a few years now.”
“And that’s why I’m here.” Peter sat on his bed, twiddling with his thumbs as Tony spoke. Tony sat in Peter’s desk chair and gave Peter a comforting smile.
The teachers blew the whistle to dismiss them. They chatted on the way to the first block. Tony walked with Rhodey Happy to math class. Rhodey pulled out two Pop-Tarts and handed one to Happy, quickly biting into the other.
“What are you doing! You could die out there!”
Steve agreed to this and sat on the arm of his chair. They both sat there, staring at each other. A small tug pulled at their hearts.
Oh my god, Steve thought.
“Nun, uh. Me first.” He pulled out his phone, tapping it a few times. A video of Spider-man swinging across the screen, pulling a thief’s foot out from under him. “This- this is you, isn’t it?” Another video had Peter pulling a gun from a robber’s hand as the latter attempted to rob a little store.
“Oh, ugh, sure.” The kid scooted to the side a bit to give Tony more room.
"No, no, not now," he thought frantically. "Any time but now."
"Hey, lemme see."
Steve opened his mouth to protest more, but the words wouldn’t come. He nodded, his face contorted in worry.
Tony was finally able to take a deep breath, coughing at the sudden intake of air. The mask left once he was able to breathe normally again. Dr. Cho was there with Steve and Clint behind.
“Get away from me!” he whimpered, crashing to the floor. He slid his back against a table, drawing his legs to his chest. Tony’s hands were still planted firmly over his ears.
The driver hopped out only to be shot immediately. The one who took a selfie in the passenger seat ordered them to stay there as he ran out.
"Well, well, well." The hydra agent said. "What have we here? Two Avengers throwing themselves at my doorstep. Whatever will we do?"
Tony looked up from his scribbling and into Steve’s eyes. They were so focused and attentive, even though Tony was sure he had little idea what Tony was talking about. Tony saw how a small smile made Steve’s lips curve slightly upwards, his brows lifted.
“Hey, Tones!”
“What.” Steve’s mind was turning. What was this gun for? Clearly not protection, he has millions of suits. Why would he need it for peace of mind, he is surrounded by literal superheroes.
Tony’s eyes furrowed at the painful memory. His last ship is one that would be better wiped from his memory. His crew wasn’t the greatest to him, preferring to lodge screwdrivers in his joints rather than using them to fix the ship.
“Another package wha-“ Tony hung up before Happy could finish.
“Five months ago. You had your first attempt. You stuck...a gun in your mouth.” Steve hissed the last part, tears welling in his eyes and voice going hoarse. “Three weeks later, drank so much you could’ve died in your sleep. Five...five days later...”
Claire Voyant is Black Widow (not the typical one, but the more magic one).
Tony gave a small smile. Sam was on one side, Steve on the other, with Tony slightly squished in the middle.
“All, right, all right. That’s enough.” Steve gave Pietro and Clint a stern look as he went to put his plate in the sink. “I’m headed to my room. Natasha is in charge.”
They just stood there staring at each other, their minds at war with their hearts. Tony rubbed his chest to try and end the conflict, but it was to no avail.
“Yeah. Not right now, though,” Tony said as Steve began to get up, “I’m comfortable.”
Tony felt heat rise to his cheeks and his heart fluttered. He scratched his neck nervously, his chains clincking as he moved. Steve waited patiently, smirking slightly.
Tony flinched away, the rush of memories making him cover his ears.
“You’re drunk, Tony. Go to sleep.”
TW: blood and descriptive violence
“They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That’s how I’ve done it, that’s how America does it, and it’s worked out pretty well so far.”
“Peter Parker. Lives in Queens. Age 15.”
Sorry about the delay, my phone flew out of my hand and broke. Hope this chapter made up for it!
The lights on the cameras flickered, then turned off, leaving Tony and Steve to their own deeds.
Peter kept trying to cut in and object, but Tony hushed him with a stern look. Peter let out a frustrated huff.
It wasn’t as if Steve hadn’t seen a man naked before. He had to help his drunk army buddies all the time back in the day. But something about Tony made him stutter and flush as if he were a little kid with a crush. He had no idea why, and he wasn’t sure if it was a good thing or not.
All the people in the room- a gym by the looks of it- ran into a file formation. They all looked around Steve’s age or older. A mixed girl looking giddy with energy, standing next to a mixed boy with toned arms. They looked similar to each other, possibly siblings, Steve deduced. Another girl had an eerie calmness about her. Platinum hair tied up in a ponytail, the girl stood with her hands behind her back and heels pressed together. A tanned boy with brown scruffy hair stood next to a short girl whose posture was incredible, and nose stuck slightly in the air.
Tony climbed into his car at the end of the day, satisfied with his classes, and his new friend.
And with that, Rhodes left the room.
“Wow, okay. I’ll try not to be hurt.”
Steve looked at his hands anxiously. “What’m I gonna do?”
“What do you mean? This isn’t the 40s anymore.” Tony steppes closer to Steve, but he backed away from him.
Tony let out a sigh as a familiar song began to play. He couldn’t remember the name, but it made him nostalgic.
Pietro seemed satisfied with that answer, but was still intrigued by Tony. He was quickly distracted by a scar on Steve’s arm.
Pietro and Wanda were poking and laughing at each other. Clint and Natasha were talking quietly amongst themselves, looking to be deep in conversation. Pietro looked over at Tony and seemed to look confused.
“Recovers?” Clint questioned.
“Well, Tony. Care to walk with me to the medical bay? I need to set up there before lunch.” Banner grabbed two large backpacks, as well as toating a small duffle over his shoulder.
“I kissed him, Rhodey,” he said hoarsely. “Why did I kiss him?”
“Hey, Friday. Pull up that Spider-Kid again.” Tony had a pencil and notebook, a blank page ready to sketch out a new design.
Steve was rubbing Tony's hand to soothe him. He pulled the other hand off Tony's face and cradled.
“Can I sit next to you?” Tony asked with a shy smile.
“This is your team now, Steve,” Stark told him. “Get to know them. Because if you don’t and we need you to fight, it could kill you and every one of them.
“It’s, it’s Spider-man.”
“Tony? Are you okay?” Rhodes took his hands away from his face.
He sought a room that said “Thor,” and waited patiently outside. Tony had been flipping through the team’s files while he was unpacking to see if there was anything he should check up on later. After a few moments he knocked on the door.
"Thought not."
“Yeah, yeah. I know. Woah! Hey!” Peter stammered, “What, what are you doing here?”
Tony sat in the lab, staring at his phone as if he were expecting someone to call. He had unbuttoned his shirt, leaving it flowing, and a pancake still sat on one table, stale and cold.
“What’s happening?” Steve asked quietly, crossing his arms as if he were cold.
“Yes. He has shown great intelligence that can be incredibly useful for Stark Industries. If he agrees I’d like to set up something with you two.”
“Yup!” Richards exclaimed cheerily. “Come over here and I can set you up!”
“Somewhat. They’re also my… specimens, you could say.”
"You should have caught her, Tony."
“I missed you,” Tony whispered. “You’re sweaty.”
“So, from what all the other test subjects experienced, your senses should be heightened.” Stark pulled a small sack from under the cot. He dug around for a few moments before pulling out some circular devices, much like a compact version of hearing aids. Except there was no strap to hold the battery, only the earpiece.
When Tony thought, he either tapped his pen to his lips or to his chest. If he was really concentrated he would talk to DUM-E or U, spouting his ideas so he could remember them better.
, Tony thought as he finally narrowed down the videos to a select few.
“Tap this twice, and you got web shooters on the go.” Tony tapped the face of the watch twice, and a little device attached itself to Peter’s organic web shooters. Tony moved Peter’s other wrist to the watch, and another web shooter attached to the other arm.
Tony jabbed the button for the Work floor. Banner swayed a little on his feet as he waited for the doors to open. When they did, Banner and Tony were greeted by Steve and Bucky, who were happily chatting away.
The Avengers, his family, lying dead on a small hill of rocks. Mangled and broken, blood pouring from their open wounds.
“Keep eating like that and you’ll be too big to fit through the door,” Clint snickered.
“Hmm?” the kid took out an earbud and turned to look at Tony.
“You’ve always been my hero.”
“So… how was it?” Tony asked, shaking his milk carton.
Tony cursed as his hand slipped on the wrench. Stupid thing wouldn’t budge.
"Yeah, I can tell!" Steve shouted. Tony heard a loud bang over the coms.
“Still are.” Tony looked up at him. “Though it was kind of annoying, though, having to live up to the great Steve Rogers.”
“I picked this team out specifically. Your resumes are unlike anything I’ve seen before, and perfect for this ship,” Steve said, making sure to make eye-contact with everyone. “You will be here for three months, and then you will be paid and sent home. The contents of the cargo are confidential, and, let me tell you, extremely boring.” The crew let out a little chuckle.
"It's not loaded, is it, JARVIS?"
“I definitely didn’t get an email-“ Tony cut Peter off.
“I did visit you. Every night when you were asleep… so I could make sure you woke back up.” Steve flexed his fingers, still unable to look at Tony. He held back against a sob, the scene of him getting shot while falling to his death replaying in his head.
Stark let out a frustrated breath before turning to Bucky and Steve. “Okay, I need to prep you two.” Stark rubbed the bridge of his nose, one hand resting on his hip.
“You just gonna stand there staring at me? Or are you going to yell at me some more?” Tony said, wobbling to his feet.
The two lovers fret over their intense kiss.
She snickered and patted his shoulder a few more times before exiting to the hall. Wanda was leaning against the couch and chatting with Vision, small red sparkles playing at her fingertips. Steve noticed they pent more time together, and Vision looked relaxed and was smiling. Steve felt a little warm feeling in his heart as he watched them.
Bruce snickered at the altercation, Tony chuckling in return.
“Yeah! Totally,” Dad said. The soldier pulled out a small camera and took a selfie, throwing up some peace signs.
There was a warm feeling inside Tony’s heart, and for once it wasn’t anxiety. This kid's got heart.
The table was a sturdy wood, 10 seats surrounded the table. Everybody had their official unofficial seats. Wanda sat with Pietro and Vision on either side of her on the right side of the table. Thor, though absent, had the head of the table, Clint and Natasha facing Wanda. Tony sat at the other end of the table, Rhodes to his right, Steve to his left, and Sam beside Steve.
“Well, he’s causing quit the ruckus in Tennessee. Trying to recreate that suit of yours. Mechanical prodigy, they say.”
Steve had managed to shove his lunch into his backpack as they rode. As they waited at the crosswalk, Bucky turned to him, a giant smile on his face.
“Awful headache,” Tony chuckled.
“What kind of help?”
“Tony.” He gave a tiny wave. Thor chuckled and continued hanging up his uniforms.
Tony noticed the small security camera in the corner, a small red light shining on the box.
Tony did his nightly routine. Shower, clothes, teeth, security, extracurriculars.
They’re using those on people?
Tony hopped out of the car with a small wave to his mom before she drove away. The front doors of the school were bleak. The school's name was spelled in dirty letters a few feet above the door, and a long hallway stretched in front of the doors.
stuff? Like emotions and get hurt and things?” Pietro inquired.
“Oh, Tony…” Steve choked out, rushing at him. He grabbed him, pulling him into a hug, burrowing his face in the crook of his neck.
“Of course, we’ll have to start in the morning,” Steve jokes, trying to lighten the mood. “Do you, ugh, want me to write it down?”
Together, it took about 20 minutes for everything to cook. Everybody was rising from their rooms, looking like the dead. They sat around the very large table in the huge dining room. They didn’t always stay there, moving to their rooms with food if they wanted some more time alone.
Tony thought it useful to befriend the electricians first, seeming as he was probably going to be with them the most. He left his room, gently shutting the door behind him.
He took the faced-down photograph that sat on the nightstand. It was of him and Pepper at one of the many conventions they went to. In this one, she was smile, leaning on Tony as he laughed, his face red as a tomato. Tony started at the picture, his body numb as his mind spun.
“Looks like you’ve been busy.”
“Seemed… off?” Happy tried to explain. “I dunno, but I dunno if I like her too much.”
There was a splash as Tony settles into the tub.
“Umm, no-“
Tony summoned his suit to him. Stve was close behind them, Clint shooting the soldiers who got close. Steve noticed how Tony was acting different, more confident, more like his normal self.
“I’m doing fine. I didn’t catch your name?”
Today everybody stayed at the table, Tony being the only absence which is usual for him. He’s the only one with his own kitchen, so maybe he planned it.
“That’s right, smile!” the man joked.
The man stood and walked to a table as he spoke. He scraped the food into a couple of bowls. Tony zipped up his jacket, for the cold and to cover the machine implanted in his chest.
“Stevey.” Tony called.
Tony leaned against a table, shock and confusion coursing through him, as well as despair. Did Steve think he was faking it? He thought the kiss had made it pretty clear.
DAY TWO
Steve looked at him with slight worry. Tony likes to joke when he was stressed. He stopped Tony with a hand on his chest, standing slightly in front of him, close enough to whisper.
“What do you want me to say? ‘Hey babe, it sucks that you threw yourself out the fourth story window without a suit on, but I’m glad you’re all better now!’” Steve hissed.
The man didn’t get to respond. The people were at the door, speaking in Arabic- was that Arabic?
“But I’m not anymore… Honey, please. Just look at me.”
“Yes, sir.”

“Let me help,” Natasha insisted.
He gave a lopsided grin. "No. How about I leave you here and let you two slowly shrivel. I wanna see you caves first." And with a flick of his hand everyone retreated.
“What could he
“Just go and apologize!” Steve came to a final conclusion. Just go and apologize and never speak of it again. It would hurt the worst, but it was for the best.
“I was finally able to get the weapons and we drove the pirates away.”
Not Tony. Why didn’t he tell them? Ask for help? He could have helped. Steve would’ve helped.
"Let's get you out of here."
Tony hummed a little tune, and they swayed side to side. They stayed like that for a few moments, relaxing as they calmed each other’s racing hearts.
He felt a single run down his cheek, a few more following it. Tony had started to feel again. He promised himself he wouldn’t, but he did. Stupid old man, he thought. Stupid kiss. I’m such an idiot.
Natasha sat next to Clint, much to Tony’s surprise, seeming as how different their personalities were. Natasha being more calculating and reserved, while Clint was a hands on do-it-myself kind of guy.
Tony went “oh” as it clicked what comic Steve was talking about. He had read a lot of those as a kid, even dressed up as the Flash for Halloween one year.
“I think I got it.” Tony sat himself on the tub lip and began to take off his socks as if to prove a point.
“…movie night.”
Steve started to object.  He wasn’t actually anywhere near the mountain, and he wasn’t planning on going up there, certainly not in the dark like this. He was just running.  Just trying to get away.  Anywhere that was away, not up the mountain. Why would he go there? That was ridiculous, he thought, then stopped himself, his mind grinding to a halt.  He wasn’t headed to the mountain on his wild run through the night.  Was he? Steve blinked, staring at the man with a frown.
“Happy, my husband is a sarcastic little shit,” Tony called out.
“Okay, these are done,” Tony said, taking a few more patties off the grill.  “You know, if I had a propane tank or a hose for the gas line…”
“Some great-great-and-so-on ancestor of mine finally decided not even vast salt mines of Antilla were worth risking his cock rotting off with whatever disease his soldiers were coming home with,” Tony told Steve, side-eying Rhodes as he did.  “Peace in our time, my good men.  I always thought that story was rather poetic in its own way, all things considered.”
“It’s…it’s gorgeous,” Tony breathed out in awe, holding the watch up higher in front of him as he studied it.
“I think he’s more broken up about it than you, Cap,” Natasha remarked with a smile, which quickly dropped off her face.  She nodded towards the floor under the cot, her eyes darting to Bruce’s, who followed her gaze.  “Okay,” she continued. “So, Clint and I will get slightly-broken Shellhead here to the jet.  Bruce, we’ll see you onboard.”
“He always seemed to like ‘em real hot and flashy, you know? Models, actors, that kind of thing,” Brock said.
“I’ll…I’ll keep that advice in mind,” Steve said, returning Sam’s smile with a chagrined one of his own.  “Thanks, Sam…for everything.”
“Thanks. Cough won’t go away,” Steve remarked, swiping his hand over his mouth when he finally was able to draw a shallow breath.
“Yeah, it’s filtering the fucking air into space!” Tony yelled.  “Shit! What about the back-up?”
“I mean it, Tony, I do. I mean it,” Steve breathed out urgently.
man, and that’s a dangerous thing for a king. For all of us.  All I ask is that you have a care what you ask him to give.  Righteousness is a bloody sword, my friend.  I think you know that. But,” he sighed, a grimness settling over his features, “the coin must have two sides. It was knowledge and truth and an acceptance of what was coming that saved us…but it was hope that we followed.  Maybe we still need both,” Rhodes told him, giving Steve a long, considering look. “He does, anyway, and I suppose that’s the only thing that matters.  Through here,” Rhodes said with a nod at a tall wooden door with a large, metal ring dangling from it that was framed into the far wall of the corridor.
and then the head of Tony’s cock was inside him and he let out a breath and a groan and gripped the sheets as Tony pressed in further, then further still, burying himself to the hilt inside Steve.
“Okay,” Tony replied carefully.  “You know you picked a cabin with a stream that runs right next to it, right?”
“Those aren’t events, Tony, those are you’ve had an idea and want someone to listen to you moments,” Bruce said.
“It’s because you put the whammy on me,” Tony said mildly.  “Magic finger whammy. Technical medical term. Whammy,” he added, making the last of the word pop against his lips as he said it.  The alien’s brows drew together and he pulled his hand back from the reactor. He made another series of those strange noises and went back to tapping at the screen on the side of the table, his face inscrutable.
“What thought?” Steve pressed.
“Got it off some redhead down at your concierge,” Rhodey explained.  “Concierge guy didn’t want to take it because you weren’t listed as a guest, but damn if he wasn’t corrected on that one.  She a friend?”
“Hey, don’t I know you?” Stern asked, eyes narrowing.
Coulson escorted them through the lobby, giving Tony a bit of history on SHIELD as they went.  He pointed to a large framed portrait of a beautiful brunette in a deep olive green military uniform that stood at one end of the main lobby next to a gold plaque.
“You did, Father,” the younger Lord Rand replied.
“What are you doing with my poster,” Steve asked Tony with genuine curiosity.  Maybe Tony wanted to redo his poster, too?    He’d thought it was fine.  Tony was probably adding sparkles and a Hello Kitty bow, knowing him.  Steve sighed.  He really did not need to deal with this today.
He was holding his hands up again, palms out, backing away slowly, clearly trying to calm Tyber down, but Tyber was having none of it.  Tyber pointed the spear at Steve’s chest and pressed the tip deep enough to nick, though Steve just shoved it away with a sharp shout, more of surprise than pain, Anto thought.  Tyber looked even more surprised than Steve by the reaction. He grunted and regripped the spear with both hands, all pretense of a warning gone. The others followed suit, raising their clubs and spears and chuffing loudly.
“I’ll manage to struggle through somehow,” Bucky replied, raising his eyebrows.  “You two…”  He trailed off, leaving the question hanging for Steve to make whatever he wanted out of it.
like the car,” Tony protested.  “I love the car.  Who wouldn’t?  It’s amazing.”
“I’m sorry, Brock,” Steve said automatically.  “I didn’t even think about the clothes or--” he broke off, frowning.
“I would prefer if you did not,” Steve said stiffly, looking quickly over his shoulder, then turning away from Tony, blinking back something he did not want to face.
“Tony!  Tony!  Open the door, Tony, please!” Steve shouted, pounding against the glass with his fists.  “Tony, dammit, open the door!”
Tony let out a low laugh and gave Steve a half-smile of commiseration.  “The Raj’Inama is entitled to spend his morning lazing about, if he so chooses. A benefit of the title that even I rather envy,” Tony said, stepping around the table and walking over to Steve with a cup of that bitter brew he so loved in his hand.  He sat down on the edge of the bed and reached out to push Steve’s hair back from his forehead. “How do you fare this morning?”
There are no secrets.
“Lead on, husband dear,” Tony replied, winding his arm through Steve’s.  “If you’ll excuse us,” he said over his shoulder as the group watched them walk away.
“We have this whole press conference thing,” Tony continued, ignoring the interruption.  “And when you worry, you get…” he trailed off, waving his hands in front of his face like he was fanning himself.  “Splotchy. I mean, I like splotchy. Have I told you that? One of my turn-ons,” Tony rushed out.
almost instantly faded.
“I’ll bet you would,” Tony laughed.
“And then what?  After you got the thrust capacity right?” Steve asked carefully, like he was trying to pronounce each word just right.
“Yeah.  Yeah, I know,” Steve breathed out in a puff of warm air that hit the back of Tony’s neck.  Tony thought that was on purpose.  Leaning back, he let his head fall against the curve of Steve’s shoulder and looked up.
“True.  Though, to be fair, I was a handful.  Some would say still am.  Oh,
“I am not,” Steve insisted, frowning and reaching for some of the candied figs and cuts of cheese to hide his discomfort.  He glanced at Tony, then sucked in a deep breath.  “Just asking.  So I’ll know what to expect,” Steve said, tasting the lie on his tongue.  “Cam said you two were betrothed.”
“What?  Um…I don’t know what you mean…why would I…” Steve said, shaking his head, trying to follow the twists of her logic.
“I’ve been doing a lot of that lately, sure.  The company. My father’s legacy. What would he think about the state of the world we’re in now and how we’ve—how
“Have fun tonight, Anthony,” she said.  For a moment, there was the hint of something in her tone that might have been regret or wistfulness or something like loss, but it was gone before Tony could really catch it.  “Don’t forget to smile.”
“Community college?  Basic courses?” Steve repeated with a chuckle and shake of his head, like they were a punchline.  “For Tony?  Tony should be at…Caltech or…what’s that place where you’re always correcting the faculty on their computer forum?  MIT,” Steve said, snapping his fingers like he just thought of it.  “Cold there, though.  And Red Sox,” Steve said, shuddering with distaste.
“Tony,” Steve grimaced.  “I don’t wish for someone else...I just wish things were different,” he finished with a sigh.
, and felt a hot spike of something shoot down his belly to settle in his groin.  Tony had stopped in front of him and was now watching Steve’s eyes as they fixated on the bed.  Steve’s throat was suddenly dry.  Then Tony’s hands were unbuttoning his shirt and he forced himself to relax as Tony slid it off his shoulders and moved his hands down to unbutton his pants.  Tony lowered the zipper, but instead of taking them off, pushed his hand inside to cup Steve’s cock through his briefs, while his mouth kissed and licked a path down Steve’s neck and across his collar.  He felt his hips buck towards Tony’s hand and a soft moan escape.
Tony felt the press of one of Steve’s large hands against his back, gently guiding him towards the room that held the Chef’s table.  It wasn’t exactly private, with its glass front and view of the kitchen, but it was away from the other diners, at least.  Tony sat down in one of the high-backed chairs.  Someone came by and poured water into his glass from a silver pitcher with a white cloth cupped under it to catch any overspill.  Steve was sitting next to him, back turned the other direction as he talked to the man Tony assumed was the Chef by the somewhat clichéd white hat and apron, but one hand was still wrapped around Tony’s under the table, the pressure light, but steady.  Steadying, Tony corrected as he breathed out on one-hundred and eighty-two.  It didn’t make sense.  He barely knew the guy, and now he was latching onto him like his own personal stress squeeze ball.  Boundaries, Tony heard Pepper’s voice sound in his head.  Try them.  They’re nice.
“Yes, of course, Your Highness,” Cam said formally and bowed low, before grinning widely and scampering off to see whatever it was that waited for him back in their rooms.
“Did you throw people through walls?” Tony asked, trying for something approaching teasing, though he sounded a bit like Stevie Nicks with a sore throat, and it came out sounding harsher, more accusing than he meant.  Or, more than he meant to mean.
“Okay, that…literally is precisely what worries me, so,” Tony said.  “I’m knee-deep in a federal counter-terror investigation, and my chauffeur thinks he’s Dirty Harry.  Christ,” Tony sighed, shaking his head.  “Keep that thing in the glove compartment, would you?  We do not need to add How to Get Away With Murder to our playlist this week, okay? I’m coming in.  If anyone followed us—”
. Oh, but you, you’re just going to—God, Tony,
“Okay, so, the Doombots have been handled.  For now.  We all know they’ll be back, so I’d like you to each review the footage of the fight and analyze it for tactical opportunities, weaknesses, that kind of thing,” Fury continued, ignoring Tony.  “We still have the situation with Krakoa that needs some mopping up—“
“Still,” Steve insisted, shifting slightly in the pool, because, well...Tony was suddenly talking about Steve thought they were decidedly not talking about.
“Oh, but not you, right?  Not you.  Right,” Rumlow retorted.
“Red,” Steve said.
At this, the man laughed out loud, a booming sound in the quiet of the night.  At first, Steve was horrified that the man was laughing at him, which was always awful when the other children did it, even if he told Bucky he didn’t care what they thought.  After a moment, though, Steve realized he hadn’t heard many men laugh like that, carefree and open, without ribald jest or cruelty behind it, and he stared, mouth agog.
“But?” Tony repeated.
“Tony, whatever it is, I mean it, you can tell me,” Steve replied as gently as he could because whatever it was, Tony was clearly deeply upset about it.
“Did you get an answer?” Tony pressed, though he already knew.
Bittersweet, Steve thought, with a choked-off sound as his hand flew to his mouth. That’s what this is.  Bittersweet. Because another time, and I could’ve teased him about this, made him smile and joke and deflect.  Bittersweet.  Because another time, and it could still have been true for Tony, and Tony could have said, of course, of course, Steve was enough, it was the world that was terrible, and Steve could have believed him.
man, who ate ripe fruit and took long baths and waited to please a king.  But, what said he couldn’t serve here, after Tony lost interest?  Perhaps there was some way out of this that fell short of life or death.  The war back home was over.  What was a soldier without a war? They needed soldiers, here, too.  Tony knew he had a good mind for it.  Perhaps he would grant Steve his freedom in return for his agreement to join Tony’s army.  Maybe Tony would even seek his counsel from time to time.  He could be useful.  Contribute something again.
Tony looked over at Dum-E, still faithfully attempting to, well, pat the Audi, like the ‘bot had found a shiny, new friend.  His mind flashed back to the first few weeks in the cabin, alone and free, ordering all his little shoeboxes and building his viewers, trying to look through the tiny hole he made for himself to see the world.
So, MIT was probably out.   At least for now.
“Glaring at the board!” Cam said, twisting around to yell over his shoulder.  Steve heard a muffled huff of laughter from the workshop, then moved his Knight to try to support from the fringes.
“Well, now, that’s really your call, I guess,” Brock replied, his voice careful, “but come on, we’ve been over this. It’ll be fine. Like you said, it’s one night, and Stark...
Walking across the hall, Steve couldn’t help but admire what must once have been a magnificent home.  Arched buttresses held up the ceiling.  Great chandeliers hung on long, metal chains, their candles dark for now.  The massive hearth that crackled with whatever kind of invitation one could read into a fire was finely carved, he noticed, with twisting columns of stone on each side and what he supposed was meant to be a kind of primitive crest above it, though whatever the heraldry was, it wasn’t familiar.  Just a circle, with lines through it, none of the usual lions or stags or roses that were favored now.  The huge table was made of fine oak, and the chairs around it were heavily carved with various woodland animals.  Everything appeared to be in good condition, though the entire place had a feeling of...disuse about it.  Not emptiness, though, Steve thought as he glanced over at the fire.  More like...slumber.  As if the castle were waiting for something to happen before it awakened.
“No, I want to throw it at your head. Tony, I’m short and skinny, not useless. I’m not saying this is ideal for an escape plan, but I can help, and you are going to get us both killed if you keep worrying about me instead of paying attention to what you’re doing,” Steve admonished, though he didn’t sound particularly upset, just frustrated.
“I thought that was your Tony-What-Did-You-Blow-Up-Face,” Tony muttered.  “Honey-bear, meet Steve Rogers, my temporary ball and chain while we handle this tiny bump in the road, which was mostly not my fault.”
“The King will like you,” Cam said, coming up to stand beside him.  That was what he wanted, right?  For the King’s interest to hold.  So that he and Cam would be safe.  That was the whole point of this.
“M'good,” Steve answered, drawing his gaze away from the night sky. “Can't believe we put a man on the moon. Can you imagine?”
“Yeah, sorry.  Just thinking,” Steve responded with a wan smile.
“When I deposited the check from mom’s insurance, it took a week, and that wasn’t anywhere near this much.  I’m 98% sure they’re going to think this is a total scam when I try to deposit this one,” Steve sighed.  “You’ll bail me out if they call the fraud department, right?” Steve asked, only half-jokingly.
“Have some bagel.  No jelly,” Steve replied, handing Tony the half with just cream cheese on it.  He chewed and sipped his coffee for a few blocks, then raised a hand to wave at the man across the bus from them who was staring at him in confusion.
Tony looked again at Natasha, who was swirling a cherry around by its stem in her drink, one delicate eyebrow raised in question.  When he looked back at Steve, there was a young man shaking Steve’s hand enthusiastically, holding on too long, long enough that it would require Steve to be the one to pull away, which Tony knew he hated to do.  Tony let out a choked-off huff of air as the young man leaned in and wrapped his arms around Steve in a tight, quick hug, patting him on the back and letting his hands linger there, as if he couldn’t quite let go once given the chance to hold on.
“Seems fair,” Steve agreed, pulling out his phone and hitting the button for Barnes.
“Right,” Tony agreed.  “Right, that’s…exactly what we wanted.  Great publicity.  Press is lapping it up.  Public loves us.  Kind of has this fairy tale vibe going, Pepper says.  Playboy bachelor meets stripper with a heart of gold, who tames said playboy’s wild ways, makes an honest man of him, all that.”
Steve closed his eyes for a moment and swallowed thickly.  “It is,” he said. He opened his eyes, but kept his gaze on the darkened car window.  Outside, red brake lights lined the driveway.
Shaking his head and turning to Bucky, he caught him rolling his eyes over Darcy’s head.  “Um…well, it was nice to meet you, ma’am,” Steve replied, “but I have to go.”
“Good night, Tony,” Steve said almost too quietly for Tony to hear, turning away before he finished getting the words out.
“Maybe,” Steve said, looking across the room at Tony with half-lidded eyes.    “I read about that.  Manhattan Project. Fat Man and Little Boy, they called them.”  He sounded…sad, Tony decided, though that wasn’t quite right.  There was a thread of frustration, almost…guilt, crawling through the words.  But that didn’t make sense.
Tony really hated Barton sometimes.
Ah, fuck it, Tony thought, rushing to put the pillow back in its place and pull the bedspread tight enough to even out the wrinkles from where he had been lounging.  It still didn’t look quite right, but after a moment’s indecision, he figured either Steve wouldn’t care or a mussed bed was really the evening’s goal, anyway.
“You’ll do,” Tony said finally, voice rough and thick, and clearly not as unaffected as he would like to seem, which did something to Steve’s stomach that made it flutter and roil.  “Just, you know.  It’s all good. Get what you want,” Tony blurted out, standing up from his seat, one hand going to the center of his chest in what Steve realized was something of a habit.  “I’ll just—I’ll be outside.  If you need anything, ask.  I’m sure any one of the Twelve Dancing Princesses out there can get you anything you need.”  He was out the dressing room door before Steve could formulate much of a response, so he ended up trying on a few other items before just grabbing some others in the same size and heading out.
“Uh…hey, Cap.  Long time, no see,” Tony greeted him, and that stung.  He was inadvertently punishing his friend because he couldn’t control his stupid libido.  And couldn’t possibly explain why he had been distant lately without a bald-faced lie, and he couldn’t bring himself to do that.  Hiding behind work and charity endeavors only went so far, and Tony was smart enough to see a smokescreen for what it was.
“Mine,” Tony whispered softly, peering down at Steve with a bright, fierce intensity. “Mine,” Tony repeated, sharper this time, framed by the low rumble of a growl underneath it. The word sent a shaft of pleasant warmth through Steve’s body, and he felt himself tremble, mouth parting to say something, but he couldn’t get his mind to find the right words. “Good morning, my love,” Tony said quietly.
“Uh-uh, not anyone. Not you.  You said,” Stark pointed at him, “But now you’re here. Look at that,” he smiled. It should have been obnoxious, Steve thought, but it somehow flew past that mark.
“Prosthetics,” Rhodey replied.
Anto looked down at the position of his hand, the sharp blade he held, and the proximity to the man’s groin, then realized…it was humor.  The man found the situation humorous and was sharing that with Anto. He blinked up at the Stranger in confusion. Clan understood humorous things that happened from time to time, if they saw it or heard it in a story, they could understand something that happened that was funny.  They could not understand an association between things that was funny in a way that could happen, but had not happened. They would never be able to find humor in a possibility, but this man could. Anto could. He understood why this was funny, why the man was making something humorous out of it, and what the man was suggesting could happen, but he had thought he was the only one who did this, who had these kinds of thoughts, and yet, this man casually understood why the situation was funny, as if that was something he did often.
Steve’s mind stuttered to a halt at the image, his heart pounding, his cock throbbing in echo.  His chest burned cold.
They talked.  Actually, they talked a lot, particularly during Steve’s little fishing expeditions.  And it wasn’t like Tony hadn’t figured out that was exactly what they were.
“I like you,” the King told him in a dark, husky voice, looking up at Steve from under his lashes, eyes dark and gleaming in the low, afternoon light.  He reached out and ran a finger around the collar at Steve’s throat, then down Steve’s chest, scoring a line of heat as it went.  “I like this.”
“Yeah, sorry…sorry about that, Tony.  It’s just been crazy lately,” Steve tried, because it was true.  Or true enough.  Only Tony could make him parse things this much.  “Brought some dinner.  Figured you’d be hungry after working so long.”  Steve cleared his throat a bit.  “Thought I’d maybe join you, if that’s ok?”  Because he’d known he wouldn’t be able to leave once he got down here.  It was too much like coming up for air after drifting underwater the past week.
your problems, the same way you love me and all of mine, and then you’ll have to actually start dealing with life again instead of going through the motions.  You can do this to yourself, this half-life you’ve been living, but you can’t do it to me.”
“Lovely.  You’ve done a fine job,” Zola praised.
“I guess not,” Steve agreed, somewhat reluctantly, screwing his face up into a frown. “Though, the Devil would probably lie about it.”
“I’m being responsible!  Admittedly, something of a new direction for me,” Tony agreed, rolling his eyes a bit.  “I mean me, on the company’s behalf, being responsible for the way that…”
Steve frowned a bit, a stray thought passing through his mind.  “You said you hadn’t done that in a while,” Steve remembered. “But, you’ve done, uh, that?  Before?”
Steve hesitated only slightly at the bridge.  Though chunks were missing from underneath, up close now, he could see that repairs had been made in the form of iron bars that criss-crossed through the rock at all manner of angles. What he had thought were merely pillars along the bridge actually held the remains of six statues that stood sentinel that along the bridge in various states of damage.
“What is it?” Steve asked into the darkness, a slight frown forming as he regarded Tony.
Stewart came by, probably to thank them or some such, Tony didn’t know or care.  Steve did the heavy-lifting for both of them, chat-wise, while Toy handed Stewart an orange chip, which he figured was really all that mattered.  By the time, they made it to the car, Tony could at least sit down comfortably.  Gratis ago tibi to you, Mr. Stout, he thought with a flash of annoyance directed at himself.  It was just a kiss.  A great kiss, okay, sure, fine, whatever, but still.  Just a kiss.  He was hardly some schoolboy who’d been mouthing at this hand until now.  Jesus fucking Christ, calm down, he admonished himself as he slid into the back of the car next to Steve.
“Would he think of the airlock, though?  I’d think of the airlock.  I’m not saying Steve wouldn’t, but sometimes, he’s more, punch-y-fight-y, you know?” Tony mused.
No one else paid much mind to Steve, though he did catch Rhodes giving him a quick, furtive look while Tony was listening to Strucker talk about the need for larger caches of oil.  Steve sat silently by Tony, mindful of the admonition not to speak.  Though, there was enough talk to go around without his contribution.  On and on, while food and drink was served by nameless slaves who garnered little acknowledgement.  When Steve thanked the one who served his drink, the poor man’s tray shook so badly, he nearly dropped it, which marked the only time Tony seemed to take notice.  Because Steve said something, Steve realized.  He ducked his head and said no more, though watched.  Listened.
“Please.  Please,” Steve entreated.  “I need to see him.  I think…maybe he needs to see me, too.  I know  you are only doing what you believe to be your duty to your King, but I know that you are not blind to him.  Tell me that you have no concerns, that he is happy and well, and I will return to my chamber until he calls for me.”
“Food.  Back.  No food for you,” Tony repeated, sitting up in his seat.  “Can’t have my ball-and-chain choking on his own idiocy.
“It looks like Christmas and Mardi Gras had an ugly baby,” Tony said, though his tone was more mildly amused than anything.
“He appears to be listening to the radio, Sir,” JARVIS told him. “Some of the
“Perhaps later,” Tony replied, a small smile tugging at his lips.
“You’re not going to mess this up,” Barnes assured him.  “You’re not, Steve.  We aren’t going to let you, first of all.  And Tony, man…Tony’s all in, you know that, right?  Maybe a bit to the extreme, but I can’t fault the guy too much.  I know what you were like after you two split, and if what Rhodes says is true, Tony was one foot into a scotch-filled grave.  No wonder you two can’t get your heads around this thing.  You’re both so busy panicking about how it’ll feel if this goes to shit to just sit back and be amazed that you even get a second chance at something like this.  Most people, they don’t ever get this.  Ever.  They get happy, they get content, they get fond or comfortable. They don’t this thing you and Tony have, where you’re like the air each other needs to breathe.  Now, you get a second chance at it, and I can’t watch you make the same damn mistake you did the first time around.  You gotta go to him a bit, Steve.  He’ll meet you more than halfway. That’s Tony.  But, you’ve got to be the one to move here.”
Firstpost, as it was known, whatever name it had originally borne lost to time, was a fairly nondescript inn situated at a crossroads.  It was popular with merchants traveling between the port and city who often spent the night, as Cam had chattily informed him at some point during their ride out of the city, whether this was out of necessity or some delight at sleeping in the bed of kings.
“Observatory’s fine,” Tony replied.  “My mom took me when I was a kid.  It’s fun.  Kinda cheesy, you know, but fun.”  The Tesla Coil was kind of neat in a blast from the past kind of way, with its weird noise and lightning-like discharges.  Energy without wires.  That was Tesla’s goal, or one of them, anyway, Tony remembered.  Fairly impossible, at least these days.  Until someone figures out hot fusion and the tiny problem of plasma containment once you actually managed to create the reaction.  Bumps in the road to progress, Tony thought with a small smile.
“Nah, you just do what he tells you, but he would like it if you did something else.  Like the other night, he said you were pretty when you’re quiet, but he likes it when you talk to him.  I can tell.  He tells you to stay put, but if you got up and came over to him, I think he would like it.  He just doesn’t want to tell you to,” Cam said as he picked up and put down various bits and pieces on his path through the room.  He opened a green jar, sniffed it, and put it back down with a disgusted face, then moved to a quill sticking out of an inkpot, tracing a finger up and down the feather.
about Tony.
, Steve thought, and this time, the thought blazed through his body like wildfire under his skin.
“But, mostly, you were mean to my husband. So, you know, go fuck yourself,” Tony said, then turned on his heel and left Estes staring, fish-mouthed, after him, while Pepper and Rhodey slowly stood and followed him out.
I'm on tumblr at sabrecmc.tumblr.com because I'm not creative enough to have different pseuds.  It is pretty much just Stony and stories.  Feel free to come on over!
“Ready?  Our carriage and escort are waiting,” Tony told him.
“Is he still watching?” Tony asked.  He took a sip of his milkshake and raised his eyebrows at the man across the table from him, who leaned to one side, then straightened and returned Tony’s gaze.
Tony turned as Steve approached, and Steve stopped, bowed his head and held out the plate of food. Tony raised an eyebrow and looked at Rhodes, who covered his mouth with a hand to hide a smile.
“Again, I am very sorry to have bothered you, Sir,” Steve added. He meant to go then, he was sure he did, yet he stood where he was, waiting. Waiting for what?  He wasn’t sure. The man’s leave, perhaps, that would be polite, though that wasn’t quite right.
Behind him, Steve lathered up his hands with shampoo, then threaded his fingers through Tony’s hair, lightly scraping his nails against Tony’s scalp.  Tony could feel it all the way to his toes. He’d heard the expression ‘making your toes curl’ before, but he’d never experienced it, at least until now.   Steve’s powerful hands were magic, digging into Tony’s scalp, scratching at his head, sending sparks of heat down to coil low in Tony’s belly. He stifled a moan, then gave up and let it out, leaning into Steve’s hands.  It felt amazing. Tony’s spine tingled with sensation as Steve’s fingers wove in and out of his hair, scrubbing the curls and massaging Tony’s head and neck as he went.
After a long moment, Tony managed to regroup enough to place a sloppy kiss against the side of Steve’s mouth.
“I don’t need a babysitter, Sta--Tony," Steve interjected, voice tight.
A slightly mollified Cam reached into the larder chest and unwrapped a piece of bread from the bundle, then took out a small jar of jam and spread it on top.  He passed it over to Steve, who dutifully took a bite.
“Slowly, not too much, it’s still warm,” Tony admonished, tipping the cup up. Warm tea, thick with honey, slid down Steve’s throat, coating it in the soothing mixture.
“Social conventions. So passé,” Tony protested, grinning wickedly in return.
“That wasn’t what I said.  Exactly,” Steve protested, brow drawing together into a frown.
“Sure, Steve,” Natasha said calmly, mouth pursing into a moue as she considered her cards.  “Your move, Tony,” she said slyly, looking over at him from beneath her lashes.
“My thought exactly,” Sitwell agreed.
his robots all agreed were not cries of pain. Driving down the highway with the top down, the wind in his hair, music blasting.  A pregnant woman with her hand over her belly. The perfume his mother always wore. The palladium core smoking after he took it from his body. The first time he had sex, with Megan Mahoney in the back of her father’s limosine outside of Junior Assembly.  His first glimpse of the whole earth rising in his ship’s window. A doctor’s visit for something he didn’t even remember. The way the Mark I felt when he powered it up that first time in the cave.
“Oh, more often than you can possibly know,” Pepper said slowly with a thin smile.
“Tell that to my knees.  You don’t know what to do with all of this,” Jarvis began, brows drawing together in a frown.  “And that is, unfortunately, understandable.  You said yourself, it’s overwhelming. Something I expect that Captain Rogers did not consider in his, ah. Eagerness.  You can’t see that maybe…I’m suggesting, perhaps there is no choice here, Tony,” Jarvis said, his voice going quiet, but punching each word out with force.  “Except in your mind, which requires some sort of balance to your life that allows only so much happiness and not a drop more.”
Steve frowned for a moment, considering.   He couldn’t deny that he enjoyed what happened between him and Tony, even the punishment.  Sometimes, maybe especially the punishment. He liked having the decisions taken out of his hands, for once.  As soon as Tony told him what to do, it was like a vent of pressure releasing in his mind. And there was something comforting about putting his trust in Tony. Surrendering to Tony required letting go of control, of fear, of everything.  He didn’t have to think, just feel and react. Yet, he felt oddly protected in those moments, like nothing could truly hurt him. Tony would take care of him, he was sure of it, and as much as he liked giving up control, he liked that certainty, too.  There was an incredible sense of closeness, almost oneness, in the knowledge that Tony would know what he wanted. In those moments, he belonged to Tony, and Tony to him, in a way that went far beyond any collar, and there was something deeply powerful in that, Steve thought.  And almost more than anything, he liked being able to please Tony, to give him something that Tony so desperately craved. Tony deserved that, even if he didn’t think he did. To be able to give that kind of pleasure and validation to someone like Tony…it was beautiful.
The man was impeccably dressed in breeches, boots, a coat and neckcloth, all in fine material, over a trim frame. Slightly older than Steve, Steve thought, though something about the man made it difficult to hazard much of a guess, especially in this light.  He had dark hair and a neatly trimmed beard in a fashion that Steve had never seen before that contrasted well against his pale skin. Around his neck, he wore a necklace made of a thick, gold chain, with a blue jewel of some kind dangling from its center.  Steve was so startled by the man’s sudden appearance that he could only gape for a moment, before he remembered that he had wandered into what must be the man’s bedroom, which was quickly followed by the realization that whatever thoughts he might have entertained about a lonely leper or disfigured hermit were clearly very wrong.
“Me?” Tony shrugged.  “Have at it.”
Tony huffed in gratitude.  “Ready to get this party started?”
“Ethicists,” Peggy said, making a scoffing sound.  “Same people who said the world couldn’t handle evidence of aliens, I assume. They don’t know what the world needs, only what they think it fears.  They don’t know
The man looked utterly foreign to Tony, like he had stepped out of one of the stories Jarvis told him when he was a boy where caves were home to trolls and mountains of fire birthed dragons.  Beside him stood another man, just as strange looking, with shaggy brown hair over a thick brow that framed a dark scowl, currently aimed at Obie.  What was most remarkable about him was that one of his arms was molded of the same strange, grey metal, yet it moved as if it wasn’t metal at all.  In any other situation, Tony would have itched to touch it, figure it out, but now, he could barely concentrate on anything beyond the man’s face, which revealed nothing, except a slight air of contempt that Obie seemed to fail to grasp.  Next to the man with the remarkable arm was a woman with brilliant red hair, who seemed uninterested in the proceedings, and beside her, a dark-skinned man, and he, at least, was attired in regular armor and his eyes, when they rested on Tony for a moment, were shrewd, but not unkind.  A large bird sat perched on his shoulder, sporting a leather hood over its face as it twitched and turned, almost like it was attempting to follow along with the proceedings and frustrated by it’s prohibition.
“He fell,” Steve said quietly, turning back towards the view.  “We were in the mountains.  A bit like this, come to think.  It was colder, at least then.  Beautiful, though.  Like something out of a Christmas card.  I remember thinking that I wanted to paint it.  I still do, sometimes.  Start trying to paint it.  But I—“ Steve stopped and dipped his chin to his chest.  “He fell.  He fell, and I didn’t catch him.  Wasn’t fast enough.  That wasn’t supposed to be happen.  Not anymore.  Me not being fast enough, I mean.”
“I know you do,” Steve said. He stared up at Tony from his place in the bed, a bleak, cold sadness searing its way into his chest, but on its heels came a certainty he hadn’t felt in a long time. “I love you, too.”
“I’m not—I’m fine, and I’m serious, Steve, I do. I love you,” Tony insisted.  “I love you so much.  It’s like, it’s crazy how much and it scares me sometimes, and everyone kept saying it was too fast and we’re too young, but I do. I love you. I lov—” he broke off with a muted squeak as Steve shifted him on his lap.  “Hey,” Tony admonished.
wrong with him-- like he was some kind of backwards, sideshow oddity.
“You look lovely,” Jarvis admonished lightly.  “Come and introduce me to your Captain.”
“I never should have let you come by yourself,” Steve said against his friend’s ear.
Someone else.
“Matt is one of their own.  A fighter, born and raised, whose father stood the Gate for years. They trust him, and despite his limitation, he sees the needs of his people and the realm quite clearly,” Tony replied.  “There is much to admire there.  The journey is long, arduous in some ways, at least compared to life here, but I think you will enjoy it.  The way that you arrived here…” he broke off, shaking his head, a frown creasing his brow.  “You know I would change that if I could.”
“Absolutely nothing about this is frivolous,” Tony said, staring up at Steve for a long moment.  Steve gripped Tony by the wrist and tugged him up, pulling him close enough to wrap an arm around.
“This thing on?” Rhodey asked with a raised eyebrow.  He picked the handle of the grill up and peeked inside, then shook his head.
Tony felt itchy heat rise up his back, making him slightly dizzy and nauseous. He groaned a bit, something…he needed something…it would, if he could…it would…it would…this would go away or not away, but would feel good somehow, which was ridiculous because how could this feel good, ever?  That was crazy, but it  might be okay if he could just…just…
“If you ever leave my bed without permission again, I’ll chain you to it,” the King told him as Steve’s eyes snapped to his, wide with shock.  The King stood up then and walked back to his chair, sitting down and pulling out another volume from the stack of books while Steve looked on in mute helplessness.  “You may go,” the King said without looking up from his book.
“Small Hands,” Tony called out.
Steve moved behind where Tony stood, body slightly slanted towards the mirror.  Tony’s eyes were staring at the glass, but they were unfocused, mouth open as his breath came in low, shallow pants.   The fingers of one hand were curved, as if he could gain purchase against the smooth surface, the other pressed flat, so hard the flesh had gone white.
“Everything’s great,” Steve replied. “Uh, absolutely no cravings. Zero. And the Thai food place even sent extra spring rolls this time.”
“I had the thought. Crazy as it seemed at the time.  I was pretty sure I was drunk and horny and that was half of it, but then you name dropped Barnes, and, well, it was too much to be a coincidence,” Tony said.  “Plus, Aunt Peggy, while a far better liar than you, wasn’t exactly against my little exploration kick. She didn’t break, I’ll give her that, but, well. Two-and-two together, ah. Yeah.  I figured it was you. Captain America from the future, crazy as that sounds. Even crazier was that after a while, I convinced myself that you knew me. In the future. That--that maybe that meant something.”
“Tony, it’s okay,” Steve replied gently.  He sounded hesitant and kept blocking the water, as if he expected Tony to bolt if he got a little dewy, but there was no judgment in his voice, just understanding and sympathy.  “Do you want to get out?”
“Well.  Yeah,” Tony replied in a tone laced with confused fondness. “You’re worth coming after.”
, before he forgot why he cared, as Tony’s tongue scraped the inside of his mouth, delving deep.
“Let me see you,” Tony murmured, so Steve turned his head to look at Tony, kneeling between his legs. Whatever it was Tony saw there must have been satisfactory because Tony groaned and threw his head back and Steve felt the fingers inside him begin to work him more, pressing deeper, pushing him apart, and angling just so.  By the time Tony added a third, Steve was done with waiting, too full of want to care, just pushing back against Tony’s hand and grabbing at the sheets for purchase.  He watched through half-lidded eyes as Tony withdrew his fingers and moved behind him, felt his body stretch at the invasion, clench then release as the head of Tony’s cock pressed in.  Tony withdrew a little, leaving on the tip inside, and then pushed forward in one long thrust, burying himself deep within Steve.  Steve was only able to utter Tony’s name, over and over, a request, a demand, a prayer, and Tony was thrusting in long, languid strokes, hands on Steve’s hips, nonsense words of praise that nevertheless managed to make Steve feel good, so good, that he could be good like this for Tony, as Tony pushed in and out, over and over again.  And then he felt Tony’s pace pick up, become more erratic, his own body tightening in response, heard the echo of Tony’s long, low groan and a few more strokes and warmth shot through his abdomen as Tony collapsed forward, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder, eyes squeezed shut, breathing harsh and he came back to himself.
Tony let out a laugh that wasn’t quite bitter, but could have been. “You make it sound so simple, sometimes. I don’t know if I despise that ability or envy it.”
Alpha out there who will want to be the one to break him in.  There always is,” she said with a shrug.
“Not a bad idea,” Steve said, almost noncommittally.
happy.  Or, he would be, probably once he got out of here and back to Brock.  It was just strange being here alone, that was all.  Though, maybe it was okay to admit he would have liked to see Tony one more time, just to say goodbye, but that wasn’t what Tony wanted, and he had to respect that, he thought with a sigh as he sat the pillow back down on the bed.
“Get him on the table!” Bruce shouted, point towards the medical table near the center of the jet.   “Thor, on his side.  On his side. Careful, careful.  Nat, I need—God—I don’t know—I’m not—shit,” Bruce said, running both hands through his hair, gripping huge chunks of it tightly in his hands.  “I’m not this kind of doctor.  I’m a biochemist for fuck’s sake.
Steve and Tony leave the city and begin a journey that will change everything.
He pressed his mouth to Tony’s, catching a puff of warm breath on his lips, the scratch of beard on his chin, and the hint of taste just beyond Tony’s lips.  He had no idea what to do, he realized.  For all they’d done, Tony had never really kissed him, and that left his sole experience with the tavern girl Bucky sent his way with cheap ale and what Bucky later called a heart full of patriotism, though Steve didn’t think it had been her heart Bucky had been eyeing.
Tomorrow, he would deposit the check, and that would be that, Steve told himself firmly.  He had a life, a boyfriend, and now, the means to do whatever he wanted.  Turning this into some ridiculous romantic fantasy was an exercise in futility.  Besides, it wasn’t that he really wanted anything with Tony like that.  He was just caught up in everything that happened.  Who wouldn’t be?  Indulging in a little harmless fantasizing was fine, but it ended first thing in the morning at the bank.  Get the check deposited and move on with his life.  There.  Decision made.
The boy would not go with him, Steve realized with a jolt.  Cam had nothing calling him away from this, and a better life here than anything he had ever known.  If Steve left, he would have to trust Cam’s fate to Tony’s kindness.  He turned back around and looked out at the horizon again.  It left an emptiness in his chest to think about, but, strangely, he had no real fear that Tony would take out any anger on Cam.  Not anymore.  Tony wasn’t like that.  That much, Steve was sure of, though it was one of the few things in this place that he could attest to with any certainty.  It didn’t ensure Cam’s safety, but…perhaps there was another way to do that.
Tony looked up at Steve, who had his arm curved around Tony’s waist, offering him some support as he walked towards the elevator.  Steve smiled down at him, all soft and beautiful, his expression bright with wonder. This time, when his heart skipped a beat, Tony wasn’t afraid.  He reached across his chest and took Steve’s other hand in his, giving it a light, reassuring squeeze, then twined their fingers together until the gleaming metal of Steve’s ring lined up with the older, slimmer silver of Tony’s band.  He smiled, nodded his head once, and leaned it against Steve’s shoulder.
, Zola smirked.
“People really do this?” Steve heard himself ask.
, Tony told himself.
“Ah, Sir, ah, Your—Your—” one of the guards stammered. He reached out, then stopped, hand suspended midair as Steve brushed past him.
“I guess it makes more sense now. Why you were so mad, I mean. I still shouldn't have yelled.  That night. At the hotel. My dad. He yelled, you know? I don't do that,” Steve went on. Tony didn't know, but what else was new? Steve had never talked about his dad, except to say he wasn't in the picture, and Tony remembered thinking something along the lines of, 'Lucky you,' and letting the whole thing drop. “I didn't mean to scare you, though. No excuse, but. I didn't mean to,” Steve finished,mouth twisting into a grimace around the last words, for the first time in the entire recitation, every fucking terrible thing that had gotten screwed up, this was the fist time Tony could hear the slip of absolute, gutted pain into Steve's voice, the way it cracked and pitched on the end, the slight tremor that gave it away.
’” Stane said, making his voice go all soft and lanky on the last in a truly terrible impersonation of a teenager.  Tony’s face softened though. A smile tugged at his lips, just barely, and he wouldn’t let it break, Steve could tell, not in front of Howard, but it was there.
“I needed to. I needed this, Steve.  Just me an’them.  Just for a bit,” Bucky said, voice thick, nearly shaking with the effort not to let more out than he wanted to.  “And you needed to come with him, Steve.  You and Tony.  You needed to come together.”  As always seemed to be the case, Bucky knew him better than he knew himself, Steve thought, clutching at his friend’s back.  He hadn’t realized how much he had missed Bucky’s steady presence until now.  They stayed like that a beat longer, then Steve heard Tony shuffle a bit behind them.  He turned, releasing Bucky, though he couldn’t quite pull away just yet, keeping both hands on Bucky’s shoulders.
Steve couldn’t say why it was so easy to run towards the thing he had only barely escaped those years ago and so damned hard to reach for something else, but he’d run out of reasons to stay here some time ago and had to start asking himself why he was looking for reasons. Tony was waiting for him, and more than anything, he wanted to be with Tony. It was as true as the fact that Steve was still sitting here, leagues away from him, when he could have Tony in his arms, losing himself in the way Tony made him feel.
It wasn’t as long as Steve would have liked before he felt the familiar tingling tightness scraping everything out of him almost too suddenly, like it was being ripped out of him from somewhere deep inside. He came shouting Tony’s name, hips canting roughly through the last few strokes in and out of Tony as he rode the cascade of feeling. He collapsed on top of Tony, almost numb from the force of it, one hand still trapped between them, wrapped around Tony. He could only respond somewhat dazedly when Tony crushed his mouth to his for a searing kiss.
“He’s going to be alright, Tony,” Coulson assured him, his voice going gentle, careful, like he had a hand out and was afraid Tony might bolt with any sudden movement.  “Really.”
Tony looked over at the clock, where the numbers marking it as just past one in the morning glowed somewhat accusingly from the nightstand. With a frustrated grunt, he stood up and walked to the door of his room.  The cabin was quiet, he noted, when he pulled the door open just enough to peer down the hallway.  Steve’s room was dark.  Tony padded carefully down the hall to the living room.  The television was black.  The Doomsday clock on the mantle ticked off the seconds.
.  And Captain America—Captain America is a legend.  The perfect hero.  Knight in shining armor and all that.  You’re…Steve,” Tony replied, ceasing his wandering-fingers stroking and twisting his head to look up at Steve.
So, he’d designed an AI to do the coursework for him.  Even named it after Jarvis, though he told him that it stood for Just Another Rather Very Intelligent System.  Hey, lots of people had study-buddies, Tony figured.  Same diff.
“Indeed,” Tony sighed, looking down at the papers covering the table and tapping his finger on the edge of one of them.
“Okay,” Steve said.  Wormholes? He didn’t know what that meant.  Maybe it was like with the macramé. A test in a language Steve didn’t understand.  “Really?  Um, well,” he continued, trying to remember what he was supposed to be saying. Tony was still toying with the dog tags, holding them up just below his mouth and peering down at the letters.  Steve felt a hot rush of heat warm his skin, then settle low, and he realized he was half hard. He adjusted his jacket, drawing Tony’s eyes to him, and that was—not helping, Steve decided.
Tony’s wet chest brushed up and down over Steve’s as he writhed in Steve’s arms, slick skin sliding over the peaks of Steve’s nipples until he hissed out his pleasure, hips jerking up, seeing friction.
“You love me!” Tony yelled back.
?” Tony questioned, looking back and forth between Clint and the set of mugs sitting rather accusingly on the counter.  “There are two of us.”
A footnote.  In a journal article from the sixties.  Not even a peer-reviewed journal, just something that aspired to it.  That was all he had been able to find.  Doctor Simon Brewster, PhD, speculated that there could be an occurrence when a mate dies in utero, before the mark forms on the fetus but after the bond develops, though Doctor Brewster carefully noted that he could find no record of such a thing actually happening.  Maybe no one wanted to know about it.  Why would you?  It wasn’t something that could be cured.  There were no colored ribbons, no fundraisers, no pink vacuums or catchy bumper stickers.  What would be the point?
“Uh, thank you J, good man, that will just be all of that, then,” Tony said in a clipped tone as he hit one of the buttons on his phone’s screen.
“Really, Tony,” Coulson replied.  “Promise.”
Tony looked around the room. There were two screwdrivers, an assortment of screws and hexagonal washers, and a power drill with three different bits sitting in a case on the coffee table.
“Not particularly,” Tony replied easily.
“I somehow don’t think his thought process went, hey, maybe people are good and the media will be nice,” Rhodey argued, probably reasonably, Tony couldn’t be sure.  Steve was coming home. Steve was coming home and would take care of him, and as much as he hated the idea of what everyone would say, he wanted Steve.  He wanted Steve to swoop in and make everything okay, because he really did feel truly, deeply shitty.
“I just…I thought, maybe…” Tony began, then clamped mouth shut and looked at Peggy.
“Happy,” the driver said as he slid behind the wheel and closed the door.
All the king’s horses and all the king’s men, Tony thought.  They just keep putting Steve back together again.  I do.  I do that, now.  He’s mine.  You can’t have him.  He wasn’t sure who he meant or who he was talking to.  Maybe himself, but he was sure he meant it.
“He’s a menace,” Tony replied fondly. “
“Yeah, see, Cap, and far be it for me to agree with Stark, but it’s maybe been awhile since you’ve flown commercial.  These days…not exactly the friendly skies up there,” Clint remarked as he stacked pancakes on his plate.
The edges of their dresser mirror were stuffed with a collage of photos, mostly from their travels. Some from college.  Tony and Rhodey in their graduation robes, holding their diplomas and grinning like idiots with their arms slung over each other’s shoulder.  One of a five-year old Tony being held by Jarvis, who was wearing a truly awful Christmas sweater.  Rudolph. With a glowing nose.  Tony had loved that sweater.  He hadn’t really understood why Jarvis didn’t wear it all the time.  A black and white photo with a crease at the top right corner and a neat, white edge of the Commandos sitting in a trench, helmets pulled low over dirty faces with sandbags stacked around them.  Morita was sleeping with his head on Dernier’s shoulder.   Barnes was standing, back to the camera, looking down the barrel of a rifle that pointed out between two sandbags and a length of barbed wire.  Tony always wondered, why that photo.  Why that moment.  Why right
“Well, they did the big wedding thing up at Clint's a year or so ago.  In this big barn.  It was actually really nice, all decked out with lights, and they had a string quartet in the loft.  But, it was, I guess about three—no, almost four years ago, when they officially tied the knot," Steve answered.  “Nat was visiting the base.  She was a civilian contractor, but doing intelligence work for the military.  Showed up and surprised him.  Next thing I know, he’s dragging me out of bed and telling me to go down to the boardwalk—Kandahar has this whole outdoor shopping strip, TGIFridays and everything, it was crazy---Anyway, he wakes me up and tells me to go find a ring.  I suppose they just figured, why wait, you know?”
“Thir—fourteen,” Steve stammered.  “Fourteen.”  Please, let that be right, Steve thought beseechingly.
