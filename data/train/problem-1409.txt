“It wasn’t a mistake. You don’t kiss someone by mistake. That doesn’t happen, John.”
Sherlock's breathing is quite erratic against his ear, his heart hammering in his chest, the sweater he's wearing feels delectably plush and teddy bearish as it strains and threatens to tear, which John hadn't really been a fan of until now. John holds him so forcefully, he's equally afraid he might break him as he is of him escaping. He thinks maybe he's gone mad.
When they finally agree on the flat number, John knocks on the door and enters. Sherlock follows, tapping his feet on the doormat to get rid of some gravel residue.
And Sherlock... he exchanges a look with her, everything spreading out in slow motion as she walks out the revolving door, putting her glasses back on. John looks between them. He doesn't know what that was but he knows he didn't like it.
“What?” Nigel blinks.
It crawls toward him, impossibly graceful and unhurried in its movements, and he fumbles like a poor insect caught in a web, digging his heels in and back-pedaling in the gravel, sand shunting in all directions.
His eyes dart forward on some vaguely coherent impulse, but there’s nothing to see, besides a lapping waterline and a few sparse rocks. Mind games.
After combing through every inch of the extremities of the island for the so much as a shred of human civilization and a brief encounter with a creature he is partly convinced he hallucinated, John reawakens the next day to find himself still stranded on the chaparral island. After brief moment lamenting what he remembers of the events that put him there, he sighs heavily through his nose and resolves to utilize the daylight for gathering extendible material to light a beacon.
Her unmistakable eyes blaze back at him, seeming to enjoy the wash of transparent emotions that play over his face. He supposes he shouldn't be surprised to find her here, where the forces of government secretly congregate and interlock. For those looking to insinuate themselves into the annals of power there’s really no better place to be. He tries to repress his strong distaste of the way her gaze cuts right through him - like how one would look at plaything-- like he's something for sport, for amusement.
John. He’d think of John while he waited. Sentiment was hateful, terrible, weakening, but he couldn’t stop it anymore when it came to John. He made everything not so overwhelming. He made the noise quieter. He made Sherlock’s head quieter. He was a steady presence by his side that Sherlock could never do without again. Not after his time in Serbia. He rolled his shoulders unconsciously thinking of those scars. He still hadn’t told John. Well. He’d told him small bits and pieces but nothing that would lead towards John inferencing that. John deserved to know, but Sherlock couldn’t risk him being upset and leaving. He needed John to make it quiet and to minimize the force of hateful words as they slammed into Sherlock at lightning speed in a crowd or at a crime scene. John was a lifeline and Sherlock didn’t know if he could even breathe if John Watson walked out of his life.
“I’m sorry, could I see it now please?” He waited, preparing himself for John to fumble, and reveal that the surprise was an excuse to cover up an affair.
“It was a car accident. Four people. Three adults and one child, a little girl. We did all we could, but both of the parents are dead. The girl is in critical condition in ICU as is the other adult we haven’t been able to identify yet. The girl’s grandparents have been notified and if she pulls through she’ll have to go and live with them, but they’re in their late seventies. They aren’t able to be caretakers for very long. If the girl wakes up her life as she knew it is going to be over. Of course, apparently there were joints found in the wrecked car and a test of the dead parents showed it was in their system so who knows, maybe living with the grandparents will be an improvement. But she’s going to have to wake up and learn that both her parents are dead-,” John broke off shaking his head. “I can’t even imagine what she’s going to have to go through and I keep thinking about what could have been done differently but really I know they would have died no matter what, so I don’t know why I’m still focused on it.” Sherlock stroked John’s back gently.
There was the hugging in the waiting room, the hand holding, the rubbing circles in his skin, asking about his eating, and now the kiss on the forehead. He couldn’t figure it out. Was John finding comfort in his time of stress and grief in the only way he knew how, intimate physical contact? Or was this simply something they started doing now-the kissing-just as the hand holding was definitely becoming a more common event. He wasn’t sure. He definitely needed more data about everything, and a cigarette. But first, a trip to the cafeteria for coffee and a muffin for John, because he’d told Sherlock that he was one of the two people that he cared most about in the entire world, and Sherlock could die happy right then. (Though, if he was being honest, he wanted to hear John’s voice calling him love for the rest of eternity.).
“Are you alright?” He asked, rubbing his hands against Sherlock’s arms. He shook his head, and held out a clipboard to John.
a suggestion, Sherlock. When I come back you better have eaten something.” He disappeared through the door and reappeared just as fast, darting back into the room to press a brief kiss against Sherlock’s forehead.
“They wouldn’t let me see her and I couldn’t do her paperwork and I don’t know how she’s doing,” It spilled out of his mouth before he’d had a chance to gather what he wanted to say into something more comprehensible and put together.
“Mycroft!” He hiccuped, which lost some of the effect and John laughed.
“Hi, yeah Mycroft? Could you send over Sherlock’s surprise? He’s gotten entirely the wrong idea and thinks I’m having an affair. Yeah it should be fine. Thanks,” John hung up his phone and resumed his place beside Sherlock on the sofa, one arm wrapped around his waist the other pulling Sherlock into his body.
“Isn’t it just as bad for you to try to diagnose your own daughter as it is for me to search the internet for an amateur diagnosis?” One withering look from John wiped the faintest of smiles off of Sherlock’s face and he took a deep breath.
“Thank you. I’m sorry about this,” John wasn't good at taking comfort. He was always the comforter, and it was amazing it had taken this long for him to attempt to apologize for needing comfort.
. I only deal with your bratty son’s sprained wrist, which could have been dealt with at your regular physician on Monday
“I love you,” Sherlock told him quietly, in the safety of their darkened flat leaned forward to kiss the top of John’s head. John propped himself on one elbow to look at Sherlock through the darkness and grinned at him, something closer to his normal smile, though still not quite there. It must have been a particularly bad death, Sherlock noted to himself.
“I’ll tell you what. John introduced me to this new game on my mobile, you play against someone you know and try to get a larger score by making words with the letters they give you. It’s kind of like scrabble. I’ll send you the link and we can play while you wait. That’ll keep you distracted.” Normally he hated
“I’m sorry John. I didn’t know what to do,-” Sherlock started frantically but he cut off as John shook his head against his chest.
With steadier hands, he pulled out his phone to check it. Texts from Mummy and a missed call from Mrs Hudson. Tedious, he hated phone calls, but knew that she’d expect a returned call. One more deep lungful of his cigarette and then he called her, leaning against the railing of the fire escape watching the smoke curling off of his cigarette.
“Sir? Were you getting something?” Sherlock jolted back to the present to see the cashier staring at him. He quickly stared at the menu and ordered a coffee and two muffins. He may not have any plans to eat his muffin but pretenses were very important with John Watson. Sherlock collected his purchases and made his way back to John’s office, forcing himself not to make a stop at the door leading to the fire escape again.
“You panicked is what you’re saying. And you called your mother!” Sherlock looked away, refusing to dignify that with an answer, and trying to suppress the worry bubbling up inside of him. He wasn’t quite successful.
“She deserved it. When not overreacting over her child or in public, she occupies most of her time by speaking her mind without a filter, allowing any racist, homophobic or otherwise offensive comment leave her mouth unheeded. She has driven her husband to drinking due to her behavior and her refusal for him to divorce her. Someone had to attempt to put her in her place. I would have expected you to ignore her.” John lifted the corner of his mouth in a half hearted smirk.
“They won’t tell me anything about her condition because I’m not related to her. Can you do her paperwork? I tried to pretend I was, but I don’t know your family medical history...” He trailed off, embarrassed, grateful when John silently accepted the forms without any quips that he could just deduce it or about how good of a liar Sherlock normally was. His heart surged knowing that John knew he was in too much of a panic to deduce much of anything, and Sherlock didn’t want attention drawn to it. He despised the lapse in physical contact as he resumed his seat and John took the one beside him, clipboard balanced in his lap.
Obligatory text to his mother taken care of. John should be proud of him. Right. John wasn’t there and because John wasn’t there he had sent him off on a quest for food in the hospital cafeteria. His transport would reject food currently, but he could get a coffee and something that would keep for John, he would be hungry at the end of his shift.
“Sherlock, luv, how are you?” Mrs. Hudson answered on the second ring, she must have had her phone on her. Surprising, rarely ever did she carry it on her person no matter how much John nagged her about it in case she fell again.
But how are YOU, Lockie?
“You should sleep. You always feel better in the morning. I’ll be here to keep the nightmares away,” He promised. John’s breath was already evening out, Sherlock felt the rise and fall of John’s chest against his own and John’s breath against his neck as he drifted off in the safety of his partner's arms.
“Not sure. We played this morning, and she went down for her nap fine but she wasn’t fine when she woke up. But I’ve cross referenced multiple sources and-,” He broke off as John’s hand clasped his forearm and slid down to take his hand, his thumb rubbing soft circles into Sherlock’s skin.
He hadn’t gone to bed last night until John had woken up, but then he’d laid down and been unable to let sleep take him. The deductions of John that he had concluded at some time around 3am kept bouncing through his head and he had no idea what to do about it. The best result was clearly a direct approach. He didn’t want it to end, but he conclusively realized that he could no longer live like this. It was becoming like Victor all over again, and while John was not going to introduce him to highly addictive illegal substances in order to keep him around for sex, the knowledge that he was no longer good enough for John may drive him back to them on his own. As much as he missed the drugs, that was no longer a path that he wished to go down. Lestrade would keep the cases from him then, and, without John, he was definitely going to need the cases.
“Oh, no Sherlock, no.” John’s voice was incredibly soft and tender. John rarely, if ever, spoke to him like that, and Sherlock frantically filed it away in his mind palace to reply constantly. “It wasn’t that. I don’t think either of us could have done anything to stop this from happening. She could have gotten a virus or infection anywhere. Please stop thinking like that. This is
A quick glance around the flat told him everything that he needed to know about John’s day. He’d come home and turned on the kitchen light. He hadn’t gone into their bedroom because the door was still open a quarter of an inch just as Sherlock had left it when he exited it this morning. John also had not gone to the bathroom, it’s door still open just halfway as Sherlock had also left it this morning. John was still in his work clothes. His work bag was on the floor beside the front door but he was still wearing his jacket. John had simply come home from work, turned a light on in the darkening flat and immediately laid down on Sherlock. He most likely hadn’t mean to fall asleep waiting for him to exit his mind palace, Sherlock reasoned, but John often slept an average two hours more after a hard day at work. And hard days at work had been all the more frequent once he quit the horrible job at that boring surgery and took a more exciting job in the trauma center at St. Bart's. Not that Sherlock minded, he enjoyed being close to John.
Make sure that you tell John that you called us so that one of you will update us.
“Well, good morning love. Finally decided to greet the living world?” John asked cheerfully from behind his newspaper where he sat facing Sherlock, yet still focused on the daily headlines, no doubt keeping an eye out for potential cases. Sherlock’s heart lurched and ached at John’s casual use of Sherlock’s most common pet name. John was cheating on him. Sherlock was not his love, not nearly in any sense and his chest ached, his stomach curdling small and cold into his abdomen. Tears pricked his eyes without his permission.
John made a quiet snuffling sound against Sherlock’s chest and he watched as John, still completely asleep, burrowed himself more firmly against Sherlock’s body. He lifted his hand and carefully began to thread his fingers through John’s short blonde hair.
“Have you eaten? Or should we get Chinese?” Sherlock let one hand continue carding through John’s hair while the other laid gently against John’s back. John propped his chin against Sherlock’s chest to look at him.
“Oh, sweetheart. Breathe. Come on, deep breaths for me, love. I’m not cheating on you, I swear. I’m so sorry love. I should have realized that sneaking behind your back wasn’t a good idea but I wanted to surprise you. Just breathe for me, and when you’ve calmed down we can talk about it, yeah?” John wasn’t cheating on him? John was trying to surprise him? He struggled to get his breathing back to some semblance of normal and John held him until the tears stopped, and then guided him to the sofa.
“Please don’t tell me you’ve been sitting here on WebMD and Mayo Clinic trying to diagnose Rosie.” Sherlock didn’t answer, watching John’s thumb instead. It was comforting, what he was doing, and Sherlock didn’t ever want the contact to stop. He wished their hands could fuse together as one so that he’d never have to let go of John. (He was sensing a pattern in his need for comfort from John with this increase in touching between them. How would he ever survive once Rosie was better and John no longer touched him like this? He could only relive every moment in his mind palace so many times.)
“I didn’t mean to wake you,” Sherlock forced his hands to keep running through John’s hair. It still shocked him that he was
“What if it was my mold cultures?” John raised his head then, an eyebrow quirked upwards in a silent question. “What if they made her sick? I thought I kept her an adequate distance away from them at all times but maybe-,”
Hospitals are tedious. SH
They took her back and I haven’t gotten any updates yet. Will text when I do. SH
“Are you sure you’re alright? You’re only this clingy when there’s a particularly hard death. Do you think that you need to visit Ella again?” Sherlock carefully guided John into their bedroom. He knew John hated the therapist but he wasn't good at feelings. He didn't know how to help this.
How are you doing, darling?
“I want John,” His voice broke and the tears were welling up in his eyes. He really really didn’t want to cry on the phone with Mrs. Hudson but he didn’t know what to do anymore. He always had John to help with the emotional side of things.
“It doesn’t matter if they tell John because John is still on duty and cannot tell me. I don’t understand. He found me in the waiting room and he gave his permission for them to keep me up to date but that doesn’t seem to be good enough. So what if I’m not biologically related to her, I care for her all of the time and John gave his permission-,” He had to stop as his voice started to crack and he took another inhale of his cigarette, flicking the ash off of the fire escape watching it sail away on the wind.
“When I was in the A&E waiting room I was trying to find a diagnosis for Rosie. John showed up and took me back to his office. He told me to get something to eat in the cafeteria but I’m on the fire escape smoking.” He had to pull the phone slightly away from his ear at Mrs. Hudson’s shriek of his name.
“I guess I’ve just dealt with enough shit recently, I’m not about to act as if she’d got it right when she had everything all wrong. Oh fuck.” His pager was beeping again and John fumbled to silence it. “I’ve really got to go. You can stay here until they come for you with news about Rosie. I told the receptionist you’ll be in here so they should be fine with keeping you in the loop even though you’re not related to her. Have you eaten today?” John paused halfway out the door, his concern for Sherlock paramounting any patient who could be dying. Sherlock was having a hard time processing John’s question, his brain stuck on the phrase ‘when she had everything all wrong.’ Did that mean
“We can go to bed,” Sherlock reassured him, and let John peel himself from Sherlock’s body and pull him to his feet before John’s arms were around him again.
“Of course you will. I don’t trust her with anyone as much as I do with you, even when you take her to crime scenes to investigate murders. You would never intentionally put her in harm’s way and if you did, I know that you’ll keep her safe, especially with Moriarty and his web still out there...” The unspoken mention of Sherlock’s two years away to wipe out the web (Unsuccessful due to numerous kidnappings, sessions of torture, and a slight miscalculation on his affection for one John Watson) hung between them for a moment and Sherlock wished he could grab John and pull him close enough that their persons began to intermix so that John could feel exactly how desperate and alone Sherlock felt without John during those years. (That pattern again. Was it normal to feel such a desperate need to completely
“Shut up Sherlock.” He pulled Sherlock even closer to him. Was it even possible to be closer before they molded together? He wasn’t sure but he was willing to try if it meant John would be a part of him forever. “It’s not your fault,”
, Sherlock loved this man. The room was deadly silent except for the pager that John pulled out of his scrubs pocket, silencing the beeping.  He took Sherlock’s hand, tugged him out of his chair, and led him through the interior doors into the corridors of the A&E. Sherlock couldn’t help replaying John’s little speech on a loop in his mind palace. He would have expected John to immediately latch onto the gay slur that the woman had used. He should have leapt at the chance to chant his mantra of ‘not gay!’ at anyone in the room that would listen. Instead, John had leapt down the woman’s throat at her implied insult that John was not a good doctor, and her hatred of homosexuals in general, and a sense of pride surged through Sherlock’s chest. John was the best doctor he knew and that woman deserved what she’d gotten.
“Close your eyes,” He ordered and Sherlock complied, even though he knew that he didn’t want to open his eyes to whatever it was. Something warm and fuzzy was placed in his hands and he frowned, opening his eyes to find a small red setter puppy in his lap. He stroked its head, staring at it in disbelief, and his hand bumped against a small box behind the puppy’s head. He frowned and gently turned it around to find a small jewelry box attached to the puppy’s collar. He stared at it and then looked at John whose face was unbearably soft.
The information sat in its chair in their living room as John read the newspaper that morning. He had come home later than usual last night, Chinese takeaway in hand as if it wasn’t an hour later than usual for his regular shift at the surgery. (And it was a regular shift at the surgery, Sherlock had checked on the calendar that John had synced on both their phones so that Sherlock would always know where he was if John was not with him. Sherlock never entered his own appointments into the calendar. That was simply too much effort when he already had them stored in his head.) John had also come back unusually docile and pleased - often the way he behaved after sex due to the release of pleasurable endorphins due to mutual engagement in the act of pleasuring another and being pleasured in return. This was not the first night that it had happened, nor did he think it would be the last and as a result Sherlock couldn’t sleep. The conclusion was that on his way home from the surgery and before getting Chinese takeaway John was having some sort of affair. Sherlock had yet to conclude where or with whom John was engaging in coitus with, but he also wasn’t sure he wanted to know. Not when whoever it was was making John just as happy, if not happier than Sherlock could make John.
take him somewhere else next time. We don’t want your homophobia in our hospital. Come on, Sherlock. There’s a more comfortable chair in my office you can have, I’ve got another surgery.”
“You don’t need to be sorry for feeling too deeply. I’m your partner, I’m supposed to care for your emotional health as much as your physical health and I quite enjoy doing both. You don’t need to apologize for this,” Sherlock leaned forward for a long, gentle kiss.
“Don’t cry, love. John will be off work soon, and Rosie’s going to be fine. Only a bit longer you have to wait now. What are you doing to pass the time?”
Right. With that settled he got out of bed, and pulled his light blue dressing gown around his pajamas, rumpled from tossing and turning alone in bed. Better to do this now, get it over with like ripping a bandaid. He would flounce into the living room and demand to know what John was doing and with who and ask him to leave for good if he didn’t think that Sherlock was enough. He could do it. Off the end of the bed where he sat, to the door, wait, breathe, open the door and step into the living room.
“I’ll be fine. You know the hospital makes us talk to a therapist every so often. I just want you close for awhile. I’ll be alright.” John let Sherlock undress him as he spoke. There was nothing sexual about it as he guided John into pajama bottoms and into bed before Sherlock changed into a pair of his own pajama bottoms and got into the other side of the bed.  John wrapped his body around Sherlock’s, chin against his chest and Sherlock’s arms came around to hold John as close to him as he could. After a few moments of silence, John began to talk quietly.
Down the halls, through the doors, up stairs, ignoring the elevators - tiny moving claustrophobic traps, never use them-, up more stairs, into the hall, check the signs, up more stairs, and enter the loud, echoey cafeteria. He wanted to turn around and leave the moment he’d entered. He wanted to find a hole and bury himself in it. Return to Baker Street, go to bed, and pull the blankets over his head the way he used to when he was small and trying to block out everything that was too much. The smells of food assaulted his nose and his transport almost protested - his stomach lurched and coiled into an even tighter knot at the thought of food- and he suppressed a gag. In and out he reminded himself. He was here for John, he could do this.
the person you were in love with? Sherlock had no idea. More data needed?). He squeezed John’s hand, unsure of what else to do to communicate anything that he was feeling and John squeezed back in acknowledgement. He let go then, despite Sherlock’s quiet sound of protest, and took the paperwork up to the receptionist. He had a quiet conversation with her for a moment before returning to his seat beside Sherlock. Their hands found their way back to each other and Sherlock wasn’t sure who had initiated it first this time, or if they had both done it at the same time.
"I think they tried to kill Mark too," Ben says to Martin when he finds him on set. He's watching the director argue with the set-designer about wallpaper.
JOHN: OKAY.
Sherlock contemplates it. “That would make your father even more cross, wouldn’t it?” he asks thoughtfully, tracing causation, as he’s good at doing.
“ He is. It’s certainly not a bad way to go, wondering if it were a flavor whether Sherlock's voice would be red velvet or dark chocolate.
, as aforementioned on this day, twenty years ago, I am not her father, nor am I your spouse.”
“Or doesn’t,” Mary says. “I can make my own toast.”
As the match progresses it becomes readily apparent she’s an average player with no cards or tricks up her sleeves, any subversive, underhanded tactics conspicuously lacking from her repertoire. If anything, her limited amount of strategic knowledge would be disappointing if he didn't stand to gain from it.
The pain steps up a notch, testing his threshold, but John can’t afford to stop, he knows that. Perhaps he underestimated the amount damage to his shoulder, must've been on a painkiller regiment beforehand that's starting to wear thin. In any case, he doesn’t have a choice, he has to work with it and get to that infernal death-trap island if he wants to live.
John acts quickly, incapacitating Sherlock first so that he doesn't get in the way. He sweeps a foot under Sherlock's long legs and knocks him back. In quick succession, he turns on the enemy. He proceeds to wrestle the perp to the floor in a series of deft, powerful moves he learned in basic training and within 30 seconds the poor sod is out of commission on the floor, pleading surrender.
John's hand tightens on his sleeve. "It's not like that at all-" he says vexedly, even a bit angry.
He opens the door, as he has on any number of occasions, not expecting it to threaten to wipe the nose clean off his handsome face as it slams shut in front of him, the resulting BAM! of wood against wood resounding like a gunshot throughout the flat. He blinks at John's hand, which has appeared over his shoulder and materialized onto the wooded surface.
“Yep. Now come here, darling—“ he extends an arm in her general direction, “I need your opinion on this blood spatter pattern.”
"There's no need," Sherlock says dismissively, impatience ushering him to press forward. He honestly doesn't care; John can watch so long as she tells him what he wants to know.
“For the body,” Sherlock says but Greg doesn’t seem to be following, “From yesterday.”
He immediately stops the train of thought in its tracks when he discovers what he’s thinking about and grows annoyed with himself, realizing he’s become enchanted by the ridiculous notion Mary’s planted in his head.
John irritably acquires milk, bread and eggs from the fridge and scrambles them together to make French toast. Sherlock watches him in playful amusement, leaning in threshold with his arms crossed, with an unspeakably self-satisfied smile. John whole-heartily ignores him. It’s not until he’s engulfed by a set of long, languid arms from behind that he is fully alert to what his flatmate is doing. He freezes.
“Well we could jump on him,” she suggests, clearly in favor of the idea.
and yet, somehow calling Sherlock his friend doesn’t demote him, rather it dignifies that word,
There had been an exchange of words before the final sound of the gun. He had heard what would be the final words of their would-be murder suspect, now lying in a body bag at the morgue. But even when he manages to piece it together, the words were barely recognizable, distorted in the depths of the pool where sound traveled slow and in strange, garbled variations.
Sherlock looks frustrated. “John.. Don’t you feel me? I’m real,” his fingers harden on his wrist uncontrollably, like he's at the end of his rope.
"You should hear yourself-"
"Careful what you wish for, Mr. Holmes." She laughs at how his face betrays his uncertainty and again he's at a loss as to what she finds so amusing.
“What do you mean?” John asks obliviously. "I thought.. that's what you were supposed to be teaching me,” he figures, wearing his T-shirt “I’m confused” look, which Sherlock is doubtless familiar with, and judging by the way he’s leering, likely finds it so transparent it’s amusing, or maybe even endearing.
SHERLOCK: OH PLEASE. I DO NOT HAVE "PROBLEMS" WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. JOHN, TELL IT IT'S BEING RIDICULOUS.
“—People almost always lie if not intentionally then by confabulation—”
“You act like you’re above all this, but you’re really not,” she retorts in a don’t fly too close to the sun tone.
"Here's an idea. Why don't you go do your job, and I'll do mine?" John smiles with the patience of a saint, giving Anderson his blessing to get on with his forensic analysis or whatever he supposedly does and leave them be.
“Am I dead?” he asks with a soft, wry smile, looking fondly at Sherlock. He's flat against the rooftop, and the side of his head is soar. He must've fallen. Hopefully not the wrong way?
“It was those kinds of questions that put me here.”
She sighs and tries to be patient with his childish antics. “Please?” she asks.
He leans his forehead against the cupboard beneath the sink and heaves a sigh.
Sherlock's husband after all, even if their marriage was something of a bet gone wrong at best, or a competition of who was the most stubborn at worst.
JOHN: I AM NOT ANTISOCIAL. I JUST DON’T SEE THE POINT OF THIS CONVERSATION.
20. WHEN YOU SAY YOU’RE SORRY, DO YOU USUALLY MEAN IT?
Sherlock: Amongst other things.
“Oh hello Nigel,” John says.
1. DO YOU HAVE "EXCESS GLIBNESS" OR SUPERFICIAL CHARM?
“Mary, what are you doing here?” John asks, confuzzled. Mary puts her index finger against her lips, swearing him to secrecy. On a secret mission, it seems.
As they travel back in a taxi, John stares daggers at Sherlock, who is sullenly watching the traffic pass by, his prey out there rejoicing in its freedom while he sulks in the back of a cab.
Mary: Oh.
John follows the sound of the violin through the long glass halls with only the occasional skylight or window to guide him in the low light, spilling sliver reflections onto the bulletproof glass of the hallways. The music leads him to the elevator, which isn't working either. He finds the stairwell to the subterranean level, dissonant, minor notes resonating from two stories below. He muses how the eerie, ominous quality of it would make a good introduction to a horror film. He can practically hear the audience bidding him not to go down there.
“Sometimes it blows my mind how you even got to this point.”
“Oh well, since you said please, since I’d do anything you ask and,” John cants his head aside playfully, sarcastically entertaining the idea of helping Sherlock kill himself, “You're asking for it,” He says that in such a bestially vengeful way, with such conviction, such darkness and condemnation, emphasizing the full extent of the double meaning: slut-shaming Sherlock for all the insidiousness he pulled before, licking his fork too much, baring his skin like a weapon.
"Oh?" she asks, intrigued. "Not when all of this is to prevent John from knowing about your unseemly bed habits...?" She traces a circle into the notch of his clavicle and his throat tightens. Why does it feel like no matter what he tries she manages to slip through his fingers and find some new angle twist his arm? He wonders how every which way he ventures she seems to have a trap laid in wait for him, but then remembers leverage is her business. He bites down on his lip and clenches his fist around his gloves, irked.
“I don’t see what that has to do with—“
That plan is shot when the shoulder starts throwing a fit, screaming indignantly that it is indeed, a fracture; a deafeningly-loud, vision-blurring, and just insufferable injury that refuses to compromise. He falters with a startled gasp, his hand clenching on his upper arm and imprinting his fingers into his bicep.
SHERLOCK: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS EXCESS GLIBNESS OR CHARM.
“No thanks.”
Ignored.
"You realize what this means? They are
“What about them?” she retorts uninterestedly.
His laughter feels like a breath of fresh air. John meets and returns his gaze, somehow unaffected by the complete lack of personal space, entranced by the sonorous hills and valleys of his voice. Sherlock's hair falls against the side of John's nose when their foreheads touch. He smells like laundered linen and that high-end shampoo of his laced with vetiver against the clean, crisp scent of his starchy, steam-pressed shirt.
John disinfects the wounds and bandages them. He’s wallowing in misery and berating himself for being an idiot for the entire duration of it. Horrible, deep-seated guilt overwhelms him at the thought Sherlock didn’t want to be seen by him in that state so badly- that he couldn't even let him know what was happening. If John hadn’t allowed him to feel that way this whole thing could have been prevented, the now-irreversible damage done, averted.
The reality was that he was at John's disposal. He was injured, probably starving (because of this case he hadn't eaten in... days? weeks?), and in general couldn't even overpower John on a good day. No matter how violently his mind opposed John, his body physically could not, which meant that John was at liberty to do whatever he wanted, and Sherlock was helpless to stop him.
"Well, clearly it's not nothing. I have a hard time believing we lost our suspect all on account of
“The tall one? Sherlock, that is
“I’m bleeding,” Sherlock notes without turning around.
"Of course you're not. But you're still human," John reasons, not understanding why he's saying nonsensical things. John glances down to see he's clenching his hand at his side.
After seeing that the contact is only making it worse, Sherlock retracts, locking his elbows, and looks down at his friend helplessly, his ebony fringe obscuring his grief-stricken gaze. Then Sherlock realizes the problem. The hazarded guesses, the kisses, the embraces weren't harmless; while a cursory and marginal show of innocent affection, they carried an ulterior significance, reminded him how unmarried he really is.
Sherlock looks genuinely taken aback by the suggestion. "God forbid."
“Shall I demonstrate?” Sherlock offers, eliminating the last shred of buffer space between them by leaning down with the look of John’s greatest weakness—soft, captivating eyes so distracting it takes John the whole of a minute to be pulled out of their depths and realise that… he’s loosing altitude.
" he informs him.
"What good will reporting it do?" Sherlock retorts, "She has leverage over everyone at Scotland Yard."
, rather. In light of its unpredictably terrifying nature, John feels a more befitting title would be sea monster.
Despite the obvious illogic of the two mutually exclusive conditions Sherlock has presented, his statement seems to make marvelous sense to Mary. It irritates John because ever since that day he told Mary they were married, Sherlock seems to get off on telling Mary all kinds of wack things, and she believes him because Sherlock is allegedly ‘always right’.
He doesn’t sleep that night. There is something of an uneasiness on his mind following the events that had transpired at the pool. He has this irksome feeling he’s forgotten something important— something difficult to retrieve, brief, elusive, tugging at the edges of his recall. It's something he heard in the liminal space between wakefulness and unconsciousness.
“You made her fall in love with you so that you could use a limited-access elevator.”
He steps out tavern's backdoor, where only business of a seedy, clandestine nature need take place, and he catches sight of the caped man's ominous silhouette receding down the alleyway. Upon breaching his lips, the unearthly chill in the air burns in his lungs, making his skin tingle and hair stand on end.
Having lost his patience, Sherlock whirls around so fast it nearly gives John whiplash. "Because at the end of the day
“What’s the matter?” she asks and John snaps out of it.
“You are… the most infuriating person on earth,” John whispers reproachfully, stalling Sherlock about a breath away.
“Boysenberry.”
"How?" he asks, his mind frustratingly sluggish. They'd shared the same bottle and he knows she didn't tamper with his glass. Even if she had, he hadn't actually drank anything since she'd arrived-
The sound of his life ending,
"Bit of an odd couple, your brother's," Clara says, looking after them, "Is he out yet?"
Sherlock!" he says. He'd shake him by the shoulders if he thought it would help any. "God, you should hear yourself. You've got everything completely backwards. You're the one that's twisting everything-" he'd really love to twist him in his hands right now.
“Because you can’t let the baby play with a— a gun is not a
“You wore a dress,” Nigel remarks upon Mary and Sherlock’s entrance, befuddled. They take down the few entry steps and arrive beside him, amoungst the various, formal-attire attendees.
And how was he supposed to close this case without seeing her, exactly?
“No man’s land, darling. He’s a goner. I can feel his delta waves from here,” Sherlock explains waving his hand, trying to brush them off before they interfere with his brainwaves. He files through the stack of letters at a pace approaching that of the speed of light, clearly loosing patience.
John stares at the opening vortex with dark, bottomless eyes, panting anxiously. “What do you want?” John deplores raggedly.
"Sherlock- please," he begs, as Sherlock tries to ward off his attempts to hold him down. Sherlock manages to break free and John really wishes he hadn't, because now John has to lunge after him like the crazy, abusive, axe-murderer husband that he's desperately trying to mentally distance himself from right now.
Yeah, that would go over well. He might as well be speaking an language lost to history with no Rosetta stone. He wonders whether it would even be enough to stop him anyway. Talk about the bloody definition of wishful thinking, Watson.
Sorry this ended without much closure, I will add in the rest tomorrow. Also, forgive my mistakes because I haven't ironed them all out yet :p
John sips a half-glass of gold wine, and decides on a bored whim to seek out their voices. He stalks off toward the hall, taking full-length, militaristic strides. He turns a corner and proceeds down a corridor parallel to the length of the ballroom. As he proceeds, the voices grow louder, occasionally waving in and out as though they are in sinusoidal motion.
“You think I am no longer capable of seeing this though, is that it?" he demands with vulnerable undertones of despair mixed with rage, "For once, I've finally met my match. I've been defeated. I've
"And I, man or woman, will never stop protecting you.
but everything else carrying on like normal,
"Why are you so intent on seeing Mycroft?" Sherlock retorts, forcefully civil and dangerously close to being not.
Perhaps he should have anticipated, or even expected that sort of reaction from her. But it still left him standing there in the hall for quite some time, stunned. Yet somehow the sensation of that hit against his face was kinder than the wounds he was carrying internally, a brief respite from the howls of his own grief, the abject emptiness that followed, and the brutal way the world just continued on.
"You're bleeding," she says.
Unable to detect the hollowness of his words, Sherlock appears satisfied with that. "Is it alright if I borrow your tie?" he asks, holding the silk band in hand. John glowers pointedly at the thing in disapproval- it's very showy, garnished with a sun-shaped pendant- a medal for valor.
"Don't give me that look," Sherlock says in reprimand, though his eyes are trained on the keys as his fingers dance along them, not on John.
Then Sherlock becomes hesitant, reluctant even. “In truth, I think it makes him miss you,” he risks saying.
Mary disregards John’s claims about her imaginary mother, and instead cuts to a more pressing issue. “What about his alibi though?” Mary asks Sherlock.
“It wouldn’t work,” he says, turning his back, but she runs around him again.
John leans back into his chair, turning away in a huff and resting his head on his hand in a grand gesture of “whatever.”
"Does this look like an accident to you?” John jabs his thumb in the direction they came, “It's all been carefully tactfully staged. Its practically cinematic," John says bitterly. Since there’s no point in trying to get back in, he turns and starts down the pavement.
He had to get her to make a mistake. He'd narrowed in on the perpetrator, now it was just a question of catching her. And there was only one kind of trap for this particular brand of criminal- he was looking at it in the mirror.
"Sherlock wait-" he starts from the top of the stairs. Sherlock pauses in the doorframe and looks up.
He flinches when her thumb ghosts against his lips, pressed together in a hard line in an endeavor to keep his face neutral and expression muted, in spite of the misery with which he fails. Her heart flutters at the mixed expression, the softness of his shame so palpable, so ripe she could practically sink her teeth into it.
It hadn't occurred to him the envy that might inspire. She hated him for it. He was everything she was not glaring her in the face. All the bars she could not meet.
Anderson twitches with annoyance. Satisfied with the ensuing, cricket-laden silence, Sherlock journeys over the the body to conduct his investigation.
“You’re ten years old,” John says, a little baffled, “I don’t even think you’re supposed to know what that is.”
John bites down on his lip hard, looking at his tea pensively. “Because I don’t know." he says, finally. "Right now, all I have is my imagination. I have no way of knowing if it was as bad what's in my head or if..." John hesitates, "if it was worse."
Rose gnaws her lip. "From what the surgeon said, there’s a good chance he's going to die."
For god's sake, she did not have to put it like that, he thinks, glaring at her as she walks off. She might as well have added on the 'too soon?' most people tag on after telling a joke.
“No,” he replies, chin withdrawn. Decidedly not. Sherlock is practically beaming, never a good sign. John’s stomach flips watching the ungodly smirk play on his mouth. John would be a certain kind of idiot not to realize he’s in danger right now, but the problem is he’s a worse kind of idiot, the kind that
before you speak,” he sighs exasperatedly, waving him off.
“Yes.”
“Because I’m your best friend.”
"Then what on earth do we need him for?" Sherlock challenges. The question is softer now, but somehow even more resolute. John is about to open his mouth, but then there's a faint trace of a smirk on the corner of Sherlock's mouth that makes John's stomach flip. It occurs to him that the question was a rhetorical. While his smile is subtle, it's also breathtakingly daring and cocky and John doesn't trust himself to respond to it without botching up the words like an idiot.
"Have you thought about a career at NSY?" Lestrade asks, clearly enamored.
After confirming he is indeed alive, unlike the rest of the fallen bodies near the reserve trenches, the enemy troop takes him roughly by the arm, eliciting a yell of pain, and brings him to an english-fluent corporal to extract what information they can out of him. The corporal asks him a series of questions, which he gets flogged for not answering. When it becomes apparent to them that he won't comply, they throw him to the ground and start tormenting him. One particularly vengeful bayonet-wielder presses a boot into his broken shoulder.
John almost takes a moment to face-palm, but thinks better of it. “You blow my mind, Sherlock- Really, I don’t know what you want me to say, other than nothing you're saying is making sense or even the slightest bit true and that there’s nothing remarkable about my hand!” he maintains desperately.
“And you’re prone to that, are you? Confabulation,” John scoffs, amazed that a man of science can be this dually talented at bullshitting, “How about lying by omission?”
"She wasn't trying to kill him- that was just a side effect. What she wanted was to make him suffer."
"Happy Christmas," she chimes with a wink, addressing Sherlock. It's by far nothing like Christmas unless you're in Australia, but it's become common knowledge Sherlock tends to associate dead bodies with presents and Christmas and frolicking elves. What's odd is the way she says it, like she personally wrapped this gift for him.
Sherlock hates how he moves like putty in his hands, how John's strength still strains the shoulder socket from the joint even though John is handling him with kid gloves. John can feel his resentment at being manhandled and the added insult to injury of being humiliated, his frame shaking and burning against John with anger.
I'm sorry I had to drop that bomb about them being married on you like that but it had to be done, since we like skipped the first few chaps. Also sorry that I did not get to the part where they meet Irene again yet... gah, I wanted to go there. Next time, folks, next time.
"I thought he ditched us to go make Dr. Who,” Martin muses.
.” He turns, chin tucking in, to look at her directly.
“Do what you’re good at and go nurse your codependency issues elsewhere. Or better yet, do the world a favor and go lock yourself in a closet,” he says acerbically.
“Sherlock,” John quips, looking like he could just about snap the brunet in two, “do you honestly think you could be a father?”
Is it play, is it pretense?
I don't even think it's that they're men. I think it's just a case of stupid + stupid makes for too much stupid in the room.
, in fact, already done so—“ he elaborates, then realizes how stupid unnecessary the explanation is, “Dammit what does any of that have to do with—“ he gnashes his teeth, swallowing his anger, then resumes composedly, “I literally cannot fathom what possible relevance
you exist?” Sherlock points the tip of the bow at her, like the thought had never occurred to him.
And it was infuriating.
That's absurd. John has done far too many idiotic things to not have irrevocably proven that was never going to happen (marrying him, for one... although that was something of a mishap...). "As a- as a friend, I mean," he adds awkwardly, "Obviously."
In the midst of his ascent, he inevitably slips on the moist surface, teetering on the brink of falling back to the depths. But he responds well under pressure and gunpoint and things of that nature, so he manages to catch himself. He resumes scaling and soon makes it to the horizontal platform of the apex. He throws himself against one of the walls of its naturally-eroded canals, trying to regulate his panting and rationalize the receding panic.
"I thought it should be obvious by now that he loved you more than he loved life," she says in bored monotone.
His mouth feels dry by the time he returns to the beacon, but he ploughs past his canteen in interest of finding tinder downwind. He sees that the desert-scape gives way to eucalyptus and olive trees, not more than a quarter mile out across a shallow inlet. As he walks toward the waterline, he suddenly goes still.
“Wait what…?” Nigel trails, taken aback.
Sherlock looks taken off-guard. “John says you can’t cook or you’ll burn yourself,” he talks to her as Mary retrieves an egg carton from the fridge.
“It won’t work unless it’s true love,” she says insistently.
“There was a body that came in yesterday. It should be here—“ he says distractedly, searching the examination room for something he might have missed. He turns around like a dog chasing its tail, the mirror-like walls, cabinets, and tables scintillating and sterile, revealing nothing to him other than his own reflection.
The only problem with that is it’s all too convenient to be coincidence.
John nudges open the door and finds him there, nursing his wounds. He places the mugs on the nightstand and stands behind him in silence awkwardly, not certain of what he should do. He wants to wrap him in his arms from behind, somehow explain himself, make the pain he'd caused go away. He wants to feel his muscles relax, feel his hair brush against his nose again like in the briefest moment that morning when everything was alright.
“Actually, I was just thinking we should get a room."
His absurd obsession with her merely wrapping her hands around him is getting tedious. "Why are you so fixated on that? I don't see what's the problem-"
"No don't worry about it, John," Clara scoffs at him like he's being ridiculous.
Eurus procures a taxi all the way from the cemetary in Totenham to an ominous-looking, abandoned warehouse in Battersea. Its fortified iron walls are not a welcoming sight, and if she wanted to kill him he imagines this would be the ideal place to do it. Of course if she really wanted to kill him, he’d probably already be dead.
"Look, the lovers are back," Sally greets them cheerfully, looking up from her paperwork as they walk in.
"Isn't it-?"
“This is heaven.”
“As do you, Mrs. Davenport.” Thankfully well-versed in underhand verbal sparing between family members, Sherlock returns the compliment with a smile and head tilt toward Mary, deftly employing the familial vernacular for ‘the sentiment is mutual’.
"I don't know, yes?" John offers in confusion, feeling a little overwhelmed by his intensity. And just like that, his writer's block is lifted.
Residing on the far right of the attendants, Mrs. Davenport’s sharp, liquid steel eyes narrow dangerously on the priest, her arms stiffly crossed. The fingers of her right hand rap incessantly on the bend of her left elbow, drumming against the grey satin material of her garb, poised to a tempo. Her demeanour, pronounced by her chipped shoulders and tense frame, exudes such hostility even her husband feels uncomfortable seated next to her. Mrs. Davenport’s tongue is clipped, but her mind is raging to the sound of her pulse in her head, contemplating if there is
“You’re wishing I’d taught you now, aren’t you?”
John comes down from his room the next day to find the flat vacant, with exception of Sherlock's former best friend, the skull, innocently minding its own business by the hearth. Sherlock's case files and sheet music are scattered about, fluttering in the draft, but the detective himself is conspicuously missing. The unusual absence of any electrical fires, holes in the wall, chemical explosions or any other property damage that would be coming out of his pay cheque this month is a good thing, but suspicious. It's far too quiet for a morning in 221B, and if he didn't know any better, he'd say an anvil was about to drop through the ceiling or poison gas was going to start leeching out of the floor boards. Then he hears the piano mysteriously playing one floor below, which to his knowledge hasn't been played since Mr. Hudson met his demise in Florida.
“What?” Nigel asks.
-" "-and you're walking straight into certain death like a moth to a flame, saying you'll resent me for the rest of your life if I don't let you. You haven't any idea how unfair that is-" (Sherlock is rolling his eyes) "You won't talk to me, you won't even hear me, you're not even letting me keep you from getting yourself killed with all your uncompromising, unilateral decisions. You think I'm in the wrong and that I've no right to be doing this, when you've pushed me against a wall. What the hell else am I supposed to do?" "Not act so theatrical maybe-?" "This is not an
"What am I doing?" John asks snarkily, putting a hand on his hip, "I just saved your bloody life- you would be dust without me, or don't you get that?"
"We have to at least report it," John says, trying broach the subject with as much finesse as possible.
“I got bored.”
“I did not,” he says to her, attention scattered, still distracted by John and breaking in and out of eye contact with him. He still alluringly looks like hell, only now, he seems to have gotten even better at wearing it, subtler, darker, a chaotic mixture of emotion, pressed to a smooth under formal clothing.
Of course, he couldn't be sure whether the illusion of a date would be enough to draw her out. There was a distinct possibility she was already in the wind, on a flight to some unbeknownst continent with a shot of port in hand.
Benedict walks into the first read-through for the next season and is confronted by a bunch of new faces he’s never seen before, as well as Martin sitting in the back, twiddling his thumbs with his heels on the table.  The nearest person stands up and grins at him.
"You usually kill your victims promptly, typically within two to three hours," he says, trying not to sound impatient, “Why are you keeping me alive? What are you waiting for?” Is she toying with him? Either she's yanking his chain or she's actually enjoying this tedious game of cat-and-mouse- Well, she's laughing now, suggesting she's enjoying it quite a lot.
But then, inexplicably, he suddenly feels at a loss, short of breath and helplessly, powerlessly overwhelmed by him, even though Sherlock hasn’t so much as lifted a finger. It’s as if Sherlock’s word is somehow law, or worse even, fact, with the power to disarm him, take him apart like a kitchen appliance, take his piece apart and reassemble it with filled carrots for cartridges— god, if he did pick a fight, it wouldn’t be a fair one, would it?
“Holy mother of god. Is that what you thought?” Sherlock remarks in feigned disbelief, taking a draft of sparkling wine.
Sherlock narrows his eyes defiantly and remains mute.
He leans on the counter after retching up the non-existent contents of his stomach and glares at his reflection in the mirror, judging his transport for its rampant failings.
Sherlock’s eyes jump to the ground, where he has made a misstep severe enough to set himself temporarily off-balance. He realizes that he’s stumbled, as a result of not paying attention, and is teetering on the proverbial ledge, about to
A few narrow misses with snappy taxis and he finds himself back at saint barts.
“No, you don’t understand. I didn’t kill those people Mr. Holmes-” he calls after him as Sherlock turns away, presumably to return to his study. He stops, but still doesn’t turn around.
Anderson is visibly infatuated with the woman, which John finds annoying until he wonders why he too isn't infatuated. It's not as though she's not attractive by his standards- or really anyone's with eyes.
“Well, it wasn’t necessarily that she forgot,” Sherlock reluctantly admits, the implication being she intentionally left him in handcuffs, just to be cruel, or to demean or humiliate him or whatever it is dominatrixes do.
“I have a reputation to uphold,” Sherlock replies matter-of-factly, quietly composed and probably smug.
“My name is John. John Watson? Do you have any idea where—“ the man trespasses knee-deep into the water, and the chimera releases an hostile, threatened growl, clenching his canines, flaring his bioluminescent green irises at the intruder. John sees the silver tail whiplash beneath the surface and falls back on his haunches, chest heaving with rapid breath, his pupils dilated and his heels digging into the cemented sand. Fear. Good. It’s mutual.
What appears to be a hint of annoyance flickers in its eyes, darkening on its features and casting shadows on its face, deepening into a look of frustration. Its eyes become as ominous as they are enigmatic, malcontent with inexplicability- as if he were as unexplainable to
"I have no intention of letting her get away with anything," Sherlock overrides him, his response poised and measured.
SHERLOCK: DO YOU EVEN NEED TO ASK?
“Yeah.”
“Is that what I think or you think?”
“No?”
The chimera smirks to himself and settles on the floor with his newly-won trophy, a circle of dust unfurling around them. He cups the cadaver with a forearm beneath the shoulder blades and rests its back against the sand delicately, taking in its bland features. He absently trails his thumb under its blanched lip as he contemplates, thoroughly mesmerized, tail curving around and thumping against the sand contently.
Civilly.
“No,” Sherlock replies softly in rebuttal.
The chimera watches the woodcraft burn thoughtfully, eyebrows furrowing. It very prominently announces the human’s presence to the rest of the island, and is likely to attract land predators, if there are any within the confines of the island. He decides it is best to stand watch over the human for the night, when it elects to sleep, because one thing is readily apparent, John is much more entertaining alive than dead.
"Alright, if you've really been seduced by that psychopath and you want to be with her, so be it. I'll step aside, I won't get in the way, I'll even give you my blessing- I'll tear up the marriage certificate and be the best man at your wedding in hell. But on one condition, Sherlock," he backs up in step with Sherlock, so that no matter how many steps Sherlock takes forward he can't seem to get between John and the door.
“At what!” John looks down helplessly at his hand that the sleuth has brought to eye level, Sherlock glaring at him condemningly like the fact he’s a leftie is self-incriminating.
Nigel, deathly pale and uncomfortable, looks at John like his tongue’s been clipped out of him.
“Mary the reason I can say I’m human is only because of-“
“You mean that thing you’re constantly trying to destroy?" she asks with a grin.
He slots the memory drive into the USB port of his laptop. The drive is password protected, encrypted, and poised to self-destruct, multiple login attempts not enabled. Hovering his fingers above the keyboard, he eventually settles on
"He's homosexual, I'm guessing-?" the inspector hazards.
“Jealous?”
“Never. Never again. I promise.”
She coaxes Sherlock backward and awkwardly he relents, letting her have her way, letting her crowd him into a secluded corner and trap him against the wall, where she sequesters him all to herself and bites the upper curve of his ear. John watches all of this, too shocked to even fully process it.
“oh, you want me to tell him that I love him?” it occurs to Sherlock, fitting the pieces together, "John is an organ donor- you don't suppose he'll be there?"
"Still having trust issues I see," someone comments behind him.
It’s been a month since John had visited last, and Sherlock looks ridiculous, aching with want, bursting at the seams. He’s too horny to sit still, practically liquid in his chair, playing footsie to the point John wants to kick him. He gives John a steamy look, that John stares dead-on at for a full minute, before he pushes out his chair, tosses his plate in, stands to get himself seconds.
Nigels shakes his head vigorously, with every intention of taking it to the grave. John hums with a minimal, lackluster smile.
He finds his way back to the vast and largely empty warehouse unit at the end of the hall, hazy incandescent lights and whirling fans playing tricks on the liquid nitrogen vapors circling around on the floor. His chest knots up as he approaches the cot at the far end of the room and he has to turn away to give himself a moment.
“Some sort of informal slow dance, I think." Sherlock hazards. His mind, indeed, does seem to have fizzed out of ideas; the lagging tempo, the slurring steps, two bodies in motion, just free-wheeling, the patterns of their feet having devolved into idle weight-shifting, time standing still. The lethargy of it feels bizarre, killing time and gazing at each other, despite the fact they’ve barely any reason to, wearing tenuously thin, verging on no reason at all. Without proper dancing there’s little to no excuse not to stop, not to let go of him, their entire purpose for being together disintegrates.
“God no.”
"So long as that's allowed?" Sherlock enquires amusedly at John's off-beat reaction. It occurs to John he's letting on his reservations, his face dark and brooding.
"I can't."
9. DO YOU OFTEN ACT BEFORE YOU THINK OUT THE CONSEQUENCES?
“My place or yours?”
John falls silent, pondering over what Mycroft had relayed to him. It was one thing to discard what Eurus had said before when it was only something she had mentioned in passing, but if Mycroft was also convinced of this, and he knew Eurus better than John did, then it wasn't as easy to ignore. He leaves shortly afterward to get Rose ready for school, still turning it around in his head.
Sherlock: No I didn't.
, if I'm not mistaken."
"No it's not."
Mary tackles and rams the Nigel into the floor with such violence the sound of collision makes Sherlock wince. With no alternative mode of action available to him, Sherlock is ultimately reduced to standing idly behind the wire fence and forced to watch the proceedings helplessly, hands in his pockets, unbudging.
"Stand up," the man says, this time in English, addressing him. Not wanting to become likewise eviscerated, the soldier braces his invalidated arm and struggles to his feet. The nobleman turns and bids him to follow, but the soldier only makes it a few paces before his knees buckle from under him and he hits the ground. The man turns around, hearing him collapse, and looks him over, seeing that he's not in any condition to walk.
“See you like what?” Sherlock asks.
Rose rolls her eyes, and offers a ridiculous explanation instead, "Well, maybe he saved your life for selfish reasons."
10. DO YOU HAVE DELUSIONS OR OTHER SIGNS OF IRRATIONAL THINKING?
"You ran off just when it was getting fun. Playing hard to get?"
How is it that what he couldn't do in ten moves she could do in one?
The sole and final answer to his question is din of silence, interrupted only by a howl of wind. A few seconds slip by, then a minute. John's patience wears thin.
"You don't have a clue what you're talking about," John has decided, unequivocally. If Sherlock were any good at reading emotions, he would have noticed the glaring, neon danger sign on John's face, but he isn't, so he doesn't.
“Sorry, what was that?” he replies.
He turns on his heel and walks off, leaving the two of them to suffer the whiplash of his complete 360. He'd so quickly cut them off with an eerie, forced civility, it gives Anderson the hibbie jeebies thinking about it. Sherlock rarely gave up that easily- it was like he'd just flipped the emotional off switch in his robotic brain and walked off- it was just
"You have more power over me in your little finger than she has in her entire arsenal of torture tactics," he says, answering the confusion in his eyes. "She could never destroy me, John, but you
designated by the donation of genetic material to the physiological constitution of his child or chil
“See, if you didn’t, I don’t think you would be falling right… now.”
"Sherlock, will you for once just
“Well I could say the same for you,” Sherlock replies boredly. He hates to be anticlimactic but it’s unspeakably selfish, sleeping after a twenty-four hour shift. The entire morning has been insufferable as a result.
As she's leaving she takes the rose with her. She plucks the petals out one by one and John has to wonder why it fixates him so much-- as if some sort of glitch in his brain won't let him take his eyes away. Every time she tears a piece off it feels like she's twisting a corkscrew into his side further, until it's just a pile of discarded, torn petals on the floor.
“What..?” Mary breaks the silence, because clearly she’s missed something.
"I'm aware of her connections," John says, casting a downward glace at his dour reflection on the glass-topped table, "That's why I'm here."
He sets the mug down next to him on the counter that has become more of a laboratory chemical bench than an eating area. "It's freezing in here," John breathes, "You realise we have a thermostat?" Normally he touches Sherlock's shoulder from behind when he passes him tea, but this time he hesitates. He takes the seat across from him instead. Sherlock doesn't once break the motionless pantomime act.
He feels flustered at being so easily read; it dissipates as heat off his skin. She can feel him burning under his jacket and he feels the sliminess of her grip on him, both literal and otherwise. Revulsion congeals in the pit of his stomach.
“Don’t you trust me John?” Sherlock’s calm voice reverberates against his ear, and John finds it nothing short of blissful how it mellows him, gliding smooth, gleaming golden like running honey. John looks up to find Sherlock's calm gaze on him and feels a tumbling landslide of relief, the demonic paradoxical wiles of his brain— rabbit-traps and rabbit-holes— done away with, long forgotten. Sherlock is mercifully there— smiling and composed and perfect— his embrace holding him up, holding him together so he can walk and run and dance with him, as if he weren’t a physiological mess fraying at the seams.
The alarm begins to sound and the man looks away, seeing the overhead lights go out and the emergency uplighters around the perimeter of the pool beam on.
"John!" Sherlock snaps, growing impatient.
"It's not a man," Sherlock tells their confused faces, decidedly less verbose than usual. Right about now is typically when he'd be showing off.
His mind is racing, grasping a straws, “What was.. what was that thing you said about friends and bridges and the the jumping off?”
Sherlock: What does it look like John? We're tracking water consumption in our sprinklers.
“You let me know that,” she returns, eyes narrower and curious, not quite following the logic.
John's blood throbs in his ears. The way this man, in all his brilliance and ingenuity, can so completely circumvent the point is astounding. The moment the taxi pulls up, Sherlock mounts the kerb, flinging an excess of bank notes at the driver.
The ground starts spinning under his feet, and his legs buckle. He puts his hands over his eyes, tries to subdue the ringing in his head.
“I would… wake up at night, hearing violin music… was it insanity… how I haunted your grave, searching for something that wasn’t there, asking for miracles when there was no one to answer? Was it insanity to cling to the vain, irrational hope— that you would— you would hear me—“ His voice sounds like a tape recorder, a bit glitchy at the end.
She stands and follows him as he fumbles backward in a series of ungraceful steps, backing him into the wall. He doesn't understand why he's reacting like this.
“And what was this for?” John retorts with brusque inertia, the words quietly forming an accusative, raging
"What are you doing with Mycroft?" Sherlock retorts, his outrage catching John off guard. Sherlock rarely lets his emotions out of the doghouse, but John's really being too much, driving him up the wall with his fair-weather loyalty and his constantly-changing taste in Holmes brothers based on who's most convenient. He seizes the opportunity to fly past John while he's taken aback by the outburst.
“You wound me Mary. I’m painstakingly serious. What would you have me do? Recite poetry?“
The first few seconds in front of the big bed were awkward. After some hesitation, they decided, to share the master bedroom, despite the availability of another bedroom. In case of an intruder, it seemed safer to stick together, and neither John nor Sherlock were ready, to separate for the night. The bed was huge enough, anyway. They had shared smaller accommodations during cases. They settled in the bed and turned off the light. Despite all the time together in the last 24 hours, there was still a lot to talk about till late into the night.
(See the end of the chapter for
After the fourth ring, which seemed like an eternity, the call was taken. “Donovan here,” Sally's voice greeted him. She seemed out of breath.
“I don’t know. But I will investigate,” he promised. With that he waved goodbye to Matt and Mrs. Hudson and returned to his bolt hole. Now he was free to fight along Lestrade against Moriaty. And perhaps find an answer to the now niggling question: Could Sherlock still be alive?
Sherlock turned his gaze toward John. “Tell me,” Sherlock demanded holding the paper up.
“Threesomes?”
John’s heart sped up. ‘They slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered’, he once read. He tensed again. Why did this feel so normal? Did best friends cuddle? Why was this okay, even though he had never thought of doing something like that with his army mates?
This time Sherlock took a big sip of the wine. “Just to get this straight, despite what my dear brother implies: I had and have sex. I am no virgin, whatever that means for a gay man.” Sherlock cast a shy glance toward John.
“I don’t really know. I had a sniper following me till some days ago. He was found murdered in an alley. I was bugged. Mycroft assumed, that you and Mrs. Hudson are, too. My divorce provided me with a complete cut to my routines and clothes. Probably there is still some surveillance on my ex, but that is no longer important. And we got rid of your bugs and surveillance as long as you don’t return to Baker Street. But snipers could still be waiting out there for you and Mrs. Hudson. We have to get you off the grid, get confirmation if you are still shadowed and get you and Mrs. Hudson to safety. The thing is: You have to do that on your own. I am trying to support Mycroft with other operations. I can provide you with a gun, a secure mobile, some cash and a bolt hole. You need to find the people who are out to get you and Mrs. Hudson. When you have dealt with them and want to help, report back to me. We can go from there. Are you game?”
John knew that Sherlock was thinking hard, trying to figure something out. “What are you thinking about?” John asked, disturbing his thoughts.
The fight against Moriarty starts...
He felt Sherlock hugging him back. John’s senses confirmed this without any doubt: Sherlock was alive. He felt the ribcage pressed to his expanding with every inhalation, and the warm air of every exhalation on his neck. Warmth seeped through his clothes. The hair tickled his cheeks. This was real. He buried his face into the nape of Sherlock's neck.
“A flooding chamber of the Thames Embankments,” Greg said, interrupting his survey. “I once had some counter terrorism training in here, but I don’t know –,” the opening of the hatch above them interrupted him.
They dropped the car in the darkness of the night on a public parking lot and walked 30 minutes to the safe house. A key code granted them access to the small building. John did a quick check, gun at the ready as he scanned through the rooms. There was a kitchen, a living room and a small bathroom downstairs, and a big bathroom with a master bedroom and another smaller bedroom upstairs.
‘It was brilliant, and I could do it again,” Sherlock boasted. “You would make the same mistake again and you would overlook the most important details. Therefore, I would survive the jump -,“ Sherlock paused for effect and lead toward him, “- again.”
Molly arrived at Baker Street after her shift at St. Bart’s. She had collected so much overtime that she decided to splurge some of it to visit John and Sherlock. They had called her yesterday and told her about their homecoming. She was relieved that everything had worked out: Sherlock was back and Moriarty’s web was destroyed. The game was over.
John stared at him. After some seconds, his face softened and he nodded. John strongly suspected Sherlock was still alive. But he hadn't the heart or the proof to tell Mycroft so. What was worse, than giving the man hope, just to be proven wrong? If Sherlock was still alive, then he would forgive Mycroft anyway. If not, Mycroft still had to bear the guilt of betraying his brother. His hatred on top was unnecessary.
Sherlock stared at it. “Now I understand why my captor was so familiar,” he mumbled. His senses must have been heavily clouded by fatigue then. Now he was able to make the connection between the sniper and his tormentor at once. “What happened?”
“The thing is,” John continued, “I love being in Baker Street, solving cases, chasing killers and hanging out with you. I will not risk that again. But I also want some intimacy. Celibacy is not for me. Believe me, I tried. I just get grumpy.”
The big bad appears....
After a few moments, she took her handbag and retrieved the taser. Despite her misgivings it had been a constant companion these last few days and now she was happy to have carried it around all the time. It could be useful now. The wise choice would be, to wait for the police, but she knew, that Moriarty was dangerous and every minute was important.
John tried to help as much as he could. But he was in no official capacity so he was left with minor work in the background. He was a sounding board for Greg regarding the strategic planning. And he helped to set up a safe-zone at some of the NSY meeting rooms. He de-bugged them and took care that they were without surveillance. It was tedious, but better than just waiting. The days just blurred into each other.
One month later on a lovely spring day, Sherlock realized that they had only used John’s bedroom upstairs as storage space for clothing. The master bedroom, formerly Sherlock’s room, was now their room. The lazy Sunday afternoon was ideal to shuffle wardrobes and clothes and to move John's stuff to the master bedroom.
From then on, they enjoyed their evenings in a similar style. They were content with what they had and enjoyed what they could give each other with their hands and mouths. John felt the shyness and shame of being attracted to Sherlock vanishing as he gained confidence in his feelings. He was thankful for the security of the safe house and the time they were given to explore what they had found. There was no need to hurry or to hide anymore. They were moving in the same direction. The speed didn’t matter.
They arrived at a meeting room. There was a bag and a metal box with a lid on the table. John realized how Greg checked the empty corridor before closing the door. He shoved John into a chair. The folder was thrust at him and Greg mentioned for John to open it.
Upon entering, he steered Sherlock to sit on the bed and stepped between his legs. He cradled Sherlock’s face between his palms, bending down to plant a short kiss on his lips.
He pulled a device from the shelf, turned it on and roamed the end of a stick over John. After being turned around and his back being searched the same way, Greg grunted satisfied.
After 10 minutes the church was quiet. There was still light in the registry, but probably the priest was just organizing some things. Mrs. Hudson silently went to the confessional boxes, peeked inside and saw a bag. She slid in, closed the wooden door and did as instructed. The darkness wasn’t really helping, but she found everything she needed.  The clothes were not her style: striped trousers, a linen blouse, a thick woollen cardigan, a scarf and sensible leather shoes. Everything was in muted grey and brow colours. But in matters like these she couldn’t be fussy. She had some crazier adventures with her ex-husband Frank.
People stared at him. The whole speech was somewhat unprompted, but the last days had been not business as usual anyway. After some seconds, they started to whisper to each other and returned to their work.
Greg nodded. „Perfect.”
Sherlock sagged into his bonds. He lost. He thought, he was clever, but now it was over. He was a complete failure; Moriarty still alive, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson and John soon to be dead. All for nothing; he failed them. He failed John. He struggled one last time in vain against his bonds. Tears that had refused to fall earlier started to silently stream down his cheeks.
“No, no, no. You wouldn’t.” Moriarty was breathing faster, his eyes jumping around the ledge, looking for hidden devices, anything that could help him to see how Sherlock had survived the fall. The gun trembled in his hands due to suppressed fury. “Tell me! What did I miss?” he yelled. His hands made a wide gesture toward the ledge. The gun was no longer aiming at Sherlock.
Anderson just stared at him. After some seconds, he huffed and strode back to his desk.
Sherlock looked up at him and took a deep breath. He nodded. Molly could see the exhaustion on Sherlock’s face. His whole body was trembling. She grabbed his arm and pulled him up. “Come on Sherlock. Let's visit John and Greg.” She smiled and accompanied him to the stairs, arms slung around his waist for support. Sherlock leaned on her to steady his gait.
After Anne left - no sleep-overs, no good-bye kisses by the door per mutual agreement - John grabbed some change of clothes and wandered down to the bathroom, unconcerned about his nudity. Spotting the bag with take away, still lukewarm, he knew instantly that Sherlock was back. Somehow he felt guilty, like having an illicit affair. He shook his head – first things first: shower and getting dressed. He snuck into the bathroom and started the shower.
“That explains something else,” Mycroft said. “The Czech forensic team found DNA and blood traces of you in the cell. I told them to redo the analysis. I thought them to be wrong.” Mycroft looked at Sherlock closer, clearly assessing Sherlock for injuries.
After being wounded and sent home he had a low self-esteem, felt tired and unattractive. He tried a more conservative approach to sex. He hadn't had the energy left to fight prejudices that came with being an invalid and bisexual. His father was homophobic to the core, and the coming out of his sister was mildly put explosive. He put pressure on John, to keep away from queers. At that time John still wanted to please his father and wanted to prove that he was ‘normal’. John overcompensated by having a string of girlfriends.  But to be honest, even then, he kissed and shagged not only girls - so much for being straight. He talked at length with his therapist about his sexuality, and in the end he accepted is sexual self: He liked sex, he didn't mind the gender of his partner and as long as all parties give consent, everything is fine. And therefore he decided to forget the conservative approach and give in into his sensual and sexual nature again.
“That's a longer story,” John smiled relieved. They reluctantly released each other. Disbelief and awe was written on both their faces. They were both shocked and neither was willing to look somewhere else in fear of this being a dream. After some more moments of staring they erupted into giggles.
Meeting point: In front of the pub we once met.
Molly waited with the cabbie. She fiddled with her phone. After five minutes the van returned. Only one person was in the front. Molly recognized instantly who the driver was: Jim Moriarty. Her blood ran cold. In haste she ducked below the window and hid between the seats. The van drove back the way they had come. Molly was unsure. Was John still in the van? Or was it only Moriarty?
Greg took a deep breath and relaxed a little. “How were you able to find me?”
Talking to Sherlock about money was always a lost cause. Of course, he could ask Mycroft for a small loan. But his pride forbade it. He had already thought about cutting costs. Not taking Sherlock out for lunch was one step. John only had five pounds of cash left. Expensive food was definitely out of the question.
Mycroft closed the folder full of verve and leaned back in his chair. “I think, we are done for today. You should stay at my place. Baker Street needs to be swept first, and I would feel safer, when we have an update on Moriarty's whereabouts. Security at my house is adequate. DI Lestrade is also stopping by later to give me an update on the developments regarding the investigations. That might be interesting, too. And in case we forget: Sherlock, you are officially still dead.”
John took a deep breath. “Well, I am not. I think it's a reflex, because of the history with my dad. And in the army, there are lot of homophobes. I just hate the gossip. I am bi, if you want a label.”
“I have my ways,” said Mycroft. Greg looked at him disapprovingly, “and a trustworthy person that watched over the only unobserved entrance to NSY,” Mycroft added.
Stella retrieved a laptop from her bag and powered it up. She booked two plane tickets for the next day and promised to pick them up tomorrow morning. After that, she said her goodbyes and left again. The whole visit only lasted 15 minutes. John and Sherlock stood in the living room and stared at each other. Their adventure seemed be coming to an end. Both felt unsure what awaited them. So far, they had been living in their safe bubble.
“Now we do this again. You jump, for real this time. I want to see you dead,” Moriarty said.
Sherlock frowned. John pressed on. “I am done with girlfriends. The whole disaster with Mary taught me, that its not what I want or need. I don’t want domesticity, a house in the suburbs, a 9 to 5 job or a family with 1.4 children. I am happy here. I have everything I need here,“  he faltered a little bit. “What you probably witnessed when you came home,” he hesitated a little bit, stealing a short glance at Sherlock, “is not a new girlfriend. It is just an arrangement for casual sex.” He lowered his eyes down to the wine glass in his hand, contemplating the last sip.
John just shrugged. “Well. He is dead, you are welcome. The rifle is in the bolt hole, if you need it.”
John descenced to the lower levels, where the laboratories and the morgue were located. There he looked for a broom closet to hide in. Soon, he heard the staff starting to leave the laboratories. Every ‘Goodbye’ and ‘See you tomorrow,’emptied the corridors and increased his chances to meet with Molly unseen.
Mycroft’s mansion was big and had many guest rooms, but if anybody noticed that Sherlock and John shared one room, nobody commented on it. Like in the safe house they fooled around, snuggled together and slept like logs.
I want to speed up my posting and finish the story - RL gets busy. So sorry for any errors.
Again not betaed or brit-picked. Comments are appreciated.
“My contact in Switzerland, the same who sent me the list of Moriarty's men, informed me, that a British citizen was freed from Moriarty's hands. A doctor was requested for retrieval. At the moment I am quite short of personnel, especially with medical knowledge. My contact gave me an address for the pick-up. I trust him and he trust this source implicitly. Unfortunately he couldn't tell me more. It could be any of my old contacts or agents. And I feel obliged to get him back to England.” Mycroft shifted in his seat. It was obvious that he disliked asking for something.
He couldn’t do anything about the first issue. But the other two would be corrected. He still had some resources left. At the moment, he would just have to wait for a little bit.
A black van dropped them in front of an office tower. They entered the building under the disguise of cleaners. Their outfit consisted of an overall, latex gloves and baseball caps. They were equipped with a cart that held cleaning supplies. The trunk with the rifle was stowed in the cart and concealed beneath bottles, disposable towels and trash bags.
Sherlock drew in a bored breath. “It could be the bounty on Moran's head; or the thank you from some Arab Sheiks for solving their family problem; or the payment from Mycroft for retrieving me. Who cares? Just Mycroft's meddling.” He turned on the sofa to stare at its back pillows.
“What happened?” Sherlock asked. He desperately wanted to know, what had happened.
John calmed himself. He still had time. If he and Mrs Hudson disappeared tonight they might be thought dead. And nobody would think that the sniper hadn’t fulfilled his assignment.
“What?” John asked puzzled.
Their hands didn’t stay idle and wandered beneath their shirts. It wasn't enough. After a some time, both were without trousers and shirts. Sherlock was elated, that his attraction was reciprocated after all. His dreams and wishes were becoming reality. And John marveled at how alive he felt and how much Sherlock's presence soothed him. The lean body aroused him more, than any previous encounter he had had with a woman.
Driving was difficult, too. He did not have the time and money to buy a car, and renting a car bore the risk of being discovered, because he needed to provide a proof of identity and a driving licence. Also the trip would at least take 18 hours. He was alone and on a schedule. When he added the breaks to the overall driving time, it might take too long.
Greg just nodded and returned to Anderson. “Consider yourself warned,” he said.
“There is someone else whose news about his demise was a little premature. I am grateful, that you are here now. He is a horrible patient,” she said exasperated.
Molly grabbed her handbag, rummaged through some tissues, lipstick, hairpins and the taser and finally just threw her purse hat the cab driver. With a breathless “sorry,” she exited the cab and hurried to the entrance of St. Bart’s. She almost crashed into the sliding doors which were slightly too slow for her speed. Knowing the hospital intimately she went to the staircase and ran up to the upper most floors. Her lungs burned and her heart was racing. When she reached the entrance door to the roof, she stopped for a second to catch her breath. Sweat was collecting on her forehead and back.
She peeked outside, and when everything was clear slipped out of the cabin and left the church. She found John immediately. He mustered her from head to toe. It seemed she passed his examination. After that, John gave her a smile and short hug.
‘What's the matter?’ She shoved the keyboard towards him. John eyed the computer suspiciously.
“Nothing,” Sherlock mumbled. John raised an eyebrow.
John smiled, took Sherlock's hand, and silenced him with a kiss. He opened the door and pushed Sherlock through.
John took another deep breath. “Well, if we are having this discussion, I need another glass of wine.” He picked up the bottle of wine, poured a generous amount and settled back on his previous place. After a few moments his eyes fixed again on Sherlock.
Sherlock took off his suit jacket and joined John on the couch. They ate in silence, only the television kept it from becoming uncomfortable.
With every word, that Molly typed, John felt how the iron fist, that had clamped around his heart loosened. Molly's text got blurred. Tears formed in his eyes. For moments he struggled to keep silent. He fought to keep his breathing even and flat. His hands clenched and unclenched.
“Yep. In every possible combination.”
Meanwhile Sherlock had pulled out his mobile and frantically dialled John's number. Only the voicemail answered. After that he tried to call Greg Lestrade, but came up with the same result. Molly had watched him, sensing his desperation. She tried to gain his attention. “Sherlock,” Molly said shy. Sherlock didn’t react. She tried it again more resolutely, catching his arm.
“Lestrade was assigned to the case because it involved two bodies. Homicides. But he had no access to the Europol database to clarify the identity. His clearance wasn’t high enough,” Mycroft explained.
“I'll get a fresh one,” Mycroft said, “it shouldn't be much of a problem.”
On Saturday evening a knock disturbed their routine. John grabbed his gun, and Sherlock donned his fake glasses and a baseball cap. John opened the door with caution. He plastered a fake smile on his face and gripped the gun behind his back tighter.
He found a small internet cafe, run by a bored Chinese woman, and bought an access for half an hour. The new cap shielded his face ideally from the surveillance cameras.
A short clip of an earlier recorded press conference was shown. Lestrade was the main speaker. He spoke of the operation and what needed to be done. Then he was answering a reporter's question where he explained how all information on the servers was duplicated earlier to avoid data loss due to intentional tampering. John pitied Lestrade. He looked like death warmed over. He desperately needed sleep. Similar press conferences were held all over Europe. Mycroft was true to his word and had coordinated the downfall of Moriarty's web diligently.
Later on they stopped by NSY. Greg had gotten a promotion and had replaced the old Superintendent. His workload had doubled overnight. It would take months to wrap up all the open investigations, but they somehow ran smoother. It seemed Moriarty’s men had deliberately used their positions to slow down police work in the past.
Sometime after midnight, Molly deleted the whole document they had written. She even did short term memory wipe. After a good-bye hug, both happy, that they now were no longer alone with their sorrows, John headed back to his bolt hole.
Sherlock loosened the embrace and looked into John's eyes. He was also uncertain if he could trust his senses. He held John by his shoulders unwilling to let go.
Anne was all he needed for that purpose and after their first encounter, they exchanged their phone numbers and agreed, that a sole shagging relationship would be fantastic. Today was the fourth time they met and shagged, but the first time at Baker Street. John only took her to Baker Street, because he knew Sherlock was at Barts for an experiment which usually lasted long into the evening. No need to introduce her to Sherlock and explain awkwardly his new resolutions. He thought the arrangement was perfect. All was well.
A short chapter to further the plot. The boys will appear soon. Don’t be afraid.
If you don't know Hieronymus Bosch - google his picture "The last judgement". Nowadays it would need a trigger warning.
In the alley, he chose the shortest and most convert way to his bolt hole. He felt quite good, that he was able to get rid of his problem so fast. The next step would be, to get Mrs Hudson to safety. He couldn’t let her stay at Baker Street like a sitting duck. He knew just the way, how to do that.
Dimmock just smirked. “Well, Anderson was never the best with words.”
After changing his hoodie and cleaning away the blood, which had dried on his skin and needed to be scrubbed away, he went out again. First he got a baseball cap at a street vendor. Usually he ignored the illegal sellers, but now they were heaven sent. The newly acquired leather jacket from the sniper protected him from the cold weather and the light drizzle. Additionally he bought some simple clothing for women. The next step was a small convenience store for food, paper and a pen. The small shop was run by a Pakistan immigrant and was just right for his needs. Next, he needed internet access.
If everything was going like usual Mrs. Hudson would attend evening mass at St. Mary and he would be able to give her a message. There were no snipers anymore, which were confirmed by the Mail he found, but she could still be bugged, like Greg and John had been.
“Bart’s hospital, the roof. Please send someone,” Molly said to the operator and cut the connection.
Greg saved the recording to his private folder on the server. He had not a lot of Sherlock to remember him by. Greg used to think of himself as Sherlock's friend, but he had to admit, that if he applied this label, he wasn't a good one. Morosely he thought that he was no friend at all because he couldn't stop him from committing suicide.
“I have a thought,” Mrs Hudson continued. “Does all that mean Sherlock is still alive? If they kept the snipers around, then we must be useful in a way to them.”
When the kettle whistled, Sherlock shook himself from his stupor and determination settled on his face. He strode into his bedroom. John could hear the doors of the wardrobe banging. He was glad now, that he never had the nerve to put Sherlock's stuff away. Then he heard Sherlock retreating to the bathroom and sounds of the shower running filled the room. John settled in his chair, tea in one hand and flipping through his mailings – mostly bills and advertising. After 20 minutes Sherlock emerged again. His hair was still ginger, but the dark roots were showing significantly. However most of the old Sherlock was back: bespoke suit trousers, a tight blue shirt, black shoes and a dressing gown. The best thing in John’s eyes was that the clothes almost fit perfectly. All the additional food had been good for him. John had taken great care to feed Sherlock up again.
“Can’t read it either,” the cab driver spoke. Molly just nodded at him.
I read about the concept of “Chekov’s gun” and I tried to go along with that. When I introduced something, I tried to use it for the story. I hope, I left no loose ends.
After a few steps, Mrs Hudson turned around. “John,” she spoke up.
When they entered the mansion, Sherlock pulled him along to their bedroom. Before he could open the door, John shoved him against it and kissed him urgently. Their arousals were obvious through several layers of pants and trousers. John was on fire. He knew what he wanted, but he felt unsure. His breathing was heavy and his hands roamed over Sherlock's body.
The press release of Sherlock's survival was, as expected, a sensation. Therefore they were the headline of every newspaper for three days. The paparazzi camped outside of Baker Street day and night. Greg had visited them once to return John's leather jacket, but he got almost torn to pieces so he swore not to stop by as long as the mob was out there. Thankfully, three days later one of the younger royals had gotten caught stupidly drunk on a party and had taken the spotlight away. News was only good when fresh.
John held him back. “Sherlock, all is fine. No need to hide. Okay?”
He had done it – the final piece to a complete overview of the network: People, places, transactions, documents. But in the end he got sloppy and made mistakes. He hadn't slept for three days and eaten almost nothing. His body longed for sleep, for food. But he had to stay hidden; he had transmitted all his information to his contact in Switzerland. He would take the necessary final steps to stop Moriarty's organisation.
John chuckled and pointed at him, “pot,” and at himself, “kettle.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked disbelieving at John. “You think, Mycroft was right? You think I am a virgin?” Sherlock let his head fall back onto the back of the sofa and chuckled.
DI Greg Lestrade stared at photos, files and evidence bags that the forensic team had displayed on the table in a seldom used underground meeting room. The whole material of two separate cases had been put there, to give him a better overview. Two bodies were found yesterday: both victims were male, approximately 20 and 40 years old, and probably homeless. Greg assumed, they were connected and tried to unite the evidence into one case. His higher ups hadn't made the case a high priority. Homeless people weren't their main concern; especially, when other, more pressing cases needed solving. But he still felt the need to at least make the most basic effort here - for humanities sake.
“It is good to be back,” Sherlock said seriously. He hadn't expected to be missed and furthermore to be welcomed home with such warmth. The hugs of his brother and Lestrade had left a joyful feeling inside him. People usually didn't touch him.
With that, she flounced out of the room, kicking the door shut with her heels.
Sherlock however was speechless that everything had turned out well in the end. Mrs Hudson was unharmed, so were Greg and John. He wanted to thank Molly and Sally for their help, but he couldn't find the words. In the end, he shook hands with Sally and hugged Molly. He struggled to keep his composure.
‘Dear Matt,
Sherlock stepped toward the mirror over the fireplace. After taking stock of his appearance, he shrugged off his gown, dashed into his bedroom again and returned in a suit jacket.
John was speechless. He had never dared to think, that the stunts he had pulled in the last weeks could somehow have a positive impact on his dire financial situation. But it seemed that in doing what needed to be done he had made a fortune. It wasn't all legal, but it had been profitable.
John was silent. He was angry at himself for letting his guard down. While he tried to wiggle out of the handcuffs, he took stock of his surroundings. Everything was damp and the emergency lights cast eerie shadows around the room. The room was big and the ceiling was more than 10 meters above them. There was a door to his left. It was an air lock but John saw no possibility of opening it from the inside. On the ceiling was a small maintenance hatch, also closed.
He clicked faster and faster through the files and almost missed one: A selfie. Sherlock and John were sitting on the couch at Baker Street. John was holding a newspaper to prove the date. Both were grinning into the camera with Sherlock holding the phone to make the shot. Greg knew the photo. Sherlock had sent it to him almost half a year ago to prove, that he was not chasing criminals across England, but staying at home. Greg couldn't even remember, why he had insisted on the photo and which case they had tried to solve. He felt himself grinning and then it came back: Sherlock’s phone. This was the final proof. He exhaled sharply. His stomach was churning.
While one man started to assume, that his friend might not be dead, another man, in a dark cell, bound for 30 hours without food or water had lost all hope. His most desperate wish was to turn back time. He wanted to have again the opportunity to jump, but for real this time. This way the order to kill his friends would never be spoken, and they could still be alive.
Confirmation not necessary, I count on you.
John arrived in time at Greg's office. He felt nervous and jumpy. Despite being Saturday, some people were still working at the Yard. Greg saw him and hurried through the door to join him on the corridor, holding a folder in his hand. With a gesture he indicated to keep quiet. John threw him a puzzled glance but complied. Greg ushered him to a staircase dragging him along downstairs.
John didn’t struggle to move from his position any more. He just applied pressure to the man’s wrist, to be able to keep breathing shallowly. The sniper still used his other hand to punch John into the face or stomach. More blood came pouring out of the wound and trickled onto John and his hoodie. The sniper was losing strength by the second. The eyes, moments ago still clear got unfocussed and the grip loosened finally. John rolled the sniper beneath him. As soon, as he straddled him, he could feel him going limp, eyes staring unfocussed ahead. A last breath escaped his lungs. John fumbled for the pulse on the neck. I was fading away.
John just rolled his eyes and left the car. Before exiting, he indicated towards the umbrella. “May I borrow that? Rain’s a bitch.”
He took the photos of Nick, the sniper and the crime scene and distributed them on the desk. John and Mycroft kept silent, watching him while Sherlock inspected the photos thoroughly.
On his walk through various back alleys he mulled over the fact, that Molly was in a high risk position and had no mode of self-defence. She had been an important factor in Sherlock’s plan but had no protection, if his deceit became known. He needed to find a solution for that.
Plot, lemons, reunions.... Same as always :-)
John rummaged through his backpack and retrieved some fresh clothes. “Let's get ready. We need to get out of here. Mycroft doesn't think it is safe for us to stay in Ostrava. He organized a safe house. And breakfast would be great, too.”
Sherlock rechecked his calculations for a last time and instructed John where to aim.
He arrived at an Art Nouveau-styled mansion. It was impressive even in the dark. The way to the entrance door was lit and looked welcoming. He looked up and down the street, but there was no doubt that he was at the right place. He stepped up to the entrance door and rang the bell. The modern bell system had been fitted with a camera, John noticed, and he doubted that he could surprise the owner. Nevertheless he kept his hand on the handle of the gun at his back. His other hand clutched the strap of his backpack.
Greg also let slip that he currently stayed in one of Mycroft’s guestrooms. Since his impending divorce and the discovery of the surveillance on him, he had no safe place to stay. There was no time to go apartment hunting with his current workload and it turned out that this arrangement was quite convenient for coordinating plans with Mycroft. In addition, Greg knew where Mycroft had hidden the good wine and he now went to fetch some from the cellar.
“I saw, thanks.” John said. “I lay the table.”
Comments and Kudos are appreciated.
Any remaining mistakes are my fault :-)
“Don’t worry. I will… Yes, I will disappear as soon as this is finished. Finally time for a vacation, two months of surveillance is a bitch. … I could have made a fortune with other assignments, you owe me….  Yeah, Bye.” With that he cancelled the phone call and stepped to the window, checking the view.
“Do you by chance know anything about the roughly two million pounds in my bank account?”
After a few moments, the door was opened by a young maid and he was ushered in.
The train ride was as horrible as John had expected and it made him restless. He tried to nap whenever possible but needed to change trains regularly, so that didn’t work out. And  he also tried to keep out of everybody’s way. The time waiting at stations he spent standing in the shadows. Since all this began, he had stopped shaving. His growing beard helped change his features. He didn’t need to be an approachable doctor now. His gruff appearance kept people away, and that was good.
The cold of the stone tiles crept into his aching bones, dulling the pain. His mouth was parched and tasted vile. Time was slipping by unheeded. There were no shadows to help him calculate the amount of passing time. But it was of no consequence. He was way beyond caring. He just waited for the fog to win and subsume him into darkness.
“His jacket?” Moriarty spat viciously. “It was Sebastian's. Don’t you see, it's a vintage. Your pet just took it. He didn't deserve it. But he got what he actually deserved. In fact, I already took care of all of your friends.”
The final act starts....
“By accident I once saw two soldiers blowing each other off. I was disgusted at first, but I stayed and watched. I was fascinated and aroused. Never came so hard in my life.” John shook his head to banish the memory. “I don’t know what I am saying here. I just don’t know any more.” He buried his face into the cushion. How could something so fundamental like attraction mess him up like that? He liked women But why was it so hard to accept, that he reacted similarly to Sherlock? It shouldn't matter. They were alive, it felt good and after everything the press had written about them, he didn't care anymore what people saw in them. They only believed, what they wanted to anyway.
The cabbie followed the van to the outskirts of London. Her driver was clever enough to recognize the seriousness of the situation. He did everything to stay close enough to the van but not be obvious about it. The trip took longer than expected. Somewhere along the road, she was able to get a peek at the licence plate. After a short search by Sally, she confirmed it was a rented car. Sally informed Molly that she was now on her way with some officers to her location. She was able to call in a helicopter, but she now had to cut the phone call short.
“John,” he said, directed at him, waiting for John to turn his eyes on him. “Thanks,” he halted, “for telling me. You didn’t have to. And you don’t have to keep it outside Baker Street. I won’t interfere…”
Sherlock suddenly felt dizzy. His vision began to swim. He touched his cheeks. They were wet. More tears streamed down his cheeks. He stumbled to the sofa and sat down heavily. The tears wouldn't stop. Sherlock couldn’t understand. He took some deep heaving breaths. There were no reasons for tears.
Sherlock grinned. “Somehow, too many people were talking too much about vintage leather jackets, and I don’t believe in coincidences. Also Dimmock's work schedule and his access to information concerning us is highly suggestive. It is the only possible explanation, why Moriarty had knew what he did.”
The Operation “De-Bugging”, as they called it, would start in three days, a Thursday morning. In a coordinated effort all incriminated personnel would be arrested in on concentrated effort. Till then, Greg and Sally needed to coordinate their people and put them on Moriarty's helpers. If the operation went wrong, it would have dire consequences for Mycroft and his supporters. If this went right, it would be a serious setback for organised crime.
John bought another coffee and a tourist map at the station. After studying it, he had a rough idea where he needed to go. Without hesitation, he walked for 15 minutes to the address Mycroft had given him.
Molly paid the cabbie, exited the car and turned toward the entrance door of 221B Baker Street. The moment she stepped on the pavement, she saw the familiar figure of John hurrying around a corner into a back alley. She wanted to run after him, when a tall, bulky man jumped out of a black van and followed John into the alley.
John closed the man's eyes and got up to a kneeling position at his side, catching his breath. He struggled to his feet and went to the sink in the kitchen. He spit out some blood, rinsed his mouth and washed his hands. His whole body ached. He might get some nasty bruises, but he didn't think anything was broken. He felt to old for this shit. He returned to the dead sniper and padded his frame for anything valuable. There was the phone, a set of keys, a wallet and some receipts.
Greg’s eyes turned cold and he stiffened. He knew Anderson often said things carelessly, but those remarks and the subsequent comments of his colleagues had come back to haunt him after Sherlock had jumped. He knew they could hurt.
“I don’t think he knows that you are alive,” John mused.
He sorted through his thoughts. “I feel peaceful now. But there's also grief and fury. I want to scream at you for jumping, or tie you forcibly down to keep you from leaving. It’s violent. But I also want to hold you, rest with you and keep my hands on your pulse points to convince myself that you are alive; that this is real.” John lowered his hand to Sherlock's wrist and felt his heartbeat. He counted some beats to calm himself down. John’s voice became a whisper. “It’s like a Hieronymus Bosch painting. It gets worse the more I think about it.” He stared at the ceiling, fighting down the onslaught of emotions that so long were absent.
Sherlock was somewhere out there. So he had to get out of London and into the game. He may not want to be best buddies with Mycroft, but this was his chance to get closer to Moriarty's network, and perhaps to find Sherlock.
Around six, the sun was already gone, he started to get ready. He packed a small bag and left for church. When he arrived, he was glad that the area was still deserted, but the church was open. He entered and went into one of the confessional boxes. He opened the cabin and dropped the bag inside. Then he left the church again and waited in a spot, where he could observe the entrance.
Molly thought. After some time, she blushed. ‘Post an ad at 'AdultFriendFinder' in the FFM section. Sign it with SoldierBoy. We can then communicate via Private Messaging.’
“Listen everyone,” he began. “There is a code of conduct at the NSY. From this day on, I expect from everybody to adhere to it. That means no jokes about race, gender, sex, or looks. I know that the old Superintendent didn't care about that. But from now on, I will insist on it. If there is a violation I will gladly send you to a sensitivity training. If you still have trouble after that, you will get a warning. Understood?”
“Now I finally meet the famous Sherlock Holmes in person,” he snarled. “My boss sends his regards. He suspected that you were still alive. Nice trick though. We detracted the gunmen first. But as soon as Jim doubted your demise, he put them back on track. Thanks for giving us proof.”
Molly stilled her phone and redialled Sally. Only the voicemail answered. While it rattled down Sally’s greeting, she quickly formed a plan. She left a short message, slipped out of the car, and threw her mobile down the road as far as she could. She hoped Sally would understand the hint. She ran back to the cabbie. “Follow the van again,” she instructed the cabbie.
A very big thank you to my beta.
“I only have one question: Why do you need fresh corpse?” he asked confused.
Martha Hudson took a praying book and opened it. Then she took out the letter and hid it in the book while reading it.
“Sherlock,” John interrupted him. “Maybe I need to say this differently.” He nervously looked around the room but his gaze wandered back to Sherlock. “I am happy. I want to grow old like this, with you. This is it. This is what I want.” He took a gulp of wine. His hand trembled slighly. Sherlock knew, that John voiced more, than he initially wanted to say.
After an indeterminable amount of time the tall man came back. Sherlock’s bonds were released and he was dragged by two thugs into a small cell. He didn't struggle anymore. Moriarty's network was going to fall, with or without him. And his friends were dead, because of him. There was nothing left for him.
John just huffed annoyed and got out of the car. The rain had picked up in the last few minutes and was already drenching him. He threw an evil glare at Mycroft and prepared to close the door more forcefully than necessary.
Arriving at the front door at 221b Baker Street, he eagerly opened the door. He picked up the mailings from the floor, shimmied out of his coat to put it on the hanger while still holding the bag with the fragrant food.
“John?” he scrambled up from the bed to a kneeling position.
John’s spirits were soaring after he had confirmation that Sherlock hadn't died. But he was still worried, because he didn't know if his friend was currently okay. And while he was miffed, that he hadn't been able to help Sherlock two months ago and had mourned him, he was grateful, that Molly was able to support him. He understood that Sherlock had played a difficult and dangerous game against Moriarty, and he even accepted that Sherlock had no way of including him - especially, if they had been under close surveillance. John was impressed, that Sherlock was able to pull this all off. So much the worse he felt for his last argument with him: He called Sherlock a machine – but all the time Sherlock was trying to set everything up to fool Moriarty and get everyone out alive. There was one thing, John was certain of: Friends protect friends. And Moriarty had done his best, to seperate Sherlock from his friends. Unfortunately he succeeded. After everything John learned so far, he knew he did Sherlock a disservice and did not deserve Sherlock's loyalty. He wanted to make it up to him.
He was hooked now and continued looking through the other files. The text messages confirmed the ownership further: There were some messages from him, but most were from and to John. Sadness overcame Greg after reading those. They spoke of an easy going but deep friendship with lots of dark humour, friendly ribbing and teasing, shopping lists, case information and occasionally outrageous exclamations. Greg knew, he intruded on John's privacy, but he felt compelled, to read them all. The whole NSY including Greg had speculated about the relationship status of John and Sherlock. The jokes and insinuation at their expense sometimes had been very crude and seldom concealed. It seemed, they wronged Sherlock again and denied him something so innocent like true friendship.
Thanks to modern technology finding a fuck buddy had gotten easier and requests and preferences could be stated more honestly. Three weeks ago he opened up an account on a dating/shagging site and started searching for a willing and easy going partner. First he was a little bit sceptical, if he would be successful, but being honest and open seemed to be the ticket. His profile stated his bisexuality, age as a non-issue, openness to kinks and his wish for no strings attached. Anne was the first who messaged him. John expected the first response from some guy, because the more open sex platforms were mostly frequented by male clients, but well, everything was fine.  He met her for coffee the next day. She was from abroad, 47 years old, fed up with relationships, had to do business in London for the next six months and was looking for entertainment or as she phrased it: a willing dick. Their expectations fit and in the end she took him to her lodgings and they had some satisfying sex. He liked her direct approach on telling him what turned her on and she liked his practical knowledge - he was a doctor after all. He still got other requests, but he put his profile on hold. While he found it flattering, that so many people responded, one affair was enough at the moment.
Sherlock knew his way around in Mycroft's mansion and tugged John along. He used to stay with Mycroft after his first two rehabs. Despite the rivalry the brothers displayed, they once had lived together for more than a year. Sherlock had occupied one of the guest rooms on the ground level toward the garden. Since his last and longest stint of drugs, he never had returned to stay at Mycroft’s again. He had hated the supervision. He had preferred to rent an apartment in Montague Street. But he knew that his brother had always kept his old room ready for him since then. It was his way of showing support and brotherly love. Sherlock never knew, how he should respond to that but felt oddly reassured by that gesture.
(See the end of the chapter for
The curtains on the window were almost completely drawn, only a small gap was open for the rifle and the sniper to peek out. John stepped to the window. There was a perfect line of sight to 221 b Baker Street into his living room and Mrs. Hudson's small kitchen downstairs.
She painstakingly retold the woman on the other line everything what happened so far. But unfortunately she couldn’t tell her what kind of help she needed and where.
“This is not a Bond movie,” Mycroft huffed. “And I don’t want to send you into unnecessary risk. But all the planning and the retrieval must be handled by you. I don't have any resources left. Well, what is your answer?”
John was speechless. “Mrs Hudson, how...”
John used the map to find the way back to Baker Street through back alleys. He knew of a flat at 218c Baker Street that suspiciously stayed empty for some time. Sherlock commented once on it, while he was still alive. He wanted to take a look, if it was really empty. If so, he would start his operations there. Then he could observe Baker Street and any suspicious dealings.
Of course, John and Sherlock knew better. The corpse of the real Sebastian Moran had been cremated two days ago. Instead of him the next available male corpse without family ties and within an acceptable age range was set up to pose as Moran. With no previous photos or DNA samples nobody would be able to contradict his identity. John sometimes wondered, if it really was that easy to procure corpses, or if Sherlock and Mycroft just had a knack for it.
Sherlock spooned him and held him tight. After some time, they got up to clean themselves and crawled back into bed. John realized how Sherlock was trying to distance himself from him. With a swift but profound decision, John just pulled him closer. It felt right.
John broke the kiss with a small grin. “Do you have any lube?”
John's eyes widened. Well, he thought, nobody would probably assume some communication from Molly and him at a swinger site. And if she checked in there regularly, it was brilliant. He grinned and nodded.
John felt paralysed. He heard the blood rushing in his ears. He was afraid that if he moved, the moment would shatter and he would realise that his mind was simply playing tricks on him. John lost his grip on his backpack and it thumped on the ground. He took a few steadying breaths and some tentative steps toward the bed. Tears gathered in John’s eyes and laughter bubbled up in him.
“Well, I’ve checked them now,” Mycroft said. “They were mercenaries. One sniper was found dead in an old castle locked away on the north-eastern border of the Czech Republic. His name was Harry Musgrave.” Mycroft pulled two photos from a folder and put them on the table for everyone to see. One was the photo Sherlock had made with his phone almost three months ago.
He made up his mind to fetch some coffee from the office kitchen. Then he would take a closer look at this case, including a check of the retrieved files from the mobiles.
John swallowed down the lump in his throat. He smiled shakily “I love you, too.”
Greg pulled back and just grinned at him. “I am glad, that you are back. But you have a lot of explaining to do!”
“Do you have a place outside of London? That would be best. The less you are seen on surveillance, the better. And Mrs. Hudson doesn’t have any spare clothing. You need to go shopping. I can provide you with some money. And if you still have a gun: keep it with you,” John ordered.
“Believe me, I would prefer a rom-com,” Molly said. They drove back toward the city centre. Molly was unsure what to do now. If she still had her phone she would have tried to call Sally again.
John chuckled without humour. “I expected something along the line: 'if something goes wrong, we will deny anything.'”
John gets things done... But is it too late?
Greg then told of his success with solving the murder of Nick Henley, the case that had led him to the last month's adventure. Mycroft had told him about Sherlock’s deductions and he had followed up on those. Nick’s boyfriend had come in for a short statement, but Greg let him go without further questions. He deliberately let the trace for the murderer of the sniper go cold. He had no interest in solving that part of the case. In the official files the man would stay an unnamed homeless person with an unknown killer. In fact, they should even thank Nick’s boyfriend, because the act of revenge had made it possible for Lestrade to escape Moriarty’s surveillance and start the chain of events that led to the downfall of Moriarty. This was no news to him, so Sherlock only listened with half an ear.
Sherlock inhaled sharply and froze.
Moriarty was furious - all his careful planning had been for nothing. His painstakingly groomed and selected supporters had become useless. He didn’t know where he had made a mistake, but something had gone horribly wrong. First: his network was crumbling. Second: Sherlock Homes was still alive. Third: Sherlock's friends were still alive.
Irene laughed. “It seems the information we both heard about each other was wrong. Good for us. Follow me.” She walked down a corridor and led him to a door. John trailed behind her numbly.
The man raised his hands and took a step back. With that move he whirled around and jumped at John. Out of reflex, John fired the gun. The bullet grazed his attacker on the neck and hit the window frame. The sniper hissed in pain, but the momentum of the jump propelled him further to John. He crashed into him and pushed John to the ground. One hand clenched and tightened around John’s throat.
After all that, John still had some minutes left from his internet time. So he checked the news, while munching his sandwich: Nothing of interest – only the always there celebrity gossip. Currently an Arab prince was in London and doing business here. His exaggregated lifestyle gained some press coverage. But for everything that happened to John in the last 24 hours, the world out there seemed to be calm.
“Obviously.”
John halted him, hand resting on his shoulder. “But what if it does? If this means something. Or am I just going insane?” He paused. “The last few months, I felt like all my senses had been muted. Everything was dimming around me. But not now, not here. I feel alive again,” John confessed closing his eyes.
“I assumed John needed to retrieve one of my old study buddies. How is this possible? How did you know, who to contact? Even Stella confirmed that she picked up a redhead.” John could see how Mycroft wasn’t able to combine the facts. He had never seen Mycroft so flustered.
Sherlock swallowed at the sudden increase in intimacy. He planted a reverent kiss on John's lip. “I'll take care of you,” he promised.
Sherlock mustered Moriarty up. Molly could see that he wanted to play for time. “That is John's jacket,” Sherlock stated.
After almost an hour on the sofa, Sherlock had calmed down and was dozing on John's shoulder. The doorbell rang and Sherlock startled awake. “That's the food,” he said and clambered up. He felt slightly ashamed and avoided looking John in the eyes.
After countless minutes he heard the shower water starting to warm up the water. Sherlock unfroze, pulled out his phone, dialled their favourite Thai-restaurant and placed an order. It would be delivered within the hour.
Mycroft gave the driver a short nod and the car started to accelerate.
“Sorry. Just a thought I am afraid to voice. It may be considered a bit not good.”
John opened the text message.
John was plagued by gruesome nightmares every night. The world was dull, grey and distant. On top of that he had a bad shift at the A & E. And he didn't even care anymore. He felt completely lost, adrift. He tried to keep grounded, to find reasons to do things. But there were none.
“Sherlock, dear! You have a visitor.” Irene stepped to the bed and pulled the blanket away. Then she turned to John, who was frozen in place. “Doctor, he is all yours. I am done with begging him to eat. It's no fun, when he is moping around. If you need anything, ring for the maid. We meet tomorrow for breakfast.”
Upon entering 221B Baker Street John and Sherlock wished Mrs Hudson a good night. She was ecstatic to be back. It had been a nice change to stay at the countryside, but she had missed her home. The men climbed up the stairs and entered the apartment.
Sherlock and John spent the rest of the day in front of the telly, surfing from channel to channel and raiding the fridge when hungry. They enjoyed the easy camaraderie. It didn't matter, that they weren't at Baker Street. The feeling of belonging was present in the safe house, too. Around midnight they retired to bed.
Molly's driver stopped in the parking zone for cabs 50 yards away, where she had a perfect view of the van. Moriarty exited the van and strode into the hospital like he owned the place. Through the glass doors, Molly could see that he stopped in front of the elevators. She had a sinking feeling that she knew where Moriarty was heading.
“Who?” Sherlock asked confused.
The cabbie came to a halt at the private road. “I can't go in there, Ma'am, or I'll lose my licence.” He turned toward Molly and waited for instructions.
After thanks and goodbyes to Irene and Kate they took off. They crossed through Poland without any complications and arrived in Berlin within six hours. No one bothered to check them when they crossed the borders. The EU open border policy worked in their favour and everything went according to plan. The safe house was located on the outskirts of Berlin and was easy to find. It was a small cottage and stood a little remote from other buildings.
First she looked confused, but John whispered: “I believe in Sherlock Holmes.” The woman nodded once. With that he straightened and walked back into the station to catch his tube to St. Pancras.
The Taser however was new to him. He heard about them, but never used one. The shock might be deadly to someone old or with a heart condition, but John had to admit, that it was quite convenient and a good solution if you didn’t want to kill someone. John was certain, that in case of the previous owner the 'not killing' meant 'keeping alive' for interrogation.
“Is your room okay?” John asked.
He dumped his keys, wallet and jacket onto one of the kitchen chairs. Only then he noticed John leaning at the kitchen counter. John just waved a short hello, munching on a sandwich. At a second glance Greg noticed another person behind the opened fridge door riffling through its content.
John and Sherlock were high on adrenaline. They giggled almost the whole way back. John felt elated. He had just shot a man, but he didn't feel bad about it. It was similar to the situation two years ago with the cabbie. The prince had been a bad man and he deserved it. And hell, John made a sniper rifle shot worth that of a professional gunman.
He finished up, took his shopping bags and went back to his bolt hole, always taking care to stay in the shadows. The only thing left to do was writing a letter. After that, he felt beat. But now he could finally get some rest. There was nothing to do till tomorrow evening. After some perfunctory ablutions he fell into a light, but restful sleep. He could finally be helpful again. No nightmares kept him awake. He dreamt of cosy nights in Baker Street with take-away, violin music and a vivacious detective.
Kudos and comments are appreciated.
“Oh, brother...,” Mycroft whispered, and pulled Sherlock into an awkward hug.
Sherlock nodded. “I had gotten suspicious as soon as I started to see them more regularly around us. They had appeared in addition to the other gunmen, Moriarty had put on me. I wanted to get the photos to you for a background check. But I never got the chance.”
Anderson huffed. “Being gay is just a hipster statement. I bet you that in some years, the so called gays will go back to banging women.” His eyes disparagingly fixed on John’s hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“There you are”, the man wheezed. Blood was pouring out of the neck wound. Both men were fighting for control, rolling on the ground, kicking and punching if possible. The sniper was trying to tighten his hold around John's neck. John fought for breath. John realized, that the sniper had extensive close combat training and he couldn't gain the upper hand. He tasted blood on his tongue and felt bruises, where the snipers fist had connected on his rips and stomach. John's vision started to narrow. He heard this blood rushing in his ears. He focussed on the neck wound of the sniper. Blood poured out of it at a disturbing rate. The bullet had hit an artery. John realized he had to play for time.
“How much do I owe you?” Molly asked the cab driver in a hurry.
Another two hours later, he had made even more progress. Silently he returned to his office and used the darkness to close the blinds on his windows. With some equipment from the surveillance department he tracked for bugs there and disabled them.
Reverently he opened the door to Sherlock’s bedroom and took everything in a last time, checking if all was in order and indulging in some of his most treasured memories. He went up to his own room and sat at his desk. From the drawer he first took pen and paper and wrote a short letter. After that he picked up his gun, cleaned and loaded it. He moved to his bed and sat on the mattress. Rain splattered on the window pane. In the distance he heard the sounds of the city: cars honking, police sirens blaring - the general susurrus of people minding their businesses. The house itself was deadly silent.
“I am so sorry,” Mrs Hudson started weakly. “I should have suspected that the man who picked me up wasn’t a proper police officer. I should have asked for the code word.”
“Sounds good. Get me something spicy.” John smiled and vanished in the bathroom. Sherlock just stood in the living room, listening to the sounds of John shaving. The low hums of an unknown pop song were carried to him. It was so domestic, that Sherlock needed some time to get his bearings. He felt unhinged and out of place.
First, he needed to disappear in case someone was trailing him. Second, he had to include John to help him. The first was easy, the second, was a little bit trickier. But Greg was confident, that he could solve whatever this was about.
Seconds later, a loud bang from the roof entrance startled them. Six officers in full armor stormed in and surrounded them. One of them stepped closer and took in the scene. He grabbed his radio set. “Stand down, situation is under control,” he roared into the mouthpiece. He went to Sherlock and gestured him to step away from Moriary. The officer grabbed Moriarty at his neck and pulled him up. A bag was pulled over his head. At gun point, Moriarty was dragged by five officers from the roof down the stairs. The leader remained, giving and receiving orders to and from his head piece.
I split the last chapter into three short ones. Therefore the whole story will have 16 chapters.
John nodded. “What about Mrs Hudson? I think there is no need, to keep her hidden anymore.”
They both had some individual therapy to deal with all the horrible stuff that happened. Firstly, Sherlock thought it superfluous, but his therapist was surprisingly competent. He made him see the value of emotions, the need to accept them and how self-care was not selfish but essential. This led to more introspective thoughts and the realization that he was finally in a good place and happy.
“Bondage?”
John wrinkled his nose. Something tickled and and it finally woke him up. His eyes were still closed, but he sensed the daylight was illuminating the room. He was warm and comfortable. Slowly all his senses came alive. He had rolled onto his back during the night. Sherlock's head rested on his shoulder, arm and were leg flung possesively over John. John’s own arm was slung around Sherlock's waist. Sherlock's longer than usual hair flopped partly over John's mouth and nose, thus tickling him awake.
“Sherlock,” John interrupted, “you are not the only reason, why I want to keep it discreet. I also don’t want Mrs. Hudson talking; and I don’t want any of my paramours getting attached. Keeping the distance is a good method for that. And it is also good for me to keep things separated.”
The inspector felt his stomach drop. Only one person came to his mind with this peculiar contact list: Sherlock.
Greg should have known that he wasn't the only one, who knew the weak points in the surveillance of the NSY headquarters. He had a lot of questions running around in his head but he didn't know where to start. So he kept silent and rolled his eyes. He was sleep deprived. And with Mycroft here he knew for certain that something epic was going on.
John had already made up his mind. Waiting for something to happen in his bolt hole made him crazy. He couldn't help Lestrade in an official capacity. He had nothing to lose, probably not even his job anymore. He was gone for over a week now. His current employer wasn’t really impressed with his work ethics. He had been overtired and grumpy most of the time. And according to Greg not even a missing person’s report was filed for him.
Matt took a deep breath. “John, I owe you, of course. Anything I need to know?”
He rested the barrel of the gun against his lower lip and opened his mouth. While first he was calm, his left hand started shaking with the task. He also raised his right hand to the trigger, trying to steady himself. The shaking got worse. He felt tears on his cheeks. He cried and after endless moments of trying to pull the trigger he vomited onto the carpet. Sobbing and hating himself for being too afraid to pull the trigger, he curled into a small ball on the mattress, bawling for an endless time into the cushion till exhaustion overtook and an uneasy sleep encompassed him.
“Sure, laugh away,” John says nonchalantly,   tromp over my mental health like it’s your backyard veranda, why don’t you,   “Just remember that   was a demonstration, one I intend to imitate when I dip
“I’ll be right back.”
"So what is this bloke, some sort of... gay serial rapist-?" Anderson asks as they tread over to the crime scene barrier. It's raining so hard it's caused some mudslides on the park grounds and the darkness does little to improve visibility.
Sherlock stares back at her in a daze of confusion. Slowly, his eyes travel to the chessboard she’s referring to on the table.
Sherlock: ...Is it Wallace?
“You know darling, there are some things that even I don’t know.”
No response.
“Perhaps. It’s possible he feels that he’s being replaced. Or that he finds girlfriends are more amiable. I have no idea,” says Sherlock, pretending he has no idea.
,” she says, looking at him like the apocalypse has struck, because for all intensive purposes, it has. The comment unnerves him enough to finally tear his eyes away from John permanently, resuming the dance and conversation with full focus.
"Eurus did."
John sends out another text, wondering why Sherlock isn't responding. Normally he's good about texting, but sometimes Sherlock ignores him in favor of ‘greater intellectual pursuits' such as his 'Nobel-winning research on ash' (which John is of the opinion is really something of a byproduct of his addiction and an over-obsessive mind), or simply because the devil is bored and likes to impishly scroll through John's demands for his attention without acknowledging them-- which is never appreciated, particularly when John has legitimate concerns.
“Not again.”
Without easing his glare, the merperson pivots on the palm of his hand and dives back into the water, vanishing beneath the cover of seawater.
What are you doing to me, Sherlock?
from pain during shark lunch hour. He remembers the way it's head fell so indolent and entrusting against his shoulder, wanting for breath. He’d never encountered an animal so poorly designed- how it had not been wiped out by natural selection already was a marvel.
? What was he
There's always going to be goons on the internet, but finding one that embodies the absolute opposite of what you think is a rare find! Apparently this guy is a counselor, while I know absolutely nothing about humans and relationships, but I will be arguing against this perspective anyways. Enjoy~
John grumbles and rubs his eyes. “Please tell me you didn’t,” he gripes, pausing by the fridge in a moment of deep discontentment.
JOHN: NOT USUALLY BUT WHEN I’M WITH SHERLOCK IT GETS A BIT HAZY.
"Where is his body?! First it was organ donation and now its donation to science. You have to pick one!" John snaps at the ME. The following week, John had finished his shift as a locum early and headed straight for the medical examiner’s office where Sherlock’s body was supposedly being stored to confirm Sherlock’s vices.
Sherlock, trekking across the expanse of glimmering hardwood with his hands in his trouser pockets, passes Nigel by and encounters the elusive Mr. Davenport, whom piques his interest.
“Well,
Hearing the implicit smile in its tone, John feels his nerves give way, his legs buckle, and he leans his head against the cold granite limply. He forces his eyes closed despite the nagging dread, breathing measured breaths that are revving to leap forward out of his control and hyperventilate.
After mulling it over for hours on end, well into the silent night, he's still unable to get it out of his head. He decides he needs to seek her out. Get answers, get it straightened out. Even if everything he learned in medical school is telling him it's a lost cause.
COLLECTING TEST RESULTS>>>
“There’s only one way to be certain,”she tells him in a gently persuasive voice.
John, rummaging through the closet for his coat, pauses to process this.
John stares at her for a long minute, like he's very, very perplexed. When he finally responds, he sounds like a sloth.
Contending with this man only makes you that much more of an idiot.
He can hardly meet his own gaze in the mirror at the thought. If he wasn't kicking himself for letting that night happen, he certainly is now. She inhales against him while he tries to suppress the scent of her perfume and all associated memories, frantically piling everything into the delete bin. He flutters his eyes closed at the sudden threat of tears, shaking the sentiment away. He tries in vain to get a grip, her hands, her breath, her voice, everything waging war on his senses.
“Do you ever grow weary of stating the obvious?” Sherlock inquires with a aloof edge to his voice, pouring himself his poison of choice.
“Even if I did remember,” Sherlock concedes, “hearsay carries very little weight in an investigation, John. Even you can appreciate that—”
