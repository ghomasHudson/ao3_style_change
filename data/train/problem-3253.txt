God, Dean hated witches.  Every new spell they encountered seemed like a tertiary character roaming into the third act of a play to shoot the entire established plotlines to hell.  Unlike these third string characters though, spells at the very least followed a rulebook.  They needed often nefarious ingredients, a container of varying creepiness, the titular witch, and a target.  The rest was just a lottery ball spin of the details.  Dean swished the mug in his hand in a small circle, gesturing for him to get the hell on with it already.
“You have my apologies.”
“’Kay.  You still heading over for dinner?  If you got a date or something Claire and I can manage…”
Wavering one foot in sleep and one in wakefulness, he strained his ears to hunt for Cas’s footfalls about the house.  He pulled more of the sheets and comforter back to the center of the bed so Cas would be warm even if his excess body heat wasn’t enough.  He was on the fence as to whether to try holding him close in the same fashion they were standing.  Would he even be comfortable with Dean lying close to him?  Cas made it known he wanted to be physically closer, but was hesitant at times, as if he would be burned by too much adoration.  Was it foreign to him?  Did no one fill that very human need to be understood and accepted by skin to skin contact?  It chilled him to suppose it was true but burned him to think it wasn’t.  For the first time, he felt the deep desire to keep Cas by his side soak all the way down to in his bones.  He had always assumed he would eventually leave, return to whatever universe he visited from, but there was no evidence he would or even could.  The questions piled up in his mind, hooking him by the cheek back into more alert consciousness.  The door opened and closed again, prying open his lulling eyelids.  Feet padded around the bedframe and the mattress dipped beside him.  A hapless yawn sounded out beside him and Cas curled in on himself into find a comfortable knot even a couch could accommodate.  With that heated yawn, the veil of their bond grew incredible thick around them, like an exposed underbelly of trust expanded at its epicenter.  The agent’s eyes opened wide, searching the traces of light for a fraction of Cas’s silhouette.  He inched closer to Cas’s face, feeling his exhales mingle with his.
“The report said Dean called the paramedics.  He watched over him, waited at his bedside until he regained consciousness about 24 hours later.  Once he woke up, he didn’t stick around.  No one has seen Ketch since.  Probably ended up in one of those black sites if I had to guess,” he uttered, shifting in his seat as he spoke.
She rested her crossed arms on his desk and exhaled.  “I appreciate that, Dean.  Even if they were, I wouldn’t give a hoot.  I just would hate to see the months of work everyone has put into catching those bastards be shot to hell because of something silly.  Heck, I hope he’s getting happiness somewhere.  We all put in too many hours, miss sharing too many life events in service of our country.  A fellow agent at least understands the struggles,” she smirked.
“You… you miss him.” The sentiment cried havoc in his ribcage.  The sudden absence of close family was an ache that takes time to heal, no matter how much effort you put into soothing its illusive jabs.
The loading animations of the phone danced light over his features as Sam considered pushing Cas a bit further into confessing earnestly to Dean.  The somber expression on his friend’s face dulled his resolve and he placed a hand on his Cas’s in an effort to soothe the angel.  Though the gesture didn’t translate quite the way Sam intended to, the angel canted his head to the side and met his open gaze.  “He’ll get over it eventually.  Hell, he’ll probably even enjoy taking her apart again just to learn something new about repairing her.  I know it will be tense for a while, but he cares about you.” He puffed up holding an uncomfortable sigh in and dropped the angel’s hand. “I know what will make him better in no time,” he said as he searched in his bedside table again, using the phone to illuminate his way to the contents of the drawer.
A kind smile graced her features waiting for Claire to finish pulling on her remaining sock and tie her shoes while frustrated kiddie curses hovered in the air around her. Rushing to be in her aunt’s orbit, she missed a loop to knot her laces together.
“Well, get some forks and spoons out and I’ll be right back.  This is from my favorite place, so be nice.  Can’t have you giving them a shitty rating online using my phone so they spit in my food when I order take out again,” he warned walking down the hall into his room to change.  Cas had seen him in his favorite FBI sweatshirt with pulled out ratty cuffs, plus the thing needed a wash, so he grabbed a fresh set of waffle knit pajama pants and a quippy shirt to lounge in.
He nodded with a small smile and plated two bowls of noodles with a generous amount of heavily herbed sauce on top.  He briefly pointed at the dish, offering a third plate to Sam, but he declined.  “Sorry, got dinner plans later.  Thanks though.  I cleared Theta for you from tomorrow.”
“Depends,” he answered.  How he found the willpower not to cross his arms in that moment, he didn’t know.  The man’s stare pinned him down between two thick panes of glass.  Either he made light of his life’s work or carelessly revealed something between the lines.  Taking too much time to answer could give the impression that he was conjuring a believable lie.
“What happened to that ‘Bureau 5’?” he half snarled at the intruder.
Dean leaned back in his slightly more accommodating chair and waited.  Like he didn’t know the whole place was bugged, but hey theatrics sometimes make all the difference.
Incredulity and sarcasm muddled his laugh.  “Yeah, cuz everyone wants their defense attorney to look like an afterhours street racer.”
Like a hand dives to sooth a cramping muscle, he wove through traffic hurriedly back to St. Lucia.  The parking lot was much fuller, but he found a spot near the back of the lot and checked for any messages from Sam.  None had come since he checked the hour before so that must have been more good news, right?  The caffeinated agent crossed the lobby and climbed the four flights of stairs to the floor where the enigmatic mute rested.  Needing a minute to clear his head, he stopped off in the bathroom and gave himself a once over.  He certainly didn’t look as rough as the day before, but he wasn’t sure how much that said.  The puffiness under his eyes was much better and he had done an admirable job shaving at 6 o’clock that morning with only a whiff of coffee in his system.
“Yeah, I remember.  And I think we both know now why he didn’t want to, you know… let you in,” he mused mirroring Cas’s lean on the railing.
In the first days of their elemental free lifestyle, things were relatively calm, for two hunters and an angel anyway.  No major cases stole their attention, but various calls for established lore between pages in the library came from hunters from four different states.  It was a higher volume than they were used to, but no creatures involved were so rare that they dedicated more than a couple days to scrape up the lifesaving materials.  For them, it was downright serene to be homebound for that long, well without the fear of being electrocuted if they stepped foot outside of the bunker or similar constraints.
“Earth to Cas!” Dean gripped their braided fingers tighter for a moment.
“Since we don’t have a tasting room, the Roadhouse unveils our newest products to the market during our sponsored events.  Normally, these land on the last Friday of the month.  If we have to push back brewing by another week that puts us into next month,” he explained and headed back towards the main tank room.
He pushed the top of the box up to flop down on the other side of the table with a liminal raise of the brow.  His eyes grew large darting from one colorful piece of glazed fruit to the next covering the custard tarte held together by a graham cracker crust.  Dean knew as soon as he saw it, he would enjoy the sight of Cas digging different fruits out and expectantly savoring each new juicy flavor.  Undoubtedly the rainbow colored tarte looked delectable, but feasting on it with Cas was bound to be the highlight of his day.  Dean grabbed the forks and put one in Cas’s hand with a nudging head tilt.
After the first round of plastic cups, it became clear both unfamiliar ladies were competing to be Charlie’s date for the day.  By the second round, a huffy bottle red head stomped off to her electric car and the lovely Gilda tucked herself sheepishly into Charlie’s side.  The tickled Charlie practically beamed with pride smoothing her newly courted beau’s hair away from her face and offering to show her around the property.  Her thinly veiled attempt to disappear just out of sight to make out with gusto was as obvious as a ketchup stain on a white rug to anyone with an eye in their direction.  The rest of the party impressed with her fast work clinked cups and drank to her lovely catch.
Sam ran his hand over his mouth, staring at them both but not seeing them.  “What happened to your little grey man theory?”
“That’s when you fell for Balthazar?”
Her phone buzzed a couple of times as they split jabs in both directions.  Frowning at the time, she endeavored to rush the rest of their part along, stabbing her spider quick fingers across the digital keyboard.  She slid her phone into her silk jacket pocket and grinned so wide Sam could make out the glint of her canines.
“Keep an eye on him and let me know the second he says anything,” he stretched.  “Okay, maybe not the first second.  I’ve gotta get a few winks in before I head back in.  I couldn’t get a word out of him and I’m not too sure he understood a word I said.  You might have to call in an interpreter.  You good to keep watch, Sam?”
Sam smirked.  “You think the first thing Cas does when he gets his power back is not gonna be to track you down and break all my electronics?”
“The date has to go well enough for you to find out,” he let out with an airy laugh that disguised his intrusion into his territorial bubble.  “I gotta say Cas, I was pretty nervous about letting you loose in our home,” he tone dipped into firm vibrato, echoing his bare honesty.
Dean’s knee bounced up impatiently as the snippet of the film replayed on its title card a third time.  “If he takes any longer I swear I’m gonna…”  He eyes swept back to meet Cas’s then stalled out.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about,” she added chugging towards the new gunmetal grey door brimming with nonchalance.
Clearly gritting his teeth, he nodded but soaked in the silence between the call and response as if to isolate a distant drum beat.  “It’s a duck.”
“I’ve seen worse,” he shrugged.  “Besides, he hasn’t chased me away so far.”
“And keeping his words filed away with the power bill isn’t going to lessen that,” he proffered.
Garth looked upward beside Castiel.  They shared a glance, but Garth cheer filled cheeks split their silent regard for the maniacal jeering upstairs.  “Morning, Castiel.”
Her head hung lower as she shrugged.  “All of you deserve better than this.  Sure, I can fill your fridge with steaks every week out of guilt, but Claire’s the one who won’t grasp why her world is upside down yet again.  Just let me spoil her.  I
“I’ve done it before, plus MacLoed’s was shut down most of the week so they don’t need a top off.  Just have the Roadhouse this week.”
Diluted concern laced Dean’s face as he fumbled not crossing his arms defensively.
Dean stared at him blankly.  “What?”
All available oxygen whisked out of the room.  This was a joke, the cruelest, most malicious, most perverse proposition.  He should have slammed the door shut as soon as he saw that ridiculous badge.  But would Dean do this to him only to twist the knife?  No, this was… there had to be some other meaning behind it.  His heart hammered in his chest, the exposed nerve at the tip of his withered Grace unwittingly climbed out to his companion’s soul, fondling at its inert light for a port of entry.
A winded inhaled shook him at the admission.  His fingers curled around Cas’s and he found the strength to open his eyes.  There his face hovered inches away gazing into his eyes with a tender, patient smile, waiting for permission.  Ardent affections wafted from the angels adoring smile almost throwing Dean backwards to bask in its power more clearly.  Dean wanted to believe with the truth finally out, they would sync right back up, lift their hearts from the dusky swamp back into the cloudless joy they once resided in.  Of course reality was too hard to wrestle, too battle hardened to concede at so forthright a confession.  This is what Sam was warning him about.  How long had he known?
Attempting to avoid too much conversation too early and possibly alienate his friend, he kept his reply brief. “Morning, Dean.”  He monitored every inhale, every shift, and every pull of the blanket for the withdrawal. When none came, he slowly rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling.  Any acknowledgement would send the human into a needlessly taxing tizzy of self-examination.  Just talk about the case, the weather, he thought, anything but the pleasant whole body harmonics of their bodies touching.  Memorizing the sensations for later internal cataloging would be enough.  No need to ask for more… “How are you feeling after yesterday?”
“You both know most of the details, never ones to miss the required reading.  I was originally sent in to look into the multiple kidnapping plots of one Alex Krycek.  In that effort, I cozied in with the ‘family’ committing various crimes to earn their hard won trust: assault, extortion, coercion, and my own special variety of battery.  They weren’t just after local officials and politicians, no.  They went after county clerks and custodians alike, anyone within the vicinity of their group’s ultimate goal.”
“Not yet,” he responded flicking his eyes down to the offensive garment and back up at his face.
Over the course of the months away from home, he stared in the mirror to identify the gifts Cas left him: the astigmatism was gone, the scar on his back disappeared, and storms no longer made his knees ache with the changing pressure.  His adhoc improvements didn’t stop at the obvious.  Knowing Cas, any latent illnesses were eradicated as well.  Just by doing what he could while he could, it enabled him to put his best foot forward into a life without him.  It felt almost malicious when he first realized it, to force him to live longer but alone.  But that’s what this insane mission was all about: forcing his foot onto the accelerator, making sure he didn’t remain stagnant.
--------------------------
The stranger took the opportunity to grab the abandoned green jacket on the bed and rubbed the material between his finger pads.  Only then did he return his focus to Dean’s face.  With a sharp exhale, he nodded in readiness.
Rounding the corner, he saw his friend once again casually dressed, his hands buried deep in his front pockets.  As much as he wanted to watch him from afar and contemplate the myriad of ways he adored him, Cas appreciated when he was prompt.  “Hey, Cas,” he greeted him with a clear timbre.
A thoroughly unamused scowl graced his face in response.
“Oh, could you be off your game then?” he dangled a hook in front of him as they entered the elevator.  “That dancer you had a dalliance with a few months ago turned out to be quite the damp squib if memory serves.  I’m sure just putting yourself out there your rectify that in short order.”
“It’s my house.  I can put whatever I want with my waffles.”
The shelter snagged a nagging tether in his mind as soon as he stepped foot in it though.  For all its mysterious inner workings, like the lights and power seemingly drawn from the earth itself, the longer he puttered around in its innards the more cozy it felt.  Ignoring his own warnings about getting overly invested in their sudden tangible turn of luck, at least one day per weekend was spent smoothing out its obsolescent edges.  For the sake of the business he kept formulating ways to tie it into their business model.  Maybe it could be a real speakeasy with actors and a real publicly viable bar. The rooms could be renovated to convert it into a small hotel with the odd amenities like the shooting range or pool he refused to contend with.  Then there was the more apocalyptic possibility: last refuge for humanity when zombie creatures overrun Kansas.  Hey, he needed something to fantasize about when spreadsheets tried to overwhelm and bore him to death in equal measure.
His hand ran over his face again but rested it firmly over his mouth.
“No offense Sammy, but you look like you just licked the fence from Jurassic Park.  We got this.”  The light from the hallway illuminated several rude hand gestures directed at his brother.  Dramatically taken aback, he shut the door and huffed, “Rude.”
He smirked and massaged the full once waylaid erection curled perfectly into his warm palm.  “And you shall, but you have to do something for me first.”
He perked up from his side of the small circular café table and nearly dropped his mug of black house blend.  “You know about my writing?”
“Just because I don’t want to spend an extra ten minutes a day weeding through your mess of a filing system, doesn’t mean I was jazzed to do it.  Anyway, I want to know what you think about bringing him on as an official employee – like an advisor or something.  We can wait until he has his seed money back with interest before we offer.  I know it’s unconventional, but his generosity with his time and expertise should be compensated.”
Bitterness nakedly painted his countenance.  “That sounds about right.  Anyone else here?”
Sam braced his hands on the edges of the table and nodded at Dean perched uneasily at the end of the nearest book case.  He stared at the ceiling dead ahead of him and cleared his mind.  The concentrated repetition, monitoring of form, balance, and speed during his hours of yoga and endurance running prepared him for channeling a solitary focus into his body. Here we go, he thought.
Dean turned his head, his expression softening the second his eyes locked with Cas’s.  “Took you a bit.  Find me something good?”
He whistled in awe.  “Archangels?  You can ward against something that powerful?”
The weak tremors of his hand made it hard to shave.  He was reasonably sure he washed his hair twice after zoning out mid-shower, too.  Cas didn’t even sneer when they reunited in Purgatory, so the angel giving him the side eye for a couple days of hygiene negligent research binging wasn’t likely.  Now so clean Cas could have eaten off of him, he threw on pair of worn in jeans and a plaid button down at the top of his yet-to-be-folded clean clothes pile and barely waited for Sam to give him the news.
something?”
His eyes darted to the jacket in the corner, already missing the calming texture of its presence.  The lamplight shone over it, exposing the only thing that mattered in that moment.  He may not have his home, his family, or his Dean, but there was a magnificent imitation out there.  Finding him was his all-consuming task.  No matter how battered and bruised, he would find a way to support him and this Sam if they would allow him.  Right then with Sam scrabbling in the hallway calling for Dean to swoop in, it appeared the reverse was just as true.  When the copy appeared to whisk him away all cloak and dagger, guiding him through the maze of the hospital with a careful diligence, it was hardly believable that the pair would risk so much for him after knowing him for such short a time.  They didn’t even really know him and he lacked the ability to explain.  If any trace of his Grace as left, he would use it to find a way; make all of the trust placed in him a worthy investment.
“Can’t have a shootout if you don’t have any bullets,” he agreed and took the last pull from his rancid beer.  God, Ketch had terrible taste.  Was he born with defective taste buds because he was English or because it was Ketch?  He shook his head and motioned for him to continue his intrigue.
By Dean’s guess, his mouthful of seltzer water stung him hearing Sam’s question.  Ultimately mild disgust laced his response.  “Why do you frame it as a scale – the investor being lesser pursuit in some respect than a venture capitalist?”
His scoff dripped with sarcastic reverie.  “Oh ‘dissolved’ it did you?  You merely created another tier, a hierarchy of softheaded snobbery amongst the highest members.  Being ridiculed by my own family for being a step below greatness on top of hiding my ‘defect’ as you call it, isn’t how real family treats each other.”
“Djibouti?” he floated.
He wiped his lip with the tips of his fingers and came away with a dark smudge.  “What the…” His eyes darted back up to Dean approaching him, but his attention drew to below his face.  “What is that?  Is that a camera?”
The angel nodded and clarified, “Yes.  After transporting us and Baby here, I don’t have enough Grace to fix the lights like I would under more accommodating circumstances, so I will bring you to your room and start changing out the bulbs.  Although we only have enough of the new bulbs to replace the ones in the living quarters, there should be enough original ones to replace every fixture many times over.  It shouldn’t take me more than an hour. My apologies, Sam.  My transportation calculations were clearly flawed.”
“Wrote about The People’s Temple and the Children of God.  Fact heavy and a little dry.”
The questions fell out of his mouth one by one as they walked down the hallway peering into various rooms as they passed them by. “How many rooms are there?”
“Hold on, the eggheads who built this state of the art underground mystery lair put so much stock in this harebrained cult’s science project that they were trying to stop them?”
The heavy lidded man stared at him as if analyzing the sound for a secondary meaning.  “Hello, Dean.”
His telltale squint into the middle distance eased, amused by his keen observation.  “Just something my sister said to me the other day.”
“The Men of Letters?” Sam deduced cautiously, like the group’s name was in some bygone language he never studied.
He shrugged, not certain how he’d eventually fit into their ostensibly cemented crew.
His brow scrunched and he sighed with a tang of annoyance.  “This is the last one.”
His recovery left something to be desired, but he tried another tac instead of fixating on it.  Visualizing himself limber up like before a summer run against a stiff breeze, he loosened his focus, let the tether sag.  He resumed his search back and forth down the lanes perusing lagers, imported monastery brewed ales, overly sweet ciders, mass brewed European wheat beers, subtle gins, tongue twisting liquors, and lastly the massive refrigerated wall.  To his delight they restocked a brew he only had the chance to try once and lamented its absence after he drained the last can.  The shop even stocked another beer by the same brewer with a seriously strange psychedelically colored carrier, so he pulled the sets of six into his hands.  He called for Cas’s input one last time.
“I’ll reference my reports from the same time frame and meet you in an hour,” he sent then tucked the phone away.  A crooked finger called the young man back to him.
The memory made him inwardly shake at his own gratuitous bravado. “They were awesome donuts and I bet she finished off her shift that day feeling a lot better than when it started.”
The tether shrunk into nothing before he could reply, so he placed a teary kiss on his forehead.  He gathered their hands together one last time and pressed Cas’s hands to his mouth.  “I can’t…”
Once seated in his car he looked back at the building.
Dean posture stiffened and his ruddy spotted chest blanched.  “What… Can I ask how you got out?  I take it there wasn’t an easily bribable guard…”
“Like it or not, and I really, really don’t like it, but there is a direct through line from the Malkuth to the Bunker and Cas is caught up somewhere in the middle.  His father figure just happens to be the one murdered in our basement.  Then Cas just happens to come work at the business directly over the site of Zachariah’s grisly demise.  Doesn’t pass the sniff test.”
An involuntary moan dribbled out of his lungs, soaking in the care Dean took lavishing him with earnest touches.  The small hairs from his thighs to his ears leapt up when he curled a hand around him for the first time.  Castiel could feel a satisfied hum through the firming nibbles on his tattooed trunk.  Indeed Dean made no effort to thrust or press against him, only to drown him in cyclical waves of tenderness.
“I’m going to get banged up, haggard, and more than likely killed doing this job – this family business of ours,” he waved Sam quiet at the dolorous introjection of his name came.  “But that’s our calling.  I know it wasn’t yours at first, but you, me, and Cas – it’s our family’s business.   Long after I’m useful or you’ve finally gotten tired of hanging around me, Cas will still be here by our,” he paused to correct himself before he knew Sam would, “by my side.  I have to be at peace with that alone.  After he’s saved us so many times and thrown Heaven, his duty, his asshole family to the side, I can’t ask him for anything more than to be our brother.  For the record, he’s never once told me he wants more than that.”
“Could you be any cuter?”  His eyes grew wide and he speed-babbled, “Welp, gotta go.  See you tomorrow, Cas!”
“Can’t say for sure, but with OPR practically doing pirouettes around anyone with a finger in that case, something is clearly up.”
“How about I go get us a drink while we wait, then?” he asked, already shuffling off of his spot beside the flummoxed hunter and stretched to the ceiling.  Upon his descent he caught wooded green eyes crawling up his shirt and down his body absently.  “Beer?” he coaxed.
“Indulge me,” she crossed her arms and egged him on.
Sam fake laughed through a frown.  “His tracks, Dean.  What would he leave in his wake?”
His voice took on a rich density that shook Cas down to his core.  His heart raced knowing even back then he was proud of him.
They chatted for longer enough that the boys started to reconsider the lack of beverages.  Once Jody was reassured that they weren’t there to rip the rug out from under them, she opened up a bit more.  They swapped stories about their kids and thoroughly embarrassing toddler photos.  Donna spoke with saccharine affection about how she met Jody at a police retreat and it was love at first sight.  Jody bore a loving crinkle on her nose as she smiled at her wife as they melted into a quiet moment.  Once again Dean reminded Sam of the time and they excused themselves.  Jody and Donna welcomed them over for dinner whenever they would like and Donna privately invited Dean to bring his daughter along.  She had always wanted a little girl of her own and having one around for even a speck of time would be a treat.  While he was hesitant to let his little one loose around strangers and so much dangerous farm equipment, he relented.  He had a good feeling about the couple and their rambunctious twins still tearing up the grass out front.
Rotating his jaw to the left and staring into the middle distance for a moment, he nodded with satisfaction over his findings.  “It’s a raijyu.  I don’t believe they have gender expression.”
His scowl lifted into a full toothed grin and he grabbed the six packs from him to scan, “I’m just fuckin’ with you, man.  Thanks for stepping in there.”
Hurt cascaded over his features, but his stoic posture told him he was braced for a colossal emotional gut punch.
In more ways that he could count some days, Castiel was a godsend.  “You write more than one book at a time?  That sounds rigorous.”
Just because he was less nervous then he was yesterday, didn’t mean he was any less willing to punch something, anything, to get this tumultuous energy ricocheting inside his body out.  The mock run went swimmingly.  Sam’s turn proceeded without much complication but ended in one hell of a gut punch he was currently sleeping off.  Third time is a charm right?  Or maybe their luck already ran out.  Bah, he cursed at himself.   Can’t be a mole person, he mused, had to get this beastie out so he can move on.  Moving on meant he could leave the bunker, maybe take Cas for a long drive in any direction.  The angel rehashed the changed details of the rite walking down the quiet hallway past Sam’s and his room.  He paid attention the first time he rambled through the list, so this attempt to reassure him faded into the background.  All the while he watched Cas’s lips move and confident smiles play briefly on his soft face.  God, he just wanted to touch him already.
------------------
Amused at the zest Claire brought into their lives and grateful his measures to keep dry exceeded Dean’s, he offered to get her dressed and ready for bed while Dean changed.  Neither of them could afford any days off for a cold after all.  Dean’s sneeze could be heard from across the hall, so Sam took up Dean’s usual post beside her bed and read the picture book from where they bookmarked the night before.  All the raucous Poseidon roleplay must have taken its toll.  Three pages of size 24 font text later, her eyelids slid shut, her light sleep sigh the call the tale for the night to an end.
Dean pulled him up by the shirt and shoved him away from the table.  Keeping his tight grip on his shirt collar he advanced, maneuvering his taller counterpart towards the wall.  His back slammed against the it with a thick thud and he shook his face to the side, expecting to defend himself from an onslaught of furious fists, “Just talk to me, Dean!”
“Once in a lifetime bad from what I can tell.  Benny, his ex-partner that works at one of the bars we use to go to, told me he still comes in occasionally.  Drinks himself stupid and doesn’t talk to anyone but him.  I swear he’s more comfortable there than he is at home.  Probably spent more time there.  Benny didn’t give me many details either, but he’s under no obligation to.”
He could hear the well-earned guffaw an hour away from the bureau’s basement.  Three bouncing bubbles danced in the bottom left hand corner of his screen.  As she furiously taped in search of a meme to show him how obtuse he was being at that moment, he clicked back on the other window to scan the document for any more information.  Details, paper type, shadows, printer markers, highlighting, coffee mug rings, anything could have been something to go off of.  He toggled back through his e-mail for a similar document and compared the two; same form, same jurisdiction, all the same info.   The ribbing message blinked and he opened it to find a gif of a swirling black hole.  “You could have just called me an idiot.  It would have felt the same,” he messaged her back.
“Do the others know about this place?”
He nodded and pulled his hand away to let Cas crawl across the mattress toward the left side where he laid the night before.  Disrobing and replacing his jeans with sleeping pants felt loaded as Dean watched his every move through darting gazes.  He pulled down the comforter and sheets to climb in but lifted them to invite Dean to rest beside him.  They had novels of questions to ask each other, but Cas’s vessel insisted they do it in the dark with closed eyes, taking as little energy as he could spare.  A staggered exhale sputtered from Dean, and he nodded, removing his jeans and plaid to get comfortable enough for bed.  Dean flicked off the lamp and sat down tentatively.  After feeling the blanket rest upon him again, he scooted closer to Cas, but not against his skin.  Nervous energy projected uncontrollably off of him.  By recapturing Dean’s hand with his between their still matchstick forms, Cas attempted to sooth his rustled nerves.  They lie on their backs and stared at his ceiling soaking in the caress of each other’s fingers.  Looking at each other revealed too much, invited too much opportunity for literal sparks.  Once the comforter settled and only the sound of their breathing echoed in the room Cas continued, “It feels like it’s calming down again.  May I ask you something else?”
Sam and Charlie let a long pause fill in Dean’s inevitable question.  In the short time since they met Charlie through Benny, she took it upon herself to help the boys find their footing by inserting every one of her technical talents into the brewery’s many open ports.  At first it was just to lessen the amount of fruitless after hours complaining Benny hurled into the fajita sizzle soaked air at the Roadhouse.  Two or so long islands later, she wiggled her way into their hearts, taking up arms to defend their small business from cybercrimes, establish a more modern web presence, and conjure up trite bottle labels with half naked lady doodles.  She knew people and she knew things, all of which she would utilize at the drop of a hat at their behest.  In his experience, her ‘less traditional digging’ could only mean one thing.
The agent grabbed his newly freed hand and pulled him down the short length of hall.  The stranger dropped his gown into the garment bin outside the door as they passed.  They sped to the end of the hall in lock step, but Dean stopped them at the top of the stairwell out of view of the hallway to when he heard familiar voices argued as they stomped down in their direction. A nurse attempted to shush them, but a harsh command in a British accent silenced the two around it.  Dean took that as his cue to pull the wrist in his grasp with him down the stairs in a hurried descent.  As they reached the ground floor he repeated his instruction to walk, not run in a whispered tone.  Hospital employees around paid them no heed as the stranger walked beside Dean with stiff, pained steps through the side door.  No words were exchanged as Dean made a bee line for his sensible work sedan, opening the back passenger side door for the stranger.  Looking bewildered, he sat down and buckled himself in.  The agent cast a searching gaze around the parking lot to see if anyone had followed them, but came up empty.  There was a risk letting this stranger in behind him if he were mentally unsound, but nothing about this man had come across as threatening as of yet.  Even if he wasn’t an international incident waiting to happen, there was still the possibility he would run.  After all, for all intents and purposes the FBI was basically holding him against his will without filing any official charges.  Until he heard from Sam, he would have to stay mobile and keep the stranger as calm as possible.  Sliding into the driver’s seat, he thought about what calmed him down after the most stressful days.  In the rear view mirror, the stranger was staring down at his lap.  If he was plotting an escape he would he looking down the street, at the lock on the car door, not at his lap.  Dean hid a relieved grin and started the ignition.
Real trepidation chugged up from his tailbone through the top of his head.  The urge for flight danced upwards from his toenails.  “Don’t.  You.  Dare.  See you this afternoon.”
He shook his head obstinately.  Although he held onto Cas’s firmly, his consternation pulled him out of his grasp.  “It wasn’t enough.”
“Save it, Sam.  It’s gonna be fine.  You, Mick, Cas, and I are gonna be hitting the town on double dates in no time.  You’ll see,” he forced a smile.
Falling to a much more serious tone at the thought of their mortal peril, Dean confirmed, “We were hit by Raijin, trying to get his runaway kids back?  That firework show we got caught up in wasn’t a just a freaky house fire, then.”
“We have to come up with $120 grand in three weeks or we lose Bobby’s house?  I lose Claire’s new home?  Am I hearing that right?” he demanded clarification gruffly.
“I tried.  The next day, he just texted that he was okay.  He wouldn’t answer any of my calls to either one of his phones.  I showed up at his house a couple of times after I heard he had been reassigned, but his car was never there.   They stuck him in a basement office down the corridor from IT, but he’s never answered that phone or been in his office when I visited.  Caught him in the elevator once; seemed very off-key. There were other agents around so I couldn’t outright ask him the details of his boyfriend’s disappearance.  Pileggi has been sparse on the details, too.”
he grumped internally.  “It didn’t just appear, honey.  Cas put it in your bag while you weren’t looking.”
“I don’t know yet.”  He reluctantly sat on Sam’s abandoned kitchen stool.  Those same knuckles brushed back and forth against his lips in contemplation.
Stern palms kept him still even after his will to fight waned.  “Dean, you’re not…”
he murmured with twinges of self-consciousness playing chopsticks across his gut.  He turned the corner and spied the neon sign for the shop in the middle distance
He huffed out the first genuine laugh he had in months.  “Sure.  Will do, Charlie.”
“Yeah, thanks,” he huffed.  “One last thing though, was Mr. Novak religious?”  The people listening in would think it non-sequitur at best if it ever came up.  Thinking on his Vulcan mind meld with Castiel, he had to know if this world’s version of his “vessel” had similar predispositions.  If his inner armchair philosopher had posited correctly, this universe had proved to be different enough from whatever one Castiel fell out of to merit Cas’s pointing them out, but how much was the same?
There was a pause like Sam was suppressing a cough.  When he spoke up, he climbed back up from a deeper vocal register.  “The Men of Letters wrote about them, Dean.  I’d have to look at my notes, but I found a box of files labeled ‘Malkuth’ some weeks back.”
“Ha…How are you…doing that?” he asked forcefully, returning to his theory that his drink had indeed been tampered with.  When no immediate answer came, his butt found its place on the warm uncomfortable kitchenette chair.  Once he settled again, the top hand fell away from the back of his.  He forced himself to relax as much as he could to return his eyes to the pair magnetically attracting his upwards.
Then his phone vibrated against his thigh.  “Son of a bitch,” he whined digging the cursed boner killer out of his borrowed pants.  “I gotta take this.”
“Absolutely not.  You make a delicious steak sometimes as well,” he teased, a smidgen of mirth rebounding in his stoic features.
With his mojo back, he could go anywhere but desperately wanted to plant shrubs and ferns on the small plot of land the house he grew to call home was erected upon.  At the end of the day, was this his fault – a self-inflicted wound he knew better than to carve into himself?  After the night they just shared, did he really want to go back?  If he was as honest with himself as he was with the agent earlier in the evening it was more of a debate than he led on.  If he hadn’t found the necklace, Dean’s necklace so close all this time, there was little doubt he would stay put – get to know this Dean better than he knew himself, become friends with Sam again, create a new family.  His thumb rubbed miniscule circles into his dewy ridges between his ribs.  Even in his dream, Dean curled into it, unabashed in his surrender to the feeling.  Outside of the link, he let out a little snore.  Castiel smiled, continuing the caress long after his thoughts pulled him back to the present both there and in a world billions of miles away.
Several minutes ticked by as Cas poured attention over him, layering him in tiny nips at his inner thighs when his breath grew too quick, leaking pleased affirmations when he breached his quivering rim, kissing his hip bones as he gathered more lube, absently kissing his twitching cockhead as it gathered resolve for another go.  After an antsy eternity, Dean was at half-mast with three fingers stretching him.  Each circular glide across his inner sparkstone sent him keening.  “Get on with it.”
“Guess we’ll have to watch in my room then.  I may not have a full sized couch in there, but I have a wicked comfortable memory foam mattress.”
“Every damn day,” he sighed turning the van onto a neglected country road.
Mick eventually sat a foot away and fiddled with his thumbnails.  “They have another contact in Bureau.”
Leaning over the sink, he looked over his disheveled hair, slightly baggy shirts, and worry lines.  He had a simple choice: somehow survive the next two weeks hoping to dig himself out from such a miserable first morning or excuse himself until the weekend when he could deal with the less standoffish Winchester.  He couldn’t remember the last time had he been so easily sent off kilter.
Accusatory squints seeped from his face.  “So, what, you want me to play dress up while I play therapist?”  He dropped the costume back onto the stack and tightly crossed his arms over his chest.  “Nuh uh.”
When Baby’s preemptive oil change was finished and his supplies found their way back into the tool chest meticulously organized in order of size and purpose, he washed up and headed over to the Mills farm to inspect the Comet crops.  On the drive over, he spotted Efram and Jonah taking a break from the scorching high noon sun on their porch and waved out the window.  Jonah smiled but Efram nodded blankly.  Since their first meeting, he had yet to land a foot in his good graces.
A new hunger boiled up from Dean’s middle as he watched Cas take himself in hand and pump into it dutifully.  Dean licked his lips and kissed across his chest, running his textured taste buds around his areolas softly.  Another groan ratcheted from Cas and Dean knew he wouldn’t be able to take much more supplementary instruction.  One small mewl to the angel’s lips was all the payment he could give for such noble self-pleasure.  He sat back up and pushed Cas’s hand away.  Lining himself above the mighty dick below him ended up being more of a task than he imagined, his thighs quivering slightly from holding himself up so high.  The broad head brushed his hole and he spread himself open with one hand while guiding his weight down steadily.  Cas’s eyes went even wider as he ever so slowly encased his member in sweet heat and delicious pressure.  Dean wasn’t one to enjoy the burn, but Cas’s impressive length didn’t give him much of a choice in the matter.  By the riveting full feeling and the slack jawed flush expression on his angel’s face, neither one of them were going to last long.  The girth poised above Cas’s stomach didn’t disagree.
Once back at the mouth of the long hallway, he ducked against the tiled wall and listened for any movement.   The treacherous hand of his watch warned him thirty three of the allotted thirty five minutes had passed.  He dimmed his flashlight to a quarter of its full power.  Like a crack of thunder against a starless sky, a resounding scrape and swing sounded out above him and to the left.  His fingers scrambled to turn his flashlight completely off and he tip toed into the closest room, a bedroom if he remembered the building plans correctly.  Its minimalist furniture gave him little choice in refuge in case the person now coughing at the top of the stairs chose to investigate the room further.  Immediately behind the door seemed like a good choice, so he crouched down under the sink to his left and struggled to slow his rapid breaths through his makeshift mask. The chalky bones shifted in the bag defiantly as if to punish him for disturbing them in the first place.  The sweat collecting at his palms and the bottoms of his feet chilled him in contrast with his hammering heart, all body heat crawling out from his torso.  Those elastic limbs pulsating with adrenaline, cried for a quick exit, but his even temperament held him flush against the wall, keen on making it out unharmed and unnoticed.  With his ear tilted towards the perforated grate at the bottom of the door, he strained to hear footsteps bounding down the stairwell and shuffling across the initial circular room.  Each unsure step pounded closer to his clumsy hiding spot.
The room itself wasn’t all that large, but the space to house a computer and its desk didn’t have to be.  A small lamp illuminated the surface of the desk, but the rest of the room was darker than the rest of the house.  Once they were both inside, Cas closed the door behind them.  The scant light from the lamp diminished against the dark at all sides.  Even the ceiling above was painted a rich navy which unnerved him to think about if only for the sake of the apparently unstable interior designer.  The restlessness snaking around his spine ratcheted him into full alertness. Before he could question why they were still standing around in the dark, Cas flicked on the light.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’ll be drunk when he gets back, so we both know the answer to the question of what he’ll do tonight,” he tentatively engaged. “He does notice the small things eventually, Cas. Even if he doesn’t say it…”
Once stationed with Damascus style steak knives he found in what looked like a long intricately stained wooden cigar box, he poured them both more wine.  The cab was getting awfully friendly awfully quick.
As he came down, Cas pushed him backwards onto the bed a few inches from his knees and littered kisses from his overly sensitive stomach up his left clavicle.  A felicitous hum resonated throughout his body.  Try as he might, he couldn’t transfer it to the gorgeous man at his side even through their drawn out teasing kisses.
Dean’s palm came up to cover his quickly reddening face.  “Cas, man.  You can’t say stuff like that.”
“Hey,” he sat upright quickly.  “Now you’re just being a dick.”
He exhaled deeply at the ceiling in frustration.  “An archangel feather?  They keep their wings in another plane of existence.  How are we supposed to…” He stalled out halfway through staring into the far distance.  His pointer finger bounced in Sam’s direction as his grimace flipped into an elated grin.  “I got it.  We can kill two birds with one stone.”
“Surely you write under a pen name, keep your information guarded,” the younger Winchester surmised.
The open floor plan kitchen left them open to discovery, but Dean hoped their efforts to remain silent would give them the upper hand.  No one was in the kitchen so they moved forward to the living room with their guns drawn.  Clearing each room with a hand gesture they swept up to the last room on the left.  After years of infiltrations and breach and clear ops, Dean was prepared to walk into almost anything.  As he side-stepped into the living room, Davies eyes barely flickered up as he came into view.  Exhaustion and radiated terror filled the far side of the living room where he sat handcuffed to the arms of a chair holding something between his shaking knees.  The other familiar mop swayed in the chair opposite Davies closest to them on the left as they entered.  They both pointed their guns at his head, but Davies gave them a purposeful grimace to dissuade them.  Unfortunately it also drew unwanted attention.  As they stepped into full view, Ketch huffed assuredly, swirling a metal ring around his pointer finger.
“I was thinking more of ingredients for vegetarian lasagna.”
Cas hummed at him as if deep between thoughts galaxies apart.  Covering the distance with a handful of human shaped words felt impossible.  Fleeting static pivoted beneath his fingers and Dean’s, insisting the danger always present between them was indeed real.  Gravity pulled a majority of shared joy from him, but he held on tightly, bringing Dean’s fingertips to his lips.  Dean blinked and his breathing slowed.  “The raijyu in you is shifting and I need rest.  Will you lay with me for a while?”
“Is that all?” he smirked.
His snort went unnoticed by his brother, but startled Cas mildly out of his solitary focus on his Righteous Man.  The moose of a man blushed and covered his mouth at first.  The angel gave a quarter smile filled with distilled contentment and nodded at him, a wordless gesture of gratitude Sam didn’t feel he even deserved, but accepted nonetheless.  He returned the nod and walked back to the kitchen, calculating how loud of a movie to watch with the door closed later that evening.  Maybe it was a Die Hard evening – Ooooh, or a Russian horror sci-fi movie night.  What was the name of that movie series he likes again?  Oh well, tasty salads weren’t going to make themselves, he thought.
Charlie sidled up next to Jo and whispered in her ear, “You’re her favorite, you know that?”
She shook her head and started leading him down the hall.
He couldn’t help but introject, “Yeah, I thought only you would be so excited about such a dull chore.”
The low humble of a familiar voice echoed hushed responses in the hallway.  Various footfalls rang out but they all slushed into the oppressive agent’s ears just the same.  Cas on the other hand was listening.  The slick slap of flat soled loafers skated softly behind the cracked door.  Familiar eyes darted through the door’s small observation window.  Just as quickly as they identified both people in the room he nodded to Cas and dashed off again.  Maybe he wasn’t alone after all.
“You’re kind of a badass.”
When Castiel gazed down he caught his lax counterpart’s irises flickering to and from the empty hand on his belly.  The bitter tang of disappointment gathered at the back of his throat like a sour ale.  He warred to swallow the feeling down and hoped to overcome what a handful of very short term relationships couldn’t weather.
They gave each other searching looks before staring at him blankly.
Remembering the burning embers of the Easton farmhouse, Dean swore he could have smelled the smoke; felt the soot caked on his hands. He ran them over the steering wheel half expecting to feel its grit between his fingers.  Although the White Creek mission failed in almost every way, he couldn’t shift blame for the Easton job squarely to the other team’s previous failure.  Neither one of them were prepared for witches gone wild.  Before they headed out of White Creek, Don and Chet insisted they had everything they needed for interrogation and magical barbeque right in the witch’s house.  Lana and Reggie were more inclined to leave as soon as possible, not tempted in any capacity to stay in the 150 year old colonial an extra minute.  Sam packed their weapons back into the trunk of the Impala and stretched his long arms over the hood.  Trekking over with his own armful of left over herbs the girls shoved on him, he recognized the unrest in Sam’s eyes.  The brothers spoke over the hood of the Impala, after making they had parked far enough away to have a private pow wow.  “Just say it Sammy,” he tossed his supplies into the back seat, knowing his personal goliath had a few bones to pick.
The Mills swung by the brewery a couple of times to speak with the Winchesters, but Castiel had never been formally introduced which made his showing up at their early summer barbeque awkward.  The homemade macarons lined up on an oval plastic wrapped serving plate on his passenger seat were overkill, but he wanted to make a good impression.  After all, most of the brewery staff would be there with their significant others and their children in tow.  There was no faster way to be ostracized than making an asshat of oneself as a foolish work party centerpiece.  He looked himself over in the rearview mirror.  The July air was decidedly hot and humid, so he dressed down from his day job attire, but remained a step above his Salvage duds.   Sweat was inevitable, but not level of to running a decathlon while holding a 24-pack as he had endured in the stuffy warehouse before a mid-summer storm broke.  With the colorful macarons in hand, he headed towards the cream white farmhouse’s front door.
“Lisa never wrote down the father’s name on Claire’s birth certificate and had no other living family.  I got temporary custody and a year later, it was made official.”
He tilted forward, regaining his footing to casually flirt and added, “Show me this kitchen of yours.”
.  He stepped over the treacherous lump to help Dean to his feet.
A versed eye roll crested over Cas’s face despite a measured smile neutralizing its venom.  “Well, in our first encounter, or shall I call it ‘track one’, I gripped us in one hand and stroked us into orgasm,” he recalled as if he were reciting a quick run grocery list.   “Track two through seven or so, we held each other close and used his various toys which was quite a lot of fun.  Around track eight, he led me to the brink with his talented mouth.  Then in track nine, he taught me the immense delights of anal sex with a side of teacher roleplay.  We made sure he was prepped thoroughly and endured no discomfort.  It was all very… informative.”
He punted his Brussel sprout to the other side of his plate trying to detangle what he was referencing.
“Hey, hey.  You’ve got Sam to talk about carbon emissions of locally sourced corn or whatever with.  So what do you have planned today?  Plannin’ on tickey typin’ the day away again or can I drag you out of your den for a few hours?”
“Onward, then,” Sam conceded and followed her down the steps to the converted storage room across from the room they once found bloody bedclothes that heralded an unforeseen sea change in the williwaw of their lives.
“It’s more akin to a blind spot.  An angel could transport themselves anywhere in space in the blink of an eye.  This infinitesimally area just wouldn’t be on their radar.  According to the literature they aren’t naturally curious creatures so such a tiny omission from the accessible globe at large would hardly be noteworthy.”
“It’s the signed statement of my offense.  My personal attorney reviewed it and strong advised me to throw it into a fire.”
The news heralded some minor defeat on Dean’s face until Castiel added, “She’s in her sixties and she can’t run that far now that she just had two hip replacement surgeries.  Most mornings it’s less of a run and more of a powerwalk.  If she’s feeling particularly sturdy, I don’t get my individual run time in until seven fifteen.”
“You think you’re funny, but the less numbers I give you, the more randos you have to dial to get to me,” he smirked menacingly.
What you think Cas's other book series is about?
He smirked, knowing what he didn’t understand just further demonstrated the agent’s annoyance versus being pivotal to proving a point.
Cas’s heart sank listening to the agent.  In no universe could the Winchester escape front row seats to the tragedy and the depravity of their fellow man.  Finding any silver lining felt like a heartless self-soothing measure.  While he wished he could speak back to them, he only had the motor skills at his disposal, so he tried to comfort Sam the best he could.  His free hand found the agent’s outstretched hand hanging off of his knee at the bound angel.  Sam pulled back a fraction at first, a telling vulnerability playing off of his brow.  When Cas didn’t retract his hand and gave him a considered smile, Sam returned the smile meekly.  “Thanks, I guess.”
“That’s enough, Charlie,” Sam quashed her efforts softly.  “I’ve got it from here.”
Dean looked down at his chest to see two blue points of light beneath his shirt.  “No, that’s…”
“Born in Maryland, sibling by the name of Michael died about two years ago, about six feet tall,” he rattled off, looking anywhere but at the bobbing red head in front of him.  If she caught the expression on his face, it would be all over.  She’d have him dead to rights.  “It’s not a time sensitive matter so if you…”
Dean cautiously slid past Ketch’s open office door to see his favorite redhead had done more than her fair share keeping him busy.  Careful not to miss a beat, he dove right into his casework on three other active cases.  It wasn’t often he had an entire day in his office to catch up.  Forgoing his hour on the treadmill before lunch, he would be able to clear out at least one of the cases that refused to fall off his plate no matter how little progress could be made on any other day.  Luckily some helpful citizen called in with an easily verifiable tip that de-clogged the bureaucratic machine he worked within.  One case down, he barely noticed Ketch trudge back into his office carrying his laptop with a disgruntled lurch.  His partner must not have noticed his absence at all as he did not check on his partner by four-thirty when Dean hung up with an officer first to the scene of one of his most recent suspicious homicide cases.  If it wasn’t for the mob’s freakishly elastic imagination working with the pointy objects and inelastic flesh medium, Dean would have more abstract nightmares but a less interesting day-to-day.
“Sam, same coordinates.  Now.  Ketch…” he whispered. An M9 Glock cocked in the background in reply.  Shuffling noises drowned out voices before the line died.  Sam looked at the phone for a moment then up as Dean, all higher ground pulled out from under him like a cartoon rug.
Thinking back on how this all began, he had to laugh inwardly.  In a cleansing witching hour heart to heart shortly after he moved back to Kansas, his tenacious red headed best friend scraped the secrets of his family from his white knuckled grip.  At last he could trust another person with the reason why he came to the town at the dead center of the country without a job or family to cite.  Hell, she even helped him find more information about the Men of Letters once she knew, but he never told her exactly where the bunker was once he connected the dots.  The enormous trust she placed in him to watch him endlessly push that boulder uphill and not interfere when its weight attempted to crush him was paramount to completing the task Naomi asked of him.  Now it was done, he could see in Dean’s eyes, this ask was the same for him, though the aim was worlds more pure-hearted.
“I don’t want to reveal anything said to me in confidence, Anna.  I
In his absence he had only pushed past his clenched fist a handful of times, mainly to settle his urges more than he wanted to sing broken curses to his room’s grey ceiling in sympathetic reverie remembering Cas’s adept intimate touch.  He had no want for it without those tidal blues staring holes right into his soul as neon white pleasures pulsed out of him wildly.  Now having gone so long without them, he chased his orgasm too hastily.  Already he regretted they couldn’t take their time, make this the long awaited occasion he gave himself over completely to Cas’s tender exploratory touch.  The frenetic chaos of sensuous stimuli had him almost cresting when he caught a glimpse of his lust ravaged love thrusting all the way into him for the first time in his mind’s eye.  With that fullness, that sheer unflappable unity of their whole beings, he came hard over the top of Cas’s agile grip.  Four slippery pumps against Dean’s spill later Cas tensed over him, painting Dean’s torso with his own spend in erratic pulses. It may not have been the soul searing coalescence he sought, but it cemented them back into one time, one place amongst all the worlds and all their possibilities.  Even before his breathing evened out, he reclaimed Dean’s slippery lips to scatter open mouthed kisses across them blissfully.  With labored breaths, he leaned up greedily to return his affections, searching the texture of his mouth for adequate words of praise.  Inspiration never struck, but tried in vain until they needed to part for air.
Early August rarely afforded them temperate evenings, but a cool wind whipped up his back.  Besides the swirling pastiche of worries keeping him off kilter, the gust reminded him how out of his element he was.  The manicured walkup to a boxy suburban home was the last place one would usually find a wandering Winchester.   The backlit upstairs shutters indicated a higher likelihood of someone being awake in the quaint cookie cutter house.  No matter how nerve wracking that possibility was, be took the last couple of paces onto the blank doormat and knocked.  “Fuck,” he exhaled and stepped back far enough for someone to see him through the nonexistent peephole in the door.
“It’s gonna have to be, Red.”
His archaic words confused him, but pushing him for answers seemed over the line.   Only knowing each other for week, another attempt at a heart-to-heart at that point would be pushing his luck.  “Of course.”
“Being hot as fuck is a universal currency,” he smiled obnoxiously wide.
Before he could object, Dean was halfway down the stairs with another bear claw in tow.  From the large window overlooking the main floor, Castiel watched him saunter past the bottling line into a set of swinging doors.  From what he remembered of the layout of the property, he guessed he was headed into the warehouse where some shirts printed with the brewery’s logo were probably tucked away in a box along its many shelves.  A few minutes later, Dean reappeared with a smattering of sweat on his brow.  A plain black shirt, a pair of jeans with a thread bare knee, and a plaid landed in a pile on the desk in front of him.  “I don’t know if we wear the same size shoe, but I could see if any of the guys have a spare pair for you.”
A thoroughly rankled Winchester burst through the swinging ‘out’ door, nearly barreling over them both.  Castiel yanked the empty hand truck backwards in attempt to spare Dean’s shins from ramming into the thin metal plate facing out.  At the last moment, Dean tottered off to the side to avoid it barely remaining on his feet as he compensated. “Watch it!”
Dean rolled his eyes and ran his nails over his scalp anxiously. “Laying that aside, we have a more immediate problem.”
“Didn’t anyone ask questions?  The report said Krycek’s body was found in the raid.  So it was you two that set him on fire during the raid to obfuscate his real cause of death?” Sam pieced together out loud.
“Woah, what did the wheelie-majig do to you?” his brother asked more amused than concerned.  Just in case, he drew his arms up to block the cart in case any sudden movements would draw his ire.  It wouldn’t be the first time one of Dean’s moods doled out welts of collateral damage.
His bottom eyelid twitched, annoyed that this diminutive name affected him as it did.  A passive frown twisted up at the corner of his lips in thought.
A tentative smile cast over Dean’s lips as he watched every little movement against his skin.  “God, Cas, you have to know how much I’ve been dying to fuck you in that get up this past week.” His eyes were wide with arousal, taking in every little detail of Cas’s temporary skin.  A delicate moan squeaked past his open lips as Cas took one of his digits into his mouth.  “I jacked it twice imagining those hands getting me off that last day you were gone.  You’re so freaking hot, Cas.”
He pushed his long bangs back behind his ear in vain.  His haircut a few days ago left them on the wrong side of short failing to lay obediently behind his ears when he swept them back.  Trying to fill the discontented emptiness Dean left in his wake, he shifted his chair and repositioned himself over the same page he turned to before Dean blew into the library itching for a familiar and unchallenging chase.  Over the past few bunker bound days, Dean said it felt like ages since they took Baby out to a salty smelling coast or an unfamiliar corn rowed town.  Undoubtedly he was searching for the right kind of distraction: preferable diminutive, blonde, athletic, and hell, with a copious amount of bouncy curls he could imagine drowning in.  When egging Sam on didn’t produce even an annoyed glance his way, Dean flicked his gaze over the piles of spell books, reference folders, and mangled personal journals from some Men of Letters found in the secondary storage room they had yet to fully organize.  The angel’s pile of books outnumbered Sam’s, but it didn’t keep him from looking equally as unilluminated by what he was taking in.  His eyes upturned in Dean’s direction as the hunter side-stepped to kneel beside his studious silence.  Cas sailed a Dean-patented, tried, and true verbal jab awkwardly across the table at Sam over Dean’s shoulder.  Upon failing to shake the utterly immobile boulder of Sam’s concentration and willful overlooking of his chicanery by angelic proxy, Dean swiftly moved to the idea of greener pastures – these pastures being an outdoor cantina he had grown fond of over the past few months.  They had excellent tacos, Sam had to agree, but he knew what Dean was really on the hunt for, as did Cas.
The Winchesters vanished into the front entrance.
He smirked.  “Did all that honesty get you set up with some top secret division?”
Sam rubbed his forehead and harrumphed.  At least his sense of humor was in one piece.
Dean cleared his throat and put a hand on the back of Charlie’s chair to swirl her back in the direction of her screen.  “Let me know what you find.  I gotta…”
“Krycek case follow-up, mostly.  I’ve only worked with her on a case once, but I know how she interrogates people, pulls the info out of them with niceties before going in hard.   She interrogated me about the Fowler case, the Seneca Falls case, and lastly…”
“I see.  But, he stayed with me for over a year.  It was… trying. We squatted in abandoned houses and ate out of dumpsters for months.”  Huffs of amusement interspersed between his bewildered squints. “He dubbed us ‘Expatriated Freegans’.  I don’t remember him mentioning them more than a handful of times.  If they were so in love, why didn’t he return sooner?  Why didn’t he tell me what he had given them up to remain by my side?”
Cas grew rigid for a beat then relaxed into a less tangled posture and an eerily practiced explanatory tone.
The density of their bond tripled in the diminishing light.  Cas folded back onto Dean’s chest and breathed heavily for a couple of measures.  Lips parted and closed as if he tried to reply in a more natural way against his bare skin.  Dean felt droplets of moisture but couldn’t tell which part of Cas’s face they came from.  After having Cas’s other bodily fluids on him shortly before, he couldn’t have minded which ones they were anyway.
, he berated himself.
This didn’t parse with the smooth talking boxer dropper Charlie described.  In their interactions so far, Dean had been reserved with his words, shy at advances, yet ready and able to assist others.  The clothes on his back were testament to this instinctual reaction.
A familiar head of raven hair sprinkled with salty strands popped up from behind a stalled out tractor halfway across the field.  She looked down over greasy parts laid out over a grubby red cloth by her muck smudged boots then sneered at the innards of her finicky domestic tractor.  “What the hell is your problem now?”
The bulb above his head lit up in response.  “Like those inspected by labels you find in consumer products; you wouldn’t care if you got something inspected by inspector A or B.”
Dean listened to the sound of her drowsy breathing outside the door for a moment, gauging the danger of another half formed question, and then shut the door.  A stiff drink sounded like just the remedy for Claire kicking his heart right off a cliff of unintentionally obliviousness.  As one foot fell down the stairs then the other, his sorrow circled the drain at the same pace.  God, he wished Bobby would just walk through that door and right the ship, cancel out the spiraling whirlpool his death tossed their lives into with his curious brand of calming temperament.  The now dreary kitchen cabinets housing his forgotten whiskey reserves felt miles away when his foot hit the landing.  Cloudy green eyes zeroed in on the amber bottle’s position, but he couldn’t force his feet to drag his lead filled heart that far.  Instead, his back hit the miserable threadbare couch he dreamed of replacing and a sky of stygian loneliness overcame him.  Nocturnal insects sang under the stars outside, but he was long asleep before their tenor could annoy him into closing the windows.
===============
So what other explanation could there be?  His gut told him he was not active military, active super hero, or demi-god capable of falling that fast on a collision course with public park property and surviving.  An errant thought came to him and he had to stop himself from cackling out loud at it.  But was it so off base?  Was such impossibility even worth entertaining?  The glassy surface of his phone found its way into his hands before he could stop is hands from summoning the only voice of reason he could bounce the idea off of.
Mick sat closer, letting their knees knock for the first time.  His cold hand found Sam’s drawing his focus up to his stunningly handsome slight face.  “Thank you, Sam.  I know you can’t fully trust me because of well… what I had to do.  This new page of my life, I want it to be clean, clear of any misunderstandings.  From here on out, I promise not to lie to you or mislead you.  Please just,” he paused to place his palm on Sam’s cheek, to still his twitching irises.  “Let me prove I deserve you this time.”
She leaned back on her swivel chair and clicked her stylus in thought.  “I’m sure we aren’t supposed to know.”
The agent leaned over the kitchen island and exhaled tiredly.  This particular agent was never one to pull out his shirt tails or the like to ease himself out of the job.  Looking the part was playing the part and playing the part left for very little time off.  “I would love to say it’s a social call…”
Her straightened hair shifted as she tilted her head, asking a question with her eyes that dared not pass from her lips.  “No one that would interest you.  Uriel and the other elders departed at dawn for the funeral rites leaving just the ones who joined after you… moved away.”
Out of sheer habit, he was reminded that time passed especially quickly on days off.   He glanced over to the side table where his phone illuminated the near pitch back bedroom.  Even though his companion proved champion at sleep sporadically during the day, his diligently programmed wiring foisted him into full consciousness mid-morning even when days off were overdue.  To dig through his friend’s mind that early by coaxing a link would have been asking for trouble, so he settled on lugging him into the world of the living by petting his bangs away from his forehead and humming into the newly exposed skin.  When a few bars of an old melody proved inadequate to draw him out, he kissed his forehead and lightly carded his short fingernails through his wavy locks.   Cas stubbornly buried himself into Dean’s embrace further, deftly ignoring the agent’s wheedling.  By drawing his loose arm to rest near his face on the agent’s chest and delicately huffing his bone-tired dismay, the agent knew he would lose this game of tug of sleep unless he brought out the big guns.  Not that being snuggled into by the most endearing man he’s ever met was any sort of defeat.  He grazed his front teeth lightly over his forehead and made voracious biting noises as softly as he could.  A plump cheek pressed into his pec, but nary a sliver of blue peeked out from between his dark eyelashes.  A’right, you asked for it, he cajoled.  With his free hand, he struck a flurry of skittering touches up and down Cas’s side.  To his chagrin his efforts barely earned him a defensive wince let alone a full throated laugh.  He snorted with an even mixture of annoyance and amusement.  He licked his bottom lip and squinted at the obstinate man against him.  “Come on, sleepyhead,” he huffed into his forehead.  “I’ll make you coffee,” he cooed and ran his nails over his shoulder blades lightly.  Cas opened one eye begrudgingly, but once his iris widened enough to make out the grin above him, he closed it again.  “No fair, man.  Being fucking adorable first thing in the morning isn’t going to save you from daylight forever.”
The first salty taco went down his gullet without much issue, but the spice appeared to be cumulative.  Half a taco later, he halted chewing mid-bite and froze, like Sam had transformed into a T-rex that only saw him if he sweated out of embarrassment or discomfort.  Catching the look, Sam placed his beer back down on the waxy table cover and laid his palms flat on its surface, hunched over and primed to whole body laugh the millisecond Dean went for his drink to quell the burn.  Losing meant eating one of Sam’s nutrifreak salads the next day, and Dean refused to take the knee to a leafy green.  Trying on one of his dorkiest FBI smiles, he swallowed the infernal mouthful and put his hands under the table to hide his white knuckles.  Sam’s eyes remained magnetized to his now perspiring brows, his throat holding back a chockful incinerator’s belch.  In a moment of sweat drenched desperation, he tore off to the bathroom chased by Sam shouting, “You better not drink out of the sink!”  He won the bet on a technicality, but Sam saw it as a standing bet from then on.
Dean raised his head like a starving pigeon to peer over his brother and take in the grub riddled terrain.  “So how’s this contraption work exactly, Cas?  Will we have an everlasting youkai battery after this?”
He recognized it as the vacant door the Men of Letters journals were moved into then out of again.  Inklings of déjà vu itched at the back of his mind.  He scratched to find out how or why as Cas opened the door.  Just like in Sam’s ritual, there were candles lit in an imperfect circle, the glass trap jar, and an audio device.  All the outlets and smoke detectors were blockaded or had their power sources removed.  For Dean’s turn there was only a stripped bed in the center of the bed instead of a table, a full sized tape recorder like the first one his father bought him, and a more casually dressed angel, barefoot and beautiful.  The loose Henley and worn in jeans Dean told him to toss ages ago tipped his memory to strung-out hippy Cas from Zachariah’s hellscape pocket universe. The memory made him unzip a toothy grin.  His Cas was incredibly unlikely to experiment with a litany of drugs or have spiritual-adjacent orgies, but if this thing ended in anything less than a ‘boom’, maybe he could convince him to chill out more regularly and eventually engage in a ménage a deux.
,” he bit down on each descriptor like it bit him first.  “God, you don’t even know how awesome you are.  Save some of those secret agent vibes for the rest of us.”
The kindness in her crinkled smile left him without words, so he nodded goodbye.  He collapsed back in his chair, mentally regurgitating the info hurled at him.  If they were scrutinizing the Krycek case so thoroughly after its masterminds were caught or killed, there must be other mechanisms still in play.  It couldn’t have been a coincidence that Hanscum’s next stop was his partner’s office.  She wasn’t going to interrogate him in his office alone.  It’s like she wanted him to know he was being set alight under a microscope, to force him to spasm out in fear: make an incriminating phone call or send a compromising e-mail.
The whirling disc kept his focus.  “Some songs, some singers, even fragments reminded me of songs I knew from here.  Others were completely new.  The concept was incredibly irritating at first, but it helped with listening comprehension.”
“My ill-fated little building is just a side project anyway.  Something tells me our show wasn’t the only thing that brought you here tonight, Dean.”
Thinking back to the conversation with the overseeing physician, he remembered the image it conjured of Castiel walking out of a forest opening his mouth to speak but no words falling out.  The corner of Castiel’s lip curled up into a patient smile.  Nervous realization crawled up Dean’s spine.  “You could see that?”
Dean rolled his eyes.  “You think I was here at the ass crack of dawn filing my nails?  ‘Course I checked.  Every lock, window ledge, even the roof access - which I had never been on until today - we could totally do a tasting room up there in the summer.  The view is fantastic.  I even verified the spare building keys are still in the safe.  No one can get in the building except you, me, Benny, and Garth.  Seth and Starr are only here when Benny is, so they were never given any.”
“I’m gonna chill out in my room the rest of the night, guys,” Sam stood up from the table and put his dish in the sink.
“You’re sayin’ he’s mopping because he misses that place?  He’s been sleeping all day and up all night staring at the wall because he’s disappointed to be back home?” he snarled almost defeated by the thought.
When the sun broke over the clouds on Monday, Sam finally felt secure enough to let him out into the world.  Being fully accustomed to his absence at the office didn’t mean he was comfortable departing without a plan for their next meeting.  Over one of Mick’s freshly baked scones with jam, Sam redressed into his suit from Friday, knowing full well it looked as wrinkled as it smelled awful from the nervous drive over.
“You mind if I walk with ya for a bit?  Yer headin’ my way.  Gotta have a chitty-chat with yer partner.”  She swung her arms a bit wider to walk as fast as Dean.
“Don’t pull any punches do you?  Well, I was raised in a firmly religious household.  Dad believed god existed and he was the biggest asshole in all of creation.  As I grew up, I saw the terrible depths and soaring heights of what humanity does to its own.  It left me with lot more questions.  So I guess you could say I do, but I don’t follow any doctrine.”
When he noticed Sam hovering at the door, Dean turned his head up from what he read at the desk.  “Is she sleepin’?”
“No, he… he just chose the lesser of two personal tragedies: never see his best friend again or lose the loves of his life.”
He reassured him
He settled back in his chair and struggled to force his prickly embarrassment into a muted lament, “Does everyone know?”
Much to his surprise, then next time he would speak to Dean was the first day he reported to Salvage.  With every other project he took on, details were hammered out in a conference room setting over the course of a few days, so he took extra time wresting with his chaotic hair and wore his newest tailored suit.  He stepped through the front door Wednesday morning positive he would be a pleasant sight especially with a box of M’s award winning bear claws in hand.  As he scanned the brewery production floor, he couldn’t find a clear way to the office he assumed he would spend the next few days in.
“Is this okay?” he asked, his hands inert at Castiel’s ready for any direction.  No impatience or timidity could be scoured from his steady expression.
His limbs jerked and joints jammed as he descended the stairs, like they were on backwards and rusted.  By the time he reached the familiar smell his car, he had made peace with the possibility he would be barred from the premises.  Even if his decision to infiltrate their space was made before he had all the facts, he was the one who found the moral flexibility to hide the truth from them for so long.  All he could do was hold his neck out proudly whether the axe fell or not.
Dean felt the draw of Ketch’s hand to his Glock.  He eyed it menacingly, but held back at the last moment.
One sugary coffee flavored beverage and one plain black drip coffee were the sole centerpieces between the two men on the nearly barren study table.  Dean crumpled his breakfast sandwich paper wrappings into the bag on the floor and reclaimed his seat sufficiently caffeinated.  The light tremors of his knee bouncing up and down against the table leg only halted when Sam gave him the stink eye for a fourth time.
“Thanks.  You’re the best.”  He waved trying his best to extricate himself before she called him less work appropriate names in an effort to pick a fight with OPR for the second time that year when her coworkers narc’ed on her more floral language.
A thick grunt came from his atrophied throat muscles.
Come five o’clock, everyone cleared out with a pack of their newest seasonal in tow except Garth who only took two.  His dainty portion earned him a lighthearted ribbing, but he explained he had another church function to attend with his newest paramour and would only have an opportunity to drink a couple at most.  Once alone again in the brewery, he ventured back up to the office just to catch up on any new e-mails.  There was of course the one he was ignoring, but he flagged it and moved on.  One by one the newest ads and organization newsletters were filed or deleted until that nagging lone message remained.  A brassy growl sang out from his middle, so he traipsed back down to the bunker to see if Sam had hunted down and skinned him some eggrolls too.  When the cumbersome metal bunker door came into view, a large take out bag sat perched by the closed door with thick black marker sprawled on its face.
“Sure thing,” he nodded.  “Can’t imagine it’s rodents, though.  No traps have caught one in the time I’ve been here.  Just keep an eye out.”
He cocked his head lightly between his warm palms and beamed.  “I’m not entirely convinced.”
“Inconsistent comfort food,” he smirked as he flipped a bulky keyring around this forefinger into his palm.
Castiel could hear Dean’s murmured grumbling as he rounded the back of the van and flung it open.
After a few staggered steps, Sam turned to face the Impala, reminded of how uneven he felt sitting on the car seat before he exited.  He leaned down and searched in the dark from one tire to another. “The front driver tire’s still fine,” he stood to smirk at what he imagined was Cas’s direction as he closed the backseat door behind him.  “One out of four. You’re getting better at that.”
“Would it have mattered if they were actually caught with their hands in the employee retirement funds or that they were caught rejecting applications from the people they refused to hire?”
“Thank you, Dean,” he greeted him, but only turned a quarter of the way.  “I’m sorry I didn’t give you a proper greeting before.”
He climbed up the stairs from the basement with a particular tome at hand.  Something about what Gabriel had said about the other universes nagged at him.  The great matriarch of dark magic herself wrote an entire volume on drawing their power through a myriad of dangerous means, but he theorized that those methodologies could help him glean an alternative path to bringing someone into theirs if the occasion arose again.  Nearing the top set of stairs, he could hear the warm pops of a vinyl recording from the room at its summit.  He checked the clock on his phone just to be sure.  He was correct; Cas was still listening to records three hours before sunrise with his door half open.  Against the foot of the bedframe, he leaned back sitting on the pillow with one of the military surplus blankets over his shoulders.  A slow tempo ballad echoed into the passageway from the well maintained record player on the plastic crate past his feet.  His dark eyelashes obscured a vapid gaze into the headphone’s padding in his limp grip.  Unplugged they were of little use, but he focused on them like they held the key to a riddle repeating behind his eyes.  The somber tones weren’t loud enough to disturb anyone, but as Sam passed Dean’s room, it became evident they weren’t the only echoes haunting his brother.
Being I have a couple ideas floating around my skull, I figured I would figuratively put one to paper before I start up the true sequel "A Side".
The angel’s irises vibrated around the center as if concentrating on a feeling, but he gave no response.
“Fruit pebbles,” he answered and strained not to dart his eyes at Sam walking up behind him very slowly with a forefinger to his lips.  “The dark ones are mixed berry.”
Limp elbows rested on the table cradling a mug of tea with waning interest. “A what now?”
“Do you mind telling me how you got out?  How you broke free?”
Startled out of his malaise, a vast fondness washed over him.  “I’ll have to devise something else sweet to make her.  My neighbor told me that if you don’t widen kid’s palettes they just end up eating burgers and pizza the rest of their lives.”
He was still incredibly suspicious, but followed him clear across the bunker as he prattled on about their updated cataloging efforts.  This box led to that box and this was one was mislabeled but… honestly he was half paying attention, more worried about smearing the motor oil off his hands and onto his oldest pair of jeans.  The reorganization project was Sam’s brainchild after all.  Once in a blue moon he was tapped to move endless long file boxes or unwrap powerful artifacts, but never involved himself in the nitty gritty of the cataloging process.  They approached the open door to the sterile looking subbasement room.  Replacing its light fixtures and refreshing their bulbs changed the feel of the room altogether.  The shelves were arranged in stack style U configuration around a long metal table at the front of the room.  The husks of eight or so distended boxes were heaped under the far side of the table with their contents spread out across the tabletop neatly folded in short uniform heaps.  Dean’s jaw dropped.  “What are we looking at, Sammy?”
“What the actual fuck, Ketch!” Dean yelled indignantly.
“Fine, but you asked for this.  Don’t come crawling to me if you feel awkward about knowing stuff you shouldn’t.”  He pointed a firm finger at him with a commanding tone.  They both knew it was far more disturbing to say than to hear.  These were supposed to be private moments.  Until recently, Cas and Dean didn’t have many intimate moments he would have regarded as particularly sacrosanct.  Every fleeting brush of the lips and casual caress between them evolved into a salve that made his life worth all the trial and loss they mucked through together.  Finally instead of a hard fought attempt at a normal life pushed at another human that he tried to regard as meaningful, he had an unwavering mate.  In the end, the others couldn’t fathom the life he lived enough to accept him for who he needed to be to fight back the edge of oblivion over and over.  It wasn’t ever their faults he figured, so he gave up; found solace in his family and a swath of beds from coast to coast to make the lonely nights fewer and far between.  It was worth the tribulation because it brought him closer to Cas after all.  It only took a special kind of wayward creature to unite them.  Instead of fighting back to back against a surrounding enemy, Dean had to let the angel in to capture the beast.  That harrowing effort and the provoking lug sitting across from him at the table tag teamed them into dealing with the elephant in the car.  He owed Sam more than he could ever give, so what were a few veiled tawdry details?
Dean unhooked his arm from Sam’s middle and eased him onto his mattress never bothering to turn on the bedroom light.  “You need anything?  Pain killers or frozen yogurt or…”
“Enough, Sammy,” he sighed.  The hollow clink of his empty bottle piped upward as its base clinked down onto the kitchen table.  “I’ll think about it, a’right?”
He shook his head, not completely decided on how much to disclose.  Of course he was trustworthy, but without knowing exactly what was down there, it wasn’t safe to go poking around.  “Ghosts perhaps.”
“What? How?  I’m sure Dr. Stuffy McRedhead at St. Lucia explained to both of us that that part of his brain wasn’t fully functional.”  His snark slithered into curious contemplation.
“So none of the improvements would be because of my intrusion?”
“All the reports I have here detail some undercover stings gone stale, no smoking gun.”
After the routine morning constitutional and detailed grooming, he started the newfangled brewmaster machine and re-read another section of a personal journal from one of the Men of Letters journals from 1952.  He waxed poetic for over a fifty pages over a brunette, the moon casting inviting shadows over his needy sea.  Sam sneered at the thought of reading through his similarly winded mission reports.  There’s no way the repulsive stench of werewolf scat could hold his artistic attention with equal fervor, could it?  Desperate to think of anything else, he turned his ear to the percolating coffee.  A mild hangover irritated his senses enough to lose his appetite, but coffee remained a must. It would need another few minutes to brew, so he climbed out of his chair and went searching for Cas again.
With each supposition, body heat sluffed off of him in sheets.  Goosebumps chafed under his clothing with every step.  The only way to find answers was to follow his welcoming continence into a gloomy doorway leading into a complex underground lair, so he grabbed onto his extended hand.
Castiel lightly stepped past the door and down the hallway.  Needing visual confirmation it wasn’t a spur of the moment visit from Sam or Charlie, but leaned over the sink and glanced out the window past the curtains.  Both of them always, always texted or called before they stopped by.  After all, their line of work didn’t suffer sporadic visits or surprise parties.  Careful plotting and total transparency whenever possible were the preferred standard.  The light above the front door obscured that molded head of hair he would know anywhere.  The thought of grabbing his sidearm from the table in the entryway crossed his mind, but he thought better of it.  His opponent was squirrely and calculating, but such the odd ensemble of pajama pants and a glock would put them at odds.  The door hinge creaked as the door swung halfway open.  Dean stood firm blocking him from entering with his body but he maintained a cheery demeanor despite their spat a few days earlier.  “What’s up, Ketch?”
“So?” he spat petulantly.
“Yeah, yeah.  Where do you need me, Cas?”
“Um, hey, Cas.  What cha listening to?” he asked crouching down to slouch near him.  The frigid temperature of the hard floor seeped into his skin immediately making him regretted the decision.
SPOILERS for "Hunt, Chase, Wait".  If you haven't read that one yet, you're welcome to pop back in when you're done.  I'll hold your spot.
“If you count wearing a long ass oval into the library floor pacing as ‘progress’, then yes; we now have a track for you to run indoors.  Great progress,” he scoffed.  He knew it wasn’t Sam’s fault, but his nerves had no constructive exit strategy as usual.
Sam smiled at him, but it fell as did Mick’s shoulders.  He often let his emotions get the better of him when they were together at work.  He showed Sam enough trust to let his hair down on and off campus as well.  This felt different though.  His tight body language broadcasted as clear as day that the target that eluded him hit way closer to home.
Every second his Grace was intact, his thoughts shot to a universe billions of miles away.  The images it summoned pulled him out of the nurtured sensations of his surrounds, tore him from the cotton texture against his fingers as laundry fell into the washer.  If he was gone but a moment, none of this would matter to Dean or Sam past the initial explanation.  They might even forget it happened entirely if he was convincing enough.  If he was absent any longer, he would be driven explain where he was and how he toiled to return to them.  His return being the result of an unlikely fluke was hardly an acceptable answer.  While he could engage in humanity’s favorite past time and lie his way out of it, he and Dean had just recently arrived at a place where the truth, the unedited entire truth was more a comfortable proposition.  The blaring irony that it was just as necessary as it had been previously didn’t elude him.  He clamped down on a selfish impulse to travel out into the link.  That swell of resolute love wasn’t meant for this Dean and he would have sniffed it out, adding onto the already copious unsealed envelopes of wondering littering his center.
Consciousness spread to his fingers first.  They pulled them out from under the covers to spread over his squinting eyes and sleep worn scrunched face.  With one deep inhale, the caffeine percolating in the corner from the drip machine tugged him into a winding stretch.  Morning light poured over the stranger who sat silently staring out the window.  Dean threw the blankets aside with a grunt, quickly glancing over the messy hair and dark shirt hunched over two mugs of coffee.  He gazed through him with a far off longing but shook its mask off, replacing it with a humble smirk in the direction of the full mug furthest from him.  Dean’s legs swung off the side of the bed and fumbled to the chair on the other side of the table.  Even with the blinds pulled closed, the chair and table felt warm beneath him.  Faintly smiling, he stared down at the coffee, berating himself for trusting this stranger enough to drink it.  If he was foreign military intelligence, he could have poisoned it.  His half amused face did not go unnoticed by the blue eyed man.  His attention returned to the obstructed view out of the dust smudged glass.  His steaming mug dipped up and down with a curious groan.  Feeling just as exhausted as he did the night before, the agent drank his first sip, praying it wasn’t his last.  The stranger turned his eyes on him softly then stared at his up turned palm on the table.
“How come we can’t eat dinner together?” she asked wiping her budding tears with her sleeves.
“Clearly you weren’t paying that much attention then.  Ingrid was in love with Balthazar …”
“Hey, how about we get out of here when the squirrel wakes up?  Let her run around the park, have lunch at that diner across the way, maybe even buy you a vegan cookie for dessert,” he ducked down to jab playfully at his ribs like when they mock fought as kids.
“Right on the money, Sam.  This one,” she pointed to the top layer, “is Counter Terror.”  She slid that portion of the image to the side to show another rectangle of pixilation.  “This one is Counter Intel.”
“I’m not in pain, Sam,” he replied with immediacy.  “I am happy just to be by your sides,” he ended with a long contented exhale.
He smirked, “I have met him.”
Gob smacked, he waited for Sam to interject, to tell him it was all handled somehow.  A vacuum of disbelief formed in the atmosphere, syphoning oxygen from his lungs.  “How did this not come up when that leach changed over all the accounts to Sam and I?  We were told about all of Bobby’s other debts.”
“I can’t say,” he started to clam up again.
The pain of premature separation greyed out in the agent’s mind as he gazed upon unfamiliar versions of faces he knew: some more intimately than others.  Four men sat around a long wooden table against an off white bricked wall with beers in hand. Looking over each one of their faces jarred him like his head was spun one hundred eighty degrees in the wrong direction.  Another Sam raised a brown bottle of beer into the air over the center of the table with a contented smile.  He was thinner, with longer hair and more stubble.  His Sam shaved even on days off.  He was always so uptight and calculated that he was floored the first time they kvetched in comfortable companionship at the Boiler Room.  This Sam was less reigned in, deliberately joyful even in small bursts.  The agent could sense the angel’s impressions coloring how he saw them.  Next to him sat a gruffer version of himself, wrapped in plaid like his brother, clearly savoring their moment of calm.  A previous flash of this man slivered out of the corner of his mind; a vague memory of him in their link he attributed to Cas.  The bald passion Cas had for this version practically radiated off of him, smoky tendrils of blue light petting the periphery of a golden orb inside him.  His heart dropped as he noticed its bubbling reaction to the caress.  He turned his eyes further in a stubborn effort to emotionally pull himself up by his bootstraps. Across the table sat his Cas, his echoing giant, wordlessly sending his love afloat in all directions around the table.  A young wellspring of love poured from him at this Cas, all versions of him.  His eyes darted to his other side to the most confusing addition to the scene: the Kline boy.  The adoring admiration Cas beamed at this dressed down version of the young man perplexed him, forcing his attention away from the entirety of the slow moving portrait.
“Many religious institutions have some representation of absolute evil.  In my case, I was out of the family for a year or so, still looking over my shoulder at night.  I didn’t know any other language to transcribe that fear into.  It… was comforting, somehow.”
He opened his mouth then closed it again.  The other fraction of Castiel’s smile reflected on his lips as he asked, “Was Charlie texting you about handjobs?”
Delighted fluttery wings lit up his insides in reply.  He smiled so wide his cheeks ached.  Small crinkles speckled the corners of his eyes.  “Your terms sound acceptable,” he laughed.  Rummaging through the beers they had stocked in his mind, he headed up the stairs, passing his friend at the end of the main floor hallway.
“Exactly.  And if you like this guy, like want him around for longer than one of your flings.  Claire and I can break out the superhero DVD’s again and fall asleep right at home.” His was tone soft but buoyant, a joke locked and loaded on the tip of his tongue.
Castiel endeavored to silence the flickering panic from snapping up his knees.  “Well, if you’re still interested in making that mean steak for us, I’ll have a chance, won’t I?”
