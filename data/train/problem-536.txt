"I doubt it." John says as they pull up to his block of flats, "thanks for the pint and the chat, Greg. It was nice."
“Fuck my fist, baby. Just like that. You are so gorgeous. Good boy.” John says, compliments and praise falling from his lips.
Greg glances at the time. "If you can wait a little bit I can make you fresh pastries?" He hums softly and pets his head, smoothing John's hair in place like how he usually wears it.
She smiles and nods. “Another one of my abilities is to carry not only pups but regular babies as well. As many pregnancies as I want at the same time. That also may be why my energy is different because I’m currently carrying multiple pregnancies and litters.” She smiles and both Dark and Darius stand a bit taller, proud they knocked her up.
"I'm still trying to figure out the smell sense for the immersion mode. It's the hardest one so far. Sight and sound were easy even though I don't have those to work with but smell is... It's so much more. It takes you to places. Unlocks memories. It has to be just right." She hums.
He grins and mounts her, pushing into her easily. “Mm. You know I’m always thinking about your holes.”
Sherlock blushes and smiles, taking the cigarette as he walks closer. "Mm, sounds like a brilliant idea, Daddy."
“That was the first and only date I’d been on while you were gone. I.. I realized that you and I had never been on an actual date.” Sherlock shrugs, walking with John to the movie.
"Red meat and carbohydrates... a very policeman dinner." Mycroft chuckles. "No, we don't need to make a salad."
John raised his eyebrows. "If Mycroft had anything to do with it, don't you think it would have happened years ago?"
One of the other Gods step up to John and gently runs their hand over John’s burn, making it heal and go away, instantly.
“No but you’re trying for another anyway. One is drinking herself into an early grave and the other is desperate to be turned into one of us, yet you’re too busy trying to get laid that actually speak with them.” Camille frowns. “People have conversations with me when I want them. Now I would check up to see if your daughter is safe before accusing me of anything.”
“More than usual?” John asks. “Besides the whole breaking into our flat thing.” He hums, calling it their flat for the first time.
"It's a full moon." Lydia sighs as she walks by John and Brian. "Jesus, they don't stop coming, do they?" John says to Brain as the emergency room is busy as ever, a tinge of excitement lacing his voice.
He kisses him back deeply. “Mm.. next time, make me puke on your cock. Fuck my throat until I can’t breathe and have no choice but to make a mess.” He smirks against their lips.
"I think we can manage that. What do you think, boys?" The man smirks at the whoops and shouts from the team.
He blushes and nods. “I’ve never gotten to push all the way inside someone before. I’m just to big for them.”
Sky parks in front of Baker Street and closes her eyes. She takes a few breaths trying to quiet down the city around her. "We're here. Wake up." She hums to them still keeping her eyes closed.
"I'll sit on your lap if it makes you feel better. But I'm perfectly fine dragging one of the wooden chairs over.
“No, we’re going to become a safe house. You don’t tell anyone where the safe house is.” John frowns.
He has to bite his fist to keep from laughing uncontrollably. "Alright.." He says after a full minutes of trying to get his breathing under control so he doesn't laugh.
“Of course, baby.” She kisses his cock. “Mm I don’t have anything for lube.” She thinks. “Mm would you mind if I used my own slick as lube to stretch you?”
She sits fully on the floor, taking all it in. “Christ, that’s bloody brilliant.. fucking wild but brilliant.” She watches as Blaze blindly follows Sally’s scent to her.
Sherlock wraps his arms around him and rubs his back. “Yes, love.” He kisses his head. “Doing okay?” He asks softly.
“Why haven’t you been fighting abroad?” Annabelle asks. “Let’s go inside before we get bombed.” She says starting to lead the way back to the house.
Crystal’s face is flushed, a gentle rosy color now that she’s fed. Her skin looking nearly like normal. Her chest rises and falls quickly as she breathes, her breasts pulling at the right fabric of her shirt.
“I’ve only kissed you, John. Honestly. If I’m brilliant now…” John shivered at the thought of Sherlock, post-brilliant. Post-shower. Post-snog. Post-fantastic-blow-job; even if John had never given one, he could make miracles happen if he was determined. Post-earth-rocking-orgasm.
John made for the door. The rest of the night was textbook perfect. And that’s exactly what Molly and Callum deserved.
John leaned over and pulled the metal chain to the lamp. Sherlock cowered from the light, squinting his eyes. “Sorry,” John mumbled.
“Callum is your closest friend. I feel comfortable trusting that information with him. If you would like to bring him, you may.”
“We’d love to have another date,” Molly offered, in her most seductive voice. She blushed immediately, giggled and Callum leaned in to kiss her cheek.
“It’s been a hell of a month, boys, and a rough two weeks since our last match.” The men continued to watch him, making no remarks or snide looks. John knew he had the best team in the league, no matter who the other teams traded around, what other countries competed, or how young some of his players were. They were solid men; strong, confident and kind, and he knew they loved one another as if they were blood. He knew there had been a time and place in his life he never would have made it through if not for these twenty-two men; a constant comfort in his life; a soft place to land whenever he fell unexpectedly, supplying the love and support he never received elsewhere. Tears pricked his eyes, and he pressed on.
“I’ll take it!” Jane offered. “I’m Jane Jesep. You must be Sherlock! Molly talks about you all the time!”
. "Ah. Latin for 'light from the ground.' It's the motto for St Helens. Got it the night I signed on."
“Razorblade just seems so… mundane and ordinary for you. Figured you would have done something a bit more extravagant.”
“Well, that’s a debatable decision. John is lacking several admirable qualities…” John swatted Sherlock’s shoulder and shot him a look. Jane clapped a hand over her mouth to hush herself.
Sherlock headed south, toward the dock and toward a large, seemingly abandoned warehouse. John thought he heard music faintly in the distance; odd place for music. As they ventured closer to the warehouse, the music grew louder. John grinned. Jasper had told him a million times over how fun this place is, but John had never made the time to feel it out. He turned to Sherlock.
Sherlock smiled and ducked his head as he plugged in his information. He handed the phone back to John.
How the fuck could he ever go back to that hell hole? How does anyone return after leave? They may have to hunt him down.
Sherlock leaned back on his heels and wrapped a hand around his now mauve cock. His head fell back as the pleasure rippled through him. He whimpered, dangerously aroused at the thought of John watching so intently.
“What a fantastic welcoming committee,” John called out into the dingy apartment. He made his way into the living room and found Sherlock hovering over the stove top in the kitchen. He was dressed in gray plaid pyjama bottoms, his blue dressing robe thrown lazily over his shoulders. Why did he insist on dressing as though he were sixty?
season as well. Wesley went to visit his mother and younger siblings, and B was working with the local boys’ homes teaching them the rules of rugby.
Ah. John had only seen Molly dance a handful of occasions, mostly when they were right out of Uni. She had been auditioning for company after company. Apparently, they didn’t like her appearance. She wasn’t “elegant” enough, but John had long ago decided otherwise. Elegant to other companies had been tiny, angular, and lacking in any decipherable, unique physical qualities. Molly was none of those things; in fact, she was a warm contradiction to each of them. Molly was thin, but lean and strong. She had a fantastic body; John knew he could admit it without causing suspicions. Her shoulders were stunning and her legs spoke bravely of the hours spent slaving away in the studio. There was nothing sharp to her. Molly was soft and kind and warm: she had a buttoned nose and rich, brown eyes and her words were never hard. Molly had been dancing with Marylebone for nearly two years now, and as far as he could tell, she loved it. She stood straighter, spoke in a way that filled a room when needed, carried her chin to face others everywhere she walked. If this Sherlock could channel confidence in Molly, he was a friend of John’s.
John scoffed and pushed play. He headed back for the couch, grabbing a blanket on the way, and then settled in next to Sherlock.
Rage and heartbreak crawled through her body. So powerful was her need to wretch, she closed her eyes and tucked her head between her knees. John’s palm attempted to ground her, resting strongly between her shoulders. Here, so close to the hard bottom under her feet, the tears had less distance to travel. As she eyed the floor of the church, she imagined Sam’s body six feet below the tile, glowing in a wooden box. He’d rather die than leave his mother alone here. His sweet eyes would cry until he filled his coffin.
“Alright, yeah. Feels good. Continue on, if you’d like.” John turned to the television again, certain his heart had exploded into sunlight. The warmth overtook him.
So right now my plan is to post at least every Wednesday. With my last fic, I posted nearly every day, but the chapters weren't always long or well developed, and that's something I'd like to get better at! So, here's our first Wednesday post. Not quite as long as I had hoped, but I only had two nights to work on it!
“Congratulations. You’re also a medical student; you’ve had a combined 6 hours of sleep the past two nights, judging by the twitches of your fingers and the state of your eyes. Finals are close for you. How much coffee have you consumed today, just out of curiosity?”
“Jawn. How many drinks have you had?” John’s insides grew even warmer at the way Sherlock had begun to say his name. John, with an “awwww” in the middle, rather than the normal, stiff, perfect “oh.”
He was fucking gorgeous. The man could wear anything: a postman uniform, a moth-eaten cardigan, a paper sack, and he would leave John breathless. As it were, the cable knit jumper, sinfully fitted burgundy jeans and black Supras were doing just as fine a job. Sherlock smiled, pulled his beanie farther down onto his head, and leaned forward to John’s ear.
He looked as if he hadn’t slept ten of the twelve days they hadn’t spoken. Sherlock felt guilt puncture his lungs.
Sherlock squeezed the place where John’s neck met his shoulder, and the doctor placed his hand over the larger, pale one resting there. Silence nestled in comfortably between them.
“I’d like that very much, yes.” A blush fell across Sherlock’s cheeks as he twisted the handle to the front door. They both stepped out into the cool of the winter night. Sherlock wrapped his scarf tightly around his neck, buttoned up his coat. John stood in jeans and a sweatshirt, socked feet quickly growing cold through the chilly pavement. “Goodnight, John.”
“I’m in no mood for your mouth today, Irene. I have far too much to get done. Can you do it, or not?” Sherlock fooled with the wiring to the sound system on the stage. Irene Adler gave a huff in complaint, sighed dramatically, and dropped her arms by her side in defeat.
John’s eyes were wide and solid black. His lips were parted and his tongue ran slowly along his bottom lip. Sherlock shivered. He could find no words. He only obeyed Captain Watson’s every command, every bequest. He felt unearthly and divine under that intense stare.
Everything led up to this one fixed point. John could feel it: waves crashing inside his head, drowning out all logic and sensibility. This was long past making sense. Sherlock was his best friend, anyone would be an idiot to miss that much. But the letters, the small moments in time that were once disregarded now made perfect sense, the fear of leaving this life, knowing it was the one he had wanted all along, was growing stronger every day. A life with this ridiculous man: all voice, sass and cheekbone. And it was glorious. The past two weeks and three days had been tumultuous and uncharted, but John thought of Sherlock lazily sprawled on the couch, running his hands through John's sandy salt and pepper hair like it was second nature. Holmes had become unflinching at the idea of sentiment.
Growing up for him wasn’t exactly cold but it wasn’t overly warm either. He wanted his pups to know they were loved and wanted. That their parents adored them.
"Yours yours yours.." He chants over and over, moaning loudly. He loves being dominated by Sherlock.
Mycroft smirks and presses a hand to Greg's chest. "Mm.. What if we took you to bed. Both of us. And we fuck you?"
They soon finish making dinner and Mrs. Hudson sighs softly. "Ant, would you be a dear and go get the boys? I would, but I'm afraid of the situation I might find them in."
“I know so, Sire.” Mycroft says softly. He continues to rub her back, feeling her relax under his arms.
“I know I am young and immature and reckless. I am sorry for all this hurt. But... being young, I’m more open to listening to other people’s emotions. Please sire, don’t bottle your emotions up, allow me to lend you an ear.” He says softly, not sure whether to reach over and try to comfort Mycroft physically.
“If I find them and believe in them they’ll come back?” Sherlock asks, running his fingers through John’s hair.
"Watch what he does to her. Learn how he makes her feel good." Collin kisses Sherlock's back as he pushes into him. Carol smirks as she looks up at John standing in front of here, an obvious stand off for dominance happening between them without a single word.
"Only you can label yourself. I'm a freak. I enjoy it. I revel in my freaky ways. Life's to short to be normal." Viper hums and Sky smiles.
“Oh my god, this was meant to be a do-over and I’ve completely ruined our date!” John said, sniffing and trying to brighten up. “God, how you managed to convince yourself to marry a grumpy old bastard like me, I have no idea!” he joked. “Okay, let’s just start over here. Sit down. Will you tell me about what we’re eating now?” He put on a smile.
John took it with a smirk. "Well, if you only cook a few times a year, one of us will need to keep us fed." He teases. "This smells delicious.”
"I don't just need your cock, Alpha... I need you to fill me with your cock and seed. Someday I'll beg you to pump a pup into me... for now..." John pants, sliding Sherlock inside him. "For now, fuck me like you're trying to breed me anyway."
He grips his hair tighter and starts to fuck his mouth harder as Collin pushes a second finger into him.
“Yes, you did in fact. Glad to see amnesia won’t be an issue. Your skull is all sorts of mucked up.”
“Two Imperials, coming your way.” She turned her back to the boys, pulling two glasses from the shelf, and settling them diagonally near the tap.
2%? Whole? Skim? That looked repulsive, like water mixed with papier mâché. Soy? Almond? Why? Why were there so many choices? Couldn't there be just one milk? Sherlock debated between whole and 2% for a solid seven minutes before opting for the 2%.
“Man. If having someone else live in this flat would help me get my dishes done that quickly every night, I might have to consider it.” Jane topped off John’s drink, and she grabbed the orange soda from the counter. They headed into the living room where Callum and Molly were working on two beers.
John ran his hands through his sandy hair. It was getting too long. It was incredible how much hotter an extra inch of hair can make a man in a desert. He laced his boots, checked that all his patches were in place, and then made his way to the barracks to perform a routine check. He lingered in the doorway as the soldiers stood at attention. He paced the length of the room. “At ease.” His squadron fell to parade rest. Captain John Watson. Since when had he become a leader? A peacekeeper worth fearing?
“You make me better. It’s a silly concept, I know. Thinking loving someone can make you a better person. But it must. Because all the amazing things that have happened in my life happened when you were with me.” Sherlock blinked and John watched his eyes redden. “Any courage I have ever shown, and hard decisions ever made, anything worth celebrating or being proud of, you were there. By my side. My companion, through time and space, fear and fearlessness, easy and difficult.” Sherlock squeezed John’s hand tightly and bit his bottom lip. “You taught me to observe my surroundings, to appreciate the tiniest details and acknowledge that they, in fact, can change
A shaky exhale left Sherlock’s throat and John grinned. He turned his attention back to the telly, leaving Sherlock to gather his thoughts and composure.
“Right, I’ll leave you to it.” And with that, John stood up, wavering a bit, grabbed his mug and winked down at Sherlock. He downed the rest of his beer, left the mug on the bar and grabbed his coat. Sherlock watched him as he headed for the door, shrugging into his jacket, and blushed shamefully at the thought that flickered in the back of his mind:
John pulled the headphones from his ears, and rose from his cot. He made his way into the hall and walked up to a wash station. Cupping his hands, he splashed water on his face, through his hair. He snagged a towel and stepped into one of the pitiful stalls, drawing a thin canvas sheet closed as he undressed. He knew they had no temperature control, and he was only allotted six minutes of water. He turned the handle and the murky water began to pour from the makeshift shower head. As he ran the bar of soap over all the important areas, he contemplated what he would send Sherlock in return.
Sherlock began winding through the warehouse, John following closely behind. The music was nearly deafening, filling up every cell in John’s body. The space was large, two of the four walls lined with garage bays, and large, colored lights hung from the industrial steel of the roof. It was crowded, but not like many clubs, where there’s no room to breathe or move and the whole place smelled of sweaty sex and booze. John grinned. This place felt clean. Easy. Fun.
Jane let her forehead drop to the table as she laughed. John made a note of her silent laugh, preciously bent halfway over and shaking with no sound. Molly was giggling into her hand, eyes squeezed shut and tears running down her cheeks. Callum chuckled, deep and warm in his chest. John looked around, wiping the few leaking tears from his own eyes. This was his family. Molly and Callum: whole, real, beautiful people who sent kindness out into the world with their every breath, and Jane. Whoever the hell she was or would be, John was thrilled to have met her. She was another ray of sunshine, and god knows he could use it. He sighed and began to stack up the dishes.
What had happened there? Sherlock was supposed to be the one to make people dance. Which was why Jim Moriarty practically wanted to eat him alive, why Lestrade had called him in for years, why Mycroft was constantly asking him to perform the legwork he refused to do. Sherlock got shit done, and he was a man of confidence, undeniable intellect, and although he was not a people person, he
“Jane, it’s a pleasure to see you again.” Sherlock followed and extended his hand. Jane stared at it momentarily, glanced up to Sherlock’s eyes, then back to his hand. “May I hug you instead? Would that be awkward? Or is it already awkward because I’ve just said that?” Sherlock chuckled, nodded, and embraced her. Jane wasn’t exactly sure what she was expecting, but it hadn’t been a warm body and a rather adequate squeeze. A surprised sound came from her mouth and John laughed. They headed toward the Everetts’ sitting room. Jane watched as John and Sherlock lingered near the edge of the sofa. Molly and Callum came in from the back patio, Callum with a beer in his hand. Molly beamed at the sight of them. “Hi!” John and Sherlock both embraced her. She was a bit pink from all the sunshine, skin clear and bright. “I’ve missed you both so much!”
“No thanks, I think this will do it for now.” John replied with a devilish smile. The waitress blushed and headed back towards the bar.
John rapped on the door that led into the other part of the flat. It swung open and Sherlock was in gray, plaid pyjamas and the blue dressing robe. Watson’s heart clenched at the beautiful familiarity of it. So much about Sherlock was different, but then, nothing was. “You don’t need to knock. Please. Help yourself.”
The world outside their window was white. It was Christmas morning and fresh powder had hugged every rooftop in London.
“I agree,” he murmured as his arms snaked around John’s shoulders. John could feel Sherlock’s mouth at the nape of his neck. John hummed delightedly as Sherlock pressed his lips softly to his skin. “You were perfect tonight,” the brunette rumbled on, “gorgeous and sharp and graceful.” He bit at John’s collar, thumbed the sensitive skin behind his ear. “All I could think about is the last person walking out the door, so I could do this…” John watched as Sherlock started at the buttons of his shirt. He drew a sharp inhale as the cold hands found his chest underneath the cotton. Sherlock bit at the skin of his shoulder and sank to the the floor between John’s knees. John watched him through lidded eyes as Sherlock kissed his khaki covered legs. John’s shirt was spread open; the kisses trailed from his knee up his thigh, past his belt buckle until Sherlock’s nose was pressed into the warmth of John’s flesh, his breath fluctuating in short bursts across flexing muscle. John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and gasped at the large hand now palming him through his trousers. He murmured something indecipherable and Sherlock smirked, sitting back on his heels and tracing John’s erection with his teeth. John let out a husky laugh.
She gave Sherlock a nervous grin and her eyes darted to the right, where the doors to the theater had just swung shut. “Of course. ”
Jane smiled and John noticed the hesitancy behind it. He made a mental note to follow Callum’s directions, and gave her a friendly grin. It seemed to serve its purpose of reassuring her, because she shrugged out of her mustard yellow pea-coat and handed it over to John. He hung it in the closet and padded into the kitchen.
She tucked her head further into his chest, turning to place a whisper of a kiss on his arm. He planted one on the top of her head in return. Callum continued to mull through the photos.
John took a big inhale, then a huge swig of his beer. “I missed all of you. You know this. But I think you also all know that’s not the only reason I have you here.” Callum’s eyes didn’t leave John’s. A small smile from a few of his teammates temporarily stamped down the last traces of anxiety swimming through him. “I’m here to tell you all that I met someone.” Rhys grinned like an idiot and slapped the closest victim on the back; it happened to be Egan. A swell of murmurs took over the flat.
The entire room began to laugh and whoop as the first notes of the song came on. John began to circle her; she tried her hardest not to laugh as the man gave her a sexy look each time he passed, while she sang the first verse from her seat in the chair, crossing and uncrossing her legs, waving her finger in the air. She found her feet, and John walked straight up to her until their noses were nearly touching, using his hands to outline the shape of Jane’s body. She gave him a shove in the center of his chest, hardly enough to push him far, but he feigned a look of shock. Jane continued to sing, and John stripped himself of his jacket, rolling up his sleeves, hounds tooth suspenders bright against his plain white button up. Egan, Violet, and Jess cat-called from the floor. Molly and Callum were nearly bent in half, eyes nearly pinched shut from laughter. Jane dragged her French manicured hands across John’s chest, doing a small twist of her hips as she lowered herself closer to the floor. John placed his hand over hers on his chest, pulling it away, and twisting her as she worked her back up. Jane nestled her back into John’s chest, and they did a small two step together that way, his arm wrapped around her shoulder and interlocking with her hand at her hip. She unwrapped herself and dropped John’s hand, then sat him down in the chair forcibly, spinning her way to the back. Jane grabbed his shoulders with her fingers, leaning in close to his ear, and continued to sing. Her right hand found its way into his mussed hair, giving a gentle tug until his neck was exposed, then she let go, taking a seat in his lap, arm wrapped around him, as the song ended.
What is death? An ending so definite and sure, and yet so fucking impossible to face. The sermon began but Jane heard nothing save for Sam’s laugh.
John smirked and then chuckled as Graham gave him a gentle shove towards Sherlock. John would not dance, not yet, but he sure as hell wouldn’t deny placing himself in Sherlock’s personal space. Not like this. Sherlock was on, and John loved every fucking second of it.
John took a step back. “Are you finished for the night? I could keep watching another three or four hours, if you need to continue.” He smiled broadly at Sherlock.
John opened his eyes, and then his heart was in his ears, rattling against the ribs in his chest. “Let me OUT” is what it would say, if it could speak. Sherlock was up on one elbow, hovering over John, his eyes moving over every square inch of him. John was being memorized, recorded, saved into the hard drive of this brilliant, beautiful, mad man. John barely shook his head in awe before deciding. Fuck it.
Sherlock stood against the wall speaking with Wesley. John smiled as he watched Sherlock’s expressions, thankful that Wesley was the one with his back to John. Sherlock lifted his drink to his lips, and in the time he tilted his head back, lifted his eyes to John over the rim of his glass. John quirked an eyebrow,
"Right. Okay. Well this is a Sig Sauer P226," John explained as he turned his shoulder to Sherlock. "My father was retired military. I learned guns early, and it is my lady of choice. Firing out of it, if you will, is the pulsar map of the USS Enterprise."
“Shezza, how’s it?!” Sherlock dropped his eye contact with John and turned, sighing, toward the voice. Ah. Tito and Izzi.
he was in these photos. They had eaten out on the patio that night, much to Sherlock’s (possibly feigned) dismay. John had ordered a lager and fish and chips. Sherlock, of course, ate nothing.
John’s hand covered his mouth to stifle a cry. Tears were rolling in steady streams down his cheeks. He was so terribly, painfully, wonderfully human. All this time, tucked under tailored suits and sweeping trench coats and tart, biting words this beautiful creature had known love. And it had been for John. It had always been John.
No, no, no. She was all wrong. She liked cats, she was too aggressive on the stage, and her eyes… something about her eyes. She would never fit next to Molly and Sherlock
“I’m sorry! I was exhausted, in unfamiliar territory, and you were a bit of a distraction. Do most people tell absolute strangers they have an ass that makes them mad with want?” John could hear the crooked grin in Sherlock’s question.
. His fingernails dug into Sherlock’s back, his thumb pressing deep into the concave part of his hipbone.
“We’re working with weaving, but we’re doing it with paper.” John watched as she tried to steady her hands. Kirsten laughed.
“Hello.” Sherlock felt a smirk pull at the right corner of his mouth as he stared down at the papers sprawled out in front of him, tiny gestural drawings scribbled in layers. “I’d like an Imperial Stout, please.” Oh. That was a lovely sound. Melodic and low and assertive. “Yes, on draft would be quite alright.” And so polite. Sherlock watched in fascination as gooseflesh crawled across his forearm. He tilted his head, cropped hair shifting with it, so he could better see John out of his peripheral vision. John had made his way up onto a stool, and Sherlock felt his brows furrow. Where was Callum? They were in Ireland, not parading around London. Sherlock could hardly believe John knew this area as well as he knew home. Why was he out alone? Sherlock pushed the lock button on his mobile and reexamined the date. They had a match tomorrow; their first in the International Cup, if he remembered correctly. The bartender set the beverage in front of John, and Sherlock turned to see John dead on, watching the muscles of his forearms tense as he clutched the mug and brought it to his lips. Sherlock felt heat around his neck and chest, a particularly annoying symptom that correlated with John Watson's presence. He was about to turn his attention back to his work when a brunette approached John at the counter. Sherlock continued to observe, seeing this as an opportunity to answer a lingering and particularly overbearing question he had tried to deduce earlier, quite unsuccessfully he might add. She flipped her hair over her shoulder as she propped an elbow on the bar, body turned toward John. Sherlock felt his nose wrinkle in disapproval at her proximity, and how forward she was with her intentions. He watched John’s eyes as they turned to hers; he laughed and began to chat her up. Sherlock had just felt the oncoming stone settling in the pit of his stomach when John looked past her and straight at him. He averted his eyes, far too late to avoid the burn of John’s drown-in-me blues and cursed himself for ever looking up in the first place. He tapped his pencil on the paper erratically and took a large swallow of his beverage.
He grinned as Tito was gently pushed into the circle. Sherlock analyzed Tito’s form. He had cleaned it up a bit since the last Underground. The man could move, and well, but he had a difficult time making his movements seem intentional. While everything during these events was spontaneous to some degree, it was always important to make things feel second-nature, deliberate, confident—
John raised a curious eyebrow. “A trip? That sounds lovely, but can you afford to get away right now?”
John wrapped a napkin around his fresh drink and turned to observe the dance floor. Violet, precious with her seven month belly, was dancing with her back against Egan’s chest. John watched as his teammate kissed her shoulder and nestled his chin into her neck. Jasper was chatting Jess up. He had played at the Duke and Duchess during their week break, and apparently had taken quite a liking to her. Violet was pleased; if anyone had to date her sister, she would prefer Jasper. It was Rhys she had to keep an eye on. B was dancing with two younger children: one perched on his hip, the other with their hand clasped in his.
The skin above his brow tingled. What an odd sensation to feel when one is no longer breathing. John focused on the gentle touch. It was so familiar somehow. Cold, but kind. He forced his eyes open in an effort to investigate further. He was blinded by fluorescent lights. A tall figure loomed over him and John could not decide whether or not to allow terror overtake him. Then, there were fingers, brushing his hair out of his eyes. Long, pale, lithe fingers.
The first photo was of John sitting on the bottom bunk in the barracks, uniform bottoms blending in with the gray-khaki poly-blend of his blanket. He sat slightly hunched, his forearms resting on his thighs and legs relaxed. He had just glanced up at Sherlock, mid-laugh, his blue eyes squinting at some smart ass comment the detective had muttered. Something about repressed sexual energy or the support of individuality on base.
Callum smiled sheepishly, eyebrows moving upward on his face in apology. He knew something was up with John – he had been was too internalized this last week. He’d come in two hours early for practice and would stay another three after he dismissed the rest of the team. Callum had left Saturday night alone, knowing it would spark a complicated conversation John may still be working through. Callum knew John would be ready when he arrived to practice fifteen minutes before rather than ninety, or when John offered to visit the pub not too far from the field for a pint after practice.
It was idiotic, but he had no choice. He clenched his eyes shut and focused, furiously, on slowing his breathing.
“Should’ve fuckin’ written me back, you prick.” John squeezed the beautiful hand, and fell back asleep.
“Touch yourself.” John pried one of Sherlock’s hands from the sheet and wrapped it around the detective’s own velvet prick. “Now.”
, that it’s okay to love Eccleston more than Tennant, that Thai take away is better after midnight and trench coats aren’t just for cold weather.” Another snicker fell among their treasured guests. “You have taught me what it feels like to be loved, to stand up for myself and to accept who I am, to be worthy of love and terrified of losing it. You have made me feel worthy, Sherlock. You were the first man to make me feel worth keeping.” The detective inhaled sharply, a small tear rolling down a silly cheekbone. “I do not use my words often enough. You are irreplaceable, and living without you would be one of the hardest things I would ever have to endure, and I never want to do it again. Thank you, for everything you have given me, shown me, taught me… To know your love is to live a wonderful life of adventure. I want to be your companion for all of time. This is my vow.”
John laughed. Jane jerked her head to look at him again, signs of relief readily available on her face.
It’s likely he had serious fractures, but for now, he could see and only a vague dizziness fell over him. Carefully, unable to use his hands to help, he rose to his feet. He steadied his breath, desperately trying to ignore to obvious agony his body was enduring. If he didn’t get out now, he wouldn’t. He would die here in the seventh circle of hell. John was certain he had never believed in Satan until this.
“Don’t be a cock, of course I’m alright. And you’re an asshole.” John turned on his heels and walked back towards the main road. Sherlock reached his side in half the steps (of course, damn him and his long, lean, gorgeous, edible legs…) and slipped his fingers between John’s.
Molly’s mouth fell open and pink kissed each of her cheeks. Sherlock tilted his head in confusion. “If that would embarrass you, I don’t want you to—”
“Sorry, I asked you what the plan for today was.” Sherlock propped his elbow up against the tile of the shower, falling into a contropostal stance. Naturally... in a relaxing pose, he
“Of course. You are only human. It is often difficult to find ways in which you can relate to such a diverse range of persons, certainly when it comes to empathy and understanding difficult situations. Fear not. You are doing a superb job, if John’s thoughts on the matter are truthful. I would only assume they are seeing as he speaks of you with the utmost level of admiration and respect.”
Sherlock packed up his few belongings he had with him. Being on a mission in Iraq and then ending up on a base in Afghanistan, rather than back in his flat, had not left him with much.
Within minutes of watching Sherlock fall apart under his own touch and John’s torment as well, the doctor reached out, shifting his weight to Sherlock’s shoulder, pressing him down into mattress as his thrusts became more erratic. He was on the cusp and Jesus fucking Christ there was nothing better than this slice of fucking heaven underneath him... of this, John was certain.
The first of many tears rolled down Jane’s cheek. “It was never difficult.” Mrs. Evans gave a short nod in response, and Jane pulled her closer, wrapping her in a tight embrace, one hand firmly rested between the woman’s shoulders and the other running through smoke-scented hair. “Whatever you need… Anything at all…” Jane kissed the mother’s cheek, squeezed her hand once more, and released her. “Just ask.” Mrs. Evans wet eyes shared their thanks, and John guided Jane to the dark wooded pews, the time of the service approaching.
I want to keep working this story -- any ideas or thoughts you have in mind for our amazing men, please share! As always, thank you for reading my little story, and for your magnificent patience with my delayed update!
“For making you feel ashamed or embarrassed. For interfering with your grieving process. For expecting you to share everything with me when I have no right to know any of it.” Sherlock felt John press his lips against the top of his head.
“I haven’t seen him this distracted since Harry.” Molly felt her lips part in shock, remembering that John Watson all too well. God, had it already been that long? She shivered.
John sat for a moment, chewing on the snack, as he tried to push that together. Sherlock had more than one living space. He grinned at the thought that he and Sherlock both had such a huge thing in common: an off-season. They didn’t exactly match up – Sherlock seemed to be functioning full-genius right as John was finishing his season, but it meant something to John nonetheless. Sherlock could identify with a lifestyle so many others could not. Being completely submerged into a passion is one thing people do not often have in common. John’s heart did a small dance in his chest.
The week passed far too quickly, and once, John and Jane met for lunch. Mostly to discuss how they could assist Molly and Callum in the upcoming months, but also for the company, each struggling with the lack thereof in their own lives: John wishing he had someone and Jane trying to figure out how the hell to be alone, properly. The lunch was wonderful: easy and mellow and honest. Jane drank three cups of coffee in one sitting and John ordered extra chips. And when they parted ways, he gave her a squeeze and she kissed his cheek, and that, as they say, was that.
from the shelf. It had not yet been read; the spine was far too stiff. It had been a favorite of Sherlock’s. He made a mental note to encourage John to read it. John would surely be attracted to Lisbeth the same ways he had been.
John stepped out and yanked Sherlock into the flat by the front of his oversized, cream jumper. “I don’t give a shit about others. I’m kissing you. Right. Now.” John growled. The door slammed and John pinned him against it, pressing his chest flush with Sherlock’s. He mouthed at Sherlock’s neck, breath gusting across his flesh in a short, shallow pattern. “Fucking Christ, Sherlock. You should have warned me that you wouldn’t be in typical attire. This is…” John ran his hand down the front of Sherlock’s jumper to the thighs of his burgundy jeans, where John proceeded to drag his fingernails into the denim. Sherlock kissed John hard on the mouth, and then bit his bottom lip, worrying it between his teeth. John gasped, the tiniest hint of frustration evident in his voice. “Is there anything you aren’t stunning in? Am I really meant to not take you right here? Must I wait?”
“I’m enjoying you.” John hummed. Sherlock felt his face grow hot. John chuckled. “I love watching you blush. You always seem so surprised by it.”
A single violin rang out. Sherlock’s fingers curled as if he were clawing at the floor, trying to dig a hole through the stage. Then his arms spread wide apart before one hand found its way into his own head of hair. Then he was pulling himself over and back, shoulder blades flat against the ground and knees still folded underneath him. John watched in fascination as Sherlock arched his back, rising to his knees and extending one hand tall and strong above him. John couldn’t help watching the muscles as they tensed; every move was so deliberate and full of undeniable intention. Three other violins joined in, harmonizing with the first, and then Sherlock was on his feet, walking, running? Pacing, John decided, from one end of the stage to the next. A quiet “huh” escaped from John’s lips. Sherlock stilled in the center of the stage and the violins dropped to a beautiful whisper. Irene’s eyes were closed, her chin high as her hands moved to and from the center of her chest. Sherlock began to sway slowly side to side, like a pendulum. His left hand began to tick, as if possessed by a twitch or tremor. A cello joined the violin, a deep reverberating sound. Sherlock’s jaw jerked up and to the right, suddenly, frantically, as a look of epiphany bloomed across his face. John admired the perfect “oh” of Sherlock’s lips. And then he lept across the stage, landing silently on his feet and folding to the floor in one, fluid movement. One knee tucked in close to his heaving chest, his other leg extended in a languid fashion. He rolled to his side, unfurling his leg, extending his arms above his head, and John was able to study the entire length of him. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair. One of Sherlock’s hands began to grip at his chest, tugging his white shirt taut across his abdomen, and suddenly John felt very hot. The hand made its way down to his thigh, digging into his flesh. His back arched against the floor, and his chin tilted back; the body language was personified lust. John tugged at his tie and set his binoculars down. Molly peered over at him, a look of concern on her face.
John rolled his eyes, kissed the brows of his future husband, and plucked the fortune from his fingers. He walked into the kitchen and placed it on the fridge next to a photo of the two of them, wrapped up in coats and scarves. He secured it with a small magnet.
Sherlock took two steps, and his beautiful face was staring down at John’s. “But you’re here, and not there. And I’m here, too. So stop being afraid. Knowing I will have to be without you for two years after this is agonizing, but not nearly as painful as watching you fumble through this day, and every other day, simply because you dread something that is ages away.” Sherlock’s eyes were pleading. John's chest clenched. What a beautiful confession to hear from this perfect man.
The tears fell, hot and wet against his cold face. And then, there was cold and wet. As his bride walked up the aisle, snow fell. He watched as Molly laughed and stuck her hand out to catch the flakes as they kissed her warm, radiant skin. She was heaven on earth: a slice of hot apple pie with vanilla ice cream; the first day of summer, warm and flushed and in full bloom; she was the feeling of victory on the rich green of the pitch, his favorite smell of damp earth and clover; she was the healing kiss of ointment, the drowning of tension in a hot shower, she was pure relief; she was the perfect pair of jeans, snug and comfortable and no matter how often you wore them, they only got better; she was steam rising from a hot cup of tea, swirling, aimless and light through whatever the air held next for her; Molly was the sunrise and the sunset, the laughter from his lungs, the earth and the sun and the meteor belt: the perfect balance orbiting. She was the core of his well-being, the source of his joy, the marrow of his bones. And she was his. For as long as they lived.
John stared through him. Dark marks haunted the undersides of his eyes, and they were completely unresponsive. Sherlock reached out to trace the line of John’s jaw tenderly. John blinked once, twice, and his eyes shifted from dull back to their usual attentiveness. Sherlock’s eyebrows pitched up in confusion.
Maybe it was Sherlock referring to him as captain, maybe it was his clever wordplay. Or maybe it was just the fact that John Watson had this perfect human being sprawled out under him, trembling at his touch and his every word…
Sherlock tapped his pencil on Bill’s file. He read through the notes he had scrabbled down in a rush to capture his first impression.
Of course, the only good thing about this sandbox was John Watson. It had been nearly a week since their…whatever it was. Encounter? Watson had continued on as if nothing happened, which as much as Sherlock hated to admit, he was eternally grateful for. Part of Sherlock was highly aware that John knew him far too well. Knew when to tune up and when to bow out. He knew Sherlock would flounder if the incident was mentioned. He had sidestepped it altogether, and given Sherlock comfort in knowing he had no intentions of making another move. Which was good. Very good. Right? Sherlock swished the black tea around his teeth in thought. He had been trying to pitch this to himself every day since the doctor had been poised over Sherlock’s body, urging him on with his captain’s voice. He still wasn’t buying it. He wished he could open his skull and pluck out the emotion bit, like Data from Next Gen. Just choose to turn it on and off. Unfortunately, it wasn’t that easy. And he wasn’t an android, as desperately as he wished he was on occasion.
“How did you know I like Imperial Stout?!” John whispered in a tone of false admiration. He was feeling particularly cheeky tonight, and a bit braver than normal.
Sherlock raised an inquiring eyebrow and followed John’s hand into the bowl between them. “Is that so? And here I was, believing you to be a gentleman. Such a shame. You make an awfully large assumption that the feeling is reciprocated.”
Few people knew what John and Callum had gone through together, and the boys made a point of keeping it that way. It was a part of their lives they dared not reenter for fear of never getting out again. They had barely managed, dragging their bodies out of the figurative abyss, and hardly unscathed. Both had scars to prove it. But they had always had one another, without words or questions or doubts. The broken John Watson, strong for everyone but himself, was walking elegantly with Jane’s arm laced through his. The pair was grinning like fools when they reached him at the altar. John gave his shoulder a strong squeeze as he took his place next to Callum.
“Yeah.” She felt him slipping farther away from her, burying himself in worry and responsibility, as he always did.
*Chachi is a real woman, and she is incredible. I have already linked one of her videos here, but if you want to do a little more research on her, her name is Chachi Gonzales. She's fantastic.
Molly heard a faint rap on the front door. She turned to Callum with a confused expression on her face. “Were you expecting company?” she asked. He shook his head and stood, making his way into the foyer. Jane stood on the front step, eyes puffy and tired.
John ran two fingers across Sherlock’s clavicles, dominant and exposed on his chest. Sherlock shuddered at the contact. Watson clawed up one of Sherlock’s thighs. “You are everything I imagined you to be and so much more,” he whispered into the detective’s neck. He kissed the shell of Sherlock’s ear. “You are stunning.” He kissed the skin just along his jawline. “I can’t wait to watch you come for me, Sherlock.” His voice filled every hollow place in the detective’s body. Then he bit, chasing the sting with the gentlest trace of tongue. A string of indecipherable obscenities left Sherlock’s lips as he came across the comforter and tile floor. John wrapped a hand gently around the left side of Sherlock’s neck and licked and nipped the other as he found his breath again. Sherlock collapsed onto the bed, chest heaving, eyes lidded.
Molly shook her head. “No need, kettle boiled right before you arrived. Jane, are you alright to play mother?” Jane laughed.
He was milder, John concluded. Subdued. Of course, John had almost died, and now his father was, in fact, dead. He supposed that being subdued in a situation like this would have been suiting. He stepped farther into the flat. It felt like Sherlock. Cluttered, papers pinned to the wall, the furniture was worn in and looked well loved, the kitchen table was full of beakers and test tubes. Two windows let sunlight dance in long panels across the rug and a desk, revealing precious dust particles, floating along.
Sherlock smirked and removed the dark cherry violin from the crook between his chin and shoulder. “Yes. Most weeks. Five out of the seven we have known each other,” he offered casually.
go out any more. You need a drink or seven. Lighten up, Holmes. I’ll see you then.” With a turn of her hips, she was walking up the aisle and out the double doors.
Those elegant hands left John's upper body and instead traced the length of John's legs. They started on the tops of his feet, following the lines of his shins, caressing the scuffs, knots and scars of his battered knees, lovingly kneading the strong muscle of his thighs until they came to rest at the junction of his hips. Thumbs ghosted across the pale, unseen flesh of John Watson, the men’s mouths stealing the tiny sounds that escaped their lips. Sherlock gave a gentle rock into John’s hips, moaning softly at the friction, his fingers grasping firmer into the skin of John’s back. He pulled John on top of his thighs, wrapping his arms around John’s entirety, pressing their chests together, their hips, their insistent and eager erections, Sherlock’s mouth open on John’s neck. John clutched Sherlock, one arm around his neck, the other cradling the back of Sherlock’s skull, holding him as though he were something divine and unattainable, something that could evaporate into thin air if he didn’t hold him tight enough, close enough, strong enough. John’s eyes were tightly closed, eyebrows pitched up, the pulse point at his neck thrumming rapidly, mouth slack, hips rolling into Sherlock’s. Sherlock sank forward, resting John on his back. He kissed John slowly, first on his lips, savoring that John was nearly too wrecked to engage. He kissed his ear, first the shell, then a line from the tender skin beneath it to the rise of his clavicle. His hands joined his mouth, trailing delicately down John’s sides, following the glistening aftermath of Sherlock’s lips.
John finally stood up straight. As he turned to face his imminent doom and greatest desire, Jane piped up with a bright smile on her face.
He tugged a headphone from John’s ear, and the blonde jerked his head up, eyes narrowed and posture tensed. Callum felt a tiny hint of guilt in the pit of his stomach. He knew John didn’t do well with the physically unexpected. He hated surprises.
John settled in at the dining room table and Sherlock sat across from him, legs folded up in the chair. John took the first bite of his eggs, typically a bit hesitant about having them fried. He hated a particularly runny yolk, but still liked the texture to be there. They were perfect.
John stepped back and used his jumper sleeve to wipe the wet from his face. “Sometimes?” He looked up at Sherlock, swollen and watery-eyed. John hesitated a moment, and decided to continue the sentimental streak. “You are the first person in my life to believe I am something of worth. Thank you.”
The metal traveled across his chest, then to his back. Captain Watson’s hands told Sherlock a great deal about the character of the man: they were strong hands, tanned and freckled, his blonde hair shining like gold from the unforgiving light of the desert sun. They were callused across the insides of his fingers, and where his digits connected to the palms. A sure sign of manual labor and legwork, possibly hints at a past involving instruments, but mostly they spoke to Watson doing what he must to earn his keep. Though he was a soldier, he was delicate and gentle in his movements: conscientious, attentive, and kind. Could be worse. Sherlock has had doctors in the past who were ready to kill him themselves and take the death number on their record, believing they would be doing the world a massive favor. Watson knew nothing of the path of destruction that was Sherlock Holmes. At least… not just yet.
He loves that Sherlock speaks twice as fast when he’s excited, the way his eyebrows launch upwards on his face and his voice changes when he is trying to recreate a pompous big brother, the large, sweeping hand gestures as he finally reaches the climax of the story, and his chuckle at the recollection of it all. Sherlock was an artist. Not just in his many incredible gifts, no. But in his very existence. At the core of his being, Sherlock’s life was a work of art. His character, his demeanor, his love and play of language and his careful interactions with everything and everyone that surrounds him. He chooses every day to be a man in search of more from this life, never settling or succumbing to the expectations of those that believe their opinion to be of the utmost importance.
“What, in fact, does Sherlock Holmes get off on?” John planted a love bite on the inside of Sherlock’s right thigh. His better half gasped, then those long fingers were grasping at John's hair. Watson's ego continued to swell, confidence pouring out of his mouth and into his cock.
It had consumed him, the darkness. It made him mad: he was anxious and exhausted and fuck, so strung out. And then the indifference leaked in. It didn’t matter if he ate, if he showed up for work, if he got his suit pressed before going in, if he had a license to carry that weapon or not, if it was unwise to hunt the criminal down himself. He became reckless. Ruthless, and terribly reckless. He had been coming down from a particularly nasty high, something had gone awry there, and all Sherlock remembered was bleeding out in that repulsive, Iraqi hotel tub, suit and all. He had ruined that plum satin shirt. Damn. He hadn’t even thought of that until just now. It had been his favorite.
“No, no. Sherlock’s like this, insane creative genius. He owns the venue, but he also owns the dance company. And writes the music for every show.”
John thought. Jane twisted her hair up in a knot on the top of her head and leaned back on the sofa.
The boys tossed their bags into the undercarriage of the charter bus, headlights glaring out into the dark of early morning. In a clumsy line, they sleepily shuffled onto the bus, most bundled up in sweats and large headphones placed over their ears.
Sherlock looked affronted. His mouth fell into a small O and then closed again. “I’m – I’m sorry, I just hadn’t heard from you. I was worried. I’d called and texted…”
Callum was chewing on his lip. John noticed the freshly mangled conditions of his fingers and felt a stab of guilt. They’d only just gotten back from holiday, and Callum was already fretting because of him. Even so, he’d just have to get used to it. Callum turned to face John, the skin around his eyes lighter than the rest of his face from wearing sunglasses. He could see the perplexed look in Callum’s eyes, likely an attempt to come to terms with all this, but also the natural inclination to just try and understand it.
“Thank you so much for having us. We know your return trip was a bit stressful. How was the rest of the holiday?”
"If you don't tell me what it means, I will leave. And I will not come back." Sherlock placed his hand back at John's wrist, twisting it gently to reveal the tiny word on his pale, veined forearm.
"Alright. Start from the top." Sherlock directed. He sat up straighter on the bed and crossed his legs Indian style, turning to face John completely.
The doctor rested Sherlock’s ankles across his right shoulder. John slowly, carefully, lovingly ran his hands along Sherlock’s ribs as he pressed inside. The brunettes eyes widened, and then fluttered closed as his head fell back into the bed, inky hair spreading out over the sheets.
“Nope, sure haven’t. And yes. Only you, that’s why it’s been the best.” The ‘s’ carried on. John leaned forward and planted a messy kiss on Sherlock’s mouth. “You are the greatest gift I have ever received. Truly. Did you know that, Sherlock? You’re a present. A beautiful, intriguing, clever, fascinating present. I am smitten with you.” John giggled some more. His eyelids were growing heavy. Sherlock said nothing, he only stroked the side of John’s face as he faded into sleep.
The song was transitioning into the next, and on the last beat of the bass, Sherlock halted in front of John, nose to nose, hot breath gusting from his mouth. John fisted Sherlock’s hair and brought him down, hard and fast on his mouth. The kiss was a contradiction: filth laced with complete and total admiration. Sherlock clutched the fabric of John’s flannel, pulling him close by the collar.
John raised his eyebrows. “Perfectly? I beg to differ. You are perfect. You’re so… I can’t imagine… how do you…” John’s eyes found Sherlock’s again. They fluttered back and forth, the lighting from the stage casting an angelic glow around the top of his head. John grinned in spite of his humiliation; how suiting the halo was.
, Sherlock considered. John’s suit was a light grey wool, tailored, but not in the way Sherlock’s were tailored. The trousers weren’t slimming through the ankle and the coat didn’t cut in near the waist.
He laughed and pulled off his coat. As he settled into his seat, she sprinted to the back to grab their sandwiches.
?” John thought surely the “d” should have been an “s,” but hey. What did he know? He was a rugby forward, not a hot, writhing, mass of gorgeous muscle.
John slid to the edge of the bed, erection sore and throbbing, and spread his legs. Taking Sherlock’s hand, he guided him between his beat-up knees. Then he placed his hands behind his back. “Pleasure me,” John commanded. He was less careful of his tone this time around, momentarily overwhelmed by undeniable want. All he could think about was Sherlock’s cock down his throat, flipping that perfect creature onto the bed and pulling him apart piece by piece, christening this bedroom with Sherlock’s pleasure, knowing now that no one else had been given the honor. He wanted Sherlock to feel him every time he set foot in this space, to picture them like this each time he happened to glance in the mirror.
He fisted his hair, finally allowing the frustration to seize him. “This is absurd. I can always land my en Rond. Always.”
John’s knees felt like they might collapse. He reached out and steadied himself on the arm of his chair. “You... you rescued me?”
“You are a man of wonderful confidence. How could you possibly doubt the attraction was reciprocated?” He kissed John delicately on the corner of his mouth and pressed on.
“Pint?” Callum looked at him, both reassuring and encouraging. John knew that they hadn’t done their weekly evening out in what felt like ages, and he also knew Callum had been patiently waiting for all this to pass. The captain was hardly in a position to feel otherwise; he had grown quite exhausted of feeling irritable, frustrated, and dealing with this feeling of floundering and/or drowning. He couldn’t decide if he still had his nose above water, or if he even cared.
Sherlock glanced up at the indication of movement. He raised an eyebrow and a small hum left his throat. Speak of the devil, and he shall appear. Captain Watson was growing closer, running at a comfortable sprint. The detective looked back into his mug, trying to drown the thoughts of the way John’s muscles flexed around his bones, what he would look like with a gun poised in his hand, forearms taut from steady, hungry, eager flesh, how he toed off his trainers after PT each morning and slid into the showers. Heat from something other than his drink filled the detective’s abdomen and he groaned in frustration. It took nothing. Literally nothing at all. One, tiny thought. He raised his eyes again at the sound of heavy breathing. The doctor was walking toward him, hands braced on his hips, chest heaving, head tilted back revealing the beautiful hollow of his throat. He took a hand through sweat soaked hair, and then lifted the hem of his shirt to wipe the excess moisture from his brow. Sherlock’s muscles tensed at the tiny revelation of sunkissed skin under John Watson’s perfectly ordinary t-shirt. There was a delicious line of definition right where the captain’s shorts hit his lower half. One perfect indention next to each hip, diving deep and hinting at the strength of Watson’s body. Sherlock wanted to run his tongue there, taste the saltiness of John’s skin, feel his hot, pulsating hands near his ears. He wanted to be the reason Watson was out of breath.
Katherine’s mouth dropped open in shock. Her eyes quickly flooded with fury, though, and she intended to share it with the class. John didn’t give a damn.
“Hello, sweetheart. May I please have two rum and cokes, one for me, and one for my date? And make them strong.” The smile on the waiter’s face faltered a bit as he glanced over to Sherlock, dressed sharply in his typical black suit, his burgundy button up pressed and pulling slightly at the buttons. He gave the waiter a grimace, to which the young boy responded with a look of disbelief. Sherlock chuckled, knowing Joseph, the waiter, was practically screaming
“Hell yeah, she is,” Rhys chimed in. Egan punched him squarely in the shoulder. Rhys’ toast fell out of his mouth. He rubbed his shoulder as he laughed. “Ow! You bastard!”
John stumbled into the room, dropping the hotel key on the desk. Callum was passed out in the bed closest to the window. John clumsily rummaged through his bag to pull out his sleep clothes. His head was spinning with that ever-maddening man, sitting in a booth alone, dressed so casually in track pants and a comfortable sweatshirt, head barely twitching to the beat of his own damn compositions. Who looks that good in a fucking
Sherlock’s hand cupped the side of John’s face. He was being incredibly affectionate, and while John wasn’t complaining in the slightest, it was still...odd. “Would you like to take a trip with me?”
"Yeah," John muttered. "Odd, how sentimental you can become when someone you're supposed to love dies. You try desperately to portray them as something good, even when they weren't." Sherlock remained quiet, allowing John to continue if he wished. He didn't.
“Thank you. For sharing it.” John nodded, not knowing what else to say. “And you’re wrong, by the way. It’s lovely.”
The doorbell rang. Sherlock glanced up at the sound from the sofa, temporarily abandoning Ten and Rose exploring New Earth. “I’ve got it.” John leapt up from his chair and bounded down the stairs. He fished his wallet out of his back pocket as he opened the door.
He pulled on the blue sweater over a tan checked button down, adjusting the collar so it rested properly above the crew neck. He pulled on the nicest pair of gray slacks he had, and laced up his Doc Martens. He assessed himself in the mirror, tightening and loosening his watch band, running a hand through his hair to muss it just a bit. He stepped back, titled his head, and smirked. This was as good as it was going to get.
B opened the door to find Jane bundled up in scarves, coats and a knitted cap. Her cheeks were pink and flushed and she was grinning. The tungsten glow of the outdoor light made her blonde hair orange.
The song shifted, and she kissed his cheek and winked, heading to the bar. John assumed she was getting another round. He lingered awkwardly among the hot bodies. Just as he was about to walk away, cold fingers wrapped around his wrist.
. It was heaven), holding on for dear life for fear that when he opened his eyes, the man would disappear.
Sherlock leaned forward yet again, and gave John a soft kiss. “Gave” was the perfect word, a small present:
“No, I’m sorry. You’re quite right. It isn’t funny at all,” John muttered. Sherlock had wedged his hips in the corner of the counter, both hands wrapped defensively around his cup. John stood and made his way back to the bedroom. Sherlock did not follow him.
Sherlock collapsed into the warm, unmade bed, relishing the feeling of soft sheets against his naked skin. He tucked a pillow into the curve of his neck and reached out to pluck the metal chain of his bedside lamp. The alarm mocked him: 4:32 am. Three hours of sleep would have to be sufficient.

Holmes could admit what he had done in a moment was foolish. His mind had been untreated for months, and one of his infamous black moods had dug nasty, tar colored roots into his heart, spreading and touching everything and everyone that once meant something. He felt nothing and The Work had lost all its allure: it was no longer challenging. MI6 equated to Scotland Yard, but with nicer suits and classier criminals. It’s all the same process, in the end. It was that realization that led Sherlock to up his intake, increase the ante, take his mind to an entirely new level. He had thought it would make things easier. If he was sharper, he could breeze through it all and then, when the real cases came, he would be ready. Hungry, starving even, for real work. But it had not happened that way at all.
There wasn’t a sound. He stood in the living room, trying to record every dust particle, every scrap of paper, every tile on the wall.
John’s eyes widened at the use of his name. B rarely ever used a casual greeting when it came to his captain.
“Well, you weren’t in any photos with me tonight, and I know you want to keep yourself tucked away as much as possible. But I want one. For me. Promise I won’t post it up on any social media.”
“Watching you dance.” Callum’s voice was low and breathy. Molly felt her own stop dead in her chest. She rose to her knees.
Their eyes met; John’s heart exploded. Sherlock’s brows were arched, eyes penetrating, stoicism abandoned. John had never felt so needed in all his life. He was amazed at all the ways Sherlock could communicate what he wanted or needed without ever uttering a single syllable. Holding Sherlock’s eyes with his own, feeling splayed open, he moved his hand between their two tangled bodies. He watched Sherlock read him as if he were printed in large scale text, wonder and lust and something else, so tender and soft and pure, mixed up in those silvered eyes. John leaned forward to kiss Sherlock’s mouth.
The episode played on: John laughed at Cassandra’s words coming from Rose’s mouth and Sherlock murmured at Tennant’s ferocity. The plates were cleared and set on the floor, only small grains of rice and soy sauce left, the glasses in process of being drained. It was a night just like any other for them. Take away and some telly to wind down. The habit was a beautiful thing; some people are habitual about things that don’t matter: putting their socks back in the same place they pulled them from, organizing the refrigerator, washing their hands. This was a routine event that John loved. Feeling Sherlock's gorgeous, baritone laughter behind him, wrapped up warmly in his favorite pyjamas, and knowing that they would crawl into bed together, wake up together, and start the process all over again was the best habit John had ever had.
John blushed. “Thank you. I appreciate it. What is it you lot are working on today?” He pulled out the empty chair next to her. John knew that Kirsten was Jane’s favorite student, though she swore she’d kill him if he ever uttered a word of it. John could see why. Kirsten was a great artist, but John also knew she was a girl of fantastic character. Jane had mentioned a time or two that Kirsten had gone through a bit of rough shit; in a way she reminded John a lot of B. Kirsten had every right to fall apart and blame anyone and everyone that crossed her path. But she was brilliant and kind and pure. John smiled at the blonde’s undercut and the tiny glimmer of her tongue ring as she explained the project to him.
on a major street in downtown Brixton. Who knows how many windows had been looked through at that precise moment.
Then a silhouette took the stage. It was male; tall, lean, and defined. Confident and swift, he moved like a river. John’s eyebrows rose a bit on his forehead. Irene swept her arms in a grand gesture, and strings began. John could hear the cello in particular. It had always been one of his favorites. He watched Irene, as her jaw clenched and her delicate hands instructed hundreds with an insane ferocity. He moved his eyes back to the stage. The silhouette had become a shadow to the music. Every swell of the strings, he moved after them, tugging at the last tiny traces of each note. He moved out of the darkness and into the burgundy lighting. John felt his breath halt in his chest.
John stood at the train station, his arms folded tightly across his chest. Sherlock was being an absolute prick. He was hung over from the night before, and John was exhausted from anxiety and lack of sleep. He breathed deeply and reminded himself to unclench his jaw. His dentist had mentioned he’d crack a molar if he continued on the way he did.
“I am hoping, quite desperately, in fact, the feeling is mutual,” he whispered into Sherlock’s ear. John burrowed his nose into Sherlock’s curls, breathing him in.
And Sherlock gave the briefest of nods. John’s breathing went shallow, and he made a vain attempt to bring himself back down as he casually crossed the room in Sherlock’s direction. He ran a hand through his hair, and kept his eyes on Sherlock. Soon he found himself between the two boys, listening in on the chatter.
“No. I took time from your day. We will do this. I will make this work.” His voice was strung tight like guitar strings that hadn’t had enough time to stretch before being played.
He removed himself and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s chest, trying to regain control of his breathing. “You have to take more cases.”
“That? I think that hardly qualified as proper dancing.” Sherlock rolled his eyes at John’s typically humble and evasive response.
"That's right. Daddy gets to fuck you whenever he wants. No matter where we are. A good little slut will drop her panties whenever Daddy wants."
'Jesus they fucked you up pretty good there didn't they? I'm sorry.' He frowns a bit. 'You want them though don't you. You did when I first met you and the way you look at Danny and Sophia... You'd be a brilliant mum..'
"Fine. You should thank your son for giving a fuck about you. You are no longer in change. I'll handle everything from now on. You're just a figurehead." She snaps at George and leaves the room.
Mycroft takes them both into the secret bedroom and sits them both on the couch, he sits on the stool facing them. “We need to talk, the three of us, about something Sherlock said.” He said softly.
“Hey.” John says softly and caresses Sherlock’s cheek. “It’s okay. We both have a past, yeah? But we’re here now. Together. That’s what’s important.”
She moans loudly and arches as she comes hard, squirting as she feels him blow his huge load right against her cervix.
"This must have cost loads," John comments, taking in the space. "Are towel animals extra?" He's grinning at Sherlock from the end of the bed where he's reached out to touch the swans.
“Yeah that sounds good. I don’t have any supplies though. Mycroft’s guards took everything off me when I came in.” John hums, still inspecting Sherlock’s hands.
"I'm sorry." She stares at the floor, having Mycroft upset at her always felt worse than death to her.
“Such a good boy. You look so good. You’re so fucking sexy. God the things I want to do to you.” She bites at his neck, pulling on his nipples teasingly.
Anxiety pierced through John at the contact. He was between suppressants. No longer able (allowed) to use the military-grade suppressants he had been on, he had to wait before swapping over to the generics from the chemists. He'd been careful, using special soaps aimed at hiding an Omega's scent, but with Sherlock this close, it was dangerous. Especially because he had no clue just how strong the Alpha's senses were.
"Thank you." She smiles. "How come you've never bowled before?" Benny asks and sips his beer as Jean goes to take his turn. "I haven't had a lot of free time in my life to do the things I wanted." She shrugs.
“Matching brass rings. Silver or gold a bit to traditional for you two?” She teases, knowing these rings were perfect for them.
He pulls out of him gently and lays him out on the bed. He presses soft kisses to him as he massages his body.
"None of that." She swats his thigh and removes her fingers. She smirks as she ties his wrists and ankles to the bed. "I decide how you get fucked and when to come. Understand?"
John examines her arm, frowning a bit. "It missed anything important, but it's bleeding an abnormal amount. We should wrap it up."
“I just.. I miss you. And I wanna focus on us for a bit. And I’m not leaving Sherlock and John and the others. Never. But.. I want to be good with my husband.”
John came home. He was tired, a bit grouchy. There had been a couple's fight worthy of Jerry Springer, his coffee maker had broken, and Melinda had called in with a family emergency.
“Mm I don’t know how to get rid of this pent up nervous energy. As soon as that’s gone I’ll pass out.” Sky sighs. “I dunno how to get rid of it. Maybe a work out.”
She leans in and kisses him deeply even though her belly gets in the way. “Do it. Fill me. Come. Knock me up.”
“If you’re going to be on our side you have to be on all our sides. Not just mine or Camille’s because you find out palatable. Crystal saved your life. Let’s just relax.” Sherlock sighs, trying to keep the peace.
Greg gets out of the water, walking over to Mycroft wearing a little speedo that leaves very little to the imagination as drips of water run down his body.
Sherlock returned a few minutes later when his stomach had emptied what little contents they contained.
Sky bites her lip as she watches Nina and the man. The burned man is still unconscious as Turk heals him.
"Never have I ever. Someone asks a question and if you have done what they asked then you drink but if you haven't then you don't drink."
“Are you going to rule or be more diplomatic?” Greg asks softly. “Are you going to let the vampires vote on certain issues?”
“You. You had the spark. I knew you were a fighter.” Mycroft shakes his head. “You had the capacity for more. The humans always try and cure themselves. I knew they’d come up with something eventually.”
He closes his eyes, pushing his head up to take all of Collin's cock into his mouth, his nose nuzzling against his pubes.
‘I changed back for Cecil and Sherlock. They fucked my face and care in my cunt. Whatever you want.’
“Because I thought you were happy! Because I thought you loved her! Because I thought you chose her! I wanted you to be happy so I did whatever I could to make sure you were happy. I…” Sherlock bites his lips. “John… I have something to tell you and you’re not going to like it.”
The horse bows his head for him to pet. All of the animals were a bit excited after shelling sky enter the facility and he was no exception.
Greg nods. He helps John out and helps to get Giselle into the back of the car. “Don’t wake her until she’s back there. Do you have a syringe?” He asks.
Sherlock nods and wriggles out of his pants. He moves back between John’s legacy kissing him deeply as he wraps his hand around both of them.
"Off you pop. then." Mycroft winks. "Files of what you need to know will be... added to your case file library."
Benny pulls his fingers out of him and Jean pulls Michael on top of him. "Ride me." Jean bites at his throat.
Mycroft smirks. "Oh, pet, you should tell him yourself. You need to learn to use your words. I'll start for you, but I want you to finish it, okay?"
She blinks a bit and nods, knowing he couldn’t be insinuating what she thinks he is. “Sure. You know I’m always up for lending a hand.” She smiles, slipping in her own innuendo.
John sighs. “We’ll come over.” He says softly. “I’ll see you later mum.” He says before hanging up the phone. “I’m guessing you heard all that.” He says, looking up at Sherlock.
“Hello..” Rachel blushes brightly as she looks down at Mycroft, her blushes showing through her skirt.
He pushes in beside Eli, thrusting up hard. He latches onto one of her nipples, eagerly drinking from her.
"Girl," John smiles, "I argued that I wanted to toss out all the baby clothes we wouldn't need. Which reminds me...." John turns to Mycroft and cocks his head.
He bites his lip. "I ah.. Just took a shower." He lies, really just uncomfortable with his chest and not wanting Sky to see him like that.
John listens to her explain everything she shows him and after half an hour of compliments, he finally gets to his feet. "Well, I should get going. I'll pick you up after lunch tomorrow." He says, getting his jacket and slipping it on.
Sherlock hums, for all the alone time Hank and Joann had spent together he knew they hadn’t actually had sex aside from their rebonding. He could see the signs of sexual abuse Jacob inflicted on Joann while she was captive. He makes a mental note to tell Mycroft to find the best counsellors for Hank and Joann to help with their trauma.
He moans as he kisses her, tasting himself again from when she sucked him off. "Christ, I've never tasted myself before.."
Sherlock watched John sleep, feeling like things were okay for the first time in days. He picked up his phone and texted Angelo, telling him to reserve the whole restaurant for a private sitting, just for him and John, for tomorrow night. He was going to woo John if it killed him.
John kisses him back. “Why don’t you get changed in the tent, I’m going to put some protective spells around us so nothing comes along and gets us.” He suggests, kissing Sherlock again.
"I've missed you, and them." He whispers. "I wish they were still little so we could pull them into bed with us like we used to do during storms."
"Mm it's alright. There's just nothing going on in there at the moment. You'll probably know before I do." She giggles, rinsing her hair.
He rubs his sides soothingly and kisses over the marks he made on his neck. "Such a good boy. I love you so much.." He mumbles into his skin.
He frowns and bites his lip. "I just.. My mind isn't working the way it usually does.. There're too many emotions going on at once and I don't know how to process them.."
"So, you said my dad wants to meet your parents? That... should be fun. God, your parents will faint to see how chaotic the whole Watson clan is. An Alpha who doesn't care what his Omega or children are doing as long as they're happy and safe? No rules, no orders, just family. Not that your parents are terrors. But... they expect order."
George smirks, kneeling next to Sky. “Fills you up nicely doesn’t it? He used to fill me up just like this back in Uni.”
"Mm good a shower is needed because between my legs is a sticky mess and my arse is deliciously sore. What more could a bloke ask for?" Greg chuckles and kisses Sherlock. He rolls out of bed and stretches.
Joann slowly calms down, holding onto him tightly. “Our pups are all grown up. Having their own pups..”
“Look at you, Mikey. Fucking your pregnant daughter. Fucking her so hard. Look at you. Knocking her up. Right now. Your cum swimming around inside her. Our cum. She’s going to carry yours and my child. Your daughter is such a slut. Your raised a breeding whore, Mikey. Just a dirty little girl begging to be used and filled with babies. Look what you’ve done.” Sherlock growls and bites his neck as he fucks him even harder.
“I’m good. Well we’re good.” She smiles and rubs her belly, having given up her tight office clothes for maternity wear. “I’ve missed you.” She blushes a bit.
Mycroft presses his hand against her panties, humming. “Mm. You’re ruining these, dear. So wet for Daddy.”
John comes back down a few minutes laters wearing flannel sleeping pants and carrying a pillow. He doesn’t wear a shirt to bed anymore because he always rips them in he has a nightmare. “Umm.. So if I start to.. Start to have a nightmare just get away from me. I don’t want to hurt you.” He says as he comes into Sherlock’s room.
“Wanna see if he’ll take it? I switched nipples and he stayed asleep so he doesn’t mind. Plus I’ve caught him eyeing you.” She smirks a bit.
John stirs slightly but stays asleep. Mycroft and Sherlock are still fast asleep, Sherlock cuddled close to Mycroft's chest.
Sherlock is the first to come, he cries out loudly as he fills Morna with his cum. His whole body shakes as he comes, his belly bouncing on Morna.
“Mm I am a breeding whore, aren’t I? How about you you pick people to knock me up at the club? Call people, pick strangers, whatever you want. I just want to be full of cum and babies. As many as possible.”
“You know if someone told me in the beginning we’d end up snuggling on a couch with a new puppy... well I never would have believed them,” John says.
Mycroft smiles softly. "Well, I don't know how long I'll last, doing the penetrating." He murmurs, softly. "Maybe we'll be in similar situations."
Lydia kisses her back and smiles softly. Greg smiles and nuzzles Mycroft. John smiles and shakes his head happily. Lydia finally noticed them and she makes a small squeaking sound and blushes brightly.
Sherlock nods. “There will probably be humans guarding the ashes as well.” He says, not wanting to speak ill of his Sire.
Mycroft wrenches his eyes open again, unaware that they had closed, and looks up at his lover with a heated gaze.
He smiles and takes his hand, leading him to the dance floor. He didn't care what anyone thought about their strange relationship anymore, he was happy.
John smiles and steps up to her, hugging her gently. “We’re glad you like it.” He says, kissing her cheek.
Chloe relaxes against Zack and holds his hand. Sky holds Chloe's other hand and turns each of the contractions into mini orgasms. "How are we doing?" Gita smiles.
“Yes… I just… ” John shook his head. “Never mind, let’s just enjoy this and focus on our date. That sounds so weird to me! Our date! But you know, I have to admit something. That first night, when I was asking you… and you thought I was making a pass and then I said I wasn’t… I really was,” he gave a shy smile. “And I… ” he paused for a moment, listening. “Sorry, this music… this piece of music… I’m sorry, I’m so distracted. But the food… the music… the restaurant I’m… feeling like… ” John closed his eyes. Things were speeding around in his head and he couldn’t string a thought or a sentence together.
The grin that explodes across Benjamin's face is bright enough to light up a room, "brilliant. What about this weekend?"
Mycroft pulls out his fingers and rams his cock inside her, their wet skin slapping together as he fucks her as hard as he can.
"Huh. When I first met her she wouldn't even give most guys the time of day. I guess she's more comfortable now."
"Okay. I'm sorry. I promise I won't use John's nickname for you anymore. Is there something else you would want me to use then?" She chuckles and rests her cheek on her fist.
Greg looks wrecked and he's shaking a bit. "I-I'm so s-sorry.. I-I can't e-even being to a-apologize enough.." His voice shakes violently and he can barely talk.
Mycroft sighs. "You know I can't answer that honestly." He murmured. "But I've put him in charge of looking after John, so hopefully he'll be too occupied."
Camille steps in and smiles softly at Anthea, opening her arms slightly for a hug if Anthea wanted one.
John's last bit of self control disintegrates as he opens his legs and ruts against Sherlock's knee. "Sherlock.." He moans softly.
Camille detangles herself from the ropes and follows Crystal, she shouts “Dormi!” as loud as she can, making Crystal sleep. She grabs her by the ankle and drags her to the basement, chaining her up to the wall in silver, knowing that she will be in pain, but not seriously harmed. She gets a glass of blood and places it just out of her reach, before leaving. The heavy lead door stopping Crystal’s powers to speak with Mycroft or anyone else outside the basement.
Ms. Cheyenne giggles as Eli and Greg argue over who gets to fuck her cunt. She sits on the edge of the counter, her legs spread and waiting for them.
With the help of his mother, John gets dinner and the cake finished in time. Joann also goes and spends time with Tara, much to John's relief.
"Good thing I didn't have my hands down my pants, mum just came out. I think dad just made her laugh."
She frowns and bites her lip. "I don't know.. I told him about it a few days ago to let him know I was going to have it done and he said he'd come along. It's not like a made him promise to go. He was tired from being with John." She shrugged.
Margaret shrugs. “I maintain a house. John fought for our lives. How many times has he saved you? Or thought he had saved you?” She asks.
"Mm I would love to hear you." Eli smiles, giving Michael his full attention. "We should go to karaoke." Veronica hums.
"I don't know.." Mycroft frowns. Sky turns around and looks at them blankly. She leaves the entrance hall and walks down the corridor.
“Perfect little greedy cockslut for us.” Steve smirks, wrapping his big hand around his cock and stroking him. “So perfect.” Cecil smirks and starts to stretch him.
"That was.. A gallon of cum. At least." She mewls, massaging her belly that's even more bloated than before. "I already look pregnant." She purrs and grins happily, running her hands over her body. "I must have 20 big loads of cum in me at least. From who knows how many men. Fuck." She mewls and squirms a bit, always horny.
"Yes. You have the skills and background to do it...you can take care of yourself. I won't tell you what to do." Sherlock replied.
“Relax your cunt for him. He’s a big one.” He snaps his hips, reaching down to rub her throat again.
“Head of security actually.” Duke smirks, knowing how his voice makes people feel. Anthea whimpers as Mycroft’s cock twitches inside her, rocking her hips needy.
"So green spaghetti," Rosie says, looking down at the dish of Christmas colors. She picks up her fork and swirls some of it before popping it into her mouth. She chews thoughtfully, both her parents holding their breath as they await the verdict, before swallowing and giving a nod. "A successful experiment." She announces.
Sherlock frowns and squeezes Mycroft’s hand. He knows that if anything happens to Mycroft, he will follow the same way, with or without John by his side. “I will always be here to help you, Sire. We’ve got through it once before, we can do it again.” He says, sounding more confident that he feels.
He lets out a small relieved sigh, nodding. “Alright. I’d like to have a word with her at some point.”
Magdala sighs and wraps her arm around John. “Son, it’s okay. He’ll get over it.” She says softly. “He’s just upset that he can’t help.”
“I want John to be happy and you make John happy. And I like you so far.” Sherlock smiles softly. “Tell me what you like, mm? You didn’t get to come.”
‘Oh it’s just a game. Besides they’re having a great time. When they’re done they’ll go home and fuck for a few hours before passing out.’ Sky smiles.
John showed them in. "She's got a fair amount of cigar burns on her upper body, and probably elsewhere in various states of healing. She's been abused for all of her marriage, so she's very skittish. Be cautious."
Mycroft smiles shyly. "I'm sorry." He murmurs softly, for what seems the umpteenth time. "Would you believe bad habits?" He murmured, after a pause.
Sherlock put his arms around John, pulled him closer and kissed him back like his life depended on it, because in reality, it did.
“You can ask whatever you want. Any question. No matter how silly or invasive you may think it is. I reserve the right not to answer is all.”
Mycroft nods. “I feel you may understand her more than I do at this point. What she’s going through.” He says softly. “Will you be okay, my dear?” He asks.
Collin arches and whines as Greg starts to stretch him as John stretches Sherlock. Mycroft licks and suck his way into Sherlock's mouth.
"Hands please." She holds out her hands and they're covered in numbers up to her elbows of all the people who gave her their phone numbers at the club the night before.
Camille sighs. ‘I know. But do you know where you’re going? There’s a large community of vampires in Asia. You could head up the safe haven there if you like.’ She offers softly. ‘Come back here, I can help.’
George’s moans only get louder at that, the idea of more people finding him like this turning him on even more.
Udos smiles and holds Sherlock’s hips gently. “Is it too much?” He asks softly, stroking his thumb over Sherlock’s skin.
"Mum, with Sherlock off well, being Sherlock, I was wondering if you'd want to sit in on my next doctor's appointment? Mycroft said he can arrange for me to have my scan here. We're just waiting on a date and time."
Collin takes out his fingers and slicks his cock. He slowly pushes into Greg making John groan loudly.
“I know that but I also know having certain things in the flat makes you feel better. Like that one biscuit with the swirls. You don’t eat them but if I don’t bring them home I know you look for them in the bags.” John chuckles as they go down the stairs.
“Mycroft probably had his goons sit in it just to mess up my imprint.” Sherlock follows John over to their chairs.
Darius kisses and nips around her breast before taking her nipple into his mouth, sucking as his other hand travels down. He runs his hand over her body slowly and gently rubs his fingers over her clit as he swallows the milk that fills his mouth. Sky arches in to his mouth and moans loudly, trembling already.
"Small town, more... superstitious than religious. But, yeah, we went to church. Some of us more than others. My family just did the major holidays, or if mum and dad got into a spat and they felt guilty." John clarifies while pressing his weight against Sherlock's shoulder.
“I won’t let anything happen to you.” John holds Sherlock close, igniting a flame in his palm to see.
Sherlock kisses his jaw. "I'm glad Mycroft has you.. You're brilliant. I lov--" He hesitates slightly, stuttering as he tries to cover up his slip up. "He. He loves you."
John strips, leaving his clothes on the ground as he dives into the pool. "James should be out soon."
"Yes it is. Viper is my.. What term do you prefer today, buttercup?" Sky asks Viper. "Girlfriend." Viper hums. "Viper is my girlfriend." Sky nods.
Sherlock nods. “That’s okay. I hope Camille understands though. No one's ever turned down her offer before.” He says softly.
"Bit of everything really." John explains, "I've done surgery, worked accident and emergency, done paperwork and I've even been put in charge to oversee newer doctors who've just finished school. The change up has been nice, keeps my mind occupied and focused."
Greg smirks and goes to fill his glass again. He takes out the ginger snaps and puts Sherlock's finished tray of sugar cookies into the oven.
He moans and gropes her tits, squeezing and playing with them. "Fuck, they're so big.." he groans, leaning in to suck on one of her nipples.
"I should go find her. She probably has a huge list of things for me to do. You guys should go down to the center of camp. The grannies are cooking and they'd love to feed you up." David smiles.
Sabine was quiet for a moment. "Heart attack." She said finally. "The doctor said it was a too fatty diet, plus the alcohol and cigars." She sounded sad, but wasn't crying. "I think he just had too much hate in his life." She sighed softly.
“Of course I’ll volunteer, Watson.” Sherlock grins, loving the museum especially when he takes Rosie. “How was school?”
"Mm I do hope you're talking about me." Chloe purrs as she comes up behind Zack and wraps her arms around his waist.
Mycroft sighs. “I can’t figure out what he took. John just texted me. He said Sherlock came to for a bit.”
“Mm no. You need all this food for when Loral helps you grow. The growing will burn off all your energy. You’ll be starving after.” John kisses Sherlock.
"Mm I needed it. I wanted your cock inside me constantly. The plug was the only think keeping me sane.." He moans when he's finally sunk all the way down on John's cock.
"You're welcome, hun." He smiles. "Sometimes we just need little breaks to drown out the roar of the world."
When the food was gone, John tried not to make a big deal over Sherlock offering to help clean up. Instead, he just passed Sherlock the tea towel and let him dry the dishes.
“I don’t care about the timing of our pups. It is the furthest thing from my mind. I would not take it back for a single moment. I would not change one detail of how they came to be. I know you may have a hard time seeing me as anything other than a chaotic addict who thrives off solving gruesome murder cases and such but what I am doing not is not only to keep you and our pups safe but to make sure they can grow up in a world where a spider like Moriarty won’t snap them up and sell them off to the highest bidder. That is my duty as their father. As their alpha. To keep them safe and protect them from the evil maladies of this world. I cannot physically carry them. I cannot feel them inside me. I cannot keep them safe inside myself as you can so I must do it from the outside. I must make this world a more habitable place for them to grow up in because I will not let them face the same hellscape that you had to navigate.” Sherlock takes a step closer to John.
John chuckles, shaking his head. "And here I was thinking you liked taking orders." He murmured, teasing.
Sally blushes when she sees it, rocking against the large plug Sherlock pushes into her cunt so none of his cum would leak out.
“I still have you, neither of us are dead or in a coma, I think this was a successful day.” Sherlock takes the cup.
"Like your broad chest.." He drags his fingers over his chest. "Your strong arms.." Over his arms. "Your fit torso.." Across his stomach. "Your irresistible hips.." He rubs John's hips. "Your brilliant arse.." Moving his hands to squeeze John's arse. "And of course.. your huge, gorgeous cock.." He licks his lips, slowly stroking John from base to tip once.
“We can go out together. I should think.” Sherlock says softly. “I’ll need to check with my Sire though. Why don’t you get changed? You’ve bled over this jumper.”
‘Mm yeah. Come pick us up.’ Sky purrs softly, nuzzling into the neck of the man holding her. “What’s you’re name?”
“I didn’t know you had such a big cock, Daddy.” He whimpers and wraps his legs around him, holding onto his father in law.
“A naval academy I think. She was a second lieutenant when Mycroft persuaded her away.” Sherlock shrugged. “Why? Going to try and sleep with her, too? I thought she already rebuffed you.”
‘Mm I can feel them.’ She purrs, rubbing her nose against her clit as she fucks her with her tongue.
When they get back, John hands Gina her coffee and then discards the carrier. He quickly devours the sticky bun, only sharing two bites of it with Rosie before it's gone. "God, I needed coffee. I thought I was going to lose it today with the crazy amount of kids who signed up for this thing."
"To tell you the truth, darling. He was always there. I just needed it to be the right time for me to be with him." She smiles softly and blushes a bit.
"Oh, but you'd look so cute with big hairy feet." She snorted. "Going on an adventure? Seems to be right up your street... Hell, I'll bet that Sherlock Holmes is a bit of a dragon to live with. The amount of time I heard his ringtone go today, he seems a mite possessive about you."
“You’ve gotta start letting them be there for you, Greg. They can’t help if you don’t let them.” She says softly.
Crystal moans, sinking her fangs into Mycroft’s shoulder and watching the blood run like a river before letting it drip into her mouth.
John shifts a bit closer, gently scootching the pups closer to their father. Theadora complains when her milk supply disappears but quickly quiets when John helps guide her back. When John settles again, the only space left between him and his mate is the space taken up by their three pups.
“I was still hard from his show, which sitting in your lap after didn’t help. Think he saw how I was and asked me to dance with him. I had to try to stay in control and not let my cock brush against him.” He flops back onto the bed. “Swear, I would’ve come in my pants if that lap dance he did lasted any longer.”
“Reign.” Crystal smiles softly. “After She was born her father took her from me. Sold her into slavery as a baby. After I was turned I got her back. I raised her the best I could. She got married. Had a child. She.. She died in childbirth and there was nothing I could do to save her. There was no technology all the way back then. I wasn’t trained. The baby lived. I raised it. A girl. Every child descended from Reign has been a girl. All the way down to my great great, granddaughter. Her name is Luna and she lives in London.” She smiles softly.
"No I'm not. Because.." She sighs still not realizing Zack is up. "It would be a bit difficult to bring someone home since I haven't asked anyone, mum. Yes I know you're not getting any younger and neither am I. I will give you grandchildren when I find someone I want to have them with. No. Because! Well it's not like I try and scare them off!" She whines.
Sherlock chuckles softly and nuzzles John. “Makes sense. You are carrying a pup and or pups so it would be easier for you to handle things I like. Comforting at least.” He kisses John tenderly. “I don’t know how many. It’s probably far too soon to make a distinction. I wonder if it will smell different? If you’re carrying multiples.”
Sherlock blinked. "Oh..." He scurried off to the bathroom. He came back with a few packs of needles and a sharps container. "Now thats everything."
"I don't sell man!" The addict says. "We don't care about that now where did you get it!" Greg snaps. "The distributor! She.. She just gave a couple us junkies samples to hand out to close friends! She didn't charge or anything! She just told us not to take it. Give it out and start hyping it up as the best thing on the streets." The addicts says terrified. "Name and address." Greg growls. The addict gives the address. "That's right around the corner!" Greg says and radios the drug division.
"Mm you're so desperate for it aren't you?" She purrs and rubs her clit, rocking her hips and teasing them both.
“He can’t sleep on the couch, Sherlock. He has to sleep with one of us. We don’t have a baby monitor to listen to him.”
The tailor looked up in the mirror and smiled. He'd made yet another Alpha crazy with lust for their omega with just a change of clothes.
Sherlock nodded, letting out a breath he didn't even know he was holding. "I.. A-Alright.. Thank you, John..."
“You wouldn’t be using me anymore than I’m already using you.” Sherlock hums, rubbing John’s back. “And it wouldn’t be using. We’d be keeping each other alive for each other. I think it’s somewhat romantic.”
"I'll go in this stall and strip and send my clothes over and you go in the one next to me and do the same." She smiles and goes into the stall.
He strips down the rest of the way as well. He kisses George deeply and giggles before jumping into the pool.
Sherlock strips down to his pants and crawls into the very large bed with John and Greg. He snuggles against John's chest as Greg spoons John.
Sherlock sighs. “The man in the car was my older brother. Today’s detour will certainly not be the last.”
"Hey mum," John says as if he hadn't just been talking about her. "What can I do to help? And if you say dishes again I swear I'll cry like I'm four again."
Mycroft smiles. "Good evening, Gregory." He murmured, softly, taking the man's hand and squeezing gently.
She smiles and nods. "Why are you so bloody tall?" She has to get up and kneel on the edge of the bed so she can clean the rest of the incision.
“Would you.. You’d you mind if I kisses you? You just have gorgeous lips and I want to know what they feel like.” He blushes, a buff tall little dork.
‘Yeah. Four from him, three from you, and surprisingly one from Peter.’ She smiles softly and looks up for a kiss.
“Okay.” Greg nods and pulls his fingers out of himself. “I’m going to be honest and tell you that I usually don’t last very long when I’m being penetrated.” He chuckles softly.
Greg stretches him and rubs against his prostate. "I love to make you cry out like that.." He moans.
John nods. He leaves five babies in Mycroft, knowing he enjoyed carrying a lot. Before he moves onto Sherlock.
John watches Sherlock, tiredly. "I hope you're right, Sherlock..." He murmured, taking one of the man's larger hands in his.
“Your voice is different when you speak different languages but I could listen to them all day everyday.”
“That’s right. My greedy little cockslut.” He rubs the tip over her lips as he gets closer, cock throbbing against her lips.
"Mm you're so pretty on your knees.." John hums and pets his hair as he twirls the crop lightly over his nipple.
"Mm what I want is to be fucked nice and slow and then sleep for a week." She mumbles, nearly delirious.
“I do but.. Just the thought of you putting your cock into someone else makes me want to set the house on fire.” Leona blushes.
“I had my suspicions before. At school, do you remember your little friend Josie Brennon? Well, some of the boys were picking on her because she had glasses. Your teacher called me to pick you up. Apparently, you had gotten into a fight. I was shocked. My sweet boy who kisses boo-boos and liked to help me in the kitchen got into a fight. So your dad and I went down there. The first thing you said was “I’m sorry, Mummy. I tried to talk to them but they wouldn’t stop so I had to make them stop.” I was so surprised and proud. You didn’t join in with the little alpha boys making fun of her. You stood up for your friend and defended her.”
"I should cuff you to that bed and fuck you for ages. You won't be allowed to come and if you do I'll punish and fuck you again until you get it right." He growls and bites his shoulder.
She moans and arches. "I-I want you to take me from behind. I want you to grip my hips hard and pound me into the mattress."
“I think we can help with that. Can’t we, Sherlock?” Jason smirks. “Certainly.” Sherlock nods and smirks.
John's hand cards through Sherlock's hair.  He slides his tongue against Sherlock's. He moans and holds Sherlock's hip. "Christ." John gasps as he comes up for air.
“Well you can get a pump that collects the milk. Like how they milk cows. Or someone can drink it. The leaking happens because it’s to full. Like when a water ballon gets a really tiny hole and the water trickles out.”
He growls and pushes back against him, clawing at his back. "Greg.." He bites his lip and kisses him back.
Lestrade shrugged. "We need his help, and if he needs you, then I don't see the problem. Just wear gloves, yeah? *Anderson, for Christ sake, take the lens cap off that fucking camera!*" He sighed deeply. "She's toward the front of the church. Up there." He gestured.
Sherlock smiles as he unties John and takes off his blindfold with a gentle kiss. “What do you want me to do, Master?” He asks softly.
"You're already thinking about university?" John sucks in a breath, "she's still my baby girl and already you’re thinking about sending her away to university."
“He’s so tight, Mycroft. His tight little virgin cunt.” Cecil groans as he pounds into his womb. “I’ll have my turn with it later. Right now his throat his so hot and wet I can’t stop leaking.” Mycroft moans.
Sherlock bites his fist to keep from crying out as he comes hard into John’s mouth and down his throat.
Mycroft and Greg continue to thrust into him. "We should just tie you to the bed and use you whenever the urge hits us. You're always so open and ready. So needy for our cocks. You don't know what to do with yourself if you don't have them." Collin smirk as John pushes into Sherlock's arse along with Mycroft.
The door shuts with a solid click with Anthea left outside to make sure no one disturbs them. Mycroft walked to the wall, where a series of buttons sat on a panel. Pressing one, he steps back and folds his hands behind his back, reminding John so much of Sherlock it sent a pang through his chest. A green light turns on in the other room and it doesn't take long for one of the medical team members to notice it. Mycroft looks over at the family, then directs his question to Joann.
“Sherlock.” John frowns and scoops him up. “Are you okay? Are you hurt?” He checks Sherlock over, feeling his belly.
Sherlock stills in John’s lap, holding onto him tightly as he comes hard into his hand, letting out a choked off sob of a moan.
She smiles and hugs him back. "I won't let anything happen to any of you. I promise. Mycroft doesn't have to worry about me. Everything will work out the way it's supposed to." She mumbles into Greg's chest.
Sherlock suppressed a small smirk. Trust John to be thinking of "his" feelings all this time. "John... I... I only said those things because I didn't know you well enough. I've..." He sighed. "I've harboured feelings for you for quite some time.... I'm rubbish at showing it." He snuck a look at his flatmate.
She nods. “I think that they can have cognitive behavioral therapy. Some of them will have to remain in hospitals and such but they’ll get better hopefully.”
Sherlock wakes in the middle of the night from a nightmare. He panics slightly, trying to sit up. He's held down by Mycroft's arms and he whimpers, squirming.
Mycroft whimpers and locks eyes with John as he pushes his entire hand into his arse. His mouth falls open in a silent moan, his face contorting in desperation.
When Rosie returned she had three stuffed animals and her favorite blanket in her arms. She brought them over by crawling into the fort. "Wow." She dropped the teddies and looked around the space Sherlock had created. "It's like a cave."
“Ah.” Greg nods and finishes his order, the waitress taking it to the kitchen. “I’m sure you’ve got more than enough experience to beat anyone out. You kept Sherlock safe so that’s something.” He chuckles.
“Oh believe me you’ll be dripping and drained by the time we’ve finished.” Dorro chuckles and kisses Sherlock as he lays him on the bed, their tongue parting Sherlock’s lips and sliding against Sherlock’s tongue.
“Look at you. Trying to seem so soft and innocent.” John chuckles and rubs his thumb over Sherlock’s cheekbone.
“I can take as many as I like.” Morna grins and kisses Sherlock deeply. “Mm you know since you’re a human male I can carry your babies as well as John’s.”
“I don’t like seeing you like this.” He mumbles. He had found several more stashes of papers and even some interviews with other couples, anonymous.
“*Aucun mot autre que l'os désir profond de joindre mon esprit, mon corps et mon âme au vôtre jusqu'à ce que le soleil brûle du ciel et tombe à travers le vide du temps.*” Greg says softly, nearly a whisper. (“No word other than the bone deep desire to join my mind, body and soul to yours until the sun burns from the sky and falls through the void of time.”)
Chloe frowns a bit but nods, not wanting to push her. 'What's wrong, kid? I can hear your brooding in my sleep.' Zack's voice hums in Sky's head.
“I will, darling. But watching you eat is a feast for my eyes.” John smiles, feeding Sherlock other juicy delicate fruits.
“John..” Greg says softly. “You’re putting way too much pressure on yourself. You and Sherlock are basically starting over with baggage already on board. You have to cut yourself some slack. You’ve both changed.” He shrugs. “What’s something that you two used to fight about that’s better now or changed?”
"She'll be fine. She can take care of herself believe me." Jean starts the car and heads towards Michael's flat.
"Hi," John smiles and has to fight the urge to help the woman. "Just heard from Sherlock. Things are okay with them. He said they'll check in as soon as they can."
She blushes and closes her eyes, focusing on his lips and hands as she slowly sinks down onto his cock.
"I just want to help, Mum." He whispers, "and I know I can't... I get that' there's a line we can't cross because I'm your son. I'm not trained in mental health, but I do understand some of it. So, let me be your ray of sunshine? When you need to smile, come to me. We can go shopping for the pups, or get you some new clothes. The house will need some updating as well."
Anthea looks at Mycroft before getting up. She walks over to Harry and straddles her lap before sinking her fingers into Harry’s hair. “You’ve had a very long and hard few days. What you need is to relax and decompress.” She starts to massage Harry’s scalp as she sits in her lap. She can feel Mycroft watching her like a hawk and she loves it when he watches her.
"They expect me to stand over an empty grave and pretend Sherlock is dead. What for? Jim knows he's alive, and Jacobs has no form of communication with anyone. It's like they're trying to be so clever it doesn't even make sense to them. I don't want to do this."
“From when Moriarty owned me. The files are on the things I did for him. The things he made me do. The files are on the things they knows I did for sure. They don’t have everything but they have enough. More than enough.”
Sherlock’s voice rose, quick and near bellowing: “You are risking your life for Queen and Country. If you are recruited, you will surely serve a tour in Afghanistan. Of course, your squadron will benefit greatly from your presence there, but you will rot. Of all the things you could choose to do, I cannot understand how this is what you think you want. You are worthy of so much more. They will not appreciate you, they will not take care of you, and if you die, all we will get is an indifferent letter, possibly your dog tags, and maybe a limb or two. I’m sorry it upsets you, but I cannot support that.”
“I’m guessing you like it black or with two sugars. Are either correct or am I completely off point?”
So why did this man turn John’s blood into magma? He was a sexual man. He acknowledged and tended to his needs. He credited himself to being a fierce lover, a generous one, too, and got off on getting others off. All John could think of was being between Sherlock’s thighs… being the cause of that heaving chest, that perfectly arched back on his mattress back at the flat, the sweat on his hot flesh. Ah, fuck. Twenty-eight years and finally indulging in the male form? Nearly fifteen of them had been infused with strong, attractive and talented men. Why now? Why Sherlock Holmes?
“Though the pattern of the scarring will be beautiful...” John thumbed the flesh above Sherlock’s right wrist once again, tracing each one. They formed a sort of checkerboard, two long slices running parallel to his veins, three smaller ones crossing over horizontally. Sherlock, for once in his life, couldn’t muster up a quip in response to John’s mildly offensive but somehow incredibly intimate comments. He felt cornered and suddenly wished it had been different: that he wasn’t the man John had deduced he was; that he was a better man. At the moment, all he felt was a bit not good.
Sherlock was on his feet shoving things into his bag. His voice came out twisted and bitter. “That is what I said, Molly. Do keep up.”
Sherlock wiggled the key into the lock of 221b, laughter spilling out of his beautiful mouth. John was pink-cheeked and buzzing. The door swung open and they began to trod up the stairs.
Well, modesty was no trait of Sherlock’s, that’s been confirmed. He did seem surprised at the compliment, though. “I only played sax for a few years, so I can’t comment on much. Only that it was wonderful to listen to. I wanted to learn piano, but I don't have the hands for it.” John flexed and wiggled his short, callused fingers.
Sherlock spun and glared death daggers. John laughed aloud, covering his mouth with his hand. His eyes were twinkling with amusement. "How was the market?" He breathed out, trying to stifle the giggles bubbling deep in his chest, begging to wiggle out.
“You saved my life. I’ll make you whatever I damn well please. Now. Bedtime story. Tell me how you found me.”
Sherlock watched John’s face carefully, looking for a clue. He wasn’t sure what he meant by the question. How are the wounds physically? How are you emotionally? Should I worry? Do you need medication? When is the last time we wrapped them? Do you think it wise to have a coat on over them? Am I doing my job well enough for you?
John was back to his feet, about half a meter from Sherlock, when he knelt to one knee and extended his hand to Sky. She grabbed it, kissed it, and stepped into the circle, combat boots already moving in a swift rhythm. John stalked up to Sherlock, breathless, pink and winded, and grinned.
, smiled at him. Callum sat his bag down in the sitting room, and strolled up to her at the stove. She felt the heat pouring from his body as he bent down to kiss her lovingly where her neck and shoulder met.
Molly pulled out her mobile and stood from the couch. Jane and John stood side by side, both holding up a half-full glass of whiskey on the rocks, and grinned for a photo.
“I will not leave you, Sherlock. Don’t even try to convince me otherwise. I don't care how miserable you try to make me. One more day of a life with you is worth a million days of a life I would lead alone. I’d never trade it.” He planted a small kiss on Sherlock’s pursed lips. “I choose you. Over and over, I do.” He kissed him again, and felt Sherlock slacken under the touch. John lifted his arms to cradle the face of his precious detective. Pale arms wrapped around John’s neck and pulled him downward.
“What he means to say is that I’ve been a selfish prick as of late, and he’s been too good of a man to tell me to sod off.” Jess nodded, as though she understood exactly what he meant, and flashed another smile.
“Ah. I see. What subject do you teach?” Jane’s eyes moved to John’s face. He was beaming. Clever Sherlock. She liked him.
“I was just going to sit on the couch and watch telly, so if you wanted company, I’d love to have some?”
“Good morning.” John turned away and made for the sugar. As he stirred in two spoonfuls, he looked back to Sherlock and smiled. “Would you like a cuppa?”
John ran his fingertips along the curve of the seat, the quilted stitches silky against his callouses. The wind swept in through the windows, and John watched as it picked up Sherlock’s curls and sent them dancing wildly about his face. The man was a vision in any scenario. “Are you going to tell me where we’re going?” he asked quietly, relishing the look of excitement on his boyfriend’s face.
John finished the last spoonful of his chocolate pudding. The nurse had stirred him awake to eat, now that he was well enough for mostly solid foods. He pushed the tray away and rested back into his pillow. Before he decided to return to his most popular hobby as of late (sleeping), an envelope caught his eye.
Molly exited the cab with ease. She was one hell of a woman, and John loved her for Callum. She was a fascinating combination of grace and clumsiness, innocence and fervor. Her silver heels clacked on the sidewalk as she led the way to Marylebone, peering over her right shawl-covered shoulder. The grin plastered across her face warmed John’s heart. It honestly had not mattered either way whether he won the wager and came tonight, but he knew it would please Molly, and that had been more than enough to convince him to follow through. Callum walked next to him, one step for John’s every two. Everett’s green eyes watched his fiancé with untouched adoration. John could tell he was tracing the straps of Molly’s pewter colored dress, resting on her shoulders in particular, before following down to admire her calves. John looked away and gave Callum the privacy. Oddly enough, being with them never made John feel lonely. Katherine didn’t appreciate the pair of them the way John did. She didn’t listen to Molly when she spoke, didn’t look Callum in the eye when he tried to explain a play, or the rules of rugby. She was fun, but she wasn’t a Molly. Sometimes John wondered if anyone would see him settled. He liked being the good time; loved it, in fact. The thought of him planting roots somewhere and being with one person for an extended period of time was a curious one. He mulled it over as he entered through the glass doors of the venue. Marble floors covered the expanse of the interior, silver fixtures and a large, crystal chandelier setting off prisms across the walls and John’s gray suit. It was luxurious in an understated way, and John chuckled at the absolute contradiction of the thought.
Sherlock stood with his hands shoved deep into the Belstaff. He was looking at anything other than John. The train began to roar into the station and the wind from it blew Sherlock’s curls away from his face. They danced, momentarily suspended in the air.
Molly yanked her head up to find Callum sitting in a middle row of the theater, feet propped up on the back of a seat and arms folded across his chest. She sat up straight, and chuckled. “Hi.”
Soo Lin was his best bet thus far. The last audition took the stage. Sherlock opened Jim Moriarty’s file and thumbed through his impressive and extensive resume. Sherlock took the man in, a bit on the shorter side, pale and thin, dark brown hair. His face was gaunt in nature, eyes hidden in the deep set sockets, and Sherlock found him to be intriguing. He waved his hand dismissively, allowing the music to begin.
John’s eyes were open, but glossy and unresponsive. His breath left his nose in small puffs and his lips were cool in color. He didn’t even twitch when Sherlock softly called his name. He could smell the alcohol on John’s skin. Sherlock stood and plucked the glass from John’s hands. That earned him a tiny stir, a minute shift of his eyes, but nothing more. He returned to the kitchen where he found an array of empty bottles scattered about the counter, and one broken in large shards on the floor. He pulled a clean glass from the cabinet and filled it with water at room temperature before returning it to John’s hand. Sherlock snagged the large, knitted blanket from the sofa and draped it over John’s lap before he headed to the bedroom. He turned his attention to the chest of drawers, shuffling through the socks and underwear to find him clean garments, then a pair of flannel pajamas and a long sleeved, crew neck shirt. He tucked the items under his arm and made for the bathroom at the end of the hall. As he ran the water and pulled back the shower curtain, he thought of John sitting in his lap on the loo, running his fingers through Sherlock’s tangled hair. A towel was located under the sink, and Sherlock left everything on the porcelain lid of the toilet. The door was shut in hopes of warming the tiny space up.
Sherlock glanced up from the pages when he heard the canvas flip back. The doctor entered without words, and sat in the chair next to the cot. Holmes continued to feign interest in the chapter of his book, though truthfully, it was quite dull. Murder mysteries were the equivalent of romantic comedies. Honestly. Someone should do a bit more research and try to make things more interesting. Was this really a mystery to anyone else? He felt John’s eyes on him, and a smile twisted on Sherlock’s lips. He had made it an unspoken goal to gain one foul word from the good doctor’s mouth, by whatever means necessary. It wasn’t as if he had anything else to pass the time. He licked his thumb and flipped the page as if Watson were not there at all.
Before Sherlock could open the box, John was on him, near him, flush against him; had they in fact melted together into one? The kiss shot fireworks through Sherlock’s body, charging the marrow of his bones and rearranging the atoms in chest. He began to cry, feeling overwhelmed by both internal and external stimuli. Months of practicing had just come to a cusp, and now he spilled over, out of his protective coating and into the open. He grasped John’s face tighter, kissed him a bit harder and with so much more intention. He had to tell him; John had to know. Sherlock could not
John smiles softly, rubbing her belly. “Are we hurting you?” He drops his hands lower, under her naval, continuing to gently rub her.
Crystal smirks and gets up, tying Mycroft down. She knows with his strength he could get out of them but still it’s hot.
“I love you too Jonathon. Don’t cry, my boy, I will always look after you.” Magdala says softly. She leans forward and kisses John’s cheek.
She kisses and sucks on his neck as she keeps the slow pace when she finally realizes what she said to Darius. “Oh my god...”
"Mm I know you do. I could be pounding into you and someone could just walk in. They'd see what a whore you are. They'd see how much you love bouncing on my cock. They'd think you're a cheap slut." He slams into John's oversensitive prostate over and over.
Greg tries to eat but he has a hard time getting the chop sticks to work. He resorts to stabbing pieces of food.
“Considering we’re nearly the same age you're lucky you didn’t get a womb full of dust instead of cum.” Sherlock chuckles, getting up to change.
Mycroft blushes and smiles proudly. Ever since they bonded he never wore his collar buttoned up or a tie so his bond marks showed proudly.
John watches Sherlock bound up the stairs. But he stays in the lounge, turning in a small circle and looking around the room.
“She’s not married, and not in a relationship, going by the length of her skirt and cut of her top. But she’s obviously looking. She’s got a cat at home, you can see the fur on her shoes. No wait, two cats. She doesn’t work in the public eye, but she still sees many people. I’m guessing she’s a receptionist, going by her makeup and nails. And probably on her own laptop, and she carries on shoulder more tensed than the other. With the make of her clothes, I would say she works for a FTSE 100 company.” Sherlock finishes with a nod.
Mycroft, still tentative, took the man in hand and stroked him languidly. "So beautiful, Gregory..."
Diōnē explains her story about how she’s not totally human. “So basically I can make your little.. Swimmers swim again.” She smirks.
“Mm first I’m going to put a cock cage on you because I know how excited you get when you suck cock.” John smirks.
He gasps and bucks his hips. "Yes.. Oh god.." He groans and let's his head fall back against the bed.
“Oh, John, I’m sorry. I tried to shut the connection as much as I could. I’m so sorry.” Sherlock presses as close as he can with the pups between them. “Jim... He whipped me and cut me. He also touched me a bit...” He whispers, feeling so guilty he couldn’t keep John from feeling what happened to him.
He smiles. “I haven’t been to the zoo in ages.” He hums, decidedly leaving out how he used to work at the zoo.
"Mm I can't say. Sorry, boys, but somethings I can say and others I can't.. That's the sucky part of this." She points to her head.
‘I’m sorry. I searched for you. For weeks. I lost your scent in the.. In all the blood. I’m so sorry.’ He bows his head.
“Sire, forgive me for asking, but I wish to see Anthea is well, for myself. Would I be allowed to stay in the room?” Mycroft asks softly. He stands behind Anthea, a hand on her shoulder.
Maggie smiles softly, having been up all night but not showing it. “We have a small farm. A few horses, Bell and a few other heifers, a couple pigs, a hen house, and some other miscellaneous animals.”
She giggles and squirms ticklish. She pulls him up and kisses him deeply pouring all her love and affection into it. "You're fucking perfect. No matter if we're in here or out there. I love you so much. So so much. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. Nothing." She mumbles against his lips.
She smiles and kisses her softly. She trails her hand gently down her body making her skin have goose bumps. She rubs over her clit gently with her finger tips.
"It's great." John nods and Mycroft smiles. "I'd love to go but I can't stay to late because I have to go to my mother's early tomorrow." Chloe hums.
"So, Mycroft?" John asks as they all tuck into their meal, "what's it like with two pregnant mates? Have you gone insane yet?"
Greg smiles and squeezes his hand gently. "How's it going guys?" Sky smiles as she has her arm wrapped around Ada's waist and Ada holds onto hers.
“Glass of red wine.” Mycroft nods. “I’ll have the same.” Sherlock looks up at Pete through his lashes.
[Right. Yeah. I guess I'll talk to you then. Should probably let you get back to grading anyway or you'll be up all night.]
"Really, you Alphas act like you're the ones in charge when really, we hold all the power because you lot are too dumb to understand."
"She wouldn't mind. If you told her. She wouldn't. She loves you. A lot. I can feel it radiating from her and she's not even in the house. She knows you're keeping something from her though. She can tell. She's just hoping it's not an affair."
He whimpers as he feels George’s throbbing cock against his face. He knows they must be getting close to the center but her doesn’t want to take his mouth off George’s crotch.
He licks his lips. "As brilliant as all that sounds, no. Remember what I told you to specifically tell her. Tell her what her Daddy wanted her to do."
Sherlock frowns. “Then I’ll tell them no one gets to have sex with me unless I say so. No matter what. It’s not for them to decide and it’s not up for discussion.”
"Fuck." She moans loudly as he trusts up into her. "I'll untie you and let's you touch me if you fuck me harder than you've ever fucked anyone before."
"Yes, sorry," John tells her. They're led to the room, the receptionist opening the door for them. There's a couch and a few chairs in the center or the room. Along the walls are several overflowing bookshelves and there's a desk in the far corner.
“Go ahead. I don’t mind.” John nods and smiles, wanting Sherlock to eat since he’s looking paler than before. “I wouldn’t have made it to becoming a doctor if things disgusted me.” He chuckles and goes to wash his hands again, thinking about what their next step should be.
Veronica and Sky are making out in his lap. "Mm they're so hot, aren't they?" Carol smirks and strokes him over his trousers.
“I’m not. I have Mrs. Hudson there with me and Greg and Molly and Uncle Mycroft.” Sherlock hums. “You don’t have to worry about me. It’s my job to worry about you.”
“She’s probably doing something stupid and cut us off from her so we don’t tell her not to.” He frowns.
"Basically he's a cat with a magic bag." Ben explains, "and he gets into crazy situations. Which is just like my cat, one time I found him up on the top of the bookshelf trying to destroy one of my plants. It was a mess."
John nods and gets the things out for the donation. He watches his blood flow into the bag. “My mother’s maiden name is Magdala. You’ll find her research under than name. Her early work was more in occult disappearances. Then it morphed into more of a refined historical account of how magic, witchcraft, and religion function in society.”
Mycroft kisses Anthea’s forehead as he steps away and nods Crystal over. “This is Crystal. She’s your sister, now. She’s amazing at recognising pain and injuries.” He says softly.
"Of course, love." He nods and sends off a texts to Sherlock. He cuddles with Mycroft before leaving when Sherlock and Collin come in to cuddle with him. Sky sighs softly, getting dressed as Turk comes in.
“I have a few article in the works. Did you know I used to write really cheesy romance novels?” She smiles.
"But there's only one of you. Mycroft and I have a team of twelve or more at any given time." Anthea hums.
He smiles softly and presses against Sherlock, who's the closest to him. He can't remember the last time he was in such a submissive state.
He gasps and tilts his head back. "Sh-Sherlock.." He can feel himself slipping deeper into submission.
Cynthia soon comes in wearing her scrubs. "Hello, Mr. Dints. Would you like to meet your baby?" She smiles softly.
"You were such a good boy, baby. You listened to me so well. I'm so proud of you.." Greg kisses his neck.
Sherlock nods. “There was a group of us. If the Nazis got wind of someone, we would pretend to be them, so the humans wouldn’t have to go. I- I don’t know how many times I was in a concentration camp.” He murmurs. “Too many.”
She smiles and nuzzles him back. "You smell good.. Really good.." She hums and mumbles against his neck.
John giggles, quite unable to stop. "Yes, all right... partners." He grinned. "Though I'll have to cut back on my hours at Marigold House..."
Sherlock followed John out to the car when he picked up the last bag. “I want to fuck you when we get home.”
Sherlock smiles softly, watching John for a little longer before leaving him to rest. He closes the bedroom door gently and goes to the living room, calling Mycroft for an update.
"Seems like your husband is having fun." James chuckles and looks over to Sherlock who is sitting in a plush chair with Lydia sitting in his lap, squeezing her arse as they kiss.
He whimpers and nods. “So much cum, Daddy. Feels so full and heavy.” He whines softly, rubbing his cum swollen balls.
"I've never had a harder time not murdering someone." Sky laughs, trying to relax again in the bath.
Greg turns to Sherlock, “I asked you a question. I asked you all a question, and I didn’t get a response, I presume because you’re all guilty of thinking of me as a blood bag. And you’re all getting annoyed at me, because I don’t want to be seen as one. I am not the one hunting here, I’m the hunted, and because I’m trying to say no, you’re all getting you’re knickers in a twist.”
“Feels so big. So thick. I love it.” She presses her back against his chest as she fucks herself in his cock.
"She's dressing for a club not a gala." George sighs. "I'm not going to dress like a forty year old woman. This is what they're expecting to see. If they think they're right then we're still playing the game on the winning side!" Sky throws her hands in the air.
“I love you daughter. Close your eyes and rest some more. We’ll be here for you when you wake.” Mycroft says softly.
Sky whimpers as she’s spanks, pushing her arse back for more as he air is cut off even more. She relaxes into her sub state even more, knowing the more submissive she is the more likely they’ll be to fight over her.
“That person you attacked two days ago. Why didn’t you kill them?” Greg asks, curiously to how it all happened.
John sits Sherlock on the bed and bites his lip. He wants to say something but he isn’t sure how so he figures just coming out and saying it is best. “I want to fuck you.” He says. “I know alphas don’t usually like to be fucked especially by their omega. If you don’t want to, that's fine. I just thought I’d put it out there.”
Sherlock blushes brighter and looks down at the sheets. "Mycroft already knows about my wants with this.."
He smirks. "Good girl." He and Cecil pull on their boxers before leading Violet out to find the boys. He blushes and hesitates as he sees that John, James and Eli are accompanied by Sherlock, Mycroft and Greg. His cock twitches with interest.
Collin moans into the kiss and pulls Mycroft closer starting to feel more confident. He slides his tongue past Mycroft's lips and takes control of the kiss as he's usually the dominant partner.
"Annie." Sabine's voice was firm. "I will not have you blaming yourself. I see it as my penance for not saving you from his hideous views."
He frowns a bit. “I know that Sherlock’s sleeping with Mycroft and everyone else has someone to sleep with and I.. I was hoping to sleep with James but I.. I don’t think he wants to. He left while I was explaining myself and I just.. I don’t want to be alone..” he blinks away tears.
"Just tell me," John sighs while stroking one of the boys, Timothy, he thinks, judging by the hat they'd put on the pups to help tell them apart without reading their bracelets. "I felt it all, love... Everything."
Sherlock frowns, “but we have to take that risk. Camille is going to get rid of all of us and all the humans that disagree with her. After she’s fought Crystal, we’re next in line. Maggie and our child are next in line to be slaughtered. We have to try with Greg. Please.” He begs.
“Sire, if we can get you back to Lucifer. Would you not want to go? I know I would do anything to get back with Violet.” Mycroft says softly.
“Would you like a list of people who disagree with that notion? You can have it alphabetized or by date.” Sherlock snorts.
John wraps around him like ivy. Every possible inch of them that could be touching is flush against each other.
He moans loudly and arches a bit. "Maybe I'll use some toys on you. Or maybe I'll take you to that club again."
“This castle has seen her fair share of wars. She stood through those and she’ll stand through this one.” Margaret nods before pouring a glass of blood for Sherlock, setting it in front of him.
Mycroft edges over to sit next to him, their thighs touching. "Good. I would hate for you to be in pain." He murmurs.
“I’m going to take you to bed, before bringing everyone else. Will you be okay on your own, Locky?” John asks softly.
“And I want you to knock my daughter up.” He blushes, getting off on the idea of picking people to impregnate his baby girl.
Joann nods. “So do I. I miss squeezing their little chubby bodies.” She mumbles. “But we’ll have grandpups soon.”
“Yes. Don’t act like you don’t know.” He mumbles, still burning a bit with embarrassment but doesn’t stop the soft touching and keeping Sherlock straddling him.
“I’m sure it will be wonderful either way.” Diōnē smiles softly. “Pythia will probably follow wherever we go.” She hums and Pythia nods.
John hums softly and sleeps with them. Sky sits on the kitchen table as she watches Greg bake. "What are you making?" She hums.
Chris gets Sky untied and off the stand. Sky curls up in his arms as he carries her to the couch to Dave.
“And how do you think they get that blood supply? Through donations? They get it from us. Whether we let them or not.” Greg frowns. “Please John. I’m scared.”
‘Good boy. Take Mummy’s cunt..’ Sky purrs in his head as her body sleeps. ‘You’re lucky mummy never wears panties so you can have her cunt whenever you like.’
“Oh sweetheart.” Pythia pulls him close. “It’s alright. There wasn’t anything anyone could do. She was happy. You made her happy.” She holds him.
“How do you get him to act like this? So.. So needy and desperate?” Mel blushes. “He’s a natural submissive. He likes to be dominant from time to time but this is how he likes it best. And so do I.” Chloe smirks, riding him faster. “I could ride him for ages and he won’t come unless I tell him to. He’s such a good boy.” She praises.
“I think that’s a discussion that we should have with John.” Sherlock states, not liking that she sent John into a deeper sleep.
He whimpers and nods, grinding back against their cocks. “Want their cum, Daddy. Want them to fill me.”
Greg rolls his eyes. “My mother’s side goes back to Scotland, my dad was French, but estranged from his parents. Something about refusal of his grandparents will.” He shrugs. “Magdala and John told me my mother was a witch.”
John nods and cuddles Sherlock close, Magdala having left to do some research. “I don’t care where we are as long as I’m with you.” He smiles softly.
He holds on to him with trembling hands. "When he said he found your blog I though he had knocked the air out of me. I was so scared I couldn't breathe. He scares me because I don't know what he'll do to you. To any of you.."
"Scared of him? Or of being alone with him?" John asks, abandoning the kettle to kneel before his mum. "I know what Moriarty did to you... You can talk to me mum. And we'll get you someone good to talk to as soon as you're ready."
"Yeah, my old room." John directs him up the stairs then turns to his mate. "This is going to be a problem, isn't it? We're going to be doing the bloody grocery shopping and all of a sudden my shirt's going to be lifted and your head pressed against my stomach. Still... I kept food down finally."
Greg smiles softly and washes Sherlock's hair. He knows Sherlock loves having his scalp touched and his hair played with.
“Sherlock can dance,” Mrs. Hudson interrupted suddenly, anxious to stop the four year olds from fighting. “You should see him, he’s quite a vision.”
“Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson said, pleading as he extended his arm for her to take as they descended the stairs. “Please, tell me what those are for. I know today might be hard and I don’t want to have to call your -”
Before she could respond, before Lestrade could call help to the flat, before Mrs. Hudson could bring up the idea of calling Mycroft, John had grabbed his suit jacket from the back of the chair and was sprinting out of his own reception.
A sob escaped Sherlock’s lips and he gently pushed the doctor away. His eyes were distraught, tears freely falling down his face. His arms wrapped around his own torso, the only thing comforting or protecting him was himself.
The Watsons would leave, Sherlock placing a kiss on Rosie’s head and, more recently, receiving a warm embrace from John, always followed by a “I’ll be home soon.”
“I can’t be around those people for so long, John. I was drowning in there and you didn’t even care.”
He spoke quickly. The army doctor, always steady, always the strong one, was unraveling right before Sherlock’s eyes. How he wished he could ground him, how he wished John would breathe and slow his sentences. If he could just touch him, hold him.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks and turned. “What’s wrong? Why do you… why does your voice sound like that?”
As if Sherlock had burnt him with fire, John leapt back. He scrambled for his jacket and phone, laughing. “Thank you for your teaching me, I definitely feel more prepared. I can’t wait to- I cannot wait to show Mary everything I’ve learned. You’re a miracle worker, Sherlock. Truly.”
John’s breathing almost immediately quickened and before he knew it, he lost control of his lungs and bent over, hyperventilating.
John raised his hand from Sherlock’s shoulder to the back of his neck while he addressed the doctors. The dark haired man tried to ignore the butterflies that filled his abdomen and focus on the conversation, to no avail.
Seeing Sherlock’s mood shift, (so much like a child, that one), John stepped back, shook out his arms and raised his head. “Okay then, ballerina. Teach me.”
He crouched in front of Sherlock, now quietly crying as well. He moved Sherlock’s hands away from his face. “Please look at me.”
When another beat of silence passed, Sherlock took the shoulders of the coat and moved them back, letting the suit fall more comfortably on the shorter man. The silence was deafening as Sherlock smoothed the front of the coat, John staring into his orbs and Sherlock only having eyes for the black material.
“There is no need to call Mycroft. They are empty and old and dull. Truly, I simply need them for an experiment. Now, please tell me about these letters I am required to read at the reception.”
Sherlock had told himself he could not and would not love, but look at him now: Sitting in the back of a taxi with a hole in the bottom of his stomach as his fist clenched the phone in his hand.
“We get it all of the time,” Sherlock interrupted, starting at the wall as if none of what was occurring interested him. “Don’t apologize, as it’s what everyone else in the world also thinks.”
Sherlock’s throat went dry, his stomach dropping to his feet as John, once again, played with his hair.
Soon, Lestrade took up the plates and washed them in the sink as Mrs. Hudson wiped the table down. John and Mary went downstairs and he made sure Mary was safely on her way home in a taxi. By the time he was back up, the only remaining person was Sherlock.
Instantly setting his violin down on his desk, he was at John’s side in a second. “John? John, are you alright?”
The detective turned toward him and John smiled softly, weaving his fingers through the soft black curls. “Daddy, hmm?”
“Of course. If she was willing to be with you when you wore trainers and a mustache that made you resemble my great grandfather, I do believe she will like you in this.”
Sherlock stepped closer, wrapping an arm around John’s waist. John instinctively took Sherlock’s hand.
He then took John’s other hand and without thinking, placed a kiss to the palm. “See?” His voice was soft. “You’re real, you’re here. I’m here, I’m touching you. You’re feeling my heart and you’re safe.” Sherlock kissed John’s palm again.
“I… Love… You…” Sherlock spoke into the kisses, breathing the words to John’s face. “I love you. I love you. I love you.”
John took their takeaway into the kitchen, storing the remainders in the fridge and tossing the empty containers and plastic utensils in the bin.
“Yes! Thank you, John, for understanding!” Sherlock shouted to the sky sarcastically. “Finally you get it!”
“Hello! Welcome in, welcome in. I’ll take you all to my section right over here,” she said, leading them to a glass case to the right of the store with three black chairs surrounding it.
John broke the kiss and laid his head in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, exhaling heavily for them both to catch their breath.
“John, is this truly how you want to live out our final days? Eating takeaway on the couch with crap Telly on?”
Everything had to be perfect, everything had to be right. John and Mary had relied on him to help plan their day, and the day finally came. He had to make everything good for John, and for the first time in ages, felt a panic attack coming along.
John’s face was etched in a grief and displeasure that was too much for the taller man to handle. The detective looked away, when the doctor cleared his throat and continued to type on his laptop. That was that.
Sherlock’s head raised at the sound of John’s voice. The sandy haired doctor was walking toward him, smiling in a way Sherlock couldn’t completely pin.
The man liked to believe that he was invincible and, after telling everyone about how much he hated emotions and people, it was always a shock during moments like these, when he did anything but not care. Sherlock’s heart was thumping in his chest; a bird trying to be free from it’s cage. He grasped the handle of the taxi cab, his alabaster skin even more pale than usual as he was worried to the point of nausea.
Something about Rosie falling, hitting her head, and being scared of the doctors as they gave her stitches which was very normal at that age, especially without parents close by. Here were the bandages to use and come back in three days to get them removed. Oh, it was nice to meet you too, yes you have a good one as well, alright then, man handshake.
He just knew that he wanted Sherlock. He’d always known that, but the idea of a life without the detective is not one he would like to experience again.
Sherlock looked up at him, and then the exhaustion hit. The exhaustion from planning the wedding, from getting fitted for tuxes and picking out dresses and bouquets and the constant nagging from Mary, and the constant chastisement from John.
John wondered if Sherlock’s tone was bitter on purpose. He thought that Sherlock didn’t mind it when people thought they were together.
It was casual and confident, solidifying and satisfying. Everything and more and more and more and more and more.
“Okay, fine. You don’t have to join me, that's alright. Just don’t whine to me when you haven’t slept for eight days on the day of the wedding.”
John’s face fell out of sympathy and he set his food on the table, then scooted back into the couch to be closer to his friend.
Janine shrugged. “All he said was that he had an experiment at home. It seemed important. He didn’t seem to be doing well, it was probably eating away at him all night.”
John broke himself out of his gaze when he felt Sherlock adjusting the ring. He looked down and saw a gold ring, simple but sturdy. He liked it, but it intimidated him that it was a ring that would represent the rest of his life. He ignored the pit in his stomach at that thought.
Yes, the tall “sociopath” had stepped up more than you might think in regards to parental roles around the house. He had even come so far as to only do potentially flammable and/or fatal experiments while Rosie was sleeping or at school.
With a few adjusting sounds and rustling, the two ended with Sherlock’s head on John’s chest. At first, he was stiff. Uncomfortable, hesitant, cautious. Then, John haphazardly pulled the blanket over the both of them and joined his hands together atop Sherlock’s back before slowly drawing circles on the fabric of Sherlock’s robe.
Sherlock was convinced that one day, the slow burn was to spike flame and one of them would lean in for a kiss and that would be that for the rest of time. Just the two of them and Rosie: two husbands and their daughter.
Forty minutes had passed in silence of closed curtains, deep-voiced whispers, and “it’s okay, let’s just start again.” Sooner than John would have thought, they were clumsily waltzing around the room. Was it perfect? No. Was John truly the least graceful person Sherlock had ever danced with? Maybe. But they were doing it.
In the fitting room, Sherlock had been sitting on the bench as his friend had tried on suit after suit, always finding a flaw. Too long, too short, too boxy, too tight. Sherlock had given up trying to help after John was offended by his comment comparing him to the Pillsbury doughboy.
“You. Can be called dad. Only if you want, I mean. You don’t have to, but if you did, it would be fine. It’d be good. If you want.”
“I’ll be home soon, I promise,” John said, inhaling the scent that was of tobacco, tea, ink, and mint. The scent of home.
“John,” Sherlock said, his voice barely able to be heard. He laid his head on John’s lightly. Then -
John loved how Sherlock was So beautifully normal and was baffled as to how everyone, Sherlock included, was so blind to it.
John flipped the blanket back over himself and his focus went back to the film, but Sherlock hesitated. When would he ever have the opportunity to lay on John’s chest under the covers in the dark without Mary around after he got married? Or rather, at all?
She shook her head, burying her face in his jumper. He laughed warmly. “You had your dad and I worried, you little devil!”
Sherlock took another step forward and wrapped one of his hands around the doctor’s wrist, pulling the hand out of John’s pocket and holding it between his own pale hands.
They walked into the foyer and Sherlock went straight for the door outside. John followed and the London night air was crisp as John handed Sherlock his dark cloak, shrugging on his own jacket. “What has gotten into you?”
Sherlock glanced into the mirror and for a second, lost the ability to breathe as he felt his ears grow pink. The jacket that John had on was black and smooth, perfectly fitting his torso and arms. The back of the coat was longer, extenuating his form. This suit also made John stand a bit taller, Sherlock noticed, his shoulders more set.
He was afraid to make the first move, of course, but spent several hours of his days reliving small moments with John and daydreaming of the things they would be able to do, the holidays they would be able to go on, if they could just profess their love for each other.
“Please, John,” she said, smiling. “I want you to learn so that we can have a first dance together!” She tugged on his arm gently, grinning.
Sherlock was wrapped up in his robe, sitting indignantly in the corner of the couch. His legs were curled against his torso and moping, he opened his box of Chinese food. But not before throwing a glare to John, comfortably sat on the other cushion with a blanket, warm and open as always.
The emergency wing was not busy. A patient to his left was hooked to an IV with a nurse by his side and there were a few doctors scattered about the room as they flipped through files, but one specific bed in particular had about two doctors, four nurses, and… Rosie’s teacher. The adults were loud and he could hear crying.
This feeling, this feeling of being so unconditionally loved was almost too much for him to handle, as it was not permanent. It was not real.
His phone rang and he checked the clock. It was 13:02. It was probably Lestrade, saying he was running by Wagamamas on his way to the flat and did Sherlock want any? This happened on a semi-regular basis, the two single men talking about murder over take away food while John was away at work.
John looked at him and he saw the bags under Sherlock’s eyes, the heaviness of the hand on his chopsticks, the frown on his mouth.
“Oh, my little bee. What terrible thing happened? I’m here. I’m here, Rosie girl.” The baritone voice calmed as he swayed with her. Her arms tightened around his neck.
“Sherlock, I really need you to respond so that I don’t feel completely in the dark here. Why are you going home? Why are you avoiding this? Why are you in so much pain?”
John moved into a jog and pushed open a door at the end of the hall. Sherlock doubled the length of his steps. His eyes began to water. Fucking shit, this was misery. He hit his knees in one of the stalls, hands clutching the toilet for support. The light from above the mirrors disappeared and he heard the hinges of the door creak. He knew Watson stood less than a meter away, blocking him from humiliation and anyone else that may walk in. He was about sick and fucking tired of –
“Deep breath there, Cap. That’s nothing.” Sky told him, low and close. John raised his eyebrows, surprised someone else noticed him watching Sherlock. “We all love Shezza here, but it’s never been anything, y’know, more than that.” When John still didn’t seem convinced, she took it a step further: “Honestly, John, he’s never brought another living soul here. Never seen him look at someone the way he looks at you. Wipe that sour look from your face.” His lips parted, no words coming his way. So he just nodded and did exactly as he was told.
John’s breathing grew into shallow, small gusts. John lifted his forehead from Sherlock’s chest, greeted with a desperate kiss from Sherlock’s searching lips. One long inhale was pulled, and Sherlock felt his eyes prick with tears as he read John’s body, piece by piece: the muscle of his thighs pulled taut, the perfect arch of his back and neck, mouth open, gasp frozen somewhere deep in his throat, ready to pour out in the gorgeous moments to follow this one, the gentle pull of Sherlock’s hair where John’s fingers interlaced with his strands, needing contact, John’s other hand clawing desperately for purchase between the shoulder blades of Sherlock’s back. John’s eyes fluttered open. Sherlock’s heart clenched in his chest. John’s lids were half-mast, pupils dilated, eyes opening direct lines of communication with Sherlock’s hard wiring. There was no filter, no misconception, no question. John’s hand stroked tenderly at Sherlock’s nape. He pulled Sherlock closer, kissed him as if he were a life source, and stayed there as his body went still. Taken aback, Sherlock’s mouth found John’s again.
“And how are you feeling?” Holmes was impressed. Watson did not skirt around issues, nor was he afraid to ask the questions others feared response to.
Heavy breathing fell over his other half, his better half, and as Sherlock slept, John silently wiped away the rivers pouring from his eyes.
He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and rocked himself up, settling on top of the lean, sinuous line of gorgeous anatomy now beneath him. Sherlock’s collarbones were lovely, having more anterior and posterior travel than most. The place where his sternum met the long, bowing line of his ribs was prominent, moving with Sherlock’s deep breaths. John gave a soft open-mouthed kiss to a dusky, raised nipple, tenderly pulling it between his teeth to lap at it with an attentive tongue. The first sound to leave Sherlock’s mouth was a rich, dark moan, his back bowing, pushing his chest closer to John’s. He wrapped a strong arm underneath the bridge constructed by Sherlock’s spine and held him tight.
“I brought you tea,” he murmured. He reached into the seat next to him to extract a to-go cup from the bundle of leather jacket and gloves; he had wrapped the beverage up to keep it warm. Sherlock felt dizzy, like he had gotten up far too fast after resting for an extended period of time. John stood and walked to the edge of the stage, extending the drink up into Sherlock’s hand. He took it dazedly; for a few moments he drank John in instead. He was beautiful; he wore gray trousers that hugged him across the hips and a navy blue sweater. The shirt tails of his tan, checked shirt covered his pockets. But it all paled in comparison to the sweet glow of his skin and the color of his irises, more blue than ever when paired with his damp, blonde lashes. Sherlock set the drink down and jumped easily from the stage, placing himself only centimeters from John.
Sherlock bent down and placed a tender kiss on John’s mouth. “Yes. And I know just the place.” Sherlock swept into John’s bedroom and stood, waiting, but what for, John didn’t know.
Jane laughed. “Callum said you’d flip. It’s nothing. I’m not going to date that guy. He’s a punkass. Hot as
Molly turned to wink as she settled in between him and Callum. “These are the best seats in the house.”
He dug his hands into his pockets, more out of habit than nerves, and casually strolled down the walkway, as if he were headed for the lift in Scotland Yard. When he arrived at the front of the aisle, Lestrade and Mycroft were standing on opposite sides. Watson stepped up to elder Holmes and wrapped his arms around him. Mycroft stiffened, his face twisted in shock, and a few attendees chuckled. John took his place next to the man that made his life make sense, and Sherlock finished the last notes. A sweeping memory overtook John, Sherlock standing on a stage, informing John that he only ever played for his family. Yet here he was, playing for whoever happened to hear: a confession of his love for John Watson. John’s guts warmed up; how had he earned the ability to be the exception to every single one of Sherlock Holmes’ rules?
“That’s what he does. He makes deductions and solves the dead-end cases. The show represents his process on a case. He gets a little manic, actually. Like he exists entirely inside himself. Doesn’t eat, doesn’t sleep. He’s completely consumed by the case until he solves it. He’s described it another way, but. Well…”
behind those tired eyes. He wasn’t what she needed. He knew it to be true. He wouldn’t date Jane Jesep. But he most certainly could befriend her.
“I just don’t know what to do with them, B. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Assigned seats, bookwork, simple projects, very involved projects, free choice, no choice. I’m stuck. I’m stuck, and I hate who I’ve become with them.” She picked at her thumb and stared into her glass.
, I feel uncomfortable if you aren’t in my presence and sentiment has become an all-consuming disease.” John’s mouth turned up at the corner. “But it has always been you, John Watson. You keep me right. You are the soul and heart I so desperately lack, the patience I cannot muster and the kindness I do not possess. For whatever mad reason you have found me worthy of your time, I cannot imagine, but I will not try to convince you otherwise.” A tear rolled down John’s cheek. His eyes were bright and dewy, alive with emotion and reaction to Sherlock’s words. Sherlock tucked John’s lengthening hair behind his ear and then pulled a small, navy box from his inner suit pocket. “Marry me, John Watson. Marry me, and allow me to test the boundaries of your sanity for the rest of your days. Let me ruin dinner, forget to take the kettle off, shrink your jumpers in the wash, complain incessantly at the stupidity of Christmas and leave toes on the kitchen table.” The doctor was covering his mouth with his free hand, grinning straight through it and trying not to weep. “Marry me. I love you, I do, and as idiotic and senseless as it is, I have savored every second of it. From the beginning, John, and, with your approval, to the very end.”
A 300 Blackout* was pointing into John’s chest. There were more men than he could count gathered around him, yelling. His Dari was weak. “I don’t understand what you are saying.” The mouth of the gun was shoved harder into his sternum. He whimpered, trying to fight back tears.
“Depends. How many people are you going to kill?” Sherlock smirked. “I will admit your presence tonight made it quite a different experience for me… one I’d like to have more often.” Holmes was panting; a smug smile took over John's lips.
John finally found the proper section of notes in his disaster of a folder. “Okay, so I’m having a hard time with plasmid transmission and transposons.”
dance.” Jane’s eyebrow was cocked high on the left side of her face, gold lidded eye sparkling in the tungsten light of Molly’s sitting room. Molly yanked Jane to her feet, and set her drink down on the side table. A club remix of one of their Tove Lo favorites came on, and the girls began jumping around the room, occasionally swinging their hips and using a wooden spoon as a microphone.
actions? That you just show up and put some ridiculous love potion in my tea and oh no, you’re feeling guilty and responsible?” Sherlock’s voice was biting and cruel. “ ‘I can’t love Sherlock because poor him, he’ll be here all alone and he’ll be miserable and god forbid that happen.’ That didn't stop you from leaving the first time, did it, John?” John’s eyes were huge and tears accumulated in their corners. “Give me some fucking
“You’re right, Sherlock. I’m sorry for being a self-absorbed prat…” Sherlock continued walking without looking to John. “I’m just terrified of leaving again.”
“I am about to leave you yet again. I was too foolish to realize the severity of my decision the first time. Now I am wholly aware of my stupendous failure in decision making, and yet you continue to stand by me.” Sherlock opened his mouth and John raised his hand. “No. I need to say this. It is cruel, what I have done. Allowed myself to give in to the feelings I have somehow managed to keep under wraps, at least in my own head, for the near two years we have been friends. You have been patiently waiting for me to come home to you, hoping for the best but expecting nothing, and now I have done this…” John hand crossed weakly and aimlessly through the air.
He lets out a high pitched giggle and covers his mouth not wanting Greg to know he found a very ticklish spot.
“They won’t change that much. I’m trying to prepare you for reality.” Mrs. Holmes growls. “I’ve been too soft on you boys. Too soft on your father.”
"Come for me. Make a mess of yourself. Make Daddy come." He pounds into him, hitting his prostate each time.
“I guess? I’ve known him for less than a month because that’s when I started working there and we only went out the one time. He doesn’t even work in the same building as me.” Sherlock shrugs.
