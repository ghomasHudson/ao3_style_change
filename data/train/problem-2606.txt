BTW:  The after-Claiming party scene works best if you put on some slow, sultry bluesy piano stuff while you read it.  I'm too lazy to provide a link, but I have faith in your googling abilities.
Cas pursed his lips.  His eyes, already red, grew flinty.  “We have rules for a reason, Dean Michael Winchester!  I’ve had to install
Sam’s jaw worked silently as he continued to fume, trying to funnel the desire to lash out but finding nowhere to send it.  Sam would never have considered the idea under normal circumstances.  Dean had more than three years on him, and their scrapping in the yard proved again and again that Sam didn’t have the juice or the weight yet to pin his older brother.  But his fierce hazel eyes glared daggers at Dean’s penitent green, and this time there was something else in Dean’s eyes.
“Sam may join us shortly,” he told her. “He is putting Kate to bed. Michael and Dean are both on short leashes this evening. Neither of them managed to stay on my good side long enough to enjoy the final segment of tonight’s events.”
“Quentin Gabriel, look at me.”  It took him a moment, and his chin quivered before he was successful, but he got there.  “Son, I’m not angry with you.  But I expect you to apologize to your sister for pinching her arm, and I expect you to use words next time you have something you need to express.”
“You’re not in trouble, Omega.  We finished with that, and it’s over.  That doesn’t absolve any of us of the need to address the recurrence of the problem.  Dean has a great deal of hard work to do, and so do you.  I intend to facilitate the journey for both of you.  Dean’s put that authority in my hands, and I’m going to do my job to the best of my ability.”
“You don’t like those people? Fine. Follow me.” Cas opened to suite door leading into the hallway. Dean groaned and began to stand.
Michael edged back in.  He looked first at April, and his face was pale.  She dodged his eyes by hiding her face again in Castiel’s throat.  “Yes, Sir.  I’ll get hold of the same form we used for Tony and have the lawyer adjust it.  Email me the details?”
“You’re going to get your slacks greasy sitting up there,” Dean warned him too late. Cas shrugged it off. It was worth it. Dean stood and turned his back on his Alpha, leaning into the engine with his legs in a wide ‘V’ to lower his height enough without straining his back. What it did to Castiel’s view was a bonus. Totally a bonus. Castiel sipped his own drink slowly, rapidly losing his train of thought. Beer on top of whiskey was more than he usually drank outside of a celebration, but some things – an emotional confession among them – warranted more than water. Michael slid up onto the counter beside him and stole Dean’s beer.
“I apologize, Sir. I said it’s only cold when you disappear on me like that. I like having you stand close.”
Michael didn’t protest.  He let his body relax back into the mattress so that he wasn’t looking up anymore.  He seemed relieved.  “Will I still work with Joshua?” he asked gruffly.
“How late were you up last night? You have work today, and we had a morning scene planned. Now you want to sleep through it?” countered Michael.
“I’ll bet you wish you’d chosen that Omega to mate right about now though,” Jack added, unaware that his uneasiness slipped through his bond even as he schooled his face. “Someone you could knock up?”
Sweat flew from his nose and his hair. His perceptions spiraled in until all he saw was red and all he heard was the thundering of his own heart, loud in his ears.
“Playing someone else’s piece isn’t anything like writing one of my own.  I don’t have any control over what comes to me.  It just happens.  All this stuff…”  She held up the pages.  “…This is trying to force something.  I don’t work that way.”
“We’ve a great deal to accomplish this afternoon,” Castiel announced, grabbing everyone’s attention and silencing the room. “So let’s get started. First up is Maximillian Banes. Balthazar, would you please show him in?”
“I got carried away, and I took it too far, and what I said to her…out loud…in public…in front of witnesses…it wasn’t what I really feel. It wasn’t what I meant. It just slipped out. I don’t know what made me say it. I don’t ever want you to think I don’t…that I think you’re…that you’re not…that you don’t mean
“Mostly,” he answered vaguely, realizing only now as he thought about it that roaming the halls had been his plan, taking in the day-to-day health of the place in a way he didn’t usually get to see it, at leisure and with no other place to be.  He couldn’t go back to the office.  Someone might’ve come searching for him there.  But that’s not what he’d done.  He made a beeline to the classroom wing, and he’d been watching Dean teach longer than he meant to.
Michael shoved Dean up against the wall and plundered his mouth, digging deeply with his tongue and pressing their hips together.  “Does it feel like I’m pissed at you?” he mumbled around Dean’s lips.  Michael ground his erection into Dean’s hip, and Dean groaned, feeling himself start to fill alongside his mate.  “Want you, alpha.  Want your knot.  Want it right now.”  Michael thrust into Dean’s groin, and Dean was lost to the sensation as his mate seemed to be both of his designations at once.
“I…what?  We have wedding appointments.  Like, three of them.   There are decisions we’ve been putting off.  We’re helping Mark and Matt move.  We need to do everyone’s final fittings.  He’s
“She’s sick in the head, babe.  She won’t have any idea what you two are going on about.  Just…just feed her breakfast and send her away.”  Dean rolled over a little to let Cas strip the bed around him, but he didn’t get up to help.  They’d done this many times before.  Dean knew to stay passively horizontal.  Cas was a master at changing bedsheets with an occupant in the bed.  “Cas, I’m sorry, but your mom is gone.  There’s nothing left but bitterness and denial.  It’s like my dad.  Whatever used to be there is gone.  We can’t fix it no matter how hard we try.”
Dean giggled on the couch, buried beneath the puppy-pile.  He’d missed Jo.  Her quirky sense of humor and her take-no-bullshit demeanor were the perfect antidote for Sam’s sour disposition and Dean’s lingering malaise.  Jess emerged to meet the gang in a much better mood than when she shut herself away.
Cas wrapped an arm around his mate as they emerged from the tight space and she continued to lean in to Dean.  “That’s fine, Dean,” he said.  He helped guide her shaky steps.  Dean didn’t get an answer to his question.
The cabbie texted rapidly into his cell phone, muttering unhappily. “Gotta hunt it down first. They don’t exactly hang signs on the door.”
“I hope so, April, but it’s really up to Dean.  I can’t help him either.  All I can do is try to be there to give him what he needs.  I can’t make him take it.”
“Good.  Get a quick shower and use the toilet.  Settle into your space on the blue mark and wait for me.”
“Let’s set to,” Cas announced, sliding J.T. to his feet on the floor as he stood up. He took the toddler’s hand and led the way out of the kitchen with Jimmy asleep in his arms. “The faster we get started, the sooner we’ll finish.” Cas settled his son in the portable crib in the corner and covered him with a blanket before directing J.T. to begin gathering crumpled paper.
“You knelt to me,” Michael went on, approaching slowly.  “All of you knelt to me because you know from within your own canine souls that I am your
Cas found her pointlessly rude, but he didn’t rise to the bait…exactly. “I’ll repeat myself,” he said with an air of clarifying for a feeble mind. “I must not have spoken clearly. My apologies. This is April Winchester. She has an audition scheduled today at two.”
“Why do I feel like I failed you, then?”  Cas pulled himself up onto the bed, and Dean moved his papers so that Castiel could lay down beside him.
Cas licked his lips and leaned casually into the wall, watching The Facility smoothly rotate on its well-oiled axis. The hallway smelled stable and homey, comforting and clean.
Castiel did his best to put Billie and Michael out of his head as he scoured the side streets and alleys through the window of the back seat of his town car. Billie had all but slapped him before huffing off to type up her decisions in her own space, a wide-eyed Jonathon towed along behind her. And Michael’s dourness lasted all the way through dinner, earning him an early and lonely bedtime with his anatomy notes.
He settled back into his pose, keeping his eyes on his Dom and wondering if Cas knew what he needed yet.  Dean’s ass wasn’t even pink anymore, although he had seven tightly spaced red lines across it, barely there, just a hint.  Castiel stood by the door, his eyes unfixed, chewing on his lip.  He closed his eyes, breaking all contact with his Sub, and centering himself.
Dean huffed at her.  “Yeah, mine either.  Guess your wolf noticed she had an advantage over mine and decided to make a play.  I’m sorry I bit you.  Does it hurt?”
She uncurled slowly and blinked up at him with an oddly satisfied expression. She chuckled awkwardly. “See for yourself,” she offered cryptically, holding his hand to her soft belly to keep him close. Michael felt a nudge from inside his head, and he traced it to where it lodged, exploring it, following it back along its trajectory until he found her.
And when her song ended, the audience cheered, not the reserved welcome of a disappointed theater house, but an enthusiastic, full-throttled, resounding rumble of appreciation. April glowed with excitement, thrilled to her bones.
“Gabriel,” Cas called down over his shoulder. Dean landed a hard knee in his gut, and he grunted but didn’t slow or falter. “Would you and Kali please watch the children for me? Cain, I need you to keep an eye on April for a couple of hours. You’re in charge. Michael, you’re with me.”
Dean grunted, catching himself before he rubbed the sting out.  “Just the usual,” he deferred casually, avoiding his brother’s eyes.  “It’s no big deal.”  Mark handed Dean his satchel, studiously not looking the alpha in the eyes either.
“I’ll go,” said April, looking back over her shoulder in the direction Dean disappeared. “Alpha, may I go watch over him? Please?”
“You use everyone, don’t pretend to be naïve,” he said bluntly, very Michael-like suddenly.  “The deal goes like this – you get a friend who has your back and offers you an ear when you need one.  In return, you don’t ever play me.  You drop all the masks with me.  I get to see the real Pete.”
Sam blew out a long exhale.  “Come on, Sarah.  You’re so damn close.  Click over with me.  Make the connections.  You get this.  I know you do.  I can see it in your eyes.  You keep getting stuck on your own culture.  Let it go.  Let go and feel.  Dean’s going to come limping through that door in a minute, and he’s not going to be broken.  It’s not brainwashing.  It’s not a violation.  It’s Pack.”  Sam’s head was down close to hers as he whispered furiously to her.  “And yeah, it was harsh.  It was harsher than normal, but this marriage thing goes against our nature, Sarah.  It’s like pounding a square peg into a round hole.  It takes some doing to make it fit.  They aren’t going to get there without a little pounding.”
Michael blushed but shook his head.  “Not at all.  No one trains for something like this.  Most Dominants discover they have that talent by accident, during moments of duress.  That’s what happened to me today.  I was angry and frightened, and it came over me.  I didn’t really control how it happened.  What I did control was how I used it.  All I cared about was freeing my Packmates.  They had my son and my girlfriend.  What would you have done?  What would any of us have done?  I got lucky to find that I wasn’t as unarmed as I thought I was.  But I didn’t know that until it happened.”
The speed at which Dean accepted the observation gave away the source, and Michael narrowed his eyes. “Cas told you that,” he guessed sourly. Dean still didn’t look up. He was feeling soft and lazy—too much so to respond. He flipped the page to the editorials and found on a skim-through that more articles than usual were geared toward the debates on Omega rights and agency.
Castiel took back over. “On that note, does anyone else have anything critical to bring up? I’m cutting this meeting short, so if you need to speak, do it now.” They murmured for a minute amongst themselves, but they all agreed everything remaining could wait. “Thank you everyone, get some lunch, let’s stay on track please. There are deadlines approaching. If you have one, you know who you are. By the way, as a quick personal announcement, I have recently changed my name legally, and all of the ACRI documents that bear my name need to be changed over the course of the next few months. Please don’t reorder anything without going through Donna first. Go ahead and use up what you have. Donna’ll have the new reorder numbers. You’re all dismissed.”
I knew you would come through.  Okay, so, Sam had the crowd in Portland post a video of the whole audience singing
“We can do both,” Dean told him. “She’s going to give us time. I know Charlie. As long as I don’t actually get you off or fuck you, she’ll let us play a little.” Dean groaned as a wave of cramps pulled his face into a grimace. Michael pulled out the hose and took off the nozzle, looking around until he spotted the small trash bin well clear of the water spray.
“Look,” Dean stated in clipped tones that had every eye on him.  “You and me and Cas, we’re playing a game with the cameras.  We all know that.  We talked about it and we consented to it, and everyone’s comfortable with their job out there.  I’m just telling you right now as clear as I can say it: he may be Omega, but Michael’s not going to be a part of that.  Period.  If he decides that a career in Lupin research or outreach is for him, then he does it the right way, through the certification programs, and he stays in the herd.  He’s no one’s figurehead, and he’s no one’s research project.  You hear me?”
Sam fumed and paced for what seemed like forever.  At last, a knock sounded firmly on the door, and his father was ushered in.  Dad looked tired and pale, but he didn’t look like he’d been drinking today.  The alpha put a firm hand on Sam’s shoulder, grounding him, but holding him tightly, and he faced the VP, who had stood to greet him.
“Have you called your brother?” Benny asked, driving Sam and his mate home.  He should be taking the couple to get checked out by medical, but as he’d told Cas on numerous occasions, Mating was a natural drive.  Wolves did it all the time without needing medical surveillance, and Sam had asked to be taken home.  Benny was just glad Sam didn’t try to drive himself.  Mating hormones were strong motherfuckers, and they could fuck up even the stoutest wolf for a good while.
“I guess I kinda feel like you’re running the show more than I thought you would, and I found myself sort of, um…Jesus, how do I say this?  Sort of squeezed out of the decision making.  I’m confused as hell.  I feel like if I ask for what I want, I’m gonna hear no more than is fair.  And once you’ve decided, it’s closed for good.  I feel stifled, like I’m not really part of this, so I kinda started to think of ways to go behind your back, and I hate feeling like that.  I don’t want that.  Michael, he, uh, he set me straight just now.  He told me maybe we’re not ready to get married, and it made me really think about it…hard.  So, I’m asking…should we maybe
Castiel flowed forward.  He lowered his head to aid his eyes against the glare from the streetlight, and he flared his nostrils.  A firm thump, followed by a muffled grunt and a low whimper came from his left.  Down the alley.  He could smell the alpha now.  Jesus, the smell.  The guy reeked – practically rancid.  How had he missed it?  A detached part of his perception noted Benny behind him, holding back with his phone to his ear, calling for emergency assistance.  Castiel dismissed him.  He didn’t need to tell Benny to watch the alley’s exit.  No one would get past Benny.
I encourage show discussion if anyone needs to talk about it. I also encourage feedback on the story above. Tell me what you think. Holler at me about typos. Thanks for reading. 💝
Michael schooled his face and caught Dean frowning a little.  “I’m proud of you, Winchester.  That’s all.  I’m proud of both of us.”
“I’ll let you mull it over until this evening, then,” he told her coldly. “We’ll pick this conversation up again before dinner tonight. You have the day to consider what you need to say to me. Seek advice from anyone you like. And yes, a phone call to the Lafitte house would be time well spent. You’re dismissed.”
“I agree.  He’s Omega, but he certainly ranks higher than my brother.  And as much as I’d like to promote my Omega-mate to a loftier position, she really belongs at the bottom, whether I like it or not.”
The house stayed full to bursting for a week, but just as Dean had promised, none of the intricacies that were necessary to keep that many people comfortable made it to April’s recovery room.  Castiel helped her back up the stairs the following morning to recuperate in her own room.  Dean himself regimented her visiting hours and kept the hallway outside the Master suite quiet and calm, letting April find balm in the presence of Pack scent, but never overwhelming her with chaos.
He rounded back to the front and looked down upon the top of her head. She looked tiny like this, curled over on herself with not a stitch of clothing covering her body. She was an entirely different person than the vibrant young talent who charmed a theater full of people this afternoon and took them all on a bigger-than-life musical adventure by way of her piano and her passion.
He went to his husband, took his hand, felt Cas’ strength and confidence as Castiel’s hand curled around his and pulled him firmly around to stand before his Alpha.  The strength and control stole Dean’s breath.  Everyone else disappeared.
“Where do you feel it when I do this?”  Dean pulsed a long, oscillating wave down the bond and smirked.
Dean took a deep breath and dropped the last shoe. “And I have to talk to you about something else.”  Michael’s eyes widened, and he froze with his beer bottle poised at his lips.
I hope you enjoy dangling in the uncertain with me.  I never stop wishing I could do this full time and just let it all come out at once.  But...bills, groceries, obligations, etc.  Ya know, real life.
“Sam, I want you to go to Dallas.  I want you to lead the cleanup crew and organize an audit.  We’ve got to fix this mess now.  Alpha’s orders.  You saw the medical pics of Henrickson after Cas got through with him, right?  We can’t let that happen to anyone else.  This stops.  Right now.”
Jeremy sheepishly took one, and pulled a napkin off the stack in the center to serve as a plate as Castiel had done.  She glowed at him.  Normally, Jeremy would have been annoyed or embarrassed at being praised for accepting a snack.  He would have seen it as patronizing, but he found himself smiling shyly back at her.
“No!  She’s not,” shot Michael.  “Are you settled here, Sam?  Do you need me to bring you anything?”  His words snapped, and his face closed.
Michael blushed and looked down.  “Yeah, he is,” he admitted shyly.  “Hotter.  I’m out of my league, Rache.  I’m not…shit, this sounds awful, but I’m never going to be enough for him.  He’s way out there in terms of what he needs.  Jesus, this is all strictly confidential.  You get that, right?”
Jack laughed softly. “Guess we’re talking to Benny when he gets home?” His eyes searched Jo’s. What he found there grounded him. He sighed and nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, we’re talking to Benny. Tonight.”
“We’re gonna have to figure out how to bottle up all this sap and sell it,” Gabe sassed.  “I hear they make bank off maple syrup in Vermont.  This stuff’s gotta be worth at least that much.”  Sam slapped him upside the back of his head, Gibbs-style, and poured himself more coffee.
“So she gets away with it? Again?” Dean pressed with his forehead furrowed. “She played you, man. A-fucking-gain.”
“You don’t have to stay home, baby,” Dean told Castiel for the fifth time that morning.  “There’s too much that needs doing at work right now.  We’ve got this.  I promise.”  Dean had a cup in his hands, and he was sipping it slowly.  He didn’t try to sit, and he didn’t try to hide the state of his nether region.  This close to Rut, all modesty usually fell by the wayside, and the Pack wasn’t alarmed by his presence, merely overcome by the smell.  At least he still had clothes on.
“Controlling this response is the Omega gland.  It’s located near the Omega’s lower mid-spine, anterior to it and attached to it through connective tissue and numerous ducts.  It’s just about even with the navel.  The Omega gland connects directly to the Reptilian center of the brain, where involuntary response and instinctive behaviors arise.  It also has direct connections to the posterior reproductive structures, creating a hormonal super-highway connecting the Omega’s instinctive impulses from their brain with the mechanical structures of their channel.  This gland controls so much of what an Omega experiences in his or her life, that essentially, regardless of the lack or presence any other classically ‘Omega’ anatomical structures, having this gland is what makes an Omega, an Omega.
“I’m going to leave it inside you, Pet.  It’s time to light you up, and you’re going to hold this inside you the entire time.  Do you have anything you need to say?”
“If you really want more of a partner than a Sub, you need to be consistent.”  Dean angled his bottle and his head at Cas.
“I’m not Omega,” Meg disagreed. They rounded the corner and found the wide hallway a turbulent mass of confusion as alphas whose seminar rooms were being switched around argued and fretted and shouted over one another. “Oh, good grief!”
“Because I’m a selfish fucking bastard, Michael. I’m human too, and I need to…Shit, how do I say this? No. No, you deserve to understand…” Cas visibly took hold of himself. He looked up at Michael and sighed. “It’s really not that complicated. If we’re going to make a marriage work, be husbands for each other and build a strong and stable pack, I can’t be the only one fighting for it. More than that, Michael, god, I need you to understand…I
“Hey,” Michael opened as they approached the house hand in hand. “Don’t get too upset, but Alpha’s going to insist on hiring a nanny.”
“You’re embarrassed, and you’re stalling.”  She didn’t pause, but she restarted the first phrase, slowing it down, opening it over again to give him time.
Nick nudged Mark sitting beside him.  “You might consider cluing Mom in before it’s time for her to dress up for the big ceremony.”
He lay awake for a long time, worrying about Michael’s psych eval in the morning.  It was never fun to have your emotional guts ripped out and put on display.  He watched Michael dreaming, and he could tell the moment the little Omega from the room next door joined him.  Michael’s dreams shifted from anxious tones in swirling red, yellow, and orange down to still, soft greens and blues.
She frowned again, trying to work out how to express it.  “My wolf is immense; not as big as his by a long shot, but it’s got a huge appetite, and it’s ambitious as hell.  The wolf never quite seems to get fed enough.  It wants all the attention, all the adoration, everything my mate can give me and more.  It’s never going to be enough until the whole world is in love with me.  It’s insatiable.”
“So, as you’ll notice on the screen, the male Omega wolf is strikingly different in form than the same region of a male ape.  His penis is smaller, both in girth and length than is average for an ape, although of course, there is a significant range of what’s ‘normal.’  In general, Omega’s penises are between two and five inches when fully erect.  Also, the scrotum and testicles are less prominent. However, the myth that male Omegas lack paternal fertility is just that: a myth.  Male Omegas DO produce fertile sperm, and, they can impregnate females, producing viable offspring.  It occurs infrequently because of the numerous other contributing factors that funnel male Omegas away from opportunities to father pups, such as social, biological, physiological, and psychological drives for him to take a receptive role in sexual encounters.  But they should be respected and honored as one of only two gender designations among sentient beings on this planet with the capacity to play both maternal and paternal roles in reproduction.  The other being, of course, Lupin alpha females, but since today’s topic is Omega anatomy, we’ll leave the alpha ladies for another lecture.”
“Asshole!  I don’t need your charity.  I’ll wipe the floor with your ass.  Oi!  Winchester!  Grab a stick!  We’re hitting felt!  It’s you and me against Jo and Michael!”
There was a silent plea that Sam had never seen there before.  Dean’s sense of guilt was swamping the 11-year-old, threatening to pull him under and make surfacing again so much harder.  Sam stared at him for a long time.  He didn’t have any idea what he was feeling, what Dean was feeling, but he knew what they both needed to get them out of the quagmire.  He didn’t stop to examine the impulse.  He ignored the voice of his mother in his mind, warning him to be careful and think it through.  Sam knew that if he did that, neither of them would find the absolution their eyes demanded.
Then they crunched numbers.  They were losing revenue at the same time they needed to increase staff.  It was going to be tight, but they’d been in worse places before and always found a way through.  Budget matters like this one would take the whole team, so Cas entered it in as an agenda item for the next leadership team meeting, sighed, and took his beloved out to lunch.
“Everyone found somewhere else to be once you fell asleep,” Cas explained.  “No one wanted to disturb you.”
“Not really,” Michael told him.  He washed his own hands, reading into Dean’s discomfort.  “I guess once I sleep on it, I might lose a few details, but now that I’ve talked it over with Alpha and April, and now with you, I’m certain I’ll remember most of it.  Cas told me to wait until my test is over tomorrow and then write it out like a journal entry.  Dean, he’s going to want to explore what happened, not just as Pack Alpha, but as part of our in-depth research interviews.  You’re going to be okay with that, right?  It’s still just talking.  No probes.”
to Christian Bale.  This one’s a train wreck.  Trust me.  It’s gonna tank like the Titanic.”  Benny headed toward the exit with the other moviegoers.  Cas walked beside him in a bubble of open space that somehow moved along with him.  Benny didn’t get a bubble like that.  Someone knocked against his shoulder as he brushed past.
Michael’s shout startled Dean, and he jumped.  Scared faces, frozen around the table swam in front of his blurry eyes.  Dean blinked, not sure he remembered how breathing worked.  His eyes closed again, and he fell sideways, his arms cold.
“Sir, I’m not allowed.  He put me under restriction.”  Michael pushed himself to standing.  He seemed on the verge of grabbing the girl and fleeing to whereabouts unknown; every muscle just as tense as when Cas first saw him but poised now for action rather than merely stressed.  All the Heat and Rut scent in the air was getting to all of them.
“Mm-mm,” Michael clarified.  “He’s decided.  They’re both in.  But he wanted Pete healed up and stable and the pups a few weeks old before he made it official.  Too much change all at once is stressful for Omegas.”
“Any questions?” Missy asked, but she was already getting up.  It was clear Michael was out of time, and she hadn’t been all that useful to him anyway.  He shook his head and thanked her for her time.
Dean chuckled and groped Craig’s ass.  “I’ve had worse.  You’ve seen me take worse.”  The kisses were nice.  Craig’s kisses had always been nice.  They could both hear the obnoxious alpha whooping loudly as he stomped about throwing his weight around.  The beta chuckled in muted disgust, shooting a look into the room.
“Mm-hm,” murmured Dean settling his lips against her warm shoulder.  She giggled at the sensation.  He was inadvertently close to her Mating-scar with all its exaggerated sensitivity.
“Would you like top or bottom, my boy?” was Castiel’s only answer. His eyes looked wild, and Michael realized that Cas the Alpha had no leash on the wolf at all. This was Cas at his rawest, rolling in the sticky pull into hedonism. Castiel pulled his hand slowly out of Dean, uncurling his fist regretfully. Dean’s backside followed the motion as a plaintive protest erupted from the Sub on his knees. His hole gaped darkly, and Michael licked his lips, ignoring the drip of pre-come that dropped onto the floor. Michael didn’t try to resist taking over Cas’ spot as the Alpha backed off the bed and stood to undress, leaving a sheen of sticky streaks at every shirt button, caring not a fig for what he was doing to his clothes.
“Sarah.  You’re going to see DFs here.  You’ll be here for twelve weeks.  You’ll witness things that you find very disturbing.  I want to assure you that I will be right beside you every step of the way.  I’m going to answer all of your questions.  I’ll be able to talk you through what you’re seeing and help you understand it.”
“I can communicate with my own assistant, thank you.” She took her seat and scooted her chair up under her desk, booting up her computer and dismissing him.
Cas turned to him, assuming an air of interest.  “You jumped to guilt awfully quickly there, Winchester.  Perhaps YOU need to tell ME what you’ve done.”
She carried her plate to the couch and wormed her way beneath his feet, setting her plate on his shins.  He didn’t acknowledge her presence.  April took his lack of reaction as permission.  They stayed like that, not speaking or daring to move until the erotic sensations peaked in an almost nauseating wave of borrowed pain and lust.  Michael went up on his elbows in alarm, and both of them stared at the closed door through which they could hear nothing.
The woman stared at him in confusion as if he’d spoken to her in Gaelic. Her pointed ears were obviously pack, but her exotic eyes and her Indian accent marked her as an outlander. Maybe she didn’t know who he was. There were people whose circles didn’t include the celebrity circuit, although they were few right here in eastern Kansas where the Novaks had long lived. Dean assumed she was confused that his fiancé had a mate, especially one who would be willing to accompany him to a fitting for a Shareer ka Daava robe. He began to explain, but she cut him off with a wave of her hand.
“Yes, sir.  I did.”  Dean spoke clearly.  He wasn’t nervous or penitent.  He was right where he wanted to be.  Anticipation thrummed through his body to his toes.
“Baby, will you go sit with Pamela? Talk to her. See if she can help or find you someone who can. God, Dean. I watched my father unravel before he lost it completely. I watched my mother do the same. They both killed themselves in their own way. I watched my brother go the same way and then pull himself, hand-over-fucking-hand, back out of that crevasse by himself on nothing but his own willpower. You watched it happen to your father too. You know how this goes, how it ends. Please, Dean. Fucking please don’t make me watch it happen to you, too. I’ll do anything. I’ll be anything you need me to be, but I can’t watch you fall apart. It will destroy me. I know that’s selfish. Everything about me is selfish, but I can’t do it. I can’t just sit here and watch you crumble. Tell me what’s in your head, Baby. Please. You’re not alone.”
Dean slammed the refrigerator closed. “Sounds amazing! If you feed me a ribeye, I’ll mate you, knot you, knock you up, and claim you forever!”
Michael pressed a hand into Dean’s back and spanked his ass hard with his other hand. Castiel stood a pace back once more, observing, breath coming shallow.
“Mommy, he knows you love him. He’s always known. He can feel you. You take care of every little whim and notion he gets in his head. You take care of his whole Pack! You didn’t have to marry the guy to let him in on that.”
Dean was pulled too, from the high school that the city ran theoretically for both species, but really not accommodating to the wolf population at all.  They enrolled in a Lupin-run private school in Kansas City, instead.  The drive was monstrous every day, but Dean had a license, and they managed, finding the adjustment much easier than they expected.  The difference struck Sam like a kick in the gut.  He had all the support he needed at the new school, and everyone understood him there.  His fish-outta-water sensation faded, and he found himself valued.  The downside that he couldn’t get away with anything anymore seemed a problem at first, but he quickly began to appreciate how much easier the strict structure made it for him to focus and learn.  Both of them blossomed, and both of them found the next step into college after high school was a thing that didn’t intimidate them.
“Yeah.  Goddamn, it’s pretty,” Dean told Chuck as he stood up and turned a handshake into a tight hug, leaving the beta awkward as usual.  “Your folks did great.  You go tell them I said thanks, and I’ll spring for a celebratory cocktail party to prove my appreciation.  Set them up for something fun, and send the bill to Cas.”
“If you ever engage in sexual activity of any kind without first discussing the risks to yourself and your partner or partners and taking appropriate safeguards, I will strap your bare ass until you cannot sit for days.”
“Whatever.  And your Omega?  What’s she like?”  Michael let his eyes close while her fingers toyed with his hair, and the afternoon siesta time made him drowsy.
Dean took stock of his emotions and his control. It had been a very long day, and tomorrow would be another one, and the two days after that. Normally, he would be out to a late supper at this point, high on the endorphins of a concert well-played, but tonight all he wanted was a soft bed with Cas on one side and Michael on the other, a chance to close his eyes.
“How can you think I’d miss April’s Certification?  I’ll be there with bells on.”  Dean leaned in and kissed her cheek, whispering, “Thanks, Jo.”
Dean’s eyes were dry, but he couldn’t understand why. It was as if his own daring, his own coming out and all the fear that went with it paled in comparison to Michael. Dean was lost in green eyes.
Sam picked it up again.  “The work he does helps him as much as it does the Omegas he pulls out.  His Mated scent is so faint now, most wolves can’t detect it.  Plus, he’s not in any danger of blowing his cover by coming across a True-Mate unexpectedly,” Sam followed his words with a long drink from his bottle.  “He told me once that he couldn’t protect his own pup or mate, but maybe he can make up for it by saving someone else’s.”
Dean pushed him off.  “You put a stop to it if it’s not right, if it doesn’t feel right.  Deal?  Don’t push through.  I don’t want any part of that.  It might work out and it might not.  If it doesn’t, we’re not going to force it.”
“Knock it off, Samuel, or I’ll increase it to a full week.  Right now, you’re only looking at two days suspension.”
Jo unveiled the next session’s training course schedules. The classes had been booked for months but assigning teachers to each one often waited until the last minute. Castiel and Dean clashed over Sam’s assignment. Dean needed Sam in the classroom with him, but Cas decreed Sam was locked into his new role as Primate babysitter.
Helene’s eyes flew wide. She flushed. Her eyes dropped to the floor, and she stammered, “Oh god, I… I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. Forgive me…?”
, Alpha.  They have to get out from under the thumb of family and community, get out from where the constant hum of expectation drowns out their own thoughts and needs and feelings and hopes…  All of them – from Dorothy to Elphaba to Elsa.  Their stories change a bit here and there, but their own packs are so stifling that they can’t begin to find themselves until they break away.  Men don’t do that, not in the stories.  Men go home to find themselves.  Luke and Harry were raised by foster parents away from home, and they found themselves after they reconnected with their home packs.  You see?  It’s different for girls.”
Full disclosure, the dynamic between Sam & Jess is completely stolen from a couple in a Robert Jordan's books.  It's a nod to my favorite shaggy-haired wolf and the fact that much of the flavor of this AU developed from my adoration of how he built his.  It's a genre-match, not a swipe of someone else's universe, but I'll admit that mine is a bit derivative.  If you want, check out Robert Jordan's "Wheel of Time" series.  It has wolves in it.  It's long. Be ready to invest.
“Yup,” Dean replied as he set his stool upright and tucked his chuckling back under. “Come on in. You’re early, but you’re in the right place.”
“Have you heard who Keller is naming to run against Cas for the Directorship?” Dean asked back vaguely.
They went quiet again, coming to the end of the block and turning left onto a busier street, one with shops and restaurants. Rufus took Dean into a mealy diner right on the corner and slid into a booth without waiting to be seated. Dean eyed the bench warily and took a very deep breath before he copied Rufus on the opposite side. Rufus chuckled at him.
And here the alpha was in his professional capacity doing precisely that in ways that touched hundreds of people in a single day.  Michael watched the staff hang on his every word at their morning meeting, seeking guidance from the man who could untangle their most complex problems, trusting him to take them seriously, and lead them out of the mire.
“You’re no philistine, yourself, Castiel.  You know talent when you hear it.  Are you telling me you had no idea she’s talented?”
“Alpha, please. Need you,” Dean snuffled back, resisting Castiel’s efforts. Luckily, after practicing with squirming pups for over a year now, Castiel was adept, and he managed to wend Dean back into his clothes, albeit with a struggle. Wrapping him back into his coat, Cas held him upright by his lapels and leaned in to kiss him softly on the mouth.
“Come on. Up you go. Let’s get you to bed upstairs. I want you to take a pain killer and sleep in tomorrow.”
four human beings! I had no right to make that choice, and I don’t want to live with this. And, GOD,
“That’s enough,” said Mark softly enough that Nick wouldn’t have heard it.  “Hang up and let’s move to something else.”
Michael began rattling it off as if he’d practiced long into the night. “No speaking except in an emergency. You are to kneel upon a pillow in silence, unclothed, and without taking any unnecessary actions of your own. I am the only person authorized to move the pillow, and you are the only person authorized to kneel on it. You will not feed yourself. I plan to ask you yes or no questions only so that you can answer by gesture. If I request sexual favors from you, you will perform what I’ve requested and nothing more. You will be attentive. You will NOT sleep. I expect good behavior from you, Dean. This is not a good place to unstopper your brat. I don’t want to see any sign of him at breakfast. Am I clear? Do you have any questions?”
Michael clutched tightly to Dean as he pulsed and pulsed. There couldn’t have been much fluid after the last few days they’d spent together, but the orgasm itself was epic. Michael’s cock slipped out, and he slumped lifeless all the way to the floor—out cold.
There was an intimacy between Dean and his fiancé that Dean hadn’t expected as the two of them shared their mates.  It was a layer of closeness that pulled them tighter together instead of distancing them from each other.
April squealed and grabbed the guitar from where it rested in the corner, dancing along behind as Dean led Castiel back down to the music room and settled him on the couch. He pulled a smaller chair into the bend of the piano, oblique to the audience of two. Michael stood behind the couch.
“We should be so lucky,” Dean told him.  “He’s flying in by private jet on Saturday just before the ceremony and skipping right back out a couple of hours later.  He made sure we knew that.”
“Shh.  I’m not worried anymore.  I love you, baby, so much.  I’m not the same man you proposed to.  Hopefully, I’ll never be that man again.  What I’m trying to say…what I need you to know and believe until the day you die…I love you.  I’m ready.  Cas, I believe you.  I believe
“Cas, brother, if you’re waiting for me to confess a crush on you, you’ll be waiting a long damn time.”  Benny and Castiel grinned at each other.
Once she was bare and over his lap, April couldn’t stop herself from asking.  “Are you still angry with me, Sir?  Today was hard because it really hit me just how disappointed you were.  I’m sorry I disobeyed you and argued about your rules.  I’m very sorry, Alpha.”
“Right! Nicholas Maraby’s new show! I forgot he’d invited us. Are you sure you still want to go? I don’t mind if you skip out. I know musicals are not really your thing, Dean.”
The PA checked Michael over and asked them both some simple questions then left the room with instructions to have the Omega undress and lay out on the exam table. She handed Michael a paper robe to wear, but she spoke only to Dean. Michael growled at her.
Michael’s splayed hands slid around his hips to his belly and dug in a little, a possessive clutch.  Dean could feel Michael’s erection through his black slacks, pressed up into the crack of his ass.  One hand came up and pinched Dean’s left nipple.  A hot, wet breath dampened the back of Dean’s neck.  A tongue traced his scar.  Dean felt his knees go weak and his cock drip a single sticky line of precome onto the bedding.  The scent of Omega slick wafted into the air around them both.
Michael’s snarling increased in volume and intent, and he thrust his hips downward, seeking completion, even as his wolf dodged.
“Which I’ll wipe up before breakfast tomorrow,” Dean agreed.  “That wasn’t half bad, was it?  Aren’t you mostly satisfied with what we’ve got?  Aren’t you mostly mad at the way I’ve been skipping out on taking my alpha role seriously?  If I get my head on straight, aren’t we good?  Michael?”
I hope the test lives up to all y'all's expectations.  I'm not sure about it myself, but it's what I managed to do.
Michael’s bonds were nearly closed.  Their mates were going to be gone for days.  No one perceptive enough to catch their subtle interplay was around.  Now was as good a time as any, and if she wasn’t going to answer the question in private, maybe he could stoke her to giving something away while they worked through the tunes together.  Music was her Achilles’ heel.  Michael texted a check-in to his mate, and then dropped his phone back into his pocket.  Maureen was at the far end of the conservatory with a wad of crochet work in her lap and an open laptop on the side table next to her.  Michael had already tested her give enough to know that her authoritative scope stopped at keeping the alphas clothed from the waist down and keeping April from drowning in Omesol.  She didn’t care what happened in the house outside that.
“Charlie’s got the list. You’ll have to ask her, but don’t do it yet,” Ellen told him. “We need to wait until it’s official. It’s going to take longer than usual. Don’t make me sorry I told you, Dean. This doesn’t change anything. He’s still the same man you Mated. Try not to go all weird on him. He’ll be under enough pressure as it is, poor bastard.”
Michael’s body responded to the congruence of body parts. It knew this alignment all on its own, and the spread of his knees brought his cock in line with her channel. Without thinking, Michael pressed in and thrust lazily while he plundered Castiel’s mouth. It was the best of both worlds, and Michael gave no more than a passing thought to how delicious it would feel to have Dean at his back, filling him even as he filled Pete.
Michael shifted uncomfortably. “Should I really be here for this? It’s between you two.”  He looked rapidly between them.
April’s fingers flexed.  They gripped.  She pulled.  And Michael wrapped her up with both arms and dove into her mouth hungrily with a whine.  Her back thumped against the door, and she kissed him back feverishly, starved.  One of her arms traversed his upper back to cling to the opposite shoulder, and her other pulled hard at his lower back as she lost herself in the feel of his mouth, the taste of him, the texture of his tongue, and his teeth against hers.
“She’s tailoring my wedding suit,” said Cas distractedly with a frown at his brother. What was Gabe doing? “I found out that’s where you were getting yours done, and I thought it would be nice if we matched stylistically.”
Michael nodded and touched the side of his nose. “Bingo. And that takes the pressure off, doesn’t it?”
“Um.  It’s…is this really appropriate dinner conversation?  Do I have to answer?”  He addressed the last question to Dean.  Keller scores were one thing.  That was nothing but a number system that made the nerds around him happy, but Release schedules touched on things like spanking and Bottoming and Heats – Omega things.  Michael didn’t like the knowing looks from around the table.
Michael knew that Cas had seen the telltale redness of a hard-spanked bottom peeking around the edges of Dean’s seated backside while he was down there. He saw the quick up-and-back of his glance. Probably, he’d already spotted the damage in the brief moment when Dean dropped his robe. Cas hadn’t remarked on it though. The Omega-Dominant would need to be careful. One wrong move and it might all still unravel. How far could he push? He’d granted the Alpha more access. Did that buy him a little more room of his own? His Omega seemed to think this Alpha was settling in nicely to a balance point that suited them both, but Michael’s wolf wasn’t buying it. Alphas didn’t share possessions with Omegas. A reckoning was coming, and he waffled back and forth between provoking it on his own terms or putting it off as long as he could. He wouldn’t win. All he could hope for was to retain enough of Dean for himself that he wouldn’t starve slowly.
that we were trying to elicit, both from the delivery side and the receiving side…but…well, hitting a silicone dummy doesn’t illustrate what we need to illustrate the way letting someone feel the power in the swing does.”
“My Alpha always keeps his promises.”  She snuggled in and wiped the moisture from her face on his shirt.
“You have no idea what you’re talking about,” April huffed at him.  “It’s not the same thing at all.”
Cas began. “Dominance in Lupins takes many forms, some of them sexual and many of them not. We will test each of you tonight against a uniquely Lupin form of Dominance that is in no way sexual but is very much an aspect of personal Tertiary power, as that is exactly how ranks are determined. Are you with me so far?”
Dean nodded somberly.  “You wrap your head around who you really are, and then you let me in on it, yeah?  I can put up with imperfect, man.  I love you for not being perfect.  I trust you.  Always have.  But what happened yesterday was an experience I don’t know how to deal with.  You put me between the man I mean to marry, and the one I’m obligated to protect.  And I love you both.  When you did that, C.J., I made my choice.  I couldn’t ever make a choice different from that.  You know I can’t.  The simple truth is that I can’t…”  Dean broke on an unexpected sob, and Castiel’s eyes overflowed as well.  “…I can’t put him in harm’s way.  I have to put Michael and the pup first.  If you can’t find a way through, and I mean all the way through, man, I…”
Save that for someone who hasn’t been working with Ozzies for the last decade.”  He pointed a finger in her face.  “I’m on to you now, kid.  Don’t try to play the kitten with me.  I’ve seen the dragon, remember?”
“My ass hurts, Sir.  My chest hurts.  My balls are really sore, and my dick is throbbing.  I wanna…shit, can I ask?”
God, he wanted to though. Dean was young and ripe. Every mannerism screaming Sub and alpha at the same time, Dean needed a lap beneath his hips and a hard hand reddening his ass. Cas had already imagined that ass many times, sometimes while right in the middle of a hard session with his usual partners. He was more than a little ashamed that his mind stopped obeying him in those moments. He’d thought himself past that level of immaturity. He needed to be better.
Sam sighed.  He didn’t know if he should tell Pam his problems or pretend everything was fine.  He knew he didn’t look fine, and as a freshly-Mated Lupin, his stress level made no sense.  She’d probably picked up on his scent and singled him out deliberately.
The knock on the door came as it cracked open. Castiel carried a tray of coffee cups, and Dean couldn’t really stop himself from diving for them. “This one’s yours, Dean.”  Cas indicated by tapping his finger against the side of one of the cups. “I didn’t know what Michael might like, so I just got a regular brew and some cream & sugar packets.”  Dean saw Cas’ eyes flick quickly away from the square gauze taped to his shoulder.
Cas called home quickly as Sam left to make sure the staff knew about the piano tuner coming at three and to have him check both pianos while he was there.  Then he took a deep breath and went to collect Michael.
“Thank you, Dean.”  He vanished in a couple of strides, and Dean stared out the archway wordlessly, feeling like he’d fucked up harder than anything he’d ever done before, brat or otherwise.
Gabriel whispered hoarsely, shoving his brother. He didn’t want a scene like this unfolding at a time he couldn’t make an escape. Cas struggled awkwardly up off his knees by the bed and stumbled to the door. “With ice chips, Cas!” Gabriel called.
Get your ass out here and help or I’m dumping it all into the pool.”  Gabriel’s threat bounced harmlessly off Michael, but he chuckled and got up to join the effort.  Michael asked him about the phone calls that had seemed so urgent, and Gabe grinned happily at him, walking backward as Michael caught up, but he didn’t explain.  Gabe wrapped an exuberant arm around Michael’s shoulders as he came flush, snickering happily to himself.
“Close the door, please, Mr. Winchester,” Castiel said tonelessly. Cas was both dreading the coming conversation and desperately anxious to learn what the boy had to say. None of it made any sense. Scared green eyes met his cold blue ones, and Castiel knew in an instant that his assumption was correct. Dean Winchester had not authored the paper he submitted. But why? He was plenty bright enough to fulfill the assignment on his own, and after more than half a semester, had never done anything like this. The danger, for the young teacher, was going to be in keeping his fascination with the complex mind behind those green eyes separate from what needed to happen now.
“APGAR score, Alpha?” Missouri asked over her shoulder.  She was scribbling in a notebook at the counter.  Cas ran through the categories swiftly in his head, checking the pup over.
In the end, she picked randomly.  It wasn’t the one Cas would have selected, but it had never been his choice anyway.  Castiel spanked her to help her let the panic run its course through her body and give her a chance to Release, then he took her to the kitchen to add to her whiteboard tally, call her piano tutor with her selection, and have lunch before she needed to settle back in front of the keyboard to begin working.
“Jesus, man, the things that come outta your mouth.  God!  Look, the point is, and I love you too by the way, the point is, it doesn’t matter in the end whether you sign off on it or not.  If it’s gonna happen, it’s gonna happen.  And would it really be that bad?  You and me are getting married in a few weeks.  That is, unless you pull another stunt like that and I have to throw you over my shoulder and toss you in the pool to cool you off…”
Cas’ eyes smiled into Dean’s.  “You are the strongest man I’ve ever met.  You are everything I need, and we’ll be all right.  If we need to accept that our marriage won’t be evenly balanced between us, then so be it.  I can do that.  I think you can do that.  I needed to know, that’s all.”
to live the way they do.  You’re still letting Primates define the box you live in.  You people kinda make me sick, to tell you the truth.”
Cas danced with his mother.  He danced with Gabe, with Kali, with Jess, with Mark.  With Ellen.  He applauded with everyone else when the band saluted Jo and Meg and their new mates with a rousing rendition of
He steepled his hands, glanced around the table, and intoned, “We will meet your health needs, beta, all of them, but the hierarchy cannot and will not be ignored.  As Alpha, I need to know about and to have advisory rights in all aspects of your care.  I will refer you to other doctors as needed, but I won’t be cut out of the equation.  You are expected to play an active role in determining what care you require and in seeing it through.  We must be a cohesive team, you and I, but I reserve the right to the final say about what medications you put into your body.  I’m aware that this reflects a shift in your conceptualization of your own personal bodily autonomy and that making it work will require an enormous amount of trust.  I really must insist though.  You are either mine, or you are not.  Am I understood?”
There wasn’t much to say to that.  Portia turned out to be a whiner, the hound in her leading her to make liberal use of her voice to communicate her disgust at being separated from the Pack at large.  But pack hierarchies were something the family already understood, and her complaints went unanswered for the moment.  They all knew how to handle a brat, whether human or four-legged.  She would be showered with attention and adoration in due course, but not during dinner.
Christopher came with a garbled groan, pressing right in against the constriction at the back of the alpha’s throat, making him struggle against the impulse to puke, making swallowing that much harder.  But he did.  Swallow, that is.
“It’s a good thing he’s not yours, then, isn’t it, beta?” Cas added over his shoulder, and Missouri blanched a bit.  It was a subtle smackdown, but it was enough to draw her up tight and get her attention.
“No, Alphas despise a challenge.  Interesting turn of events, really, considering they are suited to little else but facing down a dangerous enemy.”  Naomi settled.  She set the teapot nearby but waited for the tea to steep before pouring.  “Have you eaten, Michael?  I can have your lunch delivered here, and then we have the whole hour.  I want you to sit right there, brutally destroy me at this game of intellectual challenge, and tell me all about it.”  Naomi’s assumption that the staff would treat her like a guest at a five star hotel said a lot about her state of mind.  She was living in a world of delusion.
He clenched his fingers into Dean’s shoulder, and he set up a vicious rhythm that was designed to make Dean fight to find his breath, far more painful than the simple training session under Michael’s paddle before dinner.  Cas felt the graze of teeth when Dean swallowed, but it didn’t hurt, so he passed it.  Dean’s eyes unfocused as his breath became a frantic pull and push through nostrils that couldn’t quite keep up.
have been a fun family drive?” Gabriel spoke up, peeking up through his lashes to see if he was safe to speak.
Castiel blinked, taken aback.  “I did tell you.  I told you before I ever put it to them – on the drive up from Dallas.”
“We will put it all out there before we cycle,” April told him as she watched her pups sleep.  “We’re not leaving anything to chance.  You’ve met the man, right?  You think he’s going to knock me up without asking twelve times if I’m sure?  But it’s window dressing.  We don’t really need it.”
Jo raised her glass.  “A toast, if you please.  A toast to Pack Winchester.  Y’all!  Shut up a second!  I’m making a toast!  Damn!  Okay.”  She cleared her throat and began haughtily.  “Never before have the finest and rarest of wolves joined together in joy as they do here today.  I am honored to have been invited to witness this moment.  May this Pack flourish and grow, and may you all get busy squirting out pups, so I can finally be an aunt!  May the Universe in its infinite wisdom, bless this household and all who reside here.  May you be a beacon of light to those who are still lost in darkness.”  She raised her glass and drank deeply, and the rest of the table joined her.  Then she sat back down, blushing.
“Since when did you become an expert on mutts?” Joe taunted from his perch. “You been playin’ kinky games in your basement? Had a few secret girlfriends on the side?”
“Kinks…” Dean whispered to himself.  He was half-chubbed and leaking just a little.  He shook his head like a dog and slapped his palm on the table, more to startle himself back into a rational headspace than to emphasize his point.  His forebrain was finally catching up.  The Alpha across from him didn’t flinch.  He waited calmly for Dean’s response.  “Did you just offer me a job so you can get your rocks off all over me?  What the hell, sir?  Is it even legal to ‘launch sexual activities’ with a dude who works for you?  You may have my gender pegged, I doubt it, but whatever, but you don’t know me.  I hate to pop your bubble, Alpha, but ain’t that kind of a girl.”  Dean moved to the end of the booth seat and started to stand.  The chill bumps on his arms were wigging him out.
“Unfortunately, the staff are occupied at the moment,” Cas admitted.  “Perhaps you could get up off the floor so you’re not such an enticing jungle gym.”
“Yeah, that’s the plan.  Doesn’t free me up tonight though.  I still need to work on it at least another hour.  Gotta get all the options clearly marked out for him.”
Cas looked exhausted and Dean saw through to the core of the man he loved.  Cas was carrying everyone.  By himself.  A wave of remorse and sadness hit Dean in the chest, and he reached for Cas.  “You don’t have to do everything by yourself, Cas.  I’m not going to fall apart if you talk to me.  Let me help you.  Please.”
her. But he expected (demanded) that she trusts him. It was unbalanced and unfair. The Mating-bond stood wide open. She was all there to be examined under his wolf’s sharp eye. There was no ulterior motive, no deception. April watched him watching her with cautious optimism. She was a book open to be read, and she was clearly fearful that he’d reject her proposal out of a misguided attempt to do the noble thing (which was very much in his nature,) his wolf pointed out unkindly.
“Look, Max. You don’t know us. You know him by sight, but most of what you’ve heard about what we do is secondhand and overblown. Maybe if you explain what you’re concerned about, I can help you. I’ve been doing this for years now. I’m just like you, Max, but I have a safe, clean apartment of my own and a tax bracket. It’s not Utopia, but it’s a lot better than taking my chances on the street. I’ll answer anything.”
“Oh, but it is.  It is the core of empathy.  It’s a two-stage process by which your mind – your intellect – projects you into the shoes of another being to imagine what their experience is, and then you return to yourself, richer for the revelation, and prepared to act if need be to assuage any damage you perceived occurring.  That assessment of risk is intellectual as well.  We Lupins aren’t empathetic in the same way at all.  We don’t imagine ourselves well in another’s shoes.  We depend upon sense of smell and whatever bond links we’ve placed to actually feel what another feels.  The further apart we are on both axes of the scales, the more we need a Claim-bond to help us jump the gap.
Castiel’s shock echoed through the silence in the phone connection and reverberated against the closed bond-link in Dean’s chest. He licked his lips and drummed his heel beneath the table. Eons of evolution fought to lift him from his chair and put him to work on his knees before his Sir, but he kept his butt stubbornly planted. Cas had made his decision. And Dean had made his.
“Jack,” she whispered into his mouth. Their Mating-bond hummed with promise and potential. If this was Jack’s breeding kink and not a change of heart, she was going to suffocate him in his sleep. But it felt new. It felt hopeful.
“Come on, let’s get on with it.  I’m falling asleep on my feet, and so are you.”  Cas led him to the bed.  “Down on your knees.  Face the bed.  Drop your drawers.  In fact, slip them off altogether.”
“There you are,” said Castiel, gripping his chin lightly and turning his head to look upward.  “Better?”
“Omega,” cooed Missouri.  “Sugar, I need to take a look at you before we do anything else.  You just relax for me, all right?  Let me in, love.  That’s right.”  Missouri eased his thighs apart, and Dean helped him onto his back.  Michael huffed miserable shallow breaths which turned into a screech as the doctor’s probing fingers touched his sensitive cervix.  He kicked backward, trying to climb his mate’s chest.
Somewhere at the back. Somewhere in the darkness. Who was that? Dean looked across at the band. One, two, three, four. All present and accounted for.
“Dean!” Cas called from across the room.  There was no way he’d heard the threat, and he wouldn’t protest it if he had.  Cas had likely told her the exact same thing.
True-Mate matches were common enough in The Facility that a process to protect both parties had been developed and practiced often enough, and everyone knew the routine, knew the signs.  Everyone took up their roles without question.  The other two pairs of arms, Cole’s and Garth’s, it turned out, were also leading him the same direction.  Four on one, and it was still quite a challenge.  Cas was Cas after all.  With a final shove, all five men tumbled through the door.  Garth managed to slip back out, pull it shut and lock it before Cas threw off the other three and regained his equilibrium.
“Yes.  You said Sam’s paddled you before, but you rank higher than him.  Does that mean he’s not going to be doing that anymore?  Just Castiel and me, now?”
“So, did you ever tell Michael about your big name change, Alpha?” Dean asked as he steered the Impala into the parking lot.
Someone said, “Service,” and someone else said, “24/7,” then “Bondage.”  Dean heard a contemptuous voice from the back shout, “COLLARING!” and Dean made a face as he wrote that one.  Apes trying to mimic Lupins had been using collars on their submissives for decades, and it rubbed wolves the wrong way every time.  Collars were for dogs, not people.  It was Dean’s only real point of contention with what the Primates did.
“Morning, Michael. Sleep well?” They had slept as a pack again last night, and Cas had to admit it felt good.
It was weird at first, like a blind date. They knew almost nothing about each other, and they struggled to find much that they had in common, but they connected over a couple of television programs, and they found that they had the same favorite book, spending a good long time trashing everyone who didn’t adore Jane Austin.
Next thing he knew, Cas had a line of Subs to water, all of them eagerly awaiting their portion, all of them delectably on their knees.  He sighed in a feigned put-upon way and held his glass out to be refilled.  He gave Dean and April full portions.  Meg received a generous amount.  Jess got a solid mouthful.  Becky received a smaller portion.  Adam took the second half of what Cas had held back from Becky.  Gabriel got little more than a trickle.  Michael on his knees startled him, but he dutifully satisfied the Omega.  Cas looked up and realized he was surrounded.  He saw Jo taking to her knees with Charlie a few feet away.  He rolled his eyes.
“Why do I still have to do the test?  Don’t we all know I’m a Dom?  Is there really any doubt about that now?”
“Sir?  Excuse me, do you have a minute?”  April appeared in the doorway to Michael’s new office quietly.  She may have been there for a while.  Michael didn’t know.
“What about spanking, Tony?” Dean went on. “Have you ever had to watch as somebody got strapped or whipped in your kitchen while you cooked a meal?”
“Please, Jack,” she begged shamelessly. Her hips rolled and bucked beneath him, shattering his rhythm.
“Look at me, Michael.  Look me in the eye.  Listen to me, Omega.”  Michael couldn’t help responding.  Every trace of an uncertain or unwilling alpha was gone from his mate’s voice.  It wasn’t a commanding tone exactly, but it pulled him right in.  He locked eyes with his mate.  They were eyeball to eyeball, and the Omega had nowhere to hide.  Dean put one hand on his shoulder and the other on his chest.
“Yeah, beta, looking right at it. What’s this all about, and who’s ass am I kicking?” Dean’s face had taken on a hard light, all planes and angles and a pulsing vein in his throat.
made us a beautiful piece of original art.  It's at the heading of Chapter 28.  Go.  Go check it.  Drool.  He's gorgeous!
Michael wilted.  Dean felt fear course through his mate, but Dean firmed his jaw without sympathy and took the plate out of Michael’s hand, setting it on the counter.  “Dean, I didn’t do anything.  Why would I be in trouble?  Is he going to spank me?”
“So, you get where Dean’s coming from?” Sam asked rhetorically, pointedly skipping over the fact that “the kid” was Sam’s age.  “We’ve got a lot of allies out there, but none of us is stupid enough to think we’ve won this war yet.”  The airplane hatch closed behind the last straggler, and the flight crew moved to make ready for departure.  Sam took his phone back from Benny, shot a quick text to Jess, one to Dean, a quick afterthought to Castiel, and then he shut it off.  “All we’ve done so far is to fortify our armies.  We haven’t really even started the war yet.  Everyone’s just been choosing sides and setting their positions.”
MY OMEGAS!!” He fucked furiously to match his words, and the keening wail from the conquered man beneath him nearly drowned his voice completely. Dean could still feel Cain slightly through the Claim that Cain had set, and he pistoned his hips in a desperate attempt to erase and replace that link. “You’ll do as you’re told from now on, and you’ll keep your filthy eyes off my mate, off my husband, off me, for fuck’s sake!”
“Hit it,” Michael confirmed. “I have to warn you, Dean. I don’t know if he’s a friend of yours, but I was a bit of a prick to Raphael. I had him Topped from the start. I could feel it, but he didn’t roll right away, and that pissed me off.”
It would be pointless to pretend she wasn’t right.  She could feel his emotions.  “I’m okay.  Thanks for the wine.  Are you hungry?  Grab a bowl and join me.”  She did so because he told her to, but she didn’t plan to eat much.  Cheese puffs were more filling than she’d realized.  The travel and the party had worn her out.
“Are you ever going to stop pushing?” Dean decried.  “What’s next?  Are you going to lead the armies into battle with a machete in your hand?”
Dean picked his head back up, and Michael looked up into his eyes with a look of deep affection.  Laugh lines sprayed from the corners of Michael’s eyes.  “Of course, if we wait twenty years, we’ll have to pick a different cast, and you might require knee pads.”
Their research showed conclusively that True-Mate bonds were the cleanest and the strongest.  Some True-Mates could almost read each other’s minds.  Also, the right age mix among the mates made a difference.  Young Omegas Mating with middle-prime alphas were also relatively strong and clean.  The betas didn’t seem to enjoy much of a strength change no matter when they Mated.
“Open it up. Let’s scene together. Let’s break the taboo that’s making them both curious, bring it all out in the open. Don’t tell me you haven’t sensed something from your mate.” Dean leaned down and rested on one elbow, stretching out his long torso across the front of Cas’ desk.
Please note I added some tags.  This chapter goes darker than I've done before, starting with a scene with a young self-harming adolescent and getting later into a dominance display that is purely non-consensual.  It's what the wolves do customarily, but it may not be for everyone.  As always, if this AU isn't for you, no prob, just close out and find something you like better.
Dean chuckled gently and kissed Michael’s temple. “I know. You’re doing great. Relax your thighs, Michael. Sit all the way down. I know.” Michael was sitting tensely as if perched upon a filthy public toilet. Sam and Charlie stepped up behind the chair and quickly began to hook the leads of the electrodes up to their connections. Pam typed rapidly on the keyboard and loaded an image, the ACRI logo, on the large screen before Michael.
“It’ll be right here waiting for you whenever you’re ready,” Cas answered, setting it down and then sliding his butt up onto the countertop to wait and enjoy the show. He wasn’t stalling. Dean deserved a few moments.
“Jesus,” whispered Dean, climbing up and lowering his chest onto the cold table. His ass was on display to the shop, his cock hanging heavy and frustrated between his thighs.
Gabe dropped his brother’s hand.  His eyes flashed angry.  “What do you know?  What have you ever lost that you couldn’t buy back?  How many times have you tried to stand up straight and proud and had the Universe crush you under its heel?  Am I not trying hard enough for you?  Am I supposed to be unquenchable?  Why?  For you?  Because I’m your big brother, and you need me unbreakable?  Fuck you, Castiel.  It’s not your heart that breaks every cycle.  I can’t do it again.  I’m done.  You hear me?  Sometimes, even in the face of our best hopes, the Universe says no.  Some people don’t get everything they ask for.  I know you can’t relate to that, but believe me, it sucks, and there’s a limit to how many times a person can beg for one simple blessing and be laughed at by the cosmos before he just can’t fucking ask again.  I may be a fucking joke to the universe, but I have some dignity left.  Fuck you.”
“Is there a role for me in this cockamamie plot? Am I supposed to reel Michael or Sam in? What about Jess? Are you going to chivvy her into challenging too?”
“Forget the pants, Michael.  Man, you gotta be straight with me.  I agreed to take you, but I never said you could work the floor.  God, you know what that does to me!  What happened to ‘don’t leave me, alpha’?  What happened to ‘it’s not a con-job, I just want to be where you are’?  Have you been reading the stories they’re writing about you?  I’m not overblowing this!”
“If you make him Pack, Cas…” April warned, but then couldn’t decide what to say.  She regrouped.  “It’s still MY career, not his.  If I fuck it up, I fuck it up.  That’s my call.  Whatever happens, it’s still my career.  I’m not his puppet.”
He spoke loudly over the sound of his stream hitting the back porcelain.  “So, did you have any other specific questions about what happened in there with Kyle?”
He sighed and straightened up, his spine finding perfect posture in his mother’s presence. “No, just thinking. I’ve got to go back up the center tonight after the Pack ritual. It’s going to be a long night. Gage’s Heat should taper off soon, but until it does, he needs a round-the-clock vigil. Onset Presentation Heats are miserable enough without injuries and psychological trauma like he’s got.” Michael shifted the bench seat as far back as it would go so he could turn to face her, their knees nearly touching.
“It’s not that simple,” Dean simmered. “I promised to obey you, but you promised to take ownership! Fulfill your promises, Castiel James!”
you to get it all untangled.  Don’t you see?  It’s only frightening because it’s a position you’re not built to be in on your own in the first place.”  Michael moved right up into her space and put his hands on her shoulders.  “Your musical genius deserves to be stoked.  If this…ring master…is another aspect of that, then there’s going to be a way to keep it fed too.  You’re going to have to trust him eventually.  You have to trust
Dean’s eyes widened, and he nearly spilled her tea.  “You’re joking!  You popped his backdoor cherry?!  Jo! You pervert!”
Dean pressed his lips together.  He put a bracing hand on the back of Michael’s neck and held him firmly.  “You’re a terrific mother.  Those pups adore you.  They light up when you walk in.  You’re doing everything right.  Sweetheart, we’re all gonna miss some bits here and there.  It sucks, I know, but it’s not the end of the world.  I missed Ace’s first steps.  Cas was in San Diego when the triplets tried solid food for the first time.  April missed that first word by, like, moments tonight.  But we do what we can.  We’re there for the important stuff, Michael, the everyday stuff, giving them a home and teaching them they can trust us.  Please don’t start a scoreboard over who missed which milestone.  That road leads to resentments we can’t fix.”
“I showed you off for Sam on almost our first day here, Dean. I put Castiel behind you and had him fuck your cock right into my mouth. How could you not know?”
Cas beamed at him and stifled the tears that wanted to spring up. He still had work to do. April was a puzzle he hadn’t fully untangled yet, and Michael still had much to learn, but they were making progress, and they were shifting tighter together with each passing day. The Pack dynamic Cas envisioned was forming. It would take time. In the meantime, they still had Dean to contend with, Dean and his tests.
“Come with me.” Dean took the proffered hand and slipped off the counter. Those words sent tingles all the way to his toes. His backside clenched in anticipation. It was delicious.
“Uh, no, not exactly,” Dean admitted.  “I knew what she was doing, but we never talked about it, not in so many words.  She’s quick though.  She picked up my loose ends when I dropped crumbs for her, and I did the same with hers.”
“Dean…”  Michael was trying to assure him there were tissues in the glove box, but those words wouldn’t come out.
Jimmy watched her with borderline disgust and pity. What were these mutts doing to each other that a creature like this wound up on the street in this condition? It wasn’t the first such pathetic mongrel, and it wouldn’t be the last. He’d come across her rooting through the trash dumpster behind the Circle K. The briefest flash of his blue lights had sent her skittering into the darkness, nearly running right into his bumper before he stopped the car, and she’d given him a hell of a chase and a hell of a bite on the back of his arm. He knew it was bruised, but he didn’t think the skin was punctured. Besides, werewolfism was a myth. They weren’t Lycanthropes, and what they had wasn’t catching. It made him feel twitchy anyway to know her teeth had clamped so tightly around his arm. She could have bitten him anywhere; he was lucky it had been his arm. It could easily have been his throat if she got close enough.
“Thank you, Benny,” she told him, saying more with her eyes and the way her mouth seemed to want to form more words before closing firmly.  She nodded.
This chapter starts with the Winchester family when Sam's 8 and Dean's 12.  There's a Weechester masturbation scene, but he's alone, so if that squicks you, skip to NOW.  I'm not too concerned about all you kinky bastards.  If you've been with me this long, you know I'll go there...wherever that is...I'll go there.
Dean ground his teeth and then refocused. “Yes. I thought if I torqued Cas up mad enough, I could slide my wolf out of its cave just in time for the grand finale without really breaking anything. When he showed up to dinner nearly in Rut and stiff as a corpse, it felt like the right time to knock his cap off. Of course, you had to butt in right when you did, so I didn’t actually succeed in getting there without hurting anyone, but it was pretty close, wouldn’t you say?”
Cas opened the blinds as he spoke and then disappeared into the bedroom for the holed paddle he’d used before their lunch arrived.
Castiel laughed calmly.  “Michael, Dean only ever misbehaves through his Submissive.  Seriously.  He’s the most careful man I know, and he literally wrote the book on balancing modern Domestic Discipline with instinctive Pack discipline.  You’re never going to see him break a rule from his front brain or his alpha.  You saw him today.  He defended himself with logic and certainty.  He knows when he’s right.”
“So, what d’you figure, Winchester?” prompted Jo looking at Dean and missing the point that nearly everyone at the table could answer to that name. She’d called her closest friend ‘Winchester’ her whole life. She wasn’t about to stop now. “Nicknames? Too soon?”
Cas chuckled. He stretched across the table with his bottle and tapped Michael’s longneck. “I’m proud of you, Omega. It is an elegant plan. We’ll need to discuss how we prevent cheating, alliances, and cut-throat undercutting that would degrade Pack morale. Have you discussed it with Dean yet?”
“You’re too adorable for words.  Now come on.  Come sing with us.  We’re going to do some random jams to break Nick out of his writer’s block.  You’ve moped enough.”
They made their way slowly toward the dining room.  “You’re done with testing the fences though, April Renée.  I know what to watch for now, and if I catch you at it again, I’m taking it out of your ass.  You get me?”
Raphael narrowed his eyes. He wasn’t falling for it, but he did finally get to the bed, and he put a knee up on it.
”  Castiel roared loudly and fucked harder, pulling brutally at the tie and bringing the deep, awful ache even closer to the surface.  He didn’t speak again, but he snarled and grimaced as he fucked the Submissive.  The wolf knew what Dean needed – more than he needed the simple release of an ass set on fire by spanking, more than he needed to be called down when he was a brat.  The wolf knew why Dean couldn’t scene in public unless he had the excuse of a professional or societal assignment to fall back on.  The wolf sensed Dean’s deepest pain, and it made him face it.  Own it.
for her amazing work and support.  I'm so incredibly lucky you picked me to be your friend.  I adore you forever.  I couldn't have done this without you.
“What?”  Michael looked around from his place in front of the refrigerator where he was unburdening himself.
Sam stood up and strode across to wrap his arms around her.  His sniffle echoed off the high ceiling.  Kali melted into him.  Everyone waited patiently, hearts mourning with their Packmate’s loss.  Sam released her after a while.  He pressed back with his hands tight on her shoulders.  She granted him a watery smile and a nod.  Sam ushered her in with a hand across her shoulders, setting her beside Michael and leaving her with a kiss to the top of her head.  She squeezed his massive hand as he left.  Michael let Alex amble across his lap to his aunt.  She touched the soft curling hair on his head.  He touched her cheek with a curious expression, studying her face.
In the end, it was the simplest of statements: I need your help to be who I’m supposed to be, please don’t fail me.  And that’s where she ended it.  And Cas couldn’t breathe.  It wasn’t merely about feeling safe in a world that didn’t value her.  She was breaking apart at the conflicting desires from within, desires to conform to what her pack needed from an Omega, desires to bend and submit to feed the needs of her own wolf, and desires to break free from everything and catch fire in a spectacle of powerful music that lifted all of them above themselves and touched the seams of life itself.
Castiel swayed in place.  He let everything go – everything but that last bit of the wolf’s leash.  He let go of the anxiety that he carried that someday he would lose hold of his wolf at the wrong time and hurt someone.  He let go of the pressure he put on himself to make everything perfect for everyone he knew.  He let go of the burning need that drove him to keep digging and building, trying to prove the bitch wrong.  She
“Ouch,” Dean replied helpfully. “Yeah, Michael’s tangled up in daddy issues too.” He spoke quietly, all trace of brat and teasing and playfulness disappeared from his tone. “Maybe our next big research push needs to be about paternal influence on maturing pups. You think? Too many of us grow up shaky on the father front. Like you,” he said softly. “And Cas. Even April’s dad messed her up, and he tried hard to get it right.”
It was difficult, but he battled to stay present.  “Nah, Michael.  That’s not right.  I didn’t agree to staying naked and in-scene all the time.  That’s not going to work for me at all.  I need it when I need it, but outside of our playtime, I’m just me, and I’m wearing clothes.  Trust me, man.  It wouldn’t work.”  Dean took a step away from his mate to start heating a pan for the French toast and to clear his head of Michael’s overwhelming scent.  “I’m sorry about the touching.  I misunderstood, and I owe you one for that, but I’m not doing the other outside of our scenes.  Besides, I can’t cook naked.”
Don't feel like you have to read this all in one sitting.  My lack of control shouldn't cut into your free-time.
“It’s what I want, Dean.  I want it very badly, but you have to want it, too.  I can’t do it by myself, and it’s not fair to either of us to try.”  Cas’ voice had developed a telltale huskiness as well.  “May I ask what sparked you to bring it up right now?  Like this?”
are you counting? I count three.” The stark tone made Sarah feel ridiculous. She hadn’t meant to lay it all out there so bluntly. Really, she only meant to break the awkward silence with banal chatter. Instead, she cut right to the heart of the tension.
“Good.  Thank you, Michael.”  Cas consulted the tablet he had set on April’s piano, thumbing across it and typing swiftly with one hand.  “April, you and Cain fly out to Los Angeles tomorrow morning.  You’re with me tonight.  I intend to send you off fully Balanced.”
Dean felt the back of a thumbnail trace up the length of his back, following the sensitive line of cooled and hardened wax from the cleft of his ass to the back of his neck, and the chill bumps absolutely erupted all over his body.  Holding still took all of his concentration.
Cas could feel his knot swell.  Every downward thrust brought it to shove against the back of Dean’s thighs, and the pressure was blindingly sweet.  His beloved Pet fought the need in his own body, fought the friction, fought to be good.
“Right. Not funny. I’ll try to remember that while you limp around like a pup who got caught sneakin’ in after curfew. You want me to get you one of them donut pillows? I think I got one back at the house.”
“Wipe that simper off your face,” Cas said, trying fruitlessly not to laugh. “It’s absurd. I WILL spank you right here, Pet. Don’t test me.”
“Please trust me.  I’ll explain everything, but let’s just get through today.  I have to know what he’s going to say.  Maybe I’m all worked up for nothing.”
“Yes, Michael. I have already passed Gabriel’s request on to Anthony. We will deliver your repast as soon as it is prepared. Would you care to await us in the parlor, where your Alpha requested you remain?” Fred swept past them, assured they would take his suggestion as a command. Gabe scuttled by, still nude, and Kali followed more slowly with April’s hand in hers. Michael touched April’s cheek as she went by and shared an affectionate look that didn’t linger.
“No. We’re waiting. You need a good four weeks to heal sufficiently before we go at it again.” Cas was dressing. Why was Cas dressing?
“I just had the most wonderful day with my pups and my husband,” Cas replied.  “Sunshine does wonders for a sour disposition.”
“Sit down, Omega” ordered Cas as another thump sounded from below the table. It was not a good day to decide to pull the alpha from the conversation. Cas thought about tabling the discussion until Dean could join him, but Gabe…Gabe was HIS brother. Dean really had nothing to do with it. Castiel cleared his throat. “Michael, would you be so kind as to ask your Sub if he has any problem with my taking this situation in hand without input from him?”
Jack cut in. “Well, only one is a Dom. The other is a Sub. She’s there to help show you what to do and to take the pressure off a little. It’s a safe way to handle the unknowns for a first timer. If you turn out not to be Submissive, then the scene can continue, but they adjust. Sometimes when that happens, the Dom uses the client as an object of submission for the Sub. He would make her take care of you. You know, that kind of thing. And you still get what you came for. And if you
