Sherlock was staring at John, where he sat reading in his chair, unaware and ignorant that Moriarty was now talking in great detail about his hypothetical demise. Hypothetical. And Sherlock would make sure that's all it was.
"You're correct, in a way." He says, gathering the condensation from his water onto his fingers. "And I'm sure that's something you hear constantly, so that's just falling on deaf ears I suppose—"
He stops, frozen, as he turns to the sitting room.
His walks became longer; once or twice he even risked the rising morning to talk to the postmaster and the stable boys before retreating back into the castle walls, avoiding the wings he knew he would find his husband in, and his husband’s constant companion.
“These feelings, they fade with time.”
“There’s a patron at the Diogenes Club that I work with. He often complains of his leg that aches in the cold. It’s his right one, the one he was shot in when he was a young soldier. He’s an old man now and that wound has been long healed, but it still bothers him some days. He swore once that when it snowed his leg burned as if he’d just been shot again and he’d collapsed to the ground from the pain. Other days he says it feels like a memory, a dream of what happened.”
Will my memory stay clear?
Sherlock huffed in irritation. "The question, John."
Sherlock is engrossed in his review of the evidence, though not too far gone to miss the movement outside the door. Outside the window, an owl hoots loudly in the quiet night.
"That's good."
The day was good for a ride. The sky above was bright and blue and big, the rolling clouds forming a thin blanket that fluttered across the sun, casting their great dark shadows on the plains.
Cold air whistles through the holes of the rotting wooden roof as birds chirp, fluttering through the creaking beams above. Speckled chickens scuffle around the muck of broken hay and mud, pecking about for anything edible. Somewhere in the near distance, cattle groan in their pasture and goats bleat back at them.
The ringing faded.
He turns into an alleyway, a shortcut he's long used upon the not-uncommon shortage of taxis.
Alkeav hesitates then nods. He walks to where his coat hangs on the back of his door, warily eyeing Sherlock, who steadfastly stares at him like a mongrel stares at meat, and digs through the pocket before drawing out a carefully folded note.
“What will you do?” He asks, not looking Lita’s way.
“You want to sing with me?” Mikheia smiles before his humming ascends into lyrics. “‘There near the Sava,
“Nonsense. You’ve fought me before. Remember outside
“Honestly, they have the worst bloody timing—hello?” He looks up as he places the receiver against his shoulder. “I’ll be back later, right?”
"You and John match now, you know."
“How did you know it was here? You called, you told me to stay inside—”
"John? Are you alright?" Sherlock asked as John pushed past him out of the stall to the sink.
“Look at the facts, brother mine, and then allow yourself to hope. One body was found.”
The halls are healing like bruises, the mottled purple and pale blues of dawn blooming on the white paint.
Sherlock came to settle in front of him, between his knees. His hands came up to rest on John’s shoulders, separated by a thin layer of cotton shirt as he stared down at his mate. “I love you, John. If I didn’t, I would have stayed in Shanghai. I would have been gone long before Norway...of all people, you know best that I don’t suffer under situations I find intolerable—”
“Mutually assured destruction at this point.”
The door softly shuts in front of Sherlock, effectively blocking him from the man on the other side.
art? Ay, there's the rub, and it rubbed him in all the wrong ways. Music had melodies and equations and formulas. There was no science, no useful information to be gained from a statue or painting, and religion even less so than fact. Epiphanies were not to be had looking at smears of colour; one simply did not find God in a painting, even if His hand was outstretched to you.
One day he wakes up to a mouthful of fur from that damned dog. Not exactly what he wanted. He wants John, he wants to feel warm skin under his fingers and listen to John’s heart beating until he wakes up. He does not want this mongrel licking him awake.
After the initial panic of running through the flat half-awake, he's had time to think about the possibilities of what could have happened to John. He supposes that he should be concerned that John isn't there with him, and he is to some degree. He would've been astoundingly worried if he wasn't so sure his assumption was correct.
"John, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it was an accident. It was an accident, John, please, Moriarty is here, we have to go, we have to go—"
A long shadow crawled its way up the wall across from him, like a spider. He could hear someone shouting commands in his radio. He raised his tranquiliser gun and took careful aim at the shadow before he felt a solid punch to his right shoulder. Fire licked at the joints, searing through bone and muscle and tendon like he was made of butter. He looked down.
"But the likelihood that they are in Sarajevo are staggering. The ratio alone must be in the triple digits—"
against a trained marksman? I'm positively quaking in my little boots."
John sends him a picture of a shirt crumpled onto the floor of Sherlock's bedroom, along with the text:
"I'll need you with me." Sherlock said.
“Ah, thanks.”
“I know.” Azazel grins wildly. “I just want it to hurt.”
“I keep seeing him kill you. I didn’t look then and now it’s all I see. Even when you’re right here, he’s still cutting you open.”
"I found it." He gasps. "I found where they killed Rachel."
." Jim drawls out the last word.
"Yeah, Henry took care of it. All that's left is to…to turn her over."
As the flames rise, bursting upwards like bright shoots in spring, Moran draws his gun and aims at Mikheia, and John trains his own pistol on Moran.
He’s smiling.
The figure said something quietly, in English. It was a man, his voice raspy and harsh as if it hadn't been used in years. He didn't know much of the language, but he'd pick up a few of the basics from a traveller or two.
“It is at the moment – well, it’s Sherlock’s anyways.”
"If it was sadism," Sherlock says as if he hasn't heard anything the DI has said. "You would see welts, bruising, something to indicate that she was beaten or tortured to suggest sexual gratification from suffering. The more the killer supposedly enjoyed causing pain, the more she suffered. Other than the hole in her chest and her palm, there's no telling mark on her."
John stared at him incredulously.
"Promise."
Sherlock made a face.
"I'm going to go tonight." John replied firmly. "Unless you have another idea rattling around in that brilliant head of yours."
“Hnn.” John hums, attempting a
John would be very sorry to have to shoot him.
The fridge had been left open, the light still on but the rest empty; a crisper drawer had been disturbed. He went to his knees, careful not to disturb the large bloodstain, and looked around the floor of the kitchen, spotting a dark shape below the bottom lip of one of the cabinets.
Sherlock swallows harshly. “Of course you were.”
Sherlock snatched the bowl from Mikheia's shaking hands and grabbed a handful of towels, mindless of the stinging temperature, and hurriedly attacked John's skin, slopping water on the floor. He hoped the feeling of heat on open wounds would be enough to snap him awake.
The air grew thicker with mist as her beat-up old wagon climbed into the mountains. It was a stretch to assume Will had come here, but if she knew him—and she knew him well—he would be in their spot, the little niche the three of them had carved into the world that was just for them.
Artemisia shrugs. “Words, they are travelling fast in our circles.”
"What's that?"
Sherlock uncorked the bottle. “Yes, mother.”
"I know how I feel about leaving you, I know how I feel about being away from you, and I know how I feel about coming back to you, as unexpectedly welcome as it was. I also know that you are still upset with me for what I did, but I think this rather makes us even. We both have seen each other dead in another sense than the cessation of bodily function."
Something about this hospital made him uneasy. Mycroft had assured them copiously that the security on the hospital was airtight and that they were perfectly safe here in Berlin, but John still felt uncomfortable, especially after Sherlock's scoff at his brother's declarations of safety. Yet Sherlock would not allow Mikheia to be treated here if he felt it was fully unsafe. John smirked. Like Sherlock had any say in what happened now, much less where Mikheia was treated. And it wasn't like they had had many options to choose from after he'd been shot. They'd had to do the best with what they had. But he and Mycroft had silently agreed long ago to pretend in all situations like Sherlock was the one in charge and let him feel important, even if he was being an arsehole;
“He had a way with words as well. He’s right, though. He’s exactly right. You know no other existence than the one you burn in. I didn’t know—I never realised I couldn’t hurt. It wasn’t a possibility.” She pauses, licking her lips. “If you knew how it was, you’d know how happy he was here, with you. It was enough to be in this world, but for him to be in yours—you can’t fathom how much he wanted it. We’d all be in the darkness, burning, and he had a different heat in him. I could feel it. You gave him something none of us had ever had before.”
John hears him come in and turns, wordlessly holding up Sherlock's phone so he can see the screen.
"Tell me what you've done to him. Tell me
Mikheia looked down to them for a moment.
“You said you built a chasm—” He says finally. “You’re comparing me…to water.”
“They’ll be alright here without me.” John answered firmly. “You need protection – he might know about the plan, and I don’t like the idea of you alone in a room with him.”
"No." Sherlock growled. "You're not some carrot to dangle before the bit. I won't have it."
"Are you
The voice laughs, and it bounces off the walls.
“Can't you just run it? What if he catches up?”
But I won't probably get very far
He laid his head in her lap and she softly stroked his temples, lulling him into a calm, exhausted sleep.
, this hurt deep in my gut that screams that something has been violated. What’s more, these things don’t just happen randomly. That Tenebest didn’t just decide that it fancied a waltz through London. It was sent here, like I was, and it was within, what, two blocks from you? That’s not what I call coincidental. I knew I had to protect you, that I had to be prepared for the worst; I had to be
Mikheia holds out a hand and John takes it, standing a bit stiffly. He smiles.
Artemisia said nothing at breakfast, taken in the closed garden parlor on the veranda, the faint purple of the sun blending into the dark horizon through the greenery and darkened glass panes of the transparent room.
him." Sherlock admitted quietly. "I could not be trusted with his life any longer. I think you'll find that I am most careless with the things that have the most value."
can sit there and watch, you great panda."
"You are not dreaming."
“This beast,” He says, following after John. “What are we going to call it?”
“To what are you referring?”
“It is better than being dead.” Mikheia answers solemnly, pouring their cups before grabbing the pitcher from the sink and setting it on the table. John begins to reach for the milk and grits his teeth at the strain but Mikheia bats his hand away like a mother keeping her child from sweets and sets it down in front of him.
from here, huh?"
The empty hall.
Sherlock's Enlightenment Room of his Mind Palace is inspired by the eponymous wing of the British Museum I visited last month, pictured above. Keep this room in mind, it becomes important later! I believe the picture even contains something vitally important, so do keep an eye out.
Mikheia's brow knitted.
“Well you put it there.” John says tartly, as if to finish it with
His phone rang three times.
He sighed, folding the note and putting it into his jacket next to the canteen. Sherlock didn’t know where he was – as far as he was concerned, John was still in Petrograd, wading through the political mire, or he was in Moscow, embedding himself within the Bolsheviks. Mycroft wouldn’t have told him, as they both knew Sherlock had forced a promise from him not to re-enlist, and, technically, he hadn’t; aide-de-camps didn’t have to belong to any certain military, and he thought it best to hide in plain sight – Moriarty would hardly think to check a remote Allied camp surrounded by the Red Army; he would think he was headed to S, to Central Europe, somewhere safe where he could regroup; that was his great flaw, his underestimation of John and his abilities.
"A higher one, in generalised terms." John smiles. "It likes to appear as what the individual perceives it to be. It's called Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Shintoism, the solar system, science." John wants to bottle the surprise on Sherlock's face. "You call it epiphanies. I call it outside help."
"The desert. Tell me about it."
"Henry?"
He was smoking.
“Don’t tell me I’m wrong, Sherlock Holmes. I know you. You were laying bait.”
"Is that a complaint?"
person. He lies, he steals, he's fond of drug or stimulant dependency, he's possessive, he's cold and cruel and deceitful, and he considers it a compliment to be called inhuman. What lies in his heart that makes you so sure that he's the one you need to protect?"
Happy Holidays & Merry Christmas everyone!
"Ah, and so the cavalry cometh." Moran said with a bark of a laugh and John didn't need a second glance to know that the men getting out were heavily armed.
Later, he thinks about how odd it was that her last words were her death warrant.
“Charming as always.” Irene sighed. “John asked me to come talk to you.”
"What did you do, Mary?"
raindrops splashing against the soft speckled brown. He feels each one as it bursts against the mottled down, feels the weight of each dampened feather as it grows heavier with water.
“Ta,” John replied, going back to his magazine.
“I’ll say – here I am thinking I’m a world traveler when you’ve got me beat by miles! I mean, I thought you were in Morocco last I heard; I didn’t think I’d have to project myself all the way over to bloody Pakistan! Really, John, you couldn’t have picked some place better? Without so many flies?”
"It was not my intention to make you feel pain. You hurt because of these, yes, but they are also beautiful."
John could see them at a distance, burrowed in the thick trees of the forest. They set off down the road, breaking through the underbrush. As they got closer, John could hear music, blaring from the inside of the car, its doors left wide open, left in park. The brake lights were still on.
Sherlock trailed off into meaningless threats that John knew he said out of panic and frustration, threats he had no intention of keeping.
“Would you rather I kiss you, Sleeping Beauty?”
"Why is that?"
He could wait a little longer. He’d done it enough by now.
"And what am I?"
Sherlock is silently relieved that Lestrade doesn't ask any more questions than he needs to. He might be in awe of this fact, considering that he was a DI and curious by nature, if they all hadn't been in mortal danger.
"Surely you'd have something to say to me after your long absence."
He could hear the exact sound of the strings as they vibrated against Sherlock’s long fingers, could almost tell the scrape apart of his pads as he played. The echo of the wood was very fine; he was playing the Stradivarius then, 1712, a gift for his birthday.  They had been in St Petersburg at the time, newly minted capital of Russia, and had used the plague at Vienna as a handy escape from questioning glances and aging friends. That had been the last straw for Bohemia; after they’d glutted themselves on the carnage of the Protestant’s War or whatever they called it these days, they'd gotten out of Central Europe on the double.
"Doing what, exactly?" John answers, and his voice is too calm and unaffected to appease the great red irritation.
“What’s wrong, love?” John asks, sitting on the ottoman just behind him.
“Yes,” Harry answers, “for all of us, yes.”
“Apologies.” I reply as I stand to shrug on my coat.
But not now.
The two sat beside each other, and witnessed it all unfold below.
, so eventually he stopped. He stopped trying and accepted his fate. What else could he do?
"No," John agreed, as pleasantly as if they'd been chatting about the certainty of a coming storm.
“No, you’re not.”
"You can't think that saying those words can solve everything, Sherlock…" He said before opening his eyes again. "You know, before, in the bathroom, I wasn't lying or being overdramatic or anything." John said quietly, looking out at the scenery or the rusted iron railing or anything but Sherlock. "When I said that…when I said maybe I was wrong about us."
A hand grasped him on the shoulder and he turned sharply. John had barely enough time to react, leaning back in an attempt to keep his wine from spilling.
“Suicide, actually.”
He’s cut off as something blurred and hard barrels into him harshly, arms wrapped around him like a garrote.
“While we're here, do call me Sebastian, won't you?”
“I don’t want to live in a world that doesn’t include you.” John continued softly. “That doesn’t mean I haven’t considered it; watching everything pass us by, the patterns, the endless path of nature that we can’t change…humans have done terrible things, and so have we. It’s hard to live with that, and to see it happen over and over. But I never thought about leaving you without telling you why. It
"No, I'm merely saying that I would prefer revenge since what led you here can apparently take you back. I don't have the power to send you away; that's Sherlock's decision, and I would favour that it remains his, not someone else's'." Mycroft stares at him for a moment, his fingers tapping the arm of the chair. "Who do you answer to, John?"
“And neither was it yours. You need to move on—”
"I have no intention of leaving you, John, as I'm sure you well know."
"Glad to hear it." John smiled, but there was something inside it, something bright and alive that made Sherlock's heart pound in a way he hadn't often felt. As John leaned forward his heart grew louder, more frantic, more crazed, breaking out of its rusted state.
Mycroft frowns. “What do you mean—?”
“Have you ever thought about it? Since we’ve met?”
"Wonderful, considering I had a homicide to take care of as well as the trivial knowledge that angels are real—and
The man's eyes had darted around before he licked his lips.
"Honestly, Sherlock," John laughed, but his eyes were sad, they were abjectly lonely and if he never looked at Sherlock again like that as long as they lived, Sherlock would die a happy man. "What did you expect? That I'd welcome you back like nothing happened and then we'd skip off into the sunset?"
for me. In fact they were the opposite of a
"After I left you, in Norway," he began, "I didn't know where to go. I thought...maybe get off the continent. Go to England. Go to the New World."
Sherlock said nothing, and played his last move. Moriarty sighed.
"John." Sherlock's voice brought him back. "
The room is just as bare as it ever was. Chipping wallpaper, bare carpet, empty fireplace. Weak light filtering in through grimy windows.
"221C, of course." Moran smiles. "Honestly, didn't anyone think to check?"
“So, what have you both been up to?” Harry asked, relaxing against the arm chair.
“You must be Sherlock Holmes.” A womanly face smiles at him, straight teeth, blonde hair, freckles
He was free to pursue with all of his great and terrible being.
“I wanted you for myself.” John continues, unaware. “I coveted you, forced myself into your life. You didn’t deserve my affections. If I had never come, you could be living a normal life, a
"What is it that you find so humorous about me not grievously harming your person?" Sherlock asks, his tone clipped and clinical.
I’ve lived for more than half a millennium…almost 600 years now. Six centuries of watching man learn little, and progress slowly. I understand why the world might be a source of pain for you. I think…most people – humans at least – don’t have the time that we do to process everything. There just isn’t time for them to understand the purview of life and its consequences; their lives are short, and their memories shorter, and it altogether makes for a terribly shortsighted existence. It can be easy to look at them and believe that they have learned nothing, will never learn, that they will always be this way, and in some ways, that’s true. I know you remember what it was like to be one of them, and it isn’t fair to condemn a whole race for their crime of having a short and finite lifespan. They don’t see the things that we see.”
“Exactly how
“She’s hungry, Sherlock.” John cut in. “One more won’t hurt. But just one more, understand?”
Azazel looks down at him, the glee draining from his face into a sober stare.
"Do you know what keeps your organs in place, John?" He asks in the quite noise of the forensic team's investigation.
“Your insistent desire to sacrifice yourself is very hard for me to witness.” He says quietly, and he hates how clinical he sounds.
“A toast.” He said, handing Sherlock his glass and sitting beside him. “To good fortune.”
“What would you like me to say, John?” Sherlock snaps. “Would you like me to drop to my knees and kiss your feet until you forgive me? I would. Would you like me to express the infinite regret I feel at attacking the
“I would have followed you. Into the fire.” He tries to lay his head against John’s, tries to dig his fingers in his shirt, but of course there’s nothing there for him to touch. “I would have followed you anywhere, I would have…would have…”
“What aren’t you telling me Mycroft?”
“The time stamp has been altered. Why?”
"No." She says cheerfully. "But we can try."
"For three years," Sherlock began softly. "When I was alone, when I thought of you-which was quite often, actually, more than I'd tried to-I imagined what this would be like. Being with you."
“Lestrade—”
“Stop being a deliberately ignorant, self-righteous
"What?" John's brow scrunches in confusion.
Sometimes the wounds ache but they don’t hurt, and we forget we had them. He’ll kiss me or I’ll do something mad and he’ll smile and we are all fine aren’t we? We arein the room together and it is all fine in that moment. We’ve got a case coming up, the first since my supernatural return, or miraculous, depending which side of the fence you’re on.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow.
"No...just me." Sherlock tried to smile, but he was too consumed with that slow heat, with fascination at this man beneath him, in him, this man that was saving him and didn't even know it.
"Tell me what?"
"You sound like that anyways."
John had offered a quiet kiss in the back of that open-air compartment but didn't like the smoky taste of Sherlock's mouth, still reeking of cigarette. Later, Sherlock had countered with a sudden nuzzling of John's neck as he'd napped, but John had woken with a start, sending a fist into Sherlock's face as he shouted something about 'don't—not there' which degenerated into a mumbled apology about knives and boilers. John had later tried to apologise, although they both knew who was at fault, but Sherlock didn't have the heart to try any other alternative approach.
blood-crazed vampires, sucking the life out of a 12-point stag? We’d kill them all, fine, or one would get away and tell the others if we didn’t get him first. The court would be suspicious – two lone survivors of a gory bloodbath, one of them seeming a foreigner, and with no good alibi?
Sherlock looks at him for a moment. “So she would know it was pointless.”
“Nothing. Just a feeling.” He said simply, glancing back into the canal. “It was like—”
as he grasped at a pulse that Sherlock had been sure to erase.
. So I was, for you. For myself too if I’m being honest, because there isn’t a way that you could die that wouldn’t take me with you.”
John attempts to grab a cup off a shelf he can’t reach and huffs a heavy breath of air as he stretches what Sherlock expects are sore muscles. Nearly falling off a roof and flying over London will do that to a person.
"Why did you go after Moriarty?" John asked, but it was more rhetorical than biting with venom. "He tortured me. He told me things that night—I don't know if I'll ever tell you what he said. I don't think I ever will tell you."
Or…Mikheia was here? But that didn't make any sense, why would he be? And if he was, how the
Sherlock hummed. “One can dream.”
As soon as they are alone, Sherlock groans.
“Uh, it was a pretty random meeting, just one of those things, you know? I was driving a backroad round midnight and I saw him pulled over with his hood up, so I stopped to help him.”
. There has to be something. There has to be a reason for that weight, for that faint clattering sound he heard, there's always a reason—
“No, you’re right, but I
Sherlock politely doesn’t notice the delirium tremens as Ishido reaches for his drink, his standard fare of seltzer water and cherry flavouring for colour that he’d affectionately called The Hooker Spasm in a moment of self-deprecation.
John remains silent, staring coldly at the demon, whose eyes burn with delight as he steps forward.
"We can live together without it. Baker Street is just an address we use for mail."
“Do you hear it?” Sherlock asked, equally still. John concentrated, and heard another heartbeat, faint and muted.
He placed the gun beside him on the bed. The box was so much lighter now. He didn't want to reach in again, didn't want this discovery to end, he wanted it to be infinite, to know that there would always be more of his soldier to uncover, yet soon he found that his hand scraped the bottom and for a moment he panicked. Surely that couldn't be all he had to remember him by. There was so much more that defined him than a
He woke in Vienna, in a bed less full than it should be. He’d only needed space for one, and so there was space for one, but he traced the familiar path of the missing body anyways, feeling at once that it had been a mistake to go in the first place and a mistake to leave.
“You...want to see him again?”
John’s fork clatters to his plate and he sends an irate glance into the universe, as if it was the one who annoyed him and not me.
It had been the first contact with Mycroft he’d had in that new century. The false papers he’d gotten easily enough on his own, but he’d needed a position as far away from bureaucracy as possible, and Mycroft had been too happy to help, in exchange for occasional intelligence from the front; John knew he was indispensable, if not for the information he offered than for his importance to Sherlock, and he wasn’t afraid to use that fact as leverage to swing himself as close to the war as he could get.
“To use a common phrase of yours, there was no data to extrapolate from. For good reason, too.”
"Imbecile…" Sherlock mutters before turning to John. "Why did you correct him?"
"Moriarty didn't kill you tonight because he was sending a message to me." Sherlock turned, looking John square in the eye. "He was telling me that he can kill you whenever and wherever he wants, and there's not a thing I can do to stop him. The only thing in his way is whether he feels like it or not."
Mycroft picked up on the first ring, expecting the call ever since he watched John and the landlady leave for the cemetary.
"I never wanted to leave you, John." Sherlock begins, and tries to clear his throat of the invisible obstruction that's choking him. "If you should be sure of anything in this life, it's that I could never voluntarily leave you. I couldn't. I can't."
There was something very odd about Holmes, something idiosyncratic apart from the rest of the world. His peculiar bluntness, the way he seemed to be wound with some strange focused tenacity…things were going to get interesting in Twin Peaks.
Just as he began to graze against something, Sherlock blurted: “Irene fed from me.”
"He hasn't."
"Yes, Sherlock, I'm fine." John said with a rasping voice. "You?"
He'll ask him later.
"I know what I saw."
Mikheia paused, unsure of how to continue. He was considering Sherlock's feelings, something people usually tended not to do. How quaint.
He steps forward, but Harry is already there, kneeling beside her brother's prone form.
And don't replace what you've been missing until you know what you're lacking
"It's called America now, John. Surely you haven't forgotten."
“Only if you bring the beast with you.”
It's only later, when he's running through the woods, when he hears John's cry of pain and a triumphant howl and turns away from Lestrade to run towards it, that it occurs to him that John didn't tell Lestrade he loved him or Mycroft or Molly or Mrs Hudson or anyone on the street or at the bed and breakfast.
Nico unwound the cap and raised it in a toast. "Salute," he said, not without irony, and took a deep drink before nearly coughing it back out again as soon as he tasted it.
“Because,” Sherlock says quietly, hoarsely, shutting his eyes. “I can’t look at you right now.”
“You have myself, Sherlock, that is true, but you also have Gregory and Miss Hooper and Mrs Hudson. Do not allow your grief to limit your perception. John was not, and will not be, the only one that cared for you. In his own way, perhaps he was singular, but in other ways, he was excluded. No one will love you as a brother as I do. You’d do well to remember that.”
“Splitting hairs, Sherlock.”
"Yes he will. He knows John's value to me, that I'd get in here one way or another."
was because I thought you had one of my workbooks from our field experiment in Bonn. If I had not needed it at that precise moment, if I was not interested in that particular data, you would be gone by now. I would have come back from the labs, probably hungry – you might have saved me something like you do, or else you might be in one of your moods and demand I get it myself.”
right now so much as
"I couldn't even endure the thought for two seconds." He muttered, dragging his arm away and looking over at John with a troubled expression. "How? How could you do it for three years?"
“Any serious international criminal would have a network of contacts, especially one as big as Moriarty. It just makes sense. So I started off in the big places, Berlin, Paris, Moscow—though I should’ve realised if anyone could make a cross-continental trip in less than a day, you could’ve.”
"What's so funny?" Sherlock asked, frowning.
John’s continued martyrdom has dredged up the bitters in whatever part of himself that he let them settle in.
Ignoring John's rising protest, Sherlock stood from between the rusting machines, something steeped in darkness somewhere inside him swelling with rage. His hands fisted at his sides.
"Maybe you believe in angels."
"A great practiser of the Vulcan nerve pinch, are you?"
At least not until he was far into adulthood…too far to acknowledge what he'd been missing out on, yet at an age where he could objectively appreciate what he found and what he felt.
Blood? John can’t bleed, he can’t bleed
Stay tuned for next time! I promise John's going to get more facetime soon!
“It’s funny, is it?”
"Is she responsible?"
“Should I ask where you’ve been or do I not want to know?” Greg asks, looking up from the paper as John and Sherlock walked into the room.
“Harry.” Sherlock said lowly. “Our morning wake-up call.”
“I think someone rang downstairs.”
John looked up at him as he left the bedroom.
“What could I have said?” I ask. This is awful, I don’t know what to say. I never know the right thing to say, even though I’d expected this night, though I’d dreamed of it, though I’d thought about it more than anything else, I didn’t have anything planned at all. I thought I’d had time. “What could I have done to make you whole? To make you hurt less? I didn’t take you with me, and the fact remains: why? I could say you’d slow me down, I could say I didn’t want you there, but the truth…the truth is you were a liability.”
Sherlock pursed his lips. He could save money if he accepted, but then he'd also have to be polite. Decisions, decisions. He smiled. It felt rubbery.
His first conclusion was
"'Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'
When he was 35, he dreamed of darkness that smelled like chlorine and sweet clots of blood and a John that was Not-John.
The detective interviewing the man had been lacklustre in his career, middle-aged and bored and no longer as curious of crime as he once had been.
in this godforsaken mansion
what he has done to him. Sherlock feels shame, hot and fast, well inside him and he tries to quell it, to lance this great heavy pulsing thing so it bleeds out to somewhere he can’t feel it.
"I have an idea." John says, but he doesn't elaborate.
John takes a step towards him, slightly invading his ever-present cushion of personal space.
“He does like to do it now, though.” Irene says with a wicked grin. “Nothing turns a man on quite like himself. He loves it when I take his form and suck—”
They raced across the dirt and scrub, out past the empty pig pens, past the junk in yard, the detritus of human life. The moon was full, hanging low, its light falling in waves over the dunes, the sleeping and unknowing world, utterly uncaring if the man staggering ahead of them was good, or if he would live to see the morning, or if he deserved to. What the night knew was only how to witness, how to wrap them up in darkness, how to hide their secrets in its mouth.
He had not been alone, truly alone, in over three hundred years.
Tell him. Tell him. Tell him. He needs to know.
"You'll tell us everything." John said, back still turned to watch the street. His tone brokered no argument, but Sherlock already knew Irene would talk. He knew the moment she appeared again—she'd never let them know where she was unless she wanted them to.
, I'll consider letting you interrogate him after I'm done."
"What did he inject you with?"
He'd never experienced it before.
If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.
John stares at me hard for a moment before he smiles a rueful hateful little smile and gets up.
The voice makes a hum of amusement. “I will allow you to keep your jokes, John, for now. No one lasted an hour in that room because where there is silence, there is nothingness, and it’s the kind you notice sooner rather than later. You were in this cell for ten minutes before I spoke. Ten minutes of quiet. Your hearing adapted in that time, did it not? Your breathing sounded louder to you because it was the only thing you heard. When it’s quiet, you notice the finer things. The more silence, the more nothingness to pad your ears, the more you notice. In this anechoic room, there is one chair they give you, one chair that you’ve convinced yourself you’d never sit in; it’s a sign of weakness; if you sit in it, and you’re stronger than everybody that’s come before you. And so, you stand in the quiet, alone.
“I believe I told
"I am not the one you're mad at."
"Good. I don't want any cheating in this round. A fair fight to the end."
"Just a mad thought in the mad mind of Sherlock Holmes." Mary sighed. "Ah, well, no harm done." She eyed his bandage. "Not to me, anyways. How is it today?"
The ground is wet, gravel and mud mingling together in a murky state. He’s careful to avoid the puddles. Too obvious. Too dangerous. Nachash probably knows they’re here anyways.
things like sunrises or fetal development or a rainbow when they don't want to explain it or learn the knowledge themselves."
For the first time in three years, Sherlock and John were alone together.
mysterious with his bloody fucking feathers and his cheekbones…”
John smiles and runs a hand through Sherlock's riotous curls.
"John."
“You were dehydrated probably. Knowing you and your dietary schedules, I’m pretty certain. When did you eat last?”
“The good news is it’s most likely an anterior dislocation, which means we can manually reset it.”
“It’s nothing we can’t come back from.”
"I just want a look around."
possibility, at least to him. Death would and could happen to everyone but John. John was too good, too pure, too human for death. It was as if Sherlock had deluded himself into thinking that his affection for John alone was untouchable, that it cocooned itself around him and made him invincible.
“I wanted to die.” Sherlock bit out, knuckles white from his grip on the chair. “I still do. Why must you insist on stopping me?”
"Sherlock told you, didn't he?" John sighs as he flips on the kettle.
you gracelessly incompetent block of space, he's had recent head trauma!" Sherlock bit out. If he couldn't physically help John, verbal abuse might at least make him feel better. "If you want him alive, you never do that again you great idiot!"
"They told me to
His Arabic was written beautifully, such a dark calligraphy. The writing lilted off. John had left to do something else. It returned:
Sherlock would rather smash his fist in their face. Or throw himself over John. Or both.
So, John gave it to him, finding new mysteries, encouraging his research and interests, hosting dinners and surprising him with secret gropes under the table while the court and aristocracy gabbled, dragging him into hidden dalliances in the nooks and crannies of whatever castle they happened to be at. Although Sherlock had never actually admitted to it, John knew he had been relatively untouched before they had met, and when his libido awakened with astonishing and ambivalent curiosity, John had played the game with him, found fun in hunt and seduction, but he had never enjoyed it as much as his husband did, perhaps because it was always easy; a barrel of fish did not compare to the wild river. So, suffice to say, over the years he had become quite good at reading and interpreting one Sherlock Holmes.
“Don’t waste your breath on petty deductions,” Mycroft chided, twisting the cap off. “Tell me what happened,” and, as he passed the canister to his brother, he added firmly: “Feed yourself first.”
“What stopped you?” I ask, hoping he’ll smirk and say
Sherlock glanced up at him, and he knew what that answering grin meant. “Arty will be gone until dawn. We’ll have to find trouble somewhere.”
John sleeping beside him, talking to him, kissing him, loving him, that was something he couldn't quite name but he could
He lets his head loll to the side, revelling in the abdication of responsibility, in the loss of higher consciousness. He stares into the night, as wet and dark as it ever was, and he wants to hear John fumble around behind him with those ridiculous wings for tea or milk or a book or whatever he’d been looking for.
“Hello, love.”
"I did not mean it sexually, but if you chose to interpret it that way, I won't argue." Sherlock said, dipping his head and kissing John.
"I am trying."
"Afghanistan or Iraq?"
because his things are there, and this quite abhorrently is a hotel room—and contemplates how long he can wait before facing the other side. This thing he’s waited for, wanted, for two years, and he can’t bring himself to get up and go to it. He’d envisioned so many ways of seeing John again, and this had not been one of them.
“It's gone, John.” He said, unable to keep the disappointment from creeping into his voice, already fermenting bitterly within him.
John stares at him for a moment and Sherlock can see
"Explain it to me." Sherlock says, but it sounds almost like a question.
Sherlock shut his eyes, head lolling against the boxes. “I don’t know.”
M: Honestly, that was just kind of an abstract image or something in my head and I don’t know. I think Lot’s wife turned to salt when she looked back at the city. I think they used to pack bodies in salt. So there’s not specifically any meaning into it directly, but it seemed like a bad thing to have to live in salt. A lot of my lyrics approximate meaning without me knowing why they sound right."
Without raising his head, the fool stood, taking no care to scuff against the sleeping forms on the floor as he answered the call of his mistress, disappearing into the darkness where she waited.
The seat is dry.
"We knew her best and…I can't help thinking that it all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died, that someone killed her. I don't know, I don't know what to think anymore.
She looked up at him, her fingers running over the hair of her creation, kneeling in obeisance. "I'm still figuring that out. Why me, and not another. I was vulnerable. Perhaps that's why. I was determined to get what I wanted. Maybe I was just foolish enough to be used. Despite what we are, we used to be like them, too." She tilted her chin, gesturing to the only humans in the room, a man and woman who had fallen asleep leaning against one another. Their heartbeats were low and matching, deep in the susurrus of sleep.
"I'll sound egomaniacal."
It was the last thing she remembered before he fired into her chest.
Sherlock felt his heart race.
"What do you mean?"
"How is your stomach not full of monarchs?"
Sherlock disappears as he heads to the kitchen, leaving John a stupefied, muddled mess.
Sherlock groans and rolls himself over, tenderly touching his purpling cheek.
Disappointment curled inside him. A rowdy drunk. Nothing more.
"You warned me once, John, and that was enough. You didn't
"Wonderful. Now, do you have any theories on the killer yet?"
John Watson raised his gun and fired.
"What have you heard about the Golem?" Sherlock asked, watching Mikheia eat his lunch.
"It's morning now. And here they are, still alive. Perhaps your misanthropy needs an adjustment."
John chuckled. “It’s a little late for that, love. Couple centuries too late.”
It had been outside St. Bart's, proving that not only was fate cruel, it also had a sense of humour. Sherlock had just arrived back in London, his nose not yet immune the grimy smell as it once was, and he was even on his way to Baker Street because if he was going to see anyone after his exile, it was going to be John if he had any say in it. Some news station had sent a reporter to cover a story outside the hospital, probably about some new strain of the common cold or some other boring and tedious tale, but the reporter had stepped slightly off the curb during a live broadcast and Sherlock, passing by, merely took a moment to right her before moving on.
Sherlock stares at him, hard, for a moment, hands steepled in front of him. He stands slowly, takes the step that crosses their whole room, and kneels in front of John.
"Tell me, what does Watson think when he sees you two bickering like an old married couple? I think he gets jealous, not that he'll ever make it to old age—"
John frowned, clearly unconvinced. There wasn’t time for this now.
During the night, they live underwater. He manages to treat most of them as he would the day: make tea, read a book. But there are some nights that begin like the others—couched in the now-familiar blur of apathetic nothingness—that end differently. When the sun sets and the headlights begin to gleam through the windows, he marks his page and gets up. He shuts every light off in the flat. He unplugs all the clocks, tucks his laptop away. He turns on the bedside lamp beside John. He doesn’t look into his eyes much anymore. There’s nothing new to see.
"He says Kurgazov visited Bruges often."
. They've been in John's room, rifling through his things like a common thief. They've been
“She told you.” Sherlock’s eyes flashed.
“I did, yes.” John nods. “What about it?”
“I think you’re afraid to find out what I did to your friend.”
And a student of alchemy. That was interesting. Although anyone with an internet connection or nearby library could look it up and call themselves an expert. Something about the idea of change appealed greatly to this person. They were dissatisfied with some aspect of their life, most likely their invisibility to the audience they wanted. There certainly wasn't an age cap on learning, but judging by their background they'd most likely be in the middle of adulthood. If they were younger, they would still have the optimism so common of youth, and if they were older, they would be too jaded to act. No, they were Sherlock's age, or thereabout. He knew the feeling all too well. The internal screaming telling you to be noticed, the rage at being unappreciated when you knew you should be. The disappointment that turns bitter and poisonous and so very, very potent if you directed it at something that could be destroyed. This killer, they didn't have a John Watson or a Greg Lestrade; someone who offered the necessary tools to keep their mind occupied. A basic presence to cancel out the acidic rage.
The mist condenses on the window panes facing the quiet backyard, and water gathers on Sherlock’s glass as it lies forgotten on the bookshelf.
He was happily surprised to find that Mycroft had installed motion sensor lights in his lawn. Apparently his love of antique décor fortunately did not extend to security.
He unclipped his bracelet and handed it to her. His movements seemed stiff, like every motion pained him.
He freezes. His brain slows, jams in a grinding, painful halt.
“Sherlock—”
Her question caught him off-guard.
“Regardless, the statement is still true.” He sniffs.
"I'll make you tea."
"You think it's the same substance?"
As someone who had never experienced it himself, he couldn't describe it out of a first-hand account. Love was as foreign to him as decaffeinated tea or unused laboratory equipment or not having a body part in the refrigerator.
“Profoundly. You’ll be happy to know the vintage was undisturbed.” He stepped forward, pulling a vial from the pocket of his coat. “At your leisure, please see that this goes to Mycroft.”
He left without another word.
“Evening.” He says as he sits, joining his hands on the table as he glances around. “Lovely room.”
"You said
"Hm?"
“It’s long enough! Come on, the night’s wasting!” She said, leaping up into bed with them, jumping around for a few moments before bounding off again, hurrying outside and down the stairs.
This chapter takes place at the same time as Sherlock and Mycroft's part in Chapter Six ("Ime"), but not John being pulled from the river (for obvious reasons; this hasn't become a sci-fi time travel fic...yet?).
It’s a thought that’s been nagging at him since John came back. He’s told himself that it doesn’t matter, John is
"So there's no chance of you letting me go."
Sherlock leans back in his chair, feeling his throat swell shut as knots of cold iron churn in his stomach like ice.
John didn't answer, his eyes fixed on the opposite seat.
"No, I think I'll go in if that's alright with you—" Sherlock begins, brushing past Lestrade to get into the interrogation room, but the DI is faster than expected and grabs him none too gently by the wrist.
"Be that as it may, no one survives without a heart."
John skidded to a halt, nearly tripping himself.
Some part of him, however small, was quite jealous at the dexterity it was being shown.
“That he does.” John agreed, laying back against the seat of the plush chaise, his teeth beginning to recede as his eyes closed.
John opened his eyes. There was something heavy, something blurred and distant that Sherlock couldn't quite place.
"That will not help John, sir. You should try and talk to him."
Sherlock grins bitterly. His grip on John's hips tighten.
They hadn’t wandered far from the palace, and just as he could see its towers cresting far away in the distance, he heard another horse come up behind him, though he only heard one pulse.
In that quiet darkness of pre-dawn, there was fire.
"Where is the south—oh for fuck's sake."
When they went back into the bar, Harry and Billy were gone, empty beer bottle still on the table. John glanced at his husband, then broke away to circle around the small bar, glancing in dark corners and knocking on the one bathroom door. Sherlock strode outside, if only to confirm his worst suspicions.
The room was utterly silent, a vacuity, void of noise, movement, sound, save for one man's shaking breaths and the background sounds of the street.
“In the forest, earlier, and in my room, before we left…you said you love me.”
She smiled, patting down a wayward lock of hair. John could feel the grime of dried sweat all over him.
"Remind me to never get on your bad side."
of all places too—but I would come back to find that you'd moved on…to find that you weren't alone."
“Well, according to Lestrade, we keep him upstairs. It does get a bit of a draft. Plus I have to share my bed with a vampire and he likes to hog the covers.” John says dryly.
And I look out for you
"What about her lungs?" Sherlock asks suddenly.
“That’s the thing, Sherlock,” John shook his head, “I don’t know what I want. I thought this would help, especially after Paris…I thought being required again would help me.”
"Orso,
John leans down, kisses him softly, his hands tracing patterns over the curve of Sherlock's lower back. Sherlock hums lowly, pressing forward as his tongue lines the seam of John's mouth, but just as soon as he advances, he retreats, breaking away to press his face into the curve of John's neck.
"Do you think I did?" He says finally, and by then John's nearly forgotten he's asked a question.
"Unfair because I felt you'd left without living like you should have. Like you deserved."
He heard Mary run a hand over something.
He turns and Sherlock recognises a shade of himself in this man’s eyes; they are eyes that are watching their lives drain through the sifting, gapped fingers of fate.
I'll never be,
The heat. Easy enough to spot the source.
Sherlock’s smile falls into a sharp frown.
"Mary. What do you think I know about Mary?"

"Because you're good at what you do. Because there hasn't been one like you and there probably never will be."
are scary because of what you seem to be."
,” John continues, “I started looking through all the locations. I told myself it was for a lark at first, and some of the more obviously outlandish ones did make me laugh at the thought of you in them, but some…I don’t know, some had truth to them if you looked logically at it.”
"Whatever happened to 'In jail by dinner'?"
"Well obviously you enjoyed it enough. You initiated it three times more afterwards—"
He knew John had been disappointed by his daily activities, although he was too kind and polite to say so. John had heard 'burn what remains of Moriarty' and he took that to mean 'get the flamethrower, take no prisoners'. Sherlock hadn't warned him of the boring days, the days when the leads didn't pan out or he reached a dead end, the days when there was nothing to do but wait and drive yourself crazy.
Without another thought he leapt forward, grasping Moriarty by the jaw and smearing his glove against his mouth. The other man kept his teeth clamped shut, but John already knew, as he did, that contact was enough.
“But you almost were.” His mate said, bringing his head up to glare at him. “Due to our own errors in judgment. Due to the fact that we sacrificed each other at the altar of duty, what we felt we owed the world. Mark me now: I will not do it again. Do you understand? Not even if we get into another bloody war, which already seems inevitable.”
The sunlight was warm on his face, shining through the window in front of him. It felt nice. The metal cut into his neck. The fates had been merciful, allowing him only one day away from him before taking pity on him and letting Sherlock join him. He'd be glad to. He stopped struggling, letting his hands fall away. He'd make this an easy job for whoever it was. His heart pounded as he shut his eyes.
"Does it still hurt?" He asked quietly.
In these videos, Sherlock had seen himself. His curiosity had been piqued.
"I bet you dabbled in it."
“I’m okay, sir. Sorry about your head, Dr. Watson.”
Mikheia wondered if he would ever go back to Novgorod like they said he should. He was an adult in his own right, he didn't
"—this fish, pulls him out of the water, and Lestrade, hey—"
"You know," He said, straightening up against the wind. "If we were in the other's place right now, I don't think you'd tell me what you were really planning."
After they’d sulked off tail-tucked and cried to her, their gang boss sent out some underlings to break in and found Sherlock licking his wounds—or stitching rather, as it’d been messier than he’d anticipated; he’d blurted ‘Ninkyo’ through a mouthful of blood, holding up his hands, before they laughed, stopped beating him, and taken him into the heart of Kyoto to face their boss. He’d been thrown to the floor, his head held high as he looked at her, absolutely certain that he was going to die, and he didn’t see the beauty of Kita Seong-Eun before him, he saw his fingers running through short strands of golden hair inside his head, and he imagined what it would have felt like without feeling the pain of the knowledge that he could only guess. But instead of shooting him and leaving him to die, however, she smiled at him, and offered a hand to help him up; she knew, as he did, that it was better the tiger was kept in your cage, and not someone else’s.
Someone’s wading in the water, slowly. Not as fast as he wants. He wants running, he wants hurried splashing—a frenzy—because it means there’s something to be done to save him. Save John. That’s all he wants, all he’s ever wanted.
He dreamed his first dream in years, or at least one that he remembered.
—he spins now, unsteady on his feet, and the cold water splashing at his ankles ripples and reminds him just how high he is at the moment and Harry is still waiting, watching, just like John, same eyes even oh
"Many

It whines, low and keening, its weight shifting back.
“The only reason I found your
“Come down, Sebastian.” John calls into the rafters.
Graceless
“Not kill you, per se, but by the looks of it, at least maim you.”
Sherlock keeps his hands fisted at his sides. Donovan's breath hitches beside him.
"Oh."
Will mark you
“You asked what I want from you. I want this.” I manage to mumble against his cheek. “I want you and your kindness, your loyalty, your affections. I want your sentiment, John Watson.”
Alkaev turned down the hall, stiffness laced between the vertebrae of his spine. He seemed to want to be as far away from them as possible, and all but rushes to turn the corner to his wife’s station.
He could see the wounds now, sprawling across John's skin. So many, too many to count, small but deep, meant to hurt. They were...infinite.
The light blurs, swirling around in and out of itself, refracting in smaller atomised points, golden bubbles hanging around the corners of his vision. Or perhaps he’s dehydrated. Perhaps he’s stared too long. Perhaps lots of things. Perhaps, perhaps.
“You’d look good in yellow.”
The silences after angry outbursts are deafening, heavy with the realization that control had been voided for a few irredeemable seconds. John is staring at me and I can’t even call this an argument, he hasn’t said anything, he’s giving me nothing and I—
Sherlock ducks his head back in. "Coming?"
“It makes me forget.”
"You're an angel, John." Sherlock scoffs without looking up. "You're
—and sodium has a high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section—”
“Has it caught up to you then?” Mycroft asks as Sherlock trails past him into his dark bedroom.
He didn't have any options, and so he took the one that he was offered.
“I do.”
." Sherlock corrected. "How is your shoulder?"
"Most likely a one, if that. If I'd had a two or three, you'd have had to carry me here or to the hospital."
"You know what I mean."
"Do you?" Sherlock asks, trying to keep his voice calm, unaffected.
“There are worse things, Sherlock.” John interjects roughly. “There are far, far worse things than being shot, if it meant I’d have been with you. You’re worth any wound I’d ever get. But you left me. You made me think you were dead. Three years. For three years, I thought—I thought this was it. I thought this was the best my life could ever get, and then I lost you. You made me think you were dead, and I believed you.”
"John is not a tablecloth pawn to you. He is not someone that you would use then toss away. How are you going to get the information you require out of him?"
"What's he planning?" John asked, almost to himself, arms folded over his chest.
"Sentiment." Sherlock huffs.
John stays silent. The knives will come soon, or something painful, or some other hurt. He just has to wait them out. He knows it’s inevitable. War is never happy, or clean. War is pain. And he’s chosen his battles, hasn’t he? It was worth it—Sherlock was worth many things. He was worth it all, for that look John saw in his face that day in the street, when he thought he’d died. For that palpitating moment when he saw Sherlock on the news, right there in front of him—unmistakably, remarkably the same. For that day on the Thames, in the sand and the mud and dirty water, when Sherlock said
"the pain of war cannot exceed
." John groaned, tightening his hand on Sherlock's hip, his nails digging into the soft skin. Sherlock's breath was ragged like choppy waves on a dark beach, sliding against John's steady tide.
“We’re bonded, Sherlock. I
"Christ Sherlock, I meant did you cry or something, but okay, I guess that's good to know."
John’s voice comes so suddenly in the silence, that Sherlock thinks he’s imagined it. His gaze snaps up, to where John’s turned to look at him.
“It was never in fashion.” John mumbled. “Not even in the Dark Ages.”
The riotous momentum of their bond had faded now that John had put some distance between them, drawing back the dark feelings into a softer tide. And he had room to think again, as himself.
“They’re not saints.” John corrects, irate at the thought that somehow the man who had kidnapped him and then begun a psychological torture session decided he had the moral high ground to remark on anything that Sherlock or Lestrade did in a time of crisis. War had no rules, nor fingers to point with.
“Well, I don’t think you’ll ever want for commissions—” John said, coming short as she stopped in the middle of the narrow hallway.
"My job. As are you."
“I don’t think it matters one way or the other if I like it, Highness. If it pleases you, I’ll use it.”
this stings. Probably not helped by…chasing after Mikheia like that."
"You're here, wonderful." Lestrade says, dropping a leaf of papers back onto the gilded coffee table, and Sherlock is unsurprised to see the large tomes underneath that were so common with a vapid high-class culture pretending to be sophisticated. Other than the mess his team was currently making, the flat looked as untouched as the lunch room of a modelling agency. Too untouched for someone to live there…
“Azazel is a lesser demon. He’s weaker than Nachash is. His magic or voodoo or whatever you call it here, it’s not as powerful, but it’s the same level as John’s.”
With this revelation, Sherlock strode to the door, grabbing his coat and scarf and hastily shrugging them on.
“Yeah, I’ll bet he did.”
His shadow stretched in front of him as if it had just woken up. As if it had been strapped to a rack and stretched.
“Moriarty had other ideas, John.”
"No you didn't. Not really."
John raises an eyebrow and points.
Morning dawns cold against the walls, the blue of retreating night diving into a deeper hue until it begins to lighten, filtered through heavy grey clouds that blot out the weak sun. The smell of roasting coffee permeates the air, lying thick over vague traces of reheated food and gunpowder.
Mary hesitated, then began.
"You kicked me out of your room around two-thirty four this morning. Around three-thirty I heard restless noises and, knowing that you most likely caught cold from your swim, came up to check on you. As soon as you calmed down I left, but around four I heard noise again and decided it would be more pertinent to my sanity and your comfort if I moved you to my bed."
He goes home, but he doesn’t sleep. How can he?
“Is she here?” He calls over the din of the music, and Ishido nods, masking it from Ne’s gaze—among others’—with a drink from his glass.
"You have a plan?"
“I gave them swords and blush.” The demon murmurs. “I made them incandescent with death and beauty. Those were gifts, and I was repaid with a fall.”
One of John’s first lessons after they found each other was in Sherlock’s wavering tolerance for life. One day he might love it, become enamored with the bloom of a flower, the data of an experiment; the next, he would be disappointed that it all didn’t live to his exacting standard, falling short of whatever scale he had in that giant brain which forever weighed the benefit versus the price of existing on earth, feather to pound, in love with the shackle yet spiteful of it.
Tossing his sunglasses onto the foyer table, he scrambled to avoid toppling the towers of books and yellowed tomes around him as he tore open the seal and withdrew a large, flat disc.
He swallows roughly and nods.
Is it because his destination has been reached or because something has happened to John?
"Haven't you noticed how you always draw everyone's attention when you enter a room? It's like you spread these great loud feathers and people have no other option but to look your way. It's either your beauty or your formidability, I can't decide which. Maybe both."
"Was there really no one?"
“Crêpes.” Greg’s brow shoots up in surprise at such an easily conceded compromise. “Okay, well, I—uh—I’ll get on that.”
“Kill him?” Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “He’s like us; you can’t
"You're right."
Sherlock was silent as they made their way off the boat and onto the fondamenta, still full of masked revelers toasting the induction of carnevale, the great race, the libertine night here on the dark water.
He sits back, mulling his answer for a moment. "I think I will. She was just so young, Sarah. And her body—the brutality of it—it's just hard to take in. Hard to accept that it happened here, of all places."
Ah. Asleep on the sofa bed, curled away from the woman—Mary, was it? She was sleeping like they hadn't even kidnapped her. Must be a common occurrence—
“I never guess, I know.” He smiles then, his most charming smile, and practically hears Mycroft’s suppressed eye roll. “I believe Milo is expecting me.”
كرار كرار خبرې كوه
He was cut off by John's weak chuckle.
The cool night wind brushes at John’s temple as he stares across the line of salt at Azazel, now in the form of a man of mold.
"You can still leave." John said quietly, his voice echoing in the hollow church. Shadows cast themselves across his face. He hadn't shaved in a few days, as apparent by the fine stubble.
"The madame requests your immediate presence."
A loud howl—
"Good…" Mikheia smiled before his stomach started to growl. "But lunch first. Since you are the one with the crazy ideas, you are the one who will be paying."
"That's the point."
, John, and besides, I’d much rather hang out with my big brother.”
“No clocks.”
Sherlock Holmes had not been the only one to die that day. Even though he hadn't meant to, even though it was the last thing he wanted, he had managed to take John with him.
The lights are brighter than he expected, shining down on Moran like the light of heaven, or the shockwave of an atom bomb. He looks like a ghost already, pale and drawn, but his eyes are burning.
Why hadn't he realised that Sherlock hadn't told him the truth? At least not fully…he must've hoped John was too intoxicated to know the difference between the two facts, but surely he'd known that John would remember, surely he'd known that John was smart enough to tell the difference…
Mary smiled. Had he spoken out loud or was it in his head? He couldn't tell.
because I'm too much of a trainwreck to tell you myself. It's not enough."
John's eyes flickered back to the creature in white, its glowing embers peering back.
"Better than before. Mostly healed now."
"That Moran would still wish revenge on us after three years."
He had let her stay in his room, sleep in his bed. It was safer that way.
"Lestrade." Sherlock says, answering John's unasked question as he straightens in his seat. "Hello?"
"Sherlock, he doesn't have a pulse—"
"I'm sorry, John."
“We’re going home tomorrow.”
The first time it happened, it was an accident. Or John told himself that it was an accident, but some deeper, unacknowledged voice in him quietly whispered at night that it might have been on purpose.
“Oi,” John said, burrowing further into the junction of his neck, “none of that now.”
"And you know that I couldn't stop them even though I want to?"
Just thinking about him made John feel calmer. He rested his head against the seat, closing his eyes against the bright overhead lights, glaring through his tinted sunglasses.
“But that’s the problem—” John interrupted. “I didn’t know in Norway. Or maybe I did.” He shrugged. “I didn’t want to be right, I think. I’ve never faced something like that.
He'd have to call Molly later, it seemed. He had to pack all the warm clothes he owned.
"John."
. Earmark it and tuck it away for later. There were more pressing issues at present.
"What was in the bag anyways?"
“So that’s a yes, then. Antideluvian is the period between birth of the angels after the Earth was formed and before the Great Flood.”
“Wake up, Captain Watson.” Came the soft voice, thickened with a lilting English. “Time to wake up.”
"Perhaps one day, sir."
Harry rolls her eyes. "Something legitimate, please."

"No one knows, Sherlock. No one knows."
“There are no co-conspirators on this?”
“No, not fully, but his mother and sister won’t lack for anything. Have they been notified?”
“Your request might have to wait, I’m in an awful lot of pain here.”
"What if I want it?"
"It's called fascia. Dense, flexible tissue comprised mostly of collagen. Kind of like latex, I guess. Keeps everything in place for the most part; its track record of preventing disembowelment is, unfortunately, complete shite. Why'd you want to know?"
“John could break it, then?”
“People can surprise you, Sherlock.” John says before draining his coffee. “Right. I’m off to the shower. I still want to go out though. That wasn’t the caffeine talking.”
“Have you initiated a feeding with him in the interim?”
That must have been what it was today. Exhaustion. He'd let Sherlock sleep.
Sorry for the delay! Life gets in the way of some things, unfortunately. Enjoy!
“Yes, Sherlock.” Mycroft answers, his face turning back over his shoulder, yet he doesn’t meet his brother’s eye. “I trust you will find a way, as ever, to get what you want. You’ve always been persistent, and too clever for your own good.”
“She—you—wait, what?”
“Is it any of my concern?”
He understood it well enough. Of course he did. His first battle alone had ended in him cornered and panicking, allowing an enemy combatant to charge at him, then hurriedly firing three bullets into his skull at point blank range. The body had crumpled into the sand and he had learned what it was then to feel as if he was a god. The heady power that had coursed through him, the knowledge that
Mikheia pushes the door open, and John rolls the dice once more.
"He's your thrall." John concluded.
"Why haven't you left me?"
, as John always did. He was, if anything, consistent and Sherlock was, if anything, as anal-retentive about surveillance as ever before.
He was on it in an instant; the animal had no time to cry out, to run, to realize what was happening. Sherlock bit into its neck, through the fine, thick pelt and into the muscle, piercing the artery. It kicked out, trying to buck him, but he held on tightly.
"No."
He moves to stand, but a warm hand has wrapped around his wrist. He looks down to where John is staring back at him.
"You're forgiven, love." John said, and meant it.
"Neither of us needs nourishment, you more than myself, yet here we are. Eating."
*     *     *     *     *
Sherlock toys with the ring. The meaning of the symbol embossing the stone still eluded him, but he had yet to exhaust either the public library or the internet in search of it.
He could wait.
Bigger things to deal with, and all.
"Yes." John answers without hesitating.
“‘Might not’?”
Oh, god, this concussion must be bad. He had to focus.
“No,” Sherlock answers, eyes scanning the crowd, “but I wasn’t inconspicuous either. Short of shouting our hotel’s address and waving a banner with my name on it, I should have been noticed.”
"And what now?"
“Georgiy?” He calls softly to the man, who sits behind him on the cart on a small cushioned pillion seat.
“Forget what?”
“An apartment near Hampstead.”
“I’ve always fancied Edinburgh. Haven’t been since the Jacobite uprising. Do you remember, John? You were in Hajnice at the time. You did so admire Frederick the Great…of course, he admired you too, he benefited quite a lot from your knowledge of Pultowa, didn’t he?”
“Is that what you think happened?”
"It feels real," John sobs, his voice cracking as water laps over his face. "It feels real."
The weight inside him lifted, coil loosening. Carefully, he reached down and grasped John’s gloved hands in his, bare against soft leather, and John let him.
"Please use what meagre intellect you have and save me the trouble of correcting you because, really, it does get quite tedious. She was a
In the span of a moment, Sherlock Holmes knew what it was to be destroyed by love, engulfed so fully in that helpless expanse of open water, in the loneliness of the feeling, and he managed to spot the shore in the distance.
"Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
), the way he looked at corpses, when he was trying to map their cold blue bodies for how they died; when he was looking for an explanation, a reason for what he saw before him.
John had no choice now but to wait to fall back into the grave with him.
"Help me get this off, would you?" John groaned, nudging at his bullet-proof vest. "It's stifling underneath."
—and John isn't moving and the wolf that attacked him is coming back.
“You’re right.” Sherlock murmurs, before flicking his spent cigarette out the window, the burning ember disappearing into the dark. “His eyes were much bluer.”
Her eyes closed at the familiar voice, deep and low, and spun around in her chair.
The hospital hallway had been empty. Mycroft had probably seen to it to ensure John a peaceful sleep. His way of apology. Sherlock was nearly too angry with him to take a step further once he saw him at the other end of the hall. His hands had trembled with a cold rage that he rarely let himself feel simply because it was so potent, so heavy, so angry that he feared for those around him when it reared its head.
“I was being punished,” he says finally.
“You never let a case go unsolved.” John says plainly, keeping his gaze on the horizon.
I stare at the kitchen wall. John comes in at one point, with his old pyjamas and his wild hair and his wild cold feelings, and I watch him make tea without a word. He doesn’t offer me any, but I know John filled the kettle full enough for two cups, just in case, or perhaps out of habit.
"You have been threatened with love before, and you ran away because you were afraid. But I know that you are not a coward and that your tail would never be caught between your legs, so you ran for someone else. For who?"
Dante Alighieri, The Inferno, Canto V
"Then I graduated to wondering what the head of my cock would look like pressed into it and that's when I realised I loved you. It makes so much sense now, that I'd equate sexual desire with love since I didn't know how to differentiate the two, never have experiencing either. But then love gradually eclipsed any sexual desire I had for you. I wanted to kiss you but not fuck you. I wanted to push you against the fridge and taste you but not go any farther. Maybe I was afraid. I don't know. Those months were an emotional blur to be honest. Then at St. Bart's, when I knew I was leaving you, I wanted to tell you everything, but I didn't have the time and much of what I wanted to say was far too inappropriate for my last words to you. Can you imagine if the last thing I'd said to you was 'John, you don't know how long I've wanted you to fuck me'? It would have hurt you too much if I'd told you then that I love you. I wanted you to move on, not stay up at night regretting the missed opportunities that you didn't tell me you love me too."
“No, John, no, I would nev—” Sherlock stops, unable to correctly phrase what his mind is yelling at him. “You saw what Mycroft had on the netbook in Stockholm.”
Where had he gone wrong?
Blood coarses through their veins, pooling in their wild limbs and sparking against deep bone. The feeling is unparalleled. There is nothing quite like it, nothing quite like banging your shin against a skip as you barrel out of a filthy alley, nothing
John offers his hand, wholly human and warm, and Sherlock takes it.
“Good.” He took his hand away and the redness lessened, pulsing beneath the waves. “He said war was coming here. Does that seem like an accurate assessment to you?”
