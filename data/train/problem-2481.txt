Dean stopped and turned around. He hadn’t realized it until Cas offered, but he was very thirsty, and his mouth still tasted like puke. Cas held the water jug out to him and he chugged a good amount before handing it back and continuing out to the street. The air was magnetic, pulling him toward his destination, and Cas kept pace beside him. As they walked the three blocks to the woods’ edge, past identical tract homes with postage stamp front yards, he saw the colors of everything following him, like he was pulling streaks of green and yellow, blue and gray, with him, but he knew it was because of the peyote, and it didn’t scare him.
Cas released him and pulled Dean’s shoes, boots and pants off for him before crawling back into Dean’s lap so they could kiss languidly and touch each other all over.
“How ya feelin’?” Ash asked, peering over the rim of his coffee cup at the bike with his perpetually glazed stoner eyes.
So there he was on a Wednesday afternoon fucking his wife’s best friend doggy style and thinking about nothing else when his “Communication Breakdown” ringtone blasted from the livingroom. “Shit,” he grunted, pulling out abruptly. Amara gave a grunt of her own and huffed, “Goddamit, Dean, what the fuck?” as he ran naked down the hall to grab his phone. He answered and barked out his name to the automated voice on the other end. Only one more week of house arrest and then Dean could get the ankle bracelet off and stop answering these damn monitoring phone calls at random times.
“So you’re happy?” Cas asked Carmen, moving slightly toward her as if moving in for a hug, but then holding himself back.
“Uhh,” he said, his voice hoarse. The doctor waited while Hannah fed a straw into his mouth. The water tasted like no water Dean had ever had before. Cool and sweet like it had come from a remote mountain spring, which seemed unlikely. Once he’d had his fill, he said, “Dean Winchester,” wincing in the too-bright room. Carmen still didn’t speak, but let out a relieved breath.
Dean scoffed. “You know, I find it very hard to believe that you and Carmen are related,” he said, thinking of his pragmatic wife, always worried he was spending too much money on Baby and weed, always anxious to get their next paychecks.
Cas finally spoke up and said, “Are you a couple?” Thank god for Cas’s bluntness and willingness to say what Dean was thinking.
It took a moment for Sam’s words to compute. “What? How could you be a lawyer already?” Dean asked. He knew Sam graduated from undergrad early because a big-wig professor gave him some kind of internship that usually only went to grad students, but Sam was only twenty-three now. His little brother was a genius, even got some hugely prestigious award Stanford Law gave to hardly anyone that paid for law school, but Dean thought it would be at least another year until he was an actual lawyer.
“Fuck yeah, he is,” Dean agreed. “Can you believe the dude never even went to school? Looked like you and him were doing some super-genius bonding.”
“Oh, am I, little bro?” Carmen said with increasing venom. “Do you think that I haven’t noticed you making googly eyes at him? I think you have to move on, Castiel.”
Dean pulled his hands out saying, “Ok, easy there, easy.” He didn’t want to start anything with their spouses right in the house. Not to mention Cas might be lurking around somewhere. Plus, he just wasn't feeling Amara lately.
Dean stared her down for a while, making her squirm. She continued to take items in and out of her purse. “You’re a fucking liar,” he said, his voice feeling cold and hard in his throat.
Cas’s frown deepened, the first spark of anger Dean had seen from him. “Yes, although I should say cult leader,” he said with scorn.
“Yes you do. Dean…” she insisted just as the front door opened and Cas came in, causing her to let go and back up.
With that Dean pulled Cas back over to their shopping cart and resumed pushing it toward the produce area where he could see Carmen and Amara with their own cart looking into the dairy case. As Carmen turned around gripping a gallon of milk, she froze at the sight of the two of them. Amara turned and did the same, and he could feel Cas’s tension beside him.
“I’m ready,” Dean told Cas one winter night when they could hear the wind howling outside while they were warm and entwined under their comforter. They had spent a long time on foreplay, licking and sucking and stroking every available surface on one another’s bodies. Cas circled his fingers over Dean’s lube-slicked asshole, round and round, telling Dean how beautiful, how precious he was. “I’m gonna take care of you, my beloved,” he said, pressing two fingers in. “Just like you take care of me.”
In the past Dean would have brushed off Sam’s words with something like, “No chick flick moments, bitch,” but instead Dean surprised Sam with another bear hug and said, Thanks, Sammy. Thanks for everything.”
Of course Cas was there when they got home after dropping Amara off at the salon. Cas with his stupid big blue eyes and his stupid mop of hair and his stupid five o’clock shadow and his stupid forearms and his stupid hip bones that were visible when his stupid “Save the Bees” t-shirt rode up when he reached for something in a high kitchen cabinet. He was sitting at the table reading a book--something with “Mind” in the title.
“It’s just nice to see you enjoying food again that isn’t round or raw,” Cas answered. “And you sound like you’re having sex.”
He could hear Cas’s alarm, but it sounded far away and Dean couldn’t see anything through the white fog surrounding him. Then he breathed and breathed again, gulping air until he could see and hear again, and his breath slowed.
The sky was darkening, but Cas was too bright to look at. Dean curled tighter and let himself be rocked and rocked.
Dean tried to speak, but found himself choked up. As if sensing it, Cas raised himself up, searching Dean’s eyes. “Are you ok, love?” he asked, running both hands through Dean’s sweat-soaked hair.
The doctor hummed and then said distractedly, “Head trauma can cause changes in appetite. You’ve got to start eating Dean, ok? Then you’ll probably be fine.”
“You’re going to have to move the fuck out of here,” Dean said, lighting up a cigarette and pointing at Cas.
“No,” he said, feeling as if he were in a dream. Cas removed the lit cigarette from his fingers, and Dean let him. “No, thanks, he added,” and with that, he fell asleep.
Amara kept texting him, wanting to hook up, but Cas’s unpredictable presence at the house made that hard. Dean supposed he could go to her place, but something about fucking in Benny’s bed turned his stomach. Plus, if he was honest with himself, he didn’t miss fucking her. He never even thought of her unless she was pestering him via text.
“Let’s just go,” Amara said, starting to pull at his arms, but Dean didn’t want to get up. His body was already sinking, sinking into the couch.
“Because she’s my employer. I can’t do that,” she answered in a bored voice since she’d said it at least three times already.
“That’s a dumb question,” he muttered. The pills and alcohol were starting to quench the ball of flame in his chest and replace it with numbness.
“Fine people don’t eat raw beets like they’re apples,” Carmen insisted, some of the anger returning to her voice.
Afterwards, he’d practically shoved her out the door. She was all huffy, but relented when he hissed, “The kid could be back any second. I don’t know where the fuck he is.”
The word “awakening” hit Dean in the sternum. Yes, that’s what it felt like, like he was waking up after the long sleep of his life. He’d been drifting along on top of every experience, eyes closed, and now he wanted to dive deep and feel, open his eyes and let the dirty water run across them.
“Dean!” Carmen yelled, diving for the phone, but Dean already ended the call, laughing. “They record those!”
“You think I’m stupid, don’t you?” Dean challenged. He was used to people underestimating him, the gear-head high school dropout. Part of him did feel stupid sometimes. He didn’t know about high culture or anything like that, but he’d read some books. He could build a car from the frame up, and he mostly taught himself how to do that. And he and Carmen figured out, all on their own, how to buy this house. He’d passed the fucking GED with flying colors without even studying. He knew he was no dummy.
Crowley stared at him, his eyes roving around Dean’s face as if bracing himself for more. When Dean remained silent, he said. “I can have Meg mail your last check to you.”
“Thank you,” Dean said, letting his tears fall and placing his own hand on Cas’s stubbled cheek. “That was… thank you.”
“Huh?” he said over the rumble of the engine and pulled one of the stethoscope plugs out of his ear.
His next idea was to go to the bank for a loan. He figured he’d put Baby up as collateral in order to get her back.
“Huh,” Sam said, sounding like maybe he was rethinking his whole reality. “Carmen must be pretty pissed at you sleeping with her brother,” he mused as if thinking aloud. “She must be pissed at him too. I mean, I don’t want to judge, Dean, but that situation sounds kind of fucked up.”
He was looking up on his phone how to file for unemployment when someone knocked on the door. He wasn’t surprised to find Carmen on the other side in cut-off shorts and a Jayhawks t-shirt, her big quilted bag, looking empty, slung over her shoulder. She was pretty as ever, even when pissed off. She slapped his face hard enough to cause him to stumble against the doorframe. After righting himself, Dean raised a hand to his cheek and looked up at Carmen’s scowl. “Amara told me everything,” she said.
Dean thought back to before the accident. He remembered asking Amara for money and being angry that she refused, but that seemed so long ago now, and as if he hadn’t been involved. “Yeah,” he said, and took another sip of water.
“A single event can awaken within us a stranger totally unknown to us. To live is to be slowly born.”
Dean wasn’t sure what to say to that except, “uh, yeah.” The way Amara continued to hold Carmen close to her seemed more than just friendly.
“Well, why were you there then?” Dean said, shaking the image of Cas’ arms out of his head. “You just didn’t want to pay rent?”
Carmen looked up, her smile fading too. “Dean, that’s sandwich meat,” she said, annoyed. She was always so particular about what foods were for what purpose.
“Yeah, yeah, that’d be great,” he said, already envisioning a lush garden. “Do you like working there?” he asked.
“What, like a cult?” Dean asked with growing trepidation about this half-brother-in-law he’d never met.
“Huh?” Dean looked out the window to see they were at Crowley’s. It looked different somehow, as if it were underwater.
“I’m sorry,” his father said, voice broken and so real. He embraced Dean as he rarely had in life. “I’m so, so sorry.”
After some quiet snuggling, Dean suggested, “Maybe it would be good for you to talk to a counselor or something like I’ve been doing.” Since he had to do it, Dean decided to make the best of his court-mandated counseling, and he’d come to like his counselor, Mia. Unloading all of the crap in his life from his mom’s death to his failed marriage onto a person who had no emotional investment in any of it was freeing, another step in this strange journey he’d been on since that fateful day he’d cracked his head on the pavement. He even enjoyed the AA meetings he also had to go to, although he didn’t think he was an alcoholic. He could tell no one at the meetings believed him when he said as much, but he didn’t mind. Hearing all of their stories of struggle and redemption was inspiring.
Dean barked out a laugh. “I guess I’m over that round stuff now,” Dean said, leaning back in his chair and patting his stomach, which had become a lot more concave since the accident. He wouldn’t be surprised if he’d lost ten pounds or more. Although he hadn’t been remotely fat before, his new wiry form felt right. He’d shed his old self and was ready to rebuild.
Dean rode the bike through the garage entrance past Crowley who was talking to a new silver-haired guy in a suit. They both eyed him as if he were a stray dog as he dismounted.
Although in the wake of the accident Dean had felt like he was done with cars, like they just didn’t matter, he wasn’t so sure now. He could still appreciate a well-made, finely-tuned machine. The Impala represented his dad, and because of that, Dean was torn between wanting to keep it or move beyond it.
“It’s ok Dean,” Cas answered for her. He seemed unperturbed by being thrown out. “I have a tent. It’s a clear night. I’ll find a spot.”
“He is unusual, Sammy,” Dean said, not sure what Sam was getting at. To Dean, Cas was unusual in all the best ways. “He’s had an unusual life.”
Amara straightened her clothes, grabbed her purse from the coffee table, and hissed, “If Dean dies, it’s your fault,” before stomping out the front door.
Back inside, he found Carmen in the bathroom. She wrapped his head back up with efficiency, examined the scrapes on his hands, leaving them unwrapped, and then got ready for their guests as Dean studied himself in the mirror. He hadn’t shaved since before the accident and he had a scruffy beard going. He couldn’t seem to widen his eyes more than a squint. His cheeks were a bit hollowed. Who was this person in the mirror?
Sam got his voice back and continued to explain that he lived with his girlfriend, Jessica, who was pre-med, and two other people who worked at the legal aid clinic since rent was so high in the Bay Area. In the past, hearing all about Sam’s accomplished, busy life would have filled Dean with resentment and jealousy. He wouldn’t have admitted that to himself, instead just being pissed at what he saw as Sam abandoning him and Dad right when Dad was at his worst. But now he could see it for what it was--bitterness that he had sacrificed his own childhood to make sure Sam could realize his potential. He could envision the whole scenario through Sam’s eyes now. Of course Sam should have jumped at the chance to go to Stanford and pursue his dreams. Of course he should have wanted to get away from their dad, and although Sam would never admit it, of course he should have wanted to get away from the big brother who seemed to be following in their father’s footsteps, getting stuck in the dead end of his own life. Dean had been angry at Sam for years, but the anger was just gone now, only a memory, like that of a fever after recovering from an illness.
“No,” was all Cas said, leaning over the counter, continuing to eat his bacon standing. His clothes were baggy and rumpled, he had dark stubble on his face, and he didn’t look like he’d bathed in a couple of days, his hair a mess, but somehow all of that didn’t look bad on him. His bare forearms looked stronger than Dean had noticed before, the muscles well-defined. Dean imagined himself reaching out and gripping one, but instead reached for the coffee pot Carmen had left and poured himself a cup.
Dean imagined Cas by himself in the woods at the edge of the neighborhood being gnawed on  by wild animals. Ok, maybe the most dangerous animals they had around here were coyotes, but you never knew. Coyotes and racoons could get rabies and attack people. Or sketchy people could attack Cas. You never knew. “You can’t just toss him out, Carmen.”
He endured similar jeers after he clocked out, but he had to admit to himself as he rode home, that the wind felt good on his face and the pumping of his legs brought him right back to those magical moments of childhood with little Sammy perched up on his handlebars, the two of them laughing and free for at least an hour or two. On the route home, he noticed things he never had before from the car, like the dandelions and anthills that peppered the curb and the cacophony of birds. And then out of nowhere a car backed out of a driveway, and Dean crashed right into it with a thud. He flipped over the hood, reached out his hands to break the fall, smashed his skull into the pavement, and descended into darkness.
Dean swallowed down the lump in his throat at her words, which seemed threatening despite her unchanged inflection. He wondered if she knew someone killed by a drunk driver or something, maybe someone close to her. He knew it was only luck that had kept him from hitting someone the many times he’d been wasted behind the wheel, and he absorbed her anger, took it seriously. She had no way of knowing what he knew, that it would never happen again. He wondered why she'd reduced his charge.
That was a shock to Dean. He’d always pictured Sam on top of the world in California, living out his dreams. “Why, Sammy?” he asked, gripping his little brother’s sizable shoulder. “You ok?”
So on a Thursday morning when Carmen asked, “Is it ok if Amara and Benny come over tonight?” Dean said, “Sure, why not?”
None of them mentioned that it would be a gift to Carmen or whoever she ended up selling the house to since, while Sam and Dean were busy at their meeting with Marv, Cas had found a nearby one bedroom apartment for them to rent. They were moving there in two days. Dean didn’t mind. The birdbath felt like his gift to the universe.
Just then, the back door opened and in came Cas, clearly just off his bike, red-cheeked and wind-swept. He looked super-cute, Dean thought, and then choked a bit on his beer.
Late Sunday morning after Carmen had left for her weekend shift, Dean pulled on jeans, feeling a little too self-conscious to walk around in his underwear like he used to before Cas was there, and lit up a cigarette. He walked out of the bedroom shirtless to find Cas standing at the stove frying up some bacon. “Bacon, huh?” Dean said, sidling past Cas in the narrow kitchen. It didn’t seem like something a hippy like him would eat, like Sam and his salads. “Thought you were enlightened.”
Dean found himself getting irritated. “So you just crash on people’s floors?” he asked, not bothering to blow his smoke away from Cas.
Dean and Cas lived comfortably for the next two days like an old married couple. Cas went off to the nursery, and Dean worked cleaning up the yard and building his unusual bird bath. He chiseled and sanded a number of the larger patio chunks into smooth, interlocking pieces and started to glue them together with concrete patch into a bowl about two feet in diameter. If he painted over the dull gray when it was done, he could make it look really nice.
After pounding away at the concrete for a while, surrounding himself in rubble, he became aware that Cas was watching him from the sliding back door. He stopped his swinging and smiled at Cas’s quizzical look.
Dean examined the capsules. They looked like something you’d get at the drugstore. “So you don’t think I’d flip out or anything?” he asked.
He had peed in a bottle at some point in the hospital, but didn’t need to now. Despite the throbbing in his head, he felt pleasantly hollowed out, like his body had no needs. “Nah,” he said, eyes closed. Once he was down to his underwear and under the covers, Carmen left him to sleep in the dim room, and that’s where he stayed for the next two days.
Dean ignored him and kept talking, closing his eyes again, “85 miles an hour, my eyes are closed.” He started moving his hand back and forth to the rhythm of his words: “Switching lanes...85 miles...100 miles….125 miles an hour, five, ten minutes.”
Dean wished he could wrap her in a warm hug and soothe her, but that wasn’t possible while buckled into a car. Plus, his arms felt like sandbags. The calm and warmth he felt toward Carmen felt new, not like the ordinary, obligatory affection he usually felt toward the girl he’d entered adulthood with, but something deeper he knew he would feel toward anyone who crossed his path at the moment. A love for humanity. It was like a golden buzzing deep within, but his head hurt too much to think about it beyond that.
Dean knew how you were supposed to feel when being fired, but he didn’t feel that way. He felt fine about it. “Ok,” he said.
Cas was unfazed. “Would you like something to eat?” he asked in such a sweet voice that Dean felt something loosen in his throat that he hadn’t even realized was tight.
“It’s all gonna sound kinda nuts,” Dean said, “but just bear with me.” And then Dean told Sam everything. He told him about getting the DUI and having his car taken; about getting hit by a car and getting a concussion; about how something changed in him, like a window in his brain opened up; about not eating and then only eating round things; about losing his job; about Carmen walking out; about the peyote trip and facing his demons (although he didn’t say what those were); and of course about Cas. “He’s amazing, Sam,” Dean finished. Telling it all to Sam felt like letting go in a game of tug-of-war they’d been having for years. He let out a long breath in relief.
“This is so so amazing,” shouted the woman spreading her arms in the air, “I mean the fics are neat, but if they truly become something, that would be mind-blowing.”
After a short nod from the taller man, Cas started, “well, I do want our behaviour to be considered as… “couple material”,” he finished with air quotes.
“Why did you come home so soon?” asked Sam, “Not that you had to… be out for the… whole night but, it’s just… early, and I… did something happen?” he finished his stuttering.
Dean suddenly appeared next to the angel and resumed, “What’s going on here? One of you broke something?”
Dean’s blush hadn’t faded yet, and it took him a minute before he asked, “on what kind of websites do you go exactly to read stuff like that?”
There was an actual chance that Dean returned the feeling. In the last few years, Sam had seen his brother acting in a different way depending on the people he was around, but around Castiel, and now that he thought about it, Sam must admit that it was evident how much the angel meant to his brother.
On the other hand, Sam could clearly notice the difference in the air as soon as the angel said that, and he saw Dean turning slowly to face Cas, a shocked look on his face.
They both stood still, their arms not even touching. When another thirty minutes passed, Castiel murmured, “it is obvious that the two characters will end up together.”
“I understand,” nodded Charlie, “You know there are probably other fanfic you could read where you are written with Jess.”
A soft smile started to spread on Cas’ face as the realisation hit him, his eyes filled with light and adoration.
Sam and Charlie both glanced at the two best friends repeatedly until, after thirty minutes and a short and knowing nod, they stood up, and left the room, as Charlie said, “I gotta show Sam a new video-game, good night bitches.”
“Yeah um, I just… need to…” tried Sam, his eyes going back and forth between his brother and his laptop. “I just wanna finish reading first. You know, get it over with.”
“Wait, Dean blushed, like actually blushed?” repeated the redhead, her mouth agape, “You mean, actual blood that went straight up to his cheeks because he was… flustered?”
“This part was… surprisingly fine to read. I mean… it was good to see that in a certain way she was remembered,” he said, smiling softly.
“Yes, I suppose,” replied the angel glancing at the human, his brown frown, unaware of the conflict he had just started.
Neither Sam nor Charlie dared to move, too scared to be the one who will be the victim of Dean’s anger.
Even though Charlie didn’t really live with the hunters, she still decided a long time ago that she would have her own room that no one but her was allowed to use.
Suddenly, Sam heard a noise of someone walking into the room, the hunter quickly brushed the tears off his face as his brother walked, his face filled with curiosity.
But the betrayal came quicker than he realised and what had seemed like a happy and lovely story soon turned into a story spreading pain and suffering. Okay, so… separation wasn’t easy, but if they broke up halfway through the story, they had the rest of the story to make up.
Sam got it instantly, his brother was scared to let this opportunity go and he was scared to lose Cas. He was scared that he wouldn’t have this anymore. That he wouldn’t have all the trust, the faith, the one Dean had in Castiel but the one Cas had in him as well.
Sam was interrupted by the sound of the door being slugged open by his angry brother, followed by Castiel.
He sighed as he noticed the hour – half past eleven – and headed back to his room. He stood there, observing the furniture for a few seconds, unsure of what to do or even which clothes to wear. He was certain that they wouldn’t have a new job to deal with today and he had time for himself to… rest? Watch a movie maybe, or even continue a show. He put on jogging and an old sweater as he sank back into his bed, his laptop between his hands.
After that, Sam’s eyes never left the screen, except when he skipped the explicit scene between Dean and Cas. It was something to read about a love story and to put a barrier between it and his life, but reading about his brother having sex… He couldn’t.
“Yeah sure, we’re fine,” retorted Dean as he raised his head and put on a fake smile. “So, can we move on now? I don’t know, Charlie’s here, what do you say? Movie night?”
Sam’s eyes were fixed on his brother, who was staring at the floor, still not talking. As he stepped closer, the taller man asked, “Are you… okay?”
Instantly, an image of Jessica appeared in his mind. It always did when it came to dealing with something love-related. He didn’t feel pain anymore when he thought about Jessica, or at least way less than what he used to, but he still missed her. So much. All they could have been, all he would’ve done for her. He still felt guilty. Obviously, he couldn’t help it, but he moved on. She still kept a huge place in his heart, but he didn’t feel like going out with another woman was cheating on her anymore.
Instead, the taller man took his computer cautiously  so as to not wake Dean and stood up. He left his room and headed to the war room, happy to find it empty, so he could finish reading the novel. He sat there for quite some time – he didn’t even bother checking the time – and he finally got there.
In front of him, the shock hadn’t left Charlie’s face yet, and it took her a few seconds before she moved on to another subject.
Sam blinked at the writing. He didn’t know it would be so good. He kept on reading, his burger turning cold as he forgot it, too involved in the story. Reading his brother’s name each time was way too weird at first, even more so when he knew that it was actually his brother and the feeling came back when he started reading Castiel’s name.
“Yeah, actually, he met her once only, but he said he liked her. Of course, if he had tasted the pie she made, we would’ve fought each other to keep her.”
The movie was still on when they both pulled back. They tried to watch the ending, this time cuddling – even if Dean would never admit he’d use the word – and sharing at times, lingering kisses and loving stares.
After a quick glance between Sam and Charlie, both friends nodded and the redhead stated, “okay but we’ll watch Just go with it.
“Ok,” Dean had easily agreed. The truth was, he had started to enjoy living in Lawrence now that he spent more time around the campus. Starting college had opened up his world as well as Cas’s, and he realized his town was more than the dive bars and burger joints he’d always frequented before. He’d miss it and the people he’d met there if they lived in the middle of nowhere. Self-sufficiency seemed less and less attractive to both of them.
Crowley, a look of disgust on his face, continued, “Not to mention you tried to grab my dick the other day.”
“Gonna come, baby,” Dean cried once Cas started pulling at his cock in counterpoint to his deepening thrusts. “Oh, god, so good,” he grunted as he came hard, spurting over and over onto his own chest as Cas stroked him through his orgasm. He felt like that lady always said in Cas’s yoga videos, like the light in him was celebrating the light in Cas or some shit.
Carmen ignored everything Dean had said and answered, “I’m gonna go talk to that asshole. You’ve made him more money in the years you’ve worked there than anyone else!”
“Wait, Carmen,” Dean called. “You don’t want to stay here?” He wasn’t sure where he would go if she threw him out, but he wanted to offer her whatever he could.
“Yeah,” Dean grunted from where he lay on his stomach, his cheek pressed into the sheet. He found that if he pressed the side of his face into the bed rather than the pillow, his neck was more comfortable and he could still keep the head wound from pressing into anything. He’d never been able to sleep well on his back.
Sam clammed up when Cas entered carrying two pizza boxes at the tail end of Dean’s words, undoubtedly having heard some of it. He placed the boxes on the coffee table and sat back where he’d been before on the couch. He faced Sam with an earnest expression on his face. “Are you concerned about our relationship, Sam?” he asked.
The doctor insisted he stay awake though and had him squeeze his fingers with both hands, push against his arm, and turn his head. He had him follow a pen light with his eyes and he hit his elbows with a little hammer to check his reflexes.
“Mmm,” Cas moaned against Dean’s lips, but then pulled away with a disappointed grunt. Holding Dean by the hips at arm’s length, he said, “There is nothing more that I’d rather do than make love to you, but it will have to wait.”
As he got closer, Dean smiled at Cas’s gummy grin. When he was a few feet from Dean, he said, “Your mouth is all red.”
“I don’t know,” Dean said, and then thought about it. “I guess if I was working on cars, that kept me busy, so I was really only drinking or smoking at night and on weekends. And then when I was drinking and smoking, I just didn’t think far enough about anything to stop me from getting in the car, and driving also kept me from thinking about anything, so I was never even conscious that I was doing anything wrong.” He stopped talking, trying to remember what had been going through his head the past several years, realizing that it hadn’t been much at all. “It’s kind of hard to explain,” he continued, “but it’s like I’m actually aware of my thoughts for the first time in my life lately.”
“What, seriously?” Dean said, lifting himself up on an ebow. He was not expecting that. “Isn’t that like super-trippy shit? I mean, I did acid once, but it was the worst.” He shuddered thinking about that party when he was eighteen and someone gave him a tab. He ended up reliving one of the worst memories of his life and screaming like a crazy person while Carmen and a couple of guys had to hold him down to keep him from running into traffic. They had to call an ambulance and everything. It was humiliating. Jesus, he hadn’t thought about that in a long time.
“You know she’s loaded,” Dean pressed before he was interrupted by an accented voice on the phone who asked what he was calling in reference to even though he’d already told the person who put him on hold in the first place.
“Castiel?” Dean said with incredulity as he got behind the wheel and lit up a cigarette before starting the car. “What the fuck kind of name is that?”
That night, Dean sat up against the headboard watching Carmen get ready for bed, taking off her jewelry, brushing her teeth. She was beautiful in a conventional way. Everything about her was proportional and smooth. She could probably have been a model or Hollywood actor if she wasn’t limited by her own insecurities and geography. A creepy high school teacher had said that about him once.
“No, definitely not,” Cas said with an earnestness that made Dean smile. The dude was just so damn cute, like an old man trapped in a beautiful twenty-year-old body. “Native Americans have used it for millenia to access the divine, but there have been recent studies that show its benefits for those suffering from psychological distress.”
She reemerged with a bulging bag and dropped it to the floor once she was facing Dean. “I’ve had enough,” she said after taking a deep breath and letting it out. “You sleeping with everyone and the drinking and the car and the DUIs and never having money and you never helping with anything and then you acting like you’re crazy just because you got a bump on the head and then Cas,” she listed off in a rush, her voice rising. “You are fucking him, aren’t you?”
“Alright, Dean,” the doctor said after it all, “it looks like you have a Grade 3 concussion. The good news is that you passed all the neurological checks. I’d have you stand up to check your balance, but seeing as you passed all the other checks and don’t seem to have any confusion or memory loss, I won’t make you get up right now. The fact that you remember your accident at all is a great sign, despite the vomiting. We’ll do a CT scan and get a neurological consult, though. The long period of unconsciousness concerns me, and we have to see what’s going on in your head.”
Dean wanted to go inside and defend Cas, but he felt frozen to the step. The sun was dipping below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the torn up patio and beyond.
“You know I just have a hard time relating to him, right?” he said, trying to make nice. “It’s very hard for me to trust someone who doesn’t drive.”
Cas lifted a hand to run his fingers through Dean’s hair. “I’m so sorry that happened to you,” he said.
Time passed, who knew how long, and Cas turned Dean to face him. He said, “It’s getting dark, Dean. Let me help you up and bring you home.”
She taped some plastic wrap over the bandage so Dean could wash his hair, which had become a greasy mess since the accident. She said he didn’t need the other bandage that had been wrapped around his head and the smaller bandage just over the wound was enough. She helped him shave and watched him as he put on his clothes. By the time they got into Carmen’s car, Dean was tired enough to drift off on the five minute drive to Crowley’s.
Cas reached for the lube, squeezed more out, and together they jerked Cas off. “Oh, Dean,” Cas moaned. “I want to fill you up. I’m going to fuck you now. Can I?”
Dean chuckled. “Well,” he said. “I don’t have any money, no job, and I’m gonna be a felon now, so I don’t think so.”
“That seems like a lot,” she said, uninflected, and continued to wash the dishes. The only sounds in the house for a few long minutes were the clinking of porcelain against silverware.
Dean slipped into his hooker persona from long ago. There was something liberating about doing it just to be funny. “Look I’m offering to do whatever, ok? You gotta read between the lines. I’m saying that I’ll let you fuck me, or I can fuck you. However you wanna do it...”
“Yeah, they went back to eating meat,” Cas explained, frowning. “The leader, Chuck, he’s pretty fickle.”
To his shock, Carmen broke into a smile too as she placed the jug into her cart. “I was wondering when we’d run into you,” she said, hands on her hips. Both women looked good, Amara in her usual form-fitting attire, and Carmen with a shorter, layered haircut that nicely framed her face.
Benny made another grab for the snacks and Amara slapped his hand away saying, “That’s enough, baby.”
It hadn’t registered with Dean that Cas had left, but then he was returning, holding the half-full water jug toward him. “At least drink some water,” he said, taking Dean’s hand and placing it on the jug handle.
Cas strode into the room and picked Dean’s phone up off of the end table, pressing the screen to end the noise. He leaned over Dean’s prone form. Dean squinted up into Cas’s penetrating blue eyes. “You don’t have to go into work, you know,” Cas whispered, his face inches from Dean’s. It would just take a small lift of Dean’s head to kiss him.
He turned around and slumped, seated, his back against the tv sectional, his knees up. Benny scrambled for the remote and turned the tv off. “Thank you, Benny,” Dean breathed out, relieved. The silence tasted sweet.
“Maybe you can ask your friends to pitch in, start a GoFundMe page or something,” Sam suggested. “Even if you didn’t want to keep her, you could sell her for a hell of a lot more than the cost to get her out of impound and pay your friends back.”
The edge of the woods was three blocks from the house, but when they got there, Dean felt as if he’d been on a long journey. There was no trail into the woods, but the trees were spaced widely enough that Dean could just step off the sidewalk onto the pine-needle-covered forest floor. He weaved between tall evergreens, moving deeper into the quiet of the woods. Cas trailing behind. Although he knew the trees in these woods weren’t that tall, right now they seemed to tower over him, their viridescent branches undulating in the breeze far, far away, but then all of a sudden a branch was right there, and all he had to do was reach out and touch it. The pine needles felt simultaneously rough and soft, and he spent some time running his fingers over them, releasing their intense fragrance. He sank down to the ground and lay back, surrendering himself to the beam of sunlight breaking through the foliage. The cloudless sky above receded and the branches descended toward him. He closed his eyes and felt his body sink into the earth.
“Before meeting you, I thought I would walk the earth alone for the rest of my life like the Wandering Jew,” Cas said, sounding near tears. “I never thought I would ever feel so loved.”
By the time they left the courthouse hours later, Dean had all his paperwork in, an address where to pick up his ankle bracelet, and an appointment for his first counseling session. He couldn’t have done it all without his brother.
“What?” she said, clearly still processing that Dean had been listening. Dean noticed for the first time how tired she looked and realized she had probably looked that way for a while but he hadn’t been paying attention.
“This kid is totally off the grid. Doesn’t have a phone either,” Dean continued. “Y’know, wolf boy.”
Sam seemed to consider that. “Well, even if you’re not an alcoholic,” he said, “maybe the counseling will be a good thing.”
Dean moved on autopilot through the morning, and on his lunch break, leaned against the building outside away from the others. Despite its high warehouse ceilings, the air in Crowley’s felt stifling and he needed to breathe outside for a while. In the distance, three men pushed a beat up Ford Focus down the street. Just as they were about to continue past the garage, Dean called out, “Hey, you guys, over here!” and waved them over. The guy beside the front of the car reached inside the open window to steer it in Dean’s direction as the other two pushed from behind.
Dean was standing over the kitchen sink repeatedly squeezing out a soapy sponge when they arrived later that night. Carmen had complained he never did the dishes, so he was making a show of it while she got ready in the bedroom.
Cas looked at him intently, his eyes bluer than they’d ever been. “What do you want, Dean?” he asked.
Dean felt a wave of sorrow rush through him knowing that his little brother hadn’t told him any of this before, hadn’t asked him for help. How far they had shifted since they were kids when Dean was Sam’s rock, his savior. “I’m so, so sorry I wasn’t there to help you, Sammy,” Dean said. “I’ve gotta meet this Professor Mills and give her a thank you gift.”
Despite his age, Cas was clearly experienced at this. Dean closed his eyes and saw a wash of colors behind his eyelids: blues, greens, and purples blending together. It wasn’t long before he came in Cas’s mouth, feeling as if that light that he’d been feeling in his head was radiating out through the top of his skull.
“Cool,” Dean said to himself as he sat up in the nest and stretched his arms overhead, feeling the space between each vertebra lengthen. He stood and saw he was still wearing the jeans and tshirt from the night before, but didn’t have shoes on. He stank. He was hungry.
She just shook her head and laughed in that exasperated way people did when they really felt like screaming.
“I brought you some food,” Cas said, his voice a bit louder. The rumble of it made the hairs on the back of Dean’s neck tingle. “Carmen made it before she left for work.” He stepped further into the room, still tentatively, as if he wasn’t sure he was welcome.
“I’ll be back in a little while,” she said and walked toward her car, a crappy Kia, an abomination that one of her many sisters sold her dirt cheap. Dean could barely look at the thing.
“Yeah, that’s really red, Dean,” Benny agreed, rolling his eyes a bit. Carmen just stared at him speechless for another few moments as he took another bite and chewed.
Cas shivered and pulled away from Dean. “We should sleep under the stars tonight,” he said, looking out the window toward the darkening sky.
“I sentence you to ninety days house arrest and a one-thousand five hundred dollar fine,” the Honorable Billie J. Morton, as her name plate said, intoned from the bench. The courtroom was nothing fancy, but Judge Morton, a tall Black woman talking down to him from her bench with an imperious glare, made Dean feel like he was standing before the Supreme Court. “I’m not finished,” she intoned when Sam slapped Dean on the back and opened his mouth to thank her for reducing Dean’s charge to a misdemeanor. “Stopping repeat drunk drivers is my personal mission. People like you are everything I live to set right. To tame.”
When Dean answered no, she brushed past him inside and headed toward the bedroom. Dean stood waiting in the living room, listening to her loudly moving things around, filling up her bag with her stuff, he presumed.
“Boy, you’re an enigma, aren’t you?” Dean said, taking a good draw from his cig. He didn’t know why he was messing with the kid, but then Cas didn’t seem to think he was being messed with. Cas placed the bacon on a paper-towel-covered plate and turned around, holding the plate out, silently offering some bacon to Dean. Dean took a piece and started chewing. They looked at each other for a moment. Cas looked right into Dean’s eyes like a challenge. Dean broke the eye contact and opened a cabinet, looking for a mug. “So tell me about the ashram,” he found himself saying. “Did you find Jesus there?” He chuckled.
The next morning, Dean got out of bed after Carmen had already gone to work. He was feeling a bit steadier and got dressed in some sweats, including a thick blue hoodie he hadn’t worn for a long time. The fleece lining felt so nice on his skin.
He went back to work on a sweet ‘59 Lincoln, but what usually gave him joy was now burning a hole through his chest because he couldn’t be with his own sweetheart. During his next break, he sucked up his pride and decided to try to get a loan from his employer. This worked once before when Carmen needed some dental work. Crowley was an asshole, but he valued Dean’s skills, so he advanced him the money and then took some out of his paycheck for the next six months. Surely this was more of an emergency than a root canal, right?
Dean barked out a laugh. “No, shit?” he said. Dean’s instinct was to say no, but Carmen deserved to have what she wanted in life, and she seemed to want this brother to stay with them. “So this Cas,” Dean asked, “he’s not going to cause trouble? How long would he stay?”
Sam let out a breathy laugh. “Wait, wait, I’ll get to that,” he said, “but I gotta ask you some questions first.”
Carmen’s mouth dropped open and she didn’t speak for a moment. “Excuse me?” she said, her voice low and slow.
Despite all the cum and sweat, Dean pulled Cas down and rolled them so they were in their usual bedtime position, full contact from chest to toes. They pressed their foreheads together, their breathing slowing down. No matter what happened for the rest of their lives, Dean knew he could always think back on this moment and know that he’d lived a life worth living, that he had been happy, and that he deserved to be loved.
That evening after work, Carmen asked him, “Honey, is it ok if my brother stays with us for awhile?”
He walked into the kitchen on Saturday afternoon and grabbed a packet of cold cuts out of the fridge. Over the kitchen counter he saw Carmen painting Cas’ nails at the table, the two of them smiling. He approached and stared at them for a bit, munching on a slice of baloney. Cas’ smile melted into a neutral expression.
The darkness below ground swept all the beauty of the world above away from him and he felt all the pain he’d denied himself his whole life. He saw his father’s face twisted in grief and anger and felt his blows, but then his father started to weep and Dean reached out to him to comfort and be comforted. “I love you and I hate you, Dad,” he said.
“Ok?” Cas asked, sliding his finger in further and then stroking it in and out, pressing down just right on each stroke out, sending Dean into spasms of pleasure. Dean could only grunt and pant in reply. Cas licked and kissed at the back of Dean’s neck and then took an earlobe in his mouth as he added a second finger. Between the stroke of Cas’s fingers and the sucking on his ear, Dean turned into a quivering mass of sensation. He didn’t even want to touch his dick, afraid one touch would end it all.
Things were confusing after that. He was in a car, then he wasn’t. He was awake, but couldn’t walk. Two people--Lee? Ash?--had his arms draped over their shoulders. He was on his living room couch with Carmen’s and Amara’s concerned faces peering down at him.
One thing that hadn’t changed since the day before was Dean’s attraction to Cas. He wanted to hug the adorable dude, but knew a shower had to come first. “Burritos sound awesome,” he answered, and as if it heard him, his stomach growled, making them both smile. “Let me just grab a shower.”
“Carmen, back when we met, we saved each other, right?” he asked. “But I don’t think we’ve been good for each other for awhile, y’know?”
“She just wouldn’t stop,” Carmen said to Benny, “and I was in the middle of this crisis with Dean, and I guess I got upset and yelled at her. And then I threw her out, and then today, she wouldn’t even look at me.”
“Heh, yeah, well it’s been awhile,” he said with a self-conscious dip of his head. He looked up and down Dean’s body before adding, “You look like a fuckin’ scarecrow. We’re gonna do some eating while I’m here.”
Dean closed his eyes for a little while. The others murmured to each other, and when Dean opened his eyes, Benny and Amara were standing up, looking at Dean, who still sat on the floor, as if he were a zoo animal.
Cas gave him a look of understanding and gestured toward the kitchen. “Are you hungry? I was making bean burritos if you want one.” He stopped and tilted his head. “Or would you like all of the round foods again?”
“Uh, yeah, Dean,” Sam stuttered. “I uh, just, the last time we talked, you were pretty pissed off, and you wouldn’t answer my calls for like a year, so, y’know…”
Cas talking about “millenia” and “recent studies” made Dean want to kiss all the smooth skin he could access, so they didn’t talk for a while as Dean mapped Cas’s body with his mouth. Even a twenty-year-old couldn’t get past half-mast so recently after coming twice in one night, so he returned to kissing Cas’s plush lips again.
“How old is he, and why does he need a place to stay?” Dean was suspicious of everyone in Carmen’s family. She had one older brother who was in prison for murder and one sister who was in prison for embezzelment. He knew of several more of her family members who were hardcore druggies and a couple of them had tried to get money from them before. He’d had to give a beat down to one sister’s boyfriend when he wouldn’t take no for an answer. Another thing he and Carmen had in common is that they agreed they didn’t want kids. They’d seen first hand all the ways parents could screw them up. That was also how Carmen and Amara had become friends. They’d met at a barbeque and bonded over their decision not to have kids, something that made them freaks in the eyes of their other Kansas girlfriends, and Amara had given her a job as her receptionist.
Castiel smacked the thick catalogue down on the counter next to the cutting board and leafed through it. “I know I’ve said before that the university is part of the establishment, but some of these courses sound fascinating,” he said. “Did you know that they have a class called ‘Insects of Your World,’ and something called ‘Insect Systematics’? I could take a class called ‘Ancient Magic and Witches,’ and look,” he said, pointing at a page he’d settled on, his excitement growing, “there’s a class about the Dead Sea Scrolls. I’ve always been fascinated by them. The Environmental Sciences department seems particularly interesting.”
“They’re a better source of protein than meat because they also contain fiber but no cholesterol,” Cas explained. “Of course in the long term you’re going to need to eat more variety of foods to get all of the amino acids and other nutrients, but some people live quite well on a raw vegan diet. They usually eat a broad range of vegetables and fruit, as well as nuts, seeds and sprouted grains though, not just round things.”
Dean laughed, although he wasn’t sure if Sam was joking or not. “Hey Sam,” he said, thinking about how to explain, “a lot’s happened recently, and I guess I am kinda different.”
The girls were nowhere to be seen as Benny and Dean continued their nonsensical conversation. That’s why Dean liked weed so much. Everything seemed either profound or hilarious when you were baked, and you didn’t have to think about anything in your actual life.
“That’s what I thought you said.” To Carmen, Dean repeated with a smirk, “We’ve been classified as slow payers. Isn’t that great?” Into the phone he said, “I thought you guys were really into that sort of thing.”
Benny continued to shake his head. He gave Dean a long look and said, “Ok,” as if it wasn’t ok at all. “Later,” he said bruskly as he opened the car door. He was still shaking his head a bit as he got behind the wheel.
“Love you so much, baby,” Dean panted, pushing himself further onto Cas’s hand, his head thrown back in pleasure. “I’m ready, I’m ready, please!” he cried as Cas stroked him inside over and over. Dean was so close to coming already, but wanted Cas’s dick inside him before that happened. He reached for Cas’s erection where it rubbed against his thigh and gripped it tight.
“I was trying not to wake you,” she whispered. Despite the coke from the night before, she seemed in better shape than he was.
“I knew you could build shit, but I didn’t know you were so creative, Dean,” Sam marveled, as the three of them sat before the birdbath in the dilapidated lawn chairs eating three-bean chili that Cas had made. “That thing’s a work of art. You could make more and sell ‘em.”
In his bedroom he felt unaccountably out of breath and flustered. He didn’t know why the kid unnerved him so much. Sure, Cas was hot, but he was a weirdo, a weirdo who seemed to be able to detect something in Dean that he didn’t know about himself. Or maybe Dean was just projecting that onto Cas and Cas meant nothing by it. He couldn’t figure out what that conversation was even about, but it left him thinking uncomfortably about who he was. He put on an AC/DC shirt and retreated to his sanctuary, the garage.
“Cas, I don’t know what’s happening to me. I’m calmer than I’ve ever been, but there’s stuff just like bubbling up in me lately,” he said into Cas’s neck. He described what his life had been like, how his mom died in a house fire that might have been his dad’s fault, how he carried baby Sammy out when he was still practically a baby himself, how he still dreamt about it. How he spent his whole childhood taking care of Sammy. How their dad was a crazy drunk and dragged them all over the place because he couldn’t hold on to a job and keep out of trouble. How he was always the new kid at school and couldn’t make friends. How the adults always thought he was trouble even before he did anything, and then he did shit just out of spite. He said things into Cas’s neck that he’d never said out loud before. “Dad hit me sometimes. A lot. And then he wasn’t there a lot.” Dean stopped sometimes to take some deep breaths of Cas’s clean scent, but the words continued to come out, soft and steady. “Sometimes there was no food, and sometimes Sammy’s shoes had holes, and I had to do shit. Sometimes I stole. Sometimes I turned tricks. And sometimes it got friggin’ bad, like real friggin’ bad.”
Later that night after they’d all gone to bed, Dean tried to keep quiet for Sam’s sake as Cas rode him, squeezing his cock with his internal muscles on each up-stroke.
Without the offensive smell disturbing him, he drifted off again. Some time later he woke up and  felt like getting out of bed for the first time. Carmen had given him a pill that morning, and the pain in his head was down to a dull ache. He eased himself up and took stock of his body. He felt sort of floaty, but not too bad. As he rose and made his way out of the bedroom, it was like he was drifting through a portal into a new world.
Cas had suggested walking down the road and hanging out in the woods for Dean’s trip, but Dean thought it was a bad idea. He’d never been a boy scout or anything, and the woods always seemed creepy to him. They decided instead to hang out in the backyard since it was another warm, sunny day, and they could always take a walk later if Dean felt like it.
After they were done eating, they set up kind of a nest in the backyard. Dean’s sledgehammering had revealed ground that was all loose dirt and rocks, so Dean got a tarp from the garage and they laid that down first, then Cas’s camping pad and Dean’s exercise mat from the weight room, then every blanket and pillow in the house and Cas’s sleeping bag. It was a clear and balmy night, and while the lights and noise on the wrong side of the tracks in suburbia didn’t exactly lend themselves to peaceful star-gazing, they could see the big dipper, and Cas pointed out the little dipper, which Dean hadn’t even known about.
When he opened his eyes, Cas was just staring at him, bemused. Dean felt defensive. “You don’t believe me, do you?” he said, even though he was, in fact, lying and had never changed lanes or gone 125 with his eyes closed.
“I’m actually not too upset about it,” Dean assured her. He’d been thinking about what he could do now that he wouldn’t be going to work. “I think this may be a good opportunity to break up the concrete in the backyard. We could do something better with it. We could grow some vegetables, and I could make a bird bath or something with the broken pieces.” Dean could see it all in his mind. “Doesn’t that sound like a good idea?”
Dean guided Cas’s cock toward his ass. “Do it, baby, do it, “ he chanted. “I’m here, I’m right here. Want it,” he whispered, almost to himself.
“I want to go to the woods,” Dean said. Yes, he’d always thought the woods were creepy, but now he was fearless. He wanted to be closer to the dirt. And the trees. He wanted more trees. He started walking toward the front of the house and Cas scampered after him.
Dean felt sort of strange and floaty, like he was two people, one on the ground in his body in Cas’s arms, and one floating above in the night air watching them. “Sorry man,” he said, some tears dampening Cas’s skin. “I don’t know why people do such shitty things in such an amazing world.” He pulled away and pointed at the stars. “I mean look at that shit,” he cried.
Crowley's face went from a look of disbelief to a scowl, and he stalked out of the locker room without another word.
“If you want, I can bring some of the extra plants from work for you to plant in the yard,” Cas said as Dean crouched down to resume piling up the concrete chunks. He thought of how he could break them down further and maybe create a bird bath.
Dean Winchester had mastered living on the surface. He kept his mind on the tangible shit--cars and women, beer and bong hits. He was almost finished with house arrest for a DUI, he still had his loyal wife, Carmen, his job, and his house, so what more was there to think about? Somewhere between watching his mom burn up with their house when he was four years old and his dad beating the crap out of him after catching him jerking off to his Indiana Jones poster when he was thirteen, Dean learned not to think or feel too much, to party hard, and to laugh in the face of all the crappy shit in life. Before his little brother Sam had left for Stanford six years ago, he’d asked Dean with that pained, whiny voice he got sometimes, “Are you really going to go through life never dealing with your feelings about anything?” and Dean in his boozy haze had answered, “Yup.”
Dean hadn’t realized he was thirsty until he saw and heard the ice cubes clinking in the outstretched glass. He dropped the sledgehammer and approached Cas, becoming aware of how sweaty and filthy he was. Cas unabashedly looked him up and down as he took the glass, their fingers brushing together. Dean took a long drink as Cas watched. “I think I am hungry,” Dean said with surprise.
Dean could barely speak through his pleasure, but he needed to keep hearing Cas’s voice and his own. “I’m here, angel. So good, baby. Go harder, harder.” He gripped at Cas’s ass cheeks pulling him in deeper, his eyes locked on Cas’s. “Don’t stop looking at me,” he demanded.
“Don’t feel like this is charity,” Crowley continued. “You need a way to get to work. It’s not good for our image for customers to see you riding a bicycle or getting dropped off by your wife like a child.” His face pinched with distaste when saying the word bicycle as if he were saying “shit.” “I could take a little bit out of your paycheck each month. How does that sound?” He smiled at Dean expectantly.
“Who’s that?” asked Amara, understandably alarmed that a strange young man suddenly entered the house.
Cas ran a hand up and down Dean’s arm. “Well, I don’t know what the conditions were when you did that, but there’s a protocol to follow,” he said. “You’re supposed to be in a comfortable, non-threatening environment without overstimulation, and you should be with a sober person who can sit with you.”
A couple of days passed, and Dean tried to get a read on Cas, as he now called him. The dude didn’t speak unless spoken to, and spent a lot of his time reading in the backyard, or doing what looked like meditating, sitting cross-legged on the couch with his eyes closed. It was possible he’d been looking for a job when Dean was at work, but who knew? Carmen sometimes had quiet conversations with him that Dean didn’t ask about. He didn’t want to act like he cared, but the truth was he felt kind of left out. He couldn’t tell if it was because Carmen was spending too much time with Cas, or Cas was spending too much time with Carmen, but he didn’t examine it too closely.
“For what?” Dean asked, gesturing with his cigarette, his voice rising. “Sounds like you had no responsibilities, and you still don’t. You can run around, sleep in your tent, come back here and wash your underwear. You’re as free as they come.”
“I still want you to build our house and I still want to grow all our food, but maybe we don’t have to do it off of the grid,” Cas said one day after coming home from his environmental studies class. “Maybe instead we could work on improving the grid.”
Carmen got out of the car to greet her half-brother while Dean sized the guy up through the window. Now up close Dean could see he was a couple inches taller than Carmen, had her dark hair, and wore a loose hoodie and cargo shorts that hung low on his slim hips. Basically he looked like a teenaged stoner. And the bike just solidified that assessment--a purple cruiser (purple!) which looked like it had seen better days. Dean groaned, feeling completely sobered up as he got out of the car.
Dean did as told, chugging a good amount. He could feel it’s coolness travel down his throat and hydrate every corner of his body. He realized he had to piss and stood up to walk to the corner of the walled-in yard where he sometimes, much to Carmen's displeasure, relieved himself when he was too drunk and lazy to go inside and use the toilet. The powerful stream shimmered in the moonlight and Dean started to giggle, marveling at how pee could be so magical.
“I think,” Dean started, then stopped. “I think that’s what fucked me up the most. I mean, a lot of shit fucked me up, but being that out of control and treated like a piece of trash, that shut me down for good.”
“Dean looks tired, Carmen. He should return to bed,” Cas explained with an authority Dean hadn’t heard from him before. Dean took Cas’s hand and let him hoist him up off the floor. Cas was stronger than he looked and his hand felt right interlocked with Dean’s.
Dean allowed Cas to haul him up and lead him out of the woods, an arm held around his shoulders. His face was a balloon, light and swollen, as if it were trying to float away from him. The sky was endless indigo and filled with stars he’d never noticed before. Their beams streaked down to Earth, and Dean reached out to catch them as Cas shuffled him down the sidewalk toward the house. A few cars passed them, their dark, shiny bodies leaving shadows and echoes in their wake.
There was another pregnant silence. “Wow,” Sam said again. “You weren’t kidding about a lot happening. I...I don’t know what to say, Dean.”
Dean slept in the next morning and woke up feeling alive and ready for anything. After getting dressed in his comfiest jeans and a t-shirt, and eating another beet for breakfast, he found his sledgehammer in the garage and surveyed the back patio. He decided to start in the middle and work his way out. Hoisting the hammer over his head and bringing it down woke up muscles he hadn’t used in a long time, and the smashing of concrete was incredibly satisfying.
“He may not have the words for it,” Cas powered on, “but if you look at him out there, he’s laughing and he’s happy.” There was another long silence. “I can give you something to read,” Cas added.
“What the fuck, Cas?” Dean said, alarmed at the uncharacteristic move. He tried to pry Cas’s fingers out of their bruising grip.
“I dunno,” Dean said. College had always seemed like Sam’s thing. No one ever expected Dean to go, and so he didn’t expect that either. “I mean, I got my GED easy,” he continued, “but I always wanted to work on cars, and you don’t need college for that. I’m not sure what I want now though.” He hadn’t thought about working on a car since Crowley had fired him, and now that he thought of it, no one would hire him if he didn’t even have a car to get anywhere. The Impala had been his entrance into the job at Crowley’s in the first place.
They relaxed for a while, maybe a half hour, and Dean started to drift off in the nest when he realized something was happening. The warm breeze across his face felt like the softest silk. He opened his eyes to see that the sky and leaves on the trees had become more vibrant than he remembered, like he was inside some kind of painting. The gongs in the music were vibrating inside him and he could feel the heat from Cas’s skin entering his own body. He turned to see Cas lying beside him with his eyes closed and decided to close his as well. He entered what seemed like a waking dream. He was surrounded by an ocean of color, every shade in the universe flowing and blending together in waves. He descended on an invisible escalator. Down and down. The colors surrounding him became richer and darker. Downward in the distance he could see black, and the colors darkened more as he drew near. Just as he saw his own body falling into a pure void, Dean sat up, eyes wide, with a gasp. It was still daylight, and he was startled by the rich colors surrounding him.
Lee looked at him for a few moments, frowning, then seemed to think about it and broke into a wide smile. “You’re the best!” he shouted and lifted Dean off the floor in a bear hug.
Before he could continue, Dean interrupted, saying, “No she didn’t. What do you know?” Dean thought of the pretty, brown-eyed girl he first met in the back of the school during lunch when he went out for a smoke. He had just moved to town after their dad lost yet another job and moved them back to Kansas. Dean was so fucking pissed off at everything, particularly about having to start at a new school in eleventh grade. He was so close to dropping out, and eventually did before the year ended. He also thought about ditching his dad every day and going out to Hollywood or somewhere else, but he couldn’t leave Sammy alone with their dad, and the truth was, he couldn’t leave their dad either. First of all, Baby technically belonged to the old man, even though Dean mostly drove her, but also Dad depended on Dean, and Dean shuddered to think how much further he’d crawl into the bottle if one or both of his kids left him. And in the midst of all of the crap in his own life, Dean saw this gorgeous chick who looked even more pathetic than him. She had a faint shiner under one eye and was crying softly. He asked her if she was ok, shared his smoke, and the rest was history.
“You didn’t ask,” he said. When Dean gave him an annoyed look, Cas screwed up his face like it was hard for him to figure out how to explain. He finally continued, “As I told you before, I left the ashram because I came to realize it was a cult. I didn’t like being under Chuck’s control.” He paused and turned to face Dean. “But I did enjoy some of it,” he admitted, his eyes pleading with Dean to understand, “and as you pointed out, I did learn a lot.”
“That’s awesome, Sammy. You’re amazing!” Dean said. Sam paused for a good thirty seconds, and Dean realized he probably didn’t know what to say in response to Dean’s praise. Was he just surprised, or maybe even choked up?
The next morning, after Dean ate another breakfast of round stuff and Cas ate a bowl of Wheaties, Cas showed Dean two white capsules in his palm.
The smooth and spicy beans and cheese, the soft tortilla, and the tangy salsa seemed to light up his mouth. He took his time chewing, tasting, and swallowing, and made a few appreciative sighs and groans. After finishing his last bite, he looked up to see that Cas was watching him, eyebrows raised.
“You know you have no idea what broke is,” he continued. He remembered the bare cupboards of his childhood and realizing he had to do something drastic or Sammy would starve or get taken by CPS. He felt tears prick at the back of his eyes, but pulled them back in and turned that queasy sadness into cold anger.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean panted. He’d had a few dicks up his ass, but always when wasted, so out of it he might not have even remembered doing it except for the ache in his ass the next morning. He wanted Cas to fuck him more than anything now though. “Just,” Dean grunted, an image of himself on all fours in a filthy alley flashing in his mind, making him hesitate for a second, before licking and biting at the pale column of Cas’s neck. “Yeah,” he repeated after coming up for air.
The darkness of the underworld swirled around Dean and he was taken back into a time he’d banished from his mind long ago, a time when he was fifteen and offered a handjob for twenty bucks to a guy in an alley behind a bar, something he did sometimes when they had nothing to eat and Sam was growing out of his shoes again, but instead he ended up with a knife at his throat. He saw those two men, their eyes black, their laughter demonic. The one forced himself into Dean’s mouth, the other into his ass, threatening to slit his throat if he made a sound or struggled. They left him there like trash, but Dean pulled up his pants, somehow made it home, and slipped into the shower while Sammy slept, none the wiser. As he watched soapy blood and cum swirl down the drain, his consciousness of the rape went with it.
She lunged toward him with the intent to slap him again, but he caught her wrist and did his best to not hurt her as he brought her arm down to her side and held her at arm’s length.
Amara also looked unnerved. “I’ll call you later, Carmen,” she said as she hustled Benny toward the front door.
Both women chuckled and Carmen lowered her gaze shyly to where Amara clasped her waist. “Well, Benny’s part of the package too,” Amara said with a wink.
“Bobby said I could get financial aid and apply for scholarships,” Cas continued, as if reading Dean’s mind. “His son Daniel is a junior now, and Bobby said it hasn’t been that bad.”
Carmen looked pissed, but Amara just looked a little hurt. “She paid for the bail bond! What do you think?” Carmen said in a kind of whispered shout. In Kansas, a third DUI was a felony, and he knew bail was at least a thousand. People were milling around them, and Carmen didn’t like to cause scenes in public. She turned and walked toward the door before he even got to the bottom of the stairs. Amara gave him a sympathetic glance, but when he said nothing, she followed Carmen. What was he supposed to do? Thank her? He knew he should feel ashamed that his wife had to ask his mistress for bail money, but he just seethed with a formless anger. This was all his fault, obviously, but he felt aggrieved nonetheless.
Amara crouched down beside Dean and pulled at him more insistently. “Come on, Dean. Let’s go,” she said, trying to get a good hold on Dean’s bicep as Dean weakly resisted.
Sam asked him a bunch of questions about his DUI, his financial situation, about whether he wanted to legally separate from Carmen or get divorced, what Carmen wanted, and about his car. It was a lot, and Dean didn’t have answers for most of it, but he somehow knew things would be ok. Sam thought maybe they could get Dean’s sentence reduced to a misdemeanor if he did some kind of counseling and community service. Dean hadn’t had a drink since his accident, but he figured counseling would be better than a huge fine and being branded a felon, and maybe he could use the time to continue to get his head straight, even though he was already sober and had never been an alcoholic the way their dad had been, at least he didn’t think so.
A strong hand gripped his arm tight, branding him, and hauled him from the flames. His mother’s face was replaced with his blue-eyed angel’s. One of the few things he remembered his mother saying to him as a child was “Angels are watching over you,” and here he was. Dean’s melted skin fell away leaving him fresh and raw. He scrambled into Cas’s arms and curled into his chest, sobbing. “You’re safe Dean,” Cas assured him, stroking his head and rocking him like a newborn. “You’re safe.”
“No way!” Benny said, equally aghast that someone over the age of fifteen wouldn’t be behind the wheel. Dean had asked Cas about it once and he’d said he didn’t even have a license, just rode his bike or the bus everywhere.
Dean realized he hadn’t even thought of Bertha since the last time he used her. “No, haven’t done that either since I bonked my head,” he said.
“Yeah, I know, it did the same to me,” replied Charlie as she followed Sam out of the room, “But still, even though it’s weird that these stories are about you, if we take that off… the stories are very good.”
This was weird. Sam knew it was. After all, he was reading made up stories about his brother dating his angel friend, he couldn’t have predicted it. He still didn’t know whether he would read the other fanfiction though. Yes, it was obvious Charlie had good taste since he enjoyed
“Yeah, I… I just…” stuttered Dean, “I really reciprocate, you know,” he said, and the man was grateful for the darkness hiding the blush that was back once again.
The three friends were done with dinner in an hour, and Sam was cleaning the dishes while his brother prepared the popcorn and Castiel waited in the Dean-cave. The younger brother couldn’t help but send short glances at his phone as if he was drawn to it. After all, Charlie had sent him a new link and… this was weird. The whole situation was… weird.
He clicked on the first link, not sure about what he could find. Charlie had put a few comments above each link, and this one said,
Therefore, Sam led his friend there, and as Charlie sat on the bed, she started, “So, tall man, tell me where are the other two?”
“Awesome,” beamed Dean to his brother, “I’m gonna make lasagna, she loves those,” he added as he got back to his laptop.
Sam’s eyes flicked between the two men, and he couldn’t help but remember all the small details from the fic. All the lingering stares, the smiles. He knew it was all there before but now it all had a new look. Sam knew that it probably didn’t mean anything, after all, those fanfictions were only based on what was written in the Supernatural books and only he knew what actually happened between his brother and the angel.
Tears came back, stronger this time, Sam didn’t even know why he was crying, this was a fake story, his brother was alive and so was Castiel. They weren’t in the 70s anymore and… and Sam was crying, hiding his face in Dean’s crook as he stroked his back, soothing him.
“Calm down Samantha, I won’t tell him, chill,” laughed Charlie, “plus if you go down, I have to go down with you and I’m not doing that.”
Hoping his answer had satisfied Dean, Sam was a bit anxious to see his brother settle on the bed next to him.
After some awkward seconds for Sam and Dean – Castiel was back to  being focused on the movie the next second – the younger brother stood up, and after clearing his throat, he announced, “I’m gonna sleep guys… See you tomorrow.”
The hours kept passing as he continued his reading, allowing his body to take a break when his brother and his friend finally had an honest-to-God conversation.
“Hello Sam,” he said, his voice as deep as usual, “are you feeling better? Dean told me that you weren’t well last night.”
It was seven in the morning when Sam woke up. As he entered the kitchen, he immediately noticed his brother missing. After all these years, Dean always did his best to wake up early, or at least that’s what he said each time he would be up because of a bad dream.
“Yeah, Sam’s right,” she intervened, “It’s just some weird stuff we found on the web earlier, nothing to worry about, let’s just… move on,” she finished with the same smile as the taller man.
“Okay, well,” continued the blonde man, “Charlie just texted me. She should arrive during the night, so be sure to be awake, and let me know when she’s here,” he added as he turned away.
He had been shocked to see how good the story was written, and the few parts he was mentioned in did feel quite strange, even more so when he read about Jess. Jess and him.
Maybe Dean’s heart was doing wild things in his chest, and maybe the hunter was doing his best to not have a giddy smile in front of Cas, but it took him a second to realise that he didn’t have to hide anymore.
This time, it was during the fight between the two teams that Dean shrugged and smiled, “I love Iron Man.”
Behind the elder hunter, Charlie snorted, before staring at the ground under the angry look on Dean’s eyes.
Sam smiled as he quickly nodded. The angel in front of him followed Dean’s footsteps, and in a few seconds, the bunker was empty again.
“Dean,” murmured Castiel, putting his  hand on Dean’s cheek, “I witnessed the creation of life and saw many things, but, and I say this with my whole being, nothing could ever compare to the brightness of your soul, to the good that’s in you.”
“What? No! I don’t… okay I do, but I just started,” exclaimed Same sitting up in his bed, “Charlie sent me a few links and I thought, “hey, why not?” so I read a few and that’s it.”
“Yes?” asked the angel looking at his friend, “is everything alright?” he added when he saw the look on Dean’s face.
“Boring, as always,” replied the woman, “but you know me, I have my special Spotify playlist to keep me company.”
” A soft smile appeared on his face, his whole life almost looked normal now. He had a home, lived with his brother and an angel – this part was slightly less normal – and they’d even go to a grocery store like  regular people.
“I’m fine, thanks Charlie,” mumbled Sam, ignoring the questioning look on Dean’s face. “So… what’s up?”
Castiel kept his eyes locked with Dean as he stated, “you didn’t answer my question, though,” with an impenetrable look on his face.
After lunch, Sam went back into his room, his mind still stuck on Twist and Shout, and still stuck on the heartbreak he had felt. Somehow, he had succeeded to separate himself from the story, as if the characters written were just casually wearing the same names as everyone around him.
“Uh,” hesitated Sam after taking a sip of his beverage, “It was a little bit… deconcentrating in the beginning, yes. I mean, after all, I was reading about myself, so yes, definitely weird. But then as I started to… separate myself from the story, it was okay,” he finished.
Dean slowly pulled back, and rested his forehead against the angel’s as both men tried to catch their breath.
Sam’s smile fainted as he replied, “Still am… I just… it’s hard to believe I got this attached to… a fanfiction.”
Sam took his computer and walked to the war room. The bunker was silent, Dean and Cas were probably sleeping, and he sat in the first chair, opened his emails and started typing.
Dean choked on his beer as both brothers were fixing the angel. Silence fell over them. This wasn’t happening. This couldn’t happen. A deep red blush started appearing on Dean’s cheek as his mouth fell open.
Dinner time came quickly, or at least, it did to Sam. His thoughts were still focused on the story he had just read and he barely noticed when Dean – who woke up half an hour ago – put a glass of water in front of him.
Dean clenched his jaw as he rolled his eyes, doing his best to avoid answering the question. Sam had seen his brother doing this in the past, but now he had no idea what could have possibly made his brother so angry that he would lose his temper.
Dean’s brows frowned, slowly nodded and walked next to his brother’s bed, and after sitting next to him, he continued, “Okay, well, I was thinking maybe tonight I could make lasagna and we could do a movie night? You, me and Cas,” then smiling he added, “it’s been a while since we last did that.”
Charlie stared at Sam quickly, her eyebrows raising in happiness, or at the very least, surprise. Her eyes showed how fast her mind was working to imagine every possible end to this situation when Dean spoke, “okay then.”
Sam had read Dean and Castiel fall in love two times already, and yet he couldn’t have imagined the two of them getting together for real. There was something unsaid in Castiel’s eyes, Sam noticed, and he was certain that the angel was doing his best to make Dean understand, to at least make him face what is between the two of them.
“Yep, understandable,” smiled the woman. “You know, in the two fanfictions that you read, you were in it as well… wasn’t this… very weird? Or awkward?” she then asked.
“Oh I bet they are,” she chuckled before adding, “tell your brother that I’m gonna give him some reading recommendations.”
The taller man immediately glanced at Charlie, who instantly closed her laptop and took her drink in her hands, both friends pretending that the last 10 minutes never happened.
He remembered this was a fanfiction on his brother and his friend but even he had to admit that as he read it, the characters started to… have a life of their own, and he didn’t associate them with the people he shared the bunker with. He didn’t move from his seat, unable to form any thoughts that wouldn’t be linked to the story he just finished.
“Uh, yeah, I did,” replied the hunter, “A long time ago, but wait, is… Dean the millionaire or the one who is… bought?”
The two men kept on staring at each other, the movie passing behind them while they ignored it. Dean was back to being a teenager, all flustered because of someone, the blush never leaving his face as he did his best to not look down under Cas’ gaze.
“Uh… the one called Angel Cookies? I don’t think so. Istill need time to.. you know… recover,” grimaced Sam as his mind reminded him of the
Sam laughed softly as he started eating his burger again. The idea of reading fanfictions never appealed to him, he was a bit scared of all the weird stuff he could find, but he had no idea that people would actually be so involved to invent a whole background story in another period.
At least that was the only thing he had found to reassure himself. Maybe this fanfiction wouldn’t be as good as the one before, after all, Ninety-One Whiskey was probably one of the best stories he ever read, actual books included.
That was getting a bit awkward, giving Cas advice to hit on Sam’s brother, but after all, if that was how the dark-haired angel felt, then Sam might as well help him. Maybe  all those lingering stares and touches Sam witnessed in the past had indeed held meaning.
“Reading?” repeated Dean narrowing his eyes and walking into the room. “In your whole life, you never ever stayed in bed this late. You’re sure you’re not sick or something?”
“That’s awesome Charlie!! I can’t wait to see you,” he looked at Dean who mouthed, is she coming? To which Sam nodded, before resuming, “and Dean and Cas will be really happy to see you too!”
He blinked, remembering how it all started with Charlie’s email and how now, fanfictions had turned real, making Dean and Castiel fall in love once more.
Sam clenched his jaw, he should have known that sooner or later this question would come, and even if time had passed and he was okay now, he still felt guilty and sad when the conversation turned to Jess.
The hunter sat again in the bed and held his head in his hand, before grabbing his computer that was on the ground – Castiel probably had put it here as he came into his room – and opened his emails again.
“Yeah, of course, I am,” he answered, “I guess I just rarely see Dean going out with anyone so that’s… it. I’m not used to it.”
“Well, think about it,” replied the angel, tilting his head, “we both did sacrifice ourselves for each other and despite I know that this could be interpreted as a friendly behaviour, if we take a look at some websites, it appears that – in the books, at least – we share some long stares and lingering touches, and I rebelled against Heaven for you,” Cas started to hesitate, “and felt for the first time, for you,” he finished, his eyes locked with Dean’s.
Dean’s face was a mix of so many intense emotions, it was impossible for the younger Winchester to guess what he was thinking. Shock was obvious, but there was something else for sure.
A few dozen questions followed him as he sat at the war room’s table, in front of a cup of coffee and a note saying, “
Dean instantly squirmed as his eyes fluttered. He wasn’t used to being complimented and definitely not with a word like that, not with a word that was for ladies as his father would say.
“Yeah, well,” hesitated the older hunter, “maybe I don’t want to say anything in front of you,” he replied as he stared at the two friends.
Charlie’s mouth agape, she turned to Sam and the hunter smiled excitedly, delighted to see his brother facing his emotions for once in his life.
It was all the hunter needed to gain confidence, wrapping his other hand around Cas’ neck to hold him steady. Castiel didn’t have a lot of experience but he definitely was a fast learner, and the brush of his tongue against Dean’s combined with his hand disappearing under the hunter’s shirt was driving Dean crazy.
Sam knew that the Supernatural books had a… fandom, and discovering it was already weird enough but learning about fanfiction, it was… wow. People really did that? What would they be writing about? Their life was already filled enough with dealing with demons, angels and all sorts of monsters that he couldn’t imagine what else people could add.
“Well, I am aware of how most animals court each other,” started the angel, “ but humans remain something very different since it always involves feelings, which, as you know, I am new to. Therefore, I suppose I cannot do anything but hope that Dean returns my sentiments.”
“Hey!” interrupted the older hunter standing up between the two friends, “what are you? Four years old?”
Dean immediately stopped in the corridor, and as he slowly faced his brother again, he stuttered, “Uh… Yeah, we are, but we, uh… we could, uh…” he glanced at Cas before continuing, “We might be late, so in case we aren’t back, be there to welcome Charlie, okay?”
He, in fact, had to wait only for thirty-five minutes before the hunter heard the bunker door open and a very familiar voice yelling, “Hey bitches, where are you?”
He had to admit that the story was actually well written and he liked all the details. He had finished the first chapter in an hour and read the encounter between his brother and his friend. He wasn’t sure if he really wanted to continue it. Of course, he was into the story but he knew where this was going and he realised he would inevitably look at Dean and Cas differently after that.
Another one… Sam wouldn’t read it. Actually, he will never read another fanfiction again. It’s better this way. Putting new clothes on, he walked to the war room where he found Dean, a plate with a hamburger on  it and a beer, doing some reading on his laptop. Looking for a new case with no doubt.
“Well, earlier today, Dean was curious as to why I was down, and Castiel knew that it was because of a fic, and he also knew I didn’t want Dean to know,” explained Sam, “And he brought up the fact that people wrote stories about them being together… I swear I never saw my brother blushing this hard.”
Sam sighed,  “Cas came into my room earlier and asked me if this night out with Dean could be considered as “couple material”, and when I told him his actions only had the meaning he gave them well…”
“Sure Samantha,” smiled Dean, “mind telling me why you were crying last night, Cas told me you were doing some intense reading but I don’t buy it,” he said, as Sam turned to Cas who deliberately ignored him. “You don’t cry, you never do, so what’s the matter?”
Both men in front of him looked at him, a worried look on Dean’s face, he immediately reassured, “I’m fine, I’m just gonna finish it in my room, I got some…reading to do.”
Silence fell on the room, and Sam could swear that Dean was blushing, his mouth open, trying to find a good argument to oppose Castiel, in vain.
“I do like the idea of that, yes,” stated the angel. “I am just unaware of what Dean’s… reaction could be. I wouldn’t want to impose anything on your brother, of course, and I surely don’t want to ruin our friendship over something that could be easily avoided.”
The two friends made their way back to the war room, where Charlie had previously left one of her backpacks, and where Sam had prepared the mugs of hot chocolate.
“Nothing just… Nothing. I promise, I’m fine Dean,” he added, seeing the worry in his brother’s face.
They finally reunited in the Dean-cave, and while Sam sat on the armchair, Castiel and Dean chose the couch.
“I don’t know,” hesitated Sam, “it’s not the same for everyone, but basically it’s acting or saying stuff that would make the other person know that you… love them.”
Castiel’s thumb brushed Dean’s palm and the hunter leaned in slowly, his eyes questioning the angel who nodded quickly.
Dean was working with Cas but he was arrogant and yeah, that was pretty accurate. He shrugged as he heard the water whistling and poured it in a mug with a small bag of tea. He sat more comfortable in his chair, his hands warming as he held his mug. He was smiling now, the same feeling of addiction spreading through his veins as when he started a new show.
“And what does this have to do with Elvis?” asked Dean cautiously as his brother was sitting again in front of his computer.
What Sam thought was a deep silence earlier was now even worse. No one dared to move, Sam glanced at Charlie, whose mouth was open wide in shock, as he tried to process what was happening. What was actually happening.
Castiel’s head tilted – as usual, – he resumed, “Well, I found some stories written by fans of the books “Supernatural” and it appears that in many of them, we are together, so I started wondering if I ever made you feel like I was expecting something similar to a romantic relationship from you. Or actually, if any of my  behaviour ever made you feel uncomfortable?”
The two friends stared at each other, and after Castiel’s usual head tilt, Dean added, “nothing important okay, now can we just enjoy Charlie’s presence and move on?”
“Uh,” tried Castiel as he joined Dean, “Is this the fanfiction that made you feel down lately?” he asked, looking at Sam.
Dean’s eyes finally let go of the screen and stared back at Sam, his brows frowned in a suspicious look.
Beside him, his brother just hummed, not even talking anymore. Dean’s eyes still closed, Sam realised that Dean fell asleep. He knew his brother worked a lot lately and he didn’t want to prevent him from resting, especially when it happened so suddenly.
“Yeah, don’t worry,” replied the younger man, “And it’s Sam,” he added, taking the seat next to Dean.
When he got into his room, he put the plate on his desk and opened his laptop, finally answering his friend.
“Well, we were forced to face this… situation, but you would never lose me Dean,” replied Cas laying his eyes on Dean once more.
“Eh… I don’t know,” shrugged Sam, “It would be weird to read a story about me, I mean… weirder than to read one about my brother and his best friend falling in love.”
Dean blinked, and Sam’s eyes were going back and forth between the two men, amazed by what was happening before him. In his whole life, he had rarely seen his brother this flustered and blushing this violently, maybe after all that he wasn’t imagining things, and the fanfictions weren’t all false.
But after all, those stories weren’t his actual life, they were telling the stories of people with whom his family shared names.
“I… no Cas, we are not in a… relationship, and we don’t behave like a couple, and you don’t make me uncomfortable,” answered Dean, focusing again on his computer’s screen. “If you’d make me uncomfortable I would tell you, okay?”
He gave a quick look at the clock, 9:47 pm. How? He hadn’t even felt the time pass. Damn, Charlie could have warned him that the story was addictive. He took his laptop in one hand and the now empty plate in the other hand and started walking back to the kitchen, where he put the plate in the sink. At the same time, he put some water to boil, and sat on a chair, his eyes not leaving the screen.
“True,” laughed Charlie, “Well anyway, there’s another fic you have to read, it’s based on a movie, Indecent Proposal, I don’t know if you watched it…” she said as she opened her laptop.
“Great,” mumbled the other hunter before closing his eyes, “Now Cas, come here please, we’re having a movie night with lasagna. You like those.”
“I needed your computer to do some research,” started Castiel raising his hands as a sign of peace, “and the page was already open. I just read the beginning before realising what it was. I didn’t know you read fanfictions,” he added with his signature head-tilt.
Out of nowhere, Sam’s phone rang and as he checked, the name CHARLIE appeared on his screen. Glaring at his brother, he answered the call.
Dean’s cheeks turned red as, flustered, he replied, “we do not make a good couple, we aren’t even together!”
“Oh no,” replied Dean, pointing at the computer, “this? This isn’t nothing. What even is it? Indecent Proposal, a fanfiction, seriously Sam?”
“No, I’m not,” groaned Sam, taking Dean’s beer and drinking a sip as he ignored the frown of his brows.
“No no no,” cut Dean, “You spent your whole day in your room, tonight we hang out all together, alright?”
Sam had spent the last few days reading fanfictions. He had spent the last few days reading Dean and Castiel falling in love. Reading others’ reactions to it, reading the way themselves, they realised it was love. And at this exact moment, Sam was struck by what Castiel was saying.
“I know, I’m still waiting for you to share it by the way,” chuckled Sam as he grabbed the bags and headed to the corridor that led to the numerous rooms in the bunker.
He heard a knock on the door while he was starting the last chapter, lifting his eyes from the screen for the first time in a few hours. He saw his brother with a worried look on his face.
“I don’t know,” slowly answered the hunter, “Maybe, but Cas,” he continued quickly, “It doesn’t matter what people think, alright? The way you act has the meaning you give it. So it’s ‘couple material’ only if you want it to be.”
The thought of informing his brother came to his mind, but he quickly forgot about it, not ready to face once again a Dean pissed off about ‘douchebags-that-can’t-live-their-own-life’. He closed his laptop, finally deciding to ignore the information as he went to the kitchen, trying to find something to eat.
The two men stared at each other for an instant before the human replied, “Cas I don’t know, I just read like… two fanfictions and one of them broke me, and it’s… 11 in the morning, and I just woke up,” Sam added sighing, “Can we talk about it later?”
This couldn’t be happening. This just wasn’t possible. Sam was stuck in some kind of bad dream. How was he supposed to explain to an angel why some actions he did could’ve another meaning?
“Nope, for once I want to appreciate Jennifer Aniston,” stated Charlie as Dean tilted his head in approval. “Plus, I have the movie on my laptop, so you can’t avoid it,” she added with a smile.
“No, no no no,” replied hurriedly Sam standing up and facing Cas. “It’s very nice, on the contrary, you guys… have a good evening,” he added with a smile.
“Dean,” tried Sam, smiling awkwardly as he closed the laptop, “it’s uh… nothing… we… it’s not important,” he added, pleading Charlie with his eyes to help him.
The two friends fell silent as they both drank their hot chocolates until the hunter cleared his throat and continued, “And you know, I think Cas isn’t the only one interested in what they could become,” added Sam innocently.
He shook his head, trying to erase the image from his mind. He’d rather not imagine this. Really not.
Dean had always felt for Castiel, but never allowed himself to think that he could actually have something with his friend. Never daring to hope that an angel could love him, the Hell torturer.
“Well, your brother informed me that he had read some, so yes,” simply stated Castiel while Dean faced his brother.
None of them talked, but as their eyes met, Charlie and Sam burst out with laughter, incapable of containing their emotions.
Beside him, Castiel didn’t move either, the two friends silent for once, after all those movie nights where Dean would talk and talk, telling Cas as many anecdotes about the film as he could.
Sam chuckled softly when Castiel resumed before any of the brothers could speak, “I think Captain Rogers has his good reasons. It is vivid that Barnes plays a very important role in his life, and most definitely because of the love he has for him, he is willing to give up on everything and fight the world. That’s what you do for love, it is very relatable I suppose.”
Crowley lost his smile and spat out, “I’m offering to get you your blasted car back during work hours and that’s all you have to say to me?”
“You don’t have to be sorry,” Cas said, his eyes hooded. Dean felt tired too. “We don’t have to do...that.” Cas looked over Dean’s shoulder toward his ass.
“A few peas?” Dean said. It seemed he was unable to speak without question marks. Whatever was in the IV was making him feel more alert and less nauseous though. He felt ready to go.
Cas placed the plate on the bedside table. “Would you like me to open the window?” he asked in the same whisper, like a caress. “It’s very pleasant outside.”
That night it was time to party at The Roadhouse with his coworkers in celebration. Everyone was there--Lee, Ash, Meg, and Charlie--and they all drank so much and laughed so hard that Ellen threatened to throw them out several times. She finally did when Dean placed his bare foot and monitor-free ankle on the tabletop for everyone to admire, causing his friends to scream with laughter. Charlie and Lee held Dean down to shove his sock and boot back on, and eventually Dean and Lee’s wrestling spilled out of their booth onto the floor. “Hey, hey! Get a room boys!” Ellen yelled as she pushed the whole gang toward the door. They all stumbled out onto the sidewalk, with Dean and Lee hanging on to Carmen, and Charlie and Ash hanging on to Meg, since Carmen and Meg were the only mostly-sober ones. Charlie was trying to kiss Meg, and Lee was trying to kiss Dean as they weaved and laughed into the parking lot.
“That’s a picture of my car from More Power Muscles, from last year,” Dean said with pride, sliding the open manila folder across the loan officer’s desk with the photo of Baby on top of the papers. Getting Baby into that magazine was one of the proudest moments of Dean’s life.
“Take care, Benny,” Dean said, feeling like he had to appease his friend somehow, although he didn’t know what he’d done wrong. What did it matter to Benny if he didn’t care about his car anymore? Cars were just a collection of metal parts.
“I suppose,” Cas agreed. “I never went to a traditional school or anything. We moved around a lot, but my mother kept a number of books and I always sought out the library wherever we were. There is so much to learn in this world.”
“Yeah, I guess so,” he agreed. Dean opened his eyes and laid a hand on Cas’s face, stroking the stubble there. He closed the fraction of space between them and pressed their lips together. “It makes me sick to think about what happened to you and Carmen,” he said after the kiss. “To have your own dad do that.”
“Me too, baby,” Dean said, feeling protective of the beautiful boy in his arms. “I think it’s safe to say our marriage is over.” They let the gravity of what they’d done sit between them for a while, neither knowing what to say or do to make the situation right. Without asking Cas about it, Dean knew that he and Cas were not a one-time fling. They were both in deep as soon as it started.
He thought of Sam in khakis and an oxford shirt at Stanford. What would he think of Dean’s sordid life? He could picture him shaking his head in disapproval. The image of twelve-year-old Sammy’s fallen expression when he’d figured out Dean had been stealing flashed in Dean’s mind. The kid had no idea what else Dean was doing for money. He blinked Sammy’s face away, shoving that shit down hard inside himself. Why did he care what Sam would think? And where was Cas, and what was he doing? Why did he give a fuck what Cas was doing? Why was he thinking about this crap on his day off and not concentrating on Baby? He dropped the hood closed, finished the last of a six-pack and tossed the empty can in the corner of the garage, put away his tools, and got in the car, breathing hard.
“Well yeah, Sam, life is strange,” Dean conceded. “I’m not gonna turn my back on something this good because it’s strange. What me and Cas got going between us...it’s not like anything else I’ve experienced, and I’m gonna go with it, y’know?” he said, feeling more passionate as he spoke.
When the doorbell rang, Cas rose to pay for the pizza since he was the only one with cash in the house these days. Sam turned to Dean, his face doing that twitchy thing it did when he didn’t know how his words would be received. Dean smiled to see the expression. Still his same old Sammy. He said in a low voice, “Um, Cas is...interesting.”
Fuming silently in the back of the fucking Kia on the ride home, all Dean could think about was how to get Baby out of impound. Never mind that she’d probably be taken back once he was sentenced and he’d probably have his license suspended for a while. He couldn’t bear the thought of her being abused..
Carmen raised her hands in exasperation and dropped her fork with a clink. She let out a deep breath and stalked into the kitchen.
“We’ll give Dean a little something to eat, and then you can go home,” she concluded, leaving without even looking at them as if her mind were already on her next task.
Lee bounced into the room, a scrap of paper in his hand, as Dean zipped up his coveralls. He waved the paper in front of Dean’s face. “Sparkle’s phone number,” he said with a smirk, offering the paper to Dean. Dean stared at him blankly for a moment and then recalled, as if it happened in a different lifetime, that he and Lee had been making a game out of trying to get that stripper’s phone number for months.
Lee’s eyes widened. “You serious? She wanted me to give it to you even though you fainted like a pussy.”
“I apologize,” Castiel said, “I arrived at nine o’clock.” He had a careful way of speaking and a deep voice that Dean didn’t expect. He also noticed that the guy had the bluest eyes he’d ever seen, wide with contrition. Dean tried not to stare, but Castiel was sort of gorgeous, and up close looked more like a man than a teenager.
Cas manhandled Dean onto his stomach and caressed his ass cheeks as if they were crystal balls. Dean relaxed into his touch and didn’t flinch when he heard Cas pop the cap on the tube of lube or when cool wet fingers pressed into his crack and rubbed against his hole. “You’ve done this before?” Cas asked, pressing one finger past the rim.
After Amara was gone, he took a shower, got dressed, and headed into their little garage to visit Baby. The ‘67 Chevy Impala was his life. She had been his dad’s, but it was Dean who kept her in mint condition, and since his dad drank himself to death five years ago, Baby was his. She had gotten him his job at Crowley’s Restoration and Repair. Crowley, the temperamental owner, had been so impressed with Dean’s skills that he was willing to overlook his record and lack of formal certification, but he said he’d toss Dean out on his ass if he ever came to work drunk or got out of line in any other way. Six years later and he still had the job restoring classic cars. No benefits, but he made decent money and loved his work and his crew of friends there. Dean knew how to keep his work and his vices separate.
Dean found himself standing and entering the house as Cas said, “Oh, ok,” meekly. “I’ll just get my things.” Both Cas and Carmen turned to look at Dean as he entered as if they’d forgotten he was out there at all.
“Oh, no, no, he’s just fine,” Carmen continued into the phone. She looked over at Dean. “I’ll tell him when he wakes up.”
Sam started moving forward again and extended his hand when he and Dean reached Cas. “You must be Cas,” Sam said, while Cas shook his hand.
Carmen was like a newborn fawn, stumbling a little on unsteady legs. It also looked like she’d been crying. Amara straightened her skirt and sat beside Benny who put his arm around her, while Carmen stepped into the kitchen and brought out a tray of snacks, placing it on the coffee table, and then sat in the chair across from the couch and studiously didn’t look at Dean.
Dean shook his head. He wanted to sleep, but he also wanted to continue looking around, afraid that he’d miss something important, something strange and magnificent.
Next Dean called the courthouse, and between all the various people he had to talk to and all the times he was put on hold, the call ended up taking over two hours. He did, in fact, have a lawyer appointed to him, and his arraignment was in three days. He was supposed to have contacted the lawyer earlier, but by the time he got off the phone, he had set up a meeting, making sure it was after Sam arrived so he could be there too.
He already figured they were at their limit, but he moved the phone away from his mouth and told Carmen, “We’re at our limit.”
“Sh!” Dead shushed her to hear what else the voice had to tell him. “Can you repeat that please?” he asked.
This time, they took his license and Baby away from him. Dean felt like they’d chopped off his arm. He’d almost cried in front of the judge. At least it was early enough in the day that he didn’t have to stay in jail overnight and they were letting him go pending bail and setting a court date. Dean descended the marble courthouse staircase late that afternoon to see both Carmen and Amara waiting for him at the bottom. He stopped midway down. “What the hell is she doing here?” he directed at Carmen, pointing at Amara, but he already knew.
making the pain spike in Dean’s head. He felt like he needed to be horizontal in the immediate future or he would just fold over toward the dashboard of the little Kia. “What am I supposed to do? They said that he’s stable and they can’t do anything more without insurance!” She seemed near tears.
Cas released Dean’s chin, turned and left the room without answering. Carmen gave him a puzzled look but then turned her attention to Dean. “Amara and Benny are coming over tonight.”
Dean shook his head, smiling again at Cas’s penchant for talking like an old guy. “Ok, lover boy, go take care of those plants,” he said and shoved Cas toward the front door. “We’ll continue this later.”
“Y’know, Dean,” she said, throwing up her hands, “that’s the first opinion about anything you’ve had since you cracked your head. So y’know what. I’m gonna go stay with Amara and Benny, and you two lovebirds stay here together.” With that she stormed into the bedroom, made some noise in there, came back out holding a bulging quilted bag, left the house, and slammed the front door behind her. Dean and Cas stayed frozen in place until they heard her start up the Kia and drive away.
In the car on the way, Dean drifted in and out, Carmen muttering about insurance and money from the driver’s seat. He slept through the long wait at the emergency room, and eventually roused enough to enter a cubicle where a nurse took all his vitals and blood and hooked him up to an IV. Carmen stood by fidgeting the whole time while Dean reclined and dozed again.
“Man, maybe you should be in a relationship with the pizza,” Sam quipped after swallowing his own mouthful.
Dean stood and met up with Cas in the kitchen. He crowded him up against the counter, cradled Cas’s face in his hands, and whispered, “This is all I need,” before kissing him.
As soon as he opened his eyes, Dean knew it was over. He looked around from where he lay, cozy and warm, cocooned in blankets. Everything was as it had been before in his backyard--the recently overturned dirt, the cinderblock wall, the dingy lawn furniture--but he saw previously unnoticed details--a crack in the wall that looked like Jack Skellington, the shimmering wings of a fly on the nearby lawn chair, the long, pale, green seed pods on the neighbor’s tree, visible over the wall. He was aware of how blue the sky and how green the grass were even though he knew the colors were nothing out of the ordinary. The drug had worn off, but all the heightened perception of the day before still lingered.
Dean figured he was probably right. “That’s right,” he responded, done with the conversation and already moving toward his bedroom to put on a shirt. “Take that bacon and meditate on it,” he said over his shoulder, having to have the last word even though it didn’t make any sense.
Dean and Benny watched back-to-back episodes of their favorite show, Classic Speed, for a while, laughing and talking through it all. Dean got out his three-foot bong, the one he called Bertha, and the two of them laughed and talked louder and louder the more they smoked. Soon they weren’t even watching anymore and Dean was standing over the coffee table entertaining Benny by describing his ankle monitor experience between hits.
There was a knock on the front door, and he opened it to find Amara on the other side in a tight red mini dress, her tousled hair swept up in a big clip. He turned and walked toward the kitchen, and he didn’t stop her as she followed. She only spoke after Dean had filled a glass of water at the sink, took a sip, and turned to face her.
Dean thought of his own dad, how despite everything he’d done wrong, he still claimed him as his own. He still loved him. After a long silence, Dean said, “Sorry I freaked out.”
Carmen scrunched up her face a bit like she had to think of how to answer. “Nah, not really, Cas,” she said. “I mean, I was pissed off with how things went down, but maybe it was all for the best?” She looked back and forth between Dean and Cas.
The next time he opened his eyes, the pain was muffled, like the tip of the knife was puncturing his forehead through layers of cotton. He could see now that his hands were wrapped in gauze. They stung distantly as if the wounds barely belonged to him.
“Dean, I don’t know if something was knocked loose in that blow to the noggin, but since you have been back, you’re coming in late, falling asleep under cars, and now you’re fixing up someone’s clunker for free on company time?”
One evening Cas brought home a KU catalogue from work. His boss, Bobby, gave it to him and said he would shuffle Cas’s schedule around it if he wanted to take a couple of classes.  In their tiny kitchen where Dean was cutting up potatoes for a stew, Cas explained, “He says I’m wasting my potential at the nursery and that I’m smart enough to run my own business or ‘do whatever the hell I want’.” For the last part, not only did Cas do his finger quotes, but imitated Bobby’s gruff delivery, making Dean laugh.
“I thought you were an asshole when I first came here,” Cas confessed in a whisper, “but I felt connected to you anyway.”
Cas’s words sent a warm flush from Dean’s chest up to his cheeks. Yes, that’s exactly what it felt like--a profound bond--although he didn’t have Cas’s way with words.
“Don’t worry about it, jerk,” Sam scoffed. “I mean, legal aid lawyers don’t make a ton, but I’m doing alright.”
Dean was starting to fade. His head hurt like a bitch and he was nauseated. “Bicycle. Car,” was all he managed before saying, “Think I’m gonna hurl.”
Dean laughed and held out a beckoning hand to Carmen, “Honey, come here.” Carmen’s face softened and Dean said, “Come on,” again, gesturing her over.
“Something to read?” Carmen spat. “Cas, I’ve read your stupid zen books, or whatever. You’re a little boy who thinks he’s a wise man.”
“Are you hungry, Sam?” Cas asked, breaking the silence. “You’ve had a long trip. We could order a pizza?”
Cas brought out a jug of water and a notebook and pen in case Dean wanted to write anything down. He found some trippy instrumental music to play on Dean’s phone--lots of chimes and gongs. He said it was better not to listen to music Dean was familiar with because the music would affect the trip. Dean figured Metallica and Zeppelin might not be the best music for it anyway. He laid back in the nest and raised his face to the sun. It was the perfect day for this, or he figured a seventy degree sunny day was perfect for a peyote trip, but what did he know?
Dean took a moment to let that sink in and then laughed. “That’s,” he started, paused to catch his breath, and then started again. “That’s fuckin’ awesome.” He looked at Cas beside him and could practically see the wheels turning in his dude’s brain.
Dean didn’t say anything to Cas as they finished up their shopping, checked out and carried their bags across the street to the bus stop. It wasn’t until they were seated on the bus, their bags in their laps that Dean looked at Cas and said, “Well, what about that?” They started cracking up and didn’t stop until they got off at their stop ten minutes later.
Dean made it through his first day back, but by the end of the second, he fell asleep on his creeper under a ‘66 Stingray. In a dream, he was an infant looking up at his mother. She reached out to him, her golden hair framing her beautiful smile and shimmering green eyes. He reached out to her and then was jarred awake as his hand was slapped away. Crowley stood above him, glowering, apparently having pulled him and the creeper out from under the car. “What the hell are you doing, Dean?” Crowley exclaimed, backing up as if he’d been assaulted.
“How do you know all that shit?” Dean asked before popping a few blueberries into his mouth. They were like little flavor bombs.
“Sometimes,” Cas said, now carrying his plate to the couch and sitting down. He placed the plate carefully on the coffee table and drew his legs and bare feet up easily to sit cross legged. Dean didn’t have a foot fetish, but Cas’s were slender and pale. Sexy damn feet.
Carmen directed her attention back at Dean and looked down at his crotch. “Ok, what happened to your pants?” she asked, exasperated.
“Look at that color though,” Dean said, holding the beet out so they could see the beet’s juicy interior.
Dean picked up the phone and called Carmen. She didn’t answer, so he left a message saying, “Hi Carmen. I know you probably hate me, but we need to talk about what we’re gonna do about everything. I’ll follow your lead. Ok, call me.” He almost said his usual automatic “Love you,” but stopped himself. Did he love her? Yes, but not the way he should.
Dean finally released Sam, held him at arm’s length, and found his voice. “Damn right, I’m happy.” He squeezed one of Sam’s biceps. “You’re a fuckin’ monster, Sammy!”
He draped the soft fleece blanket Carmen kept at the foot of the bed, around his shoulders and wandered out to the kitchen. He still hadn’t eaten since coming home from the hospital, but didn’t feel hungry. He was permiated with some kind of glow that transported him from one room to the next. He filled the coffee pot with water and watched as it heated up. He then took a mug from the cupboard and filled it with the hot water. The mug infused his hands with warmth. He sat at the table and sipped his hot water, feeling it travel down his esophagus and into his stomach from which it seemed to branch out into his extremities. It must have been late in the day because Cas arrived home and stood in the entryway looking at Dean as if trying to read him. Dean sipped his water. “Do you want something to eat?” Cas asked.
Dean stood frozen as he watched Cas walk into the house without another word. All he could think was that he wished Cas would kiss him.
Once he was alone in the house, the first thing Dean wanted to do was call Sam. He no longer felt that stubborn pride that kept him from calling for so long. The judgement he’d felt from Sam was really him seeing his own insecurities reflected back on himself. Dean thought he was a shitty person, so he’d assumed Sam felt the same way, but Dean was the one who had stopped calling; it took a lot of unanswered voice mails for Sam to give up. Excitement welled up in Dean’s chest as he pressed “Bitch” on his phone.
He thought about that. The only thing he’d found palatable so far were those peas. “I don’t know. Something round maybe?” he mused.
“I do, though. I have it,” she said, now even closer, running her hands up and down his triceps. Her perfume was cloying.
“This can be my present,” Cas said with a grin, tugging at Dean’s pants until he lifted up enough for Cas to release his erection. And with that he swallowed Dean down.
“Thank you, your Honor,” Marv said with a little bow, before packing up his mess of papers into his battered briefcase. “So long, boys,” he said to Sam and Dean before scurrying out of the courtroom without a backward glance.
As Crowley stalked away back to his office and Dean was still processing what just happened, he heard Charlie calling to him. “Dean, come on! Let’s go look at some boobs!” Earlier in the day, Dean had agreed to go out with everyone to the strip club after work, something they’d been doing together at least once a month since forever. Carmen had her usual girls night planned with Amara. Dean had been reluctant, but Charlie and Lee insisted. Charlie looped her arm through Dean’s and pulled him toward the locker room so he could change. “You think you’re gonna have a whole Harry Potter thing going on on your forehead?” she asked, pointing at his bandage. “That would be awesome!”
“Yes, it’s nice to meet you Sam,” Cas responded politely. He didn’t seem to know what to do with his body, scratching the back of his neck, then crossing his arms again, but he moved out of the way when he realized he was blocking them from entering. There was a palpable awkwardness as they all stood in the living room, but Dean didn’t care. His two favorite people were in a room together with him, and he couldn’t take his eyes off his little brother, all grown up.
The next day was filled with more anxiety and humliation, taking the fucking bus to work and thinking about how Baby was probably being abused while he took care of other people’s cars. While they were on their lunch break sharing a bucket of wings, he bitched and moaned about all of it to Ash, Lee, and Charlie while they looked at him with pity. “I’d let you borrow Yertle, but she’s all I’ve got,” Charlie said, giving him a side-hug. She was referring to her tricked out yellow 1976 Gremlin, which Dean always ridiculed.
Cas tilted his head in that cute, bird-like way he had when thinking about something. “I’m not sure college is for me,” he said. “My dream is to live off of the land, not beholden to any established infrastructure or authority. Universities are very much a part of the establishment.”
Time was unknowable, and it could have been hours or minutes before Dean stood up and looked around. The sun was no longer high in the sky, but its rays were still warm, although it felt like the warmth was radiating out of his skin rather than onto it. He smiled at Cas. “I want…” he started, then stopped.
Both Dean and Carmen were surprised into silence until Carmen said, “Cas, that’s great! What kind of job?”
It took some effort for his parole officer to get the ankle bracelet off, but when it finally clicked open, Dean felt like a hundred pounds had been lifted from him. “Thank you,” he said to Jerry, and it was heartfelt.
The next morning, Dean was torn out of a deep sleep by his blaring alarm, although he wasn’t aware at first what it was. He squinted into the light streaming through the window and tried to process the grating sound.
The next morning after Cas left for work, Dean wrote in the unused notebook Cas had set out for him during his peyote trip. He didn’t write anything about the actual trip since the details of his hallucinations were starting to fade somewhat. What remained of the experience, however, was the clarity with which he now saw his life. Whatever he decided to do, he had to set things straight and be more awake in his own life. Per Sam’s suggestion, he made a list of everything he had to do, something he’d never done before.
Lee frowned and stomped toward Crowley’s office, presumably to complain on Dean’s behalf, while Dean mounted the bike and headed home. He loved the ride, although he tried to be more careful since the accident so he didn’t get hit by any cars. He usually didn’t stop, but this time as he reached the Asian grocery he’d never gone into before, the brilliant colors of the vegetables on display out front called to him. He perched the bike against a telephone pole and examined all the produce. Most beautiful of all were the bunches of vibrant garnet beets with their plumes of green. “Wow, look at that,” Dean said to himself as he gathered up several bunches. “These are incredible.” He paid for them inside and carried them home on the handlebars.
“Have you been eating regularly, honey?” she asked. Her sweet voice contrasted with her no-nonsense demeanor.
The next morning, Dean was yanked out of sleep by the sound of Carmen’s hair dryer. Their bedroom was small enough that the attached bathroom was only a few feet away from the bed and you could hear everything even through the closed door. He’d had at least one too many beers the night before and had a good ache going behind his eyes.
So once he’d had his ankle bracelet removed and got the ignition interlock device installed, Baby had an honored place in the corner of their apartment complex’s parking lot, usually covered with a tarp. They took her out for a spin on occasion to show off her sleek black lines and keep her purring, but they still took the bus or rode their bikes (Dean had his own now) to work or classes depending on the weather. And Cas insisted they either rent an electric car or take the train to California for the visit they were planning in the summer.
“Uh huh,” Dean breathed into the pillow. He trusted Cas, but as his fingertip dipped inside, Dean tensed slightly. Cas kept it there, just a still presence, and stroked his hip with the other hand until Dean relaxed again.
The next few days, to his shame, Dean took the bus to work. He spent every free moment working to get Baby back. It took a whole day to track down the number for the impound lot where she was being kept, so during a ten-minute break between cars he called the number. After several minutes of god-awful hold music, a bored-sounding person finally answered and informed him that it would take almost six hundred fucking dollars for him to get her back. He wanted to cry. What the fuck was he going to do? The obvious answer was to ask Amara, but he was in too much debt to her already. Not having Baby was overshadowing the fact that he’d be getting a court summons in the mail soon and he’d probably have to be under house arrest again, lose his license and Baby for a while, and have to pay another huge fine since it was his third DUI. He wasn’t going to think about that, though, and thankfully Carmen hadn’t mentioned it either, although Dean knew she was thinking about it too. He’d considered for a nanosecond calling Sam for legal advice, but figured after over a year of not talking to each other, Sam’s reaction wouldn’t be a good one once he realized why Dean was calling. If he let himself think about it, which he rarely did, he missed Sam just as much as he missed Baby now, but not enough to put up with his sanctimonious bullshit.
“I’m not sure but it was something like… fags?” resumed Cas, “I am not sure of the meaning but I suppose it was an insult. That led to us being kicked out, and the other man as well.”
“The characters,” repeated the angel, “they obviously… love each other, and probably… avoided, well, facing their feelings, but now that they’re about to lose one another, they can’t escape it.”
Sam smiled softly as he watched the two men sleep through the morning. Seeing the bliss on Dean’s face was something that made Sam very happy after all those harsh years that the brothers had been through.
“Oh come on, Dean! You can’t just say “okay” to this! You should… I don’t know,” she stuttered, “try to express your emotions, maybe?”
Dean’s head on Cas’ chest, and the angel’s arm wrapped around Dean’s shoulders. The two men fell asleep this way after pulling a cover over the top of them. For once, Dean’s sleep wasn’t interrupted by nightmares, and morning came by fast on the sleepy couple.
The angel nodded quickly and Sam resumed, his face filled with concern, “Wait, you didn’t tell Dean right?”
Castiel who was sitting in front of the older brother, glanced up at Sam when he entered the room and returned to his reading – on an actual book this time. Everything was fine. After all, Castiel wouldn’t tell Dean about the fanfiction. And Sam could move on with his life.
The moment seemed stuck in time, and Dean could swear that the movie had gone silent as Castiel opened his mouth under him. Dean’s tongue was brushing on Cas’, hot and warm, while the angel whimpered at the touch.
“It was accidental,” intervened the angel, “I used Sam’s computer and the page was still on, I just wanted to know why people would think that and if you and I could be a good couple.”
An hour and a half later, they did make up. Or didn’t. They… Sam’s vision was blurry as he wiped off tears from his cheeks. He closed his laptop and let himself fall in his bed. There was no sleeping anymore. All Sam could think of was the Vietnam War, AIDS, the beach, and ’Can’t Help Falling in Love’. Oh God… he hated Charlie.
Sam shrugged in his chair and replied, “Yeah sure, anyway, see you tomorrow, be careful on the road okay?”
“Hi Gigantor,” laughed Charlie, “Just to let you know that I stopped at a gas station half an hour away from the bunker. I’ll be there soon, so prepare the hot chocolate.”
Cas laid his hand on Dean’s shoulder as he intervened, “Dean, you don’t have to say anything at all, as I said to your brother earlier I do not wish this to interfere in our current friendship,” he continued. “And if you do not reciprocate, I wouldn’t mind, I assure you.”
Dean had to smile because sometimes Cas sounded like a professor instead of a twenty-year-old who hadn’t been to school at all. “Yeah, what’s that?”
Back at home that night at the kitchen table, after eating the chicken dinner Carmen had made, Dean finished off his beer and broke the news to her. “So guess what?” he said. Cas rarely ate dinner with them for some reason, maybe because Dean always gave him a hard time.
Dean squirmed under the scrutiny. “Yeah, now get in the house,” he snapped. “I’m not here for your entertainment.” He looked around to make sure none of his neighbors were watching.
Dean didn’t know what was happening, but he knew it was right. He went in for another kiss, this time less chaste, and Cas became bolder as well, opening his mouth to let Dean’s tongue in.
“Are you still angry with me?” Cas asked, sounding like a little boy. Dean couldn’t help himself from placing an anchoring hand on Cas’s lower back.
That didn’t sound promising. “Whatever,” Dean grumbled. “But if he eats all our food or messes up the house, he’s out, right?”
Cas, who had moved his chair right up against Dean’s, gave him a kiss on the cheek. “Yes, it’s truly beautiful,” he agreed.
It took both Carmen and Cas, one under each arm, to haul Dean from the car into the bedroom and situate him on the bed. Dean could feel Cas’s warm breath against his face as he wrapped his arms around his shoulders to lower him inch by careful inch to the pillow.
There was a pause and the tapping of keys. “Sir, you are already at your limit,” the voice stated without judgement, but Dean still felt judged.
Cas walked right into the kitchen, making a beeline between Dean and Amara to the refrigerator as if he didn’t see them. He opened the refrigerator door, looked inside for a few moments, closed it without removing anything, turned around, and looked at them, expressionless.
“It’s a long story,” Sam said, his voice building with excitement, “but Professor Mills took a liking to me when she found out I was interested in legal aid because she fosters troubled teen girls, and almost everyone else in my class wanted to go into tech law or international law, or some other area that’s hot these days.” Dean’s chest filled with pride, not just to hear about Sam’s academic successes, but to know that he was still sticking to his original plan from when he was young, to study law so he could help people out who had no money. Dean had scoffed at his goals back then, asking what the point was of becoming a lawyer if you weren’t going to make the big bucks.
“That’s neat,” the weird-looking, skinny guy-- “Garth Fitzgerald IV” according to the nameplate on his desk-- said. “Do you have the title with you?”
“Hey, let’s eat some pizza and then we can talk about all the serious stuff,” Dean said to break the tension and because he really was hungry. He was back to enjoying some of the food he used to eat before the accident, but he didn’t wolf it down the same way he used to, and he had continued eating less meat and more veggies. When he opened the first box, he took a minute to let the aroma wash over him as Sam and Cas took their slices and started chowing down. Dean sat between Cas and Sam, his thigh pressed against Cas’s. When he did take his first cheesy bite, Dean chewed slowly, appreciating each flavor individually and in concert with one another.
Over Dean’s serviceable pasta primavera (he’d looked up online what to do with spaghetti and the remaining vegetables in the fridge), they talked about their future. Dean could build their house and Cas would grow their food. Before they got to that point, however, they both would have to work and save. They decided to look for a cheap apartment to share.
Dean smiled at Cas's enthusiasm, adding the potato cubes to the boiling pot. “Take some classes then,” he said, washing off some carrots. He wondered how Cas was going to pay for it considering they were saving for their future, and Dean still had legal and medical debt to pay off, but he agreed with Bobby that Cas was smart enough to pursue anything he wanted.
When he turned around to go back inside, Crowley was standing out front with his arms crossed. “Dean, we need to talk,” he said, leading the way into his office. “Have a seat,” he said, once they were both alone inside and he’d closed the door. Dean looked at him expectantly.
The next day while Carmen and Cas were at work, Dean shuffled into the bathroom and unwrapped the bandage from around his head. Underneath there was a piece of gauze over the wound. He peeled away the gauze to reveal a two-inch gash slightly diagonal and right of center high on his forehead. It looked a little like a narrow canyon with raised edges and a depression running up the middle with a neat line of pale stitches holding it together. It was still raw-looking, but he could tell it was starting to heal.
After a few seconds of silence where the human thought he was saved and stood up from his bed, Castiel started again, “But do you think that Dean and I behave like a human couple?”
He laughed at the word, remembering the first time he had heard it, at that musical performance in a high school. Taking a bite out of his meal again, he started reading, not sure at all about what to expect.
Dean had cooked, Sam could smell it from the corridor, the smell becoming more present as he entered the room and his eyes fell on Cas, sitting at the table. The angel turned his head and smiled softly at the taller man. Sam took his place in front of him, not even bothering to ask his brother what was  for dinner, he could now recognise the smell of Dean’s hamburger anywhere.
Sam suddenly felt two strong hands shaking him awake. It took him a few seconds for his eyes to get used to the light, but he finally recognised Castiel standing next to his bed.
“I don’t know I just… we both don’t like this whole Supernatural fandom thing,” started the hunter, “and I was clearly not expecting to appreciate the fanfictions, but turns out… turns out they’re pretty neat and very very well-written.”
Stepping closer to Dean, Castiel started, “Dean, if I believe what Sam told me earlier, it appears that some of our behaviour, what we say or do, can be very common in friendship but can as well be interpreted as couple material.”
Today was different, and Sam was convinced that something had happened between his brother and his friend after he and Charlie had left them alone the previous night.
“Well, I don’t know, first you tell me that Dean does dig Elvis, then you talk about Cas wondering whether his and Dean’s behaviour is the one of a couple, and now they go out together to have pizza when we both know how much food means to your brother?” stated Charlie without even breathing, “I mean, sorry for saying but are we actually sure that the stories can’t become real?”
After a few minutes, Dean sat next to Cas, giving a plate to Sam, “No pickles, don’t worry,” then, turning towards their friend, he asked, “You sure you don’t want anything, Cas?”
The hunter was craving more, he knew he was, but he also knew that too many of his past relationships had relied on physical stuff only, and he didn’t want this to be the same. Maybe he cared too much, maybe Cas was the one – no matter how frightening this thought was – but Dean was ready to do anything to make it work.
His brows furrowed  in confusion, he walked to the Dean-cave, and as he opened the door, Sam saw on the sofa the two men cuddled against each other. Dean’s hand laid on Cas’ shoulder as his head was still resting on the angel’s chest.
“Charlie,” exclaimed Sam as he hugged the redhead who let her bags fall to the ground. “How was the road?”
And right now, he had to admit that he could understand why some people could think that there was something more.
“Come on Sammy, the lasagna is in the oven,” started Dean, “We gotta decide what movie we’ll watch tonight.”
Charlie did her best to contain her smile, as Dean glared at Sam whose face was turning red in embarrassment. There was no possible way that he would get out of this situation safely.
“Uh… Yeah…” hesitated the elder brother wrapping his arm around Sam’s shoulder making him stand up, “I guess I can dig Elvis. Sammy are you…”
He didn’t wait, and instead prepared himself a cup of coffee to take with him into his room. After pulling on his pyjamas, he opened his laptop and went back to the email Charlie had sent  him, to find the link to the story.
Sam realised Charlie’s mistake too late. While he was just standing up – and Charlie was turning, her face marked with horror – he saw his brother’s face changing and his smile vanish as his eyes read what was on the screen.
Sam didn’t give Dean any chance to intervene again and entered his room immediately. He let himself sink onto the bed, wrapping himself in the warmth of the covers. The hunter felt like he hadn’t slept in weeks, and while he knew he had dealt with worse in the past, the sorrow still burned through his stomach.
Sam saw the notification of the email Charlie had sent him hours ago, but he read the subject of it, and he was pretty sure he would rather read it when he was on his own, or at least after he had drunk a few beers. His brother and him were on the road, heading back to the bunker after a random hunt, some ghosts to burn… nothing out of the ordinary.
The angel nodded shortly, before looking back to the screen of the TV, on the other hand, Dean’s stare didn’t leave Cas’ face. His features were soft, enlightened by the movie, and the human couldn’t bring himself to look away.
