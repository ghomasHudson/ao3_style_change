Making his way up the stairs two and three at a time, Sherlock dashed as quietly as he could. He could hear Irene's voice, raised and upset.
“Nah. I do. Always liked the smell. Best par' of bein' in the kitchen when you shower,” John insisted as Sherlock realized he spoke out loud.
“Easy, there, gorgeous.” John reached a hand out to him, tracing calming circles over the back of his hand. “You’ve already impressed me.”
Sherlock’s pulse jumped as he slowly moved forward, closing the distance between them. And when their lips touched, it was better than Sherlock had dreamed. Before too long, Sherlock had to break the kiss, and both men breathed a little harder.
“No,” he managed. She stepped towards him, giving him three lashes to the other arm. His military training took over, and he braced himself for more pain, still gripping the phone.
“Actually, let's get you into a more comfortable position while I make sure the police take as little of my time as possible.” He then used the duvet to cushion John as much as possible against the bedside table before standing. That was when a distinctly female groan reached Sherlock's ears; it seemed that Kate was finally waking. Sherlock then moved her into a sitting position against the vanity set as someone began pounding on the door. He bounded down the stairs, shouting to the police that he would get the door. As luck would have it, Greg was the one knocking.
“‘Course I am. What, did you think I was talking to someone else as pretty as you?” John was sporting a lopsided grin, and Sherlock felt his stomach doing some sort of aerial maneuver.
“John, you have been pursuing women since I have known you -” Sherlock started, but John shushed him quite loudly before overriding with his own thoughts.
Once they reached 221b, Lestrade parked, and the pair began to carry John into the flat. Normally, Sherlock would have suggested that Lestrade throw John over his shoulder or use a soldier's carry. But with John so out of it and the head injury, Sherlock didn't want to risk John waking violently and hurting his head again. So Lestrade had John by the armpits while Sherlock had him by the knees. Unfortunately, about halfway up the stairs, John woke and immediately began to struggle.
“Mmmm. 'S nice of yuh. Comfy too. Smell nice too.” John added as he cuddled closer to Sherlock and nosed at the tall man's hair, breathing it in. Sherlock stiffened. There was no way John really meant that.
“But did you ever notice that I was never heartbroken over them?” His flatmate asked, and Sherlock had to admit that was true. John would mope for roughly 8-12 hours, but that was all.
“Do you mind turning that thing off? Or changing the alert?” John finally snapped, staring moodily at the phone.
“And if I clear whatever else is on your plate?” John stopped eating again to give the phone a long, hard look before he pointedly ignored the device.
What he didn’t expect was for a calloused hand to slip in between his two. “Why would I want to forget that?”
“As long as the other doctors approve,” Sherlock conceded. He didn’t wish to push John too soon after surgery, albeit minor surgery.
John chuckled, blushing and looking down. “And that’s where the cat slips out.” He took a deep breath. “How could any man compare to you? You’re gorgeous, intelligent, talented.” John’s eyes caressed Sherlock’s face, tracing lines and features Sherlock realized John had long since memorized.
“Dammit,” he swore before his eyes caught on his coat, laying over John's chair. He grabbed at the coat, finding his phone in the wrong pocket. He'd received a text from a new number, obviously Ms. Adler's.
“Easy there, gorgeous. Don’t worry. It’ll all be fine. Just let me sleep for a little while. Then we’ll get back to chatting. I want to know more about you.” John mumbled before he drifted off to sleep again.
“Realized that Irene Adler broke into the flat and took back her phone,” Sherlock admitted flatly. John's face showed both of their disappointment.
“That will be all Lestrade,” Sherlock said, hoping his tone was dismissive enough to keep the Detective Inspector from arguing with him.
“Sher-” John cried out again, and something in Sherlock's gut twisted. He'd put John in danger twice in a matter of minutes. He had worked his mind palace overtime to make sure that the combination was right, and God his stomach clenched, trusting John to duck in time as the safe door swung open. Sherlock grabbed the railing harder, using that to propel him up four stairs at a time and still not sound like an elephant or, more importantly, give his position away.
“Irene Adler,” Sherlock replied. “Now help me carry him to your car. I can better treat him at the flat.” Greg nodded and walked over, and together they were able to carry John to Lestrade's squad car.
“Go ahead and hand me the phone,” Sherlock told John as he started to pull the phone from his loosening grasp. But as Sherlock gripped his wrist, John jerked awake, making several distressed noises before he pushed roughly against Sherlock, falling backwards and giving a pained groan.
“I glanced at her. No lasting injuries. Your men can interrogate her at your leisure. Irene Adler won't be showing her face for quite some time, and unless she talks someone into picking her up within the next few hours, you'll get everything you need from her. However, I need to take John back to 221b.” Lestrade finally turned his attention to their injured and unconscious friend.
In fact, if it weren’t for John’s numerous vehement objections to being placed in a relationship with Sherlock and the fact that he frequently screamed at everyone that he wasn’t gay, Sherlock would have thought his flatmate absolutely enamored with him. Perhaps Sherlock had misjudged something. Perhaps -
As a new thought hit Sherlock, he bounded out of the bedroom, heedless to the confused captain sitting on his bed. But as Sherlock grabbed his suit jacket from the kitchen table, he knew that the phone was already gone.
“John, you don't know what you're saying. You need to rest. You'll be better in the morning. You probably won't remember this.”
“John, John, it's me. I'm trying to help you. Irene is gone, but I need to get you out of here. Let me take the phone.” Sherlock leaned forward, raising John into a sitting position again. This time, when Sherlock held John's wrist, the phone slid from his grasp. And just in time, as Sherlock heard police sirens rounding the corner. “Here, let's at least make you a touch more presentable.” Sherlock grabbed the nearest disposable fabric, Irene's duvet in this case, and used it to clean the vomit from John's face.
“Drop it,” Sherlock barked, and Irene's head snapped up. She instantly took two steps closer to the rope, within easy reach.
Sherlock heard a noise as he turned around, followed by a thud. The voice was too low to be Irene's, and the lack of any noise after that confirmed his earlier hesitation: Irene had managed to surprise John. Without any delay, he dashed for the stairs.
“And if I said that I’d changed my mind? That I wasn’t in such a strict marriage to my Work? That I might wish to entertain someone else?” This was it. This was Sherlock putting his closely guarded heart out for John Watson’s examination. He didn’t know what he would do if John found him wanting, but he could no longer walk away from John. Not after he had said those words.
“You said that you were married to your work all that time ago. Why should I ever believe that I had a chance?”
“Either way, we can discuss this more tomorrow. Rest for now.” Seemingly satisfied, John settled back down to sleep.
“My apologies to you Mr. Holmes, and my congratulations to whomever is the lucky diner. I do wish I were in his shoes.” Sherlock smirked and rolled his eyes.
“True. Buh we always make it out.” John's eyes were drooping, and he was starting to show several signs of fatigue.
So Sherlock then carefully arranged himself on the bed, allowing a few pillows to cushion his back against the headboard, before curling John around him. This way, John ran no risk of choking on his vomit if threw up again, and he wasn't sleeping on any of his wounds.
“You make the most adorable pout when you sleep. Thanks for keeping my phone safe. ;)” Sherlock rolled his eyes and put toast in for both of them and set the kettle to boil. By the time John walked out of the bathroom, several of his welts uncovered, Sherlock had a functional breakfast for the both of them. Sherlock grabbed the paper and sat down as he glanced again at John. The doctor was fully awake by now.
“He'll sleep for a few hours. Don't worry; I've used it on loads of my friends,” she purred. John chose that moment to give a low groan before vomiting. “Make sure he doesn't choke on it. Makes for an unattractive corpse.” John wasn't moving. Was he unconscious? Sherlock leapt over the bed. John could choke if Sherlock didn't move him soon. As Sherlock pulled John into a sitting position, the other man collapsed against him, mumbling softly. Not unconscious then. Satisfied that John wasn't choking, Sherlock then looked back at the bathroom, unsurprised that Irene was already gone. He had his knighthood in the bag; her fate was the furthest thing from his mind. Speaking of, Sherlock reached towards John's left hand. Irene had scratched it up, several of the marks oozing blood, but his hand was still clutching the phone.
Sherlock thought. “I can leave the room if you wish to wake on your own,” he offered, attempting to be aloof and only vaguely interested in the answer.
“I remember what I said, and I said it all of my own volition. I meant it.” Sherlock knew John could feel the detective's breath on his finger. Sherlock was grateful the finger wasn't on his pulse point, else John would know how his heart leapt and galloped in his ribcage, unsure if he should hope or try to wake himself from what had to be a dream. “But I understand that you're married to your work. I will always respect that boundary. You are, first and foremost, my friend. I would not harm our relationship with my feelings.” If it was possible, Sherlock felt his heart swell at John's proclamation. That he would value Sherlock, a former-junkie-turned-detective, self-proclaimed sociopath, freak, and all-around ass, was more than Sherlock could dare for. That the army doctor loved him so fully was touching beyond words.
“Good, they sent someone competent. I know this isn't your typical precinct, so you can tell Mycroft I have the phone.” Greg turned to issue an order, so Sherlock paused. When he was sure he had Greg's attention again, he continued. “I can tell you my part of the story on the car ride home and at 221b, depending on how long it takes, but I need to head back there. Two of the four witnesses are up there. There are three Americans, one of whom is dead in the sitting room there. The third witness is on the run, but you wouldn't be able to get any additional information out of her,” Sherlock rattled off. Greg quickly sent more men to the sitting room while he and Sherlock went upstairs. When they reached their destination, Sherlock crossed back over to where John was. Fortunately, he hadn't moved, but Lestrade seemed more interested in making sure that Kate was unharmed.
But he had to hide this from Sherlock. The man teased his brother mercilessly, if he discovered that John actually liked eating and fattening himself up... he'd lose any chance he had.
John looks at Sherlock, wetting his lips as he notes the bulge in his master’s trousers now that he can see beneath that big soft belly.
Molly wasn’t the only one who took advantage of this new insight into Sherlock Holmes. One day when she was having lunch with Greg Lestrade, Molly let it slip that the key to managing Sherlock was a firm commanding reprimand followed by food. She had been giggling about it when she noticed that Greg suddenly looked thoughtful. Sure enough, the very next time Sherlock came in after visiting a crime scene, he was sporting powdered sugar around his lips and a full belly.
He settled in next to Greg, his huge gut rounding up next to the man. Sherlock leaned his curls into the Inspector's head, purring, his chubby cheeks soft and grease-stained.
His arse swelled and spread against the countertop. Nonexistent, flat bone becoming two softballs, then melons, then full blown, bubbly spheres of lard that wobbled and shook against the marble of 221b, pushing both men away from the counter as those cheeks rose up and over in, beach ball of an area indented by the hard, impassive stone.
Sherlock took the plate eagerly, gobbling up the food presented quickly to calm his nerves. His belly swelled, gurgling lightly in complaint, buttons spreading ever so slightly. He blushed behind his mask, a dark blue slash that only covered his eyes and a bit of his forehead, beautiful from a distance, but clearly thrown together from the discarded masks of noblemen and women outside the castles walls
"You really ought to have used the pig's blood you know," said a voice in the darkness behind the detective. It seemed to shiver and swirl, then solidify into the form of a man with glowing blue eyes. But it didn't stop there. The dark shape expanded... it swelled.
"You should watch this again, on your own time, then we'll have both seen it four times, compare mental notes," he said, trying to get the tape away from him. He shouldn’t have taken the blasted thing. He was Sherlock Holmes! No sex, no masturbation, no food - no nothing!
John groaned, pressing his belly into Sherlock's hand, his eyes fluttering as he took a big bite, then another and another as he felt the man teasing him.
" There’s a small huffing of breath and a hard thud, then the sound of a small cry as something holding a tray falls over.
He set the video playing and sat back, tugging a blanket over him. He watched, fascinated, stuffing more food into his mouth. His stomach filled gradually, swelling up against his trousers.
The blue eyes didn't even deign to roll. "Your Moran iz not immune, either you know," the soft low voice murmurs, "It's only a madder of time. Den you see what he's hungry for."
As John approaches it to search for bullets the music starts to play again, and Sherlock is having smaller and small moments of lucidity regarding "big" and "little" Sherlock. Without thinking, the detective latches his mouth around one of the jets and swallows continuously, his belly steady rounding out until, whimpering around the funnel's mouth, Sherlock regains the sense to pull off of it, gasping, and runs back over to John, stomach round and overfilled yet again.
John was below him, it would only make sense to go down them. There’s a small puzzle at the doorway - as if the house is testing him. Sherlock smirks and looks at it. It’s honestly quite simple, childish. He moves a few chocolaty pieces around and expects the door to open.
Sherlock giggled at the oinking, hoping one day he'd be able to make his always-in-control Captain squeal, pressing a bit faster, with a bit more purpose as John gobbled up his greasy treats. As the last fry passed through his lover's lips he looked over John's form, purring with contentment as he leaned in to kiss him.
"Thank you," he murmured, leaning down to kiss John's cheek above his beard. "That's...no one's ever been so nice to me, John. I...I don't know how I got so lucky." The curly haired man said, eyes soft as his looked upon the doctor's face.
The hard wailing shifts to soft sobs, then quiet tears. Sherlock giggles a little when John gives his belly a kiss. He looks into John’s eyes, and there’s no remainder of detective there.
"Not really," grunted Greg, still pinned on his back. He burped again and scratched his belly. "We're hungry."
He thought about a lazy Sherlock, spending his days stretched out on the sofa, maybe eating some ice cream or some treats, calling for John to bring him more... finding him fatter every day he came home from work, that round belly softening and poking out between the man's pajamas.
Sherlock’s eyes dart to it, his mind starting to go fuzzy. He wobbles after John as the doctor leads the way about the room. The giggle comes again, and as the two of them reach the head of the table, there’s another tape, this one from the documentary crew.
"Sherlock, stay here with me," John says firmly, hoping that he’ll somehow be able to guide the man. "Sherlock, do you have the other tape player still?" John takes it and picks up the new tape, pressing it in, rewinding and then playing it. John can't help but be curious about this place. Surely it couldn't be all Moriarty...
"You should have seen your face though, you looked so happy, love," John murmured, grinning and leaning into his lover, "I didn't get it all the way wrong then..."
"Of course you can," John growled, his pulse rising at Sherlock's eagerness. "Bring some cookies along if you want me even bigger... would you like that?"
"John, you did this to me. Made me so fat. So round. Made me *yours*" He  purred, leaning forward and sinking his teeth into John's neck.
The detective beamed, nodding wildly and extending his hand for John to put the ring on, then tugging the doctor up by his coat, the seams audibly straining, and pulling him into a crushing, passionate kiss
The sex is the best John has ever had. He can’t contain his moans nor his belches as Sherlock fucks him hard, fast, and deep. The detective’s massive belly crashes against his back like waves on a beach, breaking him apart just as much as the cock buried in him. Sherlock’s harsh hot breaths are at his neck, those large hands alternating between rubbing his swollen overfull middle and pumping John’s huge hard cock. John has never felt more complete in his life. He is filled. Stuffed. Surrounded. Utterly his.
Sherlock's eyes went wide as he muffled another belch. He willingly accepted the still mostly full bottle however and raised it to his lips, throwing his head back and chugging down even more. John rubbed the man's belly as he drank, imagining that he could feel the skin stretching under his fingers. The bulge was growing rather hard now, Sherlock's belly swelling out beautifully, growing round and heavy. John slid his finger into the navel again, finding the walls stretched and much more shallow now that Sherlock was being filled.
"Don't you?" Teased John, grinning and lowering himself to kiss and mouth at Sherlock's round bloated middle.
“I’m afraid my dear Gregory is much the same,” Mycroft adds fondly, now striding towards the DI and cupping his chubby cheek in his fat fingers. “Such a plump spoiled thing you’ve become.”
"Spring roll?" Sherlock asked, lifting one delicately in his long, elegant fingers, his voice too deep and too gruff. John looked up, still chewing. His eyes flicked from Sherlock to the offered food, then back again. Then he leaned forward and engulfed it in one bite.
"Oh, she was looking for a Rutherford. I swear the people who go to these bars must have the cruelest parents," said John, getting perilously close to a giggle fit.
"Well done," said John, moving closer and rubbing at Sherlock's distended tummy carefully, probing it with his fingers and finding it delightfully springy. "More."
"Yes. The man behind the blog," Mr. Holmes said, nodding and giving his son a wink. "Glad Sherlock has someone to look after him with everything he gets up to"
John feels his heart hammer, but he shakes his head, squares his shoulders. "You're just another trick, Moran. You got locked up. Dishonorable discharge."
And so he did. He fed John the last of the half dozen spring rolls as the man plowed through what must have been nearly a pound of noodles. He watched John's belly grow and swell, rounding out and forcing his jumper further up his chest. The faint lines of his abdominal muscles were gone, stretched into a bloated ball of a gut thanks to the doctor's gluttony. Sherlock watched John's hand explore the new curve with jealousy, his own fingertips itching to probe the mass for himself. But he resisted. He doubted John would be amiable to his touch. Instead he found his friend a drink to make all those noodles go down more easily. John did appreciate that. He gulped down the soda and let out a long belch that seemed to rattle the dishes in their cupboards.
John kissed back, chuckling at his lover's eagerness. He sighed happily, watching him rush off, bare-arsed.
Before Sherlock can do or say anything her mouth is on his, her hands unbuttoning the shirt at the detective’s waist, probing  his soft tummy.
The second is a group of seven twenty-something-year-olds, all male again aside from one girl at the very end, all essentially fit and strong, or thin and wiry, holding bits of camera equipment or microphones - a documentary team perhaps. The man in the middle sassily poses a tape recorder to his mouth, and he’s the only one among them that’s chubby - looking about twenty or so pounds overweight
"I'm... glad," Sherlock murmured, ducking his head down to snog John properly against the side of the cab.
Sherlock froze in the doorway. Trapped by fear and lust, he walked in almost against his better judgment. John was truly massive. Sherlock’s hands itched to explore every inch of his massive, flowing form. So hard and dangerous, so soft and pliant. He was handsome, almost devilishly so, and Sherlock’s first instinct was to suck in his fat little tummy, but to no avail.
“My apologies,” he said, dipping his head, before getting back to business. John folded his arms, frown deepening. Greg gave him a smile and a thumbs up. John returned the smile rather stiffly.
John jumps as Greg slides a warm palm over his middle. He flushes, stuttering around the doughnut in his own mouth.
"But nothing. Why? Have any notes to compare?" Sherlock smiled, looking to his brilliant John with warm eyes, wishing he could take off that damned corset and start fingering his navel before his exploded from arousal right there.
"Yeah I know, I happen to love it though. Call this a compromise," John called back, just pulling a batch of freshly baked gingerbread from the oven and setting it out to cool. He slipped off his oven mitts and chuckled. "Just be thankful there isn't any Christmas music on too."
"O-ow! Jawn, oww!"  he groans, "Make it stop! Plea-please make it stop!" Sherlock tries to throw up again, but nothing comes out, some part of the magic of the house keeping food in the detective’s massively overfilled tummy.
"You...you came. This...it doesn't make sense, you came and-" Sherlock looked under the tree, brain nearly imploding as it counter the number of gifts there.
He chuckled low in his throat and his massive belly hopped and bounced. His eyes trailed hungrily over the younger man's body, softly swollen with an easy, rich life. Decadent softness just where he liked it. Soft. Biteable.
That prediction proved true as the years found John growing steadily rounder and softer. They were married now, and decidedly domestic. John wouldn't have pictured his life ending up like this before he met Sherlock, but well, he had met Sherlock. And now this was perfection, lounging on the sofa with his lover and dutifully eating whatever little morsel he was offered.
He let out a squeal at his ass being slapped, then a moan, "D-do that again" He asked, suddenly blushing
Sherlock coughed lightly, moving to settle back down at the table and crossing his legs. Why was the thought of such a heavier John so... arousing? He sipped at his tea, his color returning to normal.
John jump as the intercom comes on again, that maniac taunting him. If there's one thing John knows, it's not to trust James Moriarty. He takes the fork and tries to gouge a hole in the wall, but the gingerbread seems only to puff up more, filling in the space as soon as he’s made it.
"Ooh... personal information that. I have met both. lucky you. Though this answer will require two courses."
"Oh for God's sake," John breathes, but he knows the man can't help it, so he just reaches over to pull Sherlock close, keep him out of trouble.
"Oh Christ, I thought I was going to explode," John chuckled, groaning as his belly jostled with the motions of his laughter.
His voice is hard and hardly the doctor’s own. John shakes his head, feeling his pulse pounding in his ears. "We-we need to get out," John repeats.
"Haven't I earned dessert? Hmm? Something sweet to fill me out? Or will you just keep. Asking. Questions." He growled, kissing along the detective's neck.
Jim cackled, "Send in the rest of the boxes, and have two sent in to the staff room, I’ve a feeling some other little pigs will be wanting more snacks too" He snuggled against his body guard, letting his eyes close for a moment. Who knew it would be this easy to win?
"Something for me to grow into?" Sherlock jokes, moving the doctor’s hand to rest on his opposite hip, and slipping his own hand down to rest on John’s.
"Good," said John, smiling and popping one into his own mouth, his slightly softened jawline shifting with his chewing motions. "There's plenty to go around. I was about to make tea. "
He collapsed for a moment onto his massive - or, now, equally sized - lover, moaning happily, kissing at the man's flabby shoulders
John keeps his gaze steady and confident even as his heart pounds. There's another scuttle of bug feet nearby.
He stood and fetched a blanket, then plopped down on the sofa and slouched back, throwing half of it towards Sherlock. He grunted, stomach sloshing, as he reached for the remote, then started flipping through channels.
"Oh, yeah. Good idea," said John, nodding and drying off his hands. Alright. Maybe he would need to see it again. Figure something out-figure the case out. Yeah.
Sherlock eyes the chair at the head of table, watching it visibly expand and shift, matching a size that… a size that looks like it was made for him.
"Sorry, love," John replied with a chuckle. Sherlock was warm, seeming only to grow warmer as he gained a bit of weight. He looked beautiful. The picture of health. But still, as they had discussed, he could always do with a little more.
Sherlock's eyes flicked over his flatmate, dangerously close to forgetting to breathe again as he took in just how
"You are beautiful," John growled, rutting against him so that his weight jiggled and shook, "Fuck, you are gorgeous. Perfect. Pristine."
He can feel Sherlock chuckling against him, causing his massive soft belly to quake against him. John realizes he has leaked through his pants. And pajama bottoms. He flushes but Sherlock only catches his mouth with his own and ruts into him, practically fucking John with his belly, slowly, rhythmically, brutally.
He crosses to John, not entirely sensing the danger in the air, too focused on the frightful image before him. Sherlock sniffs the small pond of tea - drugged.
“Yours,” he belches, breathing shallowly before snatching the pitcher from Sherlock’s fingers and tipping it back greedily for every last drop. “All yours. Your huurp fat hog!”
“I- Yes.” John nods, swallowing the ‘sir’ before it can escape him. He goes to collect new clothes for himself, mind still in a heady daze. He doesn’t notice his reflection as he pulls out a fresh pair of pants and jeans, doesn’t see that the briefs are hugging his arse rather tightly, nor that a handsome muffin top spills over his waistband after he struggles to do them up, nor that his middle and chest seem to jiggle as he tugs a jumper down over his head. He doesn’t even notice that his jumper now rounds out where it once skimmed over flat abs. What John does notice, is that he’s feeling rather peckish.
John doesn't want to mention Moriarty's taunting, he can’t, so he simply settles on: "I don't think we should wake them."
"Sounds good," said John grinning, "Maybe the cookies you put out weren't his favorite so he was full by the time he came to your house."
"Mm, thanks. Wanna rub? Hurp-Hurts a bit," John mumbled, snatching at Sherlock's hand the next moment and pressing it against his gut. Sherlock felt himself trembling. He swallowed and slowly began caressing the tightly stretched skin. John's belly. John's warm overstuffed perfect-
Greg cried out wildly as he came, fingers digging into the desk, into Sherlock's scalp, anything to keep himself standing as he shuddered.
"No shifts today?" he asked, feeling companionable. The angry, rude Sherlock seemed to have vanished under so many layers of soft cream, with the detective admitting to not only having friends, but needing them
"Yeah, you did, Sherlock. God, how did that even fit?" he murmurs, just glad to have the man safe. At least for now. "You're amazing." John gives him a bit more of a squeeze. "Saved my life, too. Got us out of that scrap. You're bloody brilliant."
John smiled and followed after. He collapsed with a low groan and wriggled out of his clothing. He hoped Sherlock's drunkenness would also mean that the man would be liable to sleep in.
"Quiet!" Moran snaps, and  Sherlock stops talking, but his mouth hangs open. He licks his lips at the offering of more food. It isn’t fair, it’s like offering a kilo to a crack addict.
"No, you're right about that," he admitted, kissing his lover's cheek, "His belly's supposed to be all round and jolly isn't it?" He settled into Sherlock, just relaxing and thinking. The thought formed without John even realizing where it had come from.
"And you are mine*" Sherlock growled, roughly spinning John around, giving the man's massive arse a loud *SLAP*
"Just look at us, John" he said, moving closer to the doctor, walking his fingers across the girth of John's waist, his love handles, his over hand grasping a handful of his own creamy gut and shaking it.
"I-I...I haven't been with a man since university. And I admit I was less...cushioned then." Sherlock flushed, grabbing his fat tummy, giving it a soft jiggle, the buttons of his waistcoat creaking at the movement.
The detective’s eyes light up, and he stomps hard on the floor - then sees John look up on the screen.
The boys share a couple of large pizzas and continue to attempt to hide their new gains from each other.
The detective turns, taking  John’s  hand again, and presses his soft, wide hip into his doctor.  They walk off together toward God knows where.
"M-more... food?" John repeated, his pupils blowing wide as he took in the great expanse of white bloated skin and fat before him. He chuckled and stepped closer, giving in to his urge to poke, and prod, and squeeze.
As it happened, Sherlock did arrive at the morgue the next morning to apologize. Molly had to do her best not to blush as she accepted it. Before long however, Sherlock was back to his old tricks, trying to get yet another liver or gallbladder out of her. Now once or twice she could write it off as a fluke, but twice in one week?
Sherlock's lungs were burning. He realized he'd been holding his breath and so he let it out in a long stream.
The detective’s  mind is clear, the music  is gone, and he laughs so hard his round, soft tummy is shaking and a bouncing on his thighs, his wide hips, pressed against  John’s, wobbling and jiggling against him.
"None of that," the doctor admonishes, smacking Sherlock’s  frosting-coated hand and then looking at the book.
John was. The ex-army doctor kept himself in shape. He was fit under those jumpers as Sherlock had observed upon bursting into his flatmate's room one morning to drag him off to a case. But now... there was a definite rounding there beneath the jumper. The fabric seemed to tug and crease, highlighting what could only be described as a
He looked over Greg's nude from, his belly spilling forward, hanging slightly onto his chubby cock, love handles pouring out his side. Jesus, did he want to feel that pressure on his he sucked that man's thick member
"Yeah me too, but I didn't... notice anything odd. Shame though," said John, his eyes lingering on Sherlock maybe a bit longer than usual. He quickly looked back at the telly.
John’s initial relief at seeing the detective has long worn off. The tape only confirms what he’d feared. Oh God, no.
“Greg,” John answers, smiling and accepting a creamy cup of coffee from the man. Honestly, he wasn’t sure why he had insisted on drinking it black all these years. “Thanks, mate! Did you get some of those new maple bacon doughnuts I asked for?”
"Really though. Well done." He might as well be honest if they’re going to die in here. John steps cautiously forward. There's still faint scuttling, but its owner seems small or far off.
John is going to have the great Sherlock Holmes as his own personal prize pig, oozing out of his suits, sharp features buried in fat, cold eyes gone warm and demure with thousands of calories and laziness. He digs his fingers into Sherlock’s middle, rubbing it eagerly until Sherlock lets out a long wet belch.
For some odd reason, that seemed to make the detective's heart swell. He looked over at John, his eyes still wandering, gathering data. He'd borrowed some of Sherlock's shampoo again, clearly. John, as ever, didn't notice. He was looking around the bar at the other patrons. His gaze paused now and again, but it didn't linger anywhere. None his type? This was growing increasingly irksome.
He waved from the kitchen window as John went by, almost instantly unbuttoning his shirt and shedding his trousers, moving to the fridge and taking out the chocolate cake he'd hidden behind a wall of sauces an jams
By the fifth cinnamon bun, Sherlock feels nauseous, and by the seventh he’s in pain. He never eats this much, hasn’t in his entire life, his trim stomach bloated to a hard dome under his tight shirt. Another tape begins to play over the intercom.
He looked over, finding one, tiny chunk of doughnut next to him. He picked it up, about to bring it to his lips, then rolled over, letting the fit soldier rest on his massive gut
"Hrrmph, hardly," Sherlock replied, patting his belly. It let out a dull thud of a smack. "My capacity's been increasing. Along with my appetite. And... various other-"
"What? Sherlock? The man's a railing! And even if he weren't," said John, taking a step closer, "I'd be a touch politer if I were you."
"Hm... I think so yeah," he murmured, kissing him gently, "I like having a bit more weight I can throw around. And if you like it... well. I think I can gain as much as I like."
"It doesn't... not at all. Sherlock... God, Sherlock come here," he said, almost launching himself across the bed, belly jiggling with the swiftness of his movement. He kissed the detective hard.
Sherlock shivered as John said 'gluttony', the very sound of it on the doctor lips was something he would finish to for days after, but for now, Sherlock was obsessed with downing a pizza with his lov-with John
They managed to waddled over to the desk, which Sherlock leaned over, knees able to relax as he leaned onto it, belly squashing lightly against it, ass wide and open in the air behind him
"Hmmph, I'm going to, don't you worry, Fatty," John chuckled, giving that tantalizing arse another good slap as it jiggled in his face. He growled and buried his face in it a moment. Then he straightened. "Greg do you-"
Sherlock hummed, hefting his belly in his hands as John scribbled down the new number. He let it drop as John fetched the tape measure. They would need to find a new one soon.
The ex army doctor’s, the soldier’s, new adversaries are scuttling over the candy furniture, squeaking and clicking, their jaws open and menacing. John takes aim. And fires.
"Yeah, yeah," said John, waving a hand impatiently, "M'hurp- drunk. Still. I like it too." He patted his belly and winked. Then he hefted himself up again, with a loud moan that made Sherlock shiver.
"Did you ever get anything out of that tape?" he asked, the thought striking him for the first time since... well. Wow. The kink discovery had completely driven that from his mind. "I didn't see anything unusual."
Sherlock opens his mouth a little wider, a look of sheer horror in his eyes as he is unable to stop himself.
“Sorry, my- Sherlock’s calling me,” John says, bobbing his head to Greg and seizing another three doughnuts before rushing off to Sherlock’s side. He catches a glimpse of that same smile on Greg’s face again as he hurries off but he doesn’t waste time contemplating it this time.
“Good,” Sherlock rumbles into his ear with every thrust of his hips and tug of John’s cock, “You earned this. You ate yourself so round for me. So fat.  My fat little piggy, John.”
"Baron Watson. But you may call me John. Despite your name definitely not being added to the list," he purred, dipping his head to trail his lips over Sherlock's knuckles. The urge to bite was stronger than it had been in years. He was so hungry. So thirsty. So wanting. Only interesting lives made for satisfying meals.
"I'll get some more cookies! Don't move!" He cheered, given John one last, deep snog before dashing from the room
Mrs. Holmes served each of them a hefty slice of the sticky pie and poured them each a cup of coffee.
He gazed at John, love in his eyes, "I-that day...with the toast. That was the best day of my life, and I...I love you, John. I loved you thin and I love you now. I-I hope that doesn't...ruin the heat of the moment,” he murmured, moving a finger to toy with his navel, causing his gut to ripple and quake.
Sherlock swallowed as Greg came, hot and thick, into his mouth, sucking man clear, feeling his stomach swell every-so slightly as he did
John drew nearer and set his shopping bags down, then he slipped a hand onto that lovely pale middle, his fingers pressing lightly, exploring this new little addition to his lover.
"Even criminals get in the holiday spirit, eh?" chuckled John, eating steadily and sighing as he set about filling his stomach again. He did a double take.
He sipped at his tea, "Another cuppa?" He smiled, wondering how much it would take before his flat mate was sloshing
It's almost terrifyingly bright. Spots dance in front of John’s eyes and he can't see a thing. The soldier crouches down, hoping his eyes will adjust soon, but the spots seem to linger.
He was essentially naked and three times the size he used to be, sitting in front of a platter of chocolate crumbs. A wave of terror swept through him, taking his mind with it, so all he could think to say was
"N-n" Is all John manages to choke as Sherlock starts eating. He watches helplessly as the detective’s stomach fills and bloats yet again. John closes his eyes. God, he can't believe Sherlock is doing that on his account. He hates it. John should be protecting
He cleared his throat and crossed one leg over the other, his foot jiggling, his arms folded over his firm, hard, chest and abs, features he had worked to maintain after the army.
At last, John couldn't eat another bite. He fell back in his chair, trying to take some of the pressure off his stomach. He tried to breath shallowly, doing his best to suck in his massively overfull middle. He tugged at his shirt, now wishing that he had gone with his usual jumper rather than the button up that was now pulling tightly around his belly.
The ex-army doctor chuckles as well, tucking his head into Sherlock’s neck a minute to muffle his own laughter. Then he perches his chin on Sherlock’s  soft shoulder again, rocking them gently.
Sherlock cries harder, sniffling and weeping, and the rest of the bunnies make mocking noises and giggle. The chocolate bunny opens his mouth and sticks its head inside.
He was delivered quickly to Scotland Yard, and had to glare hard at several officers who eyed his puzzle hungrily
"Why...why don’t we just watch crap telly all day?" he offered, brain swirling as it imagined a much lazier, no-more-running John filling up their sofa. One day of memories and sitting about wouldn’t make his perfect John a perfect hog, but Sherlock could pretend it would, and they really hadn’t seen much of each other lately.
There is a panel in this room, one that opens a door. Sherlock scans the room and finds it almost immediately. He snaps out of his mind palace, sugar and saccharine happiness still pumping through him. He looks at John, seeing only animalistic rage as the soldier beats a bunch of monstrous imps.
"Bored," He proclaims with a sip, "Don't you have something else to throw at them? Something that'll kill them faster? I wasn't planning to spend all day here you know. Ooh, I know!" Jim leans forward with a grunt to turn on the intercom.
Her eyes prickling furiously, tears welling, threatening to spill over at any moment, Molly turned in a swirl of white lab coat and shoved past John into the hallway. She bolted to her office and locked the door behind her. She threw herself into her desk chair, had a bit of a sniffle and kicked her trash bin a few times until she calmed down. Molly drew a deep breath and blew her nose, then righted the bin she had knocked over and straightened her lab coat. It was just Sherlock, after all. And she could have performed a necropsy on Toby but that just didn’t seem important. He had been getting on in years. And Molly was a very good pathologist.
The detective sits down next to a marshmallow tent and plants his hands to his hand, struggling to just get back to Sherlock, the rude, crass, asshole detective.
A glance at Sherlock showed him that the other man wasn't fairing much better. Every so often Sherlock's shoulders would hitch or jump as his stomach lurched with another hiccup. Sherlock compensated by gulping down coffee between more bites of the pie. This, naturally, did not help matters. John noticed that Sherlock was saying very little and often brought his fist to his mouth to muffle a burp or belch as the detective's now almost perfectly round stomach gurgled. It was pure torture, both to be unable to touch that perfect plump belly and to keep eating that delicious pie. John had never been more aroused in his life.
"And four times?" John repeated, eyeing the tape mistrustfully. He bit his lip. The whole thing... "Okay. We can make notes and investigate. Stuff." He wandered to the kitchen and put the kettle on.
"Let's see if we can't find any more breadcrumbs. And Sherlock, for the love of God, don't eat anything else." With that, John leads Sherlock off a different corridor, eyes trained on the ground. The scuttle follows. The army doctor thinks about stopping to take it out, but perhaps he can use it if Sherlock recedes back under the house's spell.
As John rubs he can almost feel the pressure go down, belly softening, and starting to ripple lightly under his hands. Sherlock is relieved when it seems to be helping. It doesn't seem to be going away though. The detective swallows in shock as his own hands sink into soft fat. Oh God...
"I've...I've thought about this for a long time...If you aren’t ready we can, can just rub bellies but I-" Sherlock swallowed, "I would like us to make love...at...some point." His face went beet red.
"That hit and run case last year, you pulled me out of the street. I was too lost in thought to notice anything, but you always remember me," Sherlock murmured as the spy seduced another femme fatal, Sherlock sneaking his third slice.
Sherlock watched John through their kitchen window as he left for his run, this morning only affirming how utterly besotted he was with the gorgeous doctor, cleaning up the kitchen and removing his carton of chocolate ice cream from the freezer, downing massive spoonfuls of the creamy, fatty treat as he did the dishes, then called the pizzeria, agreeing to their two for one special. He wondered if John could eat an entire pizza, flushed, and finished the carton much faster than he originally thought he would.
"Seems as good of an excuse as any," Sherlock replied blithely. "I've been trying to escape Mycroft for decades after all."
He glutted and gorged, his hands hungrily gripping John's belly, mouth kissing roughly back to John's between toes of rich cheesecake, warm pie
Everything appears to be made of sweets. Sherlock extends a long arm and pokes a finger into the 'frosting' on the televison, only to find it actually
He imagined those fingers feeding him as John's, imagined his body spilling further and further across the bed as his gut arched up into the air.
Sherlock burps and groans as John hoists him up and they stumble into the next room, the door shutting behind , a few muffled screams still coming through.
"Oh, John... I may have had a bit too much to-John?" he asked, flipping open the blankets and staring at the empty space he found there.
"Magnificent. Oh fuck, I knew you were special, that you were different, that you were the very epitome of want."
John hummed, almost growled, and fell upon the food with a voracious hunger. The noises he made as he stuffed down the bruschetta were indecent, as if he were fucking rather than eating. He moaned and groaned, grunting, his cheeks bulging as he stuffed in more and more. He sucked his fingers clean lewdly and turned shining eyes onto Sherlock. "Next. Question." he purred, taking two steps and crushing Sherlock up against the kitchen counter with his belly. This was fun. and the genitalia of fae wasn't exactly expensive information. He was getting quite the deal.
He pulled a cake over and tore it in half, feeding himself with one hand and proffering the other to Sherlock's lips.
Sherlock fared no better, having settled down beside the man, their fat sides quickly squashing further and further against one another. His buttons had flown off rapidly, one after the other, after the finishing of his ninth helping. His wide, pale gut billowed out in front of his, pants button long gone, and zipper snapped by the surge of flesh that occurred so quickly. His chest had ballooned out in soft, supple breasts, which rested lightly on his massive gut.
"Mm, yeah, day off," John replied, smiling and settling in comfortably. "Just a lazy day at home. I suppose I might go for a run in a bit, though." He had another piece of toast.
"Best be careful, yeah?" John says, eyeing the place dubiously. "Don't touch anything. Let's just see if there's another door."
He’s standing - a soldier's posture, strong biceps filling the arms of his jumper. He’s looking about, shrewdly, attempting to discern just where he is. The room in which our hero’s flat-mate stands appears to have one door - large and ornate...again gingerbread - in the back of the room, it’s too dark for John to see without a bit of exploration, but with the contrast on Sherlock’s television he’s able to observe it.
"Well, can't say I mind... would be a shame if I didn't get to talk to a pretty thing like you," he purred.
Sherlock almost exploded at John's comment, slowing feeding him the slice, almost whimpering at the very mention of those words.
"You okay?" John asked, still rubbing and pressing gently at Sherlock's middle. The detective nodded and removed his hand to speak but all that came out was yet another loud burp. Sherlock flushed. John only laughed and rubbed more purposefully.
Sherlock stepped closer, cautiously as if approaching a wild animal. John was certainly eating like one. The man in question paused for a moment, let out a monstrous wet burp and gave his belly a hearty slap before downing the rest of his milk. The detective found himself biting the inside of his cheek. He quickly sat down before John could notice his friend's new interest in the proceedings.
“I’ve tried to,” Sherlock answers, reemerging from the kitchen with a truly massive cake and setting it down on the coffee table with a grunt amongst the other treats piled high there. He meets John’s gaze and adds, “Captain Watson is just too much of a hog to be taught much of anything. Besides eating of course. And napping…”
“Sherlock, we’ve talked about this,” said Greg, his tone colored with just the right amount of disappointment, “How are you supposed to question friends and family of the deceased?”
Ah, Sherlock. Sherlock’s here now with a drink. John gulps the thick milkshake from the huge pitcher that Sherlock pours down his throat. John obediently sits back on his haunches, gulping it as fast as Sherlock gives it to him, his belly swelling towards his knees, growing almost absurdly round.
The frosting flies off Sherlock’s hand and he blushes, putting the book back, but still wondering what the dozens of others are filled with.
"Mmmm," He purred, snuggling in closer, further under John's girth, heart pounding as he heard the mattress creak beneath their weight. Beneath John.
John smiled and slipped the ring onto Sherlock's finger, then chuckled into their kiss before it left him breathless.
Sherlock and John still left some of Mary's things around the flat, her set of cookware in the kitchen for instance as she had been scandalized to see the meager collection John had managed to keep from Sherlock's experiments. Her favorite books were still on the shelves and her picture stayed on their bedside table, smiling encouragingly for them to get on with their lives. Mary had helped bring them together. Sherlock and John owed her immensely for that.
“Yeah… yeah,” John gasped between pants. His hands moved down to undo Sherlock’s trousers, then he shoved his own aside impatiently. “Lube.” He grunted.
He rocked his hips, his flab moving in waves, crashing into the human. His mouth found those perfect plush lips. He kissed hard, desperately, moaning at the decadence he tasted on him. The hunger and desire feeding him further.
He lifted and arm, letting his weight rest on his other and his round, fat gut, cupping Greg's chubby cheek in his, "I...Jesus Greg, take off your pants." He growled, then squealed as John worshipped his enormous, fat arse, moaning as the soft flesh was marked by his lover
John tugs Sherlock with him, intending to run down a small narrow hall that looks as though it has a door at the end.
“Oh? And what are our guests going to eat?” John teased, mouthing gently at Sherlock’s soft jawline.
John made a small noise of agreement. He shifted under the blanket, wishing he could undo his shapewear and his trousers and just let it all hang out, pat and play with his chubby gut, feel it in his palms.
"What did you stuff this suit with? It feels...it feels very real," Sherlock said, voice going a bit husky as he stroke the suits velvet sides.
Then he crowded into Sherlock, kissing him hard and pushing him back down onto the bed. He practically pinned the man the the mattress with his new gut, pressing his weight onto the slimmer but softening detective.
"No. They've got a single cock, but it's a two-pronged one. Food. Then ask your next question," John murmured, slipping a finger along Sherlock's prominent cheekbone. "Your body will be mine. And your questions will be ended when I'm full. Lucky for you. I'm quite bottomless." He chuckled and slapped his gut. It rippled.
Moriarty glowers at them both with rage, he's clearly attempting to stand, but doesn't seem able to. His thighs trapped and immobilized in trousers too small, a heavy arse making it nigh impossible for him to move anywhere.
“Well, best let them get some exercise in that case,” Sherlock says crisply. John looks up to find his lover tugging his jumper off over his head. He does his best to help, gulping and shifting a bit as Sherlock shoves his pants out of the way as well. He’s already hard. Sherlock smirks, cupping his erection in one hand and kissing him. John whimpers and presses up into him, desperate for more, but Sherlock withdraws. There is a clink and John feels soft rolled leather against his skin as he is collared.
"Oh, wow, bacon, sausage and pepperoni?" chuckled John, "Scratch that, maybe I will get fat off today." He smiled, hoping that Sherlock didn't notice the note of longing, or the thrill that shot through him at that greasy pizza being offered to him. He leaned forward and took a big bite. It was amazing.
"What!? No! No!" Sherlock desperately tipped the box over, running his fingers over the crumbs that feel out and sucking them desperately
"Oi! You talking about Sherlock?" John demanded, crossing his arms and stalking up to the two of them. Anderson dropped his gaze, but Donovan folded her arms, smiling uncertainly.
John feels his jaw drop. It's like... Candyland. That shitty game Harry always wanted to play when they were kids. Everything in the room seemed to be composed of some sort of sugar or sweet. A delectable smell of baking gingerbread fills the doctor’s nose, but eating is the last thing on his mind just now.
"That...makes sense. In a way. Yzram was drowned in the deprivation chamber, whip marks across his back. But...
Seeing John in danger seems to shake Sherlock just a bit out of his 'little' headspace, but he keeps on the innocent mask. Only on, and  the pair of frightful eyes watching the screen next to the bloated criminal recognize what the detective is doing.
"Sherlock!" John bellows as the man is wrenched from his grasp, he tries to go after the detective, but is stopped.
"Jesus!" John mutters, shivering at the thing. Whatever it was. He has a strong urge to just fire a shot so that it stays hidden. He catches Sherlock’s gaze.
"I took the liberty of inviting Greg over for Christmas, I assumed it was alright with you," Sherlock smiled, "I should've checked, though, did you want Harry coming? I know things are still a bit rough in her social life"
Greg grunted and tried to roll onto his side, huffing and reaching with thickened fingers for his next carton.
John smirked and led the way, shedding off the slightly ridiculous suit along the way until he was just in a pair of tightly stretched red pants. The band dug into his hips hard, creating blooming love handles that rolled and shifted as he walked. John's belly was really starting to sag now. He demonstrated that as he waited by the bed for Sherlock to set the things down. He lifted and rubbed it lightly, trailed a finger in his navel.
One of Sherlock's eyes slid open. "Mm... nor I you," he rumbled, reaching over to prod at John's belly with two fingers.
The detective’s torso is still firm and his stomach is still taut... at the top. But the man’s lower belly is soft, and in this kneeling position, Sherlock can feel his usually bony bottom squish softly against his heels, his thickening thigh pressing together
Sherlock nearly fell into Greg as he stood, their massive, nude forms shaking and quivering into one another, belly squashing and jiggling as the both leaned in, their soft chests bouncing
Tears roll down Sherlock’s face as each remarks stabs into the detective’s heart, but he’s worried John’ll get mad again, so he looks down and tries to sob as quietly as he can.
Sherlock smiled and stuffed down another large mouthful of the green bean casserole. He passed John another beer, eyes trailing down the man's body fondly, noting that the gorgeous roundness was returning to the doctor's middle. John grunted as he shifted forward to take it, then loaded a third plate to the edges before eating with just as much gusto.
"John!" Sherlock shouts, his tone still scared, but not of the creatures, of his doctor. The music is still pounding in the detective’s head, but he’s overcoming it, his will strong now that he has something to really think for – John.
John moaned loudly, the sound swallowed as Sherlock kissed him and he kissed him back desperately, pressing into Sherlock, feeling all that full fat weight against him.
"'lo," yawned Sherlock, shifting so that he could sit up a bit more. His belly, soft, pale, and round slid onto his thighs, the covers slipping down to reveal two soft pectorals and thickly padded shoulders. He was so warm now, always comfortable, and the fact that John enjoyed this as well, that the doctor caressed him so gently, so reverently... Well, Sherlock should have gotten fat a long time ago. Pity really. He had missed out on quite a lot of excellent cakes and sweets in the past.
John moans as he is slammed against the bathroom wall, his hands pinned by two fat massive palms, a mountain of a gut keeping his hips pinned helplessly, two massive tits jiggling in his face. John keens, desperate to catch one of those pink nipples in his mouth.
“I might order some Thai, want any?" the normally not-hungry detective said, shucking off his coat and hanging it up as he walked into 221b. He took out the tape and tossed it onto the sofa.
The test tubes and beakers are much too large and bubbling and boiling with the smell of fresh baked cherry and blueberry pie - their extremely obnoxious colors of bright blue and red giving off the opposing scents - which makes the childish part of him only want to giggle harder.
Sherlock gasped and moaned as John prepared him, having to bury his face into a pillow as John hefted his massive belly onto him.
"No, you did that. Thought you were supposed to be my friend," said John, sitting back with a sigh and rubbing his eyes. It was getting late and his buzz was winding down. Now he just felt heavy and sleepy. He was just gazing past Sherlock, his eyes wandering. until-
A murder had occurred in New London’s latest magical brothel - An incident involving a fairy no less - and Sherlock needed information in regard to certain...fae physiologies...and Desire Spirits were knowledgeable of a lot...types.
Sebastian Moran gave the door another hard shove with a massive shoulder and felt it surrender. He tugged down the ball cap he was wearing and flicked his cigarette onto the sidewalk that was the signal. Sure enough, a sleek car soon slid up along the sidewalk. He glanced up to ensure he hadn't missed any of the security cameras earlier. Well, they'd need to be quick. The prissy older Holmes would throw a fit as soon as he learned his brother wasn't being monitored.
"Maybe you ought to switch to water as well," said Sherlock pointedly, "before you make an idiot of yourself. Or well a bigger idiot anyway."
John lets out a soft gasp, his entire body suddenly quivering in his rush to comply, stuffing more doughnuts into Sherlock’s mouth as quick as he can, peppering the man’s neck, chest, and belly with kisses. He gives a soft whimper as Sherlock arches his back, pushing against his buttons and sends one flying. He dutifully feeds Sherlock more, dipping his head down to kiss, suck, and worship that perfect belly. They are both panting, groaning, and spent in a matter of minutes. John feels Sherlock slip long clean fingers into his short cropped hair and lets out a happy sigh, his own sticky fingers still clinging to Sherlock’s overstuffed middle.
"Good to meet you, Sherlock Holmes. Questions? Questions are so..." He sighed, his belly expanding, blowing outwards a bit further, almost perfectly spherical, “... tedious. Get in the way of other things... why not just enjoy... the moment." He was shorter than Sherlock but suddenly his lips were only a whisper from the human's shapely mouth.
"Thank you for the sweets! Though I'm afraid I might not fit up your chimney any longer." He laughed again, a deep warm belly laugh.
"I think it was swapping all my runs for doughnut and sandwich snacks." He smirked and ate the last bite, licking and sucking at Sherlock's fingers, pressing his belly out fuller and fatter still, rubbing it indulgently. "Mmm..."
This was either the weirdest dream John has ever experienced, or he was still on some sort of whacked out trip from the drugs in his tea. He holds his gun at the ready as he steps out. There's a rustle in the room, a soft one as if something big is shifting, slipping along the dusty floor. John checks a corner to his left and then creeps slowly towards it.
I looked over at him, wanting to touch him, his shoulder, his hair, anything, and found him instead with a ‘cat found the cream’ face. The rest of the somewhat bulky envelope appeared to be money. I was not acquainted with German money, but by the rigidity of Holmes’s shoulders, it must have been quite a lot of it.
‘More,’ he rasped a second later, after he had seemingly gathered enough breath to speak. My heart hammering loudly in my ears, I obeyed.
I shook my head. When would I have had the opportunity? It was not a topic found in my journals, not that I had been keeping up with medical journals the past few years.
Holmes took me to a nicer restaurant this time, where he ordered us wine and fish. The wine was better than the fish, and better than anything else was the blush that spread on Holmes’s cheeks after his first glass. We were splurging in the middle of the day, in a foreign city, in which no one knew us (I hoped) and in which we knew no one (or only very few people, on Holmes’s side). A city which was renowned not only for its music, which we were about to partake in, but also for its somewhat unsavoury reputation, which we had also partook in the night before. I felt like a different person, in some aspects. But before me was Holmes, beside me was Holmes, and therefore I could be Watson. His Watson.
‘You know what to do, just—’ He reached over to the little table and handed me a jar of some ointment. ‘Use this, and…’
He shook his head. ‘There was no case. Mycroft is not pleased to have me in this city, and as I depend on him for the time being for any livelihood…’ He shook his head again; his hands fell from my side. ‘There is… something for me in the south of France.’
Holmes looked at me and looked at me, his thumb just brushing the joint between my neck and shoulder. Then he kissed me, his lips soft but quivering upon mine, just for a moment, just enough for me to get used to it, then hid his face in my neck again.
I looked at him as I brought over his tea; he had slept. His eyes were a bit red, his hair sleep-mussed. He looked very handsome, and it occurred to me that I could think that now, perhaps even express it to him. In all my years of knowing him, and thinking it, I could say it now.
‘Bien sûr,’ was her reply, a mystified tone in her voice I more than recognised from myself and others exposed to Holmes’s deducing prowess. The man was indeed a marvel when on the hunt, and was even more astounding when he explained his solution to a case. She continued in language I could not understand, but which left Holmes preening in satisfaction. I squeezed around his waist then stepped forward to shake her hand.
before I remembered that Holmes couldn’t return with me. That he was not allowed back to England. That, in order to stay with him later, I would have to leave him behind now.
Holmes’s fingers stilled. He took another drag of his cigarette as though delaying his response. ‘I wasn’t sure you would be interested in seeing me again,’ he murmured, a confession.
My hands drifted up and down before resting, one on his shoulder, the other in his hair, as I took his lips over and over and over. He was humming, then moaning, then began to squirm under me, until I sat up a bit for air.
The pain overruled after a few moments. I kissed his hairline and squeezed his hip, mindful of the bruises I knew were there. ‘Holmes,’ I hushed against his skin.
‘That man,’ he whispered, folding the envelope and putting it in his coat pocket hastily. He drew a quick breath. ‘That’s enough for a week’s rent at a nicer flat, and he wishes me to go to France.’
‘Whose name?’ I figured he was speaking of the ruffian with whom he’d gotten into a ‘good fight’, but that was the part I played with Holmes: the curious, mostly ignorant companion, who knew (or pretended to know) what questions to ask to stir Holmes’s genius.
We both of us moan: he is deeper within me now, rolling his hips regularly, but still slowly, and I have to sit up to catch my breath.
I looked over to Holmes beside me, my suspicions clarified in his face. He looked excited, but doubtful, his brow creased; his countenance screamed tense and timid, as if he were nervous how I would react to such a spectacle.
‘Sit down, let me,’ I said sharply. He nodded, and without fully realising what I was doing, only concerned that Holmes was hurt, and had been for God knows how long, I unbuttoned his shirt and pushed it and his vest aside to reveal a mass of bruises on his left side. I barely restrained a gasp, and admonished, ‘
I realised, as he placed the contents of the sack on the table, that he was rolling his own cigarettes. It was something I don’t remember seeing him do before, and I admit I watched with hungry eyes, eager to see his long, thin fingers work the tobacco and paper just so.
His head fell between his arms, and for the first time since I set eyes on him that day, I realised how exhausted, how downtrodden, this man was. I let go of his arms gingerly and stood up, mindful of the tea, and put my arms around his shoulders. All the tension in his body released, and I was able to pull him out of the chair and hobble us both into the adjacent sitting room and onto a stiff, battered-looking old couch. The furniture was set up in almost exactly the same formation as our rooms, which was something I would think about more in depth at a later time. For the moment, I reclined against the arm of the sofa and let Holmes naturally relax against me, his head on my chest, our legs tangled. I wrapped my arms around him, content now to just hold him, hoping this affection was welcome and that I was not overstepping my bounds.
Then I thought of the years we spent apart, and Holmes looking down at his lap, not only ashamed but withdrawn, almost sad. I thought of what he had put himself through to protect me from what he thought of as his ruin, and I moved my chair forward and bent over the table, making sure my dear friend was watching as I lifted his hand, carried like a gem between mine, and kissed the back of it.
Once again alone in Holmes’s squalid rooms, I leaned against the wall, watching Holmes. It was dark and quiet, and he lit a candle in the sitting room and carried it straight to the bedroom, without looking my direction. The flame flickered wildly as he limped. I followed him, and when I saw him begin to undress to change into his sleep things, I matched his movements.
Holmes got into the bed first. It was a rather nasty looking thing, with a sheet upon it that wasn’t quite white but not grey either and a matching sheet nearly too thin to count as cover. But as Holmes got between them, head on one half of the pillow and at the very edge of the bed, it suddenly looked like the most inviting spectacle I had ever seen.
He leans in and kisses me once more, and I press as close to him as I can, his hips moving harder now. His tongue rubs against mine just as his cock rubs against that spot inside me, and I bite his lip to keep from shouting at how good it feels. How good he makes me feel, how wanted, how loved…
‘Good beer,’ I said dumbly, and covered the useless comment with another bite of the bread. I watched him watch me chew. After another few bites, he spoke.
I admit, however, that I was not as moved at the performance as Holmes was. More moved was I by Holmes himself; his eyes were all but glued to the stage, and for a portion of the play, I watched his lips form the words the actors themselves were outcrying. Holmes the actor was a shade before me, and I was enthralled. What if I had met him then, when he was but an actor? Doubtless he would have been one of the best; I don’t think there is an area of study in which Holmes would lack any talent, given he were as passionate in it as I knew him to be about crime. What if I had first met him on the stage, in costume, performing?
At the sight of the envelope in my hand, he visibly relaxed a bit and made a motion towards it. Understanding his cue, I opened it.
“John,” I cry out, imploring him to understand, and of course he does. His hands clench my arse harder, and his own arse begins to leave our bed as he thrusts harder into me. I bite my lip to keep back a scream, but a loud noise comes out anyway. And my Watson, ever the pragmatic carer, tips me forward once more, and I mouth his shoulder to try to keep quiet.
I smiled, trance broken, and walked over to the back of the sofa as he picked up the newspaper to his right. I placed a hand on his right shoulder and bent to kiss the crown of his head.
The address was to a club, not totally unlike that of Mycroft’s Diogenes Club, which both surprised me and didn’t at all. I could not guess the histories of either club, whether they be related or not, but knew that Mycroft Holmes would be able to sniff out such a club in another city for such a peculiar meeting as this one might be.
,’ he whispered, and thrust back as I thrust forward, and he stayed utterly still as I came to completion inside him, the moment lasting longer than I ever remembered. ‘Oh, Watson,’ he hushed, and I stilled finally, still trembling, and kissed him.
Once again I was stirred from my inward reverie by thunderous applause. Holmes didn’t stand up this time to clap; instead, he whistled a few times, then turned to me, and to my utter astonishment, held my face in his hands and kissed me full on the lips.
I could not take my eyes off of him. Even though he was looking down at me, and it would seem for all the world that he was leading, he yielded to me at every turn, every step, his eyes never leaving mine, coquettish under his lashes, his cheeks a warm, becoming shade. He was lovelier than I had ever seen him, and after that song ended and a slightly quicker one took its place, I pulled him a bit closer, not worried at all about impropriety, as there were couples beside us who seemed only to be embracing each other and rocking back and forth to some other beat. But he went as I pulled him, and he went as I led, the power he was allowing me humbling me above all else. That Holmes would yield to me in this moment meant more than I could say; for I had no doubt he was more than adept at any kind of dance man ever knew, and no doubt he knew I was rusty at the even simplest form of dance. It was an intimate submission, an even more intimate embrace. In the back of my mind, I wondered at the situation: I was holding Holmes in public, dancing with him even, among other men who undoubtedly felt a similar passion for their like-sex partners. A week ago, I woke up crying from a dream I had about Holmes. Now, I gripped him tighter around his waist and pulled him even closer until our chests were touching.
Holmes had mentioned French in his blood before. I admit it was easier to imagine him in France than in Berlin, but then again, I must admit to myself that I still did not know Holmes as well as I would like to believe. Still, no case in Berlin? Perhaps I had been correct: it seemed more and more likely now that Holmes had come to Berlin not only for the research being undertaken here for those of … his own kind, but also for the city’s exquisite, world-renowned concerts.
I attempted tidying up some papers — merely straightening them, trying to avoid looking too closely at them for fear of what I might find, although I am not sure if pressed I could give a reason for this hesitancy — while Holmes made himself presentable. He shaved, I am sure, although I did not understand why. I knew Holmes was always fastidious about his personal cleanliness to an extreme, but I couldn’t imagine the café we were going to would expect pristine clientèle like the gentlemen’s clubs in London. I myself was past due for a shave — would he expect me to shave as well? He had never said anything on the matter of my personal grooming before, other than a comment once when we attended an opera before which he specified which particular suit I must wear. Still, I would hate for him to be embarrassed about my own appearance. It wouldn’t do for me to be unsavoury next to a man with as much grace as Holmes had.
His hands trace my spine lazily as I lift myself up -- with a gross noise between us of my seed drying and sticking to each of our chests -- and kiss him softly. His moustache tickles, but I lean into it. He hums and pulls me closer to him, and I close my eyes and kiss him and kiss him and kiss him. A thousand kisses would not be enough.
Mycroft was still staring at me, as though waiting for a response. I did not really have one, for any promise to him to be careful seemed trite, and any promise that such carefulness would not alter what Holmes and I shared seemed distasteful. So all I could manage was a nod and a rough, ‘Thank you, Mycroft.’
‘Stay here,’ I murmured, patting his knee. Even if he were asleep, and it looked like he was, mostly, I knew he would still hear me. ‘I’ll make tea.’
He opened his mouth but only a soft whimper came out as I bit on his neck. I watched him lick his lips and try again. ‘For the love of God, John, I believe you can call me my Christian name now.’
‘Oh Watson, your first observation was quite correct,’ the voice said, and it was Holmes’s own, could not be any other’s. ‘I am indeed your Sherlock Holmes, and I believe I owe you a thousand apologies.’
The telegrams sent, my fate in the air for the night, Holmes and I hobbled back together to his meagre lodgings. It was growing dark, and on the last block, Holmes nearly tripped and immediately caught himself on my arm. I stopped briefly, silent, and put my hand on his, perched still on my arm. He faked a quick smile at me, a swift upturning of his lips without any emotion, then continued looking straight ahead. There was a flare of pain in my chest at the sight of him not at his best, but I steadfastly carried on.
The papers do not help matters, either. Two years on from the worst of it, from the headlines blaspheming his name, shouting twisted claims which I know are not and cannot be true, as I lived with the man and felt I knew him. It was a dreadful business and painful too, and even two years on, his name is merely hushed in high society, and I find strangers who recognise me or otherwise know of my identity skirt along my edges as though I were a contagion of their horrid claims.
‘I do not have brandy for a nightcap,’ he murmured apologetically, once he was clothed only in his nightgown.
Confused, I looked over to the woman singing. Who was not… Oh. I noticed the…  tightness of the dress in certain places and a particular bulge in the middle of the throat.
, Holmes. Anywhere you like.’ I reached over and put my hand on his, the two of our hands on his thigh. ‘Whenever you like and wherever you like,’ I hushed.
Holmes was dead; Sherlock Holmes is dead, I told myself. I slapped my mouth open and shut several times before I managed, ‘My sincere apologies, I thought you were — I thought you might be —’
Mycroft continued, his voice heavy with foreboding, very nearly a schoolmaster scolding a young boy.
‘When I saw that dreadful man, it was then,’ he said, far quieter than I remember him speaking, unless we were hidden in a client’s house, planning an attack, and that memory made my heart ache all over again; he continued, ‘It was at that moment that I had to make a decision.’ His pale grey eyes found mine then skittered away just as soon. ‘And it is one I fear I have regretted every day since.’
‘Yes, Watson,’ he hushed. I thrilled at the sight of his full attention, those dark, wide eyes boring into my own.
‘I have a flat in mind,’ he said after a moment. I grinned at him as he blushed, his eyes flicking to my eyes and down and back to my eyes, a smiling growing on his lips.
We spent several moments catching our breath and still partly entwined, otherwise one of us might fall off the bed. I looked at his chest and could make out, in the shadows, our seed intermixed on his stomach; I looked down to find the same remnants on my own nightshirt. I began to laugh, a low rumble beginning at what felt like the innermost part of my chest and spiralling outwards.
‘I have wanted you for so long,’ I whispered back, moving my hands under his shoulder blades so that I was flush above him, our chests pressed together and my hips never stilling. I felt his good leg hitch higher around me and knew I was still aiming true; his moans were constant now, and I felt his hand between us move quicker on his own prick.
‘Anything by Havelock Ellis? J.A. Symonds?’ I shook my head; those were names I had never even heard. He nodded and went on, ‘Of course not. There is… There has been research done here in Germany about such a condition, did you know?’ Once more I shook my head. He smiled; it was his
I was not to let anyone else be privy to the knowledge that not only Holmes was alive, but also that he was currently in Germany, or that he planned to go to France. While with Holmes in public, I was to abide by Holmes’s own alias, which I was told to be ‘Sigerson’, and further, I was to be quite careful of outing him here. Mycroft warned me that even one slip-up, one hushed ‘Holmes’ in the man’s ear, could mean the worst, especially when he, in his words, ‘had no ears and eyes on this blasted city’.
I nodded dumbly, his words cutting me deep. Reality set in, as though I had been living in a dream the past two days (and in some ways, I feel I must have been). What Holmes and I did last night, even our very sentiment regarding each other, was illegal. In Germany and in England. Our love was undeniable and all-consuming, I knew, but there was a fragility to it as well. One mistake, one false move, and it could fall apart in our hands. I could lose Holmes in it as easily as he could lose me; the law could ruin either or both of us sooner than we could prepare. Modesty and due diligence would have to be forefront in our relations to each other, even when alone; it would always be there, following us, haunting us. We would have to learn to live with it, else it consumed us and separated us. To continue with each other, with our sentiment, we would have to be overcautious at every moment. It was a promise I made to myself then: that above all, Holmes’s safety must be put first.
He hums in understanding, a small grumble, and withdraws his fingers. “Sherlock,” he says as he hands the jar to me. I lean back and smear my hand, knowing what he is asking. We’ve done this enough times that no words are necessary anymore. I understand exactly what he wants, because I’ve done it dozens of times now.
We were nearly late to the showing, the man taking tickets only soothed by Holmes’s apparently flawless German. He let us in, and I followed Holmes to our seats, rather far back from the stage. It wouldn’t be easy to see the actors, but going by the way Holmes was a solid ball of energy next to me, I could tell that the distance did not bother him in the slightest.
It was smoky and overcrowded, hot, but with a curious undercurrent of energy and what I could only describe as longed-for elation. There seemed to be dozens upon dozens of people crowded into this smallish room, perhaps a ballroom; men and women, all dressed up to varying degrees, from pearl-necklaced ladies to working-class chaps. There was lively music playing, and it occurred to me that I couldn’t see the band for the throng of people, but knew there was definitely a woman singer and string instruments. I couldn’t quite wrap my head around the multitude of people, and that was before I noticed the particular peculiarity of it all.
‘I haven’t been able to afford my usual tobacco,’ he commented apologetically, drawing me out of my rather deep fantasies, watching his fingers work. He went on, and I forced myself to listen now, ‘This place is so drab, Watson! The tea is rank and my brand of tobacco is too expensive.’
We were even farther back this time, but better still, Holmes had managed to procure a small box for us. A private box to see this orchestra: only the two of us, with no one else able to see us. My mind spun at the implications, even though I knew that we were gentlemen and would not get up to anything unsavoury. But I also knew that if I had the option to hold Holmes’s hand in public, even wrap an arm around his shoulders if I were feeling particularly risqué, I would do so, provided he allowed it. And to be able to touch Holmes — if he did indeed allow it, and I could not imagine he would not, given our hand-holding this afternoon — to be able to touch him during one of his highly-esteemed concerts, when he was so immersed in the music that he seemed aethereal and untouchable — well, the mere thought filled my blood with liquid fire.
My world went black around the edges, my mouth opened to speak; I heard only a distant gasp and shuffling, and felt myself disappear. I came to most likely only moments later, when Holmes — was it Holmes? Dear God, please tell me it was — was walking me, supporting me, to a chair inside. I heard a door shut and slumped in the chair, gasping, and raised my hands to grasp his arms. He knelt in front of me, this man who so resembled my dear friend, save the darkness in his features and the look of pure concern on his face.
All I could manage was a gruff-sounding, ‘Y-es,’ and he pulled me by the hand towards the throng and into it. Bodies seemed to move around him as he went, the public clearing space for this very moment, and my heart leaped hard in my chest when he turned to me, hooked his cane over his elbow, and grasped my good shoulder. His posture and hand placement was one of a lady’s, and I realised slowly, my mind hazy not with smoke but desire, that Holmes was bidding me to lead the dance. Luckily the song, albeit jubilant, was slower in nature, and a sort of waltz would do; I doubted I, or Holmes for that matter, could quite muster anything as fast as a Viennese waltz, nor did I quite know the intricate steps of anything fancier. But I could dance, for the most part, or at least I could fake it well enough. I hooked my cane over my elbow, matching Holmes, took his hand and waist, and led.
I chuckled and let myself kiss the top of his spine, which in the night had miraculously been exposed. ‘Holmes,’ I tried again.
‘The odds that we would be arrested are abysmally small.’ His voice was tight, but I couldn’t fault him for it. I felt a flash of shame to even think of the possibility, but it was a possibility, wasn’t it, and especially for Holmes’s kind and the sort of relationship I had with him.
All in all, his German lodgings were barely furnished, cold, and about a third the size of our lodgings in London, and I had the feeling he had not been here long enough — or at the very least had not had the energy — to make it any homier. I assumed Mycroft was paying for it in some small way, and as I leaned against the counter, watching Holmes set about quite slowly to make tea, he murmured, his back to me, ‘It’s not Baker Street, but it’s all my meagre allowance can afford. And at any rate, it is one of the best in the area, and quite livable.’ Mind read again, I daresay.
His head was arched to the heavens, his eyes squeezed shut; he moaned my name and what sounded like a garbled declaration of love, then let out a string of whimpers and even a few curses as he shook apart under me. I slowed my hips so as not to overstimulate him, but kept moving as smoothly as I could manage, as he spurted across his chest, his hand still on his prick. He was beautiful, aethereal, so real I thought I could cry; I kissed his face, every inch of him I could reach, until he caught his breath and pressed both hands to my shoulders.
A knock at the door startled me out of my dark thoughts. I looked at Holmes, watched him straighten and pale. He didn’t move, his spine frighteningly stiff, his eyes on mine. He clearly was not expecting anyone; in fact, I don’t think I had ever seen him so panicked. I nodded wordlessly and stood and went to the door, preparing myself for I don’t know what.
This is still going -- reworking the next chapter as we speak. Some plot will happen, if we're lucky. To the readers who comment every chapter: You do not understand the strength you give me to continue this.
Holmes gave me an indulgent smile and a pat on the knee, and as the curtain was raised, he shushed me (needlessly, as I was struck silent), but most importantly he neglected to remove his hand. Looking around, seeing all other eyes focussed only on the stage, I covered his hand with my own and laced our fingers together. They stayed like that for the remainder of the performance, even after Holmes once laughed out loud and raised his hand to his mouth to cover the noise; even after that, his hand meandered back to my own, waiting still on my knee.
Holmes whimpered then and rocked his hips downward at some blessed angle which left me seeing stars. My eyes closed and I leaned forward, over Holmes a little, and rocked my hips deeper inside him.
He lost it within seconds; I felt him tense and cry out my name and I sat up just a little, my breath coming in fierce pants, to see his
I followed Holmes into the bedroom as we wordlessly prepared for bed. It was still quite early for both of us, but it seemed we had silently agreed it was time. The bed was small but loomed over us as we undressed and changed, our backs to each other. It was as though the coming change to our relationship — whatever might come of sharing a bed in love, a change even beyond the multitude kisses we had shared throughout the afternoon and evening — were an added weight in the air.
He took in a deep breath and exhaled loudly, a stone’s throw from a harrumph, but he spoke. ‘The fight with Moriarty was… involved. He…’ He was silent for several moments, his head turned to look at the wall, and finally he just shook his head. I knew then I wasn’t going to get any specifics. I nodded, trusting he would tell me in time. And even if I never learned of it — I would still take care of him.
Without looking back at Holmes, I took his comment as the invitation it was and wordlessly carried my suitcase into the single bedroom, the same room Holmes had disappeared into earlier to shave. The room was small and as dusty and damp as the rest of the place. There was barely room for a bed and a lamp; a mirror lay on the wall by the door, cracked and nearly opaque. Across from the bed was a small wardrobe, which I noticed upon opening was nearly empty. I filled it with my few garments, my heart bursting at the mere sight of our nightshirts hanging together. It was a miracle, wasn’t it? I didn’t let myself have a moment, though, and turned to look at the bed.
‘Oh,’ Holmes gasped, and it was the same tone of voice he used when a clue had surprised him and led him to solve the mystery. I blushed — then wondered how I could have any modesty to
He let out a low hum, almost a purr, and arched into me. The movement freed my arm briefly; I sat up a bit and flexed it, then propped my head up to look down at Holmes, who had turned more on his back and was looking up at me. He looked sleepy, as though he had indeed slept a little (a fact for which I was grateful), and he had an ornery twinkle in his eyes. My heart pounded as he turned more and lifted his left hand to cup my cheek.
I fell asleep on the train thinking of this and woke up in Germany the next morning with a stiff neck and heavy heart. The train stopped and I disembarked, hoping my rudimentary knowledge of German would carry me at least to the address Holmes’s relation had provided me.
I had to refrain from touching him for several minutes so that I could calm down. Once I got my heart back within reasonable beating speed, I stretched my arm behind him to rest on his shoulders, hoping I wasn’t pushing my luck and watching him for any signs of distaste. There were none; he smiled, eyes closed, and leaned back into my arm, his head thrown back and his fingers tapping on his knee. I watched him like that for the remainder of the concert with no further incident, but with such passion and — yes, I daresay — lust coursing through my veins I could not focus on anything, not the music, but him.
After several moments, I heard footsteps approach. The door opened, my gaze on the doormat, which I just noticed had a strange stain on it which looked of dried blood. I knew, because living with Holmes, accompanying him on his cases, I’d seen quite a bit of dried blood on myriad surfaces and feel with some confidence that I can recognise blood a mile off. The door opened and I looked up, about to warn the fellow that something had happened on his doorstep, and felt all the blood leave my face. Before me, having opened the door, standing in front of me in the flesh, was a gaunt, older, but still — undoubtedly — Sherlock Holmes.
I sat up on my elbows on either side of his shoulders, my own shoulder be damned, to look down at him. His hair was wild, his cheeks a beautiful rouge, his eyes remarkably bright even as pupilly black as they were. I captured his lips again, once, a quick pull, my heart pounding as he groaned again and fully arched, pressing his torso against mine, his head against the pillow. He was a sight like none I had ever seen, and I have never wanted anything more fiercely than I wanted him in that moment.
He arched again below me and let out a loud moan. I continued marking him, determined not to go any further and not to move my hips until he answered my question.
He nodded, licking his lips again and panting almost worryingly hard. ‘Yes, John, yes.’ I groaned and rolled my hips, nearly fainting at how good he felt against me. ‘
I nodded and kissed his hair and wrapped one arm around his shoulders, wanting to hold him. He went willingly, clutching my sides, an action which warmed my chest. Gods above, he looked heartbroken, melancholic, as though he were about to face something he had dreaded for a long time. Maybe he was. A part of me was somewhat pleased at the evidence that Holmes felt something so strong but most of all that it was tied to me, to him missing me when I had to leave. It soothed something deep and thorny within me, for it showed that his feelings matched mine; for I imagined my heart would rip into shreds when we parted again tomorrow. But then again — what an ever sweeter reunion we would have on the other side of it.
‘Mr Holmes,’ I replied warmly, shaking his hand. We two had rarely been alone together, so the familiarity was rather stiff. Just as well, as I did not quite understand the man before me, and wasn’t sure I would ever be allowed to do. I felt a great debt to him, though, for pointing me in the direction of his still-alive brother, and tried to let that warmth not consume my businesslike composition. I did not want to embarrass the man with any unwelcome overfamiliarity.
I nodded again and kissed his chin. I was aware: that much I had been aware of, from the army and from whispers spread within the medical field.
Holmes paused here and looked at me through his eyelashes, and I caught on. The papers. All the articles, everything, everyone, blaspheming Holmes’s good name with such a disreputable … reputation.
I could have hovered there for an eternity, bent awkwardly over the sofa and Holmes’s shoulder, if it meant I could continue kissing him. However, reality unfortunately set in after only a few moments; my shoulder and leg twinged in unison, and Holmes pulled away with a soft hum.
‘I would rather not have brandy anyway,’ I replied. I had begun to deduce what we were to get up to now and didn’t wish for any beverage to dilute the experience.
This is still in the works. I've got a bit more of a plan now. You commenters might notice reflections in the story -- that's because you're commenting exactly what I need to continue. I don't think this would be continued without you, so thank you.
He was looking at the table, his hand on his leg. I knew he was in pain, but did not know what to say or do, especially in response to the look of shame and defeat on his face, so I blurted, ‘This chanteuse is quite talented.’
This fact about Holmes’s life before I met him did not surprise me; I held it close to my heart and kept it and let it feed into the image I had of Holmes as a younger man: spry and lively, but with some hint of sadness, a tint of loneliness. I saw it in the lines on his face whenever I returned from a trip which separated us. I recognised it in the wrinkles on his brow when I arrived in Berlin; they were the very same I noticed when I first met him in that laboratory those years ago. I wondered how long loneliness had haunted Holmes before I had found him.
‘John,’ he whimpered, and I grunted in response, my entire body lighting up with that one word, as marvelously uttered as it was. ‘Oh, John, I love you.’
Arm in arm, and accompanied by the soft taps of my cane on my right and Holmes’s on his left, we left the poor digs once more. I let Holmes guide me to the address to which Mycroft had bid us, content to rely on his inner map, which I am sure he had built within hours of setting foot in the city. The streets were busier than the day before, the people not altogether more foreign than the crowds in London. The sun was high in the sky, hardly a cloud in sight, and a nice, light blue; the wind was pleasant, and Holmes’s arm in mine was warm and comfortable. It all left me with an overall feeling of pleasantness, so much so that I felt that no matter what would come tomorrow, Holmes and I were together today, and that was more than I could have said for the past two years. Once again, a feeling of intense gratitude at my luck and the past day’s turn of events overtook me. I squeezed Holmes’s arm in mine. He hummed and patted my arm in his.
‘Is it good?’ I asked and rocked again, deeper this time, and knew the thrust had rung true when he cried out sharply.
I frowned. I was never one to be so controlling that I had to know where Holmes was and what he was doing at all times — Holmes was his own man, something everyone who ever met him understood — and so he didn’t need me to peek into his personal affairs any more than he allowed me to. But his vagueness now, in this foreign city, after so soon a reunion (and just after last night’s rather intimate activities), cut me the wrong way.
He sighed and turned his head to the side. ‘The fight was a little over a week ago. I— I sent for you as soon as it was safe, Watson, please believe me—’
‘I trust your stay in Berlin is going well?’ The tone was too airy for what lay under the words, and I immediately understood from it that we were to keep this interaction entirely void of my Holmes, his present, living condition, and especially the events of the past day.
I brought his hand to my lips. This was a man who had sacrificed everything to keep his country safe, who selflessly let go of his life with his one companion, with no certainty of surviving, in order to protect him. This was a man who now had no home and a broken body. I kissed his hand, willing myself not to shed a tear, to be the brave one as he expected me to be.
‘And a bigger bed,’ I ventured, and was rewarded with a small, delighted laugh and a deeper blush. He stroked my cheek and thumbed my moustache; I gathered his hand in mine and kissed it. Together through anything, no matter what, I wanted to promise him. I could not leave him now; surely he must understand that. Holmes the great Mind must see that I could not possibly live without him now. And if he didn’t see it, I promised myself then that I would show him, every day, every minute and hour, until he believed it as strongly as I meant it.
Holmes hummed, not an answer to my question at any rate, and continued on his speed-reading run. He didn’t even look up at me, just emitted that one grunt to my question. It was too much like the Holmes I knew for it to sit comfortably with me: I wondered how long it would take for me to be left in the dark again, for Holmes to leave again without giving me anything to go on.
‘I will not have you die with me,’ he said adamantly, and looked at me, fire in his eyes. ‘Mycroft will give you some story to tell everyone. That’s his job to iron it out; I have given him a few ideas, but he knows … better. He will send you back to London today, I am sure.’
‘Do not pity me, Watson,’ he said in a chilled voice. ‘I am not to be pitied, that is the one thing I will not be able to stomach. Any care, any affection, yes, but not your pity. Never your pity.’
Just as I was pouring the tea, I heard Holmes enter the kitchen, fully buttoned up and dressed once more, and sit primly in his chair from before.
‘This is not an official business,’ was his reply, and so I took the next evening’s train to Berlin, my curiosity sufficiently piqued.
I wondered where his pipe was, or if he even had a pipe. The Holmes I knew consumed tobacco like a fiend. It was admittedly bizarre to see him have to put so much work in just for cigarettes. And as he set to work rolling his first one, I confess I found it impossible to take my eyes off his hands, even as he continued his story.
‘I believe you will meet him soon enough, Watson,’ he answered, and the finality in his tone bid me to leave it. It was a mysterious answer, but Holmes had always had an ear for mystery. I would have to trust him to be safe — I would not allow myself to overpower him. It was not and never had been my role.
‘This is a pub for … people like me,’ he said haltingly in my ear, over the jubilant music. I swallowed, clutching my cane.
After I finished my beer, of which Holmes himself even drank some, Holmes and I left the club. It was dark in the city now, and fewer people on the streets. A few people here and there were pouring out of the pub we were just in, including the two (possible) sailors, both of whom nodded at me with matching smirks before we each went our separate ways. I caught Holmes’s eye then and was surprised to find a dark look on his face. If I hadn’t known better, I would have guessed that look was one of jealousy; as it was, and especially with a smallish smirk on his own lips, it seemed a knowing, appreciative glance more than anything else.
He continued finally, but somewhat out of breath, ‘I was looking for a fight, in a pub I’d passed on my way to get a newspaper. The man — a working class Berliner — offered it up to me in the form of some snide comment; even in German, Watson, I knew if I didn’t fight, my dignity would have been tainted.’ As he continued rummaging around, I was grateful he couldn’t see my face grimacing at his blasé commentary. ‘I slung, and he slung, and within two punches we were each of us rather kicked out.’ He stood up finally, a small drawstring sack in his shaking hands, and limped back to his chair.
I sat up a bit, separating our chests but not our hips, and rocked forward. I watched his face and rocked forward again. Even through our scant clothes, I could feel the head of his erection against mine; the feeling was heady, and overwhelming, but not as overwhelming as the sight of Holmes underneath me, overcome by pleasure.
The newspaper in Holmes’s hands fluttered down loudly. Without turning around, he said in what might have been an amused tone, ‘Whatever precipice you're dangling over, Watson, jump off it or back down. You're making the hairs on my neck stand on end just hovering there.’
I was led by a lad into some back room, and there waiting for me, sure enough, was Holmes’s elder brother. He stood at a desk which was sat in the middle of the room, a largeish window the only source of light. He looked the same as he had a few days before, when he had sent me here in the first place. It was strange to see him again here, and stranger still to realise that it had been only a few days, not years, since we last saw each other.
‘Sherlock Holmes,’ I murmured, testing the words in my mouth, particularly my mouth against the side of his very very alive neck. Finding them worthy, I repeated them again, and made him look at me once more. I kissed his lips once, where a smallish pout was forming, I think to be parted from my skin, and said, ‘Sherlock Holmes, you’re alive.’ He nodded and bit his bottom lip. I pulled it out from his teeth with my thumb, brushing along it as I did. ‘You’re alive and you must know —’
After another, shorter kiss, Holmes stretched in my lap, arms above his head, a small squeaking noise emitted from his kiss-swollen mouth. I watched as he smacked his lips and slowly stood up, looking all lanky limbs, and regrettably allowed him to wriggle out of my reach. He offered a hand to me, which I took, and when he dropped it, I replaced it with my cane which in the interim had been leaning behind us against the dingy grey wall.
‘We couldn’t possibly be.’ I looked up to find a sad smile on his face. ‘Your readership is not so strong here, Watson.’
I watched his eyes flicker and dance, a smile toil at his lips before spreading into a grin, and he said back to me, apparent wonder in his voice, ‘And I you, my John.’
‘I want you inside me,’ he whispered after a moment, taking my breath away altogether. Before I could form a reply, he added, ‘I have everything we need. I have … done it before, not with another, per se, but I…’ He did not continue, but I understood all the same. After another moment which I spent forcing oxygen back into my lungs, I lost it all again when he said, his voice low and husky, ‘I want your prick inside me.’
‘Lucky you.’ I kissed his hand once more before setting it on the table, held between both my hands, astonished that Holmes allowed it. I wondered how long it had been since anyone — friend or foe — had touched him.
‘Please,’ Holmes said, his eyes boring without pause or hesitation into mine, and he pulled me ever closer by my hips. Then he added, shamelessly, ‘I have wanted this for so long.’
which was currently coursing through me, making me almost dizzy. The mere thought of — of what he asked of me — of putting my prick
My ears piqued at Holmes's words, and soon I found myself on the streets of Berlin again, arm and arm with Holmes, the sun just beginning to set. Holmes clearly had a destination in mind. He was in a hurry too, it seemed, but his injury kept him from moving his usual speed. I knew because he was holding onto my arm more so than he had earlier that day. I was more than happy to give him the support he needed and knew better than to comment on it. Holmes’s pride (or perhaps rather, his self-worth) was a dangerous, fragile thing.
He shook his head, then added, ‘In Paris, yes. My leg was already a bit messed up, I am afraid, and my ribs, too. But after the fight with the ruffian here…’ He looked sheepish. ‘It’s not serious, Watson? I thought it was only normal bruising from a good fight.’
Holmes led me to what seemed to be a pharmacy and bid me to wait outside. I nodded, frankly thankful that I would not have to be faced with even the slightest chance of being expected to speak a language I did not know. He appeared a minute later with a glint in his eye and a pack of cigarettes. When he offered me one, I accepted, and we continued our walk, puffing wordlessly as we went. After a few steps, he began to hum good-spiritedly what I imagined to be a prelude to the concert; I was not able to prevent my chest from puffing up at the sound of Holmes in such good spirits.
"Y-yes! Fath kismash haz to come, I wanted... what did I want?" Sherlock asked, slumping into his lover, rubbing his cheek against the doctor's sandy hair
"W-want to watch a movie? Or just get to bed?" he asked, tugging his jumper down over his massively bloated middle.
The sound is overwhelming, and Sherlock is jolted back into that 'little' space, the music pulsing through him like blood in his veins.
"Alright. I do," he admitted, surrendering himself to soft sighs and gasps and moans as John fully worshiped his over sensitive middle. It was difficult to determine which of them was getting the bigger treat tonight.
“What are the sexual fetishes of Archibald Icemoon and Yzram Frozentundra?" He asked, trying to focus on the victims of his case instead of the pure pleasure of John's lard flowing over him
"I'll admit, I've been less observant than I like to think possible of myself, but it did prove an interesting experiment," Sherlock continued.
“Yeah," said John, oddly touched at that vivid memory being used for him. "They were wonderful though. I might have finished the whole thing before we even got it home," he joked.
His thrusts grew erratic, his muscles tensing as his orgasm burst from him. He shouted Sherlock's name, shuddering and gasping with the force of it until he collapsed against his lover, kissing every bit of skin he could reach and moaning softly.
Sherlock freezes as he enter the kitchen, where John lays passed out on the floor, his usual tea-mug shattered. Warm, dark tea drippling in a puddle toward the shoulder of his flat mate’s tan, cuddly jumper
“Oink,” he begs. And that look Sherlock gives him before taking the pitcher from his is worth all the belly aches in the world.
"Mm, I know, I've got you," John purred, smiling and moving in to prepare Sherlock again. He watched, eyes heated, as Greg's lips parted. The DI shuddered and swayed, stepping closer to support his massive body as Sherlock kissed his member.
John couldn't help himself. He rutted lightly against Sherlock's huge fat thigh, watching as the man's belly pooled on the desk beneath him. He kissed Sherlock's back, then growled, "Think you're ready for me fatass?"
"For feeding your boyfriend? He's already a fat hog, what's a little candy floss going to do?" sneers Moran.
He sipped more of his tea and reached for more cookies. He had to get himself properly stuffed. Then he could lay around until dinner and then eat all he could again. He cut a third smaller piece of treacle even as his belly gurgled.
"I think we have some left over take away in the refrigerator," Sherlock added quickly. "I could get it if you li-"
"I forgot to bring you your food," he said, imagining John hungrily munching it down, those abs giving way to a massive, furry gut. He coughed lightly, letting out a small hiccup as his bloated belly shifted angrily under its lacey confines.
Sherlock noted the small tummy he was sporting, moving his hands to squeeze the bit of soft flesh. It looked...good. Like he was taken care of, which the curly haired man most certainly was. He rubbed at his eyes, wandering out of the bedroom and yawning loudly. Perhaps he could heat up some of the leftover ham from last night, if there was any left, John seemed to have really enjoyed-
"Oomph, that was terrific! Thank you for such a good meal, Mrs. Holmes," said John, still shifting as he tried to get comfortable. He glanced over at Sherlock and found the man looking utterly undone. The lanky detective was also slumped back in his seat, a hand resting on a bulge of belly John didn't know he had. Sherlock's shirts were always tight, but now the buttons appeared to be screaming, the fabric skin tight around the man's belly. John watched, entranced as Sherlock's breaths caused that endearingly round shape to expand, then contract. His lips looked plump and wet, his eyes were half lidded and dozy. Sherlock's other hand slid down discretely. The detective gave a soft sigh and his belly appeared to relax a bit further. He'd undone his trousers.
"Er... fair point. Hang on. 'Romantic interest'?" said John, looking up at Sherlock in surprise. "You mean.. you were trying to figure out what I liked so that you could, I dunno-"
He tries it again in another pattern, then another, before simply pounding on the gate with his hands, throwing what John would call a tantrum.
Then a light illuminates the small bit of hallway outside the door. Sherlock hurriedly scrambles forward and presses his face against the sweet, clear sugar. His eyes widen at what they see.
John attempts to tamp down his own panic, even as Sherlock struggles again. "Come on, focus on me. Moriarty's got us. We've got to get out of this mad house, yeah?"
"G-goodnight, John," Sherlock choked. He listened to John climbing the stairs, huffing and burping from fullness. Then the door snapped shut and Sherlock let out a moan of frustration, his forehead thumping against the kitchen table. Maybe John wouldn't remember all this tomorrow morning? What if he did? Sherlock felt his mind spinning, exploring the outcomes of either scenario. He had to admit, he rather preferred the latter. That one seemed to result in a plumper, softer John Watson. Yes. Infinitely preferable. Sherlock grinned and returned to his bedroom, leaving the empty platter, cartons, and glasses for John to find the next morning.
John watched as Sherlock drank the soda down, his eyes tracking the bob of that pale throat working, the detective's eyes fluttering closed, the way his abdomen contracted minutely, only to swell bigger and bigger.
John chuckled kindly and moved over to rub gently at his lover's hugely distended form. The curve of pale belly was now jutting up proudly under the man's ribs, the mass jostling slightly as Sherlock hiccuped or burped, the whole lot sloshing around.
John gives his detective a small warm smile before the patients start screaming again. "Come on!" He manages to haul Sherlock up and they tumble through the door Moran had entered from.
“Yeah. Seems to be doing you some good,” John smiles, feeling brave enough to reach over and give that perfectly soft and proddable belly a poke. “Must be up three stone already.”
John gasped, grunted, then moaned, grinning. "As you say," he purred, rubbing his fat arse into that long slim cock.
Sherlock can’t stop himself from letting out a moan when John touches his gut, followed by several loud burps and hiccups. The redness gradually eases out of the detective’s stomach under the doctor’s hands, and Sherlock whimpers as John undoes his pants, giving his gut more room.
"Nothing," John said lightly, grunting as he shifted to extend his hand to Sherlock. The detective groaned but managed to shift enough to take it. John squeezed.
"God, yeah," murmured John, moving closer still. At long last he reached out and laid a hand on Sherlock's belly, stroked it softly. The detective hummed encouragingly, happy to have finally caught his flatmate's eye.
John shudders as the tape plays out, then look around for you in panic. "Sherlock, Sherlock, come on, this way," he pleads, taking the detective’s hand again and tugging him to his feet. He catches a glimpse of the little thing again, imp-like with pale glowing eyes and a sick mockery of a smile.
"Sherlock! I hope you're ready to make good on that promise. Oh, you're in a shit ton of trouble, soldier! What you put me through all day," He said, smirking and looking around for him. He frowned and dropped the act, calling for him again. But he wasn't there.
"I'd hoped you'd like it, and I don't think that's anything to worry about," Sherlock nearly purred, laying a hand on John's flat middle, rubbing it lightly, movie forgotten.
He reached down and lazily began stroking his cock with one hand while the other circled his overfull stomach slowly.
He took a long drink of milk and burped lightly, then dove in for more pizza. As long as they were both eating. No need to hide it, right?
He tucked in to keep up appearances of not having just eaten more than his fair share of crisps and biscuits and other snacks. His belly gurgled in protest, swelling out further between his opened trousers, still hidden beneath his blanket.
John growled and moaned. He fell upon Sherlock with hunger and lust, finally kissing him. Taking him.
"That's good. I was going to have a long talk with you about things that are inappropriate at work, but I think I can teach you the lesson a bit better now," he said, grabbing a handful of Sherlock's bubble butt.
Sherlock swallowed the sweet down, then turned redder at John's comment, moaning loudly as the doctor frotted against him
"My Sherlock Holmes. I think I will rather like being your John. Shall I take your last name? Or come up with my own. I rather think I would like to stay." He grinned. "As long as you can feed us both."
John stands to move away from it, then hears more clicks. His hand closes on his gun. Good thing he’s got a few more rounds. This could actually be fun. A smirk tugs at the corner of his mouth.
“Coat,” Sherlock gasped in response, shuddering as he recalled the fantasy that had led to him stowing a packet of it in one of his coat pockets. Granted, it had involved a back alley after a case rather than the flat, but Sherlock was quite happy to improvise. John flung Sherlock’s coat off the hanger and attacked it, turning out the pockets before finding the lubricant and slotting himself up against Sherlock again.
In the control room Moriarty laughs, unaware of the small pot belly forming on his normally thin middle.
"Piggies need more feed, boss," he reported, looking over at Jim, his muscular arm draped over the back of the seat.
The place was a pigpen. Bloated swollen officers lay left and right, burping or groaning as mountainous bellies gurgled. He felt the strangest urge to prod them each one by one, grab handfuls of the fat.
John jolted up as he heard Sherlock call out to him. He hurriedly made sure he was covered by the blanket and stuffed all the empty wrappings and bags between the cushions. He muffled a burp as he looked up.
John had sunk to one knee, removed the goofy hat and pulled off the beard. In the black box was a silver ring with a gorgeous stone set into it and surrounded by tiny artful etchings of bees.
"Alright," agreed John, smiling at how agreeable Sherlock seemed. It was good to see him eat too. He changed and came down in a cuddly jumper and sweatpants. He was still in the shaper, but this way... well it suited a lazy Sunday. And he could stretch it further without being discovered.
Sherlock flushed. "I... yes. To put it crudely," he rumbled, sighing as he rubbed along the side of his gut. "Think I ought to cut back, doctor?"
He reaches the bottom of the stairs, and in front of him sits a sugary, pink, wafer door. A small, clear, heart-shaped window reveals a dark, dank hallway. Sherlock’s heart sinks in his chest. The dark was what he’d been most afraid of as a child, all that unknown existence, shrouded away, unable to be seen and therefore unable to be examined, understood, and conquered.
"And yet, here I am: living, breathing, in the flesh," growled the colonel, towering over John, old but strong still. "The boss sent me."
John felt all the blood coloring his cheeks rush down to his lower belly instead, filling his cock to hardness.
"It was...I'm impressed," Sherlock stammered, "And it’s just one day, John.Plus, I managed to finish mine too.”
"And they won't be over until the evening of the 25th, so the night of the 24th we can put out cookies and see if Father Christmas shows up," he joked, pouring John another cup of tea, then stuffing a few more cookies into his mouth.
Another giggle sounds from under the table. Sherlock gets down on his knees to see what it is, and a crème puff  is popped directly into the detective’s mouth, the music playing loud again, another puff, and Sherlock struggles to stand back up, whimpering, throwing out a hand to hit whatever just fed him, making contact with something that shrieks, followed by another two giggles from the other end of the table.
"You're-you're fine," John says, swallowing, "We'll get out of this... and er. Get you some new trousers."
Sherlock stood a short while after, leaving John groaning and reclining, with his trouser button undone. He returned with a pumpkin and a pecan pie and loads of whipped cream, setting them out on the table. He cut them each a slice of both and doused them in whipped cream before passing one to John. The army doctor groaned, but wriggled himself upright, propping the dish on his distended gut as he kept eating slowly but methodically.
Sherlock came moments after, panting, purring as John kissed and worshiped him, feeling perfectly crushed.
"Only if you feed it to me, and let me feed whatever greasy thing you brought home right back, piggy," Sherlock purred, leaning down to suck then graze one of John's plump breasts with his teeth, giving his gut a harsh slap before waddling towards his bedroom, pausing to lean against the doorframe, giving his wide hips a small roll
on cooking, so she's got a week to prepare just about every recipe she knows," Sherlock chuckled, then stood, crossing to his boyfriend and kissing the man's forehead.
He growled eagerly, reaching around behind to grab Sherlock's arse as he straightened again. His own portly body squashed flush with Sherlock's, his cock hard and pressing into plump thighs.
He hadn't drunk a drop of the fine wines, the excellent beers, or the astonishing array of liqueurs from all manner of countries near and far.
John moved over to the sofa again and sat down beside his lover, rubbing Sherlock's back gently. He pulled down the beard so he could speak properly.
John growled happily, shaking his arse, his hips jiggling, love handles wobbling, tits dancing as he tucked into more food greedily.
"Perhaps I'll order my portion separate. We might be hungry at the same time and...and maybe we'll get a bit more work done if we do it on our own," he offered, mind doing backflips.
Sherlock kisses him, and lets him go, wandering over to pull on his trousers and shirt again. John watches him through a daze, not entirely trusting himself to let go of the wall just yet.
"S'erlock, mm fine!" he manages to grunt out before Moran bends John in a way that makes  him worry  that it might very well snap his neck. John pants, looking at Sherlock desperately. He needs the detective’s help, but he doesn't want him to have to eat again, it only seems to get worse every time. John doesn't dare moving in this new position though.
He matched the bobbing of his head to John's quickening thrusts, feeling Greg's chubby fingers grip on his curls tighten
"How much do you reckon you would wiggle and shake if I fucked you like this?" John asked, his hands wandering down to smooth along Sherlock's flabby sides, cup his chest.
John swallowed, but managed a quick, "Thanks," before the man dashed off. He still looked lean as ever, but John imagined those burps louder, a pale belly growing rounder and fatter with each one and still wanting more.
"For our case at that orchard in Spain, you kept stuffing those oranges into your pockets as we dashed about the place. I would’ve bought a basket if you'd just said something," he laughed, finishing his tea, tummy groaning softly under his corset.
John is awash in pleasure, his cheeks flushed, heart pounding, breath gasping. He whimpers, nodding eagerly. He is far past full. Bloated, stuffed full of calories, purposefully letting himself go podgy and plump, piling on weight that everyone else seems to want to lose. What will they think of him when they see him huge, rolling, and jiggling. Captain Watson gone soft. Far past soft? Well and truly fat. A real porker. A lazy hog that only eats and sleeps and grows. Where there once was a whirlwind of fear, there is now barely a flutter. He wants this. He has always wanted this. And Sherlock, brilliant Sherlock, loves him enough to help him see it.
He smiled and accepted his new cup, eyeing Sherlock. He looked healthier lately, there was a glow to his skin, a sheen to his hair, a softness in his eyes.
"Let. Him. Go!" John growls. But then there are claws in his leg as the leader scrabbles at him from the floor. Without even thinking the soldier pulls back again and clubs her brutally over the head, not just once but twice, his face going steely and blank. She doesn't move. Her sisters have withdrawn into their chocolatey home.
"You didn't have to get me anything," he laughed, greedily taking the present and tearing off its paper.
He moved back into the living room, stifling a belch of his own as he set a package of biscuits before his flatmate, then his highly caloric tea.
Sherlock looked down to Greg, then hiccupped, followed by a massive, wet belch that echoed throughout the room
Sherlock shrugged and then loaded three thick slices of roast onto John's plate. To be fair, he took the same amount for himself. Then there were mince pies, buttery roasted vegetables, freshly baked rolls, and loads of thick savory gravy. John and Sherlock chatted and laughed with Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, shared cases that hadn't made it to the blog, and otherwise made merry as they ate and ate and ate. Mrs. Holmes cheerily pushed a new dish towards John whenever a clear space appeared. There was roast duck as well, mashed potatoes, fat strips of bacon, steak and ale pie... John utterly lost track of how much he was eating. He was full, then beyond full, then full to bursting with his trousers digging into his belly. But it was all delicious and too tempting to stop. Sherlock too seemed not to notice or mind as he loaded more food onto his lover's plate between bites.
He wet his lips again and leaned a bit closer. "What do you say you and I take leave of the rest of these boring well-to-dos and... have a more interesting discussion?"
John purses his lips, but allows this transgression in light of Sherlock’s submission. He even lets Sherlock feed him a good sized portion of the double chocolate peanut butter pie. Sherlock would still meet his calorie goal. The detective was fattening up nicely. Another set of new suits would be in order by the end of the week gauging by Sherlock’s increasingly demanding appetite. Ahead of schedule.
Then every last drop was inside him, and Sherlock collapsed back with a moan that was quickly replaced by a litany of burps. He couldn't seem to stop, his cheeks flushing pink, one hand on his bloated middle.
"I love you too," he said simply, then grinned, "If that was your best day, well, what's burgers and ice cream in bed going to rank as?"
"You were very good," said Father Christmas, his voice growing gentle as he reached out to put a gloved hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "Though, you might want to watch out about storing body parts in the flat without telling John in future."
John lets out a whine, blushing at the sound. He really has got to stop doing that. Breaks character.
Sherlock looks at the infamous James Moriarty, at his round, bulbous gut spilling almost to his knees - resting on fat, thick, flabby thighs. His ass, two near-yoga balls of pale flesh, rippling and shaking as he attempts to rolls forward far enough to get off of it, cylindrical, sausage-like arms swinging about him wildly as he throws a slew of curses at not just his usual nemeses, but at that "fucking bitch" who "did this to him."
"It looks good on you," John murmured near his lover's ear, his hands smoothing over his lover's hips and backside, "Feels good too."
God... if the detective knew that he hadn't taken an actual run in over a month. If he knew that John had instead spent that time eating and stuffing himself full at a shop of his choice... He crunched into more toast, humming softly. He snuck a glance at Sherlock. He was pleased to see the man eating as well. He like watching actually, that elegant neck bobbing, the jawline moving softly... It made him look less severe, more approachable.
He burped loudly and then reached for the carton again, flopping onto his side and rolling onto his well cushioned back, belly stuck up in the air as he dumped the lot into his mouth. His trousers too were growing tight around chubby thighs, his love handles blossoming out and untucking what remained of his shirt. Oh Christ this was heaven!
John’s hand is rough, but warm, and Sherlock finds himself smiling shyly as he’s tugged along, giving small burps and hiccups as the detective’s  stomach digests his "meal."
Strict diet. Hard work outs... no cakes. He swallowed, recalling the decadent foods that had been carted forward in the video. He chewed his lip.
The detective ends up knocking the wind out of both of them, and unluckily, Moran recovers first, stalking towards Sherlock as he struggles to crawl away on all fours, his stomach nauseous from so much sugar, his round arse wobbling, pale and smooth, in the open air.
"Full of lies? What are you on about?" asked John, raising his eyebrows. Then he had a suspicion. Was this to do with? No... not Sherlock. That would be-oh.
Once the whole Magnussen business had come to a close, Mary dropped the phony accent though she happily kept her new name. She proved to have grown up American and was content to leave her darker past behind her. Sherlock and John had some trouble trusting her again at first, particularly John. Sherlock did his best to help the two rebuild their trust. Mary's new more content, care-free, attitude at last melted through the last of John's reservations. In time, the three of them settled into their new life together (the baby having been another ruse).
Sherlock's parents turned out to be quite incredibly... ordinary. Mrs. Holmes was cheery and kind and tended to ramble on and on about any matter of things as she set dishes out on the large wooden table in the dining room. Mr. Holmes too was genial, nodding or interjecting into his wife's speech here and there. He seemed a good and quiet man. John found himself warming to him immediately. Sherlock's smile was undoubtedly his, where his eyes were passed down from Mummy Holmes. He saw that as she scanned the table again, looking for anywhere with enough space for yet another pot of potatoes.
"G-God! John! P-Please, please fuck me! Fuck your fat hog!" Sherlock begged, rolling his fat cheeks against the man's face
"You hold him, girls" shouts the siren at the two, slightly smaller ones, "I do love feeding up soldiers, though.” She lunges towards John
He smirked and pressed into Sherlock, his belly bumping into the detective. So he liked this? They both liked this? Oh God... he was going to get so fat over the winter...
John starts in on a sticky banoffee pie, his face covered in whipped cream. The two hogs grunt and eat contentedly, their masters stepping in to slide a particular sweet to them next or to prod their sides to check their progress, commenting on each other’s charges or spurring them on to eat more and more.
There's a heavy creaking noise behind John and he spins around, pocketing his cellmate's dodgy voice recorder. There's now a rectangle of light that illuminates the room besides the light source in the ceiling. A door.  John walks towards it, gun in hand, but creeps carefully around to conceal himself behind the wall as he peers out. It's dimly lit, but the walls are still unmistakably iced and browned.
A pentagram, but an unusual sort of kind. One meant to not only summon but contain, especially when summoning a spirit of desire.
"Harry told me when I was really young. I'd broken something of hers and she was feeling spiteful," explained John with a dry chuckle. He put his hat onto Sherlock's head.
John purchased larger sizes the very next day, his lazy Sunday proving to be quite the feast, and Sherlock seemed to have enjoyed himself too. It was... good to see. Really good.  And hot as hell. He didn't think he was ever going to be able to eat a meal in the same room with his flatmate again. Damn this newfound kink. But, Jesus, it was perfect! Sherlock was perfect.
He let his eyes slip shut and his imagination take over as he replayed the video, his finger trailing down to play with his puffed up navel, spreading over the bulge...
“Politely and… and patiently. Try not to upset them further,” Sherlock answered, his voice small and soft as he looked at Greg with wide eyes. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t thinking-“
