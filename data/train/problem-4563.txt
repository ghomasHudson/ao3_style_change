Castiel’s skin is slapping roughly against Deans as he fucks into him over and over with reckless abandon, “You can take it, Dean, you can. You’re doing so well… I’m nearly-- there…. Ahhhh shit.” Castiel pushes forward one last time, he is so deep inside Dean, buried completely and that’s when he comes, grunting and dripping sweat, wishing there was no condom between them.
Castiel moves, in and out, in and out… pressing himself further and deeper inside Dean, his pace picking up, the sound of Dean’s grunts of pain fuelling him. He ignores Dean’s begging, he disregards the man’s sobs, he believes - no he knows, that Dean wanted this, deep down. He’d wanted Castiel to fuck him, he’d wanted someone to take control of him, to use him, to worship him unforgivingly.
Dean frowns for a second before accepting the change of pace, "Sure, what have you got?"
"I can't believe he is awake, I mean, I knew that he had to wake up eventually, you know? Dean couldn't... Well, you know. But now that it's finally happening, I'll admit it, I was scared." Sam glances at Castiel's face, frowned with thoughtful lines, he reaches over and pats his knee, causing Castiel to jump and look up into Sam's face, "Sorry..." says Sam, "Didn't mean to make you jump, you ok though? You seem a bit... Oh, are you worried because he didn't remember you... Don't worry, he will. I'm sure it's normal, coma patients must get a bit confused when they first wake up."
‘So, today I had a meeting with someone who has given me some useful advice on a change of career. I know we don’t give details so I won’t go into it, but I am feeling really positive about it. It went really well. I hope you had a nice day? Shopboy’
Castiel closes his eyes as he pushes the door open, this might be the last time he ever sees Dean and a part of him knows that really, he should eliminate the threat to himself… But could he really bring himself to kill Dean?
“I know he would, you’re right. It’s just… he was my brother. I was meant to look after him…”
His heart is throbbing painfully inside him, his chest is rising and falling rapidly, he reaches the bottom of the stairs and looks around… Which way? The front door was right there… but what if it was locked? He turns the other way, sprinting forward down another short hallway. There are three doors, he tries the first handle he reaches, pulls the door open. Behind it, is a small closet, full of musty coats and shoes neatly stacked on a rack.
Coming all over my cheeks hopefully. =D
“Dean has suffered trauma to the base of his skull which has led to damage in the hippocampus region, causing retrograde amnesia. This has heavily affected his explicit memory.”
"Um. Yeah," Dean whispers. "That."
Cas relaxes when he sees Dean's soft, unbothered features, and he only lets his eyes linger for a moment before they're drawn to the movie Dean put on before going to bed. Onscreen, there’s an exasperated dark-haired woman— or perhaps a teenager— running through a maze of stone stairways that seem to defy the laws of physics. They turn this way and that, lining the walls and the ceiling and enclosing her in a many-tiered nightmare. She dashes madly toward a baby in a red and white striped jumpsuit, only to halt and run on in another direction when he vanishes and reappears in a different stairwell, further and further away from her each time. All the while, an older man with blond feathered hair and severe eyeshadow follows her, continually popping up in front of her and diverting her path. He’s singing to her, some sort of desperate love song, but it falls flat given the context of the scene. In a roundabout way, he seems to be mocking her futile attempts. He’s controlling their surroundings, Cas thinks, and being an ass about it.
“Christ Cas… You keep that up, I’m not gonna last”
“I can’t leave Sammy,” Dean shakes his head, “I won’t.”
"I think you look great," Said Jess giving him a big smile.
Castiel sighed dreamily at the thought of living on a boat, he wondered if he’d be able to sleep or if the rolling waves would keep him awake.
thinks Castiel nodding to Dean, but narrowing his eyes menacingly as Dean turns away.
"Fifteen Sir,"
“The bit where you said… you can’t have what you want.” Dean looks away, struggling to find words, struggling to silence the side of himself that has always fought against this moment… “I meant it, Cas, every time I said you were family, every time I said you’re my best friend, I meant it and I will always mean it. But… you mean so much more than that to me.”
“Dude… You’re my brother, don’t look at me right now! I’m an Asshole”
Castiel flops down on the bed and grins wide at Dean, “That was really nice…” He says as his breathing returns to normal. It was nice, but it hadn’t killed his desire to fuck Dean, he wanted to be inside him, he wanted to feel that hot tightness on his cock and push into it, over and over. He wanted to make Dean his again, by marking his insides with his come.
Absolutely not!
The next image, makes Dean gag. It's clear that it was taken in the very room that Dean was sat in. Dean's eyes take it all in at once, his blood feels like ice traveling through his veins.
Castiel was panting as Dean's lips moved from his own to his neck, licking and kissing and biting gently against the flesh of his throat, it was Dean-fucking-Winchester, Mr. Sex on legs, jacking him off in a back alley. Anyone could walk past, anyone could have seen them and Dean didn't seem to give a fuck. Despite the weeks of him avoiding Castiel, since their drunken kiss, despite him repeatedly telling Castiel that he was straight and that he'd been drunk and that it had been a mistake...
"That's a great idea," Said Charlie and Garth at the exact same time.
“Dean, what did you tell Sam about us spending the night together?”
His first night of freedom, he'd met Dean. If that wasn't fate... Castiel didn't know what was.
"I feel really shit about it, now that I've met you and everything... I am sorry Cas. If there is anything I can do..?"
Meg and Castiel nodded and the four of them headed out of the door, to find the nearest chip shop. Castiel’s mind still trying to process that Dean may be interested in him.
Castiel hears those words on repeat, he sees the look in Dean's eyes when he says them, the betrayal, the hurt...
Exactly, it just takes the edge off… Don’t have to worry about any poorly timed boners around Cas…
"Honestly, we have been getting slower Charlie... I mean his store isn't even open until Friday and we're already slowing down, people are waiting to buy their books at discount prices, who can blame them with Christmas around the corner... We've been almost an hour now... and no one's been in. I’ll admit it, ok I'm worried"
"Who got?" Asked Garth as he walked into the store. Castiel looked at him and his eyes widened in shock. He looked ill, very pale and with bags under his eyes, as though he hadn’t slept for a while.
Garth looked at her sadly, "The way I see it the internet is just another way for me to get rejected... so no."
Now, months later, it was Christmas Eve and he was listening to the tape Dean had labeled ‘Merry Christmas to my Angel’. He had never missed Dean more, he just wanted to curl up in bed with him, to hear him breathing softly next to him, to trace his fingers over his skin and count those beautiful freckles that littered Dean’s shoulders. He wanted to smell Dean’s homely scent, breath in deeply at his husbands neck and just bask in his warmth.
“Hey, Jess. How are you?” Says Dean squeezing her for a second before stepping back.
Castiel glanced down at Dean and smiled fondly, “You’re as close to heaven as you can be Dean and you’re perfectly safe. I promise you he can’t reach you here, not while we’re flying through the clouds.”
Barely able to draw breath, Dean will never know how he managed to meet Castiel’s eyes and almost beg him, “Please, don’t leave me!”
Dean wipes bitter tears from his eyes as he turns into Castiel’s embrace, clinging to the man as though the earth was opening up beneath him and Castiel was his lifeline. He sniffs deeply and then pulls back from Castiel giving him a watery smile.
John and Ellen looked past Dean to Castiel and smiled “Yeah,” Said Ellen “The book guy” This makes Dean smile to himself, thinking that that could be Castiel’s new handle, instead of ‘Shopboy’.
Castiel practically bounced out of the room, leaving Dean alone. The only thing Dean hated more than Castiel’s ‘affection’ was being left alone. The fact that Castiel had a job, shouldn’t have surprised Dean, but it had. The first morning after he’d been brought here, Castiel had woken him, tried to get him to eat - unsuccessfully - and then much to Dean’s horror, left him alone, cuffed to the bed for almost eight hours, wearing a towel wrapped around him like some kind of makeshift adult diaper.
Castiel is lying in bed, with his laptop on his lap messaging ‘Win67’ in between making notes for an adventure story, because he can do that now without having to worry about keeping Balthazar awake, he doesn’t have to worry about him at all.
"Wine, whiskey?"
He stepped into the room, his heart thudding in his chest as he closed the bedroom door quietly behind him...
Ow...ow..ow…...ohh OH OHHH Oh ok. MMMMMMFuckkkgeeeesuss
Sighing heavily he turns away from the fire and picks up his empty mug from the table, padding through the wooden cabin, passing the bare Christmas tree on the way to the kitchen, his eyes glance at the tree briefly as he passes it, it’s nakedness another reminder of Dean’s absence. Since they had been together, they had always decorated their Christmas tree together.
Dean doesn’t respond, he runs. He runs and he doesn’t stop to look back. He runs without knowing where he is or where he is going. He manages to keep hold of the towel, it whips out to his side as he hurries through the trees and deeper into the woods.
“What?”
Dean frowned at him slightly “Are you alright?”
“Haven’t you learned where you aren’t wanted yet?” Fires back Dean… he points to where Castiel is crumpled on the floor “Does he look like someone who wants you back? Who wants you anywhere near him?”
Well, that went well. Dean is so...
“I know, just be careful.” Lisa paused for a minute “Do you have plans for Thanksgiving?”
"That would kinda have been my fault in the first place..." Said Dean smiling guiltily at her.
Balthazar was straddling Dean’s waist, he looked about him, close to where they had landed, was Castiel’s little coffee table, with a vase in the center… Balthazar reached for it, gripping it tightly in his hands before turning back to Dean, the vase raised high in his arms. Dean’s vision finally cleared and he looked up to see Balthazar holding the porcelain vase, he frowned in concerned question.
Lisa smiles at him “I wanted to talk to you about Castiel”
Dean stayed behind with Sam and the kids “Alright guys, uncle Dean’s friend Castiel is going to be spending Thanksgiving with us, be polite, don’t be nosy and most of all… Do not let him win games night later on… Ok?”
Castiel though her idea might not be a bad one... He would ask Balthazar about it later, to see what he thought...
"Hmm. Well, I can't argue with my new boss" Charlie smiled at him, before leaning in close to his ear "Seriously though Dean, thanks for the job... You saved me from having to move back in with the parentals"
Charlie huffed at him as Castiel comes out of the bathroom.
“Because you can’t see what I see.”
“Son of a bitch!”
Dean looked at her in shock, "Why?" Dean had told Lisa when they had got together that he was bi-sexual, and she'd made it clear that didn't bother her in the slightest.
“SAY IT.” as Castiel shouts at him, Dean can feel flecks of sweat from Castiel's forehead raining down on to his back and ass.
‘That’s amazing, I just looked it up online. Glad those books can still be enjoyed instead of going to waste. And thank you for that, now I am craving pie… -_- . Anyway, it’s getting late and I have a few things I need to get done tomorrow, so I’m going to go to bed… Goodnight. Shopboy’
“This stuff smells great. You know he’s had it since Christmas and never used it!”
At exactly the same moment, their eyes meet and they lean into the fence, pressing against it until their faces have indents of red from the wire. Their lips find each other and part to deepen the already heated and desperate kiss. They murmur against each other's skin, as they struggle to embrace thanks to that infuriating wrought iron fence.
Castiel could still see Dean's arousal pressing against his pants, so he pulled his jacket from his shoulders and slung it over the bottom of the banister, "You punched Luke." he said, it wasn't really a question, Castiel just wanted to remind Dean how he'd ended up here, that it was he, Dean who had gone after Castiel tonight... Or at least, that's how Dean was meant to see it.
Castiel is shaking as Balthazar's hand on his throat turns his cheek back toward him, his eyes lower to Castiel's lips once more and he moves slowly forward, toward them. The hand on Castiel's crotch rubbing gently over it...
Sam gives him a sharp look. Dean knows he's rambling, but it's so important Cas knows this right now. It feels like the most important thing in the world.
rings out just as piercingly. Trees rustle and shake, signaling the approach of something strong, something sinister. The crow caws again and its fellow joins it, then another, and another, until the whole clearing is alight with the shouts of excited scavengers. They drown out the next series of cracks and pops, but they don't quite quell the strained human cries that follow.
from within makes both brothers jump. Dean presses his lips into a hard line and shakes it off. Sam raises his own flashlight and clicks it on, ever so slowly inching it into the opening. Dean cocks his gun and peers into the darkness.
His eyes land on the bulky movie case that’s been tossed beside the TV and reads the words
"I don't sleep, Dean. A shower is a nice way to relax."
, Dean, I just—” Cas sighs. “You were putting out a distress signal. I wanted to help.”
He covers the foyer, eyes scanning the vaulted ceilings and the bare decoration for any signs of life, finding none. The only other open door here leads to the drawing room, and Sam creeps toward it, gun held steadily aloft in front of him. Dean follows.
A middle-aged man in a beige trench coat stumbles into the clearing, falling almost immediately into the empty space on his hands and knees. His brown hair is wild and dirty, his button down spattered starkly with blood, his trench coat torn in many places and smeared with grime.
They don’t kiss again, but Dean scoots closer and presses their legs together. He leans into Cas’ side sleepily, unfrozen, the tension drained from his shoulders. They can talk later, ask questions when Dean’s had enough sleep, Cas decides. But for now, Cas reaches for Dean’s hand, and Dean responds easily, threading their fingers together, and that's a whole lot of answers as it is.
"...How long were you in there?"
Then someone shoves right in front of him, obscuring his vision, and Dean is gone. For a fraction of a second when Cas regains his view and a man in a dazzling white suit isn't in it, he worries Dean's been spooked— a trusted friend has hunted him down and caught him in this secret place, and now he has to flee.
"I'm sorry. Were they here, that morning?"
"Well… uh… blaze it," Dean holds the pipe up--
"Their condition likely will not affect me," Cas explains gently. "My grace will fight off most infections, certainly those of a monstrous nature."
Cas tenses up. "In your dream?" Dean nods once. "Well… I was in it. What you saw of me, that was… It was me."
“I just want you to know… We like having you around, Cas. If you’re in the area, you can visit us, you know. Even if it’s not business, you... You don’t have to stay away.”
That gets a response. Dean’s eyebrows shoot up. Sam sits up straight. “She saw what happened?” Sam asks.
Cas has never been sensible, though. He steps closer in spite of himself, drawn compulsively toward Dean's wordless prayer. And just like that, he knows he can't find it in himself to leave.
He thinks about it for a little too long.
Cas takes a deep breath and invites the stillness to settle into his bones. Perhaps he himself is not human, but his vessel is, and he's found that he benefits from certain human activities. He enjoys them, even. Quiet time to himself when no one else is awake is among his top favorites, and he’s decided several hours ago that this is the particular experience he’s looking forward to tonight. He picks himself up from the map table and strolls down the hall to begin the first thing he knows he craves, the thing that Jimmy would be craving if he had just helped get rid of a particularly nasty poltergeist and wedged himself into the backseat of a classic automobile for another six hours after that.
Dean looks up in disbelief. It takes him a second to understand that he's not hallucinating and the gravelly voice that's just ordered does, in fact, belong to Cas.
look down, there's the barrel of a twelve gauge pointing directly at his chest.
Still silent, Sam motions toward the backdoor that's just off to the right side of the kitchen. It's hanging off one hinge, and as they step closer, they can see a crumpled screen door lying in the grass, illuminated by the porch light outside.
"But you're an angel, so--" Dean gestures in Cas’ general direction. "We'll see."
Dean pops the plastic cover off the pie with some effort and digs in with one of the forks Cas thoughtfully included in the snack bag. His eyes flutter when the apple zings sweetly on his tongue, somehow unparalleled by any pie experience he's ever had.
Dean can't help himself laughing in response. It’s contagious.. "What, like you don't? You're all--" He waves at Sam’s face, forgetting what he's trying to say. "Squinty eyed," he completes after what feels like an eternity.
Sam squeezes the bridge of his nose and closes his eyes. “I think we should check on her. If she
, they can't let him go back to
He glares at Cas. “What are
Missy’s shoulders relax as she seems to come to a decision. "Yeah?” she says, and her voice comes out thick and a little muffled, like she’s been crying, and— oh,
Instead, he’s unnerved.
"Please… call me Missy." She bends down and gives Sam a soft, sweet peck on the cheek while she takes the card. Sam's skin prickles with heat where she's touched it. "Thank you…"
This is a love song.
Both of their doors click shut from within the bunker's halls. There's a muffled shuffling as the two hunters prepare for bed, and within twenty minutes or so, the bunker shifts into nighttime silence.
“Cas, did you… take a shower?”
"Sam," Cas says. "It's good to see you."
Some sixty yards away from them, the barn awaits, an unmoving solid shadow rising up into the darkening sky. Dean takes his flashlight from his jacket and jerks his head—
tall.
Dean opens his mouth like he’s going to argue, but gets distracted before he can. He's looking at a point above Cas' head, perplexed. Cas glances behind him and doesn't see anything out of the ordinary.
"Dean? Sam? Is everything alright?"
"It was stress," she says, but the words are hollow. "He did that sometimes. Instead of goin' back to drinkin', he ate."
Then Dean looks up at him, expression guarded and inscrutable. "Uh, about what I… did. In the dream…” He blows out a breath. “Dreams are so weird, you know, they’re not what you want in real life. I mean, hell, I’ve had a dream where Clint Eastwood—” He cuts himself off. “Uh. Point is, you never know what wacked out shit is going to happen in dreams. It doesn’t mean anything, right? We’re friends. You know I would never—" he gestures vaguely in Cas' direction, "—in real life."
He’s kept himself from visiting Dean’s dreams for a long time, worried that it's too intrusive, too inhuman of him. He flexes his fingers with a little hesitation before he finally presses them to Dean’s temples, closing his eyes and letting himself drift out to sea.
Cas steps further into the motel room, sees the pipe and the baggy on the floor, and says, "So, how do you do it?"
“Whatever you say.” Dean snuggles drowsily into Cas’ side again, then yawns. “I gotta get back to bed, buddy.”
Dean stands there for a second, grinning, drinking in the crow’s feet around Cas’ eyes. He knows this is a vessel, that he’s not looking at
for the people to read, you understand.” Ullman pulls open a drawer and produces two crisp file folders, tossing them onto the desk. Neither Winchester reaches for them, but Dean leans forward in his seat in anticipation. “I knew word would get out sooner or later. Shouldn’t be surprised that y’all were so quick in gettin’ here, what with the first one of you boys in here yesterday askin’ questions.”
He makes himself pull away too soon, all too mindful of the conversation that led to this moment. When he opens his eyes, Dean is staring at him starrily, mouth parted in subdued surprise, and that eases some of Cas’ doubts. Cradling Dean’s face in his hand, Cas thinks this might be the only moment he’ll think about for the rest of time.
It's a well-worn ritual with humans, especially hunters, to offer a bed when it’s been a long day and it's too late to be driving home. They’re predisposed to look out for each other. So when Cas stumbles into the bunker after helping out with another grueling hunt and Dean asks him to
Miles and miles of rolling green hills, just starting to yellow in late September's dying sun, stretch out in all directions to encompass them in Kansas countryside. The rumble of the road from the inside of the Impala while it flies down Highway 36 is a gentle, familiar comfort that lets Dean's mind wander and calms the ever-present restlessness that seems to have made its permanent home in his bones lately.
“Dangerous, I know.” Cas keeps an eye trained on his plate and the clean, bare bone there, but he pushes it away, not touching his fries. Dean is scandalized. “Dean has already let me know that, on no uncertain terms.”
They round the side of the barn and immediately freeze as Dean’s flashlight finds what’s around the corner. Someone or
That's another thing Cas has learned is pleasurable both as a human and as an angel. Smiling when he's pleased about something. It feels natural on his face, warm and tugging at the corners of his eyes. It feels good.
“Why were you watching this particular film before bed?”
"Sure," Cas says levelly, sitting down on the floor and frowning at their supplies in concentration. "Though, I will confess that I've never done this before."
When he'd initially heard the song, he'd been almost sick to his stomach. The lyrics were dismal at first listen. Hopeless. A classic case of humans mourning their ephemerality, grieving the temporary human experience next to the glory of all of time and space and the things they don't understand.
Cas halts, turns around. Lingers.
"Sam said you're flying solo now," Dean says before he can stop himself. He bites his lip. He's talking about Hannah, of course, but he doesn't want to say her name.
Cas saves him from certain embarrassment by doing what they both do best: averting the conversation, smoothing it over with business. "I've been checking over the bodies since yesterday. Howard and Darrell— they've met the same fate. Whatever they're turning into, it's… something new. Nothing I know of."
he’s keeping back almost audible in the following silence, but he dutifully flips the cover of his iPad open on his lap and finds the case file he put together this morning.
"You did drugs?" he says incredulously.
“Yes. I can feel when someone needs me.” He thinks back to the ballroom, Dean's search through the crowd. His bright, glassy doe eyes when he was caught. “Or… wants my presence.”
Speechless, John just shakes his head and looks at Victor.
I’m bigger.
"Honestly... I don't think I've ever seen him this wasted" Said Garth seriously "And add that to the shop shutting today and him having to sell the till. I don't know..."
Castiel’s sitting awkwardly in the front seat of his car, looking through the photo album of him and Dean. His fingers trace around the outline of Dean’s smile softly. Castiel sighs and looks out of his car window, the sun is just starting to rise and again, he has barely slept. How could he sleep whilst not knowing if Dean is alive or dead?
So……….. Being the smoothness king… I’ve offered to sponsor him. It’s all for a good cause after all. So, I may have given him my number, so he can send me the details… or whatever… ;-)
‘My store closed a few weeks ago, did I ever tell you that I owed a store? It was a lovely store. I guess I didn’t mention it though as I’ve tried not to go into detail about work as it seems like the kind of personal stuff we weren’t supposed to give away. Anyway, it closed and I was heartbroken and now, this morning, I walked passed it… They are turning it into a GameStop which just depresses me further. The thing is, I’m angry and hurt and I don’t know what to do with that, the reason my store had to close, a man I thought of at first as having a cash register where his heart should be, is actually not the person I had believed him to be. He is becoming a close friend and I feel bad for thinking poorly of him, but also I feel… it would have been easier if he wasn’t such a nice man... Shopboy'
‘I think I would like to try it, one day. Don’t think I’d be much help when it came to killing it though. As for Thanksgiving… I’ve been kind of ignoring that holidays approach the last few weeks. For the last couple of years, my partner and I had thrown little get-togethers and celebrated with some friends and growing up it was always my mothers favorite holiday, she’d cook and decorate. This year, I think I am just going to stay at home and watch old movies, oh that sounds really depressing, doesn’t it? But the truth is, it is going to be my last Thanksgiving in this house and I just want to relax in my own company with a good book. Shopboy’
Castiel rolled his eyes and cut Balthazar off before he got going on how important it was to open the store on time, "Alright, alright, I'm getting up. I was only half serious anyway."
The afternoon brought with it more customers. 'Finally', thought Castiel as people started coming in with their children who had dragged them over to the window to stare in wonder at the racing broomstick.
not just desired to do things..."
"She went in to see how Charlie is doing..." Said Castiel, Garth nodded. In the brightly lit hospital, Castiel could now see the small cut on Garth’s cheek which was red and his cheek was starting to darken around it into a bruise "Garth.." He began but Garth held up his hand and stopped him.
Castiel's hands reached around Dean's waist, touching his skin, groaning softly at the feel of those firm muscles. His hand dipped below the waistband of Dean's hot pants and gripped his cock. Castiel was pleased that Dean was half hard...
“Where’s Castiel?” asks Dean furiously. A part of him scolds himself, it’s not like Castiel has treated him any better than this man but even so Dean really wishes that Castiel was here now. Something about this man, the things he has said… Dean just knows instinctively, he is in serious danger.
That's when he heard it, a wailing singing, coming through the water and reaching his ears. The song - if that's what you call it - sounded harsh on his ears, like screaming. Something whipped past him in the sea, his body spun with it. Was it a shark? Fuck... His vision was blurring as he began to drown, he didn't want to be eaten, but at least it would be quick he figured...
Castiel tilts his head, “So, yes?”
“Oh, and that delivery came yesterday. Do you want me to keep it for you for now or bring it to the boat? I’d need help to lift it, the box is really heavy.”
Ah well, at least no animals took a dump on me today… Cute guy was cleaning his windows, stood up on a tiny step ladder in a black tank top… THOSE FUCKING ARMS. You could write poetry about those arms…
Dean is frozen, not in the literal sense, but in the sense that his fear has reached the absolute limit, he can stand. He could move, but with the exception of his obvious trembling, he can’t… He could speak, but he can’t. He sits perfectly still, staring ahead, the smell of his own vomit and sweat fills his nostrils on each sharp breath in. The sounds of Balthazar moving around behind him, seem to crawl over his skin, moving from his left side to his right, as though his body is tracking Balthazar’s movements, ready to warn him if the man gets to close again.
Dean suddenly slammed Castiel against the wall, meeting his lips in desperation and heat, his hands leave Castiel's arms to claw at his clothes. Castiel moans into Dean's mouth and let himself be manhandled. He'd let Dean take control, he'd let him set the pace and Dean's pace was far faster than Castiel had expected, he was already ripping off Cas' shirt, sending a spray of buttons scattering across the floor. Which Castiel decided was to incredibly hot to be annoyed about.
Dean seemed to eventually snap out of it and turned back to the table.
Finally, his car screeches to a halt outside the house. He sprints to the front door, up the stairs, down the hall, skidding to a halt in the open doorway to the kill room, he feels his heart as it rips in two at the sight of the empty chair in the middle of the room.
Dean’s lip quirks in a barely there smile as his eyes flick over Castiel’s lips… “Cas… I wish I’d been brave enough… to love you.” He whispers with his last quivering breath…
Life without Balthazar was actually really nice. For the first time in years, Castiel lived alone. He knew he would have to move soon and he'd already begun looking for a new place to live but he found he didn't mind so much now. With Balthazar's things all gone now, the apartment seemed slightly too big.

Sometime later, he doesn't know how long but Dean wakes, his eyebrows pinching together in a confused daze at the weighty feeling of something on his chest. Tilting his head and opening his eyes slightly, he realizes he and Castiel must have moved closer together in their sleep... much closer together.
“Keep it in your pants.”
Castiel looks at her with a brow raised, Meg rolls her eyes, "Well, they must be upstairs somewhere if you wanna go get them so bad…”
Dean’s eyes meet Balthazar’s, terrified.
Castiel looked back at the mirror in front of him taking a deep breath before saying "Oh well, at least today's not going to be a complete loss"
Castiel had gone back to bed shortly after Charlie had left that morning, still hungover and if he was honest a bit pissed that Balthazar hadn't returned his earlier 'favor'. He frowned "What time is it?"
“Not yet… He keeps saying he might have to move, I think I am going to wait until he does and have it delivered to his new address.” ‘
"A pealing one," said Castiel, smiling before adding, "You got any mixers? I have some vodka..."
After his shower he dried quickly and walked back into the bedroom completely naked - if Balthazar was asleep again it wouldn't matter and if he wasn't - maybe Castiel could change his mind about making him late for work. Balthazar was asleep. So Castiel dressed quickly and went to the kitchen, clearing away the takeaway leftovers and rubbish and putting on a fresh pot of coffee. Making sure there would be enough left for Balthazar to have one after he left. He walked into the living room and noticed his disregarded laptop, on the armchair where he had left it the night before. He picked it up and carried it to the kitchen. He set it down on the table and opened it.
The lady smiled, “It will be ready in about a week?”
Dean’s lips twitch as a shiver runs down his spine.
Jo looked at Dean "Hi… I'm Jo, I'm kinda with Garth. Since you kinda saved the day, I'll fill you in... Balthazar threatened Garth last week because we were out on a date and saw him having dinner with another man behind Castiel's back"
He suddenly understood why he was so angry with Dean... Not only had Dean been the reason Castiel had had to close his shop, but he hadn't even had the decency to allow Castiel to hate him for it, instead he’d turned out to be this caring, remorseful man.
“Dean!” Castiel pulled back, eyes widening. Dean saw the fear in his eyes as his gaze looked passed him. Before Dean could even turn around, a hand had gripped his shoulder and pulled him back with such force that he was thrown backwards, stumbling to the floor.
Fine, don’t let me get off… go back in the dark and stay there…
After the meal, Dean agreed to stay over as he’d drank too much to be able to drive… and if that had been Castiel’s plan, well who needed to know? Castiel had helped Dean strip down to his boxers and then guided him to his bed, he kissed his way all over Dean’s body, watching with heat in his eyes as Dean’s cock stiffened before him.
Soapy water and a big sponge, mower… all set up near the front of my lawn, I can see the whole way down the street from here. Perfect…
Shaking the tempting thoughts of his friend from his mind he lay down, his back to Castiel's front. That was safe, right? ‘Normal’? He pulled the sheets over them both, falling asleep not long later, as the warmth from the comforter washed over him.
He weeps openly into his son’s chest, until he feels warm wetness seeping into his shirt… Confused he releases his hold on his boy and leans back to find, he is no longer in the hospital, now it seems he is knelt in a field. The grass is wet with morning dew. And where only seconds earlier he could have sworn Jack's body was now…
Oh god… He’s taking his jacket off, he is taking his jacket off… He’s offering me his fucking jacket - excuse me while I pass out from cuteness overload.
Castiel allowed himself a grin "Yes. He was Charlie's doctor, that night Balthazar... well… that night. He gave me his number that night actually, but I never called him, it was too quick and I just wasn’t interested. But now, I don’t know? Bumping into him today kinda feels like fate... I first meet him when I lose Balthazar and now again today when I'm losing my shop... Weird huh?"
THE END
“Hey, I um. I wanted to speak to Dean, do you know what time he will be back?”
‘I got some good news today actually. My friend who visited had some news. That cheered me up. Shopboy’
Walking out of the police station, looking tired and worried Castiel turned to Dean “Do you want to come back to mine now?”
And he had to do it, tonight.
“I think you saw him, I think you…” Gabriel’s eyes flicker down to the front of John’s shirt where there are specks of red - blood and then to his right hand, where his knuckles are red raw, before finding John’s eyes again. Gabriel grinds his teeth, stepping forward into John's space, “Jesus… what did you do to my little brother?”
"But I do"
Castiel can't bear it. He pulls a bottle of whiskey from his cupboard, he'd started keeping a supplying for when Dean ran out, always on hand with a fresh bottle for the hunter after a stressful day. He opens the bottle and drinks. The more he drinks, the more the volume on Dean's words in his head turns down.
“DEAN!”
“Ohh… Yeah!”
“Shut up, bitch” Said Dean rolling his eyes at his brother.
"Uh Oh," said Sam, Dean could practically feel him smiling down the phone, "Not the dreaded salad."
“No, we can afford three more people Sam and it’s coming up to Christmas, you know it will be busier then, who better to hire than people who need jobs and already know the business?”
"I know, you have to go or it will never get published" Nodded Castiel, understandingly “I’d make sure I could take the weekend off but with Winchester’s store opening, I really need to be to keep an eye on things”
Castiel had been about to say that he would be fine, but as he looked at Dean an idea struck him "Do you think..." He cut off shaking his head.
Castiel clicks the ‘play’ button again, it’s the ninth or tenth time he has listened to it now. The soft strumming of the guitar begins, quickly followed by Dean’s voice. Singing out smooth, soothing notes. Just for him.
“Dean?”
“See, here is what I think,” says Gabriel staring daggers at the older man, this was it. This was the speech he and Castiel had planned, don’t fuck up now, “I think you beat on Dean, I think your homophobic ass couldn’t stand the thought of Dean being with my brother, I think you beat your boy black and blue. I think that you beat him so bad that Castiel left here to go and try and help Dean… maybe get him out...”
“N-no, you just caught me off guard was all,” Dean managed, shifting himself to get a little more comfortable. What he wasn’t expecting was a surge of pleasure, shocking through him like a bolt of lightning, as the angel’s tongue experimentally licked the tip. Dean could feel his face heating up and he groaned low in his throat when he felt the angel’s lips engulf the head of his cock completely. He could feel Castiel’s tongue rolling over his aching tip. Castiel moved his lips along the shaft which caused the hunter to gasp. Dean desperately tried to contain himself, not wanting to buck up and into the angel's throat, but he was quickly losing control. “Fuck...”
Charlie shook her head, muttering to herself, "Leaving your laptop open and unattended Cas - tut-tut. He really is asking for this." She shimmied forward on her seat and grabbed the laptop, typing quickly...
"I saw him hit her, and I can't stand seeing a guy about a foot taller beating on a woman, fucking big man, ya know?" Said Dean remembering seeing it play out before him "So I ran at him, think I got a couple of hits in before I lost my balance and he kicked me in the ribs"
And slowly… again. Again. Again. In in innnnn… Ohhh, fuck I can’t breathe. Out again! - deep breath - and INNNNNNNNN. YES. Past the goalie and right to the back of the net…
"And Thursday night?" Said Cas looking at her expectantly.
Alright, sport. Time to lay down your best moves… What have you got?
"I'm not gay." says Dean again as he stops in front of Castiel, his eyes darkening as he reaches for his hips and pulls him forward so that their bodies are pressed against each other, "but there is more than a strong chance, that I may be bisexual and a stronger chance still... that if you hadn't come waltzing into my life, I would never have known."
What other jobs could I do in the garden?
Dean stared at the message, then he laughed... '
Castiel walked on down the street, zipping up his jacket against the bitter November chill. He wiped bitterly at his eyes as he headed towards the grocery store. He needed coffee amongst other things.
“I just don’t trust him… with you.” says Dean louder and unmistakably angry. It was enough to catch Castiel off guard, Dean seizing the moment to advance once again, Castiel trapped between the wall and the hunter. “If you got hurt, if he hurt you, what would we do then? What would I do then, Cas?”
He hadn't realized how much space Balthazar had taken up, it had seemed to work out that Castiel had bought all the bulky furniture, the bed, the table and chairs, the sofas, dresser, and wardrobe... But all the little decorative touches had been Balthazar's, except for Castiel’s books of course. He’d kept a few of his favorites from the shop and sold the rest to an online story that would then sell them on.
"Boo," Said Meg. Charlie didn't speak. She just looked at Castiel as though studying him.
"What?" Asked Castiel as he slowly got to his feet, stopping to look at her.
A few moments later Castiel's reply flashed up
Castiel sighed, "As I say, he's been working a lot. Yes, I wish he was at home more, I wish we spent more time together, it seems like forever since we talked properly… but it’s just a patch, we can get through it."
“Oh, fuck… fuck!” Dean’s crying out almost instantly, “I’m going to come, Castiel… Please, please? Let me? Castiel?”
“I’m sorry,” Said Balthazar slowly “I hurt you… and I hurt your friends. That is not something I ever wanted to do. I know I have made mistakes, but please… We can fix this. I just want to come home, I just want you back”
"Sure," Said Castiel looking back to Doctor Lafitte "The other man they came in with, Dean Winchester, do you know where he is?"
“Oh, and what happens to people who go on your naughty list Cas?” Dean asked eyes glinting as he stepped closer.
“Nice suit,” smirked Dean, stepping forward and putting the glass of whiskey in his hand down on the coffee table, “You know that Jacks sleeping, right?”
“So, how did you and Dean become friends in the first place, as you mentioned earlier, we didn’t all get off to the best start,” Asked Lisa curiously.
He uncuffs Dean’s other arm and takes a few more pictures, him kissing Dean’s cheek lightly, him wrapped around Dean, him smiling up at the camera with Dean’s face just behind him.
“You don’t have to apologise Dean, not to me.”
“Not yet… Let’s show these two fools what we’re really capable of… Then they will never want to separate us again”
Dean is still naked, except for his blindfold, of course, which has been neatly positioned back over his eyes. He’s bolted to the floor by an ankle strap on each leg. There are two short chains holding them down, he has a cuff on each wrist that is connected to a chain that hangs down from the ceiling. His arms are chained up and spread wide. Castiel’s come is slowly oozing from his hole. He can hear nothing, but his own breathing and do nothing but wait for Castiel to return, so he waits.
Michael shook his head. "I want to leave her, you know that... But coming out would ruin my career."
Castiel got in, locked his door behind him, no point in getting careless after the warning he’d been given about Balthazar and gone to run himself a hot bath. He’d let himself enjoy the hot water until his feet were pink and crinkled, the water had soaked warmth into his muscles and washed away a lot of the stress of the day.
“Ok… So… basically humans are the only animals that cover up with clothes… See that guy…”
Smooth talker…
"What's going on man?" Said Charlie, turning her head to look into Garth’s face “You know if you need us, me and Cas are always here, right?”
Meg shrugs unconvinced, “You coming in tomorrow?”
"It's not like just any old till... it's old and Cas loves it, but he thinks he is going to have to sell it..." Said Charlie gravely “The shop was passed down to him from his mom you know? I think it’s a family thing. Special to him…” Dean was about to say something else when Charlie suddenly gasped "Oh my god, look, guys, isn't that the Doctor from that night... Bobby... No Benny?"
Balthazar’s legs were pointed out at odd angles, the bones could be seen protruding through his bloody and tattered trousers and his knife was cutting into his own flesh. His face was pale from blood loss.
Dean rolled his eyes, "Fine but I won't have my car tomorrow Sam, it's being towed into the garage - it crapped out on me this morning."
Dean climbed carefully on to his boat, wincing at the pain in his ribs. He realized he hadn't even taken any of the painkillers yet and went to get a glass of water and take one straight away. Then he pulled out his phone to turn it too loud…
“Good”
Sam waves his hands in front of him “Sorry, that came out wrong. I just mean… Why are you asking about that?”
"You got in a taxi wearing that," Castiel said laughing, "You are brilliant."
Thanks Cas, I’ll text you tomorrow. X NN
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck.” grits out Dean, half in annoyance, half in arousal.
Castiel’s face broke out into a huge smile “That’s great, Garth. When are you going to ask her?”
Dean laughed “Bacon bagels for breakfast it is”
owned ‘fat pants’.” Says Castiel sounding serious before adding “I’ll have to make do with stretchy pajama bottoms”
“Well… I just thought…”
Dean’s eyes widen at the weirdness of being sniffed, he tries to tug his wrist free, but the ropes are strong and he is still dizzy from being drugged.
Then appeared the second message and Dean clicked on it.
"Castiel I really don't think..." began Balthazar.
Castiel is smiling at me, with that cute fucking head tilt… Screw this… I’m going in…
Balthazar shakes his head weakly and watches Castiel’s approach with soft eyes and a small smile. He tries to speak, but his throat is dry and the mask over his mouth makes the groaned words sound fuzzy and unrecognizable.
He turns away, throwing himself down the stairs as fast as his legs can carry him.
'You have nothing to be sorry for Cas. Will you be alright though? Dean'
"Come now Castiel. Your business is about to go under, how can you possibly afford to live here, without me? And seeing as how your friends... if you can still call them that, work for you and are also about to be out of work, it's not like they will be able to help you out"
The door creaks as it opens and Balthazar’s face comes into view, he looks taken back at the sight of the two men but before he can even ask who they are John has pushed his way into the room. Sam follows looking less confident and quickly shuts the door behind him.
Castiel huffs as he pulls his hand away, sounding annoyed as he says, “Honestly, Dean, I don’t know what you were trying so hard to get back to the world is a horrible place. I’m keeping you safe from it in here, can’t you understand that? You’re far too special to be lost in that sea of dull and ordinary people out there… You like it here with me, don’t you? You love being the center of my world?”
As Dean walked out of the bathroom, Lisa was walking towards him, "Hmm. You smell nice" she said in approval whilst trying to pass him. He leaned towards her, trying for a kiss but she pulled away rolling her eyes, "This suit is dry clean only Dean."
"Well?" Dean asks Cas when he's done basking in the euphoria of physical contact.
Dead runs a hand over his face. “Right, yeah. I’ll be there in a few.”
The question is warm and soft, just a simple invitation, not a demand. Dean opens his mouth and almost,
? A T-bone, no less? This has to be a parallel universe.
Well.
"I mean, I know I’m a regular Don Juan,” Dean says, with a strained, flirty grin that drops off his face almost as soon as it appears. “But I can’t, I… I wouldn’t.”
“Yeah, well. I’m glad we’re here to help, anyway,” Dean grumbles, snagging a fry from Cas’ plate. Cas fidgets idly with his napkin, shredding it into small pieces with his fingers. The bits begin to pile up on the remains of his T-bone, and Dean rescues a few fries that are in the line of fire before he goes on. “We don’t know crap about this thing, what it is, how it’s spreading, why it’s here. So… Let’s do some research, figure out—”
"I don't think it's doing anything."
gesture. “See you there,” he says to Cas, and Cas gives him one last little exasperated sigh and an upturn of the lips before he’s getting into his car by himself and Dean is walking away from him, clutching his keys tightly in his hands.
, when she answers. "Yes, actually. It didn't seem like much at the time, but. Now that I think about it, he was… eating a lot. Left for the store just before dark for s'more groceries. Didn't come home."
Dean beelines for the clock. He runs past a few tables and scatters the people sitting there, reaches the mirrored wall, and stops. His reflection warps and grows on it, larger than life as he spins around, searching for something. He catches Cas’ eyes one last time, beautiful and terrified, a deer who’s finally found the reason to bolt— and then he grasps the nearest chair and hefts it into the air, bringing it down in a swinging arc that lands squarely on the mirror.
"Did you…" Dean points at Sam once they're alone again. "Did you just—"
“Murders?” Sam asks with surprise. “I thought the newspapers said it was a coyote.”
on the screen. He squeezes his eyes shut. Wistfully, he swipes the green button and holds the phone up to his ear.
“Sounds like something changed,” Dean mutters, just quiet enough so that Ullman doesn't catch it, but the next photo makes him pause. He holds it up. “Who’s this?”
"Yeah." Sam presses a button on the bottom a few times, and a light flashes. "It's heating up. So." He gestures to Dean's hands. “Are you gonna let that smoke itself, or…"
“Miss Duvall was found two days ago. She’s missin’ the entirety of the bones in her left leg, plus a portion of her hip, some vertebrae, and a few ribs,” Ullman says to them levelly. He’s not going over the coroner’s reports that are next in the folder; he's staring straight ahead, reciting the facts with the dead eyes of a man who’s been spending sleepless nights going over every fiber of this case. “Mr. Nichols is missin’ all but one of his ribs, both hands. Parts of his sternum. Clavicle.”
"No… oh, no," he groans. He reaches his other hand inside his coat and fishes for something, but doesn't seem to find whatever it is he's looking for.
And all of the sudden they're laughing. The thought is ridiculous, and Dean feels a force pulling at the corner of his eyes, a lightness in his chest that makes him want to smile, and he knows it's hitting him. But, thankfully, he finds that he’s not nervous. This is just Sam, after all.
He pats the bed again, and this time, Cas accepts the invitation. He sits in the middle of the bed and crosses his legs to fit, his knee brushing Dean's hip. Sam follows suit, situating himself on the end of the bed with his legs dangling off at a diagonal, his head resting on Dean's ankles.
Cas smiles and lays back on Dean's legs, and Dean feels his own eyes closing happily. It's not long before he drifts into the most peaceful sleep of his life, surrounded by the people he loves.
Sam rummages in the bag too, bringing out some kind of kettle chips that Dean doesn't care about, and makes his way to sit beside Dean. Both of them lean against the headboard, lax. Normally, Dean would tell him to fuck off to his own bed, if he were that close. But today-- today he’s savoring how he has his brother and his angel in the same room. And instead of hunting, they’re
He beelines for the coffee pot once he’s in the kitchen, familiar with where to find the grounds and the caramel flavored creamer that Sam keeps in the fridge. Dean drinks it black, but Sam confided in him once that coffee with creamer tastes much better, even if Dean won’t admit it. Under cover of the early hours of the morning, Cas often takes Sam's advice in this matter. Sometimes he drinks it black, too, just to try and understand why Dean does it.
And Cas almost lets him. He leans into Dean himself before he has the stupid, piercing thought that if this is Dean’s first kiss with a man, and Dean thinks it’s a dream? That would be taking advantage, wouldn’t it. Cas will never forgive himself. Besides, he knows Dean. And Dean doesn’t want this.
After a good half hour, when his vessel is warm and his muscles are relaxed and he smells like Dean’s shampoo, he turns the water knobs off with a rusty squeak. Perhaps that's what humans mean when they say they're squeaky clean.
"Didn't even make it to his car, looks like." Sam scrolls to a new page. "Third was found in the park last night. Danika Lloyd, 19. No immediate connections between the vics. All three bodies were ripped to shreds, parts missing… The article is pretty vague. They're blaming it all on animal attacks."
Sam knows that everyone processes loss in their own way, of course. It's what he tries to consider every time he knocks on the door of a victim's family, anticipating that he will have to tread lightly no matter what situation he walks into. But he expects this kind of behavior from Dean, not from a grieving woman in the Kansas countryside. He is so baffled by this turn of events that it takes him a good few seconds to think of any questions relevant to the case.
Cas hasn't done it himself, but he's seen enough movie scenes to know that it's not a difficult affair. He's sure Dean's done it before. At a beginner's level, he thinks he can probably get away with some basic, uncomplicated swaying that will get the job done.
"So, what, he's our guy?"
Something stirs in Cas’ face, and Dean can see it happen.
His eyes slide past Cas to the Lincoln, which gleams in the parking lot lights that are just beginning to turn on. “So, still riding in the old pimpmobile, huh?”
He levels out two scoops— Dean has let him know that one scoop makes the coffee "weak" and is "for bitches" and since Dean tends to have a better compass for taste than Sam does, Cas trusts him on it. He fills the coffee pot all the way to the twelve cup line and starts the machine, planning to sip on this for the next several hours.
"Okay. I'll give Missy a visit, see if she can shed some light on what happened to Darrell," Sam decides, and starts to get into the car until he sees Dean smirking at him. "What?"
The next
"Another strange thing," Sam says, ignoring his pouting brother. "Missy said that Darrell was eating a lot the day before his death. Maybe trying to satisfy the craving, like a rugaru.
Missy opens the door all the way and lets Sam through. As he steps over the threshold into a grand foyer with vaulted ceilings, he catches the heady smell of meat cooking from somewhere deeper in the house. She shows him through a doorway immediately to the left of the entry, a more modest drawing room decorated all in soothing tones of blue and white, and waits until he sits down on the couch before she excuses herself.
“See you,” Sam says, and hangs up.
Sam studies Dean's face. "Dude. You have, like, the worst high eyes I've ever seen." He laughs.
"Did this place have a vending machine?" Dean asks hopefully, gazing up at the popcorn ceiling and trying to discern shapes. Hmm, he thinks he can see an angel in there.
he saw Howard the day before— he stopped and talked to him while he was out getting donuts."
He's pondered often what it is about this book that affects him so much. Maybe it's that this was the first book he read as a human, the first time he truly experienced what it was like to let yourself get lost in a story. Maybe it's because he simply likes romance. Maybe it's because he fancies himself in the ghost's place, something that doesn't belong on earth being wanted and useful to someone he loves, appreciated and loved in return, even if that someone is human. It makes his heart ache with the want to save someone closer to him from the darkness of the world, though he knows he can't. He tries not to dwell on that.
Dean oogles the stash Sam has in his hand. "Sammy, how much weed do you have?"
Dean is mortified.
"Cas?" Sam sits all the way up. "You want to call
“Good, thank you. Would you like a drink?”
Dean hesitated for a moment, as though he hadn’t expected him to stop “Cas… I’m just… I am really sorry…” His pleading eyes still held Castiel’s gaze, his hand was still on Castiel’s arm and something broke within him, some wall inside him shattered and crumbled away. Castiel leaned forward into Dean, who hugged him tightly. Dean wrapped both arms around him and enveloped him in his warmth as Castiel cried into his shoulder, muttering repeatedly that ‘it was ok’ and ‘I’m just being silly’ as Dean shushed him gently.
Er, don’t remind me.
"Uncle Dean?" said Ellen, staring up at Dean with a big smile on her face.
Dean half frowned before smirking, "So, I have caught myself a man of mystery? Interesting."
Dean hears the unmistakable sound of a zip opening. Desperately, he tries to close his mouth, he tries to shift the metal ring with his tongue, tracing it around the cool bar and pushing against it. As his tongue circles it, his mind takes in the size and shape. He shakes his head, powerfully, rapidly from side to side. Slurring out an unintelligible plea.
“Cas, wait…” Dean put a gentle hand on his arm, Castiel stopped knowing full well he could tug his arm free if he wanted too, but he didn’t. He turned to face Dean, meeting his eyes.
And then I want him to kiss me… Here… *
Coming back to himself slightly, Dean looked back at the merman. The merman was tugging at Dean's shirt now, pulling the clothing from him, once he had the shirt free from Dean, he gave Dean more air, breathing into his mouth again. Before clawing through Dean's pants. He pulled off Dean's shoes too... Letting them fall away.
Yeah it was… He is good with his mouth, huh? ;-)
"I don't know. Either way, I felt like an idiot last night. Like I was making nice with someone who.. " he sighed, looking around his store for a moment "Is probably going to ruin me"
"Dean is meeting us there, I don't know if he is dressing up though..." Said Castiel thinking how weird it was that on the day his business was closing he was going to be going out drinking with the guy who was the reason it was shutting.
Dean had thought about confessing the truth to Castiel, several times but it didn’t seem like the right time. Castiel had lost a lot in a short space of time and Dean didn’t want to risk causing him to lose the friendship he had with ‘Win67’. Also, there was the selfish reason that Dean didn’t want to give up the truth just yet… He was falling for Castiel, there was no other way to put it. The more he spoke to him online, the more he saw him in person, the stronger his feelings for Castiel became, he didn’t want to lose him either.
The two men stand before each other. Gripping each other's arms tightly, their eyes brimming with tears… In a perfect world Dean would lean forward, their eyes would close and he’d show Cas, just what he meant. But this is not a perfect world - even with Chuck gone, and in a way Dean was glad that he didn’t suddenly have the courage to lean forward and kiss Castiel because at least he knew now, the thing that held him back - it wasn’t Chuck, it was himself. He was still himself, everything he had ever felt about Castiel - was real. Cas was right about that too, they are real. So, despite wanting to kiss the man in front of him, despite finally having confessed how he felt, Dean wasn’t ready for the next step yet but it made him happy, relieved - he was in control, he was writing his own story, he was free. And he and Castiel had the time to figure ‘them’ out, they’d get there, and soon - Dean had no doubt about that now.
“Hello, Dean,” He said sitting in the opposite from him.
“Am I not enough for you?”
“It’s my fault, it was when I broke the vase…” Castiel muttered as he tugged Dean along. He sat Dean down on the edge of the bath and wet some toilet paper. He began dabbing the wet tissue against Dean’s bleeding cut “I’m sorry, I’m sorry… it’s my fault…”
Castiel rolled his eyes, now the coffee made sense, it wasn’t some thoughtful gesture… it was Balthazar’s way of making sure Castiel had his wits about him for this evening, he sighed heavily but got up and made his way to the bathroom to go and take a shower anyway.
"Well, maybe a fortnightly thing," said Castiel after he finished chewing, "Am I getting... Do you think I've put on weight?"
Balthazar was stood on the small peer, his fingers twitching against the drink in his hand. He was shaking with rage. He'd gone to work late, smelling of alcohol and it had finally happened... He'd lost his job. Rational thought was all but gone from him now, replaced by bitter anger...
Balthazar frowned at his lover "I told you, when you agree to leave your wife, I will leave Castiel. I'm not stepping out on the ledge alone" He said as he typed out a reply to Castiel and then put his phone back on the table.
back door. ;-)
Lisa gives a look “You bought it for him, didn’t you?”
Dean had been waiting for over an hour now, feeling forgotten he got to his feet, just as the door opened and to his surprise, Castiel walked in, past a doctor who was holding the door open for him.
Castiel, Charlie, Garth, and Jo were all sat at a table in 'The Triangle' drinking and talking about Garth and Jo's first date.
"Well I'm glad you liked it, I had Charlie help pick the place," Said Garth smiling at her and giving her hand a squeeze under the table. He still hadn’t decided what to do about Balthazar, he knew Jo wanted him to tell his friend and a part of him did too but another part of him worried about it. He didn’t want to hurt Castiel.
Castiel chewed his lip for a moment before pulling the laptop towards him. He positioned it so that Charlie could still see it.
"Well, then ask it indirectly."
Garth’s face paled as he looked at her "What if he doesn't believe me?"
"Bye Charlie, thanks for coming round, see you in the morning," Said Castiel as she gave him a small wave and closed the door behind her.
Dean laughed "That's ok. That's what friends do right? Help each other.. And it's not too quick... It was us - and I don't mean this to come out wrong but, it was us that took to long to realize we were just friends.. why stop being that now?"
"Yeah" She smiled at him getting up "Just gonna grab a glass of water and then call a cab, hope that's alright?"
Dean feels light headed until a pair of strong hands land on his shoulders and two beautiful blue eyes lock into his gaze and pull it up from the suitcase on the floor.
“And secondly?”
I should tidy the bedroom… change the sheets… Just in case…
Releasing what he was probably in for did nothing to alleviate his terror, his hearts beating double-time, his throat feels like sandpaper, rough and dry, he shivers… Finally, he breaks eye contact with Castiel, letting his gaze travel down over Castiel’s body, to the front of his trousers… Where, sure enough, all of Castiel’s rage and interest could be seen pressing forward against the front of his pants.
Castiel’s smile lights up Dean’s heart and he nods eagerly before surging forward to capture Dean’s lips again, “Yes.”
“Cas? It’s Dean. Are you in? Got something here for you” Dean listens for a moment, Castiel had told ‘Win67’ he’d be in… but maybe he’d been invited round to Charlie's or Garth's last minute… It was possible. He waits for a few seconds and then turns, thinking he should have called first… Then he hears Castiel…
Garth and Jo had had a lovely dinner. Garth had asked her about her work and in return told her about Heaven's Library, being in trouble with the new superstore opening soon. They talked and enjoyed each other's company. This evening was going really well he thought to himself. He stood up after paying the bill, he'd insisted on paying as it was the first date and he wanted to do something nice for her but agreed they could go halves next time if she wanted to go out with him again, to which she had said she would love to... He beamed as he stood up...
Castiel tilts his head in confusion when his words seem to upset the child, he’d meant them to comfort him… but tears were rolling silently down Dean’s freckled face, “The most important thing is that you trust me and that you feel safe. I won’t hurt you, Dean.”
Castiel looked saddened, “I know that feeling. Loneliness can lead people to do drastic things… Like this, for example.” He motioned between them. Castiel watched as Dean processed what he’d said that he, Castiel, was lonely too, then he added quietly, “When I come in to see you, in the mornings and say good morning to you… even though you don’t say it back, it was the best part of my day.”
'I just reached my front door, it's unlocked, I think he might be here. Would you phone me in ten minutes and if I don't answer... call the police? I hate to ask but honestly after last night... I'm freaking out a little, sorry about this Dean'
Not more awesome than fucking me, right?
Castiel bought Dean a whiskey and they talked for a while about normal things, Dean's life. Castiel worked out very quickly that Dean had a younger brother he was close to...  Someone who would likely notice if Dean went missing... Someone, he'd likely have to 'deal' with, if as he planned... he kept Dean. He found out that Dean hated his job, he worked answering phones for some big company and apparently people came and went there frequently, Castiel was pleased with this, it meant that Dean disappearing from his job would not raise any red flags as people who got sick of working there just stopping going into work when they'd had enough of it. This was much simpler than he’d hoped, perfect.
“What are you doing here?” She snaps at him
The need for air became more and more necessary, cursing himself as he slowly pulled away. When he opened his eyes, his heart stuttered at the look in Castiel’s ocean blues. Why did they look so... angry?
Shaking his head, Balthazar delivers his warning. “Happy birthday brother, Sam's bringing you a surprise.” He pushes the button to end the call and runs a finger over his lip thoughtfully. Castiel would get the message, but would he do what needed to be done?
Dean smiled and climbed off him, offering him a hand and pulling him up, "Ok."
Dean clenched his jaw, suddenly starting to move toward where Castiel and Luke were dancing. He pushed his way through the crowd on the dance floor, marching over with determination on his face. Castiel turned his face away to hide a smug smile but continued to move against Luke, pretending not to notice Dean.
Sam began offering his two children things for breakfast and watched Dean from the corner of his eye, it could be a work thing, there would be a sale starting today in the store…
Balthazar swallowed and nodded.. and Castiel unzipped his pants.
"You want me to fuck you, Cas?" said Dean as he rolled his hips down again.
Lisa looked at him, not smiling.
His hand wrapped around his now aching cock tightly, his eyes squeezed shut as he began to slowly stroke himself. The relief was instant but not enough… His top teeth sinking into his bottom lip as he bit down. He kept a slow steady rhythm for a few minutes, feeling his entire body warm-up with desire and need. He pictured Castiel waking up and kissing him fiercely, batting his hand out of the way and taking over for him.
“It’s alright love, it’s alright,” soothes Castiel continuing to rock his body against Deans, “You can enjoy it, you know? I want you to. No one else is ever going to know, no one’s going to judge you… Take some pleasure for yourself. Just let go, enjoy it.”
"I'm meeting a.. a guy.. a friend here tonight," Said Dean
"Bye Daddy," said John, hugging on to Sam's leg tightly.
Dean frowns at her “Is something wrong?”
"Well.. we had a nice meal and she's agreed to go on another date with me" Said Garth dully
With wide eyes and his hands clenching by his side, Balthazar backs away a step, glancing at the door as if contemplating an escape attempt, only to be met with Sam’s hard gaze.
Dean didn't know who had started it, not really, it had just happened so naturally, like it was always going to and there was nothing he could have done to stop it... Had he made the first move? Had it been Castiel? Did it even matter? Probably not. It had happened and things would never be the same...
Just as Castiel was about to close his window he saw a cab pull up and Dean getting out of it and looking up at Castiel's window, his phone to his ear. Castiel heard him saying "Thanks Charlie, I'm here now" Before putting the phone back into his pocket and looking up at Castiel who had poked his head back out the window.
Yeah… Fuck."
His key slides easily into the lock, Balthazar flattens his hand against the door as he opens it to dull the sound. He steps over the threshold and breathes in deeply, the space around his is thick with Castiel’s scent, how he’d missed it. Closing the door silently he places his silver case on the floor gently, he wipes his wet boots against the doormat and shucks off his coat, hanging it on the coat stand.
"Shit," said Dean, scrambling to get up, "Back in a sec..." Dean disappeared from his room and darted across the landing to the bathroom. He needed to wash his come soaked hands and cock. He hastily washed and wiped his dick with a wad of toilet paper, flushing it down the toilet. He opened the door and moved to cross the landing back to his room when...
Castiel and Dean arrived at Sam’s house half an hour later. Greeted by the wonderful smells of the Thanksgiving dinner cooking.
A bird shat on me today… All down my t-shirt, fucking seagulls I swear to god. I was so embarrassed I just put my headphones in and ran… I don’t even have any music on my phone… I just wanted to avoid anyone speaking to me so I could get home quickly and get a clean top. I had to take my top off as I passed his street though… I didn’t want that cute guy to see me with bird crap all down my front…
After Sam had dried himself off and bid them goodnight, Castiel and Dean had gone to Dean’s room, stripping out of their wet clothes and drying off on two white fluffy towels that Dean had fetched from the bathroom. Once dry they had both stretched out on Dean's bed, wearing only their boxers, eating chips and playing video games.
“I’m going to open you up, you’re a flower and you will spread your petals for me… I’m going to slip inside you, inside your body and mind and make you my home. I’m going to grant you pleasure and I’m going to take my own. You belong to me now, Dean. You can have what I let you… you’ll take what I give you. You will be mine, you will give yourself to me and I will worship you for it.”
Castiel pushes forward and groans as he bottoms out, “Good, say it all together…”
On the one hand, Dean had been right there… Dean, who he had loved unconditionally through good and bad, and even
Sam, however, looked pissed “Dean…” He said firmly before pointedly nodding his head to his two young children.
Castiel was first to finish his three shots, followed by Meg, then Charlie, Dean, Garth and finally Jo, who was still making faces at the taste. Dean and Charlie stumbled to the bar to get the next round in as Katy Perry's 'ET' came on, making the floor buzz with the vibrations from the speakers.
Dean touched the cut on his face and grimaced “Yeah… I will”
“You’re forgiven.” He smiles at Dean warmly, “I’ll take your tray and get you a radio if you like? Some music will help.”
“Everything ok?” Askes Garth casually as he and Castiel sit to eat their bagels.
“I know,” Said Jess placing her arms around Sam’s waist and hugging herself into him tightly “But you didn’t answer my question”
A few minutes later Dean's name flashed up with a new message.
“Hey, Cas,” Said Dean. It was weird. Something was off with both of them and whilst Dean knew why he was feeling apprehensive, he had no idea what seemed to be troubling Castiel “So… I, er”
On his way home, he took a detour, it was silly really and he wasn’t sure why he did it. But he had to see it for himself, he walked into the Winchester Superstore, hoping no one spotted him. He walked in holding his grocery bag and looked up with wide eyes, the shop was brightly lit, clean, there was a buzz of a friendly atmosphere less personal than ‘Heavens Library’ but there all the same. He spied Charlie in the story corner, he smiled as he saw her turning the pages of a book and dramatically gasping at whatever was happening in the plot to excite the children sat around her thrown on squishy cushions.
“Yours.”
"What makes you think that? The fact that when I get home you are passed out drunk on the couch with some woman's legs around you?"
"Son of a bitch..." Whispered Dean, looking around at his brother. To Sam, his face was comical. Eyes so wide you could see white all around the iris, face pale, lips parted in surprise at discovering this thing - about himself - that's been true for years. "Son of a bitch," Says Dean louder "Well, why the hell didn't you tell me?"
He got into his house, put his groceries away and slumped down on the seat in front of his desk. He pulled his laptop towards him and wrote a message to ‘Win67’.
He glanced back into the bedroom at his sleeping boyfriend before leaving for work. He picked up coffees for Charlie and Garth on his walk to work and briefly noticed the trees, with their orange leaves waving at him in the breeze.
"No problem. Would you like a hand?"
Not like that… down boy. I’ve got a hammer, saw, nails… paint. I’ve picked out a ridiculously difficult design… Ah, well it just means I’ll be able to justify staying outside longer… Let’s do this…
It was after he had left Castiel’s house on Monday morning for work that he had realised. After he had kissed him at the door and had walked away from him, driven away, looking back in the rear view mirror to see Cas watching his car to the very end of the street, that pang of regret had hit him and he’d realised. Something was wrong, something was missing.
“No, he likes ‘Win67’ I want to keep it that way, I’ll tell him when…”
He watched as the cab pulled away, he pulled his phone out of his pocket and out with it came a little piece of card with the Doctor's number on it.
Castiel’s smile twists his face, “Never.”
“You are home.” says Castiel firmly, “I don’t want to hear you say that again, do you understand? I won’t be happy if I hear that again, Dean. This is your home now, soon you’ll come to love it… You’ll come to love me.”
"This is Benny," Said Charlie stroking the doctor's arm and giggling "He gave me some kick-ass drugs and then rearranged my face ha ha.. Its funny... because it's true" She laughed again.
Заткнись и Х.Е.!
'Hey. I had a feeling you would be online now. Shopboy'
“You can come, Dean, just keep saying my name and I won’t stop.” Castiel says in a soothing tone, “You can do it…”
"Come on you lush, let's get you home," Said Meg breaking the silence and helping Charlie to the door "Thanks" She added to Doctor Lafitte taking the painkillers he was holding out to her
Sam raises his eyebrows "I thought you knew..." He waves a hand around "Everyone else knows"
He was fairly certain that kidnaping people was going to piss off the Winchesters, but how the hell else was he going to get ‘ten lords a leaping’ or ‘nine ladies dancing’? If he had any money, he’d offer to pay them, but he’d spent the last of the money he’d had on the geese, saving them from being the centre piece on someone's dinner table this Christmas, surely that was a good thing?
Mental note - buy lube.
Dean swallowed "It's alright Cas, you do what you gotta do" He turned and walked out of the bathroom and back into the club.
Garth nodded sadly "I'm so sorry man, I didn't know what to do. I didn't sleep all weekend thinking about it. And before in the shop.. when I thought you were cheating on him.. I just.. I don't even know... I didn't want that to be true of you, ya know? I'm sorry I thought that, even if it was only for a moment, I shouldn't have doubted you"
On the one hand… Dean hadn’t woken up and Sam was in a small way like a living, conscious piece of the man Castiel desired. On the other hand… Sam Winchester is the only person who now stands in his way of having Dean all to himself…
Dean sat at the command center with a beer in hand, absolutely not watching Castiel as he moved around the bunker to gather his supplies. The angel had just stopped wandering back and forth to pack extra salt loaded rounds inside his bag. Dean felt it as his gaze lifted to peer at him. Luckily though, Dean had looked away just in time to avoid Castiel’s eyes, looking up at the ceiling as he took another long pull from his drink.
“I know,” says Castiel, “I’ll deal with it.” Castiel is sure that his version of ‘dealing with it’ and Sam’s were likely to be very different, but he couldn’t help that. What happened next would be up to Dean.
“Hey Cas,”
It was a couple of months after Castiel and Dean started dating that Castiel finally managed to sell Balthazar’s house. He used the money to get a small one-bedroom flat and finally got to ask Dean round to his for a date night. He cooked a beautiful meal and they drank a bottle of wine together. Castiel felt like he was flying, Dean was here, with him… by choice. It wasn’t forced. This time, Dean was with him because he wanted to be. The feeling expanding in Castiel’s chest like a balloon being blown up, his happiness filled him but even with that amazing feeling… Castiel wanted more. He wanted all of Dean, he wanted to get Dean into bed.
"Are you really going to have to move?" Dean had asked nervously. He’d overheard Balthazar talking about it when the phone had been dropped.
Things I need from the store, toilet roll, lube, condoms… Second date tomorrow… You never know…
As he passed the couch… He realized what he guesses he must have known… There was Dean, sleeping soundly on the couch. The blanket Castiel had laid down for him covered one leg and a little way up his stomach… The rest of Dean was bare… Bare skin, that looked smooth and firm.
Castiel knows he doesn’t really have a choice at this point, Balthazar is inside and the smell of alcohol is thick in the air around him, not wanting to piss him off Castiel nods his head jerkily, his heart still pounding rapidly in his chest.
He was looking forward to moving and starting fresh, creating his own space. He’d bought himself a new computer for his writing. He’d begun to draft ideas for children's books and he’d been in touch with a local artist that he’d met at Meg’s cafe about maybe illustrating his works. He had been emailing the young woman called Claire Milton back and forth and she had shown him some of her drawings, which Castiel loved.
“Yes. Shame it’s not the truth… You two have a lot in common”
“It’s over, Balthazar. You’re over, finished and I want you to see me, to look into my eyes as I tell you... that I
Choosing to ignore Castiel's comment Meg asked: "Was that Dean Winchester by the way?"
Castiel’s eyes darken as he remembers the pained look on Dean’s bloodied face as he was dragged away, “He can try…”
He can feel Luke's hands on his waist, fingertips gripping lightly into his sides as he grinds his ass up against the other man's crotch. Luke's already hard, breathing hotly against Castiel's neck, it would be so easy, it's all right here, on offer but what Castiel really wants... is the man eyeing him from across the room.
“For ten years?” The hands clenching Dean’s jacket tightened, then unclenched, releasing their grip.
Castiel watches as Dean winces against the pain, admiring his shining ass and the way he looks utterly delicious, stood in front of him completely naked with his arms still taped together behind his back. Castiel swallows, his cock is still hard, painfully so… He knows he isn’t going to last very long.
Dean frowned at him, confused "What are you doing here? I thought you hated me?"
Another knock at the door, followed by… “Cas? It’s Dean. Are you in? Got something here for you”
If you say ‘slipped out’ so help me… No orgasms for a month. I swear.
tight, but I manage. And I am far bigger than this pink monstrosity. Put some more lube on it and try again!
you.”
Castiel pulled out his phone "Balthazar wants to join us" He looked up smiling "Guess there is no way this can be taken as a date by 'Win67' now"
It had been over three weeks since Castiel had dragged Balthazar out of his house, he'd mailed all his remaining belongings to his office taking great pleasure in addressing them to 'That cheating asshole Balthazar'. He'd cleared out any trace of him, the photographs had all been shredded and used as packing for Balthazar's laptop it that had been very satisfying, to know that he would see it when he opened the box. Castiel had completely cleansed himself of Balthazar, he felt so much better, his friends had been there for him, checking he was OK and being supportive.
“Let me in, Castiel… I just want to talk to you” Says Balthazar pushing against the door.
Charlie giggled "That's the spirit, now come on, let's make this place look great, someones bound to come in any minute"
“I’ll give you my email address when you have a few pages, send them over and I will give you some feedback”
"Well, Gabe..." Said Garth "Balthazar warned me not to tell my friend, Cas... I'd seen him and when he realized I had he lashed out. Charlie slapped him... like a badass by the way (Charlie made a noise of approval) Then he punched her in the face, heard the crunch... Bastard. And then..."
Charlie took both her own and Castiel's glasses to the kitchen and poured generous amounts of vodka into each before adding coke. She sneered at the picture of Balthazar stuck to the fridge. 'Cas can do so much better than you, you ass. Stop treating my friend like shit' She thought to herself.
Later that night though, he isn’t sure he made the right decision and doubts start to creep in...
“That’s blood,” snaps Gabriel, pointing at John’s shirt and looking back to the officer, “that, right there! Blood. And look at his knuckles,” turning back to John, Gabriel shoves at his chest wildly, “What the fuck did you do?”
He woke a couple of hours later and got up, finally unpacking the bag of stuff he had brought with him from Lisa's. He pulled out his laptop, feeling a zing of excitement that he could message ‘Shopboy’. He tapped impatiently on the keyboard as he waited for it to load and then sent 'Shopboy' a message with a small smile on his face.
Dean had no intention of screwing things up with Cas, they had come way too far and been through way too much to screw things up now. He wasn’t hiding it from anyone, but he also wasn’t about to just jump into bed with his best friend. He’d never done this before, he’d never been with a guy before and there were still aspects that scared him but he wasn’t too worried, he knew Castiel would never push him into something he didn’t feel ready for… In fact, he was kind of excited about it, he and Castiel would get to work things out together, at their own pace. There was no one he trusted more and whilst it might take some time for each of them to learn to express their feelings properly and openly to each other, they already confessed the biggest hidden feeling they each had for the other man. They loved each other, wholly and unconditionally, and they had for a long, long time.
Well anyway… then he kinda… I don’t know… hurried off. Ran away?
Tempting, but no… I might see if he wants to meet up for a drink tonight tho…
“I thought that’s what angels were for?” Castiel shakes his head, “Why did you make an exception for me?”
Charlie raised her eyebrows, "Well... have you had sex?"
"Wait." he heard himself say softly, stepping forward and placing a gentle hand on Dean's arm, "Forgive me... What I should have said, was that you would live to regret it if you came home with me tonight." he shot Dean a flirty smile.
Sam Winchester has to die.
“You got Cas, too,” says Sam, nudging Dean with his shoulder and sounding far to smug, “‘Bout time .”
Dean carried him to the couch and lay Castiel down carefully on it, climbing up and resting himself between Castiel's legs, he met his eyes for a moment searchingly before lowering his head again and capturing Castiel's bottom lip between his teeth, gently pulling on it and smirking when Castiel groaned out. Dean pressed his hips down as he released Castiel's lip.
Castiel suddenly typed out 'Are you straight?" And then deleted it again right away - that was far too forward, not to mention breaking the personal information rule, although 'Win67' seems to have already broken that. Maybe he had begun to read too much into these messages with 'Win67'. Maybe they were just strangers, who had become - online friends - 'oh god the thought - I've been online friend-zoned'
Dean's eyes focussed immediately and he nodded, "Yeah, yeah I want you too."
"No" Said Dean shiftily "Not yet"
"It was nothing" Said Dean, Meg laughed and elbowed him gently.
Of course, he wanted to kiss Castiel… He wanted to kiss him and hold him and so much more… He wanted to trace the lines of Castiel’s no doubt beautiful body with his fingertips and worship every inch of his skin with his tongue… and and and… great, now he was hard, in his brothers living room. “Double shit” He muttered to himself. The problem was, that he couldn’t do that until Castiel knew the truth about ‘Win67’, he was walking the lines of just omitting the truth to lying as it was… Getting physically involved would feel like he was taking advantage… Not to mention that what had happened earlier with Balthazar had obviously left Castiel feeling vulnerable, it just wasn’t the right time… However much that frustrated him, or Castiel… He had to do right by Cas, or he’d be no better than Balthazar.
As they pulled up at the hospital Gabe turned to face Charlie "You gonna be alright love?” She nodded “Good" He turned to the three in the back seat "Listen you guys have had a shit evening, I'm gonna wave the fare this once as long as you all take one of my business cards... You ever need a limo driver, you give me a call, alright?" He handed them all a card each and smiled as they got out thanking him "Take it, easy guys"
“Castiel changed for me, he grew, evolved. But, he changed again… when he met you. He was supposed to kill you, instead, he tore up the whole script and burnt the pages. I was… unimpressed to say the least but I love him, so I thought I’d be merciful, I thought I would let this play out, see how long it took him to get bored of you.” Balthazar clicked the projector again, the image vanished and the light on the machine flickered out, “But he didn’t get bored of you, did he? I watched, day by day as he grew fond of you, as you called out to him as you came, as you begged... as he relished it. That betrayal sinks deeply into my heart like a blade, you can’t imagine the pain... yet, but you will.”
"Exactly," said Castiel, sounding smug, "I'll give him an hour or so to reply and then tell him my friend sent that message and apologize for her - inappropriate behavior."
'Sorry to hear you and your girlfriend broke up, maybe you should try a guy next time - you know if you're into that. Hope the move out wasn't too awkward. Shopboy'  She looked up as Cas came back into the room and smirked at him.
"Are they?" Dean runs a hand over his eyes as though he can determine how red they are by feeling them. They're certainly dry, and so is his mouth. The water bottle is almost gone, but it doesn't seem to be helping.
Dean’s eyes are wide, caught. He doesn’t move, and he doesn’t look like he’s going to.
It’s a dead horse.
There's nothing on Dean's face. Absolutely nothing. "Oh," he says blankly.
Dean finally gets up when he catches sight of Cas' snacks, what looks to be a whole pie visible in the bottom of the bag. "Sammy, shut up. Cas? You're a lifesaver." Dean wobbles on his feet for a moment, somehow both too heavy and too light to stand.
They’re too late. By the time they skid around the corner, there’s nothing at the back of the barn but a shattered window and the wide expanse of Missy’s land stretching miles into the distance, tall grass still almost perfectly unmoving in the heavy night air.
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up. He raises hands in a
” Dean yelps. He scrambles backward, nearly launching himself across the bed and to the floor. He barely catches himself before instinctively putting his fists up at his unexpected visitor, chest heaving. He sighs in relief when he sees who it is. “...Cas? What the hell—”
"I’m not-- Cas, I didn't--" Sam clears his throat as if to remind them that he’s here, and Dean decides in that moment that he doesn't care. "Yeah, yeah, whatever. I know."
Sam's seen a lot of people die, and he's half afraid she'll ask. Instead, she only nods. Her posture relaxes and her eyes meet his more readily now; he's said the right thing. "Thank you. He… He may'uh done some things, in the past. But he was a good man," she says, raising her shoulders. "He didn't deserve it."
. The receptionist waits patiently for him to follow her into the hallway of the coroner's office. "...Right this way, sir," she repeats.
"Yeah, well… maybe not," Dean mutters. "If you're that worried about it, we can go by and check on her tonight, okay?"
Missy nods, chewing, and Sam waits for her to swallow. "It has been… it's been real hard." One hand takes a break from her chicken to grab a fresh tissue and dab at her eyes; the other stays hard at work, picking away. "The kids are at their Nana's… I haven't told 'em their Uncle Dee is gone."
Party-goers laugh and scream in delight, twirling with each other and brushing up against him as he stands on his tiptoes and peers over their heads, trying to find the one he's here for. A candelabra floats idly by Cas’ head as he searches, a reminder that this is, by no means, real. No matter how out of place he finds it, this is Dean’s dream; the hunter has to be here somewhere.
— but instead, Cas does something worse. He pries open Darrell's mouth and sticks his bare fingers in.
An image pops into Dean's head, someone who's with them through thick and thin, possibly the only other someone besides Sam that Dean would want to see when he's lit to the moon. The mental image is sharp, a technicolor painting of baby blues and a trench coat shimmering in his mind's eye.
"Please— we'd like to hear what you have," Sam adds.
! and the man's body jerks, face spasming with pain. His back bows forward, and he falls to all fours once more.
"It is. There's just not much vapor." Sam doesn't even cough as he holds it out. "You wanna try this?"
Dean grins. "See? What did I say, Sammy? We'll be in and out like we were never even there. Milk run."
Meanwhile, Cas cuts a near-giant piece of his steak away from the rest, sticks it in his mouth, and barely chews, gulping it down like he's a homeless human man again with no promise of another decent meal. He gets the next piece down, and then the next one, and Dean finally gets concerned.
"Sure. Thanks." Sam catches the beer that's tossed unceremoniously his way, pops the tab, and takes a sip before he grabs his keys. The Northern Lights strain he's stashed in the Impala's glove compartment has been lying in wait specifically for this occasion.
Dean plops himself onto the motel bed with a hard bounce, groaning as the springs give under his weight with a hearty squeak. "Not for nothing, Sammy, but maybe you're right."
When Dean only wiggles his eyebrows suggestively, Sam wrenches the Impala's door open. "You're disgusting," he says, and Dean grins as they both get in the car.
Missy stands with him. "I'll see you out," she offers.
The blinds are askew and the front door stands wide open. Cold yellow light spills from the foyer onto the front lawn.
A song swims through his mind as the temperature warms.
"Uh..." Sam tosses the menu down and shakes his head. "You know what? I'll have the same thing."
"Whoa, whoa," Sam says, throwing up his hands. "Thanks. Tmi, dude."
, and Sam says
It's only a minute or two before Cas appears in the doorway with a rustle of wings, a bulging grocery bag in one hand.
“...Would you like me to stay?” Cas offers.
Dean props his arms on the table, grabbing a fry. “That’s what I said, too.”
Inside, Dean's bedroom light is off, but the walls flicker gently with the soft glow of a small television, propped up on a dresser and facing the side of the bed. The VHS tape inside it whirs, quietly working to display the picture of a live action movie Cas doesn't recognize. It's markedly different from the things Dean’s shown him before, though it does look older, more in the time period of films he tends to gravitate toward. Dean himself is stretched out sideways on the bed, lying on his stomach with his arms tucked under his head, fast asleep. He's dozed off in his bathrobe, and it's pulled halfway down one shoulder like he's been restless.
unusual that Dean’s being so receptive, though, so blank, and so… quiet. Sometime since they’ve been dancing, Dean’s buffeting litany of
Dean arches an eyebrow. “There’s more?”
Dean can see Sam thinking a little too hard, probably relating this to the time when Cas offered Crowley a bag of raw honey, and he rolls his eyes. "It's too deep for us, Cas."
"Hello, Cas," he growls, and Dean loses it. He can almost hear the confusion on the other end of the line as they laugh.
look. When he tears himself back to reality, Dean’s eyes have dropped to Cas’ lips, too.
"No," she finally says, and regains some of her concentration, pushing the plate a few inches away and wiping her hands on one of the already discarded napkins. The majority of the chicken is somehow already gone, now more of a hollow carcass. "I don't mean how he… looked. I mean how he…"
"Did you want to talk about it?"
Dean frowns as he squints out into the horizon, trying to see any moving shapes. Missy has probably run off somewhere, perhaps out into the hills in search of something to feed on, and could be miles away by now. He turns to Sam and shrugs.
Dean hesitates, something on his tongue that he's not sure he should say, for some reason. He finally decides he wants to. "I could get you some honeybees, if you want.” Cas blinks at him in surprise. “No bugs in heaven, right? But you could… you could have some honeybees here, if you want, and make all the honey you wanted. You could keep them at the bunker."
Pretty soon they're all losing it over nothing, breathless and laughing how Dean doesn't think he's ever heard them laugh before, big belly laughs like they haven't just killed a bunch of monsters and they don't still need to figure out how to save humanity or everyone dies. Like they don't have a care in the world.
Sam stills. He knows his brother hardly ever talks about living there. "Huh. Who knew. Didn't peg you for the kid who would try drugs. How was that?"
There was initially some confusion, that first time they asked him to stay; why would they want him to hang around in the bunker when they won't even be awake to see him? But after a few nights by himself, and especially after his short time spent being human, he gets it. Maybe the species has a good thing going here, Cas has decided.
Dean knows Cas won't know, so he sighs and cuts in, getting straight to the point. "We did drugs, Cas."
Sam lowers his pistol and Dean realizes he hasn’t heard any vehicles pull up yet. He pulls his phone out of his pocket and checks— no missed messages. He frowns.
When Cas doesn’t follow up with anything, Dean checks his bedside clock, slowly lowering his fists. “It's two in the morning,” he says in a gravelly voice, and clears his throat. “People gotta sleep, man. You scared the shit out of me.”
Dean is the first to break whatever stalemate they’re locked in. “Agent!” he exclaims, and Cas jumps. “Sorry I’m late. Thanks, we can take it from here,” he directs at the receptionist.
"Can't believe I had to say that," Dean mutters.
"Sheriff, I'm Agent Feldman. This is my partner, Agent Newlander.”
"Assaulted coming home from work," Dean muses.
Instantly, the image of the last time they saw each other comes to Dean's mind: Cas wrapping his arms in a vice grip around Dean's middle, Dean struggling against him, black-eyed and desperate to kill. Worse still is the memory of Cas appearing in Dean’s room and explaining that he has "a female in the car" that he has to get back to, leaving and not bothering to call again. He's been absent for some weeks now, not to mention radio silent.
It's a love story.
"Yeah, no, Cas, that's-- that's fine," Sam stutters. "Uh, Dean hasn't really, either." He shoots Dean an apologetic look, but Dean is absorbed in his pie. "Do you think-- will it take a lot? Like with alcohol?"
"Rare," Cas settles on almost immediately. Dean arches an eyebrow and turns to Sam, who shrugs, similarly nonplussed.
Dean cheers. "Shut up!" Sam laughs as he deposits Dean's phone on the bed, then flops down beside it to wait.
“Well.” Ullman pushes the second folder forward with the tips of his fingers like he’s trying not to touch it, like it’s an evil thing he wishes he didn’t have to handle. “They ain’t the only dead we got.”
Dean cuts him off immediately. "Nope. Shut up. Forget I asked."
"How are you, Dean?" Cas asks, his voice tinged bittersweet like he already knows the answer but still has room to hope.
He takes a shower.
“Uh-huh. Okay. So, let me get this straight,” Dean says, a bit of fire starting to tinge his words. “You felt this…
Missy sniffs heartily, obviously still upset, but gives her undivided attention to quickly tearing the chicken apart with her fingers. Without hesitation, she begins stuffing large chunks of it into her mouth, skin and all.
"His molars have been turned inside his gums, rotated. I'd say about… ninety degrees," Cas continues as he feels around, like this is normal. Dean's stomach flips over. "And, not only did he eat Danika's bones. Specifically—" Cas pulls his hand out, lifting up a rusty-brown tinged fingertip to show Dean. "He ate the marrow."
Dean doesn’t spare a glance back. Cas tries to follow, but the crowd closes in on him, blocking his path. He still fights on in vain to make it toward Dean, struggling through hands grabbing at him and slowing him down from every side.
"Fries, soup, or salad?"
Cas, in his dream, and his best friend has seen him like…
When he's done unbuttoning his shirt and hanging it on a hook next to his coat, Cas steps into the freezing cold water and watches the goosebumps raise on his arms and legs. He's gathered that most humans think this is unpleasant; Sam has certainly complained enough about the hot water being taken when he heads into the showers after Dean. Personally, Cas likes the way it clears his head. The juxtaposition of warmth when he finally turns on the
"I talked to Cas this morning," Sam says conversationally, shattering the stillness.
There's a long silence on the other end of the line. "I'll… I’ll be there soon." The phone beeps as he hangs up.
Through the sides of his eyes, Cas discreetly examines the patch of skin that's exposed, from Dean's neck to his chest, from his collarbone to the hard slope of his arm. It's full of smooth, small scars, but it's not the shoulder that bears Castiel's handprint. "Yes?"
The glassy surface shatters on impact, and so does the ballroom scene. Cas reels as the partygoers scream, and he feels himself sharply yanked back into the present before he can fully comprehend what’s happened.
Sam shines his flashlight into the rest of the barn, and they figure out pretty quickly by the bodies strewn about that this isn’t all there is. Missy must have had a few horses— Dean counts the remains of four, if he’s discerning between them correctly. It’s hard to tell where one twisted pile of animal carcass ends and the next begins.
Cas accepts the pipe and lighter that's passed back down the line to him, and Sam doesn't even have to explain. Apparently, watching Dean is all the angel needed. He takes a long inhale and doesn't even cough, doesn't even look phased.
Alarmed, Sam echoes Dean’s words from earlier. “They’re killing angels?”
He trails off. His eyes are roaming all over Cas' face, no more than a shoulder's length away.
