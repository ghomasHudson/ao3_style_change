The smile becomes more real when John laughs again, that delighted giggle he usually gives when Sherlock has said something ridiculous or scandalous.  This time it just seems … fond, which causes Sherlock’s heart to thud heavily in his chest.
“How long?” Sherlock says, casting John a look over his shoulder.
With Sherlock wriggling into place beneath the covers next to him, John can’t help but feel that this is so ... oddly domestic.  He drops his mobile on the nightstand next to his side just next to where he’d dropped his wallet earlier and turns back to Sherlock. He leans in without thinking, as if he were going to kiss Sherlock goodnight; only a few inches away from Sherlock’s face, he realizes himself and goes rigid.  John shuffles away and stares, red-faced, towards the foot of the bed.
“Nope,” John says shortly.  “Try again.”
“Yes.  Case.  Thought it was going to be deadly dull – the clerk at the local historical society having some issues with the local parish’s paperwork to get funding for historical restoration – but it turns out that the clerk hasn’t got any indication that any paperwork was filed and as a matter of fact, when prodded about it, there’s no indication on any of the town’s records that the building even exists.  A cathedral that’s stood since the thirteenth century, completely vanished from the legal consciousness of the entire town, which is fairly difficult to do with no one noticing, as the parish is still thriving and has been since the late seventeenth century.”  Sherlock becomes aware that he’s said all of this very quickly.
I was right about something?”
that the doctor swears rattles his whole chest cavity.
John strides over purposefully, hands raised towards his friend’s shoulder, but Sherlock darts away so quickly that John might have even called it a scramble.  His eyes narrow at the detective.  “What are you hiding?”
“Everything you’ve said about not wanting to pursue sex is in the past, but all that about how you feel attraction is in present tense.  Feel, not felt.  You

bored.  Or otherwise—”
Sherlock is in Hell.  Unmitigated, unrelenting Hell.  If such a place actually existed, he’s positive that this would be it. Clearly the drugs and the yelling, the general disregard for people’s feelings and being generally Not Good over the years has earned him box seats in damnation for eternity because honestly, he can’t think of a worse fate for himself than this.  John is nude in the tub of their ensuite bath, less than ten feet away from where Sherlock is in his pajamas in the bed that he will have to
written referrals for things like that.  Jesus,” John pinches at the bridge of his nose with his free hand and tries not to let his voice falter, “Jesus, I’ve become the sort of father who needs a Child Protection referral against him.”
A few tears threaten at the corners of his eyes so John squeezes the lids shut.  “Don’t ever hide yourself from me again.  Promise me.”
A/N - You guys.  YOU GUYS.  THAT ENDING KILLED ME.  The only thing that made me get through it is knowing that
– as he props himself up on one elbow to regard John’s wall-eyed gaze.  “John, were you intending to stay and watch me finish?”
“Mummy’d lost hope of grandchildren.  Rosie is the nearest she’ll get and no doubt she’ll smother her with affection,” the detective chortles.
John swallows back a mouthful of saliva and bile and nods.  His touch moves to the series of marks and knots at his spine.  “Good, old-fashioned beating.  Fractured some ribs that didn’t heal properly.”
“God help her,” Sherlock quips, tossing John a smirk over his shoulder.  “Imagine what he’ll be like to the young men or women she wants to date.”  He affects a face that is an unfortunately accurate depiction of his brother’s tipped-nose sneer and quotes,
“You don’t,” Sherlock says firmly.  “It’s just … grief.”
A startled chuckle rumbles Sherlock’s chest as John leans forward slowly, giving Sherlock plenty of time to dodge away if he wants to.  He doesn’t.
Sherlock smirks and shrugs.  "So it would seem."
Sherlock’s body bows up off the bed and his head flails towards John.  When he releases his held breath, it’s on a moan that actually contains words.
“—and you just seemed so … Jesus, you even babbled when she said brainy was sexy!  You, of all people.
One of many, then.  John understands that, certainly.  “And I die in the dream?”
This teases an actual laugh out of the detective.  “Presumably.  As a matter of fact, I gather that she was the instigator, as it were, since she ended the conversation in order to … resume activities.”
He can hear the smile in her voice as she responds, “I’ll remember that.”
Sherlock just nods.  Rosie raises her hand and pats John’s lips.  She begins to say something but John cuts her off by pressing a kiss to her lips.  His face flushes and he gives Sherlock a tight smile as he prompts Rosie, “Say goodnight, love.”
“I can’t.”
– though what it indicates, he has no idea, given how unconnected the markers are – and yet, there are several other factors that seem equally undesirable and worryingly non-specific.   Despite never batting an eye at it for the entirety of their previous tenure as flatmates, John startles and averts his eyes when Sherlock walks about in his dressing gown after a bath.  He’s surly for days after The Woman texts Sherlock about a blog post on a recent case.  John practically yells the flat ceiling down while stitching up a gash in Sherlock’s side after a confrontation with a suspect then berates himself in an apology not an hour later.  And then once, during a particularly athletic chase through Islington after a drug trafficker, Sherlock herds John into the darkened corner of an alley lest they be caught by the thugs in hot pursuit of them and the evidence they pinched.  Spying an alcove that is protected and defensible but gives a sightline to the outer alley, Sherlock corrals John into the corner with his body, keeping his ears trained to the outer alley for signs of their pursuers.  In the tense minutes that follow, he feels John’s breaths puff against his chest in increasingly erratic patterns as they wait until Sherlock is confident that they managed to shake off their shadows and can proceed safely back to the Yard.  John remains stiff and uncommunicative for at least an hour afterwards at the Yard – to the point where even Donovan notices and comments on it – and then when they return to Baker Street, he barely speaks three words to Sherlock before pleading fatigue and heading upstairs.  Except that Sherlock can hear John’s restless pacing the perimeter of his room for nearly half an hour.  Sherlock frowns and gazes up the stairs for several minutes, pondering the matter; eventually he admits defeat and gives it up as a bad job, heading back to his laptop in the sitting room.
John grits his teeth.  “This is why you wouldn’t let me look at you.  This is—you wouldn’t let me help you bathe after the gunshot; you made me treat that knife-wound through a curtain of your ruined shirt; you used to swan about in a sheet and now you’re glued to your dressing gown.  You—this is what you didn’t want me to see.  You didn’t want me to know.”
us if anything.  She’s giving you your own nickname.”
“Would hardly be good for a growing child if I was clambering around just under her bedroom all hours of the night,” Sherlock says as if he’s a completely reasonable person who has always had sensible personal habits.  “Toddlers thrive on routine, you know, John.”
“Thank you … Eva,” he says as he leans over the counter to spy her name emblazoned on the pin just above her left breast.  “Sorry to keep you up so late and to be such a bother.  We really appreciate you accommodating us despite the hour.  I promise we’ll be model guests from here on out.”
John says it with such a tone of awe that the weight of it squeezes the breath from Sherlock’s lungs.
Sherlock arches an eyebrow.  “Neither are you; does that mean you’re not interested either?”
Sherlock ponders this and then offers, “If you’ll promise me to stop flogging yourself for having the audacity to be imperfect.”
“And there’s the back of the t-shirt,” Sherlock finishes without much thought.  He can hear John stiffen – or, rather, he notes the sudden complete silence – before he realizes the last time those words were said to John.  The whole Magnussen ordeal leaps up in front of his eyes and through the haze of memory, Sherlock can see conflict and hurt on his friend’s face.
“Nothing, John.  Not taxes, utility bills, a parish registry, requests for the numerous historical renovations that have happened in the past … not even a careless teenager getting a parking ticket outside the car park.  Nothing at all since the mid-nineties.  This building has stood in this exact spot since the 1300s; surely
John ponders this for a moment then nods.  “So would you—is it all right if—do you mind?”
“Did you finally get hungry or did you just realize that it got dark?” he asks congenially.
Next to the definition, John had penciled in, scribbled over, and then erased the words “Sherlock?” and “Love = sex? Sex = love?”.  Sherlock isn’t certain what to make of this, exactly, but it does make his heartbeat roar within his chest.  A thin, snaking arrow next to the circled definition wends its way down the page and draws his eyes to a note down at the bottom.
John grinds his teeth so they won’t chatter for a long (cold) minute.  “Fine.
“Yes, well,” the nurse says in a tight voice, but she doesn’t finish the thought.  Her eyes dart between them and John’s not sure, but he’s reasonably certain the disapproval only intensifies.  Despite the fact that, at one time, John might have seen that censorious stare and quickly removed his hand from Sherlock’s, John finds himself clasping the long digits all the more, sitting straighter in his chair and pinning her back with his best military glare that he used on unruly privates in Afghanistan.
“Right,” John says and drops his gaze to his lap.  “Right.  Of course.  Sorry, didn’t mean to … overstep.  Although if I’m even mostly right about why you chose what you chose, that does leave some questions about why you were so enamored with Irene Adler.  Unless she—”
Laughing again, Sherlock strides into the sitting room, bending to stack a few of the smaller boxes one on top of the other on the coffee table.  “Mmmm,” he mutters, arranging things in a pattern completely incomprehensible to anyone but Sherlock.  “It never occurred to you to question why I can chase criminals all over the city and still be able to hold my own in a fight?  Obviously I must be training at
“Okay.  Well, just make sure that you’re communicating with your boyfriend about this, okay?  If he was a bit too rough, you’ll want to make sure that you tell him so that you two can avoid going too far next time.  I’m sure he wouldn’t want to hurt you and it’ll be a much better experience for both of you in the long run.”
He hears her give a small, throaty chuckle.  “Yes, I’d imagine.  I have a case for you that ought to do just nicely.  I was going to send one of my people, but if you need the excuse, it’s yours.  Out in Dursley, so a good few hours away and if you leave around tea time tomorrow, it’ll give you a good reason to stay the night. Something more admin than chasing, I’m afraid, but that sounds like just what you’re looking for.”
“You’re having sex!”  A bit juvenile of him to practically shout it that way, but the idea is so preposterous that it merits the reaction, he thinks.
o	Early January - Sherlock pardoned; John and Sherlock back on cases
Not unexpected but a question he’d fervently hoped to avoid.  However much he tries to hide it, John is deeply discomfited by the question but seems incapable of quashing his curiosity.  Even though he knows how this is going to go, Sherlock tries to deflect through feigned ignorance.
He gets out of the bath with little fanfare, hoisting Rosie out and wrapping her up in the little hooded towel Sherlock had bought her a few weeks ago (really, he must stop Sherlock spoiling her so ridiculously).  It had seemed a bit silly at the time, but the little bobbles on top of the hood and “stinger” on the back makes Rosie look like a little bee and it sets John grinning. He tweaks one of the bobbles on her antennae and sets it bouncing, drawing gales of laughter as he buzzes at her.  All of a sudden, John gets an idea … it’s a bit terrible to involve his daughter in his plot and more than a bit manipulative … but he does it anyway.  John gently sets Rosie on the ground, hooded towel gaping around her sturdy little naked body.  She grins up at him, chubby cheeks rosy from the warm humidity of the room.
“Of course.”
o	January 6 - Sherlock's 39th birthday
Sherlock gestures to John with his mug, crossing one long leg over the other.  “You have the patience to let my tea come to the right temperature and yet you can’t stand to wait for your own to cool.  As ever, John, you are positively an
Rosie grimaces at him and pats her hand against his mouth again.  “Dada kiss.”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock confirms.
“Sherlock,” John says, all astonishment.  “The kitchen….”
John huffs as he carries the last of the boxes seventeen familiar steps, stopping at the landing halfway up to hitch a bag of Rosie’s things higher onto his good shoulder before proceeding.  Scowling darkly, the doctor growls at Sherlock’s retreating back as the man scales the next flight towards John’s room, toting the old army footlocker as if it were a shoebox.
(See the end of the chapter for
John says again and thumps down in his chair.  “With another person?”
“No sad,” she says and drops her hot cheek to his shoulder.
A ringing moment of silence passes before they both burst out laughing.
Sherlock turns just his head and regards the doctor with a furrowed brow.  “You’ve never shown concern about the way we tease each other before; why start now?”
John just gapes like a landed codfish.
Okay.  It’s fine, it’s all fine.  Sherlock’s just got a bit of morning wood and John can

Sherlock regards John for a moment.  He doesn’t look any different (of course he wouldn’t, his brain reminds him, he
He says it nonchalantly but Sherlock’s comment stops John stock-still in the middle of the room.  Maybe if he prods gently enough …. “Everyone?” he asks carefully.
The page is covered in definitions, clearly all explanations of terms regarding sex, sexuality, or gender identity.  Sandwiched in between “cross dresser” and “drag queen” lies an entry that John has circled twice in pencil.
“Oh, and John?”
Strictly speaking, Sherlock isn’t certain that’s correct and he silently prays that John will let it pass.  He does, but not without a slight narrowing of his eyes that clearly telegraphs his suspicions.
“You know,” Sherlock says flatly, “this is all your fault.”
Sherlock pants as if he’s just run a race but his eyes finally focus and lock onto John’s face.  They’re still alight with hysteria and beads of sweat run down from the younger man’s hairline, but at least he’s concentrating on John’s face.  Long slim fingers close around John’s biceps and clamp a hard grip as John pulls them both up to a sitting position.

“—that’s also a remarkably – what’s the term? –
“It’s not your fault,” John says firmly.
The father in question pokes his head around the frame of the kitchen doors to peer into where Sherlock paces the center of the sitting room, Rosie clinging to his chest and burbling happily.  A long divot pinches the space between Sherlock’s brows as the detective peers down at her, his expression a mix of concern and reluctance.
Naturally, he spends the next day writing up the case – which, much to Sherlock’s chagrin, he titles
Sherlock’s fingers come up to massage the bridge of his nose; he can feel a headache building in the tension just under his fingertips.  “Because I’m not even sure that is the right term for me.”

o	March 31 - John's 43rd birthday
*****
John pushes tighter against Sherlock’s back and feels the man quiver against him so he gentles his grip at Sherlock’s arms.  “I’m sorry,” he mumbles.  “I’m sorry, I just … God, say you’ll forgive me for what I did to you, even if I didn’t know.”
“Nope,” John cuts in.  “However capricious you are with your needs for pedestrian things like food and sleep, you’ve never stopped me from treating actual injuries before.  Except that ever since I moved back in here, you haven’t let me have a proper look at anything.  Why?”
“Molly,” John says unnecessarily just before she knocks on the sitting room door.
“Anything above a five is far too dangerous, John,” he says.  “Too much chance that one of us would get hurt or made into a target.”
John kisses him briefly one more time, just because he can, before pulling back and saying, “That sounds like an excellent idea, Papa.”
He can’t deny, however, that it did seem to prompt an interesting reaction.  Sherlock had been stunned and embarrassed but there was an unmistakable flicker of interest in those verdigris eyes.  John may be an idiot compared to Sherlock but he knows what it looks like when someone is eyeing him up and John’s pretty damn certain that Sherlock was just north of openly ogling him.  Good, that’s definitely good.  Interest, John can work with.  Perhaps it’s time John conducted an experiment of his own.
“And as for … all this?” Sherlock jerks his chin towards the flat.  “John, you’re my best friend; Rosie is my god-daughter.  Even if there were nothing more to it than that, even if we hadn’t endured everything we’ve been through together … wouldn’t that be reason enough?”
“Two hours and eleven minutes.  I’m impressed, John; really I am.”
felt attracted.  Maybe it’s arrogant of John to just assume that it would be him, but with Sherlock, who else would it be?
“And you’re not just ‘some poof’.  You’re clearly a bright young man with a boyfriend to be proud of.”
“Stay.”
Sherlock’s deep rumble wobbles and the realization that Sherlock is attempting to stifle sobs horrifies John.
John chuckles at the action.  “Guess it wasn’t up to your standards then, eh?”
“You can see her point, really,” John continues after a moment.  “‘Sherlock’ is a hell of a mouthful for someone who's not even two yet.”  After a sufficiently humorous pause, he adds, “Or anyone, for that matter.”
“Mycroft was having sex,” Sherlock blurts out, his gaze flicking up to John’s face.
John flinches in spite of himself and watches Sherlock’s expression flash from amusement to shock. Turning his face away guiltily, John jumps a bit when Sherlock’s hand clasps his and pulls it away from where he’d wrapped it around Rosie’s middle.
expression but this time it’s paired with a tiny, fond smile and a loose shrug.  “I thought that there’d be a much smaller likelihood of a Child Protection referral on a high-strung long-time bachelor anxious to impress his new live-in boyfriend than a doctor who should have known better and was careless with his tea around his young daughter.”
o	February./March(ish) – Baker Street explodes; events of The Final Problem/end of S4
“Oh, yeah,” John says as casually as he can manage, “that’s my daughter and her mum,” he words it this way very deliberately and refuses to examine why he avoids using the word ‘wife’, “—but here let me show you—”
And they’re off again, running across London as John tries desperately to shake that feeling, whatever the hell it is, out of his chest.
John shakes her hand again and thanks her before turning to head out the front doors.
“Us, John,” Sherlock says.
The most
Squinting through the darkness of the office at the clock on the wall, John says, “Come to think of it, I did tell the owner of the bed and breakfast that we’d be there by 11:30 at the latest.  We should leg it over there so we don’t keep her waiting too long.”
“Daddy loves Papa, too, you know.  Has for some time now.  Probably longer than he cares to examine.”
John’s flush reappears as he steels himself to ask his next question.  Interesting.
“Oi!” John retorts without any heat to it. “I’m not that short.”
sharing a bed with John and resisting his natural inclination for John’s benefit?  A light snuffling noise comes from Sherlock as he nuzzles his face against the pillow and a movement below the covers catches John’s eye: Sherlock has hedged the majority of his body to the edge of the mattress but his left arm, which should have been tucked under his body, extended straight out across the empty space stretching between them with his fingers bowed outwards towards John.  Lifting the covers as slowly and gingerly as he is able, John notes that Sherlock’s hand is tilted in such a way that, before John had rolled over, the backs of Sherlock’s knuckles would have been pressed right up against John’s shoulder blades …. A coincidence?  Or had Sherlock consciously (unconsciously?) reached out to connect to John?
“It’s
“Ironic, coming from you,” John rejoins but he returns Sherlock’s grin as the other man pads out on bare feet, Rosie babbling in his arms.
“You do it when I’m not here then, obviously.”
Sherlock nods.  John shifts again but stops almost immediately when he realizes that the hot press against his arse is getting distinctly more prominent.  He inhales raggedly and Sherlock’s arms tremble.  There’s no denying it: Sherlock is hard against his arse cheeks.
“I ....” Sherlock flounders.  Stupid,
John nods.  “Whenever you’re ready.”

“She’s the only one who has ever helped,” John answers.  “She—I didn’t give her enough credit at the outset, but she has been helpful lately.  We’re—” John stumbles, hums a bit, trying to regroup, “we’re trying to work on my anger issues.  Guilt and anger and … well, I call it ‘emotional constipation’ though I’m sure that’s not the technical term she’s used.”
John hums, perhaps just to show he’s listening.  Several moments of silence go by with both men still staring at the ceiling.  Eventually John speaks again.
“John,” Sherlock attempts.
“A common ailment of the desperately long-limbed, I’m afraid,” Sherlock muses, then slides a slick smirk to John.  “Not that you’d know anything about that.”
“I don’t know what you—”
Sherlock wavers forward, nearly banging into the desk.  Mary pauses on the video as if she’s really there, watching and waiting for him to collect himself.
John lets the room fall back to silence again as his fingers retrace all the marks on Sherlock’s back.  The detective stays quiet but shudders and quakes as John’s touch traverses his skin.  Sherlock doesn’t stop him, though, and the longer things go on, the more he feels Sherlock leaning back into his touch.  Just a tiny, tiny bit but he’s doing it.  John flattens his palms against the back of Sherlock’s shoulder blades, letting his fingers curl up and over.
“Oh, God,” Sherlock mumbles.  “I’m sorry, John, I’m trying not to—”
“Because you’re not—you don’t feel—”
“No use,” Sherlock rejoins, “she’d probably enjoy it.”
“But John, I—” Sherlock curls his arms in front of his chest as if protecting himself from John’s inevitable rejection.
“Play,” John nods at the violin.  “Will you play for me?”

before you came back to London.  And how long were you in London before you came to crash my dinner at The Landmark?”
Sherlock’s lips quirk up in a rueful grin.  “Shouldn’t I be asking you that?”
John freezes.  Apparently that last bit is going to be addressed sooner than he thought.  He turns to find Rosie staring up at Sherlock, question on her face, and Sherlock trying desperately to mask the panic on his features.
“You were talking to the doctor for quite a while,” Sherlock says eventually, his irises almost transparent from the bright light of the screen in the dark cab.
Sherlock tilts his head in confusion but doesn’t get the chance to ask before John answers the unspoken question.
Sherlock sighs heavily and sits back in his chair.  “I really am sorry, John.  I should have considered that seeing me wounded would be … unsettling to you, so close to the anniversary of what happened to Mary.”
“As ever, John, you—”
Sherlock jerks so violently in his chair that John clutches at the man’s leg with his free hand and shushes him.  They lean back together again once John throws the receptionist a tight smile.
“And you…?” the doctor asks, clasping his hand and giving it the same attention as she had the other two people in the room but her eyes flicker back to John.
“We’ve … erm,” Alex stumbles, “only had sex just the once before last night, you see.  So I guess that’s why … I mean, he’s a lot bigger than me – taller, I mean! –” Alex bleats out, turning beat red, “—and he was very keen on it, so I don’t think he realized he was being a bit rough when he was behind me and ….”  Alex trails into silence for a long moment.
low.  At this point, most of what’s keeping the towel above his cock is the fuzz of blonde hair leading down to his groin.
“Thanks.  I’ll toss out a nappy from the loo and I’m sure there’s a spare outfit in there,” John nods to the diaper bag next to the spare cot they keep in Sherlock’s room, “if you don’t mind getting her dressed while I get myself sorted and pack our bags.”
“So you’ve said.  I’m waiting to hear what the request in question is before I agree to honor it.”
John can’t help but snigger.  “Leave it to you to be an expert in the ponciest martial art out there.”
Sherlock gives an exaggerated eye roll that reminds him forcefully of his toddler.  “I’m not hiding anything, I simply have no desire for your particular brand of molly-coddling over nothing.”
“Yep,” John says and retreats towards the loo.  “You don’t have to wait up for me.  I won’t be long.”
“John, you most certainly are not that sort of father,” Sherlock remonstrates in a harsh whisper.  “You dropped the cup by accident—”
Sherlock huffs.  “I forgave you the instant it happened, John.”

“Huh,” John responds, amused.  “Now I know your grand plan for retirement: Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, scientist … beekeeper.”

Leaning his head back against the cool porcelain of the tub, John stares at the ceiling and ruminates about what in the bloody fuck he’s going to do about this.  Not much he
John puts up two fingers at him, trying to cover his lingering surprise at Sherlock’s blithe declaration.

then.  If … that’s what you’d like to hear.”
“I dreamed about Mary.”
“—and now you want to spend an evening at a bed-and-breakfast in the middle of nowhere for a case you could solve inside two hours?”
The detective straightens.  “Modifications, John.  I could hardly have volatile chemicals or decaying body parts sitting out where Rosie could reach them, so I rented the basement flat from Mrs. Hudson and set up my experiments downstairs.”  Whatever Sherlock sees on John’s face in that moment brings a high flush to his cheeks, causing the detective to mumble, “Wouldn’t want to waste valuable materials and specimens.”
“John,” Sherlock begins but the anguish in the deep baritone pulls too hard at a fresh wound.
“What is it?” John asks, spoon still clutched in his fingers from stirring an ungodly amount of sugar into his friend’s tea.  He sets it down on the counter and jogs into the sitting room when his friend’s expression melts into one of sorrow.  “What’s the matter?”
Sherlock stares at him for another moment then unbuttons the Belstaff, pulls John into his chest, and wraps the jacket around the two of them.  John jerks back in surprise but Sherlock’s arms lock around him and yank him forward again.  The move presses John’s forehead into the hollow of Sherlock’s throat and his nose bumps against the detective’s collarbone.
is different.  He feels wound up like a bed spring now, second-guessing every action, trying not to appear too fond but at the same time trying not to overcompensate and be too distant.  At first he thinks he’s doing an okay job of it despite feeling like he’s been thrown back to his teen years.  It’s entirely too reminiscent of those days when everything about fancying someone felt so important and loaded.  Except that this is important and loaded, and it’s driving him round the twist.  Somewhere around day three, he realizes that Sherlock has taken to watching him like a hawk.  Apparently he’s not done as well as he thought.  Sherlock has always been the actor, after all.  John takes a few more shifts at the clinic the upcoming week, hoping that burying himself in sniffling children and adults too embarrassed to go to their GP will keep his mind off bloody Sherlock.
Possessed of an odd mood in the moment, John performs a tiny experiment: he slides his hand slowly towards Sherlock’s, extends a finger, and traces the deep lines etched across the center of the long, warm palm face up on the mattress between them.  Sherlock gives a sudden deep inhale, his fingers extending out like the petals of a flower seeking sun but then closing over John’s, trapping the tip of his pointer finger in a loose grip.  John studies Sherlock’s face carefully but the detective’s features remain relaxed in sleep, so John opens his hand and brushes the rest of his fingertips across the backs of Sherlock’s fingers.  The fine-boned hand opens and Sherlock’s fingers swirl over his, gently caressing as they move back and forth, around and between John’s own; a small smile appears on the bowed lips and they puff out a bit with an exhaled breath as Sherlock snuggles deeper into the pillow.  John’s chest feels too tight.
The silence that follows is telling.  “It’s the most common one, yes.”
“I dislike assumptions, John,” Sherlock cuts in quickly.  “Gross generalizations seldom apply to me.  Labels exist simply to help define the world for less able minds and only serve to jam people like me into a box that rarely fits.”
Sherlock doesn’t disappoint, though.  “When are you meeting her?”
He feints for a hurt tone.  “I thought you enjoyed getting out of the city.”
When their lips press together, Sherlock gasps noisily against John’s mouth before opening his lips to surround John’s.  It’s fairly chaste, as kisses go; just a gentle movement of mouths against each other and not even a hint of tongues, but John feels it down to his toes.  Sherlock unwinds his arms from around his own ribcage to cup his hands around John’s face, palms splayed against John’s cheeks, fingertips massaging his skin where they start to run into his hair.  John’s fingers clutch at Sherlock’s hips and pull him closer.  When John’s teeth clamp down on Sherlock’s heavy bottom lip just enough to scrape the delicate skin, the detective gasps and keens out a low

“No sad,” Rosie bleats with a puckered frown.  “No sad, Shock.”
The heavy brows wrinkle in consternation.  “You’ve done it dozens of times before and never gotten this bothered by it.  Why is this one so different?”
“You don’t have to—” It’s a husky whisper now.
“Of course it matters.”  John’s voice stays quiet but that earnest firmness that is so quintessentially
Sherlock finally brings his gaze up to John’s face and he feels wrong-footed in that he has no idea what to make of the mixture of emotions chasing across John’s face.  He’s not even sure he can name them all.

Sherlock strides over swiftly.  “I am well aware of our predicament, John.  Blaming me won’t get us out of here, but by all means, use up all your oxygen if it makes you feel better.”
“What if I did?” John stays calm.  Oddly calm, now that they’ve come right to it.
“I’m already making one in my head, Mycroft.”  He fingers the syringe.  “It’s very long.”
Sherlock reaches a hand into John’s lap and weaves his fingers together with John’s, compressing his hand in a tight grip when John jumps in surprise.
Sherlock.  I know that usually doesn’t even register to you but I’m patching you up from a
have no interest in sex with other people, which implies that right now is the exception.  So there’s … there’s a man you feel that way about right now?”
John hadn’t noticed that Sherlock stopped breathing until the detective’s chest rattles with a few large gulps of air, making him wobble backwards into John’s supporting hands.
This gets Sherlock’s attention.  John’s voice remains just the tiniest bit stiff but he’s clearly angling for a casual tone and the fact that he’s attempting to continue the conversation as if there’s nothing odd about the situation certainly deviates from John’s normal attitude about these things.  While Sherlock would never go so far as to call John prudish, he’s always been ruthless about boundaries when it comes to ‘personal space’ – insisting, rather justifiably, that Sherlock has no concept of it whatsoever – so the fact that he’s openly conversing with Sherlock while naked in the bath with his daughter is peculiar to say the least.  When Sherlock catches John’s gaze again, he can see tension bunched in the doctor’s arms but John simply readjusts the cloth at his crotch and looks up to Sherlock with a questioning expression.
It takes a minute to sink in.  “Absolutely not.”
More and more over the next ten minutes, Sherlock convinces himself that he’s never going to survive this night without humiliating himself and potentially ruining their entire friendship.  He’s been on high alert all evening, starting from practically the moment they got on the train to come out to this forsaken place.  There’d been a gross profusion of people on the evening train out of the city – already enough to get Sherlock’s nerves on edge but also adding the stressor of forcing John to sit next to him on the bench seat, pressed very close up against Sherlock’s side to make room for more people in the compartment.  Feeling every centimeter of contact and degree of heat from John’s body, Sherlock finds his thoughts constantly skittering away every time the train rocks and pushes John more tightly against him.  They’ve had gar greater physical contact before but back then, Sherlock had been blissfully unacquainted with the appearance of nearly every inch of John’s unclothed body, and that knowledge currently serves to drive Sherlock insane.  Every jolt of the carriage compels some other part of John’s body against him and reminds him of the sleek slenderness of the doctor’s calves, the solid muscles of his thighs, the creamy skin of his chest marred in one spot by the scar that Sherlock’s never before been allowed to see, the golden fuzz trailing across his belly.  More than once, Sherlock can’t quite stifle a small grunt when John brushes against him, causing John to put out a hand and touch his forearm, a wrinkle of concern creasing his friend’s brow as John asks him what’s wrong.  The one time John’s fingers alight upon his thigh, Sherlock actually stumbles into the people sitting across the way in his haste to get up.  Only at the last moment does he think to face away from John as he slides out towards the safety of the corridor, mumbling some flimsy excuse as to why he needs to flee, trying to hide the evidence of a blooming erection because of John’s touch.  John doesn’t see it but the man kitty-corner must get a hint before the folds of his coat camouflage his state; the man’s eyes flicker between Sherlock’s reddening face and John’s confused one.  Sherlock curses the hint of a smirk on the other man’s lips and darts away as quickly as possible.  Staying away as long as he dares, Sherlock grumbles under his breath when he returns to find John chatting pleasantly with the amused witness and, to his humiliation, the man favors him with a Cheshire grin when Sherlock reseats himself with a load huff.
the blush occur.  “Really?”
“I wasn’t good enough, John.  Fast enough.  Every mark you see is a monument to my failure.”
to say the complete opposite.
John’s eyebrows wing up because that time, the word ‘sock’ may have had a bit of an ‘h’ in it.
Rosie nods then yawns loudly, her eyelids drooping as she leans forward against Sherlock’s chest.  “Nap,” Sherlock mutters and practically scurries away to his bedroom where they’d placed an extra bassinet for her to nap in while they were downstairs working on cases.
“Your violin sounds upset, anyway,” he quips.
Rosie pats his cheek again and John turns her to face him completely.  With his daughter straddling his knee, gazing up into his face with a mixture of trust and concern, his life feels far simpler than it did a half hour ago inside Baker Street.
toy because something – or everything – about it would arouse you enough that you knew it would make you come the hardest and the fastest.”
“Well then, if you don’t mind ….” Sherlock answers as if he’s been interrupted shaving or combing his hair or something else equally innocuous.
John returns the smile.  “Did I miss anything?”
“John, I—”
Another moment of pondering and then Sherlock snatches up the disc and moves over to the floo.  He hesitates just a moment, his fingers clutching the disc; stupid, really, but some sentimental part of him wants to preserve – if only for a moment – that it had been said out loud: “you’re in love with John.”  John starts to walk over to Sherlock, clearly unsettled, which makes up Sherlock’s mind for him.  He pitches the disc into the grate, silently thankful that it lands title-side down where John cannot get a hint of its nature.
when John finishes bathing.  The second bath he’s taken today and the second one in which
“I was just then.  Rosie got hurt because I was … distracted.”
The little girl puckers her lips and giggles when John kisses her with a resounding smack.  John puts a hand on Sherlock’s chest but before he can ask the obvious next question, Rosie raises a hand and pats her fat palms against the detective’s lips.
“But look at all the people she will be surrounded by who love her.  She will grow up without a mum, but she will have all those other people who will love her and care for her and protect her: Mrs. Hudson, Molly, Lestrade, Mycroft even—”
“Tomorrow,” John croaks.
It takes a few minutes but the rest of the tension drains out of Sherlock.  He just breathes and clutches his hand in the front of John’s t-shirt and listens to the slow, steady thud of John’s heart beating beneath his ear.
“Can’t you just take off the damn shirt?” John growls, desperate to change the subject.  “You’re not exactly modest and I can’t get a good look at what I’m doing if I don’t have good lighting.  Why the hell would you insist on keeping it on anyway?”
“‘Papa’ is a term reserved for
John remains silent for a long while before asking the last question he can’t quite seem to get his head around.  “Why are you doing all of this for me?  After everything I’ve done ... Jesus, Sherlock, I beat you to a bloody pulp back in that hospital.” Sherlock opens his mouth, most likely to protest with some practiced answer, but John steams on.  “Whatever I was going through, whatever I thought about your role in Mary’s death, nothing –
people when they’re holding a bloody weapon?”
Sherlock gives her the same story as he’d given the nurse only with a little more charm and a little less anxiety.  More than once, John notes that every time the doctor’s focus shifts to John, Sherlock’s hand alights somewhere on John’s body: first the back of his knuckles against John’s elbow, then a palm over his wrist, and when Dr. Simon favors John with a bright smile, spread fingers that linger on John’s thigh.  That last one has John falling back on his military training so he won’t let the surprise show on his face.  After the quick recitation of the story, Dr. Simon reaches out both hands towards Rosie so John hands her over, murmuring to her when the girl whines a bit in protest.
He gives John a push for good measure and then follows him up to the Attic Room.  Three steps into the room, Sherlock scans it with his eyes.  Well, it is what it says on the tin: an attic converted into a bedroom.  Despite Sherlock’s anxiety at being forced to share it with John after the fiasco that has been his self-restraint today, he privately admits that it is decent enough and will likely be quite nice tomorrow morning when the sun comes in the high windows on either side of the space.  The bed is directly in front of them as they walk in – which catches John’s focus as he strides over and deposits his bag upon it – with the couch to the right and a desk tucked in under the window to the left.  Behind him stands a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf recessed into the wall, flanked by a door that is most likely the advertised ensuite loo.  Sherlock’s fingers skim over the books, cataloguing the titles in his mind, until he hears John clear his throat.  With glance over his shoulder, Sherlock sees the tension in John’s frame as John faces away from him, looking between the bed and the couch.  Sherlock can’t see the expression on the doctor’s face but the tightness of John’s voice speaks volumes.
“You’re being childish.”
too good, he corrects his brain) at what she does –
"Yes, but listen!" Sherlock exclaims, picking up his pacing again. "If you were dying, if you'd been murdered, in your very last seconds, what would you say."
"She didn't think about her daughter, she scratched her name on the floor. She was dying, it took effort, it would've hurt. She was trying to tell us something!"
"They were in the microwave."
Sending over the address to Lestrade, he responds:
Grace looks to the table between the two men and sees two vials, one in front of the taxi driver and one in front of where Sherlock was once standing, both presumably with poisonous pills inside. Looking out the window to the building across from them she sees John who has been trying to grab her attention since she entered the room. She lifts her hand to tell John to pause as she watches the scene in front of her unfold.
“Brilliant!” John exclaims, scribbling notes down on his notepad. Sherlock tilts his head to look at the man, thrown off for just a second by the interruption.
"I'll have the gun please," another voice says, who she recognizes as Sherlock.
"Thank you so much, Mrs. Hudson. I appreciate it. I really must head out now, but see you boys at the Gardens." After one last wave to Mrs. Hudson, Grace heads after Lestrade.
Seeing Sherlock leave, John sinks lower into his chair with a sigh. After just 30 seconds, Sherlock pops back in. "You're a doctor".
“Why? Why are you saying that?”
"I don't even smoke!" He pulls up his sleeve, showing the nicotine patches on his arm. Lestrade does the same showing similar patches.
"Any good?"
Wearily, Lestrade replies, "Okay, fine." He pulls out his notebook.
"Well! This could be very nice. Very nice indeed. Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out," John notes.
"Starving," he turns to Grace. "Hungry?"
"It's your day off. Go enjoy it or at least go unpack your flat and make it livable. You need a day off, you've been working since the minute you landed in London."
"Thanks so much for getting this together for me so quickly, Mrs. Hudson. It's been so difficult trying to find a new apartment, um, flat, while starting work at the Yard," Grace explains, following Mrs. Hudson down the stairs. "I don't want to put Greg out for too long, though. He's really been so helpful - an angel really."
“The wedding ring, ten years old at least. The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding rings - state of her marriage, right there. The inside of the rings are shinier than the outside - that means they’re regularly removed; the only polishing they get is when she works them off her finger. It’s not for work - look at her nails, she doesn’t work with her hands - so what, or rather who, does she remove her rings for? Clearly not one lover - she’d never sustain the fiction of being single over time - so more likely a string of them. Simple!”
Sherlock leaps past him, going straight to the pills and the bottles that are now scattered on the floor. He grabs them and examines them, but there's no way to tell them apart.
The area is cordoned off, police vehicles everywhere. Grace sees Lestrade exiting a car to look up at the building above. He makes eye contact with her, still visibly shaken, and runs full speed through the entrance. Less than a minute later, he bursts through the door to find Grace, still splattered in blood, and Sherlock standing over a dead body.
"Goodnight, Mr. Holmes," Grace nods before jogging to catch up with John who has already started to walk away.
“Fantastic!” John exclaims, once again.
Looking at his mobile, a message reads, "COME WITH ME."
"What, my face is?" Anderson scoffs.
Grace behind him, greets them, "Hello again Mr. Holmes. Dr. Watson." John nods.
“Dear God, what’s it like in your funny little brains, it must be so boring. Her coat!”
"What do you think, Dr. Watson?" Mrs. Hudson, a bubbling older lady asks excitedly. "There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms…"
"Sherlock, you don't need to do this," Grace says.
"You're not bored now, are you?" Grace's attention snaps back to the cabbie detaining her. "And isn't it good?" he whispers into her ear.
"Sherlock, dear this taxi driver!" Mrs. Hudson calls out again.
"So I know he's kind of eccentric, but did you think that was weird?" Grace asks, scanning the room to see if Lestrade was nearby to see the encounter. The Detective Inspector is across the room fielding complaints from Anderson about Sherlock's treatment towards him tonight.
"Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments," Anderson mocks. "Yeah, sociopath, seeing it now."
Sherlock glances at him, contemplating how to proceed.
"This is Detective White. Detective White, you have a horrible habit of interrupting. I'm in the middle of a conversation with this man," Sherlock says dryly.
"Sir?" Andrea has opened the car door open for him.
“It’s wet.”
“I have a feeling we don’t have to,” she nods to the door, intrigued by the tall detective with the curly hair and the long black coat.
"Grace, from Scotland Yard."
"Who's on Forensics?"
"Hmm...then you'll take it? The other room."
"Lucky guess."
Taking a deep breath and avoiding eye contact, Grace replies, "That's correct, Mr. Holmes. You never cease to amaze me."
"Well of course we'll be needing two," John insists, flustered.
"Oh, I wouldn't say that…" Sherlock mulls.
"It's for shock, Sherlock. Though, it seems like Grace should be the one in the blanket, not you."
"We know he didn't," John explains.
"Yeah, of course. I'll hopefully know if I'll be seeing the place soon, if Sherlock ever comes back from his suitcase hunt. How should I reach you?"
"Perhaps we will be seeing more of each other, Dr. Watson. It sounds like Sherlock won't be giving up on this case just yet."
"He won't be your assistant."
Sherlock calmly, coldly places a foot on him, near his wound. "You're dying, but there's still time to hurt you. Give me a name." He presses down harder. "A name! Now!"
"My mother, Evelyn, passed away from breast cancer when I was 8. My brother's name is Oliver, but he was born Amadi."
“She’s one of the suicides. The fourth one.”
"Lestrade."
Sherlock starts leading the way. "There's a good Chinese, end of Baker Street - stays open 'til two. You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle."
"Oh for goodness sake! I occupy a minor post in the British Government," Mycroft explains.
Looking back to John with wide eyes, she sees him pacing the room opposite to them before turning back to the window and motioning frantically for her to duck. Heart racing, Grace bends forward to duck as far as she can with the cabbie holding her arm back. A loud crack rings through the air, and the window suddenly explodes with shattered glass. Grace and the cabbie fall to the ground.
"But we've got nothing to go on."
"I would like that, but I don't know if I will be continuing as well."
"Yes, yes, how nice and dedicated you are to your work. Now who is Rachel?" Sherlock asks again, annoyed at the interruption.
"Will you come?" Lestrade asks again, not keen to wasting any additional time.
"A drugs bust."
“Suitcase?”
"No you didn't."
"No! Anderson's my sniffer dog."
"Why do I have this blanket?" Sherlock asks Lestrade as he ducks under the police tape. "They keep putting a blanket on me."
"Why would they find anything?" Grace interrupts, brow furrowed and shooting a questioning look over to John. Meeting her gaze, John shrugs, shaking his head, frustrated at the drama of the situation.
"I nearly can. You did get shot though?"
"Ignore all that. It's the shock talking!" Sherlock snatches back the blanket and puts it over his shoulder, walking over to John.
"Really, what do you think, Sherlock? Can you beat me? Are you clever enough? Are you really sure? Bet your life?" the cabbie continues to goad him, daring him to take the pill.
"Bit of advice. Stay away from that guy. Both of you."
"Yeah, something seems off. He got a message on his phone, then turned pale as a ghost" John replies and looks out the window to see Sherlock get inside the back of a taxi and drive away. "He's headed out in a taxi, too, but I thought he said he didn't order one."
The two share a worried look. Glancing at the screen, Grace notes, "Wait. The tracker for the phone - it's moving."
"Almost. I'm a natural blonde," she smiles jokingly. "But I don't have a New York accent. How did you know I lived there?"
"Yes, dear, that sounds nice. I'm guessing you're Detective White? John mentioned you were looking for a room. Do come by again, I'll clean up the extra flat downstairs and you can take a look."
"Wait. Grace and John followed me?"
“We can’t just wait!” Lestrade yells, becoming more and more tired with the game Sherlock is playing.
“Where’s her case? Come on, where is it? Did she eat it? Someone else was here - and they took the case. So the killer must have driven her here - forgot the case was in the car…”
"Losing it, in fact," Mycroft replies, gloating slightly.
"But I need an assistant."
"You have just killed a man."
"Who's that?" Grace asks, never having seen the mysterious and dangerous looking man before.
"She's dead."
Mrs. Hudson enters the flat. In the shadowed hallway beyond her someone else is standing
"I upset her? Me? It wasn't me who upset her, Mycroft."
"Your detective came to a crime scene unarmed and put herself in the line of fire. Maybe, next time, send someone who knows how to do their job," Sherlock chastises. "If the shooter in the building across from us wasn't there, she could have found herself the one on the floor instead."
“Sorry, I’ll shut up.”
John steps forward, kneeling by the body. Sherlock joins him, looking at John, waiting for a response.
"Sherlock? You okay?" John asks.
Despite himself, he knows Sherlock is right. Lestrade turns and walks away to lean against the wall, but leaves the man to work.
Sherlock gives him a look, considering it.
Looking down at her phone, Grace sees a brightly lit screen with a text from Lestrade.
Sherlock stares at the text, frozen to his spot by the laptop.
“Pink?”
"Yes, I will."
"Oh, shut up Anderson," he snaps. Peering over his shoulder to look at him he accuses, "And who told you you could turn back around? Turn away now, go on. You're slowing the investigation down."
"Yes, yes. Why that woman loves to interrupt," Sherlock laments, annoyed.
“There wasn’t a case,” Grace explains. “We’ve searched the whole building.”
"Wait, what?" Grace directs at Lestrade. "You didn't tell me you found Rachel."
"I've just met the man. A mutual friend introduced us - we were supposed to just be flatmates, not crime-solving partners or anything like that."
“How do you know she had a case?”
“I’m sorry. Please, go on,” Grace gestures to the body.
"What?"
"Sherlock, that's him. That's the guy I was talking about…" John says, gesturing over to a well-dressed, thin man making his way over to them.
Grace looks away, trying not to meet his eye.
"You could maybe keep your voice down a bit." He says, chuckling again. John notices Sally Donovan a little distance away, staring at them with Grace, now in a clear shirt and a blanket around her shoulders."
"He's your brother?" John asks, still shocked.
"Greg studied under my father before he left London to go to America. My father, Arthur, worked for Scotland Yard, as well."
"No matter that," Sherlock cuts him off. "We need to go after the shooter."
"Oh! Interesting!" He reaches for the bottle he placed in front of Sherlock and uncaps it, removing the pill. "What do you think? Shall we?"
"Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and Detective White," he answers before turning back to enter through the open car door and driving away.
"You know why he's here? He's not paid or anything. He likes it. He gets off on it. Weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what? One day just showing up won't be enough. One day we'll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one who put it there."
"Course I wasn't. Playing for time. Knew you and John would show up,"
"What's he doing here? On a drugs bust?"
John and Sherlock step into the room and look around. The room is fairly large and well furnished, but a giant mess. Newspapers, books, an assortment of weapons and research materials scatter every surface of the flat. A skull sits on the mantelpiece.
"Ah, Mrs. Hudson, Detective Lestrade and I are old family friends and now co-workers, nothing more."
John cringes.
John laughs, "Oh, come on, seriously? This guy, a junkie? Have you met him?"
Sherlock slowly crosses back to the table and points to the bottle in front of the taxi driver.
"You know, the other day he was making such a fuss that Sherlock, yelling something about trying to find a suitcase and that it had to be pink, not magenta, for some odd reason. Who knows what goes on in that head of his," she explains, waving her hand in the air, mimicking Sherlock's unpredictable movements.
Grace flinches at the memory, almost forgotten for a second.
He goes to the dying man, shoving the pill bottles in his face, crazed, "Was I right? I was, wasn't I? Did I get it right?"
221B Baker Street
"She is ordinary. Thus she is annoying. I deal with enough annoying ordinary people as is. Now, John, I must see myself out," the taller of the men turns to the door. "And I thought it was going to be a boring evening. Serial suicides, and now a note - oh, it's Christmas!"
"Why not?"
"Hello, Detective White. I assume we'll be seeing more of each other," Mycroft holds out one hand.
"It's an experiment."
Sherlock looks at her for a moment, affronted, and before a small smile appears on his lips for just a second before dropping back into a scowl."
"But this is what you're really addicted to, isn't it? This is the only fix that works. You'll do anything, anything at all - not to be bored."
Sally Donovan turns, holding a beaker. "Are these human eyes?"
"It actually is a childish feud," John says, disbelief at the situation waning.
"Yes, right." John moves to the chair on the left. "This one is nicer anyway."
“She never made it to her hotel Look at her hair - colour coordinates her lipstick and her shoes, she’d never have left a hotel with her hair still like…” He stops. “Oh! Oh…”
"Mrs. Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother?" He quips annoyed at the constant interruptions. Turning to Lestrade, he holds his laptop open to show the others. "Get some vehicles ready, get a helicopter, we need to move fast - that phone battery won't last forever."
Ignoring her, Sherlock stares intensely at Lestrade. "I'm clean."
"No, sorry, wait, wait - Mummy? Who's Mummy?" John asks, incredulous.
"John, you probably want to shut up now…"
"I still have questions for you."
"You're not a soldier," he continues. "Not to mention that fact that it is statistically less likely for you to have been one, but a soldier would never run into combat, unarmed. No - you read more like the victim. Hyperventilating, unable to look at the body on the ground, or my interrogation."
"Stop the taxi, please!" John yells to the driver up front. The taxi slows down to a stop outside two identical, tall college buildings. The tracker stopped on this street, but the signal has been lost in the building itself.
"You can read everyone, can't you, Mr. Holmes? What do you read from me?"
"No…"
"Of course, yes, he is my brother."
"You can take a 50-50 chance, or I can shoot you through the head. Funnily enough, no one's ever gone for that option," a voice she doesn't recognize threatens.
“Must have been at least a few hours since she was in the rain given that it’s still wet, but not soaked. It hasn’t been raining in London, though.”
"No you can't," John replies.
"Thank you," John smiles.
"I'm okay, Mrs. Hudson. Greg is coming over with a moving van to drop some things over in about an hour. Thought I'd just hop on over to the grocery store quickly to grab a few things to stock the fridge before he arrives. But thank you for the offer."
"Anyway, I texted it and he phoned back," John elaborates the missing piece to Sherlocks tirade.
"I'm okay…" her voice is shaky, still in shock before looking back to the taxi driver gasping on the floor.
“Obvious, isn’t it?”
Turning to look at her coat, the John and Lestrade seem confused. Just a Sherlock is about to explain (or rather show-off again), a voice interrupts.
"Oh, but they're just for my hip. They're herbal soothers."
“Fun?? There is a woman lying dead!”
"Unless he got rid of it," Lestrade argues.
"I don't know, I could tell he was pleased with your compliments," Grace smiles. "By the way, you said you were looking for an apartment, sorry, flat with Sherlock right?"
"Okay. We'll pull you in tomorrow. Off you go."
"I volunteered," Anderson states plainly, snapping his gloves. "We all did."
But before he can get an answer, Sherlock is hurrying down the stairs. "I'm fine!" He calls behind him as he races out the door.
"Brixton. Lauriston Gardens," Lestrade says, not missing a beat.
“It’s murder,” Sherlock continues, “All of them. I don’t know how, but they’re not suicides, they’re killings - serial killings. We’ve got a serial killer. Love those, there’s always something to look forward to.”
"Mrs. Hudson!" Sherlock yells before continuing, "Oh, she was clever. Clever, yes, I love her! She's cleverer than you lot dead! Do you see? Do you get it? She didn't lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted in on him. When she got out that car, she knew she was going to her death. She left the phone to lead us to her killer! Rachel, don't you see? Rachel!" Sherlock turns to the other policemen, "Oh, look at you lot, you're all so vacant! What's it like, not being me, it must be so relaxing. Rachel is not a name."
“Oh, we’re done waiting. Look at her! Really, look! Houston,” Sherlock shouts, turning to look pointedly at Grace, “We have a mistake! Get on to Cardiff, find Jennifer Wilson’s family and friends - find Rachel.”
"Um, yes, is that...a problem?" John rubs the back of his head nervously.
“Cardiff?” Lestrade asks, trying desperately to keep up with the story Sherlock has so easily deduced less than five minutes after entering the crime scene.
"Come on. Play the game."
" .uk," he reads aloud off the tag on the suitcase.
Watching horrified, John screams out, and Grace can make out his lips yelling, "Sherlock!", slamming his fists against the window panes unable to do anything.
"Oh dear, they're making such a mess. What are they looking for?" she says worried.
"Hmm… weird, maybe he was searching one of the other floors of the building. I'll have to go ask Grace…"
"Donovan!" Lestrade calls, and Sally turns to walk away, but not before warning, "Stay away from Sherlock Holmes."
"Name him!"
"Oh, God, yes!"
Now they're both giggling like schoolboys.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock yells at Lestrade. The room is full of policemen searching the flat. Decked in a rubber gloves and crime scene gear, they look under and around every corner of the room.
"You said the victims all took the poison themselves. Somehow he makes them take it. Maybe he ... I dunno, talks to them. Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow," John suggests.
"Enough with the disgusting leering. You're really trying to stick yourself in the gross old man box, aren't you?" Sherlock jeers as the cabbie turns his attention back to Sherlock. "Well, this has been most interesting. I look forward to your court case. Please tell me you brought your handcuffs, Detective White," Sherlock rants, walking over to the exit.
“Yes, I’ve just moved to London last week. It’s nice to meet you, Sherlock,” Grace moves to shake his hand but lowers it when it isn’t returned. “You as well, Dr. Watson”.
"Close enough," Sherlock answers waving his hand in the air.
"Ah, yes, well I won't bother you for too much longer then. Let me show you around the flat a bit," Mrs. Hudson says walking around the flat. "Here's the living room and the kitchen. The laundry's right over there with that closet. Your room is over here and across is the door for the loo. I hope this is alright, I had to do quite a bit of cleaning to get it up to living standards."
"I'm dealing with a child. Sherlock, this is our case! I'm letting you in, but you don't go off on your own - clear?"
“American.”
“There wasn’t a case. There was never any suitcase here,” Lestrade says, exasperated, as Sherlock pushes past him and down the stairs.
"It's okay, we're even," Grace chuckles, but turns to Sherlock and her smile fades. "You were going to take the damn pill, weren't you?"
"Yes, but he's dragged me to this crime scene just after meeting him. I haven't even had the chance to look at the place yet."
John and Grace share a look. Breaking the silence, she says, "Seems kind of dramatic. I haven't been here too long, but I'm starting to tell which ones in the department are the realists and which are the conspiracy theorists." Grace nods over to inspectors Donovan and Anderson.
"Yes, well, we will be needing two bedrooms," John tries to change the subject. "Actually, do you have another flat that's open?"
Ignoring the greeting, Sherlock asks Lestrade, "What's different about this one. You wouldn't have come to get me, if there wasn't something new."
"Put them back," Sherlock demands.
"Well? Shall we play? For real, shall we? You get bored, I know you do - a man like you, so clever. But what's the point in being clever if you can't prove it."
"Interesting." Mycroft muses. "Well, I don't suppose you're in need of any extra money, are you?"
“Yeah, where is it? She must have a phone or an organiser - we can find out who Rachel is.”
“Not obvious to me,” John says flatly.
"Dr. Watson. Mr. Holmes," she nods to the men.
John pays the driver quickly. "We need to head up now. This doesn't feel right."
"I see, same as Dr. Watson then. I supposed my dear brother has a weird way of picking up interesting characters in his adventures," he waves in the direction of John. "Are you moving in with them as well, then? Seems my brother has been trying to compile a collection of strangers to cohabitate with."
"This is it," she says, turning to John. "The tracker stopped moving right outside these buildings up ahead."
Chapter 1: The Suitcase
"Ok then. Tell me this. Your sponsor - who is it?"
"Keep looking, guys," Lestrade instructs. Turning to Sherlock he says, "Or you could start helping me properly, and I'll stand them down."
“Asphyxiation probably. Passed out, and choked on her own vomit. Can’t smell any alcohol on her  -- could’ve been a seizure, possibly drugs.”
"I can always predict the fortune cookies," Sherlock brags.
"Detective White?"
"So when you say you're concerned about him, you actually are concerned about him," John asks Mycroft.
"Then give this to her, I don't need it." Sherlock throws the blanket at Lestrade, striding off.
"Sergeant Donovan's been explaining about everything. The two pills - dreadful business, dreadful," John laments.
One word is ripped from the taxi driver: "Moriarty!". His head falls to the side as he succumbs to his wounds.
"Of course, dear, let me know if you need any help settling in. I can get the boys to help you move your bed into your room if you'd like."
"Rachel," Grace answers.
"Obviously I can straighten things up a bit."
"Sorry," He calls out. "Sorry, just...nerves."
"I don't have to." John says flatly.
"A conversation? Did you not notice the gun pointed at you, Sherlock?"
"Yes, well, I am brilliant," he says haughtily. Turning to John, he asks, "Dinner?"
"Detective Inspector Lestrade. You're close to him given the familiarity of speech and the way you collapsed into his shoulder after the shooting upstairs. But it's not a romantic relationship, but more of a familial one. No relation, but there's history, most likely a family friend."
"Oh, but that was ages ago - why would she still be upset?"
"You know how they never leave notes? This one did. Will you come?"
, " Grace struggles against the cabbie still holding her arm behind her back.
"Because he's a psychopath. And psychopaths get bored," she says matter-of-factly.
“Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase - was there a suitcase in this house?” Sherlock calls out to the other forensic officers.
"I've barely met you, Sherlock. And no, I still want to move in 221B. I'm just doing her a favor."
Grace waves Mrs. Hudson out with a smile before closing the door and looking around. This was going to be an interesting weekend.
Annoyed, but nevertheless curious, John turns to the woman once again. Leaning in closer, he notices an off-putting scent and sniffs the air near her mouth briefly.
“Maybe she checked into her hotel, left her case there,” John suggests.
John hesitated for a few seconds before answering, just to smile down at the sight of sleeping Sherlock. He remembered that day clearly, another mystery solved, another victory. Sherlock was so tired that day that John did not have to make him go to bed, the moment Sherlock put his head on the pillow, he fell asleep. His mouth was slightly opened and that allowed a trickle of saliva to run down his chin.
John had a feeling as though the world around him was frozen. He had a strange sensation that something bad was going to happen. There was nobody around him yet he had a feeling as though he was being watched by at least five different pair of eyes, each one from a different direction.
John's heart was ready to explode. His heartbeat, at that moment, was the highest he'd ever had. In fact, it must have been higher than his former patient's that were coming to their appointments with various heart diseases. He was hoping he wouldn't end up having a heart attack.
"Hello?" John said into the speaker, scared of what he might have heard.
"You do."
John watched as Sherlock lowered his arm and threw something onto the ground. His phone, the signal of a broken phone call told him so. Sherlock's coat was flyin with the wind making the white shirt more visible in the daylight. John hastily hid his phone in one of the pockets but did not move in any direction, having Sherlock's previous words at the back of his head.
." He could hear himself whispering.
"I'm a fake," Were those tears coming through Sherlock's voice? "The newspapers were right all along."
"John." There came a short response from Sherlock.
"There is nobody that truly deserves you, John." It was a whisper, such a quiet whisper, that John almost didn't hear the words.
"Okay, shut up, Sherlock, shut up," John interrupted, "Please, please,
"John, look up, I'm on the rooftop." Sherlock finally spoke, a lot calmer that time.
He felt a grip on his arm. Somebody was trying to stop him from getting any closer to the body laying in a pool of blood. John was saying "
Sherlock jumped. John's world fell apart.
There was a pause and John's anxiety was growing stronger and scarier. He was calling Sherlock's name over and over again praying he'd get any sign of life from him.
In which the tragedy happens.
"Sherlock, will you tell me what's going on?" John begged. "You're scaring the shit out of me."
John saw a group of people at where Sherlock had probably landed. He tried to get through to him, but they could not hear him calling he was a doctor and wanted to come through.
"No, don't." He managed to regain his voice.
He heard a thud. He had known it was Sherlock's body, although he physically could not see him fall onto the pavement. His head was dizzy and he could barely stand, but put himself together and forced his legs to run. He run and run, he was hit by a man on a bicycle and found himself laying on the cold concrete. It took all the virtue he still had to get up and continue walking in Sherlock's direction.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This phone call is my note. It's what people do, don't they? Leave a note?"
John sucked it up and made a few steps back. Now he was standing in the exact spot he was, when he first had heard his phone calling.
"An apology." Two words? Really? John had thought that he deserved to hear something more.
"Goodbye, John."
"John," Sherlock began, voice shaking "Just do as I ask, please."
Finally, he managed to grab Sherlock's wrist.
"It's all true, everything they said about me." At that moment, John wished he hadn't wanted the whole explanation. Sherlock's words pierced him like millions of tiny, almost invisible, pieces of shattered glass. He did not believe Sherlock. Not at all.
Warning of mentions of an attempted suicidal jump.
John thought he must have misheard Sherlock's words. 'The roof'? What would Sherlock be doing on the roof. Slowly, he did as he was told. There still was a little hope that Sherlock was only playing a stupid, immature joke on him and that he actually was not standing on the edge of the hospital roof. The sky was cloudless, so the sun caused him to see everything around him blurried. It took him more than just a few seconds to regain his vision. And ther he was. Only a silhouette of a man, but John could tell right away that it was indeed Sherlock.
He felt his phone vibrate in the pocket of his jeans and tried to take it out. His hands, however, were shaking, so the phone had slipped out and fell onto the concrete road.
"I want you to tell Lestrade, Mrs Hudson," Sherlock was taking short breaks in between mentioning each name as if he did not want to forget about anyone significant. "And Molly, do not forget about Molly. In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that I created Moriarty, I created the belief that I am some sort of a genius."
"Well I knew you'd find the case. I'm not stupid," Lestrade explains.
"In Afghanistan. There was an actual wound."
Sherlock, pacing faster and faster, clutches his head. "Come on, come on!"
"You can't withhold evidence, and I didn't break into your flat."
"Oh don't you worry, all sorts round here. Mrs. Turner next door's got married ones," she lowers her voice.
"George?"
"Yes, of course. Very soon. Good night, Dr. Watson. Detective White."
"That's my chair," Sherlock commands.
"Her daughter. Why would she write her daughter's name, why?" Sherlock questions as he paces around the room.
"I'm not a psychopath, Anderson. I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research!" Turning back to Lestrade, "You need to bring Rachel in, you need to question her. I need to question her!"
"Okay…" Concerned that he suddenly changed from a flurry of energy to eerily calm and with no smart remark back at her suggestion, she prods, "Where are you going?"
"The lanyard holding your flat key from earlier had a 'PENN' pin on it. University of Pennsylvania. Master's in Criminology?" Grace nods in confirmation. "Continuing, this means you likely have a brother. Of course, it's a brother and not a sister because why adopt another daughter when they already have one? And the way you appear more comfortable conversing with men on your team and not women, you likely grew up surrounded by other men, perhaps idolizing your father due to an untimely death or abandonment from your mother. Now, your brother is likely not Korean, nor Asian at all, because again, why adopt more of the same when you have your choice of all the children in the world? Given that they adopted an Asian child first, they probably did not care to adopt within their own race. The next most popular place for rich, white Americans to adopt? Africa, of course, popularized by Angelina Jolie after her marriage to Brad Pitt. But given that your mother abandoned you early in your life leading to an adult issue developing relationships with females, she must have left you when you were very young, under 10 years old. Meaning your African brother was the last child to be adopted, since your father wouldn't adopt another child without your mother."
“The suitcase!” she continues, “Look at the body - dressed head-to-toe in that horrible pink color. Her dress, her shoes, her coat, even her lipstick...it’s all pink! Wouldn’t it only make sense that her suitcase be pink as well?”
"You saved my life, John. Sherlock's, too. Let's not overcomplicate things," she says pulling back. "As far as I'm concerned, you were checking the floor of classrooms under me, and that's all I know."
"You know what, Anderson, don't talk out loud, you lower the IQ of the whole street. We can do more than read her emails. It's a smartphone, it's got GPS, and if you lose it, you can locate it online. She's leading us right to the man who killed her."
"John, you said you called the phone before, right? Do you think you could try it again? Maybe we'll hear the ringtone go off," Grace suggests.
"She was right next to the guy. She got hit with his blood."
"Yes, I suppose, dear, but are you sure you want to be leaving Detective Lestrade's so quickly? I mean I'm glad to finally be able to rent out this extra flat, but I'm sure his place much be much more quiet and maybe a bit more... cozy, yes?" Mrs. Hudson smiles giving Grace a pointed look as she pulls back the drapes to the main window across the room.
"Is your flat? All of it?"
"Please God let me live."
"Yes, well, it was all really quite obvious. If that has sated your curiosity, I do believe we have more important things to focus on," Sherlock changes the subject with a devilish smile.
"But which building is it? The tracker just stopped here".
Looking up from her phone and out the window, she points to the upcoming buildings.
"Then what is it?"
"Guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here, belonged to the victim," Lestrade calls out to his team.
“Sherlock, two minutes I said. Need anything you’ve got,” Lestrade jumps in.
"What's Moriarty?"
"I went ahead and moved in," explains Sherlock.
"For God's sake…"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John looks down at his leg. "Well, yes, I suppose I should sit down for a bit," John says dejectedly as he moves to sit down in the black chair on the right.
"Thank you!" Lestrade nods to Mrs. Hudson and John before leaving.
"No, he wasn't there. It was just Grace."
The two men turn to look at the woman in the doorway holding her badge in front of her.
“Right, yes, thanks - and?”
"Sherlock, don't," Grace warns walking toward him, her hand reaching out.
"Oh, he's always been so resentful. You can imagine the Christmas dinners."
"Let's split up. You take the right building, I'll take the left," John directs, sensing danger in the situation and going into military mode. The two take off into opposite buildings, running at top speed.
"And that's where we leave," John interrupts, pulling Grace's arm towards him. "It's been good seeing you again, Mycroft. I'm sure we'll be seeing you later."
"How did you know what school I went to?"
"I don't know…" Sherlock replies, suddenly calm.
"Why would I do that?"
“No, she was leaving an angry note in German - of course she was writing Rachel. No other word it can be. Question is, why did she wait till she was dying to write it…”
"He's not... I dunno. Some kind of...criminal mastermind?"
Sherlock and John burst into 221B. Lestrade is sitting in Sherlock's chair, examining the pink suitcase on the table.
"No. No, he wasn't really, was he?"
"Yeah, it must have been. Through that window…"
“Do you know you do that out loud?” Sherlock questions, trying not to look pleased.
"Good," Sherlock interrupts. "Shall we John?"
"Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much."
"Well it seems like he enjoyed the company."
Sherlock reaches for the bottle, looking at it in his hand, tempted.
"Want to see some more?"
"Yes, but if you were clever, if you were very clever... Jennifer Wilson, running all those lovers. She was clever, and she's telling us something!"
John stares at her, appalled at the idea. "Why would he do that?"
“Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you’d go deeper”.
Sighing, Sherlock turns to John who gives him a look, conveying with his eyes not to be rude.
"Because you're an idiot," she says pushing back his shoulder. "A stupidly brilliant idiot."
"His name is Greg."
"And I did just catch a serial killer for you. More or less."
“Sherlock?”
Rushing into the building on the right, she pushes the elevator button rapidly with no luck.
“Pink!” Sherlock and Grace exclaim at the same time. Sherlock slams the door on his way out and Grace turns to look excitedly at Lestrade.
"Me too," she nods. "Well, I'll see you around then?"
Not seeing sight of Sherlock anywhere, she stops at the second to top floor and looks outside the window toward the other building. She makes eye contact with John who is also trying to catch his breath, as he waves her down and makes a questioning gesture. Grace shakes her head vigorously, miming to him that she hasn't found any sign of Sherlock yet either.
"Here," she stops to write down a phone number and the name 'Grace White' on a piece of paper. Smiling, she hands the paper to him, "My contact information."
"I was in a bit of a rush…"
"Oh, wonderful!" Mrs. Hudson beams. "This will be good for you Sherlock, having someone around to keep you company. You know, he's always off getting in trouble, never eating or stopping to take a break. You ought to help him with that, John, you seem more the sitting down type, I can tell."
"Moriarty."
“What am I doing here?” John whispers, stealing a glance back at Lestrade.
"Well, um, not exactly…" Grace trails off. "I am renting the place under them though."
"Yes. No. God, no! Anyway, I'd better, um…" he trails off glancing back at Sherlock then to Grace. "Oh, uh, yes. Mycroft, this is Detective Grace White of Scotland Yard. She was assisting in the investigation tonight."
"Wait a second, Sherlock." Lestrade walks after him, stepping in his path. "What happened exactly in there? We find you standing over a dead body, perfect undisturbed, with Grace covered in what I can only assume is the dead man's blood, since she doesn't seem to be harmed. Physically, anyway."
“Why do you keep saying suitcase?” Lestrade chimes in.
"Before you go on calling anyone...did you figure it out? Which one's the good bottle," the cabbie asks.
"Yeah, but come on…" He looks at Sherlock, who has a warning look on his face. Shaking his head, John, astonished, yells, "No! You?"
"You can't just break into my flat!"
"Okay...well, yes, I was born in South Korea, but my parents adopted me and brought me back to America when I was three. What else?"
"Anderson won't work with me."
“Down, Sherlock. This is our newest detective at Scotland Yard, Grace White. Grace, this is Sherlock Holmes and his associate John Watson. Sherlock is a...third-party detective we consult for cases that require a certain...special hand,” Lestrade explains choosing his words carefully. “This is Dr. Watson’s first case.”
"Oddly enough, no."
"Ah, yes, Detective Lestrade is so reliable isn't he," she hints.
The two of them head out, Grace shouting a quick, "We're heading out after Sherlock!" over her shoulder to Lestrade as he fields more concerns over Sherlock's state of mind from Sally.
"Would you like to show her, or shall I?" Sherlock turns his attention to the cabbie, waving his hand over to Grace.
Sherlock turns to see John staring at the screen of the laptop. "Where is it? Where? Quickly!" He joins John at the screen and stares, frowning. "What?"
Sliding into the backseat of the taxi, John and Grace take off after Sherlock, following the map of the device on their phones.
Sherlock logs into mephone's website. "The user name will be the email address," He begins typing rapidly, "And the password is…"
"See you both there I presume," she smiles at John. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hudson - perhaps we can meet again under better circumstances."
“Yes, well. Under her coat collar is damp as well. She turned it up against the wind. She’s got an umbrella in her left pocket but it’s unused and dry. Not just wind, strong wind - too strong to use her umbrella.” Sherlocks begin to pace the room. “We know from her suitcase that she’s staying over night so she must have a come a decent distance. But she can’t have travelled more than two or three hours, cos her coat hasn’t dried.” He nods to the woman who has since moved from the doorway to stand beside Lestrade. “So where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time? Cardiff,” he finishes, holding up his PDA to John and Lestrade.
"I never guess. And you-" Sherlock turns to look at Grace who has joined them next to John. "For a detective, you had a surprising reaction to a simple gunshot."
"Sherlock…" John warns.
John, looking around, replies, "Course I'm alright."
“Sherlock, there was no case,” Lestrade repeats as he, John and Grace follow him down the stairs.
"Let me go,
"Well what do you call this?"
"What, now? I'm in shock. Look, I've got a blanket. Go and find Detective White and bother her," Sherlock pauses, realizing Grace may be aware of the shooter's identity as well. "Actually, leave her alone, Lestrade. Your pestering is not good for the shock. She may just keel over if you do that."
"And I didn't notice. Me? I didn't notice? No."
“But they take the poison themselves. They chew and swallow the pills themselves, there are clear signs - even you lot couldn’t miss them,” Sherlock spells out, waving his hand in the air in the direction of Lestrade and Grace.
"Why?" John asks.
“Suitcase, yes. She’s been married for at least ten years, but not happily. She’s had a string of lovers, but none of them have known she was married…”
"Sherlock...this is not the right time to show off," John warns again, fruitlessly.
"Well, you'd know," Sherlock gives John a knowing look. John gives a little smile of acknowledgment. "We'll need to get the powder burns out your finger. I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case. Are you all right?"
