Not waiting. He almost said aloud as he did the laundry, shirtless.
Dean clutched Castiel closer to him, feeling the warmth wrap around the core of his being.
He sat there, feeling the cold on his skin, taking it as a lesson that he deserved to be alone.
In the door frame stood a very grumpy looking Dean, his headphones still around his neck.
“My little bitch, I have claimed you.
Sam rolled his eyes, grabbed the bottle and tried to pull Dean to his feet.
He had abused his friend’s body as well as his trust.
it was making him lick in between the joining of his wings, where he was most vulnerable.
That he would grow tired of putting up with Dean’s shit like he always had.
Castiel made the sweetest little noises as he writhed and shivered under Dean’s touch.
“I want to fill you, make you mine.
Sam asked gently.
Castiel praised, as he made sure to kiss every freckle on the hunters body.
This was everything he wanted.
Castiel arched his back against Dean’s chest, he knew he was weak and particularly vulnerable in this vessel, but he never expected to be stimulated like this. For a moment he wondered if Dean even knew what he was doing.
And now he had to face the consequences.
Castiel drew near the table, making sure not to get too close. He was already having trouble keeping his wings on their separate plain of existence.
Dean gave out a small wine of protest, but he eventually got him into a chair with a glass of water.
“This mean I’m yours now?”
He got up ashamedly, taking his clothes with him and leaving quickly as to not intrude on Dean’s privacy any longer.
“I...I’m sorry.” Dean said hurriedly, sitting up and retreating from Cass’ personal space.
Dean’s mind was foggy with drunkenness and lust, leaving him writhing and helpless on the bed as he was pinned down by an invisible force. Castiel stood at the foot of the bed, his wings raised high above him, the tips grazing the ceiling. He gazed lovingly over Dean’s body as he leaned over and began stripping him.
Sam watched the pitiful mess of his older brother try and fail to open the bottle before he spoke again.
His breath hitched as Dean ran his fingers over his oil gland, studying the slick substance before licking some off his fingers.
“He’s better off without me around, and I’m better off dead.”
Sam closed the door with a loud clang just as Jack got up to get more cereal.
Hours later, he was washing a car in the garage, tapping his feet to Led Zeppelin in his faded Jeans-shorts.
Dean said, stroking the wing at the base of where it was protruding from Castiel’s torn coat.
Part of him somewhere knew,
He asked, having hopes that this would lead somewhere, but only if Castiel wished for that.
Though he didn’t make it far before Dean’s voice stopped him.
There was a case in Illinois.
And sometimes Castiel wouldn’t touch him all day, until in the dead of night when he would crawl into Dean’s bed and do things to him in the dark.
Castiel made his way down the halls of the old bunker.
The tendrils pulsed as Dean dug his fingers into Castiel’s downy feathers near the base of his wings.
But then memories of the night before came flooding back.
He tried to suppress a shudder, curling his toes as the angel’s finger slid between his cheeks.
Castiel watched the hunter reach towards him, and then withdraw.
“Cass, please. You can’t keep doing this to me.”
Castiel merely smiled back mischievously.
He leaned over and whispered into the hunter’s ear.
A smile spread across his face as he watched the soap suds run down the hunter’s arms, noticing how his back was visible through his damp shirt.
Dean writhed against his touch, trying to fuck himself onto Castiel’s large erection like the needy bottom he was.
Cas broke in a nervous laugh.
“Why do you think so?”
It happened frequently, in the beginning —once every two days on average, to be exact. They’d meet, ‘blow off some steam’, as Dean put it, and Castiel would leave. He was more than okay with it. After all, he knew, he could
“As long as you’re okay with it, I’d like to feel you,” one of his thumbs moved to Cas’ navel, traveling south to the tent on his jeans.
Whenever he wasn’t covered by other people behind him, Dean clearly saw Cas singing to all the lyrics, even jumping from time to time when he was feeling the beat too much.
“I want to experiment with food, Dean.”
“You’re arguing over pineapple,” he said, with quiet and serene understanding.
It hid in his trench coat for a moment, taking a cassette in his fingers from a pocket and placing it on the table, next to Dean’s laptop.
Right?
Dean kneeled in front of Cas.
Cas: I wish I could touch you.
Cas sat at one of the library tables, with several books scattered in front of him. Dean had just finished watching a soccer game in his cave, and Sam was doing laundry. That, or categorizing the socks in his wardrobe, maybe.
Cas stayed silent for a bit.
“Sure.” Dean followed along, but Cas grabbed his wrist. He looked around, made sure they were alone, and whispered, “Everything alright?”
“How long do you think it’ll take us to come? You touch me and I’m done, babe.”
Cas: thank you, Dean
His slippery fingers teased Cas and fuck, if being pushed against someone while you gave them head was sexy, having them pull you back was twice as good. The hand in Dean’s hair pulled hard enough for Dean to put greater effort to go down on him, but not enough to actually stop him.
He became self-aware of the grip on his wrists and let it go.
“Good. She’s good. For you.”
“About what you said-”
“If I may…” Dean whispered behind Cas’ ear, single-handedly unbuttoning the jeans.
“Would you let me fuck your mouth like I do with my tongue?” Dean did a demonstration, invading Cas’ mouth.
The back of Dean’s index and middle finger rubbed his sleepy eyes.
But Cas, apparently, didn't have anything to say.
She nodded. “Oh, okay.” She washed the dishes in the sink silently and Dean put away some things in the fridge. “Like…” she said, after Dean had distracted in his own mind, “that you like each other?”
“About that,” Sam said. He sat on the bed next to Dean’s duffel. “I think we should follow Cas’s plan.”
Dean read Cas from his spot. He was clearly flirting, smiling too much and even placing a hand on Dylan’s shoulder, sliding it down his arm.
“I’d like to jack you off now, Cas,” Dean breathed into his ear. “You okay with that?”
“Shit, Cas,” he kissed him again, glad to finally understand, glad because he wasn't an abusive shitty boyfriend. Thinking further into it, a new panic arose in his chest. “But, hey, hey, wait a second. I didn’t remember that. I was going to do it even when I thought you didn’t want me to.”
“Let’s get the fuck outta here.”
Cas grabbed Dean’s shoulders and Dean’s hand rested low on Cas’ back; they embraced and settled on the decision they’d made.
He was ignored.
With that in mind, he sat next to Cas on the edge of the bed.
“I love you.”
“I’m happy to see you made yourself at home,” Dean said. “Okay, this has always been your home, for the record.”
“Yeah, and we just… jerk off, listening to our breaths… I mean, it should be sexy, right?”
Dean this time couldn’t help the scoff with sharp sarcasm he cracked.
Slowly becoming aware of the sunlight passing through the thin curtains of Cas’ bedroom, Dean noticed the smell of something delicious hitting his nose —and no, he didn’t mean Cas.
“You were so unsatisfied you had to go to a bar for some stranger to fuck you?” The swearing felt foreign in his tongue, but his anger could only meet his words if they were that profane. “And you couldn’t even pick one that didn’t fuck you wrong?” His voice was getting louder, high-pitched. “Dammit, Dean-”
Dylan nodded, pointing to behind the stage, and Cas also nodded and pointed with his thumb behind his back, where the bar was.
“Hey, Earth to Dean,” Cas mumbled, catching his breath.
Over the table, Castiel’s passed Dean the pepper. Their fingers brushed for the shortest of seconds. Dean added the condiments to his steak, then put the small container back on the table.
“Dean.” It was solemn. As always, an honor. “I’m fine. I’ll wait for you here.”
“We, uhm,” Cas said, “we should go to the kitchen?”
the best and greatest announcement of their lives was made by the Archangel Gabriel himself.
Dean reached for the popcorn, feeling the salt of it between his fingers. He ate it, then brushed his hand on his pants to grab the remote and hit play.
Cas’ eyes were blank. Dean grabbed the plate and emptied it on the trash.
Cas just smiled, maybe knowing Dean wasn’t that annoyed for the soundtrack of their ride.
He grabbed a bowl of milk and granola then left the couple alone.
“Right,” Sam said. “I’ll do some research on the place, see if I can find the blueprints somewhere to find the exits and potential back-up plans. We’ll do just fine.”
It was the happiest day of their lives.
Dean’s eyes went to Cas’ hand on his crotch.
“You don’t have to apologize, Dean.”
“Dean,” Cas said, lovingly and not mad at all, despite what had just happened. “I want this. That.” He looked at the real them, focusing on Dean’s sucking mouth. “I want your fingers in me. I jack off to the thought of you filling me up. With your fingers, with your cock, with everything you can give me.”
After a very enjoyable moment of that, Dean’s index finger was finally surrounded by lube and Cas’ heat. Then the middle finger joined it, and lastly, so did the ring one. Cas’ body fit Dean’s hand like a damn glove.
“What playlist is that, anyway?” Dean asked, panting, getting on top of Cas and pulling playfully the collar of his tee.
In the bar, the lights were dim and the air was charged with electricity.
“I just told you I
Dean was dazzled the moment Sam pulled them out of the breach.
“The guy could turn you into a fucking guinea pig and you think it’s challenging to try to seduce him?”
“Did I meet your expectations?”
“Yeah, man?”
Dean relaxed again. “I get it. I mean I’ve surely fantasized about your dick in my ass, but… it’s kinda scary.”
First, no one left him that high and dry since ages ago. Second: not that it mattered, though, as all the drama helped him get rid of his hard-on and all that he cared about by then was to stop Cas from making a scene in front of Sam.
“Sometimes,” Cas said, voice unwavering.
Cas’ mouth didn’t hang open or anything that exaggerated, but Dean could see the praise in Cas’ eyes. Cas watched him exactly like Dean would stare at a burger after three days with no food. Cas was, very obviously, admiring his dick.
“Can I ask why you were so furious, Cas? Because Sam suggested something and I-I really don’t believe him.”
“Can I have another?”
All the sensual touches and undressing didn’t compare to how kissing Cas felt. It turned wild and desperate, and Cas kissed him like that was his only mission in the world; like if that was the one thing doing it for him.
“I love you.” It was confident, not hesitant in the slightest.
, and then
It was in the middle of a laundry session that it hit Dean: he was a total creep.
Dean started pushing down a little bit, slowly, pulling back almost immediately and then repeating the motion but taking more in every time.
Then Castiel did the same, allowing the piece of jewelry to represent the journey they’d gone through together to be there. Hands clasped tightly, they refused to let go.
Cas struggled a little to free his hands, but he didn’t succeed.
Cas scoffed.
Sam glanced over at Cas quickly, nodding. “Yes, now all you have to do is scream ‘Eat me’ in the crowd.” Cas’s expression was dumbfounded for a moment. Sam added, “Metaphorically speaking. Do not scream that.”
“Why do you want to know that?”
Eventually, though, a miracle happened.
Cas just walked in, no knocking, no nothing. He just stepped in and pretty much stood in front of the TV. He had this annoyed but remorseful face: jaw tensed, eyes soft.
“We certainly don’t get enough of this,” Cas whispered. Dean shook his head. Cas added, “C’mon, I want us to go somewhere.”
“I’ll play it for you in the war room speakers,” Cas said, turning off the faucet and breaking the moment.
But he knew there was one more thing he could do to feel even lighter.
If only he could hug Cas, bury his nose in his neck, kiss him—
So, as soon as Sam closed the door behind him, Dean had Cas’ wrists pinned over his head with both hands, next to one of the dusty bookshelves of the room.
The lightheartedness in Dean the moment he saw Cas was particularly special. It was so adorable and weird, at the same time, to look at him with his clothes, sitting on the edge of his bed simply awaiting.
. There was trust, there was stress relief, there was caring… everything he could ask for in a healthy friends-with-benefits relationship.
Dean studied the way his hand moved on Cas' skin and how Cas' body reacted to it. He was glad to see Cas didn’t take long before starting dripping, so he slowed down, a little too excited about stretching the moment.
“Dean.” She sighed heavily. “I’m your mother. You can’t keep things from me.”
Right, well, the moment he saw Cas die pretty much did it.
“I’m glad.”
, Dean said, as his fingertips detailed the texture of the only piece of clothing he’d ever felt so devoted to.
Sam nodded, looking at his tablet. “Please, Cas.”
“Cas, hey,” Dean said. He hugged him and stepped back to look him in the eyes. “Was this you?”
Dean’s heart swelled.
Dean wasn’t one to handle well silence. He just needed to fill the air with some comment to know Cas was still there, with him.
the snack, baby.”
“Pineapple is a fruit and pizza is supposed to be a savory meal,” he explained, titling his head to the side.
Like a movie, a memory played in Dean’s mind:
Dean sucked harder, swirling tongue and distracting Cas enough for him to keep unclenching his ass. Dean moved his finger further in, remembering that
He did, in fact, until he felt betrayed.
“It’s unexpected, but yes. I trust you.”
you,” Cas answered, witty and teasing as always.
Once in his bedroom, he grabbed pen and paper to write the list of songs. He was still on the second word when he was startled by someone opening the door.
“Why collecting pets?” Dean asked.
He pointed it to Dean, but didn’t move.
“What?”
Castiel was well aware that the apology he offered in that moment wasn’t enough; he said it anyway, and afterward explained what was going on. He put away the tablet, announcing he had to keep it safe, and left.
Sam was on his way to the kitchen for his first cup of coffee when he realized Dean had never gone to bed. For the second night in a row.
Dean’s fist was stopped midway by Castiel’s hand, breaking his arm and causing bones to crack loudly.
Dean nodded and hid in Cas’ neck, kissing him over the t-shirt on the way down to his shorts.
Cas was still a little taken aback, despite his mantra, but certainly, he didn’t dislike it. It was just new.
“Do you do that a lot?” He asked, out of his kinky mind that liked to imagine Cas didn’t have sexual pleasure as often as he did himself.
“We could sext tonight,” Cas offered casually. Then added, “It’s better than nothing.”
What if he wasn’t acting, though? Just like with actually enjoying the music… what if-
Cas supported on his legs, leaving his thighs up, forearm on the bed and their cocks together in the other hand.
“It matters, Dean,” Cas said, hand cupping Dean’s face, “because I don’t want anything to do with that guy.” He passed the thumb over his cheekbone. “Or with anyone that isn’t you.”
“I’ll be right back.”
“Can I?”
Dean was just blissed out just from smelling so much like Cas since he used his soap, and knowing that they could spend the night cuddled together was more than enough for him.
Cas’ heartbeat sped up in emotion. He was so in love with Dean. “I know you didn’t mean to. It’s alright.”
In the cave, he watched cartoons while eating popcorn. He wasn’t actively waiting for Cas, he was just passing time and keeping his mind busy to avoid thinking about the mess everything was at the moment.
“He made a deal. The Empty didn’t just take him. Cas actually summoned it to save me.”
“Okay,” he said, not wasting any time to start touching himself.
“I don’t see the problem.”
“No,” he finally said, sternly.
“Chuck. We beat
out of Dean, "Yeah, having intercouse
Cas kissed him back eagerly, pushing closer and holding onto him like he was oxygen to his lungs too.
Dean wasn’t completely sure of what
“I never slept at the center of the bed. Always left your side ready for whenever this happened.”
“Just wanted to make it crystal clear.”
For Cas, the image of his mouth being filled with Dean’s cock instead of his tongue got him on the edge.
Cas’ breath caught in his chest audibly.
Dean loved that tone on him.
Cas, tired and everything, stretched until he opened the drawer. He blindly found and took the box of Kleenex out, giving Dean a tissue in his clean hand and taking one of his own.
He slowly got Cas’ dick out of his mouth and remained holding the base with his other hand.
“Mom, I’m not keeping anything. Cas and I are just friends.”
“What if you…” Cas trailed off, pushing Dean’s hip down, hinting to him to move.
“But you have to answer with the truth.”
“Yeah. You?”
“Yeah, got no time to rethink my words that much.” Silence. “Are you undressing, at least?”
Dean traced circles on his legs with his fingertips. “It’s okay.”
“Couldn’t wait to make it to this part,” Dean teased, way too comfortable being so helpless.
“We won,” Sam said. “That’s what matters.”
“Did I read this wrong? Because if I did, then-” he lifted his hand off Cas, almost in a defensive gesture.
He entered a corner store, looking for some supplies they were running low on: new razors, soap —motel ones always smelled like a morgue—, and salt. You could never get enough salt.
“Say no more.”
Cas snorted. “Actually, it’s the soundtrack of 50 Shades.”
The nice, brunette barista served him two shots of something. Dean learned then it was tequila, as he saw that they were served with slices of lemon and a little salt shaker.
“Your dad’s office?”
Maybe this was Gabriel’s doing. He’d always had a thing for Sam.
Cas came first, but how hard he stringed them both in white and the tensing of his muscles around Dean's fingers was all it took to send Dean by the same ecstatic road.
“Cas,” he almost whispered, already in front of him. “Are you alright?” He put a tentative hand on his shoulder, covered in blue molecules. “That guy was all over you and-”
Dean kept his mouth parted, way too turned on by Cas’ stimulation on it. Cas slipped his thumb in and Dean instinctively wrapped his lips around it.
“No, you just love greasy and unhealthy food.”
Cas’ father wasn’t one of getting into his business, thank God.
It was intense yet short, like they were moving to a new level of trust right there and then.
In denial, Dean cupped his face, resting his thumbs on the raspy stubble, trying to wake him up.
“Give me that,” Cas asked for the tablet and eyed the site quickly, “I’d never before been this happy for a case.They’ll play a Tribute to Jimi Hendrix there.”
Dean jolted awake in his motel room.
They didn’t mention it, even when they were alone. Not until four days later, when Castiel was the one needing comfort.
“What if Sam returns soon?” Cas asked, out of breath, while Dean kissed his neck.
College AU.
Cas hugged him tightly. Dean closed his eyes against Cas’ jawline, taking in his clean and masculine and celestial perfect scent.
And damn, did it feel good.
They fell asleep wrapped around the other on the armchair, and Cas did one last trick for the night: they dreamed the same dream, one where they'd live happily ever after.
He returned to suck Cas off, brushing clean on his jeans the hand he wouldn't need to finger Cas —he wanted to keep holding his hip without unnecessary slickness.
“After my research yesterday, I understood that the Feast Day of Saint Valentine celebrates love and affection.”
“Dammit, Sam!”
Cas had a point: Dean had a soft spot for anything that could block his arteries. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t love Cas, too.
When he went back into his room, wearing his sleeping pants and worn out tee, there was Sam in front of the Xbox, sitting on the floor, while Cas played from the edge of Dean’s twin-sized bed.
“How about that you let me finger you, while I suck you off?”
Cas supported his hands on the wall and turned to face Dean.
And before Dean had the chance to ask what was that supposed to mean, Sam left.
He acted it cool.
Dean walked to the library, with a cup in each hand, then handed one to his friend.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean snatched his ringing phone from the Impala bench seat. He tapped mindlessly on the answer icon and put the receiver against his ear.
Sam handed Dean another dish. He smiled, mostly to himself, but Dean didn’t miss it. “She’s great.”
“Okay,” he said, stopping the teasing, returning his hands to the hip bones. “Just head, then.”
A moan came from his right. It was Cas, getting blown by him. The real him, since Dean supposed he was in his mind at the moment.
“I don’t see why not,” Sam said. “I’ll grab some books from the library that could be useful.”
How had he been so damn blind? So damn stubborn?
Dean left. He wouldn’t be able to get over that for a while.
“Dean, dammit, stop,” Cas protested, pulling Dean's hair again, ending with a long pet behind his head.
“Gabe, yes. Are you not friends with them anymore?”
Cas tilted his head, fighting a smile. “You’re right, I guess.”
He leaned in and kissed Dean.
Cas could've ignored the rage in his gut and had angry sex with Dean, been rough, showed him how good things could feel without actually hurting, but he couldn’t. He was physically unable to do so as Dean’s words made him lose his boner.
“This is messed up,” Dean said, matter-of-factly. “We should’ve discussed that properly, Cas, thought of a safeword. Are you sure you wanted this?”
“Okay, Cas, listen closely, to me,” Dean said. He put a hand on Cas’ shoulder and the other on the table, meeting their eyes thoughtfully. It was important that the message got through. “Babe, I’m glad you can enjoy food and everything, but you can’t put mayonnaise in pancakes. You must not.”
Dean closed his eyes for a bit, imagining that, soon enough, he wouldn’t be holding Cas’ face, but his hips, and he wouldn’t be fucking his mouth, but his ass.
“You’re kidding, right?” Dean snapped, looking at the atrocity on the kitchen table.
Dean used his shirt to clean Cas’ stomach and himself. Cas put his briefs back in place but finally stepped out of his slacks and shoes, leaving the socks.
Cas hugged Dean, strongly pushing their chests together.
There were so many of him surrounding Castiel, and every single one was lying lifelessly on the floor. The dead bodies were screaming violence, the blood was spilling agony, and the wounds were aching with guilt.
Dean’s hands clenched in fists. The ring in his right hand was almost hurting his palm from the force of his grip, but then—Cas’ hand landed on his shoulder, and he was zipped out of the motel room where Zachariah was about to attack him, most likely.
Not out loud, at least.
Dean slammed the driver’s door closed. He met eyes with Cas over the Impala roof.
Oh, guys in tank tops around every corner: one of the perks of summer being close that Dean appreciated the most.
He got it, okay, he needed to save Cas as much as he needed to breathe, but if he didn’t rest he’d go nuts before finding anything helpful.
Dean hung his towel behind his door and grabbed a control.
He took Dean in again, and Dean gradually set the pace up to how it was right before they stopped.
Cas turned around to enter the diner. Dean shrugged, also turning to cross the street.
Cas snorted, but moved away and stood up. Dean was about to protest, but Cas didn’t let him. He grabbed the empty plates from the floor and said, “Let me take these to the dishwasher and brush my teeth, okay?”
“Yeah,” Sam intervened, after taking a deep breath to fight a burst of laughter. “We did.”
Dean grabbed his towel and a clean PJ. Not any PJ, but his favorite one. He couldn’t believe how excited he was about using his softest, comfiest PJ just because he got to share a bed with Cas.
Dean rolled his eyes, hurt from his own line being used against him.
, actually. I’m just overwhelmed, but I’ll be okay.”
It only confirmed to Dean that it wasn’t a moment at all.
Cas, as odd as it was, actually snorted at Dean’s attempt of a joke.
“Shoot.”
Dean’s phone rang. It was Sam.
"We need to take your grace," Dean said. He was serious. "So you won't belong here."
Even underneath the slacks, he felt Cas burning hot.
Who knew Cas could do well in a social situation like that? He was naturally kind, but where did he even learn how to flirt?!
Cas did something similar, scooping closer to Dean, tracing with his palm Dean’s column, then going up the front, passing over his navel and the middle of his forming abs.
“It’s a safe play, isn’t it? Or how are we getting a wooden stake in a bar?”
Just before the chorus came up —yes, because Dean knew this song already from Cas listening so many times to it in the bunker—, Cas turned up the volume.
Cas’s lips were soft, and felt simply
They were in the YouTube part of the routine at Cas’ place —it was a Game of Thrones episode reaction—  when Cas’ dad politely interrupted them, knocking on the frame of the living room area.
Maybe it was the music doing the pacing, so romantic and slow, but going from the tenderness to desperate kisses was probably a thing of 15 whole minutes.
Cas only nodded, not trusting his voice yet.
Craving Dean so much, he was naturally happy and anxious about Dean’s latest invitation to his place: one to spend the night.
“I hate to say this, but I think you have to go to the couch now.”
“I don’t know about you, but I think we’re good with underwear and no shorts, right?”
They both hung out in the same circle of friends —Gabe, Charlie, Kevin, even Sam and his best friend-slash-crush Jessica sometimes— but none of them suspected anything.
Dean cupped Cas’ cheek and kissed him chastely. “Okay, sunshine, don’t worry.” He took a deep breath, wishing that it was easier to make his boner disappear.
“I’m kinda jealous, though,” Cas said, cupping Dean’s cheek, “I really wanted to have a part on that.”
Dean put his bottle on the table behind them. He passed his hands over his face.
Cas snorted. “C’mon, Dean, I had it under control.” He stood fully on his feet, ducking his head to a side. It’s like he was screaming
He complied; leaning forward again and landing his lips on Cas as if he were the most delicate thing in the world.
Dean leaned to plant a kiss on his forehead. “I’m so gonna marry you someday.”
“Dean.” Sam stood in front of him and put a hand on his shoulder. “Hey, listen to me. We’re gonna get him back.”
Cas shook his head nervously. “Getting undressed in here would make me very stressed.”
His hands lingered on Cas’ face for a brief moment. He dropped them, then stood back to tell Sam there was no way back.
“Coming, Dean.” But Dean didn’t move.  “
“You exceeded them.”
“Wow, you’re— beautiful.”
“I think it can work. Rowena gav-”
Because it wasn’t. Strangers? Strangers Dean didn’t care about. Cas, on the other hand, he cared for him almost as much as he cared for Sam.
And the jeans, well. Not that Dean could look too closely without Sam or Cas himself noticing, but they were tighter than usual, like he’d put them in a dryer a few times in a row. They clinged to his pretty ass, full thighs, and all the way down his legs.
Dean’s aching dick didn’t miss a bit of it and claimed attention. He grabbed himself through the denim, releasing some friction against his palm.
Cas groaned in his throat, so manly and so sexy that Dean didn’t know what to think but wondering why they’d taken so long to get there.
“Shit, Cas, I’m so sorry-”
Cas: is it really wrong to put mayonnaise in pancakes? Or is it like pineapple on pizza?
“Shut up, bitch.”
But damn, did he have to look so sexy? Was he even
Mary gave Cas a funny look, like
Sam nodded, sipping from his beer. “You know, part of the plan is pretending we don’t know him and being subtle about that part, too.”
Dean sucked small love marks that wouldn’t actually leave bruises. He bit and licked the conjuncture of Cas’ shoulders, his pectorals, teased his nipples only slightly, moved to his abs, all the way until the waistband of his briefs.
If only Dean had lube –well, there was spit. It was always better than nothing.
They cuddled, Dean being the big spoon, and Cas stopped the playlist on his phone. “Enough of sexy music for tonight.”
“Well, you know what they say: it takes one to know one.”
“A deal?”
Dean entered the room again.
Cas propped up himself on his elbow without quitting the kiss, leaning more firmly over Dean. His hand went to hold the semi-muscular bicep, a little too lost on how it felt, flexing underneath his touch as Dean pulled Cas closer to him.
“There you are.” He took a seat in front of Dean. Eyeing the whiskey, he asked, “Can I?” and grabbed the bottle.
“Dean,” Sam repeated, sounding tired and exasperated. “Okay, you have a point, but we’re always doing the exact same thing: putting ourselves at risk for the greater good.”
Dean trusted this man with his life. He trusted him with his soul and with everything in between. He knew he could let the tension creeping inside him go away, and he allowed himself to be vulnerable for once.
Sam grabbed a grocery list from a notepad and then Dean connected the dots in his head. “Right, yeah. Sure.”
Cas took the bowl again and put it on his thighs. He said something about practicality and equal distances from the snack for Sam and Dean.
After so many years of pining, he wanted to celebrate even Arbor Day or Talk Like a Pirate Day with him.
for the hotel :D.
“Yeah. And the worst part is that I didn’t say anything, Sam. Not a single word. Not a single fucking gesture. I just froze and looked at him and the next thing I knew he was covered in blackness and-”
And Dean was one that loved reciprocation. “You too, baby, you can —fuck —you can fuck me all the ways you can imagine.”
“Indeed.”
Cas kept humming the beats of the song, imitating what Dean guessed were the instruments, until he sang quietly “
His eyes found Dean’s again, but this time their blue was darker. He held up his hand and put Dean’s against his chest again.
Dean pleaded, both with his words and with his body. His free hand was held up in surrender, asking for mercy.
Dean snorted. “Gabe.”
From Sam’s palm, Ezekiel’s grace glowed and healed the several wounds on Cas’ abdomen.
However, he managed until Sam left for Eileen’s, because the fact that Sam knew Dean and Cas were together didn't mean that it was okay if he walked in on them having sex.
"Hold tight, Cas."
What if something happened to him on his way there? Or once he got there, the guy attacked before Sam and Dean arrived?
Cas arched an eyebrow.
Sam: it’s not only wrong, Cas. It’s sinful.
“It’s actually
After a few seconds of silence, Dean took the chance to bring up the janitor’s closet situation. “Listen, about earlier-”
Dean sat on his heels, feeling his thighs burn at the rest. He poured lube in his index and middle finger and warmed it up with his other hand.
He held Castiel to him with one arm as he parted the trench coat with the other, pulling it back and curling his fingers into the waistband of Cass’ slacks along with his boxers.
all the while stroking his primary feathers across Dean’s naked skin.
He briefly wondered how it was already slicked up, but all thoughts in his mind dissipated as he felt it slip into his crevice.
of coarse).
Castiel got dressed, at least half way before he felt an ache in his shoulders. It was a familiar ache, and he knew what it meant.
“This is in no way your fault.
Castiel appeared behind him silently, observing his favorite human. He loved when he got to see Dean like this; at peace.
“Cass, please...” Dean begged brokenly. He had been hard for ages and he needed Cass inside him like he needed air.
I want to join with you, fucking my grace into you as you pump me, milking me for my cum.”
“Dean, please.” He said softly.
“Cass-mhmm...please.”
Although angels do not usually crave the same intimacy humans do, they still crave a certain closeness, a closeness that Castiel had felt for the hunter for quite some time.
It was a mistake.
Dean grabbed his arm and pulled him close, breath warm on the back of his neck. “Castiel!” he practically growled against Cass’ ear.
Sam stood there awkwardly until he decided these two needed some time alone.
“Dean,” Castiel said firmly.
compelling him to find a molt companion. He couldn’t let Dean see him like this, surely if he knew of his desire to mate him he would lose all place in the hunter’s home.
The weakened angel began whimpering in the hunter’s arms.
Castiel moved slowly at first, working Dean open as he pushed deeper into his tight entrance.
“That’s- aaah!” He was cut off as Castiel found his prostate.
“Cass.” He called out, reaching towards him.
His eyes rolled back into his head as he felt Dean begin to suck on one of his oil glands.
Castiel muttered things into Dean’s skin. Praises, sinful things,
Dean melted in his arms, every kiss, every praise whispered against his skin working well to undo him.
Dean gathered up the oil and continued spreading it through the feathers.
Dean squirmed playfully, seeking friction until both his jeans and his boxers were suddenly gone.
Castiel’s tongue had just barely wetted his crevice when Dean heard the sound of wings.
his face buried in the exposed skin of Castiel’s chest.
Dean had somehow found another beer. “Turns out there was one more at the back of the fridge.”
“I-I’m sorry to disturb.”
I understand you would never want me in that way. Which is why I have chosen not to bother you with my problems.”
Even though he was mad at Dean right now he still needed to let him know before he left.
Was this really happening?
he was taking advantage of Cass.
“Cass, I don’t know what’s going on between you two but Dean needs you. He’s a mess. And if you could just talk to him-“
He watched it stretch and flutter as he pushed more grace into it.
Dean said quietly.
Castiel asked, genuine concern spreading across his face.
The angel moaned in pleasure as the pressure from his oil gland was finally released, letting the back of his coat and Dean’s fingers be coated with the clear, sweet smelling liquid.
But he felt he needed to check up on Dean before he left.
Dean felt a hand on his lower back and could do nothing but stand there as it slid lower.
He managed in reply, a slight tremble in his voice.
He started, trying not to notice how Dean’s shirt was slightly unbuttoned.
It was obvious he didn’t want Castiel around anymore.
“Castiel...” Dean sighed contently,
I have taken you and now you are bound to me. You let me in, took me into that sweet, tight ass.”
He all but begged against the tiles as he felt strong hands grasp his hips.
But now he had it, how long could he keep it. He tensed up, waiting for his angel to leave again.
The grace curled around his thighs, wrapping around his body and binding him for the taking.
They were like shapes carved out of obsidian. And everywhere the light hit them, they gave off a tinge of blue. They were covered with bald spots and burns and scars, but they were still the most beautiful things Dean had ever seen.
He stayed there, breathing heavily against the hood of the old car, feeling used.
Dean gave Castiel an annoyed glance.
He lay there, staring at Dean’s peaceful form resting in his arms,
Dean thought.
“Should we take this to a more private location?”
The streaming water stopped suddenly, and Dean was left helpless and moaning in Castiel’s arms. “Dean...” Castiel whispered into his damp flesh, holding Dean firmly to his naked chest.
but I hurt you and now you’re suffering because of me.”
they were already in Castiel’s bedroom, the angel practically purring under his touch.
Not waiting. He told himself, in his room, listening to music.
You have to believe me.”
Castiel looked up at the hunter, Dean’s green eyes seemed so full of warmth and pain and drunken sorrow.
“No, kid, you’re not. Also...”
Dean took another swig of whiskey before Sam swiped it out of his hand.
“I’m fine.” Jack said defensively.
He remembered what he had done to Cass, that he had taken him without consent.
Dean finally managed to get the whiskey open with a loud pop.
Until with a cry he fell unconscious into Dean’s arms.
Dean spent the rest of the day telling himself he wasn’t waiting.
He was Castiel’s bitch, and a slave to his affections for the angel.
He pressed back into the warmth, wanting to tell Cass just how much he wanted every inch of it inside him. He opened his eyes slowly,
Castiel nuzzled the freckles on Dean’s shoulder down to his midsection as he pulled him up into his lap, spreading Dean’s thighs around his waist.
The hunter whips around, bringing his shotgun up. “Cas?”
with snow. “Uh, is there somewhere I can leave my boots so they don’t melt all over the place?”
Dean gusts out a sigh and pokes at his noodles. "I really don't know, Mom. I haven't seen her in a few weeks, not since the whole thing with dipshit back there." He throws a thumb over his shoulder toward the backyard.
Dean rolled his shoulders and shook out his arms. "Alright, I'll get around to the side, get the door pulled up so he can back in. I'll check in with you when I get back, alright?"
"I don't have anything flat to put her on."
"Dean," Sam pants as he pets the German Shepherd's head, "Meet Comet."
Dean's brain sparks and screeches to a halt at the feel of Cas' lips on his. She's soft and warm in his arms, but her mouth, oh gods her mouth, is sin personified. She nips at his lips and when Dean gasps, she slips her tongue in his mouth and teases his palette, making his toes curl at the sensations she's creating. When Cas pulls back, her eyes are closed and she's panting, and when she finally opens her eyes and looks up at Dean, her eyes are glowing with suppressed power. Cas lifts her hand and lays it on Dean's cheek, and he leans into it.
more stuff than he'd thought, and Bobby didn't have enough space to display everything in the main store. He did have a few of Dean's smaller pieces, but when they found out the spot next to the store was vacant, Bobby jumped on it. Dean had tried to protest but a glare from the older man shut him up rather quickly.
"Hey man," Dean says, crossing his arms and leaning against the counter. "I understand you are looking for Castiel?"
Cas grins brightly. “I’m so glad you are enjoying it, Dean.”
“Mornin’ sunshine. Coffee in the pot. Sugar and cream are over here.”
Sam smacks him in the back of the head. Yeah, he probably deserved that one.
, he decides and gets up to do a few stretches that his physical therapist had given him. Once he’s limbered up a little more, he wanders out into the kitchen and decides he doesn't want to deal with anyone trying to drag him to church (and by all accounts, Naomi will, if she finds him), so he decides to make himself scarce.
"She is. She's my best friend."
Lisa looks at Cas and bites her lip. “I guess it does seem kinda sudden-”
Dean's shoulders slumped. "Let's take this out back," he said, turning away and leading them to the back porch. They leaned against the railing, Cas letting Dean work through his thoughts until he took a deep breath. "Honestly? I'm not doing great. This feels like it came outta left field."
Shorthand for 91T (68T). In the phonetic alphabet, T is Tango, and we usually just called ourselves that to make life easier for everyone. Whiskies and Romeos do it, too (68W-Combat Medic and 68R-Food Inspector, respectively). Think of it like this: instead of the COL sticking his head out the door and yelling for the vet techs, he can just yell out “TANGOS! Get over here!” Much easier.
Dean chuckled, making Jack bounce around on his knees and grin over his shoulder at him.
“Huh? Oh, must have bashed my head on the steering wheel. I’ll be fine.” That explains why his ears are still ringing. Might also explain the fuzziness he seems to be having now that he thinks about it.
"Yeah, I don't really blame you on that one."
"Missouri! Dean! Cas! Oh, God, MISSOURI!" Gabe runs up the side of the house where Dean and Cas had gone in and pokes his head in, hollering for the three people in the house. "DEAN?" he yells and is about to climb in when he sees them heading toward him, Cas and Dean supporting Missouri between them. He helps them climb out and takes Missouri as they stumble down through the siding.
They lapsed into silence again, checking their lines as the bobbers moved around. He'd missed this, the quiet and content of sitting with his best friend. "Cas?"
Cas blanched a little and looked away. "Ah, she never spoke with you about it, I see." He sighed, pulling his hat off and running his hand through his hair. "Shortly after you two started dating she made it clear to me that there was no room in your relationship for me."
Numbly, Dean takes his hand and shakes it. "Dean Winchester, Cas' friend."
Dean radios out for the team to set up, and seconds later, it starts to hail. "We've got hail," he reports back.
"OK amigo," Ash said, drawing Dean out of his thoughts. "I've got everything I need. Let me know when you start putting your new work area to good use and I'll come by and shoot some videos."
"Not that I'm complaining about seeing you again so soon, but what are you doing here on a Saturday night?" she asked as he pulled away and sat down.
. If you fell out of love with me, that's fine. But you should have left a long time ago instead of skirtin' around behind my back."
Castiel trots through the underbrush, keeping away from the leaves and hidden traps that haven't been gathered up yet. Luc had laid out more than what he'd bought from Bobby, so she made a mental note of each location. She slithers around a maple tree, rubbing her cheek on the rough bark to let others know this was her territory before she moves on. She looks over her backyard, seeing it empty before she makes her way to the porch. She flops down on the chair and looks over at Dean's house, heart hurting.
Dean rubbed his eyes as he sat up, then climbed out of bed as thunder growled. He hurried over to his mom. He could hear the TV going downstairs, but he ignored it as his mom took his hand and pulled him out of the room. “Mommy? What’s going on?”
Dean glares and starts to mimic him until a knock on the door stops him. The door is flung open before Castiel can take a step toward it, followed by a Zanna-blur as she launches herself into the bed. She instantly gets lost when the makeshift nest collapses on her.
Chris nodded, "Sure, man, no problem." He took the box from Dean, turned and walked inside.
Dean looks over at the two elders that remain of the pack, Bobby and Ellen. While not a mated pair, they were good friends of the Alpha pair before…
laugh at the poor girl.
Castiel nods and tilts his head. He closes his eyes and stands up straight, rolling his shoulders back. He feels his Grace rush through him and allows his wings to manifest on the physical plane. A gasp next to him has Castiel opening his eyes and looking over at Dean.
“Dean!” Dean turns in time to see his big little brother run up to him, his wife Jess by his side. They both have big grins on their faces. Sam grabs Dean up in a big hug. “Oh my God, Dean. It’s so good to see you.”
Dean shakes his head. “I dunno what I’m doing here, Cas.”
They don't end up catching a turkey, but they can take note of a few rabbit warrens and trails the deer seem to favor. They turn back to go home when the moon starts to set. They're just about a mile out when they stumble on the elk and her baby.
“Oh, yeah? What kinda dog?”
is tinsel. People use it to mimic icicles and stuff like that.”
"Well, yeah. We've got to generate models out of all this data, and I need to run the lab-"
Dean shrugged. "I don't know the answer to that, sweetheart. I do know she loves you, but I don't know what's going on in her head. Just… just give her some time, OK?"
"Dean, what's wrong?"
"I'm proud of you. We'll see you next weekend, OK?"
. Dean’s just about to reach down and pat the dog on the head to get his attention when he hears the whine-
,” he kept his instruments sounds, probably a battery or something— “It’s very good,” he finally said, interrupting his own singing.
Cas knew it’d been both of their first times to do something like that. Now that it was over, he took the time to treasure that fact like the meaningful, beautiful thing it was.
“You were distracted.”
Castiel knew he didn’t enjoy things just because of the physical part, but for the fact that it was Dean that he got to share that with. He would manage, though, because he enjoyed their time together too much and would have to be insane to quit it.
“And what about furries?”
Cas arched an eyebrow, leaning in to chase a kiss. Dean met him halfway, crashing their lips together again.
“If you remember something else,” Sam said —were they even having a conversation?— “call me.”
Dean stripped the bed, too, of the sheet that served as its bedspread. He laid on his back and Cas joined him, hopping on next to him. There wasn’t much space, but that was everything but a problem.
Maybe his face was as fiery as it felt. He gulped. “Peachy. Everything’s going as we planned.”
“It was great, Cas,” Dean said. He sounded honest. He
“Why did you stop?”
The hand on Cas’ hip roamed down his thigh, tracing with the back of his fingers the inner sensitive part of it.
and continued to eat her toasts.
On his phone, he opened a recipes app nobody had to know he’d downloaded.
Cas smiled, so genuinely and so bright Dean felt lucky he got see it. He was even proud of himself, getting those smiles out of Cas.
“Sam says you’ll like it,” Dean answered, “so I’m pretty curious.”
“But you deserve better than me.”
Dean moved his fingertips to Cas tie, slid his hand past his belly, over his thigh. Cas didn’t move. Dean was impressed by how well he was keeping it together.
“You’ll have to tell me tomorrow what did you think.”
“Huh?”
“Not long ago.”
“Whatever this is —you know he loves you, don’t you?”
“And this is Cas! He has nowhere near enough experience fighting without his powers.”
That’s how he would define himself? As someone
Dean looked down, unsure if staring was rude or would make Cas uncomfortable. He wondered if he should just keep kissing him instead.
Dean cleared the table, handing Cas the plates.
Cas snorted.
Dean woke up from a nightmare in his room.
As the performance came to an end, the crowd dispersed. Cas waited until the band members put their microphones in place and left the stage. He was standing on the side of it, waiting for Dylan, the demigod and lead singer.
“Can you forgive me for being an asshole?” He whispered.
He pulled apart when it was over, staring into Cas’ eyes.
“Don’t overdo it,” Dean asked him. The last thing he wanted was to listen to fake moans.
Dean nodded curtly. “It’s working perfectly.”
Doing it actually prompted his own arousal even more, so he repeated it to see how far he could take them.
He wanted to surprise Cas with one of his favorite breakfasts so far: a Spanish tortilla.
Castiel didn’t want to assume that Dean actually meant—
And to think they could sleep in until as late as they wanted.
Dean carefully placed Cas’ feet back on the floor.
“Do you think they’ll let me go?”
“Not necessarily,” shrugged Dean.
Cas’ eyes softened, looking between Dean’s eyes and his lips. He leaned in, going for a kiss.
“Then,” Cas stopped, separated, prompted Dean with his hand to lay full on his back. “Like this,” he said, hovering over Dean, aligning their dicks.
“We get Cas back. Of fucking course.”
Led Zeppelin, rock in general, it sounded like Cas.
Cas did like the joke but chose to reassure Dean anyway. “You’ll do great, babe.”
Dean’s grasp traveled to the soft and silky hair, finding home behind Cas’ warm neck.
“It means, Cas. I got hurt. Like physically hurt.”
After a vampire hunt went a little sideways, though, was not the moment Dean had imagined himself recalling all of that in his mind.
Sam sighed and leaned against the table.
“Just saying, it’s just as obvious that he likes you, too. In case you hadn’t noticed.”
Dean didn’t remember unpinning Cas’ wrists over his head, but his hands were now resting on each side of Cas’ hips.
Dean smiled warmly and hugged Cas, not minding that it brought stimulation below the waist. “I love you.”
Sam leaned back. He read his brother’s face.
A symphony for the invencible.
Yes, he’d seen Cas’ dick, but he’d never felt it and much less had it against his own. The mere thought of it made Dean want to strip them both then and there.
Dean looked up. Cas’ eyes were closed.
He was already looking for the closest gun, ready to face anyone that could’ve broken in, when Cas walked out of the longest hall in the bunker.
“So.”
"I'm not sure."
Dean smiles as he puts her on speaker and gets back to his cutting. “Hey, Mom.”
"What in the world was that all about?" Castiel asks the other alpha.
"Can we beat him?"
"Oh," she breathes, moving around Dean and going to her knees next to the kitten. "Oh, Dean, he's adorable." She gently pets between his eyes and the kitten leans into her touch.
"For some reason, I feel like you are proud of yourself. And you should be." He pushes away from the counter and gets the stuff out to make himself a sandwich with a loaf of misshaped bread from the bakery. He tosses Cosmos a piece of the crust when she comes over to investigate.
Dean’s eyes are glued to his wings. They shuffle with his nerves, and the movement breaks Dean’s reverie. “Wow,” he says and rubs a hand over his mouth. “Cas, I-”
"We'll do everything we can to track Dean and Zanna," Max says, eyes flashing purple.
"Oh, come now. You should be flattered that word made it all the way back to me in Seattle." He stands up, hands going back to his pockets. "My good-for-nothing brother is good for something, at least. Even if he did get ahead of himself and attempt to trap you before I got here."
Dean waved at Ellen as he and Cas entered the bar. Ellen waved back before she slung her towel over her shoulder and made her way to them.
"Ah, that makes sense. Plus, it's good for cuts and scrapes."
Dean decides, in true Winchester fashion, that the key to dealing with the hurt he's feeling is to avoid the problem.
"Sam, I'm already on my way. Charlie filed an order of protection and Lydia knows she's not allowed to go anywhere near that house."
Gabe hangs over Balthazar's shoulder. "Cas, please! Red meat! We crave sustenance!"
Cas throws an apologetic look over his shoulder to Dean. “Meg, I’m a little-”
“I wouldn’t have offered if I wasn’t.”
"Zanna, sweetheart, time for dinner. Shift and put your robe on so you can eat."
Sam grins as he interprets for Eileen. When a smile lights up her face, they climb out together.
"I already tried calling, Cas," Sam says. "The lines are down."
Dean grumbles under his breath, then sighs.
Cas gives him a short history lesson of the town as they walk and lace up their skates. As Dean tightens his laces, apprehension rises sharply, and he swallows hard.
She smacked him in the chest with the back of her hand, but Dean could see the smile stretched across her face. "No sassin’ me boy, or I'll not let you have any of the apple pie I made this afternoon."
Dean's eyes widen, and he turns around, running back to the house. "Mose!"
"I'm glad I'm back." Dean drew out of the hug and slapped Sam's shoulder. "We'll talk more tomorrow. Get that wife of yours to a bed she can actually stretch out on."
Dick cuts him off. "Get off this frequency, Dean!" He reaches over and snaps the radio off.
"COME ON!"
Gabriel listens intently to the radio in the bus.
“Alright. Well, why don't we go? You can stay with me; I’ll sleep on the couch.”
“Well, hey there, Clarence. And Dan.”
Naomi wrinkles her nose. "I have no idea what that means, but I'm going to assume it's good." She leans back in the chair and studies him. "How are you doing?"
Dean sagged on the top of the fence. "Hey, Chris. How are you?"
"Good to see you, Dean," she says as Gabriel runs up to her and kisses both her cheeks.
"Were you expecting someone else?" Cas throws her jacket in its normal spot before she comes into the kitchen and takes a seat on a barstool. Dean throws a glance at her before he pulls out a second bag of lasagna. Cas looks tired and worn out tonight, and he figures that she'd be happy to eat leftovers again.
Dean's rather crabby with his other half at the moment.
"OK, I'm pretty sure I'm not a Disney princess, but are you trying to tell me something?" Dean asks the crow.
Castiel buries his face in the pillow and fights to keep his hips still as Dean plays with the downy feathers.
"Yeah, yeah. Hold your horses," Dean grumbles as he gets out of bed and stumbles over to the door, opening it so Fury can scuttle to the guest room and his litter box. Dean follows him down the hallway and goes to the kitchen. He starts his coffee and feeds Fury before ambling over to the fridge to survey his options for breakfast.
"Well, yeah. I don't really have anything."
"No? Well, what you have to go through with your mama, the suffering, that's what l had to suffer with from Walter. One day, we were playing out back, down by the river and we came across the most beautiful anthill you ever saw. And then Walter, he immediately kicked it and stomped on it and just scattered it to the four winds. I just started howling. I was just-" she laughed. "I yelled for my mama. I ran up and I grabbed her and dragged her down there, just crying and carrying on. Anyway, my mama was trying to calm me down, so she said: 'Wait, wait. They're not finished. Not by a long shot.' And we waited and waited and sure enough, those little black specks just started scurrying every which way just working hard to build their home back. And l said, 'Why did they do it? I'd just give up. I mean, it's hopeless.' And my mama said, 'Yeah, you know if there's just one of you. But there's lots of ants down there. And they're all relatives. They're family, just like we are.' Well, that's what families are for. That's why they invented families. So hopeless didn't get the last word. So listen, if ants can do it, I figure we can do it. You know, my Dean has a lot more strength than he's ever known. And one of these days, he's going to realize it."
Cas grins and picks up his mic. “Dean, did you change your mind?”
"God damn son, it's good to see you." Dean half laughed when Bobby pulled back and slapped him on the back of the head. "That's for not visiting your mama more often, idjit."
"Yeah whatever, asshole."
“I saw the light on, so I figured I’d share.” He hands over a new mug, this one white with a grinning sun on it. Dean laughs when Castiel holds up the other one, this one also white, but with a disgruntled rain cloud on it.
Dean rolled his eyes but nodded his agreement. "You and Missouri with your sayings that don't make sense," he grumbled as he walked away to let Missouri know where they were going.
For those who don’t know me, I’m a US Army Veteran. I served for four years, and most of that time, I got stationed in Korea. While I served, I was an Animal Care Specialist, or MOS 91T, and worked closely with the MWD’s and their handlers as a part of my mission, along with my fellow Tangos.
"Cas," Dean breathed. "Cas man, this - wow. Who's your architect?"
"Mama?"
"Cas! I just saw it-"
This is the signal from a Military Working Dog that they have located something. Usually, the signal is for them to sit down.
“Possibly New Years, as well. Bobby said it might take a while to get the parts in for my car.”
Meg raises an eyebrow and casts a look at the redhead beside her. "Why not?"
Dean levels a bitch face to rival one of Sam's, his brother, at Cas, and crosses his arms over his chest. "Cas. Dude. You don't have to do that to your poor cat. I can start taking allergy meds to make sure that I don't sneeze my fool head off when I'm over. All you had to do was tell me! Hell, I can probably cook up something to down so I'm not putting synthetic drugs in my system."
Dean shakes his head and applies himself to the coffee, now cooled to an acceptable temperature. He pets Gabriel’s head as he listens to the rumble of Castiel’s voice from the other room.
"OK, yeah, got it."
Dean looked over his shoulder with a grin. "I'd like to think I'm pulling it off."
Dean shakes his head. The false levity falls from his face. “This storm is going to be a lot bigger than we anticipated,” he says quietly. “There’s rotation all the way from Grand County up through Logan.”
“I wouldn't pull your leg over this, son; you know me better than that. You think you can make it today?”
"Stubborn. And what if I told you he smells… right?"
She purrs, and head butts his hand.
Zanna sighs and cracks an eye open.
She whines low in her throat and turns tail on him and runs to the house. She hears shouting behind her, and smells burned rosemary and sage.
Ruby rolled her eyes and walked off, flipping her hair over her shoulder.
"It's OK. I'm not going after the key, I promise. I just... Can I pet you again? Please?"
Dean caught sight of the turnoff for Missouri's street and guided Baby through the neighborhood down to the end of the street. He put Baby into park and looked up in time to see Missouri coming down the stairs, Jack following close behind. Dean grinned as he stood up from the driver's seat and wrapped Missouri in a tight hug. He breathed in her soft floral scent and felt his chest loosen slightly. "Hi, Mama."
"Deal," Cas said, pushing himself up. "Coffee is in the cabinet over the machine. Sugar is over the stove."
Well, then. “‘Kay.”
Naomi sighs. "I figured. We're going to need the extra support, someone not connected to the family."
"Put me down!" Dean splutters. They are close enough to the bed at this point, so Castiel grins and tosses him onto it. "What th- hey!"
Dean winced. "I'm sorry, sweetheart. But if you saw it, you know why we need time apart."
Cas walks up to the concession stand. "Can I get eight coffees to go, please?"
Cas pokes Dean in the nose one morning, making him snort and wake up with a jolt.
Dean whistled Aerosmith’s “Back in the Saddle” as he parked Baby behind the store. He made sure she was locked up and burst into the office, belting out the lyrics as he went.
Dean laughs. “If I know Cas, he’s already dragged the entire department out there. Day like today, it’s to be expected. It’s perfect for storm chasing, and he forgets everything else
Winchester, get a hold of yourself. Cas looked at him, concern written on his face as he took one of the glasses and filled it with lemonade. "You OK, Dean? Have you been drinking?"
A tear tracks its way down his face, and he wipes it away, angry at himself before he slips the necklace on over his head and tucks it away under his shirt.
"We're gonna miss it!"
He wants to see if he can actually fall in love.
Dean throws his head back and laughs, his scent growing stronger with his mirth. "I know, Alpha, I'm just giving you a hard time. Yes, I'd like to go on a run with you. What didja have in mind?"
"Oh!" Dean sets the bottle down and dashes for the guest room. He opens the door quietly and peeks inside. The little black kitten raises his head and chirps at Dean. He grins and opens the door wider for Cas to see in the room as well.
The crinkles at the corners of Cas’ eyes appear. “Hello, Dean.”
“You’re welcome. It was my pleasure.”
Ever.
Cas' eyes widen as he watches the funnel start to turn. "Go! Go, go, go, go!"
"Sure thing. Find a spot, and I'll bring it out to you." She gives him his usual beer and shot, and he settles down at the bar. No sense in making Ellen work harder for no reason.
Balthazar pipes in. "I bet Aunt Missouri wouldn't mind a pit stop."
Dean runs a hand through the feathers next to his back. “Good to know,” he hums under his breath. He works through the rest of the feathers on the left side and switches to the right. The piles grow steadily larger as Castiel feels the flow of Grace even out in his wings.
“I’m fine,” Dean responds as they step back from the hug. He clears his throat and motions for Lisa to come over. “Gabe, I’d like you to meet Lisa. Lisa, this is Gabriel. He’s been chasing with us since, well.” He huffs a laugh, and Gabe beams at him. “Hell, he’s been with us since we started this whole thing.” He watches as they shake hands and then looks around. “Gabe, where’s Cas?”
Shit, Cas hadn’t said out loud. “Yes!” He said, too excitedly even for himself.
“I’ll help with that,” Cas said, unbuttoning Dean’s pants.
Dean: cool
It wasn’t one of the mixtape; which, by the way, listening for the first time after a few drinks wasn’t a great idea.
He went for toilet paper in the bathroom, wishing they had wet wipes. He cleaned his own stomach and then handed Cas some of the paper that was still clean.
Some sort of peace flooded Dean’s body, so desperately it was almost ironic.
“No. This was adorable.” He kissed Cas’ nose. “I love you.” He kissed him on the lips. “And I love that you love my brother and yes I’m jealous he also got a heart-shaped something but I’ll get over it.”
Dean massaged with his thumb the middle of Cas’ back, also keeping him stable as they made frenzied love.
“Yeah,” Sam closed his laptop and passed a hand through his hair. “I’m ready.”
Dean thought there were only for outdoors, like kissing benches. This one, though, this one was different. It screamed kinkiness and a wonderful make-out session to come.
“Because, Sammy,” Dean harshly hit the control buttons, staring only at the screen in front of him, “she thinks Cas and I like each other.”
Once safe, Dean was frustrated, desperate.
Not that he didn’t enjoy it, he just felt so detached to the actors on the screen that it was somewhat boring.
“I missed you too, Dean.”
He licked his lips, finally finding sounds in his vocal chords. “Why 13?”
“I know, right.”
While she was distracted with Sam, he took the blade piercing Cas’ torso. He surprised her, letting his anger drive his movements as he did to her the same thing she’d done Cas.
Cas snorted and did the same: he stood up and undressed to his plaid boxers.
Dean gasped softly in the kiss, heart beating so fast in his chest he believed it was going to explode.
Cas kneeled in front of Dean’s bare legs. He tapped twice with his full palm on Dean’s outer thigh. “Like that.”
It was exciting just like a first kiss could be, but also comfortable and easy, like it had happened before. Maybe because of how much they trusted each other, maybe because of how long they’d been waiting for that.
“Wha-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean is freaking out because I ordered a Hawaiian pizza,” he explained.
Hugging him, looking at him, feeling him, Dean wasn’t scared. Not of dying, not of losing anyone he loved. He felt safe. Whole. So goddamn grateful to have someone love him so badly despite everything he’d gone through, despite how broken he always was.
Cas smiled, or at least that’s what Dean thought the spark in his eyes was.
Dean put a hand on Cas’ shoulder, massaging it.
Dean wrapped his hand around Cas’ most intimate, vulnerable part, and Cas’ hands became somewhat erratic, failing to support him comfortably any longer.
He looked up, ashamed and feeling like a scumbag.
“Why did you do that?!” Cas protested, as Dean opened the fridge and grabbed a can of beer.
“We’ll meet you there,” Dean told Cas, then, getting a small smile in return.
Dean’s hand slipped past Cas’ boxers and tugged at his dick.
“Dean, don’t you think-”
“Would you like to ask for it?” Dean whispered.
worth of playing on repeat.
Dean walked past him in the hall with his own towel in hand.
“Sam?” Dean called. “Cas?”
Dean waited. Sooner or later, Cas would return to the bunker. To talk, or to ask for help on a hunt, or to offer help on a hunt, but he'd come. And Dean would be willing to confront him then.
“Yeah. I summoned her earlier. She gave me the demon blood so we’re all set.”
Dean gulped. Castiel took off his shoes and undid his belt.
It also smelled like Cas still. Not in a bad way, but of his deodorant, maybe some soap of his, or his shaving cream, or whatever supply he needed now because he was human.
“Dean.” His voice was clearer. He put his hand on Dean’s chest.
Dean nuzzled his nose on Cas’ soft hair. “One day, Cas,” Dean commented, “we’ll have a place of our own, we’ll do whatever we want, not having to lie to anyone to have this, and with breakfast in bed included.”
“Dean.”
“No.”
with Cas?
After vows were said, Dean took Cas’ hand in his, carefully sliding a white gold ring into his finger.
The kissing was dirty by then. Cas panted back from Dean’s mouth and they took a moment to just breath.
Dead nodded. “In all honesty, it was good. Salty.”
Dean hummed, keeping the pace just as slow, but securing a hand behind Cas’ neck. His fingertips brushed the hair of his nape, guiding Cas almost unnoticeable to tilt his head further to a side.
Sam nodded. “What’s next, right?”
being honest, Castiel could tell. “But for the sake of this relationship, I don’t think we should do it again.”
When they got to the motel, most of the tension had already dissipated. There was nothing the right songs couldn’t do —only a psycho wouldn’t love The Beatles.
When he found it, buried under hunting guns and utilities in Baby’s trunk, memories quickly flooded him: his childhood, all the difficult moments Air Supply got him through, all the times he shared it with Sammy so they wouldn’t feel alone when their dad wasn’t around.
Now it was Dean’s turn to look over his shoulder, through closing eyelids and fluttering lashes. Cas was paler than him, so the arousal made him look redder, blushed not only on his face but also around his neck and collarbone. And holy mother of Christ,
“Very nice plan, Cas,” he teased.
“Specifically, love and affection between couples, babe.”
He stormed out of the archive, feeling like a hurricane. Of emotions, of torments, of pain and of unjustified anger.
“So…” Sam teased. “You’re sharing clothes now? And your bedroom?”
“What song?” Dean asked, before his brain short circuited.
The room was nice, a mix of modern —mostly because of the huge Mac on the desktop— and antique —said desktop was made of mahogany.
Cas: Sam?
They went to a small studio Dean had never been in before.
“Do you?” He insisted.
“I have to stand with Dean,” Cas said.
“You’re telling me you want to sext?”
“Ah-I’m close, Dean.”
Cas’s fingertips pulled the waistband down, first lowering the underwear to only reveal Dean’s ass. He spied over Dean’s shoulder, biting it when he saw the even more stretched fabric pulling at his dick. He slowly released the tension and unhooked the border from Dean’s erection, setting it free.
Taking it inside, he planned what he’d burn on the CD. First, there had to be 13 songs. His favorite, of course. A couple of Bee Gees hits, and a few Abba songs, and ballads by brilliant singers like Billy Joel and John Denver...
They were rolling on the bed, laughing hysterically, when Cas straddled Dean and pinned his wrists over his head.
The lights flickered and the walls rumbled as if a storm was going down. Dean had a cut on his palm and a dark light emerged from a small bowl on the floor.
onion rings.”
(And that they both knew would actually come true).
humming to some rock tune Dean didn’t know.
“Cas,” he moaned, so disarmed and so wantonly, resting his head on Cas’ upper leg and grinding softly against the bed as he came, toes curling included.
Their friends didn’t have to know about it, and at that point, Sam was convinced Cas was his brother’s best friend, so nothing weird on that end.
Dean sighed.
realize that only benefits you, right?”
“We’ll catch you up, man. It’s a long story,” Dean said.
No. Dean knew Cas better than that. Cas would never feel genuinely attracted to someone he knew had done evil.
Dean: starting
Can you tell this is from the day they announced SPN would end after its 15th season?
Cas rolled his eyes, finally kicking his underwear off his ankles. “I’m embarrassed.”
“Valentine’s Day? Wanna know if there’s a monster that hunts happy couples or somethin’?”
“Please, Dean, I want you.”
“Newsflash: I’m using them too, Cas. So what? It happens.”
Any other day, Dean’s plans would’ve been completely different than staying in —there, out of all places— since it was 5 in the afternoon, but he would make the most of his time alone with Cas.
He was coming too.
Cas shook his head. He smiled softly. “You really weren’t paying attention, were you? To what I said?”
Waking up next to Cas was one of the most remarkable moments of Dean’s life.
“Wow,” Dean said, full of sarcasm, “even back-up plans. We should start a wiki on how to be real heroes.”
In the war room, Sam was sitting like a mom that waited for her teenage daughter after curfew. Cas wasn’t around.
Cas winced, “You’re not into that!”
Dean turned to the closed door. “That lock works, right?” He asked.
“Hey, Cas, what’s up?”
His still freshly washed hands traveled across his face as he entered the kitchen.
“Uh, Cas,” Dean said, pointing to a nightstand to their side “there are tissues on the first drawer.”
It had been some time—7 or 8 months, probably—since Dean’s hands held Cas in them with a fierce determination that forever changed the course of their relationship.
“Oh, and did you use protection?” She asked bluntly.
Sometimes, he was good at pretending they didn’t carry the world on their shoulders.
Cas’ answer was something close enough to a nod.
Castiel had to make a choice, and it was not difficult. The blade fell from his hand, as if he was absent; automatic.
Cas cupped Dean’s cheek, passed the back of his fingers over it, and cupped it again, bringing him closer.
Artist Cas ♥
Yes, Dean could do that. Not like it was bad. It was quite awesome, actually.
Like Castiel could get a ‘hookup’.
He got out from the duffel bag the wooden stake and looked at it closely.
Cas rolled his eyes.
great on Cas.
“Cas.”
Cas’s grinned widely, so much even his eyes were smiling by themselves. “What?” He asked back, putting a hand behind Dean’s neck and the other on firm his waist.
“What the fuck?”
“Me too, Cas —fuck-”
Cas considered it for a moment. If doing it thinking about Dean was good, doing it while Dean listened and did it himself, thinking about him —yeah, it was a definite yes.
Dean considered it, quite surprised. Who would’ve thought it; Cas taking initiative in bed?
“Fuck, Cas, what are you, a sex god?”
“Feel you cum in me, filling me up-” His breath hitched. “I’m coming, Dean.”
Finally, to top it all, Cas had developed a love for rock music. For rock! Of all music genres out there, Cas liked the one Dean couldn’t begin to understand.
Sam turned to the screen again, hitting play. “Okay, yeah, whatever. What do you want?”
Not that Dean would admit it, but the day before he separated his bed from the wall. There wasn’t even a room next to that wall, but better safe than sorry. He smirked noticing the gap behind the headboard, already anticipating whatever happened later.
“And what was that moment?”
“Shit,” he murmured, realizing Dean was probably waiting for him to say something else. He looked down, meeting lustful green eyes, and nodded. “Great start.”
He walked into the kitchen. His breakfast was served. He took the plate and went to the library.
A couple of moments later, after wipes passed through their fingers and bodies, Dean held Cas’ face in his hand.
“Better than ever, buddy.”
“Thanks, Cas. I love it,” he said.
Castiel wasn’t going to push, because he knew better. He knew waiting patiently was the smarter thing to do. He’d rather have Dean coming to him whenever he needed him, over pressure them and breaking the whole deal off.
Dean peeked in the bag. It smelled like paradise.
Dean sat, one arm behind his back to support him, the other bringing Cas in. Morning breath could fuck off, really. He gave him a peck and whispered, “I’ll start writing my vows when I get home.”
How much did Sam know?
“Hell yes,” Cas teased back, licking the corner of Dean’s mouth.
“Yeah?” Dean said.
, but he realized it probably wouldn’t be of much help.
Dean played with Cas’ balls, getting another exquisite pleasure sound out of him.
Dean looked at him, and the way he drank the coffee so deliberately, not swallowing it right away but actually savoring it. Dean couldn’t shake the thought out of his head of how would dense, sweet, good coffee taste on Cas’s mouth.
Dean grabbed Cas by the arm and started running to the breach.
Cas was standing in front of the bathroom mirror, door open, fussing with the last few unruly strands of his hair. He had some product Dean wasn’t familiar with that he knew Cas didn’t normally use, making his hair intentionally messy but perfectly balanced and visually pleasant at the same time.
The blade became meaningless at the moment; it slipped from Dean’s fingers and fell to the floor as he gently laid his hands on Cas’ chest and knee.
It wasn’t something Dean would’ve wanted to answer, but it wasn’t a complicated question, either.
“That’s cute.”
Keywords: were supposed to, because Dean had been investing so much energy keeping his hands to himself that he wasn't even thinking clearly anymore.
It was addictive. The more times he was with Dean and the more different things they tried, the more Castiel realized he couldn’t get enough of Dean.
“You sound —I don’t know —annoyed.”
Sam was going to be out for 25 minutes —even half an hour to get all his hippie stuff. Meaning, Dean and Cas were left alone between ugly flowery wallpaper, twin-sized squeaking beds, and a really-not-memorable yet familiar smell for both of them.
But he didn’t say that.
“I meant it, you know?” Cas said, careful not to break the light atmosphere around them. “I’d been thinking about it for a while now.”
Which was, for Cas’s standards, like seeing him naked.
It’d started mostly out of boredom and plain desire, in a nasty motel room in Nebraska.
Cas huffed a laugh. “Not quite that cool.”
He knocked on Dean’s bedroom door, opening it after he heard a soft “Come in.”
Canon verse. Cas tries to dirty talk.
“Back in the The Elysian Fields, we only survived because we were going to work with them,” Sam said.
The shooting in his mouth was everything, and beyond. The pulsing of Cas’ dick on his tongue, being able to savor every hit, swallowing around it as it softened and wondering how that might feel for Cas, how his legs tensed and then relaxed—
“Right now, Cas?”
Castiel caused tremendous pain: underneath his fist, there were bruises, cuts, swollen tissue. He was not physically hurt in the slightest, but he was conflicted, going back and forth between the warehouse and Heaven.
Something in Dean lit up in flames at the words. Mostly, he identified the feeling as desire.
It became a routine of sorts, sometimes going to Cas’ place and sometimes going to Dean’s. They’d go each other’s places at least once a week, hang out, brush hands on the couch if it was safe enough.
The tablet landed next to them. In one hand, Castiel held Dean’s broken wrist. In the other, he held an angel blade, using the end of the cool metal to strike Dean’s face repeatedly.
Dean sighed. “I guess, yeah.”
Dea huffed. “You tell me.” He looked down at himself, aware of Cas doing the same.
“For you, I think it is. Was, in fact. Sexual release, no commitments, no need to deal with people’s opinions on you being attracted to men.”
he thought.
Sam nudged the back of his head after a stupid joke he’d made.
“Can I do it bare?” Cas asked, stroking Dean’s aching hard-on.
Dean took a sip from his beer and turned to his brother. He was also quiet, but the lack of a potential catastrophe biting their asses kicked any negativity out the bunker.
Through the cotton of his boxers, Cas was stiff and burning hot. Dean slipped his thigh between Cas’ legs, because two could play that game.
“I care about you,” he finally said. Realizing he’d been silent for too long, it was probably a miracle Cas hadn’t left the room by now. “I just-I can’t deal with it. I’m not good with feelings. And I don’t wanna hurt you. If all of this, skin and sex, was something we both wanted, I was willing to have that, at least.” He wet his lips again and took a deep breath. “I wasn’t and I don’t think I’ll ever be ready to talk about it.”
He wrapped a hand around the head, and the other he rested it on Dean’s hip.
Silence.
“Fuck,” he whispered.
If you were a song, you’d be a beat
Dean knew Cas had to look more attractive than usual. Seducing a stranger was part of their plan, after all.
He should’ve known that was going to happen.
After some fighting, he pulled Cas by his trench coat to get him to the portal that delivered them from biblical evil. He extended his arm to Castiel, and Castiel took it. Dean held part of the dirty beige sleeve, while Cas had his fingers secured around Dean’s jacket.
Dean held Cas by the hip bones, sneaking his thumbs underneath the hem of the t-shirt.
Cas’ expression was blank. He was just standing there, staring at Dean. Then he gave him this understanding look, like he knew what Dean was talking about, like maybe he didn’t blame him for being a disaster of human being.
“He says about the guy that has never done it before,” Dean deadpanned.
They kissed lazily afterward, Cas collapsing against the wall and Dean holding him despite not being much more stable either.
He removed his jacket, then the tie. When he was done, he tried to figure out the look on Dean’s face. It was guarded. Lower, though…
On Dean’s bed, one of the many places with memories of their bodies being driven by passion, they laid down after an amazing and almost restless night.
Cas’ hands caressed his back, settling on Dean’s waist. They squeezed, encouragingly, excitedly, and filled with emotion.
“Well, sue me,” he said playfully, “but a handsome young man is on my bed, wearing only boxers, and I’m inexperienced as fuck.”
“A warm-up,” he corrected. “So, you think it’d be easier over the phone?”
“Yeah, mom, stayed up until one playing.”
And there it was again: the reminder of Cas’s humanity that had Dean crazier for him every day that passed.
Sam snorted. “What? Why would mom say that?”
“Sorry,” Cas mumbled.
“Do you… want to get some rest? Maybe you’re sleepy?” Dean took a seat on the side of the table. Cas took the chair at the head.
Cas asked, “Animal familiars?”
“No, no, no, don’t put this on me. You’re the one defying the natural order of things,” he said.
Cas’s tone was light when he answered, “Because I have 13 favorites, I guess.” Dean nodded in silence, carefully grabbing the tape. “Anyway, I know it’s not your style,” he sighed, “but I hope you like it.”
Dean kissed him from his cheek to his lips.
Mentions of unhealthy relationship (not Dean/Cas).
Okay, not that much, but human Cas definitely didn’t worry about having more often than not a scruffy, unkempt stubble adorning his face, and after discovering how uncomfortable his suit and trench actually were, he never wore more than a round-neck t-shirt and jeans.
So he interlaced fingers with Cas’ over his hip, and with the other he reached for Cas’ neck, keeping him close.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Ewgh. Well, I can’t complain about having less of a job to do.”
He was fully dressed, frustrated, and ready to leave.
He felt his mouth going dry when he tried to speak. His heart started beating even faster than before. It was louder, pounding in his ears too. Even some stupid tears were threatening to come out of his eyes.
“Very,” Sam agreed.
“Uh-”
“I’ve seen your soul, babe. It’s not like I know every little thing about you, but I felt this and I recognized it.”
“I guess it’s working, right?” Sam asked.
Before it reached the coffee maker, Dean’s hand peeled a yellow sticky note from the table. Written in Cas’ handwriting, it said:
He couldn’t help but imagining, though, just briefly, how great Cas’s nipples would feel, hard under the shirt.
They kissed with applause and playful cheers on the background.
Dean turned to Cas, who carried a bundle of clothes, mostly gray and black. Dean spotted the blue one, though, the one he loved so much on Cas because it brought out the color of his eyes.
Very slight NSFW content.
“I agree.”
So it was just them, and their dates they couldn’t talk to their friends about, and the kissing in the janitor’s closet between classes, and the texting at nights that made them more than paranoid about lending their phones to anyone.
“A stupid deal.” Dean’s eyes got watery. He really couldn’t replay the moment in his head without tearing apart. “He’d-” He licked his lips, spit it out. “When we wanted to get Jack out of there, Cas traded Jack’s life for his. And when he experienced a moment of true happiness, he’d be gone.”
He wondered how the thing never actually got lost and if it was still functioning. He wouldn’t question, either, how it was there for so many years and he never noticed.
“Dean?”
“Don’t forget the extr-”
Dean: are you in bed already?
Sam put the iPad on the table, looking at Dean. “We certainly could. And then what, aim for the head?”
Sam sat behind the map table and opened a file on the tablet. Dean leaned over his shoulder to look and Cas did the same.
He had no freaking idea how, but he had something that was worth fighting for and he wouldn't give up on it.
“Dude, seriously?” Dean asked from the passenger seat of his own car, keeping a hand firm against his torso, so the bleeding wound wouldn’t ruin the leather.
Would be a masterpiece.
“It’s frustrating. I mean, I love this, but the more things we do the more I wanna try.”
“What?” Cas asked, mortified.
Dean only covered again with his underwear, not caring at all about zipping his jeans up again.
“Holy shit, do that again?” Cas whimpered. Then added, quickly, because manners, “Please.”
Castiel, with light footsteps, stepped next to Dean’s bed, sitting on the edge. Dean put away the gun in the nightstand drawer.
It was soft. Not a warning, not a demand, not a complaint. It didn’t sound like a request or plea, either.
“Can’t wait for breakfast, then.”
“What are you even talking about, Cas?” Dean said. “You don’t have to do that. We’ll find another way.”
“Yeah. Uh, when we do that, I wouldn’t want it to be with subconscious tricks in the middle.”
“Ask Dean.”
“Sorry to disappoint you, but real life isn’t a soap opera where everyone you know is in love with each other.”
“Wow, guess who’s got the place for themselves,” he teased.
“That maybe you should take off that shirt to wash too,” he said, pointing to the one Dean was wearing. “You’d look better without it, anyway.”
Cas frowned. “What?” His voice was full of concern. Then, just a tone more seriously, “Tell me.”
“I wanna be under you, knees on your shoulders-”
“Finally!” Gabriel’s voice echoed in the restrooms.
Still buried in Cas’ neck, Dean moved Cas’ wrists to his right hand only, sliding the left one down his torso, hanging a finger in the belt loops for a moment.
to be. “Does it even matter?”
Cas nodded. “Right, sure. So,” Cas looked at a clock on the nightstand, “I guess I’ll get going, right? The concert starts 40 in minutes and we’re like 20 from there.”
A crack opened. It was black and nothing could be seen on the other side.
“Okay.”
Cas rose to his feet, offering his hand to Dean. Dean didn’t use it to stand up, but held it anyway and followed Cas.
“Cas would die for you, too. In fact, the guy would die for a puppy if he owned it for a day! Fuck, maybe even less.”
“Morning, baby,” he said, handing him the plate with a smile. “So, this may not be our place and we may have to lie to get this, but,” he looked down at the short pile of pancakes, “at least I could get you breakfast in bed.”
Dean’s shoulders tensed in the slightest way. Castiel was glad to see the effect he had on someone as gorgeous and experienced as Dean.
Cas didn’t seem to get the memo, though. His eyes filled with this disappointment and pain —fuck, it hurt to get that look from him.
“You know, for practicalities,” Dean said lightly.
Cas left the bathroom in shorts and a tee, with a towel hanging around his neck and still drying up his hair.
Dean’s heart fluttered. He couldn’t think of a sweeter way to start off his first Valentine’s Day with Cas.
Their stares were so loud Dean could see floating lines of everything they were saying:
—mid-thigh ones!
“I don’t have to answer, Cas. We never agreed on that. Besides,” he sighed again, louder this time, “it wasn’t exactly pretty.”
Cas put his underwear in place but left the shorts on the floor. He went for a clean pair of boxers and handed them to Dean. They were the plaid ones he’d used to go to Dean’s place.
Sam was in the library when the lights wavered and the walls, the floor, and ceiling trembled in the bunker.
Without having gotten an answer, his right hand went for the doorknob and opened it.
“You don’t have to say it back, Dean.”
“Oh, I know you were playing. I meant protection as in the antivirus for the console."
“If we agree to it and we’re both aware of it, there’s no harm,” Dean said, getting his underwear back in place. “And, just to clarify, I should make crystal clear that by seeing other people I mean doing this kinda thing with other people.”
Dean: you're hot, Cas
Dean leaned in, with bravery running through his veins and joyful tears filling his closed eyes. Cas’s mouth seemed like the one thing that would fix Dean forever and the bare brush of their lips really showed Dean a glimpse of Heaven.
“If you think we should stop,” Dean said, coaxing him out of his trench coat and jacket too, “you can tell me.”
He patted Cas’ shoulder tenderly, waking him up.
And then he vanished.
It was Dean’s turn to pay some attention to his boner. He palmed himself, noticing a wet spot on the fabric.
Then Cas implied Dean was a role model, and Dean—he just couldn’t believe that Cas, an ancient being that had seen the creation of the world, thought so highly of him.
“Hey, sunshine.”
“It’s all good. I just appreciate our privacy and,” he stroked Dean’s temple, “I didn’t want to start these things over text, y’know?” Dean nodded, still close-eyed. His eyelashes looked so pretty this close. “C’mon, kiss me. Let’s pick up where we left off.”
You’d sound like peace,
Sam and Dean leaned against the bar table, while Cas was part of a small crowd gathered in front of the stage where the band performed; he was in the first row and pretending very well to enjoy being there.
“Hang out with Sam for a bit, I’ll be quick,” Dean said.
Cas’s eyes were gentle. He looked just as happy as Dean was. “That sounds great, Dean.”
“And friends, right?” Cas asked. Dean tilted his head, puzzled. “Was this inappropriate?” he said in concern.
The conversation focused on Dean, and as he tapped the mark on his right forearm and terrible memories crossed his thoughts, he realized he didn’t deserve such esteem coming from Cas.
It was Friday, so their parents didn't oppose to their gaming sleepover. They didn’t have any reasons to distrust them for sleeping in the same room, either.
"Hey, so are you coming tonight or not?"
“Huh?”
The mental image got Dean going, but that sigh, that tone, “Listen, Cas, you don’t have to do this only because you wanna make me feel better.”
“Yes, the extra fries,” Cas answered.
Cas put a hand on the arm Dean was using to massage him. “I say the same thing,” his fingers moved up to Dean’s neck. “You’re also a little nervous.”
“Yeap. Won’t take too long.”
It wasn’t too bad, just the graze of an angel blade on the surface of his skin. He actually could’ve driven, but Cas was in perfect shape and he’d insisted on taking them home. Sam was waiting for them in the bunker; he’d stayed because it wasn’t supposed to be a complicated hunt.
Dean shook his head pulling back and holding Cas’ hand in his.
They pulled back, blown-eyed, heavy breathing.
“I’m so sure, Dean.” Cas kissed the tip of his nose, then his lips. “I'm sorry. You're right, I should've asked for your permission to do that. I did it because-” Cas looked away. “For me, there’s no fun if I know we’re both pretending. Like this, for a moment, in a way, it was real.”
“Even, I don’t know, knife play?”
Cas giggled. “Sure. Alright.” He left the two brothers alone.
Dean smirked. He let his hand go down Cas’ back, loving the soft skin, green eyes fixed on blue to then take in Cas’ gorgeous naked torso. His thumb caressed Cas’ waist, made it to his hip, returned to rest on the ribs.
Cas moved to Dean’s shoulder, looked him in the eyes. “Maybe I can invite you to my place next time.”
“Fuck, Dean-”
Dean paused the game. Cas threw him a panicked look. Sam turned around.
Cas felt Dean nodding next to his face.
“Not the right place right now, but eventually,” Dean joked, using the hand that was still on Cas’ hip to turn him around. Cas grew bigger under his hand as Dean pushed himself against Cas’ ass, the other arm around his torso.
Cas turned to him, eyes soft on Dean. Was he imagining that? That little spark, the light behind his eyes, the thousands of unsaid words that Dean was thinking about— Was Cas feeling that too?
Cas didn’t answer. Sam followed him to the kitchen and waited.
She gave him a knowing, motherly look over her shoulder.
Castiel didn’t know he could sweat.
Dean left the plastic bowl on the coffee table, holding a cold, sweating beer in his right hand.
He felt like he’d lost so much time he’d never get back with Cas. He wanted to feel grateful because they were finally there, and he did! He just couldn’t brush away the guilt that came along with the feeling.
“I love you.”
Right before Dean pushed his finger in, he frightened. What the fuck was wrong with him? He was about to take advantage of Cas! He was about to do something he’d promised not to do!
Cas could almost feel the release of all the hormones in his body making him light-headed and so, so in love with Dean.
“Don’t you ever do that again, goddamit, Cas.”
“Dean?”
They pulled back and Cas hugged Sam. Sam patted his back and smiled wide.
Cas pulled Dean to a corner, where there was a loveseat. And actual loveseat, S-shaped and designed for people to kiss on.
A supernatural force pulled Dean to the other side of the breach, and Castiel’s hand slipped away from his with ease.
Dean pursed his lips together, then answered.
Cas sat on it, and Dean accommodated on top of him across the seat, leaving his legs to hang from the armrest.
Cas: I want you to be here with me too.
Human Cas.
“You’re an amazing kisser too, babe,” Dean said.
“Uh, yeah. You’ll catch his eye, for sure.” He shrugged, finding as fast as possible something else to look at.
He closed his eyes for a moment, not moving, just enjoying how it felt. Hell, he’d dreamt of that, he may as well internalize how it was for later uses.
With his chest still rising and falling, he whispered, “I came.”
They restarted the kissing, this time with more determination. Dean slipped his tongue full in Cas’ mouth, tasting and letting him in too.
He put a hand on the table, palm open facing up. Dean looked between Cas’s hand and his palm. Dean’s heart was pumping so fast he could feel it in his fingertips as he decided to put his right hand on Cas’s.
Secured around a warm ceramic cup, Dean’s hand lifted to his lips and he sipped the bitter coffee.
“Things never go past kissing when we’re alone. Or even texting, y’know, it never gets like this.”
“Be right back,” he murmured.
They fell asleep, but Dean woke up exalted after a while, noticing it was 1 am. He sighed,  relaxing. They still were on time.
“Fuck, yes, you can put it wherever you want.”
“We’re good.”
Cas frowned, looking terrified.
Sam considered serving him a cup, but decided better.
Everything bounced back to Castiel: he was the violent one, who caused agony on his way, and that was why he carried a ton of guilt on his subconscious mind.
He walked into the kitchen, following the delicious smell of food. He couldn’t make out what it was —it seemed like bread, then cake, honey, everything good in life— until he saw it for himself.
Based on and inspired by the events of S11E12 “Regarding Dean”.
Cas intervened in the conversation with a crazy thought, an impulse of an idea, with something that clearly was off the table: “I could seduce him.”
“What? That he won’t want me to go back for him?” His voice raised. “That he was too happy to die and we shouldn’t save him?”
“Jerk.” Dean went to stand next to Sam, drying out with a towel the dishes he washed. “How are you holding up? For real.”
“I’m going to run an errand, boys,” he said. “I’ll probably be back after you’re gone, Dean. Good to see you.”
Dean went around the bunker looking for Cas, until he saw the back of his trenchcoat behind a library table. He walked to him, resting his chin on Cas’ shoulder.
Dean leaned his head back on Cas’ shoulder. “Yeah.”
“Yeah, me neither.”
“Sam’s staying at Eileen’s tonight,” he grumbled. “Now, can we stop talking about my brother?”
I’d dance to your beat to feel you close,
Navy blue and dark grey suit sleeves hung around their wrists.
Cas's grace drained his body. His knees fainted a little.
“Nice,” Dean murmured, unable to hide his intentions.
Sam gaped. “No shit.”
He started slow, never parting his gaze from Cas’ eyes. He pushed only until he noticed the doubt in Cas’ face, the minor change in the way he looked at Dean.
was something.
“Right,” Dean whispered. It was 3 pm and he usually left at 6. If Mr. Novak estimated he’d be back after that…. Yeah, they had time.
Cas didn’t mind the scrutiny. He smiled to Dean, meeting his eyes, and put a soft hand on his hip. Dean couldn't stop staring, so he just did that while Cas slowly came closer to him, finally resting his dick between his ass.
“Never,” Cas whispered.
“That’s what makes it good!” Sam said.
“Uh,” Cas said, taking his hand off there suddenly. “Is that- is that alright? Does it make you uncomfortable?”
“I don’t think there’s anything you like I wouldn’t try.”
“It’s wrong getting off on faking you’re taking advantage of someone.” Another realization hit Dean in the face. “Wait, how did you know?”
Dean tried to catch the mess with his hand, but it was a lot harder when it wasn’t only him. It was kind of useful, but there still were some parts of their stomachs and chest with cum.
Cas scoffed, relieved.
Dean nodded vehemently. “I promise I will.”
“The name’s Miracle,” Dean said. “We rescued him after Chuck vanished everyone.”
Sam stayed silent for a bit. He drank from his beer and finished it. He clearly connected the dots. There was not much else to clarify.
“I’m done in the police station. Did you talk to the family?”
Dean moved up and down, changing the pressure on his cheeks, trying to rub Cas’ head on the roof of his mouth—
“Like what?” Dean asked, still a little unsure. Cas had barely gagged him and it wasn’t pretty at all, he really didn’t want to do something much worse by mistake.
“Yeah,” Dean finally snapped out of his thoughts. “Sam and I will leave in a few. We’re ready anyway. Aren’t we, Sammy?”
“Brightest red?” Cas asked.
He kept running and so did Cas next to him, with the lifeforce of a whole battalion.
“C’mon, babe. You always do it to me. I wanna show you how good it can feel. Only one?” With his index finger, he teased the crack of Cas’ ass over his underwear, stopping it right above his hole.
That was their cue.
“That’s beyond the topic.”
“Are you kidding? Thank
Sam shrugged. “Yeah, of course you like him, doesn’t mean you’re getting in each other’s pants.”
He didn’t know what to feel like since his life was no longer controlled by someone else. He had no idea how freedom was supposed to feel like, look like, taste like.
“Please.”
Things went down exactly like they’d expected them, smoothly uneventful. They’d at least managed to spend time together, despite Cas’ dad being around, but it was better than nothing, and they could kiss goodbye in the doorway before Dean left.
“I’m telling you that I thought maybe you were holding back. Or I was, I don’t know.”
Dean nodded.
“But?”
Dean was on his bed, leaning against the headboard and cleaning his gun. He was wearing sweatpants and a cotton shirt. Without the usual numerous layers, it was almost as seeing him naked.
. Dean wasn’t used to nice things like this.
Dean let the words click. He needed to form an opinion before he said anything. He stood up, the almost empty bowl of popcorns forgotten on the armchair.
Maybe because it was thin and Dean could almost make out the muscles on Cas’s back as he washed the dishes, maybe because it reminded him of his own old tees.
“Cas, do you know what today is about?” Dean asked, hugging Cas around his waist.
Cas pushed Dean’s legs apart, sinking just a little further in Dean, keeping his mouth as tight as possible.
Cas smiled a nervous smile.
Dean would've made an arrogant joking comment on that, but he couldn't. He was giving something else a lot of thought.
Dean nodded, smiled with his eyes. “Yes.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “We were just getting started, Dean. It was…”
Dean smiled. “Naturally.” He went to kiss Cas’ neck, biting softly and careful not to suck long enough to leave hickeys. “I’ve been dying to, um,” he whispered, “suck you off.” He looked into Cas’ face, searching for approval.
“Yes. It is.”
“So amazing,” Dean breathed out. He could barely speak. “Lemme help you out with that,” he said, then grabbed Cas’ raging boner.
Dean nodded. He wasn’t in love with the idea, but it was more than he’d come up with as an alternative.
Dean went up and down Cas until he couldn't take his own hard-on anymore. He stood to his feet, much to Cas’ whimper in complaint, abandoned Cas’ ass for only a second, got his own dick out and jacked them both off with Cas’ help.
“Cool,” Dean said, receiving the pile in his arms, the smell hitting his nose again just briefly, and putting the shirts in the washer.
“That’s not a precise answer.”
“Awkward.”
Dean’s left hand held the steering wheel with confidence. His right one, though, rested between his and Cas’ thighs almost awkwardly. His fingers flexed. He wasn’t sure what he pretended to do.
“Well, excuse me for wanting to do something for you-”
“Dean, can I ask you a question?”
Dean smiled. “Okay. Forgive me if I suck, no pun intended,” he said.
Cas pushed Dean’s shoulder back. He was frowning.
Other than his own, Dean had never seen another hard dick in real life. It was thrilling.
“It’d be an honor.”
. Dean looked up, finding so much caring in those blue eyes he almost shivered. Cas added, “So maybe you can start enjoying the music I like.”
Sam gave him a look, because he knew Dean too well not to know he hadn’t been paying attention, but waved his goodbye anyway without saying anything about it.
“I…” He let out a breath. “We’re okay. We’re
Dean whispered something—words of praise, of love, of reassurance and of trust—and then Cas’ knuckles started to slowly turn white as they held on the messy sheets.
Dean, fixing his eyes on Cas —damn it, how were they so dark already?— moved his hand from the loops to the buckle of the belt, undoing it along the slacks button and zipper.
“Wait, is it over?” Dean asked, confused.
Cas shrugged. He said, “Unless you want to get a snack or something.” Dean grinned. “No, don’t say i-”
“What?!” Now Sam was out of place, too. Amazing. “You think you know what this is?”
He cupped Dean’s cheeks.
Sam gave a small laugh.
♡ The end ♡
The cotton was soft under his fingers. It was a black round-neck shirt, worn out and thin. It had a fading logo on the center Dean didn’t recognize, but his best guess was Guns ‘N Roses.
“Something different, huh?”  Cas asked, interest and lust clear in his eyes. “What would that be?”
Cas’ voice surprised him.
Perhaps the feeling wasn’t peace, but excitement. Joy, because he was finally free.
He stretched his hand to Dean, making him flinch with fear. Dean held onto Cas’ sleeve, asking again for redemption. Finally, Castiel’s palm was set on Dean’s jaw and healed.
“Guys!” Sam called from the kitchen. Dean jolted away and his hand was back on his lap faster than he processed doing it. Sam added, “It’s almost ready.”
A fire lit up inside Dean. He’d heard a lot of dirty lines before, but for some reason, it was one hell of a turn on to be asked for such an intimate gesture.
“So we’re making out,” Dean said, brushing his lips against Cas’.
God, he was despicable. It was wrong, and immoral, and weird, and what would Cas even think of him if he knew he’s sexualixing him so much without his consent? Or, like, without even suspecting that Dean was into guys?
“Dean,” Cas blurted out. “Can you kiss me again?”
Blindly, Dean undid Cas’ belt and jeans.
“I believe you want me, as well,” he stated, sure.
He faced Cas, the one in front of him, looking for answers.
If that was the reason, then-
“Kiss me,” he asked, instead, with low voice, almost as if he was embarrassed.
“Sam, I didn’t tell you everything. From the moment he,” Dean gulped. “He went into the Empty.”
“Good,” he whispered on his mouth.
It all happened too fast: the rage filling Dean, he and Sam shooting their weapons with trained aim, and nothing but flying dark blue dust in Cas’s middle.
He flopped down on the bed and Dean joined him.
After all, he gripped him tight, seeing his soul through the contact, fully healing and repairing him. He found strength, humility, and a deep understanding of the word ‘family’. From Castiel’s palm, grace emanated in waves of light to bring all of that back to life, out of hellish misery.
He got his index and middle fingers in his mouth, underneath Cas’ dick. The fullness was new for Dean, but not something he wasn’t enjoying.
"I'm sorry.”
, Sammy.”
Sam was across Dean, Cas next to Dean, his father to his right in the other end of the rectangle.
“I’m here, Cas, come on, just follow my voice, alright, I’m right here.”
Dean smiled.
Sam's arm reached for them through the crack.
Cas: Not if you don’t want to.
Cas, in the meanwhile, was
“Fuck, Cas, I wanna do so many things with you,” Dean grunted.
Dean kissed Cas’ hairy inner thighs, from his knee to where the leg met the pelvis.
He hoped he’d never be losing it again.
Castiel took off his trench coat and put it on the nightstand next to Dean’s bed. Dean’s eyes traced the action, without missing a bit of it.
“Hi. I, um, wanted to talk about the other day.” Castiel was self-aware of every part in his body. The way his hands hung on his sides, how he was too rigid on his feet. “In Nebraska.”
Cas questioned Dean about his “suicidal plan” of being sunk into the ocean.
“Because it can fuck us up. It’s not easy to maintain a friends with benefits relationship. Hell, I don’t think there even is a right way.”
Cas leaned in and met their lips in a kiss, soft and chaste. With their mouths still pressed together, continuing to give brief pecks to the other, Cas put his hand on Dean’s temple.
Cas nodded. "I'm ready. I trust you.”
Cas angled his face to a side, meeting Dean’s eyes, close to his own.
“Right, sorry. I’m just still, you know, recovering from the best orgasm I’ve ever had.”
Dean gathered courage and snuggled closer to Cas. Cas rested his forehead on Dean’s shoulder.
“I wanna feel you, too. I always want to,” he whispered. He sounded needy.
“He says,” Cas argued back, “because he has no previous reference.”
But now he knew. He was sure his life was his and his only to control.
“Cas?”
A tear met his finger. He brushed it away.
Mr. Novak nodded, turned around, and walked out of the entrance.
Dean was sure his forehead would be marked for life with the lines of his current frown. “Sam, you cannot be serious about considering that.”
Castiel placed his hands on the demon’s head. They served as a bridge for his power, which flowed through his whole body to focus there in order to snuff off Crowley’s servant. After screaming, it fell away and Castiel offered Dean the same hand. It showed companionship, and also support.
When he opened his eyes, he found Cas sitting there, cross-legged, looking down at him, and with a plate on his lap.
Dean didn’t like to admit it, but his and Cas’ thing was pretty much a comfort
“I know you’d never hurt me or force me to do anything. That’s precisely why I had to tell your subconscious that it was alright,” he said, stroking Dean's arm. “And that’s also the reason you never mentioned me you had this fantasy.”
When Dylan returned, Dean had to focus his stare in Sam’s eyes. If he didn’t, he’d probably look like a creep spying on strangers. It was just too difficult to ignore what they were doing, being all close and friendly.
“Of saying the wrong thing,” Cas whispered.
“Oh, my God,” Cas whispered, already so fucking lost in it. He petted Dean’s hair, down to his neck, then only held the longer hair near his forehead.
to look like he was the most edible being on Earth?
Sam’s eyebrows furrowed. It actually did.
“We walk out of here. It’s not like we’re not gonna listen to him park outside.”
But he felt something. A powerful hunch, a feeling radiating Dean’s soul, a tiny whisper in his mind almost if Dean was projecting from thinking too loud. And Castiel didn’t like what he was sensing.
Dean wrapped his arm around Cas. Having him near, holding him, showing him how much he cared for him —the weight it took off his shoulders was so giant he wouldn’t have believed it.
Although Dean did sleep naked on a regular basis, he thought it would’ve been kind of mean if Cas had to go knowing he would be leaving his boyfriend to sleep naked on his own. So, he decided to put on his PJs again.
Dean turned around and pressed his ass to Cas’ dick.
Dean knew this vessel used to be human before Castiel showed up, but somehow it made so much sense that it was meant to carry an angel.
Dean didn’t like that part of the plan. Not that he liked any part, but the particular idea of Cas leaving early —so no one would suspect he wasn’t alone—, made him uncomfortable in a different way that the thing of Cas flirting with the guy.
“Sorry. Was just thinking about… you.” Dean pressed Cas’ back full on the wall, hands under Cas’ thighs.
“Yes. Can you forgive me for complicating things?”
“If you’d said furries I probably would’ve just undone the subconscious trick.”
Lineage (Linaje, in Spanish) is an expensive brand of rum here in Venezuela.
Castiel knew this human like the back of his own hand.
Maybe there was a little bit of appreciation in Cas’s eyes, and surprise, too, but he didn’t address it when he spoke. “I was thinking we go to the concert, he thinks I’m alone, I flirt with him, take him somewhere private, alley outside, maybe, and you shoot at it. It should work, right?”
“What are you arguing about? I heard you from the library,” he said, calmly.
He clenched his ass, figuring it might feel nice for Cas, and the grunt he earned for it,
“Is Eileen coming tomorrow, by the way? For the… nerd thing you got going on?”
“You didn’t.”
“Uh,” Dean said, “Or not?” He prompted, doubtful.
“You know very well we don’t have to do anything. We can stick to what we’ve done before, we can put the layers back on, and trust me when I say that I’d still love you.”
Dean smiled hazily. “The final dirty talk, wow.”
Cas caught Dean off guard when he kissed him. Dean kissed back, but Cas had other plans. He nipped at his bottom hip, then gave Dean pecks on his cheek all the way to his ear.
“Anything I can help you with, Cas?” he said, then kissed his cheek.
That was Cas’ limit, and he surely could work with it.
There are two versions here: the one I sent, and the one I liked the most but couldn't send because it was 4 sentences long :(
Cas told him he’d invited Dean over to stay, he’d said that it was fine, and asked him not to make a mess in the kitchen if they were preparing dinner.
Dean could literally hear the angelic glow coming from Cas’ palm.
“My brother has very questionable taste,” Dean answered, with the phone already on his ear. “Hey, yes, can I have…” He turned around and left the kitchen.
Insecure hands accepted the mixtape as what it was: a gift.
“Care to explain?” Sam asked.
“Cas,” he whispered, passing his thumb over Cas’ cheekbone. God, he was so handsome. “Cas, what the fuck just happened?”
Since the memorable mixtape gift, that Dean treasured with his whole life, Dean had been thinking about a discman he and Sam had when they were kids. He wanted to give Cas back something meaningful, too, in the shape of music.
They're in High School, but they're seniors :)
“Good. Trust me on this, then: whenever I say no tonight, I mean yes.”
He offered his friend advice, telling him to let go and admitting it was the opposite of what he would do.
“I wanna celebrate,” Cas answered.
“Cool it, Cas, Sam’s gonna come to check on us-”
“You don’t put pineapple on pizza, dude, that’s what’s wrong,” Dean said.
“I love you, too,” he said.
“Wait, wait, wait,” Cas hissed.
Dean gasped, enjoying it right away. Cas kept the humping motions from before and Dean really wanted to touch himself, actually started to, but realized he wanted to focus on Cas and only Cas.
“So, Castiel, do you like soccer?” John asked, finally changing the subject.
Cas sighed, easily convinced. Who would deny oral sex twice? “Okay. Should I let you know when I come?”
“Yeah.”
He returned the cup to the counter, grabbed the pitcher from the machine and poured Cas a cup. He added it some sugar, knowing Cas preferred it sweet.
Cas rolled his eyes at the silly line. Dean rolled on the bed, giggling, then sat on the edge. “Wait,” he said, holding his index finger up.
“You’re such a good kisser,” Cas murmured, kissing only half of Dean’s mouth, then his full lips again. It was a brief brush of tongues.
Dean took another look. It was different than seeing them in a mirror. He appreciated a different angle, saw the whole picture, the way Cas melted against him and tried to keep their bodies in full contact –he should consider asking him for permission to record them having sex someday.
Although his hands were wet with Dean’s blood, Castiel’s fingers wrapped firmly around the grip of the blade.
“Come on, Dean. Look at you. Take a shower, go to bed. Have you eaten?” Dean couldn’t reply. Of course. “I’ll keep investigating. I promise.”
“Well, Cas is coming,” Dean announced. Sam turned slightly over his shoulder, nodding at the familiar peripheral perception of Cas.
” Dean repeated, indignant.
Dean kind of missed when Cas enjoyed food as well, but he didn’t comment on it. Instead, he asked him about the Claire situation.
“Sure. Thank you, Dean.”
“We’re in your subconscious mind,” Cas explained. “Those are the real us,” he pointed with his head to the other set of Dean and Cas.
It still gave him ideas, at least. Of positions to do, and phrases to say, and things he’d like to try —the thought of Dean tying him up excited him like he had no idea just a thought could do it.
Cas shrugged casually. “It’s like you: always angry.”
“Hm?”
“Whatever. The demon is too busy performing anyway.”
, that Dean hadn’t been with anyone else since their ‘thing’ started. It was very reassuring.
Dean and Cas were supposed to be arranging books in the library.
“We can, I don’t know, say more people are invited. I could even invite Sam.” Dean frowned. Cas added, “He could sleep on the guest room.”
“Dean.”
Dean noticed Cas exchanging a final smile with the demigod before going to the bar. He stayed a few customers away from Sam and Dean.
It started gentle, not like the heavy makeouts in closets from school. No, this was… so loving, so patient. Why not taking their time, after all? That was what they were here for.
to see other people.” He let out a loud breath, too frustrated to care about adding, “Even if it didn’t end nicely.”
“I… Listen, I don’t like the idea of people using you. They don’t know what you’re really worth.”
He held Cas' shoulder, then slowly traced down his arm under Cas' watchful eyes. Dean returned the hand back to the shoulder, then slid it behind his neck.
When their hands were still again, Cas’ behind Dean’s neck and Dean’s on Cas’ upper back, they started kissing. Cas couldn’t help but smile into the kiss, making it perfect instead of the teeth sabotaging the moment.
“Only if you return the favor.”
The spot where Dean sat was hidden and Cas sounded confused when he didn’t see Dean on his bed. He stepped around the door and smiled.
It was also a little distant, like so many things were happening at once Dean couldn’t wrap his mind around any of them. Like he wasn’t appreciating enough how good it all felt.
Not even the smell of the bacon frying was as delicious.
Cas grumbled, getting on his stomach and supporting on his elbows. “Terrible phrasing, babe.”
“You’re gonna like it, I swear.”
“I don’t think so. Unless you tell me something that proves otherwise. You were always using me. And I was always using you, despite my emotional attachment.”
“I haven’t been able to stop thinking about what we did since then.”
He couldn’t see shit, actually. Not even his palm in front of his face.
“Sure,” Cas said, effortless. Casual.
“I’m just reading. About tomorrow.”
, but also works as a standalone.
He rolled his eyes. If he kept opposing to it, he’d give himself away(er).
Sam frowned. “Dude, TMI.”
Sam arched his eyebrows.
Cas knew from the increasing taste of cum that Dean was getting there soon. He prepared himself mentally for it, concerned that it would feel odd.
different —he was never able to tell the difference between his own choices and Chuck’s scripts.
Since that day, they couldn’t get enough of each other.
Meg’s voice —the Empty’s— filled their ears.
“Another case? Bad news?” Dean asked. Cas’s shoulders tensed and hunched at the same time. “Sorry. Bad day.”
Dean was dialling the number on the box when Cas walked in the kitchen.
Cas nodded.
Miracle laid on the floor next Dean’s feet and he got excited at the sight of Sam.
So yeah, he was in fact a total creep.
His father only laughed, probably clueless of Mary’s suspicions.
Sam laughed, harder this time. “Yeah, what? I mean-”
Cas smiled. “Yes. Do you know that I love you?”
Dean realized that, by not arguing anymore, he was accepting to go with the plan. Which, hold on a second—
“I wish you were here, touching me,” he panted.
“Cas!”
“Okay. What happened?”
that’s why girls liked that so much.
“And where are these dudes, again?” Dean asked.
Sam was back in town, buying groceries. Dean’s theory was that he was finding an excuse to stay out of the bunker: when they came close to killing each other by mistake, space was something nice to have.
They’d been craving those embraces for too long, and they had no interest in hiding it.
On Saturday, over breakfast, probably the highlight of Dean’s worst moments in history took place.
Dean: I MEANT YOU'RE LATE. Fucking autocorrector, always changing everything I say
“Only head,” he promised, getting Cas’ dick and balls out.
“Yeah,” Sam said. “Eileen thinks they could be sons of Hecate, the goddess of crossroads and ghosts.”
Cas pursed his lips together. “And thirsty.”
The more Dean explained it, the worse it sounded.
The back of Dean’s fingers caressed Cas’ jaw. Then, he cupped it in his palms, pulling him in.
anal intercourse, to be specific."
“Very.”
He walked into emptiness, blackness and void. He couldn’t see the floor beneath him, but he knew he wasn’t flying, nor floating.
“Besides,” he continued, “you were okay with it! With me still having other hookups.”
Dean looked away. He took a deep breath. “Listen, I’m so happy you’re here. Hell, I’m in cloud freaking nine. I wasn’t gonna stop until I got you back.”
Dean waited until Cas landed his mouth on his, moving his lips to follow Cas’ slow rhythm.
Dean felt the air in his chest being punched out as he thought of an answer.
“Can we discuss them afterward?” He sat next to Dean and put a hand on his leg, just like Dean had started things the first time. “I promise I won’t avoid it. It’s just —I can hardly think right now.”
Dean started moving faster, quickly becoming erratic, and Cas moaned around Dean’s dick. That subtle vibration was one of the best things Cas had ever done to him and, if he didn’t hold back, he’d be coming for the second time that night in the blink of an eye.
“Cas, listen, this is different.
Dean picked up the sauces bottles from the table and put them in the fridge.
“We’re having a good time, huh?” he breathed out, his fingers loosening on Cas’ waist so he could actually caress him.
Back on his knees and with Cas’ dick in his mouth, Dean’s feeling of fear and self-disgust dissipated in his chest. He looked up, meeting his eyes with Cas’. Cas nodded weakly.
Dean hit the wall he was just leaning into, being pinned against.
Cas smiled softly.
Dean took a greasy fry from the basket and ate it. He brushed his fingers “clean” on his pants out of habit, then exchanged his empty plate with Cas’, which had a still untouched burger on it.
He’d also developed a love for burgers and greasy food in general. Dean wished he’d copied his own healthy habits, but apparently since he had his own tastes Cas’s plans were to turn into the opposite of Dean's.
“I tried to be okay with it,” Cas said. His jaw finally relaxed. He sighed and shrugged. He looked unarmed. “I know I said I was, and that’s on me; my mistake. I should’ve known I couldn't handle it. I just wanted you so much I was willing to accept anything and —well. We definitely can’t keep this thing going. Not like that.”
“Mmh?”
Some minutes —4, maybe 5— passed where they just listened to each other’s quiet little gasps and, in the distance, some slickness of skin on skin. Dean felt heat pooling in his stomach, almost on the edge.
“Cool. If you want to sleep, please do so. I know time in the Empty can be… different, right?”
Based on and inspired by the events of S5E08 “The End”.
Dean: …… yes
Dean went to the kitchen and got him a glass of water.
Dean was dying inside, feeling Cas so hard and hot against him. He broke the kiss, gasping for air. Cas currently was the definition of sex: all flushed, sweaty, with disarrayed hair and his heels pressing Dean impossibly closer to him.
Cas kissed Dean on the mouth, nuzzling afterward.
Dean snorted, shaking his head slightly. “Right.”
He wasn't ready at all, though, for his hottie of a roommate to start walking around the apartment in nothing but freaking
He wished the future where his friend became powerless and hopeless never became a reality.
"I've been thinking about us lately," he started, getting a curious
“I don’t, Dean, okay? I certainly don’t. But something is definitely going on. And I’m sorry for worrying, but whatever this is, it deserved that lights flickered and shit like the first time he stepped a foot on Earth.”
Cas walked into the war room, wearing his Aerosmith tee and cotton shorts to his knees. He was eating cereal from the box.
Dean leaned his head back, just enough to see Cas’ face. He was glad to meet with a slow nod and soft eyes.
Dean couldn’t admit it to Sam. And it’s not like they weren’t in the middle of a serious thing, where Cas’s life was potentially in danger, to give much thought to the idea of Cas returning his feelings.
“Please.”
“Good to see you too, Mr. Novak,” Dean replied.
. His. Dick.
“Wow,” he said. His eyes went directly to the salad. He even picked it up, eyeing it. “Was this Cas?”
Dean supported a hand on Cas shoulder and looked him in the eyes.
“I think it’s working,” Sam said.
“I asked first.”
With his coffee in hand, he went to the library, books and boxes scattered all over the place.
He stayed there for a couple of seconds, gathering himself, then went to lay next to Cas.
Cas only stared for a second before he ached for more contact and restarted their kissing, both holding their own dicks.
The kiss soon became sloppy on Cas’ end. He was trembling and finally melting against Dean’s hands.
