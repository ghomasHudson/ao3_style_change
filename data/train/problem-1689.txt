John sat in the chair across from him.  He waited for Sherlock to say something, but Sherlock only stared in to the fire.  Eventually, John gave up waiting and picked up a book that happened to be sitting nearby.  It was a memoir of an old Aldovian war hero from the 19th century.  John read, his attention half on the book and half on Sherlock.  As he read longer and the hour grew later, he lost focus on the book more and more often until, eventually, he was just watching Sherlock as Sherlock watched the dancing embers in the fire.
Finally, Sherlock blinked.  “There’s no possible advantage for you to associate with me.  So, I know your motivations are selfless.”
“You don’t seem very happy about it,” John replied.  Sherlock seemed to be ignoring Mycroft and John was all too happy to play along.
John ducked through the tape and was momentarily frozen when he saw the dead body laying on the floor.  Yes, it was true that he’d seen his fair share of dead bodies but they always came as a shock, especially, when he wasn’t particularly expecting it.  He’d never been to a crime scene before, unless you counted the scenes of the atrocities of war that he’d helped clean up after.  He’d thought they took the body away before inspecting the room for clues, leaving behind only a neat chalk outline.
“I shall treasure it always,” said Mycroft, with an oily grin which shifted to a grimace as he sipped his coffee.
“Sherlock,” said John in a tone of voice that immediately drew all of Sherlock’s attention.  He was smiling but in a way that reminded Sherlock that this small man was not as harmless as he looked and, being both a doctor and a soldier, probably knew at least seven ways to incapacitate him with just the dessert spoon sitting on the table.   “She was nervous.  She just met the brother of her country's ruler.  You could cut her some slack.”
“Yeah,” said John, his face suddenly softening.  “I supposed it would be.”  They both looked out the window for a moment as a light dusting of snow fell in the square.  John watched as a mother and her young daughter stopped to look at the tree in the square.  The mother picked the girl up and leaned closer to the tree so the girl could gently touch one of the large red baubles that was nearly as big as her head.
When they arrived, the gathering was in full swing and seemed to have been going for a while.  There were at least thirty people gathered in the large room.  As soon as they entered the room, Sherlock snagged two glasses of champagne and made his way to a far corner, glaring at people as he went.  To those who went so far as to actually greet him, he bit out a snarled “Hello,” before brushing past him.
“Well, technically your brother and the prime minister and the members of parlement,” said the man, without much conviction.  Clearly, they’d had this debate before.  “Go on in then.”
The snow became tiny, blazing white sparks as it was illuminated by the snowmobile’s headlights.  Sherlock swerved around the trees, coming close to them but not close enough that John was too worried.  It was clear that Sherlock had driven that path many times.
“Alright, you’ve made your point,” said Sherlock as he put the violin back in the case.  He turned back around to face John and his face had gone from stony to stormy.  “I imagine you’ll be wanting breakfast.” He stalked across the room and tried to get passed John and through the door, but John grabbed his arm.
“Everything should be stocked.  Toiletries and a fresh toothbrush are in the cabinet.  Towels under the sink.”
“It’s more fun than room service,” said Sherlock softly, with a smile.  Then he stood and faced Lestrade.  “You are looking for a pink suitcase.  Whoever has the suitcase is the killer.”
“I should have known I’d find you both skulking in a corner,” he said.  “It appears I am breaking up a moment.  Can we expect a happy announcement soon?”
The Prince took a step closer to John, holding out his phone to him but not yet giving it back.  “Come to dinner with me,” he said, his deep voice resonating in John’s chest.
“Just because he’s royalty, he thinks police procedure doesn't apply to him,” John heard Donavan mutter under her breath.  John looked over his shoulder at her, not meaning to glare.  Clearly, he did though because Donavan seemed to back off and go back to watching the street.
Sherlock stood, offering his hand to John. John debated not taking it for only a moment.  But he did and he let Sherlock’s strong hand steady him.
“Pills.  One poisoned and one safe.  He made the victims choose one at gunpoint and then they both took them.”
“Very well.  The new diet must be working,” said Sherlock as he followed Mycroft into the dining room.  “Your buttons are under considerably less strain than they were a few weeks ago.”
The last two presents left on the table were Sherlock’s and John’s.  Sherlock handed his gift to John, a small box wrapped in gold paper and took his gift from John off the table, still in the gift bag from the shop.
Sherlock opened his mouth and then closed it.  Then he opened it again and said, “It’s been a pleasure getting to know you but it is clearly in everyone’s best interests if we go our sperate ways tomorrow.”  His voice was oddly formal, and it was breaking John’s heart.
Sherlock’s hand darted forward, lightning fast and grabbed John’s wrist roughly.  “Don’t drink,” he whispered.  He pulled on John’s wrist, forcing the glass away from the wrist.  “Look at the glass, John.” Sherlock’s eyes were darting around the room.
They walked from the house the rest of the way into town to a pub called the Rose and Crown.  It was situated on a busy square that was packed with Christmas ephemera from the massive tree decked in lights and giant baubles in the middle of the square to the carolers dressed in their interpretation of Dickensian winter wear.
Sherlock turned back to look at him.  Fluffy white snowflakes were gathering in his dark hair and on his eyelashes and his cheeks were already going pink from the cold.  “It’s not there, John,” he called.  “You left it at Angelo’s.  Don’t worry, we can get it back.  Not that you need it.
He scanned the crowd and saw Matilda talking animatedly to Violet.  Mycroft was in a prominent position on the other side of the room, saying hello to an endless stream of guests.  Then he saw Sherlock.
John lips twisted into a small smile.  “Here,” he said, reaching into his pocket and handing over his phone.
John turned to see a man in a chef's jacket, with his long hair pulled back coming towards him.  Sherlock stood and extended his hand for the man to shake.
And John couldn’t even enjoy it.  His mind was spinning, trying to figure out what Sherlock was doing.  This obviously connected to the poison in some way, but John couldn’t see how.  He gently disentangled himself as soon as he reasonably could, and Sherlock let him go easily.  John rested his forehead on Sherlock’s chest, and he felt Sherlock’s hands come down and press in to his shoulders.  Then John pulled away completely and turned to look at the crowd.
“For that, I apologize,” said Sherlock.  He reached out and gently took John’s left hand and slid the ring from it.  “I should have been paying more attention to my surroundings, but I was,” he paused for a moment. “I was distracted.  I didn’t get a look at Mr. Tregennis’s face and there were several servers of the same height and hair colour there tonight.  I needed to orchestrate an event that would hold everyone’s attention except the murderer.  He would see that commotion as a chance to escape, which he did, while everyone else would stop everything to watch.  Especially given that it has long been supposed that I would be unlikely to ever get engaged.”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking.  Sometimes I don’t talk for hours on end.  Wouldn’t that bother you?”
Sherlock was staring down at the scarf, running his longer fingers down the lines of knitting.  The ends of the scarf were decorated with a pattern of pine trees, knit in black yarn that was only visible when viewed up close.
“Well,” said John.  “You got the army service, you got that I was here on my own, you knew all about Harry and Clara and the drinking.  The only thing is that Harry’s my sister.  Short for Harriet.”
John finally got a chance to look around the room which was the first room John had seen that could have actually fit in a normal home.  A nice, spacious home but a home none the less.  It had deep green wallpaper and a large fire place with a roaring fire.  There was another Christmas tree and Christmas cards had been lined up along the mantle and were hung from red ribbons that looped from the rafters.
“Merry Christmas,” said John, looking up at Sherlock.  Because Sherlock was looming again, pressing into John’s space as much as he could without crossing the boundaries into ‘inappropriate in public’.
The cab pulled up in front of the palace and John nearly stayed in and told the driver to take him back to the airport.  But he got out and watched the cab pull away instead.  Then he was standing alone in front of the palace with no choice but to move forward.
Inside, the pub was bustling and warm.  The Christmas decorations were much more subtle, limited to garland, lights over the bar and several strategically placed sprigs of mistletoe.  There was a noticeable dip in the sound level as they entered and people began to notice that the prince had just entered the pub.
“Do you think-“ started John but Sherlock was already running from the table, swinging his coat around him as he went.   John was behind him before he could even consider it, pausing only to grab his coat from the back of the chair.
One more chapter to go!  And it is written and ready to be posted.  If you've stuck with me this long, thank you!  This has been a really enjoyable part of my Christmas season this year and I hope you've enjoyed it too!
“I get enough false flattery from the sycophants that flood the court day in and day out that I don’t need you doing it too,” said Sherlock through gritted teeth.
John stood there for a moment longer, his arms crossed, blocking he doorway.  And then he started laughing.  Sherlock’s face started turning red and John took a deep breath to compose himself.  “Sherlock, I just called you a ridiculous pain in the ass.  Do you really think I’d lie to you and pay you a compliment that I didn’t mean?”
“Tina Peterson, Aldovian Times,” she said, standing.  “There have been rumours of a proposal by the Prince.  Would you comment on that?”
Sherlock looked taken aback.  He released John’s arm and backed up a step.  “For being you.  For being kind to me.”
“You should use it,” said Violet, taking the mug and filling it with coffee before handing it back to Mycroft.
John managed to wait for almost an hour before he left and began roaming the palace.  He checked the family’s quarters where he’d eaten dinner with them and opened presents with them. He checked the music room and the ballroom.  He even checked the kitchen where he’d first met Sherlock.  He saw no one save a few servants who nodded to him and then averted their eyes.
“Such an odd one,” John heard a woman in a slinky red dress saying.  “Especially when we were younger.  He was always so quiet but then he’d come out with the most preposterous things all of a sudden.  Accusing people of stealing or having affairs or cheating on tests.”
He gave Violet and Matilda their gifts first.  He’d found stall selling hand knitted mittens with incredibly intricate designs of snowflakes, mountains, reindeer and trees.  He gave a red and white pair to Violet and a green and white pair to Matilda.
“Because it would be much more comfortable to sit and talk in my room than to stand in the corridor.”
“I don’t know,” said John.  “Yes, I’m fine.  But I have something I need to do. I’ll tell you about it later.”
John was stopped with his hand on the door handle.  Sherlock was holding on to his arm, his grip like an iron vice.  John was forced to turn and look at Sherlock.
“Doctor Watson,” he said.  “It’s nice to see you back.  Come in.  The family’s upstairs.  I’m sure they’ll all be glad to see you.”
Sherlock had said the family was gathering for drinks before dinner in the sitting room next to the music room.  After John had finished making himself as presentable as possible, he made his way there.  He paused outside the door, suddenly nervous.  Though he’d already met the king which should have been the thing to worry about.  But instead, he found himself wanting to make a good impression on Sherlock’s mum.
“We believe so,” said Lestrade.  “Mrs Hudson here says she does not remember hiring him.  We’ve looked through payroll information as well and his name doesn’t appear.”
Sherlock looked pensively out the window.  He seemed on the verge of saying something but finally, he just shrugged.  “This way, John.”
John took a few involuntary steps forward, reaching out for Sherlock’s hand or arm.  Sherlock shrunk back and John pulled his hand back like he’d been shocked.
“Go down to the sitting room as soon as you’re ready,” Sherlock was saying as he looked around the room for his left shoe.  “Don’t wait for me.  Mycroft is already suspicious enough of us as it is.  We don’t need to do any thing else to draw his attention.”
“You could come with me,” said Sherlock, looking down into John’s eyes.  The Christmas lights from the castle reflected in Sherlock's eyes, adding tiny golden sparks to the blue.
The speech began and Sherlock tried to pay attention as Mycroft talked about the year in the lives of the Aldovian people and the royal family, but his attention kept skating back to Sherlock.  His eyes kept flitting back and forth and John imagined he was deducing things about the gathered reporters to keep himself entertained.
“Yes,” said John.  Sherlock leapt up from his kneeling position and he wrapped his arms around John.  The crowd around the erupted in to cheers.  “I needed a distraction,” whispered Sherlock in John’s ear.  “You played a long brilliantly.  Just keep it up.”  Then he leaned back, wrapped his long-fingered hands around the back of John’s head and kissed him.
They walked in companionable silence through the halls that were once again dimmed and lit only by Christmas lights.
At the sound of the knock on the door, John’s stomach flipped like he’d missed a step going down the stairs.  He practically ran to open the door.  And Sherlock was standing there. He was wearing a deep purple shirt that was unbuttoned enough to show his clavicle and long stretches of neck.  The rich colour against his pale skin made his skin look like ice and John found himself wanting to kiss up that long nek until he warmed it up a bit.  He licked his lips and instantly felt embarrassment in the pit of his stomach.
The sweet sound of voices suffices the room, the sound slowly washing over John like the lazy waves of a river washing over stones.  The sound warmed him from the inside out.  He chanced a glance at Sherlock who had his eyes shut and his head tilted back.  John listened to the rest of the concert with half an eye on Sherlock.  He didn’t understand the word of the music, it was in Latin or maybe Spanish but he though he understood the message of hope and joy the music conveyed.
“Why did you come back?” asked Sherlock again and he looked so thoroughly confused that John couldn’t help but smile.
“Thank you,” he said, and he was standing close enough to John again that he was leaning over him, curving around him.
John mostly spent the next few days moping around his flat.  He forced himself to spend a few hours each day searching for jobs and filling out applications and he left the flat to go to the shops or get carry out Indian food from across the street but mostly he stayed in his flat and watched crap tele on the tiny screen, sitting on an uncomfortably springy chair in his dull flat.
After they finished breakfast, Sherlock announced that he needed to follow up with Lestrade about the previous night’s case.  John looked out the window.  The snow was still falling though it seemed a bit lighter than before.
“Not just a soilder.  A doctor as well.”  They were in the cab on the half hour journey down the mountain to the village in the valley below.  The dark forest passed by the car and they had sat in silence for the better part of twenty minutes before Sherlock uttered his non sequitur.
“It’s so nice of you to take an interest in community matters,” said Simon.  “And it’s so kind of the detective to allow you to tag along.”
Shit.  John had just walked in on the Prince doing something odd to a large chunk of a dead animal.  Because of course he had.
“Mycroft always eats breakfast in his study and Mummy usually forgets.  Don’t worry,” he said, finally looking up. “You’re not likely to encounter His Majesty over eggs and bacon.”
“I really don’t think I can stomach another minute with those imbeciles in the other room.  I think I’ll retire early,” he said.
They stopped at John’s door.  John put a hand on the door handle.  “Goodnight, Sherlock,” John said, turning to Sherlock.  Sherlock was standing nearer than John expected, staring down at him, looming really.  John’s heart was suddenly in his throat, pounding fit to beat the band.
He passed behind Matilda, talking animatedly to a woman who looked somewhat familiar, as he circle the room.
“You’re lost.”  It was a statement, not a question and it came from the man who was beating what appeared to be an entire side of pork with a riding crop.  He hadn’t turned around, but he seemed to be too well dressed to be staff and why would a staff member be tenderizing meat with a riding crop?  “You could have kept up with the tour group, even with your limp.  Fancied a look below stairs, I take it?”
John glanced over at Sherlock and Sherlock immediately looked down at his phone, his lips pressed together in a tight line.  “Do you mean, when you deduced everything about my life based on my tan, my limp and my phone?”
They sat for a moment in silence and Sherlock’s gaze returned to the window.  Suddenly leapt up.  “The snows letting up,” he said.
“Sherlock,” said John, his heart breaking a bit and sending wavers through his voice. Sherlock was receding into himself, his lips set in a line and his eyes downcast.  But the hand that was clutching John’s was still held tight as though he couldn’t bring himself to let go.  John brought his free hand up to his chest, pressing over his heart.   “Sherlock, love.  You really are.”
The press conference came to an end in a cacophony of reporters and the screen switched to a news studio where two reporters were analysing the events related by Mycroft and speculating about John.  His picture flashed up on the screen and John felt queasy.
John finished scanning the article, which listed the various events that Sherlock should have appeared at, and then slammed his phone down.  He was seething at this “anonymous source”, though John had a bit of an idea who it might be.  The face of that smarmy bloke, Simon, flashed before his eyes, causing him to see red.  But then, John picked the phone back up and looked at the picture at the top of the article again, at Sherlock’s downcast face during the press conference.
All I want to do is go on a walk through a pine forest in the snow but I can't so I'm letting the boys do it instead!
As John and Sherlock went back through to the sitting room, the passed Matilda carrying a stack of binders so high that John wondered how she could see where she was going.  All the binders said things like, ‘Christmas Party’ and ‘Party Plans’ along the spine.
“Sherlock!” said John again.  He grabbed hold of Sherlock’s forearm and held him still, forcing him to turn to face him.
“Harry Watson.  Clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone.  Not your father.  Could be a cousin but you’re a war hero who’s spending his first Christmas home alone in a foreign country.  Unlikely you’ve got an extended family, certainly not one you’re close to.  So, brother it is.  Now, Clara.  Who’s Clara?  Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment.  The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend.  This model’s only six months old. Marriage in trouble.  Only six months old, he’s just giving it away.  If she’d left him, he would have kept it.  People do.  Sentiment.  No, he wanted rid of it.  He left her.  He gave the phone to you.  That says he wants you to stay in touch. And he just gave you this trip rather than try to get a refund which you took him up on, so you didn’t have to spend the holidays with him.  That says you’ve got problems with him.  Maybe you liked his wife.  Maybe you don’t like his drinking.”
The prince came to stand directly in front of him again, even closer than before.  He put a hand on John’s shoulder.  John looked up because the Prince was standing close enough that John had to look up to see his face.
“Yes, Simon. I was able to be of some small assistance to the police,” said Sherlock.  He tried to move past the group but Simon stepped in to his path, forcing him to stop or squeeze past the garlands surround the door to leave.
“Shot in the dark.  Good one, though.  Power connection, tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking.  You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone, never see a drunks without them.”
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock dear,” said Mrs Hudson, wringing her hands.  “I should have been paying better attention to the staff leaving the kitchens.”
Sherlock was already sweeping through another door and down a short corridor.  John followed him into what must have been intended as a study.  It had large windows and floor to ceiling bookshelves.  A work top had been placed along one wall that was clearly not part of the original design of the room.  Sherlock set the champagne flutes down on the worktop and began pulling out beakers and test tubes and burners.
“Sherlock,” said John but Sherlock was straightening the stationery supplies on the desk.  “Sherlock,” said John a little louder.  “I’m sure I’ll be fine.”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” asked the Prince as he typed a message so quickly, his thumbs practically blurred.
“Sherlock,” said John.  Sherlock didn’t acknowledge him but kept pulling things out of drawers and cabinets.
By this point the snow was beginning to fall more heavily.  Sherlock hailed another cab and they settled in for another long drive up the mountain to the castle.  The castle was visible long before they reached it, the plethora of Christmas lights shining through the trees.
Instantly, everyone turned to the people they’d been talking to and began talking again but this time at a furious pitch and with many, no so subtle glances at John.
“Thanks,” said John.  “It’s all down to you though.  This suit is absolutely perfect.  I should pay you back.”
“That’s alright,” said John.  “I’ll stand.”  John suddenly felt like he was in a confrontation with this man, though he’d done nothing except smile politely at him.
The dinner was much less awkward than John had expected it to be.  Much of the dinner was given over to discussing the upcoming Christmas ball.  There were a lot of last-minute details to be finalized that John would probably have taken care of earlier.  But what did he know? He’d never planned a ball in his life and clearly Violet had planned many.  Still, he would have thought details like the musicians and the flower arrangements would have needed to be settled weeks in advance.
“Celebrating Christmas is traditional,” said Sherlock.  “Aldovia’s main exports are nutcrackers and blown glass Christmas ornaments.  The palace is meant to reflect our national pride in our artisans.”
“Only the CEO of one of our largest corporations and the head of the number one media organization.”
“Thank you, Ma- um, Violet,” said John and he could tell he was blushing again.  He made the mistake at looking at Sherlock how was looking down at him with the smallest, sweetest smile.  It seemed to John that Sherlock had a wealth of different smiles for different occasions and John was surprised to realize how much he enjoyed discovering new ones.
They exchanged gifts as Christmas carols played in the background.  John was touched to see that everyone had thought to give him a gift as well.  As the mountain of presents dwindled down, John had acquired enough glass baubles and wooden ornaments to trim an entire tree.  He was still nervous to give his gifts, but he was glad that he at least had something to give to express his appreciation for his warm, yet bizarre welcome into the royal family.
“He just got a text from someone who could only be the woman he just killed.  It might just be intriguing enough to draw him out.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock. “Hold both these glasses but do not drink.  Stay here.  I’ll be back.” Sherlock shoved the other glass into John’s fingers and took off across the room.  John saw him stop and exchange a few words with Mrs Hudson before the crowd obscured Sherlock from view.
Matilda seemed about to speak but Mycroft cut her off.  “So lovely to see you again, John.  Sherlock’s been showing you the grounds, then?  And the hunting lodge.  So good of you to go out there and check on it periodically.”
“Why?” John asked without thinking.  There was probably protocol for royal interactions like this that John was certainly in the process of cocking up but having the prince this close was very distracting.  It wasn’t even entirely the way he looked, which appeared to be entirely designed to be eye catching.  It was more that having this man’s entire attention and intellect focused on him was exhilarating.  Like seeing some force of natural destruction, a bolt of lightning or the wave of a tsunami, that is so arresting that you can’t look away.
John spent the rest of the morning in the library, reading by the fire.  Mrs Hudson came to fine him around just after noon to tell him there was lunch in his room and the royal address would be broadcast soon.  As John passed one of the large windows on the first floor on the way back to his room, he looked out and saw a sea of reporters in front of the castle steps.
“You’ve a psychosomatic limp.  Of course, you’ve got a therapist.  Then there’s your brother.  Your phone is expensive, a new model.  Scratches.  Not one, but many over time.  It’s been in the same pocket as keys and coins, but you keep it in your back pocket where there’s nothing to cause these scratches.  A gift then.  The next bits easy, you know it already.”
John felt an odd feeling of displacement as he saw the building that he was currently sitting in, and the people he’d exchanged Christmas presents with, live on television.  Mycroft was at the front of the group behind a podium, bearing the Aldovian seal.  Sherlock, Violet and Matilda stood behind him.
Just then, the phone began to buzz.  John picked it up.  “Number withheld,” he said, reading off the display.
John should have felt uncomfortable with the situation, and there were one or two questions that John certainly wasn’t comfortable with, like the question about his thoughts on Harry’s drinking.  When he pointed out to Sherlock that his sister’s self-destructive habits were not his preferred topic of conversation, Sherlock shrugged and moved on, seemingly unbothered by the rebuke.
In all the excitement, John had run out the pub without his cane and he hadn’t missed it throughout the entire long chase through the village. He stepped out of the car, half expecting his leg to give way again now that he was thinking about it.  His leg was fine, and he walked through the ankle deep snow without a problem. Sherlock walked next to him for a few steps, close enough that John could have reached out and grabbed Sherlocks arm if he’d needed to.  But then he bounded away across the snow.
He ran out of the pub and looked around for a cab, but they were all packed.  Then he looked across the river to London Bridge Station.  He started speed walking.  Then he started running.  He ran across the bridge, darting around people in their black tie and cocktail dresses.
Mycroft glared and the room fell silent.  He waited to make sure the silence would hold.  Then he spoke slowly and softly.  “The person in question is an acquaintance of the Prince.  The engagement was not binding and is not proceeding forward.  The Prince has assured me that he has no plans to continue a relationship with this person going forward and the entire event was simply a diversion in to allow for the capture of the assassin.”
Despite the terse, business like language of the note, John found himself running his thumb over Sherlock’s signature.  He tucked the card in to a pocket of his suitcase before pulling out a navy jumper. It was just from some high street shop, a gift from Harry years ago, but he’d barely worn it so there were no pills or holes.  It would certainly look terribly gauche next to the rest of the party goers but John hoped at least that he wouldn’t be actively laughed out of the room.
The song came to an end with a flourish of violins and Sherlock pulled John close.  “I’m sorry for what I’m about to do but please understand that there is a good reason for it,” he whispered in John’s ear.
“It’s fine,” said John.  “I didn’t mind. It was actually relaxing to just sit quietly for a while and not have people talking my ear off or the tele going in the background.”
Towards the end of the meal, as John was finishing a piece of chocolate gateau, Sherlock suddenly cut off in the middle of explaining the Aldovian legal system.  “John, outside.  No, don’t look,” he demanded as John turned his head.  “There’s a cab outside.  It’s stopped but no one’s getting in or out.”
John’s eye was immediately pulled to Sherlock.  His curls were slicked back into shiny waves.  John supposed the hairstyle was more respectable, but he felt that the hairstylist had entirely missed the point in Sherlock’s hair in trying to control it.  John was touched to notice that Sherlock was wearing the scarf that John had given him that morning, the dark blue contrasting with Sherlock’s pale skin in the bright sunlight.
After what seemed like an hour, but was probably only a few minutes, of accepting handshakes and congratulations, Sherlock began moving them through the crowd.  John felt an unfamiliar weight on his left hand.  He looked down and saw the ring on his finger.  Sherlock must have slipped it on at some point during the madness.  It was a bit too big and spun around John’s finger.
“Nothing you don’t want to do,” said John.  “But if you’d like, I think we should move this to the bed.”
“Yes well, there’s pride and then there’s this,” said John waiving his hand at the row of pine trees covered in Christmas lights lining the road.
“Our housekeeper, Mrs Hudson,” said Sherlock.  “It’s ridiculous but it’s traditional and apparently that’s important.”
Every time his mind wandered, Sherlock’s face floated through his head and he was seized with the urge to text him or Google him and see if there were any new news stories about him that would give John some idea of how he was doing.
John cut him off.  “I know all that,” he said.  “What the hell was this about?”  He raised his left hand that still bore the too large ring on his fourth finger.
Everyone else in the room was openly watching them and John felt suddenly in the spotlight.  Just at that moment, Mrs Hudson came in.  “Hair and makeup are here,” she said.
Inside the palace was warm and quiet.  The corridors were lit only by Christmas lights and the occasional wall sconce.  The windows at the front of the castle glowed with warm yellow light of the strings and strings of lights adorning the castles that were reflected in the snow.  As they moved towards the back of the castle, the windows shifted to a muted purple.  John couldn’t help but stop and stare out a large picture window at the end of a corridor.  Though the storm and the clouds and the complete lack of lights stretching out into the distance should have made it pitch black, the scene was suffused with an omnipresent light.  John could clearly see a large pine forest spreading out behind the palace and a mountain range in the distance.
The door opened and Mycroft entered the room followed by a short, blond woman.  John stood and Sherlock followed a moment later.  “You’ve already met my brother.  And this is his wife, Matilda,” said Sherlock.  John bowed again in both their general direction.
John pushed himself back to sit upright.  He cleared his throat and said, “No signs of strangulation. Asphyxiation, I’d say.  Choked on her own vomit. Pills though, not alcohol.”
John swivelled his head from Violet to Sherlock, who was looking down, studying the pattern of the tablecloth resolutely.
“There’s been a murder,” said Sherlock, gleefully.  “Not just a murder.  Four murders!  John, we have a serial killer on our hands!”
He looked up at Sherlock who had that small, uncertain smile on his face again, just briefly enough for John to see it.
He felt Sherlock sigh and his hand come up to John’s sides, clinging to his jumper.   John moved slowly, brushing his lips against Sherlock’s.  Then he moved away and pressed his face into Sherlock’s neck, pulling him closer until they were wrapped tight together.  He could feel Sherlock shaking, his breaths coming in rough exhalations.
Those words knocked John off the cloud he’d been floating on since last night and he came crashing back down to earth.  Of course, it was a one time thing.  Of course, Sherlock wasn’t looking for anything more than a casual fling with John. And even if he were, of course, the Prince of Aldovia couldn’t go getting involved with just anyone.
“You shouldn’t be alone on Christmas Eve,” said Sherlock.  “Stay here at the palace.” John opened his mouth to respond but Sherlock cut him off.  “If you’re about to say you’re concerned out imposing, that really isn’t necessary, I assure you.  There are always far too many people here for Christmas Eve and Christmas day.  It would be nice if there was one among them whose company, I don’t find repellent.”
John looked at Sherlock and the thunder cloud brewing in his eyes.  “It’s perfect,” he said quickly.  “Thank you.”
John looked up at Sherlock and caught his eye.  Sherlock gave him a small nod.  “Excuse us for just a moment,” he said as they made their way to the edge of the crowd.   Sherlock pulled John through a door into the kitchen.  He kept a tight grip on John’s hand and pulled him through the kitchen and out into a service corridor.
He approached the large, carved double doors and knocked.  The door opened and John recognized the footman who had helped him with his suitcase.  The footman grinned.
“Sherlock,” said John when they’d settled into their corner.  “What could all these people have done to you?  Surely they aren’t all that bad.”  John leaned into Sherlock as he spoke, the noise of the crowd giving him a good excuse to stay closer than was strictly necessary.
John stopped a few feet in front of Sherlock but even that wasn’t close enough.  He looked up at Sherlock’s face.  He may have been imagining it but there seemed to be dark circles under Sherlock’s eyes that hadn’t been there before.  They probably matched the circles under John’s own eyes.
It's Christmas morning in Aldovia!  Time for presents and cinnamon rolls (a traditional Aldovian food).
“Oh, sorry sir,” said the waitress.  “Thank you, sir.  I’ll just-“ She curtsied again and left them, practically running back into the kitchen.
Sherlock snarled and yanked his arm out of John’s grip.  John took a quick step to the side and put himself between Sherlock and the exit.  Then he crossed his arms and glared up at Sherlock.  “You’re being ridiculous.”
A few minutes later, Sherlock returned.  “Come on,” he said. He retrieved his glass and put a hand on John’s elbow.  He led him through the room towards the dancing.  They passed Lestrade in the crowd and Sherlock slowed down.
John tapped Sherlocks foot with his toe.  When Sherlock didn’t look at him, he leaned forward, hesitated for a moment and then put his hand on Sherlock’s knee.  That got Sherlocks attention and he swung he head round to look at John.
The Prince stared a John for a moment with a deadpan expression.  Then John’s face split into a grin and the Prince grinned back at him, ducking his head like he was embarrassed.
He was on the verge of opening his texts and texting Sherlock when he remembered his last unanswered text and the conversation they’d had after.  He put his phone down and laid back down in bed and spent the darkest hours of the night trying to convince himself that he really was better off without Sherlock, out of the public eye and living the life that had been intended for him.
The ball had already begun when John arrived.  A small orchestra was situated at one end of the large room, playing vaguely Christmasy music.  Dancers moved through the centre of the room, spinning, and swaying in a way that John could never hope to replicate.
“No,” said Sherlock.  “Sometimes a bit of research is just as good as a deduction.  Did I get anything wrong earlier by the way?”
Sherlock grinned at John and then looked out the window.  “Mycroft did once ask Mrs Hudson to restrain herself.  But Mrs Hudson is a force of nature and nothing short of a signed and sealed royal decree can keep her from doing a thing once she’s set her mind to it.  And sometimes not even then.”
Eventually, John began to turn slowly, wanting to see Sherlock’s sleeping face.  As John settled on to his other side, he saw Sherlock peaking at him with on eye opened just a slit.
John looked at the glass and noticed a line of white powdery film running from the lip down into the bubbling, golden champagne.
They ordered and Angelo disappeared into the kitchen after shaking Sherlocks hand a few more times.  Sherlock and John sat in a silence for a moment, in the vacuum left behind after the disappearance of Angelo’s huge personality.
He woke sometime later to darkness.  There was movement in the room and John tensed until he realized it was just Sherlock.  Several seconds later, John felt the cover lift and Sherlock get in to bed with him.  At first, Sherlock lay still on his side of the bed.  John waited a few moments but when it seemed Sherlock wasn’t going to be moving any closer, John reached out a hand.  He felt Sherlock’s elegant wrist and stroked a finger up and down and long the fragile bones in the back of Sherlock’s hands.
He arrived back at the palace in the late afternoon, just behind a posh red sports cart.  The driver of the car had a strong resemblance to Sherlock, both with the dark hair and the lanky stature though John thought Sherlock was probably just a bit taller.  The man got out of the car and flipped the keys to one of the footmen by the door.  John watched as one of the footmen went to the boot to take out a suitcase and garment bag and the other went to the driver’s side to drive the car away.
John reached the end of the corridor and stopped to consider which way to go next.  Then he heard a violin playing in the distance.  It sounded like it was coming from the right, so John went right to follow it.  Two more corridors and a few turns later and John found himself in a large sitting room with parquet wood flooring.  He crossed the room, following the sound of the violin.  He peaked his head passed a sliding wood door into what must have been the music room.
Sherlock continued to stare at him after John finished speaking.  The light from the firelight shone off his eyes, changing them from pale ocean mist blue to the dark grey of a summer storm cloud.
“That was because of the snow.  You don’t think I made it snow to- What? Take advantage of Sherlock?  Steal from the palace?”  John found himself getting really, truly angry.
“Mmmphf,” said Sherlock, closing his eyes and ducking his head under the covers and closer into John’s chest.
John’s stomach twisted at that and he gripped Sherlocks arm where his hand still lay tighter.  “I can think of many advantages to knowing you,” said John softly.
“I know you would never let a glass leave the kitchen looking anything less than spotless so when I saw debris on the glass, I knew something was amiss. Lestrade,” said Sherlock, turning to him.  “Have samples been taken from both glasses?”
It'll be a few days before I get the next chapter out but we are in the home stretch!!  Happy New Years!
Sherlock reached out a hand and pulled John to his feet.  “I’ll give you a tour of the grounds before the snow starts again.”
PS I would have had this up last night but apparently Ao3 broke last night so I couldn't post it.  So, chapter in the morning and chapter in the evening so I can finish this fic by the end of the 12 Days of Christmas like I said!
Eventually, John gave up and went to Sherlock’s room.  He knocked on the door and then tried the handle.  When he had no response, he decided to wait.  He stood by the door and then leaned on the door and finally slid to the floor and sat with this back against Sherlocks door.  He focused his eyes on a spot on the wall and let his mind drift, trying so hard to think of nothing that eventually, there were no thoughts passing through his mind.
It was fully dark by the time the fire had died down and Sherlock announced it was time to return to the castle.  They bundle up into their cold weather clothes and went out in to the darkness. Sherlock handed John a helmet and pushed his own down on to his head flattening his curls.
When he heard footsteps coming down the hall, it must have been hours later because the sky outside the windows was dark.  John leapt to his feet, swaying slightly on his stiff legs.  Sherlock came sweeping around the corner and then stopped dead when he saw John.
“It’s quite alright,” said Sherlock.  “It was your attention to detail that tipped me off in this case.”
“That was quick, Sherlock. I would have expected-“But John cut himself off because, coming around a bookshelf, was the king.
“This one seemed like one of the interesting ones, but he confessed as soon as they caught him,” said Sherlock.
“I can’t imagine what he’s trying to achieve by befriending Sherlock like that,” said the first man.  “There’s little enough Sherlock can do for someone who’s not even a citizen of the country.”
A conspicuous throat clearing to John’s left reminded him suddenly that they were at a party.  He looked and saw Mycroft standing there.
“What did you text him?” asked John.  He unlocked his phone and read the latest text.  ‘What happened at Lauriston House?  I must have black out.  Meet me at 10 St. Michael's Square.’  John was half curious to see what would happen next and half furious with Sherlock for apparently texting a murder asking him to meet them at the pub.  The two halves warred for a moment but the curious part won out.
“What an apt description.  I don’t think anyone’s put it so succinctly before,” said Sherlock.  “You know, I could have you thrown in the dungeon for grabbing me like that.”
“Shall we go into dinner?” asked Mycroft, taking his wife’s arm, and leading her through to the adjoining dining room where John and Sherlock had had breakfast that morning.
“Thank you,” said John.  “To the best Christmas I could have imagined having.” He clicked his glass against Sherlocks and then raised it to his lips.
“Much as I am loathed to come between you two, Mummy has requested that you come talk to Mr Tuner, the head of the Agricultural Committee.  He has a bit of a mystery for you and we all know how you love your mysteries.”
He stood uncertainly near the door for a few minutes, realizing the only people he knew were the royal family and they were likely to be too busy for John to be hanging on to all evening.  He walked around the edge of the room, looking for an out of the way spot to watch the dancers.
He held off until December 30th at 23:47. He was lying in bed having just woken from a doze and he could have sworn he felt Sherlock’s arm around him.  The absence that had been opening up inside him since their last conversation ached with a throbbing pain that felt almost physical and had John curling up on his side, pressing his hand to his ribs.
Half an hour later, John found himself in borrowed boots and gloves, wearing snowshoes and following behind Sherlock through the pine forest.  He’d been hesitant about the snowshoes, unsure if he could yet fully rely on his leg for balance and support.  Sherlock had insisted that it was the only way to manage the deep snow drifts and John found that an insistent Sherlock was difficult to deny.
“Wow, Sherlock,” said John, laying a calming hand on his arm.  “Ok.  It’s ok. We don’t have to talk about it right now.”
Sherlock kissed with the same intensity of focus he brought to everything else he did.  After a very long time, Sherlock stared kissing down John’s neck.  He hit a spot just below John’s ear and John gasped.  He could feel Sherlock grinning into his neck.  His fingers kept straying to the buttons of Sherlock shirt and eventually he stopped holding himself back.  He opened the first button.  He felt Sherlock go still in his arms, but he didn’t step back.
“Sorry?” asked John again, realizing that was the third time he’d said that in the last thirty seconds.
A server with a tray of champagne flutes passed by and Sherlock plucked the remaining two off the tray, handing one to John.
A gasp erupted from the crowd and then there was absolute silence.  No one moved.  John didn’t think anyone even breathed.  He certainly didn’t.  His heart started pounding as though he’d run up five flights of stairs and he suddenly felt sick to his stomach.
“No,” said John, holding tighter to Sherlock’s arm.  “That can wait five minutes.  Right now, we need to talk, and you need to tell me what the hell all that was.”
“I’m so pleased you decided to stop by this evening but you did give poor Dorothea quite a fright,” said the man as he shook Sherlock's hand.
John reached up and put a hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck pulling them together.  John paused, his hand on Sherlock’s neck, Sherlock leaning over him and he watched Sherlock’s eyes fall shut.  John took a breath and leaned up to press his lips to Sherlock’s.
He lay awake for a while, not in any particular hurry to fall back asleep. The last few days had felt like a fairy tale, like he had stumbled in to a world not his own and at any moment, he could be yanked out of the story and back into his own mundane life.  A moment like this with Sherlock might never come again and he wanted to appreciate the silence and stillness and the feel of Sherlock’s hand at his waist and his hair tickling John’s nose.
John found that he was panting, and his voice was a bit higher and a bit louder than he’d intended it to be.  It seemed to get Sherlock’s attention though because he finally focused his eyes on John’s face.
“George!” he said, cheerfully.  “Would you hold these for us?”  John was surprised to see a smile on Sherlock’s face.
“It wouldn’t be an imposition,” said Violet.  “Hundreds of people will be there, so what’s one more?”
‘Sources close to the Royal Family have reported a noted absence of Prince Sherlock, younger brother of the King, at several events over the past few days,’ John read.  ‘The Christmas season is typically a busy time for the Royal Family with charity appearances, balls, dinners and gatherings.  But Prince Sherlock has been conspicuously absent since appearing at a press conference following the Christmas Ball.  According to our source, who has requested to remain anonymous, this period of reclusion began when the Prince proposed to and then cut ties with one John Watson, a British doctor and ex-soldier.  “The Prince has always had trouble with personal relationships, so it makes sense that he’d take this hard,” said our anonymous source.’
Another place setting was set in the seat nearest Sherlock complete with a cup of steaming tea.  An extravagant amount of food was set out on the buffet table but then, John realized, he did know who else might be joining them.  In fact, the king could come walking in at any minute to grab a coffee and a scone.
The corridor was empty, so John took his moment.  He dug in his heels and pulled Sherlock to a halt.  “Please explain, and it had better be fucking good, what the hell just happened?” he said in an icy, low tone through gritted teeth.
Sherlock was standing in a shadowy corridor, looking out a picture window at the dark and snowy forest.
In the hall outside his room, he came across Mrs Hudson.  “Oh, there you are, dear,” she said, breathlessly.  “Sherlock sent something up for you. I laid it out in your room.”  Then she was off in a rush again.
Sherlock swept up the two champagne flutes before striding out of the room.  “Come on, John,” he called over his shoulder.
John waited for a long moment, his hands-on Sherlock’s shoulders, firm but steady and waiting.  Eventually, Sherlock looked down at him.  “Alright?” asked John.
“It’s already late and it will be at least another forty-five-minute drive to your hotel in this weather.  Longer even.”
As he entered the station, a quick glance at the screen told him a Gatwick train was leaving in two minutes.  He ran forward, people yelling at him as he pressed through the crowds.  He stepped on to the train just as the doors were closing.
Sherlock grabbed the nap of John’s neck and pulled him forward in to a grinding kiss.  John’s neck was bent back uncomfortably and John did not care at all about it.  He grinned into the kiss and wound his free hand that wasn’t being crushed by Sherlock’s, around Sherlock’s back, pulling him even tighter.
John felt a smile split his face, drawn out by the absolute incongruity of the statement.  “Yes, it is.”
When it seemed that Sherlock wasn’t going to break the silence, John cleared his throat.  Sherlock looked at him and set the papers down.
John followed behind Sherlock for another ten minutes.  They crested the top of a hill and, at the base of the hill on the other side, was a cabin.  Well, it was built like a cabin but in reality, could have house four medium sized families comfortably.
“I’m sorry,” said Sherlock.  “You must have had a very dull evening.  I was thinking about a problem and sometimes I get so caught up in my own mind that I forget there are other people around.”
Reassured, he let his mind run wild.  He fell asleep trying to decide what colour he’d describe Sherlock’s eyes as and whether he thought Sherlock’s hands, or his mouth were the more attractive feature.
Sherlock was still asleep, now clinging to John’s back.  John must have rolled again in the night and Sherlock followed him so that they were both on the edge of the bed, pressed together front to back.
John was about to ask Sherlock what he was doing when he felt Sherlock’s fingers intertwine with his own.  “What-?” he started to ask, but Sherlock cut him off.
“Well, thank you,” said John.  They lapsed into silence, their eyes still locked.  John was beginning to feel that magnetic pull that he felt somewhere in his ribcage every time Sherlock looked at him with his undivided attention.
John followed Sherlock upstairs.  By the time John made it up the stairs, Sherlock was already in conversation with a silver haired man.
He slid on to the back of the snowmobile.  Sherlock reached a hand around to grab John’s wrist and pull his arm around Sherlock’s chest.  “Hold on,” he called over the sound of the engine and that was all the warning John got before they were off, tearing through the snow.
“It does though,” said Sherlock.  His voice was quiet when John’s was loud and the difference was infuriating John further.
John blinked, considering the question. “My aunt had cancer when I was young, and my mum went with her to appointments for more support.  She took me to a few of them and I guess, I was always just struck by how the doctor seemed to have all the answers.  Mum and Aunt Karen would have all these questions and be really worried about thing and then the doctor would come in and explain everything and put them at ease.  I just thought that would be nice to be able to do.”
The prince handed John his phone.  “You’re alone in a foreign country and the family is hosting an informal gathering tonight.  They are dreadfully dull, but I imagine better than the hotel room service you plan to order tonight.”  He was moving around the large kitchen now, pulling on a long, black coat and wrapping a blue scarf, that seemed to have been handpicked to bring out his eyes, around his neck.
Matilda looked about ready to open her mouth when Mycroft spoke over her.  “Very nice.  Matilda will appreciate these.”  Matilda shut her mouth and nodded, smiling.
“Excellent,” said Sherlock, grinning again.  He leapt out of the car and started bounding for the door.  John moved to follow him and then noticed that he didn’t have his cane.  He looked around the floor of the car, thinking maybe he’d set it down without realizing.
“He was spotted dumping a pink suitcase in a tip behind a restaurant.  The owner thought it was suspicious so she called the police and they turned up immediately and arrested him.  Boring.”
“Yes,” said the man with a flat, shiny face and small glasses.  “I did a little research in to him.  British army doctor. Newly returned to civilian life.  Here on holiday only.”  His voice had a lilting accent that made his words that much more insidious.
“That’s not necessary,” said the King in an oily voice.  His voice was higher than his brother’s and, though he spoke softly, he had a presence that could clearly command the room if he needed to.  “Sit down, John.”
The waitress handed them both menus.  “I’ll just let Angelo know you’re here,” she said.  “And let me know if you need anything.  Your Majesty.”
John couldn’t handle it any longer.  Did every single person in this room automatically think the worst of Sherlock?  He stepped around the tree and the two men turned to face him.  John would have laughed at their expressions if he hadn’t been so furious.
“Sherlock,” said John but he just kept going.  “Sherlock,” he repeated more insistently.  “Do we have time for this? As much as I’m loathed to ask this, don’t we have to get out of bed at some point and join you’re family?”
There was also a large painting above the fire of a kind looking older man.  John recognized him as the previous king from the paintings he’d seen on his tour.  But this picture showed him seated in a comfortable chair with a stack of books and a dog on his lap.  It had clearly been intended for the family to remember him as they had known him and not as the monarch his people knew him as.
John reached for his phone and opened his texts without thinking.  Then he realized that he’d never actually texted with Sherlock, so he went to his contacts to find the entry Sherlock had made there.
I know I said this a few chapters ago but only two or three chapters to go from here!  I'm on track to finish before the end of the 12 Days of Christmas.
He reached out a hand and gently touched Sherlock’s fingertips.  The moment his skin made contact; Sherlock grasped his hand tight.
“There was a murder at the ball.  He nearly poisoned both you and me.  But he’s in custody now and- “
“For what?” asked John and he was suddenly extremely aware of the very small amount of space between them.  His brain started, unhelpfully, calculating how far he would have to move and the angle he would have to tilt to press his lips to Sherlocks.
John entered a small dining room, or at least what John took to be small for the palace.  The table looked like it could seat about twelve.  Sherlock was seated at the head of the table and was perusing a stack of newspapers while he picked at a piece of toast.
John ignored them all.  He was scanning the room for one face.  But before he could find Sherlock, Violet approached him.
The anger that had been bristling along John’s neck suddenly broke free.  He stepped between Sherlock and Simon.  “Don’t you know you shouldn’t comment about things you don’t understand?” he asked, smiling the smile that didn’t reach his eyes but left them cold and glaring.
John turned again, reaching for his phone while Sherlock moved on to pressing kisses into John’s shoulder blades.
John looked around the room and then followed Sherlock.  They wound through the back passages and stairways of the palace until they emerged in the families private quarters.  Sherlock continued tearing through corridors with John on his heels until he arrived a large oak door.  He quickly unlocked it and threw it open.
Sherlock was already out the door, but he leaned back in to the room.  “Just asked for Sherlock,” he said.  And then he was gone in a swirl of black coat.
The silver haired man stuck out his hand in John’s path before he could follow Sherlock.  “DI Greg Lestrade,” he said.  “How’d you end up with this one, then?”
In a flurry of movement, Sherlock rolled to his side, wrapping his arms and legs around John and burying his nose in John’s neck.  “Is this ok?” he asked, his voice muffled by John’s shoulders.
“Surely an army man can tough it out for one night in the palace,” said Sherlock, raising an eyebrow.
Sherlock pulled a small card out of an inner pocket and placed it on the table.  It was pink with darker pink letters spelling out the name Jennifer Wilson.
When John entered, he was greeted with a cheerful “Merry Christmas” from Violet who handed him a plate of Cinnamon rolls and directed him to sit on the sofa.  Sherlock came in a few minutes later and sat about as far away from John as he could while still sitting on the same sofa.
John smiled uncomfortably.  “It’s not like that,” he said.  “I mean, we only just met yesterday.  And he does seem nice and he’s very clever, but as I say, we only just met.”
Suddenly, John felt the urge to punch Sherlock in the nose. Why was he holding John here yet keeping him at arm’s length?  If he wanted John to leave, if he wanted to pretend the last few days hadn’t happen, then why was he making it more difficult for John to go?
They passed several other guests with their attendant footmen.  Several of them stared as he passed.  John did his best to smile and nod unconcernedly at each one though each time it happened he became more and more concerned that he was getting into a situation that he really didn’t belong in.
As Mycroft enumerated the royal families many good deeds throughout the year, photos and videos of the family meeting with everyday Aldovian citizens flashed across the screen.  In most of these, Sherlock was standing, bored, in the back of the group.  But in one video of Mycroft meeting with a group of police officers, Sherlock was in the background, clearing investigating something in an evidence bag as two police officers stood by.
The whole group laughed at that and the sound sent a surge of anger through John.  He took two deep breaths and moved away from the group, instead of getting right in the smarmy, dark haired man’s face and telling exactly how much Sherlock had done in that case and exactly how amazing he’d been.
“Go back to sleep, John” said Sherlock after a few minutes.  His voice was a velvety whisper than wrapped around John more thoroughly than the silence had.  “It’s still dark.  You can relax.”  Sherlock slid his hand up to John’s back, rubbing up and down his spine before pulling him in tight so their bodies were nearly flushed together.  Then he let go and curled in as tightly as he could to John.
After what seemed like miles of corridors, Sherlock finally stopped and opened a door to a room.  He stepped inside and flipped on the light.
“Wait! Hold that cab!”  John turned and saw Sherlock running out of the main doors of the palace, his coat fanning out behind him and tying his scarf as he went.
John felt an enormous sense of relief when they arrived in his room, though he was surprised to find that he thought of it as his room.  There was a small card on the accent table by the door with the palace logo on the outside.  Inside, there was a note from Sherlock which read, ‘John, The dress code for the evening is casual so a nice jumper should suffice.  I’ll come by your room around 8pm.  It is typically prudent to eat before these events, so I’ve asked Mrs Hudson to send you up a sandwich. -S of A’.
Of course, people are are going to talk about the proposal and of course, the press is going to want to know more about it.
John hesitated before lifting the woman’s hair.  Sherlock looked up at him then and gave him a little encouraging smile and nod.  John lifted the woman's hair and inspected her face, mouth, neck and hands and even went so far as to lean down and sniff her breath.
John wrapped his arms tight around Sherlock and slid forward as far as he could.  The more inappropriate connotations of this position were in the forefront of his mind, but it seemed that Sherlock was the only secure point in the moving, swirling darkness.
Ten minutes later, as John lay in an incredibly soft bed, his half-asleep mind kept replaying images of Sherlock’s face, his hands, his smile, his eyes.  At first, he tried to force them away.  It felt like overstepping some sort of boundary to be thinking about this man, who he just met that morning, as he fell asleep.  He quickly gave it up as a lost cause.  What did it matter anyway?  He would maybe see the prince in the morning and then he’d be back to his hotel and back to England in a few days’ time and he’d never see him again.
Sherlock was standing in front of a floor length window, a violin under his chin.  His back was to the door and John thought about making a noise or alerting Sherlock to his presence, but he cut such a striking figure that John leaned against the doorjamb to watch instead.  Sherlock was playing ‘In the Deep Midwinter’ and the haunting melody flowed from his fingers with such feeling that John was transfixed.  When Sherlock lowered the bow, John nearly broke into applause.
“Of course not,” said Mycroft who was standing in the doorway, having just entered the room.  He closed the door softly behind him.  “This man is Martin Tregennis.  Sherlock assisted in the arrest of his brother, Mortimer, several years ago.  Mortimer was accused of killing his fiancé if I remember correctly.”
John stood too and reached out to take Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock stopped talking and looked down at him.
“It was worth it,” said the man, tied to the chair.  “You would have deserved it and so much the better if someone you cared about got hurt too.”
Sherlock’s iron grip wrapped around John’s arm.  “Come on,” he hissed into John’s ear.  He pulled John through the doorway into a circular room with a small stage at one end.  They took a seat and the choir filed on to the stage.
John looked over his shoulder to see an older woman in a deep purple dress.  She inclined her head at Sherlock, in what could be described as an obeisance if you squinted.  Or it could just have been an acknowledgement.  “Breakfast is all laid out for you, dear,” she said.  “And I had the chef send up tea along with your coffee for your special friend.  Since he’s English.”
John goes to the Christmas party and gets quite a surprise.  And there's a murderer! John, it's Christmas!
Happy New Years!  Here's the last chapter of 2020! Never fear, the next chapter is done and ready to go up tomorrow
On Christmas Eve morning, John left the palace to retrieve his things from the hotel.  He, at Sherlock’s insistence, would be checking out of the hotel and staying at the palace for the remainder of his trip.  His flight left early in the morning the day after Boxing Day anyway.
The footman walked off quickly, and John had to follow him or be left standing stupidly in the entrance hall.  John walked up the stairs and through the winding corridors that he thought he’d never see again.  The footman stopped in front of a door and behind it, there seemed to be a party of at least fifty people.  John could hear talking, laughter and the sound of clinking glasses.  He felt frozen to the spot, his heart hammering in his chest.  He looked at the footman.
“Not today, Donavan,” said Sherlock, lifting the tape for John and then leading him in to the house.
“I can tell after just a few moments in your presence that Sherlock is infinitely the better man between the two of you.”
“Whiskey?” asked Sherlock.  He went to the drinks cart without waiting for a response and poured a glass.  Then he took a seat on the sofa, indicating that John should sit as well, and handed him the drink.
“It seems that Sherlock has a new friend.” John peaked around the tree and saw two older men talking to each other.
John filled his plate and sat down at the table.  It was actually rather cosy, despite the grandeur of the room.  John took a sip of his tea and grimaced.  It tasted like it had about three tablespoons of sugar in it.
John pulled off his clothes and crawled under the covers.  The last thing he saw before he closed his eyes was a poster of the period table of elements hanging on the wall.
