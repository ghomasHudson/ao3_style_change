“I do no—”
“So, the itinerary says ‘see sights and crap’ which is helpfully vague, Dean.” Sam grumbles, trying and failing not to get the sheet wet. He stuffs it back in his inside pocket.
“What the
“The first and only time you will hear Sam encouraging you to join me in bed.” Cas says wryly.
Cas lets go of his shoulder, and Dean forces himself not to mourn the loss of contact.
“Everyone has their coping mechanisms, Charlie.”
“Sam said bacon, bacon fights back. I’m not getting near it.” Cas mumbles from behind his mug.
“Dean, at least tell him—”
So Dean has to ice Cas out entirely. Ignore his crestfallen little expressions, almost instantly masked, and the way he becomes more irritable and taciturn as the day goes by.
“Oh.”
What is there to say? He’s fucked this up, fucked it up so royally that Cas is going to go. Dean’s driven him away and now he’s juiced up he’s gonna go back to heaven and probably rule it at Hannah’s side like he was supposed to, like he would have if Dean hadn’t dragged him away.
Dean rolls his eyes, fights to get out of Sam’s grip and fails.
“Just, just lemme know. ‘Kay.
“Nope still here, not for Cas’s lack of trying though.”
“Yes?”
Cas twigs what’s happening just as Lucifer stands and meanders into the trees, towards a secluded spot, whistling and merry.
He interrupts.
Sam digs the knife in, levers out a chunk of enochian branded flesh. He thinks he sees faint blue sparks coalesce around the wound, but maybe he imagines it.
“Charlie would never forgive us if one of us didn’t order the Game of Thrones cocktail.” Sam adds.
“Neither will you! That’s just to get that grace out of your arm for the blueprint. There wouldn’t even be enough souls left to bring him back. At best you’d get a brain dead human – at worst you’d get some kind of feral angelic monster with no higher function but all the smiting powers it could ask for.”
The demon nods jerkily, it’s hard when there’s an angel letting burning grace scrape at your throat.
Cas nearly smacks him with the cue, instead diverts his entire attention to the table, calculating. He’s always been a tactician; he should be able to manage this.
Completely forgot to say - the reason this chapter is nearly double the normal length is because I'm not going to have wifi for the rest of the week, so there will be no new chapter on 31/03.
“It looks better close up.” He yells back.
“Yes.” Dean says, and even Sam, who’d been trying very hard to ignore them and read his goddamn book, starts laughing.
Any other time Cas might have been on his side, but right now he’s glad of the distraction. Idle time doesn’t treat him well. He’d been staring out of the window, telling himself he was looking at passing cars, admiring the houses and the sweeping landscape.
Dean thinks this is okay, wants it even. As irretrievably, heartbreakingly tainted as this is for Cas, this will be a good memory for Dean, even if probably only temporarily.
Just because in his hand is where he usually manifests his angel blade, doesn’t mean it’s the only place that he can.
“There’s only so long anyone could stand to be in a windowless house with Sam’s farts. We’d be out or suffocated within two days.”
Leaving Dean on his own with just Cas and his addiction – taking every backslide and lack of progress like a personal slight. That’s not going to help anyone.
He only makes it halfway through the last bottle before what he’s doing catches up to his rational mind. The liquid turns suddenly in his stomach and he can taste bile on his tongue and he knows he only has moments to get to the sink before he throws up.
“I don’t expect you to leave just to make me feel comfortable, Sam.”
started to rub off on him – before it ruined him.
“Rowena has this under control. She’s confident enough that she feels she can sleep for 10 hours before she even attempts the problem. You’ve been granted a reprieve – take it.”
When he comes back to them, he comes back violently. Sam is asleep in another room. Cas has Dean tucked up in their shared bed. He’s curled into him, head resting against Dean’s chest so that he can hear his heartbeat, make sure it's still there. It’s been two days and they haven’t tried to wake him again. Not after that bloodcurdling scream and the subsequent collapse. They just have to trust to him to come back to them in his own time. It’s his speciality. He always goes bloody, but he always comes back to them, too.
“Do I look like fucking TripAdvisor to you? Just drive until you find something.”
doesn’t break.
“I don’t know.”
this time.”
Almost everything he’s ever done or made has been valuable for it’s use. He thinks he’d rather like to nurture something beautiful for a change. Something ornamental and with no real use, but still valuable.
He looks up, startled, confused. What is he doing?
Sam dashes over, enfolds him in a bonecrusher of a hug.
Cas’s grip in his hair goes white knuckled and he starts making abortive little twitching thrusts. Dean relaxes his grip, allows Cas to move just a little bit at first, and then rougher as he eases into it, gets used to it. He trusts Cas, knows there’s no way on earth he’d hurt him, even accidentally during sex.
Dean doesn’t reply.
“Cas, lemme go.”
“It’s fine, Cas,”
Dean sighs. “He wants this too, trust me.”
“Yeah?”
“I am the King’s mother!”
Dean laughs. “Okay, okay. Am I actually carrying you, though, or are we just turning back?”
“And that’s why Dean is being strange?”
“The body I’ve ended up in is white and male, so am I to guess this is about the third one?”
Dean tries to voice these thoughts aloud, stumbles and trips over his own tongue, “Sam wouldn’t I – no. He couldn’t have.”
“I don’t know – maybe he touched a cursed object-”
“So,” she says, flipping through the Netflix menu. “Airplane?”
‘Where are you, you stupid fucking bastard?” He mutters.
“No.” Lucifer says, forcing a fond smile onto his face, doing his best not to gag at the mawkish affection “
“Hey, we’re not here to hurt you.”
“Yeah, it could have.” Dean agrees.
“Better.”
, Dean.” A little pause for emphasis there, just to make sure the message slips in amongst the drunken fervour. Sure, it was Castiel I was hurting, but I was doing it to get to you. This is your fault.
He comes out of the room to find Dean and Cas sitting on the sofa. They’re as shabbily dressed as he is, so at least if they make a bad impression, they’re going to make it en-masse.
“What happened?”
Cas grabs the one closest to him, pulls her up with a little more effort than he’s used to. He feels his muscles twitch and protest, groan a little at the strain, but they don’t fail. He hacks her head off with a clean blow, hears Dean shout out a triumphant whoop. He can’t do much to help the fight up there – the scuffling too close to risk a shot – but he makes up for that by shouting, adding to the noise and pandemonium as he carries on peeling back the corrugated roof to expose the nest to more sunlight. It’s not the most glamorous job, but it helps, and perversely it’s probably more dangerous – no way in hell he’d let Sam or newly human Cas scramble over lichen slippery rooftops and risk a plummet to the death.
“No.” Dean’s tone is absolute.
“Of course there is.” Cas sighs.
“How the fuck should I know? When you fucking nut up and apologise, maybe.”
He presses a soft kiss to Dean’s lips, disentangles himself from the bed.
“Yeah, but… here? Really?”
Cas moans, and Dean thinks he’s won, but then then his expression flips, too quickly for the noise to have been genuine. Cas snorts, one eyebrow raised, and pointedly removes Dean’s hands from where they’d been wandering.
“Nothing!”
“Will we? ‘Cause Dean, I’m not trying to be unkind, but it’s been months and the trail has gone cold. There’s not a single fucking sign of him anywhere.”
If Dean’d just frozen in panic that would have been one thing, but no. He fucking made it worse. And what if it’s not the first time. What if Sam’s right, and all the little allowances and things Dean’s been doing have just been making things worse. What if letting him eat junk food and beer is fucking him up, what if not pushing him to open up is making it all fester inside and get worse. What if, what if, what if.
Cas jolts, looks at Dean – still flighty, still almost feral. He looks like he’s been through the mental wringer, and Dean’s in two minds about whether he’ll ever ask him about that. He can make a decent enough pass at putting it together himself – experience speaks, a  folded trench coat dredged from the water and passed from car to car, never touched too long ‘cause it reeked of oil and damp no matter how many times it got washed – whatever Cas’s equivalent version is probably better dead and buried, or at least repressed.
all of purgatory on earth? What’s the point in being a demon if there are no humans left to torture!”
“Knock us out.”
“What?”
“I’m sorry.”
Dean covers his very real fear – at the idea of Cas weak and helpless and away from them – with a joke. Sam gives it the mostly mirthless snort of acknowledgement that it deserves, and then carries on thinking aloud.
“What in the hell is wrong with you, Dean?”
They settle down at the table and Dean plonks a heap of paper down, takes a sheet and looks at Cas expectantly.
“Yeah, I was pretty surprised when I saw you throwing it up.”
“What’s up?”
He’s fighting hard not to be worried. Rowena isn’t, she seems almost gleeful, and Sam isn’t sure whether he’s finding that reassuring or it’s swinging him the other way. He doesn’t know which end of the spectrum she sits on – for them or against them, because let’s face it, they’ve never been good with nuance. The categories have never really been monster or good guy. It’s always been Winchester or not.
“I, just, uh…” Dean trails off, clearly hoping Cas will step in and rescue him. He doesn’t.
“What the fuck?”
Lucifer hums in smug satisfaction, turns back to Dean. He pretends to comfort him, all the time pushing buttons he knows will only serve to further rile him up.
“Maybe I don’t want help.”
He gathers himself, sits up and catches Cas’s eye.
“I was thinking somewhere by the ocean. I’ve always wanted to kick back on a beach, relax properly, not just take a quick break between hunts.” Dean volume rises with his enthusiasm.
He bites down on his tongue so hard it brings tears to his eyes, and that’s it, like the first trickle of snow that wakes the avalanche, he’s sobbing uncontrollably. The urge to lash out at Dean gutters and dies and that’s one small mercy to the fact that he’s crying and he can’t seem to make it stop.
He doesn’t want to ruin the moment.
“If I blindfold you, are you gonna freak out?” Dean asks, far too casually for anyone to ever utter those words.
Dean walks away from Jack – from God. And as he does, his skin prickles, pins and needles, a full body rebellion that screams ASK HIM.
“You understand why I ask.”
“What happened?” He croaks, barely able to get the words out in disconnected panic. “What did he do to you?”
“Okay.” Sam says. “Maybe it is weakness. Maybe at the present moment in time you’re physically weak. So fucking what? You spent three months being forcibly shot up and barely fed. No-one expects you to be running goddamn marathons. I don’t care, neither does Dean, we just want to help you.”
“Yeah, sure.” Dean says. “Sweet or salted?”
Despite this, and the slapstick potential of all that mud, they make it to the clearing without incident. There’s a motley crew there to greet them – humans, a benevolent werewolf or two, a handful of angels watching with a sad, bemused sort of fascination as they pay respect in the human way to one of their brethren.
And he thought fucking torture was gonna be the worst of his problems.
He shrugs, mumbles like the emotionally constipated Winchester he is. He’s better than Dean, doesn’t mean he’s anything approaching normal, healthy people levels.
“Something like that.” Dean says, too sharply.
“Come on Sam, who is she? This girl who’s more important to you than the goddamn apocalypse?”
Whatever, he has options. He bites the inside of his cheek, sticks his finger in as if to niggle at a tooth and wets it with blood. He's gotta make this quick, or she'll get suspicious.
“Make sure he doesn’t wake up.” Lucifer tells the demon.
Yeah, okay. Serious business.
“I’m still not convinced, but Hannah thinks I should tell you what’s going on.” Dean snaps.
He looks at his watch, sighs. No wonder Sam was up and looking so bright and refreshed. It’s a little after the bastard's usual getting up time – or fucking ass o’clock in the morning as it’s known by everyone sane in the goddamn bunker. Figures. Dean’s just being a toddler about this because he’s tired. Not because he’s a bad person.
Cas holds the smoke in for longer than either Dean or Sam expected, they were fully prepared to watch him hack it all back up in truly embarrassing fashion. Instead he lets out a little trickle from his lips.
And boy, does Cas talk. Although he wasn’t an angel of creation like some, Hael, Sariel, Zophiel or a hundred others, he still had the basics programmed into his grace. As an angel he knew more than most humans about the fauna and makeup of the planet they live on. Now, as a human, he’s forgetting a lot of it. But he still knows enough to entertain Dean as they trek beneath the leaves.
Hannah sighs.
The dragon is finished, and it’s turned out beautifully.
“You can do that?” Sam asks.
“He said he hadn’t reaped him, but that he might soon.”
“So what, then?”
“Yeah, yeah, can’t let your brother know about your secret girlfriend.”
“No, I didn’t change any of the terms while you were out. I’m not a fucking demon.”
Dean closes the door with a soft click, makes his way down the corridor. He pauses momentarily when he crosses the door that’ll lead him towards the gym but shakes his head and carries on. Sure, it might tire him out, but at what cost? He’s not Sam, he doesn’t enjoy exercise – only does the bare minimum that’ll keep him in hunting shape. And anyway, his fighting style has always been more about cunning than brute force, so his lifestyle keeps him comfortably on form enough that he doesn’t have to bother with the extra nonsense.
“Cas?” Dean rasps, wary, uncertain.
“Look, um. I looked up online, what you’re supposed to do.”
He rolls his eyes, quickens his pace for a moment, just to watch Charlie’s shorter legs struggle.
“You’re a terrible witch, darling. Botching the spell, understandable, if not excusable. There were unknown factors, I grant. You couldn’t be expected to know that Dean’s Winchester’s soul was claimed so many ways, that you were allowing one very dormant part a foothold.
Cas does hear, looks up, face unreadable.
Dean can’t help the soft, broken noise that escapes him at that, just hopes it didn’t travel down the phone to Sam’s end.
“Sam, the guy nearly killed himself – accidentally or otherwise – because I made him feel so guilty about something that wasn’t his fault. I get it.”
Sam lifts the phone back to his ear, addresses Dean.
A snide little voice pops up, but he’s long acquainted with the voice, and he’s getting very good at just punching the fucker back down where it belongs.
. There’s only a few left to download – they all should have taken hours. How did you even get this place hooked up - do you have fibre, or copper, or what?”
“There you go. All you needed was a bit of a yell.”
“Really? But you haven’t eaten for hours. Do you have a temperature – it could be fever?”
“No.”
“What?”
Dean looks up from the bed, doesn’t need to ask what Cas means by ‘this’.
“Contracts like that, they take a lot of doing – not just any demon can write them.”
“From left to right, that’s the Ardbeg 10, the Laphroaig 10, and finally, the Lagavulin 16. Enjoy your drinks.”
“No. I think the Knight came here looking for Lucifer. It’d explain why the door was ripped off its hinges. Sam has a key, he wouldn’t need to force entry. ” Dean winces, but Cas doesn’t seem to notice, carries on “And none of the books here contain knowledge that could harm the devil, he wouldn’t be threatened by this, wouldn’t feel the need to destroy it.”
“What’s the end?” Sam asks, confused.
“Yeah, he doesn’t care so much he’s fucking PTSD staring at the wall.”
He’s underestimating just how furious Cas is. He manifests his angel blade, lunges to stab Crowley, is only stopped by Dean.
“Gimme five to make myself human, then we’ll get on it.”
“I can’t explain it over the phone—”
“Go about it as you would any normal hunt.”
“How do we even know you are Druiel? I’ve been stung by that before.”
“Yet another weapon for the host to deal with. If these fell into demonic hands…” She pauses, considering. “I will allow you to use these, this time, but they must be destroyed, along with all record of that sigil, once the hunt is over.”
“I’m not gonna crash it, shut your face hole.”
“Heal Dean.” Charlie commands.
Dean has Charlie in a grapple hold – mortal combat 101, because even though it hurts so badly he thinks he might pass out, physical activity helps tone down the cravings, because he fucking loves her and doesn’t want her to die if he can help it, because it’s something to fucking do – when her phone and laptop begin to shriek with an unbearable sound.
“And then some. So, you gonna help me, or what?”
“Oh god, we made a mistake. Take me back in, I’ll do anything.” Sam begs Dean.
“Oh thank god, I was worried you’d appear in proportional size.” Dean wheezes.
to the kitchen with a fucking sigil burned into his back, one that I had to cut out piece by piece to break its power. But even in that state, he tried to fight me, made me prove I wasn’t a shifter or monster. Made sure that neither of us were in danger, before he even thought about helping himself.
“There are approximately 13 angels on earth unaccounted for who can possess that bloodline.”
Cas flinches in pain, heart rate spiking but he tries to mask it, kisses Dean harder, hands dropping to his belt in a futile and desperate attempt to distract him.
Eventually Dean seems to realise that they’ve only got a limited amount of time before the “demon” gets to Sam and warns him, and he stops asking stupid questions and starts to make haste.
“Yeah.”
Great, another fucking video. But he can’t exactly walk out now. So he watches, and then, because he sat through the tedium, he figures what the hell, he might as well do the rest too.
“I did not—”
Dean sighs, the hand near Cas’s twitching with the urge to comfort him physically. That’s what Dean does best, not the words and the emotional comfort. It’s always a struggle to get the right words out at the right time.
They re-dress quickly. Dean makes to walk back to the car but Cas stops him.
He doesn’t cry.
Sam is only a little way up the road when Dean spots him. He’s walking slow, unhurried and casual, like he doesn’t have a care in the world. Doesn’t even check behind him – and while Dean’s grateful because it makes him easier to follow, he’s also fucking pissed off. He taught Sam better than that – it’s like he wants to get himself killed.
He won’t be over it. He’ll deal with it, though, in the way that he does. He’s Dean Winchester and there isn’t anything he can’t repress. He’s had a fucking lifetime to practice it.
“I dunno, Dean. Maybe he just wanted to get a little space, clear his head. For all we know he’s on his way back to the bunker as we speak.”
“Every time I try and help, I make it worse.”
“Yeah.”
Cas screams out in agony, made worse somehow because he doesn’t have a mouth to voice it, just echoing inside his head.
Sam sighs.
A red marker pen appears in Cas’s hand, and he traces, carefully, painstakingly, around the outline of the tree. He jots down the date and time in a notebook that appears by his leg.
“Yeah, no. I get that.” He rubs at his chin with the heel of his palm, and Cas knows what that means. It means he’s tired and frustrated and blaming himself for something meaty.
“For my delightful company?” Crowley sneers back.
“It’d be better if you died, and you know it. Dean would be free, and Sam, and the other one. But you won’t. You’re a coward – only ever thinking of yourself.” Cahor spits the last word, and Cas flinches violently.
Cas takes in a deep juddering breath, opens his eyes and looks around, manic, scared. He’s got a hunted look about him, and it’s really fucking familiar to Sam. It’s the same look Dean used to have on him in the months after purgatory, suspicious of the switch from having spent a year looking over his shoulder all the time to relative calm. Wired from being pulled back to that world in his nightmares and waking up thinking he’s still there.
Dean gets up, pulls on some boxers and goes exploring.
They sandwich Dean on either side, Cas pulling him in as tight as possible, trying to envelop him, smother him so he doesn’t have to deal with the outside world, while Sam just sits, a solid, familiar presence at his side.
He retrieves the lube bottle from his pocket, squirts it silently onto one hand without Dean noticing. He’s too distracted by Cas’s skilled mouth and tongue, working him over, biting at his lip and tugging, doing all the things he knows Dean loves and sending sparks coursing down to his poor, neglected cock.
He caresses it, delighting in the soft sigh Cas lets out under him, massaging the taught, firm flesh. Damn he has a fucking nice ass. Dean can’t wait to properly explore it, taste it, thrust his tongue into Cas’s hole and eat him out until he’s begging to be fucked. He can’t wait for Cas to do the same, either. Remembers his words from the car, wants to feel those long, thin fingers split him open, wants to ride that big, fat cock.
He turns his back on Crowley, picks up the contract and reads it through as quickly as he can. It all looks kosher, as far as he can tell. Crowley doesn’t seem to be lying about the cost to hell, but to be honest, a billion demons going pop. It’s not gonna weigh too heavy on Dean’s conscience.
Pontiac, Illinois, ending where it all began, wrapped up all neat, and clean, and tidy.
“Mm. Less a love affair more a tactic to avoid being told off for avoiding my exercise regime.”
“Thanks.” Dean sighs out.
“It’s not
Dean stops the car beside him, waits until he stretches out his hand to grab the handle, and rolls the car forwards. Cas jogs after them and Dean keeps on rolling the car, just out of his reach every single time. And then Cas narrows his eyes, puts on a surprising burst of speed and throws himself into the vehicle before Dean can take off.
Hannah doesn’t roll her eyes, because she is an angel, and dignified in the face of the enemy, but she can feel Caroline trying to.
“But—”
Sam slams his eyes shut, the glow seared on his retinas for probably the rest of his life. He waits until the heat fades, until he can’t feel the light battering at him, and then he opens his eyes.
“Dean. Are you in here?”
“Shit, yeah. Maybe it’d be better if we dragged—”
“I assume you have lube?” Cas asks.
As Sam drives, he thinks. Dangerous thing for a Winchester to be doing, as Dean has told him many times. He can’t help it, though. He and Dean both have a tendency to overthink things, but Dean’s is more directed inward, with his tendency to act first and then castigate himself for it for weeks. Sam’s is more directed outward – pushing him forward into thinking that he has all the solutions.
Sam doesn’t say.
Cas doesn’t read the blurb, doesn’t need to. He dimly remembers this from Metatron’s pop culture injection. He could briefly outline the plot for you, but he hasn’t held onto much of the detail. It’ll be the human equivalent of rereading a book you first read during your childhood, and he’s already burning up with anticipation to start.
“It’s just, y’know...” He trails off lamely, hoping Cas will let him get away with it. Of course he doesn’t, though.
Sam puts it all together quickly enough.
After what feels like hours of puttering around, she finally hands over the keys.
“Just... start from the beginning.”
He sidles up beside Cas, mutters to him.
God, he must hate Dean so, so much, if he can’t even bear to stay in here. The fucking lump in Dean’s throat is swelling up and he needs to get out of there before he throws up, or starts to cry, or fucking both.
Cas nods, already looking a little less pale.
(See the end of the chapter for
Well he does, and it’s not fucking helping
doesn’t matter.
Cas sits down at the table, waits until everyone else has joined him before spreading the folder out so Dean and Charlie can see. He doesn’t make allowances for Sam, sat opposite them and therefore looking at the contents upside down. He has an awful, sinking feeling that he knows what he’s going to find over the page, and what’s going to follow because of it. Any momentary advantage he has over Sam to school his thoughts, he’ll take.
If Dean wants to whoop every time he lets loose a shot, he’s goddamn gonna.
Dean groans. He’s a terrible fucking person and he’s putting Cas through shit situation after shit situation.
It catches him off guard, and the words are out before he can vet them.
“Uh, why?”
When Cas eventually pulls himself back to something approaching normal he looks up at Dean, crouching in front of him and doing a very bad job of hiding his terror, and apologises with a lopsided smile.
“Don’t beat yourself up. He’s Dean Winchester. He always gets the girl.”
“You...you shut your face hole.”
And he wants to laugh at his own wording, because 'normal visit'. Like it's something casual, a fucking sunday afternoon stroll in the murder woods of Dean's nightmares.
“Well, he’s never lost someone like Cas before, has he.” She points out mildly. ‘Cause Dean’s lost every single kind of friend and family it’s possible to have, but apart from Lisa, he’s never really had a significant other to lose. And now he’s lost Cas, and not in normal circumstances. In the worst way he could.
Sam’s legs give way and he collapses onto the bed next to Dean, who flinches away from the touch.
“Don’t call him that, for the love of God.”
about you?”
“That’s mine.”
The apparent subject change doesn’t fool Cas. He knows exactly who is praying to him, can feel Dean’s presence like an itch in his bones. It’s been there for so long he almost doesn’t notice it anymore. Only when it spikes – times when he assumes Dean is more in danger than usual, could use angelic healing or strength.
He spits on the guy just for good measure, lifts his wallet from his inside pocket. Tar doesn’t need the money, he’s fucking loaded – rich young kid, from a rich family – it’s about the trophy. And this’ll be a fucking great story to tell the guys at school.
“It would be preferable.”
“Great, well I’ll go make sure he isn’t collapsed dead in some corner and then I’m gonna go shower for a week to get the smell of Sam’s chilli farts off me.”
“No. We argued, I stormed off.” He leaves out the rest, but Charlie isn’t stupid. She saw Sam come flying panicked into the room yesterday, saw him apologise and beg Dean to calm Cas down.
And anyway, if he lets go of Dean’s he’s going to wake up, and he’ll do it alone, remember that he and Cas have been fighting and, if the previous indication is anything to go by, likely panic and/or do something stupid.
“Correct, my friend. So this is the bunker,” she points to a great big red x, just for idiotproofing purposes, “and these are the three locations.” She indicates three circles. One pretty close by, but the others much more considerable of a walk away. “I’m pretty sure these are accurate – you would not believe the ballache I had trying to work it out. Either the Men of Letters were not a fan of GPS co-ordinates or they just assumed it’d be so obvious why bother writing it down. I had to spend an hour fucking about with maps and light tables.”
Sam’s skin feels cool to Dean’s touch, but not much colder than it should be. Any anyway, Dean’s just been cooking, of course he’s gonna be warmer. It doesn’t mean anything. None of this does.
“So I just let him, what?”
Once the collar is discarded he moves to the clothes – peels off the dirty, reeking trench coat, the stained pants and ragged dress shirt. The trench coat isn’t Cas’s original – slightly different shape, slightly different colour. Close enough for the similarities to be deliberate though. Another taunt, he assumes. A great big middle finger to them all.
“They won’t be happy to see you.”
Dean opens his eyes, sees the two fingers waiting by his lips and flushes red. He leans forwards and wraps his tongue around them, working them like he would a cock with a little groan.
Lucifer lays it on pretty thick, capitalises on the swell of sad disappointment Cas feels when Dean shit talks himself and lets it play out in his tone.
Cas groans, long and low. He and Sam were friends. Good friends. That he should die in agony – that he should die believing it’s at Cas’s hand. It cuts so deep he almost doesn’t feel it. A numb, dull ache that will inevitably solidify into something so much more as Lucifer taunts and teases and wrings every bitter drop of joy he can from this.
“They have free healthcare up there.” Cas mumbles into Dean’s chest.
“Have you been awake all this time, Sam?” Cas interrupts, because of course he couldn’t just do what Dean said and stay in the room, leave him be. He knows Dean’s first instinct is to stew in his own juices and he’s got it into his head that this is A Bad Thing and therefore can sometimes tend towards being a right annoying clingy fucker. Which, if Dean wasn’t still deciding whether to be really fucking pissed off with him, he would admit is probably a good thing.
He might have expected Cas to be a little nervy about this – out in the open, under the trees where shadows could hide anything, trick the eye. There’s no sign of that, though. He looks every bit as comfortable as he does shuffling through the bunker’s halls. Dean doesn’t want to say anything in case it’s only because Cas isn’t thinking about it, and suddenly the moment is broken and everything is ruined.
“There’s something else.”
“We’ve been saving people for
Cas trails light fingers over Dean’s ribs, renders him unconscious.
He lays Cas out on the backseat, kneels there beside him, strokes a hand through his hair and presses their foreheads together. He stays there for a long time, trying to make himself stand, force out the words that are setting in his throat like concrete.
“That’s the strange thing.” Cas huffs. “Sam swears he hasn’t replenished the supply once, yet every day I take paper out of it, and the next day there’s the exact same amount as there was when I first opened it.”
“I thought you only watched Dr Sexy for the “hot nurses”, Dean?” Sam scoffs. “I didn’t realise you were just that big a fan of campy medical dramas.”
He scoots up the tub, wipes his hands on the side to take off the excess moisture and picks up the book.
“Weird.” Dean says, he’s usually pretty good at answering.”
She’s always taking away his choice, even in the smallest, most menial of ways.
But, well, as much as he loves a good, rough fuck, sometimes he wants something else. Something more.
Stranger things have happened, but not many.
“Fuck off.” Dean mumbles.
“And you just happened to come to this angelic rebel conclusion all by yourself did you?” Dean sneers.
Cas backs away, back to his and Dean’s room. His head is spinning and he doesn’t now how much is from the exertion and how much is from what he just heard. He knows enough to piece together what happened – can see the facts reaching out in front of him like stepping stones to a distant shore. Dean found out about one tiny, tiny fucking part of what happened to Cas while he was kidnapped and he drunk himself into a fury and exposed himself to Cahor – attacked him, judging by all the blood.
He turns his back on Cahor, practically runs out of the room – doesn’t even hear the laughter echoing after him.
The tips of Dean’s ears go red and he looks like he wants to sink under the water and never talk to any of them ever again.
“So does angel mojo not work on me now?” Dean interrupts what he’s sure is about to be a telling off.
and it doesn’t matter that he looks like a fucking breeze could take him away, he’s still hot.”
Ooh, the bitterness.
And yeah, he’s aware just how fucking unlikely that is.
“Of a kind.” Cas says, with a look that declares this conversation very much over.
“Yeah, I know. I sprung it on you.”
“Hey, I’ll clean it up.”
“You sure there’s not still a little bit of angel juice knocking around that skull of yours?”
Cas shrugs.
They all miss the faint spark that twitches around Rowena’s fingers, the whispered words she breathes out in barely audible tone.
He doesn’t finish that thought. The flicker he thought he kept seeing, the shadow beyond the door, it’s there, it’s there and he can see a shape – a body, large, four legged. He snatches up Cas’s angel blade, hisses under his breath, doesn’t want to let it know that he knows it’s there.
“I take it Dean doesn’t know about this.”
Which wow, spectacularly helpful. Hannah must see Dean’s unimpressed expression because she sighs.
“I’m not saying you can’t.” Sam says, exasperated – close to pulling out his hair. “I’m just saying respect us enough to let us try and change your mind.”
“I can guarantee you two things if you try and drag one of the beds already in the bunker into that room. First, Cas is gonna burn your eyes out, even without his angel powers, and two, it would get wedged in the oh so narrow doorways because there’s no way they didn’t use magic to get those things inside - have you seen the size of the corridors?”
“Okay, step one was a bust, but up next we have the Oregon Museum.” Sam is practically bouncing with excitement.
hasn’t thought of that? Look at it this way, you’ve got two of the most self-sacrificing
“No. C’mon. Y’gotta get used to mornings. I know it sucks, man, but I want you ready for anything.” The unspoken, I don’t want you to get hurt because I was too soft on you, let you sleep, left you unprepared, undercuts his words.
“I’ll go first. There will be danger.”
Dean rolls over to face Cas, something in his eyes that looks a lot like worry and a little like resignation.
“What were you doing?” Sam asks harshly, because he was worried, but no, Cas has just been getting up to something suspicious.
“I don’t mind.”
“Charlie’s magic voodoo.”
“That’s what the Mark is putting out right now. Except you can’t feel it.
Cas has started to perk up, the caffeine has kicked in and he’s awake. And maybe he put a little too much coffee in the mix, or maybe it’s just happiness, because he feels kinda buzzed. Everything’s starting to float on a blissful, cushioned cloud.
“Yeah, whatever. Anyway, I
want to play videogames?” Sam looks up from his book to snark.
“Still weird hearing you make film references.”
She’s not sure it’s doing Dean quite as much good. His face is contorted in a snarl and he’s muttering something under his breath, only stopping to slug from his bottle of Jack – a fresh one, even though he said he was running out.
“I’m sure we’ll work something out.”
“Oh, he uh, went on a food run.”
“I need a
“Dean! Sam! Glad you could make it.” An older man slaps him on the back. He looks so much like a fucking hunter. Grizzled, drunk, nasty little glint in his eye. So, this is Buck, then. “Where’s number three?”
He loops around in a wide circle, runs until he’s sure he’s lost the cops and then runs a little bit more. It’s not paranoia if you’re right. Eventually he slows down to a walk, pulls out his phone and hits the speed dial.
you.”
Except, that’s not fair, that’s not the truth. Dean being spared eternal suffering, and the continued existence of everyone else on earth today, that’s what is being weighed here, in the balance against Cas’s life. And of course Cas is gonna say that’s worth the trade. That’s why he’s Cas.
And he has to keep telling himself that, because otherwise what’s the fucking point.
“You just wait, give it two hours and they’ll be doing shots out of your bellybutton.”
“K – Karael” She stutters. “You’re Castiel?” She sounds uncertain, she recognises the vessel, but the angel writhing around underneath it is so bright she can barely look at him, can’t get a fix. It’s like staring at the sun itself, and even when she closes her eyes she can see an imprint.
Sam sits back down, fists his hands back into his hair and tries not to pull even more out. Theories, he has one, vaguely, sort of. Suspects that maybe it’s actually nothing to do with the dreams. Dean is infected with hell, Cas is an angel. Maybe mind-melding it up is causing their natures to fight and this temperature stuff is just an outward sign of that. Sure, it was Lucifer who ran cold, but he was an angel, whether fallen or not. The Mark of Cain is a thing of rage and violence and heat. It sort of makes sense.
“Can regular demons make crossroads deals?”
Cas tips his head, not how he would have phrased it, but adequate.
He thinks it’s looking for an exit, watches it finally locate the window and fly headlong into it. It falls, dazed. He watches it repeat the mistake again and again until he can’t bear it. He fights with the only openable window in the room for a while, getting increasingly tempted to just punch a hole in it, but eventually triumphs.
He waves his hand in front of Cas’s dead eyes, taps him on the shoulder. He flicks the lights off and on, whacks up the temperature and tries to freeze him out. He pinches his nose shut to see if he's just breathing too shallow for them to notice, prods him in the side, jabs at his ribs and does everything short of actually hurting him.
. We can afford a break.”
Dean grunts his approval, but Cas doesn’t make good on that promise. He brushes his fingers along the thatch of hair just poking out of Dean’s boxers, and then he brings his hand back up to Dean’s head.
“Sorry.” He apologizes, even though Cas is still out cold, can’t hear a word he’s saying.
“Yeah, there fucking is, if it’s making us both this miserable.”
Dean’s heart melts a little.
Splinters of glass fall to the ground and a thin tendril of vine eases its way through. It’s moving too slowly for the normal human eye to see. Cas’s eyes are not normal human eyes.
“Sorry, I got separated, made my own way here.” He lies, not wanting to get kicked out of the building for trespassing.
“I wish you’d never fucking learned how to talk dirty.”
“Yes.”
“Look dude, do whatever you want, but there is no way I am going anywhere near an IKEA with you.”
Maybe, in his ham fisted, emotionally stunted way, this was Dean’s way of trying to open up. Forcing himself into a position where he’d have to unload, justify what he was doing and why.
Sam looks around the room, hunting desperately for the bowl of spellwork to break the tie. He finds it tipped over on the floor. He must have kicked it in his panic. FUCK. Some of the ingredients are salvageable, some of them definitely aren’t. Oh, jesus, fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Dean reaches up to touch Cas, realises he’s still almost entirely clothed and makes a noise of displeasure. He quickly works to fix that. Gross and frumpy and form hiding it might be, but there is one advantage to Cas’s uniform of shirt and jacket. You don’t need to stop kissing to get it off him. Dean pops the buttons nice and slow, stopping in between each one to caress the patch of skin it reveals. He loves the feel of Cas’s firm muscle under his hands, coiled mortal strength barely hinting at the real supernatural might hidden beneath it.
“Cas.” He rasps. “Please, I need to get this thing off of me.”
“You want to cook?”
You nearly didn't have a chapter today because I forgot it was a monday because it's a bank holiday here hahahaha oops. I AM SO TIRED. Love meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
Cas is currently dosed up with as much Valium as is medically recommended to put in one body at a time. He hadn’t calmed down as the night wore on, his temper tantrum with the phone had been just the start. Sam has been physically attacked (not that it hurt), cursed in languages he suspects didn’t even exist before Cas ran out of remembered swears, had to restrain both Cas’s hands to stop him clawing at Sam’s face, narrowly avoided being throttled with the chain of Cas’s manacles, and finally, been thrown up on. Not that, as usual, there was much to throw up.
“You left – what?” He’s too surprised to even joke.
“Castiel, angel of the lord.”
“I dunno what you mean.” Dean says. “It’s perfectly realistic for Laura Whatsit to go treasure hunting in hot pants.”
“Fine. You stay, I’ll go.”
“I thought maybe we could just go for a drive, you and me.  To somewhere populated or not, depending on how adventurous you’re feeling. We could even find somewhere abandoned and get you back behind the wheel. Sure you’re a proficient driver, but it’s all very boring point a to point b shit. Your handbrake turns and donuts need a little work.”
Everything is sorted by colour, which makes it a frustrating experience. All Cas wants to do is rifle through the probably very small section of clothes suitable for someone as emaciated as he is and move on. Instead he has to paw through every single rack while Dean does the same on the side opposite him and Sam loiters near the shoes, noticeably close enough to be useful in case anything happens.
“Nothing like a good beer in good company.”
Cas feels Dean’s cock start to thicken under his touch and he sniggers as Dean lets out another little whine.
He leaves Cas’s boxers on – if Dean wants to sponge bath Cas’s junk that’s up to him, but Sam has to draw the line somewhere. That being said, it’s going to be a while before anyone gets here, and there’s nothing else Sam can usefully do, so he fills up a bucket with lukewarm, soapy water and dips his towel into it.
“You don’t know?” Sam swallows around the lump in his throat, but he forges on ahead anyway. “Okay, that’s fine. We’ve still got some time, right? Research. That’s all we need, we know what we’re facing, we can—”
He lets it go on until she breaks it off, puts her hands on his shoulders and examines him from arm’s length.
“That doesn’t mean you’re coping. You sounded pretty cut up – and pretty drunk – when you called me.”
“Excellent. Do you mind if I snag the laptop – you probably need a break anyway, right? I can see you rolling your shoulders like you’ve been sitting there hunched for too long. And you’ve got like a hundred tabs open.”
“Guard Crowley.” Cas says. “Make sure he doesn’t escape. If he does, we’re all dead, and…” He trails off.
“Has he talked to you, since it happened?”
“No!” He snaps, tired and frustrated and angry at himself and taking it out on Dean, who’s only trying to help but needs to stop before he digs too far. Into the crumbling mess that’s left of Cas. Before he realises that he’s just a pile of ash and spite assembled in the approximate shape of a human being. A push or two away from collapsing, from Dean realising that there is no fixing him.
“Uh…”
Cas doesn’t know what to do. He thinks it’s Dean, it sounds like Dean, it’s acting like Dean, but it can’t be him. That’d be too easy, that’d mean things are gonna be okay, and if the last three months have taught him anything, that’s never the case.
He looks up as Cas approaches him, takes in the look on his face and sighs. There’s a lot of that been going around recently.
“You’re either oblivious, or an idiot.”
“Hi, Cas.” Dean, of course it is.
They pass the walk in silence. Rowena wants answers, but she knows she’ll have to wait to get them. That’s fine. She’s a very impatient person usually, but the stakes are high here. She can rein herself in for the sake of not dying a horrendous death.
He’d barely remember who I am, Cas thinks, cataloguing the rap sheet of his crimes against Dean, weighing them against the good things. Dean doesn’t have the trademark on self-loathing – they’re as bad as each other, just in different ways. Cas hates himself for what he has done to those close to him, Dean hates himself for what he hasn’t been able to do. Maybe that means they complete each other, round each other out. Or maybe instead of two quite damaged people they combine to make one great, big black hole.
Cas notices a red dividing tab about three quarters of the way through, goes to flip it over and is stopped by Sam’s hand on the paper. He flinches slightly at the sudden movement, but luckily it doesn’t go further. An almost proportional response, huh.
He probably had already killed when he was their age. And Jesus, isn’t that a strange thought.
“I know that angels are dying. Some at your hand, some not.”
“He instructed me to continue as planned, draw suspicion.”
how you knock out a demon. Dean determinedly ignores said look.
“I don’t think he’s fit enough to fight, and I dunno what we’ll find if we go to the place Cas, or whoever, really is.”
“Stuff.”
“Let’s just make this quick, okay?”
This is more like the usual Cas. Barely restrained and hungry for as much of Dean as he can possibly get.
“Do they still have drive-ins anymore?”
“From totally un-food delivery related circumstances.”
can feel it, but somehow you can’t – until I provide a bypass directly to your brain.”
“Exactly. So, back to the motel, I need to set up some stuff,” lies, “it’ll take a few hours.”
Cas flips the pancake again. And again.
“Whuh?” He looks out of the car blearily, sees fields of flowers. “Where are we? This isn’t the bunker.”
“Open your eyes, Dean.”
“It’s not just that, though. It’s a whole fucking series of things. If we hadn’t treated him so badly in the past, sent him away when he needed us, left him to fend for himself , maybe it wouldn’t have come to this. Maybe he’d have come and talked to me, or tried to make it up to you another way, instead of going off alone, pulling a spell out of his ass and doing god alone knows what else.”
“DEAN!”
“What, so you think fucking crying my eyes out for an hour is gonna help? It’s gonna magically make things better again?”
He feels a twinge of disappointment at his own callousness, but not particularly any surprise. He is less, now. Physically and mentally. His love and patience and kindness are diminished along with his muscle mass – except somehow he suspects they’re less likely to recover with time.
What remains of the dresser goes the same way as the bedframe. Soon there’s a neat pile of firewood and kindling in one corner. Sam stands up, wipes his black, sweaty hands on his jeans and then grunts in irritation when he realises that now he’s just smeared great, dark, handprints down the leg. He’ll have to go get changed before he’s allowed to sit down on the sofa with a cold beer. Because for someone who spends half their time covered in grave dirt and blood, Dean has become almost charmingly house-proud when it comes to the bunker. To his first real home in years, outside the Impala.
“Funny, I thought it was called Taurus.”
you do this?”
“Try and get some sleep, Sam. At least one of us should be okay.”
He has control of his body again, somehow. He doesn’t know how for sure, but he has a vague inkling that he actually has the panic attack to thank for it, that in torturing Castiel, Lucifer created his own undoing.
“I ain’t tunnelling through no shit.” A middle aged woman, with a knife on her belt the size of Cas’s arm, sneers.
Eventually he gives up on sleep. He gets out of bed and goes to the kitchen, the library. Wanders aimlessly, trying to let the rhythm of his steps lull him into unthinking hypnosis.
The last time he saw Cas comatose like this, was when he was falling, when he expended too much energy and nearly killed himself.
“I know what you’ll use it to ask about, and I don’t want to talk about it.”
Sam has to concede that. The bunker is fucking freezing. Brilliant water pressure, shame the magic doesn’t extend to the radiators.
“I thought you were allergic to greenery.”
“Some crazy fucking angel kidnapped him and pumped him full of junk for three months, that’s fucking what.” Dean snaps at his knees, apparently unable to summon the energy to address Hannah directly.
“Higher than Cas?” Dean snaps.
“If you expect me to be grateful—”
“At a pace previously unknown to sloths, maybe.”
“Cops. We gotta go, now.”
“I’ll slit your throat.”
And then Hannah lunges forward, grabs Dean by the neck and holds him up against the wall. “But I don’t believe you. Stop lying to me, Dean.”
“This close.”
Sam watches her go with a sad, fond look. Dean didn’t know how close he was to the truth when he lashed out, and yeah, he probably shouldn’t be dividing his attention when the apocalypse is knocking at the gates. But hell, what the fuck is the point in saving the world if you don’t take out a few hours a week to fucking appreciate someone who makes it worth it.
She spreads the map out across the sofa-bed where Dean and Cas are sitting watching dumb cartoons (Dean) and drifting in and out of sleep (Cas), and then plonks the laptop down too.
Sam is kind of floored by the sudden about turn.
It’s quiet out here. Just the sounds of lapping waves and seagulls.
Hannah does her angelic blinking thing for a few moments, and then comes back with a reply.
“I want to choose my own clothes.”
“I imagine that’s what he’s counting on.” Charlie says.
“Dean?” Lucifer channels all Cas’s worry and fear into the word. God, but it’s handy having a live in version of the person you’re pretending to be.
Death vanishes, and Dean doesn’t even count to three before he dives for the whiskey.
He goes in anyway, spends uncomfortable days rattling around the too big space. Full of good and bad memories, but the bad seem a lot more present now. Funny that.
There aren’t any other people with him here, though. It’s just Cas.
“It’s about to be the upholstery’s problem.”
Dean strips down to his boxers and shirt, suppresses a smile as Cas’s fierce gaze drifts and he struggles to keep his eyes open. He thinks about hunting around for a pair of sleep pants like the ones Cas is wearing, acutely aware that he’s a lot more naked than Cas is and not sure if that’s okay or not. It might be a psychological comfort thing, the long sleeves and pyjamas, not wanting to be exposed, or it might just be because there’s no meat and very little muscle left on his bones and he gets cold easy. He probably won’t mind if Dean’s a little less covered, but he’s not going to strip off entirely. It wouldn’t feel right – equal, somehow.
“If Naomi’s programming had taken over I’d be dead. Or he would have tried, at least.”
She thinks about waiting until he’s fallen asleep, but he’s worked himself up into such a state of agitation that she doubts that is going to happen anytime soon. There isn’t even a lingering roundness of drink to his thoughts, which is unusual. From what she knows of Dean she expected that to be his first recourse in a breakup or tantrum or whatever this is.
“Very funny.”
Dean laughs. Everyone thinks Cas is this cultureless tightass who doesn’t get jokes and doesn’t use contractions, but they couldn’t be more wrong. He’s the king of sarcastic little shits and apparently a horny asshole to boot. And he fucking loves him, oh, but he does.
Yeah, sure. We’ll go with that.
Human Cas appears to be an adrenaline junkie thrill seeker, and Dean isn’t sure how he feels about it. He goes on rides with him, because he’s not a baby, but that doesn’t mean he particularly enjoys it. He’d much rather be sitting down with a beer and some greasy burger than being thrown across the sky.
“Touchy.”
“How?”
“I don’t legally exist and Dean has been officially dead at least twice.” Cas’s gruff mumble interrupts, rescuing Dean from his slightly cornered fluster.
“I haven’t. I can feel those things through walls.”
Little Sam nods warily, flexes his leg, tests it to be sure.
Sam?” Dean lunges upwards, grabs Sam by the lapels and pins him against the wall, screams into his face. “He left me a
And that’s what he wants now.
“I forgot, okay. Back when, y’know—” they always skirt around Dean’s brief period as a demon, never quite address it “— if he was pissing me off I could just, uh, tap him out.”
He sees an opening, a slip of vulnerable flesh left undefended, and he pounces.
“That wasn’t very clever, was it, Castiel?” Naomi’s voice claws at him, brutal in a way that her touch doesn’t manage. “Trying to tear out your grace and fall – you know we couldn’t allow you to do that.”
Which leaves the third option.
A lie, but near enough to the truth.
“It got a name?”
Like Lucifer doesn’t know that the quickest, most effective way to eviscerate Cas would be to go for Dean Winchester.
But Sam’s too tired to give that train of thought the self-disgust it deserves.
“Shit.”
“For my charm and wit and also because I’m about to make you lunch.”
His hand drags through something warm and sticky and he stills, listening carefully as he brings the offending fingers up close to his eye. His night vision has settled a little, but he still can’t really tell what it is. Can hazard a rough guess, though.
Dean hesitates for a moment – he doesn’t want to go and miss Sam getting picked up, but at this time of the fucking night it could take him ages, and there’s no way Dean’s gonna be able to chase a car on foot.
And you were too late.
“Tough shit.”
“If the angels aren’t on other planets, where are they, then?”
“You don’t believe me? I’m wounded.”
“Why did the door scream?” Cas asks, even though he really doesn’t want to know.
“How about we both face each other?”
“So will your dumb forest.”
“See, now you get my body heat instead of the cold leather.”
The food he left out for Cas is sat on his bedside table, barely touched, but the glass is empty. Baby steps. The vitamins must do him some good, ‘specially if he’s barely eating. Plus dude can’t be getting any vitamin C – or is it D? The sunshine one, not the one you get from fruit. Anyway, whichever it is, he can’t be getting enough of it, cooped up in this dark, windowless place.
She shrugs. “I’m hungry, I’ll take the risk.”
Sam doesn’t even register the made-up word, doesn’t register most of the sentence. “He’s still here.”
Time to confront the devil.
Cas can see Dean starting to bristle, mentally begs Sam to cut through the babble and just spit it out before Dean gets so insulted he takes a long drive down a short road, vanishes off into the wilderness in the real world as well as his dreams.
“And instead of coming to me for help, you decided to try and do it yourself?”
“De—”
He hasn’t even come to check whether Cas is alive, and Cas gets that. He gets why, but. But what? But he’s weak and he just wants to see Dean’s face one more time – even if all Dean does is tell him to go fuck himself again.
“Huh.”
That triggers a thought. A strange, confusing one. He wants, no, he
“Since when?”
They go through the tedious process of being fitted for leathers and a helmet. Keith takes their measurements, writes them down on a business card and hands it over to each individual.
“So you don’t know what you think?” Cas probes.
“Huh?”
“I already told you, I didn’t know that.” Cas snaps.
The guilty look on Cas’s face says it all. Dean rolls his eyes theatrically.
“Thanks, captain bad news.”
“Jesus, fuck.” Dean says. “That’s way too long to be stuck inside. We shoulda taken you out on a grocery run or two, or, I dunno, something.”
“Uhuh. And why did you
“I’m listening.”
and bread and butter costs $4.”
Sam idly flicks through the Netflix menu while she’s gone. He’s tempted to go for something with a loud jump scare opening, just to startle Dean awake, but he’s not as much of a dick as his brother is, so he restrains himself.
Cas doesn’t have the energy to be polite and turn it down. He just mumbles thanks and grits his teeth as Dean gently cleans his wounds.
“Maybe.”
“Dean? Dean!”
“Yeah, uh, I fucked up. Lemme think, yeah? I’ll get it, I promise. I’ll prove it to you.”
“I’ll call you every day, even if the only news is that he’s drooled on his fucking pillow. You’ll be the first to know.”
Dean can’t help the panic, thick and heavy, rising up in his chest and threatening to smother him.
He dials him back.
“Oblivion.” Cas helpfully supplies.
Jesus, he’s feeling sappy today
“It doesn’t mention
wrote down, because
“Bobby was a good man.” Cas says.
“Hey there.” He says, looking up at Cas with a grin.
“And then to the next name on the list.”
“What do you need?”
Lucifer sniggers. Cas can pretend it doesn’t bother him all he wants, Lucifer can feel every word hit home. Cas wants Dean in every way possible, and despite the protesting and angsty handwringing, there was always a little sliver of hope that he might get him. Now, though, Cas is riding shotgun with the devil, and even if he gets what he wants, it’ll be irrevocably tainted.
Jesus, but he’s a bastard. He knows that Cas needs someone to talk to, but he can’t even let him have that, wants to run in there and tear that away from him too. He’s like the worst kind of abuser, trying to stake Cas off in a corner where he only has Dean to rely on.
He hares off to the side, down what could be politely described as a crack alley, and throws himself over the chain link fence. He snags his leg on the barbed wire as he goes over, lands awkwardly and painfully. He’s getting too old for this shit. If he doesn’t get arrested that’s it, he’s giving up the life for good, no more hunts and no more cop dodging. He’s going to buy a cat and a house and get a job. Yeah, right. More likely he’s going to live in a fucking cave in the woods and punch deer to death for sustenance, but whatever. Out of the game is out of the game. He hasn’t met a deer yet with fangs and a taste for human blood.
“Of course not. I told you, you all look the same to me. Grubs. Pointless, hairy grubs.” She sneers.
He tries so hard to trust this, his present. His fucked up and broken but still reforming life. He wants to trust the gift he’s been given, stop desperately looking for the catch, the trick.
His first thought is police, his second thought is maybe it’s someone with a camera and a mic and when he opens the door they’re gonna point at him and laugh and yell GOTCHA. Okay, maybe that’s not exactly something he expects, maybe that’s more just wishful thinking.
SORRY
“Yeah Captain-getting-ahead-of-himself.”
Dean isn’t sure if he’s relieved or not.
“He’d probably use his crowbar to readjust your facial features.”
He’s not supposed to be unconscious on the bed, fucking heroin and what the fuck else they don’t know coursing through his system, only sign of life a goddamn pulse.
“It can’t be that hard. I dunno how we’d hook it up to the bunker’s mystical magical grid, but I think we get enough sun, I could connect it to some solar panels, build us something good. Something that’ll last as long as we do.”
Hannah rubs at her temple. It’s an oddly human gesture, one Sam wouldn’t have expected from her.
She grins, takes a couple of paces forwards and plunges her hand into the wall. There’s a screaming sound, and then the door swings open.
“Not unless it was made of mud.”
“No. You’re not.”
Dean fidgets with the phone for a few minutes, taps out another text.
He shakes her off.
Lucifer says in the memory, as he summons up his angel blade. Not Cas’s – Sam won’t be able to tell the difference, and Lucifer isn’t touching Cas’s tainted, dirty instrument unless he has to.
“So, what next?” Sam asks.
"Just go see his fucking grave, Dean. Do that for me."
“What’ve you been getting yourself mixed up in, brother?” Benny asks, stepping away and wiping it off with the back of his hand.
Dean smiles, takes his phone out of his pocket, snaps a quick photo and then sets it next to Ca’s trunks, starts wading in to join him.
“You mean this?” She pulls a messily rolled ream of parchment out of her belt. “I knocked Crowley out, but he’ll sound the alarm as soon as he wakes.”
“Guidance?” Sam asks. He’s been very quiet, that ferocious brain of his pounding along at a hundred miles an hour, bouncing from hypothesis to conclusion and not liking any of it.
He sits at the steering wheel and tries to push everything away, supress and tamp down and just keep fucking moving. He can feel it, the sick, boiling fucking hopelessness, rising in the pit of his stomach, and for the first time today, he can’t stop it.
He waits until he’s sure she’s gone, carefully takes out the long shard of broken whiskey bottle that he’d been hiding under his leg, smiles a grotesque, red-toothed smile.
“I’ve always admired your kindness.” Cas suspects that the key to complimenting Dean Winchester is to only throw out one at a time. A list he’ll rebuff without pausing, but focus on one thing and shut down any arguments he throws at you, and maybe, just maybe he’ll internalise the tiniest bit of it.
Still nothing.
Cas fists his hands back in Dean’s hair, digs his nails in a little. Dean whines and Cas takes the hint, presses in harder as Dean moves his focus down to snag his teeth on one of Cas’s nipples. He moans, digs his fingers even harder into Dean’s scalp. Dean laves his tongue over the bite mark he left, soothes it as he reaches down to Cas’s crotch. He unzips him, shoves his pants and underwear down and laughs at the awkward little shimmy he does to kick them off, out of the way.
“I was too busy being a royal fucking dick to everything in my path.”
“I thought it was Dean, back for another one of our talks.”
Cas shrugs. “It’s new.”
“Oh.” Cas blinks at him, not quite awake or fully processing. Dean waits for him to say, I’ll just share Dean’s bed, blow the whole thing wide and burn all their bridges with the hunter community forever. He doesn’t though. He just flicks Dean a confused little glance and nods.
“Self-loathing gremlins, sometimes they get loose. I’m always around to help stuff them back in the box, though. If you want.” Dean’s tone is gruff, almost as if he’s embarrassed by the offer.
“We could perform a mercy kill.” Cas says bitterly, refusing to meet Dean’s eye, refusing to even talk
A sensation he caused.
He didn’t realise he needed it. But he fucking does.
“Precisely how many bars have you put on this list, Dean?”
“Your terms will have to be good. It’s a big job.”
Dean snorts. “Like that makes it better. He didn’t want to tell me so bad even you gave up trying to persuade him.”
“What’s so funny?”
And just like that, the peace is gone, and the itching, scraping, burning is back.
“Oh yeah?”
The onions get chucked in, then a couple of cans of tomatoes, ground beef, stock, all the green herbs they can muster and some cayenne pepper. When Cas goes to grab the decimated heap of cabbage he squints at it suspiciously.
He doesn’t react like he can hear Cas, carries on staring, wide-eyed and panicky into the distance.
Sam scrubs at his eyes, knows he has no chance of talking Dean down here. The best he can do is take Cas, run and just fucking hope for the best.
“But it isn’t leaning towards that side. It’s going towards the right – even though the branches there are bare, gnarled and strange.”
The angel pulls the blade out and Dean can’t help a pained hiss, flinching as she jabs her fingers into the wound and pokes and prods. She repeats the process with the gunshot wound, muttering to herself, too low for Dean to hear, and then straightens.
“Uh, more like a respectful offering.”
“Cas is ordering for you.”
A spade to lean on instead of the hand he’d been reaching for, a brush of fingers followed by a flinch backwards, dreams of being held but waking to find no-one there.
Chapter title taken from the Elbow song,
Lucifer actually laughs at that.
“What’s up?”
She winks. “For me to know, and you to forever wonder.”
“What’s going on?”
“He thinks they’ve found something.”
“I didn’t trust you enough to share it with you. I still don’t. However, the circumstances are different now, the stakes higher—”
“Yeah, they’re pretty nasty. Not infected though, thanks for small miracles.”
“That’s not—”
“No. I want to lie here and die. Go away.”
quirk of his eyebrow.
“Keen.” Dean notes, standing up too. “We’re gonna have to wrap you up a bit first, though. I know it’s like April, but it’s still 55F out and you ain’t got much in the way of insulation.”
Cas lets himself be pulled to his feet and they troop around the room together, opening cupboards, poking at bookcases and marvelling at the difference in quality between this and their usual rooms.
She barrels on as if she hasn’t heard him. “So instead of aiming for just outside the boundary, I tried to return here and ended up bouncing off. Very unpleasant.”
“I know, babe.”
The vines are weaving closer, and there’s nothing Cas can do to escape them. The sanctuary his unconscious mind attempted to build for him has backfired. Cuffs are all very well to keep him immobile when the danger is far away, stop him wandering towards it. They are less helpful when the rabid dogs are running freely through the halls of his castle, getting closer moment by moment.
He strikes gold under the bed. Or not. He strikes, something.
The angel frowns at them. “You may want to cover your ears.”
Cas narrows his eyes, considers telling Dean to go and fuck himself, but thinks better of it. He doesn’t want Dean’s pity, but Dean does need the sleep. If that’s the price...
Apparently over his fear of imminent death, he gives her a look that says where the fuck do you expect me to go and sputters, “you can’t leave me here?!”
Sam wishes he could say that Cas’s attack was a wakeup call, that he was on the other side of the argument now, easy enough. It’s not, though.
And just like that, he walks out of the room. Charlie takes a moment to follow him. She has no idea if this counts as a victory or not, she’s too busy reeling from the emotional whiplash.
“I found a book at the bottom of a box Sam gave me; thought it’d make a good distraction.”
“This contract requires the whole of it, not just some.”
After what feels like a goddamn eternity, Cas pulls off.
“Are you drunk?”
“We’ll improvise. After all, I’ve got the itinerary.”
“I bet there’s a spell for that. You’d learn that spell for me if—” Cas breaks off, suddenly aware that he was about to say
Cas tone flips again, hard edged and cold.
“I said I hadn’t reaped him yet, Dean. I didn’t say I wouldn’t be doing it soon.”
“Yeah, something like that.”
Dean yanks his arm away from her. “Yeah, then why did I find him laughing about being an angel again? Fucking tell me that, Charlie. He doesn’t want to be here, he made a mistake and he thought I was worth giving up his grace for and now he’s paying the price for my goddamn failure!”
Cas bites gently at his neck.
Cas cuts him off with a bitter laugh. “Welcome to the new me.” There’s a look in his eyes that Dean half recognises, but not from this face. Not from this version of Cas. It terrifies him, and not just because of what it might mean for Cas.
Dean is being a dick, and he’s aware of that, but he’s also very tense right now and he can’t help it.
“Hello, Dean.”
Cas recognises the words from another time, long ago. When he barely knew Dean. He’s not sure why Lucifer is parroting them now, can only tell that he finds something about the whole situation almost unbearably hilarious.
“Well, if the ex-agent of fate says it’s 20, I’ll take that.”
“You can prove nothing.” The lump on the ground mumbles.
“That’s ‘cause I am.” He’s gotta keep his voice under control, can’t let it crack again. He’s gotta be strong, for Cas.
“You don’t know? He told me once, when he was drunk. Wouldn’t have told me sober – about the only thing he really learned from us was martyrdom. She reprogrammed him, all that time we didn’t see him, or we did and he was being weird, she had her spikes in his brain.”
Dean gapes at him, realises that he’s taking the piss and slaps him on the shoulder.
No. He has to give him the benefit of the doubt. Even if Cas was, y’know, he wouldn’t put Dean in danger like that, wouldn’t go somewhere there was any risk of attack.
“Yeah, and that usually results in them trying to kill us.” Dean croaks. Too little sleep and too much beer haven’t been kind to his throat. Or any of the rest of him, for that matter.
He can’t. He doesn’t. He, fuck.
“So you’re giving up?”
Too. Easy.
“I am excellent company.” Charlie interjects. “Shame about you lot, though.”
Cas throws back his head in frustration, pulls away. Dean’s too hungry to even be that disappointed. They’ll have all the time in the world for fucking later; right now he needs to get some food in his system before he ends up passed flat out.
come first.”
It burns as it goes down, and he shudders with a mixture of shame and relief.
He’s the only one who’s allowed to sacrifice himself, and not for the world, not for the big things, the apocalypses and the dooms. For the little things like keeping his family together. Let the others save the world. He’ll save his little, battered, found family. With his own blood and bone and sinew. With his soul.
“Oh.”
“Right.”
Cas frowns, scrunches the pictures up and puts them in his pocket, goes back in the booth and tries again. This time he succeeds.
So, of course, that’s the first thing Lucifer does while he’s wearing Cas's body.
“Yeah, and I imagine hiding them is making you re-open them more than you would otherwise, isn’t it?”
Terror and anxiety and love and fury and despair and guilt, thick, viscous pools of guilt.
“Is this okay?” He mumbles, and Cas laughs, kisses him again with the same casual intimacy.
“So, where do you think it got the idea from?”
“Lego is for children.” Dean interrupts again.
“There’s only one thing that’s made you feel good these past months, Castiel. Only one thing that can wipe away all that pain.
“You want a distraction?”
He’s not quite burning up any more, but he still twinges, still
He turns to Dean and Cas for support, sees that they haven’t even been listening. They’re standing together, Cas with a hand gripped gently around Dean’s wrist, looking him in the eye and saying something in a soft undertone.
“Don’t." His voice rises, angry, but still not enough to look at Cas. "I can’t hear that bullshit right now. About what I’m worth or not.”
“Jesus, when you put it like that...”
The sword the creature is holding, a beautiful, monstrous thing – black metal folded through with red, a guard formed of a whole, twisted and gnarled horn, and a grip of dyed red leather and rope – falls to the ground and Dean snatches it up greedily.
“I didn’t think it would go that far.” Cas says. “I gave him the blade at the last moment, insurance against something I was certain wouldn’t happen.”
“So, who we going to visit first?”
It’s like touching Lucifer.
Dean grins back. “Yeah, it is.” And then he bursts out laughing. “What are we, 12-year-old girls?”
“Okay, that is brilliant, brilliant, but evil.”
“I’m. Fine.”
Cas does ease up on him after that. He’d only been doing it to wind Sam up, there’s no actual malice there.
(See the end of the chapter for
He just wants to go home. He wants to wake up next to Cas and not be drenched in sweat and shaking, breathing in the remnants of sulphur from the air.
“There’s blood seeping through your shirt, dude.”
“I can tell you’re thinking about something, so just spill or we’ll ban you from the hot tub.”
Dean grunts. There’s a big difference between looking for someone who’s out in the open, moving around and murdering people, and looking for someone who’s been kidnapped and held somewhere. One you look at the trail of bodies, the other you look in basements and hope bodies are the last thing you come across.
“Yeah, I know. I just, uh. I needed to hear a friendly female voice.”
“You are an ass.”
Cas laughs again.
— Of course.
He notices that the first page has been torn out.
“Well, yeah.” Sam says. “But once we’ve cleaned it and filled it I think it’ll be perfectly workable. What d’ya think?”
“Did you apologise?”
“And?” Sam prompts, not expecting good news. Dean doesn’t have the face of someone who’s spent the night happily reconciling – less bubbly, more tired and drawn and also with the imprint of half a keyboard on his face.
“Oh, uh. Yeah. Good idea.”
Dean laughs. “You wish. This is just crap I’ve picked up from your drunken rants.”
“We discussed options to bring to you, you stubborn asshole, and thought that since you seemed comfortable in the car, maybe something that involves driving might be a good starting place.”
“I won’t.”
“That’s a beer, Cas.”
That was the first snag.
“Muriel,” Sam queries patiently, “would you recognise Castiel’s vessel, if he wasn’t in it?”
Cas slips his hand up under Dean’s t-shirt, enjoying the shiver it earns him. He takes this as a sign that Dean wouldn’t mind being divested of a few items of clothing and starts to make that happen, but instead Dean backs away.
“Damn straight.” Dean shoots his reply at Sam’s retreating back and gestures for Cas to come over. He’s crumpled looking, barely awake, leaning on the table for support.
"No you weren't, you were thinking it's about time to follow him into the goddamn grave!"
“I died for a cause, Dean. Don’t throw it away.”
He used Dean’s face and voice and body to get off. Dean who won’t pick up his calls, who never wants to see him again, most likely. He fucked Dean over, but he’s still okay to use him for this.
Charlie.
He snorts, looks down at his hand. It’s still trembling, but only minutely. And anyway, there’s nothing he can do about it now. He’s just gotta hope that he’s somehow managed to scrape the bottom of his bad luck barrel and from here things will work his way.
“No, that’s all. Thank you.”
“It shouldn’t matter that he nearly killed himself to help you. You shouldn’t need to know that to feel bad for treating him like shit.”
“I just don’t want to waste time, Charlie.” He says, as she steers him into the lunch queue and then orders for him when he’s too busy vibrating on the spot to notice the poor server trying to get his attention.
“Then why did he leave you?” He can hear her fucking head tilt from here.
“Did you dream again?”
It sounds like a spiel, like something he’s memorised. Charlie can’t help probing.
“It hurts, Dean. It hurts.”
He repeats himself.
“Not even slightly, you sly bastard.”
“Uh. Okay, good. Are you free after?”
I'll try and give it a final once over at some point tomorrow, but there won't be any major changes, just tidying up the language so don't feel like you have to wait or anything.
“Oh, uh, shit. I-I’m sorry you had to see this, hear me.”
“You know what this is about, right?”
“That sounds like Dean.”
He knows the more he thinks about the fear the worse it gets. Even thinking about how angry it makes him, that he’s been reduced to this cowering grateful little thing nudges him back towards panic. Back towards thoughts of helplessness.
“I can’t do that, Dean.”
“It’s just a piece of badly folded white paper.”
“Yes. Fine.” He’s not, but there isn’t time for that. “As I was saying, the nightmares, they have two purposes. The first is to weaken Dean. His human soul and the power of hell are enough to keep purgatory leashed, it's only when one of them falls that it can gain a greater hold on him.”
“I couldn’t, I didn’t want to, I’m sorry.” He’s babbling, fighting his own incoherence of thought as well as his inability to literally get words out of his mouth. Maybe it doesn’t matter if he doesn’t apologise
Sam helps Cas get his shirt off and gets to work on the bandages on his chest. Cas could probably do those himself but he doesn’t. Easier to get Sam to do everything, maybe, or maybe it’s easier not to think about them if he doesn’t look.
“Oh. Hi.” His tone is distant, clipped. Like Cas is less his friend, his – for want of a less infantilising word – boyfriend, and more some strange little nuisance that he’s picked up along the way and can’t shake off.
“We look normal.”
most appropriate place for their first kiss, if you measure it against the rest of their lives. It’s not like they spend much time doing other stuff. He senses that voicing that sentiment is not going to help, though.
“Charlie, I know for a fact you’ve killed monsters.”
And Dean’s already close to breaking someone’s neck.
“Oh, no.” He squints, embarrassed. “It’s, I just.. I was
Dean understands first, ducks out to the side and charges at one angel, lunges and slashes, nicks at her arms and body and forces her to retreat back and back and back until she’s in the trap. Hannah is too busy filling the defensive gap left by Dean’s absence, and it takes her a moment, but then she too gets it.
As another two days go by and no-one sees Sam in the flesh – although there are signs he’s been a-prowl in the night, missing books from the library, a steadily depleting pile of healthy snacks – it  develops into a running joke. At breakfast Charlie hypothesises that Sam never left his room at all, that he’s still holed up there and waiting for the perfect moment to make a break for it.
“Suicidal wife.” Sam fills in, ‘cause Dean might pretend he’s being enigmatically vague, but really he just drinks too much and his memory is fucking patchy.
“I’m really sorry to hear that.” She sounds genuinely sympathetic. “But I am still going to have to ask you to pay up front. It’s the hotel’s policy.”
The drive back is tense and mostly silent. Also, Cas drives like a fucking maniac. And not in the way that Dean drives like a maniac. Cas drives like he wants to die.
he does. but deep down, where it matters, he hates me for letting it happen. I can see it.”
Teeth bite into the meat of his shoulder and he throws back his head and yells in pain. He sees the thickly haired head of the 'wolf currently chowing down on his shoulder and from there it’s easy enough to stab the sword in somewhere vulnerable enough to make it let go.
“Take off your shirt.” He says, voice hoarse.
Slightly winded from the effort, she sits on the ground, grimacing at the muck. She lays her hands on the earth and closes her eyes, mutters a spell in Old Irish, the root language of her mother tongue, Scots Gaelic. Old spells work best in the language they were birthed in, and besides, she rarely finds occasion to use either tongue these days. No point advertising to the world just how genuinely ridiculously old she is.
Sam leans over, presses on the back of Cas’s frog and releases. It hops.
“FUCK!”
“Good. Now what do you want?”
“What’s up?”
“Hannah!” Charlie snaps. “Not the time. Constructive ideas only.”
“No.” He sounds so broken, quiet and bemused.
No more stupid breaks though, It'll be regular, I promise.
“People dying early messes up my schedules, requires a lot of work and creative timekeeping. You have already caused me enough trouble for one lifetime, thank you.
She shrugs, accepts the offered hand and follows Dean to the range.
“Okay, off you go.”
Sam sifts through the past half hour, decides to share it all. He doesn’t know what’s pertinent and what’s not, and they’ve been stung by that before.
“No, it wouldn’t. But never mind that, I can finish biting your head off for all of this goddamn mess later. You didn’t come all the way here to spill the news about Cas in person, your panicked, last minute phone call made that pretty clear. So honest to god, what’s happening now that’s so bad you needed me face to face.”
“I take it you want something, this isn’t just, y’know, having a bad day and wanting something to smite?”
Crowley gulps, guilty as charged.
dying for good.”
Sam answers the door to Hannah’s impatient knock, and he’s so surprised to see the vessel she’s using, that instead of letting her in he frowns, asks, “I thought you gave Caroline back?”
“You get another shot if you pocket a ball.”
“Ca—”
Sam nods, even though he knows it’s bullshit, even though Dean’s leg is fine and they both fucking know it, and accompanies an increasingly confused Cas back to the Impala.
“Charming.” She rolls her eyes, drums her fingers against the doorframe.
“Maybe not deliberately.”
Cas wakes up, stiff and sore – not much unusual about that. Slightly more unusual is that he’s slumped on the floor, between the wall and the bed with an angel blade at his feet.
“Hundreds and thousands of crushed little pieces. Sad, broken on their own, but bring them together and they make something wonderful.”
In the memory Lucifer laughs, flashes his eyes and flicks out Castiel’s wings – broken and threadbare.
“With my grace stabilised. I call that a result.”
“One down, 999 to go.”
“Nah it’s fine, you just relax. Let me take care of things.”
they do now with no driving force, be it another apocalypse or Dean getting a bit too excited about the prospect of a holiday.
“What’s so bad it wouldn’t even be an option?”
Dean nods. “Been there, doesn’t matter how many werewolves are howling at your door, sometimes you just think you’ll die if you can’t see the sky one more time.”
“Truce.”
”It’s hard not to drink?”
Dean nods slowly, pacified by that. Charlie heaves a sigh of relief, follows him back around the sofa section as he insists on trying out each one, sitting down and bouncing around on them so many times that eventually an employee comes over to see if they’re okay.
“Hey, Cas. You want something?”
“Quickest mutiny I’ve ever seen.” He snorts.
“I didn’t know you could.” Crowley mutters.
“And hey, it’s better than scrolling through the Netflix menu for the next two hours.”
Cas grimaces. “You were killed by a hellhound. I’d forgotten, it seems so long ago.”
He hears rattling coming from Cas’s room, goes over to investigate. He’s asleep, or he’s got his eyes closed at least, but he’s writhing.
“Sam.” Dean says, fishing in his pocket out of force of habit for keys he knows live on a hook near the garage now. “We’re going for a drive, c’mon.”
Cas snatches the offered bag, flips through the contents. By the time he looks up, satisfied, Crowley is gone.
Cas has to ask, even though he doesn’t want to – would rather float on by in blissful ignorance.
“Dude, it’s just. He had some big romantic plan for you tonight, was like, gonna, confess his love and all that sappy shit he pretends to hate, and you go and blow it by kissing him with a concussion in some dump of a warehouse surrounded by dead vampires.”
“I mean it, you don’t know what it’s like at first – you’d say anything, do anything for your fix.”
He feels a sudden spike of emotion from Dean’s mind – something is happening to him, but Cas can’t tell what – whether it’s good or bad or somewhere in between. The air in purgatory is thick with magic and ritual, it should be enhancing their connection, not dampening it. Cas keeps trying to reach out, warn Dean, tell him not to take the quick route home, but he doesn’t get a response, doesn’t think it’s worked.
“Hello, tech wizard. I have a very particular set of skills, and I will find you.”
He turns his attention to Dean. “Dean, angle it more like this.” He swipes his hands diagonally, as Dean gawps uselessly and doesn’t move.
"Mine it is, then."
Ash answers the door, as bright and awake as Sam. Sarah groans something from where she’s lying on the floor.
face on. And the fact that he no longer possesses the strength to do that makes it all the more terrifying somehow. You know he’d still manage it – you don’t want to think about how.
