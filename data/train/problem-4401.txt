“The Empty did take me Dean, you’re right. But then Jack came and broke me out. He freed me, and Anna, and Balthazar, and Gabriel and he allowed us to come here, to help him make a new Heaven. Bobby should have already explained this to you, it’s why I said he should be the one to meet you. Did...did he not tell you that I was here?”
“Well, it’s seen as a way to make positive changes. But I guess people make their goals too big, and that’s why they fail. Or not fail, I guess, but why they might give up on that big goal. I’ve never made a resolution before, I’m pretty perfect as it is.”
Behind him, the countdown was entering the final stages, Sam was calling his name while Jack loudly shouted out the numbers but all he can focus on is Cas. Cas with his bright blue eyes, wide with surprise, his mouth dropped open slightly as if the wind had been knocked out of him, and a slight flush crossed his cheeks. The countdown has reached 1 behind him, Sam and Jack are loudly wishing each other a Happy New Year, and Cas is reaching his hands towards Dean.
Although, what he wanted Cas to know was soon lost due to Sam bursting into the kitchen to inform them that the countdown was about to start and they needed to hurry up, that Jack was wondering where they were. Dean nodded and handed Sam his cocktail, smiling at Cas as he moved past him into the corridor and back towards where he had left Sam and Jack, conscious all the way of Cas’ eyes on his back. They rounded the corner, to find Jack still sat on the floor before the TV, his head turned to face them with a wide smile stretching across his cheeks. Dean couldn’t help but smile back at the kid.
The near slip of the tongue was enough to cause Dean to flush bright red. Bobby didn’t call him out on it, which he was grateful for. He had enough on his mind without needing to worry about Bobby’s good opinion of him. The silence returned to the two men, although it wasn’t nearly as peaceful as it had been before. Dean started to tap his fingers on his knees, tension growing across his shoulder blades the longer he sat there.
The hurt in his voice didn’t seem to stop his eyes from scanning the area in front of the Roadhouse, as if something, or someone Bobby thought, would suddenly appear. Taking pity on Dean, he turned again in his seat;
If Dean wasn’t leaning against the countertop, he was certain that he would have fallen over. His stomach was flip-flopping all over the place, and his heart was beating far too fast to be particularly healthy and he was sure that he was bright red. In a split second, he had come to a decision that his resolution was going to start now.
“But you didn’t come and find me, you didn’t answer my prayer?! I thought you didn’t want to see me, I thought you didn’t lo- I mean…. I thought you were done with me.”
His eyes peeled open, the meadow before him swimming into focus as he lifted a hand to wipe the tears that had made their way down his face. He sniffs loudly, before turning his head to the side to try and find the source of the warmth on his shoulder. And promptly finds himself staring into a very familiar, and much loved pair of bright blue eyes. He shuffles back, nearly falling on his ass as he tries to put some distance between him and the vision in front of him. Not-Cas reaches out to steady him, but stops short, as if he knows that his touch would not be welcome at that moment, and Dean tries hard to not focus on the look of hurt that flashes across the thing wearing Cas’ face.
“But let’s see; your favourite superhero is Batman, you cannot function without a coffee in the morning, you always double knot your shoelaces, you have 173 freckles on your back and shoulders, you used to sneak into libraries and steal a book for you and Sam, you don’t eat the crusts on your toast or sandwiches, when you were 6 you chipped a tooth trying to rescue a cat from a tree, and you wanted to be a firefighter when you grew up to save families from going through what you went through.”
Each learned many things about the other. The kinds of music they like, hobbies, pets, favorite foods, and all kinds of weird things they discovered they had in common. Of course, Charlie teases Dean mercilessly and makes all kinds of suggestive gestures when Castiel isn't looking. That said, Dean prefers times when he can be alone — that is, alone with Castiel — without the additional presence of his annoying best friend.
It only takes a minute for Dean to finally grab the condom, bringing the foil packet closer to the table before reaching for the button on his jeans. They slide off your hips with ease, wrinkling around your ankles and then being pulled back. Which leaves him standing alone in a pair of heart-print boxers, but he ditchs them quickly, cursing the fact that it was Charlie's laundry day and so he didn't.
Almost every day he watches him walking the aisles with several books in his arms and pushing the glasses with his fingers as they slide off the bridge of his nose. He's shorter than Dean by a few inches, and he loves that he can sometimes glimpse the skin on his neck and beyond his shoulders when he's wearing a garment several sizes larger. He has soft black hair, and blue eyes that narrow slightly at the same time as his lips are even more perfect when drawing one of his cute little smiles ...
Because Dean also liked to frequent the library because of a particular librarian. They call him Castiel, he works shifts on the second floor and is also a sophomore.
Castiel is about to take a sip of his latte when he is enthusiastically handed the headphones and almost spits out his drink, laughing as Dean snatches it from his hands and places the headphones on his head. The song flows better now that the issue is resolved and Castiel nods in approval, before removing the headphones, smiling at Dean.
Castiel's eyes are still wide, but he keeps quiet. There's no use making a fuss. He pulls off Dean's finger but stays close, sighing.
"And…" Dean raises his arms, letting Castiel pull the black shirt off, pulling it over his head. "What are we going to do with all these tables?" Castiel laughs lightly and tosses the shirt aside.
Slowly, and stifling a groan, he stands up, carrying his backpack that he had been using as a makeshift pillow. It is so quiet that you can even hear your own breathing as you go down the stairs. On the first floor, there is a fluffy head of dark hair that moves around the computer area, turning off the monitors as it passes.
Encouraging himself, Dean gives it to him. Every quick movement of his hips shakes Castiel's body on the table, and Dean has to hold him in place, fucking him faster, harder, harder. It takes all his concentration not to come in that moment, especially with how hot and tight Castiel's insides are, how he jerks in his hands every time Dean's thighs bang against his skin. And that fucking choker. It looks even darker against Castiel's skin in the gloom, seeing the beads of sweat trapped under the librarian's collarbone.
"Welcome back," Castiel says, sitting at the end of the table and reaching for the backpack in the hands of Dean, who shakes his head out of his reverie. It should be illegal for someone to be so cute and attractive at the same time.
"What do you want?" Dean asks, he doesn't want to ruin it again and do something that Castiel might not want.
And it's true. When Dean spares a brief glance, a serious mistake by the way, Castiel finds himself crouched over the pile of books scattered on the floor, perfectly showing off his cute butt courtesy of some very well-fitting dark blue jeans. Cursing under his breath, Dean shifted lightly in his chair before getting up and walking slowly over to the librarian.
"Yeah, in a bit, but I want to stay here, it's more fun." A small smile adorns her lips and under the table she crosses one leg over the other. "Should I talk to him for you?"
She has pretty good vision, so Charlie can see the librarian looking down at his desk from his position behind one of the bookshelves. Then she refocuses on Dean.
"So… I was thinking," Dean begins, to change the subject. "Why don't you come to work with me tonight after you close?"
A few hours pass, and then Charlie and Sam come down the stairs together, both with backpacks slung over their shoulders. Charlie sees Castiel but only raises his eyebrows. After signaling Charlie to move on, Sam heads toward the reception.
So the librarian stays on the first floor at the front desk - something he doesn't really like because Dean isn't there, but at least he can do his homework with ease - for most of the day, but makes sure to keep an eye out for anything. figure with blonde hair trying to get out of the library.
"Okay," Charlie sighs dramatically, her voice muffled. "I know when someone really doesn't love me."
"I think you just need to wrap the music around the chorus to complement the lyrics. But I think it's perfect, ”he murmurs at the end, handing the headphones back to him. "Most of your compositions are ..."
Dean smiles in response and leans forward enthusiastically, invading Castiel's personal space as he fixes up the, according to him, troublesome section of the track. Castiel's earlier compliment is said right over his hair without realizing it and he doesn't even notice how close they are now, their legs brushing under the table.
For the first time in nearly twenty-four hours, Dean feels something close to relief swiftly flooding into him. He drops his backpack on the ground without thinking, and then takes a step forward to bridge the gap between their bodies.
It's nice how easily Castiel is able to interact with them, slowly beginning to make his way through Dean's eccentric life. But everything happens in such a natural way, that sometimes Dean has to stop for a moment and remember that there was a time when it was not so easy to joke and talk with Castiel.
"Oh God, oh God, I didn't clean the table." Nobody cleaned the table. They are sitting at the table where we had sex ...
So now, and just to be an annoying girl who likes to have fun at the cost of her best friend's suffering, Charlie decides to start making a bit of a fuss; he chews his food audibly, slams his textbooks against the table and other things to make as much noise as possible to draw Castiel's attention to his table.
Dean ends up venturing to the bathroom to find some paper towels, but not before putting on his boxers and pants. He would have simply felt too exposed and scared walking back and forth in the library looking for something to clean the semen and lubricant from Castiel's skin.
As usual, Dean stays until closing time, dozing on the surface of his table, snoring softly, until a hand on his shoulder awakens him.
You have to relax, ”Dean mutters under his breath, biting his lip as he watches Castiel tighten around his digit.
Dean takes the cup, savoring the warmth between his palms for a brief moment. After a few sips, Dean feels much more awake than before and rushes to get his laptop out.
Castiel almost screams the moment Dean's cock hits that spot inside of him and his hand curls tighter into Dean's hair, his body arches and his breathing quickens. The table sways slightly next to them and Castiel's other arm grabs onto one of Dean's shoulders, pulling him closer. The rhythm is lost for a second as they readjust their position, Castiel with his arms wrapping around Dean's shoulders and his legs wrapping tightly around his waist.
"Where is Cas?" She murmurs, nudging Dean's head with one finger until he curses and pushes on Charlie's arm. Slightly offended, Charlie snorts and walks away from him, deciding to annoy Sam instead.
"I like you," he blurts out, and that catches Dean's attention immediately. Castiel still keeps his grip on Dean's wrist but his voice escapes in a silent whisper " A lot. I like you so much."
There is a rumble in Dean's chest that resembles a laugh and then he is moving again, still at a languid rhythm, his thumbs digging into the curve of Castiel's waist to keep him still with each swing of his hips towards him. the opposite.
It doesn't take long for him to collect his things, he's already packing everything in his backpack when he hears footsteps on the stairs behind him. It's Castiel, who looks as soft and cute as ever. Today he is wearing another sweater. This one has black and white stripes, and Dean almost chokes on his own tongue when he sees the strip of black cloth, a choker, encircling the base of Cas's throat.
"But you already knew that, of course." He sighs and holds the bridge of his nose between his fingers. You are avoiding it. I guess it has something to do with my brother arriving last night looking like a beaten dog.
Castiel seems tired, more physically due to all the work carrying books that he did during the day. However, he holds two Starbucks cups in his hands, one of them undoubtedly reserved for Dean.
Dean nearly tripped over his own backpack on his way back to his table with Cas's arms full, helping him gently set the edge with a low growl.
After gathering his things, Dean follows Castiel downstairs, waiting for him to close the doors as usual. Castiel takes the keys out of his pockets and successfully closes all the doors with Dean waiting behind him. When he's done, Castiel puts his keys away and his hands itch under his sweater in discomfort when they start to walk.
Dean finally slides in with a low growl, and a firm grip on Castiel's hips that allows him to easily sink inward, his nails digging into the skin. Panting, he knows Castiel needs time to adjust, judging by the little whimper and the way the back of Castiel's head presses against the table, arching against the wood.
Dean laughs a little, mostly because he doesn't know what else to do. " well. Should have asked or ... I don't know, I shouldn't have. Now everything is weird between us and I don't like it. If you want ... we can pretend nothing happened. It's okay."
"I know," Castiel says, as he slides a book into one of the spaces on a shelf to his left. "... Excuse me, that must have sounded creepy." He smiles slightly and Dean stares at Castiel's lips for too long. "You make music, right?"
Charlie is a good friend, or at least most of the time, but in Dean's opinion she is too conspicuous for his liking. Like now, as he watches her waving her hands and earning several looks, as if Dean couldn't see them. There is a more or less hidden table on the second floor of the library, near the history section, which they quickly turned into their unofficial meeting place.
He did not sleep at all throughout the night. He turned and twisted around the covers, repeating the event from the night before over and over in her head. A part of him doesn't even want to get in, but the strongest and most stubborn part of him is forcing him through. Charlie and Sam are already waiting for him at their table on the second floor, but Castiel is nowhere to be found. In no mood for Charlie's shenanigans, Dean quickly puts on his headphones and digs into his notes.
Castiel opens the book in his hands and holds it in the palm of one hand while gesturing for Dean to approach with a finger. They are hidden by the book now, their noses brushing.
"You never know when you could sleep with someone after work?" He scoffs, kissing the taller one on the lips. "Not that the idea of doing it on a table bothers me, but don't you prefer a bed for the first time?"
You missed it, ”Charlie continues, totally oblivious to the fact that Dean prefers not to talk about it. "he was tidying up some books on the bottom shelves and seriously, his cute butt-"...
Sometimes Castiel is not there, but most of the time, Dean sleeps until the last student disappears, and has a habit of waiting for Castiel while he closes the library, then walks with him down the street until they separate and each one goes to their respective bedrooms.
Castiel's eyes close in the last seconds of his orgasm and he moans shakily when their foreheads are pressed together. They just stand there, their limbs tangled with each other in their post-orgasm, their lips pressing soft kisses to each other's hot skin.
Castiel finally successfully pulls out an aluminum package and a small plastic bottle. He lowers his backpack and leans it against the foot of one of the chairs, putting everything else aside.
"I'm sorry," he murmurs, averting his eyes quickly. This is not the time to think about how the sleeves of Castiel's oversized sweater cover his hands to the tips of his fingers making him look adorable. "I'm gonna go. I didn't expect to stay so late."
And when Dean pushes the first finger, Castiel's back arches over the table, but the opposite holds it firmly with his free hand, resting the palm of his hand on his belly.
Castiel is rummaging through his backpack, but stops for a moment to tilt his head slightly to the side, not understanding.
Castiel feels a blush spread across his cheeks and he looks away from the other quickly, exhaling a sigh.
He briefly nods to Dean and Charlie before leaving and disappearing behind one of the bookshelves, going downstairs before checking in and starting work.
"I mean…" Dean can feel the tips of his ears redden. "The position. I'm fine with anything, just so you know."
The file takes a second to load and Dean hands him the headphones when Castiel sits next to him, who blushes slightly as he settles into the chair next to him. He sets his glass on the table to receive the headphones and places them on his head before clicking the play button, leaning back in his chair while listening to the track.
Attention that of course, does not go unnoticed in the eyes of his brother and best friend. Especially Charlie, who repeatedly caught Dean and the librarian peeping at each other when the other didn't. But those are details for later.
Castiel's fingers grip the edges of the table and he squeezes Dean inside out of inertia. It takes him a few seconds to relax, but when he finally shuffles, rocking his hips under Dean, Dean takes it as a cue to start moving. He retreats slowly, his eyes fixed on where his cock opens Castiel astonishingly, letting out a slow sigh at the needy noises the boy makes below him.
Castiel places one of the books on the shelf before picking up another science fiction children's book, and he just smiles.
Eight classes, plus his temporary occupation in one of the labs - courtesy of Lisa, who didn't stop bothering him until he agreed to help her with one of her ridiculous projects - and a part-time job as a music mixer for the host of the night show at the university radio. Which meant he didn't have enough time for one of the most important physiological needs: sleep.
A somewhat awkward silence is floating in the air and Castiel clears his throat just once when they are almost done.
"You know what they say about the quiet-" what the fuck is wrong with you? Dean kicks himself internally. It was enough with a brief exchange of words for Castiel to get through the cool, fuck you attitude he had adopted since high school. "Well, I'll stop bothering you. You seem to be quite busy."
It turns out that Dean was able to take Castiel up to his bedroom and after a —mini— make-out session, they broke up and promised to meet again tomorrow at their regular meeting place in the library.The next day, Castiel feels the pain of playing on the hard wooden table, but does not complain; After all, he was the one who prompted Dean — in a way — but the thrill of seeing the opposite is what prompts him to enter the library in the afternoon after school.
And that's all Castiel wants to hear, so he doesn't think about it anymore before leaning forward and finally pressing their lips together.
It's easy for Dean to take care of him, muttering praise and nibbling everywhere, except where Castiel yearns for it the most, who despite this, receives satisfied teasing on his skin, leaving light marks and pulling whimpers from his mouth until he has him writhing over the table in frustration. Pink and faint purple markings cover his thighs where Dean traces a path with his tongue each time it runs over the skin, brushing it with his teeth from time to time. Castiel gasps and is already eager for more.
And Charlie quickly picks up on the change, because it's too obvious that they like each other. He sees them exchange glances as Castiel passes by their table, and Dean glances at the librarian wherever he goes.
Both Charlie and Dean turn their heads to find the source of the voice and, just a few steps away, is Castiel, with the glasses placed on his head - Dean learned that they were only reading glasses and that Castiel can see perfectly well without them—, a glass of coffee in his hands and Dean sees that it is from the Starbucks right next to the library.
The librarian nods slightly in understanding, moving away from the table and heading towards the reception. He stretches one hand to the side, reaching for a set of keys and twirling them around his finger.
An explosion of color explodes behind Castiel's eyelids, who does nothing to avoid wrapping his arms around Dean's neck to pull him closer, feeling his back slap firmly against the bookshelf behind him. Dean can't control himself this time, allowing his own fingertips to cling to Castiel's sweater as his tongue works its way into the other's mouth after a mischievous bite of his lower lip.
"A lot huh?" He repeats, letting a tentative smile play on his lips. "Enough to let me kiss you again?"
The condom rolls up easily, and Dean hooks Castiel's legs over his arms, spreading them out and rolling his hips so that the head of his penis just touches Cas's hole. Who holds his breath when Dean rubs against him gently and his arms reach out trying to hold on to either side of the table. There is a mischievous glint in his eyes when he fixes on the boy below him.
Castiel curses under his breath, straightening up and readjusting his glasses with one of his hands, while the other rubs his head in the area of the hit. He turns around and blinks, staring at Dean's hair for an instant before looking down and their eyes meeting.
He looks up when he hears Charlie's loud voice from across the room and almost drops his books, and his glasses, when he sees the duo of Charlie and Sam at the table. His eyes widen and he begins to stutter into a gasp.
"God, better than I could have imagined. I could spend the rest of the night between your thighs" —and to prove his point, Dean ducks down again, trailing open-mouthed kisses just above Castiel's left knee and continues to move upward. A laugh bubbles from Cas's throat.
"Charlie," Dean growls, slamming one of his palms over Charlie's algebra textbook, pinning it in place. "I swear to you, if you don't sit down and-"
Castiel does not have his glasses on, and they are not on his head. It's not unusual for Dean to see them, but he can see the blue color of their eyes more clearly when he gets closer.
"I'd like to be downstairs, at least this time," he whispers, moving his hands toward the back of the choker to remove it.
Less talking… ”Dean interrupts, grabbing the condom and tearing the paper with his teeth. "And more of those nice noises, okay?"
Castiel doesn't move his fingers away, and he doesn't withdraw his when Dean finally speaks, maybe he should, but neither of them are pulling away. They both get a few inches closer without realizing it, and Castiel tastes the taste of coffee on Dean's lips when they kiss.
Despite Dean's caution, Castiel seems surprised to hear the sudden voice behind him, because he tries to get up and inevitably hits his head against the top shelf.
"Yeah…" Dean stands between Cas's spread legs, slowly slipping his fingers under the soft fabric. "The sweater too."
"Charlie, I swear to God…" Dean threatens, but the sentence is interrupted by a muffled noise from his own lips, as a familiar, black-haired figure walks to circle one of the nearby shelves.
Dean can feel the tips of his ears starting to redden, so he just hides his face in his arms on the table. Charlie is a good friend, but sometimes he really hates her.
"Shit," Dean hisses, flopping into one of the remaining chairs, tossing his backpack to the floor. It's a library, Charlie. You are supposed to be silent.
Cas didn’t watch the news. So it wasn’t until Dean’s seventh dark haired, blue eyed kill that he finally heard something about it.
Dean nodded, it was the first time Nick called him by his actual name. “I know, Nick. I’m not turning him in, you have my word. But we have to figure out how bad the problem is, before we can help it.”
Dean scowled at his too-bright phone screen. His brother Sam had just informed him that their father had died - big deal, the guy’d been on death’s doorstep since Dean was a toddler, and Dean could count on one hand the amount of times he’d seen him in his entire life. The news certainly wasn’t worth waking up to, but then again… was
Something primal wakes up in Cas at that, and he can't stop himself from yanking Dean’s head forward and burying himself deep. But he has other plans, and those plans will
"You've been the best part of my life. I don't know who chose who, I'm just glad it happened." Dean slid a second finger into Cas and worked him open slowly, carefully, like he should've been doing the entire time. There would be enough pain in the hours to follow, they didn't need to choose it now. His lips ghosted over Cas' jaw and he marveled at the hard line of it, the way it dipped down into his throat and invited him in.
too fucking much. He stumbled out of his room past noon to puke and managed a shower soon after, feeling
Cas growled and pulled out, thrusting back in. He let go of Dean’s shoulder to squeeze his hips with a bruising grip, fucking into Dean like this
Cas sucked the head into his mouth and slid down painfully slowly. Dean expected him to stop once he felt his throat contract, but instead, Cas kept going until his nose pressed against Dean’s pelvis.
“I know... I know. I want it, Cas. I want you inside of me.” There isn’t an ounce of doubt in his words, and he runs a hand through Cas’ hair. “Just a little nervous.”
Not when it wasn’t for money. When he was picked up by a random hot guy and fucked in their car for the hell of it, he’d forget sometimes. But he’d always make his way to Planned Parenthood soon after and so far, he’s only caught the curable ones. He thinks it’s worked out in his favor.
it’s that damn good’? It’s like that. Feeling unbelievably full as someone fucks into your prostate like it’s their damn life’s work to make you come, the stretch and burn of your partner’s arousal. Then there’s the soreness after the fact, that reminds you of
Dean played like his life was on the line the second game, and it only took him three turns to finish the game. Maybe he shouldn’t have made such a complete 180, but the first game took longer than he wanted it to and he desperately needed to get back to the safety of solitude. He wasn’t worried about Cas, he’d marked a couple of chicks so there was virtually nothing dangerous about that, but they were still in a sketchy bar and were technically wanted men. He quickly collected his winnings, but the men were angry. They’d finally worked out that they’d been hustled, so Dean put on his best charming smile as the two beefy men tried to corner him. “Listen, fellas. I told ya it was just my lucky night. You guys might’ve won, but this one,” Dean took a moment to poke the smaller one in the chest, “kept staring at
Cas grabbed Dean’s hips and brought him in, closing the distance and instantly flipping the tables on Dean. “Baby you couldn’t handle
Dean attempts to laugh and downplay it but really, he’s just too damn tired. “Will you go with me tomorrow?”
Castiel look like. It took everything not to ask. He wanted to, but he also wasn’t sure if he was ready for that step. Things were… great. He didn’t need a photo to know he liked Cas’ company. Okay, company was a stretch, but he liked talking to the guy, probably more than anyone else right now. He was new and exciting and…
It didn’t take good people skills to see how much Dean tensed before he spoke. “Oh man. Uh…” Dean scratched the back of his head and blushed.
“Don’t be so hard on Nick. He was freaking out the whole time we were looking for you. And if you hadn’t gone on a little
have been coming from his chest. Dean could barely fucking think, that was hands down the best hummer he’d ever gotten, and he was already starting to think he’d been wrong about one not turning him gay.
For the first time, the last thing on Dean’s mind was getting off. He wanted to savor every second of being inside of Cas, so his thrusts were measured and patient. Dean fought against Cas’ insistent legs, forcing himself to keep his steady rhythm.
sick of, but Cas just broke up with his boyfriend and they had been friends for just too damn long at this point.
Dean pinned Cas to him for a moment after the kiss was broken. “Cas... you ran off last time. Don’t do it again.”
“No one is talking about Dean. I’m my own person with my own goddamn feelings!” His voice rose as he went on. “I’m just fucking hot!” Cas slammed his favorite mug down on the counter, hard enough to crack the bottom, prompting a slow drip of coffee. The second he noticed it was broken tipped the scales. “Fuck!!” He slammed it again, shattering it into the sink.
Cas kisses him again, then wraps his arms around him. “Yes. Absolutely yes, I will go on a date with you.”
Those four months flew by and Cas had his fair share of shitty doms. Thankfully he only needed that fix every few weeks. But by now, he realized nothing could ever cure that craving.
“I’m so proud of you, Cas.” Dean played with Cas’ hair absentmindedly, happy that he could finally feel like Michael wouldn’t be an issue anymore.
“Castiel!” Dean leaned in and bit his shoulder hard as he came, the rusty tang of Cas’ blood hitting the air and his tongue. He kept thrusting, milking himself dry inside of the angel that changed everything. Cas threw his head back in bliss, coming hard on the shower wall as soon as Dean’s teeth locked onto him.
to be loved. Desperate for attention that you came here, to this murder shack because I gave you a few smiles. You were so quick to believe that your knight in shining armor had come along after all the abuse you endured from Eric. It’s obvious why
“Yeah... the other thing, asshat.” Dean chuckles and scoots over. “I know you said you loved everyone, but we know you meant me more.” He straddles him and nods at the door. “Mojo us to the hood.”
David arched away from Cas’ touch and his face turned a brilliant shade of red as he shook his head, keeping his eyes glued to where Eric was quickly slipping from consciousness. “No, don’t - don’t touch me!”
Dean pulled Cas’ head down further and buried himself deep, holding him there as he humped his face. “Fuck, got me close already. Gonna swallow for me, baby? You like when my come runs down your throat?”
“That come. That’s all.” He laughed, making light of the situation. “Maybe we can have that conversation after some sleep.”
his strong suit but Cas learning about it all has actually taught Dean as well, so everything was running smooth.
“I love that you feel so protective and possessive over me. It makes me feel... special. For the first time in my life, someone cares for me, and I care for them. I care so much, that dying with you sounds like a fairytale ending to this shit show. As long as we’re together”
Cas took a deep breath and climbed into bed with Dean. They didn’t talk that night, there just weren’t words to say but eventually, they both fell asleep.
Castiel rolled his eyes and ripped the page out, crumbling it with a glare. “Whole thing was shit anyway.”
hate. “I know better than all of you. And this isn’t mandatory, Cas. If you don’t like who I paired you with, you don’t have to sleep with them. We still like consent, y’know.”
Dean’s breathing quickened minutely as he considered his options, drawing out the silence and what little bit of space there was between them. He’d been charismatic before, charming even. He knew how to say whatever he needed to in order to get what he wanted, it was how he’d gotten so far without making mistakes. So he’d misjudged this one, it didn’t mean he couldn’t see it though to the end. He allowed his eyes to soften as he stared at Castiel’s mouth, the picture perfect image of someone that’s looking at someone
Michael growled and shifted so he was on his back, and Cas went to work sucking him off quick and dirty. He wasn’t turned on himself anymore, but Cas could fake it with the best of them when needed, and even when he wasn’t in the mood he still loved making men as big as Michael squirm like that.
“Were you going to sit out here all day?” Nick asked abrasively while holding the door open and ushering Dean inside.
He knew there would be a lot of gay guys at this party, Charlie seemed to be a gay magnet that attracted all the hottest dudes
aspect, so you not using words would be a problem." Cas watches the door, waiting for their turn to be called back — and Dean thinks about that for a few moments.
“Aw, you’d send me happiness? And all I brought was candy.” Dean looked over and met his eyes. “I’d come over and Accio all your crap for you.”
Cas stopped bouncing and turned around again, moving his hips slowly on Michael and kissing him sensually. “Take me upstairs.” He whispered into his ear. And Michael didn’t have to be told twice. He stood without even moving Cas off and carried him to the stairs.
“Mmhmm...” He pulled off. “The blindfold was your line, not mine.” He swallowed him down, deep throating him and humming again like this was his favorite fucking pasttime.
Dean was a ball of nervous, chaotic energy as he followed Cas to his apartment. He had no idea what he was going to find, or do, or say. He couldn't kill him there unless he managed to make it look like an accident, but... he'd known that when he'd asked. He'd known he wasn't going to kill him since their encounter at the church. The pep talks he'd given himself over the last six months were just an excuse to get back here, to get back to his angel. He parked his car next to Cas' when they arrived and got out a little too quickly, like he was over eager to get Cas alone again. Maybe he was. It changed nothing.
For the following five months, Castiel was paid to be used and abused and he soon realized he couldn’t get off without it. But none of it was like it had been with Dean. The latest guy had the same look in his eyes at times, but he was more... violent for the sake of being violent. He wouldn’t get off unless he knew Cas was uncomfortable and he dropped after every encounter with him. This last time left him with rope burns on his wrists and ankles, but thankfully it was cool enough outside to stay covered up. He had two cigarette burns on his chest and a gash from a whip on his back before he finally decided he would never go back to that guy again, he was beginning to worry no one in the world would fill the hole Dean left behind.
Dean had hung out with Cas again after that, it was almost like burgers and beer were becoming as much of a habit as the blowjobs themselves. Dean wasn't going to complain, he was getting fed and having better orgasms than he ever had in his whole life - but dealing with Carmen after was becoming… tricky.
“What’s in that bag son?” the man asked. Before opening the door and moving aside, he stepped forward and touched Dean’s chin to look into his eyes. “You’re going to be harder than this one aren’t you? But you will cry. They always do.” Cas looked away ashamed and clenched his fists.
With a grunt, Cas tips his head back. "Dean... ride me. I... fuck, I wanted so much more, but I can't... can't wait..." He grips Dean's hips and lifts him up, then he sinks down without hesitation, moaning so loud the rest of the house was sure to hear.
Cas froze, missing his cue to swing. The thought of having Dean’s hands on him shouldn’t be as enticing as it actually was, but Cas blamed the tequila. Heat pooled in his gut and he bit his lip, releasing it slowly. “You can’t do both. Pick one; help me or try to beat me.”
Hours pass before another nurse comes in to check on him, and by this time Cas is resting his forehead against that lifeless hand. When they tell him Dean’s next of kin is on the way, he takes the time to kiss every finger on that hand. He smells it, but the smell of Dean is already fading away. It smells like hospital…
“We're having issues communicating,” Cas explains. “He doesn't like to use his words, I don't like not knowing what's going on in that insanely gorgeous head of his. I haven't asked him to marry me quite yet,” he adds with a playful smile.
“Yeah, I love you too, Harry.” Dean winked at Charlie, and she flipped him off in response as she disappeared into her room.
“The wedding isn't for another week, Dean,” Cas says fondly, and he's smiling so damn wide that when he tries to kiss Dean, it's almost all teeth. “You don't have to lay it on so thick, I've been in love with you since the day we met.”
You said that, remember?” Cas felt like the walls were closing in, he couldn’t breathe. “I’ll fucking stab all these motherfuckers if you make me. Fuck your
Dean stretched Cas open with every ounce of reverence that he’d shown him before, moving his fingers inside of him slowly and kissing away every gasp and impatient groan he drew from his angel. “Shh, we don’t want the others to know what we’re doing, we’ve got the only bottle of lube, remember?” He kissed the bridge of Cas’ nose as he inserted another finger, and it occurred to him that it didn’t
“Alright. And I like my partners to tell me I’m perfect every day, I get the vibe you won’t do that.” It’s a joke... but only partly — he really does love praise.
Cas narrowed his eyes, taking another step forward. “I don’t like owing people.” His voice was low and his eyes shifted to where his brother was watching them. Nick took a step forward, seeing the tension in his brothers shoulders but relaxed when Cas shook his head.
Castiel spoke for the first time, his voice small and weak. “Of course.” He touched Dean’s hand and closed his eyes.
Jask comes first, his loud moan echoing as the sound of his hips slamming against Ares’ ass get louder, and Ares follows shortly after. Cas squirms from the sound — something about knowing their best friends just fucked next to them has Cas pulsing, making that glowing condom jump. “Dean,” he moans. “Touch me.”
The man’s scream echoed through the steel mill and Dean stuck his finger in his ear, wiggling it and making a face. “Fuck, that was irritating.”
If he wasn’t visibly struggling, Dean wouldn’t bite, but Cas needed this distraction. “Yeah, of course I do.”
Cas instantly kissed back with the same intensity as he buckled Dean’s pants back up for him. A manager started banging on the door, telling them to leave and Cas pulled back giggling like a little kid. “You’re going to get me kicked out of this town.”
Cas smiled, “At least I’d get laid in jail.” Nick doesn’t find that joke very funny. Cas has actually never had trouble getting laid, he just hasn’t tried as of late but he was getting some tonight, even if it
Ares takes the condom and busts up laughing, tossing it at Cas and then grabbing another. “Well mine isn’t either now, you two really are too gorgeous to be humans.”
In no mood to stall if Dean thought he could handle it, Cas hastily stuffed in a second finger and began to scissor them, twisting as his other hand explored Dean’s skin then dipped back down to keep the fabric out of his way.
“Fine.” Nick looked around nervously and climbed in. “I’m taking him lunch, fucker won’t eat unless he’s reminded sometimes.”
Cas whimpers as he shoves his jeans and boxers down and takes his first look at Dean’s throbbing member. “Fuck…” he laps at the tip, his eyes closing in bliss and he suddenly can’t decide what he wants. He wants to suck every drop of come from Dean’s balls until he’s shoving him away but he also wants to bounce on this long thick cock until he’s coming all over Dean’s stomach untouched. He dives in, unable to hold back anymore.
But I’m nowhere near that, baby.” He could hardly talk but he was still very much here for this. “Mark me yours.”
matter, is that he basically just set himself up for the perfect opportunity to say something he’d never otherwise have the courage to say. “You’re on.” Cas took another quick swig of tequila and tossed Dean one of the controllers.
“Oh yeah. He offered to come back on Monday.” She laughed. “He came at the exact moment you did, it was crazy to watch. It was like the taste of you pushed him over the edge. I knew he liked sucking dick, but damn.”
Cas’ legs tightened as he gripped the couch, his plump, bottom lip was tight between his teeth. He didn’t say anything, but Dean could feel he was pleased.
Cas catches Charlie watching them and rolls his eyes slightly, even as relief floods his system. “Not at all, Cap. So then—” he raises his shot glass higher “— to not being disappointed.”
Nick huffed a laugh and ran a hand through his hair, making Dean think of Cas. “He didn’t tell me anything, I just assumed. And when you didn’t text back I felt my assumptions were correct.”
Cas to believe that wasn’t a good sign. He’s obviously flirting back but maybe he just likes the game. Maybe he doesn’t actually want Cas in that way because to him, Cas is just a low life on the streets.
The moan Cas lets out can probably be heard throughout the house, but he doesn't care. Dean’s tongue is better than any fantasy. “Dean… so good. That's it… little deeper.” He fists a hand in Dean’s hair and gasps as the head of his cock dips into his tight throat. “Shit.”
Cas glanced up from the soup he was very obviously forcing down. “Um… no I don’t.” He set his spoon. “To be fair, you don’t talk about yours either.
“Fuck, you’re beautiful. Holy shit.” Dean pressed up against the back of Cas’ throat and punched out a moan, holding his hips still and watching Cas’ ass wiggle.
end up regretting.” He smiled just enough to show Cas he understood why this was happening and that he supported him in the only way he knew how... silently, and with an attitude.
Dean’s hand slid down to Cas’ cock and he stroked lazily, halting his hips so he could enjoy it for as long as possible. “So stay more often. Every damn day, I don’t care. If this is what I’ll get after work, I’ll take it.” He nipped just below Cas’ ear. “Kiss me.”
They were pretty much inseparable, especially because Michael was no longer trying to take up all of Cas’ attention. He still couldn’t believe Dean agreed to wrestle Michael in the first place, but every time Cas caught a glimpse of Dean’s shiner, he’d grin from ear to ear. Finally, somebody knew exactly who he was, and still fought for him.
it to goddamn happen!” Dean’s adrenaline was coursing through his veins and making him lightheaded as he sped out of town, his eyes half glued to the rapidly sinking needle on the gas gauge.
He decided to pretend like he never talked to Carmen about it or looked through her messages, just to see what Cas would say.
That hand was huge, wrapping easily around his girth and Dean immediately realized he’d made a huge mistake by agreeing to the no-hands policy. “Goddamnit, you’re mean.”
He felt the loss immediately and frowned. “I told her the truth. We got in a fight and she gave me an out... and I took it.”
Cas scoffed. “How do you think I survived as a teenager on the street? Yeah I did the other stuff but I was
Truthfully, he’s not mad at Dean at all — he knows he sucks at beer pong, but that’s not the only thing he’s about to suck. Cas tugs him into the bathroom and slams the door, then instantly drops to his knees. “Give me it.”
Cas rolled his eyes, “Fuck that guy. Can we go?” Cas moved his legs, only to discover his catheter, “What the fuck did they do to my dick!?”
“You’re perfect, Cas. So damn perfect.” Dean fights off his orgasm and enjoys his fiancé’s ass. It squeezes in all the right places and no one and nothing could convince him that they weren’t made for each other.
Cas moaned, loving how full Dean made him feel whether it was his mouth or his ass. He let Dean slide in at his own pace, sucking more with each inch.
“Yeah I... I like that idea.” Cas smiled, feeling better already. He squeezed Dean’s hand affectionately.
He had been teased more than a few times for being too punctual, and was trying not to be so damn predictable. Cas had planned on pressing the submit button at 4:59pm on the dot, just to see if anyone would notice, and now here he was staring down at his
Cas chuckled. “I’m a virgin.” He deadpanned. “Although, I’ve only ever topped so technically, my ass
If the pain wasn’t enough to send Dean over, the sight of his blood on his angel’s face and the admission that Cas wanted him the same way he wanted Cas sure was. Dean cussed loudly and gripped his angel’s hips, slamming up into him and coming in violent spurts.
Cas cries before he finds the strength to enter his room, but when he finally does, his world shatters.
A stupid, insane idea comes to Cas’ mind, and then leaves his lips before he can gather enough good sense to stop it. “We could watch together.”
He probably should have asked who Benny even lived with these days, but it didn’t really matter. They didn’t really hang out in the same circles anymore, so he doubted he’d have recognized the names and at the end of the day, he really
the sarcasm in his voice was evident, “there’s a slight change of plans.” He pulled the knife out from his jacket and ran his thumb over the blade. “I’m gonna have to insist you put my angel down.
It took Cas forever to come out of that damn bathroom, and by the time he did, Dean was half ready to spill his guts all over the floor about how it wasn’t just sex, it was Cas’ eyes, his humor, his taste in music and movies and pie and that stupid, incredibly hot thing he did with his eyebrows - but all he managed to get out was, “Hi.”
Cas grinned and got up to go take a piss. When he came back, Dean had put some music on and Castiel decided to look around, pushing all the negative thoughts about the future out of his mind. So,
“Eww. No wanking it in my bathroom. Aunt Dot made breakfast and I’m starving.” She stood up and giggled at the bulge. “Was it someone we know or someone famous? Wait! Clowns or midgets?”
They could hear the sirens off  in the distance, and Dean had to hope he’d kept up with Baby’s engine enough that she could still outrun a couple of backwoods police cruisers. He pulled onto the highway and within moments, his rear view mirror was lit up red and blue. He glanced at Cas. “Together?”
“Just wondering. I know Charlie has been working hard on decorations and shit for the dance, but I wasn’t sure if she would make the game.”
Dean looked down at the blade and dropped it in his lap. "Don't give up on me just yet, Cas. Don't give up on Baby, either." Even as he said the words, he knew it was over. They'd never stop looking for them even if they managed to get away, and every single cop in the US would be looking for the Impala. They'd had a good run, he and Cas. Maybe it was time to go out on
Cas glanced over. He actually hadn’t slept well since they’d left that warehouse. They weren’t careful that day. Cas was sure they would be caught at any time, and it would be
“I don’t? Let me paint a picture, abusive dad? Probably an alcoholic or some kind of addict. Relied on you way too much at a young age, making you grow up faster than any other kid. You probably did most of your brother's raising, right? Was your mother an addict too? Is this some self righteous mission to save someone when you couldn’t save your own parents?” Cas realized he went too far the second Dean’s hands tightened into fists at his side and he awaited the blow that never came.
Their conversation flows as easy as wind in the fall, and when they realize that three hours have passed, it seems like neither want to leave. But Dean’s headache has returned and after exchanging numbers, they say goodbye.
“You’re… hm.” He turned his head to study Dean, his innocently playful expression and the sinful way his legs were spread on the mattress. “You’re Viktor Krum. Talented, get the girl for a while, but generally an all around meathead.”
“There you are.” Michael began to slide Cas’ panties off. “Something over there more important than what’s over here?” He reached between Cas’ cheeks and pulled out the plug and stood.
“This completely fucked out photo of me.” He pulled it off where it was pinned to and walked back over. “You told me you lost it, but here it is, in your murder cave.” Cas grinned and climbed onto Dean’s lap. “It’s in great condition too, it’s almost as if you had a crush on me.” He teased. Dean
Cas smiles softly and kisses him again. "I know, Dean. Right now, you don't have to say it." He rolls off, hurriedly taking off his pants as Dean does the same and grabs a condom and some lube. Cas climbs back on a little too eagerly. "I... had some fun with myself earlier, I should still be pretty open," he admits with a blush.
His parents shared a look but continued smiling. “Well, good to see you again, Dean. I hope you like steak.” Rob gestured to the table.
can make sure he doesn’t fucking die in my goddamn guest room.” Dean stated through gritted teeth as he paced his living room, torn between throwing his phone and actually running across town just to punch Danny. “And you’re a
Running a hand through his hair, Dean sighed. “Okay, okay, I shouldn’t have asked that. I really just want him to know business are interested in him. He can have some legit jobs soon if I could get ahold of him. Here,” Dean handed Nick his card. “Just have him call me.” Dean turned to leave before he put his foot in his mouth
Thirdly, he would just be a better fucking roommate and friend. No one should walk on eggshells for him.
“I don’t know either. I’m amazing. So amazing, I already have burgers on the way.” Dean’s entire face lights up and Cas laughs. “Best thing about 2020 is all the food delivery places now.”
They haven’t had sex. And for the first time since he became an adult, he’s actually nervous to fuck. Not about it being bad — he knows he’s good — he’s worried he will be
“Me too, Dean. I can’t — you’re so —” he moans, starting to bounce as the come spreads on Dean’s cock to make it easier “— big.”
but... I thought maybe you like dudes... I didn’t know exclusively or not, but I’ve never seen you even look at a chick's ass, so...” He shrugged. “I wouldn’t judge you either way.”
“Too much sass in one tent man, shit might implode.” Dean teased as he finished up securing the tent.
“Yes! Ask one more time and I’ll invite Lisa.” That was a low blow, but she knew it would open his eyes to how serious she was about this party.
It’s too much and not enough all at once. He tips his head back, grunting out Dean’s name in staccato as his entire body jerks from the force of the thrusts. Even if he wanted to hold back, he can’t — he reaches down to stroke himself, so hard the contact feels amazing.
and embarrassed the hell out of himself, but he was relieved he caught that slip as he shut himself inside her bathroom to pee.
The cashier rang up the gas. “Just meant that with green eyes and lighter hair, you’re safe from that fucking creep, right? You’re not his type.”
He mouthed the word ‘fuck’ over and over as he closed his eyes and rocked his hips carefully, inching in little by little.
He wasn’t, not at all, but they still had too many hours to go before reaching his bunker in Sioux City and if he didn’t get some
Cas walked closer and kicked him in the face with the heel of his boot, smiling as his nose crunched. “His name
Dean knew he shouldn’t. Knew he should just leave, leave and not look back. But could he? “How bout we get you back to your car and we’ll see what happens, yeah?” He turned the car in the direction of the bar and started driving.
“Yeah? Next time I want you to do something about it.” Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s throat. “Don’t let anyone touch
“I suppose.” Cas holds his shot glass up and smiles slightly, bracing himself for what he’s about to ask. “Are you disappointed?”
Cas chuckled lazily and leaned his head back against Dean’s shoulder. They stayed there a moment, basking in their afterglow, before Dean’s spent cock started to slip out. Cas reached into his pocket and handed Dean the plug.
I have questions. Who the fuck is this Garth Brooks on meth with an eyebrow ring hanging on by a pubic hair, Joe Exotic? And he got TWO straight guys to marry him just with tigers and
I need you to tell me that I’m not overstepping boundaries if I tell you what I’m doing right now, what I’m thinking about…” Cas trailed off, his voice utterly wrecked and his breathing uneven.
Cas laughed, “Why would you assume I had a boyfriend? I’m too young to be tied down.” Cas brought the beer to his lips.
Dean hums a reply, his cock twitching between his knees and Cas can feel the moment his body goes pliant. His eyes flick up to Cas’, the green lost to lust-blown pupils and he gives Cas silent permission to take whatever he wants from him.
It’s almost as though when their stories were being written in the stars, some being higher than even God himself had painted two separate halves of the same whole and said…
Cas grinned and nodded, his swollen lips stretching sinfully across his beautiful face. “You got it, baby.” He took Dean back in his mouth.
feelings for the guy and the way Dean beamed every time he spoke to Cas told her it was already, too late.
That one took Dean a long time to respond to. Cas stared at his phone as the three dots appeared and disappeared and when a simple:
That was the most honest answer he could give. He felt like it was the end, felt like this was goodbye… but he hoped he was wrong. And, the state of the actual world was a concern on his mind as well. You can’t just quarantine 7 billion people and expect things to pick up exactly as they had been, so what was different about this? He knew, to the depths of his being, that life as he knew it was over.
Cas entered the house, relieved to not see anyone downstairs and went straight to the shower, before going back to bed. His thumb hurt from the cut, but even worse, the cloud of depression weighing down on him took a physical toll. He slept for at least a day before Dean tried to talk to him again and when he woke that morning, his muscles ached.
“Nah... you gotta wait a little, baby.” Dean’s hand travels up his thigh and he touches the head of Cas’ cock with his pointer finger. “It’ll be worth it.”
“Because I’m working Cas, and you’re drunk. Not to mention I’ve arrested you. Don’t make me arrest you again Cas, where is Nick?” Dean’s facade was cracking, as much as he tried to fight it, Cas was breaking through.
thing, but we’ll see what happens. I’m stayin’ in a motel right around the corner from the bar.” He followed the directions Cas gave him and then pulled into the diner.
Dean got out of bed and did his morning routine. As he sat at the breakfast table eating cereal, his phone chimed again.
When the doctors come to say it’s time, they’re both completely consumed with the weight of unsaid words. They each hold a hand as Dean fades away, and when the tide comes in, they both refuse to leave.
“Dean... Dean... get on your fucking back!” Cas flipped them in seconds and straddled Dean’s lap. “Lube up your cock.”
to take them. He really wanted to give this a try… but maybe cold turkey wouldn’t work. He was sweating and anxious, if only he had some weed,
He radioed in that he was bringing in two taggers before turning on the engine. “Any chance you guys want to tell me your names?” Dean asked knowing the answer.
The senior camping trip was almost here, and Dean found himself getting more and more excited about it by the day. His dad went overboard with the camping supplies for him and Cole, but Dean was just happy John wasn’t one of the chaperoning parents.
aspects of his life, so Dean’s eyes were glued to the loner in the corner very clearly trying to appear invisible. Cas was talking to him, but he missed the words entirely. “Sorry,
Dean fake gagged as the man walked toward him. “Daddy? Seriously? I ain’t callin’ you that.” He stood his ground as the man walked closer. “C’mon, I want you to hurt me the way you hurt Cas. I know you’re curious to see if you can actually control a man like me.”
Dean had an annoying and dirty day at work and couldn’t wait to go home. He missed Cas like crazy, so when he pulled up and saw Cas standing outside, he couldn’t stop the grin on his face.
. Cas took a moment to check them out, making the guy squirm under his intense gaze. He was good at that, making guys squirm. It also made it very easy to spot a bottom and this green eyed beauty was
anymore? Like his mind is somewhere else? He does that. Now he’s going to obsess over this wall and not talk to anyone until it’s done.” Nick shook his head as Cas dropped the bag he was holding. “He’s a space case.”
Dean hesitated, he shouldn’t do this. But technically he isn’t doing anything… just not stopping something being done to him… right?
“Can you tell we don't have a problem in that department?” Cas asks Cordelia, smiling a little wider before taking a risk and leaning in to kiss Dean one more time.
He grinned widely. "I don't know how I ever survived without you, Cas." Dean knew the only place to get all of those things was a little further away than he'd have been comfortable with, but Cas' enthusiasm was contagious. He took the exit onto the highway and set the GPS for the Walmart just outside of town.
