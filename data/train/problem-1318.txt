“Hence all I could think of, was the last week. So clap along, cheer along if you like. This song about the things I’ve lost in the last seven days”.
Moriarty’s grating voice groaned “Ugh. Why don’t you two just elope for God’s sake?!”
I sell saris for a living. Being observant is a work hazard.
She runs off without a word to JOHN. John looks even more confused but with a slight smile on her face as she watches the tall, beautiful woman run off.
“Classical night Murray? Really?” John said as they walked into the pub.
Maanav who had wandered to the cupboards full of fabric on the wall and was holding a pink fabric shrugged “Not a word”
Jameela latched her trunk shut and opened her window to call down to the car to go away as her phone pinged with a message.
This is not the same, we’re on equal ground. I’m not a Captain anymore and neither is she a soldier. Jameela retorted to that faceless voice silently.
Shanaya barely restrained a tired sigh at the most obvious question in the history of the universe. She removed a rent agreement paper and slid it to him. “My main address on most of my ID documents is my sister’s for the time being. I have already secured an apartment above the shop at 221B Baker Street and will be moving there in two weeks”.
Oh crap, I’m screwed.  Jameela thought.
You could have someone else measure it before it comes to you. Middleman might be more... Competent.
The man dithered about inanely, prattling on about the greatness of all the other facilities his bank had to offer. He offered tea – for the third time and was rebuffed with a decreased degree of politeness from the last two instances of refusal.
"You must have seen a lot of injuries then, violent deaths, been in fatal danger, especially in the last few years"
“Medicine…but why-
John shivered as a gust of wind came in through the window and reached for the remaining cards without speaking.
In my mind, Indian fem!Sherlock has always been  Deepika Padukone-
Shanaya raised her hand to stop the man before he irritated her further with trite condolences “Its fine. Could we get to the matter on hand?”
“You know you could have just called me. I do have a mobile. This was funny and all. But still could do without the dramatics” Jameela said as she took in the presumably mysterious voice on the other end of the phone. The woman stared at her coolly and simply said “Take a seat Dr Watwe”.
Heartbroken and bereaved, even more so when Mary, too left him on this miserable realm without the man he had loved beyond his life, his home, his wife and everything.
"Damn good"
Shanaya drummed her fingers on her thigh, to an invisible beat only she could hear.She sighed with a growing impatience at the asthmatic 50 year old man with a distant wife and resentful children. His desk was dusty, has food stains all over the desk and cluttered with paperwork; clearly a lack of care is not only a contentious issue in his personal life.
“Aaiii” Khushi whined.
It was Jameela's turn to have raised eyebrows "Which one?! Uh.. I think she said something about archenemy. Who the hell is she anyway?! "
zindagi mushkil hi thi, marna bhi mushkil ho gaya"
Jameela laughed a little, still wonderstruck at her. “I’m still wondering, on why someone like you is just running a little Saree shop in the middle of Baker Street of all places?” Jameela asked.
John stifled a fond smile at Sherlock’s unnecessary formality.
Jameela ran upstairs and took out her duffle bag and dumped all of her clothes in it along with her laptop. She zipped the bag up and flung it on the floor as she dragged her black trunk out.
“So you weren’t talking to a girl named… Shreya was it? All through the night?” Sally taunted.
She realized the pain in her shoulder was even worse and her hands were shaking.
God I’d love to back there now instead of milling about with idiots I barely remember from medical school.
Pardon?
Yes.Oh.I went back home and married Victor. Ten
If you count, putting your hands in a gaping hole where skin and bone should be in freezing temperatures while you’re also trying to save a life of someone who wasn’t even aware of the political pissing match between the two countries. To have to treat someone with a child’s first aid kit in a jeep as you shield his body from an angry public who hate your presence there, as fun.
“ Yeah, how could you possibly see all of that in five minutes ?” Jameela asked again.
This is a little more insight into Jameela's mindset and the secrets she hides.
“Mate, I can hear the judgment in your tone. Atleast I haven’t shut myself off from everything except sports and studying for three years coz my high school boyfriend was too scared to acknowledge me.”
Colour, feel, material.
Btw my tumblr is depth-of-loyalty-and-love if you wanna come scream at me about stuff . I'm friendly and I rant a lot at the same time
“Oy! Stop with the jokes about my height you plonker. I’m well big enough to do what is required” John said seemingly indignantly but the huge smile on his face as he gazed lovingly at the love of his two lives belied his words.
“Jammu or Kashmir?”
“Impertinent”
“Oh yes Aniket, nice to see you. “ She smiled politely and shook his hand quickly “How have you been?”
“He’s an arrogant bastard” Sally snarled.
“Its classical music. On a violin.” Murray said with a pleading look at John. John sighed and acquiesced “Fine. Find the girl. I’ll get some drinks. We’re going to need it”.

Not if Mycroft could help it though.
Grenadiers- An Indian Army regiment dating back to the British colonial era. Formerly known as 5th Grenadiers haha. My "sly"call back to the era the SH books were written in.
"Before we married, on our last day we spent apart as per tradition , but she visited me that night to speak to me about something important."
Khuda Hafiz- is bye basically.
“You don’t really seem all that frightening”.
"maut aane tak na aaye , ab jo aaye ho to aai
Suddenly a phone rang from the phone box in the opposite street.
“Um, yeah. Could be fun”. Jameela said as she and Shanaya couldn’t stop staring at each other.
Oh. Unique. Interesting. Possibly dangerous.
Now, how could she get to see the tattoo was the question.
“Me? You’re the one who practically shoved me into your car and drove all the way out here, on the other end of the river”. Mike’s grin didn’t abate as he peeked his head out to survey the audience. John struggled with the zip of the guitar bag. The waitress slash announcer walked off the stage “You’re next cutie. One minute”. She winked at John and walked away, swinging her hips to the appreciative gaze of one out of two men, the other one still cursing the hell out of the zip of the bag.
“Good luck John. Go get ‘em”. Mike clapped his back and shoved him slightly ahead.
“Why not the Bhagalpuri silk one?”
“You could have just let her buy the expensive one you know. Tera faida hoga Na”. The next door medical shop owner Ghazia Sayed said as she entered the shop.
John pushed Sherlock to the side as Mary, shaking with rage and of manic vengeance pointed the gun at John  but before she could do so John pointed his gun at her and shot her exactly where she had shot Sherlock months ago.
When the car reached the road opposite the shop, Jameela flung open the door to walk out.
“And I read your army career in your stance and your brother’s drinking habits through your mobile phone”. Shanaya said smoothly.
Murray looked uneasily at John who nodded slightly “Okay…But I don’t know”.
"Take a seat Doctor and put your legs up. The tea really is a nice soporific" Shanaya said offhandedly as she walked down the stairs.
I thought so. It doesn’t…look like you.
Sambhal cha meri behen, no one wants a repeat of what happened last year right. Definitely not good for your BP. Jameela mentally scolded herself as she typed in Shanaya and “sari shop” in Google.
“For our next act, everyone, we’ve got a first timer on this stage. Please welcome John Watson!” The waitress clapped with more enthusiasm than he thought he warranted- a sentiment echoed by the audience- as by John’s count only five clapped.
In an act of pure desperation and aching love- John asked him to stay. With him.
John and Sherlock sat at the back as Lisa drove. John suddenly felt a paper shoved in his open palm.
“Oh you bastard twat. You told me you lost it!” Murray said.
" We became friends in a certain way, and soon I realised I was deeply in love with her as any man can be. I asked her to marry me and she readily accepted . My family loved her as I did when they met her and celebrated our union with a big wedding in Delhi itself. I know I sound mad and unwise to marry a woman without knowing too much about her past or her origins Ms Hardikar, but I've never regretted one second of it".
"You're a doctor. In fact you're an army doctor", Shanaya said , observing the doctor's stance . She had been riled up at the "not her thing" phrase. Good.
Everyone cheered “Hey! Nice to see you on our side. What are you doing here?” John asked.
Don't ruin this, Jameela reminded herself sternly as she determinedly looked outside or literally anywhere , just not at the absurdly beautiful but remote and mysterious woman next to her.
"So, my bedroom is on the left. Yours is in the right. Mrs Hanglem is making some late night elaichi chai for you . She says it helps to sleep. Help yourself. I'm off " Shanaya announced as she turned and swung her coat over her shoulders.
“Believe me. Yes”.
"Hemish Choudhary. He lives out in Sinhagad."
“My dear fellow. You push very hard for such a diminutive man. I hope my coat isn’t dusty John”. Sherlock said as he grinned at John
Btw the sari details and types I got from various clothing websites. The details about the Bhagalpuri silk sarees from here-
Until now. Jameela smiled a little.
The refusal to acknowledge their relationship. The arguments. The making-up.
“Yeah, I’ve got to study that PBL as well.” Mike said as he unlocked his door and almost tripped over a box on the floor.
" From then the mood in the house has changed ma'am . There's a look in her eyes , it's like she is expecting some other shoe to drop any minute. The look of fear and trepidation in her face and body has not left her and she has not had an easy night's sleep since."
John and Sally looked at each other “We…had to flush it down the toilet”.
“Don’t let me stop you” John said as he walked in with a gun pointed at Moriarty .
“But she said Monday. That leaves her forty eight hours and a reunion party where she could meet some old friend who could have an extra room with her and offer it to her in a pathetic attempt to hit on her and then she would call you because she’s too nice to just text you and with that apologetic and regretful tone she would tell you that she has found a better roommate who wouldn’t play piano at odd hours and dissect her life into fifty thousand parts just because she can and –“ Shanaya realized she had now started speaking out loud breathlessly and  she could hear her heartbeat in her ears as her pulse increased rapidly.
I hope y'all like it.
It was Sherlock Holmes.
Very observant. How did you know I was retired? And it’s J, hn please.
I don’t know why you’re gushing so much Jameela; I mean she clearly is a bit of a lunatic with the whole “I helped convict my landlady’s ex husband thing”, a snide voice in her mind that sounded suspiciously like her grandmother’s said.
Yeah going into the backroom might not have been a good idea.
“Bhaad mein jao” Shanaya laughed at Jameela’s dry chortle as she closed the door behind her.
panditji- priest basically. its usually a term used for holy persons or astrologers or anyone dealing in the religious and mystical sort of thing.
Suddenly she heard the door close behind her and Shanaya walked into the room , Jameela realised that she was wearing a blouse and jeans and had been holding a black long coat in her arms .
zindagi mushkil hi thi, marna bhi mushkil ho gaya"
"It's not just any sari. It has a special design stitched into it which is of great concern to him and his life" Shanaya said as she silently stretched an arm out for the rickshawwala for the upcoming turn. Jameela braced herself against the wall as the rickshaw took a sharp turn to the right.
John stifled a laugh at the analogy “Yeah Mike, come on, it's been two years since we've heard of the famous Stamford brownies. We’ve been waiting for this since freshers’ week. Go on!”
"Āṇi puḍhacyā bilḍiṅgacī gharamālaka tilā mhaṇālā kī tinē saw yellow smoke from Shanaya's flat . But she always had an eye out for Shanaya mhaṇūna mī tilā durlakṣa kēlē- and that landlady of the next building said that she swore she saw yellow smoke come out from her flat ! But she always had an eye out for Shanaya so i ignored her
Just then, Mike knocked on the open door. “John? There’s a call for you. It’s from Harry”.
“I want to bet if I get into his pants before he gets thrown out.”
“Maanav? Maanav Saxena. We went to AFMC together.”
There was something there. A connection. A kindred spirit, something I don’t know. But it was there.
" Yes, of course Jameela. My sister- in- law wanted to name her daughter Jameela but then the pandit ji told her it's a manglik naam and her in laws were very superstitious..." Jameela nodded along and continued to smile in various places, as her mind wandered to where Shanaya had gone.
Shanaya walked through these rooms repeatedly, trying to figure out a pattern that combined them. Black, cotton, intricate thread work. Nope, did that before.
“Aha! So you did pull”. Sally said triumphantly as she laid down a five of hearts and a six and seven of clubs for a straight. “Read em and weep boys”.
Moriarty’s eyes were burning with hatred as his body vibrated unnaturally “This is my story. My hero. My TRIUMPH!” Moriarty screamed as he yelled at Mary -
“So, what’s your name?” John said as he led her to a different, more private table.
Shanaya turned back “Oh did you like it?”
John grinned lazily with heat in his eyes “Wait and find out”
Shanaya looked up from her stitching to see the doctor from the clinic opposite here – (Maanav…… something) with a short long black haired woman in her 30’s, clearly an old medical college friend – going by the talk. Her breath caught at the formal stance and the wary eyes observing the surroundings- Army Doctor. Invalided home from?-
She moved her arms vigorously. Almost there. Finally! Her head broke through to the surface. Gasping, she gulped in essential oxygen as she peered up to the hill. The figure still stood at the edge. She seemed closer to the edge now though. She called out, urging her to jump, but she got no answer.
John stared at Sherlock repeatedly. Even with the streetlight, Sherlock still took his breath away. John inched closer to him until he remembered the green clad woman.
“I’ll get started on the brownies.” Mike said.
“Your phone has tiny scuff marks around the edge. His hands shake when he plugs in his phone every night. Classic sign of alcohol abuse. Plus you have a phone that was clearly a present from his spouse as the inscription says “
“Sally we love you and we’re terrified of you in equal measures. And frankly its time you dumped Anderson’s useless arse.” John rummaged through his pockets and handed her a piece of paper. “She’s bi and likes rugby players. Completely your type”. John joked.
How do you know she would feel the same thing you did?
“You know I prefer to text the delivery people”
Shanaya brought up white, thick border, Bengali printing. Possibility. File away for later.
“John! Little brother!” Harry’s voice slurred.
"Yes, this happened yesterday. But before that, something even more peculiar happened. One of the boys from the property behind mine, had found a piece of cloth nailed to the garden door and had brought it to me. I demanded to know if they had torn it from their mother's saris and used it as a prank, but they denied it. I disposed of it and thought it nothing more than a stupid joke. Until I mentioned it offhandedly to my wife. She got very upset and asked me to tell her if something like this happens again".
Lisa’s face contorted into a smile, but John almost recoiled at the fakeness of it “Sherlock you will be fine. I promise. We’re just here to get some petty revenge. Little things really.” She opened her trunk and handed out sprays “Here take this.”
Maybe this was a bad idea.
on the stage. That was for you. That was about you. If you’re not interested, it’s all fine; I wouldn’t mind being just friends-
John laughed loudly, groaning as a pulse of pain echoed through his head. He gulped down his water and looked at his silver edged watch gifted from his father on his 10th birthday. “I better take a shower.”
A tall man walked onto the stage. As he stepped into the spotlight, John’s eyes were arrested at the ethereally beautiful figure. Blue green eyes, silky curly hair, pale cheekbones as high as the Eiffel Tower.
She opened a drawer and removed the fabric “It’s meant to be handled and touched regularly. Not forgotten in a cupboard and left there to be eaten by moths.”
“Okay. That Italian restaurant is still open-
“But Khushi-
Except that, he never truly loved her. Not the way the stories say. Not with the devotion and passion he had slaving over his stories.
John cut in laughing bitterly “Please Mary. Save your breath. The lies must be exhausting you. First about the nonexistent miscarriage. And now about Moriarty and your
Tera hi Faida hoga-  You will be the one who benefits ( more or less)
The Hardikar siblings have a penchant for the dramatic seriously.
This is by Fani Badauni.
“ You can take your pick of the sari now. I would suggest the red one . It suits you best especially if you have to make a good impression in front of all the stuffy ex college friends you’ll have to face. If you want , I can also do the blouse and fall for you”. Shanaya looked up at her with a superior if –i-must but still somehow half hopeful look at her as she handed Jameela her phone back.
Woooo! I'm alive!!!
Sally stifled a grin which John saw “They weren’t that bad!”
Didn’t think there was a point decorating. Listen, um..I got a job offer in Sheffield.
She swallows a sob as she flops down on her pillow. She stares up at the fan and marks each rotation as she tries to fall asleep again.
“What the fuck happened here?” John exclaimed.
"You mentioned another package?" Shanaya said as she leaned forward from the sofa , her eyes intent on the perturbed husband.
“Go get him” Sally said smiling. “But I’m not doing double dates”. She scowled.
“I’ll charge it up on the way; they installed one in the reception finally. Thanks, Mike”. John said as he walked towards the main door. Mike waved him off.
“He needed witnesses … or an alibi- depending on how it went”. Mike said between bites.
“They can be really mean you know? Especially those jocks.” Sherlock’s voice quavered but he did not take his eyes of Lisa’s face.
Suddenly the door opened again and Shanaya walked back in and leaned against the wall. She took a sweeping look at Jameela, not missing anything.
Jameela went ramrod straight as she surreptitiously reached for her keys in her pocket. It’s not much, but it’s literally all she has as a weapon now.
Maanav chuckled.
“Medicine or Dentistry?” He asked.
"With a sari? At this time of night?" Jameela asked with a disbelieving look.
“You want to bet how long before he gets thrown out?”
I'm so overwhelmed at your response guys. thank you for liking my little fic. I love that you're all loving this.
“Who the fuck did this?” Greg yelled out loudly as he picked up his broken spectacles.
Jameela realised with a bit of a start, that her head was craning so much because Shanaya had stepped achingly close to her.
Yeah. You’re right. Of course you are.
“Good. Rugby player as well, that will do perfectly.” Sherlock Holmes said as the bartender set the beers. He picked up the beers and walked over to the front table.
“Sally, we’ve lost a lot of stuff. We need him”. Greg pleaded.
They just forgot to say they loved each other.
Shanaya's eyebrows were raised again with a challenge in her eyes as she retorted "On the day we met, I told you how I deduced you within mere minutes. That's what I do on hatefully boring days . People come to me with strange designs and codes in saris and other cloth , most of it means nothing, mostly an overzealous tailor leaving behind some mark of his on the sari. But sometimes, saris can be interesting in so many different ways" She finished with relish.
Jameela blushed at the cute little smile Shanaya was still directing at her, damnit! Get a hold of yourself Watwe.
Jameela looked around with a slight frown on her face “ I think it would be best if we do this somewhere … a little less noisy na?” She looked up at the tall woman who furrowed her nose, quite cutely to be honest. Jameela frowned at her errant thoughts and schooled her expression.
Silence falls between the two compatriots. Meanwhile, the noise of the children playing starts to increase as the afternoon becomes evening.
“I didn’t know I saw. I think you should go with a Shree Sanskruti Banarasi silk one for your reunion party. No wait- a Chiffon sari.” “I’ll get the measuring tape, but I think your measurements are pretty obvious, but you can never be too sure” Shanaya mused aloud as she walked into the backroom.
“I think I know someone who can help.”Maanav turned to stand up on the side of the road.
She picked up the sewing needle and continued to stitch the hole that an ignorant delivery man had made while delivering the fabrics to her. Shanaya made a mental note to yell at him as she sat down on the stool to stitch in peace.
God, dissecting family dysfunction was even worse.
“So, uh, there’s a little story with this. When I signed up to sing , I thought I’d just sing something classic- Queen or Metallica. All love songs tell the same love story, whether they’re on a vintage or an electric anyhow. ” John smiled weakly, his heart hammering away in his ears.
Jameela stood straight as an iron board and stared blankly at the wall behind the now vacated chairs as she watched everyone leave. She turned on her heel and walked to the door as her mind struggled to stick to one thought.
Shanaya bent her head backwards as if she was stretching her neck, but totally surreptitiously and not obvious at all, except for the driver and the cockroaches in the back and everything else in the rickshaw except somehow Jameela, Shanaya's eyes went to the bit of the shirt riding up from her back. It didn't ride up all that much and it was dark, but Shanaya could make a glimpse of ink on her back. Significance of an emotional sort, most likely.
“Mate.” Mike bent down and moved his hands over John’s as he unzipped the entire bag in a second. “If this is too much, you don’t have to...” The flap fell on the other side revealing his father’s Harmony H47 Stratotone Mercury.
Life was anyway hard, it's now difficult to die"
“Sherlock no. You didn’t. I promise”. John said leaning over to Sherlock. “I was asking you out…but I realised I had gone the wrong way about it, and I haven’t stopped thinking about you since. Hence I
The first time around he met a handsome, brave doctor in St Bart’s who praised him on his deductions and cared for him like no one else had. He worried about him, ran with him side by side on their madcap adventures.
“Even the abusive graffiti?”
“Who the fuck would put red paint on my Metallica T-shirt?!”
John winked and walked off to his room humming “I want to Break Free.” To himself.
Design, threading and durability.
“Thanks. I took a look at your school tapes. You’re pretty good. I was surprised that you didn’t try out for the team last year”.
Shanaya sighed internally, fantastic she was just like the rest of them. Pity. “Why am I too rich or too privileged for the likes of this little neighborhood?” She said sarcastically.
“Deep concern. Constant deep concern”.
John blinked “Excuse me?”
“Nope, just woke up. Can’t drink so fast John, not a rugby stud like you”. Harry giggled.
“Yes, yes. I did. Shush Rosie. It’s been a 120 something years. I need to take this in.” Jim said gleefully.
I don't think I need more to describe this chapter lol
Which was saying a lot, considering Shanaya was the most interesting, charming and unique person she had met in a long while. Mad, definitely. But fascinating.
I'M SORRY FOR THE EXTENDED DISAPPEARANCE.
“This is the third one, Watson”.
Shanaya turned to her “Is that what?’
Shanaya raised her chin and said “I know you’re a former Army doctor who was invalided home from Kashmir. You have a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help. Possibly because you don’t like him- more likely because he just walked out on his wife. Your doctor has diagnosed the tremble in your hands as psychosomatic- quite correctly I’m afraid”. Shanaya half smiled “I think that’s enough to go on isn’t it?’
“Fine” The mother muttered and gave the card.
Yes. Why do I have to deal with such incompetent morons?
Murray gazed at John uneasily but John shook his head subtly. Don’t give me away, Murray.
“Right Good. Okay, you’re unattached…like me”. John cleared his throat as his lips curved into his “pulling” charming smile “Good.”
I hadn’t considered the..latest factors. Dangerous oversight really.
be a lot more than a sari seller.
“Why did I let you talk me into this?” John hissed to a grinning Mike. Scattered applause sounded outside as the keytarist ended on a loud note that sounded like a chicken clucking for some reason.
“You know you can make them without Spider Man’s girlfriend’s namesake” Sally said.
As the British Government he knew well, that the Napoleon of crime had been a dangerous supernatural figure who was obsessed with destroying the two men, willing to wait across centuries and generations to see them again, if only to destroy them once again.
Coming.Coming.
“So, Watson, I heard that you pulled some East End chick last night”. Sally asked casually.
“Well, everything seems to be in order. Your EMI’s have to be regular and paid off 20th of every month for the next three years”.
The woman laughed but there was no real humour behind the laugh “Major Sajid will be very pleased with her little
As John dragged his freshly cleaned and dried laundry bag out and topped up Mike’s card, he stopped at the corkboard where the college activities were updated. He noted the timings of the tryouts, writing it down on his hand with a pen on the desk. His head was turned as the girls from the laundry room came out with their clothes, laughing and giggling as they passed a 5-pound note to each other.
"I got paid a visit from some friend of yours." Jameela remarked, ostensibly offhandedly.
Jameela looked at the woman sitting next to her. Clearly some form of assistant, constantly tapping away on her phone. Not really much of a talker, with the short responses and consistent ignoring of said doctor’s presence entirely when not asked a direct question.
This is definitely relevant guys. Remember.
“Hi”. A tap on his other shoulder turned John away “Did I hear you’re on the rugby team?” A dark haired brown girl said in an East End accent.
I am so bloody bored.
John hit the sharp implement away and yelled “She’s getting away!” “Tell them to follow me now”. He ordered Murray and ran after Sherlock into the dark.
Six months ago-
“You wouldn’t have to do all that much. Just pass some information along to me about her. Nothing indiscreet of course. Just how she’s doing”.
Wait.
They both started giggling at that and burst into full laughter. As the laughter faded, John looked over at SHERLOCK as she tried to stop chortling. John stared at the slightly less mysterious woman as she felt a bond snap together within one laugh.
“The girl his cousin saw him with is his fiancée”.
“Sorry mate”. John said with a sympathetic smile.
I agreed with you. Sentiment, love, all that
It was barely winter around here for that coat.
But no, even then Jameela didn’t believe that she had done that without some kind of motive.
John sits on the same bench, with a tiffin of poha and a bottle of water. She takes a full spoon of poha in her mouth as the woman from the other day flounces down next to her again.
Once she had sent the email, she pressed on the message icon.
Shanaya focused on the family photo. Formal portrait; going by the Banarasi silk sari worn by the irritated middle-aged woman. Old wedding gift by her husband? No, going by his slightly yellowing tight white shirt and the thrice hemmed black pants he’s wearing right now.
"Oh, hello. Are you Dr Watwe?" A stocky lady with grey streaks in her hair clad in a blue nightdress peeked out from the gated door from the ground floor flat.
John thought to himself.
“He is fucking gorgeous, true. But he’s going to get thrown out if he keeps pissing everyone off like that”.
Mike walked in to the kitchen and slumped down on the table “I was planning to make brownies with that. Guys honestly”.
"Why am I here though?" Jameela blurted.
“Are you making brownies? Thank God” Greg’s voice came from the door.
“Okay… mate but I’ve only got four pounds on it.” Mike said as he handed the rectangle card reluctantly.
Two chapters in one day? I've never felt more productive lol.
“You might be right Watson. But the cameras were out of commission and we have no way of knowing”. Coach said wearily.
After he came back from a ridiculous sounding case called The Red Headed League, she finally cracked. She accused him of proposing to her in false circumstances and he admitted as much to her that his first priority in matters of the heart and life was always the consulting detective in Baker Street.
"Shanaya. How many times have I told you not to stay up so late?" Mrs Hanglem scolded as Jameela took her trunk and took it inside the flat.
Welcome to my version of the infamous ASIP first meeting.
“That’s not what everyone else says.”
What neither of them realized, was that there was a greater plan in motion.
Two weeks later, James had moved to Australia and John had an acceptance letter from St Bart’s.
The silence, once comfortable now is oppressive.
"Work" Shanaya responded as she rummaged for her keys.
John’s heart hammered as the answer washed over him “Oh…right. So d’you have a boyfriend then? Which is fine by the way”?
Jameela stood ramrod straight until she heard the man leave the hall. She turned to see the woman in the car
The car stopped. Jameela sat there, not quite knowing what was going to happen, but the woman looked at her and very pointedly said “Bye”.
“Hello sexy. Miss me? “Jim said as he blew a kiss to Sherlock. Sherlock suppressed a shudder and tried to regain himself as he tried to make sense of Moriarty’s very alive presence here.
Unfortunately, Sherlock had forgotten that Harriet wasn't an ordinary nine year old.
"Let's stay in tonight, John. I want to spend time with you and Harriet." Sherlock practically purred as John continued to stroke his hair.
John chuckles before replying, “Sherl, we're going to a party, it's not like a formal do or anything. There's just going to be a bunch of drunk teenagers celebrating Christmas. You don't need to wear anything special.” The older teen grins before digging into his chest of drawers.
, I'm so fucked.” John giggles, grabbing his tenth beer and nudging his very drunk friend.
“Yes, but you love it.” Sherlock grinned back at John before the both of them started giggling.
“Yeah, but I do. So take it easy.” John chuckles, pushing Sherlock away slightly.
Three more days it takes before Sherlock self-destructs and Detective Inspector Lestrade has to try and find the broken hearted kid he's come to love as his own. And after two months, Sherlock falls off the grid completely, leaving Greg and Mycroft to search for the younger man.
“Someone's eager.” John chuckles, smiling at his new lover.
He signals to Sally Donovan to send the rest of his force in to make arrests and climbs back into his car.
“Ah, baby, we were just talking about you. All good things, obviously.” Greg purrs, practically sauntering over to his boyfriend.
“Apologies, John.” Sherlock sighs, his eyes snapping open to look at his boyfriend.
“Get. In. The. Car.” Greg says slowly, making his point clear.
“Mycroft Holmes. Nice to meet you,
“It's a necklace.” Harriet replied, turning it over in her hand.
"Oh, crap." He replied, running to the kitchen and expecting the worst.
“John, I have to ask you something and I know it's difficult but I need you to answer me.”
So Sherlock followed that mad man into his time machine, wanting to see what the future held for himself and his blogger.
Sherlock gets stabbed while solving a case
“Sher, as much as I'd
“What?” Sherlock replied, finally looking at the Doctor properly.
Anyway, I was eight years old when I first met the Doctor; the mad man in his time machine. It was completely by accident. I was at the park and a strange creature ran past me, followed by a strange man.
“It's alright, love.”
"I need blood." He says, barely above a whisper.
Sherlock nods in agreement, suddenly very sleepy as he pulls off his own shirt.
"Didn't you hear me? I have a blogger."
“Hey! I can't be to blame for
He smiled widely at me then, obviously remembering the situation, replied; "See you soon."
Goodbye.
“Sounds good. Well, I best head out, love. I start class in five.” John smiles, kissing Sherlock softly.
John and Greg laugh heartily before falling into a comfortable silence.
"When?"
“Well, my eyes definitely stand out.” He replies softly, ruffling his hair a bit.
But now I'm fifteen and the Doctor is here, at our flat, talking to Father about science. I'm sat on the couch with Dad, keeping him company and watching some daft tv show. He keeps laughing and it makes his eyes sparkle, it's a lovely sight, really.
just isn't working out and you want us to go our separate ways?” Greg shouts back, his voice breaking at the end.
"Okay, daddy." Harry replied sweetly, running to get her coat.
“There must be another Holmes then, because surely you can't really be talking about
“Oh, yes. We should definitely make it a regular occurrence.” John grinned.
“Stop it. I can practically
All he agrees to is to take Sherlock home and let time take it's course.
? In bed … with you?” Sherlock squeaks, his eyes wide.
her husband to confess to his crimes.” Sherlock replies sheepishly, a blush colouring his cheeks.
There's an awkward silence for a moment.
"Why must we always argue? I don't like the hostility and it isn't good for Harriet either."
Harriet smiled and hugged him in return; her stomach rumbling as the smell of breakfast reached her nose.
Maggie smiles softly at Sherlock, watching him sit down and continue to drink his coffee.
that way about …
She jumps as she walks into the kitchen and finds the vampire from last night standing there, a cup in his hand.
“Keep going. I want this.” Sherlock says softly, reaching down to run his fingers through John's hair.
“Yes! I did. I really liked it, John. I've wanted to kiss you for so long now. Um, I've … had a crush on you for a few years now.” Sherlock replies, whispering the last part.
“John?” Sherlock asks carefully.
“Well, maybe it's time to open your presents now, Harry.” Sherlock smiled awkwardly, sitting down across from his partner.
"So what do you call this machine then?"
“Fine!” Sherlock yells in reply, storming out of the library ahead of John.
“I won't look stupid, will I?”
“Yes, I heard. Now, if you're quite done discussing our sexual positions to John, I think Sherlock would like to have his boyfriend back.”
“Of course I was focusing. I wanted it to be good for you.”
“Greg! How much have you had to drink, mate?” John grins, catching his friend as he trips and stumbles into John, nearly spilling his beer all over the other teen.
“John.” Sherlock sighs, resting his forehead against John's.
"She's 'making friends' with strange men! I will not be happy about that, Sherlock. She's a
“I kinda told Amy that you work with me, I mean what was a suppose to say, ‘hey Amy, this is Sherlock, he’s a vampire that I met one night after work.’ She’ll think you’re from some sort of cult.”
“Piss off. You got what you wanted, now go back to your little slut of a girlfriend and pretend you're not gay.” Sherlock snaps, pulling away from the man and getting dressed.
"As I said, I had a 'thing' for you. In fact, I was tempted to take you up on your offer." Sherlock replied, crawling into John's lap.
, that you couldn't give me what I wanted.”
Could read at an adult level by nine
Harriet quickly finished the last of her breakfast and quietly disappeared into the living room; her dad never approved of things that were 'Not Good'.
“So how come the girl never like, grew up? I mean, you look thirty now but obviously you were a kid once so when did you get bit?” Maggie asks curiously.
John slides off the bed as the pair get undressed slowly and in silence, both more than a little nervous about their first time together.
“No, our devastatingly handsome Holmes boys gave me a few too.”
John stepped into his partner's personal space and roughly grabbed his chin, causing Sherlock to shiver.
“Lestrade, this is the man you're looking for. You should find the murder weapon at his home and the stolen artefacts at a storage longer at this address. Oh, and you'll find a substantially large amount in his bank account since before the murders started.”
“Where do you think we'll be in ten years?” He asks curiously, stroking back some of Sherlock's curls.
“Well, I was hoping you would change your mind once you knew I was.”
“What planet is this one from? And do we need to keep it away from you until you're older?” John asked suspiciously, looking over at his daughter.
Mycroft sighs but steps closer, ready to intervene if John gets out of control.
“That's a good point actually. Maybe telling me you were a vampire before sex would have been more appropriate.” John giggles, looking up at Sherlock.
Greg barely manages to catch Sherlock as he collapses; the shock of what her simple words mean to an already fragile heart.
John kisses Sherlock's hand and moans softly, moving in and out slowly.
“Then go.” Amy smiles back.
Ah, prompt as always and here's the cab too.
"I mean, why did you stay at 221B?"
“So, how did you enjoy your birthday, love?” John asked his daughter as she helped him tidy away the dishes.
be special anyway.” Sherlock tries to reason, gripping his boyfriend's arms tightly.
She'd noticed that ever since Sherlock had returned all those years ago, that the boys had been going at it like rabbits.
Once Sherlock had shrugged his shoulders and closed the door, the Doctor ran up the steps of 221B Baker Street.
“Now, if you behave and clean up the eyes, I might even just feed it to you. In our room. With a lot less clothing on.” The teen whispers, straddling Sherlock's legs and leaning in to nibble his neck.
“No, Dad.”
But the machine was already vanishing silently into the vortex.
“Piss off, Mycroft. I'm not
Sherlock nearly flew off the bed and had to bite his hand to suppress the scream.
“Thank you, Anthea.” Sherlock replies, managing a small smile.
Mrs Hudson answers and immediately gasps in horror, noticing the blood covering John's jumper as Sherlock pushes past her.
"No, it was my fault." I admit, after all I made the first move.
“Morning, babe.” The older teen grins down at his best friend.
“What? No! Sherlock doesn't have a crush on me. Don't be daft, Greg.”
“What if …”
"Can't
Sherlock sucks his boyfriend off with slow, long strokes, making sure to lick the underside while John moans low in his throat.
, remember?”
“Well … not if you don't want to. If
“Are you and him a, you know, a thing?”
"Hello, John Watson?"
His worst fears come true when Mycroft, now an official government official, brings him the file. Which of course, Sherlock isn't supposed to see but in Mycroft's rare act of kindness, he breaks every rule he can, just so his little brother is the first to know.
Anyway, I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at my husband. For looking around for a new mate. Really, Sherlock, going for a younger model! And
"That's a lie. This is time and space we're talking about." I grin because Father's always loved a mystery, and time travel is just another one.
John grips Sherlock's hand and moves slightly faster, pouring everything in his heart out to his fallen angel.
“Then why did you leave?”
He's committed every act of treason from the very beginning, just to help his little brother, even the biggest crime of all; telling his partner
Davies turns to look at the DI and sniggers, “Who's this? Your dad? Got daddy issues do you, kid? That why you're shagging men twice your age?”
He nips a little harder at Sherlock's neck and the younger teen bucks his hips up.
you do earlier, it was really fun.
"Why is it broken?"
.” Sherlock squeaks as John's mouth engulfs his erection fully.
tell people their secrets.”
“Nothing. Just thinking out loud.” John replies, forcing a smile.
"Hold on then."
John's heart was slowly breaking; all he'd ever wanted was Sherlock to feel,
“As much as I admire your enthusiasm, Doctor Watson, I believe I said
“Please, John. I
But just as he starts to think this is the end, he hears the most terrifying noise; a dangerous growl that echoes in the silence of the house and suddenly the source of the noise leaps into action.
“How did you ...”
So I decided to update other fics while I wait for my muse to come back properly for that xxxx
"Oh. Wrong time."
“What? Oh, your hair … We'll get one in the morning, Sherl. It's time to sleep now.” John replies softly, pulling off his jeans and boxers, throwing them off the bed.
He turns and sees a woman holding a plank of wood; getting ready to swing it again.
The three ate in silence until Harriet announced that she was going to bed and John followed, promising to read her a bedtime story.
.” Sherlock smirks, kissing John's neck.
“A double chocolate with chocolate pieces muffin? Yes.” John smiles, grabbing Sherlock's hand and pulling him towards an experiment-free desk.
got a crush on you.” Greg sings, giggling stupidly.
"No!" The little girl shouted, stopping abruptly.
"Yes,
“Father taught me the art of blackmail, Mrs H.” Harriet replied with a huge smile.
!” Sherlock moaned, shifting his hips until he found the spot.
“12th standard farewell ceremony. A pointlessly formal exercise of hymns, boring speeches and stuff from the Bible said by tediously preachy Bishops, after which she which she’ll probably never wear it again.” Shanaya said curtly. “Plus” she said after giving the mother and the bored daughter sitting on the stool near the entrance playing some insipid game on her phone “You can’t really afford it can you? Go with the blue poly cotton one. Easier to explain to your penny pinching husband”.
Awkward silence ensues.
Might as well get a read on her, Jameela said, trying to convince herself that’s ALL she was doing.
Harsha I love you
“Ms Hardikar, Mr. (she took a quick glance at his name plate) Dhandania. I’m a widow” She said bluntly.
The reunion was being held at one of those big wedding venue places. It was a big garden area with a wooden stage with hastily draped curtains on it, Jameela was pretty sure she could see a sizable hole on the banister. The DJ has given up trying to do any actual DJ’ing and was basically now letting the music play on shuffle while presumably played some latest mobile game on his phone, given the furious tapping.
protests.
When she talked to Saxena, the idea of the reunion didn’t seem to please her a lot. So clearly, not a big fan of mingling or parties as a whole. Wary eyes as she scanned the room, always on alert for danger – a soldier’s habit.
“That wasn’t just me. We all had to play on even if we lost our pants. Captain’s orders” John broke into a fit of giggles again
A dull afternoon with clouds gathering over the park.It’s a small park with a children’s playground a few metres away. The cacophony of traffic and humanity comes from the other side of the park. The park overlooks multiple shops, including some sari shops.
The woman narrowed her eyes at her “I know a great many things about her. Some things you don’t even know and some things you choose to hide from others. Have you told your new
, I believe my friend has found your attentions a shade annoying”. Dr John Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, a veteran of the Second Anglo Afghan War, Kandahar, Helmand and Bart’s bloody Hospital pointed a steady gun to a snarling evil spirit who had haunted the life and death they ought to have had. Together. Always.
“Donovan!” “For fuck’s sake!”
“What’s wrong with the landline?-
A pregnant pause as John held her breath.
She gestures dramatically and sighs as in real pain. JOHN’s mouth twitches as if trying not to laugh.
“No. I - no, I want to do this.” John said with only a slight quaver to his voice, betraying his nervousness.
“You don’t seem very frightened”.
Jameela smiled a slightly sad smile and said “So, did the college get a makeover worth crores recently or did you rob a bank?”
" My family has owned this property and have been caretaker of the forts here for the last six decades. I am not a rich man,but we are well known to the people around here. Two years ago, I went up to Delhi for an old college reunion . I was staying at a hotel there where I met a young Pakistani woman - Elisha Akhtar, while I was having a late night cap at the hotel bar".
Jameela stood straight, staring ahead at the dark road they came by as it took the posh car's trunk a surprising amount of time to open.
It’s good pay. In a hospital where I get to treat real patients instead of old hypochondriac geezers.
Why did it end?
“Hey John”. Molly smiled.
SHERLOCK looks over at her, as if finally seeing someone else. She gives an appraising look to the other woman.
When he finished with a flourish, John was the loudest to clap.
Maanav had seemed to disappear to more interesting pastures as Shanaya went behind the counter and put the sari on it . She went towards the computer and typed in the type of sari and the customer .
A war of love, that envy and jealousy of two cosmic villains who sought to destroy it.
“No!” Sherlock almost shouted “I am! Interested. Very. It’s just- you’re the rugby vice captain and the third year medical student everyone loves. I was…scared. I didn’t think you would really be interested. In me”. Sherlock said looking down.
The first time around, Mary Morstan fell in love with a kind man who cared for her, called her beautiful and was a good husband in every which way.
“Piss off. Fuck off. Take your pick.” John smiled at Sherlock in a silent gesture of sympathy and solidarity. Sherlock returned a tentative smile.
Thankfully, the officer (she really should figure out his name) caught on to her disinterest in his spiel and cleared his throat to get her attention. Shanaya broke out of her irritated deconstruction of the man’s family and looked at him with a barely constrained impatience.
Someone wanna give a guess which ACD case this one this is based on?
Of course. It sounds.. Perfect for you.
“Brilliant”. John exclaimed.
She put her phone down quickly and walked into the kitchen chewing her thumb nail. She needed to make some tea.
The car suddenly stopped as Jameela looked up confused for a second until she looked at the window and realized she had reached her apartment building.
Sally glared at Greg “Fine. But I’m not dealing with him”.
“My fucking wallet is empty”.
"Different work." Shanaya rejoined as she swung the coat on herself. Literally swung and swished . Great, she was living with a drama queen , Jameela observed sardonically.
"I need an assistant. You'll do perfectly". Shanaya said with that same offhand tone but her mind was burning inside at the presence of the short but sturdily built brown haired woman who was sitting inches away from her .
The woman looked at her appraisingly “The woman who didn’t trust her own sibling to tell her about her discharge has thrown in her lot with a strange woman from a shop. Is it that you have now put your faith in Shanaya Hardikar of all people?”
“Talking? You’re joking!”
“Sherlock” John swallowed.
“Come on. I’ve got a secret way through without anyone noticing”. Lisa whispered. John noted her not having any spray cans.
Jameela stared at the back of the coated woman incredulously as she left her behind.
As she walked in, she saw a short-ish curvy woman in a suit and a black briefcase a little away from her standing near the stage. There was a chair a little further away from him.
“That’s mine”. Shanaya said seemingly distracted as she stabbed the cloth with unnecessary force with the sewing needle.
"I don't quite know how to explain this, Ms Hardikar. These are very strange incidents I would have taken for a senseless joke, but it has taken a toll on my wife. She is a kind and beautiful woman who I love dearly, but now there is such a haunted and fearful look in her eyes, I would do anything to take it away" Hemish said anxiously wringing his hands as Jameela sat down on the red sofa.
John’s shoulders slumped. He really did not want to do this right now. “Excuse me.”
“Sure Harry. Look, there’s something urgent happening here. I don’t have time for this. Do I call Clara and ask her to pick you up?” John asked.
She flounced herself down on the armchair and definitely did not pout or mutter underneath her breath about crazy people as Mrs Hanglem came up with that steaming cup of tea.
“Yeah I’m not the Jameela you-“Jameela bit back the rest of the statement. Maanav didn’t seem to notice as they paid for their groceries.
“Actually, I just remembered they’re hosting this reunion for our batch at Pride Hotel on Sunday. You should come”. Maanav said as they sat on the stone stair and watched the kids play football of all things on the basketball ground.
The sari's border had stitching of text in it. It was two lines from a poem.
John held the can of red spray. Oh God that’s her. She’s the saboteur. He met Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock nodded slightly. John squared his shoulders and smiled an equally false smile at Lisa.
Mrs Hanglem looked up from her chai to see the girls walk out of the door without even a good bye and smiled fondly at the pair running down the stairs.
aka- Pretty sure this counts as abuse of power Marichika to use company resources and money to interrogate your sister's future roommate.
“Sorry mate. She did give me her number though if any of you want to jump on that grenade. I guess I’m going to disappoint you on that front… and this as well”. John put down an ace of hearts, queen of hearts… against all the other heart cards. “And for my coup de grace”. “Murray, turn away now. The king of hearts”. John flourished the card dramatically and placed it on the table.
John tried not to gasp too loudly at the sheer beauty of the way he handled the instrument. Don’t go there Watson he reminded himself as he thought of the connotations of the obvious skill with which he handled this instrument and deliberately lost himself in the music.
“Ah, Shanaya please”. Shanaya smiled as they shook hands and both walked into the shop.
“Because you’re a smart woman and I’m sure your current position is quite clear to you”
Jameela was taken aback “I’m sorry what?”
“When I left him, he was seriously considering enlisting in the Army”.
“You know what? I’m bringing it down with my stupid griping. John, switch on the TV. Let’s watch England get hammered by Scotland and wash the awesome brownies down with sad resignation beer. Swing low, sweet chariot…”
“Pretty good?” John cried before he caught himself. “I mean- I’ll go get some more beers”. He hurried over to the bar.
itna badboo aati hain my God. Mujhe nahi pata woh ladki aadha waqt kya karti rehti hain- such a bad smell comes from her flat , i don't even know what that girl does half the time
“Greg I told you, he’s a goddamned nightmare”. Sally reminded.
"So, the flat is a split level. The drawing room, kitchen and dining room is downstairs and two beds are upstairs. The rent should be paid at the first of every month. Shanaya's payment comes like clockwork regularly. The only thing she does that doesn't give me a heart attack I tell you- all her goings on, funny noises, itni badboo aati hain my God. Mujhe nahi pata woh ladki aadha waqt kya karti rehti hain" and so she talked away at an astonishing speed somehow switching between Hindi, Marathi and English in the same sentence with natural ease.
John stared at her open mouthed. She is absolutely bowled over. SHERLOCK blushed self-consciously.
Shanaya rose quickly, really wanting to get out of this oppressively boring place. She shook his proffered hand quickly and turned to frog march out of there.
“No, no its fine. Are you fine though? Jameela” Maanav said as he looked at her with a new wariness in his eyes. Great, another one Jameela thought.
John thought as he stuffed his clothes in his laundry bag. He rummaged through his pockets and his table drawers for his laundry card.
“A bit not good yeah. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that”. Jameela said a little sheepishly.
“That’s not the point!”
Well, at least he listened and got that damn app. Hopefully, he makes less dumb mistakes.
Probably a bit of both.
face brightened and looked at John with a growing smile.
Of course not.
"maut aane tak na aaye , ab jo aaye ho to aai
Two weeks. Just need to pack up everything. Not like I had much.
John let go of the chain, the chain came off and collected in his hand. It was broken. John stared at it. Wiping his eyes, he walked and walked until he reached the Bridge.
Jameela was left to do the polite manners thing and shook his hand, as she walked in with him into the drawing room.
This is not your place.
“Fine yeah. But who the hell does he think he is? Arrogant psychopath…” Sally muttered under her breath as they put the chips and cards in the box.
“John.” Sherlock stood up hurriedly “Um, please sit.” He offered the seat next to him.
“ After you, then Jameela”. Shanaya smiled that bright dazzling smile that highlighted her cheekbones even more.
Jameela opened the latch on the trunk. It consisted of a tennis racket, Army uniform, multiple awards from her regiment from tennis to swimming to acting as Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing which they had set up for the visiting generals, a bunch of letters unanswered and returned and her Parakram Padak medal.
Jameela could see every life decision, every moment ,every challenge posed to her in those brown eyes as Shanaya said.
She made herself a cup of tea, rolled her shoulders and clicked the blog. This was going to be more fun than whatever pub night Saxena was planning tonight.
“No! I’m fine. I just called to find out how little brother was doing! How’s the love life? Let go of the ring yet?”
Jameela was still staring at her until she realized Shanaya had asked her her name “ Oh, Dr Watwe, Dr Jameela Watwe. You can call me by my first name –Jameela that is”. She said flustered beyond belief at the woman’s gaze and belatedly realizing her manners , stuck her hand out.
Sherlock looked at him a little furtively “John are you asking… If so I should say I am flattered-
“Jameela? Jameela Watwe!” She turned around to see a vaguely familiar slightly overweight man in his forties holding a briefcase hurrying towards her.
" Okay. Tell your boss, thanks for the nighttime ride and tell her to fuck off and stay out of Shanaya's - and my business- but you know politely." Jameela said pleasantly with a tight sarcastic smirk that belied her tone as she turned her back on her and walked towards the gate.
“John Watson- Bart’s new scrum-half”. Mike clinked his beer glass with John and cheered.
“Yeah sure- of course. I’ll see you then”. Shanaya said, giving the brightest smile to her roommate she had yet.
“I’ll be downstairs in fifteen minutes.” Jameela said to the assistant lady whatever. She stepped out of the car and smirked at her, “Keep the meter running.”
App for calculating cloth. Middleman like you suggested.
“So, I uh researched you. Found your blog. The Science of Clothing.” Jameela said, trying to fill up the sudden empty space she felt in the room when Shanaya turned her back on her.
“Take a number.” Sally growled as she stomped into the room.
“Tar, not ten minutes in he called Gail an idiot, told her she was having an affair with the Bio professor and that she lied about her grade in Chemistry. It may not be that much of a mystery.”
Shanaya had silently pointed towards multiple turns by now, as they entered into areas only lit by the moon and the rickshaw's headlights. Jameela looked out to see houses and buildings disappearing, to leave only barren hills and closed tea stalls and dhabbaas on both sides of the road. As the rickshaw passed farmland with tall wheat plants , Jameela spoke again.
Fifteen minutes into her stitching she heard a man and a woman’s voices outside.
Shanaya looked around at the piece of fabric she was mending, lying around and sighed – it was so hard not smoking on the weekdays when customers were few and far in between- it was hard not smoking anyway.
“Thanks Mike.” He said with a shaky unconvincing smile to his face as he swung the guitar strap over his head as the waitress announcer started tapping the mic.
As the car took a right, Jameela’s thoughts turned to the person of the day- Shanaya. Clearly, she was a lot more interesting than she had thought previously.
Shanaya just raised her eyebrows “ Obviously. Come back tomorrow”. She stole one last unnoticed glance at Jameela as she reached for inside of her purse.
"Oh! Which one?" Shanaya turned back to her steepled hand position.
Shanaya typed out a quick message to Jameela’s number and sent it before she could think otherwise.
" And here we are ." Mrs Hanglem said as she put the trunk down and rummaged for her big set of keys. As she turned the lock of the gate , the door opened from inside to show Shanaya, dressed in a blue shirt and black jeans with the collar open.
" What life?" Jameela looked back at the assistant who was finally looking up at her.
Everyone in the rugby clubs and union had agreed that Anderson wasn’t fit to shine Sally’s boots let alone be with her. But no one had dared tell her that, especially since it was an unspoken fact this wasn’t the first time Anderson had cheated on her.
Jameela kept staring at him for a minute with that same expression as she mentally tried to get herself together, it’s just Maanav Jay, he didn’t know Jay, get you together soldier! She shouted at herself as she snapped back into reality.
“ I’m fine.” Jameela said shortly as she righted herself and brushed herself to check for any spillage on her sari.
Close enough, Shanaya thought. There's always something I miss. "Any good?"
John showed him two fingers as he swigged his beer “How’s the girlfriend Murray?”
“Hi. I’m John”. John situated his foot on the bottom rung to adjust himself on the slightly tall stool, a few titters coming out from the taller people in the back. Adjusting his guitar , John dragged the mic closer to him - thankfully the waitress had brought it down, saving him any more heckles from the arsehole jocks in the back.
Jameela frowned minutely before her expression became implacable “I don’t have one. I bought a sari from her two days ago”
Shanaya’s jaw was set as she stopped and turned to him “Mr. Dhandania, I’d suggest you go home early today if you have any chance of stopping your wife from leaving you once and for all. I’d suggest a nice expensive sari. You know where my shop is”. She turned and walked out of the door to a quickly reddening and spluttering loan officer.
“SHOOT THEM!”
SHERLOCK? What happened?
“Oh. Not good?” Shanaya asked.
Suddenly she sees a figure bounding towards her. SHERLOCK , dressed in a blue shirt and jeans comes and sits on the bench. John smiles at her warmly, her heart is pounding away. SHERLOCK smiles back but seems to stiffen up.
" Now ? Its 2 am . I thought you opened at 10 am" Jameela said skeptically .
"You'll find out " The assistant said, being annoyingly mysterious for some stupid reason.
In a ramshackle house in the middle of the sweltering city of Calcutta, India in the year 1895 she promised him that one day- his brother and Dr Watson would find each other again .
"How does he know she buried it?'
"The driver could take that up for you". The assistant said without looking up from her phone.
he know about you in the first place?" Jameela questioned skeptically.
“ Oh yeah, you’re still infamous among the teaching staff here still”. Maanav said .
“No you’re just on your way to a liver failure”. John bit out.
“I’m to drop you off at your place”.
"So you were right". Shanaya stated with a side eye towards Jameela.
“Sod off Harry.” John said.
John opens the door.It’s SHERLOCK.
Jameela smiled a little at the thought of the smugness radiating from the mad genius woman as she would say “Obviously”. She stifled a giggle.
In two languages.
A soft creaking noise came from behind as the pub door opened, admitting some four people, at the head a tall sultry woman with grey eyes clad in a slinky black dress with blood-red lipstick on the arm of a bored pale curly haired man with high cheekbones and irresistible blue-green eyes.
“That first-year kid in Chemistry?”
Jameela grinned at her “Well who else would I go to ? The reunion’s on Sunday and today’s Thursday. Will you be able to do it soon enough?”
“Hello darlings”. She said silkily. John sat up with a start of recognition as the spotlight shined on her face, the woman from the rugby night.  “It is my honor to introduce a true star in our midst. The very definition of a dark horse who hid himself and his talents in obscurity.” A loud cough sounded to her right. Ignoring it she continued “Gentlemen, ladies and those of other variations of gender please welcome Mr. Sherlock Holmes”.
No one other than an Army woman would inscribe their name, age, and rank on the Tiffin... Dr. Watson
John and SHERLOCK sit in silence, their fear leaving their feelings unsaid.
“Hey, Mike.” John knocked on his door. “Could I borrow your laundry card for today? I can’t find mine.”
The right-wing of the women’s rugby team grinned “I’ll hold you and this to that Watson”.
Jameela stared at the back of the waiter and at the constantly ringing phone in the booth as she looked around at her surroundings. It was a dark road with only one flickering street light. There were occasional cars that went by but she knew that no one would see her here. She went towards the booth and picked up the phone.
“What?-
"Some kind of detective. You're a sari seller". Jameela finished .
Holmes sought the refuge of his seven percent solution and consigned his life to loving a man who would not; could not return his love.
Suddenly the waiter stopped, Jameela clenched her keys in her hand and made it into a makeshift brass ring.
“Oh, we were just waiting for you Dr Watson! Please join us and this little drama of ours. Your presence was sorely needed” Moriarty said smiling clapping his hands together with glee but Sherlock noticed the spark of rage in his eyes when John first entered the room.
Jameela was again taken aback by the smile and the seeming callous casualness with which she said that, but somehow she didn’t quite believe that that was all there was to it.
“Do you think James would have liked seeing you in rugby shorts?”
He consulted many who promised but gave nothing, until he visited a tired looking woman with deceptively sharp eyes.
“There was something weird about this.” John said.
Clara xxx
“A thousand in cash total, front row tickets to England v Scotland, some watches and an expensive bracelet is missing”. Greg and Sally reported.
“Oh yes. Maanav Of course”. She shook his hand quickly.
Shanaya turned to her side on the sofa where she was lying. Draped in a slightly tatty, loose dressing gown which was lying on the floor a little, Shanaya sighed and stared at her phone on the coffee table sitting placidly at a little distance from the coffee table. Mrs Hanglem had moved the table after one too many instances of Shanaya forgetting it was there and hitting her thigh on it when she got up, leading to profound swearing in three languages and yelling at her bemused landlady.
No, not really. Why did you call me? Why were you not at the bench today?
The mother got redder with rage and was about to open her mouth to presumably rage at her, her daughter interrupted her from the entrance “Mom, seriously. Let’s go with the blue one. You know dad gets mad when we have to use his credit card.” The daughter walked towards her mom and looked at Shanaya and said “Blue poly cotton sari please”
“Watson? Greg. You’re right on time.” A soaked tall fair boy with pretty dark eyes came running up to him and shook his hand.
Can I come in?
That wasn’t the issue. I had learnt how to tune out idiots from an early age. I had a friend. Irene. More than a friend, I mean.. We were together for two years.
“Sounds great. But first.” John leaned over and placed a soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock noticeably froze for a split second until John moved his lips. Sherlock held John’s strong shoulders as he kissed him back more forcefully, his mind in a state of rare complete silence and afire at the same time.
John looks even more nonplussed.
“No.” Sally said. “Absolutely not. Not him”.
“But then a week ago- I started losing stuff. Minor stuff- a laundry bill, a half-finished novel, a girl’s phone number”. John half smiled at the murmured chortles from the crowd.
How difficult is it to properly measure the border? This is primary school rubbish. Three inches more than what I asked for AND he tried to make me pay extra for it!
"She likes to worry. Who knows why? Makes her feel needed I think" Shanaya said dismissively but Jameela smiled slightly at the barest hint of fondness in Shanaya's eyes.
"Ghazia, from the medical shop next to my sari shop. Saxena bought his acidity tablets from there when you were trying out saris is his sister- in- law. She helps me find clients." Shanaya replied.
Bhaad mein jao- go to hell/fuck off. Though go to hell is more literal translation.
“Three kisses means spouse usually plus the fact it’s with you, both means he wants you to stay in touch and he left her and doesn’t want a reminder of her”. Shanaya finished with a little shrug to say ‘easy’.
bevakuf- stupid/idiot
I wanted to try the stick men but I can't do that so I thought Id rather use my latest obsessions with Urdu poetry as code. Plus dude Urdu poetry is so gay you wouldn't believe. There's an entire genre of lesbian poetry that was sadly scrubbed away during the British rule that is so wonderfully erotic and loving which deserves its time in the sun man.
I so based her on my grandmother. My grandmother can literally speak three languages in  one sentence in half a breath I'm not kidding.  Plus she's crazy healthy and fit. So much so, that when she has threatened to drag my lazy ass out of bed if I don't re start exercising again and make me walk with her .
“Oh God, I’m sorry Maanav. Wait let me give you my wet tissues”. Jameela babbled a bit as she rummaged through her purse.
"So you're a puzzle solver as well?" Jameela asked still a little dubious.
You brilliant madwoman. My genius who led me out of the darkness. God, I love you, you git.
“I just have a few questions to iron out. Your main address seems to be in another city, will you be moving here?”
Jameela reacted instinctively, spilling her drink a bit as she elbowed in the general direction of the voice’s groin.
“Okay. Okay” Jameela said as she walked behind her towards the car.
The rickshaw stopped finally as the driver said dully, his voice already heavy with sleep he was looking forward to sinking in, "We're here madam".
“Sure honey. You know what? Let’s be naughty. I have a plan in mind on how we can stick it to those mean jocks. Let’s get out of here.”
I’m an idiot.
“Nothing, nothing ,yes she is cheating on you with your rich CEO neighbour, she goes out wearing a Paithani for God’s sake, boring , boring, God!” Shanaya threw her phone where it bounced harmlessly on the carpet and started pacing across the room.
John stifled a sigh “Harry. Drinking again?”
“Thanks” Sherlock said bashfully, but something about the calculation in his eyes made it suspect “It’s a little difficult in front of an audience, but I’m glad it went well.”
God THIS HAS TAKEN SO LONG.
“Are you that imbecilic, itna bevakuf hain that you don’t get what the hell be careful with silk means??!! Look, “She gestured furiously at the tiny hole in the cloth on the hem “dimag kahi ghaas charne gaya hain”. She glared at the terrified delivery boy before she saw a familiar figure coming towards her. She glared at the delivery boy “I’ll deal with you later. Now shoo”. She gestured imperiously at the boy who scarpered away as fast as his legs could take him.
“Raise or fold?”. Sally asked Murray as he frowned at his cards.
“No arguments here. But at least I made breakfast.” John said as he switched the flame off and put the pan on the table. “Eat up.” He handed Mike a fork and stabbed into his sausage.
“Yes! Absolutely brilliant. That was fantastic.” John enthused.
He had watched his little brother and the army doctor love each other and devote their selves to each other without ever realizing the other’s actions. Their society had left him no option but to serve as nothing more than a spectator in their love story, in a time where their love would never be accepted.
That’s it! I’ve got it.
“There’s this …arsehole in my class. Loves to create chaos in the class, can’t learn anything until the professors throw him out. Bonafide genius, so he thinks he’s better than everyone else”. Sally scowled.
Five years later, when he didn’t come back. Watson opened the drawer to ask an old friend- one he didn’t think he would ever need again- one last favour. To deliver him in the arms of his beloved friend and the love of his life so they could spend eternity together.
“ No time like the present. Plus, I think we’ve waited long enough haven’t we?”
Murray nodded and made his way to the front table where a redhead was waving at him. John made his way to the bar and motioned for three beers to the bartender.
"Why don't you start from the beginning, Mr Choudhary?" Shanaya said as she sat down on the sofa next to her and leaned back observing the man sitting heavily in a straight backed chair.
As she scrolled down, Jameela saw a blog with barely 1000 hits on it called “The Science of Clothing”. Jameela smirked, yeah that was her.
John smiled at her. Nice woman. “Sounds like himself.”
Sherlock snorted, following John through the bar to collect their coats. “It wasn’t even. I know the game he’s talking about, it was a fundraiser but the charity is well known for giving their ceos six figure salaries out of the donations.”
“Point taken,” the other debater said.
“Jesus fuck, that hurt!” The first debater objected, rubbing at his mouth.
It was Friday and John was ready to get sloshed. He wanted to manually reset his hard drive. He wanted his crank turning man to be knocked off his ass.
The teacher sighed. “I enter all of the information that you put, the computer is just scoring it as you wrote. Maybe if you showed your work I could find the problem, but…” he shrugged.
John sighed heavily. He did have to come to terms with that. If he went through with this, if he really dated Sherlock, he would be in a relationship with a man. He’d fooled around with men before, sure, he did go to university, but he hadn’t ever actually had any sort of future with a man. Long nights together on the couch, going out to eat together, doing their favorite things in tandem.
John grinned. He was pulling every trick that had ever worked on a girl in recent memory. “Nope, just. Enjoying myself.”
But he never knew what to do. It’s not like he was handed this gift (or curse) with instructions. The general rule for him was to ignore the secrets he was told unless there was some way he could help directly. He couldn’t report any incriminating secrets without any evidence.
John stood quickly. “Doctor Watson, actually, is Sherlock okay?”
John went with him to the flat the next day, perplexed and a little alarmed.
“I see him.”
“Ahh,” Sherlock gasped in pain, letting go of John to touch his arm in pain. “Wait, where are you going?”
John nodded, waiting.
John blinked and raised his eyebrows down at the table. Shouldn’t even be thinking about Sherlock in bed, anyway. But really, who could be blamed when the word “condom” just casually dropped out of Sherlock’s incredibly posh, plush lips?
He opened the door to 221B, and found the dishes still sitting on the living room table, and his tea mug with two bags still full and undrank from when he’d abandoned it when he realized there was no honey. Fuck, he’d forgotten to buy honey.
Sherlock blushed. “Well. I have-- I refused to let him…” Sherlock cleared his throat. “I only ever sleep over at his flat.”
He stubbed his toe on the staircase as he trudged up, feeling exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with his actual energy and everything to do with feeling utterly put-upon by the entire world.
“Right,” John said, grabbing a plastic cup from the sideboard. “No straw, sip gently,” John handed it to him, wrapping a hand around his fingers to make sure he could hold it. He smiled at Sherlock’s first word upon waking being a demand. “There you are, princess.”
“How did you know that was--”
John followed Sherlock without looking back for Alex.
“An apology would not be out of line.”
“Alex? Love, I’ve found a case I think I could use you on. Please do come along with us, since you want to see what we do so desperately.” Sherlock grinned into the phone speaker.
The cab pulled up and Sherlock gratefully rushed out. John let him go, but committed that to memory to grill him later. Now that John was safely out of the firing range for being called homophobic, he loved to tease Sherlock about his “type”.
“He’s fine, yeah, we’re at a crime scene. I don’t think he’ll be done in time for dinner.”
The screen lit up green.
John left the room to go up his stairs, and once the door shut he heard them burst into giggles together. He fought the urge to yank the door back open and demand what had been so funny.
John shook his head as Sherlock jumped off the sink, taking another step forward to stick his landing. “No, let’s go home. I’m tired of hearing Bill talk about that one charity game he did, anyway.”
“No,” Sherlock and John answered in unison from opposite ends of the empty warehouse floor.
And that’s how, a few moments and a few miracles later, John was wearing a deep blue suit that nicely accentuated his arms toned from years of manual labor and brought out his eyes and riding a horse (he didn’t see any need for a carriage when it was just himself) toward the castle.
John shrugged, realizing how silly he sounded. Just because he hadn’t seen Sherlock going on dates doesn’t mean he didn’t.
“No, and that’s actually why I’m asking for a favor,” John continued quickly before Lestrade could reply. “Now, don’t blow your stack here, but I need you to…”
“Is he okay? He arranged this dinner and now he’s just… not showing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Lestrade called in a snit, Mrs. Hudson had said you went with him.”
“Then why did you tell Lestrade he’d been poisoned? What if--”
How dare he? Sherlock had deleted the solar system to make room for more important things, what’s gone out if he’s remembering this now? Why was he trying to change Sherlock?
“So you are gay, then?” John asked, realizing a moment later that now was not a good time to satisfy his curiosity.
The beginning of the end started, as most things start in the Holmes-Watson household, with a call with Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade.
“Oh, trust me doctor, I am a lot of work.” Sherlock slurred, starting to drift back to sleep.
John smirked, slowly setting his tea down on the table. He adjusted himself on the sofa so he could properly look up at Sherlock, making sure he had his eye contact and total focus, and nodded. “Yes please.” He said politely.
at reading people and signs.
“God damn it, Sherlock!” screamed John, paying no heed to the raised eyebrow of the cabbie.
. He must’ve deleted the whole of it by now, certainly.
John was inordinately proficient at picking up signs when someone else was flirting with him. More than one sergeant at the Met had flirted with him on several occasions, but John did not want to mix work with pleasure, with the exception of Sherlock. He had left several crime scenes with people eyeing him up. Several trips to Tesco had included him walking away with a lady’s number, more so after his blog hits skyrocketed. Heck, he had set up a date with a doctor on the very day he was interviewed by said doctor - who had also ended up employing him! What else did you want to know about John, other than the fact that he was
John was just in time to hear Lestrade finishing off with, “…so help me God, even Mycroft will not be able to reach the place I’ll arrange for your end!”
brain. It must surely get overwhelming at times, if the string of deductions thrown in a single breath at any given moment were anything to go by. John had had moments in his life where he would go through something similar. During his days as an Army surgeon, when a body was laid out in front of him to save, his brain would go into a sort of overdrive and highlight anything and everything of importance. That had not happened since he had been discharged, though. Now, his brain would still lay out the most important bits when he came across a dead body, but despite that, he could just not compete with the skill encompassed in Sherlock’s brain!
Despite Sherlock’s desperate attempts to drive his body to the brink of collapse, and refusal to listen to anyone regarding what he
, that a banker with a million-dollar pin would leave it with his girlfriend. John did not see that Sherlock was simply intrigued by The Woman, and not in love with her!
This fact was one that did not require much more pondering over, however, as John would soon set all to rights.
But John did
from the scene where the body parts were discarded, and how that led him to the skip they were in now. He stopped the barrage of information in order to continue sorting through the garbage left on the ground before he had been marvellously interrupted by John.
John definitely wanted people to see. He wanted people to speculate. He wanted to see Sherlock’s reactions to such speculations. John himself would preen at such ideas rummaging around people’s brains about him and Sherlock. He wanted everyone to
John was indeed beyond excellent at flirting. He had bagged several people in his 35-year lifespan without needing so much as to lift a finger. Well, once said person had been wooed efficiently, he
). But that did not mean that he would not be ridiculed by Sherlock off and on. John had mostly made his peace with it. However, when his patience was running thin and he was being mocked far too ruthlessly, he would either shout back or leave for a long and winding walk around the city.
, thought John, tugging at the tie he had bothered to wear to the clinic today, and yanking the shoes off of his feet. Laying his shoes next to the door, and hanging up his jacket on the rack behind the door, John heaved a sigh. He worked to keep himself employed in ways other than being required to run after Sherlock, but being a GP was never his goal. He was meant to be a surgeon! Alas, one with a tremor in his hands was not to be employed. This job, however, was more draining than fulfilling.
Sherlock leaving the abandoned warehouse shortly after John and Irene’s shouting match left a bitter feeling in John’s mouth. John didn’t want to wear his heart on his sleeve for Sherlock to deduce and laugh over. However, John also did not want Sherlock to think that any potential idea of a relationship between them was abhorrent to John.
This was a fact that John held so closely to his heart that he did not even dare bring it to the surface of his conscience in the waking hours while he was alone in his room, lying on his bed. John knew he loved Sherlock very early on in their relationship as flatmates. One does not simply kill a man for someone they met 24 hours prior! This was a secret that was John’s, and John’s alone.
Lestrade only looked at John from the corner of his eyes, afraid of derailing Sherlock’s stream-of-consciousness like deductions. When Sherlock stopped to look for something amidst the detritus of garbage near his feet, Lestrade turned to John and said, “When I saw you walk towards Sherlock, I thought you were about to chin the bastard, not snog him!” John turned to look at Lestrade, one of his eyebrows hiked up in a questioning manner, a lovely incongruity with the blush still adorning his cheeks.
Passing on his laptop for Sherlock to read his blog about their first case together, John did not think Sherlock would be flattered. No, sir. John had thought Sherlock would be an absolute ball of mush after reading the almost poetry he had spewed on his blog. He had thought Sherlock would see through him and decide to take up with John, after all. He had thought Sherlock would realise how someone else saw him as human, despite his efforts at showcasing himself as a feelingless thought machine. John had hoped for a completely different outcome, but had instead received a crash course in the psychology behind Sherlock Holmes. Ever the scientist, never the poet.
Sherlock’s breath was knocked out of him at the sudden change in posture followed by the harsh hit of the wall against his back. This was all for the best for John would not have allowed a single word to pass Sherlock’s lips.
Dr. John Hamish Watson, formerly of the Royal Army Medical Corps, Captain in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, was
Incidentally, Sherlock had also shown his own heart at times, unsure of what else to do given the circumstances. Words that he would otherwise have not birthed, had escaped his lungs when their relationship was put to the test.
John made his way towards the kitchen as he was wont to do. Filling up the kettle, John fetched his RAMC mug and a bag of Earl Grey from the cupboard over the sink. All but ready to sink into his sofa with a steaming cuppa, John’s thoughts were snagged out of their reverie with a chime on his phone. Removing his phone from his trousers, John unconsciously walked towards the living room, knowing that it might either be Lestrade or Sherlock asking him to come in for another murder/robbery/kidnapping, what have you.
to leave all parties satisfied, but he was a natural at charming the pants off anyone he set his sights on. The only exception to this had been Sherlock.
someone but was often invited personally by Lestrade. That had to count for something!
Even when Sherlock left John behind, ran too fast on his very long legs, or altogether forgot that John had accompanied him somewhere, John couldn’t help but marvel at the person he was around. It irritated him, don’t doubt that for a second. But John always loved basking in the glow Sherlock exuded when something was worked out, when a piece fit, when the puzzle was solved, when the deduction led them to where they were needed. John loved it, and for that, he would willingly be left behind, but not always.
It had been so straightforward that even
Standing up straight, John took the few steps up to Sherlock, a soft “Right” escaping from between his lips.
”. After all, it’s not as if there was a dearth of people who would happily go to bed with him, as was evidenced by the list of girlfriends he had accumulated since moving into Baker Street.
Panting and slowing down, John made his way across to Lestrade, hunching down to catch his breath and placing his palms on his knees.
a little ways past the absolute surface level that people looked at and didn’t process further in their minds. He knew that no one could come anywhere close to being the eagle-eyed - almost omniscient - creatures that were the two Holmes brothers. However, he was fairly observant, regardless of what it might seem like.
Blushing and moving away from each other, John and Sherlock looked around, flustered, abruptly reminded of just where they were and around whom.
Wanting Sherlock more than anything in the world, and simultaneously not wanting to ruin what they had between them, John had overcorrected. He had to ensure that Sherlock did not get the slightest whiff of his attraction to the same gender, and for the resulting spool of deductions to untangle, to reveal that John held the biggest torch for Sherlock amidst everyone available to him.
Sherlock could yet again not muster enough courage or bring together the air in his lungs to form a response. The manic look in John’s eyes had left Sherlock incapable of stringing together any words in his vocabulary. He dumbly nodded his head, conveying his acquiescence.
Sherlock immediately started listing all the things that were
kidnapped, drugged, tied up and shot at by Chinese gymnasts, transported in the boot of a car, thrown in jail, ended up in a drunk tank, given an ASBO, ridiculed by a dominatrix, had a Semtex vest around his torso, tied up, beat up, and several other things that he had never experienced even while he had been serving in Afghanistan.
Next to Sherlock, this seemed like a joke to even bother admitting. He definitely couldn’t tell someone’s profession by their tie or cuffs, the state of someone’s marriage by the jewellery on them, or where someone was coming from by the soil on their shoes. He sure as hell knew nothing about ash!
Seeing Sherlock continue as usual had knocked John’s knees from underneath him. Oh, of course. He doesn’t feel that way. He’s
be able to deduce. Heck, he was even safe from
had left John with the certainty that Sherlock did sometimes flirt! John, however, being John, did not think much of this (
The facts of John’s life so far could be listed as follows:
John’s love towards Sherlock had progressed gradually. Every titter of laughter escaping their mouths at crime scenes added to it, and every time he lost his temper at Sherlock worked to remind him that Sherlock was just human too. He was not to be placed on a pedestal and given an unholy amount of power over John’s life.
The chase that followed had John running behind Sherlock with more air in his lungs, more warmth in his blood, more love in his heart, and more peace coalescing within himself than he had felt ever before. John would never have to fear being left behind again, and wouldn’t have to worry over Fact Number 10 ever again!
John had lived a fairly fantastic life so far. Being a doctor brought with it stories that he could regale people with at party after party and still have enough left behind to fill books with. Being in the Army had done nothing less, although recounting his time there was more difficult, and would bring bile so far up his oesophagus that he often didn’t deem it necessary to ever bring it up himself. When those around him ever asked, he found one way or another to deviate the conversation to head along a different route altogether. Although, in his life so far, there had been more drama and action than most movies he sat through, more bloodshed than the spy novels he read, and a fair bit of love here and there, John knew all that was eclipsed the moment he stepped foot into Bart’s that fated day.
To the end of his life, John would rue that particular day the most. Sherlock had all but laid his heart out with those words. Sherlock: never expecting anyone to step in to save him, never expecting his own life to be conferred such value, never expecting anything from anyone else. John’s simple action of grabbing hold of Moriarty and asking Sherlock to run had tilted his world on an axis, as was evident in his rambling. Sherlock
) made it evident that John loved Sherlock. When he had screamed
rambled. John could have said anything in return. Could have made his feelings clear. Could have asked Sherlock anything while expecting the absolute truth in return. Instead, John had fumbled and made a cheeky joke.
Unsurprisingly, Sherlock did just that, while surprisingly blushing even further.
that Sherlock belonged to him and he to Sherlock, and no one could change that.
the incisive response of
Somewhere to his left, John heard, “They’re through the alley there. I just got back and do not want to lose my hearing over how much Lestrade was shouting! Better get there before his highness does another runner!” Sally sounded almost worried, something that had never coloured her voice while dealing with Sherlock’s antics in the past.
Sherlock, impossibly enough, blushed even further at hearing the possessive tone in John’s voice. Bending down to leave a quick peck on John’s pink mouth, Sherlock pushed off the wall that wouldn’t even know what monumental development it had been the framework for!
At the pool, seeing the snipers aims targeting Sherlock had left John wanting to scream, “
He had picked up more clues on Carl Powers’ shoes than most would have. He picked up more from dead bodies than a forensics expert (although that might just be Anderson’s shortcoming)! He understood what a criminal’s motives might be, when Sherlock was out of his depth on the understanding of
This had yet to yield anything changing in their personal lives, but John was cautiously optimistic. He hadn’t dated anyone in over 5 months, and Sherlock was staggeringly aware of the same. John thought that he might only have to
A fairly dreary Saturday night saw John return to their flat, only to find it empty.
Recently, John had a dawning realisation that Sherlock was, in fact, flirting with him. The constant invasion of John’s personal space, leering at John’s face with eyes often falling towards John’s lips, inviting John into his own personal space in the ways of asking for the phone
John’s world was drenched in Sherlock, his mind running circles around the self-proclaimed sociopath’s person. What Sherlock was up to, had he eaten, had he slept, was there anything that needed to be done for the house, did he need to go shopping, where was his Sig, were there enough bullets in it, did Lestrade know what they were up to, was there a case they could be called in for, could he call Lestrade if needed…
Sherlock, who had never previously listened to what anyone had to say about his manners, had all but eaten his words when John proclaimed that something he had done was not good. Everyone in the surrounding was left with their mouths hanging, never having seen Sherlock brought down by four simple words.
To be honest, John could
”, and “
”, Sherlock had appeared tremendously chagrined, looking at his own feet and shifting uncomfortably. It was conclusive; Sherlock would be bowed by a few words from John when no one else had ever come closer, and wouldn’t… possibly ever.
was finally making an appearance at a crime scene, something John had never anticipated in his time with Sherlock.
Contrary to what his therapist said and what anyone else may believe, John was a very self-aware man. He did not harbour any illusions about the things he had a knack for and things that were out of his depth. Meeting Sherlock only brought forth these qualities in a more severe manner. Being called out on his deficiencies from time to time did not hinder his self-image, and instead only added to it. How complete, after all, is a man who couldn’t even accept the shortcomings in his innate nature.
Although he would deny it vehemently in front of anyone else, he
John was smart, smarter than most people Sherlock knew (
He was, in fact, such a good cook, that he could get Sherlock to wipe his plate clean on several occasions. Some of these were moderated by the fact that Sherlock had not eaten for a few days during a case, and some purely because the food he had put together was so downright delicious that Sherlock’s mouth and
John simply decided to use Fact Number 8, and not allow anyone, besides those who knew him from Before Sherlock times, to know this about him!
When the kiss had moved from an embrace between two bodies worried about losing each other, to two bodies exploring and devouring each other, almost ensconced within the other's skin, the officers gathered around the skip started whistling and hooting.
! However, John’s unrelenting stance may have turned Sherlock colder towards him, in some aspect, than John intended. John only hoped that he had not destroyed the remotest possibility of anything ever happening between the two of them.
John knew he was caring. He was an excellent doctor thanks to this. He cared to the point of screaming at patients - well,
Before Sherlock devolved into the motions, John said, “Ready to astonish us all with your deductions, love,” loud enough for every single member of the Met standing around to know clearly what they were to each other now.
Unlocking his phone, John smiled at the welcome sight of a text from Lestrade. Hopefully this weekend was about to get a lot more fun, if there was a case to be dealt with. His smile, unfortunately, was wiped clear as soon as John read the text.
Nevertheless, John had all but dedicated his life to Sherlock. No matter to what extent their relationship developed, or the area his feelings spanned across, and how often he was left behind, John wanted nothing and no one more than Sherlock, in whatever capacity he could have him.
John was indeed a scrupulous liar. Neither of the Holmes brothers had been able to deduce that about John. He did not see the need to do it too much, or too often, but when the situation called for it, he was able to lie exceedingly well. John had not been a gambler at University for nothing! John knew when to give something away and when to hold back, and had done so, spectacularly, with both Sherlock and Mycroft.
Turning to look at Sherlock when he dramatically stood up, John could recognise the signs of an oncoming series of deductions potentially leading them to the killer.
As important as Sherlock was to John, to his continued existence in this world, the reverse was true too, if not much truer. John held an important place in Sherlock’s life, regardless of what the latter might say on the matter. John was essential to the work. Although it was difficult to translate at times, being summoned from his work, being woken up in the middle of the night, being spoken to while not in the house/room, being asked to fetch a phone from his coat pocket, not being allowed to finish a meal to instead run out the door after a case were all subtle ways in which Sherlock proclaimed that he would not be able to work without John by his side. To that effect, Sherlock did invariably give himself away with a statement or two.
“Good to see you could get here so quickly, John. I was terrified something would happen to him. Won’t even talk to us today. God know’s what has gotten into him!” Lestrade spoke softly now, the screaming clearly having had an effect on his vocal cords.
had very efficiently shut every single one of John’s systems up. Damn it, John would have to try harder to not display his feelings so overtly. If Irene had been able to deduce this about it, it was only time that Sherlock would too!
It hung heavy across his neck, caring so much for people, and knowing that they could be gone in the next second. But he held steadfast to the belief that caring did not lead to any disadvantages in his life.
The cabbie’s eyebrows nearly merged with his hairline!
“You are too important for this world to die like that, do you understand! I won't be able to take it if you die. I won’t survive. Is that clear!?”
do to be healthy, he had never ignored John. Nibbling slightly on small morsels of food, sipping tea with fervour every time John left a cup by him (either while it was still steaming, or hours later, after it had run cold), Sherlock did it all for John. John allowed the feeling of seeing the gradual and very slight weight gain in Sherlock to balloon up in his chest, and for the joy to flow down every nerve in his body.
John, however, had gone about it in a very erroneous way. The constant barrage of “
prying eyes and ears with this ammunition that he held about his own self, so far deep in his psyche that none but his sister and a few mates from Army possibly knew.
. He was invited on cases not just by Sherlock by virtue of him
and moved
John laughed out loud at the text, only to receive another dumbfounded look from the cabbie at that.
The part time work he kept himself busy with, and the girlfriends he tried to divert his attention with were not even close to being as useful as a band aid on a bullet wound when it came to keeping his mind off Sherlock. He was done for, and it was made even more blatant when the
Oh, how blatant a lie this was. Its beauty lay in the teller of the lie trying to change his own mind about the status between him and his flatmate with such conviction as to try and convince oneself that the potential of a relationship was next to impossible! Yes, Sherlock and John were not a romantic couple, but one could not refute all the other ways that they fit each other like two pieces carved for one another. In the moments that John’s brain went a-wandering down the lane of fantasising about the idea of a relationship with Sherlock, John shut it down by repeating this mantra over and over again in his head.
