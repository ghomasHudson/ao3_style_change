There is also the fact that there are two riders depicted in the foreground of this Cornwall painting, travelling companions who are perfectly in sync and have something vaguely Watsonian and Holmesian about them, as you can see in this section of the painting:
But on the other hand, the fact that this ‘Dangling Garrideb’ scene in TFP pretty much tells us that the ‘Garrideb’ scenario will be hidden in series 2 shouldn’t be dismissed. (As shouldn’t be the fact that Mycroft’s ‘Ashes to Ashes’ inspired bunker office turns up for the first time after s2.) There’s A LOT of stuff that points to the fall in TRF being the beginning of Sherlock’s EMP. Not that I like the idea.
Oh, and while Mary looks after that ‘baby’ (=is the one who’s more concerned with keeping up appearances of actually being in this relationship), John has already emotionally ‘logged out’ of it entirely and is texting the most blatant of Sherlock!mirrors: the woman on the bus.
I’m calling it: The whole case is NOT about actual, real-life murder. This is a case about someone being metaphorically ‘murdered’ (=falling in love).
(By the way, for the purposes of this meta, it doesn’t matter if you think s4 is real or happening in someone’s head. I personally think it’s all happening in Sherlock’s head. But the ‘baby’ metaphor works in either case.)
‘Venus pudica’ style sculptures are, by definition, half covered and half naked, ie, half hidden and half out in the open and nakedly in plain sight.
The fact that there are parallels between the show ‘Sherlock’ and s10 of ‘Doctor Who’ has already been discussed. (
Look, I don’t want to overanalyse this, and I’m sure not every ingredient on this menu has to mean something.
You know, it’s actually quite sweet how Sherlock tries to determine by means of logic which aspect of John it is that he fell in love with. It’s sweet how he thinks you can calculate that in a conscious, rational, mathematical type of way.
No, Mofftiss specifically went with the famous, yet very ambiguous ‘Capitoline Antinous’. And so, we’re stuck with this double meaning of Antinous
Since Hermes is the guider of souls to the Underworld, he has long been seen as a symbol of the unconscious.
And in a metaphorical sense, this is also true for Sherlock after the Reichenbach episode: a man half dead and half alive. To John, he is dead and has been buried, and yet...he’s alive. To the audience, Sherlock appears trapped in an elusive Schrödinger’s-cat-like state after that jump in s2ep3.
Gabriel appeared at the table, but Dean didn’t take notice of him until Cas’s hands were covered in the paste.
‘No. Just the back of his chair. But - there wouldn’t have been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he? But… but then how could he have held the wand?’ Harry said slowly.
Mr Weasley rushed off. Fred, George and Ginny went to raid the kitchen, and Bill and Charlie went to de-gnome the garden.
roared all twenty voices and jets of fiery red light flew over their heads, rebounding off the trees and into the darkness.
‘I see two possibilities, Alastor,’ said Fudge. ‘Either Crouch has finally cracked - more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given his personal history - lost his mind and gone off wandering somewhere-’
And then, the dungeon reappeared. They were sitting in different seats; still on the highest bench, but now on the left side of Mr Crouch. The atmosphere seemed quite different; relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to each other, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event. Rita Skeeter was sitting half way up the rows of benches opposite them, wearing magenta robes and sucking the end of an acid-green quill.
The room began to fill, people arriving in groups of twos and threes. Dean craned his neck over their heads, but Cas hadn’t arrived yet.
'Knowing the past is a burden sometimes,’ Luna said. 'But at least you know there's nothing you can do to change it. But the future is different, I suppose. I can imagine that wondering if you can change it would be stressful.’
‘John should go,’ said Melly, taking the box from him and holding it open. ‘Many wizards use Floo powder, so you shouldn’t be afraid.’
‘Does it have to be all that important? You helped that Neville boy find his toad, didn’t you? And your friend’s brother had fun doing his project on you, didn’t he?’
Then the rest of them went back to their compartment. Once they were all sat down, Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon’s cage to muffle his hooting.
Mr Weasley checked his watch, then suddenly jumped to his feet. ‘We’re late!’ he exclaimed. ‘We have to go, quick boys.’
Seamus and Dean Thomas retreated to their beds, where they whispered to each other, and Neville scooped Trevor and Dolly out of Dolly’s tank to sit on his bed with them in his lap.
‘And what exactly is this “long term issue”?’ Umbridge asked, her voice taking on an even more sugary tone.
‘No!’ shouted Karkaroff, straining against the chains binding him to the chair. ‘I assure you! Severus Snape is a Death Eater!’
Despite his good mood, the nightmares still came for Dean. They were always the same. He or Sam attacked by something. Blood everywhere. Then he would wake up sweating and breathing heavily.
Harry and Hermione were already waiting outside the dungeons. John reached them just as the Slytherins arrived, each of them wearing badges bearing luminous red letters. As they got closer they could see that they read:
‘No, thank you, Dean,’ Sherlock said, adjusting John, who was rapidly falling asleep, into a more comfortable position.
Dean helped him the rest of the way and sat next to the bed. 'Telekinesis, huh? That's pretty cool, but what's with the glowing?'
‘Like them, Potter?’ Malfoy said loudly. ‘And this isn’t all they do - look!’ He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message vanished, then was replaced by another one that glowed green.
The night before Sherlock was due to return from Norway, John woke suddenly, bolting upright in bed. He had not been dreaming, nor was he shivering or sweating. He felt almost normal, but something was off.
John took a deep breath, smoothed out the creases in his jumper and walked inside. He stifled a gasp. He’d been here before, in Dumbledore’s Penseive. The visions bubbled around him, but Sherlock helped him push them away.
John and Dean walked out, grabbing Harry on their way. Only Sherlock and Sam saw the forlorn expression on Castiel’s face.
Instead of smiling, as Dean expected, Cas suddenly looked exhausted and put a shaking hand to his forehead.
They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible, but slipped up by adding chimneys, or weather-vanes. Others were so clearly magical that it was no wonder Mr Roberts was getting suspicious. One even looked like a miniature palace, complete with several live peacocks tethered outside.
John didn’t respond at first. His fists were clenched in front of him on the table, his eyes were flitting around and he was blinking rapidly. ‘Erm...no…’he said eventually, then clamping his mouth shut.
Snape wrote the instructions for a Strengthening Solution on the blackboard, but Dean couldn't read it, so he dug his Potions textbook out of his bag. Cas had already charmed it for him so he could read it, but it was still difficult without Cas to help him. His potion wasn't the clear shade of turquoise it was supposed to be by the time he was finished with it, but at least it was blue rather than pink, like Neville's was.
John found himself between Sherlock and Mrs Weasley in the back seat of the car, and looped his arm through Sherlock’s, uncomfortable with so many people so close to him.
John hurried into the kitchen, closing the door behind him, and hiding them both behind the kitchen counter. He pointed his wand at the door, intending to lock it, but he couldn't remember the spell.
The plant flew together, good as new, and the cracks in the walls sealed themselves again. 'Does it make you feel like this all the time?'
John shuddered. Though they had no effect on him within the memory, he recalled the sensation vividly.
John went up to the boys’ dormitory with Harry, Ron and Neville. Dean Thomas and Seamus were already up there, getting into bed.
Hagrid hastily removed the steak from his face, which was a mistake, because the black and purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. ‘Oh, I… had a bit of an accident,’ he said lamely.
‘Did you… was there any sign of… did you hear anything about your… your...mother while you were up there?’
Contempt welled up inside Dean, and he heard whispers and giggles coming from Lavender and Parvati some way down the table.
The subjects of the other portraits were no longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening. When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name, too.
John sunk down onto a seat at the table, not paying much attention, as he had heard all this already. He noticed that Harry was now describing it as though he had been watching from the sidelines, rather than through Nagini’s eyes.
Dean swallowed as he opened it. Cas had charmed this one as well, but its small font and blocky paragraphs were still intimidating.
Mr Crouch’s voice faded. The dungeon dissolved as though it were made of smoke, and everything faded until all Harry and John could see was each other, all else was swirling darkness…
They all got programmes and Omnioculars – sets of binoculars that had slow motion, rewind and play-by-play functions.
‘I see,’ said Umbridge. ‘I will expect to see the both of you back in class tomorrow, or we’ll see about whether or not you belong at this school.’
‘Large amounts of power attract attention,’ said Oseus. ‘I would advise more caution from this point forward.’
Dean walked around the edge of the room, and was pleased to see the performance improving as he and Harry made suggestions and adjusted stances or grips on wands. He watched from a distance as Sherlock amused himself by Disarming random people, and avoiding John’s attempts.
As Dean expected, most of the class were still wearing confused and nervous expressions. Harry, Neville, John and a Slytherin boy Dean didn’t know were the only ones looking at the Thestral.
‘Okay, give me a minute.’ He sat down and repeated what he’d done out in the grounds, and found Sherlock talking to Castiel. He couldn’t see where they were, but they were sitting down, and Dolly was in his lap. He still looked quite distressed.
‘Don’ worry, they won’ hurt yeh,’ Hagrid said patiently. ‘Righ’, now, who can tell me why some o’ yeh can see ‘em an’ some can’t?’
'How could he leave me like this?' Cas snapped off another branch and hurled it at the Forest treeline. 'It's not fair.' Cas suddenly stormed towards the Forest and Dean chased after him.
'We can't do much by ourselves,' said Ron. 'I mean, all right, we can go and look up jinxes in the library and try and practise them, I suppose -'
Hedwig fluttered down onto Harry’s shoulder as soon as he finished and held out her leg, ready to go.
‘There was Antonin Dolohov,’ he said. ‘I- I saw him torture countless Muggles and - and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.’
John didn’t need telling twice. He swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the dungeons, behind Colin.
‘Maybe you could do with being told to shut up once in a while,’ Gabriel snapped. He rubbed his face, then left to try and find Cas.
Sherlock dropped down next to John and wrapped him in his arms, rocking him gently. 'Shh,' he whispered as John sobbed into his shoulder.
‘No,’ said Mrs Weasley, rubbing his back. ‘You did everything you could. All three of you,’ she added, nodding at Sherlock and Harry. ‘I don’t know what would have happened if you hadn’t seen him at all. They might not have found him for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you all, he’s alive, and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover for Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea the trouble he would have been otherwise.’
‘Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be glad when he passes his Appirition test. Still, not complaining. Quidditch World Cup, wouldn’t miss it for a sack full of Galleons – and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got off easy…’ Mr Diggory peered around at them all good-naturedly. ‘All these yours, Arthur?’
John shook his head, munching on his toast. ‘No, I’ll go today,’ he said. ‘Cas and Dean will be here tomorrow and we won’t have time after.’ He caught a glimpse of Sherlock’s concerned face and quickly looked away. His stomach was suddenly quite fluttery, so he ate some more toast, hoping it would go away.
She gasped, gazing at the fire, Ron dropped his quill, and the commotion woke John and Sherlock. There in the middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius's head, long dark hair falling around his grinning face.
Dean said ‘Hi’ back with everyone else, but he was looking at the ground, scuffing his toes, all of his usual bravado suddenly gone
They all settled into the party, chatting happily and eating the food, until people began asking Harry about his golden egg.
‘Well, I on’y just got back,’ said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at his bag. ‘Maybe someone else came ter call earlier an’ I missed ‘em.’
You’ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don’t want to find yourself in a situation where you’re facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!’ he roared. The whole class jumped again and John’s head throbbed.
‘You can put those away,’ he said, stumping over to his desk and sitting down, ‘those books. You won’t need them.’ He then took out a register and began calling out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list, while the magical eye swivelled around, fixing on each student as they answered their names. ‘Right then,’ he said once he was finished with the register. ‘I’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures – you’ve covered Boggarts, Red Caps, Hinkypunks, Grindylows, Kappas and werewolves, is that right?’
Their workload mounted ever higher in the run up to the Easter holidays and John struggled to keep up. Sherlock didn’t bother, as usual, and instead began giving John his best ‘I’m bored’ pouts when John insisted on spending his free time in the library. When they did catch glimpses of Castiel, it was in the library, but he always had a glazed over look in his eyes. He and Gabriel disappeared home for Easter, leaving Dean to become extremely agitated in the meantime.
Dean remembered how scared everyone around him had been, but he was more confused than anything else, and resigned to the fact that he wouldn't be going to Ilvermorny, and he would be spending the next few years in this strange country. He didn't even know what being sorted into Gryffindor would mean.
Dumbledore waited while Harry got into bed and drew the curtains around him, then approached Sherlock and John. John whimpered in his sleep.
Everything was mixed together, and he could only catch hold of snippets. The Dark Mark, Frank and Alice Longbottom, and Sherlock again being blasted across the Great Hall. Eventually, it released its grip, and John came to on the floor of Dumbledore’s office, his nose still streaming blood.
He waved the smoke away. ‘Cas!’ He heard nothing but a whimper, so he reached out to grab Cas’s hand, but Cas snatched it away, crying out. The smoke cleared and Dean saw Cas’s hands were badly burned, and Cas staring at them. ‘What should I do?’ Dean asked.
Moody uttered a barking laugh. ‘Don’t worry, Watson, you’ve got me for the time being. Anyway, I wanted to apologise for today. I should have warned you what I was going to do, and given you the option to leave.’
‘Pus, Finnigan, pus, and it’s extremely valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus in these bottles. Wear your dragon-hide gloves, it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted.’
Cas nodded and tipped his bag to show Dean that it was almost filled with glasses. ‘I learned a few things from Gabriel.’
‘Not that I’d be any good anyway,’ John said, pushing the thought away. It would all be too much fuss anyway.
Suddenly, the great oak front doors opened, and all the Durmstrang students marched in. Krum lead the way with his date, a pretty girl in robes of periwinkle blue.
With great difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, they crowded around the old boot in the semi-darkness, waiting…
‘I suppose it’ll be our secret, then,’ she smiled, wiping her eyes. Then she turned to Sherlock. ‘You’ll look after him?’
'I must go downstairs,' he said finally. 'I must see to the Diggorys. 'I will see all of you later.'
‘That’s a good point.’ Sherlock pulled some parchment and a quill towards himself and began scribbling.
One of the Nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson’s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backwards.
The Creevey brothers were both very enthusiastic, but they flourished their wands far too much, causing several books to fly off the bookcases instead of each others’ wands. They both seemed very excited to be Disarmed by Sam, who appeared to master the spell quite quickly.
‘Yes.’ Lupin’s eyes briefly flickered up at Mrs Weasley, then back down to Dean. ‘Somewhere in Snowdon, right?’
John shook it, and suddenly saw him standing in front of a lot of people. He couldn’t hear what was being said, but there were flashes from several cameras, then everything compressed into a Patronus in the shape of a lynx before fading. John drank some more of his tea, hands shaking.
Before Dean could ask her to elaborate, the door to the Great Hall opened and a long line of first-years entered, led by Professor McGonagall. She was carrying the Sorting Hat and its three-legged stool.
‘Amos!’ said Mr Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man, followed by the rest of them. Mr Weasley shook hands with a ruddy-faced wizard with a scrubby brown beard, who was holding a mouldy, old boot in his other hand.
‘Oh, he’s going to be fine as soon as they can work out how to stop the bleeding,’ Mrs Weasley smiled. ‘He’s already sitting up and reading the papers.’
‘Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment, and drop it into the Goblet,’ said Dumbledore. ‘Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Hallowe’en, the Goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The Goblet will be place in the Entrance Hall tonight, where it will be fully accessible to all those wishing to compete.
The Entrance Hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors leading to the Great Hall.
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to hhhelcat, fallingapartinside and OtakuElf for the comments! See you again next time!
‘You wanted to see us, Elder Oseus?’ Sherlock said cordially, giving John a moment to catch his breath.
‘I can. We have presented our defense and answered all of your questions, and I am quite certain that the Wizengamot has better things to do than interrogate teenagers. Madam Bones, if you would?’
‘Thank you,’ said the voice. ‘Visitors, please take a badge and attach it to the front of your robes.’
Sherlock helped him up and over to Hagrid’s hut. He knocked on the door, and Hagrid was surprised to see them, but let them in.
John thought about it. ‘Maybe,’ he said. ‘I’ve been having trouble with this connection with Sherlock.’
‘Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,’ Harry said loudly, ‘there was just the minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.’
'IRELAND WIN!' shouted Bagman. 'KRUM GETS THE SNITCH – BUT IRELAND WIN – good Lord, I don't think any of us were expecting that!'
Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark?’ said Ron. ‘They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t they?’
They both went to the middle of the room, John took Molly by the waist and they danced a slow waltz, imitating those around them. It was rather enjoyable, John thought, though he couldn't stop himself from watching Sherlock with Luna over Molly's head.
Sherlock said nothing, but leaned over and started kissing John. Dean took it as his cue to move, and went to stand next to Cas at the window.
Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry. ‘My apologies,’ he said, sitting back down at his desk.
When he returned to the common room, he noticed John and Sherlock curled up asleep on the sofa together. When he walked in, John cracked open one eye and gave Dean a questioning look.
‘Hey, I’m not even here,’ Dean said, shifting so he was facing the fire in one of the comfy armchairs, but watched John out of the corner of his eye, unable to resist his curiosity.
They were finally allowed to go down to dinner. They were late, so everyone else was already down there, except for Hermione. Harry chose to sit by himself at the end of the table, desperate for some peace.
'-I'll know you're back to normal,' said Hermione. 'Harry, yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa's covered in ice, not mice - Harry?'
Gabriel shook his head, chuckling. ‘I shoulda known I couldn’t get one over on you, Sherlock. Yeah, I was with him earlier.’
‘I don’t think we’re going anywhere,’ said Sherlock, holding onto John who was rocking back and forth.
‘Do you think the curse is wearing off?’ John asked Sherlock, sitting down next to a wide tree trunk.
Sherlock and Castiel again sat with the blonde Beauxbatons girl at the Ravenclaw table. It seemed she had been saving them seats.
‘You ought to know, too, that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough. You two, back up to the castle.’
Hermione soon devised a clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice. It was a regular occurrence to see Sherlock and Castiel leaving the Ravenclaw table to come to talk to them, but it would look suspicious if too many people of different Houses went back and forth to talk to each other too often.
‘Golgomath’s lot raided the caves. The ones that survived didn’ wan’ nothin’ ter do with us after that.’
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to OtakuElf, VegasGranny, hhhellcat, SolangeloNeverDies and Novak26 for the comments!
Fred and George looked mutinous, but Ginny sunk down in the nearest chair to her. Ron shrugged and he too sat down. The twins glared at Sirius, then sat down either side of Ginny.
'It's okay. Really. Dad's never been a staying still kind of guy. I doubt it would have been a good idea for him to come back here anyway.' Sam smiled a little too brightly and got up. 'Don't worry about Dean. He'll be fine. Bye Cas.'
'Sure, Muggle Studies would have been a cinch, but I wouldn't get that added bonus of making fun of Trelawney,' Dean laughed. 'Besides, I'm actually kinda good at it.'
Cas nodded his head towards the Whomping Willow and they both slowly climbed through the tunnel for the second time that day. Cas finally lay on his bed, exhausted, and Dean hunted around for somewhere else to sleep, finding another bed that he assumed was Gabriel's. It took a while for him to fall asleep, his mind buzzing with ideas.
‘Oh, details!’ said Bagman. ‘They’ve signed, haven’t they? They’ve agreed, haven’t they? I bet you these kids’ll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it’s happening at Hogwarts-‘
Castiel did return to lessons, and even Defence Against the Dark Arts, now that he knew what was coming.
Sherlock shook his head. ‘There are a lot of people that disagree, but thank you. Don’t worry about tomorrow, I’ll help you.’
‘Oh,’ said Hagrid, said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance towards the corner where Harry, Ron and Hermione stood hidden, ‘oh, tha’ was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.’
‘Not doing nothing!’ Peeves cackled, throwing another balloon at some fifth-year girls. ‘Already wet, aren’t they? Little squirts!’ He aimed another balloon at some second-years who had just arrived.
They both pretended that it hadn’t happened the next morning, but it became John’s best coping method when the dreams were too much. Most nights, when he’d chased Harriet off to Clara’s with his screams, he’d creep into his mother’s room, and curl up beside her while she hummed him to sleep.
Just then, Harry got up and went over to Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, who had just walked through the portrait hole.
‘Yeah, I bet it was,’ said Ron. ‘We met Draco Malfoy in the woods and he didn’t look worried at all, and we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who.’
John looked nervously over at Sherlock, unable to tell if his unease was simply caused by the man’s appearance, or something more. Sherlock furrowed his brow thoughtfully and stared at the man.
'They aren't,' Cas said, from his comfortable spot curled up in an armchair. 'I've tested them, and I have all the antidotes just in case.'
John laughed at them as they continued to make up increasingly tragic predictions for the next hour, and even contributing a few suggestions himself. The common room began to empty, then the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed in. She was carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box, whose contents rattled as she walked, in the other hand. ‘Hello!’ she said. ‘I’ve just finished!’
‘You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,’ Karkaroff said coldly, ‘and a very ingenious theory it is – though, of course, I heard that you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realising it was a carriage clock. So you’ll understand if we don’t take you entirely seriously…’
John cleared his throat and stood up, placing Dolly on his shoulder. ‘Yeah, I’m okay.’ He went into his trunk for some extra parchment and saw the tie boxes he and Sherlock had bought in Diagon Alley.
The first thing John heard when he came around was a loud buzzing, filling the Hall, then Sherlock’s voice whispering, ‘It’s all right, John.’
‘Thanks for letting us stay here,’ said Dean, lugging over the bag containing their tent. ‘So what’s the plan?’
Dean didn’t bother going to lessons, instead spending the morning trying to cheer Cas up, cleaning him up whenever he started to bleed through his clothes. Come lunchtime, however, Cas was still miserable and in pain. Dean changed tack and Summoned to himself a book and a pair of his glasses.
Harry took the seat, and John perched on the edge of the desk, looking around at all the papers and files, and a purple paper plane circling over their head that said
‘Dean, wait,’ said John, calling him back with a slightly glazed over expression. ‘...Ask him when it’s snowing.’
'For sure!' Dean said enthusiastically. 'How many times do you want me to tell you how smart you are?'
When he was done, he felt empty and raw, and gulped down a glass of water while he waited for his mother to say something. It wasn’t until his mother came around the table and wrapped him in her arms, that he realised he was shaking, and cried into her shoulder.
John wrapped his arms around himself and let Sherlock hold him up until the vision played itself out. He bounced off the barrier again and slumped in his seat, Harry's voice floating past.
Harry and Ron, however, had made little progress. Ron threw down his quill and sighed in frustration.
Dean drew screens around their beds again and climbed under the covers. He closed his eyes, but sleep wouldn’t come, so he pretended to be asleep for Cas’s benefit, until he heard Cas’s own soft, steady snuffling. He sat up in the dark, massaging his sore, swollen throat, and looked over at Cas’s sleeping form. He’d left a candle flickering in the dark, and the sight of his peaceful, sleeping face comforted Dean.
'Are you all right?' said Sherlock asked, and John silently cursed himself. He had forgotten that Sherlock could tell what he was feeling most of the time, and made a mental note to hide it better in the future.
He shook the thought out of his head and went downstairs with Harry and Ron. They found a table and set to work on their predictions for the coming month. An hour later, John had finished. His predictions mostly involved the weather, and what little information he could get from small snippets he saw of himself in the future.
Some good news, I got a new computer and desk and everything so things are going a lot better now. For some context, my setup before was a broken laptop hooked up to my tv and a wireless keyboard, so writing was a bit difficult. Now that it's better I'm going to attempt to stick to a two week schedule, so look out for me every two Sundays!
‘Harry - what’s going on?’ asked Ginny, who looked frightened. ‘Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad get hurt-’
‘I think it’s stopping,’ John said, voice barely more than a whisper. John sank further into the chair and shakily attempted to wipe away the tears quickly trickling down his cheeks. ‘I never want that to happen again… it was so awful.’
‘Okay, we’re gonna start with the basic Shield Charm, and then if we have time, I’ll show you the Stunner.’
He pulled a book out and flipped it open to look at the pages. Just as he did, light shone through one of the windows and illuminated him. Motes of dust drifted around his soft curls. Sunlight bounced off his high cheekbones and his lips pressed together in concentration.
They were the same ones he always had, though more vivid than normal. He dreamt of the fire, of Azazel’s yellow eyes, of his mother burning, then it blurred into the night that they were attacked by another Demon. Black eyes and menacing. He had no wand, no weapon but his fists. Launching himself at it was all he could do, clawing and biting at any exposed skin he could find, and he woke with a start with the sound of Sam’s screams echoing in his ears.
'No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,' said Hermione. 'We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.'
A party was raging inside and Fred and George had raided the kitchens. Thankfully, no one noticed John come in, so he was able to slip upstairs to the dormitory unnoticed.
‘Oh, I get it,’ he said, fury creeping into his voice. ‘It all makes sense now, you all knew what was going on, but you didn’t do anything about it because of his power, right?’
Madam Pomfrey looked doubtful, but there was no time to argue, so she unstoppered the phial and started dripping it over Cas’s wounds.
'We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.'
'We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today. Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other's latest night-time visions with the aid of the
They stared at each other for a moment, until John rolled across the floor, under the kitchen table, putting the Full Body-Bind in the Death Eater he'd already jinxed as he went.
‘Well - I thought it was a good idea,’ she said uncertainly, ‘I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there’s nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But… well, if you don’t want to use them - ‘
Dean watched Cas holding his arm and slowly rocking back and forth. His face was still pinched and scared. 'You've kept this a secret this whole time?'
‘I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes. I am now the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher-’
then massaged his neck a little. 'They'll be talking about that one for years,' he said, a bit hoarsely, but at normal volume. 'A really unexpected twist, that… shame it couldn't have lasted longer… ah, yes… yes, I owe you… how much?'
‘My dear woman!’ roared Fudge. ‘As Minister for Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing possibly dangerous-’
John then caused a minor distraction by momentarily passing out on his cushion. ‘I’m all right,’ he mumbled when he sat up again, leaning on Sherlock. ‘Carry on.’
‘He’s just having a tough time,’ Dean said, reassuring himself more than Sam. ‘Nice job on that Stunner, by the way.’
The left tapestry shows us Cleopatra more or less sitting in Mark Antony’s lap, surrounded by flower garlands and little winged cherubs.
We have cause to believe that when John is all alone, without anyone looking on, inside his own head, he is entertaining the idea of engaging with his same-sex desires some more.
(And right on top of Big Ben, at that. That’s a particularly nice fandom present by Moffat, seeing as we’re all speculating that the old homophobic version of Sherlock will symbolically ‘die’ as Sherlock kisses John right there on top of Big Ben or something.)
In TAB, men are either stabbed with a dagger or shot with a gun – an, ahem, long-barreled shotgun. I’m sure there are lots of meta posts already that point out the Freudian theme going on here (I remember recently reading an excellent meta post about Freudian themes on ‘Sherlock’ by
We are also told that they (read: Sherlock) have been in here for quite some time. (I don’t know whether those three months have to be taken literally, but it’s definitely a long time.)
And just look at the description we get of this John!mirror: He’s not simply John’s brain like Nathan, or John’s emotions like Howard. Alex is John’s very core. He is John’s John-ness. He is who John really is deep down.
Often we get several (!) mirrors for one character, a mirror for each and every one of the main protagonist’s personality aspects.
It would make zero sense for Sherlock to refer to the ‘baby’ by Mary’s name ‘Rosamund’. Sherlock is not going to end up in a relationship with Mary, after all. Sherlock’s future has John’s name. It’s really that simple.
It’s a very mysterious painting because nobody quite knows what the two circles might represent, which is probably why the set designers on ‘Doctor Who’ played around with this picture a bit and turned the two (originally empty) circular shapes into Gallifreyan Circles:
). He must have been like...really, really hopelessly head-over-heels-in-love with James, right? And absolutely devastated afterwards when the whole thing ended (=when he returned to civilian life).
But what I haven’t really seen that often yet is a comprehensive reading of the victim and the three dangling men themselves – a comprehensive interpretation of the case Eurus presents Sherlock with, I mean.
Doesn’t sound like an epiphany that John had about his homo-romantic feelings because of Sholto. Sounds...more recent.
Those two aspects of Sherlock (in his own head) represent 1) what Sherlock was like in ASiP when we first met him [=the traditional Sherlock Holmes, so to speak] and 2) what Sherlock could become if he were just brave enough for it. For now they’re both there (in Sherlock’s head) arguing. But they’re also both wrapped in shock blankets because Sherlock is very close to the death threshold in reality.
I hesitate to type out the third possible explanation for the ‘flip’. Because this one is a real head-scratcher, and I really don’t know if I want it to be true. (First and foremost because I can’t imagine Sherlock actually jumping off the roof in TRF and surviving. Much less surviving in a way that would make it possible for him to make a full recovery once he wakes up.) So, I don’t know that I like this interpretation. But I’m mentioning it for completeness sake.
These ‘women’ figures could, among other things, represent his feminine (read: emotional) side. And boy, are those emotions on the war path. They’ve created an entire secret society to kill men (read: Sherlock’s masculinity, the side of people’s mind that’s traditionally associated with reason and rationality).
So, in this TST blog scene, we get an association of the ‘baby’ metaphor with John and Mary again: A very pregnant Mary can be seen in the background of this scene. In other words, the ‘baby’ codes for John and Mary’s relationship here.
In an episode that is all about sex (from the hiker-and-the-backfiring-car deduction to the way Irene represents Sherlock’s libido) this is NO coincidence! Trust me.
Keep in mind that this is most likely the first time that Sherlock has ever fallen in love (or the first time he actively remembers falling in love if you think there actually was a real Victor Trevor in Sherlock’s childhood/youth).
1) The bust is a bust about introspection and self-awareness just like the show is a work of art that’s all about that ancient question of ‘Who am I’ (because who we are matters!).
to its left (green circle), the Rome picture above the fireplace ended up in the frame because it’s always there and they just picked this room because it’s such a grand and luxurious space.
Two statues and Sherlock in between. A statue of a severed head and a statue called ‘Labour’. That’s all his life is.
This is actually a feature Sherlock shares with Moriarty at this point in the narrative: Moriarty in ‘The Abominable Bride’ (TAB) is also half dead and half alive. We are never entirely sure. (Which means that his resemblance to Lawrence in the above painting is a nice little coincidence, but more about that later...)
2) And the bust is all about childhood because that’s what analysts, uh, analyse. Ella’s job is to analyse John’s (and any other patient’s) childhood and to understand its importance for who he is as an adult. So, according to this scenario, that’s what the bust is telling us in the above scene.
And let’s not even mention the fact that the Half-Faced Man had turned into a stitched-together Frankenstein’s monster over the course of several centuries...you know, like the iconic Sherlock Holmes character, who, over the course of 130+ years, through adaptation after adaptation, has become unrecognizable to anyone who fell in love with the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories. Nice joke, that.
Well, before you dismiss this idea as stupid with a ruffle of your curls, a bored scowl and a dramatic twirl of your dressing gown, hear me out:
It’s like a number that can mean different things depending on whether you put a + or a – in front of it. It’s like a switch on an electrical switchboard that means different things depending on its position.
Well, the Half-Faced Man isn’t the only one who’s positioned right in front of the ‘Apollo Belvedere’:
If Mofftiss manage, in s5, to wake Sherlock up, then this is a general commentary on how they have ‘woken up’ the Sherlock Holmes character after his 120-year-long, Zombie-like state of being near-dead.
(Also, it shows up only moments before Zhi Zhu starts shooting. So its quality as a warning sign to look out for danger is established right there.)
And remember that ‘Mycroft’ is the metaphor for ‘the brain’. So, I would argue that Nathan, too, represents some sort of brain aspect. And since all three Garridebs are John!mirrors (or rather mirrors of three different aspects of John), Nathan Garrideb is the John!mirror who corresponds to John’s brain.
All of which happens in the freaking SAME episode as the scenes that, subtextually of course, tell us that John and Sherlock almost had sex with each other while being very, very drunk after John’s stag night.
points out how the little owl in Ella’s (the therapist’s) odd office in s4 is a reference to the ‘Night Owl’ text exchange between John and the bus lady.
And last but not least, never forget how they put the statue of a gay God between Sherlock and John in TBB (
And Sherlock doesn’t seem too enthusiastic about the ‘baby’ (=relationship) being born either; he looks rather shocked about the fact. And Mary tries to push Sherlock as far away from her and John’s ‘baby’ (=relationship) as possible.
There’s also the fact that the ambassador (the [impatient] voice inside Sherlock’s head) has a plastic cup in front of her that probably contains tea. (It’s Georgia, after all; that’s gotta be tea, folks.) And we know what ‘tea’ means, of course.
When a painter wants to create a three-dimensional depiction of something, they will cover first one of their eyes and then the other to gauge the depth of three-dimensional space. They cover one eye, then the other, then they sketch in a few lines that show them how perspective is going to work in their painting. So, yeah, covering one eye changes perspective.
Yeah, Winckelmann didn’t just happen to be gay; he was exultingly and vibrantly gay. And that in 18th century Germany. And pretty much revered by his contemporaries for his re-discovery of all those Greek, Roman and Greco-Roman sculptures, revered for his love of male bodies even.
Let’s assume this ‘murder’ of Evans is actually about Sherlock, once again, obsessing about the question of how he was metaphorically ‘murdered’ (=how he fell in love).
[So, it] looks like they just combined the long-ish bamboo with the curls on top (=Sherlock) and the (bisexual) Monstera (=John) [...] in one vase, instead of putting them in separate ones.
There was a cage to symbolically lock something in, but the window is broken now, so the ‘bird’ has escaped. Let’s not even go into who’s caging his feelings in and has let something slip out because seriously, I’m getting a headache from all this symbolism...The scene progresses from here like this: cage/broken window > dagger with Moriarty’s note > St. Lawrence painting (see above) > Reichenbach painting in Mycroft’s room.
And the sculpture’s sole purpose in this scene is to show how protected Sherlock is, how no bullet can really harm him when he has John as his shield.
Well, why would Sherlock need to determine which John!mirror (=which aspect of John’s personality) metaphorically ‘murdered’ him?
Over the years, I have seen people in this fandom take a stab in the dark a few times, guessing vaguely that it might be some bust of Antinous, the lover of the Emperor Hadrian.
A dagger and a gun? Really?  Both tied to the idea of pain? And he’s not alarmed by the idea of sex (specifically gay sex)? I remember having those kinds of dreams a long time ago. Let’s just say that I don’t buy Sherlock’s proclaimed insouciance on the matter. It’s only natural to be scared of something that can cause you pain, after all – even if that fear is inextricably entangled with your desires for it.
First and foremost...let’s keep in mind that a very important number of scenes in the VERY SAME episode (TSOT) deals with Sherlock’s and John’s attraction for each other WHILE INEBRIATED after the stag night!
While this isn't technically about a painting used in the set design of BBC 'Sherlock', I did, in fact, argue in the last chapter that the sculptures appearing on 'Doctor Who' were deliberately chosen with a 'Sherlockian' perspective in mind. So, I thought I could maybe stick this little meta in here; it seems quite fitting after the last chapter took a stab at examining the parallels between Moffat's two shows. Even if you're not a Whovian at all, I think this painting might give us a little hint that the two shows have to be read as one.
Jenny (aka John) mirrors Canova’s ‘Venus Italica’. And Madame Vastra (aka Sherlock) mirrors the ‘Venus de Milo’.
I’m sure Man Ray knew exactly what a peach reminds the viewers of when he took this rather artful photograph of the, ahem, ‘rear’ end of a peach in 1930:
The two tapestries by the Flemish master Jeroen (Hieronymus) Le Clerc are from the late 17th century and depict scenes from the life of Cleopatra and Mark Antony.
That would be about the hiatus, right? John realised that what he had been feeling for Sherlock was love. And he realised it after TRF. That realisation (laser surgery) made him turn away from his homosexual side and choose to pursue something safe...somebody who wouldn’t jump off a building in front of him...somebody like Mary. A woman.
animals, for lack of a better word. Strutting about and showing off ‘their stuff’ like that!:) There’s a reason we have the expression ‘peacocking’ in the English language.
When it comes to Mark Antony, we should keep in mind that he killed himself with his own service weapon (in his case a sword). Remember how we get hints that John is thinking of committing suicide with his own service gun in ASiP?
If you look carefully, you will find lots of little homoerotic details in the ACD!canon. Because of the sensibilities of the prudish Victorian era, these had to be hidden in the subtext, though. It’s only with time (over the decades) that they started to reappear.
Sherlock is a scientist, and as a scientist he is trying to understand what about John it is EXACTLY that made him fall for John. And knowing which of the three John!mirrors ‘killed’ Evans (=Sherlock) is of the utmost importance to Sherlock here, as demonstrated by the do-or-die-urgency of this Sherrinford task presented to him by Eurus.
Eurus’s tasks are very important. They are a creative way for Sherlock to solve his own case. Step by step by step...
Or maybe both interpretations of the metaphorical ‘laser surgery’ (John’s realisation about himself because of James Sholto and John’s realisation about his feelings for Sherlock after TRF) are right at the same time. Who knows...
And I find it extremely hard to imagine that anyone could put an owl like that on Ella’s sideboard, without realising that it looks exactly like Bosch’s famously nightmarish creatures.
Nice placement right between Sherlock and his character mirror Soo-Lin. Right above her hand with the tea pot (!)...just in case we didn’t get the whole “Venus + tea (gay love)” subtext...Haha!
Also, this scenario would fit nicely with the bust’s title ‘La Boudeuse’ (the sulking one). After all, John is the grumpy one on the show, as per ‘Word of God’.;)
Mycroft (=Sherlock’s brain) is desperately trying to lose weight (the opposite of eating, which on this show is a metaphor for sex, as we all know). Sherlock’s brain is trying to be ascetic. It’s trying to get itself and all these urges under control. It’s running on a treadmill. It’s trying to keep lean, to push all of these unwanted pounds from eating food (=sexual desires) away. Sherlock’s brain is trying to rid itself of those erotic urges...whilst Sherlock is attending John’s wedding!!!
‘I don’t know,’ John said before Dean could say anything. He too was craning his neck to see over the crowd, but in search of Sherlock instead. ‘No, they’re not together. Sherlock’s here somewhere.’
‘I didn’t say it was,’ Dean said soothingly. ‘Look, Cas, this stuff happens, even with wizard’s magic. Harry told me about that time he inflated his aunt, you remember that? That was way worse than this, and he did that without angel magic.’
doing anything wrong,' Hermione said through gritted teeth. 'They're quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I can't find a rule that says the other idiots aren't entitled to buy them, not unless they're proven to be dangerous in some way.'
He spent most of the lesson staring into space, unwilling and unable to focus on what Professor McGonagall was saying.
Cas nodded and slowly got to his feet. Dean walked him to the castle with his arm still around Cas’s shoulders until Cas shrugged him off at the Entrance Hall.
‘He says he’ll be delighted,’ said a bored voice; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. ‘My great-great-grandson has always had an odd taste in house-guests.’
He threw himself out from under the table, deflecting the curse coming at him without even hearing what it was. He pushed his mother back down, tripping over the Death Eaters on the ground. ‘Mum, get-’
‘I got your potion, here.’ Dean gently lifted his head and helped him drink it. Immediately, colour returned to his cheeks, and he smiled at Dean.
Sherlock knocked on the front door, which was immediately opened by the plump Mrs Weasley, wooden spoon in hand.
Mrs Watson placed a cup of tea down in front of him, and kissed the top of his head. ‘It could be worse,’ she said bracingly. ‘If - if I understand it, it would have been worse if you’d gone straight back to Hogwarts, right?’
Fred fell into a doze, his head lolling sideways on his shoulder. Ginny curled up like a cat in her chair, but with her eyes wide open. John could barely keep himself awake, but with one hand on Ron and the other clutching Sherlock’s hand, he had to keep watch.
‘Sorry we’re late,’ said Padma, ‘some third years were trying to steal the Venomous Tentacula from the greenhouse.’
Dean sat miserably at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the match, poking at his bacon with a fork. Cas wasn’t there, but Dean hadn’t expected him to be. Opposite him, Ron was staring down at the dregs of milk in his bowl of cereal, looking as though he were seriously considering drowning himself in it.
Neville shrugged. ‘It’s just the truth. Most of us feel the same way – well most of us that know about it anyway – so I don’t think anyone really minds if you see something a bit private.’
John moved towards the reception desk with everyone else, but was shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril.
The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point, too.
Dean had also arrived with Katie Bell, both of them wearing light grey coloured robes. Dean’s hair had been carefully combed and gelled, and he was grinning around at everyone.
Cas wordlessly handed Sherlock a goblet of water and put a hand on his shoulder. ‘He’s going to be all right,’ Cas said.
Dean wasn’t expecting to see Cas the next morning, after the stressful night they’d had, so he was surprised to find Cas waiting for him in the common room.
said Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. 'I… I think I
The Hogwarts students all sat down at their House tables. The Beauxbatons students had already chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table, and they were all looking around the Hall with glum expressions. Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.
Cas held his head in his hands. 'There were creatures that lived in the mountains a long time ago. No one remembers their true name, but they inspired the modern idea of.. of angels.'
Dean Summoned the potions and they flew out of Umbridge’s desk. He stuffed them into his pocket and rushed back out of the room. ‘
Dean was distracted for much of the day after that. Cas’s French always caught him by surprise, but he liked the sound of it; it gave him an idea.
‘Helpful.’ John groaned and leaned back in his chair, but the spinning still refused to cease. ‘Eurgh, I feel sick.’
John himself was asked to go by a fifth year Hufflepuff. He almost said yes, but then he saw Sherlock walking past, and politely declined. Instead, he steeled himself to ask Sherlock.
‘In something unnecessarily ostentatious I assume,’ said Castiel, teeth chattering. ‘I hope they’re here soon. It’s cold.’
She was half right. At the very last moment, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiralled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.
At around six o’clock, the bell rang, waking Mrs Black. Her screaming reverberated through John’s head, but she was soon quietened, and in came Hermione, Sam and Dean - Dean tripping into the kitchen.
It took a moment and squeezing Sherlock’s hand to find Mr Weasley sitting outside the door he was guarding, still under the Invisibility Cloak. It was easier to watch him in real time, rather than casting his mind around for the incident when he didn’t know when it would happen.
‘You should have seen Krum,’ Ron interrupted. ‘He was absolutely amazing, and we got to see him right up close, as well. We were in the Top Box-‘
Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville’s robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get to Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.
‘You are further accused,’ bellowed Mr Crouch, ‘of using the Cruciatus curse on Frank Longbottom’s wife, when he would not give you information. You planned to restore He Who Must Not Be Named to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury-’
'Poppy,' Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, 'would you be very kind, and go down to Professor Moody's office, where I think you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us.'
‘I get it,’ said Dean. ‘I dream about bad stuff happening to Sam too, sometimes. But I’m sure Gabriel’s okay. He’s tough.’
John hung back by the door, uncomfortably aware that he didn’t belong there, and waited for Bagman to tell him what he wanted.
There were muddy boots by the back door, with a rake and shovel hanging on pegs above them. He must enjoy gardening, John thought. There were unopened letters on the counter addressed to Frank Bryce. Since there didn’t seem to be anyone else living here, then this must be Frank.
‘Because it is a room that a person can only enter when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped with the seeker’s needs. Dobby has used it, sir.’ Dobby dropped his voice, looking guilty. ‘When Winky has been very drunk, he has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to Butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir… and Dobby knows Mr Filch has found extra cleaning materials in there when he has run shirt, sir. It is the most amazing room, sir.’
Dean's mind once again wandered back to Cas. He would have been listening intently, Dean bet, and the thought if Cas's face deeply concentrating made him smile. Dean sighed. He'd never expected himself to feel so strongly about someone, but he just couldn't push it away.
Umbridge spent the first half an hour making notes in her corner, then got up to ask Snape some questions.
It showed the orbs again, then he nearly dropped it when the Dark Mark suddenly appeared. He shoved it back into the bag.
‘It’s not quite so simple when he’s been residing in the UK for the last twenty years,’ Sherlock told him. ‘Trust me, I’ve been through this before. No one will do anything unless we either catch him in the act, or Castiel testifies against him.’
‘Tell me what?’ said Mrs Weasley, who had just entered the kitchen, eyes narrowed in suspicion. ‘Oh, hello, Harry dear,’ she said, spotting him. ‘Tell me
‘Harry, have you heard from-‘ Ron began. He had been about to ask Harry about Sirius, but stopped as he remembered Ginny was in the room.
During May, John continued to try and fight past the curse on his visions, but the barrier seemed as impenetrable as it had been all year. He went up the the North tower twice more to look at crystal balls. Though he was still drawn to them, every time he picked one up, the energy from it made it almost impossible to keep a good grip on it. A far cry from how easy it had been to see shapes inside the year before, when they had been studying the crystal ball in Divination.
‘Not messing about, Molly, dear,’ said Mr Weasley imploring, ‘it was just something Pye and I thought we’d try - only, most unfortunately - well, with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped - ‘
Ludo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person around. He was wearing long Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of black and yellow. An enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest. His nose was squashed, but his round blue eyes, short blond hair and rosy complexion made him look like an overgrown schoolboy.
and a bunch of flowers burst from the tip. ‘Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order.’ He scooped up the flowers and handed them to Fleur with her wand.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. 'These dream diaries are worthless though. My dreams are never about the future.'
Sherlock pulled his hand away, then sighed and rubbed his forehead. ‘I’ve never told you this… They weren’t able to reverse the Memory Charms he put on me. I still don’t remember most of our second year.’
‘I think they’ve stopped arguing,’ Hermione said hurriedly to cover up the awkward silence, as Ginny was looking curiously from Harry to Ron. ‘Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?’
Listen to me! Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck - I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help. Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?' he said heatedly. 'I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of it because I was brilliant at Defence Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because - because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right - but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing - STOP LAUGHING!'
Dean shuffled his feet in the cold. ‘Do you need to? Isn’t the question whether or not you want to be with me?’
Then came the Irish team. Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly. The second crash seemed to have dazed him. His eyes were unfocused, but he grinned happily as Troy and Quiggley lifted the cup into the air. They then left to perform another lap of honour, Lynch on the back of Connolly's broom, grinning in a bemused sort of way.
‘They couldn’t find who it was, and even though Winky didn’t do it, Mr Crouch fired her anyway,’ Hermione frowned.
‘Well said!’ said Ernie Macmillan. ‘Personally, I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we’ll do this year, even with our OWLs coming up! I’m at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at such a critical period. Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is actively trying to prevent us from using defensive spells-’
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. ‘What about the others?’ he said. ‘What about Harry? He’s still in the Tournament, and he still needs us.’
‘Was - was that okay? Did I say it wrong?’ Dean said anxiously. ‘That’s how Fleur told me to say it-’
Immediately Hermione launched into suggestions of who he should talk to, and Cas went digging through his pockets for something useful. Sherlock sat up straight and Ron went white.
'But I think - correct me if I am mistaken - that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of Second Sight?'
‘Cas, if this were any other kid, would you blame them? Say if something like that happened to Sam, would you say it was his fault?’
‘He might’ve mentioned it, yeah,’ said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly, ‘but I thought a good, sharp shock-‘
Mad-Eye Moody was sitting there, though he didn't have his magical eye, just two normal ones. Both were looking down upon Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.
Dean offered snack after snack, but Cas rejected all of them, until Dean insisted he eat one thing. He took a few crackers and nibbled on them. Once he was sure Cas was calm, Dean elbowed him playfully. 'You were supposed to tell me if you needed me.'
‘I’m worried they won’t want me on the Ravenclaw team anymore, if I miss too many practice sessions this week,’ Cas confessed to him at lunch.
‘It sounds as though you’ve been trying to sew your skin back together,’ said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, ‘but even you, Arthur, wouldn’t be that stupid-’
'Yeah. He thought that once Dad had taken care of Azazel and his gang, then he could come home and we'd be a real family…'
‘I-I- ‘ But he lost his nerve. ‘Nothing. Never mind.’ He turned over, so he was facing the back of the sofa, to both avoid looking at Sherlock and to cover up his burning cheeks. Sherlock didn’t question him any further, and he forced himself to sleep.
‘Come off it,’ said Ron, starting to laugh. ‘Durmstrang’s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts, how are you going to hide a dirty great castle?’
He went up to bed, thankful that he wouldn’t have to see Umbridge’s awful toad face until the next evening, or so he thought.
He didn’t stay long enough to talk anymore, and left to go to bed. Sam crawled into bed beside him and drew the curtains.
Dean sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. ‘Cas, I really don’t want to talk about it. It wasn’t exactly fun for me.’
Cas rubbed his arm. 'Gabriel was badly hurt,' he mumbled. 'I didn't know what to do, I didn't have my wand, and it just… happened.'
‘So, what set it off this morning?’ Dean asked as they walked across the lawn. ‘Was it that notice? I’m pretty sure we’re doing the defence lessons anyway, but if you’re worried, you don’t have to do it.’
Dean and Harry were up early the next morning, and walked down to breakfast together, discussing what they were going to teach. Cas joined them at the Gryffindor table, looking well-rested.
Dobby’s ears drooped slightly. ‘Winky is still drinking lots, sir,’ he said sadly. ‘She still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of the will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish!’ Dobby sank into a deep bow. ‘But Harry Potter does not seem happy,’ Dobby said timidly. ‘Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now.’
Dean stood still while Cas practised on him. Cas didn’t look like he’d be up for much, so Dean let him slide by doing the minimum amount of work, until Dean and Harry started walking around and observing.
‘That’s sick,’ Ron muttered, watching the small Muggle boy spinning like a top, his head flopping limply from side to side.
At las, they reached the very top and found themselves in a small box situated exactly half way between the goalposts. There were two rows of purple chairs, although a few extra ad been squeezed into one corner for the Winchesters and Castiel.
She squeezed his shoulder as she placed a fresh mug of tea in front of him. ‘It’s all right,’ she said. ‘I’m not angry with you, I just want you to feel better.’
'Right then, everyone listen closely - Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again, I shall put you in detention - most of you have successfully Vanished your snails and even those of you who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell. Today, we shall be-'
'Shh.' John yanked her from her bed. 'They're coming.' He desperately tried to wake Sherlock, pushing through the pain it caused him as he pulled his mother down the stairs.
Dean shrugged. ‘He was practically catatonic by the time I got him to Madam Pomfrey, but she says he’ll be okay.’
Dean woke early again, just after dawn, and decided to walk out in the grounds again. The cuts on the back of his hand still burned and he needed to clear his head. He passed Cas asleep on the sofa on his way out, but judging by the shadows under his eyes, he hadn't been asleep long, so Dean crept through the common room.
‘Hi, I’m looking for John Watson,’ she said, holding up a big glass tank, with a large toad sitting contentedly inside.
From their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the suddenly tumultuous waters. There was a disturbance taking place deep in the centre. A whirlpool had appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake floor.
‘Look, we’re all going to visit Mr Weasley later, why don’t you come with us?’ John suggested, attempting to make him feel better.
‘There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,’ Moody retorted in a menacing voice. ‘It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff, as you ought to remember-‘
‘I was just talking to Krum and Mr Crouch just appeared out of the Forest, but he was acting really weird. He didn’t know where he was and he kept talking like Percy was there. But he would switch and say something about warning Dumbledore, and he mentioned his son, and Bertha Jorkins.’
From then on, whenever Umbridge confiscated his glasses, he would put on a new, more ostentatious pair of glasses, much to the amusement of Fred and George, who began betting on what sort of glasses Dean would wear next.
The rest of them waited in the common room until half past seven, when Harry opened the Marauder’s Map and checked where Filch, Mrs Norris, and all the teachers were. They hurried up to the seventh floor, to the blank bit of wall that Dobby had described.
They filed down the front steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already shining over the Forest. John felt himself being drawn towards the trees, as did Sherlock.
echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached the end of the table and limped heavily towards Dumbledore. A flash of lightning crossed the ceiling and John cringed.
‘I couldn’t find much about Beauxbatons, though,’ said Hermione. ‘Only that it’s in France somewhere.’
'Unless I'm much mistaken, Mostafa is attempting to send off the Bulgarian Team Mascots!' said Bagman. 'Now
Hey welcome back! Thanks to rainingcatz and hhhelcat for the comments :) I hope you're all enjoying it so far and I'll see you next time!
They climbed the stairs all the way up, but Dean held Cas back outside the portrait of the Fat Lady.
Cas was quiet on the way back to his dormitory, but Dean was relieved when Cas’s little finger hooked around his.
'Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team. I give you – Dimitrov!'
John reluctantly opened his mouth. ‘It’s so hard,’ he admitted, shaking his head. ‘You should have been the Seer, not me. I’m not - I’m not smart enough.’
Hagrid looked thoroughly confused, Fang barked madly at the door, and Dean shoved the extra mugs under the cushion in Fang’s basket.
'Oh, that's always worth watching,' said Mr Weasley. 'National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.'
‘I can’t help it,’ John murmured back. ‘Do you think you could - I mean you’ve helped me suppress it before…’
‘There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s where we’re headed.’ Mr Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose from the ground.
Fred took a deep breath, every eye in the Entrance Hall on him, and stepped over the line. For a split second it looked as if it had worked. George certainly thought so, for he let out an excited yell and leapt after Fred - but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the circle. They landed painfully on the cold stone floor, then there was a popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical, long white beards.
'It's time out!' yelled Bagman's voice. 'As trained medi-wizards hurry onto the pitch to examine Aidan Lynch!'
‘Whoa,’ he said, sitting up. ‘That was real good, Cas. Wow. Can’t wait to see what you’ll do with a Stunner.’
John laughed again, and started pulling clothes out of his wardrobe and stuffing them into his trunk.
‘Okay, we gotta get the other side,’ Dean said, his heart wrenching at Cas’s screams. ‘We’re almost there, you can do this.’ He rolled Cas over, so Madam Pomfrey could put the remainder of the anti-venom over the cuts in his back.
They queued up outside the classroom, where Hermione joined them right at the last minute, after having been in the library. When they entered, they took seats at the front of the classroom and pulled out their copies of
‘And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years,’ said Mr Weasley. ‘Of course people panicked… it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.’
‘Magical transportation,’ Sherlock explained. ‘A little like Apparating, but for large groups of people.’
‘Yes, well,’ Hermione said hastily, ‘moving on… the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry and Dean?’
Hermione, who had chosen to watch their snowball fight rather than join in, told them she was going back upstairs to get ready for the Ball.
Mrs Weasley began chopping up potatoes. ‘I’m sure he’ll tell you what’s wrong when you get back to school.’
‘Easy,’ said Dean. ‘He comes to live with me and Sam, and if his dad ever tries to get near him again, I kill him.’
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand, his heart wrenching. He could see quite plainly on Dean’s face how concerned he really was, and wished more than anything he could use his power for something helpful for once. He got to his feet with a new determination.
‘The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone’s got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!’ he barked, making everyone jump. He picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar. ‘Anyone else know one? Another illegal curse?’
Welcome back everyone! Thanks again to rainingcatz and hhhelcat for the awesome comments! Hope you all enjoy it and I'll see you next time!
‘Anti-Muggle pranksters,’ said Mr Weasley, frowning. ‘We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing - well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling those -
‘Oh, how lovely,’ Mrs Weasley smiled ‘You’ll have a great time.’ She then cast her gaze over Castiel and tutted. ‘Really, you and Sherlock are just as bad as each other. Here.’ She waved her wand and ingredients flew out of different cupboards, then made themselves into sandwiches. ‘Eat these. They’ll tide you over until dinner.’
John saw what Harry had caught sight of: a silvery white light shining through a crack in the door of a cabinet. ‘Harry, I don’t know…’ John said, but Harry had already pulled open the cabinet door, so John hurried over to join him.
John elbowed him to let him know that he wasn’t helping. ‘Everything gets invented somehow, Mrs Weasley,’ John said gently. ‘You never know, they could be on to something.’
‘Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?’ said Nick. ‘They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning, see to the fire and so on. I mean, you’re not supposed to see them, are you? That’s the mark of a good house-elf, isn’t it, that you don’t know it’s there?’
Ron glanced furtively at his mother, then leaned closer to whisper to him. ‘We heard them all talking about Harry, saying he might be possessed by You-Know-Who.’
‘Arthur,’ she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, ‘you’ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had them changed a day early? They said you wouldn’t need them doing until tomorrow.’
himself to be acting on You-Know-Who's orders - but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore-'
He was on the sixth stair when there was a loud, wailing klaxon-like sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working like windmills, then he toppled over backwards and slid back down, landing at Harry’s feet.
‘Sir - sir, Mr Bagman wants them,’ he said nervously. ‘All the champions have to go, I think they want to take photographs…’
he heard someone say, in just as much disgust as he felt. It sounded like Hermione, but when he turned around, it was someone he didn’t recognise at all.
Dean pulled out his own wand and stuck his tongue out, with Cas peeking at him over his book. Dean began muttering and he cut off all the lace first, then made a long line of thread spool out of his wand to sew up all the frayed ends. He shrunk the large, pointy collar, and shiny ostentatious buttons. ‘Okay, I think I might be able to change the color, but there’s not much I can do about the fabric. What d’you think?’
This has all been discussed amongst fans before, and it’s all shown to us in that one ASiP scene: Sherlock (representing the BBC Sherlock show) is trying to get a reaction out of Sherlock Holmes, the dead body (the character that has been done to death).
After all, it wouldn’t make any sense if Sherlock were actually trying to determine who he fell in love with in a line-up of three separate, different people. He KNOWS he fell in love with John. So, all three of them have to be John.
The other person could be an absolute scoundrel, who’s really stupid sometimes and totally looks like crap, and you would still feel the same way about them.:)
Howard on the left has to be John’s heart/emotional aspect because he corresponds to John (ie, Sherlock’s heart aspect).
So, if we interpret this painting as a representation of the Doctor himself, doesn’t that technically mean that the two circles represent two worlds for him, too?
What I mean is: It’s possible that Mofftiss are accentuating something else here : The whole of s4 (and TFP in particular) ARE a flipped ‘Garrideb’ scenario.
That is one whopping statement. A statement of how sometimes you crawl back into the closet AFTER an important self-realisation. Out of sheer panic and fear. You crawl back into the closet after your eyes were metaphorically opened to something.
That’s why he yells, “Careful! Some of those skulls are over two hundred thousand years old! Have a bit of respect!”
So, now, that we’ve talked about all this serious stuff, let’s cheer ourselves up a bit again, ‘kay?
All aspects of John are going to end up in Sherlock’s emotional ‘ocean’ because no matter what Sherlock tells himself consciously about what he loves about John....he actually loves ALL of John. Even the fucked-up parts!
Yes, I know we've talked about this statue before, but not in the context of the infamous Vatican cameos.:)
And dancing (which Sherlock loves) represents making love and loving someone romantically, which is what the sculpture tells us.
He calls the baby ‘Watson’. Sherlock’s future is associated with the name Watson. (Because Sherlock will marry John, either literally or at least emotionally. Obviously.)
To make sure we get that joke about it being half-hidden, yet also in-plain-sight, the set designers specifically chose the ‘Aphrodite of Knidos’ by Praxiteles (
This would mean that the bust (a head!) appears at the beginning, right at the start of s1ep1 (on a show called ‘Sherlock’!), to foreshadow the fact that a large part of the story will play out in the main character’s head.
And that’s not a sleeping lion or anything. That animal is roaring, all muscles straining, showing its teeth. Well, that’s just SO John when someone attacks his Sherlock, isn’t it?
Unfortunately, this one isn’t just blurry. The angle of that frame is so unfortunate that we can’t really make out anything.
So, that’s our metaphor for heterosexuality on this show; that’s the heterosexual side of John’s dual sexuality, so to speak.
So, having established why 'Sherlock in a coma' would make sense metaphorically, let's now look at some of the more concrete evidence for this scenario.
They are both shown in profile, facing the same direction. As if to underline that THEY ARE THE SAME. The ‘Apollo Belvedere’ is Sherlock. And Clara, too, is a Sherlock!mirror. The curly hairstyle they both sport here highlights that fact even more.
Yeah, that’s the best thing Mycroft (=the author) can come up with at that moment. Isn’t that just the most romantic thing you can say about a ‘baby’ (=relationship)?
Sherlock is clearly and logically trying to parse out here what exactly it is about John that made him fall in love with John. And THIS aspect, in Sherlock’s opinion, wasn’t the one that ‘did it’ for him.
Sherlock is remembering the stag night and probably regretting the fact that nothing happened between him and John when the two of them were drunk and uninhibited enough...so that something could have potentially happened.
(By the way, I recommend refraining from googling the words ‘peaches’ and ‘butts’ together; I guarantee you, you will get less artful, far less tasteful photographs than the Man Ray one in seconds.:))
But this is a general feature of Goethe’s ideas. And this might be one of the reasons why our Sherlock likes him. Goethe was ahead of his time on almost everything.
That’s what respectable art textbooks and art historians have to say about Piet Mondrian. Needless to say, I don’t have a respectable bone in my body, am suspicious as hell and like to entertain a whole lot of not-so-respectable thoughts on this topic.:)
I’ve seen a lot of anti-EMP-people argue that EMP doesn’t make any sense because it wasn’t in the original ACD!stories:
EMP is a commentary on what has been done to Sherlock Holmes for the last 120 years in adaptation after adaptation after adaptation.
So, in conclusion, let me just say that, no, I don’t believe any of these sculptures were put there by accident; they all add an, erm, ‘interesting’ layer to the subtext of the show.
And I have only decided to post this now because @dinner-starving had asked me about any new meta coming up. Apparently I need a kick up the backside sometimes.:)
The show has done this countless times before, and whenever it ‘cut off the head’ of some world-famous statue, it was meant to be read as Sherlock.
As long as John is alone with himself, he can look at this ‘baby’ (his love life) and entertain the idea of going after what he wants. He is already toying with the idea.
Sherlock specifically mentions martyrdom in TAB when he says about Emilia Ricoletti, “Every great cause has martyrs.” It’s not just her that he means... It’s just that Sherlock’s motives aren’t religious or political. His motives are all invariably centered around John and John’s well-being. (Well, he did literally restart his heart for John in series 3, after all.)
‘It is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter-house Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.’
‘How d’you – never mind.’ John shook his head. ‘I can’t work out why I feel – uncertain about it, but it doesn’t feel dangerous. Maybe I fall over or something. Whatever it is, just because something feels a bit off doesn’t mean I shouldn’t go. It’ll still be fun, even if I do know who wins.’
Dean snorted. 'Don't worry about her. In fact, I've probably been such a terrible date already that you'll definitely have a shot after this.’
This time, Mr Crouch made no move to stop them as Sherlock marched them out of the clearing. It wasn’t until they were about half way out of the woods that they realised Harry, Ron and Hermione had not followed them.
Mycroft had ordered them several Ministry cars for their journey, but they were not prepared for the over-excited Pigwidgeon, fireworks exploding out of Fred’s trunk, or Crookshanks clawing up one of the drivers’ legs. Thankfully, Dolly was quite content to sit in her tank, warbling quietly, so they didn’t have to deal with an escaped toad on top of everything else.
Yeah, yeah, Sherlock, we get it. Your own homosexuality is, of course, oh-so-refined and oh-so-cultured. *rofl* While John’s homosexual side is a wild animal with long, scratchy nails. John’s homosexual side is so wild and so, so raucous.:) While Sherlock’s transport (or so Sherlock seems to assume) is just some tame servant driving him around. Unimportant and easily dismissed.
(If you don’t know what St.Nicholas Day is because your country doesn’t celebrate it, then this is just a present for funsies. Enjoy.)
What does that tell us about how Sherlock feels about John entering into a relationship with Mary?...Yeah, exactly!
It’s not just that Goethe was one of the many admirers of Winckelmann (and endorsed the Apollo Belvedere statue himself, too), no, Goethe actually knew full well that Winckelmann was gay and acknowledged it with a rather surprising nonchalance (for the time). In his 1805 treatise on Winckelmann, Goethe acknowledged not just Winckelmann’s sexual preferences, but also the fact these were inextricably tied to Winckelmann being such a great scholar and sculpture expert in the first place.
By the way, there is, in fact, a second painting in that ‘Sherlock’ scene, but due to the angle of the frame it’s impossible to make out.
If you don’t think we will eventually get a reveal that Sherlock has been inside his EMP all along, fine, you don’t have to. This doesn’t change the metaphorical reading of this whole scene one bit.
Now look what Madame Vastra and Jenny have got in their home (in a veritable 221b Baker Street copy!):
But, hey, since Sherlock is trying so hard to determine what about John metaphorically ‘killed’ him, and since it’s clearly important to him, why don’t we listen to Sherlock’s thoughts on this some more.
1) Saly’s bust is often interpreted as one of those quintessential symbols of the Enlightenment: a symbol of introspection, of this act of looking inside yourself and becoming aware of who you really are (!). (Because who you really are does matter on this show, no matter what Mary told us in s4. They even put a sign that reads ‘WHO ARE WE’ behind Sherlock in TBB, as I pointed out
And then task number five follows: The one in which Sherlock realises that, to solve all the four tasks before, you have to first find out what happened in your childhood and ‘made you this way’.
Now is the point where the under 18-year-olds amongst you should probably stop reading, by the way. (Also, the ones who roll their eyes at crude sex jokes.)
Throughout the ‘Garrideb’ scene, we see John, Sherlock and Mycroft move up to the window in such a way that they are each positioned in front of one of the large glass panels corresponding to one of the three Garridebs:
If you need a tea-spewing moment, too, this is Winckelmann’s famous rant on the ‘Apollo Belvedere’, the very sculpture that was pretty much likened to Sherlock in the scene above. Homoerotically-charged doesn’t even begin to cover it:
May you all be blessed with more, ahem, peaches, peacocks and bananas during the holidays than poor Sherlock Holmes. (I know I will.) :P
So, whichever way, you look at this...from a name point of view or from an original-purpose-of-the-war-memorial perspective, there is no way this sculpture represents anything but John on the show.
This is a remix of a meta originally posted on my blog (sagestreet) on 29 January 2017 and a comment I wrote underneath someone else's meta on: 1 November 2017.
You do understand what I’m getting at, right? I mean, my meta writing is literally scraping the ‘bottom’ of the barrel now, sorry. You could say that I hit rock...erm, peach ‘bottom’. I would be ‘bummed’ out by it, but somehow I really don’t care.:P
Because you love the very essence of them. You love his His-ness or her Her-ness. You love the person they are deep down. And there’s no logical argument in the pro or con column that you could check to precisely define, “Ah, THAT’s what it is. THAT’s the thing that I love about them.”
For now, John is in a relationship with Mary. And all that ‘baby’ (=relationship) needs is some occasional gurgling noises, John tells us. No, “I love you”s required or anything. Good.
But this bronze in the National Museum Cardiff (where TBB was filmed) is not the original; it’s a replica.
Here, have another screenshot of Mary keeping the ‘dog’ (homosexuality) on a very, very short leash, while the ‘dog’ (homosexuality) is sniffing out the chemistry
What’s more: John could totally be looking at anatomical drawings of heart wounds and reading texts on how to save a soldier who has been shot in the shoulder/chest/heart.
, don’t you think?) So, we know that we can’t be off track when we interpret the lion in the banker’s office in the exact same way: A guardian.
So, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that we’re shown this St. Lawrence painting in an episode that is all about Sherlock having tried to kill himself on a plane because he thought he would never see John again. He was literally trying to martyr himself, his higher cause being John’s happiness, obviously. The way John screamed, “Christ, Sherlock! Christ, Sherlock!” as Sherlock shot Magnussen pretty much told us as much.
Clearly all of these other paintings were just part of the scenery, there to set the mood, but otherwise insignificant.
Since we have already had one important bust in Magnussen’s mind palace in s3, a sculpture of a dancing woman that clearly represents Sherlock (I’ve written about it
Aaaand it’s a crotch shot that we got in said scene, and, no, that’s not a British Army Browning L9A1 we see under that thin loincloth, this statue is really just pleased to see us.:)
And this aspect of John (this intellectually ‘shortsighted’ brain aspect of John) is not the one that metaphorically ‘killed’ Evans, ie, this is not who Sherlock fell in love with. Or so Sherlock tells himself here.
) that Sherlock clinging to his phone in the birth scene is a hint that Sherlock is actually literally fighting for his life, somewhere outside of his coma that s4 is all about. Sherlock is literally trying to cling to his heart (the organ!).
But it isn’t working. The true John is still there underneath. His true nature is breaking through whatever ‘civilised’ façade he is trying to erect around himself. Nature is what happens when your fingernails grow and when there are hairs growing out of your ears. Your own true nature.
There’s a woman who is basically an unattainable Goddess, insanely sexy, skimpily dressed (at best), who swoops in and sweeps Mark Antony off his feet. A woman who must have appeared to be incredibly exotic and foreign to Mark Antony, not what one would have considered a beauty in the classic sense of the word, yet so strikingly sexy that Mark Antony couldn’t help himself and fell madly in love with her.
Dean considered its words carefully. The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the qualities looked for by each of the four houses and its own role in Sorting them, but now it was trying to give them advice and convince them to band together. Dean felt no house pride, nor any loyalty to the school itself, but he thought of Sam and felt a sickening jolt as he thought of Cedric. The Hat thought they should all stick together, but it only made Castiel's disappearance more glaringly obvious. Dean glanced over at the Ravenclaw table again, at the empty seat that Sherlock had saved for Cas. He didn't have much time to dwell on it, however, as John began to tremble next to him, and Sherlock's eyes bored into them as he ground the handle of his knife into the table. Dean put an arm around John to keep him steady while he had his vision, and watched Professor McGonagall begin reading out the names on her long piece of parchment.
‘Don’t worry about him.’ Moody had followed them out. ‘It’s rare, but considering everything going on with Watson here, not surprising. People react to the Imperius Curse differently, and sometimes the effects are slow to wear off. Best help him up to the hospital wing, so he doesn’t become a menace to himself.’
Fudge looked bewildered for a moment, then he suddenly seemed to understand. 'You'll be the Watson boy who thinks he's a Seer, then?'
Sherlock sent him back an image of himself and Castiel attempting to wrangle some Leaping Toadstools.
‘I think it’s the curse,’ John said to Sherlock, as they were walking around the lake one afternoon. ‘The crystal is trying to tell me something, but the curse won’t let it.’
‘Avada Kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it – you could all get your wands out now, say the words and point them at me, and I doubt I’d get more than a nosebleed. But that doesn’t matter, I’m not here to teach you how to do it.
‘Over there,’ said Hermione, pointing. ‘There was someone behind the trees… they shouted words – an incantation.’
Cas rolled his eyes. ‘I have more than just wizard’s blood… I’m sure you’ve heard of the winged creatures that lived in mountain ranges…’
‘Yeah. Probably for the best.’ John took another sip of his tea, this time on his own. In truth, he was not at all sure whether or not they were doing the right thing, though with his current knowledge of Cornelius Fudge was enough to make him hesitate sharing with the Ministry, for now.
‘Just for the weekend for now. Dumbledore says he can take as much time as he needs, but I think he’ll probably be back in time for lessons on Monday.’
‘Ahoy there!’ Bagman called happily, plainly in a state of wild excitement, and trotted over to them. ‘Arthur, old man,’ he puffed as he reached the campfire. ‘What a day, eh? What a day! Could we have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless night coming and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements… not much for me to do at all!’
‘Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn!’ said Trelawney, irritated that he wasn’t riveted by this news. ‘I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at your birth… your dark hair… your mean stature… tragic losses so young in life… I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in mid-winter?’
improved a lot already. Without the stress of working in the dungeon, and Snape breathing down his neck, his confidence in potion making had grown and he was already practicing fourth-year potions again. He still hesitated in touching some of the more volatile ingredients and tending to the fire, but his determination to get better at it pushed him through.
Dumbledore cleared his throat again. ‘As I was saying,’ he said, ‘we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event which has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.’
‘To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation, I will be drawing the Age Line around the Goblet once it has been placed. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line.
'Prime seats!' she said, checking the Weasleys' tickets. 'Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, as high as you can go.' She directed John and Sherlock the same way, then checked Dean, Sam and Castiel's tickets. 'Right, middle seats, row thirty-six- hold on, Winchester?' she said, digging in her pockets. 'I've got a note about this – hold on – yes. This says you've been requested in the Top Box, by the Minister – wow! Aren't you three lucky! Go on, same way as them, then.'
Sherlock shook his head. Even he wasn’t feeling particularly up to answering any question, but he opened his mouth anyway. ‘You-Know-Who,’ he breathed. ‘He’s back.’
'Sirius's head?' said Hermione. 'You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he wouldn't do that now, it would be too-
Too bad we can’t properly see it. Because in a fandom as clever as this, there are bound to be some people who really speak the infamous Victorian language of flowers and could probably go through each and every single one of them to tell us what they all mean.
And don’t forget: Of all the statues they could have chosen, they chose Venus, the Goddess of Love, to represent the subtext here.
Wow, all three of them look just thrilled by this development, don’t they? John and Mary are going to have a ‘baby’ (=relationship). *sad trombone noises*
They’re talking about the ‘baby’, but what Sherlock means is the potential, future love that John is going to have in his life. Sherlock wants that love to have the name Sherlock.
In other words, this aspect represents Sherlock the way we met him in ASiP (ostensibly devoid of any emotion, scared of showing his feelings, pretending to be an automaton). And we see that confirmed in the dialogue: This man in the screenshot above argues that one shouldn’t irritate the ‘terrorists’, that these ‘terrorists’ are dangerous. All the terrorists have been metaphors for feelings for quite a while now, haven’t they?
Is this flipped ‘Garrideb’ scenario about Sherlock almost dying and John finally showing his cards (=his love) while he sits by Sherlock’s hospital bed after TRF?
Look, even the scene in which John checks out Sherlock’s naked body underneath the sheet (“Are you wearing any pants?”), where he literally looks straight down into Sherlock’s lap (!), takes place right underneath the (left) tapestry depicting a half-naked Cleopatra sitting in Mark Antony’s lap in an erotic ‘lap-dancy’ kind of way. And remember that the scene in the tapestry is SO brazenly sexual that the Victorians had to hide one of those erotic details. THAT is the tapestry underneath which this scene here is happening:
Well, in the 19th century, in the Victorian era, people thought that this Egyptian equivalent of a lap dance was too offensive to their prudish sensibilities. So, they dyed that part of the tapestry red to make her leg disappear.
It depicts a breezy, cloudy and not entirely clear day on the English coast, with St. Michael’s Mount (Cornwall) in the background, and adds beautifully to the mood of this scene in TAB.
Because their relationship is gone. John can’t deal with it. John tells us directly in the text (at the beginning of TLD) that he can’t cope. John can’t deal with his relationship with Sherlock. That’s why the ‘baby’ isn’t there.
Consequently, the sculpture was nicely lit throughout the scene, ie, bathed in very bright white light, as if to make sure we would notice it.
Because right now Sherlock is trapped between his work (labour) and the puzzle that is his past (the question why his head became so detached from his body.)
Remember who the ‘devil’ is on BBC ‘Sherlock’? According to TAB (and according to all the apple-carving in TRF), the ‘devil’ is Moriarty himself.
The five tasks Eurus (Sherlock’s inner personality) gives Sherlock to solve reflect the five series.
And THAT, Sherlock wants us to know here, is what he fell in love with about John. THAT’s what metaphorically ‘killed’ Sherlock.
Alex Garrideb, the man who has had ‘laser surgery’ and the new clothes and the fake tan, but whose wilder, deeper, more natural side (the nails and the hairs in his ears) keeps breaking through this façade, that is the man who metaphorically ‘killed’ Sherlock. It’s the conflicted bisexual man, the very core of John’s John-ness, the man who is shown to be connected to his
It’s a painting of exotic and rather rare birds; Mycroft enjoys himself a good glass of brandy and owns fine clothes. Ergo, the man has exquisite and rather expensive, even aristocratic tastes. So this type of art is what he usually surrounds himself with. That’s it. That’s what the painting is trying to tell us. Nothing more or less.
Because the whole story was not one between Faust and the devil, it was actually a plot between the devil and God (Mycroft). So, yes, in a sense, you can read ‘Faust’ as M-Theory. If you want.
) in Part 2 of my ‘Follow the dog’ meta series, were both mirrors for John...or rather for the two sides of his sexuality.
And look how unhappy that ‘baby’ (=relationship) makes both John and Mary here in their marital bed:
Because then the relationship would have been fake all along. If John and Mary’s ‘baby’ is, in fact, David and Mary’s ‘baby’, that would mean that John and Mary’s relationship was never real. If David were the father of Mary’s ‘baby’, that would mean that Mary was in a relationship with David all along.
Well, I could word-vomit another million-word-meta about this, but I don’t think this is what @shiplocks-of-love originally wanted to read, when they asked about the scene.:) So, I’m going to try to keep this as brief as possible. I see three different explanations for this ‘flip’. You can decide which one you like. (Or maybe they’re all true...??? IDK.)
Yeah. That ‘baby’ (=relationship) is sure shitting a lot.:D You could say that this ‘baby’ (=relationship) has ‘shat up’ John’s life even before it has really, properly come out. Look how much shit comes out of that ‘baby’ (=relationship). That ‘baby’ (=relationship) is sure shitty, man.
Both can be seen in the same Mycroft-on-the-treadmill scene as the giant peacock painting we discussed last time (see here:
Lawrence was martyred, ie, he died for a higher cause – his Christian beliefs, as personified by the little angel above him in the painting...
Now that we have established how very shitty (and vomitty) John and Mary’s relationship is, let’s talk about John and Sherlock’s relationship. You’ll see that this one is far more pleasant, if not without its own complications.
Heterosexual relationships have the blessing of organised religion (well, not all heterosexual relationships, obviously, but for the purposes of the show, that’s the statement Mofftiss are making). Homosexual relationships don’t get that blessing at all. Ever.
Add to that the fact that this painting is by far the best known and most popular of all the paintings at Tyntesfield and you can at least suspect that they knew about it and that showing it in that very scene was a deliberate choice.
But this is more than just a sign that John doesn’t feel too great about his heterosexual relationships. There is more to this metaphor. His hand is not ‘steady’. Think about the pun here: steady girlfriend...steady partner. John’s hand is not steady when he is bored with *cough* ‘civilian life’. John’s hand is perfectly steady when it comes to being with Sherlock. And Mycroft tells us in ASiP that he can see from John’s hand (incidentally the left hand where John would wear a wedding ring) that John is not going to stay away from Sherlock Holmes.
You love all and everything about this other person. All of it. And all of it is going to end up in your emotional ‘ocean’. (If water is really the metaphor for feelings, just imagine for a moment what an entire ocean (!) means about how great Sherlock’s love for John is!)
No way you would get a real tan from being exposed to the moon. Haha! There are no traces of a real tan (real love) on John because of Mary. He doesn’t love her.
And we know the set designers know their art history, don’t we? They put a very famous bust in Ella’s office right at the start of the show in ASiP (as I pointed out
This scene tells us that, no matter how fucked-up a heterosexual relationship is (even if it shits all over your life) and makes both participants miserable as hell, it’s still more likely that that one will get the blessing of organised religion than a homosexual one. No questions asked.
So, once Mofftiss established the changing meaning of the ‘baby’ metaphor by introducing us to the naming controversy in HLV, things got really, really good very quickly. They escalated in a pleasant and hilarious way, one could say.
. A head without its body! It even has a little pig-tail thingy at the very back of its head. And since the whole statue is the sculpture of a dancer, this means that we’re currently getting only the head of the dancer, without the dancing body. A cut-off head.
has just pointed this out in their brilliant analysis of the wedding as a possible starting point for EMP (
However...in the past, it was often printed (or emblazoned) on the covers and flyleaves of books, booklets and pamphlets released by the War Office...and in the exact same spot as on the cover of John’s book, at that: Right in the middle.
The fact that the weather in the picture is not entirely clear and that Sherlock himself has to carry a torch (flashlight) right in front of it, is a nice touch: He can’t see clearly yet and has to shed light on the whole affair unfurling in front of his eyes.
But before the show started, John was actually exposed to a ‘sun’ of his own while he was in the military, right? In that scenario, John was the ‘planet’ and somebody else (James Sholto) was the ‘sun’. And John felt the warmth of that ‘sun’ on his very skin. John’s skin was kissed by that ‘sun’. In other words, John was in love. Deeply in love.
Okay, that was a very productive coffee break, in which I didn’t get any coffee at all.:) But at least I got to scream at you about all this. And my boss is definitely gonna kill me now.
(But I like this idea more than John reading the Bible. It could admittedly still be a Dickens or Oscar Wilde book, as some people have suggested.)
And if you don’t believe me that the “Monstera” plant in that shot is supposed to represent John’s homosexual side, here’s one other little hint. This is the fruit of the “Monstera”:
How else can we tell anything about our Saint (Sherlock) if we don’t at least take a cursory glance at the murder weapons that are used in his brain (which is where this episode takes place, after all).
Also, need I remind you that the scene with Mycroft on the treadmill and the three paintings in his exercise room happens AFTER the stag night?
Sherlock (in his coma) is probably experiencing intense, severe chest pain and people are possibly trying to save his heart at that moment, and that pain and panic he physically feels in his body causes a dream about...John entering into a relationship with Mary.
Oh, look, Alex is on the phone (phone=heart) in the above photograph. Seems that Sherlock fell in love with a man who’s connected to his
So, it is THIS aspect of John (Alex Garrideb)...the conflicted bisexual man that Sherlock fell for. (Or so Sherlock is telling himself here.)
After all, it was Sherlock who was obsessing over his own metaphorical ‘murder’ in TSoT. It’s Sherlock who, throughout the show, has had difficulty understanding this type of thing (love) and has been growing more and more as a character when it comes to feelings and emotions.
In short, Sherlock Holmes, the 120-year-old character, has become a dead body stuffed with all sorts of attributes that make it impossible for us to see him as an interesting, living human being. He has literally been done to death.
Or do you think a TV show would never, ever, ever do that, use the picture of a peacock as a metaphor for male genitalia?
The two voices in Sherlock’s head are interesting, too: It’s easy to recognise that the ambassador’s male colleague [husband, probably] is an aspect of Sherlock since he’s wearing Sherlock’s shock blanket from ASiP and a shirt without a tie in the way Sherlock is wont to do.
Needless to say that in ACD’s original canon story, Alex was not the murderer. The murderer was actually called John (!) Garrideb (which wasn’t his real name, he was the killer). Haha! So, Mofftiss thought they could be sly by changing the name ‘John’ to ‘Alex’ so that we wouldn’t catch on quite so quickly. Sweet. They didn’t want to make the puzzle too easy by naming the ‘murderer’ John. But whatever...
So, once again, series 4 (‘The Six Thatchers’ to be precise) invokes a gay god, as part of this story. In TST, it also uses his bust as a Sherlock mirror. What might we deduce from that? Hm...Yep, Sherlock is gay, my friends. Tell me something new.:)
I apologise again for bringing up ideas that weren’t exactly brand-new. I suspect a lot of this has been discussed in the fandom over the last six years of my near-total johnlock abstinence. Let’s hope it doesn’t take me six years again to write another johnlock fic. But then, you never know.
There is a light blotch on the cover that instantly reminded me of something. That’s because it has the exact same shape as the
Which makes sense since the subtext is definitely sexual now too: Andy is interested in Soo-Lin, and since the two of them are mirrors for John and Sherlock, you can guess what a half-naked beautiful Venus statue, enticingly showing us her shapely behind is supposed to mean.
The Sherlock Holmes character that has been adapted on screen (and on stage) more than 200 times across the world is a zombie, a dead body, a comatose entity BECAUSE HE IS DEVOID OF HIS GAY IDENTITY as represented by his love for John Watson!
Well, if this ASiP scene foreshadows Sherlock in an EMP at some point in the show, then the meta reading of this ASiP scene has to extend to EMP, as well.
And you know how bad a place Sherlock must have been in when Sherlock replies that he had completely forgotten about the ‘baby’. Oh, Sherlock! That pain must have been really bad. (Good thing they hug that out.)
So, whichever way you look at it: The bust means something for either John or Sherlock and it adds to the profound weirdness of the Ella scenes throughout the series that
The blocking here tells us exactly what Sherlock is looking at: He has split John into three precise aspects.
Whenever Sherlock and John talk about the ‘baby’, they talk about their (=John and Sherlock’s) relationship. Whenever Mary and John talk about the baby, it’s their relationship they talk about.
Keep in mind that ‘flats’ and ‘houses’ are often used as a metaphor for a person’s emotional self, for their emotional state of mind, their heart, basically.
So, now that we have established that this scene neatly foreshadows Sherlock’s EMP, let’s go one step further.
This confirms that John’s issue is only to a lesser degree self-denial. John knows what it is that he wants. He’s not that repressed anymore. John’s problem is what happens when other people find out. (Totally understandable.)
And I had added how that modesty isn’t really helping him one bit, seeing as his urges defeat his hands anyway. Just look at the way the hilt of that sword is, ahem, tilted upwards.:P
Just so we understand each other, I’m not saying that the artist Edward Ladell meant to imply that he was painting a human derrière in his 19th century still life. Oh, no, I’m actually pretty sure his paintings were all genuinely harmless and innocent, devoid of any sexual connotations...without any ifs and butts, so to speak.:)
(Obviously, Sherlock only expects this subconsciously. Consciously, he will only work out that he has fallen in love at John’s wedding when it’s literally ‘too late’=delayed action stabbing.)
In art history, depictions of people having one eye shot through are clever references to the concept of perspective. So, should the show ‘Sherlock’ actually go where a lot of people
