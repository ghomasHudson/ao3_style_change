“Wow, you’re drunk,” Dean pushes him off. “Who wants to take me there?” he asks the table. Cas is smiling like a doofus and sweat has made his hair curl against his forehead. He is beautiful, “I can take you there,” and then the fucker winks.
They jump apart when the elevator stops, expecting to be caught. Turns out they’ve reached Cas’ floor and Cas pulls Dean after him, never letting go of his hand, not even to unlock the door.
A waitress brings them water while she refills Castiel’s and his date’s glasses, and Dean throws himself at it, wishing it was vodka.
They got to Dean’s house and got set up in Dean’s room, and were just about ready to begin, but Dean could not deny it. He could smell himself.
Right now though, he’s not telling it to let Cas know. He’s pretty sure Cas is well aware that Dean is into him. He’s just sharing funny memories from when they still had time to make fun memories (that is, before grad school).
“I suppose I can call off the tutor now,” she smiled over her glass of milk, like Dean would be happy about it.
Dean doesn’t even register the smile that lights up his face as he gets up. Some of the guys greet Cas distractedly, focused on the game on the screen.
Castiel smiles wistfully, “I suppose I can’t help being a little upset. I view intimacy a lot differently than what my peers tend to.” Dean doesn’t get to ask what that means.  “I do appreciate you telling me. And that you didn’t have sex with him. I guess that means you’re Team Rachel.” Castiel’s smile turns a little more genuine.
Cas is wearing a button-down and the buttons suck, so it never comes off. It’s left half-way undone by the time the lube comes out. Dean doesn’t care. He’s still wearing his socks and his boxers around one angle when they finish.
He tilts the cooked bacon off the hot pan and into a paper-plated plate, and pours juice into two glasses. He stacks the finished pancakes and pours coffee.
At least to this, Cas complies. He strokes Dean’s dick a few times, then grips the base and squeezes. At least it makes Dean come down a little.
By the end of it Dean is fairly certain that all three relatives will relay a good picture of him to Cas’ parents. Most importantly, his mother. Who apparently is hard to impress.
The cherub watched the hunter from above as he exited his monstrosity of a car. It was quite iconic, even amongst the angels at this point, and it made it easier to spot the hunter despite the angel-proofing sigils etched into his ribs by one Castiel. Speaking of which, the cherub had yet to locate.
Mom flipped a long, blonde lock of hair over her shoulder and popped her hands up on her hips, “Not on Mondays. Which is when you’ll go. And Sunday mornings.”
Dean starts getting set up, only to realize that he’s missing two sheets from a compendium he just spent a fortune printing. He knows for sure he had the whole thing at the library. He runs his fingers through the part of the compendium he has with him, hoping to find the missing pages only misplaced, but no. The pages are safely stapled together. Dean groans and starts pulling things out of his bag. Why would he have left two sheets at the library? Surely he would have noticed them lying on the table when they left? But they’re not between his books or stuck in his closed laptop, they’re not folded up in his pocket either, and Dean’s running out of places to look.
Castiel sweats and looks behind him for his friends. He cannot see them and he realizes with dread that they are watching the interaction from the coffee shop across the street.
talk about feelings after about an hour and a half, Benny doesn’t even judge him or say it’s because he’s ‘half gay’. He just tells him to stop worrying so much; he’ll always have him and Charlie.
Tension leaves Dean’s body as he kisses Cas back, pulling him closer by his hips. But it doesn’t have the desired effect when Cas just pulls back, inhaling to speak. Dean takes the opportunity to nuzzle under his chin, pressing kisses to his jawline and Castiel actually
“That is correct,” Cas is smiling at his menu and Dean still kind of loves seeing him in bird’s eye. What? It’s biology or something.
Dean shrugs like it’s not a big deal, then swallows. “Especially since you told me they all hate me.”
“Yes,” Dean whines. He eyes the bottle he haphazardly tossed on the bed next to the vibrator. “How long do you think we could survive off waffle flavored lube?”
People grow kind of quiet, looking back down at whatever they were doing before Dean entered. Benny walks up to Dean and puts his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“Don’t you got other shit to do than ogle me?” Cas asks. He throws the used towel on the floor in the bathroom and walks across the floor to the dresser.
Dean smiles at his antics, “Well, nice to meet ya, Cas.” He finally makes his exit, but not before noting the smile Cas’ notebook gets.
“Can’t believe the season’s ending already,” Dean says. “All I did was sail you around and suck your dick,” he grins playfully.
He still hasn’t come out after Castiel is done putting on his shoes, so he sticks his head into the bathroom. Dean is still observing that shower.
Dean’s mouth is warm and wet around him, and thankfully there are no grazing teeth now. The younger man bops his head up and down, dick nudging against the back of his throat. It has Dean gagging a bit and Cas is about to ask if he’s alright but Dean seems into it, as he just swallows down deeper, breathing through his nose and throat working around Cas.
They’re all wearing matching uniforms, only in different colors. It’s a cropped little sports bra-type top and the world’s shortest skirt, Glitora’s all decked in green sequins. She has attached a jewel (plastic) with hot glue to her bodysuit as a makeshift belly button piercing.
Castiel’s face was soon covered with an endearingly bright blush and he studied the tabletop as he said: “Uhm, it’s just a muffin, so…”
Dean makes a face at the cracking sound. “D’ya sleep alright?” He says looking like he knows the answer to that.
“You don’t enjoy it?” he feels compelled to ask. Between a deadbeat, pocket money-stealing dad and a hungry little brother Dean has had an array of shitty jobs growing up, ranging from babysitting, busing tables and retail. And some shadier stuff, but he tries not to think about that. He knows coworkers can really make a shitty job endurable. Even Meg is nice to have when Crowley really gets going.
Castiel looked up from his own notes then, surprised at Dean bringing it back up. He knew the academy’s reputation. If you didn’t have drive, you didn’t stay there. “… I don’t doubt that.”
“Where?” Dean spats, “We can’t go to the reading rooms because they’re all booked and Sam has filled our apartment with exchange students for fucking International Night. Where the fuck do you suggest we go?”
Sam was still asleep that morning. Dean could hear him snoring all the way from his room. He didn’t really have anything to get to, which made him too antsy to go back to sleep. Instead he made his way downstairs.
“I was gonna ask if you’d seen him naked yet but that question sorta answers itself,” Benny chuckles and Charlie laughs out loud. Dean feels bad for all the other students in the reading room – including himself.
It’s obviously not a very populous area, but somehow people are kind of milling about. It’s not early but it’s still morning, and Castiel takes in people sailing, some are sitting on their terraces smoking cigarettes and drinking moonshine, a mirror image of last night. There are kids playing, splashing water and running around.
“Hey Cas!” Charlie said overly optimistic, making it very obvious that they’d been talking about him, if Castiel had been a regular social being, anyway.
Dean waves him off, “It’s just mechanical engineering. That’s like the easiest kind.” He winks at Meg with his next comment though, “I’m good with my hands.”
“No, Dean. I don’t want to discuss this with you. You’re not getting in that water. You can’t see what’s in it and you know it’s full of alligators and leeches and all sorts of predators.” His voice leaves no room for argument.
“We’re not. That’s Gabe’s secret stash.” Castiel reaches for his jacket next and shrugs it on. The movement makes Dean look down at what he’s wearing, and he groans.
The guys mumble some agreement and they all take a break to drink a beer. Dean pretty much chugs his.
Dean is in the library really hating his major when his phone vibrates with a text. Cas must be out of his economics class.
he’s into me. And still?” he gestures to nothing, “He’s giving me nothing. It’s one step forward and three fucking steps back with him.”
“Is it okay if I shower first? It won’t be five minutes, I just feel all sticky and gross,” he asked Castiel, pleading as if Castiel probably could not smell him as well. He figured his mom was paying for every minute Castiel spent there anyway.
Benny stares at her then announces, “Sounds like a plan, brother. I gotta go buy smokes anyway. Anyone need provisions?”
Dean turned to him with a smirk, “You are a nerd, nerd. Tell Mom I’m not staying?” he asked and made for the bathroom.
And that is pretty much how it goes for three more games. Benny disqualifies them halfway through the last game when they cannot stop laughing long enough to throw the ball.
look, and Dean finally gets on with it and sits down next to Asshole Psych Major’s hot date, and tries not to think about how now he can really compare Dean and his much hotter and probably much more well-read date.
Over the course of January they get into the habit of meeting at the library in the early afternoon and going for coffee and some type of dinner in the early evening. Cas still hasn’t been to Dean’s place for dinner and part of the reason is that Sam lives there and Dean just isn’t ready for that.
They’re getting off stage and Dean thinks he sees Cas among the audience out of the corner of his eye, but… that can’t be right? The fucker was supposed to be with Sam. If Sam had ditched him for Jo, Dean was going to kick his ass.
Dean brings them six shots of tequila and two rum and cokes, because that’s Cas’ drink of choice and Sam doesn’t have one. And then he’s off the clock.
Dean hesitates but decides to ask, “I don’t know if this is offensive but I don’t mean it to be. How does porn and being asexual work together?”
She leans back in her seat with a knowing smile, not grasping that Dean is already reeling. “You know your boyfriend is in the LGBT club with me, right?”
“Do you want to work on the project today?” Hanna asked Castiel, shielding her eyes from the autumn sun and squinting up at him.
In between the game and Castiel and Dean’s unspoken drinking competition they’re soon too drunk to keep up with the rules anyway, and the conversation starts flowing on it’s own.
“And what did they say to that?” Dean knows how some people feel about frat bros. Cas used to feel that way. He actually still kind of does, having had his prejudices confirmed.
Sam stays silent. He knows Dean hates this, hates that Sam has a tendency to turn it into a heart-to-heart.
“No,” Castiel says again. He fingers his glass, slushing the water around at the bottom. He looks up to see Dean observing his hands.
Castiel glared at the guy from where he was kneeling next to his pencil case. Which had been open as well and had made its way out of Castiel’s bag, spilling pencils and highlighters everywhere. The guy was about Castiel’s age and unfairly handsome. He was eating Red Vines and that just aggravated Castiel more.
Castiel stared fixedly at his keyboard and Dean quickly pulled on a pair of underwear, followed by a pair of jeans. His pulled a t-shirt over his head and rolled his eyes while Castiel could not see him. “I’m dressed now. You can look,” he said teasingly.
Dean rolls his eyes, and starts on the padding. He’s fucking screwed and it’s going to be embarrassing as all hell, but luckily his boyfriend is used to seeing him in women’s clothes, and his best friend will be right next to him on that stage.
Before he can think Dean says: “Well, I am.” And when Cas smirks, he blushes beet red despite the alcohol. Instead of making matters worse, he grabs a ping pong ball from the cup of water and gives it to Cas.
He didn’t feel great for the rest of the day. Not while studying with Hanna and not while ignoring Dean’s texts all night. And not the next day either when Dean told him he had gotten an A in biology and he couldn’t reply because Hanna wanted to compare answers before chemistry.
He hears Cas inhale sharply, and then Cas is taking his wrist out of Dean’s reach, but only to lace his fingers through Dean’s.
“You certainly have the observing thing down to an art,” Dean says. Castiel frowns and turns like he’s been slapped. He doesn’t respond, instead turning his back to Dean and starting to take in the bayou. He takes out his iPad to take notes, and hears Dean huff behind him. Luckily he doesn’t say anything.
Dean lays down next to his boyfriend and wiggles around, trying to get comfortable on the hard ground. “Think we should get a hammock?”
homophobic. He loves the gays! He has absolutely no problem with two dudes (or two chicks, heh) boning. Live and let live, you know?
Dean sighs. “I dunno, man. I just don’t think America is ready for an openly queer baseball player.”
Cas treats Dean to a beaming smile; the kind that lights up his whole face. “That’s more than OK with me.” He leans forward and kisses Dean briefly. “I didn’t want to pressure you—I know this is new, dating a man and everything. But rest assured, I want to be your boyfriend.”
His own cock is hanging hard and heavy between his legs and Dean shifts his weight so that he can take himself in hand.
Dean looks up when they enter the kitchen, clearly relieved. “Oh, good. I don’t know why I brought Caleb in here, but I can’t do anything while I’m holding him.” He passes the kid over to Benny.
Surprising absolutely no one, Dean gets selected for the American League All Star Team in mid- July, having been voted in by the highest number of votes for any single player in the history of the All Star Game. He’ll be joined by Mike and Sam, and, as is tradition, Bobby gets the nod to manage as his team had made it to the World Series the previous season. The event is being held at Dodger Stadium, and Dean’s incredibly relieved not to be traveling.
Just then, the door to the press room bangs open and a little girl runs full-force at the raised platform where Dean is fielding questions.
“Dean?! Dean?! Can you hear me? Don’t try to move your head or your neck. Stay still!” Cas sounds frantic.
, he’s been jerking off so much he’s a little afraid his dick is gonna fall off. He feels like he did when he was 14 and discovered lube.
Dean sighs and scratches at his eyebrow with his thumbnail. “Yeah, Cas is at lunch with Gabe. Look, man. I’m getting there, OK? I really am. I’m channeling Elsa and trying to let it the fuck go. But I’m still not ready to go back to the Dean and Sam Goodtimes Jamboree.”
Cas nods. He opens and bends his legs, lifting them so that his ass is bared to Dean. “I’m ready,” he confirms.
Ash smiles. “I took the Airstream out to Joshua Tree on Wednesday morning, amigos. Just me and the great expanse of the Milky Way over my head. Drove straight from there to the park this morning.”
to be happy. Besides, once I retire, I can think about finding some chick to pop out a few tiny Winchesters and having that whole ‘fence and dog’ shebang. It’s too complicated now.”
Dean sighs heavily and fights the instinct to lie and reassure him that he’s fine. He wants to be honest with Cas, who’s never been anything but honest with him. “Physically, yeah, I’m fine. Nothing hurts, doc.” He shrugs one shoulder and looks at the ground. “But, uh, I was having some trouble concentrating. Made a few dumb mistakes, and Bobby kicked me off the field.” He’s spilling so many damn feelings that, at this rate, his period is going to line up with Sam’s.
, so Dean’s hoping that he’ll mix in a slider that he can get a hold of. He’d fouled away three fastballs in his last at-bat before striking out on a slider, so he thinks there’s a good chance the catcher, Smith, will call for a few in this plate visit.
“Fuck!” Cas grunts out and tries to still Dean’s movement, but he’s too late. A throb of discomfort pulses where he and Cas are joined together and he looks up to see that Cas’ eyes are squeezed shut.
try to downplay your symptoms. You will acquiesce to this not only because the medical professional tasked with your wellbeing is telling you that this is the appropriate protocol following a potential head injury, but also because I am currently unable to keep up the façade of professionalism between my job and seeing my boyfriend in pain and I
Managers tend to bring their favorite staff from their last job, and Bobby is no exception. In addition to the pitching coach, Rufus Turner, he’s brought over his bench and hitting coaches, as well as his much-lauded team doctor. Dean has been hearing about this guy for the past two years from both Sam and Bobby—they told Dean he was a "natural healer" and had a "way with the players"—but he was holding out judgement. Sam was as trusting as a baby lamb and, in his opinion, the kid could use a dose of skepticism.
he thinks. Dean narrows his eyes and readies his bat. When Kershaw releases the ball, he inhales and swings. The moment he finishes his swing, he drops the bat and starts sprinting towards first base, unsure if the wind that’s blowing in will be enough to keep it in the park, or not; there have been plenty of fly balls in earlier innings that, on another night, would’ve been homers. Dean looks up when he hears the crowd roar, and he sees the fans in the left field bleachers reach up en masse to try and catch the ball that’s sailing directly into their seats.
“I can totally picture you sitting with like, a pipe and a leather-bound book in front of a fire and a giant cat in your lap.”
“Michael and I communicate about baseball on occasion. He’s the GM for the Yankees and he’s been trying to recruit me to his staff for years. I sort of worshipped him when I was younger, but the luster faded quickly when I realized he just blindly followed our father’s wishes.” Cas stops and considers. “Uriel and Zachariah have always been assholes, and I haven’t spoken to them in ages. I correspond somewhat regularly with my sisters, Rachel and Hester, but we haven’t gotten together in a long time. We’ve always gotten along better from afar.”
“OK, Sam, your turn.” She holds her arms out and waits for Sam, who has to stoop slightly to embrace her much shorter frame.
She points behind herself towards the door, and Dean looks up to see a distraught Cas holding a miserable-looking toddler in his arms. His white button-down is covered in a big, blue stain. “Jack-Jack frowed up on Daddy!” Claire says excitedly.
@DeanWinchesterSTANS (6/11/20 10:02 am): obvi fuck you @crowleymedia for invading @TheRealDWinny ‘s privacy. But also I’m tweeting this from beyond the grave because I am DEAD from how cute these two are! I need you all to weigh in: #Winchley or #Destiel for their couple name?
They don’t have penetrative sex all that often—their busy schedules and the amount of prep it takes tend to prohibit that particular activity—and that’s really the only thing they use condoms for anymore, having long-since established that they both have clean bills of health.
Dean grabs his keys and throws open the garage door, ready to jump into his car and go find Cas, when he barely stops himself from running bodily into the man himself.
“Wow. Screw you, man.” He turns to leave, feeling incredibly embarrassed and ashamed. To put himself out there like that, in such a dramatic way, and then get shut down so thoroughly? Only serves to confirm his deep-seated fears.
Dean steps closer to him and lowers his voice, speaking into his ear. “Well, by ‘Wheaties,’ I mean ‘Cas’ tight ass,’ of course.”
“Is there any truth to the rumor that Chuck Shurley offered you a million dollars to break up with his son?”
“That depends. Will you go on a date with me Wednesday? Come over to my place, and I’ll force-feed you some healthy food?”
Dean realizes that Cas is letting him take the lead when he doesn’t move to deepen the kiss or change their position, so he takes advantage of it to quickly manhandle Cas onto his back on the bed.
Dean has a sudden flash of his previous night’s activity that involved Cas letting him fuck his face in the shower. He’s tempted to respond, “Well, Peter, I’d say the shocking amount of sex I’ve been having with my boyfriend has really helped burn excess energy and honed my focus.”
“I, uh, just wanted to say a few words about Sammy before we get to the cake. First, thanks to all of you for making it over here, especially Ellen, who flew in from Lawrence just to make sure Sammy got enough attention for the whole, ‘making it into the annals of baseball history’ thing.
It would be hours of talking about everything and nothing. Teaching him about the complex beauty of the internal workings of a 1967 Chevy Impala. Listening to him rant about the evils of capitalist societies and the dangers of the growing wealth inequality in the world. Letting Cas feed him kale and tofu because he knows it’ll make him smile. Coffee in bed and long weekends in the mountains during the off-season. Looking towards the dugout after hitting a homerun to see Cas beaming at him.
Cas is watching the at-bat so intently that he misses the exchange. After the next pitch is fouled away, he suddenly sits up and says, “Dean, Sam, we need to move down the bench.”
Dean lets out a surprised giggle, which he tries to turn into a cough to avoid attention. He glances around, but no one is paying him any attention.
“If you’re sure…” Cas sighs and leans down, pressing a soft kiss to the spot that his elbow smacked into. He then moves down Dean’s legs, grabbing the discarded supplies and settling himself near Dean’s knees.
to him, not just ogling his nice, tight ass. He looks forward to the afternoons when he gets to spend time in his presence, and tries to impress him by describing the charity work he does and the foundations he supports with his (frankly outrageous) salary.
“Million dollar arm, five-cent head,” Dean says, mussing Sam’s hair before pushing him playfully away.
“You’ll have to ask Sam about his mindset. I have no comment about my personal life,” he grits out from behind clenched teeth.
Sam looks as delighted as a kid on Christmas morning, but Dean’s eyes widen and despite his panic he manages to keep his voice to barely above a whisper. “Shh! Keep your friggin’ voice down!” He looks around wildly to ensure that they have some privacy. “That was
He raises his eyes to meet Cas’, and is treated to a full-on soul-penetrating gaze. Dean clears his throat. “Yeah?”
Sam leans back and turns his head, hiding behind Gabriel’s back, and mouths, “Jerk.” Dean just winks and mouths “Bitch,” back at him.
I have no idea how Ken Griffey, jr. feels about the LGBTQ+ community, but I have to hold on to giving him the benefit of the doubt because I love him and the heart wants what the heart wants.
“Your level of cheeriness this morning is both unnatural and unnerving,” Cas yawns, reaching for his toothbrush. “I already packed my bag before coming here last night. It’s downstairs by the door, so I just need to get dressed and make it to the stadium to get on the bus.”
Game three is a battle. Both starting pitchers have been nearly unhittable, and the score is tied one-one in the bottom of the sixth inning. Dean is trying his best to help Garcia work his way out of a jam—he’d walked Rocker to lead off the inning and given up a double to Judge before striking out the next two batters—but now Rocker is the go-ahead run on third base and the count is full, three balls and two strikes. Dean steadies himself and calls for a high curve, banking on Voit chasing it for a swinging strike three.
Dean blushes and shifts on his bed, struggling to contain his discomfort with the depth of Cas’ words. “OK, OK, I get it, Dr Ruth. We love the shit out of each other. So does that mean you’ll put it in my butt?”
“I thought we agreed this little chat would be about Jenkins here and his nasty slider, not about me and any hypothetical future job postings.” Dean raises his eyebrows at the assembled reporters and pats the shoulder of the young pitcher sitting next to him. The Angels had signed him from the Dodgers a few weeks ago, and he’d had his first team workout that afternoon. “Y’all have the next, like, nine months to speculate on who’ll take Bobby’s place. My money’s on Taylor Swift bringing her talents to Anaheim. Now, can we please get back to a relevant discussion?”
Cas decided to go for a run, having not just played over four hours of baseball, so Dean has the room to himself for a while. He strips down to his boxers and crawls into bed, stretching out on the king-sized mattress and grabbing the remote for the TV. His daily routine usually includes watching a bit of
In an effort to further appease Dean and get back in his good graces, Sam had agreed to let him choose the song that would be played as he went up to bat.
“Yep!” She responds brightly. “The queers can assemble faster than The Avengers when they find something they want to publicly support.”
@chasten (6/11/2 10:26 am): While this probably wasn’t the coming out story you’d hoped for, you might just make Angels fans out of me and Pete, @TheRealDWinny ! Happy to have you on our “team”!
“I’m not saying that it was a good thing that this happened, Dean. I just mean that her motivations were not
“I wish my dad’s opinion didn’t matter so much to me, you know? I wish I could just live my damn life and not give a shit whether or not John Winchester approves.”
Cas turns his head and smiles at Dean. “Thank you, but you know, it’s little more than employing my observational skills and vast amount of baseball knowledge to make educated guesses about the outcomes of at-bats and pitches.”
He chuckles, presses one more swift kiss to Cas’s lips, and then Dean is out in the hallway, straightening his clothes as he makes his way back to the clubhouse.
Couple that with the animated, easy conversation Cas is having with one of Dean’s childhood idols, and he’s rendered momentarily speechless.
“Nice to finally meet you in person, Cas,” she smiles, holding out her hand. “Mom’s the hugger. The rest of us appreciate social norms when meeting people for the first time.”
Dean rests his forehead against Cas’ shoulder and tightens his arms where they’re slung around Cas’ waist. “No, I know this is me putting unreasonable expectations on my own damn self.”
? It’d only been five friggin’ days since his entire life felt like it was lit on fire; barely a week had passed since Sam pitched his no-hitter.
Dean leans back against the wall of the press room and smirks. He might be a grown-ass man, but he’ll never outgrow the joy it gives him to watch his baby brother be awkward.
Cas has already been by a few times and he knows his way around the house, so Dean lets him put the pie and salad in the refrigerator and help to set the table. It feels domestic in a way that both freaks him out and excites him.
“What do you want, you inconvenient moose?!” He demands, wrenching open the door just enough to shoot Sam an annoyed frown.
Dean does allow input from Jo, however. They FaceTime her a few weeks later and fill her in on what they’ve been working on.
“I just can’t imagine that someone Sam would choose to date would do something like that. Perhaps Ruby convinced herself she was doing us a favor? At least her quotes described our relationship as loving.”
“No need to undress, Dean,” Castiel replies, a small smile on his face. “But yes, why don’t you come into my office and we can talk about your body.”
“We’ll have you over any time you want! We’ve got a day off on Wednesday—why don’t you two come over for dinner? Kathleen would love to meet you, Cas.”
He doesn’t respond to Sam’s last statement. “At least tell me that she doesn’t have a key to your place, and that she’s not holding any of your shit hostage?”
Sam’s holding both of his hands up in surrender and looking at Dean with wide, alarmed eyes. “Are you ok, man? You look sorta… insane.”
“Our Mom died when I was about 10 months old,” Sam says finally, licking some errant cream off of his knuckle.
Cas leans his forehead against Dean’s and closes his eyes. “I knew I loved you on Opening Day, when you winked at me while you were taking batting practice. You looked up after you hit a ball into the left field bleachers, like you were checking to see if I was watching, which, of course I was—I always am—and then you
This combination of nearly unbearable intimacy coupled with the words Cas is saying drives Dean wild. He had absolutely no idea that anal sex would be like this; the sensation of being filled and fucked into the mattress is so incredibly satisfying.
“Hey. man. Tough workout with the doctor?” Sam waggles his eyebrows as he pokes at something in a pan. “Want some of this sautéed kale?”
Ellen grimaces. “You sure about this one, Cas? You might want to hold out for someone who remembers their damn manners.”
“So, how was the game today? I didn’t see you get sent off in shame, so, I assume it was better than yesterday.”
As he walks to the parking lot, he can’t help but feel slightly disappointed with his own decision. He’s happy with Cas, and he wants his family to see that. He’s never introduced anyone he’s dated to them; the thought hadn’t even entered his mind before now.
Cas shrugs and smiles widely enough that Dean can see his gums (AKA Cas Smile #3, Dean’s current favorite). “OK, then,” he says. “Although if we really want to be eco-conscious, we should take my car.”
“You never finished answering my text. Do you want to come with me and Ash to grab burritos? Also why don’t you have a shirt on? You’re all flushed. Were you working out?”
“You have a mild concussion, but are in good physical health otherwise. The collision should cause no lasting damage.” Dr Moseley says calmly.
Dean snorts. “Obviously I’m running a long con here, babe. I reap the benefits of having an absolutely friggin’ amazing boyfriend who—in, like, thirty years—
He groans and collapses onto his bed. Before Cas and the renaissance of the Thing, Dean had had every intention of leaving the part of him that thirsted after dudes locked up forever. There was never a good enough reason to pull himself out of the closet; the inevitable complications that would follow never seemed worthwhile.
Bobby smiles briefly before schooling his expression back to his Serious Manager Face. “That it? You’re battin’ almost .400, of course they cheered for you. Now, Doc, tell me more about Rami’s finger.”
“At least once more, Mr Winchester,” he grins widely and walks off towards Ash with another key in his hand.
“Great to see you too, Kath,” Dean puts his hand on Cas’ lower back and says, “This is my boyfriend, Doctor Castiel Shurley.”
Dean clears his throat and drops his hand. “Well, ok, then. Anyone ever told you that your glare is pretty intense?”
loved by him, no matter how much baseball trivia I could recite or how accurately I could predict the score of a game.
Finding the large room used for treating the players empty, Dean walks over to the giant ice machine and begins to fill a plastic bag to tape over his shoulder.
“Oh, hello, Dean,” Cas smiles. “We were just having a conversation about water as a non-renewable resource.”
“I actually quite like the song you chose. And in another life, I could see Sam taking up the mantle of ‘supermodel’.”
Dean had expected to be gutted; to feel like the rug had been ripped out from beneath him. He’d laid awake at night for years imagining how crushed he’d be if John ever found out he was into guys and called him one homophobic slur or another. That hearing those sorts of words directed at him by his father would mean that all the things he feared about himself were true—that he was unworthy of love and somehow less of a man because he maybe sometimes wanted to suck dick.
Dean uses his mitt to slap Sam’s backside before jogging back to the plate and squatting down. As he pulls his mask down over his face, he takes a deep breath, inhaling the smell of grass and dirt and pine tar. He’s home.
“First of all, I raised you better than to speak to people like that, boy.” Bobby points a finger at Dean, fire in his eyes. “And second, if you think there’s any way you’re getting out of the concussion protocol—seven days on injured reserve—you’re livin’ in a fantasy land. Your health comes
“On to the next thing: the team put out their statement supporting you and your right to privacy,” Charlie turns her computer so the screen is facing Dean and Cas. It shows the same brief, carefully-worded paragraph that Gabriel had shared with them earlier, that was now featured on the Angels’ website. Turning the screen back towards herself, Charlie continues, “and since you’ve confirmed the story, now you’re going to need to decide if you want to do any interviews. You’ve already gotten tons of requests, so you can pretty much choose who you want to talk to, if you want to. Bela thinks you should do it because it’ll be ‘good for the Dean Winchester brand,’ but then again, she’s never been outed by an evil corporation run by orcs, so it’s completely up to you.” She shrugs.
“Jesus,” Dean sighs, shaking his head. “I’m truly happy in a relationship for the first time in my goddamn life, and that’s what you have to say to me? Just because it happens to be with a dude?” He scoffs. “Fuck you, man.”
Dean shrugs, exhausted. “There’s nothing I can do about this. Bobby sure won’t let me play, and you’d probably handcuff me to the dugout bench if I tried to set foot on the field with my mitt in the next seven days.”
“Whoa!” Cas wraps his hands around Jack’s middle to stop him from crashing onto the floor. “Hang on, Jack-Jack, I’m almost done.”
“Aww, did you miss me?” Benny winks. “Too bad Sammy had to go and sign his deal, or you’d’ve been hunting with me this winter.”
“Son of a bitch!” Dean tilts his head up towards the sky and takes a deep breath. He turns and sees Bobby and Manny, the bullpen catcher, jogging towards them.
Benny puts a reassuring hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Listen, it was never an issue then and it sure as hell ain’t one now. Do what makes you happy. I support you all the way.”
“Yeah! Grumpy!” Claire takes off running towards Bobby’s office, and Jack immediately squirms to be let down, practically sliding down Dean’s side before running after his sister.
“Gotta go, Bela. I’ll call you later.” He throws his phone on the bed and sprints out of the bedroom. “Fuck, fuck, fuck!”
That was Dean’s first taste of the Majors and his first taste of the postseason and the experience was indescribable. The atmosphere at Wrigley had been electric; the fans were absolutely elated that their team was in the playoffs and when Dean hit his homerun into the left field bleachers in his first at bat, he’d earned their adoration.
Dean’s name is met with screams and cheers, and he grins widely, taking his cap off briefly and tipping it to the crowd. He sees Jo and Ellen in the family section, jumping up and down and clapping for him, and he waves.
Dean’s waiting for his turn to take batting practice, trading idle chit chat with Tony, the third baseman, when he sees Cas emerge from the dugout. He’s talking animatedly with Bobby, but his eyes scan the small groups of players as they stretch or gather in the outfield to shag balls, searching until his gaze falls on Dean and he beams.
angle. We are going to take you to the hospital to get a CT scan and any other tests the doctors there deem necessary. You will
Cas grimaces. “I look back on the audacity I possessed to give advice not only to a stranger on the opposing team, but to an adult… to a professional.” he shakes his head. “I am mortified by my behavior!”
He’s so engrossed in his phone that he doesn’t notice Sam pull up behind him until he honks the horn.
“No, dude. Pump the brakes. I managed to save myself from making a complete fuckup of the situation by telling him that I was projecting into the future.”
He jumps at the sound of Cas’ voice, whipping around in a parody of their first meeting. “Is Wednesday a date?” he blurts out.
Cas looks disappointed and hurt at Dean’s reaction. “I know he was an animal, but he was like family. I don’t think it’s very funny…”
True to his word, the minute that Dean is free of the whirring x-ray coffin, he sits up and sees Cas holding a piece of paper up to the glass window that separates the technicians from the patient.
“So, my dad called.” Dean says immediately, sliding his sunglasses back onto his face as the bus pulls out into the sun from the covered parking garage.
This time it’s Castiel’s turn at embarrassment. His cheeks turn red and as he opens his mouth to say more, Dean jumps in.
From Cas (11:15 pm): Yes, Dean, I promise I won’t forget your toothpaste. God forbid you’d be subjected to using Tom’s of Maine! And, I miss you, too. My apartment barely feels like home, these days…
Dean drops a huge dollop of whipped cream on what must be, at most, three pieces of fruit and smiles serenely. “Well, I guess we’ll never know.”
Cas’ gaze shifted to Dean at some point during his speech, and once again it feels like Cas is looking all the way inside of him. Like he’s looking at his soul.
@OKFine22 (6/11/20 12:15 pm): I’M NOT SAYING I MANIFESTED THIS W/ MY THOUGHTS BUT I MIGHT’VE MANIFESTED THIS W/ MY THOUGHTS YOU GUYS
He finds his brother standing in the middle of the large training room, holding a medicine ball and looking nervous as hell.
Smith makes contact but hits a one-hopper straight to Vic, who scoops it and throws to Benny at first for the out.
“Guys? I’m gonna hop off. Sounds like you’re about to delve into something… uh… something. Ok, byeeeee!” Jo lets her last syllable linger until the FaceTime call cuts out. Dean drops his arm from where he was holding up the phone, not ending the staring contest he and Cas have going.
“It’s wonderful to hear you talk about baseball with such joy. You so rarely talk to the press with this type of passion.”
“I’m real proud of you, you know,” Ellen continues. “I know it’s not easy to be true to yourself all the time, particularly when you’re in the public eye. And I want you to know that me and Bobby, and Jo and Sam, we’re all behind you all the way. I’m so proud of the man you’ve become. And your mom would be too.”
So instead of grabbing for Sam, Dean nods his head and takes Cas’ hand, squeezing it gently. “Yeah, Sammy, it is.”
“That’s true, but plenty of other public figures have come out in the past decade. Pete Buttigieg even ran a relatively successful presidential campaign.”
The buzz of conversation immediately stops and he can feel everyone’s eyes on him as he makes his way across the clubhouse. He leans his wet umbrella against his cubby and lets his bag drop off of his shoulder. He starts going through the same routine he does before every game, but he moves slowly. The weather report said it was going to thunderstorm all day, so there’s no point in rushing to get out onto the field for a rain-out. He keeps his eyes on the task at hand, but he can feel his cheeks burning, knowing the rest of the team is staring at him.
They make plans together for off-days and schedule appointments around each others’ agendas. They bribe each other to do the dishes and take the garbage out. Dean encourages Cas’ experiments in the kitchen, and even starts to look forward to his meals that always involve some sort of creatively-concealed vegetable Dean’s never heard of. He will never admit this to Sam—who has become increasingly more smug with every vegetable that he finds out Cas has succeeded in getting Dean to eat—but dinners following Cas’ visits to the local farmer’s market are usually the food-related highlight of his week.
So for now, Dean closes the door on his relationship shit and forces his mind to think about the fact that the heart of the Dodger batting order is due up at the top of the ninth.
Dean frowns and tries to take stock of his body. “Uh, my head. It feels like I have a pounding headache.” He takes a deep breath in and out and doesn’t cough this time. “But I can breathe normally.”
"Runners in scoring position" = any time a base runner is on second or third, they're considered to be "in scoring position" because any hit could ostensibly result in a run.
“I think my favorite Doctor might be Ten,” Cas says one night while they’re at his apartment, a week before they’re set to leave for California. He leans over Dean to grab another handful of yogurt-covered raisins, but pauses when he sees the look on Dean's face. “What’s wrong?”
Cas sighs contentedly, scratching his nails against Dean’s scalp but telling him, “We don’t have time for this.”
“God, I hate that guy,” Dean pops a few sunflower seeds in his mouth, thinking of the Yankees closer with disdain. “And hey, at least Rocker’s not playing tonight,” he continues, managing to spit shells onto the ground as he speaks.
Dean practically pours the coffee down his throat when he looks at his phone and realizes they have twenty minutes to make it across town. He sprints through the loft, throwing on shorts and a tee shirt before yelling for Sam to stop doing his hair and hurry the fuck up. Bobby may be like a second father to them, but he’ll punish them all the same if they show up late on the first day.
“I like you all sweaty,” Dean says, crawling on his knees to the edge of the bed. He grabs Cas’ wrist and tries to pull him down.
“So, bathrooms are cleaner than the beds in hotels?” Dean asks, closing the glass door behind him and sliding his hands around Cas’ torso.
. We’re playing for the same goddamn team. We have Bobby, Jo, and Ellen. Dad is even still kicking. I have everything I could ever want.”
“Dammit, Dean,” he begins, sounding annoyed. “You make it really hard to stay angry at you when you say things like that.”
New Group Chat with: Bobby, The Notorious JBH, MaEllen, Benny (9:33 am): hey guys just checking in. i’m ok and bela sent over someone to help with all the press and social media and stuff. cas is here and we’re handling everything but pls dont say anything to anyone or post anything about it.
Dean throws his hands up in exasperation. “And I didn’t have a crush on you! I’m just a naturally flirtatious person.”
, causing baseball’s talking heads to remark that “Winchester will be something special in this game.”
Yeah, anything can happen in the playoffs, and maybe it’s hubris but Dean’s brain keeps drifting back to his fantasy of getting the chance to beat the Yankees.
“Shit, maybe that’s how I’ll make my millions!” Charlie rubs her palms together. “Just kidding, I’ll do that with my hacking skills. Jeff Bezos can eat a bag of dicks.” She looks at Cas and Dean again. “In a totally non-sexy way, of course.”
“You really sayin’ your presence on the field is all that’s gonna get us to the Series? Not that you ain’t had a great year, but you sure ain’t the end-all, be-all of the entire 2020 Angels team.”
“Miss Bradbury?” Jessica said, her voice crackling through the phone and snapping Charlie out of her thoughts and escape plans.
"He is well. He has been in Michael's room practically since he got back. I suppose they have a lot to catch up on now that they are unsupervised." Cas almost sounded bitter, but the office people were looking at him impatiently.
Castiel turned and fled down the stairs, tears streaming down his face. He ran past a very confused-looking Sam and slammed the door as he left. What had he done wrong?
creative with the three of them." Ms. Bradbury cleared her throat and Dean shut his mouth, logging into his computer swiftly. He pulled up his school email, but there was nothing waiting for him. Whatever.
John launched up, and Castiel jumped off him before he could be thrown. He looked, disbelieving, at Dean, and he was not alone. John was incredulous, and Sam ran up behind Dean and Castiel and stood there, eyes wide.
Thank you guys so much for reading this and commenting and giving kudos. You guys are the absolute best!
"Cas, hey. I wanted to talk to you," Dean said. Anticipation was building in his stomach, and he felt sick.
She was standing by the door when Castiel walked in. As he took the seat in front of the desk (which had no one sitting behind it), she shut the door and asked, “Castiel Novak?”
"St. Louis." Lucifer grinned as Castiel shot him a disapproving look. "I needed to clear my head, Castiel. Don't tell me you've never thought about running away."
Dean slipped his phone back into his pocket and sighed. He probably wouldn't text Cas after class, if he was being honest with himself. But he wasn't going to tell his boyfriend that. Okay, so maybe he would. But he didn't know how that would go. It might be easier just to break up with him. He didn't deserve Cas anyway. And besides, he was still pretty shocked Cas hadn't left him completely after Dean told him he never loved him. He knew how messed up that was to do to the boy, and still hadn't forgiven himself. Maybe he should just finish the job.
Okay, well...let me know what you guys thought of that chapter. If you want longer chapters, tell me. I can do that. Updates would be slower,  but I could do longer chapters if you want. Just give me some feedback! And if any of you are not doing well, my ask box is always open to you guys and I can give you my email if you want to talk more privately. Always open.
“There wasn’t a note. But everything else looks to be consistent with a suicide. Hanged from an old ceiling hook, chair kicked away.”
Dean took a step forward and ruffled Sam's hair before turning around and walking right out of the office. He was slightly surprised to see Cas still standing there. Dean didn't know what to say to him. He felt bad about ranting on to him the night he found out about his father's death, especially because they had just gotten back together after Dean had been a complete and utter dick to him.
Dean took a deep breath. "That's enough. You," he looked at Meg, "stay away from my boyfriend or so help me I will end you. And you," he looked at Crowley, "I'm flattered. But Cas would say the same thing to you that I just said to Meg." He chuckled. "Now that that is settled—"
Dean felt his protective instincts rising. Lucifer had always given him a weird feeling, but he chalked it up to the name and answered, "He's fine."
Warning for abuse scene. Thank you guys for reading this and I am so sorry it is a little late. College got in my way.
Castiel heard a chuckle on the other end of the line. Dean answered, "Of course I will, Cas. You and your brother saved my life, and now everyone wants me to check in with them all the friggin' time." Castiel detected a note of bitterness. "So of course I will call you. I love you."
Upstairs, he heard a commotion. Dean paused in his work and flinched when Azazel snapped, “Keep going.”
Cas laid his hand on the small of Dean's back as he guided him through the door. Bobby and Ellen were whispering to each other, but when Cas cleared his throat, they looked up. Immediately, Dean was wrapped in a hug from Ellen, and he could feel tears dripping onto his shoulder. Ellen said nothing as she let go and allowed Bobby to hug him as well.
John’s eyes glittered and Castiel heard more noises. He smiled to himself and tied the other end of the rope to a hook on the ceiling. He unbound John, keeping his arm twisted tight behind him, and forced his head through the loop. John struggled, but Castiel was stronger right now. He dragged the chair over with his foot and lifted John on top of it. Then he drew the rope taut and released John, who did not move. The rope around his neck was too tight. He kicked the chair out from under John, and not until he saw the light leave John’s bugged-out eyes did he climb back out the window and remove his white gloves.
Ms. Milton nodded. "There is a difference between strong and unfeeling. Unfeeling means cold, like a marble statue. Having all these emotions, even the bad ones, that's what makes you human."
"Yeah, I'll come sit with you at lunch," Jess responded, a twinkle in her eye. "Have fun." She smiled softly as she made her way around Dean, Crowley, and Meg and toward her class.
Castiel was up like a shot and breezed up the stairs, careening into his room and shutting the door. He dug his phone out of his pocket and scrolled through his contacts until he found the one he was looking for: Dean Winchester. He pressed the call button.
"No you do not. Dean Winchester, I love you, and I need you to be all right. Please can you do that for me?" Cas had won.
Bobby had a horrified look on his face. “What if they have Sean and Owen? Jody wouldn’t do anything to get those two hurt.”
Bobby was washing dishes when Dean made his way downstairs. Dean tried to make it past him without being noticed, but Bobby turned around. "Where you off to?" he asked.
Castiel studied him, and he smiled. "I couldn't just call the police. You guys would have been separated, and I didn't want to destroy your family. So I moved in. I married her. And since then, I have done my absolute best to protect all three of you from her. And I will do the same with your father, if he decides to be a raging homophobe, all right?"
Cas took that pressure off him by wrapping both arms around him. "Oh, Dean, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry you had to deal with any of this."
“Why? Because of what happened to your mother?” Dean’s breathing quickened. “That wasn’t your fault, and you know it.”
Lucifer proved her point by pulling a gun and pointing it at them. “Knife down.” Charlie’s eyes were steel. Jess’s legs were jelly. “Knife. Down.”
Sam yawned and turned his attention to the teacher as he clenched his fists under the table, digging his nails into the flesh of his palm. He liked Jess, dammit. He liked Jess.
Gabriel's face twisted into a smile, but Castiel was not going to lie to their father. "Dean was having a problem."
"That's pretty understandable. But I have to go. Class, and all that." Sam felt bad having to hang up, but he had to.
"Dean said that he might torture you tomorrow. How does that sound?" Sam looked desperately at his brother, who was not looking at him at all. "Remember there's a way for you to avoid that?"
Without missing a beat, Dean responded, "Hey, Cas. Hey Gabe. I'm fine, don't worry about me." At that, Gabriel finished turning the key. "No, I just wanted to hear your voice earlier, but there was no answer."
"Well, you did something." Castiel felt tears forming in his eyes, and his older brother put an arm around his shoulder and drew his head close. "Don't be sad, Castiel. Everything is going to be all right. No one is going to find out. Trust me, I saw the autopsy report. You did well."
Dean didn't allow her to get farther with her statement. "He didn't. That's not like him, not at all."
." Gabriel drew out the name as sarcastically as seemed to be possible. "Anyway, up and at 'em! It's visiting day, in case you forgot." At that, Castiel shot up.
She thought about it for a moment, then said, “Okay. Well, I have cameras and mikes at my house, so I can go pick those up and bring them to you guys. How many do you need?”
Castiel shot up, fully awake with no time to adjust and no coffee, both typical staples of the morning. He supposed it was because of the large amount of sleep he had gotten. He looked at his brother and nodded. "I'll get dressed. Meet you downstairs in 30?"
Ellen laughed. “Then do it.” Lucifer Novak was here, she had lost Bobby, Jody, and now her boys. The thought that Lucifer might be about to end her existence was, frankly, quite welcome. Nonetheless, she stood, keeping the gun pointed at the man standing in front of her.
Cas scoffed. "You should do it anyway. I would greatly enjoy seeing John try to do anything about it." His eyes sparkled dangerously.
If he hadn't killed John Winchester, none of this would have been set in motion, Dean would have turned 18, probably taken custody of Sam, and everything could have worked out. But no. Instead, Castiel had been rash and killed someone, and now everybody was suffering because of it. Castiel hated it.
John’s clumping footsteps followed them, but Sam managed to pull Dean into his room and put the desk chair under the doorknob. When he turned around. Dean was unconscious on the floor. Immediately, Sam knelt beside him and checked his pockets for a phone. Not finding it there, he waited until he could hear John snoring. By the alarm clock on the nightstand it was two in the morning. Dean was still unconscious.
"Sit down." Bobby had a deep frown on his face. Both boys obeyed, sitting next to each other on the couch. Ellen sat down as well, followed by Bobby, who sat back in the recliner. "I'm going to tell you a story. There was a father whose little girl was the joy of his life."
Dean didn't answer, instead turning his head to the side, confirming Sam's suspicions. Sam sobbed out loud. What the hell had happened to them?
This was marvelous. Father was home, and most likely inquiring after his youngest son. As per usual on his infrequent trips home. "Oh?" Castiel said. "What did he want?" Not now. Please not now. His father was already convinced of his instability, and right now was not the time for him to come home. Not when Castiel was trying to come to terms with a murder and his boyfriend's near-suicide.
He stepped into the shower and let the hot water run over his body until he felt awake. Then he turned the water cooler and washed himself. By the time he was out of the shower, Michael was standing outside the door, a deep scowl on his face. “Finally. You realize we all need to use the bathroom, right, Castiel?”
Dean stood leaning against the driver's door to the Impala, keys resting in his hand as he waited for his brother to come out of the building. He did so, alone, to Dean's surprise. He made his way down into the parking lot. As he reached the car, Dean asked, "No Jess?"
She arched an eyebrow. "Oh? And what reputation might that be?" She crossed her arms over her breasts and stared Sam down.
...........................................................................................................................................................
Castiel winced, then went back to his starting place, glancing at his ex boyfriend bleeding on the table. Alastair Rolston was one of the best torturers Lucifer had ever worked with, and the things he was doing to Dean really ranked as a masterpiece. Especially with the psychological side effects it was having on his brother.
Sam slammed his mental door shut on that voice and retreated into his own head, where he might be safer. It was back. Damn it all, the voice was back.
“They aren’t sure yet. It seems like a suicide.” Suicide? What? His dad wouldn’t kill himself. No. What?
“When?” Lucifer demanded. Damn it, not tonight. This wasn’t the time for a rescue mission to happen.
True to those orders, Dean kept up the pace of cuts until the light had left his eyes and Sam physically couldn’t scream anymore. No one was coming. The commotion was nothing. Sam was sure of it now.
“His name is Lucifer, Gabriel. And no. Michael and I will be going to pick him up as soon as we are finished eating.” With that, their father placed his last bite in his mouth, chewed, and swallowed slowly. He stood and took his bowl to the sink, rinsing it just as Gabriel had.
There was a long pause on the other end of the line. “I never thought I would see the day. Huh. John Winchester abandoning his family. Go to hell.”
Dean hung up the phone and opened the glove box. He took the shotgun out and held it close to his body. Cas had actually convinced him not to do it. Dean had no idea how, but his boyfriend had convinced him.
Castiel felt the first tears fall. He had made a murder look like a professional killing. How had he done that? "I cannot believe I killed him, Lucifer. It feels so heavy."
Lucifer's eyes glittered. "You know, I heard that John Winchester committed suicide." Castiel shifted uncomfortably. "Could little Castiel perhaps have had something to do with that?"
.............................................................................................................................................................
She slipped her white and turquoise switchblade into the pocket Ruby had sown into her dress and went back downstairs. Sean Mills had indeed calmed down quite a bit. The son was crying still. Lilith made her way over to the closet and opened the door. The son could see every action she took.
Dean released, and Cas threw it to Gabriel. Dean wondered if Cas had realized the safety was still on it. "Cas..."
Castiel nodded and made a shooing gesture with his hands. Gabriel turned and left Castiel to his thoughts. He was looking forward to seeing his older brother, but that didn't stop a sinking feeling as he realized that (once again) it would be just him and Gabriel visiting Lucifer in the hospital. Why didn't their father and brother ever visit with them?
Jessica took all this relatively well, nodding a couple times during Castiel’s explaination and biting her lip. “Has Sam been hurt?”
His older brother was prone, held down, and bleeding already, lacerations on his cheekbones, nose trickling. Their eyes met, and Dean shook his head, but the word “Stop!” bubbled out of Sam’s chest and erupted from his mouth, audible over the drunken yelling.
He got up and left anyway. Dean never opened up to him until whatever was eating at him got to be too much, and the fire had been pushed to the back for a decade or so now. Sam couldn't see Dean telling him what blanket it had been, but he knew. He knew exactly. Dean still had the damn thing, even if he tried to hide it from everyone. It was Sam's fault that their mother died, then. Not that Dean would ever let him put the blame on himself, no. Dean was the one who ran to get it.
"Dean, I-" Sam began, but Dean shot him a look, and he shut his mouth, shaking his head. He sat back in the seat, and didn't open his mouth the entire way to school.
Jess seemed to have an uncanny ability to make Sam feel better. He had been almost smiling since he crashed into her that morning. She wouldn't stop cracking jokes and generally keeping Sam's mind off of what happened as well as she could. She intertwined her fingers with his, and he walked her to all her classes. Though he knew he was sad, he was happy with her. He told her the number for the Singer-Harvelle house, and she put it in her phone immediately, promising to call that night. He walked her to her car, which was beside Cas's, incidentally, and barely stopped himself from planting a kiss on her cheek. Not yet. But it seemed she didn't care for that boundary, because she pressed her lips to his cheek after the hug he had decided was better. Dean and Cas waited patiently, then the three got in the car they had borrowed from Bobby and headed home. Cas stayed for dinner, then Dean drove him home. Sam stayed up for a bit to do his little homework and then went to bed.
When Ellen opened the door, she took in the sight of Jess’s teary face and pulled her into a crushing hug, during which Jess whispered, “I’m fine, but your house might be bugged and I need to talk to you.”
"I think I'm going to head up to my room," Dean said quickly, and ran up the stairs. He heard footsteps behind him and said, "I'm not going to do anything, I swear. I need sleep."
Michael opened it and shook Dean's hand immediately. "Dean Winchester. I am glad to see you here. Castiel will be down in a moment. I believe our stepfather is talking to him upstairs." He stepped aside with a smile. "Why don't you come in and sit down?"
Castiel and Michael did not exchange words as they shoveled breakfast into their mouths. (Well, Castiel shoveled. Michael ate with grace, though just as quickly as Castiel.) They were just rinsing the plates when their father came downstairs, fully dressed for church, followed by Gabriel, who was not dressed sloppily, but whose outfit was hardly formal.
Lucifer shrugged. "As was to be expected," he said without explanation. "What have you been doing since I left?" He stared at Castiel with piercing eyes, and Castiel felt compelled to tell the truth.
He drew the knife across her upper throat and let her fall. She was still alive, still seeing what was happening as Lucifer covered both Charlie and herself with some sort of fluid (was that gasoline?) and lit a match.
She crossed her arms and stared him down for a few moments before bursting out with , You cannot lock that door. Please leave it unlocked. I need to be able to get in, in case.." She trailed off, but Dean knew where that statement was leading. In case he attempted again. Not as though he even attempted the first time. Actually, he hadn't done a damn thing to hurt himself, so why was he here? Why was everybody stressed out about this?
Dean spun around and hissed, "You texted Gabriel. That's what you did." Sam's eyes widened and Dean could see tears welling up in them. But at this point, he couldn't care less. "You saved my damn life." He stepped forward and jabbed a finger into his brother's collarbone. "If you hadn't, I wouldn't be in this mess of a school, in our mess of a family, none of it." Tears began leaking from Sam's eyes. "And then you had the
He was not going to school today. That was why. He leapt out of bed and rummaged on the top of his dresser to find his cell phone. There were no messages for him, so he sent one.
Castiel sharply nodded again, but Sam was the one who answered. "We need to do something about Dad. Now."
Sam took a step forward and placed a giant hand on Dean's shoulder. "Hey. You're going. If I have to drag you out to the Impala myself, you are going. You are going to pick up your boyfriend and take him to Easter dinner with his family." Dean started shaking, and Sam brought him in for a hug. "Everything's going to be fine."
The woman paused before speaking. He didn’t grudge her the hesitation. “Ellen,” she finally said. She didn’t acknowledge the presence of Castiel, who hadn’t said anything. They all three went down the stairs, and that was when all hell broke loose.
Dean wiped the tears from his eyes and whispered, "Dammit, Sammy...I wish I couldn't feel a damn thing."
He wandered the hall, eventually making his way upstairs and seeing her going into the English room. Glancing around in the hallway for any known Novak spies (and seeing none), he ran up to her. “Jessica?”
Sam went straight to the office downstairs and asked to use their phone. They didn’t even ask questions, which was odd, but Sam didn’t think much of it as he dialed Cas’s cell phone number.
Dean did just that, sinking into the couch. "So how are you? I don't think we've talked in ages." He took in the outfit Michael was wearing and was slightly relieved. He was wearing a black suit and necktie. But then again, this was Michael, and Dean remembered Cas telling him his oldest brother took things like this extremely seriously.
So Sam didn’t think the name. Instead, he let Ellen minister to him, let himself be helped up, and hobbled his slow and painful way to the truck with her. He didn’t look at the bodies on the ground. He didn’t want to know. Hearing Dean wail in pain was enough for him. Whoever they were, they were people near and dear to their hearts. He wasn’t prepared to deal with that.
"No can do, Sammy. No can do. Too tired to turn around now." The enthusiasm Dean had been faking faded from his voice. Nothing left to do now but hang up.
Dean's eyes widened and he genuinely grinned. He looked at the note and back up at his teacher's smiling face. "Really? I will
A bit of Dean angst. I am so sorry the update is late and that the chapter is short...I haven't been able to motivate myself to write a damn thing lately. I've  not been having the best of times recently, so even producing this was pretty miraculous. So again, I apologize. I should have a couple more shorter chapters up fairly soon.
Gabriel was completely fixated on the chocolate he was consuming. So much so that he didn't notice the dejected expression on Castiel's face. It was not like Castiel was expecting him to notice, though. In fact, he would greatly prefer it if Gabriel did not notice.
Ellen was tender as she set Dean's nose and bandaged him up, but she certainly wasn't quiet about her complete hatred for his father. "That bastard. He shows up here, I'll shoot him. Shoot him."
He found Dean upstairs. “We need you downstairs. Bobby needs to talk to everyone and it doesn’t sound good.”
"This little girl thought she was all grown up, so one day, she decided to teach herself to drive. That night, she snuck out of bed and went into her father's scrapyard. She climbed behind the steering wheel and turned the key in the ignition. That car's engine exploded, and she died. After that, the father and the mother were very upset. The father kept a gun in the top drawer of his desk, with a single bullet inside. That bullet was the bullet that was going in his brain."
"Yeah. We're driving up together." Awkward, Dean. Come on. They know that...why else would you be here? He plastered a smile on his face, trying to cover up his obvious statement.
Crowley smiled at him, and that, rather than his mother's scowl, was what Castiel chose to focus on. Michael placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder. "Are we dismissed, Mother? I believe Castiel has a phone call he would like to make."
Castiel walked all the way home. Well, it was pretty close to Dean’s house, but it felt so much longer. Castiel did not know if he would ever be able to go back; for all he knew, this was the last time he would walk away from the Winchesters’ home. He was already home when he got the phone call, staring out the window watching to see when John would get back.
Jess nodded. “I trust you two. You love them.” Tears were swimming in her eyes, and Ellen suppressed her maternal instinct to lean forward and wipe them away. Instead, she glanced at her watch.
It was strange to have the amount of electronic equipment on that Bobby Singer and his wife did right now. Jody seemed fairly all right with it, but then again she was the sheriff and probably needed electronic equipment in her ears, on her jacket, and a couple other places on a more regular basis.
He picked up the phone again and called Bobby’s cell phone, but he was sent to voicemail almost immediately.
Dean wakes up with tears streaming down his face. He quashes the sadness the nightmare stirred in him. He shoves the thought that it was his fault deep down. Cas doesn't think it's his fault. But the feeling persists. If it weren't one in the morning Dean would call Cas, but he didn't want to wake his boyfriend up. He didn't want to bother him. So he got up and got a drink of water, hoping the dream wouldn't come back when he went back to sleep.
She swallowed, shaking her head to clear the image of Dorothy’s throat being cut while Charlie leapt out the open window. Pains shot up her leg from where her ankle had broken. “The Novaks?” she asked, feigning ignorance.
Sam released the breath he didn't know he'd been holding when Ms. Bradbury started talking to Dean. He wasn't sure why his brother had snapped at him earlier. He had only been trying to help. And honestly, he was just really worried about his brother. Why did Dean get so offended? The one minute warning bell rang, and he shook his head, focusing on getting to his English class on time.
She shoved it into Sean Mills’ mouth and tightened the strap behind his head. He could still scream, but he couldn’t mouth off, and that was the way Lilith liked it.
About midway through the day, the sheriff showed up at the school, and Castiel was called to the office.
Azazel entered shortly after Alastair left. Dean's chest was constricted with fear still. Alastair was going to keep thinking about Dean's motivations for laughing and take out his confusion on him tomorrow. Dean could feel it.
John mumbled something Sam couldn’t hear and started advancing. Dean launched to his feet and threw himself in front of Sam. Damn it, of course he would do that. Sam could see Dean trembling, and knew they didn’t have long before Dean collapsed.
Dean had attempted suicide. Not that Sam hadn't thought about it or even come close to trying, but the thought that his older brother (if he was being honest with himself, his idol) had tried to take himself out of the world made his chest hurt. He lay down face-first on the bed and inhaled deeply through the fabric.
Bobby walked into the room while Dean was worrying. "Cas left, thought you should know. Bringin' the car back to his dad."
Sam heard the crashing and went outside, but was not expecting what he saw. And as Dean hit the ground, he walked forward softly, so as not to disturb his older brother. He sat beside him and put an arm over his shoulder. Dean didn't move, just kept his head in his hands. When he finally looked up at Sam, Sam said, "Do you feel any better?"
Ms. Bradbury was unfazed. "I don't know you?" She laughed a little. "Dean, you have been in my class for four years. I know you."
It rang four times before a tired, low voice said, “Why in the name of all that is holy are you awake?”
She could hear the hardening in the girl’s voice when she answered. “They are being tortured, and I know the Novaks are coming after you, too, so you might want to take this seriously, Miss Middleton.”
She reached the house, slightly out of breath, and jumped off her bike, letting it fall to the ground behind her as she ran up the front steps and knocked on the door. She willed tears to come to her eyes. If they were really in danger, she would have to get them out of the house. What better than a mourning girlfriend wanting to talk to her late boyfriend’s almost-parents, maybe go out somewhere with them?
“Hell yes I did. Because it’s true.” Sam laughed, but he wasn’t sure why he did. “Mom wouldn’t have let him kick you out. She would have stood up for you and you know it.”
He opened the door of his car and got out, walking around the front and sinking into the grass of the shoulder on the other side. He kept holding the gun close to him. He wasn't going to use it, obviously, but it brought him comfort while he waited for Cas and Gabe to show up and drag him back to Bobby, Ellen, and Sam.
Cas saw the honey-colored hair before anything else and made a beeline for Dean at his locker, dodging easily through the crowded hallway. He leaned against the locker next to his boyfriend and said, “Hello, Dean.”
“Your computer teacher is an international criminal, wanted by Interpol, the FBI, and several other organizations. Oh, but she’s clever.” Ellen was impressed by the mastery behind the name change. “The only thing that is similar is the face. She cut her hair, dyed it red. Thank God for facial recognition.” Google wasn’t generally good at that, but if you scroll enough, you’ll find what you’re looking for.
Gabriel opened the door and the pair of them went inside. Michael greeted them in the kitchen. "Father is waiting for you in his study," he said quietly. Castiel considered asking him how his visit with Lucifer went, but decided against it. Michael told him nothing when he usually asked, anyway.
Sam grinned. “Well, Jessica Moore wanted my phone number, so that’s something.” He happily went on about Jessica, and Dean sank back into the couch, listening intently. A smile rested on his face.
Radio silence. Bobby took that as agreement and started driving. It didn’t take long to find the residence. The windows were curtained, but there was light behind them. They drove past the house, parking around the corner, and started walking back toward the house.
His mom came out of the kitchen. "John, really? You leave Dean alone." She wrapped Dean in a hug and whispered in his ear, "Use protection."
Bobby and Ellen could be that for Sam. At least, Dean hoped they would be. They needed someone to take care of...ever since Jo, they had been depressed and unsure. They always did their best to hide it from the boys. Since the Singer-Harvelle household had always been a safe haven from their family problems, their two surrogate parents didn't want them exposed to problems there, too. But Dean had picked up on the constant tension and realized how sad they were all the time. Maybe with Sam there full-time, they would feel a little better. Sam was only a couple years older than Jo had been, after all.
Sam had cried himself to sleep in Dean's arms. If that didn't merit death, nothing did. Whoever killed John caused Sammy a hell of a lot of grief, and that pissed Dean off to no end. He was shoving his own grief down into that pit he shoved all his feelings into. Nothing he could do about it, so why bother feeling it? Why bother to sit in the dark and suffer? No, he was going to investigate this.
"We'd like you to explain the next step to Dean, if you don't mind." This was Ellen, whose voice was shakier than Dean had ever heard it. Guilt washed over him. How dare he hurt them like this?
He broke away from the hug and planted a light kiss on the tear. "Come on, Dean. We need to get to class."
Azazel wasn't in the room. He never was, not during a training session. His job came later. Aftercare. He was the one who told Dean what would be done to him the next day. He was the one who whispered to Sam that one of these days he would take the instruments from Alastair and cut into his older brother.
.................................................................................................................................................................................
She looked around. Everyone had already been assigned their partner but Sam, so she made her way through the mess of tables to sit right next to him. "Name's Ruby," she said with a wolfish smile.
Alastair wiped his knife on Dean's jeans and grinned. "I may be a psychology student, but taking someone apart is far more fun than putting him back together." He raised his eyebrows, and Dean shuddered. "Or her, I don't discriminate."
Sam listened, openmouthed, as Dean concluded his story with, "And she died in the hospital that night. Smoke inhalation, I think."
The slap had drawn the attention of a few people, but Castiel summoned an intimidating aura, the one he assumed to made his way through the hallway without incident, and they moved on. No teachers showed up, which was lucky. “I know, Jessica, they talked to me too. Will you just hear me out?” Castiel adopted a slightly pleading tone. Jessica gave him a curt nod and a single raised eyebrow.
That was the final straw. The straw that broke the camel's back, and he had been carrying quite a load already. "I'm not going to crash the friggin' car, Sam. Look at her. She's a thing of beauty. Why the hell would I crash her?"
Dean let out a low chuckle, which Cas took to mean Dean had understood his statement was a joke. “So. First day back.” Dean was not meeting Cas’s gaze. “God, I hate this place. But you shoulda seen Sammy this morning, bouncing around like it was Christmas morning.”
Ms. Milton looked as though she were about to comment, but she said nothing regarding that. Instead she said, "I was so sorry to hear about your father. I know it is often difficult to deal with the loss of a parent, especially when that parent took his own life."
Castiel smiled. This was familiar ground. He looked up at the buzzing beehive hanging from the limb of the oak tree in the front yard. His brother was home, and they had been invited to Easter dinner by their father, and Mother was throwing a fit. All was as it should be. He relaxed for a few more moments before standing up and going in the house. The yelling seemed to have died down.
"Well let's go. We can't deprive the boys of their father, darling. Lucifer, why don't you call him and tell him we'll be there." Castiel found a smile forming on his face. When he looked on either side of him at his brothers, he saw smiles on both of their faces as well.
Should he answer it? He was almost to his destination. One more call wouldn't hurt. Especially if...if it was Gabriel's phone. It could be Cas. Dean needed to say goodbye.
Sorry this took so long, guys, things started piling up on me with life and I hadn't been able to write this. I did manage an update on my other WIP, With Certainty (which is a trans!fem!Dean fic), and I decided that I really needed to work on this one. If you guys are still with me after the wait, you rock! (If not, you still rock but you aren't reading the ending so :(  )
Dean made his way absentmindedly to the cafeteria, post-it note clenched in his hand. He went through the line and presented the note to the supervisor, who nodded and sent him on his way. He made his way down the hall with his to-go tray and went into the computer lab, where Ms. Bradbury waited with none other than
Castiel hit send and set down his phone. He pulled on some boxers and opened up his closet. His father would definitely want him dressed well for their brother’s return. He decided on a white button-down and jeans, hoping his father would not expect him to change in favor of something dressier. It was Lucifer, for pity’s sake. The instant he was able to dress as he wished to, he was going to be in dark skinny jeans and band t-shirts.
Ellen nodded thoughtfully. “We need help. Cas told you this so you could rally people, right?” When Jess nodded, Ellen continued, “I should call Jody.”
"Hey, to each their own. You enjoy shipping Jack and Mussolini, I enjoy the somewhat-past-subtext between Nine and Ten, Rose, and Jack."
Castiel watched multiple expressions cross over his father's face, but it finally settled on a decent amount of concern. "A problem?"
Lucifer nudged Castiel and looked directly into his eyes. Castiel knew if he lied, Lucifer would know. He had always been excellent at detecting lies. "Yes," he said quietly. "I did."
Castiel almost cried with relief when they reached Bobby and Ellen's house, but he knew they were not out of reach yet. John knew Bobby and Ellen would be the first people his sons would go to for help, and would react accordingly. Castiel shoved that worry to the back of his mind and got out of the car. He went around to the trunk and opened it.
After a few minute ride into town, Bobby pulled into a local diner and they all got out of the truck. All three ordered hamburgers when the waitress came to serve them, and when she was gone, the older couple turned a questioning eye on Jess, who launched into her story, beginning with, “So apparently Sam is alive…and so is Dean.”
Charlie stared at her. “Get out of here,” she said, pulling a knife from her belt. Jess hadn’t even realized she was carrying one. She wondered why it wasn’t a gun. Wouldn’t it be better to have a gun?
To tell the truth, Dean was almost relieved to be part of this interaction, because he couldn't just leave it. It gave him an outlet for some of his more destructive energy. The three of them walked out of the computer lab together, Dean in the middle of their bickering. On their way upstairs to their lockers, the three ran into Sam and Jess, who were holding hands, Dean smugly noted. "Dean!" Sam exclaimed before turning his head to look at Jess and untangling his hand from hers. "I've got to talk to my brother. I'll see you later?"
Crowley shrugged. "It doesn't really matter. I'll just take the seat next to you." He motioned to Meg, who was watching the exchange with interest.
When Sam was there, John always hesitated. Sam took the opportunity, grabbed Dean, and yanked him up the stairs. John’s heavy footsteps followed behind them, but were too slow to stop Sam from pulling Dean into his room, slamming the door, and wedging a chair under the knob. When he turned around, Dean was swaying, and Sam barely managed to direct his fall to the bed, where he lay unconscious.
Dean's eyes cleared of all emotion and he frowned. "No, Cas. We're through. I don't love you. Now leave."
Castiel was shaking hard by the time he got out the door. Dean blamed himself for his father being dead. He blamed himself and had tried to kill himself because of it. This was Castiel's fault and he knew it. If Sam hadn't found the note and called Gabriel, Dean would have died and Castiel would have been to blame.
echoed through the hallway, and it took a moment for Castiel to register that she had backhanded him. In a fierce whisper, she demanded, “And you didn’t tell anyone? You didn’t fucking tell Dean, or me or any of the counselors…they had grief counselors, here, Castiel. Grief. Counselors. Everyone thought he was dead.”
Sam shook his head and stood. Dean rose as well and blocked Sam’s path out of the living room. Castiel could not see Sam’s face, but Dean was obviously trying to talk him out of something. Then John walked back in, a glass of something (probably whiskey) in his hand. Briefly. He swallowed its contents and threw the cup. Sam dodged, and Castiel ran into the house.
"This will turn into an obsession, Dean, and it is not healthy. You can't go chasing off after what killed your father...it will drive you insane. You just need to look forward. Feel what you need to feel."
Castiel felt tears coming to his eyes, and his voice cracked as he said, "I love you too, Dean. Be safe."
With that, Castiel turned and left, not wanting to talk to them anymore, just in case he was arrested for assault or murder. Wouldn't want Bobby or Sam to get in trouble for what Castiel was doing by himself.
But she also inspired confidence in him. If Ellen had called any of his teachers, he was glad it was Ms. Bradbury. He figured she could keep it a secret. "Yeah," he said. "I trust you."
Azazel went to Sam's bed first, whispering things in his ears that made Sam whimper and sniffle and at one point he screamed the word "no," but Azazel slapped him and shut huim right up. Dean wished he knew what the bastard was saying to his little brother, but knew he was never going to know. As Azazel made his way across the room to where Dean was strapped down, he had the tiniest of a skip in his step.
Ice dropped into Dean's belly. Alastair would torture Sam? Dean couldn't let that happen...but somehow he thought that if he tortured Sam, it would damage him worse than if Alastair did. There was no way he could get away with going easy on his little brother. Alastair would definitely not go easy on his brother. "Let me sleep on it," he said, shoving as much confidence as he could into his voice.
Lucifer grinned at his brother as the downstairs clock struck twelve. "Do you want to go out for lunch? I haven't had a sandwich from that cafe down by the bookshop in ages."
Lucifer shrugged. “Personal reasons. Now, I will offer you a single chance to get the hell out of here.”
The cameras followed their car ride and their walk. Jess and Charlie watched as the trio picked the lock on the Novak residence and went inside. They were walking down a hallway when a real voice sounded behind them.
After school, Castiel went home and dropped off his books, then went to the Winchester house. There was no crime tape anywhere, so he assumed Sheriff Mills had not actually come out to the house yet. This left him little to no time, so he put on his cotton gloves and climbed in through the window he had left unlocked in the back. No one was watching him.
He looked around for a bit before he saw Jess, with an open seat next to her. He grinned and made his way over there, setting down his tray before asking, "Is this seat taken?"
Did the rope leave burns on John? Would an autopsy turn up something Castiel missed in his estimations? Dean was convinced John would have left a note. Should Castiel have forged one, or depended on John having alcohol in his system as he had done. Castiel sat against his bedroom wall and wrapped his arms around his legs.
Dean seemed to realize this as well, as he nodded in agreement. “You have a point. All right. I’ll call Bobby and Ellen.”
"Hey Cas, what's up?" Dean poured the same cheerfulness into this as he had when he first started talking to Sam. Though Cas's greeting hadn't been exactly ignorant of the situation, he hoped he could dispel worry.
Dean fiddled with his bow tie. "Are you sure this is good for dinner with Cas's dad? I don't want to seem like I think I'm better than them."
“Sam, you finished second in the Cy Young voting. Can we expect to see anything different from you next season to help you improve?”
Dean frowns and fumbles around for his phone to check that Sam’s not fucking with him. It wouldn’t be the first time. “Ok, fine. What do you want?”
Cas tilts his head and deepens the kiss, opening his mouth just a bit in invitation. Dean groans and pushes him against the butcher block island, goosebumps breaking out on his arms when he feels Cas’ tongue against his own.
Cas smiles at Sam, and then looks at Dean pensively. “Thank you for telling me about your childhood. It must be difficult to discuss such a tumultuous time in your lives.”
“Oh, thank fuck, you stubborn jerk. I was worried I’d have to sic my mom on you to get you to take your injuries seriously,” she says, smiling brightly while Dean levels his best scowl at her.
of Jo being able to date whoever she wanted, and people were “proud” of her for being “brave” enough to be herself. Would they react the same way to him? Would they be proud of him and celebrate his bravery? Sam certainly thinks so.
“God, I love watching you come,” Dean says reverently, trying to memorize his blissed out expression.
“And, one queer to another, I’m really freaking proud to have a guy like you representing us to the public.”
Dean looks out at the ocean and tries to imagine what that would be like; what it would feel like. The idea of opening himself up to the public in such a real way makes his skin crawl, but on the other hand, a future spread out before him of not hiding makes his breath catch in his chest. To let go of that voice that tells him to shut the door on anything that’s not the carefully curated Dean he’s been presenting to the world. To get rid of the fear that no one is going to accept him if he’s one-hundred percent his authentic self.
“I mean, they’re always speculating about injuries and our personal lives and shit, you know? Like that CrowFeed article that came out when Benny signed with us two years ago, and they dug up his ex to give that insane interview about how he’s a sex addict?”
“I think,” Cas says one night after Dean returns from having dinner with Sam and Ruby, “that you have to give Sam the benefit of the doubt in this situation. You’re not in the relationship, and you just have to trust that Sam knows what he’s doing.”
“It should be disturbing that you talk about your car with the same enthusiasm normal people reserve for their own children, but I guess I’ve become desensitized to your unique brand of insanity.”
“You’re forgiven, I guess.” Dean turns to face Cas, a serious expression on his face. “But we might have to go back and watch all of Christopher Eccleston’s episodes again. I can’t have my boyfriend going around spouting incorrect opinions about Doctor Who.”
“Uh, yeah,” Sam says awkwardly. “So, that’s Bobby, who’s our manager and obviously a lot more than that, but you know that already. And there’s Benny, our first baseman. The little one is his son, Caleb, and his wife, Kathleen, is holding him.”
Dean just looks out the window and remains silent. He’s not ready to talk about this with Sam, and he knows his brother won’t push it after their earlier conversation.
“Did you know that Bernie Williams is an accomplished jazz musician? He was nominated for a Latin Grammy. And he showed me how to Cha-Cha.”
Rami takes a fourth ball for a walk and it’s finally Sam’s turn at the plate. He takes a few steps towards home base with his shoulders tensed, apparently bracing himself for whatever song is about to start playing.
“Walt Whitman once said, ‘I see great things in baseball. It's our game, the American game. It will repair our losses and be a blessing to us.’ You could look it up.” - Annie Savoy,
“Dude, she friggin’ ordered his dinner for him. And she was being super-shady about her background, never giving me a straight answer about anything.”
“No, no hot date, sadly. I’m going back to the coldly modern, pre-furnished apartment Gabriel arranged for me, where I have a huge stack of player profiles to get through. Shocking as it may be, you’re apparently not the only baseball player on this team.” Cas’ deep voice is without a whiff of sarcasm, but he tempers his comment with a small smile.
“He’s proven to be very obstinate when it comes to discussing his diet,” Castiel says calmly. “Sam invited me to come to their home for dinner this weekend in an effort to cow Dean into submission regarding the amount of red meat he eats.”
stretch of the imagination. It’s days like this that he curses his parents for having a second kid. He’s still angry enough that he wants to take Sam by his gigantor shoulders and shake the shit out of him, but he needs to make sure that Sam’s not in any immediate danger of being further fucked with.
“We’re going to the fucking WORLD SERIES!” Dean cries into Cas’ shoulder, hugging his boyfriend tightly. He looks over and sees Sam spluttering as he gets sprayed by a stream of shaken-up champagne that Benny has aimed straight into his face, and Dean is caught by a sudden wave of affection for his idiot brother.
“Yeah, but I’m cuter.” He turns to Mayers. “Chapman can’t lay off a changeup inside. Let’s fuckin’ do this.”
“I beg to differ.” He looks around the parking lot, then squeezes Dean’s hand once before letting it drop again. “You had a great game. Congratulations on winning the home opener.”
. And you should hear what the guys at the site have to say about this shit! Christ, you’re an embarrassment.”
“Wow, there is so much wrong with that statement; I don’t know where to begin. Is it at least stuck on something good?”
“Thanks so much for your advice and everything. You’ve been great,” Dean says as he walks her to the door.
. He’s considering quitting his job so that he can be at Cas’ disposal whenever Cas feels the desire to put his hands, lips, tongue, etc. on any and all parts of Dean, when all of a sudden his orgasm rushes through him and all coherent thought is cut off.
, you know? He didn’t abandon us, and he made sure we were fed and had beds to sleep in. But yeah, it sucked. So eventually I asked if we could stay with Bobby or our mom’s friend, Ellen, instead of going with him. I didn’t want Sam to have to deal with school like I did. Plus, I was fucking sick of it. So, yeah. That’s why Bobby’s so close to us. He and Ellen basically raised us, letting us split time between them when Dad went on a job. Ellen’s daughter is Jo Harvelle, the PT. So it’s like one big, dysfunctional, baseball family.
The Angels wind up facing the Tigers in the AL Division Series and beat them in a three-game sweep of the best-of-five series. The games go so well that Dean feels like he’s in some sort of 90’s sports-movie montage, complete with a Kenny Loggins soundtrack and dugout hijinks, courtesy of Ash.
“Whatever, man. All I’m saying is, you could’ve had literally any car in the world, and you picked this one.”
“Everything OK?” Cas asks a moment later, having moved to stand next to Dean against the railing of the dugout.
“Shut your damn pie hole, you overgrown ape,” Dean hisses at his brother. “How about we put these sorry excuses for protein on the grill?” He says, clearly attempting to change the subject.
“It’s fine, I get it,” Dean says. “It’s exhausting, thinking like this. But I, uh...you know...I’m just not ready for the world to know.” He pulls Cas in and hugs him to his chest. “It won’t be like this forever. I promise.”
He startles as a car horn blasts shrilly from behind him, demanding that he move Baby forward the twenty feet that had opened between him and the Subaru in front of him. His heart is beating wildly in his chest, and he shakes his hands out from where they were whiteknuckling the steering wheel. Dean feels an odd, tingling sensation at the bridge of his nose and in his hands and he realizes that he’s more gasping in air than he is taking actual breaths.
“You’re making it very difficult to focus on these evaluations when all I can think about is bending you over the nearest flat surface and having my way with you,” he responds in a low, breathy voice.
“Oh, yeah, right. Nice to meet you, man. I’ve heard a lot about you.” Dean holds out his hand, waiting for the doctor to shake it.
“I can say with all confidence that this is certainly the weirdest way to start a first date that I’ve ever experienced.” Dean signs his name quickly and watches while Gabriel stamps and dates the document.
“Fuck,” he mutters, throwing his arm over his eyes to concentrate on 1) not coming before Cas even gets his dick in him, and 2) not doing something embarrassing like weeping over the depth of emotion he feels for the insanely hot dude who’s currently going to town on him.
Cas looks up, his expression giving no clues regarding his feelings on the matter. “Do you want to?”
Cas stops what he’s doing and stares at Dean. “Do you think it would be so terrible? That they’d accuse you of being a sex addict or something?”
Six pack in hand, he knocks confidently on Cas’ door and schools his expression into his patented, Joey Tribbiani-esque smirk that’s served him so well for the past fifteen-odd years.
When he almost misses a hard toss from Sam, Dean decides he needs a minute to gather his thoughts and calls for Milligan to take over the warmup. His brother furrows his brow in worry, but Dean shakes him off, claiming he needs to pee before the pregame starts in earnest.
Dean was a firm believer in learning by doing, so he shrugged and threw the ball back, not bothering to take any strength out of his throw. Sam caught the ball with a
Dean grunts as he scoots himself out from under Baby and gives his oily hands a perfunctory wipe on his jeans before typing out a response.
“That’s completely fair. But I’d bet that 90% of the journalists you interact with wouldn’t touch that sort of salacious gossip with a ten-foot pole.”
“You can tell me in the morning.” Dean switches off the light. “Thanks for, you know, takin’ care of me.”
“I completely understand that you’re gonna be pissed as hell at your little brother—and you have every right to be. He didn’t respect the boundaries you imposed in your own house, and he was a selfish asshole. But I also ain’t surprised that he didn’t suddenly turn into a different person when you told him the woman he’s seein’ might not be on the up and up. He is the same Sam Winchester that almost tore his dang shoulder off when he was 13 and determined to get his fastball over 75 miles per hour. That boy ain’t ever listened to either one of us.”
Cas takes a deep breath and sits up. “Dean, do not take your anger about this situation out on me,” he says, his voice shaking. “We were both targeted in this, and we are both subject to whatever repercussions there will be.”
“I know. I know I was horrible. It’s just, God, in that moment it felt like my worst fears had been realized, you know? The decision to come out was stolen away from me, and I’m still angry as hell about it. But that’s absolutely no excuse for saying that shit.”
Sam looks up and meets Dean’s eyes, surprised. He never gets anything except reassurance and, at most, some stern advice from Dean; the whole “tough love” tactic has never worked well with Sam, so Dean’s rarely employed a harsh word during an outing.
“I feel like, the entire time we’ve been dating, I’ve been waiting for something to ruin it all. Because I don’t get to have this, you know? Why would I, out of everyone in the world, be allowed to have someone like you in my life? So I was just sort of treading water, grateful for every second with you.
Dean’s anger rises to a boiling point. “Just shut up, OK? Just SHUT UP! You have no fucking clue what this is like for me! How fucking long I’ve spent pushing this shit down, and now you’re talking about it like it’s a goddamn walk in the park to admit to being into dudes
Cas raises his eyebrows, looking surprised. “Are you alright? You’ve never kissed me in public before.”
At first he finds himself miming the signs he’d give Ash from his position on the bench, but by the third inning Dean has settled down and accepted that he can’t psychically send Milly the pitching sequence he’d call for if he was behind the plate. And hey, so far the kid has done pretty well.
Dean feels like his heart is going to beat out his chest (he spares a split second to hate Benny for forcing him to watch You’ve Got Mail so many times that he thinks shit like, “my heart feels like it’s going to beat out of my chest”).  He cups Cas’ jaw and tilts his head up so that he can press a kiss to his lips.
Their clubhouse in Tempe is similar to the one in Anaheim, only slightly more cramped and without as many amenities: three walls are lined with cubby-hole style lockers with a folding chair in front of each and organized alphabetically.
When asked later to recount his memories of game six of the 2020 World Series, Dean will describe the adrenaline and elation of those final outs; he’ll wax poetic about his brother’s pitching performance and claim it solidified Sam winning his first Cy Young award; he’ll laud the collective effort of the entire team under the masterful leadership of Bobby Singer. He’ll characterize Mike’s three-run homerun in the eighth inning as nothing short of miraculous, and he’ll point out that Rami’s insane basket catch in deep left saved the game-tying run in the ninth.
His usual red polo has been switched out for a pink one as part of the MLB’s annual breast cancer awareness campaign, and Dean can’t tear his eyes away from Cas’ right bicep, where the soft color of the shirt is bringing out the golden tones of Cas’ skin and highlighting the dips and swells of muscle along his arm.
“And yeah, this is what I want. This is how I want to deal with this.” Dean looks at his phone once more. “We have like, three more minutes before we need to go back in. Wanna makeout?” He waggles his eyebrows at Cas.
“Your reputation as the next Ty Cobb is coming along nicely,” Cas remarks, watching as the intern struggles with the cords attached to the headset that Dean will wear to converse with the commentators who’re up in the press booth. “He looked ready for you to shake your fist at him and shout about how hoodlum kids need to get off your lawn.”
Dean can’t stop staring at Cas. Ostensibly, he’s listening to what the assistant in charge of the Derby is telling him and the other guys who are participating. In reality, his attention is focused near the on-deck circle at Dodger Stadium, where his boyfriend is standing and having a conversation with Ken Griffey, Jr. Dean knows he’s likely giving off stalker vibes but at this moment he just can’t be bothered to straighten up (ha) and close his mouth from where it’s hanging open.
As Dean begins to remove his batting gloves to give to the first base coach, Jesús, he notices that he has a scrape on his right wrist from the slide. “Shit,” he mutters, turning his arm awkwardly to assess the wound.
announcing our relationship, and I’m fine with us keeping this between a trusted few people for the time being. I understand the need for discretion, and I won’t force you to do anything you’re uncomfortable with. But you have to promise me that you’ll respect my own boundaries when it comes to my comfort. That you won't ask me to lie about my sexuality. When I came out, I promised myself that I would never go back into the closet and I’m unwilling to compromise on that.”
“Pleasure’s mine, Dean,” Ken bestows one of his signature, boyish smiles on Dean and grips his outstretched hand firmly in his own. “Congratulations on being selected for the Team again. What is this, your third year as an All Star?”
. But he feels like he’s ready to explode, so he tries to put all of his emotions (shame, anger, frustration, regret, more shame, more anger) into his workout.
“Any numbness or tingling anywhere? Do you feel disoriented, nauseated, or dizzy?” Cas shines a penlight into his left eye, and then the right.
“I could tell you were enjoying yourself. Has anyone ever told you that you have a very expressive face?”
“What’s so funny, doc?” Benny asks, walking up to them. They’re off to the side of home plate, away from the buzz of reporters and teammates.
Sam knows not to talk back to Bobby, but Dean can see his jaw clenching. Besides, once the manager’s out of the dugout, the call’s already been made.
“I didn’t know Sam was a Ru Paul fan!” Ash says excitedly, jumping up to strut down the dugout in time with the music. “Man, drag is an art form, you know? And Mama Ru is Michaelangelo.”
The best, though, the absolute best, is making Cas laugh. Dean honest-to-God thirsts for the wide, open smile that precedes a full Castiel Shurley belly laugh. His eyes crinkle shut and he throws his head back, baring the expanse of his pale neck and the chiseled jawline that’s perpetually darkened with stubble.
“I just want you to be honest with yourself.” Sam looks down at his coffee mug. “And with me,” he adds, quieter. “If you’re ready to be.”
Apparently able to pick up the awkward vibes Dean is throwing out, Cas moves off of the bed and pulls him into a hug.
“Well, then, you’d think he’d care that anyone could come walking into his home!” Dean replies. “Just wait until this is your house, too. Then I bet you won’t be so understanding when he leaves an open invitation for burglars.”
“I just thought that was as close as you were going to get to saying the words ‘this is the object of my affection, Doctor Castiel Shurley.’ You’re not exactly forthcoming with the emotional talk.”
It’s dark outside by the time Dean pulls himself off of his bed to go in search of food. He’s resolved to put this whole episode behind him. He needs to focus on the season, not some half-baked crush on an asshole doctor.
with nerves. He’s never been so close to this and it feels bigger than anything he’s dealt with before; he’s imagined and longed for this opportunity for as long as he can remember. He has to keep reminding himself to stay present as he plays catch with Sam in the pregame warmup, but his thoughts keep drifting to various
They’d decided to spend the night at their respective residences, Cas reasoning that he needed to pack and make sure his apartment was in an appropriate state to be left unoccupied for two weeks. Dean had agreed, knowing that it was the rational thing to do in the face of a road trip, but now, cozy as he is, he misses having Cas next him.
“I’m the best boyfriend ever, ‘cause I’m ready to go, so I’ll stop by Starbucks for us on the way to the stadium.” Dean grabs his phone from the nightstand. “Oh, wait, shit. That’ll look weird if I show up with a coffee for just you and me, right?”
“Look. I’m not ready to talk to him, let alone forgive him, yet. If you want, you can text him and tell him I’m alive and haven’t flown the coop. That’s about all I’m ready to do right now.”
When they’d begun exchanging fluids, and Dean had remarked that his level of preparedness took some of the sexy out of their sexytimes, he’d been treated to Cas’ TedTalk about safe sex practices. “I’ve been to medical school and I can tell you with certainty that the human body is a veritable germ factory. You know what’s not sexy? Going to the emergency room because your partner has fecal matter poisoning.” Then there was a PowerPoint which Cas had entitled, “Enemas
Twilight has taken hold and a soft golden light paints the western part of the field, reminding Dean suddenly of evenings spent playing catch with Sam in Bobby’s or Ellen’s front yard as the daylight waned. Nights just at the start of spring were his favorite, when the chilly air was tinged with barely enough warmth to tease promises of the coming baseball season. He and Sam would toss the ball back and forth until they couldn’t see their own hands in front of their faces, pretending they were in the final outs of game seven of the World Series and it was up to the two of them to make the play and get the win.
Arms: jelly. Legs: jelly. Back: sorta sore. Ass: will definitely be sore, but right now it’s just sorta tingly.
“I think you’ve tapped into a whole new fanbase,” Cas says. “And the MLB higher-ups would be idiots not to support you. The average baseball fan is a white man in his fifties—if they want the sport to survive, they’re going to have to attract new fans somehow.”
Ash walks up to Dean and pats him on the shoulder. “I’m feeling loose-y goose-y and ready to go, Winny. I gotta pee, you know how my nervous bladder is. Catch you in a few!”
