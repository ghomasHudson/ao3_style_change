Dean’s lied his way through his entire life. Sported fake ids and backstories, told teachers his bruises and scrapes were nothing but playground fights, told his brother their dad was coming back, told his Father that everything was fine. So when Castiel’s words taste almost truthful, Dean hums. The angel startles at the noise, looking between Dean’s eyes with raised eyebrows.
Together, they put the undergarments into the Target bag. Their fingers brush for an instant, making Dean jump like he stepped into a shower with the water too hot. Their eyes meet for the shortest of seconds, the air thick.
Since that night, four weeks ago, the fae shows up every Sunday. As soon as the fae enters, Dean can
Dean leans back, stretching out his legs underneath the table. He avoids touching the angel across from him, Castiel’s stiffness still throwing him off a little. He’s never met anyone so expressionless.
Cas turns his attention back to the young human still blatantly staring at him. Chuckling, Castiel stands and moves back into the threshold between the kitchen and living room. He spreads his wings out as far as he can, allowing Ben to see their large span.
Dean turns and shouts into the living room. “Ben, come set the table!”
“Cas, come on man… All that stuff… it’s not true. You aren’t expendable. I wouldn’t be standing here if it weren’t  for you savin’ my ass-”
Stroking his cheek, Castiel pulls back just enough to see his eyes. No one had ever given him a nickname before, not even his brethren. He repeats it in his mind over and over, lets the sound of it fill his grace. He presses his thumb into the man’s bottom lip, smiling. “Would you like to leave this establishment with me?”
Castiel touched his shoulder. He touched his
Dean laughs, raising an eyebrow while rubbing his free palm on his pants. He looks around the restaurant with a disbelieving smile. When he faces the angel again, the glow in his eyes appears solid as a setting sun. He reaches out to fix Castiel’s tie, tightening it and looking at the angel’s collar bone instead of his face.
Castiel slides further away from Lucifer’s grace, wary of being trapped in the same small space of such an angry and powerful being. He recalls something Jimmy said to the Winchesters, how he explained how it felt to be posessed by an angel.
“Do you need help with your wings. I’m sure you can’t reach everything yourself, and I’m pretty gentle with my hands.” Dean knows he’s teasing, but the twitch of Castiel’s lip and the hitch of his breath are worth it. Had Castiel really missed all the stares? All the pulses of longing Dean sent through prayer? All the steps into his personal space?
That’s how he finds himself at a bar called The Roadhouse. He tilts his head as he examines the sign just above the door. A couple of larger men saunter to the entrance, nodding respectively as they walk past. When they open the door, a swarm of sensations crash over him. One stands out the most: the smell and sound of fresh ground beef sizzling on the grill.
Dean sees his distorted reflection in the wood of the bar. A mother gone too soon, a brother too young to understand, and a father too angry to let go. His vision blurs, and he blinks away the heat he feels building in his temples. “She was.”
Castiel licks his lips, wings shifting their weight unconsciously. “My grace hasn’t fully regenerated. It takes time to restore, especially since I’m away from Heaven. It makes it easy to contain their visage.”
Their combined wings appear behind them, spread in challenge. Their shadows appear lighter than normal, like they almost took on a physical manifestation. Castiel may have no control his body, but his surge of power and grace gave Lucifer enough power to finish the incantation. There’s a blast of light. An explosion of shadows. One last scream. And it’s all gone.
Cas squeezes his eyes shut, running his hands through Dean’s hair gently. He can feel Lucifer’s grace reaching out, tendrils of anger and desperation trying to tear his apart. With a sigh, he pulls back, tracing his thumb over Dean’s jaw line.
“Well… thanks…?” He holds up the bag to make a point. Castiel smiles back, nodding. Dean continues, “You’re the first person I’ve told about this… It’s kind of a relief, knowing that someone knows and doesn’t judge me. Takes a load off, ya know?”
Dean nods, tilting his head so he can kiss Castiel again. “Are you propositioning me?”
Once sitting, Castiel takes a deep breath to calm himself. He looks down at his hands, then back at the human sitting next to him. Dean’s close, knee touching Cas’s own as he leans in to make sure the angel is okay. Cas licks his lips, a motion that makes Dean shift in his seat. “I apologize for my brief inebriation. Angel graces are very in tune with humanity’s faith in Heaven. I have never been close to a soul who feels that.”
“You should try it before you decide if you wanna ruin it with cream and sugar,” Dean says,
Castiel looks between the hand still resting on his shoulder and his charge’s face. There’s hope in Dean’s eyes. Faith. The sight of it makes Castiel’s grace preen, his wings straightening with his back. “You are right, Dean. Tomorrow will begin the search for your soulmate.”
Balthazar clears his throat, calling Castiel’s attention to him. “Dean called. Multiple times. He’s
The former angel moans at the feeling, using Dean’s come as lubricant as he jerks himself off faster. Sated, Dean lazily sucks on Castiel’s collarbone, hands squeezing Castiel’s hips. The gentle touches make Cas whine. He stutters out Dean’s name as he comes.
Dean shakes his head, hugging his binder for Calculus to his chest. He watches his feet walk across the linoleum tile, counting each step to tune out his friends comments. He’d been thinking about it all week. One thought plagues him though. Just because he compliments the freshman every day for a week doesn’t mean that he’d want to go to the dance with Dean.
of her corpse against the floor made him flinch. He can sense Crowley’s surprise, his fear, and the sadness that rises in him. The King of Hell stares at his mother’s body, then looks up at Lucifer. The Devil smiles, crossing his arms.
Dean’s arms wrap around his angel’s neck, holding him close while they rock together into Castiel’s loose fist. Dean’s fingers comb through Castiel’s growing curls. He smiles whenever Cas moans against his lips, their thrusts going from languid to erratic. The warmth, the panting, the inconsistent push and pull, the adoration that remains in Castiel’s gaze, it all pushes Dean closer and closer. Soon, he’s mumbling against Castiel’s cheek, hands shaking as they scratch at Castiel’s shoulders. Cas kisses Dean’s cheek, nips at the hunter’s earlobe. He whispers his own words of encouragement until Dean arches up into Castiel’s weight and comes.
Shaking his head, Benny looks at Dean, who still scans the courtyard.
Ash runs a hand over his already slick hair, laughing as well. “My name’s Ash. I’ll be your server for today. What can I get ya?”
The cupid leans against the counter, arms crossed over his chest as he examines his charge. He silently praises his Father’s work, finding new beauty in the human form. He looks down at his own hand, wiggling his own fingers to see the bones and veins crawl.
Lucifer sneers at both his brother and the human. He flicks his hand, sending Dean to the ground. He stands above him again, stepping on the human’s legs. The crack of bone makes Dean cry out and Cas flinch.
Benny raises an eyebrow but doesn’t press. The boys go back to discussing proper wooing techniques, Dean now actively paying attention. He still rakes the crowd for a strip of tan, or the flash of blue eyes, something to tell him that Castiel had made it to lunch today. An image of the boy’s expression yesterday appears in his mind, and he grins.
The tabby purrs, jumping from his perch to follow Castiel to the door. Checking the peephole first, Castiel’s eyes widen. A man, about his age with a slightly taller build, stands on the other side of the door. The stranger bounces on his toes, looking around at the other apartments. Despite the fish eye perspective, the stranger’s distorted features are attractive. Unlocking the door, Castiel opens it.
“Lisa left after we graduated, told me that she wasn’t going to be with someone who didn’t love her. I told her that I did love her, but she pointed at me and said I knew exactly what she meant. All throughout high school she knew something was off, that I stared at my best friend the wrong way. That I flirted with guys just as much as I did with girls. She held my face in her hands, and told me to stop holding myself back. After she left, I sorta lost it. I stopped showing up to work, starting drinking too much. I woke up in someone else’s bed every morning. Sometimes it was a chick, sometimes not. I went with the flow, tried to prove that even after I had sex with a guy I’d still be straight. I used every single person I slept with. I was fucked up back then.”
His voice rasps more than he’d like it to, his throat so dry the words almost crack. The stranger in his kitchen shakes his head slightly. Then, there’s a flash and Dean is suddenly surrounded by blue. Blue blue blue-
Half an hour passes, and Dean makes a sandwich to keep his hunger sated. He brushes his teeth to give him something to do. His reflection hasn’t changed in the two weeks he’s known Castiel. He knows that. Yet somehow, during the past week, he looked better. The lights don’t drain the color from his cheeks, his eyes don’t look sunken in. He shakes away the thoughts as he rinses his mouth out. He wipes his mouth dry with a towel when there’s a knock on his door.
Castiel isn’t sure if it’s the lighting in the Roadhouse, or if it’s the soft harmony of conversations and classic rock, but everything feels suspended. The bar turns into a surreal cliff face they both balance on, separated from everything around them. The air feels warmer, but cool at the same time. Like when the sun comes out while it’s still sprinkling. Everything stays balanced like that for minutes.
Castiel figures such a thought would be considered cliche, but as he chases his orgasm, he finds it prophetic.
Dean smiles at Castiel, knowing the angel won’t understand the term, and feels his heart rate slow. Castiel’s right. He can do this. He’s been around cars his entire life, knows his own better than he knows himself. And the angel’s blue eyes, staring at him with certainty and faith, settles him. It brings out his normal charming confidence. Castiel notices how the human calms and lets himself smile back.
Castiel’s eyes shine when they lock on Dean, pupils wider than Dean remembers. Considering that, another shock wave of warmth courses through Dean’s body. The man on the floor offers a smile, standing. “I’m well enough, thank you.”
“How are things going with Dean anyway?” he asks, leaning against the counter while he waits for the oven reach temperature.
Sighing after he drinks, Dean sets the glass back on the bar. His eyes close, jaw clenching. “My mom died when I was 4. My brother was 6 months old. House fire.”
Castiel pats his brother’s shoulder as he passes, padding softly to his bedroom. The mint walls soothe his thoughts as he settles onto his bed. As he sleeps, his grace supplies fuzzy image after fuzzy image of what he thinks Dean’s bond will look like.
Hazy from all the food and cider, Dean continues to stare at the angel next to him. An actual angel, in his front seat. When Dean doesn’t respond or start driving, Cas glances over at his charge. Castiel can see the strong line of Dean’s jaw with the man’s head tilted back, can trace the smooth line of Dean’s neck to his shoulders. But what makes his breath catch in his chest is
Before Dean can even process what the cupid’s words could possibly mean, his cell phone buzzes in his pocket. Dean frowns a little, digging it out. When Lisa’s name lights up his screen, Dean’s stomach drops. “Shit, Lisa’s here.”
Castiel starts to laugh as well, leaning forward while still holding a pair of panties.
Sam sighs and the sound of paper shuffling fills the background. Dean can imagine his brother sitting at a large mahogany desk, books stacked messily at the corners with essays on lore in literature scattered across the middle. “Aren’t you normally getting ready for Ben to come over around this time?”
The other man’s heart and lungs stop as soon as they spot the bow of Dean’s panties over the waistband of his blue jeans. The lines of ribbon forming the ass cage Castiel knows is there taunts him. Goosebumps rise on his skin as cold and heat crash down his body like buckets of water. He drowns in his next shaky breathes. Dean’s slightly flushed cheeks, the slight part of his lips, the crinkles next to his eyes as he stands to face Castiel again break the boundary of Castiel’s anxiety. The simple phrase fuck it races through his mind as he reaches for the slightly taller man.
Taking Castiel’s hand again, Dean leads the angel to the bed. They both get under the covers, facing each other. Something about this feels more intimate than the moment they shared in the kitchen. It feels more real. Because now Dean has someone in his bed he knows will be there every morning. It’s something neither angel or human expected, but are grateful for just the same.
“Oh…” Castiel murmurs, skin tingling when he realizes what Dean means. Lucifer watches the duo, tilting his head while Castiel stares at him. “Well, then you have very good taste, Dean.”
Balthazar leans back and stares up at the ceiling. He had considered sending a male cupid in place of a female one. Dean’s the flirtatious type, and he doesn’t want the human to lose track of what the cupid is there to do. Before he can agree to Gabriel’s proposition, the angel in question appears in the doorway of Balthazar’s office.
The girl nods and Ben acts as her voice. “She fell off the monkey bars. I thought maybe you could heal her or something. Angels can do that right?”
Castiel takes Dean’s other hand, eyes hooded as his wing leans into Dean’s gentle tracing of his feather pattern. “Very.”
Dean rubs his palms over Castiel’s chest, fingers spread, as he kisses Cas again. He slides his
Both angels nod, leaving Castiel to his thoughts. Cas stands, stretching out his arms above his head. Some of his bones crack from sitting in the same position for so long, a reminder that his body is very human despite his wings. Castiel’s reflection also stretches out his wings, and the cupid notices the bright red color of his shirt. The same Henley Dean had let him borrow a week ago.
The fae huffs and hunches over the bar, shaking his head. “Not tonight. I’m in no mood to play poker.”
Another, less logical part of Dean’s brain wants to believe the angel will stay despite Dean’s dumb actions. That would mean Cas continues searching for Dean’s soulmate. The thought makes Dean shift uncomfortably in his seat. He doesn’t want some stranger, someone that Castiel thinks may be suitable for him. He wants Cas. But finding his soulmate will help him forget the angel who made him rethink everything he thought he wanted in a partner.
Castiel pokes Dean’s chin before shifting to roll off the bed. He stretches when he stands, grinning down at his husband. “Sounds like a plan to me.”
Jo reappears with their drinks, placing the glasses onto the bar with a solid clack. Dean jumps a little at the sound, realizing how close he was to Castiel. Castiel only blinks in response, still staring at Dean as he tries to decipher the human’s tone.
Lucifer watches as well, eyebrows raised at his brother’s warmth toward the scene.
Angels never sleep. They can rest their minds, day dream all they wish, but shutting down the consciousness simply never was something angels felt necessary. Time, rest, necessity, all illusions. Man-made concepts that strayed away from true discipline, from the divine. The acts of eating, of showering, of sleeping, they all represented mortality.
Castiel looks back over at Dean, sharing his smile with the human. “Today does appear to be pleasant.” The angel stands, wings flapping slightly behind him. “You are in charge here, Dean. I will follow you whereever it is you wish to go.”
White flashes in Castiel’s grace and suddenly he’s surrounded by possible memories. Dean introducing himself to the woman, them exchanging numbers, Dean picking her up for their first date, them flirting all throughout the date, kissing in Dean’s car when he takes her home, her inviting him inside, Dean grinning and agreeing. Each moment has a tint of lavender to it, happiness and want mixing together well. The corners of Castiel’s lips turn up into a small smile as he stares at the woman.
Castiel nods, sitting up straighter when he faces Jo again. “I will take a cheeseburger with fries and a beer. Thank you.”
And Dean Winchester never backs down from a dare. If the people call, he answers.
“I dare you to go over and compliment him,” Crowley baits, knowing the infamous Dean Winchester would never let anyone make him look like a coward.
The guy clears his throat as he steps across the threshold, looking around as Castiel shuts the door. After closing the door, Castiel holds out his hand for the stranger to shake.
“Night, Cas.”
Castiel’s eyebrows furrow once again, an expression Dean decides is the only one the cupid is capable of, and tilts his head. “My name is Castiel. I recall sharing that with you upon my arrival.”
Ellen grins widely as she slams the money onto the counter and slides it to Dean. “Exactly, my love.”
Rubbing the back of his neck, Dean looks away again. “That’s kind of what I wanted to talk about… I think Amara is gone.”
Because he’s not the
Cas like Dean does.
Cas kisses Dean, swallowing the words. He wants to etch them into his grace, wear the words like a badge in front all of Heaven. He isn’t nothing. He’s Dean’s angel.
Dean and Lisa stand in the doorway. Castiel pulls his wings back, still smiling. His wings press closer to his shoulders when he notices Lisa and Dean staring at him as well, but Ben’s excitement soothes Castiel’s nerves.
With another nod, Dean turns on his heel into the back of house. He searches the stock for his best bottle of whiskey. The kind of stuff Bobby sings praises about while he goes over the edge with rot gut. The kind of stuff a man dreams about as he crosses the desert. The kind of stuff that swallows everything up in amber, making the world a honeyed place. When he finds it, he gently pulls it from its place on the shelf. He wipes the glass clean with his shirt sleeve. He’d been saving this for something big, some important night that he’d yet to come across.
Their gazes lock, Dean can’t ignore the shiver that runs through him. Sweat drips down the small of his back.
Dean smiles back at Jo, shrugging. “You know I can’t resist your girlish charms.”
Balthazar grins at his computer screen as he leans back in his desk chair. His wings flutter happily behind him as he reads over Dean Winchester’s information. The 37-year-old divorcee didn’t match their normal demographic, but this could be a good branch out for the company. They just have to find the right cupid and maybe he would be willing to make a testimonial.
When Castiel smiles, Dean can see the crinkle around the angel’s eyes and the exposure of his gums and the crinkle of his nose in his mind. He kisses Castiel’s chin and along his jaw as Castiel giggles. The angel’s hand slides up his bicep and into Dean’s hair. His fingers pull gently, carting through the blonde strands and leaving it all standing up. Dean sighs through his nose as he drags his lips over the spot under Castiel’s ear. Castiel rocks onto his toes with a soft sigh, holding Dean against his neck as the hunter thumbs over his hip bones.
A heavy silence envelopes both angel and hunter. It’s not cold, but warm with understanding and shared feelings. Dean hums, stretching his legs out under the blankets. As seconds pass by without another word spoken, Dean opens his eyes to see if Castiel is still there. Cas hangs his head, shoulders slumped as he stands at the foot of the bed. The hunter’s chest pangs, heart attempting to break out his ribcage.
Humming, Castiel moves his head back into a comfortable position. He listens to Dean’s heartbeat, counts each pulse as they both settle into their quiet euphoria.
Cas stands off Dean’s lap, taking the human’s hand to lead him to their shared bedroom. Dean keeps his gaze focused on Castiel’s as they fall into their bed. It’s an easy pattern now, all awkwardness gone.
………………………………
Dean pushes the door open, eyes immediately scanning the blank walls for the wings he just saw. They’re gone, as he guessed, ghosts lingering in his vision like sunspots. He forces himself to not frown in disappointment, especially when he finds that Castiel has wrapped a damp towel around his waist.  Castiel clears his throat when Dean doesn’t say anything after entering the room. The hunter leans against the lockers and stares at the angel.
Air gushes through the cab, bouncing around them in short bursts. Castiel takes a deep breath, closing his eyes and enjoying the feeling. Dean senses the lack of tension, and turns up the music with a grin.
“I know that you are sorry, Dean. And I want you to understand that I reacted that way due to my own fear. Not from disgust.”
Crossing his arms over his chest again, Dean frowns a little. “So I’ll have a cupid tailing me like a lost puppy as you use your soul searching powers on people?”
Castiel’s eyes open, his gaze focusing on Dean’s amused expression. The angel’s wings pull closer to his body, an action Dean figures is similar to an embarrassed blush. He lifts the burger up slightly to bring Dean’s attention to it. “This makes me very happy.”
Crowley rolls his eyes at Garth and Benny’s horrible romantic skills. “Listen boys, you have to woo her. Don’t just ask, mean it. Show her you mean it, either in your vocal inflection or which something simple like a flower.”
Lisa’s eyes widen. She glances at Dean as she takes Castiel’s hand, holding it lightly. Dean shrugs when he meets her awed stare. “Hello…”
Dean breaks the top of the crust, dipping the fork into the caramelized center. He scoops out a bite, smiling at how the crust flakes and how the filling oozes over the sides of the fork. Castiel leans forward on his swing, biting his bottom lip as he watches Dean take a bite.
Castiel sits back, hands resting in his lap as he stares into space for a moment. “We were created to care for our Father’s creation. The moment a prayer is fulfilled, that human’s gratitude and faith rush through an angel’s grace. It’s like no other high.”
Thunder clamors in the cab of the Impala, quaking in the earth under her tires. Dean scowls at the large cliff faces of clouds, at the large grey wall he’s racing towards. Castiel sits on the passenger side watching pine trees tilt with the force of the wind.
“Your parents must a been religious folks to name you after an angel,” the priest offers, dipping a fry in some ketchup before popping it into his mouth. Castiel follows the movement, lips parted slightly.
Castiel grins at both Ben and Anna, sensing their faith in him. It makes his grace rise up, thrumming like a plucked guitar string. He’d never been this close to blind trust, to pure hope. It’s intoxicating. His grace flashes in his irises and Ben gasps. Dean stares at his son, wondering what the boy saw in Castiel’s deep eyes. He takes a step forward.
“What should we do then?”
From the way Gabriel and Balthazar appeared on TV, Dean doesn’t expect the angel to be as uncaring or stiff as the one he barely remembers. He rubs his palms together, counting along with each tick of the clock. He then pours himself a glass of water, downing it easily.
Gabriel eats some leftover chocolate chips as he contemplates Castiel’s words. He looks closer, examining Cas’s grace. Excitement dances in bright orange swirls. Pink weaves it’s way through as well, hiding the yellow anxiety in the back of Castiel’s mind. Gabe tilts his head as a chocolate chip melts on his tongue. He hadn’t met this Dean character. But from the way Castiel described things in his reports of the case, Dean is a loyal type. The kind of person who would rather die than let the people he cares about suffer. That sincere devotion is something he shares with Castiel, something Gabriel hopes holds true.
“Dean,” Castiel simply says, staring at his charge with wide eyes. His wings stay still behind him as he tries to hide how Dean’s words affect him.
Dean shakes his head, glaring at the people around them as if they know Castiel’s position in Dean’s life. “Not Jo. She's basically my sister, man.”
In all honestly, Dean had pondered over the slight tingling sensation he gets in his gut when he looks at the guy.
“Can I help you with something, Dean. I was showering.” Castiel’s voice hints at a slight cut, at annoyance. It’s too watered down though, the angel unable to look directly at the hunter.
Stepping into the apartment, Cas holds out the bottle for Dean’s inspection. “I felt that I should thank you and your family for allowing me to join your festivities.” Cas’s eyes scan over the bottle before looking at Dean. His eyebrows are furrowed slightly, shoulders slumped. “I hope this isn’t out of line.”
“I can fly to your office if you prefer, Dean,” Castiel offers, looking up at the open sky. It’s a little cloudy, a cool breeze lazily pushing them across the horizon. Castiel stretches out his wings a little to feel the wind against his primary feathers. Meanwhile, Dean juggles his keys, and his coffee as he unlocks the car.
Castiel nods along until he hears the word “uniform”. He swallows, rubbing his hands on his dress slacks.
“Your vehicle has a gender?”
Concern mixes with amusement as Dean watches the angel’s normally stoic features continue to ooze a satisfied euphoria. The angel’s cheeks are slightly flushed, eyes still flashing with his grace. Dean grabs hold of Castiel’s elbow and leads him back to the bench, shooing Ben away by telling him to go play.
Ash laughs, walking to the window with the order. Awkwardness simmers in the air now, causing sweat to drip down the small of Castiel’s back. The priest huffs, a small burst of laughter that Castiel wants to hear over and over. Dean stares at his hands, turning them over so that they’re palm up. He traces the wrinkles of one of his palms, frowning at the deep creases and callouses. He examines his nails, rubbing the pad of his thumbs across the circular arcs.
Castiel shakes his head at the thought. He watches how the sunshine lights up the children’s hair, makes them look like angels. He enjoys the scents of fresh cut grass, the sound of games and mother’s voices. He smiles at the humanity.
Dean sighs, finishing off his fourth beer. The glass clicks against the coffee table top and he stares at the empty bottle until his eyes burn. When he finally blinks, his eyes stay closed for a while.
Silence envelops the two men as Dean pulls out undergarment after undergarment. He slowly folds pairs of boxers with Marvel character logos and plaid briefs. His hands jump over the lace and satin and flower patterns, mouth dry when he spots them. Castiel watches him, tilting his head when he notices Dean swallow over and over.
So he continues to sit on his bed, hands folded in his lap. He had enough thought to change from his suit and into his pajamas, the soft fabric lulling him further into his own internal rant. A knock echoes in his room and he slowly raises his eyes to his door like he hasn’t seen anything in years.
“Yes, thank you.” Castiel smiles back, quickly changing into the clean boxers with a relieved sigh. Dean’s eyes stay on Cas, teeth digging into his bottom lip as he watches the angel take off his pants. Cas looks down when he notices Dean’s stare, grace glowing with pride.
The motion of their bodies becomes a harmony. Their hips press together, each man exploring the other carefully. Despite the their constant movements, the insistent press of Castiel’s thigh against Dean’s crotch, both are hesitant as they touch each other. Both search for those places that make the other jump or gasp or shudder. Castiel chuckles when Dean jump in surprise as Cas squeezes his ass. Dean laughs breathlessly as well, noting how much he loves the other man’s laugh. Or just his voice.
Dean follows the lines of grain in the table as he gets lost in thought. Each dark brown path twists around the others, following a pattern Dean can’t figure out. The action keeps him busy as he waits.
“You’re very welcome, Dean,” Castiel says, heart skipping a beat when he notices green eyes drop to his mouth.
“You looking for something, brother?”
The man pushes his empty plate forward and works on finishing his coffee. A glance at his watch makes him sigh. He looks up at the cupid, the smallest of smiles decorating his lips. The soft expression causes Castiel to blink. His pulse jumps from what he assumes is the caffeine.
The sultry voices of the doctors and nurses fill his small living room and it immediately starts to calm his mind. Work kept him in a constant buzz, mind always on alert. Always be on his toes, that’s what his father and his short stint in the Marines taught him. He’d given the core 4 years of his life, 4 years he won’t get back. But they paid for college. He never was good at school like his kid brother, didn’t land any of those fancy scholarships. All he had going for him was his strength in wrestling and knowledge of car mechanics.
Dean snaps his gaze from the messy hair across his bar to his surrogate father before him.
Terms:
Dean, on the other hand, finds the way Castiel moves away, then closer, when Dean digs his fingernails into his thighs. Or how he moans when Dean pulls on his hair. The power he has over Castiel rivals the other man’s hold on him. They go back and forth, playing each other’s weak spots until both are panting messes leaning against the door to keep them up.
Dean looks down at his phone screen, wondering if such a thing would be worth looking into. He had jumped into hotter fires with a lot less to go on, but this feels more important somehow. This is the promise of something real. Not drunken one night stands or the desperate makeup sessions with Lisa, but something good. The person he’s meant to be with.
Castiel freezes, blushing as the mental image fills his mind. Dean continues to pet the tabby, unaware that Castiel stares at the waistband of the man’s worn Levis. Lucifer’s gold eyes flash at Castiel in such a way it looked like he winked. Castiel scowls at the cat and shakes his head to clear it. He moves towards the cupboard where the grocery bag hangs from the white handle.
“This… is amazing, Dean.” Castiel’s voice is a soft sigh, lips turned up into a small smile.
Castiel’s cheeks flush, but he smirks as he stares at Dean. His grace tingles, body aching to touch more of Dean, to never let him go again. “I believe so, yes.”
His hands find their places on instinct, pressing fingers into Dean’s exposed hips. Castiel smiles against Dean’s lips, leaning his head back as the man kissing down his neck. Whenever Dean rocks forward, Castiel rocks upward to meet him, suddenly glad he chose to wear sweatpants. He moans into Dean’s mouth, heat hovering off his skin when Dean moans in response. Dean presses closer, chest to chest with the man underneath him. The front of his panties is damp, almost enough to stain Castiel’s sweatpants as he pushes down harder with a whimper. Castiel slides his hands over the curve of Dean’s ass, pulling him even closer.
Ash clears his throat, looking between the two men with a smile. Both jump back, blushing simultaneously.  He takes Dean’s and Castiel’s plates, trying to hold back laughter. “Can I get you anything else, Father?”
“What are ya doing for Thanksgiving, Cas?” he asks, taking a sip of his iced tea.
Dean Winchester. Because he’s
+          +          +          +
Dean pushes off the counter and goes to the fridge for something to do. He pulls out a beer, holding one out for Castiel. Castiel declines with a shake of his head, shifting his weight once more. Opening the can and taking a swig gives Dean a moment to collect his thoughts.
Clearing his throat, Dean straightens. “Lemme get that ready for ya. Enjoy yer whiskey. Don’t let my waitress bother ya too much. She can lock ya down in a conversation, if yer not quick.”
Dean turns the radio off when the pinpricks chink against Baby’s frame. The water swirls on the windshield, a calming sight compared to the violent tremble of the air. Dean sighs, listening to the drum solo the clouds make paired with the piano melody of the rain. It’s god’s rock n roll. A concert for the human race, a chance to see the flashing lights of his power.
Cutting a generous slice of pie fills the silence between them for a moment before Benny scoffs. Dean chooses to ignore it, plating the pie and grabbing a clean fork. He strides past his best friend and places the plate before the fae. The whiskey bottle clacks back onto the bar top. Dean watches the contents splash. Halfway gone.
Garth rolls his eyes, taking a huge bite from his own sandwich before speaking. “Just ‘oll with it ‘enny.”
Bobby silently stands from one of the poker tables, wearing a scowl. He stops up to the bar, groaning as he leans against the cedar. He sits on a stool and glares from under his hat at Dean’s welcoming grin. “Don’t look so pleased with yerself, boy. Just pour my drink and let an old man be.”
“You asked for the best,” Dean teases, smiling softly.
Garth snorts, poking Benny in the shoulder. “Since he got a girlfriend, remember?”
Dean presses his lips into a thin as he listens to the angel. He nods along, trying to wrap his mind around the face angels can sense human emotion all on their own. Looking out at the playground, Dean nods to himself. “Sounds like a powerful feeling.”
“Fierce. All sharp angles and hard eyes. Ya look like you could kill someone even though you're wearing princess pink.”
“Yeah, Cas suits you better,” the man says, eyes focused on Castiel’s. When Castiel doesn’t turn from the gaze, Dean finds that he can’t look away. Instead, he notices the darker flecks of blue that adds another layer to the color. He blinks and goes about memorizing the power and softness he sees there.
Dean snorts and Castiel beams up at him. Ben looks over Castiel’s shoulders, eyes still wide as he steps into the apartment with his overnight bag.
At lunch, Garth, Benny and Crowley push Dean away from their table. They shoo him like a pigeon, snickering and whispering among themselves.
Dean shakes his head, patting Castiel’s cheek as he continues to laugh. “I haven’t come with my clothes still on since I was a teenager.”
Dean blinks rapidly, lips parted as he takes in the angel’s expression. His cheeks heat up slightly as he looks at anything but Castiel. “Sorry, I give people nicknames. I can stop if ya want.”
……………………………………….
Lucifer sometimes sits on the fabric like it’s a Gain scented throne. Other times he carries his prize between his teeth, delivering it directly to Castiel when he comes through the door. Either way, he watches curiously as Castiel picks it up and adds it to the bag of stolen underwear. The styles range from women’s lace panties, the kind from Victoria’s Secret, to the simplest of boxers. As the number grows, Castiel tries to figure out how to get the garments to their rightful owners.
Before the angel can even feel dejected by Dean shoving him away, the hunter is tugging his shirt over his head. Castiel’s wings tremble, arching higher. The feathers brush together in a soft whisper, a sound that amuses Dean. He kicks off his boxers before stepping back into the angel’s space. He grips Castiel’s hips and walks them back into the showers. Castiel drops his towel, almost tripping over it when Dean keeps moving him backward. Dean raises an eyebrow, inspiring Castiel to use his grace to turn them all back on. The pressure of the water against his alert wings sends a shockwave of want through him. He groans, eyes half closing.
“She’s gone…” Dean whispers back, voice hoarse. He drinks from the faucet as his brother steps forward and raises an eyebrow.
The angel settles in the passenger seat, immediately rolling down the window after Dean starts the car. Dean glances at Castiel, feeling a little guilty for forcing him to take the human route. He knows it’s selfish, but he doesn’t want the awkward cupid sitting in his office alone until Dean arrives. And if he’s being honest with himself, he could use Castiel’s company to help him unwind. Something about the angel’s naivety and dry humor comforts the man in a way he really needs at the moment.
No light shines on him as he lies there, thinking about the entire day. About the banshee, about Mildred’s advice, about Sam’s confession, about his confession to Cas. About Cas.
Castiel lightly puts his glass down so it doesn't make a sound. He doesn't want to startle Dean into closing up again.
The hunter huffs, poking Castiel’s side. “Get the stick out of your ass. You can’t relax if you’re not comfortable.”
“It isn’t a problem, Gabriel. Dean is very amicable. We’ve had many conversations over lunch every day. Our outings allow me to continue my work while we share each other’s company.”
“Does the color not suit me?”
The man’s voice crackles, a sound shattered by self-deprecation and bitterness. Placing a hand over the priest’s, Castiel bites his tongue to fight the urge to stroke his knuckles. Instead he stares at the man, pursing his lips before he speaks.
Castiel’s wings settle, but the feathers right out of his back are still slightly ruffled. The angel squints at his charge, aware that Dean is lying and unwilling to share his thoughts. But Dean smiles as he leads Castiel to the entrance of the Roadhouse, and Castiel decides to set aside his curiosity in favor for examining their surroundings.
Pain erupts in their head when Dean’s fist hits the side of Lucifer’s jaw. Cas’s grace roars with happiness, repeating the hunter’s name like a mantra. “Bullshit!”
He forces himself to get up, peeling off the damp clothes and taking a warm shower. He tries scrub away the memory, skin red and sensitive when he gets out of the shower. Once clean and dressed, Dean glares at the mess he’d left in his living room. Something in his gut tells him Castiel won’t be stopping by any time soon. So to fight off the weight that seems to be resting on his shoulders, he focuses on cleaning every inch of his apartment for the rest of the weekend.
Growing up, all children of Ouroboros learn that a fae’s presence causes a chemical reaction similar to drinking. Some people grow drunk quickly, world blurring and spinning except the sight of too bright eyes and too many teeth. Some can sip and remain unaffected. Dean prides himself on being the latter, but
Dean spins his bottle in a slow circle, glancing at the angel from the shadows over his eyes. “That a bad thing?”
When the fae smiles this time, it exposes his teeth. The canines look sharper, hinting at the power lurking under the façade. Dean’s mouth goes dry, and he offers a small smile of his own.
He stumbles back to his bedroom eventually, eyes half-lidded and feet shuffling heavily.
With a snort, Dean goes back to preparing drinks just to have something to do with his hands. “Nobody ever leaves Ouroboros, Ellen. ’N you know it.”
Dean feels how Castiel arches his body taut. Dean blindly buries his hand in Castiel’s feathers, massaging the muscles and stroking the feathers as he guides them through the motions. His voice drips between them like honey. “It’s okay, Cas. I got ya. Yer perfect. Shit, baby. Wanna see how yer wings shake when ya come all over us.”
Castiel’s eyebrows furrow, lips pursed in what Dean can only comprehend as an angry, self-righteous pout. “You shouldn’t assume such things, Dean. People will think you’re taking advantage of them.”
Why does he get to continue living? When he is full of so much fear and guilt and self-loathing? How is he worthy of God’s mercy?
“Wicked,” the boy mumbles, stepping closer to examine Castiel’s secondary flight feathers. Ben’s awe-struck eyes and wide smile make Castiel grin. He flaps his wings slightly, showing off the power in the muscles underneath the pretty feathers. Ben jumps back and laughs out loud.
Castiel does that small frown again, and this time Dean catches it. The human adds it to his growing list of expressions as the cupid.
His body, which once belonged to a human, erupts from the inside out. His grace pours out like lava, burning the air, his skin, everything. But Dean… his charge, is safe. The Winchesters, the world, His Father’s creation.
Noticing the brightness of Castiel’s eyes, Dean’s heart drops and all blood leaves his head. When Castiel starts to close the distance between them, Dean grins and accepts the embrace. Pale hands scrabble shirt, yanking him into a kiss.
“Only 1,500 customers? That number seems a little low considering most everyone wants to find true love.”
This Sunday, heat coils like an angry snake in the Devil’s Backbone, but folks still laze about. Garth plays a slow tune on the piano, filling the air with bloated notes. Dean works in the back with Benny rolling dough to make pie crust while Charlie tends to the bar. Dean hears the front door swing open and
Castiel nods, unfolding his hands and placing his palms flat against the table surface. “You are experienced with sex, but have recently been divorced and have a son. You want someone who will respect your relationship with your ex-wife and son, someone who will take care of him as you do. This respect and affection must also be extended for the brother you spoke highly of. This calls, statistically, for someone your age. Someone experienced enough to understand how to reciprocate such mature feelings. You are also a veteran, meaning your partner will also have to be understanding of your previous lifestyle despite the fact you now work elsewhere. Does my analysis satisfy you?”
……………………………
Cas never closes the distance between them. The angel glares at him for what feels like hours before pulling away. Turning on his heel, Cas starts walking away. All Dean can see in the darkness that now shrouds his apartment is those wings glowing pale blue. Dean scrambles to dislodge himself from his chair and chase after Castiel. He starts running into what looks like a railroad tunnel, black surrounding him on all sides. He calls Castiel’s name over and over, but he can't hear his own voice. The only thing in that tunnel is the glowing of Castiel’s wings, which go farther and farther ahead no matter how fast Dean runs. Soon, the glow gets swallowed by the shadows and the man is by himself.
This, the conversation, the flirting, the lust-filled gazes, the licking of lips, the brief touches, it all leads to her in his car. She’s following him to his apartment, complimenting him on the clean furniture, letting him slowly unzip the back of her dress. Then she’s lying on his freshly washed sheets, arms sprawled above her head, staring up at him with bedroom eyes.
Dean taps his fingers on the bar when Castiel doesn't say anything to fill the silence. It feels typical for the stoic angel, but there's something off about Castiel. His back is straight, feathers rustling slightly. His gaze isn’t focused on anything around them. Dean thinks he sees a flash of blue crackle across the feathers and realization makes Dean blush.
“You will do well, Dean,” Castiel says, voice soft. “They would not have asked you to do this if they did not have faith in your abilities. Believe in yourself.”
Castiel wears a white button up tucked into a pair of dress pants. Over the shirt, he wears a tailored suit jacket with a tie the same color as his eyes. Gabriel looks his brother up and down, whistling.
“Something ya wanna talk about?” the man asks.
That one moment of connection, their shared breath, how the hunter gasps, all of it, makes Cas’s grace brighten even more. Gives him the strength to do what he knows needs to be done.
“I know, Sammy,” Dean says right before the moment is crashed by Ellen and Jo appearing in the dining room. Ellen starts handing the boys pans and bowls full of food, rubbing her palms together as she looks over her hard work.
The man stops, quickly dropping his hand and shoving it into his pocket. Castiel tilts his head, putting his glass down on the table and reaching for Dean’s shoulder. His grace warms when he notices how perfectly his palm fits around the curve of his shoulder blade. “I did not mean to offend you. I apologize for my forwardness.”
Cas tries to open his mouth to interject, to present one of the many arguments he’d created in his mind over the weekend. Holding up a single finger, Gabriel cuts his brother short. “No, listen, Castiel. You should check the bond. Angel grace is similar to the human soul, it’s possible.”
“Hello, Sam. I’m Castiel, a friend of Dean’s.” The cupid withholds his actual title, unsure if Dean wants his family to know why Cas actually entered Dean’s life. When he glances over at Dean, the human smiles as if pleased by the words. Castiel finds himself smiling back even while he holds Sam’s hand.
Just as he’s about to scream for the angel to come back, Dean shoots up in the recliner. His sweatshirt sticks to his back and arm pits. His chest heaves, heart banging against his ribs. It’s light in his apartment, and a glance at his watch tells him it’s almost noon. Luckily, he has today off, it being the day after Thanksgiving.
Dean grins at the older woman. The fond scolding tone of her voice makes him feel at home. He definitely needed this. “I’ve been working, Ellen. I’m up for review in a couple weeks. Big promotion, ya know?”
“Never gonna let ya leave again. Stay. Please. Cas, please. Want you to stay.”
“Yer welcome, James. Any time.”
Dean takes a bite of his pie, eyes closing as he sighs in contentment. The look of blissful satisfaction on the man’s face contrasts drastically with the empathy bubbling in the back of Castiel’s throat. He finds himself in a battle of emotion, caught up in how Dean looks while eating pie versus how he feels about their topic of conversation. Unsure of what to do, Castiel waits for Dean to open his eyes, nodding for him to continue.
“You too.” She looks the angel up and down with a raised eyebrow. “I’m gonna get your drinks.”
“I always do.”
He never thought anything of washing these more personal garments in the public laundry mat. His fellow classmates thought of them as trophies, leftovers from his post-party escapades. When he noticed his stash of panties dwindling, he wondered if he’d left them lying around. He tore his room apart, more anxious about the pinks and purples than the Batman and Captain America symbols. When he found Castiel’s flyer in the laundry mat, he’d thought for hours about whether or not he should see if any of it belongs to him. It had taken him years to build up his supply, only buying the panties during holidays to pass them off as gifts. So he’d swallowed his dignity and took the short trip to Castiel’s apartment.
Castiel starts to laugh, grace buzzing under his skin. The way Castiel’s skin crinkles around his eyes makes Dean want to smile despite his confusion.
“Cas… I don’t know why you chose this-”
“Do you want to tell us what happened?” Gabriel asks, putting a hand on Castiel’s knee.
Every time he notices the weight of his cell phone in his pocket, he checks to see if he has any
Dean crouches a little as he stalks over to the wall between the living room and the kitchen. Back pressed up against the smooth surface, Dean takes a steadying breath. When he shuffles into the kitchen, choosing to keep the light off for now, Dean freezes in surprise. He takes in the silhouette of a man leaning against his kitchen counter. Dean can’t see the man’s face, can only smell something Dean’s mind struggles to put a name too. The man’s a couple inches shorter than Dean, but his messy hair gives him some height. The slope of his shoulders gives away his slender build under his bulky clothes. The man tilts his head as Dean tentatively steps forward.
Castiel swallows and wipes some sour cream from his mouth with a napkin. “Angels do not celebrate human holidays. So I will probably spend the day reading.”
“I don’t have a problem with her finding someone new. She deserves a good relationship. I just don’t wanna miss out on time with Ben, ya know? What if he likes this guy more than me?”
“You're spending too much time with Charlie!” he calls after her. He takes a bite of his burger, smirking at her mumbled "fight me, Dean."
Jo walks around the table and puts a hand on Dean’s cheek. At first, she doesn’t say a word, only offers him a small smile. Then she finally whispers, “I’m glad you wanna find someone, Dean.”
The fantasy slips away like a curtain, leaving the scene cold and sharp. Castiel’s feelings for Rowena never were good, and he hardly enjoyed Crowley’s presence. But the quiet
Dean chuckles, imagining bitch face 34 on Sam’s face. “Just thought I’d check up on ya.”
Nodding his head, Dean burrows under his covers and yawns.
“Those are to pair you with an appropriate cupid and for said cupid to learn some basic knowledge of their charge. By knowing your answers, Dean, I know where to start with my search.”
After a minute of unwavering staring, Dean looks out at the rest of the bar. “Ya know, Cas, flattery will get you everywhere.”
Dean’s eyes shimmer under the street lights as he guides Castiel to his car. It lounges in the far corner of the lot, black paint mirroring the horizon dusted with dusk’s colors.  The angel typically avoids automobiles, finding the confines of the frame and slow pace nauseating. Now, he just lets the priest lead. Castiel dug Dean from the ashes of his own fears, clutches onto the sparks in the priest’s hands. When Dean pushes him against the car’s cool exterior, he breathes life into the fire.
Dean clears his throat. “You’re doing great, Cas. Stop worrying.”
Elbow resting on the bar, Dean spins the metal between his fingers. Castiel watches the flashes, eyes caught on a streak of white. The angel gapes at the clerical collar, thoughts blank despite the buzz of his brothers’ voices in the back of his mind.
The other man contemplates his reflection in Castiel’s bathroom. Dean’s jeans sit on the floor in a wrinkled pile, his boots kicked off next to them. He twists in front of the small mirror above the sink, backed up against the wall to get the best view. The ass cage plunges half way down, allowing a wide angled view of his backside. The satin feels cold on his dick despite the heat radiating off his skin. Dean bites his bottom lip, the thought of Castiel trailing his hands over his skin making the heat pulse in time with his rushed heartbeat.
Dean blushes slightly at Cas’s words. Ben blinks at Castiel as he shakes the cupid’s hand. “You’re an angel, aren’t you. That’s why you have wings.”
Castiel’s grace sparks, a small fire of hope and praise as words fill their mind. Castiel curls into a ball, holding his legs tight to his chest as to not let the feeling escape. Longing, fear, hope, excitement, all wrapped in a warmth similar to honey. Dean’s prayer makes him shudder and smile despite his brother’s obvious confusion and irritation.
He pulls on a pair of fleece sweatpants and a loose cotton t-shirt before heading out into the kitchen where Gabriel is surely waiting for him. Sure enough, the older angel sits at the breakfast bar eating a bowl of Fruit Loops drizzled with chocolate syrup. Castiel’s nose scrunches up at the sight of the sweet concoction. He stands on the other side of the counter and starts to sort through their combined mail.
Dean sighs. “I’ll keep an eye on him, keep him outta trouble.”
“Quit teasin, Cas,” Dean mumbles, pulling the angel closer. Castiel laughs to himself before kissing the juncture of Dean’s neck and shoulder.
Her voice cuts off as Lucifer leads their hands to grip her throat, to squeeze the air from her, to forbid her from making their biggest fears becoming reality. Lucifer gawks at his brother’s grace, at the spectrum of colors. He shakes his head at the contact between their graces and pushes his power with Castiel’s through their hands.
He watches his own body step forward as well, his voice low as his body follows to Lucifer’s commands. “Hello, Dean.”
The lack of success doesn’t bother Castiel as they enter Dean’s office. Instead, the angel focuses on inspecting the human’s work space. The mahogany desk is large and takes up a lot of space in the center of the room. A bookshelf adorns the left wall, burdened with multiple volumes of car manuals and encyclopedias of car designs. Beside those books are a couple of photographs. Castiel stares at one that must have been taken recently, Dean with his arms wrapped around the shoulders of Jo and a taller man with shaggy hair Castiel assumes is Sam. The angel finds himself smiling at the their frozen grins.
More memories appear in their mind, but only Cas really pays attention to it. Dean, kneeling on the ground, begging him to snap out of it. He let Cas beat him, punch him over and over and over until he couldn’t feel pain anymore. And he sat there, looked up at Cas and said, “I need you.” Cas may have said he didn’t know how the spell was broken, but deep down, he always did. Dean Winchester. His charge. His Righteous Man. The person he has fought and rebelled and died for.
Dean Winchester sits in his usual spot in the back corner of the courtyard, a half empty bottle of Mountain Dew and a sandwich wrapper on the table in front of him. He wipes the crumbs off his hands over the ground, looking around the open space at his peers. The weather had warmed up since the week before, leveling out at a breezy 75 degrees. Dean rolls up the sleeves of his red and black flannel, sitting up when the sun kisses his skin. He sits alone, flashing a charming smile as people pass.
Castiel stammers for a few seconds, pointing down the hall. “First door on the left.”
What used to be late nights hustling pool and drinking is now working in an office twice the size of his bedroom, having a paycheck with more than one zero tacked on the end and having partial custody of his 8-year-old son. And, surprisingly, he’s okay with it. The life he was living before, it was even lonelier than the one he lives now. At least he has a nice place to go home to, at least his brother is as successful as he is, at least he has a son that he can still see.
He hasn’t touched another body like that since Hannah kissed him. This is not what Castiel imagined when he thought of his next embrace, his next physical interaction with someone. He shudders, turning away from the scene.
Benny grimaces, shaking his head. “I’ll go with it when they serve real food.”
Rather than comment on their quarrel, Dean busies himself pouring out the drinks for Ellen’s poker table. He fills them to the brim out of sympathy, glad he was only ever on the same side of the poker table with Ellen. The door to the Devil’s Backbone opens as he stacks the glasses onto a tray for Charlie to hand out. He glances up with a customary greeting, to find the words caught in his throat.
Cas looks up, eyes stinging at he watches himself gently touch Dean’s nose. He can feel the warmth of the hunter’s skin, sense his shock at such an intimate touch. Dean gasps, tilting his head up. His breath is warm and he smells of
Castiel shrugs as he puts his mail into a separate pile, then proceeds to sort through that. He puts junk mail in one stack, bills in another. “My charge required my presence for an extended period of time.”
Dean swallows, shaking away the feeling and pouring out the amount. The stranger looks Dean up and down. Every hair on Dean’s body rises, a shiver crawling across his back. Definitely a fae.
Shoving the human away, Lucifer kicks him in the chest. Each word sounds disgusting in his mouth, and Cas pulls away from his brother’s anger and disgust. He holds his chest, pining to help his charge as he pants and coughs on the floor. “He’s weak, just like you humans.”
Castiel squints at his charge, making the blue of his irises look sharper. “I assume you would be more comfortable if I broke bread with you during our outing.”
He’s just your pet angel. Isn’t that right?”
Gabriel eats a couple more bites, eyebrows furrowed as he thinks. His wings flap lightly behind him. “I’m asking as your brother and employer. This is your first client after all. Balthazar and I are gonna check on ya anyway. You might as well spill some of the beans now. In confidence, of course.”
His vessel’s mouth starts to water and he smiles. Knowing human social standards, he made sure to include a replica of a wallet in the left pocket of his coat. He touches the warm leather with his soft fingers, glad he remembered to carry at least 20 dollars in cash.
As soon as Dean hears the Castiel’s stuttered breath, Dean’s fingertips tingle. Dean gently pinches the cupid’s chin, thumb sitting under Cas’s bottom lip. He holds Cas there during the few seconds it takes him to brush his lips against Castiel’s. Castiel freezes immediately, wings shuddering with a sound like a waterfall as Dean kisses him.
“Light or dark tonight, Dean?”
“Why?” Castiel asks, staring into Dean’s eyes. The gaze is intense, and makes Dean’s skin prickle a little. It feels like Castiel is staring straight through him, like his every thought and memory and atom are exposed for the angel’s inspection. Despite being fully dressed, Dean suddenly feels naked.
Dean blinks, holding Castiel’s hand for a second longer than what seemed normal. After the pause, the man shakes his head and let’s go. Castiel tilts his head in question.
Dean swallows, shaking his head and looking away when the angel finishes talking. It takes him a minute before he can look up at Castiel again without the threat of blushing. The silence around them isn’t uncomfortable. With Cas, it’s always comforting.The angel is just as content sitting next to Dean as he is having a conversation. And for that, Dean is grateful.
Dean smiles at him from the end of the long conference table, nodding his understanding. As he goes back to work turning on the laptop and plugging in his flash drive, Castiel makes himself invisible once more. It’s odd to be able to watch everything around him without fear of someone finding him out. It allows him actually observe humanity as it passes around him. He watches Dean work, fingers typing surely on the laptop. The projector whirs to life, blue spilling out onto the the wall next to the Dean. The human sticks out his tongue slightly as he works, drawing Castiel’s attention to Dean’s lips. He shifts on his feet, crossing his arms as his cheeks heat up. He counts the freckles along Dean’s cheek bones to pass the time.
He leans against the doorframe, skin still damp from the steam. Lucifer purrs and rubs against his legs, gold eyes flashing as he looks up at the man. Castiel smiles down at the cat. “Hello, Luci.”
Dean’s brain finally catches up with him and he starts to hear what the men are talking about with the hoss. The smaller man offers a sleazy grin, leaning forward as if he’s about to share a secret with the woman.
The engine rumbles, the car’s body humming around them as Dean drives out of the parking lot. The silence makes Castiel shift in his spot, wings puffing up once again as he looks at Dean’s smile.
Dean laughs harder at that, his body curving upward against Castiel. He kisses the angel’s forehead. “Ya know, ‘an angel and a priest walk into a bar?’ That kinda joke.”
This time, he goes with the urge to put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. Before Dean really knows
Castiel nods against Dean’s chest, moving his hands so they can rest on the priest’s shoulders. He clenches his eyes shut, prepares himself to teleport away from the man, to erase Dean’s memories of him. Castiel isn’t sure why he didn’t question his motives earlier, why he didn’t think about how his grace would react to sex. He just hopes that he can leave Dean with the feeling of satisfaction, the feeling that he doesn’t have to hide who he is from himself.
“Two coffees would be great. And I’ll take an omelet with american cheese, spinach, ham and tomato.” Dean holds out his and Castiel’s menu as he talks.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel responds. He tries to not look directly into Dean’s eyes. Focusing instead on the spot between the human’s eyebrows. Dean sighing his name sends a shiver through his grace. He’d hurt Dean. Facing that fact proves harder than the cupid anticipated. “May I come in?”
And Lucifer snaps the hunter’s neck.
Dean freezes in Castiel’s arms. His breath stops for a second, as does his heart. His neck heats up, and he pulls back enough to see his best friend’s face. The other boy stares at him, blue eyes wide with regret. As Castiel stammers out an apology, Dean holds his face and kisses him.
Dean straightens, rubbing his neck and staring at his forearm. “Amara… she’s gone… I can feel it.”
As he speaks, Castiel keeps his hands folded on top of the table. The cupid’s voice is even, a comfort to Dean. The angel notices that Dean shifts a little in his own seat, often glancing around them as he takes in the new information. Dean takes another swig of his beer, nodding along.
Castiel doesn’t notice Dean walking towards him until he is a few feet away. The boy looks up from his lunch, tilting his head slightly in question. Dean blushes, pushing aside the thought that the freshman’s cute when he does that. He clears his throat and stands up straight.
As power surges through his veins, his heart beat quickens. Fear, regret, guilt, helplessness, and hope flow through his grace in the instant just before his brother takes charge of his body.
“I saw them on some talk show. That’s what gave me the idea to send in a request.” Dean looks between both Castiel’s eyes. The words I’m sure glad I did rest on Dean’s tongue, and he washes them down with his coffee. “They looked like they get along well.”
Suited: when the cards have the same suit.
to you, but to him, you are
“Dean,” he gasps out, hands scrambling against the human. He grips Dean’s shoulder, squeezing so hard it’s sure to leave a handprint shaped bruise as he drags Dean’s weight against him. Dean groans from both pleasure and pain, eyes drooping closed as his own climax builds.
Following custom, Castiel steps forward and extends his hand towards Lisa. “Hello, Lisa”
Dean unlocks the door without looking up. The words rush through his mind, makes his throat feel tight. He forces himself to smile as he gets in the car. “I know. It’s just hard not to worry, ya know?”
Ellen leans over the wooden bar, putting a hand on top of Dean’s. “We’re proud of you, son.”
The angel stands taller, arms straight by his sides. Vivid blue eyes lock onto Dean’s facial expression, eyebrows furrowed as if Dean’s smile isn’t what he expected. Dean’s heart thuds at the heavy gaze. The blue is bright enough to feature in a cheesy romance novel, bright enough to remind Dean of the dream he’d had the night before. Bright enough to throw him for a loop when the angel starts to speak. “Hello, Dean. My name is Castiel. I believe you requested a cupid this morning.”
Dean puts more pie on the spoon and holds it out again. This time, the baby eagerly reaches out for the food. Her happy bounces make Dean chuckle.
Dean follows his gaze across the courtyard, searching for the boy’s tan trench coat and dress slacks despite the fact Crowley stated he’s wearing something different. Not too far away from their table, the boy sits on the brick wall lining the courtyard, legs crossed underneath him. Dean’s breath hitches for a second, a small noise no one else at the table heard.
Sitting down at his laptop, Castiel starts brainstorming for a flyer he can hang up in the laundry mat. Only west wing dormitories use the laundry mat he goes to, so he hopes that by posting the flyer there, he can return some of the stolen objects.
Dean glares at his friends, then glances back at Castiel. He doesn’t know much about the boy. He’s a freshman, is an editor for the paper, is his class’s vice president, and gets straight A’s. Dean heard from his friend Charlie that Castiel did well in math, but killed in English. And he always looks like a professor from Harvard or something.
The sound of the words ring in Castiel’s grace, makes him shudder. Lucifer says it with such conviction, the tone flat but hinting at concern, even love. Cas wonders if he actually sounds like that, grace warm with embarrassment. Lucifer smirks and rolls his eyes at his brother.
Cas’s grace cools at Lucifer’s actions, examining every part of Dean’s face for signs of pain. He can tell his charge is hiding the pain as he sits up, once again invading the angel’s personal space. “You touched the wrong shoulder…”
