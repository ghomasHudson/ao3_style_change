would not go down well. "I've just never seen an angel's eyes before. I didn't expect them to change colour."
"This is your room then?" He queried, his voice wavering slightly as he reached down to apply pressure to his wound with his hand, hoping to staunch the bleeding in a different manner.
Castiel rolled his lips together, before turning onto his back again, trying to get comfortable. “I get where you’re coming from, but it shouldn’t mean that you miss out instead just because you’re a few years older.”
“I’m not stupid,” the demon mumbled, wetting his lips again. Castiel didn’t know if the phrase was intended for his ears, or for the recipient on the phone, but he didn’t really care.
Dean immediately swerved into the room with the vamp he’d dismembered, letting his shadow stretch further to where the figure had emerged to track its movements. He knew Cas had headed in that general direction, but it was hard to differentiate between the two separate movements when the angel had gotten close to the creature so quickly, so Dean didn’t exactly want to go blindly attacking them both on the off-chance he’d get the wrong monster.
With a weighted object like this, Dean wouldn't forget. Not that he really could at this stage, but still. It also meant that he'd be able to summon it to hand in the future if it ever got lost or he needed the reminder.
He straightened up at his eyes refocused, both hands resting on his knees so he could support himself properly. He refused to look to Castiel, not exactly curious as to what kind of expression the angel had on his face at this point in time. Dean was just gonna go ahead and assume it was one of anger, because,
Of course, that guilt vanished whenever he found his traps destroyed and empty, but Castiel hadn't had an incident like that happen in almost a year. He hoped he'd been fortunate enough to avoid having it happen to him again this time around, but he wasn't about to start digging out traps on a more regular basis to make up for the losses, no matter how nice it'd be to have some more variation in his diet.
“Can you leave me alone now?” He asked, lifting himself onto the countertop and crossing his legs. He didn’t care if it was unsanitary or anything of the sort. He wasn’t going to be eating anything made here.
He hadn't heard from Dean for a few days now, and although Castiel had enjoyed having so much time to himself, he did find himself looking forward to talking to Dean again.
He let his eyes close for a moment, feeling the ache from staring at Castiel’s glow for such a long period of time.
The boy was young. By normal standards, considered too young to even survive the turning process, yet here he was: shrunken in on himself in the far corner of the room, having watched Castiel murder the beast responsible for such an occurrence.
“Can you maybe take that outside,” Pamela snapped, shooting Dean a glare. “You really think I can concentrate when you’re screaming the place down?”
Dean let out a heavy sigh, thumping his head back against the wall. It should not have been this difficult to write one fucking sentence. Hell, he could barely get past the greeting bit, but if he didn't include a 'hello' of some sorts he was worried the text would seem a lot less heartfelt.
Castiel glanced back momentarily, frowning at the vacant appearance and the direct stare the boy greeted him with.
element of interest if the boy was so utterly obsessed with the illustrated stories, hence the reason why he was attempting to read at least a little of it now.
sternly. Cas wasn't all that good at the 'I'm-an-adult-and-you-should-do-what-I-say' side of things. Not anymore at least. Now it was just bordering on a lazy attempting at upholding dominance.
Part of Dean still believed that his dad could go back to how he once was, but he doubted it'd be anytime soon. John was still out for blood, and no amount of hunting would ever really fix that. Not completely.
But he’d injured his captor, so it wasn’t in vain. Maybe it wasn’t a severe wound, but Castiel hadn’t expected the boy to begin pacing in the other direction.
He didn’t know what the fuck he could do to make things right again. He’d done something without asking his dad first, he’d risked ever seeing Sam again – Sam; who relied upon him for
“I also wanna say thank you for everything you did today,” he added, unable to raise the volume of his voice very much at all. “And everything you’ve done before that, actually. I don’t think I’ve ever … told you how grateful I am.”
He tucked the box and the file under his arm as he launched into the sky, his Grace rendering him invisible as he hovered mid-air, ready to head back up North. He had an hour-long flight ahead of him if he didn't slow too much, but he hadn't struggled with the flight to Crowley's bar in the first place so he figured this one wouldn't be too bad either, especially after he'd been able to rest for a half hour or so.
need a room, but my uncle should be at home by the time I've talked to my dad so I'll be alright," Dean uttered quickly. "Thank you for offering though."
"Hey, I never called you a freak! It just caught me off-guard," he said, mimicking Castiel's stance in an attempt to sight his face again. "It's cool, though. Like the whole change with Psylocke."
The sound of the door being unbolted had him turning his attention back to it immediately, forcing a pleasant smile onto his face when he spotted the boy lurking in the doorway. Well, he wasn’t a boy as such, but he looked young. He couldn’t have been any older than seventeen.
He pulled a chair over from the table so he could sit down without invading Bobby's space too much. Dean had rehearsed part of what he was going to say already, but he knew that a couple of words weren't going to change Bobby's views immediately - especially when he seemed so certain of his own information.
Before staying with Bobby, he'd met her once. He wasn't exactly gonna travel back and forth between his dad's motel and The Roadhouse specifically to hang out with someone he'd struggled through a ten-minute conversation with, but things were different now. If Dean was to go back on the road at some point, he'd definitely go out of his way to make time and visit her.
"You little ..." he grimaced, getting to his feet. The ice cream fell from his shirt to the floor in a thick mess, and he pulled at the base of his shirt to prise it away from his skin, the fabric wet and unpleasant and smelling of that sickly flavoured mint shit.
He got to his feet, hopping down to the ground to wander over to where Rumsfeld was viciously gnawing on the tennis ball.
Admittedly, it made Castiel rather jealous. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had time free of work, unless the days he was rendered jobless could be considered anything like a vacation.
There was always the idea of taking Cas to the motel to actually heal Sam there, or obviously bringing Sam to the cabin, but he wasn’t sure how comfortable it’d be for Sam, what with the only real bedding in the place being a musty old sofa in the store room. It would be far less effort to take Cas there and just let him walk after the whole healing thing was done – and considering the fact that John couldn’t teleport like Dean could gave them
He tried to ignore the conversation in the background, walking toward the kitchenette and running his eyes over the equipment lain out on the island. He knew each and every item there, and just thinking about how they'd effect him had his head spinning. It didn't help that he still hadn't slept, his hand resting against the countertop as he tried to keep himself upright. Being tired was one thing, but he didn't want to pass out next to the very instruments that could drain him, even if the boy had promised his freedom.
He'd admittedly found it difficult to avoid the subject given just how many questions the boy had thrown his way, but he'd also found it almost humorous. Castiel, in a weird way, found Dean's fascination with him incredibly entertaining, even if it could potentially lead to trouble. Although they hadn't spoken too frequently since going their separate paths, it was hard to miss the genuine excitement in Dean's tone at the start of every conversation.
But Rumsfeld was different. He recognised Dean and that definitely made him feel better because the dog could bark
It certainly made him feel more at ease when Dean began to voice the numbers, even if the boy's shadow was beginning to make him feel rather trapped. He could tell that Dean was still somewhat unsettled though, able to detect the demon's heart rate owing to their close proximity in addition to the nervous way in which Dean's shadow and fingers continued to twitch.
He didn't want to change his ways too much under the assumption that everything would have the same effect overall, just in case something were to go wrong, but at least if this
Cas, oblivious to everything, continued around the room until he'd cleaned up a fair bit. Although Dean was trying his best to focus his sight elsewhere, he could still see Castiel pause and stretch in front of the kitchen sink, his shirt rising up slightly as he let out a soft yawn.
He was far more excited than he probably should have been, but that feeling quickly drained away when he realised the only thing lighting up the screen was a request to be put on charge. The smile fell from his face and he glared at the screen in disappointment, hating the object for giving him such hope.
He pulled back, using a small amount of Grace to relieve himself of the minute injuries, flexing his fingers as the pain disappeared. It hadn't required much energy at all, so Castiel was pleased he'd been able to both prove his ability and take away some of the demon's wounds in the process.
But apparently, Dean didn't need to monitor them at all. After about 15 minutes of sitting in complete silence, Castiel shifted again, his left knee briefly coming to rest on the lower part of Dean's back as he began to shuffle forward.
I may have fangirled a little too hard at the start of this chapter, but there's a ship in the comics that has complete relevance to the stories, so, y'know, Dean has to be an X-Men fan for it all to work.
He could feel his chest tighten the longer he looked at, tearing his eyes away the moment his shadow curved up the wall.
Dean couldn't help the strangled sound that escaped his mouth, grinding his fingertips over the top of his head as his shadow twisted tighter around his calves. He was on the verge of hysteria, trembling with anger and confusion; whilst Bobby sat calmly across the room, sipping his fucking tea and reading his fucking book again.
familiar with both Rufus and Bobby, he certainly did a good job at hiding it; and there was a part of Dean that worried Castiel had done something utterly awful in the past to warrant the reactions to his name - no matter how farfetched that currently seemed from his perspective. It was something Dean didn't exactly know how to address because there might not even be anything to discuss, yet he wasn't even sure if he'd want to know.
Bobby had obviously heard of Castiel before; whether that was through an actual meeting or just word of mouth, Dean didn't know, but Bobby knew about Castiel's current state and how weak he was, and it was stressing Dean out.
He and Sammy had been homeschooled from the beginning. Well, homeschooled to a degree. Mary had spent a few evenings a week going over the basics with them, leaving them with little assignments during the day whilst she and John went out on hunts together, so Dean guessed he had a fairly decent education. Obviously, when Mary passed Dean had to take that place as a teacher for Sam, and he did learn a fair bit himself through that process too, wanting to make sure Sammy had everything he needed for later life. He'd take the kid to local libraries in the towns they visited, seeing as they couldn't exactly take books back to the motels with them without stealing, and they'd always find an aisle as far back in the building as possible to sit in the shadows together, going over topics that Dean assumed would be important.
before! Sure, there were times where the kid had fallen unconscious and he'd been in pain, but he'd never started haemorrhaging or had those creepy-ass vein things crawl up his arm.
It didn't take long before the tears were welling up in his eyes again and he was letting out another prayer for comfort, repeating it in his mind over and over in the hope that this time he'd actually receive an answer.
Castiel sighed, looking off to the window again. "I used up a lot of my Grace to get here, Dean, and it's making things more difficult in terms of healing myself. I know it's selfish considering everything you've been through but I really need to concentrate before things get any worse."
He knew Bobby was hiding something, but that wasn't his main concern right now. These stories were giving him a different kind of insight as to what angels were at their core.
“All you had to do was throw a bit of warding on him and he would have been fine!” Dean argued. “You wouldn’t have ignored him if he was a human!”
He wasn't really in any condition to fly back home. His Grace hadn't stabilised enough to numb the pain pulling at his muscles, so he doubted flying would even be possible. The thought of even unsheathing his wings had him feeling drained, and it only made him want him to stay seated for a little while longer. He just needed a break. Or a drink.
They'd been hanging out quite a bit over the past two weeks, but Jo still seemed somewhat standoffish and Dean wasn't really sure how to work around that. It was weird to be honest because she was actually proving to be more challenging to befriend than Castiel was, and he and Jo had a hell of a lot more in common. Having her live so close to Bobby's was handy too, mostly because The Roadhouse was pretty much the only other place Dean hung out at aside from the older man's house. If Bobby ever needed him, he'd know where he was.
"You're strange for a demon," Castiel muttered finally, and Dean cocked his head to the side in amusement because that wasn't exactly an insult. And even if it was, it wasn't like it had been a critical bash to his self-esteem.
“Can you please stop with the staring then? I mean, I didn’t come down here to be analysed. I came down to talk.”
"Now, I know you might be slightly upset, but I have something of a ... business proposition," Crowley began, an obvious smile to his voice. "I was hoping we could meet."
But it piqued Dean’s curiosity, and he found himself leaning forward again to try and see around the door.
He drew his phone out of his pocket lethargically, knowing who it'd be without even looking at the caller ID.
He wasn't all that surprised when he found himself lying awake in bed later on, practically tearing apart all the conversations he'd had with Castiel in his mind and picturing those sigils over and over again. He couldn't get any of this shit out of his head and hated it.
That's kinda why he was pleased that he was able to stay at Bobby's, no matter how short a time it'd last: it gave him more of an excuse to go see Jo when he was bored.
It didn't take long for Castiel to realise that Sam's eyes matched that of the average demon, and he resisted the urge to look at Dean's again, analysing the younger boy's features cautiously. He was rather relieved to know that Sam wasn't in any way affiliated with the nightmares, but again, that brought his thoughts back around to Dean and
By the time he arrived at The Roadhouse he'd designed a place in his head, right down to the number of cupboards he'd have in the kitchen. Sure it was ambitious, but it was also really nice to think about. It was a good distraction.
"It's not really a witch thing, it's more ... well, it's an ability some angels have," Dean murmured, kicking at his own shadow when the tendrils continued to thrash about. "I'm not mad or anything if you did, but I'd rather not, like, be used as a puppet."
But suddenly it was drawing back, and Castiel frowned as his skin was exposed to the warmth of the motel room again. He flexed his fingers now that they were free, but looked up to find Dean staring at him, the boy’s face a surprising shade of red.
That earned him a glare, but Dean winked in response, even if it did make him feel hot all over. He knew that he was playing with fire by effectively flirting with the guy, but it wasn't like it meant anything. And anyway, Cas pulled funny faces when Dean was a little bit more playful.
Dean moved to the bar, looking over his shoulder as Jo cautiously stepped over a mess of cabling. "So ... what exactly are you doing to that thing?" He queried, watching as her long blond hair fell over her shoulders when she reached for a screwdriver. "Do you need any help?"
Dean had a very unique perspective on life for someone who'd been born into hunting. He had a certain optimism about him that just seemed so out of place for someone with a demonic heritage. Well, it was optimism or hope. Castiel hadn't been able to decide which it was just yet, but regardless, considering what Castiel had witnessed of the boy's life so far, he was surprised that Dean didn't have the attitude of every other demon in the business.
The sun had barely risen when Castiel was joined in the doorway, the sunlight making the floorboards glow with this bold, orange colour, and Castiel cast a glance across at the boy when the demon sat beside him, the child keeping silent without so much as a question regarding why Castiel was even there in the first place. Castiel wasn’t really sure of what he himself could say, not that the boy was giving the impression that he desired conversation anyway.
Dean raised his head, letting out a shaky breath as he looked about the opening section of the store. He supposed he could have been stuck with worse abilities - destructive abilities like angels have. His dad would have probably had more use for those than anything else, and Dean was just glad he hadn't been used as anything more than a scout for the first year of his hunting experience.
Not when Castiel’s last employer had been quick to hand him over. Given Castiel’s current state, he was completely open to harm.
Dean crouched beside his duffle, rooting around for clean clothes. It wasn't that he was embarrassed that Cas had noticed because that's what he wanted. Cas was worrying way more than he needed to. It was sweet and it might've made Dean feel a little weird, but he'd never had anyone other than those he'd thought of as family to be this caring, and other than being as kind as possible, what else could Dean do? Cas was being so friggin' nice and open with him, and Dean wasn't exactly used to it. He didn't know
how weak his voice sounded – his throat dry from dehydration – and he felt the heat creep over his skin, knowing that the demon would only mock him for his pathetic state. After all, it was the demon making him this way, forming some sort of bracelet on his wrist to take the place of the collar, and although Castiel was grateful for the loss of the heavy weight around his neck, he still hated that the boy thought it necessary to keep such a ridiculous hierarchy in place. If anything, Castiel should have been the one with a power control, given his age and maturity. The boy was an idiot, and would probably manipulate him further if things didn’t go to his plan.
“You want to sit down or something?” Castiel inquired, stumbling over the words, and Dean understood why Cas was reacting in such a way – why he was probably just as terrified as Dean was – and he hated himself for it. So far this afternoon, Cas had been fine with him. There’d been none of that worry shining through to indicate that the angel was as frightened as he’d been yesterday, in spite of the fact that the guy knew Dean could just as easily go back on their deal and kill him as soon as it was over.
Dean pulled his phone toward him, continuing to stare at the inanimate screen. He didn't know whether or not now would be a good time to send Sam a text, given just how close it was to them being separated. John was probably expecting it.
Castiel went over to the duffel on the floor, his movements still a little lethargic, but the angel squatted with surprising ease considering his recent injuries.
He remembered how Cas had talked about his powers in the past and knew that this was something he could work with, given that the guy could manipulate all sorts of elemental shit with something as simple as a touch. Sure, Dean could have easily gone back home real quick to grab a pen and paper, but he knew damn well that he'd misplace a note - especially if he left it in his pocket and threw his jeans in the laundry.
"I was gonna say: this is sorta far from where I last dropped you off. You out on a really long bar crawl or something."
Dean could feel a kind of anger begin to wash over him though. Like, Castiel’s employer had arranged for the angel to take all of these creatures on by himself. Although Dean could see from Cas’s fighting style that he’d be more than equipped to deal with nineteen vampires alone
. Just the bigger ones - the ones that had that low bark and growled to a degree that Dean didn't consider all that safe.
The phone was bundled in Dean’s shadow within seconds after it had swept across the top of the kitchenette counter, knocking all sorts of shit on the floor in the process. Castiel clearly wasn’t impressed, making some sort of tutting noise as something bounced across the carpet, but he plucked the phone from Dean’s shadow as soon as it was close enough, tapping one of the buttons on his ancient-looking Nokia brick.
It went quiet again as Castiel continued up the stairs, and he frowned when he stepped onto the upper floor, throwing his shirt to the ground before moving on through to the area he’d first been introduced to. He sat down on the beam before laying back, a hand over his eyes and a grimace on his face when his wound ached with the pressure.
"Never said you were," Sam chirped, his shadow reaching out to twine with Dean's on the ground, and Dean let himself relax on the swing so he wouldn't end up dragging Sam along with him, his shadow keeping in place with the boy's on the floor. "Not that, y'know, I'd have a problem with it or anything."
The demon looked at him like he was being ridiculous, continuing the conversation as if Castiel had said nothing at all.
Whilst a witch's hex could be physically stopped, a charm was different. It seemed like the whole charming aspect was a lot more subtle because it could be controlled and altered through a thought process, allowing angels to manipulate the mind of anyone they meet with something as simple as a touch, or in some cases even eye contact. They didn't need to plant anything on your person. All they needed was to get close for a split second and suddenly you were their fucking bitch.
Cas was slow to react but he looked over eventually with a gentle smile on his face, his hair noticeably even more dishevelled than usual. “I’m sorry for waking you,” Castiel replied quietly. “It’s still quite early though, Dean. Go back to sleep for a while longer.”
"That's a joke, right?" Dean mumbled, his face flushing. "She didn't seem to care all that much when I talked to her back then."
There was a sharp crackling before the line went dead, and Dean found himself scrabbling to redial Castiel's number, wanting to hear what else the angel had to say. He knew it was probably costing Cas quite a bit as it was, given the fact that his phone claimed they'd already been talking for around about two hours, but still. He couldn't just
Here he was, fully prepared to be told by the angel to fuck off forever, yet Cas had effectively assumed outright that Dean would be staying with him. In a tiny room.
Okay, yes. Maybe it was stupid of Dean to intentionally rile the angel up when he was still relatively scared of the guy, but the feeling he got from it truly was just ... indescribable.
Castiel waited patiently, taking note of the anger washing over the demon’s face, eyes sheathing behind those all-too-familiar black lenses, “Because you said
He stepped to the side quickly when the angel waved a hand through the air, the bathroom door abruptly slamming shut.
Well, he had an address of a fashion, but he didn’t want the other hunters finding out where he lived. He didn’t want to become the next target, vulnerable should he do something wrong.
echoed through his mind, twining doubt with his thoughts. He didn't want Dean to spend too long on his own if he'd fare in the same manner as earlier, but he also didn't particularly want to spend his evening babysitting when he desperately needed rest. Yes, it was selfish. Yes, he wanted Dean to be safe; but Dean was still a demon. Castiel didn't know if the boy's father would make him retell the happenings from the past few days and Castiel sure as hell didn't want his home location to be something that Dean shared, no matter how much Castiel did want to trust him.
It only reminded Dean that Castiel probably didn't get given things very often, and he felt a familiar pull in his chest as he continued to think about just how different their lives were.
Obviously, it didn't really hold the same protective aspects as other deals, but it ensured a minimum amount of work each month that could be reimbursed with a payout if the assigned quota hadn't been reached by the end of the calendar year.
He looked down at his shoulder, at the tweezers lodged in the gunshot wound, and he scowled. He hadn't expected the angel to have a gun, and to be injured thirty seconds after meeting the guy was fucking embarrassing - especially when Castiel had been held in a fucking trap!
That last hunt ... he hadn't been prepared for. It was one thing to have let his guard down, but it wasn't as if he'd actually been able to defend himself properly regardless. He almost felt ashamed for letting himself get caught in such a shitty situation when he knew something like that was bound to have happened at some point or another. Christ, he'd basically thought about the bleeding process every day ever since he'd first been informed of it.
He jostled his hands again when the demon didn't react, meeting the boy's eye. "Hurry up. My arms are aching."
“Not in a bad way,” Dean murmured, watching the angel’s eyes brighten every time he blinked. “I’ve just not experienced anything like that before. That’s all.”
he'd still have to concentrate just as much to make sure he didn't fuck up any of the stitching. It'd probably be easier to do by hand in all honesty. Given the fact Castiel didn't have the money to spare on new clothes anymore, it made more sense for him to make sure it was all as good as he could make it.
"I'm never buying you ice cream again," Dean vowed halfheartedly, letting their shadows intertwine between them. It brought a sense of comfort to him whenever they did it, and it always seemed to make Sam feel better too. That's why they usually linked overnight, just in case Sam had a nightmare and needed the reassurance that whatever it was he was seeing wasn't happening right that second. Maybe it wasn't the best reassurance, given that almost everything Sam saw came true eventually, but Dean wouldn't ever let Sam get hurt.
But he didn’t know how reliable Cas would be if Dean asked for his help now – not since Dean had essentially abused him and fucked with him completely – because what the hell must this look like? Dean had been intending to do what his dad had asked, and now he was having fucking second thoughts!
"What were you meant to do?" Sam persevered, and Dean lay down on the bed, rolling onto his stomach with his chin resting on his crossed arms, facing the headboard.
Okay, so initially Dean had just been over-thinking about the situation with Bobby again, because although he’d figured things would be a little better by the time he would next see the older man, he was starting to have doubts. Like, yeah, it was one thing Bobby knowing about Dean’s relationship with Cas, but now
Dean took the onion from him abruptly, nudging him aside. “Okay. Cool. I’m a big fan of vague answers.”
Dean walked over to where Castiel was awkwardly positioned, staring down at the guy in confusion because he
He knew not to be overly ambitious and ask for anything more than that, even if his math skills weren't really up to speed. All he had was a rough estimate of what his average week of shopping would total to, and whilst he was putting his job on the line by asking for more than normal, he knew that Crowley was also in a very vulnerable position right now.
Castiel had admittedly been a little jealous of Dean's ability to teleport so simply wherever and whenever he pleased, more so because of how useful it would be on a hunt to avoid danger. He'd overheard people talk in the past about the angels that could phase through objects or the ones who could escape any confinement in a manner similar to Dean's disappearance act. Having such a skill would make him far more worthwhile as a hunter, and it'd eliminate a lot of his fear surrounding going back to work.
Again, Dean was kind of surprised by the delivery of the question, but the frown still tugged at the corners of his mouth and he was struggling to keep himself composed. It didn’t matter that Bobby had sounded genuinely concerned. Dean didn’t know how many drugs had been pumped into the guy since he’d had his leg set so he probably wasn’t meaning to come across so docile in the first place.
"I ... want to apologise," Dean said slowly, rolling his bottom lip between his teeth again for a moment. "For losing my temper, and getting, um ..." He swallowed, ducking his head further. "Emotional."
Considering at the time it wasn’t exactly illegal to kill an angel for no reason, it had made the hunt all the more significant. Sure, with the bleeding process not yet outlawed, angels were becoming rarer by the day, but this one guy in particular hadn’t seemed to care. They’d grown powerful enough that the threat of being captured by a group of hunters no longer intimidated them, and as a result, a lot of good hunters died trying to take them on.
But still, Castiel found himself worrying. He didn't doubt that Dean was a capable hunter, but it was the lack of contact between them that had him slightly on edge at that moment in time, more so because Dean could potentially be dead and Castiel would never know for sure.
It wasn't anything Castiel wanted to get involved in, not that his opinion would be appreciated should he voice his concerns. He doubted the rest of the demon's family was as peculiar as the boy was himself, more so given the fact that his father had been the one intending Castiel's murder.
tray-baked pie on his birthday; half of it was undercooked because the motel oven was so faulty, but he'd sat and eaten as much as he could regardless just to show his gratitude. It was one of the best birthdays he'd ever had.
"Thank you," the demon said softly, and Castiel waved it away, making himself comfortable. He pulled the medical kit closer, rummaging through it again to find a roll of bandages that was wide enough to allow him to use less, even if he shouldn't have been concerned about wasting someone else's supplies anyway.
And it'd be pretty damn hard to get it accurate unless he carried a fucking paintbrush with him at all times.
Castiel had no intention of requesting work through Dean, no matter how desperate he got. He didn't need to have any more connections to the demon than he already had and he also didn't want to become reliant on someone else.
Pamela had seemed nice enough when she’d visited them a few months ago to do a reading. She was good with all that energy-reading kind of shit. Obviously, she hadn’t been able to read a damn thing when she’d examined Sam, but that had also gone for every other psychic they’d employed, so whilst he hadn’t exactly witnessed her supposed skill, he didn’t want to jump to conclusions.
They finished their food in silence, but even when they were done, Castiel was surprised to find that Dean was still intent on doing everything on his behalf. The bowl was taken from his hands before he'd even had a chance to respond to the 'you done with that?' Dean threw in his general direction, his words coming out as a garbled mess when he finally managed to give his thanks.
Castiel stopped walking, staring down at the grimy floor as the blood dripped down over his hands, arms numb from a lack of any real movement. "No."
The angel grinned across at him, allowing Dean to identify the dark shade of lilac that had replaced the prior blue of his irises, and he ducked his head in embarrassment, feeling the blush crawl over his cheeks. Sure, he wanted to look at Cas's eyes again, but he'd just made a damn fool of himself and sharing eye contact with Castiel wasn't exactly going to make him feel any more comfortable.
Obviously, fiction was pretty different to reality and Dean didn’t even know if the doctors in Dr Sexy MD were even accurate in terms of anything they did procedure-wise, but Dean didn’t have anything else to go on. He couldn’t risk wasting time by googling some medical shit when Cas was already lifeless in his arms, no matter how helpful that information may or not be.
He was confused by the fact that it wasn't a phone call, and, admittedly, a little disappointed, but he opened the message anyway, somewhat wary.
So he stared down at the unconscious body on the couch, his mouth going dry as he watched trails of scarlet pulse out of the gash on the man’s stomach with every fading heartbeat.
thinking he was doing right by being frugal. Other hunters did far worse things whilst out on a job, and Castiel was beginning to feel like he had no other choice. He'd been terrified to the point that, whilst he recognised he didn't have all that much to live for, he'd rather be able to take his own life however and whenever he pleased as opposed to being tortured to death by some ignorant fucking stranger.
There was no blood. Just a virtually faceless child with bright green eyes; speaking the same message, never growing older.
Dean didn't really know how to fix something like that. He'd always been a little cocky when it came to helping on hunts but the consequences had never bled into his daily life outside of hunts before, and it made him feel surprisingly vulnerable.
The angel looked up at him as he turned around, adjusting the base of the shirt he was wearing. It was weird seeing Castiel in his clothes, but it wasn't like he'd particularly liked that shirt. It was plain and a little too big, and yet it was the only item Cas had actually considered acceptable in terms of appearance, even if his shoulders were broader than the fit of the clothing. It didn't look
He only wished Sam could have experienced more of them. He almost felt guilty for having so many good memories of their family whilst Sammy had only been around to really remember the worst of it. It's why Dean tried so hard to replicate things Mary had done, like the birthdays, and the trips to the library - little things that most kids would take for advantage, but Sam relished because of how abnormal it was in a life like theirs.
He browsed through the files, opening up the one containing his comic book collection before selecting the last one he'd bookmarked. Obviously he'd read through them all before, but it wasn't like he had much else to do in his spare time. He liked the stories anyway. Well. Most of them. Maybe the older editions of some X-Men storylines were a little drab, but the writing had definitely improved over time.
Bobby didn't reply immediately, but Dean kinda appreciated the silence that hung in the air, able to gauge just how much tension there was between them before Bobby had even responded.
"Yeah, I'm sure my dad'll set you free after he hears that," he muttered, tightening his grip when the angel flinched in his hold. "Gonna need a little bit more than a fucking sentence to explain this, Cas."
He spent the next twenty minutes collecting everything together in a basket, nursing it beneath his shadow as he walked around the store. He still didn't feel all that great but the lightheadedness wasn't anywhere near as noticeable as it had been a half hour prior, and even the trip back to Bobby's place didn't do much to change that fact.
Castiel didn’t even know why he was thinking about such pointless things. He wasn’t going to keep the demon up for very long at all.
Of course, it was almost pointless to get toys. John always claimed they were a waste of space in the car, so usually after Sam's birthday each year when they moved on to a new motel, everything was left behind or thrown in the trash.
made him smile wider, more so considering the fact that Dean probably wasn't in the best of places at the moment, so to hear such a happy sound was pretty great.
That wasn’t to say that he still didn’t find a lot of Dean’s behaviours irritating, but as someone who had spent the majority of his life with his own company, everything outside of his norm was somewhat irritating.
"Sorry," Dean whispered, stumbling to his feet and offering Castiel a hand. "Uhhh ... you actually okay to stand?"
– and Castiel couldn’t do anything to change it. The boy knew now that the blood of an angel held no healing properties, and there was no way Castiel would attempt to persuade the child to kill him anyway, even if it meant the demon wouldn’t have to live without his fucking family.
"You're a kid," Castiel whispered, the boy's face finally resting in the crook of his neck, making their position a bit more comfortable. "You shouldn't be assuming responsibility when it’s your father's job to look after the both of you."
Obviously, back then he'd had a reason to feel alone. Everyone was dead and he was still unused to the abuse that the other hunters deemed appropriate.
how this was going to end for him. No angel lived after such a procedure, no matter how much blood was taken.
Castiel began another examination of the upper floor rooms, having not seen everything in such clear lighting, but it was more than obvious that the instruments for the bleeding process had been put away elsewhere and Castiel didn’t deny himself the immense satisfaction merely knowing that the boy truly didn’t intend harm. The weight he felt in his chest was considerably less prominent, even if there was still worry surrounding his thoughts. He understood that the demon was going against orders and he couldn’t help but think it an incredibly stupid decision to make, even if it did benefit himself greatly.
Castiel stumbled back when the boy appeared before him, barely suppressing a noise of surprise, before he was being grabbed by the arm and the whole world was spinning with colours around him. It lasted a few more seconds before he found himself being shoved backwards into a mould-ridden cubical in some form of public restroom, the cuffs vanishing from his wrists as the door slammed shut.
He’d thought it would be a lot harder to locate the angel than it actually was, but by the time he’d knocked away the rubble from the second door and managed to get his head around to check, he was almost laughing with relief, thankful that there was at least a
He shouldn't have been thinking about something like that again. It was stupid and pointless and actually made him feel kinda uncomfortable. Like, yeah, Cas was sorta ...
Castiel didn’t know how it worked – or even if that was the case at all – but it’d be wiser to address the topic as opposed to leaving his questions unanswered forever.
Castiel fully understood why his parents had been so reluctant to talk about their heritage though - especially when Castiel had been so young he wouldn't have known just how dangerous mentioning something like that to the wrong person would be.
“Don’t worry. It won’t harm you,” Castiel reassured him, reducing the amount of energy he supplied to it so that it was nowhere near as threatening. The light bobbed up and down above the bed as Castiel slid between the sheets, and he reached to take it in his palm once he was seated, reabsorbing it into his body.
But that couldn't have been what Sam had been referring to unless he thought Cas had put on a front or something when he got here. In all honesty, it wasn't that farfetched an idea. If Cas had been a complete douchewad in the first place, then Dean would have negotiated to ensure that he wasn't as much of a dick around Sam, and besides: the kid hadn't spent as much time with him as Dean had. Even now Dean couldn't safely say he knew what Cas was like as a person, what with all his damn mood swings, and Sam hadn't actually talked to him that much.
He'd been trying different recipes, different combinations of food to see how he could stretch his resources further, but so far everything was having the same kind of impact. It was difficult to tell just how helpful it was when he was already feeling so much stronger.
But this was the only place he was welcome. Dean didn't want to upset Bobby to the point where he was being kicked out for his supposed idiocy, and if dancing around the subject meant he could hang around for just a little while longer, then of course he wasn't going to run his mouth.
That in itself usually took about twenty minutes so already Dean was worrying about the rest of the journey.
He tucked both hands under the pillow beneath his head, continuing to match Castiel’s breaths as he began to feel less flustered.
to take me home. I requested you let me go on my own. I can take everything myself,” Castiel told him, watching warily as the demon raised his head, expecting some sort of glare to be aimed his way, but instead, the boy’s expression was stoic and unreadable, almost as if Castiel hadn’t asked him a question at all. It did unsettle him a little, unsure if the boy had indeed heard him or not, but he waited patiently as the demon blinked at him through the darkness, his irises almost a golden grey in comparison to their regular green.
" Dean hissed, pulling back a little, even if it did make Castiel slump awkwardly at an angle. But he paused because Cas
"So, is this like your ultimate money-saving idea then?" He teased, grinning wider when the angel huffed out some form of light laughter, the bottle on the counter trembling a little as Castiel began to manipulate the drink inside.
Dean had just turned eleven, this new-found ability making itself known pretty much just a few days after, and his dad had suggested Dean come along for the experience, insisting it was the right time. Dean hadn't really understood what John had meant, thinking that he was just going along to observe, but he'd been handed a gun and a stake, and was ultimately told to go into a warehouse to scout it out.
So he took them both upstairs, but he found himself refraining from getting as involved in the hunt as he did before. Something still felt off, and he concentrated on the vibrations across his shadow more than he did his attacks, catching the arms of vampires with the tendrils to hold them in place so that Castiel could sever their heads with a little more ease. The angel moved through the creatures with surprising speed, his Grace flaring every time his blade was embedded into flesh, and Dean actually found himself rather stunned by Castiel’s agility considering the severity of the wound he’d taken on the day prior.
Bobby didn't seem to care all that much. He was pretty complimentary overall, and even if he was more critical Dean wouldn't mind. It'd just give him more opportunity to try stuff out.
"Are you out of your goddamned mind?!” The man yelled, reaching for a rifle that lay on the desk. “I’d sooner kill Bobby myself than let that piece of shit near him!"
The feeling he got from hearing those words was fairly rewarding, and the way Cas had said it had butterflies stirring in his stomach.
And this man in question … he was a hunter. Castiel didn’t know much more about him than that, but judging by some of Dean’s most recent comments, this Bobby liked him and his kind just about as much as every other hunter in the country. As cruel as it may sound, Castiel didn’t exactly want to involve himself with any other hunters if it could be helped, even if it were supportive of Dean. There were only so many risks he was willing to take, and willingly placing himself in an unfamiliar environment with people he didn’t know or trust was worse than any regular hunt he’d been on with others.
It was harder to draw the second sigil when Dean was no longer losing as much blood, but he found himself flinching when Castiel seemed to clock on and the angel grabbed Dean’s wrist abruptly, preventing him from creating another wound.
“Don’t be so dramatic. You have no reason to complain anyway,” Castiel murmured, adjusting his shirt. “You’re taking the bed.”
Castiel put the hatch down, looking around now that there was a little bit more light in the area. He didn't see why he'd have to stay on the lower floor when he was essentially free to do what he wanted now. He had the majority of his power back, maybe not all of it, but he felt far stronger than before.
Castiel found himself stunned for a second, his eyes running over the confusing text before landing his gaze on the demon again. He recognised the print at the very top of the paper as a genuine store name, however the rest of the receipt’s content was an abbreviated mess that was completely lost on him.
Dean swallowed thickly, focusing on the harsh motel lighting. "Y-you said angel blood was the only cure, but you were wrong. Cas -"
Castiel was simply grateful that the streets were practically barren at such a point in time. He didn’t really have the energy to waste on avoiding humans, but he certainly couldn’t allow himself to be visible when he had such a blatant injury on his forehead.
But Dean needed to be honest. Bobby was bound to be pissed at him for keeping in contact with Cas anyway, and bringing him to the fucking house probably didn't sit right with the guy either. Dean didn't know much how much Rufus had told the older man, but it was all gonna come to light eventually and he didn't want to make things any worse than they already were.
It took a moment for Castiel to understand what the boy had asked of him, too focused on the former part of what Dean had said to think about anything else, but he rubbed his thumb over the smooth surface of the metal as he willed the engravings to form where he'd touched. It was a peculiar request, but Castiel understood that Dean's habits were bound to be a lot different compared to his own so he wasn't one to judge. If this helped Dean, then Castiel was more than happy to oblige.
Castiel shook his head as he turned his attention to the view outside the window again. “No. I just don’t sleep very much.”
Castiel groaned, his forehead dropping to Dean's good shoulder. Dean was actually sorta surprised by the action, so used to the guy pushing him away as opposed to ... well, moving closer. He didn't mind, of course. It was amusing to think that Cas wasn't as disgusted by him anymore.
"Wait - did that mean you guys lived like humans then?" The demon blurted suddenly. "Like, with jobs and shit?"
He started the walk down the empty street, dousing the porch of the home housing those that'd been turned with gasoline found in a nearby shed to burn the remaining evidence, ensuring all the werewolf corpses had been cleared from the paving to dispose of in the fire. He had a long journey back to his pay-stop, and then an even longer one home, and he was too exhausted to use his wings. There were cars everywhere he looked, so he assumed he could simply kick-start one of the vehicles in order to travel back.
That had been the hardest part; even when Mary and John had hunted together, she stayed home more often than not, making them feel safe and reassuring them that things were okay. Obviously, there were nights where she and John went out together to take care of cases, but Mary had always promised to come back.
Dean snorted, cocking his head to the side. "Good luck finding a demon that would do a trade like that."
Castiel finished off the bottle, throwing it to the side when he was done before curling in on himself, tugging the blanket closer around his shoulders to keep him warm.
But still, that was guilt Dean could actually understand. Sam was Dean's responsibility. Dean cared about the kid more than anything so
where the demon had claimed. but it wasn't by much, and it was only because it was a different kind of sensation altogether that Castiel chose to focus in on it, drawing it into his own form as fast as he could.
"Walk me through it then," Jo pushed. "Not that I plan on selling my soul, but, y'know. It's kinda interesting."
As jealous as he was of the contents of the picture though, it made him sadder knowing that Castiel didn’t get to keep living that kind of life. Castiel would have been about seven or eight here. Dean didn’t know exactly when Castiel ended up alone, but it was heartbreaking to see what he actually lost.
"Do you want me to take you to the hospital?" He asked quietly, finding it hard to look at Bobby's blood-spattered face. There was disappointment written in his features, a sadness in his eyes that Dean didn't fully understand, but he knew that there was little he could do to make amends now. Not with Rufus here.
had once hunted! Was this whole integration thing a new fucking concept or did they just point blank decide that angels didn't deserve the same decency as demons despite their similarities.
There really was something quite twisted about force-feeding someone nutrients and extracting half a litre of blood a day. It wasn’t the sort of thing Dean wanted to get mixed up in – especially since it was punishable by death in the hunter community.
It started the same way John's story had, effectively explaining how angels and demons were polar opposites and deserved different things, blah, blah, blah. Visits to earth from both parties were rare, and even then it was only the most powerful creatures that could actually travel between the barriers of the universe whenever they wanted. Most demons did it in the name of sales, and angels seemed to visit earth solely to create new life.
“I’m not offended at all. It’s actually rather comforting to know you’re protecting yourself,” Castiel stated, turning the ring slowly. “The last thing I’d want is to hurt you by accident.” The angel paused, squinting down at one of the sigils before tapping it. “What does this one mean?”
! He'd been prioritising talking to Cas over Sam because of the convenience. Sure they'd texted a bit, but with John constantly being around he and Sam hadn't even been able to have a proper chance to talk!
That earnt him a sharp look from Bobby, but Dean didn’t care. The older man hadn’t given him anything to go by so far and he wanted to get as many different peoples opinions as possible.
He'd thought about it a lot, because they were similar in a lot of ways. He'd put her reclusive attitude down to a lack of social interaction, owing to the fact that Dean was pretty much exactly the same. Bobby had told him at the time that Ellen didn't hunt any more, keeping the kid holed up in the bar with only the company of the odd passerby and her own mother.
He stilled at the sound of the angel's stomach rumbling, watching Castiel grimace and run a hand down his face. It kind of annoyed him that Cas hadn't eaten the food that Dean had brought down to him the day before, mainly because he'd actually
The angel wandered over to the bed, picking up the comic book from where Dean had left it on the mattress, staring down at the cover.
He sighed, rubbing a hand down his face. There weren't many options for him right now and he'd never been a patient person. He wanted to make sure Sammy was okay, and unless Bobby found out anything whilst arguing with John, Dean wasn't gonna know for a while.
Dean really didn’t know, and he only confused himself further when he started to think about how abnormal it was for Castiel to lie there without any kind of requirement for medical assistance.
He knew that he couldn't remove his shirt without tearing it apart, and it would be too much effort to try and work with the cuffs in place, so he hadn't really bothered. Not only that but he didn't want to make himself appear more vulnerable in the presence of the child than he already felt, and with his wound on display, the demon would be able to pinpoint his weakness exactly.
"So, what other psychic-y abilities do you have?" He inquired, watching the lilac colour spill through Castiel's irises slowly, almost mixing with the blue.
“N-no, I do. I do,” he interrupted, his face flushing with heat. “And I should have said it sooner. Thank you.”
Castiel took hold of Dean's hand, encouraging him to hold the wipe in place so he could use both hands to prepare the instrument with thread. "I'd feel much better if you stopped talking. I don't want to fuck this up and suffer for it."
He should have done it. He should have killed the child when he had the chance. Opting not to was one of the worst decisions he’d ever made, and now he was going to
about the kind of spells needed to remove something like this. He couldn’t help Cas by himself, and even if he did go about researching something like that without assistance, who’s to say that Castiel’s condition wouldn’t worsen the longer they left it. The angel could pass away at any fucking moment. “Sitting back and not even trying to help him is as good as murder!”
Castiel tore his eyes away guiltily. “I can leave for a while if that would make you more comfortable?”
Castiel ran his tongue along the back of his teeth in thought, toying with the blade on the table again. He had a habit of charging his melee weapons with his Grace to strengthen the impact as it required less force to deliver the same amount of damage. Regular weapons wouldn’t affect a demon’s shadow whatsoever, but something carrying his energy
"Not to ruin your night or anything, but can we maybe go outside for a sec?" Dean asked, throwing a quick glance back toward where Bobby and Rufus were sat at the booth. They still had a few minutes before Bobby would realize something was up and Dean would rather not be confined to a space like this when it happened. "I'm here with my uncle and he's not exactly your biggest fan."
"So." Jo sat up straighter. "I could technically ask for, like, a million dollars and offer a piece of paper in exchange?"
"Dad, please can you just listen to me?" Dean begged, his breath catching when Sam burst into tears, the kid breaking free of John's hold to try and grab Dean's arm. John caught hold of him again, pushing Sam in the direction of the doorway without another word. Dean took that opportunity to continue talking, his speech blatantly affected by his own crying, unable to keep the tears from falling any longer. "The blood didn't work! C-Cas let me try it to heal myself and -"
There was a bout of silence that had Dean regretting the words as soon as he'd voiced them, but he cocked his head to the side confidently, watching Castiel's movements become somewhat uncoordinated.
The mattress dipped a little as Dean sat beside him, and Castiel closed his eyes as he focused on manoeuvring his Grace through Sam's form, barely detecting anything relatively malignant anywhere in his body, absorbing the minor damage to his cells and taint to his blood before letting go of Sam's wrist, leaning against Dean's side when he was finished.
He left the whole thing burning, too exhausted to wait and extinguish the flames himself. It was far enough out of the way that it wouldn’t attract any attention until it was too late, and that was all the comfort Castiel needed to prompt his departure, concealing himself from sight as he stepped out into the street, lethargic and unfocused. He'd wandered so far away from his motel on the journey over that he was struggling to place his actual location, still in a daze from the lingering wraith infliction.
"I was actually expecting something a bit more flamboyant if I'm totally honest," Castiel teased, and Dean backhanded him across the chest in response without thinking, relieved when once more, the deal didn't respond.
But he felt different. He knew he was tired and the illness was still poisoning his body, but things just didn't seem right.
He transported himself upstairs after grabbing his duffel from where it lay beside the front door. Usually, he'd avoid teleporting anywhere whilst he was in Bobby's house, but seeing as he'd be the one vacuuming tomorrow, he figured on this occasion it'd be alright.
“What was wrong with his parents?” Dean pressed softly, looking to Bobby for an answer this time - wanting
“I already told you what we’re doing tomorrow,” Dean reminded him, watching as the angel dabbed at a trail of blood with a cloth, ensuring that the flesh was clean at all times, so it seemed. “I’m gonna wait for my brother to call, and then –“
Dean hadn’t been expecting the man to speak with such a calm tone, and he would admit that it threw him for a second. He swallowed thickly, looking across at the angel on the bed. “How … how are you holding up?”
of a kiss-ass, but enough to nab him the occasional compliment without getting in the guy's way. Without even really talking about it they'd sorted out a weird kind of arrangement: Bobby did breakfast and took Rumsfeld out for walks every so often, and Dean did...
"So you miss me already, huh?" Castiel teased brightly, walking back out to the mouth of his cave to ensure better reception. "You know, you could have just called. No need for all your little messages."
“Can you help him?” Dean directed at Pamela, his voice warbling as he turned to face Bobby in the chair. “I-I mean we just need another spell to break a curse, right? We can fix him?”
Dean may have been super tired, but the more he read of it, the more he actually wanted to pay attention. Surprisingly, it was the first story that actually painted demons as Dean knew them, and the angels were depicted slightly more like Cas. So, maybe Dean was favouring this story because of his hope for the future, but it was also interesting to come across something so bittersweet in Bobby's book collection that didn't portray angels as narcissistic assholes.
He'd kinda decided from the beginning that if he was gonna win back Bobby's favour, he had to be a bit of a kiss-ass. Not
He kept forgetting where he was extending it to, and it was bad enough knowing that Cas wasn’t really comfortable when it was too close to him, let alone having it shape itself around Cas in protection – especially when Sam could fucking
Without his ring, there wasn’t much he could do, and he definitely didn’t remember each and every single sigil that he’d marked on the original silver band.
“Don’t make out like I’m holding you hostage. I just want you to be able to fend for yourself properly.”
', even if the 'btw' aspect was completely lost on him. He considered typing out a reply, slightly worried as to whether this would be the method they went about communicating. It would be more than a little humiliating if he couldn't understand something else Dean said, and he was just as bad at writing his own replies as he was at reading. Although Dean didn't seem like the mocking type, Castiel didn't want to be made into a joke.
Castiel took in another slow breath, his torso the only moving part of his body. Not even his eyes twitched behind their lids.
“Like I said, it doesn’t hurt. Just feels weird,” Dean reiterated, willingly pushing his hand against Castiel’s palm to show he didn’t care about the contact.
Castiel pulled out one of the pink packets he recognized as an antiseptic wipe, smirking at the yellow cat drawn on he front. He ripped open the top, pulling out the folded square as he dropped the empty packet to the ground, resting the wipe with the contents of the box as he reached around to unravel the bandages beneath his shirt. It stung as they were peeled from his skin, but he dropped them to the floor in front of him when he was done, wincing as his blood-crusted shirt flopped back against the wound. He wasted no time pulling the shirt off, staring down at the dampened fabric before balling it up in his hands.
