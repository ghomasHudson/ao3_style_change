Castiel gave him another minute to adjust before sliding them in and out, and making a scissor motion with them, the lube making lewd squelching sounds.    “Are you still good?”
“But if we stick together.  There’s safety in numbers,” persisted Lee.   “Hell everyone knows I’m straight, I ain’t worried about being seen with him.”
He was just about to check his watch when the heard the low rumble of an engine approaching from the west.    A smallish old powder blue VW Campervan made its way down the road, before turning right into the carpark.  Dean moved as it approached, keeping his car between them.  It wasn’t much, but if they decided to shoot, it was at least some form of cover.   The vehicle pulled to stop, exactly where Dean hoped they might park.  Tactically it was a bad place for them, they were pointing into the carpark, which didn’t allow for a quick exit.
“It’s a good looking body,” said Dean, then realised exactly how that sounded. “I mean, it seems to be in good shape. Good proportions. OK, I’ll stop talking now.” He blushed.
Dean rolled his eyes, but quickly focused on Castiel who was lying in the hospital bed.  The right half of his body, and most of his lower half was covered by a blanket, but his left arm, and left leg from thigh downwards were uncovered and heavily bandaged.  He was shirtless and had several monitoring electrodes attached to him.  The lack of clothing showed off several new bruises and abrasions across the left side of his chest and ribs.  His eyes were closed.  Dean glanced at the monitor above the bed, which was showing Castiel’s steady heartbeat and oxygen saturation.   “What happened?”
Pursing his lips, Dean nodded, and retreated to his room.   It had been a very long night, and he hadn’t got that much sleep, and right now he wanted to avoid ‘that’ look his father had given him.
Benny asked about the word Dean had shouted to Castiel, ‘Na-lay-va’.  Dean explained that Castiel had taught him the work for ‘left’ in Russian.   He was fairly sure that Alistair and Azzer wouldn’t know what it meant, which would give Castiel an edge in his plan.   Using the word ‘nyet’ when he asked if Castiel was OK earlier had helped clue Castiel in the meaning quickly.
But Dean didn’t pull away, he stood stunned that this amazing, beautiful creature wanted him. Dean took a deep breath and stepped forward, bringing his arms up to pull Cas closer to him. This time Dean kissed Cas, allowing Cas entry to his mouth. Dean moved his hands down Cas’s back and across the curve of his arse. Cas moaned and pressed harder against Dean.
Reaching out Castiel grasped Dean’s wrist, and within the blink of an eye, Dean had opened his hand and twisted his whole wrist and arm, breaking it free of Castiel’s grip.
Gathering his weird collection of items, Dean swept out of the house, Gabriel and Benny hot on his heels.   He threw everything he’d selected from the kitchen on to the backseat of the Impala.   Gabriel made as though he was going to get in the car as well, but Dean held up his hand.   “Sorry Gabe, I need to you stay here.”
Dean was no push over, and rolled pushing Cas down as he gained the upper hand. “No fighting dirty,” he said as he kissed Cas back, grinning.
Gabriel glanced at Castiel who shrugged.  Castiel knew Gabe wouldn’t overshare anything about his life, even if they did have the same parents.   “It was all kind of an accident really,” said Gabriel.  He decided to skip the less than happy elements of his childhood, “I’d already left home and changed my name and decided to travel for a while.  I ended up crashing at a friend’s place out in California. Completely by coincidence there was a film crew setting up to use the flat next door.   I got chatting to one of the camera men on their lunch break, who showed me around the set, and the equipment.  The following day, one of the crew was sick, and they needed an extra pair of hands.   I helped out and became his unpaid assistant for the rest of the shoot.   The following week, there was another job, and then another.   Next thing I knew, I was officially behind the camera.   Then one day an actor I knew asked if I would help him and his wife make a private sex tape, just for them.   They were impressed by my camera work, and editing skills, and happen to put me in touch with a producer of Adult films.   One film led to another, and here I am.   I ended up creating my own film company.”
The stranger looked over at Dean. “No, you didn’t hit me. My bike broke down about a mile back, I couldn’t get a phone signal to call for help. I was pushing it, slipped and fell, about a minute before you arrived.”
Castiel walked away, but stopped at the sidewalk as they drove past him heading South.   Sam waved and he raise his hand in response.
“You’ve been staring at me for 10 minutes without saying a word,” said Castiel, breaking the silence.   “Do I have something on my face?”
A new shout out this time to Breezeranger on Discord for kindly taking over beta duties.  This is better thanks to her and Sailor_fujoshi.
Tonight however, the stage at the far end was empty.   There was a reasonable crowd of patrons, enough that all of the tables and booths were taken, and groups of people were clustered around several of the standing tables.    He’d spotted Sam immediately behind the bar, his tall frame and long floppy hair, obvious above the heads of the other servers.  Pushing his way through the crowd towards Sam, he stopped dead when he saw who Sam was talking to.   Blue eyes, messy hair and a jaw line that Dean had wanted to kiss every day for the rest of his life.  Cas.
Suddenly without Sam's presence, Dean became very aware of being alone with Cas in the bunker. Cas didn't seem to notice and made himself comfortable in one of the arm chairs in the main room with a book. This wasn't unusual, Cas often stayed to read old obscure texts that were unique to the Men of Letters bunker.
"I followed the example," sighed Sam trying to keep his voice down.  "But I don't get the same answer."  Leaning back in his chair, he tossed his pen on the table in frustration.   "I just don't get it."
Castiel deliberately let his saliva pool around his fingers, and under Dean’s balls.   Very carefully Castiel slipped his index finger lower towards Dean’s virgin hole.  Gently massaging the perineum for a while, before circling Dean’s rim, he continued to nuzzle at Dean’s balls.
Sam shook his head. "Dean, you have never been good at feelings, but I have seen the way you guys look at each other. You have serious eye sex going on. I have no doubt of his feelings towards you. You will work it out."
"CASTIEL!" cried out Dean, as his whole body stiffen and shuddered underneath Cas as his orgasm hit, at exactly the same moment as Cas threw his head back and shouted "DEAN!" as he too came against Dean's cock. There was a mutual loss of sanity between them, as they both rode out the spasms enjoying the pleasure and warmth their combined cum created between them.
Benny handed Sheriff Mills a small clear plastic bag of memory cards.   “We supplemented Dean’s audio recording with a few hidden cameras tucked in the trees.  There should be enough evidence, with these and the audio for a conviction.”
Releasing his hold on Castiel’s wrist, Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel, drawing him closer.   “I think maybe we both need to use our words right now,” Dean huffed into Castiel’s hair.
“Well looking like you do, I bet you aren’t ever without a date for long,” said Benny smiling at him.    “But let me tell you now, you ain’t my type.”
Castiel had repeatedly shown how much he loved the Winchester’s.   Proven by the level of trust he placed in them no matter how many times Dean screwed up.
Very slowly and very deliberately, Dean moved his legs to make space for Castiel between them.  He let his knees bend and fall open, as Castiel knelt between them.  Looking at up Dean, Castiel gave a reassuring smile, “You’re stunning.”
"What… Ew no." said Dean making a face. "I may be many things, but I have never, and will never take advantage of someone drunk." He thought for a moment. "OK. I might have taken advantage during a pool game, but never sex."
He was surprised to find Gabriel already standing at the door, his smile wide and welcoming.   Gabriel indicated that Dean should follow him into the kitchen.    “Cassie’s upstairs.   I thought it might be good if you and I had a chat first,” said Gabriel, taking a seat on one the bar stools and indicated for Dean to sit on one the kitchen chairs.  The obvious height difference made Dean uneasy.
Dean nodded and took off in pursuit of Alistair.   Although it was dark, there was still enough light from the moon to allow Dean to see where he was heading.   Having spent a lot of time both camping and helping on wilderness survival courses, Dean knew that running at speed over wooded terrain in the dark, it would only be a matter of time before either Dean or Alistair would stumble over a tree root or something, and twist an ankle.   Dean paused every 20 seconds or so, to hear the snapping of branches and twigs in front of him as Alistair crashed ungainly through the woodland.   Dean quietly and consistently made his way through the woods in search of his quarry.  The fact that he still had his shotgun made him even more cautious.  He didn’t want fall and accidentally shoot himself.
“Not worth the penny,” Dean said.   He shrugged. “I was wondering about what my mother would think about you,” said Dean.   “I am sure she would love you though.  Probably think you’re way too good for me.  Hell, I think you’re too good for me.”
A recent conversation made me realise that perhaps I haven't been as thorough with the tags on this story as perhaps I could be.  My bad.  If there is a tag that you think should be added for peace of mind of yourself or others - please let me know, and I will review and update.
Dean felt his dick get hard at Castiel’s words.   Castiel was lying there, looking fucking gorgeous.  His dark hair mussed up, his eyes sparkling slightly, still flushed from his early orgasm, biting his lip and staring at Dean like he was a long cold drink after a week in the desert.   Dean felt a wave of lust rising through him.  Castiel had offered himself to Dean, and Dean wanted to take him six different ways from Sunday.  Dean groaned, “I gotta ask Cas.  Just so we’re on the same page.   You want me inside you?”
“Oh lawd,” drawled Benny.  “Yep, definitely take him shopping Cher.   We’ll be there Monday morning to support you both.”
As though hypnotised Dean felt himself walking towards the messy overstocked rack.   Dean stared at the magazine, his jaw dropping as he looked at the picture on the front cover.  “No way,” he breathed.   That was Cas.  His Cas.  Nothing but a towel hiding his modesty.  Special edition proclaimed the front cover.  Hands trembling, he reached for the copy - how could he not?
Cas release a breath he hadn’t even realised he had been holding and smiled. “Not if you don’t want it to be.”
“Cas said something about one of his brothers working there.   Is that going to be a problem?” said Dean.
“Now that’s a good look on you,” said Dean roughly from the side.  He cleared his throat, and said, “anything there you hate?”
Sam came bouncing down the stairs just as Dean returned with the ice packs and some tea towels.    Gabriel had managed to get Castiel's hoodie and T-shirt off and was gently checking over his ribs and back.  “Definitely some cracked, possibly a broken rib.  Back’s bruised too.”
He could hear Sam fumbling with something in the background. “Wow.  OK.  Call the hospital and see what they say. I am on my way.”
“Hey! It was that or ‘I smile because you’re my brother, I laugh because there is nothing you can do about it,’” said Gabriel patting Castiel on his head and standing up.  “Seriously though, just think about it.  You might want to give Dean-o a chance – let him through that armour of yours.    Call me if you need anything.  Night Cassie.”
Dean helped pack up the clothes and then followed Castiel upstairs to his room carrying several of the bags, partly to help, and partly to escape Gabriel’s constant sniggers.
It was later that day, that Benny first began to hear the rumours circulating.   At first it was just disgusted glances thrown in Castiel’s direction, and then it became barbed comments.
“I think it would be a good idea for you to take it easy,” said Missouri as she disposed of the needle in the used sharps bin. “If you haven’t finished working yet, I think you should.”
It was one of the reasons that Dean was so well read.   Being surrounded by books could transport him from the dank cells of Chateau D'if in the Count of Monte Cristo, to action and adventure across the world in the books of Matthew Reilly.   Having a working knowledge of classic literature, and even the 'Chick Flick' writings of Austin and Bronte had proven beneficial to Dean on more than one occasion outside the classroom too.  A quote here or there, often had girls thinking of Dean as sensitive or misunderstood, which along with his ‘bad boy’ looks got him a lot of attention.
Now Castiel needed to adjust himself at that thought.  He removed his hand from Dean’s and they resumed eating their meals.
Dean rested his chin on Castiel’s shoulder and just held him.  “You’re going to be having way too much fun at Berkeley to miss me that much.”
“Yeah, but running didn’t work so well for him this time,” said Dean.  “And I checked his timings.  He’s only about four seconds off the High School track record for the 440 yards.”
The first indication that something was different was as Dean was standing at his locker.   The usual clamour of students in the school corridor died away.  It was like a tidal wave of silence, followed by loud whispering.  Turning to see what was causing the commotion, Dean looked down past the students to see Castiel walking determinedly towards him.   Dean’s mouth dried up, and even knowing the selection of clothes that Castiel had to choose from, the appearance of the man in front of him took his breath away.  Their eyes met and neither could break the intensity of the stare between them.
After making love into the early hours of Saturday morning, Dean and Castiel decided to forgo their usual morning run, and instead spent the time lazily kissing and sucking each other off; making memories to see them through the coming months of separation.  Neither mentioned the impending parting. It was as though a single comment would shatter the illusion that everything was normal.
“Holy…” Dean stopped speaking before he could say something stupid.  Dean was very glad he was facing Castiel, and not watching from behind.   Castiel was really flexible, and that pose had definitely raised some interesting and mostly inappropriate thoughts.  Dean was sure he would be blushing if all his blood hadn’t just rushed southwards.
Shaking his head, Benny took the ball from Dean’s hands, and started to walk back to the school, their lesson was almost over.  “Not really.  But I am not sure he really wants any.  I know he used to be friends with a guy called Kevin.  But Kevin got injured in a hit and run, and his parents pulled him out of school and moved to a new area, closer to a rehab facility.  Never saw him again.”
Exhibiting a level of control that Castiel never knew he had, he slid into Dean at a pace that would almost have been consider glacial.  Dean keened as Castiel finally bottomed out, relishing the feeling of fullness that he received.
Castiel couldn’t keep the happy gummy smile from his face, and a burst of happiness from his scent. Jack gave a sudden sneeze at the intensity of Castiel’s pheromones. Causing them both to laugh.
"How did you do with your supply run; How's Garth?" said Sam easily, glancing up at him and the large box of food he was carrying.
Castiel still couldn’t quite believe Dean had talked him into travelling with him over to Topeka to go shopping.   Gabriel had been enthusiastic about the idea, to the point of throwing a credit card at Castiel and telling him to go wild. Dean had found the thought of Castiel ‘going wild’ hilarious, and Gabriel and Dean spent the next ten minutes laughing their heads off, to Castiel’s bemused expression.
“Don’t worry, these didn’t cost anything.”    Castiel climbed back into bed.  In his hand he had a small pillow shaped gift box.  “I know we discussed this a bit last night.  But with you going, I wanted to give you something to remember me.”  Castiel bit his lip and handed the box to Dean.
“Fuckers,” cursed Dean under his breath.   Suddenly the name calling, the slur, and Castiel’s reserved behaviour made sense.   “Are you out?” he asked quietly, not wanting anyone else to hear.
Dean's jaw fell slightly open, and his eyes flickered around Cas's face, taking in the stern but caring look Cas was giving him, the slight stubble around his jaw line, and the messy, but oh so sexy hair.
It was like the years of maintaining a distance between them had created a need that in this instance, a single moment of separation was unacceptable.   They needed this.  Skin against skin, legs pressed together, kisses and touches.
In this position their cocks bobbed free in the water, and they both sucked in a breath as their cocks touched together unclothed for the first time.    Castiel’s pupils were dark and wide with desire.   “Let’s do that.”
“I know you can, son,” said John calmly.  “But there are more ways to hurt someone that just physically.  What if someone decided to start on Sam because of you.”
For the first time in what felt like days, Dean could breathe again.   He could do this.  They would do this.
Dean whimpered slightly, feeling both the loss of Cas’s presence and also the discomfort from in moving his now aching lower body.
Watching as Castiel pocketed the card again Dean said, “I thought you were some kind of penniless student living on welfare.  Are you secretly a millionaire?”
"I'm commmmming," sing-songed the voice behind the door.   The front door opened, and Dean was faced by a sandy haired man, a few inches shorter than himself, who was probably six or seven years older than he was.  He was sucking a lollipop, which he removed from his mouth as he made a huge show of looking Dean up and down.    "Well hello handsome stranger.   What can I do for you?"
“I never said that, but hell of coincidence, wouldn’t you say.”  Benny sighed and pushed open the door to the showers. “Small town mentality, but would you want to be friends with someone that has that many enemies?”
Cas continued to shift his body weight, slowly, with precision and economy through every movement. His movements changed from individual elements, just a hand or foot, to a complicated combination, constantly moving his arms, hands, legs, feet and whole body. Cas bent and twisted gracefully, with precision and effortless elegance. He moved across the sand, barely leaving an indentation behind. Moving forwards and backwards in the same consistent space.
Sam rubbed his hands together gleefully. "OK. So I want details – not too many details. But how long have you two …." He broke off at the look of terror that passed over Dean's face. "Oh hell. When you said last night, you meant last night." Sam suddenly realised something. "Dean, I am not going to pry here, but I am well aware of most of your hook ups. I've seen you with ladies, even a couple of ladies, but, I don't think I have ever seen you with a guy before. Are you bi? Have you ever…?" he trailed off unsure how to continue.
After being out all Friday night, Dean felt like he should put in an appearance at home, and regretfully left Castiel a little after 6pm.    When he arrived home, John had made dinner, and the family enjoyed a meal of Spaghetti Bolognese, before they all sat down to play cards for the evening.
. I know we’re kinda doing this out of order, with us having a pup first, but yeah. Pup, living together, courting, mating, marriage. I don’t care about the order. But count me in for all of the above.”
“Well, I just wanted to hear the full account from Dean,” said Gabriel.  “And to give you this.” He passed Dean a small white business card.  “Cassie contacted his lawyer this morning and told him about what you did.   He offered his services pro bono to you, Benny and Lee, should you need him.”
“It’s OK.  Talbot won’t name any names, but the counsellor said the person said they had just seen it, and that was at 10am.”
Castiel removed his fingers, and Dean cried out at the empty feeling.  Castiel quickly added some more lube, but this time used it on his own cock.   After giving it a few swipes with his hand to ensure it was properly covered, he moved forward closer to Dean, resting Dean thighs over his own.  Very carefully he lined up with Dean’s now open and exposed hole, and gently pushed just the head of his cock in, holding on to Dean’s hips.
Alistair looked at Dean in disgust.  In addition to being barefoot, Dean was wearing a low slung pair of jeans, that he hadn’t bothered to zip or button, the belt hanging loose, and unbuckled.  It looked like Dean had hurriedly pulled them on over his naked body.  Dean was also bare chested, but quickly pulled on a T-shirt that he was carrying.  Alistair spotted what looked like bite marks on Dean’s arms and spat on the ground.   “We need to talk.”
Sam pulled out a kitchen chair, and Dean straddled it, facing the back of it, allowing Sam better access to his abused back.   Pulling off the clean T-shirt, Dean allowed Sam to gently smear the cream along the worst of the grazes.   It would help prevent infection, and hopefully promote healing.
“Patience,” said Castiel, as he bent his head and kissed the inside of Dean’s thighs.  “We’ll get there.”
Dean sighed, “I know this is going to freak you out, but before we go any further, I think we need to talk.  And I think it would be best to do it out here before I lose control back in our room.”
“You don’t have to,” protested Dean.  He was already feeling guilty about the amount they had spent.
Castiel shrugged, “It’s not something I would be keen to repeat in a hurry.   I believe I should thank you for teaching Dean so well.  Without him, I don’t think I would be here otherwise.”
“Dude, whatever you do, don’t admit that to anyone else,” said Dean grinning.   “We need to up your street cred, not destroy it.”
Small guttural noises were Dean’s only response.   After another 30 seconds or so, he finally said between pants, “Need. You. Yes. Do It.”
Dean pulled him in for another kiss and then lay staring at the ceiling with Cas comfortably snuggled against him, resting in the crook of his arm. Dean had never felt so happy or relaxed. Or even sober.
Their kisses turned from passionate to dirty and needy.   Dean could feel Castiel’s hips rolling against him, creating a delicious friction.   Dean could feel the desire in him, he would need just a few more seconds to lose himself in Castiel.
So far, Dean and Castiel had done nothing further than some serious kissing.  Dean was not rushing Castiel into anything more, and although Castiel was dropping some pretty big suggestions about the back seat of the Impala, or the privacy of the disabled shower area, Dean held back, saying that their first time together was going to be special, and not a quickie during their lunch break.
“Don’t worry about, I guess your meds are still making you tired, and you need rest to heal,” said Dean taking the awkwardness out of the moment.  “The movie is about over, and we’d better give you two some peace and quiet.  Sam and I need to get going anyway.”
"The example is incorrect," said Castiel simply.  With a pencil, he carefully circled the incorrect symbol, and jotted in the correct one.
“Nurse?” he mumbled. Trying even harder to open his eyes, he managed it for a fraction of a second, before closing them against the bright light. He moaned again. “Never drinking again.” Dean could feel Sam resting his hand on his shoulder. Suddenly he realised he couldn’t feel his legs.  Why was he numb? Why couldn’t he move properly?
Castiel turned swiftly, ignoring the rapidly cooling mess in his boxers, and kissed Dean passionately.  “You were wonderful,” he stated firmly, leaving no room for an argument.  “There aren’t enough words for how happy I am.  How happy you made me.”
“Tea,” agreed Gabriel.   “Sammy, can I ask you to make the tea?  Everything’s in the cupboard over the kettle.  Make it milky and add four sugars.”
Ignoring the frankly indecent look the man had given him, Dean indicated his car with his thumb. "It's Cas. He's hurt bad."
Placing his helmet in the footwell, he climbed into the passenger seat. Gabriel looked like he was about to say something, but Castiel cut him off. “Just drive, Gabe. I’ll tell you on the way,” said Castiel.
Dean shook his head at Castiel's confusion. "No.  I'm just messing with you," said Dean.   “I’m Dean.”
Dean sighed.  “Cas, I’m not messing with you.   I appreciated your help with the notes, and I thought we might talk a little.  That’s all.”
Thrusting a little faster, Dean knew he wouldn’t last.   He was already feeling so far gone in the warmth and tightness of Castiel.   Dean pushed a little harder, and was rewarded by Castiel with another dirty moan.
Slowly Dean moved slightly from the waist down, canting his hips and pressing down firmly onto Cas's. Cas's eyes fluttered shut and his hands gripped Dean's hips tightly trying to prevent any further movement. Cas could feel the solid muscle of Dean's thighs along his own, and the hard, oh so very hard, presence of Dean's still fully clothed cock nestling against his own.
At around 6am Dean felt the need to use the bathroom. Swinging his legs out of bed, he took a slow careful walk just down the hallway to the cubical. He felt a lot better after relieving both his bladder and bowels, and carefully washing as much of his nether regions as he could manage. As he exited the bathroom he saw Alexis approaching the bathroom looking concerned.
Dean lent gently on the door frame smiling as he watched Castiel shuffle his feet slightly, his arms slightly raised, as though he was performing a waltz.
Placing his book down on the table, Castiel finally looked up at Dean.   “I know you mean well.   But no. We can’t be friends.”
Dean took Castiel into his arms and kissed him hard and demanding.   Castiel suddenly found himself pushed against the wall, as Dean kissed and nibbled down his jaw and neck.
For Dean, the idea started as a mere possibility.   But Dean had thought about it, refined it, added, customised and expanded that possibility into a full-blown strategic plan.  He’d let it stew and percolate in his head for a full 4 days before he felt ready to share it with anyone.
Fortunately, their Father agreed that both boys should spend the last three months of this academic year staying in one place.   Dean in the last year of High School, and Sam in the last year of Junior High, it was a good time for them both to have a small amount of stability.    John Winchester would never win any father of the year awards, but he loved his boys, even if sometimes he had a hard time showing it.   The death of their mother when Sam was only six months old, in a house fire, had hit the whole family hard.   After the initial shock wore off, John had spent a few months with his friend Bobby, before taking up random jobs that took them all over the country.   Dean had first learned to read from the road signs, then from maps, and learned his maths skills from calculating map distances, times of journeys, gas consumption and budgeting their limited cash.
Sheriff Mills wanted to drive the boys back to Gabriel’s herself, but Dean wasn’t prepared to leave his car behind.  Eventually she agreed Dean could drive the Impala, and she would follow them back.
"Sam, this is Cas.  He helped me out first day at school.  Cas, this is Sammy.  My genius younger brother," Dean said waving his hand to each as he spoke.
There was muffled thump, the sound of a bolt being drawn back, and then the door of the cabin opened.  Dean stepped out barefoot onto the little porch area, pulling the door shut behind him.    He looked around in confusion, before spotting Alistair.   “Alistair, is that you?” said Dean. “It’s like 2am Dude, what the fuck are you doing here.”
Castiel had worn his arm in a sling during the week, to protect it whilst at school, but he had forgone it today.   Castiel felt like his shoulder was stiffening up, and he wanted to give it some gentle movement.  Although Castiel could drive, and Gabriel would always let him borrow his car, his leg wasn’t quite ready to handle braking and accelerating yet, so Gabriel had dropped Castiel off at Dean’s home.
“I’m fine.  What are you doing here?” said Dean, and then looking over Sam’s shoulder he saw his father and Castiel approaching at a more sedate pace.  “Oh shit,” he muttered
As Dean sat waiting, he heard Castiel call out, from the changing room.  “I think I need a larger sized shirt.”
After checking with Sheriff Mills about the time she wanted them at her police station for statements, Dean texted Benny and Lee the following morning, they had to be there by noon.  John agreed to drive the three of them, leaving Sam back at the trailer.
This morning however Dean was completely unprepared for the situation he found himself in. Firstly, he was hit with an unusual smell – a combination of ginger, cinnamon, cardamom and raspberries. It smelt so good, he couldn't help but deeply inhale the scent enjoying the difference between that and dusty blankets. He could also tell that he had slept much longer than his usual 3 or 4 hours, and had slept really well – proper full restful, no nightmare sleep. The shock moment came when he tried to stretch and discovered not only was he in bed someone, but was completely entangled with them. This wasn't just cuddling, it was more like possession. Dean found that he was not only leaning on that person, using their arm as pillow, but their legs were entwined together, almost to the point of being unsure who had the more dominate position. Dean also realised that he was comfortable – the "I don't want to move – can I stay like this forever" comfortable.
Halfway through the lesson, Dean threw Castiel a quick glance, to see Castiel looking directly at him.  Castiel gave him a small smile before raising his flat right hand to his chin and gesturing downward towards Dean.  ‘Thank you’ in ASL. Dean smiled.
John stared at Castiel, as though he had three heads, and six wings, before he looked down at Sam.  John stepped back, placed a finger under Sam’s chin, and lifted his face so he was looking directly at him.   “Something’s not right here boy,” said John.  “Dean ain’t no fisherman, and you’ve been left on your own for days at a time since you were nine.  Why did Dean want you to have a sitter now?”
This was a lot to take in, thought Dean, as he looked around the room.  “What does Cas think of this?”
Keeping eye contact, Dean adjusted his position.  He moved his legs so he was kneeling in the bath, and then leaned forward, walking his hands up the bath by the side of Castiel, coming to a stop either side of Castiel’s chest, boxing him in. Holding his nerve and hoping he looked confident, Dean pushed into Castiel’s personal space, hovering his face just above Castiel’s, “We could do that, or we could try the other stuff you asked for.”
Doctor Brown smiled. “Good to know. OK. Let’s see how things are progressing.” She washed her hands in the sink, and approached him. “Can I take a quick look?”
Dean nodded.  "This is my younger brother, Sam.  I know Cas from school."  Dean paused, "I wanted to take him to the ER, but he insisted he wanted you.  I don't think he lost consciousness, but they worked him over good.  Back and ribs especially.   He didn’t want us calling the cops either."
John had left for Texas the previous day, Sunday, leaving the boys with a couple of hundred dollars for the week.   It was a well ingrained habit with the boys that when their Dad took a job, and left them on their own, they would spend as much time after school in the local library.   It had started as a way of being to let Sam study in peace, and access books for his studies that they couldn’t afford, but it also meant it saved them money not having to light and heat the trailer.  Another point in its favour, was that not all hotels had free Wi-Fi, but libraries nearly always did.
They kissed again, but this time the touches between them was softer and more delicate.   Slowing down, Castiel smiled, and kissed Dean gently on the forehead.  “Do you want to go inside?”
Castiel had suddenly change tack.  Instead of kisses, Dean felt a warm wet tongue lick at his balls before it took a slow tortuous route from the base of his cock to the tip.  It took every ounce of self-control not to buck under Castiel’s touch.    Castiel continued licking and mouthing Dean’s cock, as he gently touched Dean’s balls, dragging his fingernails across the sensitive skin.
Castiel winced and blinked in the bright light.   Castiel knew Dean was there, he’d heard his voice, and when his eyes stopped watering, he couldn’t take his gaze off Dean.   He tried to pull away, but Azzer had a tight hold.
Dean and Gabriel carefully helped Castiel stand and guided him to the Playroom.  Once next to the bed, Dean handed him off to Gabriel and left the brothers to themselves.   He made his way back to Sam in the lounge.
Lee refused to let Dean stop, and with a jerk of his head at Benny, Benny and Lee practically frog-marched Dean out of the building and over to the sports field.
“Don’t make me separate you two,” said Dean.  The banter between the three of them made Dean relax.   Things couldn’t be that bad if they were already teasing each other.
“Sam,” said Dean, getting his attention.   He quickly signed something to Sam, whose eyes went wide, and he blushed furiously.
“Yeah, that night I brought you home.   Well, I kinda disgraced myself by acknowledging I’d seen them,” said Dean grimacing.
After thanking Noah for his time and effort, they gathered their many bags of purchases, and with unspoken agreement made their way to the food court.  Both were ravenous after their long shopping trip.
Thank you for reading. All feedback appreciated. Even just a full stop to let me know someone read and enjoyed it.
“Look, you’re not wearing a Pride T-shirt or a rainbow patterned jumper.  These are ordinary, but nice, clothes.   Jeans, shirt, jacket.   Stand tall, stand your ground.  Make people see you.  I think once they get to know you, they’ll like you.  Also, once they know you aren’t a push over, I think the harassment might stop,” said Dean.  “Most bullies are cowards.  When someone fights back, they usually run.”
Sam quickly gave a repeat performance of the story from the car journey home, along with several additional details of his classmates.  Apparently, Sam’s maths teacher had already spotted his potential and was already setting him up with extra work.  His year tutor had discovered his interest and knowledge of Latin and had agreed to introduce him to a teacher at the high school to see if there was the possibility of him joining their afterschool Latin club.
“Oh, goody for you,” said Castiel sarcastically.   “Now not only will I have the Jocks after my hide for being gay, but the girls are going to hate me for …” he paused.
He had been patiently waiting in line for his turn, when his eyes had flicked over the rest of the shop, and finally rested on the magazines on the top shelf to the far right of the checkout.  Initially the bright yellow and red of Busty Asian Beauties had caught his attention, but then a pop of blue, from the next magazine along had him drawing a quick intake of breath.   Those crystal clear blue eyes were unmistakable.
Rachel, one of Lisa’s friends had even approached Castiel, in front of Dean, and asked for Castiel’s assistance with her Physics homework.   Castiel cautiously agreed to help, and during one memorable lunch Castiel and Rachel sat at one table going through the work while Benny, Lee and Dean hovered protectively at the next table.
Dean continued to pour and flip the pancakes.  “Sorry.  I guess I am just ….”  He broke off.  He couldn’t think of how to articulate how he felt.  “You’ve been really great this week Gabe.  I can’t thank you enough for letting us stay here.  I am sure it wasn’t easy for you.”
Dean was still mostly clothed, so Cas reached under Dean’s t-shirt and gently touched his nipple. Dean arched and cried out. “So sensitive, I think I could make you cum just by touching you there,” said Cas.
“That stinks,” said Dean honestly.   “But surely that would make the school more likely to help you.”
“This is really cool,” said Sam as he speared a piece of halloumi cheese and held it towards the flames.
When Dean had gone back into the cabin, after speaking to Alistair, he’d slipped into his boots and grabbed his jacket and shotgun.  He’d then hit speed dial to Lee to let him know Alistair had arrived.   Dean hadn’t known exactly where Lee had been waiting with the Sheriff, but he had wanted to get as much as he could from Alistair before he called for back up, in case they arrived sooner than he expected.   When Dean realised that they had tied the door closed, he used the trap door to drop beneath the cabin and roll out unseen into the surrounding vegetation before Alistair had started the fire.    He’d circled around the cabin towards the pathway, to block Alistair’s means of escape.
Nodding mutely, Dean paid for his purchases and walked hurriedly back to the flat he shared with his brother.   Fortunately, Sam was out at work, so Dean was able to take it into his bedroom without the usual judgemental stares.
“I don’t like that fact that the only reason Cas is being hurt because he’s gay,” said Dean. Biting his lip, Dean made decision.  Looking down at his hands, so he couldn’t see the faces of his friends looking at him, he continued, “because in another place or another time, that could be me being bullied or beaten.”   Dean took a deep breath, “I mean, I’ve dated both.  Men and women.”
"Dude I went to college and had gay friends," said Sam shrugging. "It's no big deal. I wanted to understand the mechanics, so I knew what they were referring to."
Dean could see the moment when Alistair suddenly realised that he was in a whole heap of trouble.   Making yet another fateful decision, Alistair pushed Gordon forward, directly into Dean’s field of fire, as he ran off into the woodland, trying to get away from the scene.
Once they entered the classroom, they let Castiel find his usual chair in far corner of the room.   Without any communication, Benny and Dean took up position sitting in front and to the side of Castiel, forming a protective cordon.  This wasn’t their usual seating arrangement, and it raised a few eyebrows from their classmates, who had to find alternative seating.
If Dean hadn't been so worried about Castiel lying on the ground, he would have laughed out loud at the high pitched scream the one closest to him gave, as both of them turned and sprinted down away, practically diving into the bushes that edged the service yard.   Dean knew his priority had to be Castiel rather than chasing the bastards down.   Dropping to his knees next to Castiel's prone form, he quickly felt for a pulse at Castiel's neck, sagging in relief as he felt the fast but unsteady beat.   "Sammy!" Dean yelled to attract his brother, whilst trying to assess exactly how badly Castiel was hurt.
Missouri cleaned up the ultrasound gel from Dean’s belly, and indicated he could get up. “Full term is around 40 weeks. 34 weeks would be fine, if Jack,” she smiled using Dean’s name for the pup, “was a little bigger.” She hummed thoughtfully as she looked at Dean. “I think a steroid injection would be a good idea.”
John led them, as they walked back to their cars.  Mindful of safety, like he’d been taught, Dean opened the shot guns, so they couldn’t accidentally fire, and stowed them safely in the Impala’s boot.   Benny stashed the small camera’s they had used and suddenly yawned.  “Sorry Cher.   I guess the time has caught up with me.”
Sighing with relief, Dean quickly joined Castiel in the house, as the woman that had opened the door to Castiel closed it behind Dean. Dean could tell she was a Beta, and relaxed a little.
Copying his father, Dean drank the rest of his whisky in one go and put the glasses into the sink.   His father was leaving again tomorrow for Texas.   John had already explained he’d be back next Saturday by lunchtime, would be dropping the truck off in Lawrence, at Matty’s request, and they would be heading back to Texas immediately in the Impala.  That gave Dean only 6 more days with Castiel. His fingers reached for the tag around his neck and he smiled sadly.  It just wasn’t enough time.
It was as though they could communicate telepathically, each moving in unison with the other.   A constant rhythm of push and pull, and give and take.   Lips and kisses, tongues and licks, and teeth and nibbling.
Dean wiped his mouth on the back of his hand, unsure of whether Cas would want to kiss him now. He needn't have worried, as Cas pulled him close and then rolled him on to his back, claiming his mouth with wordless thanks.
Dean spotted a hoodie and water bottle by the side of the track, and assuming they were Castiel’s he made his way over to them, watching Castiel run.   Dean was no expert, but he could see that Castiel was running faster than he had seen most of the athletics team members at this and previous schools run in the past.   As Castiel passed the end of the circuit, he hit his watch and glanced at the time, pulling a face that indicated he wasn’t unhappy at the timings, but it could have been better.
Dean growled and grabbed Castiel’s arm pulling it up to his chest and cuddling it. “Oh yeah,” he protested. “Well, I can’t help my pregnancy hormones, or the fact that you are one sexy Alpha that I can’t keep my hands off. Besides, this pregnancy is totally your fault!”
It had been several weeks since Dean went to court and faced the Lafitte’s. Sam was convinced that Billie had both seemed somewhat sympathetic towards Dean, and unhappy with Noah’s behaviour and responses. However, being sympathetic wouldn’t necessarily mean a favourable outcome for their case.
It’s the strangest way that Dean had ever been asked, but it’s so appropriate with Castiel that he couldn’t imagine the question being asked in any other way.  It was bizarre how they had been practically dry humping each other outside in the paddock an hour before, but now Castiel is asking permission to touch Dean, beyond their kisses.
The tension between them released and they relaxed back into each other’s company for the journey home.
“I don’t want you to go either, but I know it’s what you need.  And I will always be here, as your annoying, better looking brother, whenever you need me.”
“Nothing’s wrong.  I just had a moment of realisation, about how special you are.  How much you mean to me.”  He squeezed Castiel slightly.  “Sorry it took me so long to realise it.”
The injustice of the situation burned in Dean and fueled his desire to put an end to the campaign against Castiel.
Once they had the bike on board, they headed to Gabriel’s home in Lecompton, just west of Lawrence. After about 30 minutes, Gabriel turned to his brother. “Come on Cassie. Spill. Something is bothering you. I can smell it.”
Sam nodded again.   “Oh yes, I am sure she will.”  Sam looked at his phone again, this time to check the time.  It was about 10.30pm.   “Well I think I might head to bed.   It’s been a long day, and my brain is fried from all that Latin.”
Dean stood in front of the Impala, tears now streaming down his face, allowing Castiel to hold him as he watched his family disappear from sight.
“For what exactly?” shouted Dean.   “For trying to study?  For returning a book to library?    For trying to get through life without assholes like you bullying him every fucking day?   Cas has never hurt a fly.”
Following Missouri’s instructions, Dean rolled on his side facing Sam, who had returned to hold his hand. Dean couldn’t see the monitor, but he knew his heartbeat had jumped considerably.
“Mi casa es su casa,” said Castiel as he tipped the bags out on the bed and started to put the clothes away in the closet.
Sheriff Mills had kept them apprised of the ongoing case against Alistair and Gordon, but currently there was no expectation of a court date on horizon, so John planned to head back to Matty’s for another week.   A week after the events at the cabin, Dean helped John pack up the truck ready for John’s return to Texas.   John slammed the tailgate shut and indicated for Dean to join him in the cab.   Dean climbed in and steeled himself for a ‘conversation’ with his Dad.   This was something John often did when he wanted to speak to either of the boys without the other being present.   The simple physical positioning of facing forward, lessened the possibility of conflict that sitting opposite each other would bring.
“You know the sofa isn’t big enough.  Fine – Playroom.   But explain first,” said Castiel unhappily.  “Leave Sam here.”
Shaking his head, Dean waved a hand over the jewellery items.   “Is any of this stuff not advertising a sexual kink?”
"I understand, Sam," said Castiel meeting the younger mans eyes, and understanding the depth of sincerity there.  "You and Gabriel both."
Lee and Benny had only received a few enquiring looks from their teammates, at their newfound friendship with Castiel, but no significant negative or derogatory comments.
“Shit, sorry Sammy.  I forgot you hadn’t seen this before.”  Dean pushed him out the room.  “I’ll be out in 2 minutes.”
Dean glanced over at the group of girls that were all giggling and throwing simpering glances at him.    He smiled and waved at them, watching them blush.   “Well, that is mighty nice of you all.” He stood up and turned to Castiel, winked at him, and went over to join Lisa’s group.
Moving his hand to Dean’s face, Castiel ran his thumb across Dean’s jaw.   “Look at me, Dean,” said Castiel, there was a slightly harder than usual edge to the request.  Dean focused immediately on Castiel’s face.  “Any time you want, for any reason, you say stop, we stop,” said Castiel firmly.  “If you feel any discomfort at all, you tell me.”
Cas gently pulled back slightly, giving Dean a chance to take a much needed breath. He pulled the young man into a simple embrace, this time no kissing, just warmth and acceptance. Dean's chin resting in the crook of his neck. "It's OK Dean, it's OK." He kept murmuring, whilst stroking his back.
With the utmost caution he approached the area of movement, checking around him frequently in case of ambush. The trees created a natural screen, but he could see a humanoid shape moving slowly in the open space on the shoreline, behind the trees.
“Hi there.  Sorry to descend on you unannounced Mr Winchester,” said Gabriel standing and extending his hand to John.   “I’m Cassie’s brother, Gabe.”
“Cassie will be going to Berkeley, if I have to drag him there and fucking superglue him a chair,” said Gabriel darkly and very quietly.   “He needs that. He needs to be away from here.  Do not screw that up for him.  Do not screw him over.   Or trust me, they will never find your corpse.  Do you understand?”
“And they are prejudiced bigots,” said Dean crossly.  He sat back down, and folded his arms, waves of anger radiating from him.  “Small town America, Sam.  It’s not quite as bad as Alabama, but not far off.   Not everyone is as accepting as you and Dad.”
Cas looked at him puzzled, "what are you laughing at?" Cas stepped back and looked down at himself, "Am I deficient?"
Dean had laughed loudly at the idea Castiel would be laying low in his room to avoid meeting any of the actors or crew.  What a strange life Castiel had.
Sam grinned and slapped him on the back, as he left the kitchen. "I would definitely say sex with Cas qualifies as that. May I suggest you go to your room, and read that privately. I think you may need a while to absorb it."
John asked to speak to Gabriel privately, and at Gabriel’s insistence, John agreed the boys could stay with Gabriel for the rest of the week.
Words were not needed between them as Dean gently widen the gap between his legs, allowing Cas's legs to fall between them, increasing the pressure on both their groins. A noise akin to a growl escaped from deep in Dean's throat as Cas started to move. Cas reached around and grab Dean's hand, stretching it up until it was above Dean's head. Maintaining both momentum and pressure he quickly grasped Dean's other hand, and repeated the maneuver, effectively pinning Dean beneath him limiting his movements.
Gabriel grinned evilly, “And I love you too.   But Dean’s right, there’s no way even with both of us, we’re gonna get your sorry ass upstairs tonight, and I think I will probably need his help regardless.”
Sam goldfished again for a longer period, before nodded quickly grasping to the suggestion like a drowning man.  “You got it Cas.  That’s exactly it. I’m kinda waiting for a phone call from a girl I like.”
“I’m so glad you’re back.” Sam threw his arms around his Dad and hugged him.    John looked a little surprised, but pleased and hugged him right back.
Dean shook his head. “We’re both kinda focused on exams.  I think we’ll figure something out after that.”
With a loud keening sound, and an even louder “CAS!”, Dean came, pushing back against Castiel, as Castiel’s knot formed and caught on Dean’s rim, locking them together. Castiel cried out loudly himself, biting down on the meat of Dean’s shoulder, as he came long and hard within Dean, his own need for release having been withheld to satisfy his mate.
Watching carefully, Sam saw Castiel look at Dean. Nothing was said verbally, but Sam got the feeling that a whole telepathic conversation occurred between them, in the space of a few seconds, which ended when Dean reached for Castiel’s hand and grasped it firmly.
“I know. There’s nothing we can do about the court date Dean. Even if you were in a coma, I think the Lafitte’s would proceed. Technically you don’t have to be there, if you want to stay with Jack. It’s Alpha fighting Alpha really. Me, as the Winchester family Alpha against the Lafitte family Alpha. I want to call you to stand as a witness about them disowning Benny, but I don’t have to.”
Dean had been dreading that particular conversation.   In fact, he wondered whether it would be better to not mention it at all and wait for him to arrive back on Saturday.  Dean knocked the back door to let Sam know he could come back in.   Then took out his phone.  With a heavy heart he dialled his Father’s number.
“I’m at home now, and I’m not in trouble,” said Castiel.  “But it was a close-run thing.  Someone went to the counsellor, and said they saw me putting ‘obscene’ material into another student’s locker.”
Each page was Cas in a different setting.    The photos were actually rather good, and showed Cas’s figure off to best advantage.  He wasn’t naked in every shot and you could see a progression through the story being told in images.   Standing in front of a large soft bed, one arm resting on the cross bar of a large picture window, with his shirt open and loose, his thumb hooked into his jeans pocket.   Then lying back on his elbows on the bed, his erection covered by his jeans, but a clearly visible bulge present, as though watching his lover off camera.   Another of him lying face down on the bed, naked in that one, with his ass on display, looking like he was asleep after being completely and utterly fucked out.   Further poses in various states of undress, showing off incredible abdominal muscles, and his treasure trail leading to covered but clearly generously proportioned cock.
Dean risked a look at Castiel.  It seemed like the only thing Castiel was looking at was Dean.   “Let him go, and I’ll do it,” said Dean.
Turing to his left, Dean saw Lisa walking towards him.   Her friends stopped a little ways off and watched her approach Dean. “Wow Dean,” squealed Lisa excitedly as though he was her long-lost friend.   “Is it true, you got Alistair arrested?”
“Gabe, you’re on speaker.  I’ve got Benny with me.    Check his shower, is it wet or dry?” said Dean still pacing.
“I’ll get the food, Dean,” said Castiel stacking the bags under the table.  “My treat for all your help.”
The nurses surrounding the bed were all in motion again. It was like a well choreographed dance, with everyone moving at the same time, but not crashing into each other. The woman in the yellow scrubs had moved off to the side, and another nurse was assisting.
This time it was Castiel that groaned as he slowly started to roll his hips.   The friction of Dean’s tight walls against Castiel’s cock caught Castiel off guard, and too soon Castiel could feel his entire body responding as he made love to Dean.  But he was determined to hold back until Dean came first.  It might be Castiel’s first time, but he wanted that first time to be for Dean’s pleasure, not his own.
“Why not,” asked Dean, genuinely confused.  “I’m not hitting on you.  I just thought that maybe you’d like to join me for lunch sometimes?   If people see you’re with me, they might realise …”
Dean continued to kiss him as he continued his ministrations on Castiel’s ass.     Dean could feel Castiel becoming more eager.   This time he didn’t ask, and just slid a third finger into Castiel.   Castiel tensed slightly before relaxing, but this time Dean didn’t give him a chance to adjust.  He twisted his fingers and lightly brushed over Castiel’s prostrate.
Dean released a breath he hadn't realised he was holding, and hugged his brother back. Sam had always been very open minded about relationships, a lot more than their father had ever been, but still Dean was relieved that Sammy wasn't going to make an issue out of it.
The rest of the week passed pretty quietly.   There were no physical attacks on Castiel, although the comments and jibes continued.  Dean, Benny, and Lee continued to try to keep an eye on Castiel but it seemed like even the teachers had realised that enough was enough and very quickly shut down any non-lesson related chatter in the class.
Castiel nodded. “I think we can manage that.” With very precise, slow, carefully controlled and easily readable movements, Castiel placed his helmet between the two of them on the front seat.
Dean sent Sam a text letting him know Castiel was doing OK.  Whilst he had his phone out, he suggested that maybe he and Gabriel’s could exchange phone numbers.   If he’d had it earlier he would have been able to call Gabe rather than drive to the house, and if anything happened to Castiel, Gabriel would be able to let Dean know.
Dean laughed, “Yeah, not happening.   Let’s just say my companion is a little tied up at the moment.”
Alistair nodded to Azzer, who used his knife to lift the blindfold off, pushing it up from the rear of Castiel’s head.  From the sharp intake of breath Castiel took around his gag, Dean figured the knife had probably cut Castiel in the process.  It probably hurt like hell but wouldn’t kill him.
“Guys,” said Dean.  “I know you’re doing this because Cas is my friend.  But I think I need to tell you something.”
Had Sam said ‘Dad’?   Castiel realised that this must be John Winchester and breathed a sigh of relief.   This wasn’t some crazed psycho killer that would murder Sam in his bed.  Although looking at his face, Castiel thought John might still chose to murder him, just for being there.
Dean wanted to call out, but experienced had taught him that stealth and cautiousness were usually better options.
Castiel smiled, one of his large gummy grins. “I promise you my undivided attention as soon as you are well enough, Omega mine.” He eased Jack into a comfortable position, skin to skin, allowing Jack the best access to his scent gland. Castiel sat reclined in the chair, with Jack nestled into his neck, taking in therapeutic lungful's of Castiel’s scent. Jess pulled up a second chair for Dean opposite Castiel’s so Dean could watch them.
“Not sure if I should be worried you know that, or worried that you carry one.” Gabriel rubbed Castiel’s shoulder.
“I know you have learnt a lot from this experience, and therefore I’m cancelling your grounding,” said John with a smile.   “On the understanding that you continue to behave like the adult I expect you be.”
“Will you really teach me some self-defence moves?” Castiel asked.  “I mean my default has been running from trouble.   But as I found out, that doesn’t work when they ambush you.”
Castiel watched with pleasure as Dean pushed down, clearly enjoying the sensation.  Castiel stretched his fingers wider again, he wanted Dean open enough to enjoy the experience with as little pain as possible.
“Hurt you or him?” said Gabriel with a knowing look.  “Because from where I’m sitting, I can see how much him in pain is affecting you.”
He dialled the number for the delivery suite at the hospital, and waited for them to answer. A cheerful voice, finally answered with polite, “Birth centre, Patience speaking.”
Dean had a premonition that something else was going to happen on Tuesday.   He texted his concern to Castiel that morning.   Dean was convinced that if someone had already slipped gay porn into a locker, planting something worse in Castiel’s locker was a possibility.   Castiel thought it unlikely and was unconvinced by Dean’s argument, but as Dean pointed out, it wasn’t exactly an inconvenience to move his stuff to a different locker and if nothing came of it, so be it.   Therefore, that morning as soon as they could access the school, Dean and Castiel transferred the content of Castiel’s locker to a different one in a different corridor and moved the padlock.
“I’m going there now,” said John.   Automatically checking his hip for his gun, his breast pocket for his phone, and his jacket pocket for his keys as he moved, John walked towards the door.
“Gabriel told me that you and Benny were acting on the family’s behalf in a Kidnap and Ransom situation.  Castiel had been taken, and you were meeting with the kidnappers.”
Reaching forward Castiel placed his hands on Dean’s rear.  “I suggest you remove those pants then,” he said, raising a single eyebrow.
Dean stared at him, before Cas smiled. "Fucking Sammy", said Dean annoyed. He saw Cas reaching out to heal him, but Dean leaned back out of reach, "No Cas, leave it. I want to feel it. To know it really happened."
In the lounge Castiel was lying propped up on one of the sofas with his feet resting on a foot stool.   He was still wearing his PJ’s, and appeared to have half the bedding from the Playroom around him.  The white duvet was covering most of him, and he had several pillows supporting his back.    The white of the butterfly plasters holding a cut together near his left eyebrow looked stark against the extensive bruising around Castiel’s left eye.   Castiel looked up, and gave a small smile to Sam, as he approached, “Hey Sam, Hello Dean.”
“No. If you’re worried, you’re worried. I’ll go ask what’s happening, and I’ll be right back,” said Sam reassuringly. As he stood up, Missouri appeared with a trolley of medical equipment for the epidural.
From Bitch: 8.38pm     It's not Benny.  You have to come.   I promise I’ll do the laundry and the washing up for a month.
“You don’t have to go,” said Castiel, looking directly at Dean.  “I mean, I want to say thank you for getting Gabriel.  I am not sure whether anyone else would have called him.”
Dean wasn’t sure whether it was the idea of Castiel’s taking off his sweatsuit bottoms in front of Dean, or hating to be seen as weak in front of him, but he could sense Castiel’s distress, as his shoulders tensed and the shaking increased.
For those of you that think Rowena's birth process is unrealistic - yeah maybe!   But it did happen very much like this for my friend, who didn't realise she was in labour, and delivered her baby at home in under 30 mins.
This story is complete, and I intend to upload a new chapter every 2 days.  (8 chapters and an epilogue.)
Walking past the receptionist, Castiel noticed how her eyes had widened as she saw them holding hands. He couldn’t help it as his Alpha postured slightly, straightening his back and raising his chin a little. He wasn’t about to tackle anyone that looked at Dean to the ground, but there was a definite protective, assertive stance.
“Cas, you better know now.  I have a filthy mind, and dirty mouth, and I want to use it on you.”  Dean nuzzled his neck, “I want to hear you moaning, and sighing, and begging, and screaming my name.  I want to know you like what we’re doing, and that I am the cause of it.”  From his position behind Castiel, Dean slid his hand down, stroking Castiel’s firm abs.   He paused as he reached Castiel’s groin, stopping just shy of touching his cock, and Castiel gasped slightly.  “May I touch you?” he asked softly.
“Look at me,” ordered Dean wanting to see Castiel’s reactions.  Castiel immediately looked directly at Dean, staring into his beautiful green eyes.  Castiel’s pupils were blown wide with lust, and longing.   “You’re amazing,” Dean said with conviction.
It hadn’t taken Alistair and his goons long to find the cabin.   It was situated a little ways off the main road, in a small break in the trees.   Dean’s car was parked in a layby about 100 yards from the property, which was only accessible on foot.  From the outside it looked like it was mainly a single room dwelling, with a small addition at the side, that was a bathroom.  As was common of properties in the area, it had a couple of steps that led up to a porch that stretched across the front of the cabin.  The bulk of the building being raised off the ground, to prevent damp from affecting all the timbers.   The cabin’s windows were illuminated from inside, but were obscured by curtains, preventing anyone looking in.   The metal chimney stack emitted a steady stream of smoke indicating a wood burning stove was in use.   Unfortunately, the cabin itself had seen better days.   It looked worn out and tired, despite the glow from the window.
Gabriel didn’t call him out on the hesitation around the word injured.   But set to work checking and icing Castiel’s ribs with the gel packs.
“I’m not sure if I should commend you for bravery or condemn you both for being so reckless,” she said shaking her head.
They recommenced their walk.   “Does he want help?” asked John.   “There’s only so much you can do if he won’t accept it.”
“More like ran down,” laughed Gordon.  The other boys joined in.  “You should have seen the look on his face.”
Once they were in town, it didn’t take Dean long to find a good parking spot.  He made a quick pin on his phone, to ensure he would find his way back to the car, and then indicated that they should make their way into the main part of town.
“I thought you might appreciate the gag,” said Alistair with an evil smile.  “I seem to remember that featuring in your little fantasy at the cabin.”
“You wish,” said Dean with glee.  “Although I bet there’ll be someone in jail that will be happy to make you their bitch.”
Wandering through the kitchen, then to the bedroom corridor, he paused as he saw Castiel’s jacket lying on the floor in the corridor.   Slightly further down was Dean’s plaid shirt.   He was about to retrieve it when he heard a deep muffled voice from Dean’s room moaning Dean’s name.
Hearing Castiel’s deep voice, pushed Dean over the edge. He arched his back and intensified his grip on Castiel, his mouth tightened, and he grunted through his orgasm as he came hard against Cas’s cock, his body going from rigid to shaking and spasming.
Regrettably, with Dean being grounded and having to drive Sammy home, this limited their options for meeting outside of school.   John’s presence at home was also hampering Dean’s ability to even phone Castiel, and instead once in bed they spent their evenings sending text after text message.
As he approached, he realised that it was indeed Cas, but a Cas he had never seen before. Cas was standing at the edge of the water, on a soft bed of sand. He was barefoot and almost naked, wearing only a loose pair of white cotton boxer shorts. Cas had his back to Dean, and Dean could see ripples of well defined muscles across his entire back and across his shoulders. Cas’s arms were well defined, with visible deep cords of tendons that strained as he moved. Dean dropped his gaze further down towards Cas’s firmly defined arse, and then down his thick sturdy legs. Even his ankles and feet looked toned. He had the physique of a marathon runner and Dean could see his Angel warding tattoo on his left side below his ribs. There was a slight glisten to the skin of sweat, which indicated Cas had been here some time.
"Let's go and build a fucking snowman," he said, putting an arm around both Cas and Kate's shoulders, the pointy carrot now worryingly close to Cas' eyeball. "Sam's just texted to say he and Eileen are on their way over, and it's been years since I've hit him in the face with a snowball. We can talk later, Cas."
"Cas," Dean chided gently. "You know we are. She's just projecting because she was so upset over losing you. She hugged you before she hit you - that counts for something, right?"
"Well, thank you for trusting me." Cas dropped a kiss on the top of Dean's head, burying his nose in his hair and inhaling deeply.
"Do you want me just to tell you what's inside it?" Amara asked, understanding and gentle. For a moment Dean wondered why they were fighting, why she was their enemy at all.
Cas eyed the bed, looking at it like it was a forbidden treasure in an Aladdin's cave. One touch of its wooden frame and the treasure would turn to lava around their feet and the ceiling would cave in on them.
"I nearly needed a whole new apartment!" Cas laughed, sounding a little breathy at what Dean assumed was just the mention of those sweatpants. He made up his mind to wear them to collect Cas at the airport when he finally got back.
At his jerky nod she placed the package on the ground again. "There is his wallet, with his credit card, ID, photos of Claire, Jack and you inside; the stuffed toy bee that you gave him for Christmas; a cellphone that has no charge left; and it's all wrapped up in a t-shirt of yours that he had borrowed. That's all they have returned of his. I can't tell you what they did with his body."
The concerned furrow between Dean's eyebrows disappeared and he grinned. Apparently this he could get with.
Dean rearranged the pillows along the back of his bed. Kicking off his boots, he got up and padded over to Cas, who had frozen awkwardly in the doorway.
Cas didn’t point out that some of his hunting trips weren’t very far off doing just that. Dean already knew and mentioning it wouldn’t help.
Quite honestly, Dean wouldn't have been surprised if Cas had days of the week underwear in there. He dug through the drawer, looking for the plainest, darkest boxers. He absolutely refused to have a large unicorn emblazoned on his ass, which, going by some of the pairs he was already seeing, was a distinct possibility.
"No they won't. And if they do, let them. If I can't be here for you when you need me, what's the point of me?"
What would it take to make Cas realise he was being romanced? It turned out that making napkin dicks would do it. Dean felt laughter bubbling back up again.
He felt a pang of sorrow at the thought of Jack. Aching, guilty and just overwhelmingly sad, he knew that he'd destroyed the relationship he had with the boy he loved like a son. But Jack had been wrong, and it was Dean's
“She’s only got six months left, and then she'll be working with the children full time,” Cas said conversationally.
Being with Cas again was a mixed blessing. In one way his presence was always like a soothing balm to his soul, making him feel calm, less angry, less on edge. But at the same time it was pure torture not to be able to touch him, kiss him, and he was sure Cas felt the same way. He’d seen him sneaking glances at him, he’d heard the catches in his breath when they’d touched. He wasn’t imagining it - Cas wasn’t as unaffected as he was pretending.
The words were threatening, but Cas could sense absolutely no power in him, no danger at all. Maybe they
"Is this a private hug or can anyone join in?" Sam had pulled himself together and was striding down the hallway towards them, his long arms outstretched hopefully.
"I lost a friend," Dean said, his voice more gravelly than usual. "It made me re-evaluate, made me… made me realise some things. Although it took me a while to admit everything to myself, my priorities changed and stayed changed."
Cas couldn't argue with that. The beautiful wooden panelling of the walls overlapped and gave the house that cabin in the woods kind of feel, despite it being very much a two story house complete with warm red slate roof and old fashioned latticed windows criss-crossed with beautiful patterns in black lead. Two of the windows were cracked and one was broken entirely, but it was easy to see how lovely it would have looked before it was abandoned.
He clung to Dean, his hands seeming to move on their own, sliding under Dean's t-shirt, feverishly mapping his back and feeling the hot skin under his hands, the way Dean’s muscles moved under his fingers as he pressed into him again and again. Cas pulled Dean even harder to him, arching against him, letting his fingers explore and tease. He dug his nails in when Dean licked the roof of his mouth, making Dean instinctively and uncontrollably buck his hips against Cas.
"What Eileen and I have," Sam said, his voice shaking in tightly coiled, barely suppressed anger, "is
Suddenly nervous, his stomach twisting with a strange feeling of apprehension that even he didn't understand, he tried to think of what song to start with. He'd never done this before, although lots of people, mainly women, had asked him to sing to them, he'd always said it was soft and a little bit corny. He didn't even have his guitar to hide behind, although maybe doing it in the dark would be easier. Oh God, this was harder than he'd thought it would be.
"It's not just that I'll have to face my dad again. It's not even that part of me wants the wife, the house, the kids and barbecues in the backyard, because I can't have that either way. I can't be with
"No," Dean shook his head, unable to tear his eyes away from Cas as he laughed at something Kate was saying, without looking away from Dean. "I'm really not."
Dean swallowed hard, the fact that Cas wanted to be guided through giving him a blowjob was such a tempting idea that he almost gave in. I might just be worth it for the entire sixty seconds he would last.
When a sob finally escaped from his throat it was painfully loud. It seemed to echo around the Bunker and Cas flinched at the sound of it, fearful that their friends would hear and come up, and how would they explain this? He could scarcely explain it to himself.
"I'm not sure how you'd want me tied. A bed would seem most convenient, but then if you just tied my arms behind my back, you could have me on my knees for you."
If looks could kill, Sam would be sprawled over the table on top of his ruined Monopoly game, clutching at his chest. As it was, Cas had to settle for his most venomous glare as he strode from the room after Dean, answering what had very obviously been a summons.
Yeah, that didn't help. At all. Because what felt right to Dean was pinning Cas to this exquisitely soft mattress of his and kissing him until he forgot how much Dean had screwed up, until it was like it had never happened. And he knew that wasn't what Cas wanted or needed from him.
She squeezed his shoulder, her long nails digging into his skin through his thin t-shirt. Once upon a time, before he fell in love with Cas, he might have enjoyed the sensation—now it just irritated him.
Cas got to his feet, grumbling under his breath the entire time. He was pretty disgusting at this point, he had to admit.
“Cas, I’d be the first person to say she’s sus, but you’ve spent tonight kind of out of it,” he closed the door behind him. “And Kate has kids, a job, a shitty ex husband…"
"I don't think even Dean knows what's wrong," Sam sighed, covering the extra pancakes in case Dean wanted them later.
"Yeah. The guys were wanting to play in some other venues too and see if we could get a bit of a name for ourselves." Dean had told them they'd need to find a new front man, and they'd been on his case ever since.
Cas knew the second the words left Chuck's lips that they hadn't been aimed at him. He turned slowly, his eyes falling on the drawn face of the only man he'd ever been in love with, the only
"What is it?" Dean asked dubiously, lifting the lid of the bun to peer suspiciously at what was apparently a burger inside.
Distracting him from that though, was a much more immediate worry. Cas and Kate were playing pool together, laughing and chatting—touching far more than was necessary for a game of pool. Despite seeing Kate regularly since he'd moved into Cas' apartment, Dean still felt like something was off about her. He knew it was mostly jealousy, but he just couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't quite being upfront with them.
“Chuck?” suggested Dean through gritted teeth. His knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel tightly while the wind whipped and buffeted Baby. The storm around them had got worse far more quickly than any normal earthly storm ever would have and thunder had started, rolling like an angry God in the skies. Dean swallowed hard. The lightning in the air was making the hair on his arms stand up as it crackled around them.
The garden surrounded the house, overgrown, wild and barely constrained by picket fencing. Rose bushes grew against the walls, dormant for the winter, half smothered under weeds, and Cas had a sudden urge to dig them free, uncover them and make them beautiful again.
"I'm sorry about Sam. He'll come round when he realises we weren't deliberately leaving him out. I think we should probably apologise to Eileen."
“I’m so sorry that I abandoned you,” Cas murmured, pressing his nose into Dean’s hair, trying to hold back from placing kisses on his hairline. “I knew that it was the one thing you couldn’t handle, and you’re right - I panicked. I told myself that our friendship was over, that it was ruined, and I didn’t even let you speak. I rejected myself on your behalf, and then I left you and told myself that it was what you wanted. Whether I could hear your prayers or not, I should have trusted you. I’m a fool. I hurt you. I did this to you, and I didn’t even realise.”
"You won't lose him at all this way!" Cas didn't have time to reassure Sam, to argue with Jack. The sky was full of flash after flash of lightning, thunder rolling and growling constantly like a warning from an angry dog. A fork of lightning hit a tree that was so close to them Dean could smell the ozone in the air, the acrid smoke as the branches were instantly scorched. Cas turned to Dean urgently.
Dean pulled back, looking at Cas intently. His eyes were bloodshot and swollen, his eyelashes spiked wet with tears. He looked so lost and so heartbreakingly beautiful. Cas had wanted to kiss Dean so many times over the years, but right now he didn’t just want to, he felt like he
Cas pulled Dean even closer to him, planting a kiss somewhere near his ear, then on his neck, then in his hair. A hum of pleasure vibrated in Dean's throat and his fingers spasmed, clenching in Cas' hair and against his back.
Cas hesitated, taking in Dean's mistreated, bitten lip, his fingers twisting together nervously, the way he couldn't hold eye contact; his gaze darting off to look at the TV, the coffee table, Nigel.
Cas felt the now familiar mix of relief at saying the words out loud, and the all consuming ache that he assumed came with all unrequited love.
"Hey, I can cook! I'm a good cook!" Dean argued. "Just because you haven't tried my cooking, Mr 'Everything Tastes of Molecules' doesn't mean I'm not good at it."
"Thank you," he said sincerely, trying to get a world of meaning into those two words. Then he smiled a crooked, half smile. "I put yours in your room earlier today for the exact same reason. It turns out that gift giving is actually quite terrifying."
"Yes, fine. Life has been more than a little frustrating and now I'm hard as a fucking rock, and I'd like to take care of that before drinking myself into oblivion."
Putting the remains of the pie on the bedside table, Dean propped himself up on his elbow and slowly trailed his fingers over Cas' jaw, gazing down at him like he was his absolute everything—and he is.
"Light, dark - it doesn't matter. My brother was filled with light and look at the evil he did. I'm not killing you because I am
Although impossible to see from a distance, when he was this close to Dean, Cas could count every tiny freckle on his face. He had hundreds of them, each one utterly perfect. Cas took in the rough stubble of his jaw, his dark messy hair, his lashes that were long, almost feminine in their length. Then there were his lips, parted in his sleep, that looked too soft, too vulnerable to belong to a man so strong.
“I don’t know if I'd want you if I wasn’t with him,” Dean sighed. He’d had women who had refused to take no as an answer before, but this was on another level and felt like it was so out of the blue. “But the point is I
Obviously in similar need of Dutch courage, Dean had got to his feet, grabbing a bottle of Wild Turkey that was sitting on his bedside table. He half filled two tumblers with the amber liquid, handing one to Cas who was careful to not let their fingers brush.
As his eyes landed on the man standing at the front of the stage, Cas felt like the ground had shifted under his feet. Dean wasn't looking at him - there were too many people in between them and he was obviously pretty lost in his own world as he sang. Both hands were on the microphone, enjoyment on his face as he belted out the words to a song that was unfamiliar to Cas. The crowd danced, cheered, sang along, all somehow still carrying on, unaware that Cas' entire world had come to a standstill.
forced on him," Dean snapped and hope bloomed in Cas'. Chest that Dean cared enough about him to defend him. "Get up so we can end this."
Dean was on his feet almost instantly, reaching into his discarded pile of clothes for the ever present angel blade, caring far more about his defence than his nudity,
in love with him!" Dean couldn't even bring himself to say Cas' name and Cas wished he could curl in on himself and hide away from all of this, to pretend it wasn't happening. Hearing the disgust in Dean's voice as he denied loving him broke something in him, and he felt doors battering down, his heart withdrawing, hiding away. But even that didn't stop the hurt.
"We were planning on doing our usual for it - nothing. Zero. Zip." Sam looked perplexed. "Why? Do you want to do something for it this year?"
Cas came out of his bedroom now wearing a ridiculously brightly coloured sweater with a Christmas tree on the front. The tree was decorated with raised baubles that actually lit up, each individual circle a different flashing colour.
"We have terrible timing," Cas agreed. "Although I'm not sure I could actually move right now. Or possibly ever again."
"Dad would leave us in Motel rooms that were paid up for the week, and he'd fuck off for three, four weeks at a time. I had to find money to pay for it, or Sammy would have been sleeping on park benches. I didn't want to do any of it. I swear to you, Cas. I didn't."
Fabulous - now he needed to urinate. How useless was a body that demanded you drink copious amounts of fluid for survival, only to then issue urgent orders for you to expel it all again? As Dean would say,
"Lovely. Well then, you'll have plenty to do in Hell if you end up there, which you won't. What's all this about, Dean?"
Only when Cas’s entire body was trembling and thrusting back against his fingers with little helpless jerks, did Dean finally stop, removing his fingers and wiping them heedlessly on his discarded t-shirt, before gently encouraging Cas onto his back again. Dean pulled him up to kiss him thoroughly, noting how different Cas’ kisses were now—languid, messy, nothing held back at all, his mouth opening instantly and so easily under Dean’s that it felt almost like a surrender.
"Are you saying that my love is cheap and tacky?!" Eileen clutched at her chest dramatically. "How could you?!"
Dean crossed the room in two strides and then his arms were wrapped around him so tightly that Cas genuinely wondered if he would crack his ribs. The body pressed against his was trembling - not like the needy, desperate trembles he'd felt before, these shudders weren't pleasant, weren't needy. These were his body trying so hard not to fall apart, to not let even one tensed muscle relax and calm.
Their hands found each other, and they intertwined, tangled, locked—whatever it was, they weren't coming undone any time soon. Cas clung to him. If this was all he could have, he would hold on to it. He'd never let go.
"I like my own bed. I'll give you a text later." He allowed himself to draw a sliver of comfort from being in her arms as they wrapped around him in a goodbye hug. She smelled of fading perfume and some sort of apple scented shampoo that she used all the time. It was warm and familiar, and he wished he could just break down and bury his face in her sweet smelling hair and just be comforted, but even holding himself together this long was agonising. He had to go.
The sky was shining the kind of bright blue that made you think of summer holidays, lazy days and ice creams. It was the perfect colour to go with the perfect temperature - just hot enough that Dean had an excuse to wind down his window and hang his arm out, his fingers tapping along with the music against the outside of the car door. He knew he looked like a poser when he did this, but this was Heaven and he was damn well going to do whatever made him happy.
Cas took a step forward, then another, then another. If he couldn't explain to Dean with his words, he was going to show him. He backed Dean into the counter with his hips and gaze alone, then lifted his hand to run one finger down Dean's stubble covered cheek and chin. Dean's eyes fell closed, his lashes fluttering, a shiver coursing through his body even at that small caress.
He needed this, and if Sam begrudged him it, well, screw him. Screw Sam and his perfect life and his awesome soon-to-be wife. They had no freakin' idea what it was like to be in his head all the time with no escape. They had no idea what it was like to want what they had, but to know he would never be able to have it.
"How could anyone resist that?" Cas deadpanned, breaking into the toothbrush packaging and padding over to the sink.
"Dean," Cas murmured into his hair. "I had no idea. You should never have had to do any of that. No one should. Your father - did he know?"
"If I'd wanted you all dead I would have done it a long time ago." She looked over at Dean, her expression softening.
Of course they were proud of Sammy—what parent wouldn't be? Beautiful wife, lovely home, well on the way to passing the bar and becoming some hotshot lawyer. He was smart and decent and kind, and Dean was so proud of him that he had teared up more than once today, watching him marry the woman he loved, finally getting the happy ending he deserved after such a shit start in life.
"You know, I've been thinking of investing some money in buying a house," Sam admitted. "We're going to want to start a family at some point soon, and I'd like any kid we have to have a yard to play in and actual windows in their room."
"It doesn't have to be a big thing," Dean added. "But a celebration would be nice after all the shit we've been through."
"Tell me we're going to be out of here before the strippers go home for their breakfast!" Dean retorted, offering no comfort at all.
Kate took in a sudden, sharp breath, taken aback. However suspicious Dean had felt about her motivations, however much he felt like Kate was that little bit too much, that little bit too present in their lives, he hadn’t been this curt with her since the first time he’d met her, sitting at that table with Cas in the restaurant below them.
Cas grinned and Dean grinned back, both beaming like idiots at each other over Garth’s head until Kate appeared, hooking her arms around both Cas and Dean’s waists, pulling them in.
"You think this is a tragic love story? I think this is the greatest love story ever told. Because it's one that you didn't write - it's one that came into being
Of course he was bisexual. Cas had always known Dean was bisexual. Everyone who ever read the Carver Edlund
"I get that your new epiphany, courtesy of Chuck, means you're now perpetually straight, or perhaps you're just so ashamed that you had sex with me that our friends knowing has rendered you unable to-"
"I'm not going anywhere, Cas. I told you, I'm not that selfless. It's been a long time since I've cared enough to not just throw myself on the pyre on the off-chance, but I won't, okay? I promise."
"This isn't one of your stories, Chuck. It's not as if I saw Dean Winchester and a chorus of birds started singing. We don't live in a Disney movie."
He looked closely at Cas' face and received a shaky smile in return. Cas tried to control it, clamping his bottom lip tightly between his teeth.
“What do you mean, apparently? He’s either in The Empty or he’s here and free, right? I haven’t seen him once over the years, and there have been a few times I’ve prayed to him just in case he could hear me.”
His parents were towards the back of the room, partially obscured by a group of people he didn’t recognise and dressed in clothes that they had obviously borrowed at the last minute for the occasion. Call it paranoia, but Dean felt that he could sense them following his gaze each time he glanced back to where the man who only hours earlier had been asleep in his arms was sitting rather stiffly next to Kate.
Sam threw Dean a pained look. “Alright. Yeah. I’m sorry, Dean. I just need you to know that I’m grateful, okay? It’s not enough. I know it isn’t enough, but I am.”
"Me? It's you guys who seem to have brought me here for my execution." Chuck coughed, drops of blood hitting Cas's boots. Cas guessed that a broken rib had speared his lung and he tried to stamp down on his sense of the wrongness of it all. If no one came to save Chuck he would use the last of his Grace to heal him the best he could. He would give his last connection to Heaven up entirely to make sure he didn't die, because even
Most of their friends who had been sitting around the table were already on their feet. Warriors in their own unique ways, they were all squaring up to the short, bearded man who was standing awkwardly in the centre of the room, arm raised in a wave, a half smile on his face.
With a horrified expression on her face, woman and dog disappeared inside, where their ears would be safe from Dean's casual depravity. Dean raised his eyes sheepishly to meet the narrowed ones belonging to the owner of the aforementioned ass.
Cas smiled, staring off into the distance for so long that it took the arrival of Dean's huge sharing platter of desserts to bring him out if it.
Dean's laugh turned to a choke as Cas slid another finger into him, stretching him slowly and gently, ignoring his impatience.
Out of the corner of his eye, Cas watched Dean finally getting up off the ground, dusting off his jeans and then looking around the room as if searching for something or someone. His gaze fell on Cas and a small smile played over his lips. Cas felt his own face breaking into a grin in response and then Dean was gone again, into the kitchen this time to help the other Sam.
While half drunk, alone and in the relative safety of the privacy of his bedroom, Dean could admit that there had always been a connection between him and Cas, something that had burned white hot between them from the first moment they had met. It had only burned brighter once Dean had got to know Cas, when he'd realised that he admired him, liked him, missed him whenever he wasn't there.
"Dean, put the lighter down. Step away from the can." Sam moved slowly towards him like a he was approaching a suicide bomber. "Let's talk about this."
be with me." Cas' words were unemotional, steady, his control instantly back in place. Dean couldn't read him now and for some reason it made his heart clench in his chest.
"Alright," Cas nodded, pulling up his jeans and fastening his belt with fingers that were starting to turn numb from the cold. He looked at Dean who was grimacing in discomfort at the stickiness of his skin against the cotton of his boxers.
"It's nothing serious. I'd have bandaged it better, but it's very difficult to dress a wound with only one hand."
"You misunderstand me. I meant free of The Empty, not free to roam Earth. The moment Jack became God, he wanted to rebuild. Heaven, Hell, Purgatory - it's all been changed. Most people who are sent to Hell are put in cages now, like they were in Heaven before. Memory cages where, depending how good or evil they were, depending on how well they've redeemed themselves, they are left to play out their best or worst memories for Eternity. A few are free to roam Hell - Rowena and Crowley make those choices together, although last I heard, they were still fighting like cat and dog over every decision."
Then, like a storm-cloud appearing in the sky, almost instantly the smile left Cas' face, his expression darkening, his body tensing in the same way it always did when demons were present and he was readying himself for a fight. Dean frowned and turned to see what had caught his attention.
The room got slowly hotter and hotter, and Dean had rolled his cuffs up, for once not having a t-shirt under his shirt to strip down to. Cas seemed to finally be feeling the heat too, and he leaned back in his chair, fanned his face with his napkin (which Dean had rather ambitiously tried to fold into a swan for the occasion). He then proceeded to unbutton not one, not two, but three buttons.
“You reading my mind again, Cas?” he said, clearing his throat as the words came out thick and wrong.
Thank you so much to my long-suffering husband, my long suffering Masonic and my newly suffering Annstarrr for all the editing and help 🥰
The suspicion towards Kate that had been gnawing at him for so long was finally let loose, set free by his fury over anyone daring to put Cas in danger.
"I had my wings seared off so I couldn't come back - I'd hardly call that choosing to leave you in the lurch."
How Cas managed to avoid him every time he went to the Lake House, Dean wasn't quite sure. He suspected that he was using his remaining Grace to check where he was before he visited, because Cas was definitely going there too. He was bringing supplies, helping Gabriel and Balthazar, he had even left some clothes and toiletries there for the times he'd stayed over. Yet somehow every time Dean arrived he was greeted with, "Oh, you just missed Castiel!"
be consequences.” Without anyone touching it, the apartment door slammed behind her, hard enough to rattle the windows and make Dean flinch.
"I've never seen someone go from straight to gay with quite such speed." Sam was watching them with undisguised fascination.
"Yeah, but you didn't come to me with a halo and fluffy white wings. You came to me all electricity, explosions and '
Dean groaned and dragged his hands down his face. He was meant to be distracting himself from Cas, not making it worse.
Dean absolutely couldn't do this. He was so tightly wound that he felt like he'd snap at any moment. Operation Friendship Fix was a go! And what did two manly men need to eat to bond over? Steak. So Dean had bought the two biggest, juiciest, most expensive steaks he could find, and then he'd busied himself making his own home-made peppercorn sauce and his famous chunky fries.
Cas quickly acclimatised himself. While the sloping walls were all made of dark wood, the place itself was bright  and airy at the front where there were large windows. At the back, where Cas preferred to hide away, it was dark, private and felt safe and calming - something he needed while he licked his wounds.
"It’s the ultimate punishment,” Cas admitted. “It was used in the past to humiliate the very worst of the traitors.”
Cas was at least replying to his texts, but there was tension there. A forced lightness that didn't feel real. He was still talking to Sam normally though, and it was through Sam that Dean found out Cas was coming over for a board game night. Trying not to think too hard about it, Dean couldn't help but read into it that Cas could cope with being around him as long as he had a chaperone so that Dean didn’t jump his bones. Which was fair enough really, Dean did have previous.
The thought was still echoing in his head as he watched his parents move away from Eileen to a group of older hunters they knew from way back when. Almost instantly, John was holding court, the centre of the group, all eyes on him. Even Mary, who in her own right was a strong, confident, charismatic woman, faded into the background as her husband talked, her smile adoring, eyes not leaving his face. She had always been different around him, as far as Dean remembered—meaker.
“Kate,” Dean hissed. “This man has commanded fucking armies. He watched the world being created, watched evolution happen, watched the dinosaurs become extinct—he helped God himself create the physics that makes rainbows happen, for Christ sake. I
"I…" What could he say to that? How could he hurt Cas again? "I'll try harder, Cas. I promise. If it means that much to you, I'll try."
"I'm used to you. But I need you to be on form later, remember? Stop drinking. In fact, do you have a glass of water?"
"No, I didn't think it did. It was just hard to dress properly one handed, and I didn't want to leave you all waiting."
Chuck stepped closer to Cas, and Dean tensed, moving threateningly between them, protectiveness for the former Angel in his stance and in every tensed muscle.
"I suspected it when my wings were burned off," Cas replied, looking anywhere but at Dean. "Jack made a lot of mistakes, but he was never cruel. Never vindictive. Then when I realised how much I'd been pushed away from going to Dean, it made a lot of sense. I wasn't sure though, but some friends dropped in one night while I was here and they confirmed some theories - Dean only knew after that."
Dean's face immediately lit up, as it did any time anyone mentioned his achievement. He pulled the soft cotton over his head, looking so pleased that Cas couldn't bring himself to begrudge the now obstructed view of Dean's chest. He could always pull it back off later.
"Some people don't if they're sure they'll be rejected, and it's obvious you and Dean only have eyes for each other. But when you and Dean were practically making out while dancing at Christmas, that was not a woman who was uninterested in what was happening."
Cas followed him the rest of the way down the hall and into the bedroom. Dean dropped onto the bed, quickly shutting his laptop before the screen saver could reveal what was hidden underneath it.
ring, “Hey Dad.  Yeah, not at school at the moment.  No, Sammy’s fine.   Er, something else kinda came up…..”
Dean would swear to his dying day, that Cas smile at that moment was brighter than a supernova. "I think I would like that Dean." He paused for a moment and then reached up to kiss Dean's ear before breathing into it, "However your brother has returned home from a run, and is likely to want the shower, perhaps we can relocate to your room?"
Watching as Gabriel proficiently assessed and treated the injuries, “That one looks close to his kidney,” said Dean quietly, pointing to bruise in the shape of a boot print on Castiel’s left side and he rested another pack on the spot.  Castiel winced.   “If he’s pissing blood, he’ll need a doctor.”
As they continued their walk, Cas realised that Dean was leading them to a very specific part of the bunker grounds. When they rounded the corner of a well trodden path, he saw several cushions and blankets had been carefully prepared in a secluded area. A picnic hamper and a portable beer cooler was also waiting for them.
Grimacing slightly, Gabriel said, “I wish it was just sleeping, and I don’t really want to hear my brother, shall we say ‘active’, but yes.  If you want to stay here with him, you can.”
Dean lowered the weapon and grimaced in repulsion at the miserable excuse for a human that lay in front of him.   “You aren’t even worth a bullet.”
“It was ….” Castiel hesitated, trying to calm himself. “It was requested and welcomed. You know I would never … Not another person’s mate.”
There were several gasps from the rest of the class, and the sound of desperately flicked pages.   Someone towards the back coughed loudly unsuccessfully covering the utterance of the word “nerd.”
Laughing Jon indicates to his partner. “That’s what I said to my hubby Brad here on my first and second, but this is our third.” Jon broke off as a contraction hit. Brad started rubbing Jon’s back to comfort him.
Almost like a cartoon, Castiel could see Sam’s hackles rise, as he stood up to his full height, rolling his shoulders back, staring at Castiel. “What?” he said coldly.
Dean lay there for a moment thinking back to that moment; the pleasure and ecstasy of Cas taking him, all of him in his mouth.
Castiel whined in disappointment and frustration, as Dean continued to push and stretch his rim.   Just when Castiel thought he wouldn’t be able to stand anymore teasing, Dean removed his fingers, and raised himself to his knees between Castiel’s thighs.   Looking down at the dishevelled man, lying open and exposed to him, Dean felt an immense wave of desire rush through him.    He nudged forward slightly, gripping his own cock, and gave it a couple of strokes, to add some lube from his fingers to it.
“So back to Cas.  What do you think?  As of Monday let’s crowd him, be his friends, and not let him give us no for an answer,” said Lee.  “Even if he doesn’t sit with us, we’ll just make sure we’re close by.”
