John took a shallow breath before reaching over to a metal table, taking a pair of disposable gloves and slipping them on easily. He walked over to the sedated man, viewing over him before accessing the problem area. His thigh.
“I’m up to the task, sir” Watson replied as they pushed past everyday people, their whispers flooding his head as they exited the building, finding a black car quickly pulling up outside the station.
“I don’t think it should be removed, he’ll more than likely die from blood loss…” John informed, seeing the reflective surface of the bullet penetrated deeply in the thigh, though there was a part that didn’t reflect. Was it a risk to delve in and try to find what it was? A hundred percent, but if this was a case of evidence, he truly had no choice.
“Hello? Dr. John Watson speaking?” He spoke, seeing the familiar name on the phone when he answered. He heard a gasp behind him, a real one, not a thought made one. “Oh, Mrs. Arrold, what a surprise, how are you?” He questioned, light conversation continuing. “He’s walking! That’s incredible! I didn’t expect the bullet wound to be so severe, it seemed like a usual procedu-, oh, he tried walking on it” He chuckled as he felt a presence behind him as the train came a halting screech. “This has been a lovely conversation, Mrs. Arrold, but I must leave, thank you, okay, bye, bye, bye-bye-bye” He repeated as he hung up, and jumping when there was a tap on his shoulder.
“H-How did you know I have a wife?” The soldier questioned, he was panicked, and exhausted. “You said she’d be...disappointed...no matter, we’ll supply you with a pair of crutches for your departure” Watson informed and made his way past various doctors and nurses who scurried around as he approached a rack of medical supplies, crutches by the nearest wall.
“Highly...functioning...sociopath” A disgruntled voice interrupted, and Watson peeped at the man by the window, Holmes, as he spoke. He remained with his back turned.
His hand took a hold of the cold metal and he held them close to his chest, walking past the nurses and doctors.
John tried to ignore the peering eyes. He hadn’t had such a crowd watch him work in years, he simply went on as he would any other procedure.
“Dr Watson, great to meet you, Greg Lestrade, detective inspector for New Scotland Yard” The man introduced himself, letting go of his hand as he guided the two men into the hospital.
“I didn’t expect you to actually retrieve something” The Sherlock character muttered, taking one of the disposable gloves John had put on the table and using it to pick up the laminated paper, which he shielded from being seen by Donovan.
“Will I be able to walk, Doc?” The soldier asked, his sweat dripping into his hairline, black hair glistening against the bright sun that shone through the tent’s seams. “Maybe not for five or six months, sir” Watson replied and saw all light leave the soldier’s face. “You may be sent back to England on medical leave” He delivered the news slowly and watched as the soldier tried to rise, grunting as he did.
“Thank you for helping us, we appreciate it a great load” Lestrade smiled at him, releasing his hand and proceeding to push past Donovan to peer at the letter, Sherlock holding it above his head as he seemed to study the letter intensely, the voices emitting from him becoming distorted, and working incredibly fast. Soon enough, he placed it back down on the metal table and turned to look at Watson, eyes narrowing and scanning over him before he let a short ‘hm’ pass his lips.
He stood reading the information when suddenly the curtain was opened viciously, causing him to almost jump from his skin. He turned around and found himself face to face...or more face to chest with the man who was in their presence, in obvious shock.
‘Where am I going to find a doctor on short notice...oh no, this is terrible!’ The voice exclaimed, the large man pulling his shirt sleeve over his watch, Watson couldn’t help but let out a tiny snicker. A doctor was simply a feet away, and maybe it was coincidence...or karma that he got a phone call.
“Does there need to be a doctor, immediately?” Watson raised an eyebrow and Stannford nodded quickly, “One moment” He added.
“Thanks? I guess” Watson responded, hearing the door of the room open, and the familiar figure of Lestrade enter past the curtains, noticing the bloodied, laminated paper in Sherlock’s gloved hand.
The soldier wobbled on the crutches, being directed by Watson to where they had a care unit, where he’d rest until he was given a plane back to England. With the situation explained to a nurse, Watson went on to the next patient, however he was incredibly bewildered as to what those voices were.
John Watson found himself bandaging the wounded leg of a soldier, the soldier was gripping onto the arm of the torn leather chair. Profanities slipped by his lips as smooth as butter, and Watson managed to ignore his constant grunts and just get to work on keeping the wound from getting any oxygen, his hand forcing pressure upon it.
“Whatever” Donovan responded as she placed a hand on Watson’s shoulder to guide him past the curtain.
“Quite a nasty one” He muttered, perhaps not the most reassuring, it was a bullet through the calf, nothing fatal but certainly unpleasant. The soldier groaned and jolted half-heartedly as he pressed the bandaged down tightly to his leg.
“I’m deeply sorry, but thank you for your service so far” Watson replied and watched as it seemed the soldier’s eyes seemed watery.
John listened to Stannford, he rambled on about this Sherlock character, he seemed interesting enough but by the way he was being described seemed biased. Maybe he just didn’t get along with Stannford. He listened to his rambling half-heartedly, not truly paying attention so he showed his disinterest by simply beginning a new conversation topic. As they talked, with awkward tension, the car came to a slow stop, and the driver announced this was their destination; New Royal London Hospital.
“You’re telling me, Doc” The soldier’s voice was deep and gravelly, certainly tired, on the brink of exhaustion. Watson looked up at the soldier for a brief moment, his hand was over his eyes, fingers gripping his temples tightly. Watson finally removed his hand from the bandage, sealing it down and looking around it.
A trip home on a train seemed like a simple enough task to just...well, get home. However, after a man stops Watson in his tracks, he finds himself on a journey to extract evidence for New Scotland Yard.
‘My wife will be so disappointed’ The faint voice cried, and while the soldier had no tears, the voice appeared to be crying. “Your wife will be thankful for you serving thus far” He added, glancing to the man’s fingers, he had no ring.
“Apologies, Watson” The man said without care, not even turning to look at him before turning to stare at the body of the man.
He remembered the concentrate as an increasingly loud voice pierced his ears, it came from behind him, from the other detective. He ignored it, however, placing the tweezers down on the table and proceeded to disinfect the wound, hearing the shuffle of feet around him, and the muttered quarrel between the woman and man.
“Unlike you, Sally, I have the respect to not jack off another woman’s husband” The detective retorted, resentment spitting off his lips at the visibly appalled woman.
‘It’s just like Afghanistan, but with English people, in nicely dressed clothes, and there are no bomb threats, and it’s cloudy outside, and...focus!’.
Sherlock is rescued from answering by the cry of the door. A young woman rushes inside; she is a flurry of brown hair and crackling laboratory coat and pinched lips and worry. She jerks to a stop at the rail of the hospital bed, and the man lifts a hand to the small of her back, making a soft hushing sound from the back of his throat. Is she his wife?
Every patient is a memory. Every pale new face, every heartbeat, every shuddering breath, is another glimpse back to the war hospital on the front. John sees a bullet wound and a thousand more surface to his memory. The sun beats down on his head and he tastes dust and blood. He has come to prefer the latter because the dust dries his lips, which are already cracked so much that it hurts him to smile. He sees a shattered rib and hears the abandoned soldier pillowed on the scorching sand crying for water. He feels his own canteen heavy at his belt; he struggles against the hands that hold him back.
“I’ll go ask for Watson right now,” she says eventually. “I spotted him moping about in the waiting room not half an hour ago.”
; it was a pain to transpose to the violin, but it’s lovely, soft, the impression of sound, little more. Suitable, all things considered. He imagines the notes flowing from the bow, through the window, winding through the night, sinuous and colorful, ribbons of sound.  The soft clatter of John’s keyboard rises into the air to join them, homey and plodding, unremarkable. It’s a nice symphony.
Then, from somewhere very, very distant (and at once acute: he is being shaken, he realizes, at the shoulders), a sound:
They met some time ago. They shared the flat on Baker Street. This was back when John walked with a cane and was reluctant to join Sherlock. His leg improved and his attitude changed. He smiled more often; he went through some number of girlfriends. They were never married.
She surveys him for a long moment. Her hair is bright red, obviously from a bottle. Her mouth is thin and determined. There is a spray of freckles across her nose. Dark shadows beneath her eyes. Unmarried. A strong and exhausted woman.
John picks up his pen and is absorbed in his paperwork when the knock comes. Four punctuating raps. Sharp knuckles. He stands up and takes great pains to move slowly. At long last he opens the door and smiles pleasantly.
“I know, Sherlock.” Irene’s voice is sharp enough to draw blood. “And she exhibited them all, didn’t she?”
“Interesting,” he murmurs as the liquid in the test tube strengthens to a vivid orange. And then John is at his side, peering over his shoulder. He smells like curiosity and for a moment Sherlock dreads that he will ask a stupid question. He will not be sure how to react if John asks a stupid question.
Sally was prettier at uni. She used to smile and play with her hair. She was interesting, too, but she wasn’t interested. She didn’t look at men. Sherlock didn’t look at women. She studied criminal law and he studied cocaine; the other subjects were dull, and it was nice to be able to control reality for an instant. They fell in love. People laughed approvingly. It became a great joke. Sherlock was so cold and Sally was so determined that their bed was popularly likened to a block of ice.
He is bent over a microscope. Long spiderlike fingers—pale. A girl is with him. He is not curious about John; no darts of silver fly out from beneath his fingernails when he takes his phone, turning it over in his palm.
“I know. I have no desire to place such a blame on anyone, let alone Sherlock. Let’s please not forget that I love him as dearly as you do.”
“Three years. Three years and you have the…” His shoulders tense, and he’s grabbing Sherlock’s collar, screaming. “Three years and you have the goddamn
John looks at him with tired eyes. Another silence. Then Sherlock releases him. They do not need words. John Watson is a doctor. A doctor and nothing else. Death opened him up and tore through his insides and clumsily sewed him back together long ago. He eft nothing in his wake. John Watson is a doctor and nothing else and he will serve his duty until the end. He has no other choice. There is nothing left for him. He is the loneliest man in the world. He has accepted his fate.
The little girl is dead. Her body is still warm. The little girl is dead and her body is still warm. It is her wrist. Her wrist is warm in the circle of his index finger and thumb. Warm but silent. The song of her pulse has ended but the last chord still echoes through her body. Warmth in the beat of the blood. Warmth in the slowing tempo. Warmth in the rhythm through her veins. The metronome clicks to a stop. They were the first to hear. She was usually so still that the nurses would not give a second thought if her bed were to fall silent.
John has to kiss him then, tangling his fingers in his hair and sighing in relief as Sherlock kisses back, parts his lips and tries to say John’s name once, softly, before letting himself be pressed back against the pillows. They lie there for a long time, kissing and running their hands over each other and breaking away to breathe against each other’s skin which lives with color. Eventually they tire, and it’s John’s turn to lean his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, smiling as the thick cords of blue swirl up their arms and disappear beneath their shirtsleeves again and again, as Sherlock reaches for his hand and inhales once, deeply, exhaling in a way that is very, very full. John closes his eyes, and they sit in silence together for a measureless time.
“You little shit!” He slapped Sherlock with the clean hand. The sting and the taste of the blood were overwhelming. The rain bit into his cheek.  Sherlock started to cry. The older boy sneered.
“Fantastic,” gasps John eventually. “Just fantastic. I really should have known better. Of course it was nothing but an experiment to you. No, not even that. Only you would keep amnesia a secret for fun, Sherlock. You were just doing what you thought was expected. You were playing a part. It was a game. We were playing charades like children. Nothing about it was real. Terrific.” He stands. There is blood on his palms. The sound of human voices erupts into the air and he glances over his shoulder. “The police. We will need to go to the hospital. You can barely sit up. I’ll go say hello.”
Sherlock looks at him, then, and there is something in his eyes that makes John think it’s starting, it’s starting, god help him, nothing can stop it now.
He can hear Molly hesitate. It is a tense sound. Eventually she lets up on her lower lip. There is lipstick on her teeth. Poor girl. She quietly admits that he is right.
“You know that's impossible to measure. It defies scientific means. You can’t know for sure. You simply can’t.”
“Just tea.” He reaches for his phone. No new cases. Opens the laptop. Nothing. He tugs unhappily at his dressing gown and curls into his chair and waits. John crosses the sitting room. He’s rolled up his sleeves and he smells like soap and his eyes are soft. Sherlock looks away.
Or at least as far as Sherlock is aware; it seems improbable, but perhaps lost somewhere in the recesses of his subconscious exists some memory of a time when they  were still more engrossed in one another. John never talks about their relationship, so Sherlock knows agonizingly little. How did they meet? Where did they go on their first date? When did they have their first kiss? Then Sherlock realizes that he does not know what it is like to kiss John at all.
“It’s probably going to sound funny to you, but I haven’t made any real friends since I got back. Admittedly there’s Sarah over at the clinic, but we don’t talk all that often. And I don’t see my family much at all anymore, either. My mum and dad are actually quite busy and my sister is…well, my sister is a long story. But that isn’t the point. The point was I didn’t talk to many people. And it’s that…well…I’m sure someone like you can imagine the reasons.” His eyes are fixed on his lap. “Anyways it’s only that I…well I…well.”
Sherlock does not announce himself. He says her name and wrenches the long pole from her hands, upsetting the arrangement of the little wooden pieces across the map. A few regiments land in the English Channel. Adler hisses at him, but dismisses the subordinates with a wave of her hand. They dare not question her authority and file away obediently, though they leave a trail of whispers thickening the air in their wake. Adler watches them with distaste. She turns back to Sherlock and plucks the long pole from his hands.
And he knows that, from the juncture of vein and lips—from the wake of those thousand tiny deaths—there flowers up into his face an infinite, infinite blue.
John shakes his head. “I haven’t finished yet. It’s that…it’s…this death is the most haunting that I’ve seen since I was at the front. It’s one of those consuming deaths, the kind that sinks into you and won’t let you free, not now, probably not ever…”
And yet, lying there struggling to breathe, Sherlock thinks that he might not be unhappy even in this unsubstantial reality. John exists. Can he not subsist on John alone?
Manipulated? Sherlock gives a terrific roll of the eyes, as is quickly becoming evident that only he can give. He mumbles something about an elder brother. His upper lip curls, so John forgets the subject.
His chin is jerked upwards and his breath hitches, because suddenly his vision is nothing but Sherlock Holmes, whose fingers dig cold into the line of his jaw but whose eyes are colder still. They sparkle wildly. Calculating. John flinches and rips his face away. Sherlock leans back obligingly.
John smiles and dog-ears the page, though he does not yet close the book; he’s not sure, yet, what Sherlock will want next, and he doesn’t want to suggest that he has any sort of expectation.
Once the grime has been washed away, the bruises beneath his skin reveal themselves like strange, grotesque flowers in bloom. His lips are dry and John fetches a new sponge, lets a few drops slide into his mouth. His tongue darts out to lap them away, and then he is still again, except for the terrible wet and dry rattle of his breathing. The drugs slacken his jaw.
“To rent another flat would be…prudent,” he says at last. “My brother is many things, Doctor Watson, few of which qualify—according to most, naturally—as, how might we phrase it,
blue? When will you find someone who wakes that color up inside of you, and what will you and your spouse partner lover best friend say to each other when you do? Or (and maybe this one is worse) what will you say to each other if you never do, if you live the rest of your lives with the color of afternoon sky on your skin? Slowly, slowly going dark?
, hissed between his teeth when John asks), and so in the morning when John goes to the kitchen and puts water in the kettle and toast in the toaster and watches the toast pop and looks at the two slices, he thinks that Sherlock can have them, the first pieces of toast which usually John prefers, because, well—less for the life itself than for the reminder of it.
He hates this. He sips petulantly from the teacup with the blue roses printed on the side (enamel roses that bloomed just two weeks ago; before, the cups were plain) as if being a child will chase it all away. He doesn’t want to fall in love with John. It’s too dangerous. He meant it when he said alone protects him; as long as he’s alone, there’s nobody there to be different when he wakes up.
John leans up, pressing their foreheads together, and when he smiles, Sherlock is already smiling back.
He is so rigid, so rigid and faraway, on the edge of the bed. John almost lifts his hand to reach out and he wonders if Sherlock can sense it, the aborted impulse in his muscles, even though he never moved. He thinks he must. He thinks he must.
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” says the man eventually. There is a curious scratch in his voice. “I’ll be back tomorrow.”
Summer trickles away through their outstretched fingers. They solve cases. They scour London and come home to watch crap telly and hold hands on the middle cushion of the squashy old couch. They stay up late into the night analyzing evidence. Usually they are very efficient, but every once in a while they remember how close they are standing and fall into each other. Then the cases take longer to solve. It is worth the trouble.
John settles back into the sofa. They are quiet for a long time while Sherlock silently burns with curiosity. Be knows too well that at moments like this he is at his worst. But he cannot bear not knowing something. Espeically something about John. But he understands that he must not ask. By some tacit rule, he must not ask. And so he needs a distraction.
It’s slow, painstaking, until they find a rhythm. Then it’s a quiet symphony, the rain, the groan of the bed, breathing, sighing, the now-and-again bump of knees, fragments of words, lost forever between the sheets. It’s awkward but it’s good, and Sherlock arches from the mattress with a soft cry. John kisses the underside of his jaw, and then he’s spent, too, lurching forwards into his chest.
John was right. The past can’t be restored. Perhaps it never existed in the first place. But they started over. Sometimes they talk about a house in the countryside. A backyard, a big kitchen, windows for lots of sun. Bees, suggests Sherlock on a whim, and John laughs and kisses him. Alright. Bees. Whatever you like. But they’re not quiet ready for peace and quiet, not yet. So for now, it’s just a pleasant dream.
That wrings a laugh from Sherlock; the sound ricochets back on itself in surprise, like someone catching themself in a mirror they didn’t know was there. After a moment, Sherlock runs a hand over his chin.
“It was the first time my brother ever admitted to having made a mistake. In front of me, at the very least. I suspect, however, it was also the first time he had admitted such a thing ever in his life.”
Sherlock is quickly seized with the need to uncover the identity of John Watson. Over time he gathers that John helps Sherlock with his detective cases, that he otherwise works at a nearby medical clinic, that he has a sister, that he is a war veteran, that he blogs. But this is not enough, and Sherlock begins to understand that he does not want this emotionless profile; he wants to experience John, to taste his heart, his motives.
John wants to tell him not to worry. Then again, maybe the concern isn’t for him at all— maybe it’s for his wife whose mother is pressuring them to have kids, or his dog who keeps trying to break into the trash, or his job that pays the bills but is only enough. It could be anything, really. Mike might not even have reason for concern, not yet; maybe he hasn’t even noticed it. The paleness. Yet.
John can only stare at him. Eventually he shifts in discomfort. His eyes flicker to the boy. They rest on his contorted expression, on the blood that laminates his skin. Hesitation. John has had enough. He pushes the official aside and cradles the boy’s head in the pillow. He feels sick as it occurs to him that fourteen was an overstatement. Perhaps it is only an effect of the fragility that comes from the bloodstains and the helpless rattle of his breathing, but John thinks that the child cannot be more than eleven. Even ten.
Later—and now, they are in a place again where the days and weeks and months blur, and the only units that John can think of to describe time are things like sometime, before, after, later, ambiguous and smooth in their hands, and it is wonderful—Mycroft comes by.
, or for anything, god, Sherlock, I’m here for—oh, hell.” He swallows. “Look, Sherlock, it’s like I said, right? I don’t expect…I know you, I mean…we can just—”
“Honestly.” Sherlock crosses him arms over his chest. “I find this to be one of the most ridiculous behaviors exhibited by most people. You find yourself in a situation and convince yourself that said situation will never change. As if such an idea were even remotely logical! Really, it’s the most childish tendency I can think of. Things change, or haven’t you noticed? Only infants think that the things will always be as they are. I can’t tell you whether things will improve or only worsen. Foresight doesn’t exist. Ridiculous idea in the first place, that. Really, the conventions of humanity are preposterous, each and every one of them. No, I can’t tell you whether things will improve, or what they will be at the end. But I can assure you of one thing.” And he looks John in the eyes. “Things will change.”
His gaze is acute. Things it rests on: the morning (not-sand) cleanness of John’s skin, and now the back of his neck, where self-awareness flushes. Eager—oh, hell, like a victory—to reveal itself. Between them, the warehouse echoes.
“I am the head of this operation,” replies Lestrade almost immediately. John clears his throat to mask a laugh.
John sighs. “Come off it, Sherlock. The clinic is about to close down anyways. I’ll keep that log of her heart rate exactly as you’ve asked. You have my word. You don’t need to hover around here any longer asking personal questions when you don’t really care about the answers.”
No, no. The bomb falls away. Of course not. And John rubs his wrists, praying the color (blue magnified and leering, brilliant in its desperation, swimming in deep pits of yellow, yellow fear) won’t bleed past his sleeves. He assesses the pain. Says thank you, Sherlock, thank you. Gruffly. Sherlock smiles (rare, relieved, grateful, surprised, question mark), but then his eyes widen, and John knows that the tiny red circle—leering, electric light, no feeling at all—that is suddenly trained on Sherlock’s forehead is reflected on his own.
Sherlock rolls his eyes – “Oh, don’t be so dramatic; it doesn’t suit you,” – but he looks impressed.
Molly turned to him. Her skin looked slippery and her eyes were filmed over. A forceful shiver coursed through Sherlock.
Death has been so kind as to accompany him in his vigil. He stands in a thick cloak of silence and taps his chin with one slender finger. He is not excited, because this death is too obvious. He knows it will not be long before he can welcome the boy into the dark comfort of his embrace. He prefers theatrics. Tragedy. He adores bitter flavors and watches John brew tea with a great deal of fascination.
Fear is an infection, Sherlock considers in moderate revulsion as John turns to him with an infinite expression in his eyes, although of what emotion Sherlock is not sure. John is sad. Obviously. But his face is capable of so much at one time. Sherlock theorizes that John has never restricted himself, so he has developed a way to moderate his heart. Emotions spill and swirl together at the corners of his eyes and the bow of his lips, at the slope of his nose and the tiny dip of his chin, but they are not too bright, and the colors are tasteful. The shading is nice, too; a little stronger where the light hits, softer where subtlety is wanting. Fine work. Not that of a master, no. The canvas is too torn and weary. But it is fine work nevertheless.
They are consumed in flames. Sherlock is vaguely conscious of a deafening roar. Savage heat swirls around them. His mouth runs impossibly dry. The world seems to crumble away beneath their feet. In an instant the entire universe takes on the same dreamlike quality that has tortured Sherlock since the accident.
Sherlock snorts. “I am never lost in thought, John; I always know my way.” He plants both hands on the desk and leans forwards. The edge of his scarf trails over the paperwork but John does not lift his gaze. “You are a dreadful liar.”
And then it stops. The memories drop off abruptly. The dream envelops him again. Sherlock wants to scream in frustration. Instead he smiles stiffly at Mycroft.
And John can’t help it: it’s his first instinct, to get up from the bed, take a step to match him, grab his hand, to turn it over and stare at his wrist. Nothing: blank. No color. Is it locked so deeply inside his heart, then?
“Have you eaten?” asks John when Sherlock walks into the sitting room. Sherlock stares. John speaks so easily. No discomfort. No need for any sort of obvious and painful transition from acquaintances to flat mates.  They have seen death together. No longer need they heed the call for formalities, regulations, normalized social conduct. They are not normal, after all. How refreshing.
He is not unacquainted with London, but the city seems foreign to him. The grey faces of her buildings and shops are as empty and unrecognizable as those of the citizens who skitter along the streets as if shortcuts and alleyways will shelter them from bullets and mines. The barricades and the twinkling fires strip the city of her familiar personality. She loses her grandeur in the glimpses of uniforms and the murmurs of French and German that fall onto the pavement and shatter like shards of glass. And yet one can see the remnants of pride in the immaculate hedges of her parks and the clean walls of Buckingham Palace, for the government keeps her well even as chaos burns in her heart.
They break apart and return to opposite sides of the couch. John reaches for his hand. A comfortable silence settles on their shoulders. They do not need words. Their fingers intertwine. John turns up the volume of the telly.
Sherlock does not know why he picks up. Perhaps it is because he is exhausted. But perhaps more likely it is because at the bottom of his heart he knows. In any other case he would ignore it. He would shove the phone back into his pocket with a sneer. He would return to helping John. But he does not. He picks up the phone. He picks up the phone and says hello to his brother.
One morning John suggests that they get married, and Sherlock says alright, and that’s that. John says that he thinks spring is a very good time to be married, Sherlock laughs, and then they kiss, and make love right there on the sofa. Sherlock’s sleepy afterwards, and dozes with John’s lips in his hair. It’s a predictable mistake. A bit disappointing, even. He should know better.
She stretches indulgently. “Glad to hear it.” She swirls the amber liquid in the bottom of the glass and flecks of light glitter from her eyes. “Has he called you back yet?”
“I ought to thank you again, Sherlock,” he says quietly. He fiddles with the edge of his sweater. “For introducing me to everyone at the clinic, I mean.” He pauses. Sherlock is still. He does not want to move and somehow break his train of thought. As though that were somehow possible! But John plays strange tricks on logic and reason.
Sherlock wakes under hospital lights with the newborn understanding that conjecture is useless and fear is fallible. He doesn’t care anymore. John is asleep in the other bed. Alive, but only luckily. Sherlock understands now, what he has to do. The idea of losing John to death inspires within him a fear so profound as to chase away his selfishness.
After Moriarty, everything is the same. And yet, something changes. It starts. John doesn’t know how. But it starts.
“It suits you.” Sherlock joins him at the edge of the balcony. “The sun in your eyes. Makes you look young.”
For the first time in what seems an eternity, they do not stay at the clinic overnight. John washes his hands and takes his coat from the pegs in the office. He shakes away the jacket of dust and goes to find Sherlock. He finds him in his shirtsleeves, bent over the counter measuring morphine. The supply shrinks and shrinks every day. At this point the effort is hopeless. Nobody will bring more to the already doomed. Sherlock turns. John knows that at a glance he can deduce everything.
At the first note Sherlock melts into a surreal being, a ghost, impossibly white and fluid, framed by the liquid night. He is frightening and beautiful, an apparition, so slender that if you reached out and touched him he would dissipate into nothing but a spray of eerie musical notes. He reminds John of what he seemed when they first laid eyes upon one another, but warmer. When he opens his eyes they are liquid glass, and the color fluctuates with the crescendo and decrescendo of the music. Vivaldi again. Spring. He is being ironic of course. It suits him.
“No,” admits Sherlock. “Neither am I.” Silence. The air is warm and grey.“What’s different about this one?”
Sherlock looks at John. He’s trembling, furious, relieved, confused. It’s legible in the color of his eyes, the jolting movement of his fingers, the new shadow on his brow. He’s endured something terrible.
It passes. The moment passes. Sherlock’s eyes cloud again, and his body softens, and he presses his cheek into the pillow, mumbling:
John soon joins them with three cups of coffee and a tray of sugar cubes. Sherlock wants to kiss him. But more than that, he wants to
John’s poured tea into cups printed with elegant violets whose green tendrils wind up the handle – a new addition that Sherlock dreamed up a few nights before – and he sips from time to time, pensively, or with no expression at all. Sherlock’s only comfort is watching the emotions play across his face, his eyes, the fluxes of surprise, incredulity, at times sympathy or sadness, and a crumbling look akin to heartbreak.
John is coming home from the surgery, thinking about what to order for dinner, and he walks up the stairs to 221B, and he fits the key in the lock, and he walks inside and it isn’t until he hangs his jacket in the hall and drops his bag in the living room and turns and his gaze travels, accidentally, over the doorway to the kitchen, that he realizes he’s there.
The next week brings a myriad of visitors. There is the tottering Mrs. Hudson; she must be his landlady, judging by how she prattles on about the state of
Like a notebook, like a slate, like a check for anything anyone could imagine Sherlock Holmes might ever want, Irene Adler is blank. Blank and beautiful and brilliant, brilliant; her body flows in long, continuous bands of motion, winding around Sherlock, never quite touching and yet always, always meeting him at every turn, every breath. She leads, drawing Sherlock forwards as if she knew how to magnetize his every capillary and in the network of her own blood beating had installed the necessary poles.
“Of course not,” he says quietly. “Not a word. I swear to you on my honor as a soldier.” He pauses. “Thank you, Sherlock.”
“The whole city, John,” he continues raggedly. “The whole bloody city, before more people can die. It’s already started. They’re going to get everyone out. Three days. Everyone. Even the enemy troops. They have to. They don’t have a choice. We don’t have a choice. Nobody does. There’s no other option.”
She speaks aloud what has been silently torturing his mind all this time. Sherlock runs his hands through his hair, pressing into his temples with the balls of his palms. Only in front of Irene would he ever show such distress. She is the closest to him in intellect. Behind her lipstick and the medals pinned on her breast pocket she hides a ferocious mind. There is no choice but to respect her.
Sherlock cannot stop now. He easily details the stages of her alcoholism, her confused relationship with her mother, her almost violently estranged relationship with her father, her interminable series of deadbeat girlfriends who only nursed her on the bottle, and lastly her helpless dependence on John, who desperately wants to help her but cannot allow himself to encourage her.
Sometimes, Sherlock wakes and John is already gone, but the whisper of eggs frying on the stove is as good as his lips against his ear. Other times John stays and then his lips really are against his ear, his cheek, his forehead, his mouth, whispering without speaking. They ask each other a thousand questions without a single word. Sherlock has fallen in love.
Blank. Afterwards, they lie next to each other. Not holding each other. Not even speaking. But next to each other all the same. And John, barely breathing, his entire body suffused with color, turns out the light, and rolls over, and dares—dares, dares, dares—to lay one hand on the fall of Sherlock’s hip. And leave it there. And sleep.
Other things Sherlock does not do: dishes, laundry, friendly “good-mornings” and “good-nights.” Or sleep, as far as John can tell; catnaps on the couch don’t count. He does shower, and in fact he irons his clothes. Suits and suits and suits, all black, and his beautiful silk shirts. He does his hair, too. It’s strange, because John gets the sense he hates living in a body—having to feed it, wash it, plaster it with nicotine patches and put it to rest every twelve (thirty-six, forty-eight, sixty, seventy-two) hours—and yet he is meticulous about that body’s outward appearance. Strange. He’s strange. That’s all there is to it.
Strange. One morning, John gets up, pulls on his robe, and shuffles into the kitchen. It isn’t until he’s finished putting on the kettle that he really understands that Sherlock is sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by all the apparati one needs to draw blood—the slender needle perched smugly in his chalky hand—and also a cup of tea. John blinks.
Night falls and John collapses at his desk. He props his face in his hands. Sherlock sits across from him and maintains a glassy composure so as not to cause alarm.
John smirks. “Oh, you must be terribly hungry, working all day.” He wants to pretend things are normal. He wants to pretend and he hopes Sherlock will pretend, too, because games are no fun playing alone. He waits with baited breath. Sherlock chuckles as they head towards the door. He exhales.
He and Sherlock talk of nothing in particular. Their only goal is to fill the empty night with words, and even if each and every one is meaningless, just the sound of another voice is enough. At some point in the small hours of the morning, in the deep breath just before the dawn, Death grows tired of skirting the feet of the bed and takes up residence at the back of John’s chair, leaning over his shoulder to listen in on their conversation, the lamplight spilling halfway across his face.
Sherlock nearly stumbles in his façade when evening falls and, wandering back towards Baker Street, they stop at a restaurant that he should know. He panics –
He circles the armchair and sits down on the sofa, tucking his bathrobe beneath him. He locks eyes with the man and his heart stammers.
So he buys groceries and makes eggs in the morning even though Sherlock doesn’t care and won’t touch a thing.
At first, he looks at Mycroft and thinks that they are the same. His heart pounds. It’s genetic, then? He can’t recall. Mycroft catches his gaze and a brief bright tongue of amusement (goldenrod, flat, not shimmering and unsteady like laughter) stabs up his neck, as if on cue.
“So it has come to this,” murmurs Mycroft. He cannot help but glance out the window. Outside London is grey, but alive and breathing. The sky is silver. So the sun must be strong through the thin layer of cloud. There was light rain in the morning but now the air is dry.
“You imagine correctly,” says Irene glassily, reflecting his smirk. “Allow me to repeat myself. Do you know why you’re here?”
Sherlock nods and John stares into his lap. They are both supposed to leave early the next morning, along with the rest of Sherlock’s research crew, just a few hours after Angelo. They were even assigned to the same airplane. John might add that he highly suspects that Sherlock’s mysterious and allegedly powerful brother had a hand in that arrangement. But that hardly matters anymore. Mycroft went to such trouble for nothing. John won’t be there. Sherlock will go alone. He has agreed to cover for him. He will escape and John will stay. Simple.
Sherlock doesn’t even look. He darts to the end of her wrist and back, pinching her sleeve between his thumb and forefinger. Focused.
Another sigh accompanies the arrival of a young woman who trips to a halt with her medical coat expanding around her like the awkward wings of a fledgling.
He grits his teeth. John looks at him for a long time. He doesn’t look back. At some point John goes inside. Once he’s gone Sherlock clings to the railing until his knuckles burn. Rain is brewing and the wind whips his face, brings tears to his eyes, dashes them away. He can’t. It’s selfish, but he won’t. And in the end he doesn’t deserve it.
John tries not to think. He concentrates on the street, the pace of his footsteps, on breathing, the inconstant color of the sky.  He reckons that it is easier for him than for Sherlock. He wishes he could help but he doesn’t want to break the curious spell of silence. At this point they both know the way to Baker Street by heart. They don’t need to speak. They seldom do. Words are translated between them soundlessly. They absorb and transmit meanings in the slightest inclination of the chin, the rustle of a jacket, an inhale, an exhale, a crease of a forehead. John shakes his head. He does not want to think about that. He does not want to consider their strange bond.
Death follows him onto the army helicopter. The pilot smiles and drops a few jokes as easily as he might a spoonful of cream into coffee. He only does transports from one base to another and so he has not seen the twisted faces of the young recruits strewn dead in the soft golden folds of the dunes. He has not seen the women broken on the pavement still clutching the hands of their children. He has not seen the wasteland of the desert. He has heard a lot about Death, but has yet to shake his hand.
“You’re dead.” He dug his hands into his hair. He kept saying it. Dead. Dead. And he wouldn’t stop saying it until they shut him away. He wasn’t worth much, anyways. He was never on leave. He dropped out, addicted to heroin, not cocaine. He was insane. Delusional. Neurotic. A freak. A sociopath. He wouldn’t sleep. He just wanted his violin but they wouldn’t give it to him.
And a strange sensation begins to overcome Sherlock. It starts somewhere in his chest and spreads with a frightening voracity. Already it is reaching for the very tips of his fingers. And then it begins to slowly devour him. John toys with the edge of his sweater. His eyes are like cold deep water. Outside the light dims into the inconstant color of dusk and reflects shadows across his face. But the sadness is profound and eminent. Guilt turns the corners of his mouth down and memory fills the creases in his forehead. He is reliving the desert, the scorching dunes, the chalky faces of soldiers dying just beyond the reach of his hands, the cry of gunfire, he is reliving it all in the small white face of the little girl dead on the hospital cot, dead with her skin already yellowing at the corners.
And then Sherlock hangs up. The clinic is silent. Of course it is an illusion. The air is rent with talk and groans and the rush of footsteps and the almost imperceptible undertone of death. But to him the clinic is silent and the world is still. At some point John appears. He is wiping blood from his hands with a rag. He is absorbed in the job. At long last he looks up at Sherlock. His jaw falls slack.
He is losing himself in memory and the shadow of Death that hovers at his shoulder, and Sherlock is consumed with the desire to help him, and he can think of nothing else.
A soldier stumbles along the sidewalk. Even in the dim light – now only the fires glow from the yawning mouths of the alleyways – you can see blood seeping from where his fingers clutch at his arm. It drips dark onto the pavement. His mouth sags open but the glass of the window stops his cries. John is impossibly grateful. Death sighs in disappointment. The boy will live. John shuts his eyes as the cab rumbles to life again. When he has the strength to open his eyes again, Death is gone and Sherlock is watching him.
“Do you really?” His voice betrays nothing more than faint interest. John runs both hands through his hair in exasperation.
John nods. “Yes, more.” He is not entirely aware of what he is saying. His voice takes on a sharp edge. In the back of his mind it occurs to him that he must sound a bit like a madman. “More. Consider this, Sherlock. What if we had met under different circumstances? What if this was just one more night in hundreds, thousands? What if it didn’t end tomorrow? What if…” He trails off. His heart is pounding dizzyingly. His head throbs. “What would we do then?”
It’s the strangest thing. Sherlock dreams again. More concretely than ever – skylines, exact faces, memories for the first time in his life. And very little changes anymore. It’s only tiny details, now, if anything at all. Maybe it’s because there was truth in what John said. Maybe it’s because Sherlock’s arrived at a conclusion of his own.
John doesn’t care. He wouldn’t care no matter what. The thing he’s starting to think, though, is that what you see is not exactly what you should believe.
As promised, he and John have become rather well acquainted. It has become increasingly apparent that Sherlock is strange and often infuriating. He whines and makes absurd demands and every once in a while is seized by violently dramatic moods. He disappears for days at a time and then reappears with a new arsenal of questions balanced on the bow of his lips. But he is certainly interesting. In fact the only predictable thing about him is the black satin suit that he wears tailored as sharply as his scorn.
He has also discovered the circumstances of his malady: apparently, he had been conducting a dangerous experiment when the chemicals reacted incorrectly. He fainted from the fumes and struck his head quite badly on the edge of the kitchen table. He suffered a concussion, explained the doctors, but nothing worse. He has to keep from laughing when he hears this.
He remembers the feeling differently. Once, when he was six or seven, he was alone in the house and felt uneasy. Another time, Mycroft fell and broke his arm at the elbow. Their mother was uncharacteristically unsettled. Clutching her hand in the hospital waiting room, Sherlock had felt his stomach twist.
“Good morning,” he says. The man smiles and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes pull upwards. No, he could not have been an adulterer. “I’m sorry,” adds Sherlock before he can help himself. “They don’t realize that it’s inevitable, do they?”
Sherlock blinks. The crease between his brows deepens. He lifts one hand and begins to fiddle with the cuff of his sharp black suit.
“Stay here when I’m gone.” His voice is smooth. He does not bother to whisper. “Whenever you can get away from the work, that is. Please.”
Were it not for the gauntness in her cheeks and the translucent smile that she gave him when he awarded her a lollipop, he would not have run a single test. He only wanted an excuse to put her up in the pediatric ward, to feed her, to keep her from being shot or tripping over a mine on the streets. The slightest irregularity in white count or blood pressure would have sufficed. But his head swims at the lab results. Beneath her papery skin rages chaos.
“It doesn’t matter,” interrupts Sherlock. He’s touched, and that’s dangerous. “It’s alright; it’s how I chose to be. It was selfish, really.”
“It was wonderful, as always, Angelo,” says Sherlock mildly. He does not even shake off the hand on his shoulder. John is impressed. Angelo laughs for no apparent reason and shoots a wink at him.
At some point John looks up. Sherlock does not bother to lower his gaze. He finds no shame in his studies and he even dares to think that John is perhaps already accustomed to his peculiarities.
Even Sherlock eats. Perhaps he feels compelled by ceremony. Perhaps it is a gift. But the reason isn’t really important. He and John talk. Mentions of the weather, their childhoods, half-remembered anecdotes from their school days, university, embarrassing stories about their siblings, anything other than the next day, the constant roar of the aeroplanes and helicopters, the silent city, the dying patients with white faces turned towards the ceiling as if in prayer.
He draws the curtains and the night pours through the window in a thick black flood. Fantastic shadows ricochet from the walls and taunt the fragile lamplight. Sherlock is a pale glimmer against the slice of black glass. He tucks the violin beneath his chin. A deep breath. He arches his wrist so that the bow presses soundlessly into the strings. A pause. He closes his eyes. John waits.
“John,” he says, and the force of the punch is gone from his voice, and the universe of tenderness in that tiny syllable snaps in two something that John had built up within himself ever since he fired that bullet and watched his skin rust over.
Sherlock is as calm as always, and John cannot deny that it is reassuring to have him cool and collected at his side. He is a pillar of reason, black and white not only in his appearance but in his sensibilities, drawing a clear line between logic and insanity. At some point in the evening it occurs to John that he trusts him very much. John feels at ease with Sherlock. It is difficult to explain.
Sherlock gazes at him for a long moment. John does not shy away even though his heart stutters beneath such unyielding concentration. An eternity seems to pass. Sherlock breaks away. He smiles slowly and shakes his head.
Things cannot stay the way they are. They must change. Such is the nature of the universe. War cannot last forever. Neither can life. Neither can sickness nor health. He opens his eyes and looks at John. He is at work, bent over his clipboard with worry creasing his brow. Death is at his shoulder. A watchful shadow.
Sherlock can only nod. He does not trust himself to speak; he has not yet ascertained how people expect his character to react, how they expect him to look at the world. The man does not seem alarmed; he only runs one hand through his hair and opens his mouth again.
John looks down. He laughs miserably and presses two fingers to his temple. Sherlock watches him curiously.
“Recall that I work for the government itself, Anderson.” He wipes his hand on his trousers. “So do you, in case you’ve forgotten. They’re well aware of our activities. So do forgive me for not quite cowering before such a threat.”
The night has grown cold. They head to Baker Street straightaway. The windows are dark; Mrs. Hudson is already asleep. They slip inside like ghosts and Sherlock lights a single lamp that fills the sitting room with a rounded yellow glow. John hesitates in the darkness of the foyer, gazing into the mirror, tracing the indefinite lines of his face in the shadow. After a time Sherlock joins him.
Soft, almost silent. Like he’s afraid. Is he afraid? Sherlock looks at him. His eyes say nothing. Blank. Controlled. No, no. Just blank. Right? Then he turns away, faces the window. Hands clasped behind his back. No reaching him. No reaching him? No—no reaching him.
All he wants is to help John. They are never apart. It is as if they have melded into one person. They are a dichotomy in its truest form. Sherlock is cold and calculating. He stays the syringe of morphine when the patient is on the brink of death. Supplies run low. Waste cannot be allowed. And then John is human. He murmurs to the children and comforts the stranded mothers and wanders in a dream of war and death and chalky faces. In the end his only guide is Sherlock’s hand. He stumbles on the path but he stays upright because now they serve as one another’s reality.
“I just…” Sherlock pauses. “Well, to be honest, I don’t really know. Not for sure. But I think I sort of, rather…after the Fall, after all that time I spent away from you, John. I just. I found that it was impossible.”
He began to stalk away across the lawn. Blood stained the silvery silk of his trousers. Sherlock stood in the rain and cried. In the end Mummy got a load of everything perfectly well and shouted herself hoarse. She smoked on the patio afterwards with a long ivory pipe balanced artfully between her fingers. Sherlock was confused and rejected and when he fled to the violin to distract himself the notes came out crooked and wrong. He threw the bow aside and crumbled onto his bed. He wept for hours. He would never cry like that again.
John touches her forehead and her eyes come open. She is frightened. Her skin is feverish. She seems to gasp for air.
“John, no.” He unthinkingly reaches for his hand. “Don’t you understand? I thought you were my husband and so I decided to fall in love with you. I was…terrified, frankly. I had no idea what would happen. To forge such a feeling seemed…impossibly daunting.” He stops for a long moment. John’s hand is limp in his grasp. He presses his thumb into his palm, feels the rush of his pulse. “It was easier than I imagined. And then one day sitting on the couch I realized that it was easy because it was real.”
“Will there be a ceremony?” he asks anxiously. Sherlock actually laughs aloud and the sound is a mixture of relief and happiness and exasperation.
“The foolish part is that…it’s that I feel guilty, Sherlock. I can’t get her out of my mind because it’s my fault she’s dead. I should have kept closer watch, not trusted her to the nurses so much, run more scans, something…” He swallows. “She wasn’t that sick. She shouldn’t have died. And I can only trace the fault back to myself.”
For John Watson, the little girl with her face pulled white and wan over her cheekbones like the skin of a leather drum is the pebble.
They arrived in London at about 7 AM. Sherlock hailed a cab immediately and they were driven to Scotland Yard. "I wish to speak with D.I. Gregston.", Sherlock told the receptionist with the highest authority he could muster, or so John thought. The detective arrived a few minutes later. She was pretty young, most likely in her twenties and offered Sherlock a brief smile. "Alright. You get to look at the crime scene and do whatever you need to do, no touching though, and afterwards you tell me. I better hope this works, otherwise I'm beheading your brother.", Gregston explained. "There'll be a line." The policewoman chuckled. She eyed John with suspicion but decided against saying anything. They then went to the scene of the robbery. John was honestly a bit nervous. He felt like he wasnt supposed to be here. "What do you say, John?" "Well it must have been a younger person. All the things that are missing are decidedly not adult-related." Sherlock nodded. "Most likely male, around 19-22 id say..." And as he continued to ramble off deductions, John just couldn't help bit stare at him in marvel. In the end he closed the case in less than thirty minutes. They stayed for another 20 minutes for the paperwork to be done and with a "I'll call you the next time i need your help" from the D.I. they were dismissed. Sherlock was actually grinning as tgey descended the stairs. "Care for a bit of food?", he then asked John. And John could just nod.
John Watson was beyond excited. This evening the students from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons would arrive. His excitement was shared by just about every single other student in the entire castle. In the last week, no other topic of conversation besides the Triwizard Tournament arose, so when it was finally there, the joy and expectations were nearly bubbling over.
But then again the next thing he would have said would have been hurtful and rude so he tried to not be bothered too much by it all. Instead he listened to the carriage door at night to hear who left it to put their name into the goblet of fire. He himself did not plan to try, he knew of the age restriction and of Dumbledores skill in wizardry. Sherlock was at Hogwarts because he found Beauxbatons to be tiring at times. New faces to deduce, a new setting for his experiments and new secrets to discover had intrigued him.
It was Harry. She smiled at him widely. He couldn't help but smile back. Harry was a mess but she was his big sister. He obviously loved her. She entered and hung up her jacket before he could even think about the situation that would occur. They entered the kitchen "Happy Christmas!", his sister proclaimed jollily. Then their mothers fork hit the floor. "You cannot be in here, Harriet." She looked scared and angry at once. "Its Christmas eve, surely-", Harry started but she was interrupted by their father "Get the fuck out of here, faggot." He slammed his fist on the table. Harry apparently thought they'd gotten over it by now. "No, it's Christmas, i want to celebrate with my family...", she started, trying to make it better. "No dyke is part of my family, get out!" Harry's face went from happy to ice-cold. "As much as you'd like that to be true, i am still your daughter." And with that she sat down at the table. That was it. Their father arose, taking one big stride across the room and sinking his fist onto his daughters face with terrible speed amd power. A sickening crack filled the room. Harry's whole face was bleeding. She screamed. Their mother let out a soft "no, please", but only flinched at the hit. John, in complete shock, dropped to the floor, looking at Harry's red face. "And what do you think you're doing, boy? Helping disgusting trash? You're just as unnatural as she is." He kicked John, who was trying to carry his sister away, in the knees. John fell immediately. His father was now laughing nastily. Despite the overwhelming pain, he stood up, turned around and punched his father in the face. The former soldier didnt take that lightly. So John, wanting to stay alive, helped Harry up again and they fled the house.
He falls silent. Sherlock’s head has begun to swim with pain and morphine and the pounding of his heart. He feels the sear of the burn at his stomach more sharply. He opens his mouth to reply, but his voice cracks. His lips are dry again. Suddenly, a nurse materializes and presses him back into the pillows. She gives him a fresh injection and the curtain falls on the dream of the hospital.
“I hope you two enjoyed your meal,” he booms, and seals one thick hand around Sherlock’s shoulder. John tries not to smile at the juxtaposition. Slender aristocratic Sherlock bending like a willow beneath the weight of this enormous flushed man. It’s ridiculous.
“Glad you’ve slept. It’s been days.” He’s in the kitchen. The rush of water mingles with his voice. “Fancy a cup? Maybe even something to eat?”
John bites back the anger because he knows it’s magnified by Irene, and he doesn’t want to admit it to himself, doesn’t want Sherlock to know, because if he says it he will know, maybe already does. He has not touched him in days.
And by now Sherlock knows that it is only a matter of time. He can count by the messages that flood his cellphone. Adler has told his brother. And if Adler has told his brother, it means she is truly afraid. And if Adler will admit to her fear, then the excuse can no longer hold. The dam must crumble and the torrent must be unleashed upon the streets of London.
“Every single one, and in the correct sequence. She died last night. We came back and there she was. Dead. Her skin was already yellowing.”
John is not afraid. Rather he feels irrationally safe standing next to Sherlock, with his hand on his shoulder. But for some reason his heart sings in his ears. He is acutely aware of Sherlock at his side, of the measured come and go of his breathing, his seamless composure, the pressure of his hand. The man glances between them. A moment of suspense. Then his eyes widen.
Sherlock intervenes with another splendid roll of his eyes. His expression has melted again, no longer cool and glassy. Just indifferent. It suits him.
John grabs Moriarty and wins another red dot for Sherlock’s forehead. Relief. Now they both die. It’s not ideal, but at least they won’t be alone. He almost smiles in the face of death, but Moriarty exits the stage before the curtain drops. A breath of silence. So be it. He’ll analyze it later. For now he’s tearing at John, feeling all over to make sure he’s real. John’s gasping and shaking, but he’s alive, warm, tangible.
The piece is coming to a close; does Sherlock know that John is there? If he does, he does not stop, he lets the music exhale away like a sigh, like relief, and the last note seems to plunge within John and hook itself on something there. And even as the colors fade, even as Sherlock’s beautiful colors fade, John feels what opening feels like. Like his skin is cracking. He knew, some things he already knew—the heaviness between his legs, he understood from the beginning—but now his skin is cracking as if in a dry wind but there’s nothing, no wind, no desert, nothing, he can’t even remember what sand means, the taste or texture of it, sand? Impossible, not when his skin is cracking and tears swim warm and wet in his eyes.
He braces himself on the edge of the table. “This isn’t the headmaster’s office, Lieutenant General.” He takes an artful pause. “But rather I can only imagine that it’s infinitely worse.”
John laughs again, and this time the sound is a brilliant streak of color in the air before it fades.
John smiles and chuckles quietly. “Nothing special.” He shifts, takes his teacup from the arm of the chair, but doesn’t drink. “Just what all doctors think.”
The kettle whistles; John pours the tea, because he’s not sure what else to do. Sherlock’s blood rushes into the vial, fills it up. John wonders if he notices it, the way John can’t quite bring irritation to bubble up on his wrists. He doubts it’s because of the paleness.
Working overtime, John becomes lost in his memory. The clinic is quiet. The windows and hallways are dark except for the emergency lights. The patients lie soundless between the sheets. An injured young man sleeps in every bed. They are a collection of broken legs and arms and ribs and shattered minds and youths. They are torn by the screams of gunfire and the taste of dust and blood and left tattered dying on starched hospital sheets. John feels a sad kinship with them.
“Well,” says John. He does hate his flat: little licks of red that claw at his neck before sinking back into the sand. He feels one now in the space below his ear, and Mike’s eyes flicker to it. A yellow blotch of hope appears at his temple: cerebral, friendly.
And with that he waltzes from the room waving his right hand goodbye as though it were a cane and he a tap dancer.
“I thought you were,” he gasps. John seems at a loss for words. “After I struck my head I couldn’t remember a thing about you,” he continues. His voice hitches wildly every few words. “I tried and tried to figure out who you were. It was hard; you weren’t easy to deduce like Molly or that fellow at Scotland Yard or the landlady. Then I…well. You always brought me tea, and you put up with me, and sometimes when you thought I was asleep you would…touch my hair, and the way you smiled at me, I…” He glanced up at John helplessly. His face was blank. “It seemed only
He stopped dreaming ideas. He stopped dreaming anything at all. He didn’t sleep much. Still doesn’t. It’s a habit he won’t break, no matter how much John tries.
It ends on the tarmac. The cold is bitter and John has his arms crossed the whole time. The queue of people and luggage is long. He and Sherlock keep silent vigil. He does not have the heart to ask for deductions. It would break him. Molly is there, too, with a thermos of tea in her hands, but they don’t see her. They don’t see much at all.
When Sherlock is almost healthy, when he has learned his way around the flat and can flawlessly tune himself to the expectations of others, they eat at the breakfast table together and fight over the newspaper. John surrenders if Sherlock will eat half an egg. Sherlock concedes and John smiles with warmth that he can
They go for a walk. Curfew be damned. What can it matter to them anymore, anyways? No destination in particular. They wander aimlessly for a time, without speaking or even so much as looking at each other. At some point the air catches with light. The streetlamps, reflecting onto the glassy surface of the Thames. John comes to the edge of the bridge and stares into the water. In one motion Sherlock hoists himself onto the railing and dangles his legs from the edge.
“Do forgive me for saying so, my dear Watson,” says Sherlock finally, and his voice is strange, stiff and starched like hospital sheets. John cannot bring himself to look at him. He is too afraid. The lapping of the water fills a pause that seems an eternity. At long last Sherlock exhales.
“I see.” And he turns to his desk. Braces himself on the back of a chair. A long silence. And then Sherlock realizes.
“It was very sweet of you to come,” says the man eventually, “but I’m sure Sherlock needs his rest. Besides, the hospital visitor hours are about to close.” He stands, and one hand falls to his thigh, pressing for an instant. An old habit? But why? “I should be going, as well.”
Sherlock is liquid, living liquid there in the center of the music, and when he bares the bow against the strings, the note that slips from the intimacy, from the unbearable pressure of their contact, is liquid, and it is—it is bright. Bright, so bright, every note flows into a ribbon of color, rippling and tenuous and alive, and there is Sherlock in the center of all of it, the green and red and yellow and purple and silver and orange and pink and grey and the gold and gold and gold. The colors knot themselves around him, lick at his shoulders, his neck, his cheeks and hands, ricochet from him but always come back, trying again, again and again and again, for as long as he plays. He is surrounded by color; color surrounds him. For as long as he plays.
exceptional—in which one can survive without food. Therefore, I must eat. In fact, I daresay you have even witnessed it.” He leans back in the chair. “Might that not be sufficient data, Doctor Watson?”
The voice has shifted from human to surreal.  John raises a brow at such temerity, but he is strangely calm. The man does not frighten him. In fact, he exudes an infectious cool. John smiles pleasantly. He will file the police report later. He contentedly explains that he is a doctor. The glass eyes crackle.
Sherlock gazes at him helplessly, because he doesn’t know what else to do. A moment passes, and John recoils, mumbling an apology. Sherlock begins to understand. The cruel joke takes shape in his mind. John still loves him, and that’s what really matters, but it’s a secret. Fate has a wicked sense of humor.
John clears his throat. Sherlock can tell he’s pleased. Wary, too; he knows Sherlock very well, after all.
I tried to do as he suggested, I really did. Ever since I was a little boy. But it was so boring, the world was flat, no texture to it, nothing. Every time, I either turned back to my colors, which nearly killed me, or…well, when I got older, to heroin or cocaine, which ultimately had the same effect.”
John jots down his initials in the space provided. “I’m not lying,” he replies evenly. “What reason would I have to lie to you, anyways? You can always tell.”
“Indeed,” replies Sherlock silkily. “And quite dangerous, at that. It’s shown its face in some isolated villages in the center of China. We got our share of samples some time ago.” He leans in close to the case. “Go ahead and have a proper look. Don’t worry. It’s quite sealed. One must take the utmost security with such a lethal weapon.”
The slow onset of madness only sharpens John. His fingers fly over every stitch. He breaks bones and snaps them back into place and ties tourniquets with his teeth. He no longer wastes the morphine because he can smell when a young man will die. He can feel the air thicken. He can hear Death chuckle in satisfaction. He fancies he can even see him bend over the mattress and take the tormented face in one hand to close the eyes forever. Worst of all he begins to see the mercy therein. And so they have become the best of friends.
He goes to the window and draws back the curtains. The afternoon spills into the flat. Baker Street is relatively quiet, for the most part unoccupied by troops and gunfire. A car horn cries softly in the distance. There is little other sound. John exhales. He steps forwards and runs a hand the back of one of the armchairs. Sherlock turns from the window. He looks curious. Observant. Like always. John gets the impression that he cannot help it. Thinking, that is. The light plays tricks over his face. John meets his eyes.
“I don’t. Can’t be trusted. I have various other physiological clues: your jaw is clenched, there is a flush—blood, I mean—on your neck, and your hand is exhibiting a tremor, ever so slight, but a tremor nonetheless. Not to mention that there are a good number of context clues. For example, you have sighed several times in the past fourteen minutes. More loudly than you do when you think you are not being watched, which leads me to believe that you want me to hear, consciously or otherwise. You also stomped down the stairs to the kitchen. And you are currently glaring at me. As far as I know, I am the only person available to receive your ire; were you angry at Sarah, you would put on this display of passive-aggression in her flat, not ours. Thus, I presume it is meant for me. But please, try to restrain yourself: don’t call me
“Made it possible for me? The Work, John. Obviously. It wasn’t the same, of course. But it was…enough. Barely enough. But enough. And then…well.”
Sherlock turned around to see a boy, roughly their age grinning at them. "Jim?", John asked in wonder. Sherlock's eyes widened. It was Molly's boyfriend. "What are you doing here?", John asked him. "I could ask you the same thing." Sherlock raised his wand at the Durmstrang boy, who reciprocated the action. "You." Jim smiled. "Me. When I heard you were here I just couldn't help but get closer." "That's why you dated Molly", Sherlock realised. "Yeah. And playing gay. Did you catch the bit with the underwear?", he asked, still smiling. "Playing?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow. Jim rolled his eyes and laughed. "So you are as good as they say. Then why did it take you this long?" Sherlock's jaw tightened. "I was occupied." Jim raised his eyebrows. "I'm sure you were." Sherlock frowned at tge implication. John was just confused. "He's an accomplice. He imperiused Viktor. He helped Moody and..." Sherlock stopped. Jim pulled back the sleeve of his wand-arm. John's heart seemed to set out. "Voldemort", he whispered. Jim smiled contentedly. "I took Delacour and Krum out already. Was hoping to find the Potter-boy here but this is just as good." Then they started throwing spells. John and Sherlock were stronger together but Jim was surprising. He was taught well in the Dark Arts and trained in combat. He must've realised he didn't have the upper hand so suddendly there was an explosion in between them. John and Sherlock were thrown back through another wall in the maze.
John had never felt so stupid. Was this really true? In the Great Hall, now very winter-y decorated, he didn't see Sherlock anywhere. But that might have been accounted to the fact that everyone was excitedly jumping around and waiting for the champions to arrive. And really- Viktor Krum and Hermione Granger, Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies and Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory entered the hall. Cho was nowhere to be seen. Excelt that he spotted her, leaning at a table nearby. Irene was standing very close to her. He huffed. Had he really gotten it all wrong?
John was sitting on the couch, Sherlock next to him. "John, tell me", Sherlock pleaded. "Please, I want to know." John shook his head and Sherlock took his hand. "John, tell me. I promise I won't find it embarrassing." John shook his head again, but Sherlock held up one hand to catch it. Sherlocks beautiful hands were now caressing his cheeks. "Please" But John only looked into his green eyes and leant in. Sherlock returned the gesture and suddendly they were kissing. John closed his eyes and leant into it.
He descended the stairs into the Hufflepuff common room and found Cedric Diggory, hopelessly trying to transfigurate some small object into a flower. "No, I don't want that, that's ghastly... a rose? too clichee. How about- no", the sixth year boy was murmuring. John approached carefully. "Everything alright?" "Trying to make a flower." "Trust me Ced, you're an ace at transfigurations, whatever it is, Cho will love it." Cedric looked at him in confusion but tried again. "Did you ask him, by the way?", Cedric asked after taking the unidentifiable flower into hand and walking towards the portrait entry. John stepped through. "Ask who?", he laughed. "Sherlock, of course." John laughed at that. Which made Cedric even more confused. "You're serious?" The champion nodded. "Sherlock is obviously going with his girlfriend." "Girlfriend?" "Yes, girlfriend. Who else would he be going with?" They were approaching the party, as the noises started to get louder. "Who is this girlfriend?" "Irene of course, I thought you knew!" Cedric stopped walking. "Irene is going out with Cho." John turned around. "What are you talking about, Cho is your date!" Cedric was now the one laughing. "What are YOU talking about, I asked Harry. Cho and Irene are dating and Sherlock and Irene are most definitely not a couple." Johns face suddendly flushed and Cedric laid an arm around his shoulder. "Hey, it's alright... oh wow." Then Cedric let go of his shoulder again because one Harry Potter was waiting in an emerald green cloak for him. "I'll see you later!", he called out to John.
The few days they still had left at Hogwarts were mostly spent trying to avoid other people. Everyone wanted to know about the graveyard and Sherlock was tired of retelling the story so they were hiding. At breakfast, John and Mike were comforting Molly, whose boyfriend turned out to be a gay deatheater. Stella and some of the Hufflepuff girls were there for the full show, having witnessed the breakup. The quidditch group met for one last match, this time including Viktor, Cho and Greg as chasers for team A, Irene and Harry as beaters for team A, Fleur as the keeper and Cedric as the seeker. Team B was made up of Sherlock, Fred and Angelina as chasers, John and George as beaters, Stella as a keeper and her friend Ian as seeker. Mike was cheering his girlfriend and even Molly was sat on the stands. But they weren't alone. A lot of people were watching the game. With almost everyone playing in unusual positions, the winner was hard to predict. The game was pretty close, only decided by Cedric's obvious talent as a seeker and Ian's lack thereof. But since noone really took it all that seriously, they were soon all flying jubilation rounds around the pitch, Stella stopping to kiss Mike, who had been sending her overtly cheesy air kisses all game long. Sherlock and John also flew out of the pitch to sneak off and kiss.
"Ex girlfriend, i suppose?" Sherlock came out of nowhere. "How the bloody hell do you know that?" "So she is" Sherlock smirked and dissappeared behind a shelf. John followed him but after rounding the corner of the shelf, Sherlock was gone.
After jogging through several floors, John halted at a statue of an old hag. "Let me find out how it opens", Sherlock excitedly said. He walked around the statue several times, eyes everywhere. John eyed him in wonder. Sherlock noticed but decided to act like he didn't. "The hump. That's where it opens. A password. Now that I can't know." "It's Dissendium.", John informed him. The hump immediately opened. "No Gunhilda, not now." It closed again. Sherlock smiled slightly. John returned it brightly. Then Sherlocks expression straightened. It was as if he was guarding himself. But John was planning on breaking through those walls. "Umm, may I ask where your potioneering facilities are located?" "The dungeons. It's near the Slytherin dormitories." "Lead the way then."
But it all got revealed to John once they left the last class. Because Sherlock dragged him by the robes into the Hufflepuff common room and started jinxing the fireplace. "What are you doing?" "Demolishing this enough so this part of the floo network won't show up in the ministry's tracking." Johns eyebrows furrowed. "Where are we going?" Sherlock gave him his 'isn't-it-obvious?' look. "Crime scene".
And so, about five minutes later, John climbed out the window, fully dressed. He settled on his broom and with a "Colloportus", sealed the door. They descended into the general direction of London. It was cold but Sherlock flew close to him and regularly cast new warming spells on them since they seemed to wear off after a certain time.
Sherlock tried to not let his annoyance show too much. He wasnt his even sure why he was annoyed at Irene for interrupting his conversation with the boy.
The next song, Victor joined in. The two were laughing and dancing together. John tried to ignore the grumbling feeling in his stomach or at least look away but he couldn't keep his eyes off of Sherlock. Two songs later, the two returned to the bar. Victor drank from his cocktail again and Sherlock sat down next to John on a barstool, still smiling. "Haven't done that in a while!" Victor grinned too do John forced himself to join in. "Not much of a dancer, are you?", Victor asked. John shook his head, still unable to form coherent thoughts. "Okay, try this." Victor held out his drink to Sherlock, who rolled his eyes and, to John's surprise, actually took a sip. "Disgusting." That made even John laugh.
The next morning, Sherlock was sitting at the Hufflepuff table when John entered, as usual. Unusually though, John indulged in a conversation with his Hufflepuff friends immediately.
"Greg, hi! Victor!", he greeted them. "Ah, Victor. This is Greg Lestrade." But Victor shook his head and patted Lestrade on the shoulder. "We've met." "Yeah, a few years back", Lestrade confirmed. They stepped into the living room. "New case?", Sherlock asked. "Triple homicide in St James. No tracks, no DNA, no nothing." Sherlock grinned. "We'll follow you!", he told Greg, making a shooing gesture at him. Sherlock pulled on his coat and threw John his. Then Sherlock grabbed both Victor and John by the shoulders and took them with him down the stairs.
When the song was over Sherlock went and held out his hand for John to take. "Me?" Sherlock just gave him a disappointed glance. "Yes, you." The 'obviously' didn't even need to be said aloud at this point. John shook his head and let out a strangled laugh. "I can't, no. Sit down." Sherlock did as requested. "I thought you wanted to, judging from the way you were staring at me." John almost choked on air. "I wasn't... Just... just wondering where you learnt to dance like that. Did you do that as a hobby or...?" "Ah. Well maman taught me. She thinks that it is a skill any young man should possess." John nodded, looking straight ahead. "Or woman for that matter, she taught Irene one summer." At that John internally winced with discomfort from being so harshly reminded of Irene but tried his hardest to not let it show on the outside. He couldn't tell whether Sherlock noticed or not. Then the song ended. "I want to catch another dance, this is fun. Do you mind?", Sherlock then asked. "Not at all!" And Sherlock was on the dancefloor again. 'Sweet how considerate he'd been', John thought to himself. 'Wait, not sweet of course'. John sighed. This was hard enough in real life, arguing with himself over it was getting exhausting.
The next day was Christmas eve. Shouting was heard throughout the entire day. "How ironic", John thought. They all went to church. It was tradition. And his mum insisted. And he didn't want to upset her so he just went along. Later, at the dinner table, his father glared in Johns general direction. John ignored it. If he did anything wrong, he knew he'd miss the blessed silence. Thankfully, Ma brought dinner. They started eating until they heard a knock on the door. "I'll go", John said, desperate to get away from the table.
Sherlock stepped out of the large fireplace into the living room. Irene and him bumped together. They then brushed it off and left their things on the ground next to the fireplace to look for their relatives. The first they found was, unfortunately, Mycroft. "Well hello brother mine, hello Irene." "Hi", Irene answered, Sherlock only scoffed. "Where's maman?" Mycroft pointed behind himself. "She's been trying to get me to eat her biscuits", he added. "As if you'd need any help in getting fat", Sherlock said while brushing past his brother. Irene surpressed her giggle.
So John did what any person would do and turned around, walking out of the corridor and into the kitchen to then grab his jacket, walk down the stairs and out of the building. John took a stroll at nearly 10 o'clock in the evening. His head was simultaneously empty and filled to the rim with questions. After walking all the way to St. James Park and back, John carefully opened the door to 221. He silently mounted the stairs and, upon hearing no noise whatsoever, the next stairs to go to bed. He didn't dare go down to brush his teeth.
Later at dinner, John talked to Cedric for a bit. Sherlock was late. "So the tournament. Are you alright?" Cedric nodded. They sat on opposite sides of the table. And John couldn't not notice Cedric looking at a point over his shoulder. John decided not to bring it up, knowing he was looking at someone sitting at the Gryffindor table. Sherlock finally arrived at the table, sitting down next to John as usual. "I ran into Irene and Cho on my way back from the bathroom. Greetings from Cho, Cedric." "Oh, you're the guy Irene has told me about!" They shook hands. "Sherlock Holmes" "Cedric Diggory, but I imagine you already know that." John was chewing at his cornish pastry and eyed the two in surprise. "What?", Sherlock asked, now automatically filling his plate up as well. John had expressed his disdain for Sherlocks eating habits before and in order to shut him up, Sherlock had agreed to eat at least one meal a day. "Nothing, just didnt expect you two to get along", John explained. Cedric pointed with his fork in the general direction of Sherlock and John. "So you two know each other, then?" Sherlock frowned. "Yes, obviously." "Friends?" They looked at each other and nodded slowly in unision. Cedric raised an eyebrow. John frowned. If he knew Irene, surely he must know of her and Sherlocks relationship. Sherlock apparently regarded the conversation as finished, digging into his roasted potatoes.
He didnt see Sherlock at dinner. John thought about going into the dungeons to get him but decided against it. He didnt really know why. He just thought that taking a small break from seeing Sherlock all the time might do him good. Eversince he found out about Irene and Sherlock he got a weird feeling, like he was somehow betraying someone if he spent too much time with Sherlock. Not that he fancied him, or boys for that matter. But he was taking time away from Irene and Sherlock. Who were together. His stomach cramped slightly at the thought. Irene, as Sherlocks girlfriend had first dibs on spending time with him and John didnt want to come between that, as a platonic companion. That was all there was to it.
"Not his date". How defensive he'd been. And why was Sherlock now having an emotional response to this? Its not like he ever had a shot...
Sherlock was also aware of whenever John was looking at him. By now Sherlock was sure that John had realised Sherlock's infatuation with him.  Except that John never said anything about it. But John was nice, Sherlock figured. Too nice. Nice enough not to end their friendship over Sherlocks stupid feelings. And Sherlock was glad about it. John's companionship meant the world to Sherlock.
They got back to Hogwarts after the meal. John spent the rest of the day with Greg. And Sherlock spent the rest if the day alone as Irene and Cho had some urgent matters to attend to. And both John and Sherlock tried their hardest to figure out why feelings were so complicated.
They were now running on the outside of the maze. "There's something wrong here. Notice how he always drinks from his own flask? And how we've seen him near the potions facilities? Snape accused Harry but it was Moody who stole. Boomslang skin. He's brewing polyjuice potion", Sherlock explained while running. "What?", John exclaimed, slightly out of breath. "Something's going to happen here. The maze, he designed it. He must've rigged it." Sherlock suddendly stopped running. "We have to warm them." John bumped into him. "Diffindo!", Sherlock shouted. Immediately, the side of the maze opened. They stepped inside. Sherlocks head whipped around, trying to find a way. Behind them, the maze closed again. "Magical maze, of course", John snorted. Sherlock gave him a weak smile and then grabbed his hand again, pulling him leftwards.
John was having none of it. He stormed after the boy who, despite his lanky appearance could compete in the running Olympics. But John knew the castle better and found a shortcut. Unfortunately he came through the secret tunnel at the same time the boy passed and they bumped together and both landed on the floor. "No, you won't run, stop it!" He rose his arm and the boy flinched. Johns face fell. "Were you- hey sorry... i don't want to hit you or hurt you in any way." The crease between the dark haired boys eyebrows deepened in disbelief. "That's... odd." John carefully asked:"What is?" "I can't detect a lie." John was baffled. "Well, cause I'm not. Lying. I just want to know who you are and how you knew about my father." The boy nodded. "I didn't stalk you or anything, if that's what you're concerned about. I just saw you were muggleborn and alongside a few other things, noticed the dog tags. And you were obviously too young, and while your brother or uncle would work, father is more likely." "What other things" The boy looked at him in wonder. He then caught himself and started speaking again at a pace which seemed to be reserved for only him as noone else John knew of could ratter down facts in such a rush. "I know he was a muggle and that he was an army doctor and you aspire to be a doctor too. Magical though. So healer. I know he hasn't got a good relationship with you or your brother, but with him especially. And I noticed your mobile device. Your brother gave it to you. Harry is worried about you and wants to stay in touch but you dont approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his girlfriend. And due to a traumatic event your muggle therapist thinks that limp you had was psychosomatic, quite correctly I'm afraid. But you're not limping anymore, are you? That's enough to be going on with, don't you think? Oh and the name's Sherlock Holmes." John was baffled. "That was amazing. Incredible." "You really think that?", the boy asked sheepishly. "Of course, it was quite... brilliant." Sherlock frowned. "That's not what people usually say." "Well, what do people usually say?" Sherlock smirked. "Piss off" John laughed at that. Sherlock joined in. "So what are you doing today, want me to give you a tour of the castle?", John grinned. Sherlock thought about that. "Do you know any secret passages?" "Sure!" John smiled evilish, something very unlike him. Sherlock could tell, he was an expert on people. And he accepted.
