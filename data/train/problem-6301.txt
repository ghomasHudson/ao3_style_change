"Hey, it's okay!" Tony tried to smile, but the dryness of his throat crept up to his lips. "I-It's getting late, you should get to sleep soon, it's a school night."
cheated on him.
Steve has never put a sketchbook down so quickly in his life. He quickly followed the billionare down the hall to his workshop. "Come sit."
"Listen closely, Stark. No matter how long you're here, or anyone for that fact, as long as you're here, it'll never be a home." Steve stormed into the room and pulled out a ratty backpack.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What? Why would you say that?" Steve grabbed his hand.
Though Liz does often cross the sophomore's mind, it was actually not thinking of the beautiful senior. He was thinking about his deadbeat father again. Ever since his fifteenth birthday, he's been asking more questions about him. Peter knew his dad was alive, he didn't quite know who or where he is... but he must be out there somewhere, right?
"Hey, Peter?"
"Dumbass. Fuck wad. Idiot. Douche nozzle. Peter. Parker. Peter Benjamin Parker, talk to me." A hand connected with the back of his head.
"I want you out of my house before you corrupt my kids like Clint corrupted you." Laura growled, picking up Nathaniel and carrying him out of the room. As soon as she left, Cooper broke down and Lila slipped out.
"You're pan!"
MJ looked pissed, considering she really hates Peter's dad, and Ned looked worried, considering he really loved Peter's dad.
Clint coughed loudly, face flushing bright red. Thankfully, Peter and Tony came in and distracted Cooper and Lila. "Morning, Barton Bunch."
"I mean somewhat, but I got to kiss you."
"Yeah, I am. What's your name?"
"Wh-What do you mean I'm not?" Peter squeezed his hand harder.
"Quiet. Do you know how dangerous running around in a flimsy suit without any backup is?"
Steve hates feeling this way.
"Clint likes to crawl through the vents- wait, you threatened my kid?" Tony yelled.
"Heck yeah! Just get us some pepperoni."
"Hello?"
Peter huffed quietly and picked up his book bag again. "Fine."
"Oh boy-"
"Wh-What am I supposed to do now?"
"Okay, buddy."
Steve decided thinking was dumb and he didn't like it. Thinking kept getting him into sticky situations and supplied his with idiotic plans. Like flirting with a girl to get Tony jealous instead of just talking to Tony like a competent human would. Thinking also made Steve, in all honesty, despise himself in every single way. The worst fault in a human, Steve used to believe, was not having self confidence and finding yourself detestable. Now Steve has claimed that worst fault. Thinking made Steve wonder about if Tony was truly happy with Steve out of his life. Thinking made Steve want to fling himself out of a window.
"He's a teen! They always sneak out! Ya gotta let kids live!"
"I'm hungry too, Daddio," Lila muttered into the side of his ribs. Clint groaned louder.
Peter hugged him. "I love you too, Dad."
"Okay, kiddo."
Steve smiled softly. "You're such a great dad, Tones."
Cooper settled himself next to Peter. "How you holdin’ up?"
Maybe Tony's a little more ready than he thinks.
"What?!" Clint turned to see his kart's ground wheels centimeters from the line, him officially in twelfth. "No!"
"You'll be fine, Petey," Cooper grumbled, still half asleep. "If they don't accept you, I'll just kidnap you, don't worry."
Nat quickly shoved the cloth into the ceiling panel before sitting on the bed with the suit.
Tears were coming to Tony's eyes now. "H-His name is Peter and-"
"Tony's a genius."
"Alright. I’m down."
Tony was so taken aback, any angry thoughts swimming in Tony's head disappeared. So many words were bubbling in his throat. He felt as if he was going to throw up. Despite Peter facing the ground, Tony could see the tears streaming down his face. Steve was right. He was already fucking up the kid's life.
"Wait, but how'd you know?"
"Oh, God, what's wrong, Peter?" MJ asked, clear look of annoyance on her face.
Peter nodded softly, a wave of nausea immediately wiping over him. He started to bring up his arms to sign but... he gasped loudly. He breathed heavily, little squeaky noises coming from the back of his throat. "Da-D-Da-"
He stood back up, climbing the stairs to go to the living room. Maybe he'll do better sleeping on that couch.
Tony shook his head, a habit he picked up when he was trying to clear his mind. He stood up straight and made his way out. He called Happy to make him drive Tony to Brooklyn.
"Dad?"
"I mean-"
Steve chuckled. "Christ, son, calm down. That boy is hungrier than a lion, he'll be down eventually."
"D-Dad?"
The train eventually shuddered to a stop, a group of people stumbling and shoving out, MJ and Peter included. MJ held tight onto the hood of Peter to make sure the smaller boy from falling over from all the harsh shoving. As little as she wants to admit it, MJ is definitely the parent of the group.
"You could never bother me, kid. I promise. If you need anything, call me and at the drop of the hat I'll be there." Tony smiled. "Plus your no longer grounded."
Steve feels almost guilty when he believes it was Clint's fault. But maybe, just maybe, if Clint sounded the alarm earlier, Peter would be in Tony's arms again.
"You know what, Tony? You're making this all about yourself, when it isn't. All that happened is that Peter came out, a situation where he needs
"He mentioned... them... didn't he?"
MJ parked and stepped out, Ned quickly following, then Cooper stepping out too. Peter was at the door waving at them. MJ shoved his shoulder.
These kids are too damn smart. Ned began zooming out, looking for Peter's, or Karen's, current dot.
Tony walked in to see Steve doodling, which slapped a smile of the billionaire's face. He loves Steve's drawings.
"I have alerted Dr. Banner about your current condition due to Captain Rodgers' Panic Protocol."
"It's fine, Pete. I was only kidding- well, you are getting snot all over my shirt, but I'm not angry." Tony laughed, placing his chin on his head.
Peter smiled back, face turning bright red. He hid his head in his hands. "Oh my God, I can't believe I did that."
"And Peter, you're grounded. For two weeks."
"Hey, hey, why are you sorry?" Tony touched his shoulder, Peter flinching back.
natasha and tony find two different but important things
Peter stayed quiet, just holding him and running his hands through his hair. After a minute of Cooper just sobbing into his shoulder, he finally lifted his head. "I'm sorry-" Cooper had a little hiccup-laugh. "I kiss a boy then break down crying, I'm doin' great, huh?"
"You're just mad you're bad at Jenga!"
"I didn't! And I didn't want to leave you guys! I fought my ass off for custody!"
Clint chuckled softly. Bucky smiled at him, quietly asking, "You feelin' better, Clinton."
Clint was shaking, which was never a good thing. If he's shaking, he's panicking. If he's panicking, he can't shoot straight. He started scratching at his arm.
"It's not Sam, Stevie."
a yes, right?"
Cooper's heart was
Peter smiled sheepishly.
"K-Karen? Where are we?"
"Fri, where's my dad?"
Sadly, the last one they got to do, was
"Uh, yes. Who are you exactly?"
"Jokes on you guys, I got a special tip from someone who goes to school with Peter!" the fourth lady squealed.
The girl growled angrily. She grabbed the back of his mask and forcefully unzipped it. As she yanked it from his face, she gasped.
"He and Mrs. Romanoff are out of the house until later tonight under classified information."
He made his way down to where Tony showed him where the kitchen was. He stopped hearing harsh whispers coming from the room. Thank goodness for spidey-hearing.
"To why you cheated on mom and left your kids? No thanks."
Sam turned his head a bit too far to the right and spotted Steve. The man snapped to his feet and stormed over to the two super-soldiers. "Steven Grant Rogers! What in
"So, yeah, Clint's my dad. He's an asshole that cheated on my mom."
Peter started hyperventilating, trying to get a better grip on Clint. He was sobbing into his chest, and he felt like he was going to throw up. "E-Everyone will h-h-ha-hate me!"
Steve shouldered the backpack. "Never say I never did anything for you, Tony. Because I told you something neither yourself or anyone else would tell you. The truth."
peter gets in trouble but he also makes new friends
Okay, so Peter is fine. He's just paranoid.
Before Cooper left, Peter grabbed his hand. "Cooper, if you ever need to talk about your dad, I'm right here, okay?"
She swiped through his closet, before spotting bright red at peeking out of the ceiling panel at the top of his closet. She pushed it open, a bright red onesie falling out. Nat almost snorted. Was that- yes it is.
They shuffled off to bed, Clint making sure to stay right by his side.
He was cut off by Peter slamming into his chest.
peter tries his best
"I do!"
Peter choked on his own air. "I almost died?!"
"Sorry, bud, it's true!"
"You wouldn't talk to me and I don't like being ignored," the taller girl smirked, hopping over the bench. "So, whatcha thinking 'bout?"
"You want to be like this, huh?"
"So, the winner of our challenge is..."
"No god damn archery!"
"Th-There was a thing on the TV a-and it was on a rumor show b-b-ut it was true a-and-" Peter took a deep breath in. "I-I'm tr-trans."
"'Sup, loser?"
"It's not waste if I'm drinking it."
Half asleep, Peter mumbled back, "'night, Dad."
It tasted funny.
"Do you want mine? Her name's Lila, she's eleven, and currently
"Are you thinking of taking Laura back to court? Get official custody of your kids again?"
She checked his bed before making it again, under his weirdly clean bed, rifled through his drawers and and wardrobe and nothing. Not even
"I was digging through your last custody battle and I found a game changer!"
"What?" Tony huffed.
"You and Steve should go. Outside of the suits. I-I don't think this is exactly a problem for the big guy." Bruce sunk down in his chair.
Tony paused for a minute. "Why are you always right?"
Tony sighed. "To apologize for being a shitty dad. I understand what it's like to grow up without that father figure, actual father figure in your life, and that's what I did to you. Once I came into your life, I forced myself into that role not even considering if you'd want me to be there. And then I yelled at you when I didn't even set an actual curfew! I was just-" Tony forced himself to take a breath, trying to keep his emotions down. "I was just really worried, okay, Peter?"
Peter felt useless.
"No! They're all cis guys just freaking sweating testosterone! It's kinda terrifying!"
"If you do, you shouldn't have just walked out. He's probably freaking terrified that you're gonna kick him out. Bruce has been trying his best to distract him, but he's not his dad. You are. And, honestly, don't even get me started on what you said to poor Clint-"
"It's just my job. Now go get your seat."
"I'm on it. Avengers, assemble."
Peter gripped onto his shirt and squeezed his eyes shut, focusing on the rise and fall of Clint's chest. He tried his best to sync their breathing.
"That's so homophobic!" Peter squeaked angrily.
Clint gasped in fake hurt. "How dare you, Petey? I thought we were friends!"
"Just, what if instead of kicking him out, she hurt him, sent him to some fuckin' conversion camp or tried to beat the gay outta' him, just-" Clint wiped one eye roughly. "I'm worried."
"Coop-" Peter whispered.
Natasha was a scary person, to anyone really. So when a teenage boy came face to face with her at his house's doorway, it's reasonable to believe he was close to passing out.
He jogged up the stairs just in time to grab Peter as he left the elevator. Peter's hood was covering his face but by the sniffling, Tony knew he was crying.
Peter rolled his eyes. He looked Steve into his stupid blue eyes. "I'm sorry,
Peter started frantically signing help. Clint brought him to his chest. "Shh, calm down. It's alright."
"Y-Yessir."
"It means that home has family," Steve yelled, voice starting to waver. "You aren't family to anyone, and you never will be. Sure, maybe biologically with Peter, but you'll fuck things up with him to eventually."
"And second of all, find out how to explain to your kid your ex has been lying to him."
with her mom! My little sister thinks it's the funniest thing."
He felt a cold hand on his shoulder. Clint blinked through his tears, trying to see who was in front of him.
"Pete-"
"Did someone give you a pep talk so you believed you could win, Mr. Hawkeye?"
"Thank you."
"Yeah, what's up?"
Clint almost dropped his pot. "How'd you get that to work?"
Peter growled under his breath. While shaking Steve's hand, he whispered, where only Steve could hear him, "If you hurt my dad, I will destroy you."
Peter smiled softly. "Love you too, Dad."
Peter sprinted towards the buildings, shoving through the annoying crowds. He could hear MJ screaming his name from behind but he didn't care. His aunt was in there. She was weak since she caught the flu. He has to safe her.
"Just because you fucked up your family doesn't mean you get to stick your nose into mine."
Peter grinned. "I didn't think they'd believe me."
"Well, then, hey, Ned and MJ."
Also, Cooper with glasses? Peter is the gayest boy alive.
Clint knew it wouldn’t work.
"Dad! Pops! Anyone!"
"Oh yeah? Let's go, homo." Clint grabbed a controller. "You're a lesbian, right?"
Clint defended, "I didn't know it was your kid! It was a random child in the living room!"
"I think you should. For Clint's sake."
Peter shuffled up to Tony and Clint took his place. Peter felt as if he was going to hyperventilate, His childhood heroes were all sitting in front of him like normal people! Was he supposed to introduce himself? Were his eyes bugging out of his head? Is that why Natasha is sending him a sympathetic look?
Next was
"Then why didn't he come get me?"
‘Not u?’
"Bucky!" a voice groaned from inside a blonde shuffled to the door, leaning against the doorframe. "Oh. Hi, Spider-boy."
"Sup, lo- oh my god."
"Hey, kid, I'm gonna be in my lab, you have free range of the tower other than Nat's room!"
"Fri, what time is it?"
insulted him and his family and even Peter himself! Then he ran off to Bucky like Tony said he would!
"How is she doing?"
"M-Mom-"
"I know, still nervous."
"Oh, yes! Continue, young Peter!"
Tony clutched the table in front of him. "You think I don't know that? I'm- I just need time to process and research and get the facts-"
"Oh my Thor."
"How are you-"
Clint balled his fists up. Don't punch him, don't punch him, don't punch him, Barton.
"My mom is the most loving, caring person in the world. Go to hell, Clint."
"Oh, I-I'm sorry, M-Mister Barnes."
MJ rolled her eyes. "You're dad's a cunt."
Steve presses a kiss to Tony's temple before going to change. Tony took a deep breath in and out. It will be fine. He will be fine.
"Tony's heading back as quickly as he can, Pepper even got him out of seven meetings."
He thinks.
And then Tony kissed him. Steve curled his hands into the front of Tony's shirt, keeping him right where he wanted him. Slowly, Tony broke away from the kiss, resting his forehead on Steve's. "I love you too, Stevie."
Nearly two hours into the battle, after Lila and Cooper shared their opinions, Bridgette could tell their lead was slipping, so she brought out the big guns.
Steve's eyes shot open.
"M-Mom... I'm pansexual and..." Cooper took a deep breath in and out. "I'm dating Peter."
Even after all of Peter's friend, he was still dwelling on the fact that even years after he was denied of having custody of his kids, his own fucking flesh and blood, she's still ripping his children away from him. He felt tears stream down his face.
"Parker. I mean- I'm Parker. Peter. Parker. Parker Peter. I mean- Peter Parker. Yeah."
"I'm sorry," she began before Steve shushed her. He closed his eyes and listened closely.
"Yeah, why?"
"How many trackers do you have on him?"
"What? Why would I want you to leave? You're family, Peter."
"Unless you did something really fucked-"
"My ma' had to pick up another job while we were still out in Iowa... and life just got so fuckin' much harder... and just... god dammit."
"Well? Tell us, Stevie."
Oh, yeah. And thinking made Steve want to punch himself in the face since he didn't want to worry Bucky.
"Pete-"
"Shh, it’s okay, it’s okay," Steve whispered into his ear.
Nat sighed. "You really had to inherit the self-sacrificial hero aspect, didn't you?"
"Ch-Charlie."
"Peter. You got this. If you need to get off stage, tap my knee three times, alright?" Tony said.
"But they don't have to today. And if this is too much for you, I can help."
"Oh, shit, yeah!"
Tony's eyebrows furrowed. Of course he gave Peter anxiety, he has all the shitty genes.
One week later, Aunt May was buried next to Peter's mom and her husband Ben.
Tony was, and is, a curious mind. Therefore, when he found a few things Steve left behind, he had the compulsive urge to look through them. These belonging included an old sketch book and the  Stark Industries laptop Tony gifted him after the attack on New York. He opened the old, clunky frame, thinking about all the redesigns he could do and what he should've done better.
"It is 00:00, sir."
Tony flew into the tower in a flurry. His hair was a mess, shirt half unbuttoned and tie barely hanging on. He was on the edge of sobbing again and freaking out. He was yelling orders about calling the police, filing missing persons reports, getting the best people on this case no matter what the hell they were currently working on. Steve even had to grab him and keep his from climbing into his suit and going to find Peter himself.
"Sir, Mister Parker has entered the tower and appears distressed," F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s voice chimed.
"You getting dressed up for a pretty girl."
Steve sat down with his coffee, just letting the warmth of the drink soak into his hands. He stared into the black coffee before tilting his head back and swallowing it all.
"What point, being an absolute fucking asshole?!"
"Don't lie, Charlie!" A high voice yelled from upstairs.
Meanwhile, Peter was riding the elevator up to the top floor. Even though he knew he was gonna get fussed at, he was still kinda over the moon from Cooper.
But it was worth it.
Peter sprinted up to the lab, dropping his backpack by the door. "Hey, Dad! Can I use your lab a bit?"
"Who-Who are you? Where am I? You gotta tell me!"  Peter demanded, trying to tug at his bonds. His ankles were tied to the legs of the chairs, his arms tied behind his back, both with rope. He should be able to simply break the thread apart, but... he's just so tired. He could barely keep his head up.
"Dad-"
Clint groaned loudly. "Fri, show Cooper where the kitchen is."
Peter took a deep breath in and out. "I think I'm ready."
The door shut and Tony rushed down to his lab and started on some research. He had no clue how to raise a teenager... so he was sinking down to the level he never thought he would go to. He was going to read parenting blogs. He went into incognito mode on google and typed in
"Hey, guys, Peter wants to talk with everyone."
Clint lowered his bow. "I'll check that. And while I'm gone, don't move."
"Uh, Mr. Hawkeye-"
Peter buried his face into his knees, choking out breaths between sobs. Ned went to comfort him, but MJ grabbed Ned's shoulder and whispered, "Give him a little time."
"Guys," he whispered. "Peter’s missing."
Right?
"Well, 'm gonna have to, ya know? Coop's been kicked out, I know Lila walked out with him, but technically she's more of a stowaway, and I just wanna see little Nathaniel again."
Peter’s physical therapist was named Jonathan. Apparently he was the same PT that helped Tony after New York (falling from the sky isn’t the best on the body). One day after his session, his dad shoved a pile of red and blue into his arms. He slowly unfolded it to reveal an updated Spidey suit.
"Sir, Master Peter has arrived home with his friends."
"It’ll be okay."
Clint and Cooper groaned loudly, making Bucky chuckle. "C'mon, let's go."
"You know, when was the last time you even saw them?"
They climbed the stairs together. Tony tucked him into bed and watched over him until he was fast asleep. Tony was so worried about him having another nightmare, he fell asleep in the little wooden chair in the corner of Peter's room.
Peter let out another squeak as he lifted up his arm, only for two hundred pound of America gently slam into his chest. His arms wrapped around Peter’s torso, and Peter wrapped his arm around his neck. Peter sniffled.
"Just two kids named Flash and Skip, okay? Please just drop it. I came down here to apologize anyways."
"So," Steve started, pulling out of the school's parking lot, "how was school?"
Peter bowed his head. "That's why he won't? Please don't tell him, Nat! If I'm not out there saving people, no one will be!"
Peter's eyes widened as he inhaled deeply. "Yeah."
MJ swallowed awkwardly. "Peter, I'm sorry-"
"Sorry the house is a mess, wasn't expecting company. This is my son, Charlie, and that's Mandy at the table. My other daughter is upstairs."
clint loves his family
"I was wrong, Tony," Steve persisted, walking up behind Tony. "I was so wrong. You're an amazing father. The way you act around that kid is so caring, it's never anything I've seen from you before. But it's amazing. And you guys are amazing."
Peter awkwardly walked onto the stage, waving at the audience. Tony flashed him a thumbs up. Peter walked over to the white couch and sat down, holding his hound out for Ellen. No, not just Ellen, but
"Is your boyfriend coming, Dad?"
"Th-Then- oh. Hi, Dad."
"Oh, my sweet little spider, my name is Mandy and where you are isn't important." He felt a finger lead along his masked cheek. The struggle to keep his head up left him only able to see the tip of her nose and below. "May I look at your face, my spider prince?"
Tony kissed his forehead. "Oh, shit. It's already ten. It's a school night."
In the living room, Clint had already taken out his bright purple hearing aids as soon as the two walked into the kitchen alone. It seemed as if the other Avengers were 100% used to this, which freaked Peter out even more.
"...dad...!"
"Hey, Fri, tell Dad I'm home. I know he wanted to talk to me."
"Yeah, seems that way!" He grinned excitedly.
"Look, Mr. Rogers, I don't like you. And I honestly doubt you like me. We're only hanging out because we both love my dad. And I don't trust you with him, but for his sake, I'll play nice. Just... stop pretending like we're friends."
"He cheated on me."
Clint smiled. Bucky kissed his head. "There's your lawyer. You got this, babe."
"I love you, Dad."
"Please be somewhat nice to him, please, okay?" Peter begged softly.
"I wanna see Dad too, Coop. And what Mom's doing... it's bullshit. You can love who ever the hell you want, Coop. And Peter's pretty great. Now, are we going or what?"
"Damn, should just hold your hand next time so I don't lost, huh?"
Peter accidentally lost Cooper multiple times, considering his height and Peter's anti height, but they eventually made it to homeroom.
"Absolutely nothing would make me happier than you getting the hell out of my life."
"Hey, dad!"
They went through a few more, finishing with
"Go to hell. My mom would never hate anyone because of that. And you're trying to say she's a liar."
Peter and the stylists casually chatted while they prettied Peter up. Once Peter was released, Tony grabbed his shoulders.
Tony looked disgusted. "Who let you in my building?"
"It's Spiderman."
"What's goin' on here?"
He read his aunt's will which gave everything she owned to Peter, including his mother's will. And at the bottom of his mother's name was a name and an address preceded by a sentence.
He kissed him.
"Yes, sir. Mr. Barton is on his way to Peter's room."
They quickly did their handshake, or as quickly as they could with how ridiculously long it was, as MJ walked up. MJ didn't greet them with her normal playful insults. "Hey, Peter. Anything any better?"
"Fine, I won't tell him unless you get hurt, understood?"
That next morning, Peter found Steve in the kitchen, drinking coffee. As he slipped his Pop Tarts into the toaster, he smiled at Steve. "Thanks for talking to my dad last night."
"You really know how to throw a punch, don't you, Peter?"
"Hey, bird bitch. I bet I could beat you in Mario Kart," MJ bragged, purposely insulting him to test his coolness even though Peter was giving him that 'MJ what the heck are you doing?' look.
"I know, but my dad doesn't even seem like a fish per-"
"Peter deserves to know the truth about douchebag guys he should look out for, Rogers."
It was more than a nightmare. It was like a night terror. He kept replaying the same scene, over and over and over. Every time he'd try to do something different, Aunt May would scream louder. The smoke would get thicker. He's become more useless to help. He died. He died and Aunt May died and MJ died because she came to try to rescue himself. And it was all Peter's fault. His shitty old computer caught fire and killed his Aunt May.
"N-No! It's still Peter. I'm a trans guy."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't get anyone pregnant."
"Peter, what happened?" he asked gently.
Bucky called over his shoulder, "That's assault!"
Peter froze. No. Nononono.
"Petra? Who the hell is Petra- do you mean Pietro? Why would I date Pietro, he and his sister tried to kill me in Sokovia!"
"D-Dad! I was at my friend's house working on a project!"
He sat the mug down, cracking his fingers. "Why not? I don't have anything better to do."
"I should go talk to Tony and Pete, huh?" Steve tried to half smile.
"Clint, you really got to get better at this."
"Oh, yeah. Your mom just conveniently didn't tell your douchebag dad you were a thing. It's not like he just abandoned you."
"Yeah, Dad. Let's do it. Let's kick her ass!"
"Are you pregnant, young Peter?" Thor rumbled.
"I said I'm not hungry."
Bucky turned and motioned for Tony to follow. "Hey, Stevie? Someone's here to see you."
"I-I kinda begged him not to be here for this. I think he went with Tony to Miami this morning since he isn't here."
"I realize that, it's just... Clint looks so genuinely destroyed. I want to help in some way. And I still don't know why in hell Laura and he broke up."
"But I'm not, Cooper!" Clint snapped. "That's why your mom hates me! It's because I'm bisexual! Your mom's a homophobic bitch!"
Lila's eyes fluttered open. "Dad? You're actually here, right? This isn't a dream?"
"So, Tony Stark has a son?" the main blonde woman smirked.
.  His arms were crossed and his usually glistening sky blue eyes were frozen ice cold. Tony could tell his teeth were clenched by his jaw. And honestly? He looked hot.
As the elevator door slid open, Clint's face was revealed to his two kids.
"I'm going to go train if you wanna join me, Steve," the red head offered, shrugging her shoulders.
"So," Ellen said. "You're Tony Stark's son?"
"Yeah, my family has no clue."
"Oh, we're gonna have fun, Petey."
"What about two things you can smell?"
"Hey, Dad! I didn't know you were picking me up!"
in his support system with him, alright? He didn't even willfully come out, he was outed by a god damn gossip show! And you're acting like you're being personally victimized. News flash, Tony, your life isn't all about you. It's about your son now too."
"Bye, Coop."
"'Cause he didn't want to bother you and fuckin' Rogers! And I was the only one up and I saw that bullshit on TV so I had to help him."
"Hey, my dad's outside."
"Pops?"
you should really focus on selling d&d
Nat smiled at the boy as she walked out. She didn't ask about the cloth in his closet because Peter will come out as transgender when he's ready.
"N-No. I didn't- I would- I would never hurt you on purpose, Tony."
Cooper leaned over and buried his face into Peter's shoulder, letting out hiccupy sobs. Peter wrapped his arms around his tightly.
peter is saved
"So, Peter, or should I say Penelope is a tranny."
Peter flicked his arm.
Peter was choking on his own breath. Tears were welling up in his eyes.
MJ snorted, "We can tell."
"Sir, please-"
"He's doing it again," Ned whispered loudly to MJ. Peter flushed, focusing back in on the conversation.
"How do you know-"
Peter huffed.
Peter may have gotten himself in the middle of a mugging of a girl that he could tell was going to a far, far worse place that made Peter want to actually kill the asshole. And he was extremely late. Tony was going to kill him. The elevator dinged open way too loudly, and revealed a very angry Tony.
"R-Really?"
"They're find out one way or the other-"
Cooper shuffled out of his sweatshirt, now trying on a tee shirt.
"S-Sorry."
Peter's face went pale. How was he going explain to Captain America he's Tony Stark's lost fifteen year old son? A hand rested on the teen's shoulder. "C'mon, Pete, let me show you your room."
And like that, Peter hopped off the building and started swinging towards Manhattan. He knew Spiderman fighting Captain America wouldn't be the best press of the vigilante. He perched himself on a tall skyscraper as he watched the sun go down. He let his eyes flutter close and the dipping sun shone on his face. He couldn't believe he actually felt bad for Steve Rogers. He may be a jerk, but he still looked... heartbroken! Why? He was the one who hurt his dad! He had no reason to be mad.
Clint socked him in the jaw.
Cooper groaned and flopped onto the nearest chair. Cooper set Lila down onto the chair, ruffling her hair. "Dad!"
"So, I'm going to work on some stuff. You can read, explore, mess with scraps, just don't break anything. And word of the wise, don't touch Tasha's shit. She might kill you."
"You're not gonna get them."
Peter leaned into his side and hugged him. Cooper gently wrapped his arm around him.
"Yes, Tony, that's typically what parents do when their child is in distress."
"To be fair, your dad is stupid."
Steve furrowed his eyebrows. "Does this have anything to do with Peter not talking to him?"
"Bu-" Peter huffed. "Sorry."
Clint ruffled his hair and kept walking. Bruce smiled at Peter and patted the seat next to him. "C'mon. Let's talk."
"What is trans?"
Cooper flopped onto his bed, clicking his TV onto chomecast, casting Hulu onto the screen. Peter laid down on the bed and curled into his side, Cooper looping his arm around Peter. He laid his head on his boyfriend's chest, pulling his focus to Gordon Ramsey angry words.
"Ok! Talk away, Daddio."
Tony chuckled as he drove home, sometime peeking back at the three teens in the back, Peter wildly chatting and the other two just listening. Tony quickly pulled into the tower's parking garage and parked.
Tony hit literally every single lose money opportunity and Clint spent money where ever he could.
"Sir, if you're worried I'd ever hurt Peter, I'd rather saw off my left foot with my own bow and arrow-"
Cooper laughed, placing his arm over the couch, kinda around Peter. He's trying to be smooth. (It's not working.)
"Sir, please, this is important."
sorry for not updating!! the good news is i passed all my exams!!
"It's okay, Peter. I know you've been having a rough time recently- holy shit, what happened?" Tony rushed forward, examining the bruise closer. Peter swallowed hard.
"Peter-"
"Yeah! They're really nice. Come on, I wanna watch Buzzfeed Unsolved. The TV in the living room is huge!"
He was going to find his dad.
"Fuck off, Buchanan."
(He of course said yes.)
Steve sighed, standing up and following Bucky into the kitchen.
Peter grinned. "They’re cooler!"
Steve gripped his hand. He glanced over at Mandy who was shifting back and forth nervously.
"Hey, Ms. Barton, I've heard about you too!"
"Thank you."
"Hey, Petey." Peter opened his mouth to speak when Tony stopped him. "Don't try to speak, your vocal chords are healing, buddy. You should be fine."
"Hey, Coop, wheres Peter?"
Cooper grinned. "So I'm guessing that's a yes?"
"Hi, Wilson."
"Emphasis on
Tony (reluctantly) followed the stupidly handsome super-soldier. For the first time in forever, Steve actually looked mad. Not sad, not desperate, but
Peter smiled softly. "Really?"
"D-Dad?"
"You didn't start the fire, right?" Peter sniffled, tears starting to stream down his cheeks. "I-I brought you a picture of you and my mom if that would help you believe I'm your son."
Peter, sniffling and trying to hide his tears, shuffled off quickly to his room. Tony slowly sunk down to sit on the couch. He leaned his head back as he tried to slow his breathing. "Fri, send someone to check on Peter. Clint's probably the best option, Pete seems to like him."
Clint started crying again. "Too late to do anything about it, though. Cooper hates me, Lila probably hates me, and Nathaniel will grow up hating me. What the fuck am I supposed to do about it."
"Of course, Liles."
"Mister Barton is already in the kitchen drinking his daily second pot of coffee."
"Peter, stop thinking. I can hear those gears a-grinding in that head of yours. Now, when you're ready, we'll go in."
"Sh-she's dead, sir. Since 2006."
"Tony, literally no one in this tower is stra-"
"Okay, Dad! Thank you!" Peter turned to his friends, giant grin on his face.
. "No, I'm just going to a friends house for the night."
"Hey, Tony, there's a kid in the living room saying-"
The elevator dinged open to reveal the compound's common room, the smell of Sam's vanilla candles and Natasha's lilac Febreeze mixed in the air. Clint was collapsed on top of the back of the couch, an empty mug resting on his chest. Sam was chatting with Natasha, both on the couch, polishing weapons from the gym. Thor was on the end of the couch with Bruce resting in his lap. Steve can't remember the last time the tower was so domestic.
"What?"
Steve crouched down in front of him. He couldn't be more than seven. "Hey, son. Is your ma home?"
"No. I don't need any broken ribs, alright?"
"I know, and I know I should have called you, but I got distracted and I didn't want to wake you up and bother you-"
"Hey, Pete, come sit."
"It all happened after the whole Sokovia thing. He came back... my mom found out... her name was fuckin' Petra or something." Cooper wiped at his eyes. "He was in and out of our lives for about a year then he just... left. Without any warning."
"Well, Charlie, can you do me a favor and go get your mom?"
"Hey, mom? Can I tell you something?" Cooper asked, voice slightly wobbled. Peter squeezed his hand gently under the table.
"S-So, um, th-there's something I need to say?"
Steve stood up with him, hand still gripping his own.
"Clint is my dad."
"That's Ned and that's Michelle, but call her MJ."
Steve became so ultimately pissed off, he tore the door right off the hinges and threw it down the hall. "Oh, now you're ruining my home, huh?"
He let his eyes slip shut.
"Oh so you didn't just run away with that bitch Petra?!" Cooper crossed his arms, raising his eyebrows in a very Barton-like way.
MJ pulled into the parking garage with the special pass Peter gave her. "Don't worry, Cooper. Peter's family is really accepting."
"I do when you don't realize you're hurting yourself!"
"Look, Tony, shouldn't I know the teen that living in our ho-"
"You're gonna regret ignoring me, Penelope!"
So that night, paparazzi caught Peter Parker-Stark sitting on a cub of New York with an unidentified boy.
"I'm bi," Peter muttered.
Meanwhile, Peter was staring with awe at his new room. It was twice as big as his old apartment alone. Peter's fingers started drumming against his thighs, anxiety swelling up at the fact that any of his current reality could actually be happening to him. What did he do to deserve it? He just flung himself around Queens, stopping guys who were trying to break into their own cars.
"With eye contact. And more respect."
The door swung open to a smiling Peter. "Oh, hey, Nat! What's-"
They were called into the station to give the police all the information they know. Tony was hunched in on himself, like the photos he's seen of his boyfriend from when he first came back from Afghanistan.
"Yes, Pete, I know."
"Everyone, shut up. We're playing the Game of Life then Jenga and maybe Twister," Tony snapped. "And Peter gets first choice!"
Where the fuck is his parental radar?
Clint wishes he wasn’t bisexual.
He slipped on a nice patterned button up and some jeans paired with his red converse after struggling with his binder. He breathed in and out deeply, his hands shaking. He didn't want to bother his friends, but god he'd love some comfort in this ridiculous scenario.
"It's Peter Parker, sir."
"But-"
Steve shifted uncomfortably, Peter switching on a random radio station. They sat in uncomfortable silence until Steve pulled into the Avenger's garage, Peter hopping out almost as soon as he parker.
Rhodey ended up with thirteen children but was still in first. At least until he hit a square where he had to pay $500 for each child to go to summer camp, which made Sam and Clint cry of laughter.
"Hey, dad? Would you mind staying the night with me?"
"Peter? Do you like it?"
tony loves his boys
"I hate him-" he sobbed. "I hate him so fucking much, Pete. He fucked over my entire family, Pete... do you know how much fuckin' money my mom had to spend on those fucking divorce and custody lawyers, and just-"
"Dad, it's Ellen!"
Peter slowly sat next to Steve, scooting as far away from the man as possible. Tony sighed. "Peter, you know why you're in here."
He grabbed some sticky notes and a sharpie from the bad side table, handing them both to Peter. In extremely shaky hand writing due to the non dominant hand, he wrote, 'Pops.'
His lawyer was a spunky 27 year old named Bridgette who's already made a name for herself in New York as one of the best custody lawyer money can buy.
"Well, my- our son was kidnapped recently and- and I had a blip on the radar from him and this- this was his last known location-"
"No. You need to go the hell upstairs and show your son you still love him. 'Cause if I was him, I'd think you hated me."
"Come on, I made your favorite sandwich! And later I may make some apple pie if you eat now."
Natasha watched Ned frantically typing on his laptop as they sat on the couch. He pulled up a program with way too many colored dots to count. He typed some more and most disappeared, but it still looked like a clown threw up on it. Especially on Avengers Tower.
"Yessir." Peter smiled softly, creeping into his room. "Goodnight... dad."
"I said I don't want to talk about it!" Peter yanked his wrist away and stormed to his room.
"Oh, hon, call me Laura."
After school, Peter still ended up walking home with his annoying friend. Every time the train car rumbled or jumped, either him or MJ would try to shove the other down, giggling wildly. No matter how annoying she got, Peter couldn't imagine life without MJ. They became friends once Peter first came out and was called a rude slur before MJ kicked the guy in the nuts.
"But, Dad, he's my boyfriend-"
"Of course it is, darling!
"S-Sure?"
"No, but I'll get Pep right on it. Taking Laura back to court?"
Meanwhile, Natasha knew something was up with Tony's kid. She couldn't place her finger on what exactly it was, but she knew it was something. The fact that she couldn't figure it out was driving her absolutely
"It's fine, kid," Bucky chuckled. "Sorry about your ice cream."
"MJ, he's not-"
"Peter!" Tony waved at the young boy, noticing his eyes lighting up, even from across the street. He ran across the street, making Tony have a mini heart attack since he didn't even look both ways, but he was bumped out of that headspace when his kid headbutted him in the chest as he hugged him. Tony smiled and hugged him back. "Hey, kiddo."
"I do not mind at all! Let me get ready for bed first, you should too, kiddo."
"Spagetti."
Bucky sighed, sitting down in front of the blonde. Half of his long, brunette hair was tied back into a bun to keep it from his eyes.
That day was just about three months ago. Since then, Tony has been sleeping in his lab (hell, he's even moved a couch in there) and has been refusing to even come close to their shared room.
"You never let me speak, Tony!"
"It was just a prick, kid."
Clint fell the the ground, face first, groaning in defeat. MJ and Ned were in absolute hysterics while Peter just patted his back.
Shuri busted out laughing. "I like him- c’mon let’s get to work on your arm, Peter."
Peter held onto him so hard, Tony could feel his nails digging into his shoulder blades. He stroked his hair gently, shushing him lovingly.
"'M helpin'!" Nate grinned, his two front teeth missing from his childish smile. Lila shook her head.
"Shush, Peter. Clint's been trying to get out of sparring with me anyways." Natasha winked.
"Code Bucky Barnes?" Steve breathed. "What the hell is that?"
3) I need surgery for my knee and I'm almost constantly in pain so it's hard to focus enough to write
"Aw, angry Peter is so cute," Cooper teased, pinching his cheek. Peter huffed.
"Yes I am! You said it yourself, Rogers, I'm gonna be a failure of a dad just like my own father."
"Peter, what's wrong-"
continuously insulted him.
cooper is a mess
"Oh, Pete," Tony sighed. He opened up his arms, Peter falling into his arms.
...and she thought Peter being Spiderman would be the biggest surprise today.
"Well, I'm sorry, but this decision is wrong."
"Tony Stark, to the stage. Stark to the stage."
Peter hiccuped again. "N-N-Nightmare."
"Hey, hey, it's fine. Do ya need me to get Natasha?"
"Hey, Miss Hailey! I'm here for that kid in my grade that I'm showing around."
"Stevie, you gotta eat soon."
"You got it."
The guy next to her chuckled. "I mean, with how much he slutted himself out, I'm not surprised."
Ever since his break up with Steve, he's been having more frequent panic attacks. The stupid protocol had Bruce come find him when ever he's having one. And Tony can't over ride the dumb protocol. All of this together forced Bruce to be Tony's personal, free therapist.
"I just hope it didn't hit anyone." Peter grinned as Bucky laughed again.
"I love you, Dad. And I promise to kick Steve Rogers' ass one day."
"Kid, you are ruining my reputation."
"Peter, even if you punched me in the face and called me a selfish bastard, I'd still want you in my life. You're my son and I'm so incredibly proud of that fact."
Jesus Christ, it was Bucky. Bucky was nice. Bucky was pretty. His hair looked soft but also greasy. He looked like a mess in front of Bucky. Dammit.
"No."
Clint pushed himself up and stormed up. Bucky and Nat exchanged looks.
Yet, as he sits on the couch, thoughts ran through his mind. Maybe Peter, for some deranged reason,
Peter, in short, was terrified that the guy who has pointed an arrow at his head fell from the fucking sky.
"Night, Steve."
He could basically feel the awkward tension in the room and huffed. "Fuck me... wait, where's Aunt May?"
Tony looked at the pizza then back up at Steve. "You're... mad at me."
"Well, I don't need to ask my
you should be good. You're Captain America for God's sake."
As much as Tony hated taking orders or doing things in an organized fashion, he learned that during his panic attacks, having his breathing to focus on helped. After about ten minutes of breathing with Bruce, he placed his head in his hands as he finally started to calm down.
"One..."
Cooper collapsed into his dad's chest, crying softly.
"Hey, Nat, ready to get your ass whooped?" Clint whooped as he slammed the gym door open, scaring the crap out of Peter. "Oh, hey, kid!"
Clint stood up and ruffled his hair, smiling softly. "I'll go get everyone in the living room."
"It's okay, Dad. I still had fun!"
Tony rubbed his eyes as he walked to the doorway, growling, "I only got two hours of sleep last night, whatever this is oughtta be good."
"And Peter's probably up there about to throw up 'cause his own dad doesn't accept him."
"You wouldn't dare!"
Steve's eyes were filled with tears. "I'm here, son. So is Tony. You're gonna be okay."
"Pete, you've been sleeping for two weeks."
The first one was
"Clint. I have a son."
Cooper opened and closed his mouth a few times, quickly pulling back his arm. Apparently he found words to say, whether they were the right ones or not, he said, "I haven't seen my dad since I was twelve. Him and my mom went through a nasty divorce after the stuff that went down in Sokovia. And she's trying to marry a new guy and she wants me to call him dad."
"I'm just thinking about my dad..."
Clint was tapping the mug of coffee Bucky gave him quickly. "Do you possibly know any good child custody lawyers?"
"What did I do?"
Tony pressed a kiss to his forehead and walked out the door. Peter glanced over at his Spidey suit sitting on his bedside. He reached out his arm to grab it, but it was on his right and his arm couldn't quite reach it, bringing more tears of frustration coming to his eyes. He huffed, shoving his back into the bed. He checked his right shoulder, seeing only a short stump keeping his hospital gown shoulder. He took a shaky breath in, eyes slipping shut.
Tony's breath hitched in his throat. He's never heard anyone sound so god damn sincere. "Fine. Come down to my lab with me and we'll take a quick DNA test, alright?"
(See the end of the chapter for
A year into college, Cooper gathered up his courage and asked Tony for his blessing with Peter. At first, he joked around and faked saying no, but told the boy no matter what he thought, it’s Peter’s life and decision. Three months later, Cooper knelt in front of him and popped the question.
"Okay, well, dinner's ready, so get ready, Coop!" Lila said, grinning as she left. "Put some clothes on, you two!"
Peter shifted foot to foot, the idea of saying 'I think your mom is homophobic and this is a bad idea' left a sour taste in Peter's mouth. "Y-Yeah. I-I'm just worried."
He swallowed harder as he walked up to E-12. He lifted his hand and knocked on the dusty door. A tall man with a bun and a metal arm opened the door. "Oh, hi, Stark. Whatcha doin' here?"
Bucky nodded and squeezed his hand tightly as they pulled up to the courthouse. Clint spotted Lila sitting on the bench in front. Clint stepped out of the car and rushed to hug her. "Hey, kid."
"Hey, we'll be fine, Petey," Cooper smiled, holding Peter's face gently in his hand. "Now, how about we just go relax? Watch YouYube? Maybe some Netflix? Or Kitchen Nightmares on Hulu?"
"Alert going out in three..."
"You don't have to-"
boyfriend adding on some stress. Do you know how hard he's working for his kid right now?"
Steve's eyes lifted towards Bucky's. "Ham and cheese?"
Tony squeezed his shoulder again. "You're gonna do great, Petey! I love you!"
"Yeah, no shit, Fri!"
"If that's fine, ma'am."
He let his head fall into his hands, refusing to let himself cry. Steve tore down too many of emotional roadblocks. He refused to hurt Peter anymore by being to god damn emotional. As he sat in the cold, empty living room, he started building up every single wall back up because Stark men are made of iron. Stark men don't cry.
Peter ducked into the classroom, sitting behind Ned and whispering very quietly, "I am so so so gay."
Bucky gave him the 'Are you okay?' look while Sam gave him the 'I swear to the Lord above' look.
"I do accept him!"
She lowered her voice significantly. "About Spider-Man."
Of course, when he found out his dad is Tony Stark, he was paranoid. He didn't think it would ever work. Peter's the son of billionaire playboy genius Tony Stark and has an intellect and wit to rival his father's and beauty that could outshine the sun and Cooper is... Cooper. A guy with bad grades with a dad he hasn't seen in four years who isn't out to anyone except the three people on the couch with at most,
"Hey, hey, shhh..."
"Hey, Fri, where's Clint?"
"Oh, hi, Peter, I've heard all about you!"
"You okay, Peter?"
"Not hungry, Buck."
She's thrown some punches, but none of them hurt this badly. What's going on with him?
The judge called for a thirty minute recess. Those thirty minutes were the most excruciating minutes of his life. Bucky tried his best to keep him calm, but... it was extremely difficult.
"I'll file you a custody claim while you're eating. Remember, Barton, we're here for you."
Please hurry.
"Tony looked me straight in the eye and told me, if you weren't dating Rhodey, and if I wasn't your best friend, he would have kicked me out of the tower a long time ago."
"I'm pan. I'm attracted to all genders."
Only ten minutes later, Sam walked into Steve's room to see the taller man shoving his clothes hastily into a duffle bag.
When he heard Peter was kidnapped he expected a warehouse in the middle of nowhere, not a suburb in a town outside of Queens.
"Thank you..." Peter whispered.
Cooper chuckled and threw his arm around Peter. "You know you love me."
"Feeling any better?"
Cooper had Peter's hand in his tight grip. Peter whimpered slightly, snapping Cooper out of his anger filled daze.
Lila dragged her brother away.
Peter's eyes slipped shut.
So, when Peter went out to walk his friends home, Nat took the chance to take a look.
"I love you too, Petey."
Tony rested his head on his son's. "I love you too, kiddo. So, Parker-Stark or Stark-Parker?"
"Y-You're Captain America!" he whispered excitedly.
"Shut up. You did nothing wrong."
Peter grabbed a piece of graph paper and started sketching.
"Yes, my dear?"
"Agreed."
Tony chuckled, ruffling his hair as Peter sat down in a chair. "Okay, ladies. Get him all prettied up."
"Go away, Steve!" Tony screamed, shoving the soldier away. The blonde stayed put, feet glued to the ground.
Peter nervously cracked his knuckles while he waited for his queue. He paced back and forth awkwardly. The Tony on TV was smiling, casually chatting with the show host.
"Really? How could you tell?"
Steve scoffed. "No, that can't be it... it's so nice and vintage and-"
"Hey, Mr. Tony."
Tony was about to argue back when Clint knocked at the doorframe.
Ned began packing up his backpack.
Natasha entered the room, water bottle in her hand and her other arm outstretched with coffee. "I was going to tell you Tony's son was moving in, but I didn't think you'd believe me."
"Wh-What? No!"
"Oh, Petey. You thought you could out smart me," Mandy whispered, stroking his cheek softly. "If I can't have you, no one can."
As soon as Peter and Cooper were safely in his room, Cooper grabbed Peter's hand. "Are you okay?"
"What?! N-No! You and Mr. Hawkeye training is way more important than stupid ol' me! You could be called on a mission at anytime!" Peter stuttered out, clearly panicked, while unwrapping his hands quickly.
"Hey, guys, how do I look?" Peter turned around the camera, showing off his outfit in the mirror.
He was left alone hours ago.
LISTEN.... @whatsanaccounttoagod IS AN ANGEL FOR HELPING ME FIGURE OUT WTF WAS WRONG.... BLESS
Peter sent one more glare at Steve before storming off again. Tony's shoulders collapsed inward. "I have to go deal with this, talk later?"
"How you doin', princess?" Flash Thompson mocked, smirking like he was the smartest asshole in the world. Peter ignore him, still walking down the hall. "C'mon, Penis, don't ignore me!"
"So much, it's hard to explain."
"Yes, Steve and I have decided to be in a relationship again."
"If? You mean when, Peter," Nat laughed, leaning against the wall. "Clint's decent at fighting, but he's no match to yours truly."
MJ let out a long sigh and Ned just started laughing.
He struggled opening his phone with his shaky hands before starting a group Face Call (thank you, StarkPhones). Ned picked up, already working at his computer, MJ picked up mid-workout, and Cooper's camera was about three inches from his face while he was searching for his glasses, contacts too hard to put in at the moment.
Steve pried Peter from Cooper's arm, trying to be as careful as possible. Peter opened his eyes slightly, "Pops? Is Coop okay?"
The emails just... pulled him in. His recent ones were almost all from his one other friend, Bucky Barnes, only with a few from an email address named
"I can't! I have to make a good impression on Tony and his son."
"Nothin' much, Coopston," MJ grinned, pulling out of the parking lot. "You ready to see your love, Peter Parker?"
"Uh... sure."
Like tonight.
steve is falling apart and peter tries to be the best hero he can while getting away from his troubles.
Peter smirked. "Ooh, I like your accent where you from?"
"Thanks, Pops." Peter fell back asleep, drooling on his chest. Steve smiled at the teen.
Peter shifted on his feet. "I will, I swear."
That's how she ended up above Tony, in the vents, slipping through the metal paths. She was quite familiar with these ways because of her and Clint's prank wars (talking about Clint, she already ran into him twice). She slipped over the vent cover, carefully unscrewing the vent and landing gracefully on the carpeted floor.
"It's the truth."
"Oooh, who you getting all pretty for, Coop?"
"I have come to my decision. The parents will have shared custody over Nathaniel Barton and Clint Barton will have 100% custody over Lila and Cooper Barton."
Clint chuckled. "I'm not sure you could rip these two from me at the moment in all honesty."
"Clint. Breathe."
"Shh, shh, no one will hate you, bud. Come on, let's go get some fresh air. Can you walk, bud?"
His high voice shook as he quietly asked, "Uh- is Tony Stark here?"
"I-I don't know-"
Tony couldn't sleep that night, though. He's been having trouble sleeping ever since Steve cheated on him. Tony shifted on the couch, pulling the blanket tighter over him. He rubbed his eyes roughly, pushing himself back up. He dragged the blanket behind him, keeping the sheet around his shoulders. He opened the glass door of his lab to see Steve curled up in two blankets. The man huffed.
"Yeah. He's quote-unquote 'Processing.' And also being a dick."
"Go to hell!"
"Dad-" Peter covered his face with his hands.
what the fuck, tony
"December 2002, I'm guessing? You met my mom, Mary Parker, at a Christmas party you threw. Y-You told her she was the most beautiful girl in the world. You took her to your bed and threw her out the next morning. Nine months later she had me. She never told you about me because she though you wouldn't have cared." Peter paused to take a breath in. He then realized the tears rolling down his cheeks. "The o-only reason I'm here is because you're all I have left. I-I have no one else other than my two friends. If you want me to leave, I understand, sir. B-But I have all the information to prove you're my father."
"Cooper, listen-"
"So... you're the Spider-kid, huh?"
"What?!" Steve's face lit up. "W-Was he in there?"
"Shhh. Shush. There is literally no rational explanations to why you walked out on Peter after he told you what was probably his biggest secret! He's your god damn son, Tony. You're who he needs the most at the moment. He needs to know you accept him, Tony."
Peter flopped onto the white couch, kicking up his feet on the coffee table. "I could get used to this."
Cooper is kissing Peter.
The word
"Oh, is that a lesbian flag?" Cooper asked, pointing at her jacket.
"No, not me. She genuinely has the greatest technology for the arm."
"Hi, it's nice to meet you all. I'm Steve and this is Tony. I-" Steve glanced at Tony.
"Mister Barton, Mister Barnes wanted to make sure you get dressed in time for your case."
"I'm not here to talk to you, terminator."
"I’m sorry."
Peter took a sip.
Peter shifted from one foot to the other. "D-Do you want me to leave?"
"You were not!"
Cooper is going to pass out.
Peter swallowed. MJ was never a fan of his dad, since she believes he simply left him as a baby. The story that his dad was simply never told about Peter sounded incredulous. "M-My dad, actually."
Ned finally spoke up. "Peter, you live with the Avengers?!"
"What?"
"P-Puh-Puh-!"
Peter weaved through the halls, somehow avoiding any phrases including slurs.
Peter mumbled, "Because I told you the truth."
"Dad!"
Peter huffed. "Fine. But you're explaining what's happening!"
"What-what did you do? You fucking-" Cooper let go of Peter's hand and stormed out.
"No. Since he'd cry if he wasn't watching Bruce Banner's lectures on TV, my dad made him one. He was two when this happened." Peter tried to ignore how his voice wavered at the word 'dad.'
"C'mon, handsome, just a peek."
"No you can't! I'm gay and I've always been gay!"
"Oh, Clint, is this your... friend?"
"You stayin' for dinner?"
"Yea!" The boy ran off, leaving the door wide open. "Mommy! Captain America is at our door."
Steve's head popped up. "Tones?"
"Steven Grant Rodgers. Get your ass to your room."
The boy crawled into his car, waving over his friends who thankfully looked both ways before they crossed the road, both extremely shocked at the sight of Tony Stark in sunglasses and a cap. Tony just smirked and climbed into the car.
"What happened to cause this one?" Bruce asked softly. "Was it Steve again?"
"Peter. He's a real sweet kid. Loves his dad."
Actually, yes he could. Nathaniel being with him would also be amazing right now, but he was beyond lucky to have two of his children. And the extra child clinging to Cooper.
"They make those?" Ned asked excitedly. "Asking for a friend."
'Yes.'
"Hey, Petey, do you want to hear a really embarrassing story 'bout your old man?"
Peter clicked on the TV and tossed a controller to Ned. "Sorry, guys. I'm going to destroy you both. You too, Ned."
"Stark!" Clint snapped, stomping after Tony. Tony ignored him and kept walking down to the lab. "Stark! Hold the hell up!"
"Oh, that's exactly like you, you fucking whore!"
Tony opened the door to reveal a man and a teen. "Pete, this is King T’Challa and Princess Shuri of Wakanda."
Peter undressed and slipped into the shower, avoiding looking down. He tried to wash himself quickly, seeing as running water helps him think and thinking for Peter isn't exactly the best thing. When he thinks the... bad thoughts come to play.
, Peter thought, trying to snap himself out of a daze. He dried off as quickly as he could, wrestled with his binder to pull it over his damp chest, and took a few deep breaths, making sure it wasn't hurting him again. He smiled since he would be fine. The magic of showers. And, ya know, being bit by a radioactive spider. He tugged on his clothes from the day before.
Clint was so fucking angry. That bitch he called an ex wife and the lies she fed their kids. His kids.
Peter sat down, swallowing hard.
Peter's heart stopped. "Oh... oh my god."
"You okay, kiddo?"
"Not pertinent to the story, Natasha." The blonde threw a playful glare at the redhead. "Anyways, so, Tony got super drunk, like drunker than I've ever seen anyone. He was giggling, and Thor accidentally turned on Beyoncé, and Tony thought it would be a great ideo to give a lapdance to Nat."
"A douchebag that left you at birth and is for some god forsaken reason taking care of you, which there is no doubt-"
"He's so head over heels for you! If you don't ask him out tonight, I'm gonna lock you two losers in a closet," MJ said.
Clint had to pause again to prevent from crying.
"My name is Peter Parker, I am fifteen, I attend Midtown High School, I live in Queens, I was born on August 25, 2003, and my best friends' names are MJ and Ned!" he squeaked out, all in one breath. The blonde held back a laugh.
"I-" Tony swallowed again, looking completely away from him. "You- You didn't mean to cheat on me did you?"
"Tony, you don't need to do this-"
"Yeah," Tony let out a strangled laugh. "I need to go talk to him."
That's why he can't breathe.
"I love you, Pete." Tony kissed his head.
There was a drumroll.
"And if that's so, that will be my fault."
Steve Rogers leaned his head against the cold window of the Brooklyn apartment. The soft blanket Bucky gave him was draped around his broad shoulders. Annoyingly, the weather was matching Steve's terrible mood. Rainy, muggy, and all around terrible. A cup of untouched coffee sat a few feet in front of the blonde man. An old record was playing softly from the corner of the apartment and a few books were set near the bench Steve was sat on. Bucky was trying his best to help Steve through his current low point, but many of his attempts just reminded Steve of something else about Tony. Sam promised to stop by later that week, probably going to just make Steve even sadder by accident. Or on purpose.
"Going to do homework?"
"I mean, yeah. She just kicked her son out of her house," Clint paused as he watched Cooper and Lila chat with Peter, "I'm worried if any of my other kids turn out gay or trans or-"
"Answer the question and I'll consider."
"Uh, what?"
"Night, Clint. See you in the morning."
"Oh, hey, Cap. Whatcha need?"
"No it isn’t. You wanted those kids more than your wife ever did or will."
Tony was desperately trying to get Peter to crack a smile. He's been through to much for being just a kid, not to mention how short of a time it happened. Peter smiled softly. "Are you sure they'd be fine with that?"
Most recently, Bucky Barnes has taken the teen under his wing, trying to teach the younger boy how to get used to a prosthetic designed by the one and only Shuri. No matter how many times the two have denied it, Peter and Bucky have caught Clint and Cooper watching their joint physical therapy many of times.
"Yeah. Then she took custody of the kids, saying he wasn't fit because his job as an agent-slash-avenger was too 'dangerous.'"
"No! He was rude to you! He said you'd ruin my life! Just 'cause
The other two kids sat in the backseat, the boy saying in total shock, "You're Tony Stark."
He'll be back by morning.
"Peter. This is my decision. And that's that. Now, you shouldn't yell at your father or anyone older than you. That's plain disrespectful. Now say that you're sorry."
"So, he went missing at night, so he was probably patrolling. I need to search for Karen."
"Cap's an asshole sometimes, Pete."
"Uh, yeah."
"Hot coco."
They are kissing.
"Hey, children, Tony wants to know if you want pizza- why is Clint on the floor again?"
"Boo. Y'all would be cute as fuck," Cooper shrugged.
He took glance at his sleeping boyfriend, blanket curled around his shoulders. The blonde kissed his forehead gently before retreating to go train. He didn't want his beautiful Tony to be angrier than he already was. As he walked towards the kitchen, there was a quiet knock on the door.
"Oh, God, these are always funny. So, Peter, since when were you an alcoholic?"
Tony smiled. "You go get Clint. I'll distract the teens. Then I'll e all dad like and say, 'Cooper, I need to have a chat with you' and bring him into the kitchen."
"Alrigh'," Clint slurred. "Just checkin' on ya'."
Peter gasped. "You have a little sister?"
"Michelle! You don't know that!" Peter huffed angrily.
Ever since Steve cheated on him, he'd buried himself in so many layers of emotional unavailability, he wasn't sure he could dig himself back out for the... how old was he? 14? 15? 17? This is why Tony doesn't deserve a son. If anything, Steve should have been the one with the child, maybe even Sam or Rhodey or Bruce. But Tony? He didn't deserve anything in his current state or life. His breathing started to become erratic. "Fuck."
"Yup!"
where Peter did a backflip into a summersault before fake punching some bad guys, which somehow came across as Natasha. The audience cheered.
"I got you the best person I could think of to make your new arm."
"Peter, that's what the police are for."
After a few minutes, Ned finally relaxed. Eventually, Clint ended up joining them for a few episodes of Buzzfeed Unsolved, a full pot of coffee in his hands.
"You named your kid
"Get me Hawaiian," Clint groaned from the floor, making Ned throw a throw pillow at him. Clint yelled loudly, but still didn't get up. Rhodey sighed loudly and left to tell Tony the orders.
"Hey, Pete, can you tell me five things you can see?"
"Why?"
"Therapy session," Bucky said, making Natasha slap him across the back of his head.
"Yeah, I know. I wouldn't dream about asking him about kids or family anytime soon."
Steve walked into the gym. He looked surprised when he saw Bucky, Nat, and Clint all sitting in a circle.
"Three. I'm getting my su-"
"MJ!" Ned snapped, noticing Peter become uncomfortable.
She nodded softly, curling back into him. "Good. I missed you."
Peter woke up early the next day, despite his devastating lack of sleep. Clint stayed with the boy for two hours, calming him down after his and Tony's fight. Then he couldn't sleep for two more hours. Then he woke up at seven am, unable to fall asleep again, which lead him to thinking, which lead him to absolutely hating himself and wanting to die. Both of those feelings he usually worked out on patrol, but he didn't want to sneak out since Tony was already mad at him.
"Tony. Let's talk about this."
Peter groaned loudly. This was
"Mr. Stark has told me to tell you to meet him in his workshop."
"Steve, one, I already made food, two, if you don't eat soon, you're going to feel like utter shit."
"No- no. I can do this."
"Come in, Peter."
" Tony yelled.
Tony opened and closed his mouth like a fish before promptly standing up and leaving the room. Clint's cheeks puffed out. "I'll go talk to him, Peter."
Steve shifted uncomfortably, all the homophobic and biphobic comments hes heard in the 40's an modern day alive slid in and out of his head. "Really?"
"Steve. Stop talking," Tony mumbled. Steve immediately closed his mouth (Tony's expressed his worries about what would have happened to Peter if he was hurt in action). "I think the best plan is to trap Cooper in a room with Clint one day when Peter brings him over so he can explain."
"Oh, no! Not at all! First of all, this guy right here is a giant softie." Peter grinned at his dad, who's face was flushed red.
"No, the handsomeness comes from your old man."
Steve watched Tony leave. "Hey, F.R.I.D.A.Y.? Tell Clint to get to the kitchen."
The two boys entered the elevator. Cooper gently grabbed his hand.
"Oh, I'm pansexual! It's just cool to already meet some LGBT people here."
Steve could practically see the gears grinding in Sam's head. Sometimes, Steve wished his friends were a little worse at being friends.
The blonde soldier grabbed the pillow and two blankets shoved in the closet near the lab. He threw down the thicker blanket on the floor before setting his pillow down and curling up under the other blanket.
Steve sighed gently. "I wanna make sure Tony's okay."
"Peter Parker-Stark to the stage!"
"You're getting snot all over my sweatshirt, little man."
"I'm gonna tell her you said that."
"I kinda found that out." Peter crossed his arms, frowning.
MJ was basically fuming. "Your dad is Tony fucking Stark?"
MJ whistled. "Got a hot date or something, Parker?"
Peter shot up.
Peter was gripping onto Clint's shirt like his like depended on it. "No it's not- everyone's gonna know, everyone's gonna know, Clint!"
"Okay."
"Cooper? Lila?"
"Heck!"
"Yeah, yeah, Stark has a kid, I'm I going to beat you guys at Jenga again or what?" Clint snorted, leaning forward.
MJ huffed. "Fine. I'll drop it. I just don't want you to get hurt, Peter."
God, Cooper is
"So you didn't tell your pals I'm your dad, Pete?"
"Yes, you idiot!" Peter shoved his shoulder, still laughing.
...right?
"The police? Do you know how discriminatory they are? Even if they weren't, they're always too busy with bigger things! No one would be looking out for the little guy! But I am."
Tony sighed. "Fine. I'll drop it for now. For you, kid. Also, you have nothing to apologize for."
Peter didn't trust his voice not to crack in fifty different ways, so he just nodded, his smile wide. Wow, he's gay. He's so gay.
"Stop staring, Michelle, it’s considered rude," Cooper teased, walking over to Peter.
"He also makes me hot cocoa whenever I want. And he lets my friends come over! To one of the most secure facilities! No matter what people say, he's full of all those emotions."
"Oh, hey, Pete, that's you."
Peter squeaked loudly, turning his head to face an arrowhead in the middle of his forehead. "Oh my god, please don't kill me!"
"Coop, Lila, go to your rooms. The adults need to talk," Clint mumbled to his kids.
Peter's eyelids were glued shut. Well, at least it felt like it. He felt a hand softly stroke his cheek. He slowly leaned his head into his touch. He slowly tried to pry his eyes open. Tony smiled softly.
He drank the rest anyway.
"Get off your high and mighty horse, Barton."
"Haha, smartass. I was saying we need to introduce you to the public so the outlets don't think the Avengers are having a relationship with an underage kid. So, how about we go on a talk show, get an interview, and maybe play a game with the host."
Peter looked up at him, eyes shining and...
Peter basically pulled his friends up the stairs, and flopped onto the giant couch, turning on the TV. MJ basically fell onto the couch next to him, but Ned just sat casually.
"Never bring my son into an argument again, Rogers," Tony whispered, despite his tone being lethal. "And get the fuck out of my house."
He wiped his hands and mouth with a napkin before tossing his plate. "Hey, Pete. I have to go do something, but I should be back before you have to get to bed, alright?"
Peter was so terrified of even more competitiveness, that he sat Twister out. Tony got out quickly and sat next to his son.
"What the fuck? You haven't came out to the Avengers yet?" Ned asked, looking away from his program.
Mandy hasn't been down in a while, Peter realizes. He's beginning to think a little clearer. He taps the back of his web slingers three time, automatically rebooting Karen.
"Should've known it was him."
Steve turned to face his smaller friend, tears spilling down his face. "Moving out."
Then the next morning Steve tried to give him some bullshit story that made Tony even angrier.
"I know."
"Okay, just remember what I told you, Barnes."
Steve wiped his eyes quickly, laughing softly at the name. "I'm fine. Why are you here?"
"I-It's okay, Mr. Barton!" Would it be a good time to ask him to wear clothes while he sleeps? Before Peter said anything to embarrass himself, Clint locked himself in the bathroom.
"Holy shit, I knew it!" She whispered, getting Cooper's nervous attention. "I knew you were gay!"
"God, this sounds so stupid.... but, uh- Would you maybe like to go on a date sometime?"
"What, Peter?!"
"Sir, you appear to be having a panic attack," F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s voice echoed through the lab.
"Are you sure? He's only a bit shorter than me, brown hair and eyes, a bit scrawny-"
"What do you care? You weren't there for most of my life!" Peter suddenly snapped back, despite cowering still.
"He's in his lab, sir."
Dammit.
"I got 'im this time, Nat."
He didn't realize the edge of the concrete roof split under his finger tips from his anger. He huffed angrily as he pushed himself off of the roof and shot another web out. The sun was down, the crime started coming out, and Peter had a job to do.
Because it's a lot.
Peter snapped out of his daze, immediately glaring at MJ. "What the hell, MJ?"
Tony smoothed out Peter's red button up. "I might not be able to let you out there, Pete. You'd be killin' all the ladies and fellas with your looks."
"Clint! Thank God you're here. I needed to talk to you before the case."
"I don't give a shit, Steve! Don't you dare talk to Peter since I know you'll find a way to hurt that poor kid."
Tony let himself out of his own lab, Steve lingering in there. It's okay, though. Tony trusts him. He slowly climbed the stairs until he hit Peter's door. He knocked gently. "Peter?"
"How was I supposed to know?"
"Wait! Cooper, wait up!" They turned to see Lila running down the hall after them, a backpack slung over her shoulder. "I'm coming with."
Slowly, everyone congregated in the kitchen, and despite Bucky's efforts, ate the cookies. Tony even grabbed a few, claiming they were for Peter.
Clint curled up into Bucky's chest and tried to go to sleep. He really did, but he just kept thrashing until the sun rose on the city's horizon. Clint forced himself out of bed long after Bucky pulled himself into consciousness.
Who was that? It hurts. His mind hurts.
"Yeah," he mumbled, half focused on the TV show.
"Oh, I would!" Bucky laughed.
Peter kicked her shin under the lunch table, making her yelp and punch him.
"Well, if that was your goal, you succeeded," Tony said, trying to laugh, but getting choked up. Oh, God, he was trying to lighten the mood. Steve gripped his hand harder.
Peter's brain felt like mush.
"Dad! I'm home!"
Steve cowered back from Mama Wilson.
Bruce mumbled to him, "No, Thor, boys can't get pregnant."
"Hi! I'm Peter Parker-Stark!"
Peter wiggled his way out of Clint's grasp when he heard the yelling stop and the crying start, despite Clint's protests. Peter was still panicking slightly, but his dad needed comforting more at the time than Peter did. The boy stopped at the doorframe.
"Yes you are! He once gave me four hundred dollars 'cause I asked for lunch money!"
No it won’t.
Clint led his two kids into the kitchen where Bucky and Steve were cooking pancakes. Bucky looked over his shoulder and smiled. "Morning, you three."
Steve's sketch book laid in his lap, page opened to Steve's unfinished Tony drawings. He kept starting new little doodles as new memories came to mind. There was drawings of Tony smiling, Tony laughing, Tony focused, Tony angry, pretty much every single emotion Steve has ever seen out of the other man. A few different drawings of the more negative emotions were smeared with his tears as he remembered the worse memories. He wanted to press his face into Tony's brunette hair as they swayed clumsily to Elvis. Tony would chuckle as he stepped on his feet while apologizing, making up for the minor pain with a peck to the lips.
And they wouldn’t argue about it. Father and son, side by side.
"Thank you." Tony jogged off.
Peter smiled gently. "Maybe you aren't so bad after all, Captain."
Peter gets spooked, Tony tries his best, and Steve needs a hug
Steve's eyes started filling with tears. He turned, but continued to yell at Tony anyways. "I knew we were a bad idea. You're just too much of a conceited asshole to work with anyone!"
"You're Iron Man's son," she squealed happily. "Wow. You sure have that Stark handsomeness."
"Okay, Fri. I'll be there in a second! Thanks guys, I gotta go!"
"Uh- y-you, my shirt, the railing, the ground."
"If it's Sam, tell him to go away. I don't feel like dealing with all that guilt."
Peter smiled and held his hand. "It's fine. Today must have sucked."
Ok y'all I know I haven't updated in seven years but I do have reasons
Peter beamed. "Yes! Thank you!"
Peter felt dead on his feet the next day. After he yelled at Tony, he couldn't sleep. He refused to eat until Clint forced him to. And Clint didn't even do it, he had to get Natasha to do it! And Peter is scared of Nat!
"Clint."
Tony's lips pressed into a thin line with worry. "It's okay, Peter. Just- try not to scare me again, alright?"
the barton boys bicker
A third guy said, "Is Stark even qualified to raise a kid?"
"I was going to train some with Clint, but how about we just hang out some?"
"Jokes on you! I'm ALREADY in the closet!"
"Hey, Ned. We need to talk."
"Oh! It's the AI me and Peter created for his suit. Peter named her."
"I know, I know, just- can you show me how to get out?"
Cooper smiled softly and hugged him. "Thank you, Pete."
"Put down my daughter, you queer," Laura hissed. When Lila was set on the ground, the woman tugged her back towards herself. "I don't need my daughter to be a dyke."
Peter Parker was
"I'm not thirteen!" Peter snapped, turning to see
Peter shuffled back to his room, ruffling his hair with the towel. He bumped open the room. He nudged Tony which made the older man scream. Tony clutched his chest, scared that he might have a heart attack despite the arc reactor planted firmly in his chest.
“Jarvis,” it’s louder this time leaving Steve to wonder just how many steps Tony took at a time. Or whether or not he truly needs his caffeine fix first thing in the morning as desperately as he says he does. Either way, Steve thinks it’s adorable.
Walking from stall to stall is one thing, but keeping idle proves to be even worse. It’s like fighting a current, swarms of eager bargain shoppers hurriedly passing left and right. None of who seem to understand the concept of personal space. The hotdog stand a few feet away holds way more importance than a little human decency. As do the charm bracelets and mood rings a few stands ahead.
“It’s not just Natasha Romanov,” Hogan begins, “it’s everyone. The tabloids, the seven o’clock news, the papers.”
“England,” Tony beams. “Had to sign some
Because Tony has far too much confusion to sort through; an act that will be impossible while the object of said confusion is around.
And so, Steve is still seething when a sealed compact disk and an intimidatingly large book are placed on his desk exactly ten minutes before he’s about to pack up and head out for I hate Mondays drinks with the boys.
Tony goes to the kitchen, not the least bit surprised to see Ms. Wanda already bustling with vegetables over a chopping board. Only, as she chops, she seems to be doing it with a little more effort than necessary. The loud knocks of steel against wood give away her annoyance.
The door swings open.
Steve hardly takes note of Ms. Wanda staring at the television from the safety of the kitchen doorway, looking only slightly as pale as he feels.
Steve chuckles for a second, watching Tony walk back into the hotel before following him in on a heavy exhale.
“He left… a while ago,” Stan says, somewhat metallically. “Tony, the production has been postponed.”
Tony shoves his baseball cap down over his flaring dark locks. His hoodie follows.
mug makes Steven certain it had been long since thought-out.
“By dropping the needle,” Tony answers his own earlier question that Steve had forgotten he’d asked and it really makes no sense to him and Stark presses a button and music fills the hotel room.
“So?” Tony sighs, wanting Steve to continue. Continue speaking, continue running his hands over the subtle muscle in his outstretched arms, he doesn’t care. Just as long as Steve doesn’t stop.
One unknowing turn around a bend brought them head-on with a driver who’d misconstrued right for left in his drunken stupor and Steve’s father’s reflexes hadn’t been quick enough to save them both. A DUI caused Steve to lose his mother and for Steve’s father to lose the use of his legs.
There’s a certain feeling one gets when they know they’ve just stepped into a potentially disastrous situation. It’s an instinct, something most human beings are born with.
Hogan finds himself trying to restrain from grabbing the manuscript and ripping it to shreds.
“It’s only a talk show,” Tony chuckles at Pepper’s honesty, “how could I screw up?”
Stan can tell that Tony is completely smitten.
One, because he’s been more worried about himself when Ms. Wanda was clearly worried about Steve. And then because the kitchen’s become silent, and Ms. Wanda’s eyes are intently searching his own.
There’s an awkward silence between the two of them, unfamiliar guilt creeping over Brock.
As she speaks, she sits back in the chair and reaches for her glass of the best dry red wine she’s ever tasted. She wants to compliment Hogan on his fine sense of cuisine, but takes into account that he may likely misconstrue it as an insult.
“Maybe I’ll teach you.” Steve smiles sheepishly.
“I dunno,” Tony shrugs, “Jake Gyllenhaal did it.”
And so the rumors aren’t entirely false. Stark really does have a pretty blond thing willing to do anything to help him unwind after a long day’s work.  Steve will be pouring Tony a glass of his favorite scotch as they sit through their Painfully Corny Gay Amateur Porn production. And Steve will certainly be making a quick trip to the bathroom to make sure that when the movie is over, Tony finds no underwear under Steve’s dress pants.
“No wait, Steve,” Tony sighs, following Steve once more. “Wait, don’t just leave.”
“Not really,” he looks at the lady whose face is a mask of concern.
“Maybe I do.”
That is more or less what they have, a relationship. A friendship that turned into something more. An affair. An insanely awesome physical relationship, Steve thinks back to the previous night. The image of Tony panting and losing control is enough to illicit some stirring in his pants. The look that crossed Tony’s face when he came undone, the sweat, the sighs. The way he licked his bottom lip, hard stomach bathed in a coat of his own –
“You’re making the poor boys nervous as shit,” Rhodey says with a frown, entwining his fingers behind his head. “You’re not even supposed to be in here.”
“I was, Tony admits simply.”
“All I ever tried to do was protect him from Howard,” Hogan sighs. “Howard was my closest friend, I knew him all too well. I still do. I had to steer Tony in Howard’s direction to make life easier on the boy. So don’t you dare make it out as if I don’t care about him. I love that kid more than Howard ever could.”
“Goodnight, Tony.”
*****
“Ladies first”, Hogan mumbles, not daring to take a step before Pepper sighs and proceeds.
The audience cheers. Tony smirks. Hogan curses.
EPILOGUE
“Tony, no.”
Pepper sighs, feeling her mood sink as she takes in just how much shit all of them are causing Tony.
*****
“I can teach you,” Steve grins sheepishly.
“Funny thing, actually,” Tony begins, sarcastically, “you know what they also decided to invent after inventing addictive games?”
Being so far away from familiarity is starting to overwhelm him.
“Oh dear,” the lady says, gesturing for Tony to sit down at the kitchen table. “It doesn’t really shock me that much though. Steve has always been like that. Kept a lot to himself. I just assumed he’d told you.”
Tony feels an exciting sort of nervous heat pool in the pit of his stomach.
“Your father is on his way.” Pepper spoke quickly to break the silence.
“And what is she doing now, Steve?”
Steve clings to Tony’s body when Tony suddenly takes control. His hips rocking and gyrating, causing immense friction in all the right places. Only the silkiness of Tony’s boxers and the tight cotton of Steve’s jocks between their bare groins.
The water covers a little more of Tony’s chest than it does Steve’s. It’s just the right temperature, tiles smooth and clean under bare feet.
Hogan’s equally as shocked as Pepper. Maybe even more. But he isn’t making it as clear as Pepper is with her hand over her mouth and her eyes going wide.
“Tony Stark,” Joseph winces slightly as he tries to get a better look.
“He looks great, doesn’t he?” Pepper says quietly, not wanting to disturb the people around them, hard at work.
Tony pulls the covers back and drops himself into Steve’s bed, the boy’s scent instantly invading Tony’s nostrils.
He’s suddenly uncomfortable. A little worried, in fact, by the way the casting agent is suddenly looking at him.
“Steve?” Tony raises a brow, “Steve Rogers?”
“You’re unbelievable,” Brock narrows his eyes. “Here I thought you were mad because the photographs of your client are not going to be all over mags and websites, when really,” Brock shakes his head with a smile, “really, all you wanted was a cut in the bribe.”
“Okay, I get it,” Steve chuckles again, scrolling down the games menu to store his progress. “I totally needed that intervention.”
*****
“Where was I,” Tony continues, “Oh, yeah. The reporters you do wanna talk to are Phil Coulson and Loki . Coulson is easy to spot- balding man, always wearing the same hideous blue suit. And Loki –”
“Uh, Dad, this is-”
There’s a short silence as the stranger digs into Tony’s pocket, the tight denim leaving little room to avoid the type of contact that could be classified as second base to theoreticians. Tony can’t help but smile.
Steve’s eyes flicker, breath catching slightly in his throat. It’s so hard to keep his character going when the intensity of Tony’s acting always throws him off.
Howard Stark shakes his head, walking past both of them, but making sure to bump Hogan deliberately on his way out.
When Stark looks back at Steve its equivalent to a look that one would give a man about to bungee jump with the safety harness attached to his penis.  And Stark’s suddenly invested enough to examine the mental condition that he clearly thinks Steve is suffering from as he perches down on the edge of Steve’s desk, crossing his arms over his chest in his infamous, you-do-realize-this-means-you’re-fired stance.
Especially since Steve’s little brother’s seem to be utterly thrilled by the revelation.
Steve always prides himself on how well his alarm works.
with, means worlds more than what he’s actually doing.
Although, right then, Stan feels like doing the man in and hiding the cadaver, he’s more concerned about what Howard is thinking. Howard Stark, standing motionlessly at the window, his back towards the room. Stiff shoulders and reddened neck, head slightly lowered.
“Oh dear,” Steve looks at the old lady who’s staring at him.
As Steve sits in the boardroom for Stark Industries’ weekly Monday morning power meeting, he is scowling, kicking himself for formulating such a ludicrous plan.
“Yeah,” Tony grins. “And get this, his reason for not telling Zane was because he didn’t want to hold him back. Jake was thoroughly convinced he wasn’t going to make it, and he didn’t want Zane to have to go through the loss. And they have this whole really emotional reunion, I swear, Pepper, the dialogue in this script is amazing. So anyway, Zane refuses to leave Jake no matter what-”
For Tony to find Steve Rogers again.
“So, Tony,” Peggy, the thirty year old, gorgeous, talk show host continues, “you’re undoubtedly the hottest thing since Johnny Depp starred in
“Right,” she returns to the table and takes a seat. Not before placing a fresh slice of American pie in front of Tony. “Where to begin.”
Looking back at Tony, Steve begins to realize how pointless it is fighting with him. Although the short time that they had spent together that day had been enjoyable and Tony has been great company, it isn’t enough to cover the fact that he still is
“Relax, Hogan,” Tony smiles broadly, “I’ve got a handle on this.”
“Hey, are you sure your boy is ready back there,” Tony says as an afterthought, “He looked kinda green just now.”
*****
“Hospital bill?”
“You must really be happy,” the smile looked misplaced on Tony’s face, “you’ve never called me that before.”
Or maybe, Steve thinks, it’s still just all an act. Neil Patrick Harris, the stranger who he just met at the DVD store and is now entering is a bi-curious biker who is only just now, for the first time, giving into his curiosity.
“Oh, God,” Pepper smiles, “I love this song.”
Steve mulls the question over, wondering if the truth would make everything worse. Ms. Wanda freaks out whenever a wave of undesirable emotion crosses Steve’s face. Steve’s father is the only one who does a decent job of hiding pain from her, even though they all know he’s enduring the most of it. All the time.
Steve smiles, holding Tony’s gaze for several seconds before Tony shuts his eyes as if Steve is distracting him.
Maria sees something flash over Tony’s face. A hint of emotion that she’s completely unaccustomed to.
“I promise,” Steve whispers, seconds before their lips touch.
Steve swears he can see the realization of his words sinking in. The silence is killing him, he needs Tony to respond.
As Steve moves beneath him and the duvet twists around their barely clothed bodies, Tony becomes aware of a lot more things. Like the fact that their skin is touching, and he’s between Steve’s parted legs. And he can feel Steve against him. And as soon as that completely dawns on him, it’s as if Steve realizes the same thing. Because both of their laughter abruptly dies away.
“You told him to give up the role.”
“You see that’s what your problem is,” Steve stands, raising his voice considerably. “You think everything is a big joke.”
“It’s a tragedy,” Rhodey adds contemptuously before gesturing to the script in Thor’s hand. “Do you mind reading for us. Scene seven will do. Ms. Hill will run through it with you.”
“You’re my hero, you know that?”
“So tell us, Tony,” Natasha goes on, “did your break-up last year with your co-star, Diana of
“Howard,” Hogan begins, “the thing is-”
“It matters because the world believes it is,” Hogan’s voice rises considerably.
“Please don’t hate him, Tony,” Maria puts space between them enough to see Tony’s face. Tony’s doing everything not to look her in the eye, a shameful pink tint crossing his face as his mother wipes the dampness from his cheeks. “Don’t hate your father. Please forgive him.”
Steve aims for the prostate with every thrust as Tony’s moans transform from shocked pain to complete pleasure. He keeps them long and calculated until the heels of Tony’s feet start to dig painfully into his lower back in a nearly desperate pace. It’s all the confirmation Steve needs to throw caution to the wind and all the derogatory statements he’s ever made about how he wants to fuck the boss up, defrost into a molten, hot need to fuck the boss out.
“You can go ahead and do it for revenge,” Sharon finishes for him, completely changing what he was about to say. “I want Howard Stark to suffer.”
“Because….” Tony says, pausing to exhale when he pushes the weight to arm’s length and hangs it back up.
“Sean,” Steve offers as his thumb brushes over knuckles that have no right to be attractive,” William,” and the he too adds, “Scott.”
She watches Tony’s eyes dart around as if the answers will somehow be there. She notices that his breathing is slightly uneven as if he’s having an inward battle to keep his rage in check.
“It’s alright, man,” Tony smiles, giving Steve’s shoulder a friendly shove. Then as if to keep the next part covert, he throws his arm around Steve’s shoulder and leans in close to his ear. “To tell you the truth, I don’t think much of that show either,” Tony whispers.
Steve’s body protests, limbs tight and aching with those lovely type of battle wounds one signs up for when spending a solid day in bed with a raging nymphomaniac.
“Yeah, I know,” Pepper nods, shivering slightly when Tony reaches up to brush her long blonde strands aside. This gives him better access to the flesh at the back of her neck. “Not many boys your age are household names.”
“We’ll speak when I get home,” Tony says, repositioning himself so that he’s lying flat on his back with his head resting on Steve’s lap and one leg swinging over the arm rest. “I don’t know when, Dad.”
Pepper’s blonde hair falls in waves over his pillow. Her breathing is calm, reflecting nothing of what she’s feeling inside. She lays still as Hogan brushes tired circles over her bare shoulder with his thumb.
“Well,” Steve shrugs, “Mom said he can name me Harley, but then he doesn’t get to keep his.”
It started the second they saw each other again. The second Tony stepped into Lee’s office and his eyes locked with Steve’s. For only a second. And then Steve’s jaw clenched and he looked ahead of himself with stubborn determination. And it drove Tony crazy.
Tony knows he needs to elaborate.
“What?” Steve grins, inspecting himself carefully.
One to get an energy drink and impulse purchase a few Twinkie’s, and then the second to use the bathroom at some remote gas station. He checks the address on Steve’s file one more time.
“A while ago, I would have said yes,” Ms. Wanda nods thoughtfully. “Bucky is real good at pulling Steve apart. But Now, I’d say you have absolutely nothing to worry about. When Steve came home, I could hardly believe it was the same kid. Something’s changed him. He looked a lot stronger, you know. Something tells me he’s a lot stronger now.”
Pepper breaks the kiss. The kiss that had been going on for at least three minutes. The type that makes her lightheaded and besotted and so dazed that she hadn’t even noticed Tony’s t-shirt come off.
Tony looks over at Steve who is running his fingers gently over the controller buttons in the white vehicle.
“As if that’s doable,” Lee scoffs with a grin. “
were supposed to see him,” Tony raises a brow, sitting at the kitchen table.
“Sharon,” Brock grins, backing away with his hands half in the air in subtle defense. “Nice to see you too.”
Joseph looks up, only just realizing he isn’t alone anymore. Irritation quickly vanishes, a pleased look taking over the man’s face as he looks his son over.
“I’ve got more important things to worry about.”
Steve reaches for Tony’s neglected, weeping cock, stroking the pent up pleasure out of him in four hard strokes. And if he thinks that watching Tony releasing his load between them is the hottest thing he’s ever seen, Steve is quickly corrected. Because Tony chooses that exact moment to grab hold of Steve’s jaw and force his head upward.
Four years out of practice and it’s certainly showing.
And that he had allowed himself to fall for it.
Ms. Wanda’s laughter makes his mood lighter once again. He hears it fade away and then hears Ms. Wanda call his father’s name. They exchange a few cheerful words that he can’t quite make out, and then there’s a little bit of a struggle on the other end of the line.
“You have no idea what you’re getting yourself into.”
He happens to pick out the one where his son is accepting a kiss from another boy in a swimming pool. He doesn’t look at it though. Instead, he holds it up inches away from Hogan’s face.
“Hello, Ms. Wanda,” the young man smiles at the old lady, despite her inability to return it in the slightest.
Even after his awkward assessment of the vicinity from the safety of the door that gains him a few odd looks, Steve still isn’t quite sure what the theme of
“May I continue, Rogers?”
As he shakes her hand she takes the time to pay attention to everything. From the firm grip of the shake, to the subtle tan of his hand. The old brown pleather jacket he’s wearing to the black polo shirt beneath it. His square jaw and symmetrical face, the sky blue eyes that ooze warmth. His perfect pink lips. The flawlessly styled hair, the type of gold with too much precision to be natural.
“So, do you have an appointment with Mr. Lee?” Tony asks; entering the office once the door is unlocked for him. He drops the box onto Lee’s desk and takes off his baseball cap as he moves to shake the other boy’s hand.
