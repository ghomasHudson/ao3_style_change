<< Peter advised me to come and talk to him >> she says, pointing to Sherlock. << Peter told me he knows him >>.
In fact, John has never seen Sherlock go beyond the glass of wine during one of the rare meals he allows himself, without ever finishing it completely. Or the half finger of some alcoholic drink, very rarely. Only on the Saturday night of the previous week did John see him swallowing a whole pint of beer, along with the two grappas he was so invited to try. Yes, Sherlock was definitely drunk, not just as tipsy as he could says. He had drunk considerably more.
<< Well, Greg, what can I say? It is the most beautiful declaration of esteem I have ever received >> John says and both explode into a laugh, capable of dissipating the tension and allowing the doctor to catch his breath.
More than words, the tone used by Mycroft affects him. Free of any emotional color. Live in spite of everything. Accept any kind of violence for the sake of survival.
<< Incitement to prostitution, suicide and cyberbullying. And all this for a place on the front line in a place that does not exist in all respects >> John is shocked. << And Lizzy ... in which phase she is? >>.
The drawer contains a bulky and overflowing red folder, that the consultant pulls out with difficulty. He opens it and he, William and Morgan sink their noses into the contents.
<< Do you really believe that the aim of a kidnapping can  be a teacher rather than a businessman, Mr Holmes? >> the chief asks, skeptically.
John invites Lizzy to enter and she makes the soles of the heavy  amphibians resonate by moving just two steps beyond the threshold and then stopping. Finding her father and brother standing there in the center of the room has the effect of immediately snapping her up, like a cat hit by a few drops of water.
Someone knock on the door and both are taken by surprise. John goes to open it and a smiling girl hands him an envelope, telling him it's for Mr. Sigerson. John takes a moment to remember that it is the pseudonym chosen by Sherlock.
<< You know why, Harry >> he says, reaching the bed with a heavy step. John lets himself fall on his stomach on the soft mattress and on the sheets that give him the good and still fresh scent of the fabric softener. This bed seems so immensely empty to him tonight. Given the location of their respective rooms, he knows that no disturbing noise should disturb him. The passing passions are consumed in one night and certainly the same will happen with this. John postpones everything the next day, sure that he can go down to prepare a tea without finding the presence of the intruder anymore. Now, he turns off the spotlight on this long day full of too many emotions.
"If you tell her not to, Mary will ask you why and if she should find out that she has welcomed an ex-junkie into the house, how do you think it will end?".
Sherlock is located immediately next to this corps. It lies on his back, his glazed gaze fixed on the sky and an expression of frozen amazement on his face. This man was hit in the chest by a gunshot. Straight to the heart, with no escape.
"Why do you have to pull it so long, I say?" continues Moriarty, ignoring him. "Did you like it? Did he enjoy you? Well, keep this and throw everything else away. You knew well how an idiot was John, like everyone else. He only confirmed it to you. Do you know what news? Every day people confirm their idiocy. "
"What should I do? Do I say to this stupid woman: 'Yes, we are lovers?' She wouldn't understand me! " he think, though there is nothing  stupid now in this woman, who has come even closer to the photo she observes attentively.
<< Something. I need to clarify a point and you can help me. Is it possible to go directly from the octagonal sauna, the one where the Aufguss takes place, to the male changing rooms? >>.
<< Sharon Milton >> says more to himself than to those present. Trampling on the sheets of paper, Sherlock approaches Greg, John and William, followed by Morgan. << Here is our winner >> he says turning the form towards them.
<< Mary ... >> whispers the consultant, leaving them speechless. The two men exchange another look. Neither of them could have imagined that the first word Sherlock would say once awake would be the name of his jailer.
Contrary to what happens to anyone who is experiencing great physical pain, Sherlock perfectly remembers every single moment of his past abstinence crisis. He tried twice before finally succeeding with his third detox to get rid of addiction to cocaine and all the other things he injected or swallowing to overcome his sense of unhappiness. He doesen't acept to start again and with a sneaky drug like morphine.
John thinks. His patient's coughing, brings him back to reality. John fill in the recipe quickly, feeling the need to send the old man away.
Sherlock risks losing his grip on the razor handle, when the woman sits heavily beside him on the bed. Her huge thigh in contact with his bare side, sends a retch back to his throat.
<< The fact that he is divorcing your mother does not relieve him of his duties as a father. Whatever you are about to tell us, he has a duty to take care of you and you have the right to be protected by him >>.
The heavy footsteps announce that Mary is about to return and Sherlock would like to scream and at the same time to have the power to lock that damned door with the only force of thought.
<< I think he wants to know your name >> Sherlock whispers and the dog barks. The boy's eyes widen in amazement.
<< First of all because it is the only place without cameras and then because the meeting took place there and shocked me to the point of looking for it again. Obviously this is the film that I'm sure Martin is doing >>.
He closes it behind him and stays there, his hand resting on the door knob. He can't think. He can't move. He only feels the slow rhythm of his breathing rumbling in his head. John takes a good number of breaths before he can break away from there and slowly climb the steps. He remains attached to the door handle of his room again.
<< You still gave way to talk about you and throw mud on this family! >> growls, moving threateningly towards him. << I should have killed you then. I made a serious mistake in thinking you were already dead. You have always been stubborn, William. I had to expect that you had a rather hard head >>.
<< Yes, I see it >> whispers, standing there looking at him. << There is something ... different about you tonight >>.
<< Those threats, as well as the tutor who was assigned to them, all arrived from a cell located in the Caribbean, a clear sign of the presence of a hacker who wants to keep hidden from his true position >> continues Fox. << Daisy and Rosaline found themselves mixed in something even bigger in the already big mess they had entered. With their mania for protagonism, they have made known to the Masters who Elisabeth's father was, pushing the Master to exclude her. The goal, however, was to carry her forward >>.
On balance, this is the most intimate moment they experienced after that fateful Saturday evening. So far, if they have been close, it has mostly been for medical reasons. John held Sherlock in his arms to help him sit up or get up before and after the leg operation. He even helped him wash when he had plaster and now he supports him and helps him to perform the rehabilitation exercises. John  encouraged Sherlock in moments when the pain in his leg led him to swear, like John never heard him. John tried to alleviate his pains with massages and giving bottom to all the remedies he knows. This hug, however, is different. It stems from the sense of injustice for that decision, for this case that had a bad conclusion.
<< Let's say that the gentleman, there, behaved in a very less civilized way >> John growls and Greg looks seriously at him first, then Sherlock's face and finally John’s bloody hands.
The sauna master invites everyone to sit around the swimming pool. At the center of this, on three lifebuoy platforms, the bells of different sizes were positioned. On as many platforms three figures wrapped in long cassocks are seated with crossed legs.
<< It is not possible to fool him even by entering real boy names, because the server recognizes that the host from which he is writing cannot correspond to the cell of the boy's real home and throws out the intruder >>.
<< It doesn't matter >> she whispers, shrugging. << The important thing is that Edward is alive. That he can marry Molly and have many beautiful children. It's a happy ending. They move me so much >>.
Sherlock, however, does not react. He stares at the wide open gate that leads onto the path. The screams have stopped coming to his ear for some time now.
It is the first time that Greg has heard Sherlock talk about rest and he doesn't like it at all. He turns his worried gaze on John whom with a nod, lets him understand that he has the situation under control. Greg nods and leaves the changing room.
"The child. He's the one who wants! " Sherlock thinks to give himself courage and force his body to move. Another cry, certainly launched by the terrified child, helps him to move.
There were also other registers, those on which the hospitalizations of locals and foreigners were noted, who, however, had someone waiting for them. Ms. Abbott had noted the 'kind donations', as she called them, of these people. Hataway had contacted some of them, who had only had words of gratitude for 'that family so kind that took care of me, saving my life'.
"Feelings are a chemical defect of the losing part," says Moriarty. “You shouldn't allow the heart to guide your head. I have always maintained that love was a dangerous disadvantage. "
The woman suddenly walks away, leaving him panting and trembling on the bed. Sherlock for the first time feels his broken leg ache, while a thousand white dots explode before his eyes. His head, already painfull by the blow, begins to ache right in the injured areas.
<< No scene, Greg >> corrects him John. << I think it's the worst thing. His gaze. Its silence. Jesus, what an idiot I am! >>.
<< Because I caught the signs of the impending explosion in the air >> he whispers, getting closer to him. John should move and stop staring at him, by making the gaze travel incessantly from his eyes to his lips. Lips that curve in an even bigger smile and the temptation to grab him by the collar of his jacket and make them his is so strong.
Sherlock presses his hands hard on his ears. He doesn't want to hear these words. This terrible truth. He cannot think of being anything other than a victim of what has happened. He wants to blame John and keep the reasons to himself.
Margaret O'Hara has big eyes, wet with tears and marked by the misadventure from which she was rescued. She runs towards her son, regardless of the calls of her husband. Ms O'Hara throws herself on his knees in front of William, to hold him in a breathtaking embrace. She cries, repeating William name like a litany and caress William's face to make sure it is really him. Then, she squeeze him again to the breast.
<< No, it is not a bad thing. It has its advantages, otherwise I would not have honed my skills by making it a method of investigation. Seeing everything, especially what people don't want to see, however, can be annoying. People tend to move away from the truth >> admits the consultant.
Sherlock tries to free himself. He feels his head spin, for the punches first and then the clash with the wall. He would like to cry out and asks John's help, but Martin's hand again blocks him.Suddenly the pressure of Martin's body disappears and Sherlock finds himself slumped on the floor, this time with his gaze turned to the wall. A long and persistent whistle invades his head. When he finally feels in control of himself, the typical noises of a fistfight reach his ears. Sherlock turns and has to blink several times to focus on what he sees. John's face is a mask of frightening anger. He hangs over Martin on the ground and hits his face, which has become a mask of blood, with a force Sherlock would never have attributed to him.
<< Sure. Except that the doctor is never there. 'You know how it is, he's on a mission with the private investigator' >>.
<< An investigation does not solves with the sensations, John. It needs proof >> reminds him. << How come you have this feeling? Are you being misled by that woman's cognitive impairment? >>.
<< I have to take urine samples. I want to examine them and see if they really drugged me. If I find something Molly will be able to compare the results with what was found in the victim's body and we would get an aggravating circumstance >>.
Sherlock's mother raises her hand to indicate a distant point. He follows its trajectory and barely perceives the sound of an engine, the clang of chains against the asphalt, the glow of two headlights cleaving the black of the night.
“You okay? Do you need to get up?” John was slowly coming back to himself, his military training a hard habit to break. His hand went slack in Sherlock’s as he tried to let him up, but Sherlock’s grasp tightened.
“Would you like to go again, Sherlock? Because, if you would, I would like to be inside you again. Last night was marvellous.”
John’s hand on the back of Sherlock’s nape pushed at his neck, pressing him as close as they could be. John whispered as Sherlock resumed thrusting:
“You just seem to be in unfortunate proximity when she does decide to check on me. She knows how I feel about you. How much I love you. She’s been encouraging. Told me to tell you. You’ve beaten me to it.”
Sherlock watched Rosie climb onto his bed and settle in the curve of her father’s right arm as John settled, again on his back. The unbelievably domestic scene playing out in his bedroom made him dizzy in a way he didn’t understand. So, he panicked and made for the door.
Two hours later, while eating takeaway on the couch, John and Sherlock were watching telly while Rosie absentmindedly missed putting noodles in her mouth.
“I’m going to sit here and you’re going to pretend to forcefully pull me from the seat. I’m not going to let you, and that should pop my shoulder back to where it’s supposed to be.”
At that, John held out his right palm expectantly and waited for Sherlock to squeeze out a bit of shower gel. Sherlock got to work on John’s hair while John sudsed from his incisions down to his wrist. After a bit of low moaning from John when Sherlock’s fingers massaged his scalp, Sherlock laved John’s right arm and back with his own hands, lathering the soap as he rubbed the tired muscles of John’s body. John was slow to relax, but when he finally did, he leant back against Sherlock’s chest while his right arm was washed. Sherlock kissed his neck, as the hand that had been soaping John’s chest made its way over John’s belly and stopped at his belly button, his pinky finger tangling itself in tight, sandy-coloured curls. “If you’ll allow me, I would like to try and attempt this for you.”
“You did research? Also, I’m not the only person here. We’re both doing this, so you need to be enjoying yourself as well. No pressure on yourself, okay?”
“We’re going to be talking the whole time, you know. You don’t have to worry about that. You being here right now is awe-inspiring enough.”
Rosie was in the living room, playing with the toys Sherlock’s parents bought just for her visits there. Unfortunately, they visited so infrequently, the toys were almost new to her. After this visit, they all hoped visiting there, and back in London, would be a common occurrence. John and Sherlock asked if they could come down to visit the week before, wanting to tell them both in person about their new relationship. And to tell them one thing they’ve been bothered by for many years.
“Oh, I think he’d love that very much. Almost as much as he loves you!” He tickled her right hip and she pressed herself closer to her father’s side as she laughed.
It was a good thing Cara’d finished her sandwich because she’d have probably choked on a piece of it.
“I’m thinking of The Queen, and it’s your fault.” Sherlock completely lost his rhythm and began to chortle
“I’ve found I quite enjoy feeding Watsons. I've received plenty of practice for over two years or so with Rosamund. I think I might be able to help her ailing father for a few minutes.”
“Are you okay, then? Was it something corrosive?” John reached for Sherlock’s hands, but Sherlock was faster and slid them to his lap, hidden under the table. John squinted, and tried to deduce Sherlock.
“Together, like we were meant to be. John! Yes!” Sherlock spilt his release on his own stomach and pelvis. John could feel Sherlock contracting around his cock and the inhalation that forced itself into Sherlock’s burning lungs.
“I’m going to tell him that I love him and that I know he loves me too.” For the first time since the conversation started, I felt my spine straighten. I hadn’t felt that sort of determination in a very long time.
John smiled up at him and saw the concern, worry, and fear slide across his best friend’s face. Every time he saw Sherlock’s emotions so clearly written there, John is reminded how far both of them have come.
“I need you to take a few deep breaths for me, to calm down a bit for me, all right? I think it’s going to be over faster than I want it to anyway, but I’d at least like it to last for a few minutes.”
Recently, Rosie had developed an affinity for fish. She saw a telly advertisement for London Aquarium less than a week ago. She shouted out during the commercial, while John was trying to read up on his emails and look for any comments on his relatively dormant blog: ‘Daddy! Daddy! Wook! Fishies!!!”
“If you let yourself be happy, that’s a very vulnerable thing to let yourself have. If you like something, LOVE something, it can be taken from you. I don’t have much more to lose. Wow. I just heard myself say that out loud. I’ve never said that to Ella. Haven’t had the chance to say it to my new therapist. Probably would’nt’ve felt right to say that to anyone else but you. You are so key to my happiness, you know that?”
Sherlock struggles. He feels that the man's body press on his. One hand locks his head against the wall and the other squeezes his arm. Sherlock can't scream. He tries to hit the man but he feels he is without strength.
Sherlock arrives in front of the gate of the estate. An economy car of few pretensions, is parked out front. He cautiously approaches, while the cries carried by the wind get louder and louder.
<< I ... I have no idea >> Sherlock admits won by the tremors. << I'm not foolproof. Some cases I just can't solve them >>.
<< You are young, doctor, and when I was still your age maybe I could have. Now ... now it would all be useless. I am old and tired and I have to put up with it. I just can't be change. I may even want to and even get away with it in other circumstances. In these conditions, however ... >> shakes his head, leaving his thoughts incomplete.
<< Not really >> he admits. << I know few folk songs. I know classic pieces and then I improvise according to the mood and thoughts I have >>.
Sherlock's irises are of an intense blue in which John feels like drowning. The hyperactive  consulting detective is showing him the slow side of himself. He is teaching John to savor every single moment, taking the time to collect all the sensory information that this produces.
"No, Sherlock, that's not a good thing!" John intervenes. "If you call up characters to knock you down or humiliate you even more, we won't get out."
<< Are you still here? >> Sherlock asks him. John notes that the skin of Sherlock's abdomen is red, a sign that he must have rubbed it vigorously. << You are wasting a lot of time! >> adds Sherlock.
<< Daisy Cooper was in the last year in my school. It is from her that I heard about the Fenix portal. She was talking about it to friends in the bathroom at school. I stayed to listen and that same evening I enrolled. At the beginning it was nice, but now ... now it's hell >> tears come down to paint black lines on her cheeks.
<< From good to better >> sighs Greg, caressing his own shaggy beard. << Why did you tell me to send a team to Milton Keynes? What did you find out from the footprints? >> Greg asks and the consultant hands him a package of documents.
<< Hey, don't worry what do you want to do? >> John asks him, blocking what looks like a tired attempt to get out of bed.
<< If I can have my say, however, you are really cute together >> Greg says, winking. John feels his face light up like a light bulb and can't reply.
<< She is shock. With what she is experiencing it is understandable. I told Peter to convince her to come to me of her own will to tell me everything >>.
<< Who tells us that it was not she who threatened the parents by forcing them to kill those people? >> Hataway retorted, when John presented him with the registers found, making him aware of how the parents and brothers had started the long series of murders. If even the chief inspector of the small district of her country is against her, pointing to her as the only person responsible for the facts, what possibilities a woman like this can have to obtain the right punishment?
"I told you that there is at least a positive side in this story." Sherlock smiles amused by John's joke and Mary responds in turn, by smiling. He must be careful of all that confidence.
Sherlock retrieves the bathrobe and puts it on and this sponge hug comforts him. Dizziness is passing. Now he can keep his eyes open for a few moments. Slowly he gets back on his feet. Sherlock realizes he is in the locker room, but does not understand how he got there. Staggering, Sherlock goes to the door and leaves. He reaches the exit from the Spa while the participants in the Aufguss leave the sauna behind him.
Sherlock tries to focus on the face of his attacker, but he just can't. His eyes burned from the contact lenses and then he couldn't keep them open from dizziness and nausea. The attacker voice would recognize it among a thousand, as well as his smell, but Sherlock doesn't remember anything about his face. Sherlock could ask to interrogate all the staff members present at the Aufguss just to hear them speak, but he would reveal his identity. In order not to do this, he should put Lestrade in the middle, have them summoned to Scotland Yard, put them behind the one-way glass. But in that way what happened to him would irreparably discover.
<< Ah, obviously. This is typical of you >> retorts Greg with a chuckle. << I' am happy that you are still here >> Greg says giving a pat on John's back. << Maybe I was a little too strict with you >>.
<< Chief commissioner, if you attacks us, Morgan defense us, what do you expect? >> Sherlock replies standing up. William hides behind Sherlock's legs.
<< My mind travels fast. My body, on the other hand, is damned slow >> Sherlock explains, whispering in his ear.
<< But ... are you sure? I thought he was not only your dog but also an important collaborator during the investigation >>.
<< Are you going to leave the hotel half naked? >> back to the attack John, barely looking at Sherlock.
<< What do you know? You're not a dog >> retorts John, taking closer to him. Sherlock laughs, yawning and approaches in turn.
<< It is not true >> he replies, by moving his pelvis in an attempt to free himself. The rubbing it produces is pleasant and with satisfaction John sees Sherlock's cheeks turn red. << Do you want to leave my hands free or not? >> asks him, embarrassed.
<< Oh, fuck, Myc! >>. John leaps to his feet as if struck by the shock, imitated by Mycroft. << Here's what struck me about her! Oh, Jesus! >> he says, bringing his hands to his hair. << That scarf. It stood out not only for the color, but also for the fine fabric. An Armani pashmina cobalt blue jeans! How did this woman with years old clothes get a similar precious scarf that cost at least £ 80? What about gloves? They were in deer leather lined in cashmere, always by our favorite Italian designer. They cost a hundred pounds. Where could that woman get similar accessories? It can't be a coincidence that Sherlock usually wears the same scarf and the same gloves, don't you think? >>.
<< Then let yourself go >> Sherlock says, placing a kiss on his lips. << At best we start again and then again and again, until we have enough >>.
<< No! >> John exclaims interrupting him, his hand open towards the man and the sketch of a forced smile on his face. << I apologise me, rather. I didn't want to interrupt you. I go to my room. Have a nice evening >> John wishes them, striding to the door.
<< I ... I know that goes against all logic, which you will not fail to get me noticed, but I ... I know he is still alive >>.
<< We don't have much time and I would like to postpone the presentations, if you don't mind! >> says the man, gently but firmly. << We have identified where the Masters of the seminars that were held here in London are >> he says, placing himself between John's armchair and the chair on which Lizzy is sitting. The girl looks at him as if she was hypnotized << Greg, I recommend you to send a patrol at these addresses >> he says, giving him a ticket. << The charges are of solicitation, corruption of a minor, exchange of pedopornography, incitement to pedoprostitution, prostitution and suicide >>.
Sherlock will have the opportunity to meet the sauna master during this Aufguss, which seems to be the good news of the moment.The event is more than an hour away and Sherlock allows himself to rest his head on the bench and close his eyes.
<< I didn't bring it! >> she exclaims, planting huge hands on the table. << No, I never would have. It was her. She is so much stronger than me, and she closes me in the storage room for a long time >>.
John stretches and calmly gets out of the bed. It is normal for him to have a dog who can recognize an interesting case simply by sensing the high levels of adrenaline and fear in those who ring at their door.
They sit in their respective seats and the consultant doesn't seem to want to catch his breath. He diligently places his crutches on the armrest and continues to present his ideas to him. The case is quite simple even in John's eyes, but Sherlock is working on it with all of himself.
<< I can't >> she replies. Mary is crying in silence. Sherlock can imagine her red and swollen eyes. << Why did you lie to me, Edward? >>.
<< I found it! >> John exclaims, pointing the file on the pc. << Sharon describes in detail where the old cottage is located. She lead the child there because she want that he assists to his mother's murder  >> says John, pointing to the screen. << Where's William now, Sherlock? >>.
<< Of course, Greg >> he nods without getting confused in front of his anger. << Even if my intent was certainly not to seduce your daughter >> he adds.
Also the kitchen is like the day Greg ran over to them with a folder full of clues about the train crash that driven him crazy.
<< Billy, Sherlock and John have a proposal for you and Morgan >> says Margaret, attracting the attention of her son, who emerges from the gigantic backpack. William runs to sit next to the consultant and the doctor and Morgan also sits down next to him. Sherlock turns his gaze to John that nods, encouraging him.
<< No! >> Sherlock exclaims, trying to grab the cocoon, but his hands cross him without touching him. << Oh god no, this no! >> shouts, bringing his hands to his head. << I don't want to die >> he shouts getting up. << I don't want to die! >> repeats, looking around the desperate search for someone. In the darkness of this moonless night, however, there are only him and the cocoon.
<< And I fly over his excesses with drugs and smoke >> continues Mycroft, shaking his head slightly to express his disappointment. << I must admit that the only thing in which my brother has never exaggerate is alcohol >> he says and John notices a flicker glimmering in his gray eyes. John obliges himself not to look away and to try to show how little he is touching by what Mycroft is saying. << A bad habit that luckily he never cultivated, unlike you >>.
<< That's what I'm wondering too, John >> says Greg, hands on hips as he shifts the weight from one foot to the other. << Sherlock and I spent the morning analysing all the suicide cases that have occurred in England in the past six months. In 31 of these we found the drawing of the Phoenix >>.
<< Oh, yes, maybe you weren't still there when Johanna was there. She treated Edward sooo badly >>. Mary approaches him, looking sideways at the guard, and brings hier hand close to her mouth. << She used him only for sex >> she whispers, confiding a very important secret.
The man takes a few steps back. He puts a hand on his face and shakes his head. The sight of one's own blood has the power to detonate Martin. He responds to the punch by hitting Sherlock in the face.
Sherlock's stomach twitches to the point of making him double in pain. He finds himself on the ground, on all fours, near the cocoon in which his body is hidden. He no longer sees him tremble.
Anger boils up again and John makes an effort not to go back to giving his worst. John first boasts countless one-night adventures with subjects whose name he doesn't even remember.
<< Ok, John, follow me. And anyway my name is Greg! >> underlines the detective, going to the front door followed by the commissioner and the doctor. Sherlock grabs John's arm.
<< You said you were married to your job. Anyway, it's not my business >> he says, stopping Sherlock attempt to reply. << Do you think you can ... forget what happened in the last minutes? >>.
John sighs. He has now stopped replying to the jokes that his mind proposes to him, using his sister's scornful voice and tone.
Morgan barks, attracting the attention of the three men. Sherlock looks for  him and finds the dog in front of the stairs, his nose facing upwards.
John remained silent to listen to his colleague explain in detail his theory on what happened to the troubled mind of Sherlock. John and Mycroft just exchanged two looks and there was no need to even explain to the doctor how deep the hole he made in the water was.
<< Yes >> answers with conviction. << For too long I have fought against people's boredom and idiocy. Maybe that's the better thing for me >>.
<< Yes, exactly. When I got home I received a message from Mark telling me that I couldn't go on >>.
<< You don't want me to participate in the case and I understand that you are doing it for my sake. But I ask you, please, since the children of a dear friend of ours are involved, to tell me what you found out about the drawing. The few things you and George said this morning are not enough for me >>.
<< Nobody, however, told you about a foreigner man visiting here >> John asks to the owner of the shop of yet another village, that he has diligently noted in his notebook.
"As you said yourself, people only see what they want to see," says Moriarty, shrugging. "For the agents of Scotland Yard you are a freak. For your brother a hopeless case. For your father you were a whore. For me a succulent challenge ...".
<< No, Ms Ford took it from my hands immediately and I couldn't read anything. I never saw her so nervous. Luckily Billy was out with Kelly that afternoon and did not see his father's reaction when Mr Ford came home >>.
Sherlock laughs at his impetuous being and, sighing at his kisses that redden his neck, he ventures under John’s bathrobe. He caresses the bare skin of John's back, on which he draws small circles capable of making his doctor shiver.
<< I want you to do an x-ray as soon as possible. I don't like these wounds at all, we should go to the hospital, Sherlock >>.
<< It will be better! Although the idea of knowing you became an only child entices me enough, I think it is appropriate to join him at the Diogenes Club. Let's go! >> orders and, docile as a dog, Sherlock follows him.
<< I have to go. I have to feed the animals. It will be dark soon >> she mumbles, moving away from them without looking at them. She walk away with heavy stride and shipped to a van. Mary opens the side door, throwing in the wrong way what she purchased. She then climbs to the driver's side and starts up.
<< Have you noticed the conditions in which my father is involved, I guess? >> he says with a remarkable language property for his age. Both nod and exchange glances. << He is already taking too many from my mother, lawyers and judges. I do not want this thing to come to give him other concerns >>.
<< You know, Mary, rents in London are expensive. It happens that people who do not know each other find themselves sharing an apartment to split the rent >> intervenes Hataway, who does not seem surprised at all by the woman's attitude. Mary, however, seems not to have heard it. To be honest, she give the idea of having become a huge, gigantic statue. John glances at the inspector who notes of the strangeness of that stillness.
<< I see it increasingly difficult to find those two alive >> sighs Greg, rubbing his tired face. << Sharon Milton didn't ask for ransom.She didn't give any communication. She took Mr and Ms Ford for the sheer pleasure of killing them and I would like to understand why >> says Greg.
<< I see the snow, Bryan. Keep looking, I don't want to keep them here until spring >> the detective says, pointing to Greg and John. The men cast grim looks at the two Londoners, but continue to dig. Others are added to help them harness the car and a crane is taken to be able to bring it back to the road.
“What a first time! I have been absent several times in these six months, spending the night out often and he must have taken the opportunity to take home who knows who! ".
<< But you're not a detective. You're a doctor >> chuckles the woman, who obviously does not realize how much John's anger is growing.
The lift doors open onto the hotel lobby. Two girls, ready to enter inside, stop, observing the strange scene in front of them.
Sherlock leans over the edge of the hole and observes carefully what the excavator has brought to light.
<< I don't feel guilty about anything, Mycroft >> John jumps up, facing him. << The only thing I feel is that something bad has happened to your brother. Despite the discussion we had, Sherlock wouldn't keep me in the dark about how much it's been living for so long >>.
<< You are so unfair >> Margaret says to her between sobs. Mycroft looks at her in disgust, by taking a few steps back. << You have no idea what I went through in the past year! >>.
<< As I said it's a very big thing. Rosaline Jackson and Daisy Cooper appear to be the first two cases in England, but there may well be others. Not all the details are always taken into consideration when it comes to suicide >>.
<< Now, however, you are here with me >> she says and in the way she shakes his hands, in the sweetness of her gaze, in the infinite tenderness that is able to arouse the child version of this woman, Sherlock realizes that she won't let him go. No. Not even when the leg will heals. Not even when the blizzard will ends and the snow melts. Mary will not allow him to leave her alone again.
<< Exceptional >> Sherlock whispers and his lips curve to draw a smile. John rolls his eyes. Since when does Sherlock Holmes get distracted by a song player on the street when he is engaged in a case?
<< Ok, Sherlock, now you can leave her >> says John, approaching his man. << William and Morgan are fine, the Fords too and the case is solved. Let Greg take Sharon away >> he adds, placing his hand in the middle of Sherlock's contracted back. At that secure contact, Sherlock relaxes. He turns to him, as if he only now realizes his presence. He nods and lets Sharon go. Immediately, five agents take over the woman, passed out from the pain of her arm's fracture. They handcuff her and lead her away.
<< Dad says that he is never wrong, but look what a mess happened because of him! He says that everything must always be perfect. Mom, however, says that only robots are perfect. I'm not a robot and neither are you, so we can also make mistakes and it's not our fault. Kelly always tells me it's a good thing to ask what I need. I need to ask you if I can help you, Mr. Holmes >>.
<< Can you really do it? >> she asks in amazement. Sherlock nods and settles the violin under his chin and asks her with a nod to start.
<< He is in love with me, Greg >> whispers to the point that the detective has to get a little closer to him in order to hear. << I thought he wasn't able to love. Jesus does nothing but reiterate how stupid feelings are! Instead I saw this love. I heard it and ... he also told me >>.
No. John is not homophobic. Indeed, that is a mentality that he repudiates and doesn't tolerates. As a civilian, he never went into action with a man. That was the prerogative of his life as a soldier. There has been no lack of opportunities to him even in these months, but he has given up.
<< We have reserved the 'Ocean Blue' suite >> communicates John to the receptionist. << Sigerson - Rogers >> adds, thus finding those names side by side ridiculous.
<< No! Margaret O'Hara is the wife of this man? Writers are inspired by their works from their life and, in fact, this woman's life must not be fun >>.
The girl's mother goes to meet Sherlock, followed by her husband. Both shocked and both hopeful of hearing from the brilliant consultant that no, their child has not decided to commit suicide. Someone must have hurt her. It is easier to accept the idea of violence leading to murder than an incomprehensible gesture like suicide. John has a stern look at Sherlock, who notices it although he pretends nothing.
There were many similar notes. Names of men and women who have had the misfortune of finding themselves caught by an accident on those mountains and rescued by the wrong people.
That smile, so unusual to be found on his brother's face, captures Sherlock attention. Almost by chance he realizes how the scene has changed around them. They are in a room now. A room that Sherlock knows all too well.
Sherlock returns the smile. He pulls the tuft away from his eyes and looks away. They are so close that John can feel his breathing crash against his face.
Sherlock bows and a tuft of platinum blonde hair comes off the perfect hairstyle created with the gel. John can't believe that his flatmate is inside those ripped jeans in several places and that checkered shirt, open on a gray t-shirt. He dyed not only his hair with that unusual shade of blond, but also eyebrows and eyelashes, giving his already pale face an ethereal aura, broken only by the fake beard that covers his cheeks and chin. With green colored contact lenses he even changed the particular color of his eyes.
<< This mirror is really beautiful, Mary >> he says, amazed to find an object undoubtedly of value in that room and in the hands of this woman.
John waits outside the bathroom. A vise holds his stomach tight. He cannot bear the idea of what has happened and continues to blame himself. He is irritated by that woman and her constant chatter and by himself for being with her all day. And for being behind Sherlock's pout, instead of acting as an adult and trying to clear up their argument.
He would have liked to put his usual acidity into those words, which, however, came out weak and broken by emotion.John nods without being able to say anything.
<< The fastest way to track her down and not lose sight of her >> Sherlock says, shrugging. John sighs and decides to let it go.
“So now you judge him because he brings beautiful strangers to bed? It doesn't seem to me that you are doing anything different, Johnny! ”.
<< Do you really tell me this? >> Lizzy explodes like a fury. << You spending your days in the gym fucking with your instructor >>.
John nods proudly of his decision and something equally courageous snaps inside of him. He brings his hand close to Sherlock's disheveled hair and let his fingers sink into it. His gesture takes the consultant by surprise, but he says nothing to him. Sherlock relaxes at the light touch of John's hand that caresses his curls.
<< A lot >> says John, decide not to add anything else. << The only one who may know something about Sherlock is his brother. You know he doesn't lose sight of him for a single moment >>.
<< I think there is always time to do it. It is part of the cure: on one side the medicines on the other the pebbles removed from the shoes >>.
One of Sherlock's usual texts, one might say. John, however, remains stunned about those last three words. These words have the power to ease the tensions that claw John's viscera. John quickly takes off his coat and runs away. Sara just gives him a nod, now resigned to seeing him run away in mid-shift, and John certainly isn't wasting time with useless explanations. He runs towards the tube and, thanks to a series of coincidences, he arrives in record time at home.
The ringing of the telephone interrupts the sonata in C minor that Sherlock played. John's name flashes on the screen, giving him a sense of urgency.
<< Thank you for your kindness >> Sherlock says, sketching a smile and in response she plants another piece of chicken in his mouth. << Are you a doctor? >> he asks and obviously already knows that a woman like this can be anything but educated. However, he needs to know where all the hospital equipment was procured.
"Because are you going to die, Sherlock," Moriarty tells him, appearing behind him. “It is said that each of us relives his life before dying. You came back here, where your problem started. "
<< You're better off with your natural hair color, you know?>> John says, pulling a tuft away from Sherlock’s eyes.
Yes it was. It really was. And like all the good things that happened to him, John did the only thing he did well: he broke it and threw it away.
Sherlock had tried to get away from his body, while the hands of that woman, protected by latex gloves, washed him with no grace.
<< That long story >> says John after taking a refreshing sip. << I would say that the time has come to tell me >>.
<< My doctor, always romantic >> Sherlock smiles, touching John's leg with his bare foot. << Kelly, William's nanny, said I would be an excellent father >> he says carrying on to touch John's leg with his foot.
John lets his hand slide along the bare back of his partner, who sleeps exhausted leaning against his chest. He feels he has a happy and satisfied smile on his lips, of what his mother would have called a fool.
<< What about Mycroft doing? >> Sherlock asks him, just taking a look in the direction of his brother.
<< I knew it! That idiot to calm down Ford's associates has endangered William's life! >> Sherlock snaps, hitting the wall with a punch. << There is a novel on the folder which has the same title as Margaret O’Hara's best seller >>.
<< Thank you, William. When we find your parents I will tell them that your help was very important for the investigation >> says Sherlock, ruffling William's hair.
<< Oh my God, you can't imagine how grateful I am with yuo, Mr. Holmes >> she says, stamping a wet kiss on Sherlock's cheek, before moving away and hugging John this time. << You saved us, we owe your life, thank you >> she adds, smacking a kiss on the doctor's cheek. << You too, Morgan. You fought like a wolf >> Ms O'Hara says, going down to caress Morgan, who can finally satisfay his desire for pampering.
This time the woman returns to the room with a vial in her hand and Sherlock realizes that, just before vibrating the blow that most likely would have killed him, something inside Mary must have warned her that his condition was linked to the absence of morphine .
<< Yes >> Mycroft answers tiredly, while the nurses leave the room. << I hoped not to see him reduced in this way again. Instead ... >> he dabs the lips with the handkerchief, without ended the sentence, something completely unusual for someone like him.
Only those who had no one who could report their disappearance were 'liquidated', as Mrs Abbott diligently noted. It upsets to realize how many lonely people there are in the world. Yes, because that macabre activity seemed to have started in the 90s of the last century and since then had caused the death of 35 people. For none of these, the disappearance had been reported.
John, Greg and the two women are not sure it was a suitable speech for an eight year old child. William, however, takes seriously what the consultant said.
<< Don't lie to me! >> shouts, grabbing him by the shoulders. << You were sitting up there and suddenly I didn't see you anymore. Did you meet him? What did he do to you? Tell me! >> shakes him violently.
<< What kind of stupid thing you say?. It doesn't disgusts me. It amazes me. Do he deserves your attentions? >>.
<< The snowplows have arrived where Mr Holmes' car was found. They estimate they are from Abbott in three hours >>.
<< I am not addict of it, I use it >> he  replying. Sherlock feels tenderness for that desperate boy who tries to find the courage to stay there, standing, before that ruthless court that has already condemned him.
John sighs and runs his hands over his tired face. Since he returned to Baker Street from the refresher course, he has slept a few hours and only because he has collapsed exhausted between one search and another of his missing flatmate. Because Sherlock is missing now. John is almost certain. He drops into the chair and rests his elbows on Lestrade's desk.
John laughs and the puppy mutters annoyed. The doctor brings his hand to his mouth, continuing to chuckle in silence.
<< Sure >> retorts Sherlock. So far he has never thanked John and has always addressed him in a detached way. John knows that this is part of the package. He did not expect recognition and praise. The fact that Sherlock allows him to be so close to him is already a victory for John.
<< No >> Sherlock admits. << It's not the effect of the beer. Drink much beer it is not a problem for you >>.
In turn, his friend's brother no longer even announces himself with that annoying cough. Mycroft must have understood that John would continue to express his love for the consultant even if the queen herself entered that room or the pope whom his mother had so much in consideration.
“I will be satisfied, then, to bring Sherlock home safely" he sighs. These three hours will also pass and they'll go to that house of horrors and there they will find him. John's more than sure. And Sherlock will be alive. Yes, it can only be this way. John wants it to be so.
<< Does your father know you didn't go to school this morning? >> Sherlock asks the boy, who almost risks falling from the chair he just sat on. He turns a worried look on the consultant, who in return observes him calmly.
<< Of course, Mr. Holmes >> answer Fox, with the same fake and licked courtesy. << We have been working on this case for four months. We stumbled upon the Fenix portal while doing research on cyber bullying and online soliciting against young and kids people. We have repeatedly tried to introduce ourselves into the system with fictitious profiles, but whoever created that portal is a good professionist. Very good. To the point of recognizing us as intruders and throwing us out. It is the first time that we are faced with such an impregnable system and being able to take advantage of the collaboration of a girl directly involved would be an excellent turning point in the investigation. We will have to operate from the girl's pc and from the place where she is used to using it. We will act remotely, my colleague, Sky, is currently in Berlin, where we found another cell of the so-called Masters of this portal >> says Fox. << If you, Mycroft, will have the kindness to provide me with passwords, we will connect to the main frame of the secret services that will allow Sky a greater range of action, saving us the effort and time to force the system and all the problems that ensue >> Fox adds with a bewitching smile just bowing his head.
<< An ex-servant gave an interview to 'The Sun' after she was wrongfully fired, she said. It seems that  Ford is not properly a good husband, much less a good family man. According to the woman, Ford subjects family members and anyone who has to deal with him to constant psychological violence, made up of devaluations, recriminations and psychological blackmail. He tried in every way to hinder his wife's literary career. This woman who must be tenacious, because she managed to publish her best seller anyway. You know her, John. You read her book last year: 'Mather misericordiae' >>.
John holds out his hand to the woman, politely. An unpleasant sensation envelops him when John sees his hand, already small in itself, disappear swallowed up by the huge and massive hand of Mary.
<< Good morning, John.  Hi little one >> says the lady, caressing the puppy who seems to know her well.
Sara looks at him worried and he smiles to her. Everything he wants except having to entertain himself to talk about his gastric problems with a pseudo ex.
<< It is a spite >> says William, immediately seeking Sherlock's approval. The consultant give him it. << Mum listened to me when I showed to her the photos, not like dad. She loved Silver like me and knew he was fine and could not have died of old age. She thought like me that someone poisoned him. I heard she talked about it with dad, but he kept saying it was a nonsense, because Silver would barked if someone tried to enter >>.
<< It does not seem appropriate to waste time with useless experiments! >> says the chief commissioner, who did not like his suggestion to leave the scene. Sherlock slowly turns to him imitated by William. In sync, the consultant and the child sigh, roll their eyes and then leaving Margaret Ford's study.
<< Magnificently, Mr. Holmes! > Fox answers with a big and false smile. << My colleague literally tore the portal to pieces. Currently, Polish law enforcement agencies are going to retrieve the 26-year-old Dimitrj Vadlila, the evil genius who put all this mess up! It will be a real pleasure for me to ask him why his crazy plan and obviously I will keep you updated >> Fox says, getting up from his chair.
They both looked to Rosie and saw the face of a lost little girl. “Oh, Rosamund. Your Daddy is okay!” She didn’t appear to believe Sherlock.
“Of course. I wouldn’t offer if I wasn’t serious.” Sherlock was a photographic example of the word smug.
John had been cleared by his doctor to begin physio two days before the commercial incident. He visited the therapy office and was able to be seen that same day. The therapist told him his range of motion was fantastic for only being four weeks post-surgery. He was already ahead of schedule! He made future appointments with her, Brianne, and another therapist he knew from various injuries he’d sustained by hanging around with Sherlock, Stephanie, for a fortnight from that date.
“You are absolutely correct, as always. Just trying to keep things light so the little Miss down there doesn’t start to get upset. I think we can both agree on that, yeah?”
“You are gorgeous. And all mine.” More praise. Sherlock's back arched at the words. John kissed the plug’s base and then got a hand on it. He gave it a few playful twists and then pressed softly against it, just a bit further, and grazed that nub inside. Sherlock keened.
He toed off his shoes and pushed them under the bed. He laid himself down gingerly, onto his right side. He felt around for the corner of the sheet and duvet and pulled them to his chest. He could hear Sherlock and Rosie in the kitchen, laughing and carrying on. John smiled. Would there ever be a day when he wasn’t surprised by how much Sherlock Holmes loved Rosamund Mary Watson?
After putting Rosie to bed, they spent the next three hours in the living room, in front of a crackling fire, detailing who (they thought) Mary was before John met her. They told Sherlock’s parents why Mary was reluctant to tell John about her previous life and how that fear led her to shoot Sherlock. John told them that the longer he stayed with Sherlock during his recovery, the more difficult the prospect of returning to her became. Sherlock explained how he told John to try to forgive her, to try and make things work for their child. They reached for each other and then found their hands in a tight grip. Mrs. Holmes wiped her eyes during that part of the story, as she watched the two men on the sofa speak of their difficulties during those times. How heartbreaking it must have been for Sherlock to tell John to leave him and go back to the woman who hurt him so grievously.
“I’ll get you sorted, John. Just give me a moment.” Sherlock used his other hand to look up ‘concussions’ online to see what he should do.
"If you get a report of a stolen flower, can you make it disappear? Sherlock involved my daughter in the theft of a scientifically important flower."
“I’ve never done this for anyone other than myself, so I’m a bit apprehensive to pursue this endeavour.”
“It said on a website to make sure the sufferer was able to answer basic questions, to test visual cognition, to make sure they rested and had ice applied to the injury.” Sherlock looked frazzled and a bit sad.
“I just hate to be keeping you from something. Most nights, you have something on. This was sort of an emergency tonight. You’ve really stepped up, handled everything great. This could be one of the more serious emergencies we’ve faced.”
Sherlock moved his arms and crossed them behind John’s neck and pulled John’s mouth to his. He could barely breathe. John kissed him hard, took each of lips in between his own and nipped at them, all the while continuing the slow drag of his cock’s head over Sherlock's prostate. Sherlock moved a hand into John’s hair and scraped his nails gently through the grey strands and across his scalp. Sherlock became non-verbal, only able to make sounds that were delicious to John’s ears. John bore down; concentrated his movements.
He resumed thrusting, and after less than a minute, the pace was becoming uncoordinated and erratic.
Sherlock settled Rosie on the sofa and started a film for her. He wanted to check on John and give him his dinner plate.
My windscreen had always been broken, but the rear-view mirror had always remained intact. I couldn’t see the future through the darkness of my past. But now? All I can see is straight ahead. I don’t want to look back anymore. At least not at the bad things. I know that isn’t realistic, but I want to try to look forward to our future, all it can be.”
Sherlock settled on a frozen lasagne. He walked through the bathroom door to find John sitting on the toilet seat lid, cradling his left elbow, his left temple against the cool tile wall. Sherlock closed the door behind him.
After a few more moments, John stood and shook his surgeon’s hand. “Thank you very much for helping me. I know you did the best you could for me. You tried to put me back together again, and I thank you for that.”
“I think I can do this for you tonight. I want you to be able to feel how I feel when you do this for me. Would that be all right?” John tried to disguise the pleading look on his face. He didn’t want to pressure Sherlock into doing something he wasn’t ready for. This would be his first time.
“Good to know.” John bestowed a kiss to the tip of his nose; his chin. He dragged his thumb over Sherlock’s lips and cocked an eyebrow.
“Such are the pitfalls of being parents. Rosie is pretty cute and all-around amazing, so I think I forgive her for getting sick today.”
“This is such a common procedure, they’re going to let me go home in a few hours. I’m going to be fine.” Something about what John said snapped Sherlock out of the revolving scenarios that were playing across his vision.
“Nice and slow, Sherlock. I love that sound. Am I hitting that spot for you? Deep inside you? Am I, love? Let me hear that blissful sound again.”
"I know how you worried. How you still worry. I’m doing so much better. I took that sling off during the appointment and when she told me I could leave it off, my shoulder almost felt normal again. Until I went to make my first turn with both hands. That sent me right back to Earth. But, you did that. Don’t sell yourself short, Sherlock. WIthout you, and all you did for me, I’d hate to think where I’d be right now. I could put my arms around Rosie today. I missed that from the moment I saw her after my surgery. One-armed hugs are a poor substitute."
John walked over and sat down on Sherlock’s bed and gently pulled off his jumper and flung it onto a nearby chair.
“You are a knockout, you know that? Look at you. Just, lying there, being perfect. Being mine. Fuck. Sometimes I can’t believe it. That it finally happened for us. I waited so long. And I know you did, too.”
They sat in silence for a few minutes as John ate and sipped at his tea. Sherlock just watched him, saying nothing; until he couldn’t hold it back anymore:
John shifted as he remembered their first time doing this a few weeks ago. Since it went so well the first time, might as well try recreating it.
“John. I have loved you for many years; for most of the time I’ve known you. For all the time I was away. I stepped off that roof to protect not only Mrs Hudson and Lestrade, but you. I care for them both, but if they came to harm, I would ultimately survive it. You? I speak to you when you’re not near; I hear your voice in my head, guiding me. All the time. You are my blogger, my doctor, my moral compass, the person I trust to translate for me a world that I largely do not understand. You are, without doubt, my conductor of light. My life would immediately descend into the dark after you breathed your last breath. If I have to sacrifice myself for you to go on, I will not hesitate.”
They’re all crowded in the Holmes’ kitchen. Mr. and Mrs., Sherlock, John, and Rosie. Mr. Holmes made them all dinner, and, as per their agreement, Mrs. Holmes is doing the dishes.
“You’ve done it again. That lilt at the end of your sentences, involuntarily punctuating statements into questions when they clearly aren’t grammatically correct.”
“This morning, you were right. I wasn’t just preoccupied with our future. It was really difficult to see you lying there like that. Hooked up to machines, looking so tired. I could see the pain you were in; it was all over your face.” John swiped at the bit of crumbs that settled on his chest from the last scone on the plate. He turned to face Sherlock on the sofa.
John took in a large breath and exhaled it with force. Sherlock circled the body, not missing a beat. John stood back from him, watching him hover. To be able to observe Sherlock at work was always something special, but after the last two months, he’s shown no ill effects of being case-less.
, mean you. Never you. I just always seem to make shitty choices, especially when it comes to people I’m close to. My family: My parents, and Harry, I mean. Then, almost everything I did with Mary blew up in my face. Then when she died, I let Rosie down. She was never with me; always passing her around to Molly, Mrs. H, my neighbors... I was sitting in my flat drowning myself in whiskey while you were sat here thinking of the worst things you could do to yourself to get me out of what has to be my most monumental failure as a man and father. Everything is always my fault.”
John’s forehead landed at the centre of Sherlock’s collar bones, his nose brushing against the top of his sternum. A kiss. He lifted his head to look up at Sherlock. “No, you were not. Shall we get down to business?”
“This situation is taking a surprising turn. I, for one, am not disappointed in this shift in trajectory.” John pulled their hands down Sherlock’s belly and pressed him closer, and began to rub his quickly hardening cock. A gasp of surprise escaped Sherlock’s mouth and that spurred John’s action and tinged his words with suggestion.
“For a doctor, and former Army Captain, not to mention partner to a genius, you’re an idiot.” Cara set her remaining sandwich on the cling film it had been wrapped in and settled me with a look. A look that said there was a lot more to be said about it.
They arrived at the scene twenty-three minutes later. SOCO was just finishing up as Lestrade had predicted. Rosie toddled over to Greg after he’d yelled “Hello!” at the three of them.
“I just don’t want there to be a huge argument when I need to help you with something, and your pride and ego step in between us. I couldn’t stand it if something happened to our new relationship because of something so idiotic.”
“All right, my little flower, let’s get you upstairs and into your own bed.” Instantly awake, Sherlock rose to help John sit up.
Sherlock smelled it immediately and then his hands instantly went to John’s body and began feeling around. His phone was thrown around somewhere in the car, so he didn’t have access to a torch, and the sun was setting around them.
John pushed his right arm from under the pillow and placed his hand on Sherlock’s right cheek, pushing him to turn his neck. Sherlock obliged and John nipped under his ear and kissed his cheek.
“Sweetheart? Can you stay here in the tub alone for a few minutes so I can go see what Sherlock is getting up to in the kitchen?”
“I thought I asked for tea a few minutes ago. Whatever happened to that? I’m handicapped, don't forget.” He aimed for serious, but a chuckle followed his words.
John got up from the bed to retrieve an old shirt, then got back on the bed and wiped off Sherlock’s chest, as well as his own. He leant to the foot of the bed and pulled the kicked-away duvet up and over their bodies. They laid side-by-side and just looked their fill.
“I think I should be the one to say something then: I’m sorry that this was in doubt for you until a minute ago. I thought you knew. I thought you knew how important you are to both of us. You’ve been helping me raise her for the last two years; you let us move back into this flat with you. You’ve helped me so much, I couldn’t even be able to quantify it. Your support has been off-the-charts incalculable. We would be lost without you. I would be lost without you. In fact, I have been lost without you once before, and I’d rather not relive that again.” John took a breath, and it appeared that Sherlock had yet to take one of his own since John began to speak.
’ Sherlock copied the military stance he’d seen John portray over the ten years they’d known each other; straightened his back, and his own resolve in the process.
“I’ve been ready for that for a very long time! Grab the lube and get a bit on your index finger for me.”
As if magnetised and inexplicably drawn to him, Sherlock immediately pressed to John’s side, pushing his forehead against the curve of John’s neck.
“I’m a bit hurt that you didn’t tell us about this sooner. But I suppose I can understand it a bit. This is going to be difficult to keep from the little one as she gets older. She’s bound to start asking questions about her mother sooner rather than later. I hope you boys have put a bit of thought to what you plan on telling her when the time comes.”
“I would love to take a shower with you, Sherlock.” He reached for Sherlock and grasped his left elbow to steady him. And himself. This was a huge step and they needed to take it together.
“Come on, John. You’re almost there.” Cara was leading me to a place I’d been so desperate to go. I just needed someone to tell me it was okay.
“Fishies?” She looked at both of their faces, seeming to remember the advertisement from a few days ago, but not being able to place it.
“Can I see your finger? You mean that long, thin, pointy thing that looks like an icicle? Yes, Sherlock, I can see your finger. Even when you move it side to side, and especially when you come closer and move it away. Going cross-eyed hurts concussion sufferers, by the way.” John is lying on his back now, Sherlock looming above him.
“Could I just? Hold you for a few minutes? I haven’t been able to do that since all of this started and I just want you in my arms for a bit, yeah?”
"You're like no one I've ever known. I figured that out the day we met. I don't think there's anyone else on this Earth like you. I wanted you in my life as soon as I saw you in that lab.”
“As I was speeding across the city to get to you, so many things flashed in front of my eyes. All the things you’ve done and said, things I’d never noticed before. Right before I found the DVD from Mary, Mrs. Hudson was giving Mycroft what for. She said something that tilted my entire perspective of our friendship. Our relationship. Everything you do for people, all the sleuthing, and the deductions, you do all of that because you care about people! You are one of the most emotional people I’ve ever met, but you hide behind ‘sociopath’ like it’s the only thing keeping you distant from the rest of us. Your emotions are what make you so magnificent. You could sit down at Scotland Yard and work on cold cases until you are old and grey, but you don’t. You say that you hate people, but you care about all of the people you help. And, until that moment over there with Mrs. H and Mycroft, I didn’t realise that of all the people you know, you have done the most for me.” He curled his hands into fists, and then determinedly straightened them both and laid them on top of his thighs.
“We’ve committed to each other. Long-term. For the rest of our lives, if we understood each other correctly.”
“I want this to be good for you, John. You’ve been saddled with someone with zero experience in these matters.”
That was all it took to get them to giggling and suddenly they knew that they were on the right road. At least they were trying.
“You absolutely were, John.” Sherlock’s breathing was becoming laboured in spite of his attempt at indifference to John’s efforts.
“I’m not doing all the work. You can wash your left side and I’ll get your back and your right side when you’re finished.”
“I’m not really frightened of the surgery, John. I think my anxiety is about the future. The more immediate part of it. Especially after what we have recently become.”
John had already removed the hunk of glass and wrapped his hand in a towel. He applied pressure as he stooped beside Sherlock.
“Bear down for me, Sherlock. That’s the way. Loosen up for me. Oh. Sherlock. That’s amazing. You feel so good. I knew you would. I knew this would be spectacular.”
“My level of flawlessness should not be something to which you should aspire. Leave that to the perfect amongst you.” He kissed John’s hair. He spoke softly against it: “Just because you had contention in your relationship does not, and should not, mean that you erase all the good things you’d had with her.”
Once that was completed, John had to go to physical therapy two to three times a week for twelve weeks. He also had to wear a bone growth stimulator two hours every day to speed up his healing process. After all of that, it was determined that John’s fusion hadn’t healed as well as his neurosurgeon had hoped.
“You’re just fuelling this, John. That man back there? He loves you.” She gestured behind herself with her right thumb.
“John? Are you sure you’re okay?” Sherlock took a step forward and placed his left hand between the wings of John’s shoulder blades.
“Are we going to have our days planned out like this forever? Appointments and errands and chores?” Sherlock sounded wistful as he settled in John’s arms. ‘In John’s arms.’ What a heady thought.
John slid down Sherlock’s thighs and then he knelt between them. “It’s okay, Sherlock. Give me a minute.” He ran his left hand up and down Sherlock’s right thigh to soothe him.
“I have a pretty good idea what’s eating at him.” Cara unwrapped the egg on white bread with a raised eyebrow.
Upon his return, Sherlock noticed that John did as he was advised. ‘Good. He remembered what I told him to do. That’s very good. He’s fine.’, he thought to himself. He removed his own clothes, got in beside John, and adjusted the flannel wrapped around the ice bag. He laid back and pulled John to him; laid John’s head on his chest and pressed the ice bag gently to the back of his head and held it there for him.
“I could use a few of those nappy wipes, though.” Sherlock chuckled and then stretched for the night table and brought the package to the bed and dropped it between them. He reached inside and pulled out several of them and began to wipe off John’s torso with his right hand while lying on his left side.
“I’m going the speed limit. I’m not speeding. Shit. I can’t see her now. Where the hell did she get to?!”
Sherlock went back to the kitchen, coming through the door John had entered through a few moments before. “What’s happened?”
“Nasal mucus! HA! Couldn't you just say ‘snot’?” John’s body was shaking the bed, his laugher uncontrolled.
“Watson? How would you like to go on a really boring case with us?” He said it in such a way as one might to a pet to make them do something they’d regret doing. As long as the tone is positive they’re usually up for it. Rosie turned out to be no different.
Molly looked helplessly between them both. Rosie offered her a few of the pieces to her game as a way of getting her to play along. Molly had never been more grateful to play a children's game before that moment.
Sherlock tightened his arms around John’s torso and pushed his mouth to John’s left shoulder. He mouthed against the three scars there, kissed them all, and moaned John’s name as he began to thrust.
He queued the song up on his phone as he heard John tinking the spoon around in Sherlock’s mug. He got out of bed and slipped on the dressing gown he’d hung on the back of the bedroom door last evening. He opened the door as John was walking down the hall, still humming, his phone still in his hand.
John laid back and waited. Slowly, Sherlock brought his slippery finger to John’s hole and rubbed it in slow circles. John moaned at the sensation, which only gave Sherlock confidence. After a minute of rubbing and massaging, John spoke up. “Get a little more lube and I think I’ll be ready for your finger to go inside. Just slick me a bit on the inside, and smear a bit around the hole and we should be all ready.”
“You can move now, love. When you’re ready.” John got his right arm around SHerlock’s back and pulled him tighter to his body; his left hand on Sherlock’s nape. He slipped his fingers in the dark curls there and played with his hair until Sherlock found himself again.
“He said a five. Body is fresh. SOCO is almost finished with the scene. They should be done around the time we’d arrive.”
It was a Saturday morning, only just; a bit before noon. Looked like pastries for lunch instead of the fruit they were planning on feeding Rosie.
“What the hell happened in here?” John glanced from Sherlock to the table top, the floor, and then back to Sherlock’s face.
“Stop diminishing what I’m saying. You’re fantastic. I don’t say it enough, so I’m going to say it all the time.”
John’s face fell for a moment. His anger dissipated immediately when he was able to recognize the emotions playing out on Sherlock's face.
John held up his uninjured hand while his right remained on the tabletop. “Hey, now. Calm down. I wasn’t insinuating anything. You’re the one who used the word ‘reckless’ to describe what happened tonight. I would’ve called it ‘clumsy’ myself.”
After a rather uneventful train ride, John, Sherlock, and Rosie visited Sherlock’s parents in Hastings for most of the last week. Mrs. Holmes showed Rosie the garden, in which a few areas had been planted with her in mind. “See, my Primrose” I planted these because of your name! They’re called Primrose, just like the nickname I’ve given you! I just wish they were as lovely as you!”
“Bloody Christ on a cracker!” John stood from the bed and removed his clothes with significant haste. He climbed back onto the bed and grabbed a hold of both of Sherlock’s knees and pushed them a bit further apart. He kissed each one and began to trail kisses up Sherlock’s thigh.
“Must we argue this? I have a child in the kitchen to tend to. Do I also need to parent her father?”
Ever since his birthday over two years ago, they’d become more tactile; less inclined to refrain from touching the other with comforting gestures. Crying against the chest of your best friend while he gently held you tends to thaw the self-imposed ice that froze your past emotions.
They rode their pleasure out together, panting in each other’s embrace. John kissed and nibbled at Sherlock’s neck as his thrusts turned lazy and Sherlock began to relax in his arms. He stayed inside Sherlock until he softened enough to slip out of him.
John’s right hand went to his mouth to try to stifle the laugh that tried to escape. Laughing at Sherlock when he was completely serious would most certainly cause a row.
“So, here’s what I was thinking while you were in the shower: we’ve both been recently tested, me, right before my surgery, and you, a few months ago when we weren’t sure about your iron levels. We’re both negative for any STDs. We can forgo a condom if you’d like. If not, I may still have some upstairs in my night table. I’m also thinking this time, because of my shoulder, I would love it if you would be the penetrating partner. I can be here on my back. That should eliminate any possibility of me re-injuring myself. Does that sound all right to you?”
The easy part of the extended weekend happened on their first full day. They’d been on a nearby beach, Rosie between Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, dipping their toes in the sea as it lapped at the shore. John and Sherlock trailed behind them, at what they thought was a safe distance. They held hands as they watched Rosie, as she ran towards and then away from the rolling waves, squealing in delight. The bank of The Thames would never be good enough for her again. Mr. Holmes turned to see where his youngest boy had managed to get to and he saw what he’d never dared hoped for: his boy, in the arms of someone he loved, be kissed and held on the beach he played on as a child. He tapped his wife’s arm and jerked his head behind them. Mrs. Holmes squealed louder than Rosie had a few moments before. She jumped in the air in glee and leant down to pick up Rosie and spun her around as well. The trio all turned to see John and Sherlock holding each other while stealing glances between the horizon and each other’s faces. Their detective senses tingled: They felt eyes on them and turned to see the rest of their family dabbing at their eyes, Rosie bouncing on Mrs. Holmes’ hip. “Daddy ‘n Papa kissin’!” Mr. and Mrs. Holmes just stared at Rosie, her declaration stunned them both. She looked as confused by all the fuss as they looked surprised. The jig was up.
<< If I am in your shoes, I wouldn't go against him. He has reduced to a minimum the woman who reduced you like this >> Sherlock warns him, without hiding the pleasantness he feels in teasing him.
<< Sorry >> he whispers in turn, freeing him from the grasp of his hands. << Those bruises. Before you didn't have them and they are the same ... >>.
<< We wouldn't have bothered to come here if we hadn't already tried everything to force that damned portal >> says Sherlock, trying to make his brother understand how serious the situation is. Mycroft takes a look at him, then returns to look at Greg. John does not understand what can go for the genius mind of the older brother of his flatmate. If Sherlock seems incomprehensible to him, Mycroft is a real enigma for him.
John walks slowly down the corridor. His footsteps resound and reverberate, announcing his presence brazenly. The noise annoys him. He would like to take off his shoes and go barefoot, but he does not believe it is the best thing to present himself in front of a murderess, wearing only socks.
John puts his ear to the bathroom door that connects to Sherlock's room. He opens it slowly and sees a cushion placed on the ground with a bowl of water next to another bowl that hosted the puppy's food. Sherlock sleeps on the right side, covered from the waist down from the sheet. The puppy sleeps happily near Sherlock's bare chest, protected by his embrace.
<< I can't think that's just why, Mycroft >> tried to insist John. << You are talking about a boy prey to the fumes of abstinence. It has nothing to do with what we have witnessed before >>.
<< This is not the point >> Sherlock answers << In fact, it is quite elementary. Just look around >> he says with a blatant gesture. << Few books, no personal effects on the desk, the considerable amount of time he took to find the key to this room. Everything tells us that he recently became director and that not all members agreed. This unfortunate incident, as he called it, could end his short career. That's why he's in such a hurry >>.
"And you, on the other hand, were expecting declarations of eternal love and much more tender sex," shakes Moriarty.
<< Oh, Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson! Billy is constantly talking about you. He is so happy that you are dealing with this bad story >> the girl welcomes them, holding their hands in his. << I am Kelly Jonson, William's nanny and she is Ulrika Moresku, the cook >> she says, introducing the other woman, who shakes their hand vigorously. << When I got here this morning the police told me that the kidnapper  taken also Billy. Instead, he is here and I'm so happy >> the nanny says, crying sincere tears of joy. << Billy told me he closed himself in the closet. He told me about that game proposed by his mother. Billy kept telling me that she was worried that someone would hurt them >>.
<< You are a very, very bad child, Billy >> says Sharon, getting up with difficulty. William observes that bloody face, with cheeks torn and eyes red and desperate shouts all his terror.
Sherlock nods and a smile drawning on his lips. He turns his gaze to Morgan and he barks happy, already sensing what the next move will be.
<< Me too. Unfortunately, that portal is impregnable and in order to get to who is behind all this mess, Sky needs more power >>.
The door opens and the light hurts his eyes once again. The last. From the bottom of his desperate condition, Sherlock can see Mary rise in her mighty size. The ruthless gaze, the mouth a pale clean line. She says nothing. She stands there, one hand at the door and the other along the side.
<< Thank you, Mr. Holmes. Our means of persuasion are also very efficient, but we will not give up accepting your help in case the subject proves to be a tough nut to crack >>.
<< A bad situation, yes >> confirms Sherlock. << As I said this morning, the system is made up of three distinct phases. At the beginning they really only give information and answer users' questions. They are assigned a tutor, who begins to become familiar with the young, gathering more and more confidential information, strengthened by the trust of these desperate people. At that point they make a skim and focus on the most fragile, inviting them to attend free public conferences. Conferences conducted by real experts among which, however, there are unrecommendable characters >>.
The little man  frightens at the way John look at him. The director's gaze travels from John’s bloody knuckles to Martin's face and visibly swallows, telling himself that it is better not to anger the quiet colleague of the famous Sherlock Holmes.
<< Sherlock, I love dogs. I have nothing against them. I just say that with the life we lead I find difficult for us to take care of a dog as he deserves >>.
One of the guys from the forensic department team, checks the three copies and shakes his head in amazement at the accuracy of the consultant's description. John proudly observes the scene and, possessively, lays his hand on the shoulder of his man, who analyzing the contents of the PC.
<< I am not as good as you, but my school fellows leave me alone the same >> confesses the child, grasping the profound meaning of what Sherlock said. << They say pirates are an boring and you are a publicity stunt. Silver liked both playing pirates and investigations >>. Another tear rolls down William's eyes and Morgan licks it off. << Dogs like tears, Mr. Holmes? Because even Silver always licked them >>.
Sherlock knows he was wrong. If he hadn't declared his love to him, maybe John wouldn't have pulled back. Love is too demanding, especially if declared so early.
<< I hosted a man for one night. I don't see what's wrong >> Sherlock says, typing a message quickly.
Sherlock hears the two sides of himselve talking to each other. The one who tries to find a way to persuade the woman to replace the IV, arguing the choice with the possibility of being lucid and able to respond to it in order to avoid incurring other punishments. The other who, instead, tries to convince him to resist, reminding him how the physical effects of the crisis pass faster if the hiring is recent. Then only the pain in the leg would remain, but that would manage to manage it by isolating it in a room of his Mind Palace, as he regularly does for the headache or for all the bruises that he finds himself after every case that requires active action.
<< No, Greg, I'm wrong, sorry  >> he sighs. << It's that ... maybe a bit I feel like I have abused him. I should have stopped, I was the more sober of the two. Instead ... >>.
<< Hey wait there, you two, I can not make you go down alone! You risk polluting the evidence >> shouts to them Greg. The child and the dog are immobilized a step away from the door. The detective reaches them, holds out his hand to William who takes it with a grimace and, followed by Morgan, leave the room.
<< John! John, that's enough! So kill him, enough! >> says holds John tightly in his arms to stop his fury. << I'm fine. He did nothing to me, calm down >>.
<< I'm sorry >> he only manages to whisper. Sherlock looks at him in amazement and barely sketches a bitter smile.
<< Sherlock >> insists the brother, catching his hand . << Is it possible that you didn't understand what the man you fell in love with is made of? >>.
"I don't permit you to kill him too," Sherlock thinks as he enters the large kitchen. A small wooden door was opened with enough force to unhinge it and hangs miserably on one side. A tall man, dressed in a long dark coat with a raised collar, gives Sherlock his shoulders. The man is breathless and his hands are on his face. Sherlock sees only the tuft of light brown hair ruffled by the rush.
John turns on the bulb from the switch located outside and looks at the floor. This is the only way to notice the presence of scratches on the inside of the door.
"This time I'm afraid it's all my fault, Greg!" John thinks, greeting him with a wave of his hand. He closes the doorway and looks at the door of their apartment.
Someone knocks waiting diligently for permission to enter. The door opens slowly and a boy peeks into the room.
<< I'm sorry >> Sherlock says, realizing how much better it is for him to keep her good. She could kill him with one hand in the condition he is in. It seems that Sherlock have done the right thing, since what may seem like a smile appears on the woman's hitherto expressionless face. The pale lips curve to the sides, slightly changing the expression of the square face with a broad forehead.
"Oh, look at yourself!" James exclaims in disgust. “I admit that if at our first meeting I found you reduced in this way, I would have thought twice before getting involved you in our nice game. Come on, amaze me,  consulting detective. Why are these carcasses found here? ”.
The vulgar laughter of John's fellow drunken soldier, resounds in Sherlock's head. It was this man who had taken Sherlock and dragged him with them to that dirty pub. That man that had supply him with alcohol, that was on him, that embarrass him. John hadn't said anything to defense Sherlock. On the contrary, he had chuckled amused and pretended to be embarrassed by the words of his former comrades. It is also possible that everything was prepared. Yes, it is possible that he, the brilliant consulting detective, has fallen into a trap. That John, accustomed to seducing and abandoning, as his friends were keen to point out, had asked them to help him to go his flatmate to bed with him. John needed their help to then be able to stage the victim of the circumstances, perhaps blaming him for drinking and being, as usual, out of place, intrusive, 'crazy', in fact. A comfortable way to be able to keep his place in their flat and, perhaps, also by his side during the investigation. It is the only thing that interests john, however, of him. The possibility of living dangerously given to him by the cases Sherlock agrees to solve.
John feels his face flare up and is happy that Sherlock immediately headed for the door, missing the red explosion on his face. He follows him silently and in silence they remain all the way.
<< Experience has taught me that with Sherlock even a few minutes can be crucial >> Mycroft says and his lips curl up to form that fake and mocking smile that from the first time John saw him he found it annoying.
Sherlock nods, still dazed by the beatings and that furious version of John. He calls Lestrade and tells him that he has solved the criminal investigation and grabbed the killer. Sherlock made the next call to the chief of the hotel, who run into the locker room where the consultant, doctor and attacker are still sitting on the floor, while the deep and deep notes of Tibetan bells come from the large swimming pool. The little man looks horrified at the blood mask that has become the face of an unknown member of staff.
<< Do you mean that someone was keeping an eye on her from before? >> John asks him and Sherlcok slowly nods.
<< I just wanted  to stop them >> she whispers, becoming small small. << I took care of those who then let go. Dad didn't want me to get close to the others. He said that I'm so stupid that I could get them into trouble. When dad fell down the stairs and died I thought it would all be over. That we would not have all those people anymore at home and would not even throw the lonely ones away in the pit anymore. Instead, Freddie found another one and mom told him they could do it. He was a very kind old man. I wanted to take him secretly to Mr Inspector, but when Oliver discovered me they hit me a lot, all four, and mom was there to watch. Then they closed me in the storage room and I thought that also I was going to die in  there. I was always afraid that they would lead me to that pit too >>.
Sherlock replies with a snort and has no intention of following his advice.With another key, the manager opens the imposing door of his office and leads them inside. The white walls are laden with bookcases with few books. A large painting (behind which a safe surely hides) towers behind the desk in precious wood. The director sits down in his chair and invites them to do the same.
Sherlock looks at him in amazement and John feels an unusual pleasure in being able to amaze the brilliant consulting detective. John sees Sherlock move on the chair, suddenly uncomfortable, change the crossing of the legs and risk dropping the cup perched on the armrest.
<< Yes >> he replies seriously. << I have always tried to protect you and this time I was so stupid that I didn't immediately see how delicate the situation was. I thought you went away to spite John and instead ... >>.
<< Yes, the smallest. Freddie always told me that I was born by mistake. Mom was fed up with having children and when she found out about me she tried to have an abortion but she couldn't. This is why I was born stupid >>.
<< Not even for me, John. That's all. You are everything to me, John >> Sherlock admits shaking John’s hand.
Suddenly the support of Mary's strong arms is lost and Sherlock falls. He shouts taken by surprise and immediately hits the cold and hard surface of the pit.
<< I understand! Now that even from the coroner's findings on those corpses came out a lot of evidence on how totally crazy she is, why are we still here instead of being already on the way to her house? It has stopped snowing for some time now >>.
<< Until you had to talk us about their involment on the investigation and also bring your brother on the case >>.
Sherlock rented the car under the name Edward Nolton, they had discovered. He was investigating undercover, Hugh Paddington explained, to carry out his investigations undisturbed.
<< Your mother's novel is so trivial that, while killings, the woman sings a song. Do you want to hear it? >>.
<< You got it! It's about kidnapping. Albert Ford, his wife Margaret and their eight-year-old son were kidnapped tonight. No ransom has yet been requested. The chief commissioner is nervouse and I haven't useful clues >>.
<< Yes, it also happened to me to take the telephone and not hear anything on the other side. Someone called and as soon as some of us answered he putted down. Mr. Ford said it was just a joke. Ms Ford, however, was seriously nervous about the thing. She had a nervous breakdown two weeks ago, when the telephon rang  every hour. She begged her husband to call the police, but he didn't want to know about it. I think that what happend it is caused by the carelessness of that man. I know that it is not good to speak in this way of my boss, but I don't care that someone kidnapped him. Ms Ford, however ... she does not deserve it >> says the cook, being moved and new tears are dried from her handkerchief. Sherlock places a hand on her shoulder and the comforting gesture takes John and Greg by surprise.
Sherlock looks at the pit full of corpses. He stands at the edge of this secret cemetery and is watching the worms over rotting bodies. Sherlock crouches down to be able to see them better. Smalls and plumps, they nibble the flesh once alive without having pain or torment. Without wondering where this food that feeds them comes from, who it was, how it lived, what it fed in turn. None of the silly questions that humans usually ask themselves about the food they eat.
<< No >> Sherlock says and it's up to him, this time, to quell yet another silly explosion of the chief, placing his open hand in front of him. << I am not, because Mr Ford is not the object of the kidnapper's aims >>.
<< Go back to London, Lestrade. Take back your notes and focus your attention on that clue that has given you so many thoughts. There it is the key to everything. And remember that solving a problem is achieved by always choosing the simplest solution >>.
<< Of course! What an idiot I am! >> Sherlock exclaims, clapping his hand on his forehead. He runs to John and presses a kiss on his lips. << My surefire light conductor! >> says tapping John's cheeks. << We are dealing with a writer! A writer >> shouts, but neither John nor those present seem to grasp the reason for his enthusiasm. Sherlock passes his hands exasperated on his face and takes a deep breath. << Sharon Milton stalked O’Hara by putting into action what she wrote in her stories. It is there that we will also find the place where O'Hara is held prisoner >> he says, pointing to the pc.
<< We got carried away a bit, Sherlock >> John had started, serious and distant. << We were both drunk and ... it can happen. Yes, I would say that can happen >> he had wrinkled his nose in the way Sherlock always found funny, but that at that moment it was not at all. << I think it is better that this remain an isolated fact not to be repeated. I think it's better for both >> he concluded by wetting his lips.
John digs in his trouser pocket and unearths his mobile, thumbing through the gallery for a moment until he lands on the picture he wants.  A few months ago after a case, he’d been possessed of a silly mood and took a snap of Sherlock just after his triumphant Great Reveal.  As he was winding his scarf back around his neck, Sherlock’s eyes had caught John’s and he’d winked theatrically.  Somehow, John had managed to catch him at the perfect moment: dark curls swirling around his face, cheeks flushed, lips turned up in a quirked grin, eyes dancing with mischief, and his fingers just pulling the blue wool tight at his throat.  If any single photograph can distill the essence of the Sherlock that John has fallen in love with, this is it.  John turns the phone towards Alex and watches, gratified, as his mouth drops open in a comically large O-shape.
“Electrical wire,” Sherlock confirms, his voice expressionless.  “See the marks at the end?  The cord was frayed.”
The faux-anxious expression slides from the detective’s face and he gives John a gentle, satisfied smile.  The long, slim fingers gentle but don’t leave John’s grip.
“He just said no,” John says to the empty room.  He feels the realization creeping up on him and Mary nods as if she hears his thoughts whirring.
Sherlock protests in his most put-upon tone, but he’s already up throwing away his food container and flicking the off switch on the computer.
“… What?”  Sherlock half-turns to glance at him in confusion, his eyes drifting down to where John’s fingers still linger on his bare arm.
“Damned if I can keep the names straight,” John chortles.  “I just know it started out sounding like a sad gypsy and then got quite bouncy.”
“Christ, John, she was clever!  She was new and interesting.  I found her intriguing and yes, I was a bit impressed.  But I was never
Dragging the other chair over with his foot, Sherlock places Rosie on the table between them.   John gives her a quick once-over and is relieved to see that the lion’s share of the redness has gone down.  On further inspection, though, there’s still an angry patch near her collarbone that hasn’t calmed and causes the little girl to howl when he gingerly presses a fingertip to the nearby area.
“You can see her point, really,” John continues after a moment.  “‘Sherlock’ is a hell of a mouthful for someone who's not even two yet.”  After a sufficiently humorous pause, he adds, “Or anyone, for that matter.”
“For God’s sake, Sherlock, just let me look at it!” John grumbles.  “I told you that I think it’s more than just a jam.  When he tossed you over that desk, the jar from the fall likely dislocated the joint.”
The blue eyes fix on him keen as lasers and Alex’s expression goes slack with surprise.  And then the eyes get wide as saucers and flick back towards the picture of Mary and Rosie.
If Sherlock hadn’t been so surprised, he may have been able to rein in his startled response but he knows John sees it, the panic in his eyes.  “Don’t be ridiculous,” he answers, too quickly.  “Of course there isn’t.”
“Well, she doesn’t know that.  You spend just as much time with her as I do, so it’s only natural she’d think you’re her dad, too.  And anyway,” John can’t help that his happiness ebbs away a bit as he stares down into the girl’s sweet face, “it’s not like she’ll remember Mary.”
“You once called me the most human human being you’d ever met, John.  I feel … need the same as anyone else does but desire and attraction?  I just … don’t feel it.  Well, not
John’s out at the surgery for another two hours and twenty-seven more minutes, counting the cab ride home, and Rosie will be on an outing with Molly until at least tea time; no reason not to play it now and just get it over with.  But he can’t seem to force his fingers to close over the disc enough to take it to his laptop to play.  His extremities are numb, his heart races, and a bit of a flop sweat has broken out on his brow.  Stupid, stupid.  Nothing to be afraid of, even Mary’s said it herself right on the envelope, knowing he’d be terrified to find out whatever piece of advice or instruction she’s deemed important enough to save for last.
Sherlock doesn’t bother with a “goodnight” in response, just brings the phone down from his ear and stares at it after he hears Lady Smallwood rings off.  Sometime in the minute or two where Sherlock stands gaping at his mobile, the downstairs flat door opens and closes and John shuffles up the stairs, the distinctly uneven thumping gait indicating that he decided it easier to walk Rosie up the stairs and carry the chair than attempt to carry her up in it like last time.  His shoulder ached for a week.  Sherlock has only managed to make it as far as the sitting room by the time John and Rosie have hung up their jackets and wandered in.
“Ironic, coming from you,” John rejoins but he returns Sherlock’s grin as the other man pads out on bare feet, Rosie babbling in his arms.
“Well, you can hardly blame me for being … surprised,” John says in a rush, his cheeks tinging pink.  “After seven years of you ignoring or actively dismissing anything that has to do with sex, you can understand why I would think you had no interest in sex—”
Sherlock digests this and turns his gaze to where the little girl’s eyes still stream fat tears that soak the shoulder of John’s t-shirt.  John’s pace is relentless as he rocks and the child clearly doesn’t appreciate it.
Sherlock turns and walks back to them slowly.  When he makes it over to John, Rosie thrusts out her hands and squeezes her fists open and closed in the air, grabbing towards Sherlock just as she had done for John.  Sherlock’s breath hitches before he raises his arms to take her.  John hands her over without hesitation and watches, smiling, as she settles in his friend’s grasp.
John squelches a smile.  He talked to Dr. Simon for no more than thirty seconds once Sherlock left.  “Mmmmm,” he mutters noncommittally, rocking Rosie.  He has no doubt waiting the detective out will yield interesting results.  He’s not wrong.
John hands fist in his lap but he doesn’t look away.  “You just …” His voice drops to a half-whisper.  “Transform.”
“A case?  Hardly the sort of thing you need to call me for, brother mine.  You seem to do well enough through the Yard and your little blog.”
“You as well,” Alex says as he heads out the door of the exam room.  He pokes his head back in to give just the hint of a cheeky smile.  “Keep your eyes on your one, yeah?  He looks like he’s trouble.”
The tone trends up at the end a minute amount, a question without being a question; John is asking Sherlock to give him a reason to stay.  Sherlock remembers the expression of veiled panic on John’s face when he called Sherlock ‘beautiful’.
“Sherlock,” John prods, because with all the other evidence, it isn’t really so far out of the realm of likelihood to think that they might have raped him.
in the series, including (but not limited to): Rosie (at various ages), Mary (though I won't say how, other than "yes, she's really dead"), Lestrade, Molly, Mrs. Hudson, and Mycroft.  Possibly more as it fancies me.  That doesn't mean, however, that each of these characters will appear in every vignette.
“John?” Sherlock says again, only this time John notices that it’s distinctly a question.  “John, what do you want?”
“Besides, it is at least somewhat self-serving,” Sherlock says as he hoists himself to his feet.  “Haven’t I said I’d be lost without my blogger?”
Sherlock actually freezes in the act of sitting down.  His pulse erratic – surprise; fear – his hands clenching in the air – nervous tic; picked up from John?  Impossible – for once, he’s not sure he can trust his own brain.  John
“The mug slipped right from my fingers,” Sherlock babbles in a voice tight with entirely fake anxiety.
“The latter,” Sherlock admits, gratified that John’s smile deepens as he offers Sherlock a takeaway container and some plastic silverware.  Sherlock inhales deeply and then opens his mouth to ask but John beats him to it.
happening here in the last twenty years regarding a centuries-old church.  The parish congregation is active and devoted, the building is in good repair despite having had several refurbishments in the last hundred years or so … and yet, nothing.  Not a single piece of any record regarding the building since November 1997, as if the whole building and all of its contents don’t even exist at all.  A few threads of something keeping picking at my brain but I can’t make it come together.”
“Come along, Watson,” he says, using his stupidly expensive dressing gown to mop up the dribble from the side of her mouth before throwing it over his shoulder. “You and I will go visit Mrs. Hudson once we’ve cleaned you up so your father can idle about in his dressing gown.”
“I did not.  I looked comfortable and responsible for a toddler who has a knack for ruining clothing.”
John can’t help but snigger.  “Leave it to you to be an expert in the ponciest martial art out there.”
There is a tremendous amount of rustling, hushed angry whispers, and a soft, “absolutely not!” from his brother before some disturbance against the mouthpiece of Mycroft’s phone.
He doesn’t realize he’s said it out loud until Sherlock’s face pinches and he asks, “Who?  Right about what?”
“Ah,” John says and clears his throat, snatching a face flannel from the sink and draping it over his lap.  “I suppose when I said ‘giving Rosie a bath’ I should have been clearer and said ‘I’m in the bath with Rosie.”
Does he ever do it elsewhere in the flat?  The kitchen or sitting room?  John knows that Sherlock wouldn’t do it on the days where he was minding Rosie; whatever lack of boundaries Sherlock may have with John, he knows that Sherlock has never been anything but responsible and deliberate in his care of Rosie.  But what about the days where Rosie is with Mrs. Hudson or Molly or the rare occasions John has gotten another sitter?  Does Sherlock use it as a stress relief when he can’t get an experiment to go right  Does he just sit back in his kitchen chair, push away from the microscope, and slide a hand down into his pajama bottoms?  Stroke himself to completion and let the bliss of it clear out his mind?  Maybe when he needs a break in a case; John can picture that being the most likely.  When Sherlock’s brain becomes a teaming hive of noise and threads of leads that won’t come together, John can imagine him stripping out of his clothing and throwing himself down in his chair, maybe draping one slender leg over the arm of it so that he can use a loose fist around his cock and long fingers inside himself ….
she says when John restarts the video for the third time; he gives a shaky laugh because it sounds for all the world like she knew he hadn’t been concentrating the first two repetitions.
They can hear the clerk whistling as he strolls to the car – a detail that has Sherlock staring after him with narrowed eyes – so John doesn’t trouble himself to lower his voice.
“Of course you’ll honor it,” Sherlock says, waving a hand as he begins to stalk around the sitting room.  “You always do.  That’s why I call you.”
o	July(ish) – Mary’s death (extrapolated from several-month montage of parenting); Rosie is approx. 7 months old
Also - I am insanely tempted to write the "other side" of the phone call with Mycroft and Lady Smallwood because I was insanely tickled by the scene in s4 where she gives him her personal number.  Writing a Mycroft sex scene would be a huge challenge for me but I think it would be super fun.  If you would be interested in reading that, let me know.
Sherlock hums around a forkful before shaking his head.  “No,” he says thoughtfully, “and that’s the curious part: I haven’t found
“Well, it isn’t as if we haven’t shared a bed before,” John says, gesturing to the bed.  He sits on the mattress and pats it in what he probably thought a casual gesture but seems horribly suggestive, all things considered.  “No reason we can’t be adult about this, right?”
Shrugging, John answers, “I don’t need a doctor who makes house calls.  I have a live-in detective.”
John kisses him briefly one more time, just because he can, before pulling back and saying, “That sounds like an excellent idea, Papa.”
“  Being a parent is about far more than just blood relation, Sherlock.  What about all the adoptive parents and step-parents and foster parents out there?  Thousands and thousands of people who love and care for children that they have no blood relation to.  They’re still parents, aren’t they?  Why should that make you any different?”
To Sherlock’s very great surprise, Rosie adores him.  Lulled by the rumble of his deep voice when unsettled, fascinated by his typical whirlwind of motion when Sherlock is energized, soothed by the plaintive strains of his violin … Rosie seems endlessly captivated no matter what Sherlock does with her.  He’d be loath to admit it in front of anyone save for John, but the ability to indulge in childlike play and silliness makes Sherlock feel light in a way that he’s never felt before, even when he was a child.  Not since before Redbeard.
“I have the same,” Sherlock flounders for a word and hates it, “needs as any other man.  It is a biological imperative; I meet the need when it needs to be met.”
The detective’s forehead wrinkles and he gives John a withering stare.  “I sleep nearly every night since you came back with Rosie.”
She gives a huff of laughter and they both cast their eyes down the hall after Sherlock’s retreating figure.  “Your friend, is he … a life partner?  Business partner?  Live-in babysitter?”
Sherlock shrugs.  “‘A lot’ is relative, John.  Once a week would be a lot for some men; not nearly enough for others.  At least once a day would be a lot for me but if the length of your morning showers are anything to go by when compared to showers taken at other times of day—”
John heaves the door shut behind him and leans on it for a second to recover his faculties.  The instant he does, though, he hears the low grunts of voice resume and a rather enthusiastic noise that makes John’s spine tingle.  He rockets down the stairs and resolves to take a cab to work to save time and damn the cost.  He’s just pulling up outside the clinic when he realizes he’s rock hard in his trousers.  It takes a good five minutes of sitting on a very cold bench outside the clinic before he feels collected enough to go inside without scandalizing anyone.
“I know that,” Sherlock assures him.  “It’s just not quite the right time yet.  As you said the night Rosie got burned: I will tell you, just not yet.”
“No!” she says vehemently.  The exasperation on her face makes him chuckle aloud; it’s the exact same expression Mary would give him when she thought he was being particularly dense about something.  “No, kiss.
Squinting through the darkness of the office at the clock on the wall, John says, “Come to think of it, I did tell the owner of the bed and breakfast that we’d be there by 11:30 at the latest.  We should leg it over there so we don’t keep her waiting too long.”
Sherlock stays quiet as John bangs around more than necessary for making tea.  John doesn’t know the answer to any of those ‘What If’ questions that ran through his head nor does he understand why suddenly the life-or-death daily reality of what they do suddenly seems terrifying as well as exciting, where it used to be simply exhilarating.  John just adds it to the pile of unanswered questions swirling around him since he came back here to stay.
to give Sherlock an eyeful of everything short of his cock, but as far as tests of interest are concerned, really John couldn’t have planned it better.  Halfway through the middle of his restless night of little sleep, it had occurred to John that perhaps he’d been going at this the wrong way.  Despite how (shockingly) considerate and generous Sherlock had been to John since they moved back to Baker Street, John knows that the chances of getting Sherlock to admit anything as ‘detrimental’ as romantic feelings – should they exist – would be about as likely as him writing a sonnet about Mycroft’s virtues or giving up experimenting on pieces of corpses.  In light of Sherlock’s explanations about his sexuality, however, John starts to wonder if maybe the way to get a clue as to what’s going on in Sherlock’s heart would be to get a definitive answer from his transport instead.  Maybe it’s arrogant of John to say so, but John is definitely the man that Sherlock is closest to – hadn’t he said so at John’s wedding? – so if he was going to feel that way about
“God, you’re such an arrogant arse.  I don’t even know why I put up with you,” John says it with heavy sarcasm, but the twinkle in Sherlock’s eye says he enjoys the banter as much as John is.  That and the way Sherlock’s grip tightens around John’s hand.
Sherlock shakes his head before John even finishes speaking.  “Never again, John.  Not if I can help it, of course.  I’m no good without you.  My conductor of light, remember?”
Sherlock is in Hell.  Unmitigated, unrelenting Hell.  If such a place actually existed, he’s positive that this would be it. Clearly the drugs and the yelling, the general disregard for people’s feelings and being generally Not Good over the years has earned him box seats in damnation for eternity because honestly, he can’t think of a worse fate for himself than this.  John is nude in the tub of their ensuite bath, less than ten feet away from where Sherlock is in his pajamas in the bed that he will have to
A low rumble of voice that could be his name hits John’s ears as he leans towards the door but Sherlock talks to himself when John’s not there all the time, so it doesn’t stop John from swinging the door open to ask his question again.  Once John takes a step into the room, the enquiry freezes on his lips and all his stunned brain can manage to put forth is that he’s not sure whether or not he wishes he hadn’t come in.  He barely even registers the feel of the doorknob in his hand as he clutches it for support, he just stares.  And stares.  And no matter how much he stares, he can’t seem to process what he’s seeing.
“—just until you calm down.  I will sit with her in that chair,” he motions to the rocker a few feet away in the corner, “just until you feel more settled and then I will give her back immediately.”
John turns his gaze even further away from Sherlock but nods.  “I was dreaming—anyway the noise upset Rosie.”
Sherlock tries to say the last part of it as casually as he can, hoping that Mycroft won’t latch onto that particular detail.
Sherlock brings his eyes to meet John’s; John feels routed to his chair as the realization sinks in.  How John remains upright in his chair as Sherlock’s eyes search his face is a complete mystery.  The warmth of his body radiating over John’s skin makes John realize that he must have stood up and closed the distance between them at some point but he honestly has no recollection of doing it.
“All right,” the doctor replies evenly.  “I’m not at the clinic tomorrow, so why don’t I stay here and take care of getting a sitter for Rosie and pack a few bags, and you can dart out to MI6 and get the details from Lady Smallwood.  Will that do?”
“No interest in sex with other people,”  Sherlock corrects.  “An incredibly important distinction, John.”
The doctor actually wrenches away from Sherlock, cradling his arms around Rosie as if he believes Sherlock is going to steal her and pitch her out the window.
John puts up two fingers at him, trying to cover his lingering surprise at Sherlock’s blithe declaration.  Sherlock gives him a thoroughly unrepentant grin as he bounds out of bed and scoops Rosie up.  The girl dissolves into hysterical giggles when Sherlock tosses her in the air, flapping her chubby arms and crying, “Again!  Again!”.
The plea is so plaintive that John has to rub at the ache beneath his breastbone.  “Tell me, Sherlock.  I have to know.  I
John rises from his chair and walks to the kitchen.  Standing in the door frame, he speaks without turning around.  “Please just … I know what we do is dangerous but for God’s sake—for
Sherlock clears his throat and gazes down at his lap.  “I’m not sure, actually.  Lady Smallwood actually gave me the case but she said she’d have to call me from her office tomorrow to give the details.”
“Another fifteen minutes or so,” he answers woodenly to Sherlock and then leans around the detective to gaze at his daughter.  Rosie reaches out with her right hand and whimpers, eyes filling as she leans towards John.
He looks up at the statue again, thinking of the panic on Sherlock’s face when John asked if there was a man whom he
John seems unable to stop rocking back and forth but his pats to Rosie’s back are distracted at best and the child is clearly aware that something is wrong, as she won’t stop howling.  Sherlock’s hands twitch towards her; John’s fingers clench at her back so Sherlock drops his arms.
writing a referral to Child Protection for a father that has scalding liquids within striking distance of his two-year-old.
“Should have known better,” Sherlock chortles then reaches out a fingertip to tap the end of Rosie’s nose.  “She’s a shameless nudist.”
He gives John a push for good measure and then follows him up to the Attic Room.  Three steps into the room, Sherlock scans it with his eyes.  Well, it is what it says on the tin: an attic converted into a bedroom.  Despite Sherlock’s anxiety at being forced to share it with John after the fiasco that has been his self-restraint today, he privately admits that it is decent enough and will likely be quite nice tomorrow morning when the sun comes in the high windows on either side of the space.  The bed is directly in front of them as they walk in – which catches John’s focus as he strides over and deposits his bag upon it – with the couch to the right and a desk tucked in under the window to the left.  Behind him stands a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf recessed into the wall, flanked by a door that is most likely the advertised ensuite loo.  Sherlock’s fingers skim over the books, cataloguing the titles in his mind, until he hears John clear his throat.  With glance over his shoulder, Sherlock sees the tension in John’s frame as John faces away from him, looking between the bed and the couch.  Sherlock can’t see the expression on the doctor’s face but the tightness of John’s voice speaks volumes.
His eyes had naturally gone to the flannel in question, stuck at one corner in the trail of hair leading down from John’s navel and beginning to float away with the current from Rosie’s splashes.   John clears his throat and the gentle noise of displaced water suggests that John has pressed a hand down to hold the cloth in place over his genitals.  Sherlock gulps.
Sherlock nods in return, shrugs as much as he can without loosening his grip on his calves.  “But it happens so rarely that it’s hardly worth speaking about.  If forced to put a label on it, I suppose ‘gay’ is as good as any because I’ve only ever felt …
“—by the sound of the clinking change in her handbag or something,” John continues with a rueful grin.  “So it’s just you and me then.  Any requests?”
A heavy exhalation leaves his lips.  Sherlock pulls his legs up from the floor and wraps his arms around them, curls into himself; he’s well aware of what the posture will read as but he feels safer this way.  He has to look away from John as he speaks so he studies the knees of his trousers.
“Understandable,” she says and gives him a smile far more chipper than an A&E staff around midnight would usually afford.  “Just introducing myself.  You didn’t miss much.”
Sherlock turns his face away towards the window but John catches the reflection of a small grin in the window glass.
Sherlock stares at the words “you are never alone” for an indeterminate amount of time.  In the back of his head he hears a loop of all of the voices that have spat the word “freak” at him over the years; this aspect of himself always just seemed to be one more way that perhaps the masses were right about him.  And yet, that tidy scrawl of four words in John’s tight handwriting – small, bold, and consistent; so much like the man himself – somehow dulls the roar.  The cascade of usernames and posts stands stark in his hand, a testament to John’s assertion: these people are like him; they feel what he feels; they understand.  And so, it seems, does John.  The piece of paper quivers in his grip and he isn’t aware that a single tear track snakes its way down his face until he feels small fingers on his hand.
His lips turn up and he tries to think of something sarcastic to say.  His brain abandons him, so he just gives a forced smile and nods.  “Fine, John.  I’ll be fine.  Don’t forget Rosie’s slicker; it’s going to rain before nightfall.”
John rolls his eyes.  “First of all, a man who faffs around crime scenes in Spencer Hart and a coat that costs more than a month’s rent wouldn’t choose socks simply because they were on sale, let alone something he was going to put up his bum.”
“Jesus Christ,” John mutters to the bar of soap in his hand.  “There’s no doubt about it: I’m in Hell.”
“John… John, I didn’t want to have to tell you this but I’m concerned about Rosie.  I believe that there is some cognitive problem that we hadn’t discovered before and, as her father, you should be aware of it.”
only Sherlock is, after hearing Mary).  John certainly doesn’t seem like a man in love.  Mary was wrong only slightly more often than Mycroft but, well, she has a blind spot in this particular instance.  So does Sherlock, which is why he resolutely refuses to allow himself any hope that Mary’s post-script might be true.
After a few minutes of silence, he realizes that John is not shaking any longer and Rosie’s eyelids flicker with all indications of dreaming during REM sleep.  Sherlock unfolds himself from the chair as gently as possible to avoid waking her and gestures towards John.
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mycroft says quietly, the note of pity in his voice nearly intolerable.  “Are you sure that’s wise, given how much you have to lose if this goes poorly?”
there was no canonical mention of his age; however, I recently came across a screengrab from the "Hat Man and Robin" article in Scandal in Belgravia, which lists him as "John Watson, 37", which means at the start of the series, he is 36 with a birthdate of March 31, 1974 (the March 31 birthday is ACD canon).
John scowls as well.  “Sherlock, we’re sitting here with a toddler that has a second-degree blistering burn on her neck at half past ten on a Tuesday night.  They’re going to think we’ve abused her.”
Naturally, he spends the next day writing up the case – which, much to Sherlock’s chagrin, he titles
John chuckles and the sound releases some of the tension in the detective’s chest.  John shuffles over to his chair and plonks himself down, crossing his socked feet in that odd, bent-inwards way he does when he’s content.
He opens his palm to drop the baggie to the floor, clutches the phone instead, focuses on breathing.  “Hurry.”
Sherlock strides away from the pair of them and snaps, “That makes me a babysitter, John, not a parent.  We shouldn’t
He swipes at the tear with the back of his hand and lifts Rosie from her chair, clutching the little girl to his chest and giving a watery chuckle when she taps his chin.
Sherlock hesitates a moment with a half-raised bow before he brings it to the strings and begins to play.  The tune winds around John in the air, beginning with an intense and foreboding sawing at the strings that leads into a bouncing, mercurial melody that seems eminently Sherlock.  If John closes his eyes and leans his head back against the chair, the tune speaks to him of midnight chases through the streets of London and laughs at crime scenes.  Yes, this is Sherlock, condensed into a single line of music.  But not only Sherlock … the line blends into something different, a haunting descant that is at once melancholy and sweet.  He gazes up to see Sherlock turned away from him, dragging the bow across the instrument in long, sweeping strokes, coaxing a strain of plaintive wails from the wooden body against his chin; John feels the notes in his bones.  And then it’s gone again, dancing away under notes that are sensual and lilting then foreboding, then unmistakably anguished … and then it twists and turns again and John finds himself not so much actively listening but letting the music wash over him.  Some of it he recognizes – he picks out a phrase of the song Sherlock wrote for the Woman, some of it are lines and strains that he’s heard Sherlock composing over the years – but though much of it is new, it feels … familiar.  John finds himself just watching Sherlock as he did that night of the gypsy tune; beads of sweat run down the center of his back as he breathes the music in and out, violin and musician moving together.  John thinks that this is not so much a song as it is a story without words.  He feels the story in bursts of emotions:  sorrow, fear, joy, menace, danger that roils in his belly, a hot punch of agonizing sorrow that rattles him to his bones, and then quiet.  Sherlock’s fingers pulse against the strings but it’s barely louder than a whisper.  John can’t help but think that the growing tension in the melodic line is fear … and hope; a tiny tremulous thing, but unmistakably hope.  John realizes he’s leaning forward in his chair as if chasing the anticipation in that strain beneath Sherlock’s fingers.  And then Sherlock stops abruptly, his arms dropping back to his sides.
He says it nonchalantly but Sherlock’s comment stops John stock-still in the middle of the room.  Maybe if he prods gently enough …. “Everyone?” he asks carefully.
Sherlock.”  God, how could he even think that?  And then another question hits him.  “You said this happened at the end?  That this was the last piece of the network, Serbia?”
John’s smile is easy but there’s just enough of a leading edge to his voice.  Alex smiles and nods as he hands the phone back.
