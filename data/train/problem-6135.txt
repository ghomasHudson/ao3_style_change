Tony was late. It's was 7h30 am, the sky was more blue than expected and Stark should been there 20 minutes ago. Steve was laid against his motorcicle in front of a small bakery. One of Tony's favorite. He was hoping to have his boyfriend company before the S.H.I.E.L.D. meeting. Now that's seemed something difficult to wish. He was up since 5 o'clock. That's was pretty normal to him. With the superserum it wasn't necessary long hours of sleep. He was able to run with Sam for hours without feeling tired. He did some exercises, took a shower and now was here. Waiting for Tony as he planned last night. The truth is that Steve was not even suprised. The brunette went to bed around 3 AM, working in another of his project. The captain tryed to bring Tony to their bed at least 3 times before fall asleep himself. He made a mental note to be more persuasive next time. Maybe use the gifts that the serum gave to him. Steve suspired and tryed to got more confortable on his bike, before check his watch the fifth time on the morning.
After the arena everything turned out to be a big blur. He only knew that his preparation team had arrested him. After having his skin rubbed for as long as they felt healthy, Steve felt relatively well. Again it was put on military style uniform of old times. Moss green contrasted with blond hair, extremely hydrated, combed to the side. He looked quite presentable. But not like yourself. In front of the mirror he saw the reflection of his mentor.
Peter murmured a 'thank you' before hesitating, as if he did not know how to raise another topic for the conversation.
The first day of training was intense. When he arrived at the training center, Steve was easily intimidated by the great careerists who spun and jumped like mortal assassins. Not that Rogers showed that. He needed to look like he knew what he was doing. District 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 tributes were the oldest.  All over 22 years. The others were just kids. He decided not to think about it now.
- Actually we don't. - But now he was smiling anyway. Tony knew that he won, what it's was in most of times a bad thing to happen.
"I can manipulate knives". The blonde has chosen to follow this path. "I usually hunt", Nick was not surprised as expected, but it took a moment before he spoke again.
- This was from last week? - The blond head just nodded. - It's amazing. My hair is on point - Rogers laughed. - No, serious, it's incredible, Steve. - Tony couldn't believe that was how Captain seems him. The way that he captured the shine of the metal or of his eyes was breathtaking.
Tears began to stream down his face. Steve didn’t bother wiping them from his face. It would be pointless. Instead he took a seat in front of the headstone and stared at the name in front of him. He sniffed and wiped his cheeks for a moment before his fingers slowly began to trace the
He walks out of the graveyard, promising himself that he would return tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after…
A month later, the whole graveyard is covered with flowers and gifts from little children. There’s a banner placed over the gate that read:
“The best of us all,” he said quietly, his eyes blurry. “Earth’s best defender. Billionaire, brash, brilliant – hero. They will always remember you as a hero, Tony…”
“It all happened so fast, Steve. One minute we were losing – or at least I thought we were surely going to – and the next… they were all gone. Dust in the wind. I was shocked and relieved. Until…”
Sam swallows and says, “I – I shouldn’t be the one to tell you this. I’ll get someone else in here. Just hang tight, Cap.”
“You’ve been unconscious for about seven months now. It was a big blow to the head. That doctor, you know, the one with the magic, somehow saved you. He lessened the blow before we got you in here. What else do you remember?”
Steve stares at the little kid who’s not even tall enough to each his knees. He just paid for a batch of pink roses at
“He’s dead,” he said bluntly. “He went toe-to-toe with Thanos, took the Stones, and killed all of them. Snapped them away like he snapped us. The Stones… they nearly burned half his body and we buried what was left. He died a hero, just like he always wanted – Cap!”
“I’m so sorry, Tony. I never should have left. I should have stayed. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m sorry, Tony. I’m so sorry, please forgive me.”
Bucky doesn’t meet his eyes. He looks away and mutters something under his breath, as though he was trying to convince himself of something. He stands up, looks around the room, and heads for the door. Just before his hand reaches the handle, he pauses and tilts his head towards Steve.
Sam rubs his hands together and takes a seat next to him. The only sound in the room was the heart monitor’s steady beeps.
His voice was distant, as though it wasn’t part of him or part of the earth. Maybe Tony could hear him and maybe they were somehow still connected due to some divine intervention he could never begin to explain. Maybe… maybe their souls were crying out for each other. There were a lot of maybes running through his mind. The only thing that was for sure was that Tony laid fifty feet under him and Steve wanted to be with him.
She noods with desire and every part of Steve feels victorious, as if he had won a war, feels a strange warmth in his chest that ignores and instead smiles and gets up to kiss her.
She is looking him in the eyes again in search of something that does not exist, because Steve does not understand or know exactly what she wants from him.
Steve touches her, his hands up the gray skirt following the path of her tights almost as soft as her silk robes until he finds the garters that hold them in place, it's almost as if Tony had prepared for this, it's so damn sexy that Steve can barely wait to put his lips there, he touches and she gives in, she allows it.
He moves almost as fast as he has been doing before and falls to his knees in front of her, touches her, it's real, she's here, she's fine.
-What do you want from my Steve? - It's almost a scream, she stops, lowers the volume of her voice as if trying to calm down. - Did you want me? There I were for you, what you will need there Iwas. Did you want space? I gave it to you, I gave you so much space that I almost left the team so you could breathe without feeling pressured.
Iron Man can even fly without using his wings, in fact the wings of Iron Man like everything in his body are covered with metal, his wings were not so big and even so Steve loved to see when Iron Man allowed himself to extend them, maybe Iron Man would have noticed it or maybe Iron Man did it without realizing it, showing up for Steve and making Steve feel completely disoriented and full of desires to take the hand of Iron Man, go out the nearest window to fly together and leave well in clear how much Steve admires him and wants to join him, to create a bond.
It is really incredible how suddenly everything is fixed and how suddenly she fits so well in his routine, sometimes they have lunch together, sometimes they meet to watch a movie on the big TV in the mansion, more times they find a place or a moment in which they will take the hand (or arm) of the other and will enter the first room with some furniture available to find better ways to be used.
She is everywhere as if she knew where to play so Steve would lose control, as if she was openly looking for just that.
Steve sighs and for a moment he allows himself to enjoy this, the camaraderie that they had lost, but she quickly hides behind the fissure that had been opened and leaves him outside, Steve can only see her go a little further in her old and entrenched customs .
Tony moves between his arms, her hips rolling and twisting making him moan for how good it feels, while his fingers move a little faster, she returns to intact getting to him, twisting a little awkwardly and Steve headquarters, approaching her torso behind her, causing a shudder, while he kisses her, it is hardly a kiss with the position they have.
Then it happens, it is his universe and the brilliant happiness spreads everywhere, it is perfect and he is so happy that he can't wait to see the team, to see Steve for the first time in all those years.
That time does not even spend more than two hours in that universe, because no matter how masochistic he is, it is too painful to see what could have been, but never will be.
His fingers begin to touch her seriously on the soft cloth, moving in circles, squeezing a little more just as Tony likes, she shivers and for a moment tries to release her hands from Steve's grip.
He stops, looks at her and for once, Tony seems to see through him as if she knew what is going on inside his head.
Then he fails when he hears her say - goodbye Steve- along with the pounding of Tony's shoes, he only stops when she is no longer there, and turns to see the path she has made to the exit as if he could still see her.
He had started to stockpile bottles of Iron Man's favorite soda on his shelves, but that was not uncommon, after all it was the only thing that Iron Man consumed when he was in team meetings or at any time of connection with the team.
But what confirmed it completely was when Iron Man was hit by the villain on duty during one of their fights, Steve could feel the blow completely on his ribcage as if he had been hit himself, even a bruise was as strong proof of their bond.
Iron Man was completely different from his employer, vivacious, fun and the best friend that Steve had in all this new world, everything about him is incredible, the costume is something that even in the most incredible science fiction stories that Steve had read not even existed, it was not something that even he with a great imagination could have created, it is simply engineering carried to the highest level.
He takes the first mission that Fury gives him, go and come back with a successful load of smugglers of little importance, ready to return to his routine.
Awakening was a surprise, although it was not the first time that Tony had seen the end and still had returned.
Steve feels disgust and hate himself because he should be the one who comforts her, the one who takes care of her, just a few hours ago she was in the hospital, she had been so weak, she could still feel weak and Steve is here, like a little boy, who need comfort.
Upon returning from a mission, he listens to Triskelion agents talk about her, there are not pretty things, Steve is contained, none of that matters, until one of them is proclaimed as the one who has left the marks she looks in recent days , the ones that Steve himself left on her skin and simply can not let it pass, in a boot Steve hits him, it is a somewhat soft blow, but that still leads the agent to fall to the ground unconscious, the other agents shut up and They look surprised while he leave the room to change for his civilian clothes without caring in the least what Fury has to say when he returns or even if this whole thing will bring him problems.
During the meetings they always sat close to each other, but it was normal, they are the team leaders after all.
Everything is white noise and a tide in which he only navigates on autopilot, there is a question that comes out of his mouth as he start his way to the door - what hospital? -
Steve just looks away from her to concentrate, breaks her panties to reach his destination, his tongue touches every sensitive point he can reach while Tony's fingers twist over his hair, her heart stutters fast and her lips barely let out. some incoherent words, showing him exactly how she like it.
And every part of Steve vibrates under her hands, as if something had broken inside his mind, he has all this need to tear its firmer edges, the need to protect her, to make her forget the bad, to make her happy.
Run, hit the box bag again, lift weights until the old gym manager says: - It's time to go home son.-
Tony makes adjustments to his own armor, makes changes so that the system works again and does not need the help of any other person if he arrives at another universe that is not his, in order to calibrate and open another portal, he doesn't leave that nobody touches anything of his things, least of all the younger Tony who looks at him with so much interest, because he does not want Tony to get to where he is, he does not want his future for this Tony.
They stay in that position for a few moments, Tony touches his hair and Steve stands still, listening to her heartbeat, as it slows down until it is a normal cadence and knows that it is time to go, kiss the place between his breasts before move away.
Every part of him has renewed energy, leaves the motorcycle, knocks on the door and the new Jarvis receives him with a smile and a greeting that Steve simply puts aside with the man, Steve does not wait for Jarvis to take him to her, not even matters that she has never really taken him to her room in all this damn time.
Details that Steve found a little later in the newspapers, where he also found a picture of how his wings would look like, with reddish brown tones and yellow at the tips, were a beautiful wings that almost reached the calf but it went very well with Stark.
Steve is approaching her at a slow pace, she also does not speak, just pour another drink again and this time she does not take it at once, just take a sip.
These are crazy ideas, these are ideas that should not be in Steve's head, since Iron Man has made it clear that he can not create a deepest bond, his secret identity is important and Steve respects him, even when every part of him vibrates because Iron Man let him in.
Fury says nothing about the incident, there is no red card for him or even a wake-up call, it's almost as if nothing had happened.
It is magnetic and Steve kisses her lips, her neck and every part that is within her reach with that strange taste that can only be the viscous green thing of the armor, as they move, she touches him, it is a touch silenced by the suit but which makes him wish he had at least taken off the top, so he could feel her touching his skin at least for once.
She is everything he never thought he wanted or desire in a person, in fact he didn't even consider her waking up in this century, she was simply a teammate.
Steve's blood is boiling, every part of his body is tense and ready to break bones, he doesn't realize what he is doing until everyone is watching him.
If he concentrates, he can even hear Tony's breath, which to his surprise stays silent, she has not even moved, there is no typical Tony behavior, no teasing, no assertive comments, no insistence she always has to when addressing an issue that is important, she is only there, behind him, looking at him as if she were waiting for him to discuss all this.
Steve can't stand whatever she thinks of him or the place he has decided to go to instead of Triskelion's well-stocked gym or even the one in the Stark mansion, so he just goes around it straight to the lockers .
He kissed her as if she had every little answer written in the world and the only way to know the same conception of the world was between her lips with that persistent Whiskey flavor.
She even opens her legs in an invitation to touch her more and Steve does, his hands have become skilled experts in how she likes to be touched, one plays with the league, while the fingers of his other hand touch slowly on her panties.
Tony's legs get tangled up in Steve's hips and everything is just rampant, Tony moves a little, lowering Steve's closure and releasing his dick, there's a denial somewhere with a red spotlight that lights up in the Steve's mind, a warning to stop, walk away and not compromise their relationship in this way, but Steve's only response is to put Tony's red panties aside and ram her.
Although there is a universe where he falls and everything is like a dream come true, an utopia that plays with him and makes him hate not have been the lucky one to win the lottery in this vast multiverse, which makes him dream that if maybe he had been a better man and he would not have betrayed Steve maybe he would have this, a house to return after work with a husband who would give him a spectacular welcoming smile and a team behind him, maybe he would not have to count the days until the next catastrophe knocks on their door to choose the best option other than to betray Steve, maybe they wouldn't be destroyed, maybe they could have been happy.
The years pass and it's been so long that Tony loses hope, he doesn't even understand why he keeps trying, when in the end he always ends up in another universe that doesn't belong to him and still, he keeps doing it, running through the portal to the next universe, discarding statistics and creating new conjectures that can help him to be closer.
They become friends again, they have strange comments between them, they become teammates again and they even become a better complement for the team, more synchronized, more efficient and hit bad guys hard.
She is sitting on the edge of her bed, with the sheets aside as if she was just getting up, she smiles at him with -Hello Darling- that just comes out gives him the strength to finally move.
Tony freezes by letting Thor go, who looks at them as if he was willing to take her in his arms and fly with her from the place, if Steve makes a false move, but Tony just nods.
"It's just an adventure, a one-time thing" he said as the only argument, it is something that will not be repeated because they are teammates, they are friends and Tony will move on to his next conquest before even Steve has the opportunity to rethink this whole thing and invite her on a date (or allow himself to simply fall for her).
Steve can only kiss her, because there is nothing he can say about that and he knows how fucked up it is for someone to say nonsense in an attempt to comfort you for something that cannot be changed.
Steve tries again and tries to convince him that he doesn’t care how he looks underneath the suit or what doesn’t allow Iron Man to show up to the others on the team, anything matter just them.
Days pass or maybe a week, Tony is not sure about the passage of time, and there is only the certainty that nobody will come and the resolution makes him get up and go in search of things that could help him not only to fix the armor, but also to help him get back to home.
Steve does not know Tony Stark very well, for he is just the man who opened his house for a unique group of people and also allows them to have his bodyguard with them without asking for anything in return.
- I'll catch up with you later - says Tony, recovering the joviality she had at the beginning of the meeting, Thor looks at them a few moments before agreeing.
They were completely different, Steve was rooted in a world that had advanced without him, with old customs being his main engine and one of the most important pillars that governed him.
Tony wait, although it had never been good waiting, he did, surely Steve would be on Reed looking for a way to take him home, it's stupid but there is Tony healing his wounds, trying to fix the armor as best he can with what he has and trying to think about what brought him to this place so he could make his way back.
But when someone finally got through the shell that existed around her, that person became her world, Steve has seen how it happens, Natasha Romanov did it, under Antonia's defenses, she came under her skin and Tony lost the damn head for her.
He avoid staying more than a few hours in those universes where Steve exists, because it seems that if there is a Steve and a Tony they will always be magnets attracting each other and He certainly do not want to think too much about the implications of that.
Steve can't stop, he has to touch her and he does it, he’s hesitant, waiting for her to throw him, he runs the fingers of one of his hands through her little hair, slowly, carefully, just to be a little massage, that Tony Accept, leaving the glass and recharging on the table.
One of his hands stays there helping his tongue to give her pleasure, while his other hand stays on one of his thighs as if he were looking for the stability he needs to speak.
They argued, they didn't always do it, but she had been about to compromise the mission because she wasn't sober enough to efficiently conduct the armor, he tried to make her come to reason, He really tried to talk to her, although it's not as if he understood the slightest thing of the women of this era, she touches each of Steve's red buttons, it is a tug of war that according to who looks at it will end completely badly.
The suit begins to retract, it's automatic, every little fiber of Steve is vibrating with emotion as he watches as the pieces of the armor fly off, until he starts to see skin and then the wings go along with the suit, leaving Steve paralyzed, he does not stop looking at how the scars are revealed and how suddenly there is nothing stopping him from looking completely at the man who has been hiding under the suit.
"You do not have to tell me your identity or show me ... " Steve tries once more time "just give us a chance".
Days go by and Tony stays off his radar, they have no missions together, there are no more agents talking about her, it's almost as if she only existed in the magazines and in the interviews she attends to show new inventions or talk about the Ultimates, as if she was just an untouchable television star.
The kiss scales quickly, most likely because of Steve's fault that he lets every word he is unable to say be silenced on Tony's lips.
In fact Tony seems to have taken it as a challenge, to see how much he endures until it drives him crazy, because damn Tony seems to like playing with him.
He's tired, he's so jaded of everything that the simple thought of that behind this portal is his universe, his right time with all that he has missed, with his home ready to receive him, makes every little piece of him vibrate in emotion and a terror that melts inside the pit of his stomach, he's ready to go back, to see Steve and say "yes" to him once again, so it takes all his strength and courage to step inside the portal.
Steve stays several moments without a single movement, accommodates his clothes, thinks about what happened and feels how each part of him plays with his mind, this is not something he was looking for, it is not even something he wanted, this is something that neither It should have even happened.
She tries to look at him over her shoulder without much success, but he stands firm on her back, even joins her hands so that he can hold her like this with one hand, while the other runs up, touching her ribs to her breast and feels as her nipples harden under her hand, because of course with this damn dress Tony is not wearing anything  underneath, Tony squirms with a barely audible “Yes” under the moan that escapes from between her lips as his fingers play with her nipple and his mouth does not stop in search for the most sensitive points on her back.
And what started being something a little slower, that was meant to make her beg, ends up being fast, they both move to satisfy the desire for completion, she gasps and Steve takes her hips, touches her bare back with one of her hands, touching the reddish spots on her skin, he touches her and sees her twist a little to see him, with her red lips parted trying to hide her moans and her half-open eyes with the makeup slightly drawn.
I was so obsessed with this since I read Infinite loop, it all started with a little phrase and then a sketch and then a page and then I started writing some fun facts / a kind of script as I always do with all my drawings, but then I have something that can be Consider a Fic / story and I decided to share this mess too, I am not a writer and maybe I have many mistakes, so I just want to apologize and I really hope that this mess can be understandable.
So is Steve, drowning looking to take more and more, trying to catch her there with him, as if he will still wait for her to fade, if he leaves her.
Even when he first met Stark, he had not been able to avoid looking at the man for too long, until Stark himself smiled at him and said "I lost them" with subtlety, almost as if it did not matter even when his eyes said something completely different. Stark discarded the subject without going into details.
-What do you want Stark? - he says sullenly, without much desire to apologize for hitting the agent.
And she must have discovered that thing is one of Steve's biggest weaknesses, because she has been wearing these damn dresses that seem demure, because they don't have a neckline that shows her breasts, but instead they have such a pronounced neckline on the back that they just stop to show no further than Tony's lower back.
Nobody moves, as if Steve were a threat, almost as if they were waiting for Steve to become  Hulk, he will begin to break the whole enclosure and even eat the head of one of the members.
-Excellent talk honey, we have to repeat it again one day- she says and walks away with a small movement of hips, as if all this was something completely normal that happens every day between them.
He runs straight to where he left his motorcycle, run so fast that he almost collide with some agents while trying to get out, get on the motorcycle and start without waiting for someone to think of stopping him.
Maybe she got over him and found someone else to play with, maybe they just have to talk or maybe he should apologize, he will do it the next time.
Loot every little gram of good sense from his mind, kiss her as if it were the first time, as if he wanted to explore every little corner that her mouth allows him to have, she takes control of everything, touches him on every part she can reach and before that he even has an idea, she already has his erection between her skilful fingers, making him groan.
He accepts it because he is not sure where he is treading with Tony or even if his friendship could survive after all the mess they have created around their relationship.
Steve knows it better than anyone, he almost feels he took advantage of the vulnerable moment the first time they ended up together in the conference room.
And Steve doesn't want to let her go, but he forces himself to do it, he forces himself to get away from her, he forces himself to take off his combat boots and his dirty clothes, while she takes off her robe, climbs back up and accommodates leaving a space for him .
He lets her feel how hard he is against the curve of her butt and kisses every part that is within reach, breathes her perfume and she whispers his name in a plea, which he ignores as she has ignored how much it bothers Steve that she wear this type of clothing, which reveals more than it should be right and that makes every damn man in the room look at her with desire, while Steve just wants to stamp each of them against the nearest wall.
But they are the Ultimates, he's the captain of America, he's Steve Rogers and it seems that the best thing he can do is complicate things further.
And even with everything he has agreed with himself, even with all the time he has said that he has accepted what he has, the man under the cape simply has a thorn that cannot be removed, chasing every one of his thoughts, is simply that feeling before the serum, yearning for a life that has been denied, Steve begins to want more.
The pain in his limbs was not new, but the place where he was lying it was, there was nothing he could recognize.
-You have to talk to me, you have to tell me ... I can't keep doing this- it's a plea that dies in a murmur and Steve wants nothing more than to give her what she wants, every little wish in her blue eyes, but he can't, because he doesn't know how to do it and he doesn't know if what he wants is something he is available to take.
She breaks the kiss and Steve just can't stop, follows a path down her neck, while she whispers things that make him get even more excited, she has such a dirty mouth, Steve's fingers awkwardly undo the white shirt, flying some buttons on the process of reaching its destination, lower the cup of her bra to access her bust, touch it, his fingers play with her nipple while his mouth is busy leaving a mark on her collarbone, she bites the lobe of his ear, he loses control and wants it, he needs it, he just whispers "please" in a plea.
"I really can’t give you what you want Steve" says the distorted voice of Iron Man, so low it looks more like a strange squeak.
Tony see happier places, places where all the heroes have a lot of fun when they are fighting with a villain or even once he go to one where there were no heroes, but still there is a Tony Stark who made weapons for the government.
But the first time he fell fully into Tony's charms that was the moment when everything inside Steve was doomed.
Then there is another great cataclysm that leads Tony and Steve to a fight between them where they can not solve anything together, there is a fight between them that Tony already expected to come, so even they manage to make things work, they create a plan that will save them all, everything is fine, until things get screwed and everything starts a decline that forces Tony to act, takes all the pieces, lies and betrays, he doesn't know what will happen exactly with him, but it doesn't matter, because the world (Steve ) has always imported more than Tony.
He hates not being able to see her face, because he loves to see Tony's expressions when they are this way, because for a moment all her masks and insinuations fall off and she shows the real Tony, full of desires and expectations that maybe will never be filled, but even with everything there is hope and warmth, there is always warmth in her eyes when she looks at him, but he knows that the moment he lets her go, she will take control of the encounter and drive him crazy.
They don't talk about any of that, in fact it seems that all that event only happened in a crazy Steve´s fantasy, as if they just didn't think of the other one that way.
"It is a quick mission" they tell him, but the mission is extended to about four days, it is not too much, but for once the mission time becomes eternal, he just wants to return to his routine.
It felt good, it felt right to stand there in front of Iron Man without the hood to hide his face, telling him, showing him and making promises, thinking about the future, talking about them.
Tony's hands instead go down looking under the suit, she pulls his shirt off his belt and touches his abdomen, she seems to doubt for a moment, it's just an instant when she stays still even separating her lips from Steve's, but there is no time to question why because Tony licks her lips and Steve opens for her to take control of the kiss, while her hands keep going until she already has the shirt of the suit halfway to his body, her skilful fingers make his shiver arousal, touches his nipples and he can only move his hips looking to rub with something to ease his erection.
He starts rocking his hips against her, partly for his own relief and partly to distract her, he puts aside the pantiesand her fingers sneak in playing now with the edge of her entrance, it's barely soft, she moves in an attempt to take his fingers inside, looking for more friction.
He touches her because he wants to be sure that she is really there, because he is suspicious and afraid she is a lie and that all this is not real.
-I need a drink- she speaks with the voice that she's done with everything, goes straight to one of the shelves where she has a small reserve of her favorites drinks, serves a brandy and drinks without even hesitating.
-I'm fine- he barely speaks between his lips, because he doesn't know what to expect from all this and the anger is still latent.
Tony doesn't talk about the whole damn thing, but everyone on the team knows how much it affected her.
Watch as she stays a few more moments on the table and then also gets up, starting to accommodate her clothes.
The universes in which he spends more time are those where there are catastrophes, he tries to help and some of the heroes in that universe accept him with open arms, others not so much, although he does not stay stuck for a long time, because at the end of the day he always remember that he has to go home.
And then all the pieces are connected, Steve just runs out of breath, there looking at him, it's not what he expected, it's not something he was prepared for, but still everything makes sense and Steve wants to be beaten for not having seen it before.
He is selfish and is being a fool, but for once in all these years he wants to cheat, so when the time comes and Reed and Tony have the portal ready, it does not stop, he talks about the whole thing for the first time since he arrived , tells young Tony the words he hopes will help him not to end up just right here, in the other side, an old man looking for his way to home. He wants to believe that Tony will say "no" when the time comes and his relationship with Steve will never turn into a vicious and painful cycle, the best lie tell to himself, look at the fluctuation in the portal, breathe and hope shines in his chest, it's something he has not fallen in a long time.
-That has never stopped you… - try again to touch her, but that answer seems to be the wrong one because she pushes him.
It is the first time since they started all this in which there is no crudeness or even frenetism in the kiss, it's as if they were making the agreement, it is a kiss from those who are made to take their time and enjoy the other person.
There is discomfort, nervousness in every little movement, but still security, she stays silent for a moment.
- Are you serious? - Tony's formal facade is broken for a moment and Steve just crosses his arms. -Of course you are serious- she says wryly and sighs. -I haven't done anything other than what you want, honey.-
She doesn't take anything seriously, he can't help trying to live in a rigorous routine just broken by missions or by villains who don't have time to write their plans on Steve's well-structured calendar.
He continues to give only a few kisses on the line of her shoulder while his hips remain still and the fingers of his hands barely make a slow brush on her clitoris, something as faint and completely different from how Tony likes these meetings between them, on the other hand, Steve is too fond of having her in his arms with her body buzzing in need and all her barriers thrown to the ground.
He fly through the city until Iron Man stops him, it's an old armor and it could be Rhodey underneath, but it doesn't matter, because he's so happy, he's home, finally, after all this time he's home
-You know that none of that matters, don't you? - she says while touching his arm and Steve just clenches his fists in response, she sighs again, looks tired but still raises her face towards him, looks at him as if looking to decipher what that even he has not been able to decipher in his thoughts.
Steve does not approach the Stark mansion (which is now the headquarters of the Ultimates) until Janet cornered him after a mission to catch the remaining members of the Liberators.
He kissed her, because he needs her even more than he needs to breathe, like a man in the desert looking for water, that when he finds it, he almost drowns with it.
Steve's patience is running out, in fact he feels exhausted and tired of her ignoring him, catches her eyes on him is only a second but it feels like hope.
He drops to his knees in front of her who looks at him breathlessly, with the excitement dancing in her gaze, he gives a few kisses to her legs covered by the soft fabric of her tights and goes up slowly making her bite her lip, reaches her skin and she feels even better than her idyllic memory could protect, perhaps marred by the speed of their encounters, he leaves a kissing path on her thighs and she shudders touching his hair with her fingers.
-You're fine- she repeats it as if she did not believe him but still accepted it, she walks towards him with her high heels tapping the dirty floor of the gym and Steve tenses even more even waiting for the explosion that does not arrive.
It is his wings that confirm what Janet had noticed before him, trying to play and touch the wings of Iron Man, even when he does not receive an answer, but he continues to leave some feathers in between the openings of the suit and even with that Iron Man never mentions anything.
There is silence, followed by something like a strange squeak that Steve's experience is a sigh and that only makes each part of Steve fill with hope and another try to be a little more realistic preparing to be thrown out of Mr. Stark's workshop.
That is why he has sitting at the table with the other members, on the other side of Tony, who does not even look at him or talk or do anything other than look at Janet and give a few points of view as to the strategy, she has a black business suit that fits well in every curve of her body and she is drinking the fourth glass of bourbon when they finish, she does not say goodbye, doesn't flirt, she simply leaves the room.
There are too many damn complications in their lives to even allow himself to consider completely that maybe he want to belong to the eccentric woman who looks at him with a tone of fun, desire and maybe a little need while finishing her third martini.
He does not really notice how much it affects him or causes him until they are hidden in one of the rooms in one of the galas he has been forced to attend.
Steve plays with the edge of the tiny lace panties Tony is wearing now and Tony can only say "please" in a small tone of supplication as if suddenly all the dirty and intelligent words that always come out of her lips had simply been forgotten or she just couldn't remember any to encourage him to stop playing and finally give her what she really wants, but Steve wants it to last and for once he wants to be the one who drives her crazy.
They only get back together until a month later in another meeting, this time she returns to her usual state, speaking almost as much as Janet or Wanda, making interesting comments and even flirting.
-Are you okay Steve? - Janet is the one who speaks, looking at him with concern and Steve can only nod as he slowly drops the table.
She moves away to be able to look at him and Steve enjoys seeing how beautiful she looks right now, near him, in his arms, with his appetizing lips of a reddish tone that encourage him to continue kissing her, but Tony's eyes stop him.
Steve's body is burning by letting go of her hands, taking off his clothes and letting her touch him everywhere, kissing him, but instead concentrating on making her moan and shudder in his arms.
-So ... - she starts moving one of her hands -What can I help Captain Rogers? - she says suddenly becoming the business woman Steve has glimpsed a few times, even formally speaking to him, something that since They knew each other had not done.
In response to the attack, Steve's fingers push aside her panties and touch her seriously, circling her clit, it is slow, just a preamble of what will come next, she moves her hips rubbing a little more and Steve just wants to make her feel good.
She tells him that he has obligations to the team and that interpersonal relationships should not get in the way of team dynamics. Steve doesn't know if she is talking about his relationship with Tony or with Janet herself, only know that maybe she is right and he should at least return to the team's weekly meetings.
Tony runs her hands down each side of his neck, plays with the hair at the base of his neck and the only certainty in Steve is that he wants her back in his routine.
He close his eyes and start moving slowly, just in a cadence that feels good but only increases the need.
The search for touch is not only a desire for his wings, his hands play an important role even when Iron Man can not feel anything, but there is Steve putting his hands on his shoulder, on the forearm or even once (or maybe twice) in the Iron Man's waist, he wants to feel close to Iron Man.
-You have me- escapes from Tony's lips along with a groan and Steve can only feel like a warmth runs through his body, intoxicating, beating his excitement and for a moment he knows that the feeling that fills him is happiness , but he wants more and she asked for sincerity, so the selfish vein wins and wants more, wants everything.
-Captain Rogers have a moment? - He is interrupted by a young agent who looks at him a few moments and then looks down at her tablet.
He tries again and again, with time passing, becomes a routine, find someone who can help him to calibrate the device that opens portals that is already embedded to the rib cage of the armor and enters another universe.
Upon entering he is received by various prying eyes and whispers that are not supposed to reach his ears, the whole damn complex knows it.
-Captain I must inform you of a certain event that happened in your absence- there is a pause - One of the members of the Ultimate team has been in the hospital in the last three days-
He tangles his legs on Steve's hip and drops backwards, scattered across the table, with her shirt half undone, bust outside the bra, her lips, her shoulders with reddened marks,  Steve sees what he has done, what it causes in her, she is brazen, she is playful, she is ... she is beautiful and Steve wants to have her like this forever.
Tony leaves the mansion the next day, goes straight to the Baxter building and locks himself in the lab with Reed, Reed is always good, not only helps him find answers because Reed never eludes a challenge, he never ask questions, he doesn't make insubstantial talks, he doesn't force him to talk, concentrates completely on the problem in front of them and makes very good advances, until they get stuck, they are just tired, Reed offers him a guest room and Tony doesn't deny it, because he prefers stay here than go to the mansion.
And it is his universe, he is more than sure of it, because he can see all his feelings inside this younger Tony, who is more foolish, more naive and more optimistic, but above all this Tony can not look away from Steve when he is in the room and he really doesn't want to think about this Steve who doesn't stop looking at him as if he is trying to find all the similarities between him and the younger Tony, Tony avoiding look at them to much because he knows what awaits them and also hurts not being able to go and touch Steve, touch every single part of him so the feeling that they are together again will be satiated and he can continue working.
It is the kind of man who remains as a private person, even if when he's the CEO of a company like Stark Industries and most of his life is in the public spotlight. He always seems to know how to stay on the sidelines, although Steve can fully understand, with curious  looks and the scrutiny he receives daily or at least has been since Steve come back from the ice.
And it's laughable how they look at each other as if they knew every single part of each other, the brightest part and the worst part before entering this endless cycle, although Tony knows the truth, he knows they have not arrived yet to the best part of their relationship, much less to the worst part where they tear and for a moment he would like to think that if he says something, the things will be different for them, but still he keeps quiet and avoids them, more to Steve that Tony, even when Steve corners him one dawn with a "harmless" chocolate cup and a pretty smile that hides a questioning underneath, Tony knows that smile too well to know how to avoid it, but Steve's eyes look at him with so much confidence, with a feeling so pure that it's been too long since his own Steve looked at him like that and Tony wants to keep Steve forever looking at him like that, but he's not deluded, it's not the Tony who once thought that their relationship will be forever, that could make Steve happy, he knows better, has seen countless universes in which they are together and still always find a way to fuck everything and not be happy, so it encloses any feeling, so he only says "Thank you" and turns his back, leaving Steve alone.
And even so, he has been going crazy all night damn, with her gloating with each functionary and important person at the gala, where several dare to touch her bare skin, there are small touches that do not go unnoticed by Steve, who is now trying to proclaim every small space that was touched and desecrated with his mouth, in an attempt to mark every point on her body with a statement that Steve was there and every piece of skin has already been conquered by him.
He touches every little space in her body trying to feel satiated, touching her as if it were the first time, as if he hadn't made that same journey in an attempt to memorize the way her body feels under his silk robes, the softness of her skin compared to the calluses of his fingers, clearing every scar and bruise that was ever made and faded over time.
Steve feels time is running very slowly, while he is trying to get to the mansion as fast as he can, he feels angry because he was not there for her, she fainted in the bathroom of his own mansion and nobody noticed until hours later, hours, not instantly, not seconds, not even minutes… fucking hours, he wants to hit everyone because she could die next to the toilet and nobody cares in the least.
"what I'm hearing is you want to fix your bike for free, so you broke into someone's garage. a total stranger's, by the way. god, didn't you ever learn manners in school? even once?"
the sputtering of his bike turned to a defiance, but steve was puzzled -- she had never had such an attitude with him before. the two of them felt like family; everywhere steve went, the bike went, too. loud enough to drown out thoughts, and fast enough to get him away. and if that meant he was running away from his problems, then so be it.
by now, tony has brought three crates over and dropped them on the wooden table steve was sitting at. "the stator is the part that needs a little TLC, because that flow generates heat and eventually breaks down the assembly. vibration and oil help break those
tony could hear him smiling through his words. as he moved to lay on his back, settling himself on the floor, the moonlight came in through the large window behind the couch, illuminating the other. for just one second, it felt like steve was meant to be seen in the shining glow of the moon.
peeking into the small, thin windows, steve was mostly met with darkness, but what he could see was shiny metal and unlit lanterns that hung from the ceiling. welding equipment was scattered across a large, rectangular table, and what looked like a tire iron propped against the leg. that was all he could spot, but steve figured if it looked like an auto garage, it must be an auto garage.
as steve got comfortable once again, he turned his entire body to face outward, keeping his pillow against himself as he closed his eyes. tony could only look up at him as he unraveled his arm from the hug he was giving himself and draped it down the front of the couch, gently reaching out his fingers.
the thing was the size of a man. a suit seemingly made of tin cans and aluminum foil, at least that's what it looked like. it looked like something steve had seen in a comic book when he was a kid, the kind he used to ask his ma for when they could scrape together a couple extra bucks. the kind that were exciting and fascinating, but nothing he was particularly thrilled by. the suit had been spray-painted a deep, dark red, with golden eyes and accents. but the thing practically begged to fall apart just from squaring up with it, squeaking as it steadied against the wall.
"he's a busy guy," tony paused, taking a quick, albeit dramatic, drink from his glass. he poured the rest down the sink drain and left it sitting on the counter as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, striding toward the hallway that led to his bedroom. "well, I'm beat. wake up call is at 6am, we'll head back to the shop after I get some coffee in me, and we'll say sayonara."
but, like a miracle, through his squinted eyes and the sweat that dripped down his nose, steve could see a garage. a tin can of a garage, but a garage. as he got closer, it didn’t look much better than the previous "buildings", if he could call them that. there was a big, hunkering sign that hung loosely from rusted chains that read
they didn't sit in silence. now that tony knew what this guy's deal was, he was free to fuck around. tony told him about living in manhattan, steve told him about living in brooklyn. tony brought up robots, and steve came back with something about being afraid of robots taking over. after a while, they ran out of things to say.
eagerly connecting the last of the exposed wire to the engine, tony narrowed his eyes and let out a slow, quiet breath.
inside tony's bedroom, he didn't sleep. he couldn't sleep. his heart beat quickly and his breathing grew erratic, but nothing was wrong. things were fine. every time his clock ticked, he would be thinking about something else. every breath he took felt like he was breathing in for hours. his black tank top was loose against his frame, and yet he still felt suffocated.
an alternator, I'll lay it out. you're screwed, but not indefinitely." tony slid out from underneath the bike and wiped his hands together, looking up at steve, who returned his gaze.
"you know, you almost had it with that stator. if you would have given it five more minutes of attention like you should have, you'd really…" tony sighed, looking over the progress they had made. "be onto something here." their DIY project, as tony called it, was sitting beside the front tire, almost brought to life. all they had to do was mount it to the bike with a soldering iron and feed the wires through to the engine, and they were done. simple as that.
he had been at it the entire time, only talking to himself. every time he did, steve caught himself hopeful for conversation before realizing that this was a pit stop, not a field trip. but if he learned anything, it was that he could hold a conversation with a wall if he felt like it. after what felt like hours, tony finally spoke up.
their hands had moved apart. tony took a seat on the edge of the wooden table while the two of them broke the seals of their water bottles, chugging them like they were trying to outdo each other. tony would be lying if he said he didn’t try.
maybe wouldn't be his best idea - but he's had a lot of bad ideas. but to his surprise, steve didn't fight him back. instead, he took one step closer and put his hand out for tony to take as a form of apology.
. the garage door looked heavy, the small building scarce on windows, with a large padlock that strapped across the front with large chains. the place looked like it had been crafted by hand, every piece of metal and junk carefully welded together.
to be a wall, steve looked up. the birds that circled above his head were black against the bright contrast of the blue sky, and he couldn't help but admire them. staying alive in this heat was harder than he thought.
steve, who had followed tony out, had crossed his arms across his chest, a sweat stain settling at the collar of his shirt. the heat was unbearable, especially inside that garage. it had to be at least 101 degrees while they were out there, and if he could, he'd cook an egg on the roof. but food seemed like the wrong thing to think about when tony stark is bent over your bike.
"couldn't sleep," tony muttered, clutching the pillow he had grabbed and tossing it on the floor. "uh, back pain. they say it helps if you sleep on the floor."
"I might need a hand," steve matched tony's body language easily: defensive, but not a threat. both of them were ready for
steve sat back on the couch, undoing his belt buckle and the button on his jeans. tony didn't look away.
the next two hours were spent building. explaining. re-doing. the heat was excruciating, and although the sun had set long ago, steve had slow beads of sweat rolling down his nose that tony would comment on every time. but on the other hand, if steve caught a glimpse of tony watching him after demonstrating how to connect wires, he wouldn't say a word.
after they had locked the doors with the bike inside, the walk back to tony's isolated home was long, but the space between them was more than enough company. as soon as they disappeared in the dark after they emerged from underneath a small, shining street lamp, steve brazenly put his hand on tony's shoulder as they walked.
they sat in silence for thirty minutes. steve had pulled up a stool to the table, watching his bike suspended about two feet off the ground and tony laying on his back atop of a red creeper, doing what steve could only call
he might add. the lines were clean and the paper crisp, but he was struggling to find anything special about the thing before he could see what it was powered with. there was no engine, no fuel tank, just an engine with something that resembled a glowing orb.
tony dropped to his knees in front of the bike and immediately took the wire into his hand, the other carefully weaving it past the exposed metal of the engine. if he could just connect the damn wires, he would be done by now. he could hear steve push the stool that sat at his table back and take a few steps until he stood behind him, but neither of them spoke. tony had been out in the middle of nowhere for a
steve's hand was soft against his shoulder as he moved it across tony's back and onto the opposite side, moving in closer between them as they walked together. looking up at him under the light of the midnight moon, tony saw a man who could bring him back to life.
. how cute." the sarcasm dripping from  tony's  voice was apparent.  steve  frowned. instead of feeling any remorse, like  steve  would expect, he held everything he had gathered from his crates in his arms and turned, carefully setting  each and every  part in front of him. gesturing  steve  to move his chair a little closer, tony told him to
the chains and padlock were loose and undone, and once steve yanked at them just hard enough, they had clattered to the ground. he jumped back, staring at them as dust lifted around his shoes. going forward, he pressed his palms flat against the heavy door, opening up the dark garage that now was flooding with light.
"oh, shit. I'm sorry," he jumped down from his place on the table and shook his head, immediately taking a few steps back, almost bumping into the bike.
las vegas was not his final destination, but when his bike sputtered and threatened to give out underneath his weight, steve knew he was doomed. if he were anywhere near civilization, maybe he could fix it himself. instead, all he found were stretches of desert that he thought would never end, heat that blistered him, and the color
"go ahead. use your big kid words." tony's nostrils flared and he let out a heavy breath. steve could smell brown liquor, but they met eyes.
" steve insisted, a little firmer this time. now, tony shut up. "you don't have to run away from me."
by the time tony was unlocking his front door, he could hardly focus. his home was roughly a mile from his garage, and rightfully hidden away in the hills. "normally, I take the hot rod down there, skip the walk," tony started. "but today was a fluke."
"are you going to show me your bike, or are you going to just catch flies in there all day?" steve didn't even realize his mouth was open. by the time he could close it, tony had already turned and began looking for the bike, dead in the water or not. as soon as he rounded the corner and stood in front of it, he couldn't help but think that it was a real… hunk of junk.
this is the tony stark that sold weapons from the comfort of his own home in california, but the same tony stark that donated $150m to schools around the country to help students get into college. finding out
tony stood after that, rolling his eyes. "you just hoped a handsome stranger would leave the door to his priceless garage open, but you didn't know anything about bikes, or basic etiquette in general, so maybe, just
"she's a friend. be nice to her. she's taken me far." steve nodded in tony's direction and smiles, but tony, who is much too busy checking out every moving part in this bike, doesn’t see it. he takes it personally.
steve sounded soft in the middle of the night. normally, tony would jump out of shock and act like nothing happened. instead, he took a few steps closer, reaching for a stray pillow that sat on the opposite end of the couch where steve laid, hugging another pillow close to his chest.
when tony finally turned his head over his shoulder to look at the other, he was met with a soft gaze.
steve froze, hearing an unfamiliar voice behind him. he straightened his posture and curled his fists before
"I'm shaking in my boots. you know, you didn't even tell me your name. what's your deal? what are you doing in nowhere, nevada?" tony looked back at him.
"you have a generator where most bikes have an alternator. I'm going to drop some knowledge on you so this doesn’t happen again." tony turned his back to steve before he moved to the other side of the garage, rooting through some of the crates that lined the wall. "an alternator is a self-contained assembly that has all of the same components your motorcycle uses to generate AC power. you know that that hoop shaped copper wire winding with output wires to your DC rectifier?" steve blinked. "yeah. the rotor has magnets attached and spins inside the hoop. the magnetic field passes though the copper stator wires and creates electrical current, which then converts to DC current in the rectifier module. blah, blah, blah, tony stark's patented rambling…"
tony spent the rest of the hour rattling off about motorcycles, soccer, and green smoothies as the two of them officially closed up shop, with steve yawning as he shrugged on the knapsack that had been sitting in the corner. steve had mentioned his record collection, which tony found more impressive than not. tony told him about the cars he collected, and promised steve would see them someday, and that he'd be missing out if he didn't. steve would hold him to that.
"you must be stark," steve muttered, almost out of breath from his previous scare. he could hardly see by now -- the sun had begun to set behind the slim figure of the stranger in the doorway, beating behind him. glowing behind him. taking another step forward, steve put his hand up to cover his eyes and get a better look at this stark; and he was glad he did. his brown eyes felt challenging, but the dark hair that fell in his face felt endearing. his jeans were black and straight, boots on his feet, and a jacket that sat on top of a black tank top.
"tony." the other replied. there didn't seem to be an ounce of friendly in this guy. steve couldn't blame him, though, seeing as he just…
tony looked over and raised an eyebrow, seemingly surprised. he caught on to the act early and turned his attention back to the bike. "yeah, brushing over the fact that you have no idea what I just said to you, or that your bike doesn't even
his home stood at two stories and was painted rusty brown. once they were let inside, steve was able to see the beautiful, large windows that stood from floor that reached to the ceiling. the furniture was rustic, yet modern. art that steve could recognize hung on the walls of the living room, whereas the art in the hallway were abstract and unintelligible.
from anything," tony challenged, knowing it was against his better judgement. starting a fight with a stranger when he's twice your size and
"well, so far, so good." the two of them let their eyes drift around the room before tony slid his hand across the rough tabletop, close enough to steve's that he could touch, but far enough to pull away. but without a second thought, steve let his index finger reach out and drag across the top of tony's. instinctively, tony yanked his hand away, but they maintained eye contact.
the cause of death for a lot of bikes," tony looked up at steve from across the table. "like yours.”
part of him felt like he was in an indiana jones movie -- any move he made would be met with a swinging log to take him out, or spikes to emerge from the floor and ceiling. but it seemed like whoever had set up shop here had no issue with security, or privacy, for that matter. there were tools hanging on the walls that were seemingly free to use; so he took advantage of it. it was a necessity. at least, that's what steve kept telling himself.
