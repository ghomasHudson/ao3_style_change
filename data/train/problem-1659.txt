John frowned. Sherlock’s face had taken on an innocent expression that he was learning to distrust, but he decided that he had better let the conversation move away from sensitive subjects like his own marriage.
For a moment, the only sound in the room was the wet sound of the massager working back and forth, but before more than a minute or two passed, it was broken by Sherlock’s low groan. John felt it in his fingertips as the utterance shook Sherlock’s body. Suddenly, the situation seemed urgent; the scent of heat and arousal filled the room, and then Sherlock was convulsing with another strangled groan. John watched, openmouthed; there was no longer clear fluid dripping from Sherlock’s cock, but drips of white spunk.
“When it’s not making the house uninhabitable with the stench of burnt feathers or antagonizing megafauna or drinking all my tea it is.”
anything?” Sherlock had taken the news of the accident with an odd combination of concern and disinterested fascination. He had stopped in the middle of cooking bannocks and was now pacing around the cabin, his hair in wild disarray, questioning John about each detail a second time. John, toasting his face and the neglected bannocks in front of the fire, suspected there would be at least a third time.
The next morning, John woke alone; when he went downstairs, showered and ready for work, he found Sherlock asleep on the chesterfield, chest littered with cups. The knife, thankfully, was nowhere near him. John shook his head, kissed Sherlock’s cheek, and, after a brief look at the wasteland that was their kitchen, decided he’d get breakfast at Tim’s on the way. Grocery shopping could wait until tonight.
John had not been able to wait. His mouth was irresistibly drawn to Sherlock’s body, and he was reveling in it. Even after the swim, there was the sharp taste of sweat in the crease of Sherlock’s thigh. It tasted like bravery and fear at once on his tongue, and it drove John wild.
“You could dissect a hundred coyote-wolf hybrids here and nobody would object,” John said, waving his hand expansively, “Well, perhaps the animals themselves.”
Sherlock stared at him for a long moment without speaking. John recalled seeing much the same expression on Harry’s face when she ran to the end of her tether and was jerked back.
Sherlock, oddly, did not exclaim either, looking at him with a strained expression that John put down to the extreme mortification relative to their circumstances. He was about to open his mouth to say … well, what, he did not know, but something, when Sherlock held a shaking hand to his lips. Then, he pointed to his nose. John inhaled.
"Your coyote hybrid, I suppose... no. See here. The rules are simple and you will listen to them. The first: do not get killed or seriously injured. The second: do not make more work for me. I've got enough to do. Break these," John fixed Sherlock with the glare that had made many subalterns wish they were somewhere else, "and I ship you back to where you will have many more rules than this."
“Ready,” was all he said, reaching for Idiot Horse’s reins. Their hands brushed as he seized them, and a shiver shot through him. John coughed, then spoke.
“It is. But you are my own. Aren’t you?” John said, not asking, but rolling over instead to straddle Sherlock’s belly. Sherlock made a half-hearted attempt to push him off, but it was really no true attempt. John’s thighs were warm against his sides, and his weight anchored Sherlock to the ground and also, somehow, to himself. He felt the now-familiar tightness gather at the base of his spine and sighed. The edge of fear he had felt before, the sense of wrongness, was almost completely gone. It was almost like magic, though Sherlock knew it was simple biology. What a fool he had been!
“Don’t let me interrupt your love connection,” Sherlock said. “I’m sure you’ll have fun down under.”
“I can catch her,” Sherlock said, and, without waiting for John’s approbation, Sherlock tore off after them.
"I will to you, if you insist, although 'fresh' is more efficient, as there's only one syllable, and you now know what it means."
John set the goods on the bench. He’d just have to wait. In fact, it might be a mercy that Sherlock was gone; he and Mrs. Hudson had to supervise the goat mating rather more closely than otherwise, as Harry was prone to taking chunks out of Frank at key points in the proceedings. John felt he had talked enough about sexual congress in the last two days to last him some time. Having to supervise goat mating seemed to add insult to injury, especially with Sherlock watching.  He’d seen John’s cock—the most mortifying event of John’s recent life—what if he began to make comparisons with Frank’s genitals?
John dipped the towel again. A mischievous feeling seized him: he turned to make sure Sherlock could see the curve of his body as he bent to wash his arse, legs, and feet—and Sherlock could, his gaze was like a weight. John could feel himself get harder and harder.
His day stretched before him. There would be no woodcutting, and so unless Isadora calved, there were only his meals to look after. He could look over his planting forecast for the spring, but his lack of ready money made him shy away from it; it had been a poor harvest last year and he'd had to eat some of his seed potatoes and grain.
Thankfully, the act was brief. After an interminable quarter of an hour, Frank withdrew without ceremony, John, face motionless, led Clara away to the far side of the house and tied her there.
John did not, could not move. Sherlock made a small, displeased noise and pulled him close. John struggled to get away: Sherlock’s arm was just below his navel, and his face was tucked into John’s ribs. Black curls tickled his left nipple.
“So,” Sherlock said lazily, when he could speak again. He nodded towards John’s second cup. “Shall we keep the car or sell it?”
"Back off, you bastard," John said, without heat. Byron's huge glistening cock was already out, and while John was profoundly uninterested in beasts (unlike, apparently, Anderson, who, Mrs. Hudson had intimated, had been dismissed from his previous place for certain irregularities in his care of the livestock) he could not help being impressed by the size of the bull's equipment.
fighter, and strange cats were vanquished in one round.  The fearless little spitfire would even attack dogs and rout them utterly. When the Widow Turner wasn’t looking, he scooped her up and tucked her on to his lap until dinner was over, glorying in her soft purriness.
“You could at least have brought home coffee,” John said mildly. He waded through the cups to drop a kiss on Sherlock’s head, then went to the kitchen to see if they had either coffee or cream.
“Joseph? Will you pray for us?” Dimmock had his hand firmly on his son’s shoulder. The boy wriggled a little, then, sighing, bowed his head and muttered “Dear Lord thank you for this beautiful day please bless our endeavour and keep us safe amen.”
“It’s just chance.” John peered into the fridge. Two bags of milk were left, but the cream container was nearly empty. He ran his fingers over the surface: greasy. He set it down with a sigh. Ever since the case in early January featuring a victim that drank bulletproof coffee, Sherlock had been testing different blends of fat and cream. The last one--beaver--had been truly noxious, and John had had to put his foot down. The faintly raspberry-flavoured grease slick on Sherlock’s lips had put him off kissing for days, much to Sherlock’s disgust.
He scrubbed himself vigorously; when the sand had fallen out of his hands, he washed his arse and cock with a certain reverence; for the first time, he was delighted at the discovery that he was hardening. John had handled him with so much pleasure, and his body was doing what was necessary to provide that pleasure again to them both.
“Those traditions are very fine, John. They are not what you’re used to, but the Lestrades are good, solid people.”
“Good morning, all,” said the taller of the two. If she were born in Canada, Sherlock thought, he’d eat his hat; her accent held the ringing tones of someone who had at the very least, seen people hunt, and more likely led the hunt—it positively echoed.
Could he stay? The thought assailed him suddenly, and he shifted to a slower tune. John had not asked him, nor did he seem likely to. He wondered, for the first time, if he himself could homestead; if he could build a farm up as John had done. After a moment’s contemplation, he knew that was not what he wanted. He wanted to stay on his present terms: as part of John’s farm and John’s life.
He came back to see that Sherlock had the whole tree out of the fire. With his hands on the unburned bark, he was looking over each inch of the tree carefully, from bottom to top.
Their pace was slow and measured, though Sherlock held John’s arm in a very tight grip—out of fear for himself, rather than fear that John would not follow his lead. He had learned, in their time together, that John would follow him to the ends of the earth if he had to. And now John was following him—both home, and then… to bed? Sherlock felt his ears flush in pleasure.
“Of course not, Uncle Gregory,” he said, but there was an edge to his voice that made Greg sure that John would be kissing that cat just out of his range of sight for the next six months. He supposed it could have been worse, but wished his hastiness at the bottom of the well.
"He ordered me out of the second drawing room, which is really the limit. And I planned it well, too--kitchen unhygienic, stables would 'scare the horses, Sherlock'," Sherlock said, in an uncanny imitation of Mycroft's rather flat voice. "And of course the first drawing room was out of the question; Mother's harpsichord is there. Not that she can play, mind you, but she does love that instrument."
Finally, however, John got up on the horse, though with some jarring of the little squirrel, and they rode home. It was a measure of Sherlock’s concern that he let Idiot Horse crowd as close to Arthur as Arthur would allow.
"It's clearly none of the older women, not unless they're working in concert with one of the younger ones. I put the chances of that at exactly nil."
Sherlock stood around awkwardly as Mrs. Hudson and John got into place. It was clear that this was a well-choreographed event: Mrs Hudson led Frank out of sight behind the old shanty, and John untied Clara and followed at a distance. Harry had been shut up in the barn, and she was making her displeasure felt; Sherlock heard kicks and thumps as well as Harry’s increasingly frantic yelling. He went behind the shanty as well.
The clouds covering the moon had slid away while they were kissing, and in the brighter light, the woods were thrown into greater relief. Birch trunks shone like lanterns; spruce trees shone like feathers.
John shoveled out the stalls quickly, starting to feel his own stomach growl, then donned his coat and went to the pond for water. One day, he would have a pump in the barn, he thought, as the icy water soaked into his gloves.
Dimmock was huddled by the fire when John came back in; John shook the snow out of his boots and gave the boy a blanket and some warmed-over tea.
Placing both hands at the curve of Sherlock’s incredibly lush bottom, John broadened his tongue and licked a very wet stripe from the base of Sherlock’s testicles to his sacroiliac. The noise Sherlock made in response was unreal, a low moan that made John fully hard. He did it again, relishing the quiver under his mouth. Then, slowly, he traced the same route a third time, this time infinitely slowly, exploring each millimetre of musky skin--but this time, he did not overshoot his target. Instead, he stopped licking, and began to drop miniscule, infuriatingly light kisses on the curve of each buttock, working from the outside in, never touching Sherlock’s pink puckered hole until Sherlock was pushing back towards him. John could see Sherlock’s cock was pressed uncomfortably up against the back of the wooden chair, and he could smell Sherlock’s arousal, but still he continued in his deliberately slow approach until Sherlock was very nearly begging under his breath.
“Come on, Sherlock. Wake up. Warm up,” he pleaded, rubbing his hands over Sherlock’s chest. Surely the treatment should be having some effect by now. Well, effect on Sherlock. It was certainly having one on him, worry and cold notwithstanding. He twisted his hips back and breathed deeply. If Sherlock didn’t respond, he couldn’t take his torso, the main source of heat, away for long, but he needed some breathing room. He stretched down and rubbed Sherlock’s feet with his own.
"Leave them ALONE," Sherlock shouted, "You furry arsehole! You squirrel-murdering parasite!" Another wallop.
“That sounds monstrously dull,” John smiled, “as though you are trying to convince yourself and me.”
Mrs. Hudson was fussing over the teapot when they came in; an array of jams and baked goods was already on the table. John hung up his coat and Sally's shawl, washed his hands in the basin, and sat, helping himself to a gingersnap.

By the time he got there, it was all over. Sherlock had the arsonist on the ground—he wasn’t short, John was pleased to notice—and the police were on their way. There was a pile of shredded newspapers and paraffin in the corner.
“Go,” Sherlock said. He already had his hands on the tree, pulling it out of the fire. John sprinted around the back of the fire, but could see and hear nothing unusual. He sniffed the air, on a whim, but no bear scent hung in the air either. It was too dark to see much of anything, and far too late to begin a search.
“Tina Ripley, 22. She’s been missing for six days now but her family reported it only yesterday. They’d thought she had run off with that boyfriend of hers. We found a corpse in the sewers two days ago and think it’s him.”
“Dinner and a stroll through the park with a stupid, faceless female that cancels on you?” Sherlock sums up, annoyed he’s phrasing it as a question, before he shakes his head and glares indignantly. “You should’ve at least chosen someone more worthy of your attention, someone who doesn’t cancel on you and your
John’s voice falls from his lips like clouds opening to reveal bright beams of sunlight and Sherlock experiences a breathless rush of affection towards him and fumbles a bit with the tails of his unbuttoned shirt. He’s nervous all of a sudden and the need to step closer to John hits him fully in the chest. It creates a warm pool right there between his sternum and shoulders and the fact that John is still standing by the door with that lovely smile on his face, his focus entirely on Sherlock, doesn’t exactly offer any opportunity to just turn or step away without seeming weird or obviously flustered. The moment drags towards infinity and if it only wouldn’t be so totally awkward - him standing in their sitting room in his shirt sleeves, color slowly rising to form two warm spots on his cheeks  - he may be tempted to never leave the realm where John Watson looks at him with so much affection, patience and focus. Sherlock shyly dips his chin.
Neither seemed to move first, but there was no awkward hesitation, no second guessing, just their mouths crushing together, so hard it could scarcely have been called a kiss.
John had averted his gaze and picked up the book he’d been reading yesterday morning, before the case that sent them running pell mell all over London in the pouring rain. He feared Sherlock would actually strip altogether, which wouldn’t make this any easier. But it was in fact worse than that. Sherlock began actually talking to John.
He tossed aside the dagger and flipped Sherlock over, sliding easily into his abused hole. One edge of the blindfold had slipped up, but John could see Sherlock’s eyes were screwed shut in concentration, trying to be good, trying to keep from spilling before he was allowed.
Well, that could certainly be a cure for their boredom. It had been awhile and with all that had been going on neither had been much in the mood. John sat down on the bed.
His voice turned stern and commanding, “I’ll be the judge of that, Holmes,” and I was helpless at that. Helpless and hopelessly aroused. My skin felt like fire everywhere he’d touched me, though they were the most innocent of touches, merely to my forehead, my arm.
Sherlock’s eyes were wide and he did look rather frightened. That shouldn’t make John even harder, but he throbbed to watch him and, frankly, he knew from long experience that Sherlock would positively maul John if he stopped their games without a safeword.
My pleasure built as I watched him, the warmth of his body beside me, the weight of his gaze on me and the memory of his hands spurred me on. At last, with the thought that he was
Eventually he stretched and moved to the water basin, cleaning up and bringing me a cloth to wash up as well.
My desire to taste him overtook me and without a thought I dragged my fingers through the mess of his spendings and brought them to my lips, sucking them clean. The salt tang of him on my tongue sent a thrill through me
“You took us all so well,” John murmured as he eased out. “Should paint a picture of this and hang it in my cabin. You look positively wrung out.” He paused a moment, caressing whatever he could reach.
“Holmes, I am your friend and your doctor. If I do not attend you, who would? You do not seem well, my dear fellow. Please.” He clasped my shoulder with a gentle shake. “What’s gotten into you?”
“Just... trying it out.” Sherlock said, almost wincing at how lame that sounded. “You’ve stopped dating anyone else, you know,” he added with a bit more confidence and looked up, genuinely curious as to whether John had noticed.
It took him a few tries, but he managed, fucking himself on it as John captured his mouth in a kiss, rough and claiming.
“He’ll be back in three days,” Sherlock replies caustically and refuses to look at Lestrade. He’s afraid he might give it all away if he does. It’s a bit offputting how Lestrade phrases his question, focusing rather on John‘s absence than his return. Yet, if he notices how Sherlock changed that focus, he doesn’t say anything and, for a moment, Sherlock is absurdly glad that Lestarde has learned how not to pry.
“I see,” Sherlock says and, despite everything, smiles crookedly because John, after all these years of chasing Sherlock chasing criminals, sure knows what to look for. Moreover, John does his observation with a grace and mind for details that’s become very natural and reliable.
“Anderson said that?” John wonders and glances at Sherlock as if to prompt a snarky retort but all Sherlock can do is fall backwards on to his stool and clear his throat before trusting his voice with something as elaborate as speech. Something like cold rain crashes into him and where he has been bashful and overwhelmed before, he now is positively vibrant with white hot anger.
Now that he’s consciously looking at the array of information is he surprised how much he has actually collected in the last three and a half years.
It seems that John only glances at him when they are not in direct contact and when it is safe to look without being caught out.
“John-,” Sherlock starts, confused and unsure about how to proceed with the sentence but John talks over him.
He shakes his head slightly in confusion, mouth parched. “You don’t want to— “ He cannot find it in him to state the somewhat painful obvious and the unsaid words hang like weights between them, while moments drag by and Sherlock feels the increasing need to just jump out of bed an tear off but John only tightens his grip on him to hold him there. He looks at Sherlock for a moment before he leans in and chastely kisses the bow above Sherlock’s top lip. His breathing is a bit ragged, his hand on Sherlock's waist rigid. “Believe me I do. Very much so. I am not messing with you on this. It is way too important.”
Sherlock suddenly feels awkward and sips his tea to gloss it over. He tilts his upper body to the side and makes a show of tucking a leg under him into the chair and adjusting his gown. John huffs behind his paper and grips it tighter.
Dismissing that particular mystery for the time being he turns the card, hums, and holds it up to the fading light. He’s somewhat disappointed when there is nothing to detect. No hidden message, no watermarking, just ordinary stationery, though heavily expensive, lacerated fancily around the edges and with tiny leafy filaments that are just a tad darker than the rest of the paper.
He drew his hand carefully from base to tip, and then back down to the base, and he was completely erect. He measured against his hand as he drew a shaky breath--just shy of six inches, as usual, with his girth a little wider than proportional.
The slide of a nude body against his own—and a vigorous, healthy nude body, not one half-dead with cold—was a delicious shock, but also one that put him in the same uncomfortable situation as that terrible night: his body could not tell that this was no time for base urges. Even the water, so deliciously cool, was no deterrent, and John set his foot on the ground bent on backing away and freeing himself before any telltale swelling could result.
Sherlock drew a deep though still-ragged breath, his nerves calming somewhat. The constant derangement was eating away at his self-control. He was no longer the man he had been, and these urges—he shuddered at the word—were, must be, at fault. They had once been so rare that they had been taken care of by his unconscious; the nighttime ejaculations had been messy, certainly, but had required no effort on his part. Now, these urges had intruded into his conscious mind and rendered him all but useless.
Doctornerdington slaved over this chapter and really helped make it better. <3 Marigolds, ellioop, turifer, and girlwhowearsglasses provided a lot of squee and I am grateful. I have been DYING to share this chapter with you.
Sherlock eventually did bank the fire and stand, stretching his body out of the cramped position he had taken. His muscles protested and the congestion at the base of his spine surged back into his consciousness. He thought, briefly, of taking himself in hand again—in the loft he would be untroubled by bears, surely—but the memory of John’s anguished face stopped him. If it were an act of sexual congress, then he dare not subject John to even an accidental participation, given John’s scruples.
"Carleton is barely a city, but, yes. And Sherlock knows all the local doctors on sight; he won't stand to be examined by them. But he lives for science, and since I know you have several unusual botanical specimens in this area, I thought perhaps he might be convinced to travel."
John looked at him. Though the only light was that of the cabin, still some way away, the strain on his features was clearly visible.
“So you finally slept some, did you?” he asked. “Tea’ll be on in a moment, if your transport would like some.” Sherlock grunted, then fell back into bed hard enough to shake the loft.
Sherlock forgot his worries over the strange attack while he worked, but the post-mortem was over quickly. The belly contained nothing unusual, and the traumatic injuries to the brain were consistent with accidental impact.
“Oi,” Sherlock said. “My bruv Lestrade knows that the size ain’t much diffrent. Save some dosh, right, gives us more money for beer.” He reached over and flipped a lever. The window stayed open.
John snorted. He had thought the same thing so many times he could not deny it. Annoying she might be, but he always knew what she was thinking.
“Good morning.” Sherlock said, voice deep and rough. John jumped as though he had been stung, dropping everything and falling backwards. His head hit the floor with a thump, and his cock bobbed up through his flies once again.
“No, for fuck’s sake. I’m just… this is probably the most romantic and comfortable we’ve been so far.”
"It stopped for a moment," Sherlock rolled to his side, eyes bright. "But now I find myself desiring to investigate once more."
“Really, Sherlock? Do you think you can outsmart Arthur?” Despite his annoyance, John grinned as warring expressions met on Sherlock’s face.
Harry’s yelling had reached ear-splitting levels, and John’s forearms, Sherlock noticed, were bulging with the effort of keeping her in check.
“Interesting,” he breathed, but before John could ask what, exactly, was interesting, he was gone. John shook his head and continued on his way.
“You could be pardoned for thinking Mycroft revolting, yes, but open defiance is not his style. Much too gauche. No, he simply took over. He directed, without actually seeming to direct, the school.”
A chance encounter in the woods brings John flashbacks and nightmares. Sherlock asks some unanswerable questions and makes some unexpected observations. Harry is in heat and doesn’t care who knows it—and John is surprisingly sympathetic, for some reason that has nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes at all.
“It’s Dimmock,” he said, from the doorway. John, who could not see a single thing through Sherlock, shrugged. “He probably has letters. Sometimes I do get mail.”
He only sat for a moment before the shivers hit him. He had never been so cold in all his life as he was then; his bones themselves felt like ice. His teeth chattered hard, so hard, and he could not have moved if his life depended on it. Sherlock knew his body was trying to warm him; once the first wave of shuddering had passed, he might be able to get up and try again. For the moment, however, his misery was so intense that he could not feel at all hopeful. He closed his eyes, the chatter of his teeth filling the dark cottage, and waited.
This reluctance had nothing to do with making John grouchy while holding an axe. It was due to Sherlock realizing that while he had always been interested in anatomy, he had never truly realized the pull of the subject when observations could be made on a living person. The flex of John’s back muscles was utterly fascinating, pinkening Sherlock’s face in a way that had nothing to do with the sun. He forced himself to focus on only the scientific nature of the muscles, rather than the fact they were attached to John Watson; any dwelling on that fact resulted in an uncomfortable consciousness that his drawers were too tight.
“I’m taking the horses up there, Sherlock,” John said, pointing even though he knew Sherlock was paying no attention at all.
Then, he remembered. His summer drawers were in his chest; he’d put those on and save himself at least some embarrassment. He spread Sherlock’s clothes over the settle to dry, then his own, and pulled on the linen drawers. They were thin with wear, but they would be protection of a sort.
When Sherlock woke, his stomach was sticky and his blankets were too. However, he felt a marvelous sense of lightness, and his head was clear for the first time in days. He palpated his testicles: only a slight residual tenderness.
“It’s here somewhere,” Sherlock said, and dropped to his knees. He scrabbled around in the grass, examining the base of each young tree.
They walked in silence for nearly an hour. Only when they neared the final corner did Sherlock speak again.
They say goodbye and neither one of them cries. Guglielmo flies back to England with a circle of teeth marks on his neck and tears in his eyes.
It is my fervent headcanon that Sherlock dislikes horses. They are intelligent in a way he doesn’t care to understand. I am willing to entertain alternate headcanons (I really enjoyed the riding AU someone wrote a while back), but in this fic, he hates horses and that’s important. Also, in this fic, some horses hate him. There’s an Easter egg related to that that’s introduced in this chapter.
“In the sense that I will take you to bed so you’ll quit formulating unreasonable theories about the damn coffee cups, yes.”
Nothing more had been said about being lovers. They had exchanged one more kiss, barely a brush of lips, one day as they had crossed paths in the doorway of the barn, but nothing else. John had spent his days clearing, gradually trying to reorganize his heart around Sherlock’s open desire.
The club opened at nine; John and Sherlock were among the first admitted, jostling in the crowd of beautifully groomed men. The minute they were inside, John made his way to the bar, ordering two bottles of beer. The relief of even taking them into his hands was tremendous; it felt like the first gasp of moisture he’d had in years. The first one disappeared in moments and he took three huge gulps of the second before feeling as though he were human again.
“They may have. I had…one friend, of a sort, and he kept the others away in exchange for information.”
The horses didn’t shy at the noise, but Arthur danced back. Sherlock did not miss John looking at the horse sharply.
And then he saw that Stamford was not alone. There was a woman beside him, and another woman—no, a young boy, as well.
It dissolved immediately, slippery and silky. John was impressed by the smoothness of the fat and made a note to thank his friend. Perhaps it would serve to grease some of his finer tools--although at the price it had cost him he would have to use it sparingly.
“I definitely don’t know the protocol with others.” Neat bit of avoidance there, he thought. “I’m not a soldier, with other men easily accessible at all times.”
After the door closed with a crash behind John, Sherlock dropped his head to the back of the settle and drew a long breath. His limbs were heavy and yet light, his arse was slick and pleasantly strained, and his mind was suffused with a glow that could not be dampened by his unexpected crisis and John’s shocked reaction.
John is angry. Guglielmo can see it in his face. He opens his mouth to deduce John, to make him angrier. He stops, though. Can't say why. But his cheeks are hot. John is charmed by this submission.
True as it was, it was something that might be harder than medicine, even. John squared his shoulders and nerved himself to enter the cabin.
“To friendship!” Sarah exclaimed, once he had fetched it, and everyone raised their glass. Sherlock began to play an infectious tune, and it wasn’t long before they were all dancing, despite their heavy supper.
Greg turned and left the room, shutting the door behind him gently. He stifled a sudden urge to laugh wildly. First, he frightened John, then he grabbed him like a common thief, then he could not find two words to say. How, how on earth, was he ever going to manage this composed little person?
Holding one finger firmly inside Sherlock, John laid his right fingers on Sherlock’s jugular pulse. Fast, but that was to be expected.
"No motive though. Why would she do such a thing? You don't know her, I don't know her," John interrupted.
“Yes,” Sherlock arched his back. John did it again, trailing bites down Sherlock’s sensitive ribs on both sides, and back up to the other armpit. He was drowning in Sherlock’s scent, almost on the verge of coming, when he kissed Sherlock again in a haze of pheromones.
“She’s a friend of my mother’s,” Sherlock said to John, apologetically. “They were at school together.”
Sherlock did not reply. John waited. When Sherlock’s body relaxed a fraction, John pushed past the second tight ring of muscle. A shudder took Sherlock, sweeping down from his shoulders to his haunches.
“Hold tight. I’m going to…” John was torn. Sherlock needed heat, fast, and the only source handy was John himself. But if John didn’t light the fire, they’d both freeze in the night—and John was none too sure Sherlock could make it through without a hot drink. He covered Sherlock up.
That night, without the whiskey, he dreamt of the days before Agra. Mary smiling at him through her fan, Commander Morstan urging them to dance, that first kiss the same night, almost shocking. Then, Captain Sholto was asking him, in Mycroft Holmes' voice, to take the rear and protect the men. He couldn't. He couldn't protect the men. He couldn't protect himself, he thought, as the rebels poured down upon them and Mary's dead face rose dancing in front of his eyes.  He woke with tears on his face this time, his chest heaving. He got out of bed as soon as he could, but several minutes had elapsed before he was able to do anything but hold his body together.
“Lyons,” Barrymore nodded. He and Lyons were close neighbours, and John realized he had no idea how those two interacted. He’d never needed to know before, he supposed.
Sherlock remembered what it had been like waking from an illness during which he had been dosed with laudanum: trembling and soaked to the skin with the effects of the medicine. John seemed much the same.
Sherlock unbuttoned his shirt, exposing his gleaming, sparsely haired chest. He seemed impossibly long everywhere, and his hands were enormous. John wanted to stay in the moment, to enjoy every second of Sherlock disrobing, and yet he could not help but imagine how those hands would feel on his body. He shivered.
“Big enough for my teams and at least one other, maybe two. The river road is much more travelled than it was even three years ago; I’m getting more, er, custom, than ever before.
"No, now," he said, pulling away. He decided to lean on the pig's rail instead; he didn't need his shirt eaten while he was trying to perform a medical experiment.
"Yes," John said, softly, and slowed his rhythm just slightly. Sherlock cried out, a long soft call, and his essence spurted out, hitting his stomach, his neck, and his curls. He shuddered through the spasms, his eyes tight shut. John's arousal mellowed a little, replaced by affection. Esteem.
“Are we not compatible?” They both knew the answer, but sometimes it was better to ask questions one knew the answer to.
“What are we going to say?” John wasn’t ashamed, but he didn’t want his neighbours in his private business, either.
“Would that make good honey?” John rarely tasted honey; Mrs. Hudson did not keep bees, nor did Stamford or Lestrade.
His own neglected cock throbbed, but now that they were actually touching each other, he could revel in it.
“Danger,” John said. “We’re always in bloody danger—or you are. No, wait,” he said, putting his hand over Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock licked it, partly petulantly, partly to feel the texture of John’s skin. John drew his hand away and used it to pin Sherlock’s shoulder to the ground.
Sherlock said nothing, but he did not look away as John yanked his clothes on and retrieved his socks and still-damp boots from beside the hearth. John could feel those eyes taking stock of his every inch. Fine, then. Though he was burning with shame and embarrassment, he stared back at Sherlock as he finished dressing. He straightened up.
“Fortnightly seminal discharge is important for your-No!” John exclaimed, holding up his hand, “I don’t want to hear the words ‘just transport’ again. Your body is important.”
“Ahh,” Sherlock sighed, licking his long fingers. “Nanny always told me I would come to no good if I did this.”
The theme song is “Fishing in the Dark” by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Hi, I’m Red and I was a teenager in Canadian cowboy country in the ‘80s. However, I still don’t hate this song. Find the Easter egg.
"You're worried about taking a day away from the farm, though," Sherlock said. John raised his eyebrows.
That decided, he set it aside with a firm mental shake of his head, and set to assessing his home. It was at least another two weeks until any outdoor work could be done, and perhaps he could make some small repairs to the interior to make it more comfortable in that time.
The light in the caravan was weak, but the view was wonderful. Sherlock lay on the bed, a slick, shaking mess. His mouth was pink and plump, and his eyes were fixed on John.
John washed his hands at the pump and sat down. Sherlock poured tea and turned smartly back to the fire, bending solicitously over the bake kettle.
"Hie!" John yelled, "Get out!" The bear did not react. John shouldered his weapon, but could not get a clear shot; if he missed, he would hit one of his own animals for certain. He started to make his way closer.
“You were a great mover yourself, Cyrus,” Lestrade said, his smile wide…too wide, John thought. He looked for Sherlock as though to confirm his thoughts, but Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.
It wasn’t until Arthur stopped walking to look back at them disapprovingly that they gained control of themselves. John took up the reins again feeling lighter, as though something hard inside him had been dissolved. Sherlock looked younger, too, his face clear and bright, and suddenly John was grateful for his presence. He was grateful, too, that he had resisted the temptation to touch Sherlock as a lover. He could love Sherlock, he realized, Platonically; any baser desire could be suppressed.
"Cold?" said Great-Aunt Martha kindly.  "These June evenings are chilly yet.  Come into the sitting-room--Mike has kindled a fire in the stove there now, and you can have a little lunch before bed."
“I see.” John could not help but smile. The workings of Sherlock’s mind, his intense devotion to science, held enough charm that he, John Watson, was allowing all sorts of horrible things in his kitchen.
“I daren’t. You’re a good man, Sherlock Holmes,” he said, knowing it was too little. He felt something inside himself crack.
Five more steps. A fat drop of rain fell down the back of his neck, and an icy rivulet rolled down his spine to the waist of his trousers. He felt a shiver of cold start between his shoulder blades and engulf his neck and shoulders; he mustered his self-control and drove it back. If he gave over to shivers now he would stop walking, and if he stopped walking he would not start again. He was so very cold, but he took five more steps, and five more after that. It was dark now, and the temperature had dropped again, likely to 2 degrees centigrade. Another shiver at the thought, which he controlled as well. He would master his body. Five more steps.
The moonlight glinted on John’s hair as he made his way down to the pond, and suddenly Sherlock’s breath was short from something other than nerves.
How many reasons he had to be grateful for Sherlock; he had objected to Mycroft's imposition, but Sherlock had been the perfect antidote to his loneliness and misanthropy. And Sherlock had a boon to the farm as well, taking over duties that John abhorred and thus making the farm more productive. They would eat well, this winter, and if the harvest was as productive as planned, have grain and livestock to sell.
“Backwards,” Sherlock muttered, then looked at John. “Catapulted. Of course. John, you’re brilliant!” he said, and took off at a flat run. John followed as fast as he could this time, and was surprised to fetch up at the little wood on the home side of the south field.
“I did!” Sherlock replied with enthusiasm. “My subconscious regulated my genital system most adequately. Although perhaps I will do some washing today.”
Still, he did nothing, waiting for Sherlock to move. What did one do, or say, to mysterious figures in the woods? Adrenaline coursed through him and he began to sweat. He stiffened his spine against a tide of familiar, helpless desire, slowing his breathing and letting Sherlock’s utter calm hold him in place.
“I didn’t want you here but now that you are you might as well be well. And I don’t want to lose my farm. Lettuce?” John asked, hopefully. Not terribly nutritious but it did contain vitamins.
“Morning, John,” Lestrade shouted, popping up from behind the enormous pile of logs meant for the barn. “Morning, Sherlock.”
"Be that as it may. Oh, here he is. Moving pretty quick for someone in a sulk. Must have seen a bear." Stamford pointed southeast, and John saw a tall shape in the distance. It was clinging crazily to a rangy chestnut mare with the worst trot he'd ever seen. No bears in sight, either. Maybe he'd seen a moose—those, at least, were worth running from.
“The floss,” Sherlock said. “That may help. And how many makes of boot buttons can there be? I need data. Information.”
Once the goats were tethered and the animals all led down to drink, he felt better. It was ridiculous perhaps, but he knew Harry or Clara would send up the alarm if anything appeared in the farmyard.
“Oh, Sherlock,” he said. Sherlock lay like a lump under the blankets, unmoving and uncaring, and John quickened his movements, filling the kettle and piling larger logs around the snapping branches in the hearth. When that was done, he stripped off his own coat and held his hands before the fire.
“Speak of the devil!” Stamford laughed, and shook John’s hand with a wide smile. “John, you must meet Miss Molly Kuskatoo.”
Dimmock’s arrival was nothing short of a relief for Sherlock. Though he had succeeded in igniting John’s rage, his own desire was also white-hot: if he was not imagining what John might do to him when his control snapped, he was replaying every moment of the prostate massage in his head. His notebook was filled with diagrams that were decidedly not botanical, and his one need was for John to touch him again.
Sherlock looked at John’s face closely, checking for hints of concealed disdain or mockery, but there were none. There was only frankness, tinged with sympathy for what must seem, to a man used to the woods, foolishness.
The door of the caravan slammed behind them and they were in each other’s arms again. The only light came from a streetlamp on the main path and occasional flashes of lightning; rain blew in through the open window onto the front bed.
“All right, Sherlock?” There it was. Sherlock met John’s eyes—dark blue, so dark that they looked brown in some lights.
"The lo….. No. I don't want to, and that's reason enough. Good day." John nodded to the young woman and turned on his heel.
Sherlock had even met Lestrade, and despite Sherlock’s incivility and Lestrade’s wariness, the meeting had gone off quite well. Sherlock had led with a rude comment about Mycroft’s size, and Lestrade had warmed right up, though there had been a look in his eyes John hadn’t quite liked. Just how did Lestrade know the Holmes family?
“And yet you’re not out helping with the logs.” Sherlock dried his hands and passed the towel to Sarah.
John felt another urge for paper and pen. He desperately wanted to record the inky blackness above him, full of possibilities. He frowned his twitching fingers away, though, and willed himself to remember the sentences he was composing in his mind.
Wiping his forehead, for it had become quite a warm day, he sat down on a felled birch tree at the edge of the new field. He unwrapped Sherlock’s good bread and cheese and uncapped his bottle of cold tea with relief.
It was one of the most intimate things John had ever done, under the most dangerous circumstances. With Sherlock there, stock-still in the middle of the room, with God knew what lurking in the woods, John unbuttoned his trousers and slid them over his hips. They fell to the floor. His cock, now only restrained by his drawers, bobbed up, already hard. Sherlock bit his lip.
They swim, bare limbs shining in the sun. They are both wearing white drawers and those drawers are thinner than they expected and they come together like magnets in the summer dusk. They make out. There is beard burn along Guglielmo’s neck and thighs. John’s jaw aches from rimming him.
. Sherlock fumes in distress and instinctually turns away from John, a sense of betrayal curling in his guts. He glares at the DI, chin held high and stubborn and wishes the man would just shut up and not fan the flames any further.
“Don’t be nervous, this is not a rejection, Sherlock,” John simply says but there is a trace of tension in his body now. “We will do whatever you want but it should all wait until the case is wrapped. I want you to think about it when your head is clear again, I am not imposing myself on you while you cannot afford to be too distracted. This isn't just a fling.” Maybe it’s just a trick of the light but, abruptly, John’s eyes go dark when he takes a deep breath and chuckles, voice deep and all Sherlock can do is
A second loud moan drowned out any other coherent speech and made John’s blood rush straight into his groins. He had to push his own arousal hard into the matrass and roll his hips. The duvet and the remains of his trousers had him both moaning and shuddering and he opened his mouth without further ado or internal debating to take Sherlock in, his tongue sliding over hard and warm flesh, over the little slit at his glans, while slender hips desperately tried to rock upwards. Sherlock tangled the fingers of one hand into his hair and was practically melting under him. It seemed like the part of his brain that was usually stalling every human notion and every interest Sherlock might have had towards other people, had floated away. And, damn, John would make sure it’d stay away. All that mattered at the moment - and risking a look upwards to Sherlock’s face, flushed and contorted into pleasured agony, only confirmed it - was Sherlock’s lean, naked body under him, his cock on his tongue and his sweet cries in his ears. His warm skin everywhere and the incredibility of sharing pleasure with being together like that.
Sherlock is crouching at the dead body’s side, his hands fumbling with his magnifying glass and John is on one knee next to him. Glancing at him. Sherlock feels his skin prickle for a second and goes very still.
How does he do that, Sherlock wonders and his body hums with the unexpected intimacy of it. His movements stutter and his fingers miss the rhythm. The biro clatters to the floor and Sherlock snaps out of case mode.
Before it can all tumble over into awkwardness, though, Sherlock feels John slightly relax the claim on his body. He tips up his face to ghost a kiss across Sherlock’s forehead. Sherlock instantly likes the way John’s nose gets lost in his curls and, absurdly, how reassuring, how protective that gesture is. How John uses his leverage to press another kiss onto each of Sherlock’s brows as if they each were lovers of his in its own right even though he is the one trapped in the constrained space between the bed and another fully grown body on top of him. It is
Sherlock hoisted himself up on his elbows after he had pushed his curls out of his face. A wistful look came into his eyes.
“You’re ridiculous,” he huffs and when John smiles even wider and nudges him playfully in the ribs, Sherlock sits up, lets John’s upper body slip into his lap and leans forward to cup his hands around John’s tanned face. “Utterly ridiculous.” He touches his lips to John’s for a second and feels giddy and happy when John encircles one wrist to keep him there.
He wants to plea for John to just explain it all to him, to tell him what’s behind it all because he’s neither strong nor witty enough to suss it out on his own. He wants to tell John to rid him of this terrifying feeling of not being emotionally stable enough to be both human and craving.
John’s nerves were raw. He couldn’t afford to lose Sherlock again, no matter the cost. He would do anything to keep him safe, and the inevitability of it crashed through him like lightening. He was determined, adrenaline punching through his veins. His fists clenched together, his heart went wild. No more death…
It is 2am in the morning and Sherlock lies in bed. Sleep is eluding him and his mind is positively reeling with pondering possible solutions to the mystery of whatever it was that has happened between John and him in the sitting room earlier tonight.
Out of the kitchen John glances at him, just like that very first time Sherlock noticed, and Sherlock can feel it down his spine. His heart gives an angry throb. This time, though, he feels something shift within himself and a moment later he is unable to simply stand not knowing anymore.
In the quiet and dark tunnel somewhere under the streets of London Sherlock, without thinking or calculating, breaks convention. He reaches out a trembling hand and John takes it silently while they wait for Lestrade and his forensics.
Continuing as if nothing happened, John taunts, “Maybe we’ll tip it over into a nice massage… maybe into more than a nice massage…”
When John had awoken, Sherlock’s arm was draped over his stomach, his curls wild and his face relaxed in slumber. The alarm clock had shown him that it was only eight o’clock in the morning and John had spent the best part of a delightful hour watching Sherlock sleep. It was really hard not to feel peaceful and when the lurching of his own heart was anything to go by, John knew that he had never been so happy in a very long time.
In the cab Sherlock keeps his gaze fixed on the streets where they rush by outside the car window. It’s past nine o’clock but the city still buzzes with bustling energy. The pavements are full of people, mostly couples, occasionally small groups of both friends and couples. They sit in the window seats of restaurants and coffee shops and parade their togetherness beneath the trees and around busy street corners. Beneath street lamps, where the halos illuminate them like actors on stage. It is a mild, lovely evening for the fact that it is february and there are considerably more cars on the streets. No doubt more people on their way to theaters, cinemas, restaurants and the parks of London.
“But taking into consideration how you are walking through this glorious morning with no apparent need to go home, he probably hasn’t said anything at all.”
John understands, grabs his arm and shakes his head, his eyes twinkling and radiating more light than Sherlock thought possible in the beginning dawn. John’s answer comes with a little surprise. “It’s really weird when you apologize, you know” he says “save it for next time you run off and get yourself in danger.”
His voice sounded rather hoarse. The part of John’s brain that wasn’t busy overlooking the street or being afraid put that aside given their current situation. He raised his hand to shush him, craning his neck to get a better look around.
“Why did you never say?” he chooses to inquire and hopes it promises the greatest amount of data to help his case and solve this enigma which is John Watson and the way he looks at him now.
“You can tell me later, Sherlock. Where to, now?” he asked, his breath catching in his throat. He really wasn’t used to this amount of running anymore.
Sherlock stalls and glares for another few seconds, but John is already charming a waitress into clearing them a table and, just on cue, his treacherous stomach rumbles.
“How does it feel to be ordinary for once?” John teases him lightly. He shifts a bit, his bum at the counter now, his stance relaxed, with ankles and arms crossed loosely.
Shocked into rigidness once again Sherlock states at him as he realizes that not only has John entangled their miscommunication but also has just gone and made a move that is essentially irrevocable; a move he couldn’t know the outcome of. The amount of amazement and stunned surprise that hits him a moment later is breathtaking and, abruptly, Sherlock feels unable to catch his breath. With the determination of a man who willfully steps onto a frozen lake without any means to know whether the ice will hold or break and let him drown John has made a move so brave that Sherlock can only stare. A small immanent part in his mind revolts and suspects deception, manipulation, but, a moment later, Sherlock finds confirmation in John’s whispered confession.
“That would be quite foolish, Sherlock” John breaths a deep and rumbling laugh and their bodies shake with it. “But romantic, too, maybe you’re not a lost cause.”
“My informant tells me they’re moving their equipment tonight, because Scotland Yard is too close. Finally Lestrade gets it right.”
But again John is having none of it. “This is Thai, you love Thai. Come on,” he orders before climbing the four steps up to the entrance and opening the door.
Sherlock eyes them for a moment longer before he puts the box onto the table, snaps on one nitrile glove and picks out the foxglove flower, carefully so he doesn’t damage it. “Molly, I need to examine this and I need you to list all the toxins in this flower that have no natural business being there.”
, is off about the whole situation. He was expecting John to grumble and then admit everything, maybe even accuse him of ruining his attempts at a more carnal progress to tonight’s dating plans, because Sherlock is right and there are no secrets that John with his expressive face could ever hide from him. However, he didn’t expect John to look genuinely bewildered.
“You said you’ve wanted this… And I want it, too, I want everything,” Sherlock whispered and lifted his hands to cup John’s face.
“I am so glad I possess the ability to amuse you so much. This from the man who believes in the completely daft superstition of clinking glasses because he’s afraid of bad sex.”
“Quite an interesting choice of words. But I am afraid it is nothing quite so inept. As it is, my brother downright refused to see a therapist when I brought him back. He said he’s comfortable enough being home at 221B, solving cases with you, Dr. Watson,” he added when John’s head snapped around to stare at him.
Maybe it’s John’s fluffy-be-mine-Valentine’s Day present, but no, Sherlock has checked. It’s definitely his, it says so on the addressing. He briefly ponders whether the date is coincidental but dismisses the thought as too unlikely a coincidence.
“Oh, yes. Change of plans,” Sherlock answers merrily and while he unwinds his scarf to throw it onto a lab chair, he notices John and Molly locking eyes. John has stepped behind him to remove his jacket, his back turned so Sherlock cannot see his face and Molly is frantically gesturing at him, her face a bit flushed and mouth taut. Sherlock frowns. Since when have these two become conspiratorial?
“I don’t want anything you’re not willing to give,” he counters and Sherlock again has to admire his conviction and how content he seems to be in offering so much, nerves notwithstanding. It is a bit irritating. Sherlock clears his throat to try and reason with him. And his own traitorous heart, which is rapidly beating away behind his rib cage.
John abruptly stops in his tracks and Sherlock, having continued their meanderings for a couple more steps, has to turn around to face him.
“Please, John,” Sherlock scoffs, but the warmth pooling in his belly is rather enthusiastic about the idea. “A shared bath, really? How… romantic of you.”
“You don’t actually happened to have come across my phone as well? It’s always so tedious getting a device that isn’t instantly hacked by your department. I really thought that for once I was giving them quite a hard time.”
“Sherlock, you know, sometimes I think you’re only putting up with me so you don’t actually have to talk to people. Or be nice to them.”
Sherlock blinks and surges to his feet, delighted. “Oh, good.” He snatches the box out of John’s arms and puts it on the kitchen table. John steps over to him a moment later, now devoid of coat, shoes and scarf, and a whiff of cologne plays around Sherlock’s nose. John has a very benevolent and handsome smile on his face and Sherlock is thrilled. He didn’t even have to do anything and
They had been sharing a lazy afternoon in their living room, John reading a book and Sherlock playing the violin for hours. John had felt perfectly comfortable, Sherlock’s soft music lulling him into serenity. When he had asked Sherlock what he was playing, the other had just hummed at him.
"Come for me, then", he whispered and licked his lips, giving another vicious thrust that Sherlock answered with a soft cry. A heavy tremor shook him and when he came, his breath shattered into a million little pieces und a hot wetness bloomed between them where their cocks were trapped between their bellies. His legs around John spasmed, tightening the space around John’s own cock. Not that he needed the extra sensation, though. Seeing Sherlock roll back his eyes and listening to his sweet cries, his hips jerking upwards, clearly drove him towards breaking point. He thrust his hips forwards and then it was too much to bear anymore. John’s mouth shaped around a final moan and heat exploded in his groins, before his release joint Sherlock’s on the trembling panes of his pale stomach.
“Ah, so nice not seeing you in a hospital bed for change, Sherlock.” A voice resounded from the open door, and to John’s puzzlement, Mycroft Holmes swept into the room, umbrella dangling from his wrist, and a shopping bag in his hand.
“I didn’t know you could do that,” John exclaims and blatantly stares at him in something very close to wonder and awe. “How come— I mean, where did you learn that?”
“No, it is important to me. And I am past being patient. For Christ’s sake, quit acting the martyr. You’ve already changed everything so much, truly you must see reason.”
The fact is that Sherlock has given up bothering what other people think about him when he’s learned caring comes with a price. School and university have been bitter teachers. Victor and Redbeard have been as well. He knows about the fragility of his own heart and therefore has never offered it to anyone before. It is stupid, anyway, offering one’s heart, he thinks with a trace of sarcasm and disdain, because what is the heart other than a collocation of nerves and vessels and blood and tissue?
John’s voice caught on the last words but the moment he finished he was feeling relieved. He’d made a final approach, no questions like he’d promised in his texting earlier, just statements, and it had felt okay. He wasn’t expecting an answer so he didn’t look at Sherlock but then he heard the other man inhale.
John stares at him for a moment, then nods, wary as if he isn’t sure what Sherlock is aiming at. “Yes, absolutely,” he agrees. His ocean blue gaze fixes on him again but Sherlock finds himself missing the lovely tiny gold dots. Fear tickles back into his guts but Sherlock refuses to let it cloy him.
John hesitates a moment and pinches the bridge of his nose. “What do you know of my plans for tonight?” he finally asks but it’s rhetorically and with an air of defeat, and it’s that moment, where it occurs to Sherlock that they may be talking about completely different things. There’s obviously something off, something he’s missing and his features scrunch in bemusement and fury.
Sherlock seemed to realize he had gotten carried away and gave John a melodramatic hand gesture that clearly emphasized his lack of sympathy for how John could actually rank these kind of carnal experiences over those of brain and intellect. John was perplexed how Sherlock could have gotten so worked up about the potentialities of dating, for god’s sake. It wasn’t like they were debating these topics on a regular basis. He didn’t even know Sherlock was interested in these kind of things. Or that he had ever though about them in the first place. It was highly unusual and John wondered exactly why they were having this conversation.
“Is this your chief concern?” John arches an eyebrow at him, his face open and accessible, and Sherlock feels like a schoolboy who had sneaked a pushpin onto the chair of his teacher and got caught out.
Sherlock shook his head, his shoulders tense and a small sound escaped his lips when he put his head down next to John’s, his lips very close to his ear.
John’s phone chimes twice before Sherlock has finished taking fingerprints from the stationery and feed them to the NSY database. It chimes again when Sherlock scrutinizes the velvet inlay of the box. John checks all three messages but only answers the first, leaving the other acknowledged but pending. His whole body language conveys a combination of nervousness and tiredness, his shoulders set in tense lines, when he dutifully announces that the data scan for the fingerprints has come up without any results. Which was to be expected, Sherlock guesses, still happily intrigued. Only fools make mistakes and so far his anonymous admirer doesn’t belong into that category. The whole thing is too well executed to be coincidental. However, Sherlock is no closer to cracking his mysterious Valentine’s Day present and it will presumably take at least 12 hours for Molly to define all the toxins in the foxglove petals, whether their presence is natural or not. When she tells him so, Sherlock feels an unexpected fit of generosity and points out that he is the one to make the next move now in this game, that the mystery is going nowhere and that, for now, he has other leads to follow. Out of the corners of his eyes he sees John glance at him.
John chuckles and his body shifts a little and loses most of his tension. There is mischief in his eyes now. “I wonder why that is, I am sure you’ve read all my mails to Sarah.”
“That- that was- John. Can we, can we do that again?” Sherlock hears himself whisper after an interminable amount of time when his mouth is done claiming John’s. He is panting slightly, his hands have found their way around John’s hips and John has tilted his body to accommodate his awkward position - his legs pressing into Sherlock’s right armpit, his kneecaps under Sherlock’s angled elbow so they can embrace, his back slightly curved inwards and his buttocks in the hollow between Sherlock’s semi-opened thighs. There is hardly any space left between them now and it’s elation and bliss and Sherlock’s is still filing away data into his mind palace for further dissection and replay. Every single snippet lodges somewhere to form interior, embellishment and shape, and while a completely new structure is being built, every detail forms half a dozen questions. Sherlock wonders how many of them are visible on his face as he looks at John again.
John has the twinkle back in his eyes when he says that, the emotional investment behind it clear and accessible. It makes Sherlock smirk and snuggle closer, accommodate where John’s strong arms come around him. They slide into a kiss again, chastely, and Sherlock has never before felt so complemented. He lets it all drift away – the case, the morning, the world – until nothing is left but the smell and taste of John and how his skin feels beneath Sherlock hands. If this game they’ve played for twenty-two days now - circling each other, occupying space in each other’s minds, while Sherlock has first curiously and then desperately tried to solve the mystery – if this all is indeed a game, then Sherlock has lost it, has lost himself thoroughly in this maze that is all John and the concept of
“But something went wrong,” Sherlock deduces. He knows John hates that, hates his expressive face and how Sherlock can use it against him but it’s obvious that something hasn’t gone according to plan for John. Sherlock is unpleasantly hit by the thought that John might have planned a Valentine’s date. With someone. Who
“You must be Dr. Watson, then. I have to tell you how I really enjoy that blog of yours. Although it is a little weird, seeing this junky filtered through your adoring eyes. My perception is wholly different.”
“The person who sent this to you,” John says, dipping his chin to indicate the box and its contents. He is standing in the doorway to the kitchen, one hand in the pocket of his jeans, the other between his hip and the wall. Both half-clenched into fists, expressive face cautious. “You really have no idea?”
He shook his head in mockery, feeling at ease when Sherlock turned to him with an incredulous expression on his face.
It’s basically unfocused pictures and blurred colors but there is this feeling of John’s presence around him - whispers of fingers over his achingly warm skin, brushes of hair along the sides of his face and flashes of startlingly deep blue eyes - and he’s sporting a bit of a bulge when he awakes a few hours later. If Sherlock has had any doubts regarding his sentiments towards John, this new turn of events quietly settles the matter. It’s not some weird new kind of platonic,
The kiss goes on for another moment before Sherlock finally flings hesitation and self-assessment to the wind and opens his mouth to make it less chaste.
The CD itself looks unscathed and Sherlock leaves his chair to put it into their stereo. He briefly wonders why they even have a stereo but John must have brought it with him when he moved in.
John reaches up and ruffles Sherlock’s hair affectionately. “You look sexy, all sleepy and rumbled. Debauched.” The last word is added for good measure and Sherlock’s heart is so full of fluttery affection for John, he squirms and doesn’t know what to do with the spare energy that surges through him every time John smiles at him.
“Don’t ever say that again. Ever! I absolutely love you, you know that? But I swear to you I will strangle you if you ever do--“
Cocking an eyebrow Sherlock closes in on Lestrade, thus effectively backing him into the kitchen. “Mrs. Hudson told me to just go upstairs?” Lestrade offers, rubbing his neck and Sherlock is pleased how easily, after all these years, he can still bully the man into defensiveness without much ado. He turns them around by striding to the kitchen window and out of the corners of his eyes he sees John dash upstairs to his own room. Unfortunately Lestrade sees, too, and a rummy look comes into his eyes. “What’s John doing in your room?” he demands, his eyes wide. Sherlock can detect the tiredness underneath, though.
Out of the corner of his eyes Sherlock sees John’s eyebrows first shoot up only to switch into a deep frown halfway. “It’s flowers,” he says, unhelpful. “Who’s sending you flowers?”
The sitting room proved to be clean of drugs, supplies and likely material and John also made sure there was nothing amiss in the bathroom. He had checked all of Sherlock’s secret little hiding places, behind books, in cupboards, behind that loose tile above the bathroom mirror. The kitchen seemed okay, too, but John was very aware of the fact that, if Sherlock really wanted to hide anything from him, he would without a doubt succeed. The time was ticking by and John, instead of growing calmer when his search didn’t turn up anything, grew increasingly restless. He dreaded having to go into Sherlock’s bedroom and only end up being thoroughly disappointed if he did dig up evidence. He knew how Sherlock, having had the whole day alone in their flat, had had enough time to get rid of compromising evidence. John just had the feeling he needed to make absolutely sure the flat was clean.
Sherlock closes his eyes, goes still and wills his body into calming. He can feel John do the same. The time for being lovers isn’t now but it will come into existence. Sherlock wants it to and secretly hopes it will be very soon.
Sherlock cleared his throat and his face looked very determined all of a sudden. He looked as if he was making a decision and when he finally reached it, his eyes turned very soft. He took another step towards John.
Outside the restaurant Sherlock fidgets with embarrassment and thoroughly berates himself for his lapse. He can’t believe he’s made such a fool out of himself because, clearly, John has noticed. He
“But I don’t have a plan, there was never—,” Sherlock says and realizes how it sums up his whole situation nicely.
The natural attraction between them, the little bouts of affection they show each other in everyday-life - a touch on the shoulder, a brush of fingers over tea mugs, hovering closer together over a file or the newspaper than the situation necessitates, a half-flirty smile when Sherlock is brilliant and John calls him so - it is undeniable. Life with John is just so interesting and comfortable, Sherlock muses, more comfortable that it has ever been with anyone. More comfortable than it had been with Victor, for whose affection he constantly had to battle only to spectacularly loose the fight and be left behind. In the secrecy of his mind Sherlock likes to entertain the thought that John will always be around. Sadly, it is also a fact that Sherlock isn’t sure John’s taste actually runs in his direction. They have spent so many years together and yet Sherlock is yet to secure ample proof of John’s general inclination. However, if it weren’t for the constant buzz in his guts that’s driving him round the bend, the constant yearning to reach out, grasp and hold close what he wants to be his, it wouldn’t actually matter. He’d take it all in stride while just being John’s friend if he could be sure John never leaves.
They had eaten pasta in bed, still naked and completely at ease with their company and when John had bent over Sherlock to kiss him again, new passion kindling in him, Sherlock had readily opened his arms and legs for him, his sweet little moans guiding the way to more delightful pleasure. They had made love with their hands and mouths, taking their time, exploring what they liked and what felt most intense. Sherlock had seemed unsure about how far John wanted to proceed with him but John had only shaken his head. There would be time enough for bolder approach later; for now he was contend with letting his tongue and fingers travel over Sherlock’s whole body in the need to find out what made him shudder most with pleasure. Sherlock, to John’s contentment, had been completely unafraid to do the same. They had left the bed afterwards to go to the bathroom and get themselves cleaned, only to return to bed as soon as possible, where Sherlock had fallen asleep in John’s arms.
Under different circumstances he would have structured the evening into singular timeframes and make sure to touch his legs to John’s within each frame whenever feasible and as much as he can get away with. Just so that John doesn’t notice a pattern. He would smile as often as possible - the real smile, the one he exclusively keeps for John that makes his features lax and the skin around his eyes crinkle handsomely - without being too obvious about it. He knows he looks favorable in candlelight because it casts alluring shadows around his eyes, tints his pale skin into a softer shade of cream and brings out his cheekbones. John has once admired his cheekbones, so Sherlock shamelessly shows them off as often as possible.
He’d felt immediately flushed and had safely retreated to being annoyed with himself. He’s fairly certain, though, even now as he stands next to Lestrade, that it won’t take long to suss is all out once John is back at 221B – Sherlock will dedicate it his whole and undivided attention.
Shrugging into his coat Sherlock sweeps down the stairs while John trails listlessly behind. “Don’t dally, John!” he orders and lifts a hand to hail the first cab he sees.
There it is again, the glance. Twice in just a few minutes. Sherlock notices he’s feeling hot again, increasingly hot and all his self-control just immediately goes out of the window.
Next to him John sits in brooding silence. It’s another three street corners until they will reach Baker Street and, briefly, Sherlock wonders if John will come upstairs home with him or whether he will disappear immediately to a pub or someone else’s place. But no, Sherlock considers, if that were the case John would have taken another car or the tube, if only just to escape the wretched atmosphere in the narrow confines of their cab.
Behind a clay-bricked storehouse, a dark figure beckoned to them. They followed it silently down a narrow alley, between two houses looming before a waxing moon. John felt an eerie shiver sliding down his back and took out his mobile to text Lestrade. But Sherlock stopped him by putting his hand over it, shaking his head and taking the phone out of his hands. John’s brow furrowed, his fingers tingling where Sherlock had touched them.
It stung, Sherlock working on a case without him. John was feeling increasingly insecure when their conversation went on.
They kiss and John gently tips him backwards against the counter, pushing upwards to even out their height difference. Sherlock gets absorbed into the pressure of John’s lips and tongue against his own and the feeling of his fingers playing with his curls. Just like he had in his chair. It’s exactly the same pull and it’s hilarious how good it feels.
They were in what appeared to be in a small office, no more than a few square meters, no windows, and hardly any space. Sherlock threw his shoulder into the door but it didn’t open.
“We don’t know who sent it,” John elaborates and Sherlock is a bit taken aback by the helplessness in his voice. If it wouldn’t be so completely far-fetched he’d say John…
Exhausted, he tumbles into an ottoman and harrumphs, his hand over his eyes - and just hates not knowing. He recalls how he first noticed John glancing and lines up all his memories about each and every incident, feelings and thoughts in chronological order. The memories parade in front of him, twirl and rearrange themselves to form new pictures, new motives. But none of them really tells him what
