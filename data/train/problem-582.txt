Sherlock shrugged, and John didn’t miss the way his eyes flickered quickly over his body before he turned and walked out of the room.
“What’s funny?” Sherlock questioned, his voice low and rough on the verge of sleep.
“Anything else, Your Majesty?”
Their return home was filled with some interesting adjustments to life in London and the flat in 221B Baker Street. They still needed two bedrooms, but there had been an internal shuffling around as John eventually moved into the downstairs bedroom and Rosie took up sole residence of the upper. All in all, it was a rather easy transition moving from friends to lovers. Sherlock still sulked and John took walks with Rosie when he needed air, and they both drank ridiculous amounts of tea. There were cases and clinic hours and Rosie’s wants and needs to be attended to. The day-to-day remained very similar to before. Except for the brush of lips when tea was passed, or a curly head laying in a lap when watching a film on the sofa, or no one claiming that a candle wouldn’t be necessary when they went out for dinner. On actual date nights.
He smiled, though, because he did appreciate the thought and he would have most likely had toast if she hadn’t intervened. He already felt his earlier aggravation fading away and instead just felt tired.
“Sherlock.”
John was walking at his usual pace, hands held loosely at his sides, as he made his way down the pavement. Londoners were out in droves thanks to the approaching holiday, crowding around storefronts and cafes, causing foot traffic to occasionally come to a standstill as people had to maneuver around.
“Rosie! Come in for lunch!” he called.
John dried his hands and after checking that Sherlock was okay, he walked out of 221B and made his slow way back to his bedit.
Then there he was, standing in front of John, eyes sweeping over him and clearly reading everything from his undone buttons to his pinkened lips. John barely kept himself from jumping off the couch.
He was enigmatic. Posh, and rude, and sexy as hell. John was completely off balance and caught up in the riptide that was Sherlock Holmes within minutes. The man took one look at him and read him like an open book. His military background, an alcoholic sibling, invalided. His damn psychosomatic limp. He made a casual comment about playing the violin and not talking for days, and would that bother John as potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.
“So what then? Why would you care what they think about me?”
John nodded his acceptance of the thanks. “Thanks for cleaning up. I was going to do it when I got back.”
“John, I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work and while I’m flattered by your interest,” he began, but John quickly cut him off with a mildly horrified expression on his face.
“Yes.”
Unfortunately this newest position put Sherlock’s head right beside John’s, and he was getting a face full of dark curls and some kind of honey scented styling cream. He couldn’t help the semi-unconscious impulse to lean in and breathe in the scent again, but Sherlock turned his head and caused the curls to tickle John’s nose.
“I didn’t want people making you uncomfortable, Sherlock.” John’s muffled voice came from behind his hands.
“Daddy! Papa! Look! He came, he came, he came!”
John found he didn’t mind these interruptions to his showers so much. He had begun to look forward to them and missed them when he managed to spend an entire shower alone. He was aware this wasn’t exactly normal flatmate behavior, but he also didn’t really care. He skirted the border of normal on a good day, and his flatmate showed up naked save for an Egyptian cotton bedsheet at Buckingham Palace. Normal was not a concern for them.
“Won’t happen again,” Sherlock promised as he swiftly turned and strode out of the kitchen.
I hope you enjoyed this second day at the beach! Kudos and comments are always appreciated and treasured as much as sea glass. 💜
“Yes, I can fucking see that,” he spoke, deadly calm and quiet.
“Can I help you, John?” Sherlock drawled, affecting as bored a tone as possible as his body attempted to react to John’s physical presence while Sherlock stood there completely nude for all intents and purposes. Sherlock felt a flush of blood rise to his face and cursed his transport for its unavoidable betrayals. Nudity had never bothered him before, not even in front of John, and this was getting to be unacceptable.
“Huh. Was that Shakespeare?”
“Fantasies are nice, but it’s really the execution of the fantasy that makes it fun,” Sherlock smiled.
“Is there something you wanted?” He called out as he filled fresh water into the kettle. He put it on the base and flicked it on before turning around, and this time he wasn’t surprised to find Sherlock right behind him again. John noticed the quick quirk of Sherlock’s lips as if in acknowledgement of John’s lack of surprise.
“Yes, and just imagine, next time you can just go upstairs and collapse on the mattress instead of jumping on the tube for a 30-minute ride below London.”
“I’m going to need five minutes if you don’t stop talking and let me finish.”
John breathed out slowly, his arm wrapping tightly around Sherlock, and his hand rested over his heart. Beneath his palm he felt the raised edge of a bullet hole. He closed his eyes and focused on the steady beat of the strong heart instead.
“I’ve always been partial to the fluffy kind. When you can make wishes,” he confided. “Childish, I know, but I like the idea of making a wish and blowing it away. Sending it off into the world and hoping it comes true.”
“Stop thinking. It’s fine. It’s all fine,” he says, and John feels something akin to relief wash over him at the statement. After that, the tension that had seemed to sit over their table broke, and they fell into their usual easy conversation and banter. John stopped thinking, and dinner went smoothly after that.
“Well, if you tell her, she’ll be less likely to fuss about it. She’ll do pretty much anything you ask,’ John wheedled.
“Friend?” he asked in disbelief.
“Who was your first...whatever?” John asked. If they were going to ask those kinds of personal questions, then there were plenty that John would like answers to.
A long, suffering sigh.
“That’s usually the point with a gift.”
“Oh, I’m so happy for you both. It’s about time, John, honestly.”
Sherlock abruptly stops and turns to John, eyes locking onto him again.
“Come on, girl, let’s do this thing before it gets any worse,” John said, and Joy jumped off the bed, landing lightly on her paws, and John smiled to see that her leg really was much better than when he found her.
He shifted closer to him, his knee knocking against his friend’s, and John turned to look at him. A smile lit upon his face with what could only be fondness and Sherlock returned it. Why not take this chance? He suddenly couldn’t come up with any of the reasons why this was a very bad idea while John smiled at him with that smile that rivaled the sun. When he finally said “yes” to the flat.
“Please, do tell me what brings you here, and try not to be dull,” he said swiftly, ignoring the small John-sounding voice in his head that told him to stop being rude.
“Don’t mention it, dear. Now what are you working on?” she asked as she lifted her cup of tea and settled into John’s chair.
He made his way out of the flat and out the door. He needed to meet John this evening to show him the flat, and he had things to do before that.
He liked this pub because it was within easy walking distance of Baker Street. It gave him time to stretch his legs and sober up a smidge, plus it had the added benefit of allowing him to reminisce in a causal way other walks he took on London nights.
A smile stretched slowly across John’s face and it rivaled the sun in its glory.
“Where on earth did someone find daffodils this time of year?” he asked the black stone with a frown. “They aren’t in any of the flower shops I’ve been to.”
Sherlock watched him hungrily, his eyes every bit as sharp and calculating as they were at a crime scene, and John felt nearly transcendent at being the recipient of that gaze. He took more of Sherlock into his mouth, letting his throat relax to prove to Sherlock that his fantasy could be reality. He didn’t stop until his nose was buried in the dark curls at the base of his cock and he breathed in the smell of the man, of Sherlock, there. He pulled back and off, then licked from base to tip as Sherlock watched him.
John shook his head. “Ok, well, let’s try again on the shoes so we can get down to the water.”
John laughed loudly, then quickly covered his mouth with his hand to stifle the sound. He didn’t want to wake his daughter.
It was pleasantly cool in the cinema to combat the warm evening outside, and the company was perfect for seeing a new film with. She was shy and rather quiet, and John had always thought that a date in a darkened room where you had to be quiet was good. There was no pressure to engage in conversation, and it was easy to slip a hand into your dates if you wanted.
John turned the tap off. He got out of the shower, grabbed a towel, and dried off. The whole time he wondered what exactly Sherlock seemed to be trying to not think about.
A huff of breath met this comment, then John’s soft tenor responded. “Sherlock and I...we aren’t together. Not like that.”
He held himself in check, though, just letting his mind and body float on the surge of desire and adrenaline. Sherlock had made it quite clear that he wasn’t interested and John needed to stop whatever foolishness his heart was attempting to pull him into. He was shaken from his reverie when there was an insistent knock on the door. John turned towards the door, a mix of grateful and annoyed at the distraction.
“Maybe if I wasn’t talking to you and wrapping at the same time. Have you ever had a conversation with you while wrapping?”
“It was nothing,” Sherlock mumbled. He wanted to ask John what happened at lunch. He didn’t want to know, though, not really. Was Mr. Campbell impressed when John told him? Was he grateful and pleased and looking forward to seeing John again?
Emotions flooded through John as he threw open the car door and climbed out without a backward glance, his heart thudding hard in his chest.
“Do shut up John,” he said and John smiled.
He found his trousers and pulled his mobile from his pocket, then crawled into the bed, pulling the duvet up with him, and fitted himself beside John who watched him curiously as he draped it over them both.
Sherlock watched as John shut his eyes with a soft, pained look on his face. He was about to stand up and demand to know what was being said, but then Alex leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss on the doctor’s cheek and Sherlock’s mind went completely blank.
“Ice cream!” she called out.
So why had John said no to the flatshare? He thought they had gotten on rather well, which was surprising in and of itself. They shared similar dark humour that was refreshing to find in another person. Yes, there was the moment of “a bit not good”, but surely that alone wasn’t enough to completely turn him off from sharing the flat.
“Did you take it?”
“Dance with me,” John’s voice was soft, but it wasn’t a question.
Sherlock turned to John, and John bit his lips down to keep the smile from his face. He raised his brows expectantly.
He wasn’t sure.
Salt and air and sand surrounded their little party of three. Crashing waves, gull cries, and the exhilarated exclamations of an excited three-year-old served as the soundtrack to a day filled with blue skies and bright sunshine.
John was fuming as he climbed the seventeen steps to 221B after his conversation, if it could be called that, with that slimy bastard Mycroft.
“Yes, but what did you mean?”
The refrigerator.
For some reason, that was what John latched on to.
Seeing as it was just two in the afternoon, he decided that today would be a good day for seeing the Colosseum. If he left now, he would be able to spend a couple hours there in the daylight, and then maybe walk around a bit.
“Find anything out about the case?” John suddenly asked with his head turned slightly in Sherlock’s direction, though his eyes remained facing forward, when they were about half a block from the restaurant.
“I wish we would have done this a lot sooner,” he admitted and John nodded.
“No?”
They reached out to grasp each other, hands tightened around hot, silky flesh as they chased their pleasure. John kissed down Sherlock’s jaw, his neck, and when he gently bit on the rapid pulse he found there, Sherlock cried out and John felt the heat of his release against his stomach and over his hand, and it tipped him over the edge and into the freefall of his orgasm as it washed over him.
Luckily, he was spared another verbal flummox as Angelo arrived at that moment, placing a beautiful dish of ossobuco on a bed of risotto in front of each of them, the enticing aroma wafting up from the plate filling his senses in the most pleasant way. He looked up to Angelo, who offered him a sly wink and a “buon appetito”, before leaving the two men alone again. John looked to Sherlock, whose eyes were still taking in the table before them and assigning meaning to everything, before meeting John’s eyes.
John went to take a sip of his scotch, but noticed that it was gone. He leaned over and placed the empty glass on the table in front of him.
“Bored. So bored.”
He started walking again, Joy leading the way, as Sherlock fell into step beside him again.
“Can I help you look for anything in particular?” the woman at the end of the aisle asked after John had looked up at her greeting.
“What’s different?” Sherlock demanded as the man took a moment to get his breath back.
“Goodnight, John.”
“I told you, those were for an experiment.”
“Oh,” she replied, the pleased and surprised tone back in her voice. “Well, then.” She smiled, then glanced at her cup. “Do you want a coffee?” she asked.
“A friend. Though Sherlock would likely call me an enemy,” he answered.
“Don’t I always?”
“I believe I heard her mention it once.”
John sat at his kitchen table, Joy’s head keeping him warm, his thoughts racing and driftless at the same time, as his tea went cold and untouched.
“I think you may have taken the ‘Deck the Halls’ saying a bit too far, Mrs. Hudson,” he commented wryly.
It was odd how something as random as burnt food could remind John of Sherlock. Well, perhaps not so odd, really. There was something about the whole process of cooking that reminded him of Sherlock. Cooking was almost like chemistry. Or, at least the chemistry that Sherlock had liked to practice in the kitchen. Experimenting with different flavors and techniques was similar to Sherlock messing about and creating whatever reaction he was looking for when he worked. It felt that way, anyway. It was almost like cooking was a way to remember Sherlock, even though it was something they had rarely done while they lived together.
“Ok. Truth or dare?”
John stared at it a moment before he reached out and took his hand in his own. His warm palm pressed against his, short fingers clasped tightly, then released after a quick shake.
Sherlock stared at him, those clever eyes of his flashing silver in the dark that surrounded them, and John let Sherlock see him. He wanted Sherlock to see that he was telling the truth. That he believed him and forgave him. It was important that Sherlock understand that.
Later, when he was washing the gunpowder residue from his hands, he reflected on the circumstances that had brought him to the point that on a daily basis he carried an illegal firearm with him. Reflected on the circumstances that led to today, and that he was grateful he did because he would kill to protect Sherlock Holmes. Without guilt or hesitation.
“Where’s that Christmas pickle?” John diverted.
“This ice cream really might be the best in Britain.”
“Of course, John, because the criminal classes of London make sure to take your date nights into account when committing crimes,” comes Sherlock’s snarky reply, following him down the stairs. He offers Sherlock a singular salute over his shoulder and makes his way out the door, then down the street to his date.
“I ordered Chinese for dinner. It should be here by the time you’re dressed,” he informed him, then he stood up and left.
John carefully let out the breath he didn’t realize he had been holding. Well, so much for not being awkward. John shook his head at himself and refused to look back at Sherlock, who had turned his attention away from John and back to the window as soon as he seemed satisfied that John had been thoroughly put in his place. He forced himself to eat another casual bite of the pasta that now felt and tasted like glue in his mouth. Sherlock suddenly perked up like a puppy who scented a new dog.
He chuckled. “Yes, it’s Christmas.”
John felt his lips quirk, but it wasn’t a smile, and the man didn’t seem to really notice or care. He quickly snapped the photo, then examined it. “Ah, there he is.” He zoomed in on the photo and showed it to John. “There’s our man.”
John sat quietly beside him the entire time, as Sherlock drank his tea, and slowly pulled back all those loose tethers of his sanity. Pulled them back in and tied them down. Sherlock had learned that tying them down was only temporary, but it was the best that he could do. His mind palace was no prison, and he couldn’t control the anxieties that took over and rained devastation on him. He couldn’t pinpoint specific triggers, couldn’t decipher a pattern, and after his return from Serbia, his return to a John that had moved on, his mind had taken advantage of him and occasionally tore him from his logic and threw him into insanity.
“We have more important things to do than worry about her right now. We need to-,” but John refused to be cut off right then.
“...”
“I know, darling, I heard the thunder,” he soothed.
“You didn’t. I was just thinking,” Sherlock quickly said.
“Is something wrong?”
He was shocked. They had been careful. John had always thought he wanted children, but the older he had gotten, he had accepted that it likely wasn’t going to happen for him. Figured it was probably for the best, actually. He wasn’t exactly the ideal candidate for fatherhood. And now it had and he was more conflicted than he had ever been in his life. Moments ago he had seriously considered annulment on the sliver of a chance that when Sherlock had said: “the two people who love you most in all this world” he meant that he loved John, truly loved him, and maybe Sherlock really could be his. Except he was going to be a father and he couldn’t leave. He couldn’t. He wouldn’t. His heart was breaking at the same time that it tried to soar.
“Yes,” Sherlock said simply. “Just holding you. Or you holding me.”
John finished his tea and set the empty mug in the sink. “I’m going to take a shower and then make dinner.”
“Yeah, he really is as clever as you say in your blog, isn’t he?”
“I don’t know. I suppose I’ll find out.”
John felt his stomach plummet to his feet.  Maybe they couldn’t move on from this as friends.
“I knew I was correct.”
Sherlock had driven them into the small town after dinner. Rosie talked non-stop the entire 20-minute drive about how she wanted to get an ice cream cone, not a cup, and definitely not an ice lolly, but ice cream. Chocolate. And hundreds-and-thousands. Rainbow hundreds-and-thousands. No, chocolate hundreds-and-thousands. No, rainbow, definitely rainbow.
Rosie watched both of them, tugging on their hands as they grinned at each other.
“So about that room?”
He called as soon as he had signal but could tell by the harried reply of the receptionist that today wasn’t going to be a good day for anyone.
“I know you do.”
“I may have given the last one to Rosie.”
“Going to sleep, John. It’s been a long day,” Sherlock replied nonchalantly, but his eyes took in the sight of John as he stood there and he felt himself grow harder under that look alone.
“I think Daddy and Papa might need coffee first.”
“Pick a real dare.”
Stroke. Curl. Uncurl. Scratch. Repeat.
Blunt fingers worked tenderly over his scalp, soothing the places where he had yanked and pulled mercilessly. Wrapped curls carefully over short digits before letting them unfurl. Repeating the motion again, and again, and again. Comforting. Reassuring.
Sherlock glanced at her, then nodded and made himself comfortable on the other side of the beach blanket from John. Long legs stretched out in front of him and he leaned back on his palms as he kept his eyes on his goddaughter.
John couldn’t keep up with Sherlock Holmes. Not with his leg and his tremor and his brokenness. He was broken, he knew that, and there was no use denying it to himself.
Except that he wasn’t just washing dirty dishes. John was standing at the sink, swaying slightly side to side, and Sherlock could tell his eyes were closed as he scrubbed a plate clean. The song had changed from when he had first come in and now that he was closer Sherlock could hear John singing along to the unfamiliar song.
John leaned into the kiss, parting his lips and carefully pulling Sherlock’s bottom lip between his own as he sunk his fingers into his dark curls. Sherlock made a soft noise of approval and when John felt the gentle pressure of Sherlock’s tongue against his lip he gladly opened his mouth to let him in. Tongues met and slid hotly against each other and they both groaned. Sherlock tasted of the merlot and chocolate mousse from their pudding that evening. His hands moved from John’s face to his shoulders, then down his arms and around his back, pulling him closer on the bench. It wasn’t exactly comfortable, but John didn’t care. He lost himself in the kiss, the press of tongues and lips, and the nip of teeth. They stayed like that for minutes or hours. John didn’t know or care and would have continued that way, happily snogging like teenagers, except that the clouds that had left seemed to have made their reappearance. The sky opened up and heavy drops of rain fell without regard for their incredibly intimate and life-changing moment.
Both men turned at the sound and John watched as an attractive man with silver hair came into the flat without knocking, his gaze fixed on Sherlock.
John shrugged. “If you say so.”
Sherlock was completely bare now. John stared at him, drinking in the sight before him from his knees, and Sherlock was surprised when an unexpected shyness stole over him.
Sherlock was struck by the sincerity in John’s statement. He knew John had been in a very low place when they had met. He had deduced the service pistol he kept and how often John’s mind likely turned towards using it one last time. He knew things had been better for John after they met and became flatmates. Friends. When he pulled John into the Work he saw the positive influence it made on the struggling veteran, the damaged doctor. Then he had jumped off a building and ruined everything in a bid to save John’s life. He hadn’t known what his leaving would do to John, but he wasn’t exactly surprised when his return was met with John’s fist, though it wasn’t ideal.
He swallowed hard, eyes locked on Sherlock’s hand that had stopped brushing at crumbs, but hadn’t moved away.
She nodded as she pulled out the seat across from him at the table and settled down into it. She apparently was not going to go away as he had hoped. He took up his fork to eat a few more bites while she sipped her tea.
“Everything. Anything. I’m yours,” John promised, and Sherlock had to close his eyes against the sincerity in his voice, in his midnight eyes.
Sherlock smiled at that, seemingly pleased at being considered a friend. They both took sips of the wine, which was actually very good, and John made a mental note of the label on the bottle to purchase a bottle for the flat. Maybe they could share a bottle for Christmas.
A quick bath with as many bubbles as Rosie could ever wish for, then snuggly PJs, and Rosie was tucked into the soft pink sheets and duvet with her new rabbit held safely in her arms. He heard the shower running as he read her a bedtime story, and as usual one story turned into three, which was why he was still reading when Sherlock finished with his shower and came into the room just as John put down the last book.
“That’s good, then.” And it was. That Sherlock had people he trusted was good. It didn’t mean that Sherlock didn’t trust him. It meant that Sherlock had been worried about John’s safety, and not his ability to keep a secret or trust his decisions.
“You want what?”
“Everything,” he declared, simple and definitive. His heart hammered behind his breastbone at the admission. It was what he wanted, anything and everything John would give, and it was for John to decide what that meant. If John would accept it. Accept him. Accept everything.
John looked over at his date and felt a momentary flash of guilt. He was going with Sherlock. It was obvious to everyone in the room, and she was staring at him with an incredulous look on her face as he went to grab his jacket.
“If you insist.”
He didn’t like the feeling of sitting in a taxi anymore. Of trusting that the person driving him will actually get him to his destination instead of something far more sinister now that he would inevitably be alone whenever he would travel. And honestly, the idea of driving made his stomach twist uncomfortably. He had never seen the point in learning to drive when he lived in a city with (mostly) reliable public transport and when he was in the RAMC there had been no need for him to drive, either.
A rush of cooler air preceded John’s re-entrance into the room, followed by the snick of the door as the latch closed again, the soft clink of a mug placed down on the sink. A warm palm cupped his jaw, a thumb brushing over his cheekbone, before retreating again. Cupboard doors were opened and items removed as he continued to sit silently, eyes closed, drifting in body and mind.
He forced himself to stand and ready the kettle for a cup of tea. He packed up the detritus of his lunch as the water came to a boil. While the tea steeped he tried to think about what he needed to do for the rest of his shift. What patients he had coming in and if there were any supplies he needed to be restocked in his exam room or in his office.
“My grand-mère used to sing it to me when I was a boy,” Sherlock said and John turned to look at him.
He trudged up the last few stairs and walked up to his open bedroom door to find Mrs. Hudson, headphones on, attaching garlands to his window pane. There was no wonder he didn’t hear his earlier call for her. The music was blaring through the headphones and he could clearly hear it from across the room.
It had evolved from those early days, where the sight of Sherlock running after a suspect or deducing a crime scene sent a thrill through him that he convinced himself was just excitement from having something better to do than sit in an abysmal bedsit on the outskirts of London. That the man himself had little to do with it, it was just the environment that he led him to. It helped that Sherlock had stated in no uncertain terms that relationships were not his area, that he was married to his work, and John was able to nod and say ‘It’s all fine’ and mean it.
Sherlock knew. Somehow, Sherlock knew about the flowers he had left, and knew the meaning behind them. He felt an odd mix of vindication and overwhelming embarrassment. Vindication because he had always liked to think that Sherlock would have been able to read John’s messages through the flowers and embarrassment because of the messages he had left. Not that he was embarrassed about his feelings, of course. There was nothing embarrassing about being in love with a man and he felt no shame in that. The embarrassment was in not having been able to express that until after that man had died and taken his heart with him. There was shame in cowardice, John felt, and he had been a coward in so many ways when it came to his feelings for Sherlock.
At his wedding, Sherlock said he loved him. In front of a room full of people and his brand new wife, and John had cried. The tears hadn’t left his eyes, but they were there, burning behind his eyelids and he had stood and pulled Sherlock into a hug because what else could he do? He was married.
“White Lipped snail,” Sherlock’s voice came from the doorway behind them and Rosie squealed and ran up to him, proudly displaying her find. Sherlock examined it with all the intensity that he examined most things. “Well done, Watson.”
The thought flitted through his brain, and then he laughed out loud at his reflection.
“You said a mean word,” she informed him solemnly, and Sherlock turned his expression to appear properly apologetic for his misdeeds.
“I missed you, too,” John replied honestly. It was nice to hear that Sherlock had missed him, but he couldn’t help feeling that that hadn’t been what Sherlock had originally meant to say.
Sherlock grinned at that and John responded with his own grin.
He hardly felt the first pull of the blade against his cheek. John was confident, precise, methodical in his shaving. Sherlock trusted him completely. He trusted John's surgeon hands; his soldier hands. The hands that could save a life with a scalpel or end it with a gun.
This was dangerous, and wasn’t that the essence of their entire relationship?
“Yes.”
The man didn’t look at all impressed or surprised by his comment. “You miss the war, Dr. Watson. When you walk beside Sherlock Holmes you see the battlefield,” he intoned as if John had never spoken.
“Pardon?!”
“What?”
“Fuck you, Mycroft. What do you want?”
“Come on, have a seat.”
“Why did you change it?”
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude. It’s just a bit surprising to find a man who can cook these days,” she said and John shrugged.
“Yes, and you forget to eat and keep eyeballs in microwaves,” John chuckled and Sherlock shrugged unapologetically.
“I’d understand if you wouldn’t. We don’t have to marry to be together.”
“Are you sure? Because it’s going to be rather disappointing, I think. I haven’t even bought crackers.”
He trudged up the stairs juggling his remaining bags and the plate of cellophane-covered biscuits, and sighed as he entered the icebox that was supposed to be his warm flat. There was no sound coming from the radiator and he really didn’t have the time or the patience to bother trying to fix it now. He was too tired and didn’t want to deal with the blasted thing, and he wasn’t going to bother Mrs. Hudson since it was too late to bring someone in to properly see to it at this hour.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not in those exact words,” he hedged. He didn’t want to explain the flowers to Mrs. Hudson right now. Or maybe ever. It had been something he did for Sherlock and he didn’t think he wanted to tell anyone else. There was something about it that just belonged to him, and he supposed to Sherlock as well. “But believe me, he knows. He doesn’t feel the same and that’s okay.”
“They might be a bit long, but they’ll work,” Sherlock proclaimed, but John caught the hint of shyness in his tone.
“Yes, of course. I’ll be right there.”
“Almost. Give me a minute.”
Alex turned to leave without a further word. Sherlock sat at the table, still pretending to be focused on anything other than John, while his mind whirled. John stayed where Alex left him without moving. Sherlock simply watched him, his mind trying to figure out and decipher exactly what he saw, but his brain refused to acknowledge the information. In any other person, Sherlock would see what he saw and deduce the obvious past relationship that ended with hurt on both sides. But that didn’t make sense here. John wasn’t gay. John couldn’t have been in a relationship with another man. Therefore, what he saw wasn’t what he saw. So what did he see?
“You honestly thought we would be okay thinking you killed yourself?” John asked, disbelief and anger coloring his voice despite his attempt to keep it level.
“Did you know about John?” he asked her and the way she bit her bottom lip told him more than her words ever could have.
“Of course it is,” he laughed as Sherlock raised his arm and a taxi came to a stop in front of them.
Sherlock brought John into the room, then closed the door. He stepped close behind John and wrapped his arms around him. His warm hands went under his shirt, fingers scraped gently over his skin, and he shivered as Sherlock’s breath tickled his ear.
“Well then. You should head back and pack up. If you hurry up, you could be ready to move in by tonight.”
“John, I will forgive you for making the assumption that I would ever delete the Bard.”
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” he called out as he stuck his head back out of the kitchen. His friend was still sitting on the couch. He seemed lost in thought.
The sudden thought of Bill Murray, a man who Sherlock had previously thought of for maybe 3 seconds after seeing his name on one of John’s blog posts, now sent a shock through his system. Had John ever been with Murray? Or were they really only old Army comrades? He shifted his feet slightly, suddenly very uncomfortable with the thought that John had been out with what could have potentially been an old flame. It wasn’t a fair thought to have. He had no claim on John, but this wasn’t exactly a new or astonishing reaction. He often hated the thought of John spending time with anyone who wasn’t him.
John was aware that he might not just be talking about Mrs. Hudson anymore, but he also couldn’t stop.
Twenty more minutes passed before the door to the restaurant opened, and John looked up. He rose to his feet, a smile that he hoped wasn’t as nervous as he expected it was pulling at his lips.
Sherlock was biting on his bottom lip again and John’s eyes went to his mouth before looking back up at him.
The sound of bags and boxes being opened in the kitchen drifted down the hallway into the bathroom. The fridge door opened, then closed. The click of the kettle as it turned itself off. Soft thumps of two mugs set down on the tabletop. He let himself slip further under the hot water, over his clavicle, his neck. His eyes drifted closed as he breathed in the lavender-scented steam, the gentle lap of the water as he shifted his body, resettled.
“So?”
“Triple murder. Locked room. Should be a good one,” he explained, a rather inappropriate smile on his face for someone discussing murder. John found his own smile stretching across his mouth in response, though, his heartbeat starting to race in anticipation of what was to come.
“Swing me, please!” she corrected, then ran forward and John and Sherlock pulled up their arms a bit to allow her a moment of airtime, legs kicking wildly, before bringing her back down where she giggled. “Again, again!”
“Have a seat, Dr. Watson,” the man offered coolly as John came to a stop a couple of meters away from him. “Your leg must be bothering you.”
“It was you,” he said in disbelief. “It was you, wasn’t it?”
Sherlock couldn’t help the smirk that rose to his lips, but it quickly turned to a real smile. Mrs. Hudson was one of the few people who ever earned that smile from him, and he couldn’t always hold it back when it came to her. She doted on him as if he were her son, and he supposed he did rather view her as the endearing auntie that one sometimes grew more affectionate to than their mother. All the doting and none of the discipline. Not that she didn’t occasionally try to discipline him, but she never could hold to her guns when it came to it. John, however, was another matter. She was just as affectionate, but she often seemed to expect more from John than from himself. He batted the thought away. If he wanted to get anything done this morning he needed to stop letting his mind wander, especially when it turned towards John.
It had taken three bedtime stories, a private violin concerto, multiple promises of waking her if anyone heard a single bell from a reindeer-drawn sleigh, and finally the reminder that she actually had to go to bed if she expected Father Christmas to come at all for presents for her.
They turned to look at each other, small smiles pulling at both of their mouths as they spoke simultaneously.
“Is that the case? The pink lady’s case?”
It was a small party. Lestrade had arrived alone, but Molly had shown up with her new beau, who Sherlock actually seemed to approve of, and Mrs. Hudson was there, of course. Mike and his wife had come and were currently enjoying the gin-heavy cocktail. John poured a glass of the wine that Greg brought for the DI and for himself and made his way around the room as Rosie entertained everyone with stories about elves and Saint Nick.
He took a sip from his nearly empty wine glass, fingers tapping thoughtfully on his phone. No missed texts. If it was a case, surely Sherlock would have messaged him. In fact, John was fairly positive that Sherlock took any case he could if it timed well with one of John’s dates, even the ones, and twos. He had too much proof to go on. So why hadn’t he texted? Was he in trouble?
Purple violets. Red roses. Pink tulips. Peruvian lilies. Baby’s breath. Forget-me-nots. Camellias in several colors. Daffodils and chrysanthemums. Other blooms he couldn’t name because he hadn’t ever seen them before. He had never seen so many flowers outside of a garden or flower shop in his life and here they all were, filling his living room with their delicate brilliance.
It lasted for about fifteen minutes before John’s attention was pulled away yet again, and he let out a half-chuckle that was a blend of fond and exasperated. Sherlock had just run past the window again, coat flying out behind him, and the pieces finally clicked together in John’s head. He looked towards his date, her sweet smile, and easy laugh, and gave his head a small shake. He began the lines of apology that were now just an accepted part of his dates, indicating to their waiter that he needed to go, and he pulled out his wallet and paid for their meals. She was understanding if slightly confused as to why their date was ending so abruptly, and John felt the smallest hint of regret, but he promised a second date which she agreed to, and he took off out the door, leaving her at the table.
He heard other customers come and go as he browsed through the mystery section and even picked up a couple new titles that he hadn’t read before. He hadn’t really made the time to read any kind of fiction lately. It had all been newspapers and medical texts. Once he even read through one of Sherlock’s old chemistry textbooks. Perhaps it was time to read something a bit more fantastical, even if it was just a murder mystery. He hadn’t read one in a while since Sherlock had made a habit of ruining them for him by guessing the killer before John had a chance to get even halfway through the story. He thought briefly of the fact that Sherlock wouldn’t be able to ruin the ending for him anymore, and a wave of confused emotions rushed through him. Sadness, grief, anger, and an absurd amount of fond affection.
“We’re both clean. I know you just had a panel done,” Sherlock confessed, and John laughed against him again.
“Come on. What am I thinking about?” John challenged.
“Oh, it’s no problem, dear. I know you two don’t have any room up there,” she said as she pulled biscuits from the oven. “Get anything good today?”
“Truth or dare?” Sherlock asked.
“If you keep talking like that I’m going to come,” John confessed and Sherlock chuckled before giving one more squeeze and letting go.
“I do want to.”
And John rather liked the idea of moving forward, knowing that Sherlock was going to be there beside him.
John paused and put his knife down as he finished slicing the last mushroom. He had thought Sherlock had spoken to Mrs. Hudson about all of this, but perhaps he was wrong.
One of the tears that had been stinging behind his eyes fell and landed on John’s shirt, soaking through the fabric, and he realized that it was just the first of many tears that would break free.
The sun had gone down while he was inside and took whatever meager warmth it had provided during the day with it. He shoved his hands in his coat pockets and briefly wished he had thought to grab his scarf that morning before he left for work, but no matter. He had begun to walk towards the nearest tube station, his thoughts fluttering from one topic to the next, when he found himself standing in front of a small bookshop. The window display was filled with different books. A biography, some new fiction titles, some teenage vampire or werewolf book by the looks of the cover, and a cookbook.
“Because you don’t look like you’ve been out dancing,” John responded.
He found himself in front of the array of candles on their tray and his eyes gazed over the candles that were currently lit, their small flames flickering their orange glow over the area. Muscle memory had him reaching out for an unlit matchstick, borrowing the flame from a previously lit candle, and he sought out an unlit wick. He held his matchstick to the fresh votive and thought of Sherlock while the wick bloomed to life before him. Removing the matchstick, he blew the flame out, then turned his attention back to the candle he had lit.
“To help carry a box,” John replied and Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Well if you don’t want to come then I’ll just move in tomorrow,” he continued, and Sherlock stood up abruptly.
“And?” John questioned.
“Oh. No. He wouldn’t answer my texts.”
Sherlock pulled the spinner of doom closer to him and managed a lazy flick with his long fingers. “Right hand green. Why does my right hand have to keep moving?” he complained as he shifted his body again and managed to get his hand on the circle beside John’s foot.
John chuckled, took a sip of his wine, and turned to look back up at the sky again.
“Mm,” John confirmed with a nod, unable to answer as his mouth was full of the creamy sauce and chicken.
“Thank you,” Sherlock murmured as he took a careful sip of the hot beverage. He hummed in appreciation. “Perfect, John, as always.”
Sherlock made the mistake of hesitating a moment too long, and before he could even respond, his brother spoke again.
“John, we’ve had sex hundreds of times,” Sherlock pointed out.
“I asked because I was thinking about Christmas. It kind of snuck up on me after everything, and it’s soon. I thought you might like to see if anyone had plans or wanted you to visit. It’s just Joy and me this year and we don’t have any plans beyond the takeaway I’ll order if Mrs. Hudson doesn’t ‘accidentally’ cook up a whole meal for the freezer, which she likely will, despite going to her sister’s for the holiday and not needing to cook.”
Once in dry clothes, he wasn’t sure what to do. Should he go and try to talk to Sherlock? Did he need to apologize? Sherlock had said he loved him, but that didn’t mean he wanted a physical relationship. If he didn’t, then...that would be okay. John would accept it, of course. He’d find a way to make it work. Actually, it wouldn’t be any different than the way he’d been living since Mary left. He had his life with Sherlock and cared for Rosie, and didn’t want anything else. He hadn’t dated or gotten a leg over in the three years since, which probably said more about how far gone he was on Sherlock than anything else would have.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. For everything.”
Sherlock felt the blood rush to his face and cursed his anatomy for the tells he couldn’t always hide, like the blush he knew stretched up the back of his neck and rose into his cheeks. Damnit. He had used John’s laptop, hadn’t he? He needed to delete the history as soon as John left.
“Two months. Then the what. What made you think about sex? Something in the room? A memory? A scent? Could be any of the above or none.”
“Oh no, dear, these aren’t for you. They’re for Joy,” Mrs. Hudson informed him before plucking a biscuit off the plate and holding it out for Joy, who took it eagerly.
“Pity, we could have split the fee. Think it through next time,” Sherlock replied before biting back a smile.
“Go on,” he instructed, and John went back to work. Two stitches went in and John was finished. Efficient and painless. He cleaned up everything, packed his kit back up, then sat still for a moment. Sherlock watched him as he leaned back into the soft red chair he had been perched in.
“Not always,” Sherlock corrected him, and John nodded thoughtfully, though Sherlock couldn’t see it.
(See the end of the chapter for
John let out a sigh of relief. Oftentimes it seemed like employees hounded after him whenever he ventured into stores, so it was a nice change of pace to be allowed to simply wander up and down the shelves.
“Do we have any candy canes?”
“You can’t grab me, that’s cheating!” He called out as Sherlock kept a hold of his ankle and twisted his body.
“Perhaps not, but I have something to say to you.”
Apparently, Mrs. Hudson had gone shopping. There was a large dog bed on the floor near his armchair, along with some kind of bright red dog toy. He placed the dog down and she made her way over to the bed, sniffing interestedly at the toy before giving it an investigative lick.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock spoke quietly into the distance between them.
“It’s always been you, Sherlock,” John's voice came out muffled from where he had turned his head into Sherlock’s neck.
He picked up his string of deductions, and when the DI couldn’t produce the woman’s suitcase, he was frustrated. There had to be a suitcase! If they didn’t have it, then who did? It had to be…
The sounds of John puttering about in the kitchen fell into silence and he laid there for several more minutes before he pushed himself up and off the bed. He shoved off his sleep trousers and pants, letting the cool air in the room dry his skin. He yanked his sheet off his bed since it would need to be washed anyway and wrapped it around his shoulders. There was no point in getting his dressing gown dirty, after all. With his sheet wrapped carelessly around him, he threw open his door and nearly walked right into John who, for some unknown reason, stood at his door with his hand half-raised to knock on the now open door.
Sherlock’s lips quirked up slightly in the corner at that, giving him an almost shy expression that John found completely charming.
“You seem to be in a better mood,” John said with a smile.
The shadow that had been following him doggedly since his day had begun took its opportunity to start clawing its fingers into his mind. He swallowed convulsively around the lump that formed in the back of his throat as his thoughts started to spiral out, but his mouth had gone dry. Chest tight, he kept his pace and tried to focus on the steady tread of his legs on the pavement. The cold air on his face. Blaring horns and angry shouts, crying babies in prams and the screech of tires as traffic slowed yet again. Anything to focus on but the shadow that lurked and prodded his defenses, searching for a way in, any weakness.
'Twas the season, and all. Biscuits for breakfast was perfectly acceptable.
He dropped Sherlock’s gaze for a moment, forced himself to take a deep breath before he met his friend’s eyes again.
The sound of Sherlock’s soft curses and pants and groans filled the air as John worked him open with his tongue. He felt the muscle give and John pressed his tongue into Sherlock, tasting him, and Sherlock pushed shamelessly back into him, seeking his pleasure and John thought he could do that forever.
Perhaps that was why Sherlock hadn’t wanted help with sunblock and needed a moment alone before coming in. John had carried his scar for longer than Sherlock and still felt a modicum of self-consciousness when revealing it in public places. It made sense that he might have needed a moment to himself before he removed his armour and allowed others to see what he hid. Sherlock often liked to pretend that he was above such things, his body merely transport and all that bullshit, but John knew Sherlock better than that. The man was a riptide. He appeared placid and calm on the outside, but inside he was churning with more emotion than John had ever seen in anyone.
For someone who so quickly shot him down, Sherlock keeps managing to ruin all of John’s dates. This wasn’t the first date that Sherlock had come barreling into with demands and pleas and reasons for why the date must be cut short this instant. Sherlock had managed to break up nearly all of John’s dates and was the cause of more than one eventual breakup when John had managed to convince a woman that a relationship with him would be worth the trouble of dealing with his roommate. Apparently, it never was worth it, in the end.
“I can’t believe you have a tattoo of...” John quickly scrambled on top of Sherlock and stopped him with a kiss.
John huffed and turned his eyes away from Sherlock, unable to look at him anymore.
“I have absolutely no idea why you’re telling me this, why you think I could possibly care, or why you’re here.”
Oh, he’s desperate. Sherlock hesitated a moment, his gaze flickering to John again before he turned back to the silver-haired man and nodded. “I’ll follow behind. Where at?”
Looking back, John was unable to pinpoint exactly when it was that Sherlock began to follow him into the loo when he was showering. He remembered being outraged the first time. He had just started to wash his hair, working his cheap shampoo through the short strands, when the door he had definitely closed was flung open, banging against the wall with a crack like a gunshot, and the madman’s voice was raised to be heard over the sound of the water in what could only have been a continuation of the conversation they had the previous night about a case they were working.
“Married to my work,” Sherlock repeated and John looked away from him.
Another moment of confusion followed this question, but then he remembered his earlier ruse and shrugged. “It was nothing. Not important,” he said.
“Could you drop me off at Baker Street first?” he asked, and she nodded. “Any chance you could not tell your boss?”
Sherlock seemed to sense his hesitation, his refusal of the room, but before either of them could speak Mrs. Hudson came bursting out of her flat in a tizzy.
“Those look great.”
John shook his head at his friend. “Fine, we can have ice cream and lunch, then go down to the beach,” he said with a smile.
Fingers traced over his cheekbones, his jaw, before John’s clever hands reached the back of his head and cradled his skull. Short fingers carded through his curls and he let out a sigh of pleasure without input from his brain. When he opened his eyes John had a nearly hypnotized look in his eyes, like he couldn’t believe the sight in front of him was real.
“It was necessary, John. She doesn’t want apologies or excuses.”
The man glanced around quickly as if he was looking for someone else before he finally sat down. Perhaps he read John’s blog and was wondering where he was. Didn’t matter. John wasn’t there and Sherlock had no idea when he would return.
Sherlock smiled before he tucked his cold feet under John’s warm thigh.
“Go read something.”
“Sherlock...I’m not asking anything of you. It’s important that you know that. You love Rosie, and that’s what’s important to me. That you’re in her life. In my life.”
John swallowed his bite, glancing at her as his mind tried to recall her name. She was new, he knew that much. He had finally memorized the names of his other co-workers thanks to the sheer amount of time spent with them working a steady job.
“About sex?” John asked, unable to hold back the question.
Another name that he really had no reason to write down, for several reasons, but he liked seeing his friend’s name written in his hand. His name looked good on the list of those important enough to consider buying gifts for.
“You want this,” he says, not quite a statement or a question, his voice full of wonder. Jesus, Sherlock wanted this. Wanted him. His eyes were scanning all over his friend’s face in awe.
“What’s your tattoo of?”
Sherlock turned back towards him, a slightly skeptical expression on his face, and John arched his brows. “What?”
“You didn’t promise chocolate ice cream,” Sherlock replied, eyes slanted at him, a playful smile on his lips and John giggled again.
The dog turned to look at him, tail picking up speed as if in recognition of the moniker, and she hobbled over to him. John bent down to scratch behind her ear and she leaned into his hand, the picture of contentment.
“John.”
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” he spoke against his lips before he leaned back and lay down again.
“Despite what you seem to think, I can tell when two people are attracted to each other,” Sherlock asserted as he forced himself to remain calm in the face of John’s rising frustration.
His hands traced up the strong thighs from his knees and John felt Sherlock’s muscles jump at the touch. His thumbs traced the crease between inner thigh and groin. Sherlock’s eyes were locked on his hands and John watched as his cock twitched in anticipation, which sent a jolt of arousal to his own groin. He bent his head and nuzzled into Sherlock, breathing in his scent at the base of his cock. He heard as much as felt Sherlock groan, and his eyes traveled up the long body until their gaze met. Eyes locked, John’s tongue came out and licked up his length. The look on Sherlock’s face was almost enough to have him coming right there. He closed his eyes and took Sherlock’s glans into his mouth, tasting and sucking softly, and hummed in appreciation when Sherlock’s hips bucked up against his will. He pinned his hips down with his right forearm and brought his left hand up to cup Sherlock’s balls, gently kneading and rolling them between his fingers. Sherlock’s breathing was quick and the sounds coming out of him were making John wild with desire.
He turned and made his way to his bedroom while John pulled out his mobile to call the Thai restaurant that was on his speed dial. The one near Baker Street, not the one near his bedsit, to place their usual order. Their usual order, because they were so often together and sharing meals and this space. He let the smile come to his face then as he closed the door to his room to take a quick shower and change.
“Why do you think I was chasing someone? I just got here,” Sherlock answered, and John knew his face showed his disbelief.
The mistletoe hung from the ceiling above them as they both leaned in for another kiss.
John let out a small laugh as Sherlock no doubt intended for him to do at his comment. Sherlock gave the smallest of smiles in return.
It was a lovely day, mild and sunny, and he enjoyed walking around. He wasn’t even annoyed with the sound of his cane tapping against the stones as he walked. He stopped several times, pulling out his camera and snapping photos of the inside, before he finally made his way outside about an hour later.
He gave himself a small shake and forced himself back to the present. He nodded his chin towards the table. “Lunch is ready,” he said, stating the obvious, but he was too pleased with how steady his voice came out to care.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mrs. Hudson followed his gaze as he looked at the dog and she gave a small smile.
When John put his empty tea mug down, Sherlock put his down as well. Then John gave a sigh.
“Sherlock! What are you doing here?” He did grab at his half-open shirt and started hastily redoing the buttons.
Sherlock entered behind him and took Rosie towards the bathroom to clean her up and get her to use the toilet before her nap. John made his way into the kitchen and a few moments later Rosie came running from the loo and grabbed his legs. “Up, Daddy! Kisses before nap!”
“Is that a tattoo?” Sherlock suddenly asked, and John quickly turned around and grabbed the blanket hanging off the couch.
Luckily for John, his date had the same opinion, and in no time at all, they were sitting on the couch snogging in front of some kind of documentary or something. It really didn’t matter. What mattered was that she was warm, arms wrapping around his shoulders and kissing him back eagerly, and he was quite enjoying himself. The phone in his pocket continued its vibrating buzz, but he continued to ignore it for much more interesting matters.
The dog whined and licked his palm in reply and John sighed to himself.
“No, it’s my turn. Truth or dare?”
They were both silent as they ate and drank their tea.
Sherlock’s brows arched up at John’s angry tone.
A half step put him firmly in John’s space. His hands came up and rested on either side of John’s face, and Sherlock saw those deep blue eyes widen, watched as the pupils dilated as his gaze dropped to Sherlock’s mouth before returning to his eyes. John’s tongue darted out against his bottom lip and that was all the confirmation he needed.
“Oh, well that was nice of her. Do you want to watch a movie after dinner?”
“No reason. I wanted to see what else was on. What about this one, then?”
“What luck, then! Sherlock brought you a muffin,” he called down to her, and she jumped up from her place in the sand where she had been examining something and ran over to them.
Where Sherlock was standing John could clearly see the scar from Mary’s bullet to his heart. It was a nearly perfect circle with its raised edge and slightly puckered skin reaching towards its center. Across one shoulder was a raised rope-like scar, one of a few that criss crossed his back, from his time spent imprisoned in Serbia. John had seen them before when he cared for Sherlock after he was shot. Sherlock had given him the story of where they came from with a blank face and haunted eyes. John had reached out and pulled him into a gentle hug, mindful of the scar his wife had added to Sherlock’s body, and they had never spoken of it again. Not the scars, or the torture, or the hug. Not the way John had buried his nose in Sherlock’s curls and breathed him in or the way Sherlock had tucked his face into John’s neck and the feel of hot tears soaking through his shirt and into his skin.
He nodded at his own thought, then glanced at the woman still on her phone beside him.
John smiled again, then stood up. “So what biscuits did you bring me today?”
“So you said. You still need to tell her something.”
“If having Mycroft as a brother-in-law is the price to pay for being your husband, then I’ll gladly pay it.”
John hesitated, eyes going between the cane in his hand and him, but before he could say anything Mrs. Hudson came out of her flat, completely flustered and worried about something. They all glanced up at the sound of something falling in the flat upstairs, and Sherlock bounded up the steps two at a time until he made it to the door and saw more of NSY than he ever wanted to see, especially when they were all crowded in his flat.
Sherlock turned his back on him and took several steps away. Good question. Where was this coming from? Sherlock wasn’t quite sure why he was so flustered. Why it was all surfacing now.
The mug warmed his chilly hands, the boozy scent of rum and the spicy cinnamon of the drink filled his nose. Eggnog. He smiled contentedly as John sat down beside him.
“True. I got rid of it.”
“Just up there, please,” she instructed its placement, and John followed directions rather than argue with her that he didn’t need or want the decoration in his room. Few things were worth the argument with the woman. She was older, but she was formidable. Bad hip, or no.
John sighed. Well, he was already standing in the water up to his neck. Sherlock had wanted to tell him something...he held onto the hope that what he wanted to say was in line with what John hoped to hear. That what he was about to say would let him swim instead of drown. A hand reached out and he let his fingers gently twist around a single curl near Sherlock’s ear. If that was to be the only chance he ever had to do so, then he wanted to at least know what those curls felt like. They were soft.
John stared at him with his head cocked to the side as he slowly blinked.
“Yes, perhaps that’s for the best.”
“Yes, yes, I know. Chocolate. Sherlock, did you know she wanted chocolate?”
It would likely snow by the evening. He could feel it sitting heavy in the air around him, in the tips of his cold fingers that he tapped insistently against each other. He shoved his hands in his pockets as he realized he was fidgeting, but the action continued in the depths of the warm material.
Another moment of silence passed and John had never been so thankful for how loud the water groaned through the pipes of their flat. Almost there…
“Rosie asked for snow so I gave her snow.” A shrug.
She grinned widely at that, and nodded in agreement, before running back out for more flowers. John watched her go as he fiddled with the new collection in his lap.
John watched his friend for a moment and didn’t bother to hide the soft smile that he felt on his face. He was too comfortable and just drunk enough to not care if he was caught.
It wasn’t like there was anyone to judge him for dressing his dog in clothes and spending exuberant amounts of money on her.
Every time he ran after Sherlock.
“Do you cook a lot of things?” she questioned as she tossed her used tea bag in the bin and added milk and sugar to her cup.
He strode into the flat and stopped short at the sight of John standing in the kitchen with his head in the refrigerator, seemingly on the hunt for something to make for dinner judging by the chicken breasts that were already set out on the counter. Why was John back already? He had been relatively certain that lunch would have gone well and that he’d still be out. But then again, perhaps not? Would lunch and then a dinner date be too much for one day? Maybe.
“John.”
Good. That was...good. Sherlock ignored the divebomb his stomach made for the floor, the way his heart clenched in his chest, the way he felt in freefall heading towards a pavement that he gained on with reckless speed with no way to stop.
Then the nightmare with Magnussen happened and he almost lost Sherlock again. Again and again. Sherlock in his life, giving him life, then taken out of it again and John was left struggling to keep his head above the water.
It was after, when he was in his room and getting dressed in his pyjamas, that he realized that there was absolutely no way that Sherlock hadn’t known what John was doing in the shower. And if he realized that, then he likely knew exactly what he was doing when he complimented John.
John quickly turned his snort of laughter into a cough and Sherlock really did send a glare at him for that. He held back the desire to stick his tongue out at him.
“We built a snowman.”
“No.”
“For what? There’s nothing I would ever do for you.”
“Yeah, he is,” John agreed without any hint of irony or sarcasm that Sherlock could detect.
“Why would that have made me uncomfortable?” he asked in genuine confusion. He wasn’t exactly known to be the kind of person who cared what others thought about him. People were idiots. Why would he have cared?
When Sherlock had fallen, John grieved like a widower. His life came to a complete standstill and he felt more broken in those early months than he had from his return from Afghanistan. Mary came in and seemed to accept those broken pieces and shoved them back together into something vaguely John Watson shaped through sheer force of will and sellotape. When Sherlock returned, all of those old feelings came rushing back, along with hurt and anger and confusion, and he had lashed out in anger because anger was easier to accept and manage at that moment.
John couldn’t help the small smile at that. “That sounds like most evenings we’ve shared.”
“So you have a boyfriend?” John asked with a small smile and he shook his head.
“Did you take it?”
“God, you’re gorgeous,” John breathes out, and Sherlock smiles as he opens his eyes, his body coming under his control again. He pushes himself back on the bed, shoving the duvet off and out of the way as he goes, then lays back down with his head on a pillow.
John sighed at himself. God, his thoughts were so convoluted he wasn’t even making sense in his own head anymore.
Then Sherlock hooks his leg over John’s hip and twists, sending John tumbling down to the mattress and Sherlock on top.
Mrs. Hudson began talking to John, and he felt a momentary flash of guilt after she pointed out that there was a second bedroom upstairs. Even though he knew the man’s limp was psychosomatic, he could have left the downstairs bedroom for him. He needed to win the doctor over, and having to climb up two sets of stairs just to get to his bedroom was probably not very helpful to his cause.
“If I never have a kid sneeze on me again, I think I could die happy,” John’s voice cut through Sherlock’s thoughts and he actually jumped in surprise and simultaneously slammed his laptop lid shut.
Sherlock invited him along constantly. Found countless ways to engage him in the Work, but it never seemed to be enough to sway his opinion on taking the room upstairs.
“If that game is too young for you, then we could play Doctor,” Sherlock purred in that deep voice, and honestly, it should be illegal to say things like that in his voice.
“About what, Sherlock?” John asked stubbornly and Sherlock ignored the way his hand tightened into a fist before it relaxed.
Sherlock stepped up to his table, eyes quickly taking in the empty glasses, a full bottle of wine, the clean tablecloth and napkins, the absence of food. Then he looked at John and whatever he had been about to say, about this undoubtedly “urgent case” that he needs John for, died on his lips.
“Of course, darling. Let’s get you in the bath real quick and then we’ll get ready for bed,” he said as his eyes quickly took in the mud that splattered her entire bottom half and the smudge on her cheek from her hands.
“Your tea is getting cold,” John tried after a few more minutes.
What a pretentious little dish, John thought, when Mrs. Hudson made him his first ever Eggs Benedict.
“How so?”
“I thought we were past lying to each other, Sherlock. I thought we had agreed that we both deserved the truth from now on.” John’s voice was low, a thread of hurt in it, and Sherlock’s gut flipped as it cut through him.
“Mrs. Moo’s,” Sherlock declared as they made their way down the pavement after finding a place to park, “has the best ice cream in Britain.”
John’s smile fell as his muscles went lax and the bag in his hand fell to the ground. The heavy thunk of a glass bottle hitting the floor filled the silence of the room, but John heard nothing but a deep resonate baritone reverberating in his skull and the heavy thud of his own heartbeat.
Sherlock’s lips quirked up as he stepped impossibly closer to him, one large hand coming up to cup John’s jaw, and John’s eyes closed without his consent to revel in the feeling of that warm palm against his flesh. Sherlock’s hand moved back, long fingers curled into the hair at the back of John’s head, and John felt Sherlock’s breath ghost across his lips before there was the soft, tender press of those perfect lips against his. He was surrounded by Sherlock. The warmth that radiated off of his body and the lips pressed against his, that sweet honey-scented conditioner and some herbal concoction that John had never been able to parse apart, the faint trace of the chemicals that he worked with, then something else that was just Sherlock. Something that spoke of home.
And there it was. Out in the open to be dissected, accepted, or rejected. Sentiment, but so much more than that, really. Cherished, adored, treasured. Loved. Sherlock loved him, and now John knew.
“Don’t tell him I said that.”
He was back in the flat at Baker Street, pink suitcase in hand, before he realized he had left John stranded at the crime scene. Perhaps not the best thing to have done, he’d admit, but there was nothing to be done about it. He would just need to engage John again. He fired off a text. When it wasn’t responded to after a minute, he sent off another two.
When he woke up one morning a couple of weeks before Christmas, it was to find London covered in an unexpected snowfall, and he was grateful for the extra warmth of Joy’s warm body as she stretched across his bed as he watched the snowfall outside his window.
Sherlock turned sharply to look at him. John raised his brows in silent question. Didn’t see that coming, did you?
John’s simple two-word confession brought back a  trigger memory of that physical sensation. His breath knocked out of him as his lungs refused to take in the necessary oxygen his body and brain needed to function and piece through this new data.
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
“You’re welcome, Alex. I’m glad Sherlock was able to help,” John replied.
John turned to look at him, his expression a mix of exasperated and wary. “Why don’t you just ask me what you want to know? Or tell me what you know. You always think you know.”
Sherlock gave a quick nod in response, then opened the door on the right at the end of the hallway. “This room is for you.”
“What are you thinking about?” Sherlock suddenly asked as he held out a cup of tea for John.
He listened to John as he got ready for bed. Heard him tread across the floor to his wardrobe, then to his hamper, then his chest drawers. Back to his bed. He came back down the stairs and Sherlock heard the water running for the shower, the old pipes groaning in protest throughout the flat. Several minutes later the shower turned off, then the water in the sink was turned on and off as John brushed his teeth. The loo door creaked open and shut, followed by the whisper of John’s feet as he went back to the stairs and climbed up yet again. The click of the bedroom door being closed. A moment later the murmur of the bed as John’s weight settled down into it.
“Mrs. Hudson!” he called out, knocking carefully on the door to her flat, a tray laden with breakfast held precariously in his other arm.
“Thank you,” he forced out, his voice barely catching on the way out, but even that was more than enough of a tell for Sherlock to pick up on. He didn’t mention it, though, and John relaxed a moment before turning to him. “Shall I get you, then?”
“Did Joy keep you company, Mrs. Hudson?” John called out towards the kitchen when Joy hadn’t come running as he opened the door.
John was a case that he simply couldn’t seem to solve.
Sherlock was stretched out beside him on the blanket, eyes closed with his arms crossed beneath his head to serve as a pillow. He had set his jacket aside during their lunch, and John let himself admire the way the tailored button-down stretched across Sherlock’s chest. He had untucked the shirt before laying back, and every now and then a breeze ruffled the ends up and offered tantalizing flashes of smooth porcelain skin.
Sherlock scowled. Mostly because he was right and he actually did truly enjoy the movie. Well, everyone had a weakness of some kind. Sherlock turned slightly on the couch, stretching his legs out, and tucked his toes under John’s warm thigh. John shifted to accommodate him without a word. If Sherlock had played this all right, then nights like this with John were probably on the decline. He doubted he’d be able to get away with this when John was in a relationship with Alex. No homemade soup and guilty pleasure movies and blankets and warm toes. If he had to sneeze a few times to spend that kind of time with John, then it was a worthy betrayal of his transport. He resigned himself to enjoy it now, while it lasted. He sighed and played his part in their banter.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, John.”
In the knowledge that she was well looked after, he let himself watch his friend instead.
“Girlfriend? Not really my area,” he replied, his mind and gaze still focused out of the window.
The next day found John shopping for Christmas gifts. The clinic’s holiday party was coming up and he hadn’t managed to pick up anything yet. So, after work, he had made his way to the small chocolate shop where he bought gifts for his co-workers and a larger one for Harry. He went ahead and bought a small assortment of truffles for Mrs. Hudson, as well. He’d give them to her when he got back as a thank you for the meal last night.
“Joy?”
“You ordered the garlic naan specifically for me. I know you prefer the plain.”
“Indeed. I’m glad you did.”
Sherlock, barefoot with black trousers and his blue dressing gown stretching towards the floor, held an incredibly small Rosie in his arms, expertly swaddled in a soft muslin blanket with bumblebees printed along the fabric, and he was singing her to sleep. John watched as Sherlock walked steadily towards the far window, his back to John, his voice soft but true as he sang the French lullaby.
“You’ll have to show me later. I was thinking we could go to the beach after lunch,” he said and Rosie squealed in delight.
The ride was slow through the traffic of the evening, with the holiday shoppers and late-night parties, but he didn’t mind. He rested his head back against the seat cushion and closed his eyes, letting the hum of the vehicle wash over him and put him in a hazy state of mind.
“Yeah, of course. I’ll just head up, then,” he turned and started walking, then stopped and quickly kicked his shoes off to not track mud throughout the house. He made his way up the stairs and to his room quickly, peeling off his wet clothes and tossing them over the back of the wooden desk chair in the room. He didn’t have any extra bottoms, so he just pulled on a pair of clean pants and a shirt.
John looked at Sherlock; forced himself to nod. He could believe that. Sherlock had the best poker face John had ever seen and it was just as clear now as it ever was in the past. Sherlock cared for Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade, no matter what bullshit came out of his mouth about caring being a disadvantage. Except, maybe, for him it was. He had cared and jumped off a building to presumably save the lives of those very people.
John’s smile was almost sad in response. He lifted his hand to brush a curl from Sherlock’s eye. They had lost so much time being together like this. Perhaps, though, there was something to have been gained by their time apart. Rosie, of course, but perhaps other things as well. Sherlock had learned to be more open with his emotions after his return from the dead and John had learned that a life without Sherlock was one that left him barely living. They had both hurt each other in such awful, painful ways.
John pulled back and looked into Sherlock’s eyes as their giggles slowed down and eventually silenced. He couldn’t have stopped the dopey smile he knew was on his face if he wanted to. Especially when Sherlock looked at him the way he did right at that moment.
“John.”
“Thanks again, Mrs. Hudson,” John said as he put down his most recent bags of provisions. He had been by several times already to stock up what he could. Beans, boxes of tea, sugar, bread, and so on. Milk. Lots of milk. She had more room, and he made sure to buy enough for 3 people since she allowed him to store things there.
Pregnant. Mary was pregnant.
“Something funny?” he questioned and John put down his cup of tea on the counter.
John laughed at him, exasperated, but conceded to go if Sherlock accompanied him. As it was in his best interest to ensure the doctor moved in as quickly as he could, he agreed and they made their way out of the flat and to a taxi.
He pushed Sherlock’s trousers and pants down, unable and unwilling to wait another moment longer, and took in the glorious sight of Sherlock’s cock at eye-level. It was long and lean, rather like the man himself. Hard and flushed and beautiful. He was already leaking at the tip, as turned on by his telling of the fantasy as John was, and John leaned forward to lick at the fluid and groaned at the salt and musk that hit his tongue. Above him, Sherlock moaned as his hips bucked unconsciously.
John could hardly believe most days that he was allowed to have Sherlock in his life again, much less that he was allowed, and encouraged, to have him this way.
“Originally, I had thought we’d have some wine while we talked in the garden, then come in, go to bed, and keep ignoring what has been growing between us for years.”
“Well, for one thing, we hardly know each other,” John picked the conversation back up as Mrs. Hudson’s steps echoed down the stairs.
A name, an address, and a wink -a wink!- tossed before the lab door closed, had haunted his walk back to the God-awful bedsit that was all he could afford on his Army pension.
“Glad to see you still have your coat,” he said, his voice hoarse as he pushed it out past a dry throat.
John looked around at the empty beach.
Sherlock was sitting at their kitchen table, eyes focused on whatever he was checking through the lens of his microscope when John walked down the stairs from his room.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she evaded and John snorted a laugh.
He wasn’t trying to be rude as he knocked and called her name again, but he didn’t want the breakfast to get cold.
Sherlock climbed off his lap, then grabbed his hand and tugged him up, and John couldn’t help the small giggle that escaped him.
John blinked again. He hesitated for a moment, Sherlock still not looking at him, before he nodded.
“Nothing ever happens to me.”
Oh, God. Is this really happening? His mouth is dry and he swallows thickly as Sherlock pushes his shirt open, exposing his neck and throat, and he bends his head to attach his mouth to John’s jugular and his hands grasp tightly on Sherlock’s waist to keep himself from falling over. Sherlock’s mouth is warm on his skin and he lets out a moan as he gently nips at the skin with his skin, his tongue darting out after to soothe the bite. John’s eyes fall closed as he tilts his head to allow Sherlock better access, and his hands begin to tug at the shirt tucked into tight trousers. Once the ends are freed, John slips his hands over the warm skin of his waist, hips, his back, and Sherlock groans before pulling back and claiming John’s mouth in a searing kiss.
Sherlock’s thumb made another pass and John quickly opened his mouth further and sucked the digit into his mouth. His tongue pressed against Sherlock’s thumb before he swirled it around the tip, his teeth biting down gently on the nail and the fleshy pad. Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered at the sensation and John couldn’t bite back his groan in response.
“Bless you,” Sherlock said flatly, and John looked up at him. There had been no way to stop the giggle that bubbled out of him, and after a moment Sherlock started to chuckle as well. After a moment of laughter, John became aware of his position again and carefully shifted off of Sherlock’s lap.
“Are you sure you want to marry me?”
She carefully opened her hand and revealed a small snail clutched carefully in her hand. The shell was banded white and brown and the snail itself was currently nowhere to be seen, apparently having retreated into the shell during its rather abrupt transport to the kitchen by a three-year-old.
A year ago, if someone had told him that Sherlock Holmes would one day lay beside him in bed, curls wild and eyes bright, and whisper the words “Marry me” to him, he would have laughed. Or cried. He definitely wouldn’t have believed them. It had actually happened, though. John had been there, and he could hardly believe it.
“It was necessary.”
“Oh, that’s hardly necessary,” Sherlock replied.
He shook his head at the memory, grunting in annoyance at the entire situation before he opened a new window. From there, he stared at the blinking cursor for several minutes, occasionally taking sips of his tea as his thoughts wandered. His free hand occasionally tapped on the keyboard, but never so deliberate to actually type anything.
“Why?”
“Damnit, Sherlock, are you okay?” he asked as he ran to the closest window. Sherlock had stumbled out of the kitchen by the time he had wrestled the first window open and went towards the next.
So, John packed himself and Rosie a bag, and two days later they had pulled up to a small cottage on the coast.
“I have a shift in the morning, but I can help you with the case in the afternoon,” John told him, voice calm and casual. “I’m heading up to bed unless you need help now.”
“I bought a ticket.”
Sherlock watched as John returned with the eggnog and chocolate biscuit and handed them over with a smile.
“Saw a lot of injuries. Violent deaths. Had your share of trouble too, I’d wager,” Sherlock continued, and John felt like he was being set up for something, but he wasn’t quite sure what.
It was done. He would be flying out in 14 days, to spend Christmas anywhere but here.
The action actually had John choke back a sudden laugh. Sherlock had once done something very similar on a case. He had knelt down on all fours, his sensitive nose close to a box rather like the one Joy was occupied with, and he had sniffed and moved to different angles until he finally identified what he was smelling.
John turned when he heard the sound of Rosie running quickly down the stairs.
A year ago, John had almost wished the bullet that ended his career had ended his life instead. Three months ago, he was reminded that being alive might not be so bad. Three months ago, he was thankful that the bullet that ended his previous life brought him to a new one. One that he never imagined for himself, but could now no longer imagine any other way. He held the hand in his hand tightly and leaned against Sherlock as he sat beside him in the back of the taxi, the warmth of his body seeping into John’s skin where they pressed against each other. He was tired and wanted the rest that one seeks after emotional exhaustion. He let his eyes fall closed and his head rest against Sherlock’s shoulder. He breathed in the familiar scent of his friend. The subtle notes of something citrus and herbal, the leather of his favorite chair, the chemicals that he often worked with, and some deeper scent that was purely Sherlock. It reminded him of Baker Street. He released a breath that was more sigh than simple exhalation.
“Just now. She gave me biscuits!”
That smile struck something deep inside Sherlock and he almost gasped at the sight of it. It was the smile of a happy John and he had been the one to put it there. It wasn’t like the one he had been certain that John was missing. That big smile that stretched across his face. That one was lovely, of course, but this one. This one, with its soft edges and warm eyes, this was a smile that spoke of peace, acceptance, happiness. Of love.
“Of course, I’m sure. Christmas with you and Joy sounds far more enjoyable than a Christmas watching Mycroft see how much plum pudding he could eat in one sitting.”
“Science, John.”
The limp was interesting, and Sherlock filed that away for later dissection. It wasn’t important at the moment and could be dealt with in the future. Right now he needed to draw this man in. Use the information he read off of him to his advantage.
“Come in,” he called as he rose from his perch in front of his microscope set on the kitchen table.
“Yes, I’m sure you noticed the eye roll.”
Sherlock was quiet for a moment, thoughtful, before he started to talk. And John listened without a word as they made their way through the park, and then back to the flat as the sun went down.
Sherlock ran, taking the stairs two at a time, and John was right on his heels as they entered the flat. There were police throughout the flat, searching through the papers scattered about and the detritus spread through the whole of the kitchen. In Sherlock’s chair sat the silver-haired detective inspector that John had met just hours before. Across from him, the pink case lay open.
“Why don’t you and Sherlock go find somewhere for Ice Cream the Snail to live for a couple of days, then? Maybe grab some leaves and such from the garden to make it nice and homey for him. I’ll get us lunch together,” John said with a glance up at Sherlock.
When John eventually made his way down the stairs he wasn’t at all surprised to see the garland wreaths and fairy lights decorating the entrance to 221 and his way to Mrs. Hudson’s door. A quick rap of his knuckles on the door followed by an “it’s unlocked!” found him opening the door and being instantly enveloped in the scent of Chrismas baking. It reminded him of visiting his grandmother when he was a boy, the scent of vanilla and sugar and butter heavy in the air, and he breathed in deeply.
“I can make it worth your while,” his public school accent intoned.
“Oh God,” John breathed out, pressing a fevered kiss to Sherlock’s shoulder.
He was numb. Anger, disbelief, frustration, hurt, relief, rage all simmered under the surface of his skin, but all he felt in that moment was numb.
“Shouldn’t you hear it as well?”
All in all, it wasn’t the oddest thing he had ever done in London. Thank God he no longer needed a cane. There would have been no way he could have carried a dog, even a smaller one, a few years ago.
“Well, I am a grown-up,” John said, walking backward to keep an eye on Sherlock as he went towards Rosie.
When they come back to their senses, Sherlock gracefully gets off the bed and goes into the bath. John hears water running, and then Sherlock returns with a warm flannel and carefully cleans John of the sticky mess their lovemaking had left behind. He tosses it on the floor, then crawls back onto the bed beside John.
“John.”
Sherlock was standing in the middle of the room and John absently noticed that the fire was going in the grate, and he wasn’t sure if Sherlock had just done it or if Mrs. Hudson had started it before they came home. It was an unimportant detail, but it was one that he took in along with everything else.
“I believe I did what was necessary, but I see now that my actions may have been more hurtful than I intended,” Sherlock spoke formally, his voice lacking any kind of true emotion, and John frowned.
Before, when John shared the flat with Sherlock, cooking was rare. What with all the science equipment and experiments spread all about the place and heavy odds on any eating and cooking surface not being completely sanitary at any given moment, it just didn’t make sense to cook in that kitchen. Easier to head to the shops, pick up some ready-meals and pop them in the ‘FOR EATING’ microwave, and God, how obnoxious that it had been necessary to not only have two microwaves in one tiny kitchen, but to put fucking labels on them to distinguish which one was to be used for food that actually went into living human bodies. Easier still, ring up one of the local spots and order takeaway. And there was always Angelo’s when they had felt like proper napkins would make for a nice change of scenery. Or rather, it was in the ideal spot for a stakeout, and they may as well eat while they were about it.
Sherlock frowned slightly, his eyes shifting to the side for a moment in a gesture that John never associated with Sherlock. He was nervous about whatever he was about to say. Or not say. He hadn’t actually said anything yet.
“Your usual ones include some kind of acid. Why on earth would you need to know how long it takes for a candy cane to dissolve in acid?”
“No. No, nothing is wrong. I just...I wanted to tell you,” he said, his gaze still intent, and John had to look away and take a sip of his wine.
Molly watched him thoughtfully, biting on her bottom lip again. She took a deep breath, apparently having come to a decision about something, then let it out slowly.
And John didn’t even realize. He wasn’t sure if that made it better or not. Would he rather John knew and tiptoed around him in some kind of weird dance where he attempted to be his friend without “leading him on” or was it better that he had no idea? That he went about his life without the knowledge that Sherlock would die, did die, for him? He shifted slightly against the back of his chair where he leaned against it, felt the pull of scar tissue that John had no idea existed, and would never find out about if Sherlock had a say in the matter, and decided it was better John didn’t know. Better for both of them, really.
“Why?”
“How is teaching her chemistry spoiling her? She’ll be starting school in a few years and she needs to know these things. It’s a life lesson.”
“Yes, Rosie, he’s very pretty. Well done, but let’s have gentle hands, please,” he said, smiling as he watched them. Her small hands moved away from his face after a gentle apology pat, and his eyes moved to Sherlock. His cheeks were slightly pink, and John wasn’t sure if it was just a touch of the sun or if maybe Rosie had squeezed harder than he thought. Sherlock turned his gaze to John for a moment, and the color deepened on his cheeks before he turned back to Rosie.
Sherlock sat completely still, stunned, staring at the back of John’s head. Did he really hear him correctly? John wanted a relationship with him? Wanted. Past tense. Did he still?
Sherlock took a deep breath in through his nose, then released it slowly. “Nowhere. I was just out walking.”
“He said he would like to continue our acquaintance,” he replied as he saw no reason to lie to his brother. He would know as soon as he did and it was a waste of both of their times to bother lying.
“You’ve been stood up,” he says, frank and honest as ever, and John knows he doesn’t mean for it be hurtful. Sherlock often sees and knows and says without actually thinking about the consequences of his words. Yes, sometimes he says his deductions out loud to elicit a response or confession, but that was not his intent tonight. John knows this because Sherlock’s expression is surprised and even a touch angry that his date, the one he was clearly here to run off as he usually does, hadn’t shown up.
Another giggle. Maybe he was more than half drunk. “Yeah, I suppose we do.”
“A new suit, John, really? You must like this one,” he said, his tone trying for teasing but falling a bit flat to John’s ear.
“I do.”
“What’s wrong?” she asked softly, and Sherlock looked up at her again.
“Shut up, John,” Sherlock sighed and Rosie gasped with all the scandalized intensity only a three-year-old could.
“What about being married to your work?” John asked.
John stood on that edge and felt that inexorable pull towards the unknown, and he wasn’t sure he was content to let the world continue moving around him. But he also wasn’t ready to make that decision, to wade in and let himself feel all those emotions that being out there would reveal. He knew they were there, but fully acknowledging them when there was a distinct possibility they would never be reciprocated in the same way was terrifying. Not when they had remained so long ignored by all parties involved.
“You never call this many times unless you want something. What is it?” he sneered.
“I don’t really like to cook,” she whispered to him like some secret she was letting him in on. He nodded in acknowledgment because that seemed like the appropriate thing to do in the situation.
He wasn’t the type of person who felt like they needed to be great at everything they set out to accomplish, and he honestly wasn’t sure when cooking became something that he needed to accomplish, but here he was and he refused to back down. By all appearances, it was a losing battle and a smart soldier would accept that and plan a hasty retreat, but, well, John wasn’t a soldier anymore.
“Yes,” John replied without hesitation.
“I’m going to kiss you, John. Then I’m going to lay you out and show you what you mean to me. I’m going to watch you fall apart under my hands and then put you back together. I want to taste and touch and know you in every way one person can know another.”
“I’m your landlady, not your housekeeper,” Mrs. Hudson replied easily.
John closed the curtain and went back under the water. He got his soap and loofah and started to wash his body.
“Good morning, dear. I suppose that was John I heard head out to work, then,” she said as she wandered into the kitchen, a plate of freshly baked biscuits in hand. He heard the clatter of the plate being placed down on the table. “Oh Sherlock, your coffee has gone cold. Do you want a new cup?”
“I’ve wanted you since the beginning,” Sherlock confessed and John’s eyes widened at the unexpected admission.
He had just finished reheating one of those meals in the microwave at work (no stickers attached to that one), when one of the nurses came in, sniffing at the air in interest, as he was tucking into the now warm chicken korma he had made the night before.
John nodded. It wasn’t an answer, but then when did Sherlock ever give a straight answer?
Together.
John’s eyebrows rose in question. Greg reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small DVD case. John took it from him and looked at it, but it had no identifying label.
When he opened his eyes again, he couldn’t say that he was surprised to see Sherlock standing in the room across from him. He was in one of his bespoke suits and John couldn’t help noticing that it wasn’t as fitted as it had once been. He was still as breathtaking as he had ever been, but the jacket was just a touch to large, the buttons of the white silk shirt he wore weren’t stressed at how fitted they were to his broad chest. It was all further proof of their time apart and John hated it. He wanted Sherlock to fit those suits properly again. If that meant feeding the man sweets and making risottos and dinners at Angelo’s for the heaviest pasta dishes the man could make, then he would gladly do so.
Once Mrs. Hudson was happy with his fried eggs, she moved him on to other preparations. Perfectly scrambled eggs, hard-boiled, soft-boiled, omelets with fresh mushrooms and diced peppers, egg in a hole. John didn’t think he realized there were so many different ways to make eggs, but he found that he enjoyed all of them.
A sharp rap on the door to the flat accompanied Mrs. Hudson’s call and John walked out of the kitchen to find his landlady standing with a plate of biscuits in the doorway and the dog wagging her tail so enthusiastically her entire body moved in an almost serpentine motion. He couldn’t help the smile that came to his face as he watched her sniff excitedly at the plate Mrs. Hudson held.
His brother made a reply, but he was already finished with the conversation and his meddling. He turned and began walking away. He heard John say something to Mycroft, but it wasn’t important and he kept going. A moment later John caught up to him.
Another.
It turned out that the promise of returning to actually get in the water was more than enough to convince her it was worth going to the cottage to get changed. John quickly picked up the few beach toys he had brought down, and then they were all on their way back.
“I have a dare for you.”
John wasn’t sure how he made it through his workday, but somehow he managed to muddle along, correctly diagnose patients (he’s pretty sure), avoid the aggressive flirting of the new nurse, and fill out his paperwork in a way that didn’t end up in him getting fussed at by the staff.
“That’s fine. I can email Alex whatever questions you have,” and Sherlock cut him off.
“You haven’t done anything wrong. That was me. I was just...in my own head, or something. It wasn’t anything you did.”
The sound of Sherlock’s playing followed him up the stairs and throughout his shower. He couldn’t hear it over the sound of the spraying water, but it was still going when he came out and got dressed in his pajamas. Might as well be comfortable. He was humming as he made his way to the kitchen and got the supplies ready for tea.
He took a deep breath and forced his feet up the stairs and into the flat, still painfully aware that his heartbeat too hard, but he wasn’t going to avoid his own home because a ghost had returned from the dead and played the violin.
John laughed.
Knowing John was bisexual didn’t mean that John was interested in Sherlock beyond friendship. He ignored the clench in his chest at that and the way his stomach flipped without his permission. His transport had betrayed him while in his Mind Palace and that was a new and disturbing development.
“I am happy,” John stated simply. “And yeah, he is. He’s a madman, and he makes me absolutely crazy, but he saved my life. In many ways.”
“So you have a boyfriend?” John asked as he again ignored the way his chest tightened at the potential answer.
“You’re right she doesn’t want excuses, but she deserves an apology.”
“That you across the way, then?” John asked with a nod of his head toward the door across the hallway.
John didn’t remember making the decision to throw the sandwich at the wall.
She climbed onto the bed, crawled past him, and settled right beside Sherlock, pulling the duvet out and tucking herself in against his body. Sherlock’s eyes drifted from her to John and John shrugged with an apologetic smile. Rosie always crawled into bed with John during thunderstorms, and it appeared that night would be just like any other. It didn’t phase her for a moment that Sherlock was there. She was already most of the way back to sleep when John sighed, pulled the duvet up, and settled beneath it himself. He lay down facing Sherlock, who watched the entire scene silently. John raised his brows and wiggled a bit of the duvet at him.
John ground his teeth at the repeated statement. No. He wasn’t a doctor. Not anymore. A bullet in Afghanistan saw to that.
Buildings were decorated with wreaths and fairy lights shining in windows. Trees trimmed in ribbons and baubles stood out in window displays and John couldn’t help thinking that it was all a bit much, really. There was a Father Christmas in one of the windows that he supposed was meant to look jolly and cheerful, but instead looked rather depressing, in his faded robes and fake beard.
“Obviously,” he replied, suddenly very aware of the water that collected and dripped from his hair down his face and the open collar of his shirt.
“No nap! I’m not tired,” Rosie protested.
He wasn’t sure it really mattered, but he accepted her judgment since she had agreed to teach him, and he was soon pulling together fry-ups that were a significant upgrade from what he had once been able to produce.
His smile fell a bit at that. More and more Sherlock wished he had just said no to this case before John had come home and seen the man who had been in their living room. He didn’t want to talk about the case. Or rather, he didn’t want to talk about Alexander Campbell. After he gave his head a shake to try and clear it, he typed back a simple reply.
John stared at him for another moment before he blinked and seemed to come back to himself, and Sherlock was secretly pleased to see John’s cheeks flushed pink as well. The doctor cleared his throat before he met Sherlock’s eyes.
“You can’t make a dare into a truth. It’s against the rules.”
“Yeah, of course. Thanks for stopping by. And this,” John said, waving the DVD he still clutched tightly in his hand.
A witch, like in
Sherlock’s brow arched up, and John grinned.
They were watching a decent comedy. He would have preferred the new horror film, but his date hadn’t been too keen on that idea, so comedy it was. She was leaning in towards him, sharing a bucket of popcorn, their hands occasionally touching as they reached for more. Entirely accidental, of course.
A whirlwind taxi ride, a crime scene where Sherlock became obsessed with the color pink before he ran off and abandoned John to his fate, then an obnoxious warning that Sherlock Holmes was a psychopath with murder in his future, left John feeling even more useless than he had earlier.
“An old...friend of John’s came by yesterday. Needs help with a case. Incredibly dull,” he mumbled as he lifted his gaze to his landlady.
“I thought you’d enjoy it out here,” Sherlock’s voice came from beside him before the taller man sat down on the bench, long legs stretched out in front of him, feet crossed at the ankle.
“If this is what having an imagination leads to, then I think I’ll do without.”
“Sit up a bit,” came John’s soft tenor and Sherlock obliged without question.
“No, no, I wasn’t...no. I was just saying it’s fine. It’s all fine,” John tried to explain quickly as he felt his stomach fall through the floor in panic and not a small amount of disappointment.
At that she actually looked at him for a moment, a smirk crossing her lovely face, and that was all John needed to know that her boss probably already knew he would be going there before he even got in the car. John looked away from her and out through the window to take in the passing streets of the city.
He had mourned for two years. For two years he lived with nightmares of his friend jumping, his body on the ground, his body in the ground. He had visited his grave countless times and left flowers, talked to him, confessed things to him that he never told anyone else.
“No!”
All nonsense, of course, but John was steadfast in his belief that Rosie experience as normal a childhood as could be achieved. Considering what John and he did for a living, and everything they had been through, Sherlock conceded that Father Christmas might not be so unbelievable after all.
“I was thinking.”
He filled the kettle with water, flicked it on, then rummaged through the cabinets for a clean mug and what appeared to be the last of his tea as the water came to a boil. Luckily there was enough milk left that he didn’t have to take his tea without it. He briefly considered whether the effort of making toast with whatever jam he had left in the fridge was worth the trouble, but decided against it.
“Or continue to stand there until you reboot and are ready to talk,” John tried, opting for their usual teasing banter and hoping that would be enough to get Sherlock to engage in some kind of communication.
The ride on the Tube was atrocious. It was always packed with commuters, of which he was one, and he often found himself standing between people cursing the lack of proper WiFi on the Tube when important calls cut out or their emails wouldn’t load, and it was almost enough to make him want to pay the fees for a taxi to drive him. Or even learn to drive himself.
"Cheers, Sherlock."
“Look, sex is sex, ok? Man, woman, doesn’t really make a difference to me. Sex feels good no matter who I have it with and I like making my partner feel good. Sex is fun, and I enjoy having fun with my partner. It’s physical, and it doesn’t require much of an emotional component. At least, not all the time, not for me,” he admitted, and Sherlock saw nothing wrong with that admission. John was a tactile man. He obviously enjoyed sex. There was nothing wrong with that.
His mouth opened in a gasp and Sherlock took advantage, his warm tongue pushing past his lips and John felt his knees weaken in response, his hands grasping onto the front of Sherlock’s shirt as the kiss deepened. John’s mind was on overdrive, his thoughts whirling in freefall. This wasn’t at all what he thought was going to happen just moments ago and he felt completely off-balanced. He pulled back from the kiss for air and Sherlock chased back after him, refusing to acknowledge that something like breathing was worth ending a kiss for, and John gave in to it, meeting Sherlock’s tongue with his own and unable to hold back the moan that formed in the back of his throat.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied as he gestured towards the empty chair where all their clients sat. “Have a seat.”
“Yes, John. Of course, I will.”
“What about?”
Sherlock leaned back in his chair as he watched the man and casually crossed his legs. The potential client’s eyes were still continually flickering around and Sherlock bit back the sigh that wanted to escape.
Mrs. Hudson’s head poked around out of the kitchen and she smiled at him.
“What’s in the box, then?”
He watched as Joy sniffed at the box, her wet nose leaving little smears of moisture across the unadorned cardboard where she pressed particularly hard before moving onto another angle to examine it.
“Oh, ok,” John said, ignoring the way he felt a shade of disappointment at not being able to put his hands on Sherlock’s skin. He had touched him before, of course. Dabbed on antibiotic ointment and had given him stitches a time or ten. Changed bandages and even helped him bathe before, but it was always while he wore the mantle of a doctor, not of a friend. Not of...maybe something more.
London lived and breathed while he stood at his open window.
It was why he had joined the military. Well, partly, anyway. Even when the days were the same, they were different. A little family clinic in London wasn’t likely to see anything truly exciting, thus the personnel weren’t likely to have anything much more exciting than unexpected projectile vomiting.
“I don’t like that actor.”
“What about the kitchen?” Sherlock asked.
“I wasn’t an unbiased party. I didn’t know if I was seeing what I wanted to see or what was really there.”
“How should I know?” Sherlock asked, though there was a hint of challenge in his tone. John smiled.
“May I have some, Lolly?” Rosie asked as the adults settled in for their breakfast.
John looked at him but didn’t provide an answer. Sherlock found himself slightly irritated at the silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re...you,” John said with a wild gesture that encompassed all of him, and Sherlock had no idea what to make of that. John let out a deep sigh. “The whole time we lived together I never once saw you date someone. You never mentioned past relationships. You never seemed interested. I didn’t want people making assumptions about you that were untrue.”
“We live in a physical world where everything is dictated by chemical reactions. Every action has a reaction. One element does this, another does that, put them together and they’ll do something different. Science, John. It’s important.”
The irony of replacing dead things with freshly dead things to commemorate a dead person wasn’t lost on him and he thought Sherlock would appreciate that if nothing else. John knew the flowers were more for him than for Sherlock, a way for him to process his grief at losing his friend, but he still made an effort to pick flowers that he thought Sherlock would have enjoyed.
“How come?”
Then Sherlock fell and the lie shattered as easily as a skull fractures after dropping four stories to the pavement. His heart was broken. No pretty metaphors to paint a pretty picture needed. His best friend, the man he had fallen in love with, was dead. He questioned himself every day for the two and a half years that Sherlock was gone if maybe he wouldn’t have fallen if he had told him the truth. If he had taken that chance.
Sherlock leaned close and began kissing down John’s neck, then back up his jaw, the spot under his ear. He bit gently on his earlobe and John felt his entire body shudder in response.
No. What concerned him was a certain consulting detective and his propensity for destruction when faced with the dreaded “b” word. What on earth would John do when Sherlock started shooting the walls because he was bored?
He stared unseeingly at his open laptop screen for several minutes as his thoughts once again drifted off where he would rather they did not. John had dated while he was gone. That in itself wasn’t surprising, of course. John went out rather frequently when they first lived together. No, what was interesting and thus truly demanded Sherlock’s attention was that he had dated men. Why had John dated men after his fall? Why had he never once dated or even seemed inclined to date a man while they lived together? It was a puzzle he was far more intrigued by than the actual case he was supposed to be working on.
Apparently it was too hot in London for the criminal classes to bother committing crimes. John had spent the last week watching Sherlock dance between pacing the rug in front of the empty fireplace, flop on the floor while Rosie built LEGO towers around his head, start three new mould experiments (in an upper cupboard where Rosie couldn’t reach), and after the sixth day of his complaints regarding the lack of cases and the abundance of heat, he had sent the man out of the flat and to the morgue to bother Molly. It was someone else’s turn for a bit.
Nine months ago, if someone told him he would be in London, he would have laughed. Nine months ago he couldn’t imagine being anywhere but under the blue skies and harsh sun, the velvet night sky with so many stars it could make a person dizzy, the sand and the heat and his comrades in arms surrounding his every moment. Nine months ago, he didn’t have a hole in his shoulder, a tremor in his hand, and a limp that had no physical reason to exist.
“Wrong on one account, though,” he said and tried not to grin at the look on Sherlock’s face at the idea of him being wrong about something.
“Don’t answer that. I’m finished. What am I supposed to have put up?”
He had bought a book on the Victorian language of flowers and would use them to leave little messages for Sherlock by the blooms he would bring. He knew Sherlock would have figured out their meanings if he were still alive, and since he had never had the chance to bring him flowers while he was alive, at least he could do it now. He would make a special bouquet for Christmas.
Of course, it could be. This was John. If John thought Sherlock wasn’t interested in relationships, interested in sex, he would never have pushed anything. He would have, and he had, accepted what he considered to be the truth of the matter. And Sherlock had never intentionally done anything to dissuade him of that impression, had he? He kept John at arm’s length before his fall because he believed sentiment would drag him down, slow him, and when he came back he was so desperate to just be in John’s life again that he had never explained to him how the thought of coming home to him was the only thing that kept him going while he was away. How do you confess to your straight best friend that you were helplessly in love with them? You didn’t. Not and hope to keep them. So he didn’t. Another year of holding him at arm’s length when all he wanted was to bury his nose in his silvery sandy hair and breathe in everything that he had missed.
“Sherlock.”
“Don’t make that child wait, you two. It’s Christmas! Open your presents, dear.”
John agreed with a shrug.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “John, your name has been on the lease since the day you first saw the flat.”
Then, as things were wont to do, they changed.
“Three?” John asked sharply, his inner doctor completely appalled.
Sherlock found himself in the park across from the flat, though he wasn’t sure if that was where he intended to go when he first set out. It didn’t matter. The destination made absolutely no difference. He intentionally slowed his pace, concentrating on the sound of his shoes against the gravel under his feet, the feel of the cold air as it blew across his face and pushed his hair across his forehead, the sight of birds flitting from tree to tree in search of shelter from the incoming weather.
“Kills with candy canes.”
“So what did you do all day?”
Steam wafted in delicate swirls over a pot on the hob, filling the kitchen with a rather delightful scent. It appeared John had decided to make chicken noodle soup. John tended to make it on rainy or snowy nights, or when he was feeling somewhat unwell. There was a nostalgia to it for John, and he had once commented that it had been one of his grandmother’s recipes. Sherlock could admit it now invoked a similar nostalgia in him.
John nodded after several moments of silence.
“John, if they got even a hint that you knew, that you thought I was alive, they would have killed you. They would have killed you all.”
She sighed in exasperation and John wondered how she deserved to be the exasperated one.
She was a new nurse at the clinic, and they hit it off right at the beginning. John was attracted to her quick wit, her cleverness, and she was more than pleasing to the eye with her curves and auburn curls. For her part, she seemed to find John equally enjoyable. Her laughter at his jokes was genuine, and she even read his blog, or so she said.
John stopped, looking up as he realized just how long he had been talking about absolutely nothing and wasn’t that embarrassing? He never rambled like that.
A momentary flush of anger and hurt rushed through him at the thought of her. He supposed that was where he got the idea to die, but not die. Sherlock probably went to her for tips on how to pull it off.
“Looks like she chose you to be her knight in shining armour tonight,” he said with a hesitant smile.
“Yum,” she said and quickly ate more toast.
“Nope,” Sherlock replied, popping the “p” at the end. “I’m not doing your dirty work.”
In the end, he realized he was still being a coward, and that just wasn’t on. He could be a little brave. Sherlock had jumped off a building for him. The least he could do was speak.
“Do you have any idea when you’d like to get married?” Sherlock asked after they had settled back into the cushions again, his feet once more tucked up under John’s thigh.
Sherlock rounded the car to the boot and pulled out their bags as John opened the back door to let Rosie out. She had fallen asleep on the drive up but had woken up when they had turned onto the road that led to the cottage. Rosie hadn’t stopped talking since the moment her eyes had opened and she realized they were almost to their destination, and she was still going as John unbuckled her from her seat.
“I have a couple of other dishes downstairs to bring up. I know you didn’t get anything to make for Christmas dinner, John, and that’s just unacceptable this year.”
“If it rains, then you’ll get mud. Otherwise, it’s just dirt,” John grumbled as he resigned himself to apparently having to get out of his shower to follow Sherlock to some blasted crime scene.
“Good,” he said. There, that was handled. Hopefully, he hadn’t made the situation worse by making the man feel awkward. He glanced back out the window, the conversation with John already swept under a mental rug, and he smirked at what he saw.
“I’ve often thought that I’d like to do the same one day.”
“It smells wonderful. Where’d you get it? I’ve been looking for a decent Indian place,” she asked.
By the time he resurfaced to the present and reached for his tea, he found it had gone cold. It was nearly noon which meant John would be off work soon and he would need to force his attention on the case. He shook his head vigorously from the quagmire that thoughts of John had left him in and focused again on the laptop.
They were progressing nicely, his date having already unbuttoned the first few buttons of his shirt when there was a knock on the door.
He pointed to the red plastic beach pail that she was nearly standing on top of and when she spotted it she giggled.
“Why would I do that?”
“Hear what?” he asked, because his thoughts were spinning dangerously out of control at the possible implications of what Sherock was saying.
“Fine, you can lie on the couch and we can find something to watch.”
She shrieked and danced around excitedly. “Thank you, Daddy, thank you! You’re the best daddy in the whole wide world,” she proclaimed with absolute conviction, and John tried to keep the sadness out of his smile at her praise. She was 3 now, almost 4, and while she accepted her life with the ease of the young, she had started questioning things as she learned more about other families from her daycare. Her family looked different than her little friends, and while she asked the questions with innocent curiosity, John couldn’t help the feelings of guilt that went through him every time they came up. He wanted to be enough for her, and sometimes he worried he never would be.
His head was feeling delightfully fuzzy, his limbs a bit detached from the rest of him, and he tried to remember how many drinks he actually managed to have. He probably should eat some more.
“What list?”
Sherlock gave a small smile. “I hardly think chocolate is the worst thing I have had stain any of my clothes,” he reminded him and John let out the laugh that bubbled up at that.
Sherlock hesitated. He wouldn’t lie to John, not right now anyway, but he also wasn’t quite willing to tell the entire truth. Especially when he knew John and Alex hadn’t only talked about the case.
John smiled at the words and appreciated the blush that crept up Sherlock’s cheeks when he realized what he said.
John deserved to be happy. There was one thing Sherlock could do about that.
They walked along in a companionable silence broken only by occasional giggles before John paused.
They were eating dessert and their glasses were nearly empty. She had been smiling coyly and flirting unapologetically the whole evening, and John was fairly sure the night would be ending in her bed. At the very least it would end with a goodnight snog and promise of a second date. At least, he was sure it would have, had he not at that moment glanced out the window and saw a very distinct figure racing past the window. He watched for a moment, the dark coat flying behind the man as he chased after someone.
Sherlock had expected a certain amount of anger in response, but he was somewhat surprised by the hurt that ran in an undercurrent to John’s anger.
His lips were warm against his. Softer than he would have imagined considering his ability to throw words like knives from his mouth. Slick from the water that poured down over both their heads and faces. Sherlock’s mouth was perfection and John wanted more. Needed more. He opened his mouth, gently sucked on Sherlock’s bottom lip, and Sherlock made a noise deep in his throat that caused John’s knees to go weak.
He blinked, looking up from where he had been staring unseeing into his nearly empty mug.
“I think I need more eggnog before I watch a cartoon.”
“That was a minute. Do you need two minutes?”
It was one of the meals he could always rely on Sherlock eating and the man was still in need of several good, square meals. He was far too thin.
“I had a couple of things I wanted to ask you about,” Sherlock said, then cut himself off and reached into his pocket and pulled out his mobile. “Excuse me, I need to check something,” he said, and took a few steps away. He turned so he could watch John and “Alex” in his periphery while he looked down at his phone. Alex stepped closer to John, and the sandy-haired doctor turned his eyes away from Sherlock and to the other man. Alex said something Sherlock couldn’t hear and John nodded, a small smile on his face, and Sherlock heaved a dramatic sigh and stalked back over to the two men who had turned towards him at his outburst.
John felt his eyes widen, lips parted, under the onslaught of Sherlock’s words.
“I was just thinking about Sherlock.”
“Yes, apologies. My name is Alexander Campbell. I was hoping to get your help regarding a matter of missing funds for a non-profit clinic I help run. There are some discrepancies that have become hard to ignore. We’ve contacted the police, but they are unable to help, it seems. I’ve read about you and thought I would seek out your services.”
“Nothing to be sorry for. It was a long time ago. Besides, it was a lesson learned. Be very sure the other person is interested before kissing them.”
“The grandson came to deliver groceries and found her in the living room,” Lestrade informed him as they came into the room and the scene unfolded there. An elderly woman lay on the floor, a puddle of blood around her head and a wooden knitting needle protruding unseemly from her left eye socket. Sherlock frowned, walking up to the body, his eyes scanning both her and the immediate area surrounding her.
John’s voice was hoarse and quiet as he spoke towards the gates. A shift of air beside him, the rustle of a wool coat, alerted him to the proximity of the man behind him.
“I misspoke. I saw, and I observed, but I couldn't trust what I observed.”
“Ah, yes. Well, I suppose there’s nothing for it, then.”
Sherlock met his kiss, tongues and teeth and lips meeting as their bodies moved together. John’s hips snapping faster into Sherlock as the other man sighed and moaned and demanded
“During, actually. We walked and she agreed to meet me outside since Joy isn’t a certified working dog.”
“Yeah, of course. Maybe for New Years'? I don’t have everything I need to make it, and I don’t feel like fighting the chaos of grocery stores this close to Christmas.”
“I love you,” John whispered against his mouth, softly, a reminder and a promise.
It had been tossed in a pile of discounted wrapping papers that apparently no one wanted and the moment John saw it he picked it up and carried it right to the register.
Sherlock stood up from the bed and started to pace across the floor in front of John.
A moment later John felt the twin sensations of the cool sunblock and a large warm hand as Sherlock spread lotion across his back and rubbed it into his skin. His hands were firm, confident and methodical, as he worked across John’s back and shoulders. They didn’t hesitate over his scar, didn’t shy away from the top edge of his bathing trunks.
“You do realize that when we get married you’ll have in-laws.”
John offered him another small smile and Sherlock found he was able to return that one.
“Your archenemy, apparently. Do people have archenemies?”
John had watched the whole interaction, which had the intensity of the final match at Wimbledon as it played out, and as soon as Rosie took off he let out the bubble of laughter that had lodged in his chest during the whole exchange. Sherlock straightened up and looked at him, a brow arched primly, and John laughed more.
“Well, dinner should be done in about 10 minutes or so. Would you mind putting those dishes in the fridge? Mrs. Hudson brought them up for Christmas.”
“What substances?”
Thank you so much for reading! This is the longest fic I've written (so far), and I had a lot of fun writing and sharing it with you all. I appreciate all your comments and kudos more than I can say.
Sherlock turned his head to look at him, then flipped gracefully onto his back, slipping a pillow under him to prop his hips up.
“St. Bartholomew's,” the cabbie’s voice cut through Sherlock’s spiraling thoughts and he passed a few notes to the cabbie while uttering an absentminded “thank you” as he climbed out of the backseat and onto the pavement.
John looked from the ringing mobile in his hand to the pink case.
“Want to see some more?” Sherlock asked and almost smiled when he saw the way John’s eyes lit up at the invitation.
They fell into silence, then, everyone eating, with John occasionally playing referee to Rosie’s dripping ice cream and any clean surface left. When they were nearly finished a woman who had been sitting at a table across from them with a little girl close to Rosie’s age stood up and smiled at them as she and the child were about to leave.
He picked at the food on his plate mindlessly. He did appreciate the potstickers. When he was finished eating he got up and took the empty plate to the sink. He looked through the containers of food still on the table, then packed them away and put them in the refrigerator. He grabbed a clean rag and quickly wiped down the table of stray grains of rice. When that wasn’t enough to keep his mind busy, or rather unbusy, he found the broom and swept the floor as well. Then he looked towards the sink that held his dirty dinner plate, as well as John’s plate and fork from his own dinner and a couple of tea mugs, so he went ahead and washed them while he was there. Despite what he would have John think, he didn’t actually mind washing the dishes. He was just putting the last mug on the rack to dry, glittering suds sticking to the backs of his hands, when he heard the front door open and John’s steady tread on the stairs. He grabbed the towel that hung on a hook on the cabinet under the sink and had just finished drying his hands when John entered into the kitchen.
He carefully unpacked his clothes from his bag and hung his shirts and jeans in the small closet that came in the room, and laid the folded vests and pants and rolled socks in the available dresser. Next came his toiletries, but due to the shared bath, he just laid those out on top of the dresser in his tote rather than take them into the room. He didn’t want whoever was sharing the flat to mess with his shampoo and soap. They weren’t anything fancy, of course, but still. The thought of some stranger deciding to use his razor or something gave him the heebie jeebies, and he didn’t want to take the chance.
“I love you, too,” Sherlock said, and John’s heart thumped hard in his chest at the exchange.
(See the end of the chapter for
“A chocolate biscuit, please.”
“Daddy! Look, look!” Rosie’s voice cut through his memories and he looked up as his daughter came running up to him, Sherlock trailing a few meters behind.
John tilted his head to change the angle of the kiss as his hands came up and fisted into the lapels of Sherlock’s suit jacket and pulled him closer. One of them made a noise, a groan deep in the back of the throat, and Sherlock didn’t know who it was, but it didn’t matter. The sound triggered the opening of a floodgate. Years of misunderstanding, of wanting and denying, crashed over both of them and there was too much space between them.
“I don’t have to drink to dance, John,” he retorted and was glad that his voice came out normal. John was so close now that he could smell the soap on his clean skin and the shampoo in his still-damp hair.
“The bit of conversation I heard seemed a bit more personal than the case,” Sherlock hedged.
John was losing his grip on his forced calm; could feel the anger bubbling back up as Sherlock stood there, silently watching him and reading who knew what in his face and his stance and the stain on his shirt or the state of his shoes.
“J-John, you need to stop or I’m going to come right now. I don’t want to come yet. Not yet,” Sherlock started babbling, and John reluctantly pulled his mouth and hand off of him. He watched as Sherlock’s chest rose and fell quickly with his breathing as he tried to bring himself back from the brink.
Two years later and he still wished for the miracle he had begged Sherlock for as he stood as his grave the first time.
Rosie was singing a song to herself, her high pitched voice drifting over to them as she tried to recite all the words to some song John had once caught Sherlock singing to her when he came home from work early.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed him again, then pulled back after a couple minutes.
He wanted to say “I see you, I see what you’ve been doing, I want to see more,” but what came out was “This wine is good,” and John felt like the idiot that Sherlock often accused him of being. What was he doing?
“I think we owe Rosie a trip to the ice cream parlor after her nap,” he murmured, and Sherlock chuckled softly.
“To talk.”
John looked up at him from his knees and Sherlock’s heartbeat thundered in his ears as all the blood in his body rushed to his cock, causing it to twitch, and John’s eyes shifted at the movement. He watched as John leaned in and pressed a delicate kiss to the inside of his thigh as his hands caressed his calves and up to his knees, then down again. John trailed warm kisses up his thigh and stopped right at the edge of his black pants. John looked up at him again and he forgot how to breathe as John drifted forward and buried his nose into the side of his cock and inhaled deeply. John sighed, and his breath was hot against him through the fabric. He briefly wondered if the sight of John Watson breathing him in would be enough to kill him.
“Not exactly how I saw this evening going,” John said softly after he was sure Rosie was asleep again.
“Come on,” he said as the water rinsed away the bubbles from Sherlock’s skin. “The water will be getting cold soon.”
Sherlock watched him, saw where his eyes went, and rolled his eyes.
“You didn’t need to leave. We were just talking,” John said as he looked back to Sherlock and there was a hint of confusion in his eyes.
Sherlock’s mind came to a standstill at that simple sentence. John had wanted to date him? John had wanted a relationship with him? There was a ringing in his ears as his heart kicked into a rapid beat in his chest.
“Because you’re an idiot,” John said.
“Will he be taking the upstairs room?”
John’s eyebrows went up. “Well, I was on a date…”
“Sherlock,” John’s voice called out before he had made it to his bedroom door and Sherlock once again felt his legs root to the spot as he came to a standstill. He might not be able to move, but he could refuse to turn around.
“John, I’m sorry. If there had been another way, I would have taken it. You have to believe me that I did what I could to keep you alive.”
“Why not?
Anything he said would roll off the back of the oblivious detective, so it was best to just get whatever this was about over with. He took his razor and rinsed off the gathered cream. Then he tilted his face and started to shave the other side, methodically working his way back towards his chin. He had made three swipes with the razor before he realized Sherlock was still standing silently behind him. He glanced up at Sherlock’s reflection in the mirror and saw that he was examining John with the same intensity that he examined a murder victim. He ignored the flutter in his stomach at the heightened scrutiny.
“And?”
John glanced at the mobile, then quickly slipped it back in his pocket. “Yes, yes, sorry. I thought I…” he trailed off again, his eyes going back to the window when he saw a flash of movement. A flash of movement in the shape of a certain consulting detective running in the opposite direction that he was running in a moment ago. What on earth was going on?
When they finally caught the taxi he realized it was the wrong one. John, far from being annoyed about it though, laughed and touched his hand when reaching for Lestrade’s stolen ID. When it was time to run again, he did, with a smile on his face. Sherlock pulled his phone from his pocket and sent off a quick text.
Sherlock leaned into the hand and felt the brush of calluses that were fading from the surgeon’s hand; felt the smooth band of body-warmed gold that rested against his skin. Felt the weight of the gold that encircled his own finger. He sighed and turned his head slightly, brushing his lips against John’s palm in a kiss.
“It would appear Mummy made some changes to the rooms,” he said and John couldn’t hold back his laugh.
Mrs. Hudson might have, though. He’d have to check. She had been sneaking in so many Christmas-related paraphernalia, he wouldn’t be surprised to find crackers and whole bloody yule log on his hearth when he returned home.
John made a sound in his throat that he refused to think was anything like a sob and took a deep breath, reining all those emotions that raged through him back into something manageable.
John’s heart broke for his friend, and he wondered, not for the first time, if he was the first person that Sherlock had ever told his stories to.
“I’ll just give you a minute to finish your shower,” Sherlock’s voice cut back through his consciousness, and John lowered his chin and turned his head towards the curtain.
Sherlock was sprawled across the couch when John got home from his shift. His hands were pressed together under his chin, but John noticed how they weren't actually touching his face. For once.
If there had been any worry that Sherlock was a really good hallucination and not actually there, that bag in his fridge put it to rest. Soundly.
“Yeah, um. I was just coming to let you know I was off to work. I made you a cup of coffee and breakfast is in the kitchen,” he said as he tilted his chin back to indicate the room he had just come from.
“Yes. It’s true,” John admitted after a quiet moment, eyes locked on him. “But he wasn’t a very nice man.”
John’s feet came to a standstill in the doorway as he took in the features of the man he hadn’t seen in several months. It wasn’t so much that they weren’t friends, really. John had forgiven him for the part he played in Sherlock’s downfall, eventually, when it was too obvious to ignore that Greg beat himself up for that role he played. When John had been able to look back with a head somewhat calmer, he could acknowledge that Greg was following orders, and didn’t believe that Sherlock was what they were claiming him to be.
