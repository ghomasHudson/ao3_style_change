He was about to give one to Dorothy too but the woman showed him her wrist. There was a silver bracelet with a pentagram charm, a Christian cross, a Men of Letters crest and many others on it.
“No idea.”
“I made Sam angry” he answered.
“Sam…”
Dean felt his inside turning into ice. He was on Swan Mountain again, the woman with the pale skin and the empty eyes looking at him, reaching out to touch his forehead…
He didn’t have to play it. Castiel was honestly surprised and concerned about what Theo was saying.
“The Mark?” Dean pulled up his sleeve. The Mark of Cain was glowing with an angry shade of red. “I need it, Sammy. I’m stronger than ever. I can do anything.”
She quickly unfastened the seatbelt and took Dean out, holding him in her arms.
“What’s the right question?” she asked in the end.
“Oh, Dori…”
“That’s not our problem now” Dean stepped in. “Sariel thinks
Crowley just smiled.
Dean opened the box. The feeling of nostalgia washed over him as he saw the old books with the weather-beaten covers and broken spines. Old sci-fi’s and fantasies from various writers he had read a million times each. The Frank Herbert Dune books, some Asimov novels, Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, the first three Harry Potters, Star Wars, Kurt Vonnegut, and many more.
“Stop it, Dean.”
That should be impossible, even for him, whose Grace was burning out. Because it was burning out. He could feel the first signs. His palms were itching like millions of ants were marching under his skin. Sharp claws scratched his lungs, and he tried his best to keep from coughing. He didn’t want the others to worry about him. Especially Dean. Castiel had taken Theo’s Grace a few days ago and he was already running out of it. Dean would question it, he would want answers, then Castiel…
“And you summoned me because?” Dean asked after a while.
“Unfortunately some things can’t be changed.” The angel straightened himself. “I’ll tell you everything on our way to the kitchen.”
Gadreel frowned.
“We will pay it. This mess is our fault. It’s the least we can do.”
“Remember I had the power to heal and see demons?” When Daphne nodded he continued. “I don’t know how to tell this. It may sound crazy but it’s the truth.” Castiel took a deep breath. “I’m… I
When the boys died Bobby ran away. What else could he do? If the Winchesters couldn’t survive a date with those bastards then all he could do was run and tell the tale. He stole a car since the Impala was already surrounded by Dick’s goons and while he was driving away he called everyone he could.
“Sam!”
Sam let a smile appear on his face. He expected nothing less from Cas.
Hannah’s face darkened.
Sam started pacing up and down in the room. There must be a way to find him. Anything.
“Woa…”
“Hey there, little one!” she chuckled. “Let me help you get out of this.”
From the corner of his eye Dean saw Sam frowning.
The smile on the woman’s face immediately faded and it confirmed Dean’s fear.
“What kind of friends are they?” I ask curiously. I want to know who I’m about to face.
“When they have a plan, they carry it out. But look at us.” Lee stood up and spread his arms. “We’re holed up in this place, waiting for a miracle that would never happen. A few years ago you would have done the same as those two, but this freaking bunker has everything we need for survival. But while we’re inside, humanity is going extinct.” Lee shook his head, looking away with grief in his eyes. “Today when I was driving outside… I felt so free. I didn’t have to fear that a Leviathan would jump at me out of nowhere. I saw people,
Sam watched him with those sad puppy eyes for a while then quickly looked away.
“I can save him in time” she said. There was no need to deny it anymore. Metatron knew who had corrupted her Grace. He knew everything. “Time passes faster here than on Earth.”
The Empty raised a brow.
“How…” she started with a weak voice then coughed before she spoke again. “How do you know those things?”
“I’m going to find Garth” Dean said instead.
Cold ran down Kevin’s spine. It was an angel. Somehow she got inside. Metatron sent her and now she was after him. She wanted to kill him and take the angel tablet. If not Gadreel, then an other angel would murder him.
And that was how she got back. Almost a year later, but not really.
“You weren’t yourself, and I wasn’t myself. My death was not your fault.”
Castiel dug his fingers into his hair and gripped it tightly like he wanted to rip it out.
“Can I ask something?”
Asmodeus is the demon of lust but she had no effect on me. Maybe as a demon other demonic powers don’t work on me. Like how I could move even tough Abaddon pinned me against the wall.
“Why not? Ripples are curious things, Hannah. They can throw the order off balance easily. Time is the greatest force of the world. Not even Heaven has a chance against it.”
“You too. And show your Mom around.”
“Sir, Crowley wants to speak with you.”
Dean had dropped his gaze with shame.
Sam showed him his ‘I’m honestly flattered’ smile and waved to Kevin.
“Damn it, Dean…”
Sam’s eyes widened then he closed his eyes and exhaled a big breath.
heard.
Dean sighed and looked above the trees. It was a starry night. The morning would be cold.
“Sweetheart!” She took both of Hannah’s hands in hers. “I know why you are still confused. But believe me, you’ll figure it out soon.”
Bobby took a deep breath.
“Will you tell me why you’re falling?” he asked the question that bothered him for days now.
Jody watched him for a while, maybe she had some hidden ability to see his too slowly fading uneasiness regarding the subject no matter how much he didn’t show it, then clapped her palms together.
“You want to help?” Dean asked. “Start with a name.”
Castiel looked at Sam, seeking confirmation. The younger Winchester nodded in disbelief.
Their plan was simple. Cas would go in through the main entrance since he was a human and the demon wouldn’t recognize him. Meanwhile Sam would find an other way in. He would try to hack the security cameras and with the help of Gadreel try to get everyone out before the demon notices anything. If it does, they had one last demon bomb that would kill their enemy. But they only wanted to use it when there was no other option. There were still many demons loyal to Crowley. Luring them here would cause lots of trouble.
The warmth that had spread through his chest every time Dean said those three words now gave way to a burning pain.
What would be her greatest pain? When Dick had broken her arm? When the Wicked Witch killed her?
“You leave me no choice, Dean” his brother said. “It’s either this or the demon cure.”
He hadn’t been in this room before. Not when its resident was still here and not even after he left. He always tried to avoid this room because it was too painful to know he wasn’t there anymore and seeing the blood dried on the blanket made him sick. But Castiel had no other place to go. The roof only reminded him the Heaven and flying and his uselessness. Not if Dean’s room didn’t but he longed for something familiar.
Sam rubbed the bridge of his nose. He felt a headache kicking in and it wasn’t even noon yet.
Hannah smiled at him.
Castiel opened his mouth to say it was not necessary when Dean’s phone started ringing. The man muttered something not understandable under his breath while he hastily pulled the phone out of his pocket.
“Dean…” Sam fixed his gaze on his brother. “You know if you keep the Mark, Cas will die, don’t you?”
“Colorado.”
Eyes lit up with hope all around him. The thought that their lives could be normal again lifted their souls and Sam’s voice lost on its way up to his lips. He couldn’t imagine what these people went through and he hoped he would never find it out.
I hit the wall. Hard. My back aches as I try to stand up. Which is not possible. I shouldn’t feel physical pain, not from this tossing around. The Mark should prevent me feeling anything. It should heal me in an instant and get me back on my feet again. But it doesn’t. I’m still struggling to stand when I look at the demon before me.
“Maybe he didn’t know you were there” I say, because maybe I’m right. Maybe Crowley didn’t know about Mammon capturing his son. “He would have sent help. He took you away after all before we could send you back in time.”
I wonder when Cas will notice that I’m not acting like a demon. That, unlike my previous words, I don’t want him to die. But instead of being surprised by my behavior, he just shakes his head.
Castiel watched the doorway. All along he thought Dean had killed Tessa. The Mark was a powerful influence. He thought it had told Dean to kill the reaper and make him lie about it. But now… Now they found out the truth the painful way.
I stand up before I can change my mind and zap back to the cabin. Everything is how I left it. Gavin is still watching cartoons, Dora the Explorer from all. He stares at it, mesmerized by the colorful animation and the annoying voices and noises.
“Nothing really” I answer. “I scared Abbandon’s followers.”
Cas followed him to the closet with a confused frown. Dean just smiled at that. He opened the door and knelt down.
There had to be someone else…
“Daph, you sit down in this instant.” Bobby pushed the woman on the couch which gained a glare. They were in the room that functioned as the bunker’s living room. There was a TV and a bunch of game consoles around it, a sad reminder that a teenage boy used to live here. “I’ll tell you everything but first you have to shut your cakehole.”
What was he expecting exactly? It hadn’t been even twelve hours since that… that something in the library. He had no idea what the angel was thinking, he had no idea what he was thinking. He had to realize they wouldn’t get back into that friendship they formed during countless hours of research. Something had changed today, he could only hope it would turn out right.
I look up at Cas, maybe to see if he knew about this or to ask what was going on, but then I see him lowering the gun and complete desperation takes over his face.
“I can’t say anything to this that wouldn’t make me sound a hypocrite.”
“Hey. I’m Dean. I’m Sonny’s friend.”
“Okay. That's great, but we've got ourselves a problem.”
Shit.
The man shook his head.
He turned down the highway and parked in the woods. Pulling down the window, he let in the fresh air and he inhaled it with greed. He was alright. He just needed a few minutes and he could hit the road again.
Still un-beta'd.
They had cleared out a room before they took Theo from the Impala’s truck. The former angel tried to fight them but he soon realized he had no chance against two angels and four humans. They returned little after three in the morning so Kevin and Linda were still in bed. Charlie and Dorothy were had been up, waiting for them in the garage.
The man’s eyes widened and he panicked because he should be at the school by now.
“Nothing really. He hit Cas.”
“Because I… I can’t let you die, Castiel” she said. “You’re my… favorite brother…”
Castiel turned away with shame but he still saw the sudden solemn look on the man’s face. Here it was. Dean would now ask him about the Grace.
I jump up, the stitches straining painfully in my skin. It was a man’s voice that called me. I can’t see where he is and I can’t find him by hearing. It seems it comes from everywhere, surrounding me like a cage.
Castiel frowned.
Cas pursed his lips together like he didn’t want the words that were forming in his head escape. Just by that Bobby knew he was up to something.
The dungeon trembles. Sam grabs the table to steady himself but jumps away quickly when a part of the ceiling falls on it, tearing open the blood bags. The blood spreads out on the table and drips on the floor from all four sides.
The angel’s muscles tensed. The thought that Dean started killing his siblings rooted into his mind and no matter how much he wanted to pull it out it just hung on stronger. Because it wasn’t true. Dean had said it himself according to Sam. He wasn’t interested in humans or angels. This had given them some hope. It had meant that deep down Dean was still Dean. But if what Crowley had said was true…
Missouri stared at him so intensely that Sam had to look away and he held up his hands as he backed away.
Crowley just smiled at the insult like it was a compliment then turned back to Sam and Cas.
His body was on fire when
The man sighed. Great. He got stuck with an annoying teen instead of Cas. Or maybe that would be worse. The part after the rescuing was still unplanned. He didn’t know how to act, what to say, especially after… Anyway, he was glad the former – or still? – angel went back to burry the Rit Zein guy’s body.
“Good to see you, Sonny!”
Cas smiled sadly at that. Maybe Gadreel’s comment reminded him to someone from the past. Or maybe he thought about moments when that had almost happened.
Charlie asked.
Sam asked.
“A trap” Cas explains. “I used my Grace for it to be more effective than the trap in the bunker.”
“Death? We just met an hour ago.”
“Charlie!” the other woman cut in before she could finish. “I think we found something!”
“You know it’s true. I see your Grace shivering like Castiel’s when he was talking or thinking about his little slice of humanity. And I think you know as well as I know that he’s in love.”
Dean gained back the control over his body. He was himself again. A smile grew on his face and Castiel was about to say something when he noticed Dean turning the blade in his hand. He pointed it towards his stomach.
“Who is this?” It was an unknown number apparently. And thanks to Gadreel’s better ears he heard and recognized the voice of the caller.
It feels nostalgic to walk these corridors again. That’s the way to my room and that corridor leads to the garage. I have to admit I miss this place. I liked living here. Maybe I should move here and make it my home base? I get rid of Sam and some other things and make it my personal mansion. That sounds good.
There was an other flash of Grace and it happened at the right time. Without it Castiel wouldn’t have noticed the blade above him. He quickly jumped out of the way and waited for the next attack.
A demon would never be exhausted.
“Shelves?” Cas asked back curiously. “Why?”
Sam carefully examined his head and when he didn’t see any serious bruises he sat down next to Dean.
She glanced at him and smirked.
“Your parents are divorcing, you had a breakup, your grades are dropping and you got almost killed. Crying won’t solve any of it but you would feel better.”
Sam was running towards the stairs when he entered the main area. The boy looked confused and maybe there was a tint of pink on his cheeks.
“And what else could you have done? Pull your precious Righteous Man out the apple pie life?” Crowley shook his head. “You were hopeless back then, Castiel. Just like now. But! I’m here to ease some things.”
And he did. It felt good finally taking of his sweaty and muddy clothes and just stand under the warm water that washed the dirt off his skin. The water also eased his nerves. He shouldn’t worry that much. They were heading to the bunker, they knew what would happen in the future. Everything was fine.
“Yeah, right. It was embarrassing. All the things I did and said…” He glanced at Castiel then back to the ceiling, clearing his throat. “Yeah, it was embarrassing.”
Hannah hated him, he knew it. He could feel her stare at him, sending daggers with her eyes towards him. Not if the feeling wasn’t mutual. The angel chick was someone he was sure he would never trust. She had ordered Cas to kill him, for crying out loud! She had joined Metatron! The woman meant trouble.
“Who is it?”
“This is what I’m talking about. This pain is unbearable even for you, Castiel. I always admired you for your strength but this pain would break you down too.”
The girl didn’t seem to be surprised by the way he talked. Maybe she had seen everything that had happened with Ephraim. The teen just nodded and kneeled down on Dean’s other side. She carefully put a hand on his neck, the other on his wrist and waited.
“That’s what I said.”
Okay, so last week there wasn't any new chapters. I'm sorry about that. I didn't finish this chapter by Thursday because I started reading Hobbit fanfics like there was no tomorrow *coughbagginshieldcough* So yeah... I'll pull myself together now, I promise.
Crowley stands at the couch, looking at me with an unreadable expression. I have no idea how he got inside the cabin with all the warding inside and outside. But what bothers me the most is how casual he is. Hands in his pockets, leaning against the couch like it’s a usual Saturday afternoon or something. Ever since I became a demon he tried to act like a friend, someone who was my equal but still made sure I knew who the boss was. Now? Everything is off. The way he just stands there staring at me and the way he talked lacked the usual mockery.
When I finish I just stand there and look at the mountain of powder, bone and dry plant. Crowley thought you how to ignite fire so the only thing I have to do is snap my fingers and watch it burn.
Inside, there’s a poorly furnished room. Bed, sink, toilet, that’s it. But what I see apart from that surprises me.
those and he enjoyed it. He
The Campbell Family Library looks to be the only option I have. I knew them the least from the other potential candidates – namely Bobby and Garth, – also they had Samuel Colt’s journal. They must have something about these guys.
“Thank you!”
“For good luck” she shrugged and went to Cas.
So the younger Winchester stood up and stepped to the throne. The man sitting there looked down at him.
Castiel watched the woman for a while. He was grateful she had found him that day. He wondered what happened to her in his timeline. Was she possessed by an angel since she was a devoted Christian? He should have visited her. Inform her that he was alright. Was she still waiting for her Emmanuel to return?
His body didn’t appreciate the speed of his running. His stomach was growling, demanding some kind of food after a day without any. The well known but quickly forgotten needs and sensations annoyed him. As a demon he didn’t have to worry about those things. He just…
But Dean didn’t hear him.
“Abaddon and Metatron both caused damage in time” Death continues. A grimace appeares on his face as he says those names. “The angels shouldn’t have fallen, Gavin MacLeod shouldn’t have been brought here. And now that Dean killed him, time is beyond repair. The natural order is broken, the world is in chaos.”
Cas was held by an other angel. Without that he would be surely on the ground, limbs laying in different directions, like a ragdoll’s. His breathing was shallow and… Was that smoke coming out of him?
like a faithful dog, waiting for the next order.
Sam shut his eyes tight and took a few breaths. That was enough for Charlie to know what the answer was.
Castiel was so shocked by this he didn’t react in time.
“Slow down” he said with a calm voice. “You’re freaking out and I only understood half of this.” He waited until Dean’s breathing was normal before he continued. “So. You thought the ripple was good. Why?”
He never expected someone would banish him with such force.
It was exhausting. Dean was full of energy, always moving, only stopping for a few moments then he was running again. Castiel almost couldn’t keep up with him but he managed.
“Dean” Sam had asked. A week had passed since Chuck had been defeated. “What did really happen to Cas? How did he summon the Empty?”
“Where are you?” Sam asked. “Okay, okay, we’ll be there, just be careful!” Sam put down his phone which made a sound. Castiel recognized it as the sound informing about the battery and its need to get recharged. “So Gadreel was attacked” he explained. “He’s in his old vessel now, hiding in a motel. He said someone was after him.”
I rub my forehead. Always taking care of others, not looking after himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid…
I look down at my forearm too. I don’t feel or hear the Mark but when I pull up my sleeve it’s still glowing like fire.
Kevin’s alive. Bobby’s alive.
With her free hand she opened an other folder. There was a photo of her father, old, tired, broken. The lively glint of his eyes was gone forever.
“I thought our double agent situation was solved by the end of the suicide bombers.”
Crowley’s frown melted to something cautious but he quickly ruled his expression. This didn’t escape my attention though.
Sam helped Garth down the stairs. Poor boy was a wreck. His breath was quick and cried uncontrollably. Bobby gave Lucy to Becky and rushed to the men with Cas and Lee.
“Why did you run away?”
He realized too late what it was.
stepping into his personal
“Samuel and Deanna Campbell?”
“You can eat candy sparingly.”
“Come on!” She squeezed Dorothy’s hand one last time and stood up. “Let’s put these away. Dwelling in the past would only dull the view of the future.”
“What?”
Like Abaddon, Alistair and Azazel, the book says, Asmodeus, Belzebub and Mammon
Castiel didn’t want to see Dean sad. Never again. He wanted to see his smile every day, every minute. So Castiel took his phone from his pocket and called Sam.
I have no idea what he’s talking about. Interesting? Too many things at once? But instead of asking these questions out loud I simply shake my head.
“Dad, please…”
This is the chapter where I finished NaNoWriMo :)
After closing the door, Castiel rounded the car and got in behind the wheel.
“Yeah, we met once.”
“You went to Crowley?!” A yell breaks out of me. I’m still desperate for it to be false. “After everything he had done to you?!”
“I never knew my grandparents, nor my great-grandparents” he told him. “It was just me, my brother and my parents at the beginning, now it’s just me and Sammy. But I know what probably happened to James.” Dean looked back at the man. “A demon named Abaddon killed almost every Men of Letters. We’re after this demon.”
Sam observed the girl one more time then smiled at Bobby.
The Empty slowly lowered its hands. It was still staring at him in bewilderment , but it seemed to be calmer. More at peace.
“Yes, thank you, ma’am. Bye.” Sam put his phone on the table and looked up. “Garth is not answering. I called the local police station but they hadn’t seen Reverend Meyers in a week.” His expression turned pained. “Maybe he’s already…”
“Here.”
Sam watched Hannah as she sat down next to him on the bed. She nervously rubbed her hands together and when she spoke again her voice was low and shy.
Archangels.
Sam’s head jerked up and his mouth fell open.
He’s still alive.
He walked down a familiar path on the identical corridors. He passed bedrooms and the kitchen until he finally reached the library.
He mainly played alone, talking to Honey with a low voice, going silent every time someone was getting close to him.
Castiel let himself being pulled, sighing in relief that Dean was all right.
“Wake me up next time” he said. “I always want to say goodbye to you before you go.”
“It’s their job.” Kevin shrugged and sat down. Sam and Cas storming through the bunker with their packed bags a few minutes earlier interrupted their reunion. Seriously, couldn’t they all just stay and relax a little? They had just travelled back in time and less than twelve hours was the longest time when all of them were in the bunker. They should take it easy, especially Dean and Cas. Sam at least had a few days to rest but those two? They were like hyperactive spiders running up and down the walls. As soon as they arrived they were on their way to somewhere else. Kevin would lock them in their rooms when they got back, he decided.
“I’ll miss you too.”
Hannah rubbed the back of her neck. Why had she gone to Metatron in the first place? She should have asked Castiel instead. She was sure he knew what she was going through because the same had happened and still was happening to him. He would give her some advices.
“Happy now?”
“The circle of life” Cas helped him out.
The day when his memories had returned burnt into his head. Every flashing image had been a stab and the pain just grew ever since. He knew Dean didn’t forgive his betrayal yet. And he would never do now. The forgiveness the man had given him in his dream was only that. A dream. His heart longed for it more than anything but it was not real. He didn’t think he deserved even that. He neither forgave himself yet. And he would never do.
“No!” Sam grabbed her arm when she was about to stand up. “It’s too dangerous to go alone.”
“I want to go to Randolph, New York” she informed the human.
Dean laughed at that. Really laughed. He hadn’t laughed like this since he had taken Cas to the brothel. Damn, that was a long time ago. Maybe the Apocalypse was at their doorstep but everything seemed happier and better back then. They hadn’t been that broken yet.
“Remember, this is the first time we’re here” Sam warned them, mainly Dean, now less angry than before. “Timmy doesn’t know us yet. Don’t say anything that would scare him away.”
“What are you doing in the bunker?” he asked finally.
“Yeah. Just the usual.”
“Cas, I… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to…” He sighed again. “Damn it… I didn’t want to…”
In the end Theo opened his mouth and swallowed the food Charlie gave him without a word.
“Maybe. I don’t know.” Sam turned to the front door. “Let’s take a look inside.”
And there they were. Hannah and Muriel on one side, Castiel on the other. The angel… No.
He quickly blinked a few times and broke the illusion.
“I understand your concern” he started. Sam saw Cas looking at the angel with a brief surprise but he seemed to understand the situation in a blink. “I don’t know how Metatron had found us in Wyoming in the first place. Maybe he’s keeping an eye on us all. But human lives are at stake now. My Father told us to love humans more than him and I love them. I would risk my life to help them.”
… When he had stabbed and stabbed and stabbed he hadn’t felt pain. His mind had become blank but he hadn’t felt pain.
That was when he noticed something in Cas’ hand. A very familiar gun.
“The hell are you talking about?!” I howl back.
Bobby stopped and he heard Dean doing the same. He had no idea if their timelines were the same before the other Bobby died and how much different it became after that. Cas had said that their timeline was merging with the closest to theirs or something but there could be a lot of differences.
-“Are you looking for something?”
“Nope. Behind you.”
“I never believed in happiness” he said. He motioned towards other Dean fighting with the evil mimes in the background. “I always thought I would die like that. On a hunt, fighting some monsters, saving some people. But as the world grew bigger around us, as higher and more dangerous beings started to pop up, along the way somehow I started to believe that there was an out. That there was something waiting for me outside this life, but I was too afraid to think about it. Because…” Dean adjusted his hand behind Cas’s neck. He closed his eyes as he prepared for what he wanted to say. “Who would want a broken excuse of a human by their side? Who would want anything to do with me? Not someone who is beyond human understanding, for sure.”
"You didn't do anything."
“Reverend Buddy Boyle… He has that podcast. It’s all over the internet.”
The angel stopped and looked at her brother.
“Castiel!” Hannah called out but he didn’t hear it.
Dean just paused for a moment. To look at the creature in front of him. To take in everything that it was. What it was saying, what it was doing.
“Come again?” Dean leaned back against the backseat slowly.
“CASTIEL!”
His phone started vibrating in his pocket. Ed couldn’t help but hope that it was Harry, finally noticing that he wasn’t in the diner. But when he looked at his phone he didn’t see Harry’s name. It was an unknown number. Ed frowned as he picked it up.
Dean shook his head.
She never had a good relationship with her father. He was a man of his carrier and not even his family could distract him. Not even his only daughter.
“Bitch!” Dean yelled back angrily to which Sam only answered with laughter.
“Anytime.”
In less than five minutes Hannah heard Castiel’s car arriving. Two doors opened then slammed shut.
“Who are you?”
“Yes” he said finally. “Thank you.”
I stay silent, waiting for him to continue. And it doesn’t take long, he only swallows the candy before he talks again.
But his spot was not empty for long.
“It would wear off!” the witch casting the spell had screamed when Sam was about to beat an answer out of her. “It would wear off in a week or two!”
Asmodeus is still busy touching my face so she doesn’t notice it when I aim at her with the Blade.
“No.”
-The male nodded and opened the car for her. Hannah sat inside and soon the car was on the road.
Sam glanced up curiously. In this sudden attention that was turned towards him, Cas inclined his head nervously.
?” he asked. Who was he? Who was Dean talking about? He feared what the answer would be.
, Cas told me that night and while I still doubt that, meeting Cas was the best thing. Maybe we had arguments and there was that thing with Crowley but I already forgave him. I always forgive him because he’s my best friend, my family, one of the most important people in my life.
No, not good.
“Yes, Bobby, go on.”
She has a wicked grin on her face when she brushes my cheek with her fingers. I want to chop them off right there but I hold myself back. Just a little longer.
The man watched him for a while, staring at him so intensely without blinking like he wanted to change Castiel’s mind without words. After a short while it made the angel uncomfortable, and he wondered if he had had the same stare in the early days of his time here on Earth. He should apologize to Dean for that.
“It’s a closing circle.” Hannah nodded. “There must be an explanation why it happens this way.”
For hours now he was observing the building, but he hadn’t seen anything moving. He was afraid that the man somehow left the building without him noticing. But when he concentrated, he could feel the darkness radiating from the Mark. At times like this the stolen Grace twitched painfully and Castiel wanted to scream, wanted to curl up into a ball and cut the foreign force out from his body. But without it he wouldn’t be able to kill the man with the Mark. He wouldn’t be able to defeat Metatron and take back his own Grace.
Hannah folded her fingers and smiled up at Sam.
“Cas! Good morning.”
Hannah followed him. Their plan, in her opinion, was insane. They would make a circle of holy oil around the area and trick the angels to enter it. The plan also involved digging and some additional things. Nobody would fall into a trap like that. She didn’t know what those Winchesters had in their heads, but she hoped Castiel was smarter than that.
– they were green and bright just like he remembered. Faintly he remembered that not that long ago he had heard him yell his name but maybe it had been only a dream.
Then Sam stepped closer and put a hand on Kevin’s shoulder.
Cas looked back at them with interest in his eyes.
?” He motioned with his blade towards other Dean taking his last breath once again. “You want to see this for an eternity instead of coming home with me?”
“Damn those ladders” the man muttered under his breath before he stood up. “Thought you were in your room, son.”
I lose my sense of time inside the cave as I sink deep into my thoughts, counting every mistake I made since I can remember, so I’m startled when I suddenly hear a roar that doesn’t seem to end. I stand up fast and rush to the entrance. In the distance I see a wall of dark cloud reaching towards the sky. The wall is everywhere I look, and probably continues beyond the horizon.
“No.” Hannah shook her head. “They used to be powerful but simple angels. A ripple would affect them too. They shouldn’t remember anything.”
I’m exhausted when I finally get back to the cabin. But I did it. I finally did it. There’s nothing that can stop that ripple now. I just have to sit down and wait until it happens. Or maybe lay down. I feel a dull pain in my bones as I move, more annoying than painful. There’s a tension right behind my eyes that I only felt before I took that damn Mark, when I didn’t sleep for a week at least.
“What was the Fate talking about?”
Dean almost threw up right there and then. The emptiness he felt after he had stabbed and stabbed the demon. After he had stabbed and stabbed Abaddon and Asmodeus. When Sam had told him they could fix everything. When he heard the whispers, saw the blood, felt the fear, felt the loneliness. When…
“It’s nothing” he lied. “Just some research stuff.”
And that was the moment he felt that Gadreel was getting weaker. His arms holding back the hound were shaking uncontrollably now. It would give in to the raw power in no time.
“Cas?”
Castiel panicked because for a moment he could swear he saw demonic black eyes but when he looked again Dean’s irises were green. He was just seeing things, he told himself. He was just too scared of this thing to happen again.
“It’s over, Dean” he says. “Stop this or I’ll force you to.”
Kevin took his time to take one. He should have chosen one like his mother but a little voice in his head told him that he should look around first. He read the labels on every box, searching for something that would catch his eyes. He felt he was getting closer to something. An invisible force was pulling him, urging him to get there faster. Then he was halted by an undetectable wall.
“That would be helpful” Kevin agreed.
And now they had had to destroy this for the spell to work. Dean had needed to sacrifice this last part of Cas so they could save him.
“Maritza.”
“By the way, when you’re done with your hissy, come down. It appears Father Time is alive and kicking somewhere.”
“Why?” he asked. His voice was so broken it made Hannah feel sorrow. “Why did you heal me? I told you to leave me.”
In the next moment the van sped up and it knocked the back of the Impala. Sam and Cas’ heads jerked forward.
So Kevin sighed and hugged Dean. He couldn’t just call him names and hurt him because he would later regret it. Like Dean had said it was a second chance. Everyone deserved one. Except the intentionally evil ones.
From all the things this was the least to expect. Dean turned away doubtfully.
“You mean that part too…”
Dean broke the eye contact after a few moments. He looked down at his feet and rubbed the back of his neck.
“Lucifer told me that no matter what I do, we would always end up there” I say.
Hannah nodded dutifully.
as he glared angrily at the other.
“So, tell me, Bobby” he heard Dean saying. “How did you find the bunker?”
Lucy, probably hating that their eyes were not on her, started whining so loud it hurt Sam’s ear. She had no tears in her eyes, of course.
“It’s okay.” Dean waved and looked at Kevin’s note. “What is it?” he asked. “Still the angel tablet?”
“Nothing” Sam panted after he hurried back from the storage, showing them two empty bottles. “Everything’s gone and there are burn marks on the floor.”
“Cas said you hadn’t known about Purgatory and…”
Dean sighed. Yeah, the Leaders of Hell. He should have guessed.
Then suddenly Dean was on the other side of the window, just in time to feel and hear Sam’s neck breaking under his foot.
“We rarely met after that but I considered us good friends. Hunters never came after me and I think it was thanks to her. She was a great woman. And I think you inherited a lot from her.”
“Yes” he answers. “I know you’re still there… You’re still there somewhere and I know you can hear me. Please, Dean, you have to stop this. I know how strong you are. I saw your soul in Hell. No matter how tainted your soul was, it still shined brighter than anything I had ever seen in my long life. I know you’re stronger than the Mark. You can fight it. You can defeat it.”
“You’re amazing, Hannah” she heard Sam’s voice next to her ear.
“Lucifer is locked into the Cage” Bobby explained. “And Sam thinks he can help Dean.”
’ the angel reassured him. ‘
“You’re kidding me, right?”
Dean frowned.
The door creaked quietly when Sam opened it, but it was enough for the girl to notice. She stopped and looked at Sam questioningly with her brown eyes.
Cas shook his head.
“Metatron was controlling her” Dean said. “I know Tessa. She wouldn’t do anything that would disturb the balance of life and death or what is that.”
Sam raised his head. He found himself looking into Hannah’s blue eyes. She sat on the opposite side of the table and watched him with a kind smile on her face.
“By asking you already made the first step. Next is to act like yourself and talk to those who are close to you.”
The man rubbed the bridge of his nose. He felt a headache forming right behind the bone.
“So… It’s the three of us, Kevin, Gadreel and Ms. Tran.”
“Sam!” Dean stared at his phone. “Where are you?”
Sonny nodded and both of them were silent for a long moment. Robin walked out of the house, heading towards Dean. When the man saw her he said something to Cas and walked to her. As they started talking Sam turned back to Sonny.
Sam sighed and shook his head.
Castiel, as some would say nowadays, was so done with Dean. A painful laughter broke out from him and he brushed his fingers through his hair.
Dean looked down, tugging the sleeve of Castiel’s shirt.
Dean reflected his smile but it soon faded.
Sam slowly moved away from her but her hand never left his back, like it was glued to it. He looked up and locked eyes with her. Hannah sensed some kind of malfunction in her vessel’s temperature. It started to rise. It had never happened before.
Crowley’s next chuckle wakes me from my thoughts.
She reached out with her Grace and listened to her siblings’ voices, trying to hear any useful information. But the only things she heard were painful screams and angry threats, promises that Castiel would die a painful death once the angels found him.
Gadreel pulled out an angel blade from the jacket and raised it in defense.
about Purgatory, we just didn’t know if it was real” the angel corrected him then shook her head. “Castiel relies too much on his emotions in this matter.”
Sam’s fingers tightened around the wheel.
“Hannah, is everything…” he started but the angel gave him the answer he needed.
The thought made her shudder which Sam noticed right away.
Dean’s lips trembled but he quickly steeled himself. He took a deep breath.
Footsteps were heard from the stairs and soon Dean appeared at the door.
“Wha…”
. There won’t be any kicking out and sleepless nights because of it and finally, fucking finally, everybody he considered a member of his family would be under the same roof. At this thought something fluttered inside him and he quickly tried to stop it with a cough. He knew what that meant but he couldn’t let it take him over yet. Not until they got back and he made sure everything would stay that way.
“I pured his soul from the Mark. He is my true vessel. I don’t want any demonic power inside him.”
The angel’s eyes tear up as he continues looking into my eyes.
Maybe it was just the confidence in his voice. Or maybe the way he looked at Dean. Or just Dean getting impatient that finally,
Castiel turned away and hid his face behind his legs. His whole inside was shaking and the stolen Grace was burning every cell of it.
Sharp pain shot through his head. Dean winced and rubbed his forehead. Damn, it hurt like a bitch…
“There they are.”
“How…”
“Hello, Dean.”
Castiel shook his head and they continued their journey through Kansas in silence.
“Don’t what?”
I shrug.
He dozed off somewhere in Nebraska, the one night without sleeping hadn’t done good for his system. He should have stayed awake, he thought later, because he was dreaming again.
His Grace was leaving him for one final time.
“We have to find Gavin and return him back to his time” Castiel suggested.
She felt Dean’s chest shaking with a silent chuckle.
“Dean” he says and smiles weakly.
“What happened?” Daphne asked. “Bobby only said your nose needed something cold. How did you get an injury like that?”
I shut out the feeling that rushes through me. I should have known that he wanted to cure me like Sam, but hearing that he
Neither of them spoke until the first rest three hours later.
With a sigh Sam placed his other hand on hers. He felt Hannah tensing but she didn’t pull away and he had no intention to let her go any time soon. He didn’t want her to run away again without a word so he tightened his grip a bit.
She turned her back to Castiel and placed her hands in her lap. If she didn’t have emotions why did it hurt so much looking at Castiel? Why did it ache her Grace like nothing ever before? Why was there a knot in her vessel’s throat and why was it harder to breathe even though she knew nothing blocked the way of air to the lungs? Why did her hands start shaking? Why did her eyes stung? Why did her vision blur? Why were her cheeks wet?
The girl clenched her fists on her lap.
“No! I stay and you tell me everything! Why are you bothering Cas! What were you planning with me!”
“So. Da?”
Relief and happiness wash over me. When I found him in Purgatory, when Gadreel brought him back. Every time I thought I would never see him anymore, hearing his deep and rough voice again filled me with a warm feeling around my chest.
Castiel waited for the pain but it didn’t come. The angel slowly opened his eyes and looked up.
The angel focused on the sounds of nature. The song of the birds, the rustling leaves as animals ran from one tree to the other. They were the creatures Hannah always loved. Simple, not driven by any sins. For a long time Hannah didn’t understand what Castiel had seen in humans. She had always looked at them like they would stab her every time she had turned her back to them.
“From now on I’ll make sure he would” the former angel declared with so much determination Kevin suddenly felt sorry for Dean. If Dean was stubborn, Cas was the personification of stubbornness. If Cas could order Dean to be the passenger in his own car, he could do anything with the hunter. Kevin made a mental note to annoy Dean with his apparent submissiveness.
Hannah’s back hit the opposite wall. No. It couldn’t be. Why would any of her siblings think that she was a traitor? She had done the best she could so both Heaven and Earth could be saved. She had done everything to help everyone and she would continue doing that.
“I just located the center of a circle” she said. “It was nothing.”
I see Cas’ adam’s apple bob as he swallows. His face remains emotionless but his eyes… I can see the deep sadness reflecting in them so I quickly turn to have a look around before I do or say something stupid.
Metatron chuckled.
Then she saw herself joining Castiel, following his every order, learning about the stolen Grace, leaving him and joining Metatron, realizing her mistake, Gadreel sacrificing himself, watching Castiel struggling with both emotional and physical pain. And she saw herself changing, softening, drifting away from the angel she always was, and in the end…
“What is this room?” Linda asked, looking at the labels.
“Good morning” she said.
“Cas?”
But John was not here. He was dead. He would never tell him what to do or not do. Dean was his own person. He could do whatever he found right.
The darkness of the library was erased by this one brightness. The same brightness that lit up the deepest pit of Hell. The brightness that no other person possessed.
“I can assure you that I have no intention to make any jokes. To tell you the truth, I don’t know how to do it.”
“Because you’re only saying this to convince me to leave. This is not what you really want.”
“Food” Charlie answered with a dangerous smile. “And if you don’t want to starve to death like a human, you’ll eat it.”
“The angel died. His Grace belongs to me. He can't leave.”
“Okay, let’s do it then!” Kevin sat down and after Gadreel took a seat on the other side of the table they jumped right into it.
“Of course I know him. He’s the embodiment of time. My boss basically. And!” she added before Castiel had time to even think about the question. “Neither I nor my sisters would have told you anything. Where’s the work in that? But I must say you were surprisingly creative.”
The woman watched him for a long while, gaze turning softer and sad.
When I thought everything would be fine, when I finally found a place I could call home again and people I could call my family it went down like a roller coaster and I still didn’t hit rock bottom. Or did I? Is this the bottom of that drop? Is this the end of it, where I finally admit to myself that everything I called living in the past years was just going with the flow? While everyone around me lived and I stayed the same excuse of a human? Lived if they were lucky. John died, Sam died, Cas died, Bobby died, Kevin died. All because I wasn’t strong enough and couldn’t protect them.
“From your car. I took the keys from your pocket and drove here.”
“The other boys.” He looked away like it was a shame to be afraid of someone or something. “They’re making fun of me. Hurt me. I hide in here. They can’t find me. They’re too afraid to enter since Mr. Jack died.”
“Why…” but before he could ask the question the girl cut in yet again.
I caught a cold last week and I barely had the energy to go to work so that's why there wasn't a new chapter. But here it is now!
Tessa closed the distance between them and put a reassuring hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Kevin felt the air charging up around the form… around the
“I had my reason to leave and I’ll answer every question you ask me but not here” he said with a low voice so just she would hear it. “It’s dangerous right now.”
he looked down at his right
there and then because he was
Dean bit on his tongue. Yes, he had wanted to see Cas. Because of the remorse he had. He still remembered clearly the former angel’s eyes when he had told him he couldn’t stay. He remembered the sadness and disappointment he had seen in those blue orbs. And he remembered the look on his face when Dean had left him that morning at the Gas’n’Sip.
Castiel closed his eyes to fight back the tears that threatened to fall. Maybe it would be better to die as a human. His soul would go to Hell where he would pay for his crimes. The demons would love to torture the former angel who had caused so much trouble for them.
Josiah shook his head.
Castiel nodded.
Hannah took a step closer to Metatron, barely holding back herself from hitting the other angel’s head against the wall again.
But he had to do it. For Dean. Dean had sacrificed so much for him, his own life included. It was only fair that Sam would do the same for him. He should be dead for years now. He should have died in Cold Oak.
“Leave… her… alone…” he breathed out. “She’s… innocent…”
Hannah and Dean both lowered their blades.
Hearing it Hannah’s heart skipped a beat and she felt a painful burn in her chest as he watched the hope fading from Sam’s eyes. She had honestly never thought about going to Father Time too. She had done everything so Sam and Castiel could get to him. But going with them?
“Yeah, you do that.”
They stayed like this for at least a minute until Theo turned away.
suddenly stabbed them when
’ Gadreel told him sincerely. ‘
Remember the nurse from 1x12? And the mother from 1x18? Both were played by Erica Carroll, so why not make those two characters the same character and Hannah's vessel? And Hannah's vessel met both Sam and Dean. Interesting.
That was when she decided it was time to go home.
“Do you know where they are?” he asked quickly. They had no time to mourn now.
But before he walked away, Sam leaned closer to Bobby.
“I assure you, he just wanted to save you.”
“Here’s the deal, Winchester” she said. The demon stood straight, looking into Dean’s eyes hard. “He became a mess because of you so you have a lot to make up for. You will look out for him there or I’ll find a way to break you.”
I have this thought about the bunker that, you know, it's a bunker, like those fallout shelters made during the Cold War, protecting against radiation and having everything needed for survival. Jenkins said in 'Slumber Party' that the bunker "is the last true beacon of light in a world gone topsy-turvy". The bunker is full of mysteries and there are just a few things we know about (like the computer that's powered by magical stuff and what about those files, Charlie!?). I hope that place wasn't just introduced for the sole reason of having a home base and a fix set.
She was almost at the edge of the woods when she heard a car leaving the garage. The car had a familiar rumble and the driver had an easily recognizable soul.
‘Do you know how many demons are in there?’ Sam asked. He eyed the plastic curtain warily.
“You know much about this” she said and blew her nose again.
“No. We have to stay focused.”
The corner of Sam’s mouth twitched down at that.
He felt Charlie’s concerned eyes on him and the regret that radiated from her. He didn’t blame her. She was curious, of course. And she wanted to help, because talking about problems is the first step to recovery, like his talk with Dean. But this one… This would take a long time before he could put it behind him, if he could ever put it behind him. Because it was an almost. And always the almost hurt the most.
I leave the bracelet there and look for a book that may help me. I take a big black one and sit down with it.
But Cas nods and my lips part slightly.
“You know what, Dean?” he asks. “I don’t care how useful you are. I don’t care that you’re basically immortal. I’m going to kill you slow and you’ll beg for a fast death.”
Dean stopped breathing and no matter how much his body was screaming in pain he sat up. He couldn’t let that happen. He couldn’t let Cas die. Because of him. Again. So he gathered every hidden power of his body and climbed out of the bed. He stubbornly made his way to the door but a few steps away from it his legs gave up under his weight and he fell on the floor with a loud thump. The arguing stopped outside and his door soon opened.
It began with little nothings. Creepy things that freaked the hell out of him, but nothing was compared to the later ones.
Sam’s hands tightened around the steering wheel.
Because he feared the moment he took a breath this image would vanish.
Was she crying?
Sam placed his forearms on the tabletop and leaned on them.
“You sure?”
“Good” she said. “Good.” The woman rubbed her eyes and looked into the light again. “Can I… Can I go to her?”
Or when they had been looking for their father and the cops had arrested them and Dean ‘told the sheriff Sam had been a dumbass pledge and that they had been hazing him’. He still remembered the relief when the cops had run out of the station. Sam had started to get suspicious.
Dean watched him for a while. Sam could see the struggle he went through, about to give in to his overprotective instincts, but then he handed the blade to Sam.
Hannah fell towards the ground. Sam grabbed her and hugged her against his chest as he fell on his knees. He felt something burning him deep down, but that pain was nothing compared to this.
“Cas.” He crouched down next to the angel and put a hand on his shoulder. “Cas, it’s me.”
The Mark on my arm flares up with a new intensity I haven’t felt in a long time. I feel the strength again. It flows through me like the blood in my veins. The First Blade is hot in my hands and it hungers for some blood. Some demon blood to be exact.
“We met her in early 2014. She ran away from the nest and was brought to the Sioux Falls police station. One of the vampires found her who you then killed and took Annie to your family cabin.”
Some other benefit of the demonic life is that there’s a great amount of stamina on the south. After the sixth or seventh round when she’s already so exhausted she doesn’t even know where she is I’m still going, thrusting into her nonstop.
Dean blinked and stared at Metatron.
Cas coughed up more and more Grace, his hair was damp of sweat, his breathing shallow and rapid. At this rate, he didn’t have much time left. But he would never change what he had said. Cas would live. Sam would carry him on his back and Cas would do it. Because it was Cas. The Cas he knew would never give up that easily.
Becky rubbed her palms together and muttered something under her breath that sounded like ‘Sam knows’ but he wasn’t sure. Then she quickly returned to her seriousness.
Despite how physically exhausting it was to run for half an hour or more, Castiel felt himself fresher. He had to realize he had never run as an angel, and only once as a human. Physical activity as an entertainment was relaxing. It gave him time to think while his body was working. He should continue doing this every morning. If he could wake up early.
sweeping away the wetness.
He was unconscious for a few days, he wasn’t sure. But when he finally woke, he was surprised to see where fate had taken him.
The information petrifies me. First of all Adam, my half brother who was possessed by Michael because of me. It’s been so long since Sam jumped into the Cage, dragging Michal and with that Adam along. I almost forgot about that poor kid. I never considered him family but he was family by blood. I should have done something after Sam got his soul back. A sorry excuse but a lot happened since. And now poor Adam stays in the Cage.
“Bobby?” he asked with disbelief then turned to the other hunter. “Lee? You’re alive? But… But…”
lowered to be at the same
The two left the library as they started talking to each other with lowered voices. One by one everyone turned back to what they had done previously. Sam ate his lunch in silence, but the food didn’t feel as good as it should be. Something unsettling grew inside his stomach, like something was missing. Something very important.
“Any more questions while I’m in a
“Emmanuel?” she breathed out, not believing what she saw was real.
“No, of course not” Sam had answered and pulled out his own laptop from his bag.
“Who was that woman in the forest?” Sam asked. “And if she’s connected to those demons, why would she bother killing those vamps? And why did she let us leave?”
Castiel’s grip tightened around the phone. If he were still an angel, it would be in pieces by now.
“An angel?”
was an idiot who thought he could save everyone then cried when he failed.
“Another!”
“Yeah?”
That was… kinda weird. He was sitting on a floor with a chair and the angel who killed him in an other time was apologizing to him for something he didn’t do yet. And hopefully wouldn’t. Every molecule of his body screamed to run away but he heard one tiny voice in his head: Dean ‘overprotective big brother’ Winchester had left him and Sam with Gadreel. Maybe he had done that because he had been running for Cas, and if there wasn’t something in the subtext his name wasn’t Kevin Tran, but Dean wasn’t that mindless to leave them with a murderer. Hopefully. Maybe he should trust Gadreel? Maybe he should give him a chance and just then judge?
Not even Bobby’s foreign contacts could help them. It seemed to be some kind of epidemic that affected only the stuffs that could be used in spells. And the cause of that was a big question mark.
“What do you mean?” Cas asked.
Just wow.
“I’ll do what I have to.”
According to a theory a Man of Letters had back in the 1800’s, pagan deities were ancient tulpas. Very powerful tulpas who couldn’t be erased easily. That man had thought that the sacrifices gave them the energy to evolve from ordinary tulpas to the gods and goddesses they were today.
As dead as anyone can be, or even more. Dead, like I should have been for countless years now. Why the hell did Dad sell my soul for me? Why, why,
“Gadreel just woke up” he explained between heavy breaths. “He said Dean’s not here.”
Meg laughed.
The praise heated up her cheeks and when Sam put her down and looked at her with those bright hazel eyes, Hannah felt the strange fluttering feeling in her stomach again. She learnt to welcome the feeling.
“It’s. Not. True!”
Sam shook his head.
“Good to see you’re not falling apart” Sam said and as he moved away he patted the former angel’s shoulder.
Castiel stepped closer and looked at the former angel.
“And what do you think? What would be better? Ragnarök?”
Oh, right. He forgot about them… The moment he had killed Abaddon felt like it had happened decades or centuries ago. And when Metatron had stabbed him…
“I don’t know. Ask your brother. He killed my son after all!”
“I’m sorry I’m so overprotective all the time” Dean said. “But I’m protecting you since I was four. Old habits die hard.”
“I heard about it” he said finally.
It’s walking down the corridor.
“Damn it…” His fingers moved on the screen like something was chasing him and when he finished he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. “What the…”
Kevin made a disbelieving noise.
“A gift if you change your mind.” Castiel heard him taking a step to the other direction then stopped. “Just an advice. If you end this now and go back he’ll be the same again. Not a demon, but a human. But I’m just talking to myself, don’t mind me.”
“Sariel?” Ariel asked.
Then put the hand on the
“I’m so glad you’re alive…” he said.
Dean stopped when he saw the fear on Castiel’s face. He looked down at the blade in his hand.
Dean sighed and rubbed his forehead. Yeah, Kevin was still angry, just like he had said. But he didn’t mind it. He was alive and that was enough for Dean.
“How may I help you, Dean?”
“You look better” he commented. And he really did. The paleness he had since the nightmare was gone from his face and his eyes looked brighter. Even his soul seemed calmer.
while then smiled gently
Sam smiled at him thankfully and handed Castiel a second towel.
So he opted for a not so old but not too new Ford. New cars belonged to rich people and the police will be after the rich people’s car in no time. He quickly hot-wired it and was on the road in a few minutes.
And as Elisa left, Hannah took over.
Sam sighed and reached out towards Gadreel.
“I know, I just…” He sighed. “I’m just scared, Cas. I can’t shake off the feeling that there’s something else. Like… I’m forgetting about something. Something vital.” He glanced at him. “What if it’s important? What if forgetting it means everything will turn bad again?”
? He should have let me die, let Tessa take me away to wherever I belonged. Which was Hell of course even at that time. I don’t know why I went to Heaven with Sam when Roy and Walt killed us.
Charlie loved their unshakeable faith in themselves. Even in the darkest times they never gave up hope and went forward without looking back. For some reason it reminded her to the Winchesters. Not because the boys were similar to these people, quite the opposite. She wanted to share her experiences with them. They needed to know that no matter what had happened, they could move on.
“CAS!” Dean shouted for the tenth, hundredth, thousandth time since he arrived here.
“Shut up, Paul!” Lee was about to make a step towards the other man but Bobby put a hand on his shoulder to stop him. “The Winchesters stopped the Apocalypse. We would be in a bigger shit without them.”
“Dean?” he asks hesitantly.
“I’ll stay” Dorothy spoke next to Charlie. “I have to look into some files and I’d like to ask for some help.” Then she looked at Ms. Tran.
The light faded and Castiel felt Muriel rushing by him, going for her blade for certain.
“They killed her… The Leviathans killed her…”
Charlie raised from her seat too, one brow arched.
“Ain’t angels supposed to be the good guys? Making miracles and everything?”
Castiel nodded and looked around. They weren’t on the move anymore. The Impala parked at the side of the road and on the other side of the street there was a familiar house. They arrived.
She was alive but not unharmed. She had many bruises on her face and there was blood on the corner of her mouth. Her cloths torn here and there and a big cut crossed her arms.
Kevin just blinked for a while.
Dean was quickly by his side, catching him just in time before his brother could roll down the mountainside. Dean grabbed his arm with one hand, with the other he raised his head.
falling. She was still loyal to God and she looked after humans. She was not like Lucifer who hated them out of jealously. She was not like Abaddon, Alistair, Azazel and many others among the third of her siblings who sided with Lucifer and left Heaven with him. She was not a villain of Heaven and humanity.
Sam pulled Dean into a hug. He hugged his brother so tight he almost squeezed his soul out of him but he didn’t care. They both needed this. Sam because he was grateful he had a brother like Dean and didn’t know how he deserved him, and Dean because that idiot had to finally realize he was not alone and Sam would always be there for him.
“You wanna drive?”
“No” Dean cut in. “We wait here.”
But now she could understand Castiel. More than ever. All the struggle he had gone through, not knowing what was happening to him, doing all of the thinking and the sorting out alone. She was lucky. There was someone she could ask and she should as soon as she got back to the bunker.
But now, without the main portal, there was no possible way for her to open one. There was no way for her to get down to Earth.
Dean carefully folded his fingers over his stomach not to accidentally remove the needle in his hand and fixed his gaze on the ceiling once again.
“Well, this symbol doesn’t. For humans you have this one.” Crowley showed them an other symbol. “It’s an ancient one, should be buried in the sand of time. It resurfaces the greatest pains the human had to experience the last time, making him weary and vulnerable.”
Hannah tilted her head. Was the human referring to her sitting into the machine? The only ‘ride’, noun and verb alike, she knew about was meant as ‘ride on a horse’. Maybe the word was connected to automobiles too.
“I wish I could help” the angel said with a low voice. “I tried to look for Castiel’s Grace countless times but Metatron hid it well. And he hasn’t said anything yet. I doubt he would.”
“I don’t know” he answered. “I think it wants us to stop.”
“My family was attacked by demons” she answered. “Can you help me?”
“No. I have to talk. Not talking means grudges and arguments. I need nothing of those anymore.”
“Fearing one’s own life is a basic instinct” the angel told her with a calm voice. “It doesn’t make you an unworthy sister.”
“Dean won’t come back unless we help Timmy first so see you in a few days” Sam said after he opened the door but stopped before he got in.
Not just because he had put down the phone before Dean could warn him with his own kind of ‘mom voice’. Not just because he did exactly the opposite of what Dean had been about to ask him. He gave the Impala’s keys to Charlie. Willingly. Earlier in the diner he had let Charlie pinch it but now he let her drive the car. Charlie was family but Sam wasn’t sure Dean would allow her behind the wheel of his precious Baby.
She placed her hand on Castiel’s shoulder and now she didn’t leave him time to move away. She healed his vessel and tried to put a barrier around his leaking Grace too. She couldn’t do much. She just slowed it down a bit. She could only hope it would be enough until they find Father Time.
Her words were harsh but rang with the truth. Castiel
Dean turned a little but Castiel still didn’t see his face.
There was nothing in the spa. Empty rooms, empty shelves and computers in the offices. And there were no leads that would give them some answers.
Dean’s sudden question startled both of them and they turned to look at the man. Gadreel could feel fear radiating from the former angel, afraid that Dean had might heard him talking about suicide.
“Does it really matter?”
“Not a problem to be concerned about” he said, turning his hand, looking at his fingers. “It’s just a phase. Your humanity and demon part is still struggling for dominance. Something must have triggered it and your soul didn’t settle down yet in favor of any sides of the two. It will pass soon.”
hand. The Blade that was still
The angel nodded with agreement and his eyes shined up blue. Sam’s face took on a Sam-like expression after the light faded. Sam looked around, a little disoriented, then his eyes settled on Kevin, clearly surprised to see him across the table.
Dean quickly stepped closer, grabbed her wrist and he looked deep into her eyes. She had to understand. She had to!
Sam quickly turned to Charlie. The woman had a hand on her forehead, rubbing it, while she had a confused look on her face.
They clinked their beers but Castiel didn’t put his heart into it. It was still early to think about this. The second week just started. Anything could happen. Or nothing at all. He had to prepare himself for that.
“What?” Sam stopped and turned to her. “No. Hannah and I are just friends.”
Dean stopped moving when he heard Castiel. Then he slowly turned around and Castiel saw the bottomless pits that were his eyes. He couldn’t pretend anymore.
Before the girl could finish she was already released and Dean was running into the woods. Sticks were breaking under his feet and the scarp was covered with fallen leaves. He almost slipped a few times but didn’t stop. He was so close. He had to be there in time. He had to… He couldn’t let that dick kill Cas, not now when they got a chance to correct every mistake they had done. To correct every mistake he had done.
Linda stayed with Sam at the storage building while Castiel drove away with Candy and Jerome in the Impala.
“You were an adult. An adult for a long time now. Just not your own person yet.”
Dean took a hesitant step towards the reaper.
An awkward silence grew between them. Dean didn’t say anything and Castiel couldn’t. It took a while until he trusted his voice again.
He squint his eyes, leaned closer a little and though the symbols looked sharper at the edges he still couldn’t understand a thing. How could that be? He was supposed to know every language of the universe. This was a simple ancient language. He should easily translate it.
Hannah thought back to the time at Nicole’s home. How she had helped her to understand the human world. She had also thought her how important it was to never trust anyone until you knew them better.
“Hey.”
“Are you hurt?”
“Of course!”
“You know, I know nothing about my family. I had no idea my mother was a hunter until you sent me back. Then there are the Men of Letters.” He sighed. “I reached a point where I wouldn’t be surprised if something gets found out about the three of us.”
“He’s more hopeful now we know Father Time is real but I think he’s getting worse” Sam answered honestly. “He tries to hide it but you have to be blind to not see how sick he gets with each day. I don’t think he has much time left.”
“You know that Honey loves you, right?” he asked.
Sam looked up. Dean was still rubbing his face, now with two hands.
“We don’t have much time.” Castiel stepped between them. Hannah noticed how sweaty his forehead was. His breath was shallow like he had a fever. “And any other options. We should check…”
She found Sam a very impressive human. He was tall, towering over everyone around him and still he had a gentle vibe she had only sensed around children. Sometimes she wondered, how could he be the true vessel of Lucifer? How could this nice and warm hearted man be the Devil? They called him the ‘
Sam nodded and started the car.
“I don’t hate Death” Meg cut in. “I only said I don’t think we can trust him. Death and God are big guys and we are just ants in their eyes. Why would Death help us? There are countless worlds out there. Why would he care about this one?”
“When did you see any of the episodes, feathers? I don’t think you would watch anything without your boyfriend.”
She was right, of course. He shouldn’t delay it any longer. So with a sigh Sam shut his laptop and fixed his eyes on it.
“Dean. Stop.”
“No, because in that timeline you, Sam and Charlie are dead. And I’m still Emmanuel.”
“You’re in denial, I see. Or perhaps you didn’t realize the meaning of your emotions yet.” He leaned closer, his face inches from Hannah’s, his eyes staring into hers deeply, looking for answers. “I ask you again. Who corrupted your Grace?”
Dean looked around his memories. They needed more people. It wasn’t just the three of them anymore but they were still just a small group compared to the demons and the angels. If only Bobby, Ellen, Jo and Rufus and hell, even Meg hadn’t died. Or if Benny was here. Not to mention the friendly angels, Gabriel, Anna and Balthazar. And Alfie too.
“So, Alex” Jody addressed the girl while looking back at the road. “You’re living with vampires.”
Oh, yeah. Jody didn’t know about it yet. Sam didn’t know how many times he had to tell that and the story of their time travel yet but he guessed it would be around a dozen.
Speaking of rolling, he just realized how much the cuts and bruises on his face hurt. Not to mention his back and shoulders. Killing those angels had done no good to his aching bones.
Still very un-beta'd. If you find any mistakes (grammar, logical, etc.) feel free to point them out!
“After he chased me around the bunker…”
“There are beings beyond us, Castiel. Little voices that whisper into the void and weave into the fabric of this reality. They admire you, they always have. They are the ones who brought you back to life so many times.”
“Now that I’m thinking about it. Something is not right with your soul. It’s older than it’s supposed to be. By a year to be exact.” Then his eyes shined up with understanding. “You’re from the future, aren’t you? You somehow found a way to travel back.”
“Please, Dean.” Cas’s voice was low and weak, raspy in a sick way. With every exhale a puff of grayish Grace left him. “The Mark corrupted your mind. You seriously think it holds any benefits?”
“But we didn’t notice it. Not until everything went back to normal.”
“Let me guess. A ripple is about to erase everything in this timeline and you’re looking for the components of a spell that can send someone back in time to stop it before happening.”
“Deserve forgiveness?” Dean smiled. “Neither do I, but you always forgive me.”
“I have an unfinished business” Cas explained. “I can’t move on until I’m done with it.”
Sam shook his head.
“She was a fool to come.” Malachi stepped over Muriel’s vessel and made her way towards Castiel. “She warded herself last week. We lost track of her but I’m glad we could put an end to this.”
He turned to his left. He was laying on the right side of the bed on his stomach. Then there was an empty space beside him, and on the chair sat Cas, one hand around his chest, the other holding his bowed down head. His eyes were closed and his breath even.
Hannah swallowed. She didn’t want to leave Sam alone when he was so desperate. She wanted to comfort him like in the library. She wanted to reassure him that she was here for him now too but this time she would not run away. She would do anything to make him feel better.
“I can’t promise anything” and before any of the Winchesters could say anything he put down his phone.
“So. What do we know?”
“Then you can open your eyes
“Yes.” Hannah nodded.
“Not now.”
He tried to free his arms from her grip but she didn’t let him.

“So? Any news?”
“I… I may try detecting Sam’s soul” she suggested. “It would take some time but…”
Ariel took Clara’s face between her palms and turned the angel’s head towards her.
“Of course he does” Sam said without his eyes leaving the page. “Death told me.”
moved closer, leaning into the
“Don’t come back without my Mom” Kevin warned them who had finally come out of his room around noon to see Sam and Cas leave.
He hoped the kid would come out after hearing his name but nothing. No movement, no noises. Dean sighed and looked at his watch. Today was the day they had come here a year ago. He had come to the barn, looked for some evidence and met Timmy. Then where was he?
“How do you like it?” he asked. “All those information. It must be a headache to keep them in mind.”
Sam put down his cup and looked over the other table in time to see Slim leaving and the three woman putting their heads together.
Del opened his hand and the phone with the hole in it fell on the floor. He then warily walked to the door but he didn’t step outside.
trustworthy. Or you don’t like him because he helped us lock Lucifer back in the Cage?”
Sam looked past him and really. He saw Bobby’s old car and some others he was sure was not from the Men of Letters’ collection.
“What’s up?” She stepped inside and sat down opposite to Dorothy. “Did something happen?”
“Oh. Oh, well, in that case, I have no clue.”
- Frozen did leak out on the net right after the premier *coughIgotittoocough*.
. He so wanted to run down the stairs and hug both Sam and Kevin but his feet rooted into the floor. He didn’t deserve the comfort. He didn’t deserve their closeness. Kevin died because of him in that timeline. It was his fault Sam became a killer. And Cas…
Hannah never understood this feeling Castiel felt towards the human. She hadn’t spent that much time among humans like the other angel so everything regarding emotions was a mystery for her. Of course she had her fatal flaw every angel seemed to have in common: pride. Tessa had hurt her pride when she called her unworthy. Partly that was what had led her to join Metatron. She had wanted to prove that she was worthy, more than Castiel who had thrown away everything for one human. Now she knew she had been wrong. She should have believed Castiel and should have stayed by his side. Maybe things would have turned out better. Or worse. She had no idea.
Cas frowned.
“No.”
They just stood there at the edge of the forest at the side of the road. They were alone in the area, nobody was as crazy as them to drive around on the snow covered roads. They were silent but the tension in the air felt like buzzing in Sam’s ears. Dean rubbed his forearm and looked everywhere but at Sam whose legs were freezing rapidly but he was determined.
Dorothy frowned.

“Then do it.”
Ed knew the other man was about to put down his phone. He was about to do that too but somehow he found his mouth opening as a single word left it.

The first hour of their journey went quietly. Charlie watched the Impala ahead of them, leading the way across Nebraska. Next to her Sam held the steering wheel in a tight grip, maybe not even realizing how white his fingers became. Charlie tried to keep quite, really. But after that one hour she found herself unable to keep her mouth shut any longer.
The spell felt old but new at the same time. Just like the warding that protected the vampires’ house. He couldn’t do anything but give in to the force that tore him away from Sam and sent him miles away.
“Bobby said you and Castiel had a fight.”
Castiel frowned at this and looked down at their hands. That was when he noticed an other change. The way how round Daphne’s belly was under her shirt that he didn’t see when she was standing.
“Father Time” Sam announced with a proud voice. They had been researching for days now and finally finding a single page about a god related to time who was not Cronus felt great. Those long hours finally paid off.
Bobby was right in front of Dean with a leap and put both of his hands on the other’s shoulders. That shut Dean up who closed his mouth tight, lips becoming a thin line.
“Stop crying, you big ox.” He gently patted his little brother’s back. “Your eyes gonna freeze.”
“Yes, I can!”
“I think it’s a ripple effect.” When both men looked at him questioningly he continued. “Something changed in the past and now the present is catching up to that change.”
“Cutting out the Grace would just make everything worse!” the other, a woman was heard. Dean knew this voice but couldn’t connect a face to it. “It would be better to…”
“Okay.” He placed his hands on his knees, leaning on them slightly. “I never believed any of this mumbo-jumbo stuff you boys are into. But that tractor just ran over Jack. Why would time travel be impossible?”
