Sherlock froze and struggled to breath. With a hand on Sherlock's shoulder, John gently guided him back to arm’s length, to see why he stopped. Sherlock looked awestruck. "John, John... I... I l-love you too!" The doctor burried his head in Sherlock's chest, not yet able to realize that he finally could held him in his arms whenever he wanted.

Heat rising to his face, his blush deepened significantly. What to do, what to do, what to do... The case had completely slipped from his mind, his only focus on his rebellious transport. Maybe he could... another cramp and Sherlock felt his anus open slightly under the pressure. Oh god... he was about to... and nowhere to hide... a deep moan echoed through the clearing. „Sherlock?“
He didn't know how long they already had been standing there, when he started to really feel the cold. He opened his eyes and looked around. Their sourroundings had significally calmed down and only a few people stll defied the low temperatures. On the other side of the ice rink John could see Sherlock's brother and his family.
Fourteen minutes and 30 seconds later, Sherlock re-entered the room. John was glad, his trousers hid his reaction to Sherlock’s naked body rather well. It wouldn’t do to reveal his own state of arousal to early. He cleared his throat and focused on the other man. “On your knees, Cadet Holmes.” Sherlock’s smirk faded as soon as it had appeared and he went down without protest, positioning himself the way John expected. Sherlock’s penis made a futile attempt of getting hard, despite the cage it was still locked in. It was John’s turn to smirk, knowing of the massive military kink Sherlock was sporting.
As Sherlock had calmes down, he disentangled himself slightly from John to be able to look down. With a deep sigh he pressed his face once more into John’s neck. His mumbling was barely audible. “Girl, 4 maybe 5 years old, parents divorced, the father took her here. She wanted to impress him, but got reckless. When she became scared, she grapped the first thing she could… in that case, me… Right?” The last words were directed at the little girl, who still clung at him with a desperate look on her face.
Lestrade frowns as he watches it, silently wishing he had asked for Sherlock's help sooner to stop so many people from dying, but he probably wouldn't have even taken the case.
“It does,” John assured her, though didn’t bother getting into detail.
"Because I wanted to be slightly discreet when asking my brother why he broke into a top secret government facility," Mycroft retorted dryly.
"My brother sadly doesn't understand emotions, because of his Asperger," Mycroft shook his head as he spoke and his hand tightened ever so slightly on his cane.
"You thought I was being overdramatic, calling him an enemy," Mycroft tutters.
“Why is he x-raying it?” Molly questioned, after all Sherlock had never told her.
"I don't think he'll care about that," Donovan retorted.
"She's either really persistent or just dumb," Donovan commented.
"What? No! What happens next?" Anderson cries as the screen suddenly turns black.
“I had more important things to worry about, like Sherlock dazed on the floor,” John defended himself.
"I hadn't thought of that," John admitted, frowning.
Everyone sighed in relief, happy that Henry didn't have a gun anymore. Though whether they were happy because it meant he wasn't a danger to Sherlock and John or a danger to himself, well that depended on who it was.
John smiled ever so slightly, even if it had annoyed him whenever Sherlock did it. It still was such a Sherlock thing.
Laughter filled the room, dissipating any tension that still lingered from everything that had been going on.
“Is Sherlock talking about the rabbit?” Molly questioned, extremely unimpressed.
"Leave me alone," Lestrade grumbled back.
"Probably a different taxi,"
Mycroft frowned at the story, but didn’t bother reacting otherwise, figuring that the damage had already been done.
"Hmm, I don't know, maybe because we had already seen it?" Mrs Hudson
"That poor girl," Mrs. Hudson whispered mournfully, pity swirling throughout her gaze.
"You know for a split second, I think Sherlock actually thought you were smart John," Lestrade jokes slightly, John huffs slightly.
Everyone, or at least those who liked Sherlock, winced at the reminder of Sherlock's death. The sadness at the reminder, outweighing the amusement at Sherlock's food.
Even though no one speaks, everyone thinks that that sounded exactly like something Sherlock would do.
"It was a good guess," Anderson piped up, giving John an encourging smile.
“It’s probably just an act,” Kitty huffed. John glared, wanting to correct her but knowing she was right.
After Molly sat down everyone else grabbed something thing to eat. Once everyone had seated back down, Lestrade finally seemed to realise something.
"Did anyone else notice the fact that Sherlock didn't say his bedroom, but the bedroom?" Anderson comments causing John to blush slightly.
John glares at her even harder.
Everyone laughed at the news, no one surprised as everyone who was there, flashed back to the Blind Baker case and Sherlock shooting the wall.
"Maybe because you are the killer, or at least the mastermind," Donovan hissed, glaring at the screen and getting a lot of glares in return.
"Pretty much," John replies, trying to be even a little bit civil.
"It's a brand of alcopop aimed at younger people," Anderson explained.
"Definetely better than I would have guessed," Molly murmured. She knew that she didn't have a lot of experience in that thing, but even she thought it was a good guess.
"That poor woman," Kitty muttered, glaring when Sherlock comes back onto the screen.
"Well, that's... disappointing," Anderson comments.
"It's true," Moriarty whispers, causing a couple of peole to frown over at him. And even more uncertainty filling a certain few.
“Holy shit,” Anderson gasps as Irene appears. “Why am I surprised that she’s still alive?” He questions after a few seconds, more to himself than anything.
A few people laugh at the deductions Sherlock made about John, while the other’s laugh at the resigned annoyance on John’s face.
"Is bringing more firearms really a good idea?" Mrs Hudson questioned with a huff.
“I can’t believe you would ever actually think that would ever actually work,” Lestrade commented, Sherlock never did what he was told.
"Well that's not suspicious at all," Anderson muttered quietly to himself.
They chuckle quietly, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade shaking their head at him.
Everyone breathes a sigh in relief when Frankland leaves. Hoping that they get out of this without getting arrested, or hurt.
"Since when was he nice and considerate?" Anderson asked, his voice borderlining shock.
Only John didn't show any surprise at Sherlock, the male instead, tensing, his previous outburst coming back to mind. Only when no one made a single comment about it, did he relax.
Everyone winced at Sherlock rounding on Mrs Hudson when she was only trying to help.
"Why would they call it a minefield then?" Molly questioned curiously.
"You know, for someone who spends so much time with Sherlock, you would think you could lie a bit better," Anderson teases, John blushes slightly as the others chuckle at him.
Everyone flinched, a few turning to check on John. Who had started to frown, cheered up as he remembered Sherlock's later words.
"Then hurry up!" Anderson hisses. Not because he hated Sherlock still or because he was mad at Sherlock. His outburst was purely because he was terrfied for that little boy.
The Yarders all raise an eyebrow in surprise at her words, while Molly flushes and John glares at her.
"We got notified to keep an eye out for it, just in case?"
A couple of people, mainly the Officers all chuckle at Sherlock and John's antics, and the annoyed face of Kenny.
"I feel so sorry for Sarah, having to be a third wheel, on her own date," Mrs Hudson teases causing John to grumble in annoyance.
Kitty stared at the screen in shock, never having seen Sherlock change like that so much. She couldn't help but wonder why everyone here thought Sherlock was so innocent when Sherlock was such a good actor.
"You can't just leave it like that!" Lestrade adds.
"We normally just eat out or Mrs. Hudson and I make Sherlock clean the table," John informs her, sighing quietly, "Whenever Sherlock actually eats that is,"
Kitty huffed, annoyed at how quickly Sherlock had managed to win him over. Pushing away her own doubts in the process.
"I thought she was dead," Lestrade commented.
"He made me send the text,"
"Poor Sherlock," Mrs Hudson and Molly both mutter. Though the older of the two says it a bit louder.
“I can’t just help my baby brother?” Mycroft questioned. Almost everyone looked at each other in disbelief.
"Yes because you can totally catch that bad of a cold in the span of two seconds," Donovan retorted sarcastically causing John to sink into his seat, cursing his younger, stupider self.
"Yes because that would help if actually bothered to look there," Anderson commented, sarcasticasm dripping from his voice.
"Whose that?" Molly asks staring curiously at the young woman.
"We know, it now" Anderson snapped back, feeling guilty about his younger self.
"Umm... I half didn't expect him to come," John grins slightly sheepishly, shrugging slightly.
"How does she know that?” Molly questioned with a frown.
"At least you didn't totally abounded him," Molly mused, a soft smile adorning her lips.
"All of this worry is gonna be the death of me," Mrs Hudson huffed, absentmindedly clutching at her chest. Lestrade hummed in agreement.
Everyone with a consciouness gasped as they heard the little boys voice. Molly reaches out and grabs Lestrade - the closest person's hand - and squeezed in horror.
Scrunching her face up in revolution, Kitty shakes her head at the man on the screen. She couldn't understand why everyone was so calm about this, simply shaking their heads and not getting mad. Her eyes flicker to Moriarty, hoping to see someone else disgusted, but the male was smirking. Kitty frowned at him before turning away.
"I can’t believe he gave up that case,” Kitty commented in shock, her eyes wide.
Kitty blinks in shock at Sherlock's answer, Moriarty was laughing quietly, whilst the rest just roll their eyes.
"What did you forget?" Molly asks leaning forward.
“Where did he put the phone?” Kitty questioned again, no one answered her for only John knew for certain where it was. Yet the others had ideas, they didn’t bother sharing it.
"I thought it might be important," John admits with a shrug.
"He observes unlike you people," Mycroft retorts sharply, though everyone just ignored the sharp bite to his voice.
"Who's the woman?" Molly questions curiously.
"I would hope so," Mycroft commented dryly.
Molly sighs in annoyance at them, shaking her head at the two. Wondering how someone so smart could say something so dumb.
The hansom ride home was an unpleasant one, only due to the fact that Holmes had rolled across a floor covered in blood and other unsavoury things and as such was not exactly a delight on the senses. Dusk had fallen and the silence between them was one of ease rather than discomfort, with the snow still falling and people in their homes, silence reigned supreme. Watson's gaze drifted occasionally towards Holmes, only to find each time he was already being watched as their gazes met. He was not sure what Holmes was seeing, but it was clearly quite vexing. It was a relief when the cab pulled up to Baker street, and home.
"We hope you enjoy your stay on the island sirs, and we'll be back in two weeks time to pick you up at the request of the elder Mr Holmes. The house is fully stocked and their will be no interruptions as this island is entirely private." The flight attendant grinned at the drop of John's jaw and escorted them outside, into a beautiful rainforest setting with tiny hummingbirds darting around and bright sunlight shining overhead. "Accommodation is on the south side of the island and the keys to the safari car" she pointed to a dark green, open topped land rover a little way down the runway "are in the glove box. There's only one road so there should be no trouble getting around, and a detailed map of the island is available at the house." Sherlock was already slumping against him, so John quickly thanked the woman (Jessica) and lay him across the backseat to rest before zipping off into the undergrowth.
Sherlock was furious. Who gave Mycroft the right to bring him here against his will? It was only a scratch, if he could go home John would take care of it in moments. Sherlock felt a pang of guilt when he thought about John. He had run off that morning without saying where he was going or what he was doing and John would wake up to find him gone again. To top it off if John had have been there the whole stabbing incident would have been avoided. Not that Sherlock was going to admit that.
He was just finished when the door opened and Mycroft strolled in. Sherlock scowled into the sofa cushions. Not who he wanted to come through the door right now. "Sherlock I must admit I was rather surprised when I saw you on the tapes, running about by yourself after a mad man, but then of course I remembered it was you and the scenario seemed... Appropriate. I must say that I did wonder where had gotten to, I know he would not be pleased to learn of your current condition, especially when he's already a slave to his emotions where you're involved." Mycroft smirked, twirling his umbrella in a manner that made Sherlock want to punch him. "Don't talk to me" Mycroft laughed dryly as his phone buzzed in his pocket "It's not me that you should be worried about talking to" he said putting it to his ear.
Mary Morstan told Sherlock and John she was pregnant on the 28th of February over Skype. She and John had wept, while Sherlock, ever poised, had let a few graceful tears trickle down his face and clutched John to him with every ounce of strength he possessed. He'd been sceptical when they'd first went to meet Mary, understandably so, because seriously it's a pretty massive step from jewels to pharmacy last time he checked but the opportunity was one they didn't want to miss. John's easy banter with her and Sherlock's well... being the least offensive version of himself for the most part had made the meeting feel smooth and easy, like (Sherlock imagined) they were all three old friends. Her terms had been very reasonable: She needed money for university, no more no less, She didn't need visitation because this wasn't her baby at all (but if they wanted to keep in touch she was happy to), and finally they were banned from using any part of her name. When the meeting was over, contract signed, and a date arranged Sherlock asked about the jewellery thing. She'd smiled and beckoned him closer with a giggle. "I really needed a job and they hired me. Plus the discount is pretty phenomenal." He'd chuckled to himself all day after that, and she'd told John, much to his chagrin, that he was a "keeper".
If he could sit up at an 87 degree angle, he might be able to get a look at the good doctor's face, see if it's Mycroft he's calling. Having big brother sweep him under some ‘private facility’ rug would be less than ideal, especially when there was something so interesting to do here. It wasn't often that a mystery, with himself at the apex, fell so willingly into his lap and he'd be damned if Mycroft sequestered him before he had the answers he desired.
“You.”
John hobbled from the cab to the door, getting steadily paler as he walked. Sherlock waited for him, knowing that he would not take kindly to being coddled nor would he enjoy being left in the dust. A very delicate balance to be maintained. There was, however, a limit to how much he would actually allow John to endure just for prides sake. That limit was fast approaching as he pushed open the door to 221. Mrs Hudson heard them come inside and bustled out to see how her boys were doing. "John dear you look very pale, are you sure you're supposed to be home now?" she asked, brushing nonexistent dust from his shoulders. "I'm fine Mrs Hudson, no need to worry, I just need some rest." Sherlock could feel him wilting and casually moved closer, making John lean against him. It was difficult to bite his tongue and not tell Mrs Hudson to leave them alone but when the old woman caught his eye she nodded and retreated almost instantly. "You take care of him Sherlock, I'll bring up some stew later for you both." She padded back into 221a and smiled slightly to herself. Her boys did make quite the pair.
When did I end up with a pair of six inch stripper heels in my coat? We should bring those two out more often, best club crawl I've done in years -GL
Mary and John's laughter drew him back to the present and he looked out the window at the streets outside, wondering how many more unnecessary roads the driver would take before bringing them to the right place.
"You always do."
Sherlock remembered every instance that was frozen on screen, he had pulled them out in his head when he missed John. The next photo was of the fall, and John's face as he watched Sherlock topple over, John being taken home by Mycroft and Lestrade, both in absolute silence, The look of fury and hatred in his eyes as he punched Mycroft in the face. Then it was just John. Lying on the ground of their flat, tears pooling and trickling down his face, him falling asleep with Sherlock's robe clutched in his hands, Sitting in his armchair staring at his hands. "Wait wait wait, my FAVOURITE parts are coming up!" Moriarty chimed gleefully. Sherlock, whose stomach was already threatening to empty itself with guilt and pain and want, dropped entirely. Out of the pocket of the coat he had worn the day of the fall, John produced a velvet box. The next photo was of him sitting at the table, opening it. Inside, a thin band of silver peered out of a cushion bed, and then it was gone, stowed away into John's pocket again as he grabbed his cane and limped out. The final few frames showed John at Sherlock's grave, shivering in the rain. He half smiled before leaving the box at the foot of the stone that marked where he was supposed to be lying. The screen faded once more into black. "Wasn't that just touching? Your pet was very fond of you it seems! We would be sooooo much better together, all that sentimentality was hilarious don't you think?" Confident that Jim couldn't see his face, Sherlock closed his eyes. John had wanted to marry him, was going to ask him if he would stay forever.
THE PARAGRAPHS JUST NEVER APPEAR DAMMIT! You can get a more or less properly paragraphs version of this under the same title on Fanfiction.net
The numbers on his forearm were still there, clear as day. Sherlock squinted at them, trying to see the important remaining two numbers. John cleared his throat, quickly moving away out of Sherlock’s reach. “Right. Get some rest, Sherlock.”
"Here we go" Sherlock affirmed as the three beats passed and the doorway was pulled open for them both to step through.
John wanted to shake himself, to wrack his brains and find even a twelfth of the intelligence Sherlock possessed so he might understand what was going on, anything to fix this. He had nothing, and he still couldn't see, couldn't use his best sense to try and read the situation. Maybe the light would help. The switch was a string pull system that would require him to walk a little way into the shelving units but at this stage, he was desperate. “I'm just going to turn on the lights alright? Just, just wait a second for me to turn on the lights.”
John half smiled at him and shook his head. It was nice to find someone else who cared about Sherlock as much as he did. That widened the pool to 3 people who loved him, and Sherlock probably wasn’t aware of it.
Sherlock smirked and rolled to face the two women who had been waiting patiently for their cue. "You can ask away now" there was an audible exhale and Mummy began her questions "Who was first to know? Are you putting this on your blog, wait do your readers even know you're together? Are you having a wedding because you know how much I love a good wedding, What about grandkids is that still on the table?" She babbled out all in a rush and John could barely follow what she was saying after the first three questions. "Molly, Mycroft, Mrs Hudson, Lestrade and team, You, Harry Watson. As for the blog no they don't know we're together and I don't know it's John's blog. The rest... We have yet to discuss." Sherlock answered softly. 'The rest' was a lot. John piped in "I think I am putting it in the blog, I want everyone to know that he's spoken for. Maybe that will stop everyone from ogling him on the street." The women laughed at look of exasperation Sherlock gave John who beamed at him until he smiled back. "D'you want a wedding? I'm easy either way, I'd happily marry you in a skip if that was what you wanted" he added to Sherlock only, who steepled his hands beneath his chin. "I feel the same way, so neither of us have a preference or any great feelings against it... If you wish Mummy we would not be adverse to a wedding." She clapped her hands excitedly and Mrs Hudson was all but bouncing in her seat. "Wonderful! Oh this will be just like old times Martha! We have so much to do, how about a spring wedding, that'll give us about five months to organise. You boys go see if lunch is ready. We'll need to call Antonio, you remember him don't you?" Sherlock pinched the bridge of his nose and swung himself up, took John's hand and stalked off to the opposite side of the house.
"I have to go but if this, if I'm something you might be interested in, I put my address in your phone and I'm there all week after today. Come see me." John breathed against his lips and then stepped back as a darkly coloured car pulled onto the runway, waving gently and then racing off with a phone against his ear. Sherlock for his part stood shocked on the tarmac, fingers tracing the imprint of John's lips on his.
John and Greg sat staring at each other through the brief exchange, fascinated by the dynamic the family had. It was quite unsurprising that Mycroft and Sherlock were the way they were if this was anything to go by. Family gatherings could not have been jovial affairs. Mummy- as all parties in the room called her for the guests did not know her name, glided to a throne like chair, heading the group. From her perch she could survey everyone. "You must be Gregory, I have heard an awful lot about you from Mycroft, you're the only worthwhile thing he has to talk about, I'm glad get to meet you, usually he would make some excuse to avoid this" she laughed softly at Greg's incredulous look at Mycroft who stared intently at his phone. John and Sherlock shared a grin at his expense. "Yes hello, and you are?" Greg held out his hand and she shook it politely. "Please, call me mummy, makes things much simpler." Greg smiled and sat back down, hoping to draw her eyes to John who sat quietly, praying that he was inconspicuous.
John shrugged. "I'm pretty sure every 16 year old works in Tesco at some point. Well, not you, obviously. But all my friends when I was growing up did and so did I. I spent an entire summer working back here when I was 16 and it really hasn't changed. Just like the door lock can be opened from the inside if you hit it at the right angle."
Which is why, as John was standing there tending to a paediatric patient with an unfortunate case of measles, aware of someone watching him from the entrance to the ward, he made to clench and unclench his left hand, like he always did when about to face an unknown enemy.
'You know I'd appreciate it if you didn't listen in GL.'
“Exceptional” Watson interjected “As always Holmes, truly exceptional.” He would be remiss in his duties as assistant if he did not pay the compliments that had come to define their friendship, and it would be a grievous falsehood to deny that he himself derived pleasure from the reaction his attentions received. The flush that overcame Holmes’ face at each ejaculation was very comely, and served as a reminder that despite his attestations to the contrary, the detective did indeed possess a great many emotions.
Sherlock barely caught the small pout the nurse shot John’s way before the tray was placed at the bedside table and the door closed behind her. He frowned as he registered a niggling feeling in his head.
John rolled him back onto his back and rekindled his assault on his neck, hands wandering south. A gasp from Sherlock proved they'd found their mark. John began to stroke up and down, Sherlock arching beneath him. The mere sight of Sherlock like that, toned body slick with sweat, putty in his hands, very nearly pushed John over the edge and he hadn't even been touched. Sherlock had noticed this and began his own explorations, his hands roaming over muscled chest and arms. He flicked tentatively at one of John's nipples and the soft hiss he got in response encouraged him. He began to play with each one in turn while John groaned above him. John's hand continued to move at pace, Sherlock knew he would not hold out much longer. He raised himself into a sitting position and pushed John into his lap. Sherlock gave a small roll of his hips, closing the gap between them, rubbing their hard flesh together.
"My palms are sweaty and while I'd like to hold your hand, this is the next best thing. Problem?" He asked, cheeky grin firmly in place.  Mycroft planted a soft kiss on his cheek.
sidled up to him, his eyes cold. Young Sherlock was enthralled by him. Understandable, Sebastian was a perfect specimen. Athletic build, sallow skin, short chestnut brown hair and those eyes. Ice blue, almost grey. He was a genius, Sherlock could tell right away and he was drawn to him. In his research late at night while Sebastian was away he figured out what it was. He had a crush. That was fine. He could deal with that, it was what happened after a solid week of not seeing Sebastian again that changed things.
Trust Sherlock to pick a hotel that supplied kettles and mugs to each guest to go with the abundance of tea and coffee available in their room. Their room. Sherlock had hesitated when the clerk asked what they wanted, settling on a twin bed suite. As they walked (cuffs removed "YOU HAD A KEY?!") to the lift there was a question on Johns lips, he could see the unrest in Sherlock's posture but the infuriating man had made a shhh gesture with his hand before John had even opened his mouth. It was in silence that they entered their room.
What was he supposed to do with that? Whether it had been pleasant or not, Sherlock had a history with him, one that John could recall in vivid technicolour nightmares. This was going to be his chance to apologise, to explain what had happened at Christmas and hopefully move forward, together. How could he do that now if Sherlock couldn't remember who he was?
Sherlock glared and took John's sleeve, gesturing towards the door. "They're aware of our arrival, knowing mummy their in the drawing room." John mouthed drawing room to Greg who just nodded. He had lived in the place for over a month now and still the upper classness of it all seemed ridiculous. "Lead on then Sherlock" and with that Sherlock took off at the same superhuman pace he always did, leaving Greg and John to jog along on his coat tails. "Probably a good time to mention that Mycroft calls me by my full name" Greg blushed a bit and John just smiled "I figured he would, Greg is just not his style" Sherlock had paused at the front door and held it open for them, closing it deftly after them. The hall was dark reds and mahogany, filled with statues and portraits that were lavishly expensive. John could tell that this was unsurprising to Greg from the first second. "So how long have you been living here?" Sherlock smirked at John, pleased at the deduction. John's stomach always did somersaults at that little smile of approval. "Little over two months now yeah, it's been... Well it's been different." they were making there way slowly towards the twin staircase that wound elegantly above their heads.
John sank into the seat happily, not saying a word. Sherlock appreciated John's consideration, it just showed how well matched they were that he would sit in total silence without being told off anymore. Sherlock watched the people who strolled through the park, counting four unhappy marriages, two unwittingly pregnant women, A police man with a crush on his superior (The ID said he worked in NSY. Obviously Lestrade. Sherlock put away that information for Mycroft torture later) and several members of a high profile swingers club during the two hours they sat. He was about to suggest a different spot when he saw it.
Mary smiled brightly at him and nodded, slipping a carrot stick between her teeth. “I heard you're scheduled for Christmas, Boxing Day and New Year's Eve, so I have two working theories. Either you're a complete workaholic or you don't have anywhere else to be. If it's the second one, a group of us are having a kind of ‘We're working and it's Christmas let's pretend we aren't here’ dinner that you should come to. If the first, you should come anyway.”
"Yes. But they'll be good different. Better. The three of us against the rest of the world." John replies softly, reaching a hand in to stroke her tiny and as she stirs slightly in her sleep. Sherlock's heart swells as he takes in this, the family he had never thought he would get to have, the love that he feels for them both making him want to stay in this moment forever as John sways softly and begins to hum a lullaby to their daughter:
Well, to clarify, he would have, if he had actually had a phone in his possession to pick up. Which was why, laying in her private maternity room, with her contractions beginning to amp up in frequency, and listening to John's tinny voice apologize for not responding, citing case work or sleep or a certain detective stealing is phone for the fifth time, Mary wondered why she had ever thought the birth of their child would go any differently.
"I'm calling Harry, you call Mummy and then we'll go get some lunch" Sherlock sighed but brought his phone up to his ear anyway. John gritted his teeth and dialed, listening to the ringing and almost hoping that she wouldn't pick up. She did. "Hello?" "Harry?" "John?! Do you need someone to bail you out or something because I know I told you the last time you bailed me out that I would return the favour but I doubt I could afford it" "No Harry I don't need you to bail me out, I work with the police on occasion, I have a blog?" "Oh yeah right, I keep meaning to read that blog of yours but I've never gotten round to it... What's been going on with you?" "Quite a bit actually but you first, how's Clara?" "She's good, still here if that's what you're getting at. As long as I'm sober she's staying with me." "That's really great Harry I'm happy for you. How's work, life in general?" "I'm a barista now, Starbucks. Clara and Tony, my sponsor, figured it wasn't good to work around all that temptation so I decided to leave the bar. Life in general... It's slow, kinda just trying to fit all the pieces back together after last year. But enough about me, what about you? Tell me everything, it's been a long time, almost three years since we've spoken." "I know Harry but" "It's okay Johnny, I understand that you couldn't do it anymore. No guilt in that." "Well I suppose I'll start at the very beginning. I moved to London again, got a flatmate. He's a genius and his name's Sherlock, he solves crime for Scotland yard and I'm his partner in crime. I may or may not have saved his life a few times and he's returned the favour." "He sounds interesting... What about your love life? That girl what's her name still knocking around? She had a great arse" "Em no. Actually Harry that's why I called. Sherlock's my flatmate..." "Yeah?" "and my fiancé. We got engaged yesterday." "OH MY GOD! CLARA! CLARA! JOHN'S GAY! HE IS! WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DO I KNOW! HE'S ENGAGED. TO A MAN. I'M ON TO HIM RIGHT NOW Clara says hello and congrats SERIOUSLY CLAR, GOOGLE HIM RIGHT NOW! SHERLOCK what's his last name?" "*sigh* Holmes." "HOLMES! One sec John I'm going downstairs to take a look." "Yeah I figured you would. I suppose there's no point in telling you I'm not gay? Probably not judging by those ear piercing shrieks." "I'm back! He's gorgeous, even I might give him a go, I mean look at those cheekbones" "Yeah I know..." "Well when do I meet him?" "Uh... He's not very personable... I'm warning you in advance that he can be very candid and he'll know everything about you just from looking at you." "I was never one to shy away from a challenge, plus I want to get to know the man who turned my baby brother!" "He didn't turn me, Harry look we'll talk more in person okay? I'll text you later and we'll meet up?" "God this is going to be very interesting isn't it? I'll talk to you later then Johnny, bye" "Bye Harry." The line went dead with a beep and John was left to figure out how best to introduce Harry to Sherlock, they were going to hate each other.
Once the snow speckled couple had 'finally deigned to grace us with your presence' Orabelle lead them all upstairs, chattering on as they went. "Let's see… tomorrow lunch will be served at two thirty, I invited dear Martha to join us but she's visiting her sister for the holidays so it will just be the six of us. I am assuming that you all brought presents?" she asked with a sly glance at the suitcases laying at the doors to their respective rooms. "We can do presents afterwards, and then in the evening les Holmes français ont arrivé which is perfect because I for one have been waiting an awfully long time to hear -" Greg attempted - in vain - to stifle a yawn and like the ordinary, doting mother she was Orabelle chivvied them all to bed. Within the pine scented confines of their room John splayed himself starfish style across the majority of the bed, Sherlock wouldn't be sleeping anyway. Sherlock lay with his violin clutched in his hands plucking the strings in a melancholy tone. "John?" he whispered, checking if his fiance was awake. "Yeah?" John called back to him, concern evident in his voice. Sherlock sounded unsure, and that just didn't happen. "I've been… researching." Sherlock paused dramatically and John waited for the second half of that sentence to arrive before he let his imagination run away with him. "Surrogates. I've been researching surrogates for us and I have realised that was probably not the best thing to do because most couples do this together and what not, and we're not yet married but… It's Christmas." and John, his wonderful, clever John, understood almost immediately. It was Christmas, and while they were surrounded by family and friends, there was a sense that the place was empty. He didn't want to spend another Christmas alone. "That's 'kay Sh'rlock, s'long as we make the final decision together I don't mind you doing your thing. We'll… start the whole process in motion when we get home?" Sherlock was upon him before he had the chance to register movement in the dark room.
The thing that threw him the most was that he wasn't sure he wanted to be, and that was terrifying. He'd known this madman all of two full days and already he'd managed to make John feel
It took only seconds. And without further hesitating, the doctor swivelled Mycroft's Chair and drew the shivering politician into a bonecrashing hug. „Shhh... it's fine, Myc. I've got you.“
"Oi! Not in front of the kids!" Rolling with his eyes, the politician stepped out of the way. Only now they saw who stood behind Mycroft. "Hi Greg!" John greeted the DI.  "Lestrade, what are you doing here? What happened? Is there another case you've failed to..." Sherlock tried to push John away, his mind already somewhere else. "Sherlock...! Dammit...!" John could just catch him in time, before the detective could vanish. He pulled him back, till the other man stood at his side once again. Greg's children, who stood beside him, giggled at Sherlock's antics. "Sherlock. Sherlock, stop it!" Sherlock's reaction to John's captain voice never ceased to amaze the ex-soldier. He calmed down immediately. "I don't think, Greg's here, because of a new case, Sherlock."
“I love you, Sherlock. So mu… oh god, oh… I’m coming…oh… Sherlock…” Perfection… Love… warmth… John let the darkness lull him in…
„God, Sherlock, you've really outdone yourself, haven't you.“ John groaned. „God, Greg you need to see this. This is so fucking hot...“ Sherlock eyes were red from crying, when he looked up, not sure he understood the man behind him correctly. Surely a man like John Watson wouldn't...
Holy fuck! Where the hell had that come from?
John enjoyed the cold wind on his face, while he glided with steady steps over the ice. It's been too long, since he last had the opportunity to stand on skates. As a teen and even later during university he had loved it to relax on the ice. It was in those moments, that he really could let go of all the problems and stress in his daily life. Maybe he should start exercising again. Reminiscing, he did some laps, before he looked around for Sherlock.
Donovan frowned, she hadn't even noticed who it was, just that it was for Sherlock and John knew about it from a look? Not that she was surprised, but she thought she was better at her job to notice when a serial killer called.
"I kind of feel sorry for the other passengers on the tube," Donovan added with a wince, wondering how terrified they had been of Sherlock.
“Wow,” Anderson can’t help but whisper, not expecting that.
"This is the first time I ever met Sherlock," John muses.
“Go Sherlock!” Anderson couldn’t help but yell out. Causing John to grin slightly at Anderson fully being on Team Sherlock, despite how much he used to hate Sherlock.
“That’s actually a good trick,” Lestrade complimented. “Especially with how insync you two are,” He couldn’t help but add, grinning as John huffs in annoyance.
“They were,” John confirmed quietly.
"When he's looking around like that, he kinda looks like he's gonna rob the place," Molly joked slightly but it just caused the room to get even more tense as they all subconcsiouly remembered the last days of Sherlock.
"So many deaths,"
"You just had to mention his cheekbones didn't you?" Lestrade can't help but tease. Glad when John just flushes and doesn't get angry at him.
Kitty hisses in disgust, not understanding how these people could support Sherlock. Everyone else sighs at Sherlock's behaviour.
“He’s figuring someone out, isn’t he?” Anderson questioned curiously, a grin finally gracing his lips.
"Watch and you'll find out," John snapped back, to annoyed at her to even try and be civil anymore.
Most of them blinked in shock at Irene talking to Mycroft instead of Sherlock. They knew that Moriarity had talked to Mycroft but they didn’t think it would be enough that Mycroft and Irene instantly assumed it was Mycroft.
"How did he know it was a female?" Molly can't help but question.
"Something is defiantly fishy," Molly commented, this time not joking.
"So that's how she knew so much about it," Lestrade commented absentmindedly.
"Aren't you left handed?" Lestrade asks curiously.
"A kid should never have to see that," Kitty murmured, just about the first thing she had said, that everyone else whole-heartedly agreed on.
"What's he talking about, Rachel?" Anderson asks curiously.
"That's Sherlock's plan?" Anderson questioned in shock, having expected something much more sophisticated as the plan.
Everyone frowned in confusion at Frankland helping them. Between Frankland popping up, and helping them despite obviously not being Mycroft, was very suspicious.
"Oh thank god, for a second I thought he was actually going to drink from it," Molly breathed a sigh of relief, filling ever so slightly silly when no one responded.
John smiled slightly at the fact that the two Yarders had none of their usual disgust or hatred in their voices when talking about Sherlock. And that Donovan called Sherlock, Sherlock and not 'freak'.
“Right?” Anderson cried.
“Nothing of importance,” Mycroft dismissed with a quick glance over at Moriarty.
"You probably should of trusted them," Molly pointed out and Lestrade shrugs.
"I think it has more to do with him being relieved than not caring," John argued softly.
Gasps fill the room, and Mrs. Hudson and Molly both cover their mouths at they stare at Soo Lin's limp body.
was the one behind everything, so of course he has the cans," Kitty retorted, disgust filling her voice as she said Sherlock's name.
"Maybe if you shut up and listen you would find out," Anderson snapped back with a glare.
Said person, the one who ratted out his brother, not Sherlock, obviously, stepped out of the car. "I am sorry John," Mycroft Holmes said, grief filling his voice, well just as much grief filled his voice as a robots'. John glared and Mrs Hudson just sighed. Nobody spoke for a while before Mycroft's wall cracked and a single tear ran down his face. "He was my brother John," He whispered which caused John's own walls to break.
Almost everyone bursts out laughing, snickering as John sinks into his seat.
Mrs. Hudson huffed as they headed into the woods. She really needed to stop worrying so much, especially since she knew that they would get out of this okay.
Sorry that this one is so terrible, I suck at writing confrontations and anything to do with emotions.
"If he was real, wouldn't Moraity be Sherlock's arch-enemy?" Donovan immediantly groans at Lestrade's words.
"Did you really think there was even a chance that Sherlock would watch television for anything but the news?" Anderson questioned, teasing Lestrade ever so slightly. Lestrade huffs.
"John you're married?" Molly asked in shock, sending a small smirk over at Mrs Hudson.
The originals snorted in amusement, while Kitty frowned in confusion. Wondering what was so different about Sherlock telling Mrs Hudson to shut up than Mycroft.

--3rd P.O.V.--
"Of course your a freak just like him," Donovan muttered, even though I'm pretty sure she'd already said something like that before.
“What does that mean?” Molly questioned curiously.
“Because he needed some time to himself,” Mrs Hudson responded quietly.
"Shit," Kitty murmured, her voice quiet, but everyone could still hear her.
A few people sighed at Sherlock trying to be nice was actually his way of solving the case. Though they weren’t partially surprised, those that liked Sherlock, liked to think that it had also been his own special way of trying to be nice, but not particularly knowing how to.
"How the hell did the freak help you with your limp?" Donovan snaps, but John pointedly ignored her. Whether because of the freak comment or because he just hates her nobody knows.
"You know, for a second I thought he had figured that out without the use of technology," Anderson admitted, chuckling slightly.
Worry filled the room, terrified that their cover would be blown then and there.
"Aww, sad that the freak will never love you back?" Donovan sneered causing Molly to glare at her.
"Has anyone else noticed that Sherlock seems to be grooming John?" Anderson asks turning around to face everyone. "I mean he keeps stopping before saying something important, letting you finish even if he knows you probably wont have it, he wouldn't do that with anyone else," Eveyrone frowns at Anderson's words, pondering slightly before they all turn back to face the screen, some like John still pondering the words.
"Mike, he was the one who introduced me to Sherlock," John answers, a faint smile adorning his face. All the other's looked shock in response to the ex-soldiers words. Beside Molly because she was there, kinda, and Mycroft cause his just creepy like that.
"He always knows when we needed help,"
"Holy shit," Donovan commented, her, well everyones, eyes are wide in shock as they stare at the screen.
All the originals glared at Moriarty, both on and off the screen, though mostly off the screen.
"A lot," John responded, chuckling softly as he remembered the look of annoyance on Sherlock's face.
A few people roll their eyes, huffing in annoyance.
"You say that like it's a bad thing," Donavan muttered under her breath.
"No," John couldn't help but murmur.
"Forgive me, please" Mycroft translated after half the people around him gave Mycroft a pleading look.
Everyone, except for Moriarty flinches at the sound of gunshots.
"Where'd Sherlock go?" Lestrade asks.
"When has there ever been something?" Anderson asks, but no one has the answer. Not even Mycroft.
Once again everyone flinches at the sight of Sherlock up high, even Donovan, though her's was more mental and very very deep down. It espically didn't help when Sherlock had climbed over the ledge, the only piece of comfort they had was that Sherlock wouldn't die, yet.
"Hey! That's what I said!" Anderson called out.
"You try convincing Sherlock of danger," John pointed out with a huff.
"Because of people like you," John snaps, "And stop calling him a freak!"
“She means the phone right?” Anderson questions, and John, who Anderson was looking at, nodded.
"Sherlock only said he wasn't coming, so I would give him the cigarettes," John explains.
"So that's how he knew," Lestrade mutters almost thoughtfully.
John huffed to himself, feeling annoyed that his past self didn't notice that Sherlock was lying! It looked so obvious now.
Everyone’s eyes widened as they realised what Mycroft was talking about, before wincing as they remembered how Sherlock was the one who figured it out.
"Of course not," Donovan dismissed, not unkindly.
“Probably on himself,” Anderson responded.
"I'm not sure," John admitted, frowning ever so slightly. Trying to figure out if it would have helped or hindered Frankland more or less if he had let them get captured.
"Why else would he be happy unless that was actually him?" Kitty points out, trying to prove to everyone that she was right.
Merry Christmas and a Happy Boxing Day
Everyone chuckles at the pair. "I can't believe you expected Sherlock to actually say yes," Lestrade commented, John huffed slightly.
"That poor woman," Mrs Hudson mumured, everyone felt sick staring at the crying woman. Why would anyone do this just for a game? Kitty stared over at her, but wisely kept her mouth shut.
Transcript: Arainedevere
"I don't get it, why would they bother to cover it up, they obviously saw John, so wouldn't they have seen John take the photo?" Anderson asked.
Not for the first time, Mycroft wished that Sherlock wasn’t so smart, so Sherlock wouldn’t accidentally ruin all his plans.
“What are you talking about?” Molly questioned curiously.
“Is that lipstick on his cheek?” Molly questioned, jealousy in her voice. A few people frown at that, John and Molly especially.
A few people sighed in relief, as Sherlock started acting like himself. Insulting people through observations.
"WHAT!" Molly cried in outrage. But she was the only one who was shocked, as Mycroft, was well Mycroft, John and Mrs Hudson trusted Sherlock and the yarders mostly Lestrade had noitced it.
Most of the people sighed at seeing the enthusiasm dying in Sherlock’s eyes. This being the first time they had seen the usual Sherlock on screen for a while.
"I can't believe I'm saying this but he's right, what if you walked into on coming traffic?" Mycroft, yes Mycroft, commented slightly shock in his voice as Anderson smiled proudly.
"If Sherlock really created this case, why would he be so confused about to why the painting is a fake?" John couldn't help but point out.
"Not a word,"
"Don't worry Mrs Hudson, the nightmares stopped after I met Sherlock," John's voice went from happy to sad as he remembered his best friends death.
"But... they weren't blanks the gun was empty," Anderson questions.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"I thought she actually cared about Sherlock?” Donovan questioned sadly. Even if she liked Sherlock, she still knew how hard it was to be rejected by someone you cared about.
Fear and worry shot everyone at the sigh of the door being jemmied open. They had no idea what was happening, but whatever it is, there was no way it could be good.
Everyone, even Mycroft jumped at the howl. Their eyes frown, because the hound wasn't supposed to be actually real.
"Uh, no but I don't know if he ever saw it or not,"
"His lying," Mycroft tuttered half in shock.
"Well I didn't know that before,"
Transcript: Arainedevere
“Thanks,” John muttered sarcastically.
Everyone winced in pity as Henry started to weep, no one knowing what the poor male must feel.
Everyone chuckled slightly, even John at that.
"She has a point," Mycroft says, in his usual annoying tone.
"That's the killer, isn't it?" Molly asks concern lacing her voice.
“Though did Sherlock actually put the phone into the deposit box or did he just visit it to throw people off?” Anderson questioned curiously.
„Sherlock, stop it! Now!“ Sherlock felt someone stepping up to him, entering his personal space, while he still tried to open his zip. By now, the first dripples of diarrhoe had soiled the black cotton of his boxers, the wetness strangely pleasant against his skin.
Sherlock could only whimper in need. His sweatsoaked hair fell him into his eyes, when he turned back, desperately tilting his ass back, hoping John would fuck him soon. How he needed it! His inner walls pulsed in a fast rhythm, craving the doctor's cock inside.
Entering the bedroom, John stopped for a moment to fully appreciate the view. Sherlock was lying on their bed, arms and legs spread, his white skin almost glowing in the dim light. God, how he wanted to taste and lick and mark his friend. His lover. His husband. “Mine.” His possessiveness was upfront, but with an internal shrug, John let it happen. John was aware of the fact that he could get rough in this state of mind, but he knew Sherlock would actually stop him, if it, if he, got out of hand.
Their eyes met and held each other. Sherlock sobered up and turned, so he could directly face the doctor. “Yes, well… I-I just… I... wanted to… ehm… That is to say… Thank you, John!” It was an unusual sight, seeing Sherlock struggle for words. John’s heartbeat accelerated dramatically. Affection? Who was he kidding? He was head over heels in love with this impossible man! He almost missed Sherlock’s next words, reflecting his own emotions.
________________________________________________
„Aaaaah, mate, I think we've finally found the off-button. God, John.... hmmm... this was the best idea ever...“ After another handful of thrusts, Greg pulled out of Sherlock's heat and with a hand in his soaked strands, he pulled the man's head back. „Look at me, whore!“ With wild and fast strokes Lestrade pulled at his almost purple cock. When Sherlock let his tongue poke out and accidentally touched the engorged tip, the DI lost control and came all over Sherlock's face. Hot streaks of sperm hitting his lips, his cheeks, his brows.
“Especially, when they’re not exactly one-sided, or are they, Sherl?”
A hot spurt hit him on the chest, a second on his stomach. The smell of urin filled his nose and a deep moan built in his throat. God, yes... His arousal tightened deep in his stomach, a throb that shook his whole body. It wouldn't take much now, to let him fall over the edge...
John couldn't stand it any longer. Decision made, he stood and went to the door. No sound came from the couch. He put his shoes and coat on, before he took Sherlock's coat and scarf and threw it on the other man. "Umpfh..." Sherlock groaned silently, as the heavy Belstaf landed on his stomach. John saw his flatmate blinking fast, as the detective tried to orientate himself. "Come on, get up! I need some fresh air and you'll accompany me." The tired man, who slowly sat up now, had no resemblance to the otherwise so energetic consulting detective. "John..." Sherlock whined, but he only shook his head. "No! No discussion! Up you get!" He gave Sherlock his shoes. "Put them on." Tilting his head to the left, John watched with a lifted eyebrow, while Sherlock put his shoes on. John knew, that the younger man tried to stall their departure, but the ex-soldier was determined to get Sherlock out of the house. Finally he nodded happily, took his keys and purse and let the way down the stairs. "Will you at least tell me, where we're going?" He sounded exasperated.
„Do it, please, John... ahhhh.... p-p-pleeeease...“ Sherlock couldn't stand it anymore. If he wasn't fucked right this moment, he probably would die. A dark chuckle answered him. „Die, hmm? We can't have this, slut.“ Without further hesitating, John breached Sherlock's muscles and filled him up, pressing soft shit out of the man below him.
„You've done all of this,“ looking around pointedly, „became who you are today, just for him. To be able to protect him. You couldn't tell him how much you loved him, so you decided to love him from the distance.“ John saw Mycroft paling, but not willing stop now, he continued. „So...“ their eyes met. „...do it for Sherlock. Do it for your little brother. And admit that you love him!“ And just with that, John had won their battle of wills.
Sherlock raised his head. He followed John's gaze and nodded. „Yes, they do.“ He nestled further into John and for a while they watched the small family together. „Shall we head home?“ John was freezing by now.
Sherlock had once told him, how amazed he was at how unassuming John usually seemed to be, when he could switch into soldier-mode without so much as the blink of an eye. “Just a social meeting, honey.” He dared him to say something. Both men knew punishment would be in order should Sherlock take him up on it. And Oh, what ideas Sherlock’s blush gave him.
„You're ok, Sherl?“ John stroke lightly over the younger man's arms, which embraced him tightly. A deep grumble vibrated through John's whole body. It was a sound he desperately wanted to conserve, memorize for the rest of his life. „Are you happy?“ Another low hum. John closed his eyes and enjoyed the quiet moment. He knew with their way of living, those would always be rare.
Mycroft, who hadn't said a word, since John had begun talking, slumped down at the doctor's last words and covered his face with his hands. Tired of always being in control. Defeated. John stood and with slow movements, to give the other the opportunity to object, he stepped around the large desk. Not stopping until he was close enough to touch.
“Lay your legs around my hips, love.” They had been in the middle of a scene, but John wasn’t interested in dominating Sherlock anymore. A gentle kiss and his possessiveness had drained away, until the only thing on his mind was the wish to make love to Sherlock. No matter how clichéd it sounded. Sherlock didn’t question the change of mood, but moved as asked. He hugged John tightly, groaning deeply as he got the much needed friction when he was pressed to Johns abdomen. With one hand in Sherlock’s hair, John positioned himself again, before sliding into the damp heat at last.
John smirked, glad the man leaning against him couldn't see it. Now that they had cleared the basics, he knew perfectly well how he wanted to proceed. „Good, pet. Sit. Then let me explain, how this will go.“
Sure, that he had Sherlock’s attention, John showed him the small key for the cock cage. “Shall I free you now?” Nodding. “Yeah? …I will… you have been so good for me, pet. You took your punishment so well…” John let his tongue slide over the metal, still teasing his lover. And himself… “Mind you, Sherlock” he said, while opening the device. “… you’re not allowed to come, until I say so. Ok?” Sherlock nodded. “hmmm…” John pulled the cage off and Sherlock’s cock immediately stiffened. Within seconds he was rock hard and both men groaned relieved. John was aware of the edge Sherlock was walking on. One touch to his oversensitive cock and his husband would come.
John let go of Sherlock and looked down at the miserable little girl. The kid tried to stand up, but her skates instantly slipped away. The sudden jolt down was almost enough to pull Sherlock on the ice as well, hadn’t he foreseen the movement and clasped John’s shoulder. Smiling, John looked up at his friend. “In her place, I’d also preferred you to the rink.” The other man chuckled, while John flushed bright red. Even his ears felt hot. To hide his embarassement, he got down on his knees to be on eye level with the child. She sniffled a bit, but otherwise tried not to cry.
It took a while, until Sherlock seemed to be able to focus on John's soothing voice. But finally he took a shaking breath, than another. “Good… now, hold it. Yes, you’re doing so good, sweetheart. Now out.” With one hand on Sherlock's breast and the other on his shoulder, John guided him through the panic, until Sherlock calmed down again. John wondered when he had become an expert in handling the Holmes' brothers.
We need to talk. JW
“It’s been a long time, since I stood on skates, although I always loved it. So I guess, what I mean is… thank you, John, for giving me this!” An honest smile, which the detective only ever addressed to him, got him weak in his knees. The doctor hoped, his burning cheeks were concealed by the blinking lights or that Sherlock would perceive it as a reaction to the low temperature. “Of course, Sherlock! You’re my best friend!” And so much more, John thought. He shrugged his shoulders. “To be honest, I just hoped, it would distract you from the case. AND you like dancing, so I figured you might know how to skate as well.” Sherlock nodded to John’s rambling words. John opened his mouth to say something else, but the words didn’t want to come out. He closed his mouth again and took a deep breath. “Yes?” Sherlock looked expectantly at the smaller man. John noticed him staring at his mouth. Slightly embarrassed, he coughed and tried it once more. “Well, I also thought, it might be more…” his voice softened and finally died away...
Greg tried to hide his laughter behind a cough. „Yes, well... anyway, we'll leave now. Bit of a distraction can't hurt after such a shitty day.“ Although a shadow fell over his eyes, when he remembered the events of the last hours, his grin broadened once again. „John, pub night tomorrow?“ John was thankful, that his friend didn't break out in roaring laughter at the surely exceptional sight, and nodded. Even Mycroft seemed a bit happier, observing his little brother clinging to the smaller man. Their eyes met and Mycroft nodded in approval. With a last glance at Sherlock's locks he turned and walked to the glass building beside the rink to hire some skates. The kids ran after him screaming in pure excitement. Greg still smiled knowingly, while the looked back and forth between the two men, till he finally stopped in favour of looking at Sherlock instead. „It was good to see the two of you! I'm glad you finally figured it out.“ Sherlock's response consisted of a low hum. Over his head, John and Greg shared a gentle smile. Holmeses... „I'll call you, Greg!“ Greg waved his goodbyes and left, turning in the same direction as his family to join them.
Mycroft huffed in annoyance at his brother insulting him. He was not getting slow!
"Really?" Lestrade sighed as he stared at the present Donovan, who sighed.
"Obviously not," Malcroft sighs, and Molly huffs her head bowing ever so slightly in embarrassment.
"You know, for not being a housekeeper, you have got to be the one in the world," Molly comments, John instantly voices his agreements causing Mrs. Hudson to blush slightly with all the praise.
“Oh my god,” Molly gasped in shock as she realised that the passengers were dead. Her eyes were wide in shock, as the others echoed her sentiment.
John finally lets go of Mrs Hudson at the proof that she was okay. Mrs Hudson smiles at John, though when he turns to look back at the screen, she subtly rubs her arm.
“Wouldn’t it be better for Mrs Hudson if she left?” Donovan questioned curiously.
"Sally, shut up." Lestrade snaps.
Despite the truth in John's words, a few people couldn't help but chuckle in amusement at them.
"Sherlock doesn't actually break the law, he just walks a fine line between it," John points out, a bit to sharp.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"What's going on?" Molly asked curiously as they at the long line of patients. John winces slightly fully realising what time this is. But doesn't respond, to embrassed, besides she'll find out.
Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, though they were all still extremely intense.
"Did he really not notice, the freak was right outside!" Donovan snarled. John, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson all glare at the girl but they don't have any comebacks at they were wondering the same thing.
A week before…
John and Sherlock had just closed the door of 221B behind them, when Sherlock fell to his knees and immediately began to beg for release. It’s been seven days since John had put the cock cage on Sherlock and he knew that the detective was beyond desperate by now.
Still, Mycroft kept silent. „You watched us, you listened to your brother's confession. And don't lie to me, Mycroft. We both know you have cameras in our flat.“ John had found one of the cameras when he cleaned the mantle, just before the brother's last encounter. Assuming there were others wasn't too far stretched. "Classified data, I'm afraid." John began to regret he hadn't had the foresight to bring the crop.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Picking up their tea in the kitchen, he put the tray on the table before climbing on his husbands lap, where the doctor promptly settled down. Snuggled close, John's head neatly tucked under Sherlock's chin, both enjoyed the rare quiet moment. John's mind began to wander, until... “Will he come?”
When he had calmed down enough to being able to breathe again, he saw a puzzled look on Sherlock’s face. It was adorable. John bent down again and gave his husband a deep kiss, that left them both breathless. “Up you go, pet.” He pulled him up. “I want you on our bed. NOW!” Sherlock sprinted to the bedroom to follow his orders, while John followed with slow steps, trying to regain at least a semblance of control.
Sherlock went back to his newest experiment, letting the matter go without further questioning John's interest in his brother-in-laws whereabouts. John's grin grew sharper. Obviously Sherlock knew, or at least suspected, that his partner was up to something, but chose to ignore it for the time being. No surprise there, as both brothers were touchy regarding sentiment in general and in particular with their own feelings.
“Yes.”
Warmth against his hands, before they were pulled from his crotch with force. „What the f...?“ Sherlock struggled against the strong hold, forgetting his task to keep his muscles tense for only a moment. It was all it took. He whined and relaxed into strong arms, when the first waves of shit exited him. With each explosive, wet fart, his cock throbbed heavily. Sherlock didn't know whether he was in hell or heaven. Each wet dream he ever had becoming reality in the most humilating way.
„Like what you see, bitch?“ The police man strolled forwards, till Sherlock could smell his own urin. His hips moved on their own account, seeking much needed friction. Another moan slipped from his mouth, Sherlock had lost any control. „Oh someone's really eager... you'll let us do anything, won't you, cockwhore?“ A constant stream of moans, followed Lestrade's words.
"Come on, we've landed." he said softly, picking up their hand luggage and standing as the stairs were lowered. Sherlock yawned and rubbed his eyes, following John so closely John could feel his breath warm against his neck.
Fuck. Sherlock raised an arched brow and took a step closer as John attempted to move behind the counter, praying that Sherlock hadn't seen the physical manifestation of his thoughts. A slight smirk had broken out on Sherlock's face as he cornered John, his half naked body pressed so close yet not quite touching John's. "Did you know" Sherlock murmured in a low baritone "that I have quite a weakness for sailors? Especially consulting bloggers?"
I was experimenting with blood sugar levels on ones ability to function, as you know my dietary habits are less than what most would consider to be normal and by extension so is my blood sugar but I have been taking pills to lower it even further ( for the case John!) and I may be in trouble -SH
They've done this before a few times of course, but never quite like this. There was always a part of Sherlock, John knew, that he kept back, held onto and tried to hide from him while they did this, closing his eyes, turning away, but not today. Maybe because he can't, positoned as he is in John's lap, but John thinks it's something deeper, something primal and honest at the core of him that needed to be here to be freed.
The first thing John saw when he opened his eyes was a mop of dark curls nestled snugly into his shoulder, as if it, as if he had been made for this exact purpose. He stared for a while at the bare back his arm was under. It was pale and skinny, but still muscular enough to exude a strength. It was peppered with small scars. He sighed, not wanting to ruin the moment with his questions. He swallowed them instead, saving them for another time. "Morning Sherlock."
"So yeah, I guess that's a plan" John smiled at Greg as they closed the door. "Hello Sherlock, Mycroft" John bustled into the kitchen. "Tea Greg?" Greg smirked at the light pink dusting the brother's faces "Ta John. Afternoon Mycroft, Sherlock" Mycroft smiled tightly while Sherlock grunted. "How does Saturday look for you?" Lestrade took out his phone. "Around eight good for you John? I've a meeting till about half seven but I should be able to make it across in no time." Sherlock looked across at a bemused Mycroft who simply shrugged, this plan was new as their calendars had no record of it. "Saturday at eight sounds good to me." Sherlock watched Greg squeeze John's arm in... Solidarity? Before John blushed and smiled at Sherlock shyly. Roll the dice Watson. "Erm Sherlock?" Sherlock's heart was pounding. Was this actually happening? "Would you maybe um...Wouldyouliketogooutonadatewithmeonsaturday?" The faster he said it the easier it was, until the words were a blur of long vowels and harsh consonant sounds. Sherlock replayed the audio again in his head just to be sure, and his face broke out into a beaming smile when he nodded. Greg cleared his throat before turning to face Mycroft who was already pretty well stunned "Mycroft would you care to join me, I think a double date requires two dates, unless I'm very much mistaken?" Greg sounded suave, confident. John kicked him for having the gall to hide his nerves. Mycroft blushed, the colour standing out against his usually neutral face,and nodded. "I believe I can clear my schedule." John turned back to the kettle and slyly high fived Greg as he passed.
" John says.
"We've already gone over it, he's not faking." Anderson snapps back before turning back around to the screen. Donovan frowns over at him before shrugging it off.
"Oh John," Mrs Hudson, grabs John's hand and John smiles slightly at here.
"Because Sherlock would care about that, why?" Molly questioned in confusion.
"I can't believe she's still talking to you after the last case," Anderson commented wistfully, the others who were there during the case hummed in agreement.
"How is he being so calm? If that was me every second word he spoke would be an insult?" Anderson cried.
"I was right!" Donovan cried as she noticed the word 'Supernovas' appear on the world.
"Did he do that the whole time?" Anderson asked, turning to stare at John.
John huffed quietly to himself at the continuous mention of him and Sherlock being interested in the other.
Despite it just being in a cage covered by a sheet, everyone was still relieved that John had managed to get to somewhat safety.
"Because she wasn't being mean," Mrs Hudson scolded.
"What could possibly be so remarkable about Johns hand?" Donovan asked, and like half a million other times, no one answers the question.
"I didn't know that Sherlock could drive," Anderson commented in shock.
"John!" Molly mutters and said army doctor grimaces slightly.
“No,” John admitted softly.
"I feel sorry for him," Molly murmurs. "Finding out that he had killed his sister when he needed everyone he could get would have been heartbreaking," Molly explains at the curious looks people sent to her. The others all nod in agreement.
"Not this guy again, he's really starting to get annoying," Anderson commented.
“She probably killed the rabbit,” Mycroft interjected. “Less anyone finds out that she messed her job up,”
"He does consider you one of his few friends, or he will," Mycroft commented adding the last part as he stared at the screen.
"Just because it's the hound isn't really, doesn't mean there weren't any other dangerous things there," Lestrade pointed out.

“Enjoying yourself?” Donovan questioned in amusement. Lestrade hummed in amusement, while everyone else chuckled in amusement.
"Really?” Mrs Hudson frowns slightly over at Mycroft. Though her tone was mostly teasing, after all, she had gotten used to the Holmes' weird sense of humor.
"The first part doesn't make it any sense, but the second part is 'What does he want'"
The two newbies frown in confusion, Kitty glances around but doesn't speak, deciding to just observes for the time being while Moriarty smirks at the other's trying to annoy them, which worked wonders.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow, he didn't remember his brother giving him the plans back that soon.
“Yep,” John answered, slightly annoyed that his friend only really acted nice when he wanted something.
"Who would do such a thing? And to their sister no less!" Lestrade hisses in disgust, everyone hums in agreement.
"God does he have to be so dramatic?" Lestrade sighs.
Everyone, espically John who bows his head afterwards, flinches at the scene in front of them. Without speaking, Mrs Hudson and Molly hugged John as Mr Lestrade squeezes his shoulder.
Lestrade sighs at Sherlock’s words, remembering that Christmas and hating that Sherlock always had to be right.
"Since when was Sherlock normal?" Molly asks, laughing slightly.
"I had to make sure, but I don't exactly how they could of missed something that important." Lestrade says, almost apologetic towards John.
"Not much? I'd say he'd got everything!" Lestrade announces shocked and John frowns.
Any amount of cheerfulness was lost as Sherlock talked about love. The small smile appearing on John’s face disappearing at the mention of Sherlock not believing in love.
Everyone snorts at Sherlock having no idea if it was an acronym or not. Though everyone guessed he was correct, without having to ask.
Almost everyone glares at Neilson, more than one of them wishing that the injuries that Sherlock had given him had been enough to kill.
Any and all anger anyone (namely John) felt at Mycroft yelling at Sherlock was gone as he genuinely apologized.
Even Donovan or Kitty can't help but laugh at how annoyed and ridiculous Sherlock looks on the screen.

"Freaks probably just pretending to be oblivious," Donovan muttered causing everyone else to glare over at her.
-----
"He's definetly not what I expected," Molly commented, shock lacing her voice.
A few people, mainly the Yarders, chuckled at the mention of the hat. Knowing how much it pissed Sherlock off.
Kitty questions.
"What's he talking about?" Molly asked curiously. John frowns softly, thinking back to that day.
"Of course Stapleton doesn't have access to that," Donovan grumbled, wishing that for once things would work out for them.
Anderson, Lestrade and Donovan all wince in empthay at John's rapidly dispairing look. Remembering what it was like to have Sherlock tell you that your best theory was bad.
"Isn't it obvious?" Molly asks almost sarcastically.
"Who knows, maybe she mucked up the translation," Molly answers.
"But how can that lead them to the killer?" Mrs. Hudson asks confused.
“What’s going on?” Mrs Hudson questioned worriedly, looking over at John to make sure that he really was okay. John opened his mouth to explain, only to be able to say nothing. Which only increased everyone’s worry.
"Yeah, like the freak could ever be called good," Donovan hissed.
"If it's a confession then why didn't Sherlock bring him in?" Anderson points out, but no one answers, cause well, they'll find out.
"Is that the girl from before?" Anderson questions, his eyes narrowing in on the homeless girl.
A few people chuckled at John’s joke, though most of them were still curious why Sherlock seemed to care so much about a counter.
“Why am I surprised that Sherlock actually checked it?” Donovan questioned curiously, after all, of course Sherlock checked it to make sure she wasn’t faking it.
"He has a point, what else would it be?" Lestrade added, grinning over at his friend.
A few people blinked in shock at Sherlock wanting the camera phone. Sherlock’s constant words about how sentiment was terrible ringing through their eyes.
"You really are a gentlemen," Molly teased at John.
"It's merely a cover story, so people don't wonder in," Mycroft explained.
"Besides, why would Sherlock even waste time doing all that, it's not like he ever actually needed John," Anderson adds before wincing slightly, "that came out wrong," He muttered.
Anderson snorts as Sherlock calls the men stupid. HIs mind flashing back to everytime that Sherlock called him stupid.
“That’s kind of terrifying,” Molly admitted, already kind of freaked out after everything that had happened to John.
“Oh please, like a coffee shop would be dramatic enough for the great Mycroft Holmes,” Lestrade jokes, much to everyone’s pleasure. Except for Mycroft who glares at the Inspector.
Transcript: Arainedevere
"Is it bad that the first thing I thought of was if a tree falls in the woods with no one around, does it make a sound?" Anderson randomly asks.
“Oh please, like Sherlock would just hand it over,” Mrs Hudson huffed, and shook her head.
"What was that?" Anderson questions curiously. Turning to stare at John who shrugs. Just because John knows what it was, doesn't mean he understands it at all.
"He looks mad," Kitty mutters in disgust glaring at Sherlock.
“He did in the morgue,” Molly couldn’t help but point out, shooting a pointed look at Mycroft.
Everyone laughs at that cause it was true.
“So that’s what was around his neck,” Donovan muttered to herself, only having glimpsed it.
Almost everyone gaped at the screen. None of them thought even for a second that Sherlock would actually call the police anytime soon.
“Most likely,” Mycroft responded sadly.
"Shut up!" Lestrade hisses at the same time.
"I... don't really know what I was thinking," John grumbled sheepishly.
Kitty frowned. Because while the words sounded more like the Sherlock she knew, the murderous intent was still in his eyes.
“Wait, since when were you there?” Anderson questioned in shock, looking over at Lestrade in shock.
“But, why did you keep her secret?” Kitty questioned.
“I thought Sherlock never replied,” Anderson commented.
"Does he have to look so smug?" Anderson asks, feeling slightly sympthetic at the Dective Inspector.
Before anyone could say anything further, whether that was to comfort John or to interrogate him about his feelings, the tv suddenly sprang to life. A fact to which John was thankful for, as he continued to struggle to put himself together after his minor breakdown.
"He simple just observed, anyone could see it," Mycroft explained in that uptight voice.
"Is that really a good quote to mention right now?" Mrs. Hudson questions, feeling like mentioning death right now was a big faux pas. But then again, it wasn't like Sherlock would care either way.
Everyone hissed, worry filling them at the sight of the pipe leaking. Even if they weren’t in a dangerous lab, a leaking pipe would be dangerous, but John was in a dangerous lab which made said leaking pipe even more dangerous.
The Yarders, Molly and John all laugh at Sherlock's joke. Meanwhile, Kitty wondered how she could get connections like that.
Everyone collectively breathed a sigh of relief, glad that it was just a normal dog and not an actual hound. Not that many of them doubted Sherlock, it was just hard to be sure with so much happening.
"I don't get it" Lestrade muttered. He, Anderson and Donovan were sitting in his office, every file for the cases Sherlock had helped with splayed out on the desk between them. "Why would he kill himself, it just isn't him."
“Why would Sherlock care about the counter on your blog?” Anderson questioned curiously, John shrugged in response.
"I never thought about it like that," Molly muses, silently retracting her last statement.
“You know, you’re taking this break up very calm,” Anderson commented in shock, and John shrugged not knowing what to say.
For sitting on the chairs, the two new people, are Moriarty and Kitty Riley. Moriarty was leaning back in his seat, wearing his usual smirk, masking the fact that he was confused with his air of madness. Kitty just looked terrified her eyes finding flickering between everyone, not knowing what to do.
"Yeah but, Sherlock doesn't get paid for helping the infrequent cases from the officers, and the small cases he does get paid for, I don't help with very much," John explains.
"What did you expect?" John asked curiously.
"Major Barrymore isn't going to like it if he finds you in his office," Donovan couldn't help but point out.
"I don't think that's quite what she meant Sherlock," Mrs Hudson muttered sadly.
"Sure you don't," John huffed.
John frowns slightly as he stares at his old friend. If he didn't know any better than he would think that Mike had a crush on Sherlock by the way he looked at him.
A few people flinch as Irene thrashes Sherlock, feeling sorry for the high functioning sociopath.
"I think he was going the other way, and look for books they both have and then go from their," John replied, trying to think which way would be faster.
"No," Lestrade answers.
“What does she mean?” Molly questioned curiously, a little, or a big edge filling her voice. No one answered, as only one person in the room knew with certainty what she meant, and John didn’t feel like talking.
"Yes, who are are you?" Mycroft asks, or more like demands. The shadow figure didn't move, or speak. Instead the words on the screen changed, much to everyone's surprise.
“It means duck out of the line of fire, it was used in the second World War,” John explains quietly.
Everyone snorts, and the few people who hadn’t realised that the phone was different, relaxed. Having been confused that Sherlock had actually just handed it over.
"That's because you haven't been listening," Mycroft said at the same time.
Everyone, besides for John who also remembered Henry, blinked in shock at the fact that his older self was in the same woods, seemingly without knowing how he got there.
The officers, Molly and Mrs Hudson all chuckle in amusement at John's annoyance to the cat.
“She did have people following us, she probably found out through them,” John explained, and Molly nodded, still a little freaked out for them.
"Why would he do that?" Anderson asked, "why not just stay there?"
"Give me back my book!"
"Sherlock does have a lot of weird experiments," Mrs Hudson says, remembering the thumbs in the fridge.
"Are you really still trying to maintain the facade?" Donovan questioned in confusion. "They obviously know you're lying,"
"Technically they are allowed in there as they have unrestricted access," Anderson argued softly.
Silence fills the room as the screen turns black. Though this time, no words appeared on the screen. Lestrade and Molly got up to get more food, while Donovan moved closer to Anderson and where the others were sitting. Curiously, Donovan glanced around curiously, wondering what everyone else was doing.
"How does Sherlock know him?" Anderson asks curiously, leaning forward.
Mrs Hudson squeezes Johns hand painfully tighter at that. Everyone close to John winces, fearing for their friend even though they knew he was going to be alright.
Mycroft sighed, instantly recognising the message.
“Why is no one questioning Sherlock’s text alert?” Kitty questioned curiously.
“He really was bad at apologies,” Mrs. Hudson mused quietly, frowning slightly at Sherlock.
"He set everything up remember," Donovan snorts.
"Why does everyone think we're dating!!" John shouted in annoyance.
"Please," Mycroft once again translated.
"He's talking about people climbing walls," Donovan snapped back.
"It wouldn't be Sherlock if he wasn't," Lestrade pointed out, John hums in agreement.
Everyone, bar Kitty and Moriarity glared at Irene typing on the screen. “Who is she texting?” Anderson questioned curiously. Though no one needed to answer as he caught sight of Moriarty smirking to himself.
"And definitely not the best way to find out," Mrs Hudson murmured, "but Sherlock never was good with tact," She added sadly, memories of Sherlock swirling around her mind.
“That poor man,” Mrs Hudson mused, feeling so sad for everything that Henry had been through and must be feeling.
--3rd P.O.V.--
"That was lucky, it could have been Sherlock who was shot," Lestrade commented, John paled slightly at the thought.
"Is it bad that I feel disappointed that Sherlock hasn't already guessed just from meeting Barrymore?" Molly questioned, feeling a little silly.
"Why does Sherlock do anything," Molly adds, though her words somehow answers Anderson's question as no one says anything else.
"Couldn't you guys use another hand?" Lestrade asks, ignoring Donovan, John hums slightly and shrugs but doesn't bother actually answering it.
"Why are you being shown a documentary?" Molly questioned in confusion, frowning at the screen.
Those who were on Team Sherlock, glared at the mere mention of Moriarty, because of course he is brought up.
Transcript: Arainedevere
A couple people chuckle slightly, shaking their head as John frowns, silently urging his past self to go looking for Sherlock. Even if it would do nothing.
“Is that supposed to be the hound?” Donovan questioned worriedly. No one obviously answered her, though everyone became even more worried.
"Obviously," Mycroft retorted, his voice sharp with arrogance.
"Thank you,"
"How many times does that happen to you?" Lestrade asks curiously.
"'Hey, you! Why don't you look where you're going?' Is what he said," Mycroft replied causing everyone to hum.
A few people chuckled in amusement, while the others sighed, already guessing what had happened.
"He actually sounds like a normal human," Donovan's voice is filled with shock as she speaks. Her words cause John's fingers to curl into a fist and it took everything to not punch her.
"What's he doing?" Anderson asks, leaning forward curiously. No one answers him, mostly because no one knew not even John or Mycroft. Or Mycroft could be just choosing to stay quiet, you never know with him.
“What did Sherlock offer you to help him?” Lestrade questions, not remembering anyone actually telling him about it.
"That was so cringy," Lestrade commented, almost teasingly.
Everyone but Mycroft winces at the fourth victim.
"What?!" Almost everyone shouted at once. Only John and Mycroft weren't confused by Sherlock's statement. Though neither bothered to inform the others, figuring it would show Sherlock quickly explaining.
Mrs Hudson huffed in annoyance when she noticed that no one was taking notice of the crying man. The others all flinching, wondering if they would notice someone crying in the middle of the street.
"I really wouldn't be surprised," Lestrade commented.
"And here I thought tourists like being blown up," Lestrade mutters sarcastically.
“Hopefully,” Lestrade agreed.
"Why do people keep thinking that
"So that's what the harpoon was for," Anderson murmured to himself. Not bothering to even think about asking how that helped solve his last case.
A few people jump as they spot something moving outside. Now everyone definitely felt like they were in a horror movie. A few mentally wishing that Harry would either run or look behind him.
"How can she be so oblivious to the raging person in front of her?" Anderson asks.
"Sherlock was not behind anything!" John argued almost instantly, defending his best friend.
Somehow everyone got even more worried when Major Barrymore appeared. Especially as he seemed furious.
"Why do we have to watch Sherlock's cases, he was behind them all so what's the point!" Donovan said, not letting the chance to belittle the so called 'freak' slip by.
would watch a tv show?" Anderson questions in shock.
Now everyone sighed at Sherlock.
Mycroft frowned as he stared at Irene. Never actually believing that she could have fallen for her brother.
"Sorry 'bout that," Lestrade says, nodding at the screen.
"Could it be? Could the great Sherlock Holmes be jealous?" Molly teases lightly, pushing away the sadness that her crush would probably never like her back, though she had accpected that fact a long time ago.
Mrs Hudson can't help but sigh Sherlock's name. Even though she wasn't surprised, she still hoped that the boy wouldn't be so causual around a muderer.
"Maybe this will finally show you that Sherlock is not a fraud!" John snapped at the sergeant.
"You mean like the one from Lord of The Rings?" Molly questions, that being the only Golem she knows of.
"Yep, that's defiantly Moriarty,"
“So much for Sherlock not following you everywhere,” Anderson manages to joke between his shock.
"Holy shit," Donovan breathed, almost everyone gaping at Henry's house.
Everyone with a sense of humor, besides for Lestrade who frowns and John who looks kind of embarrassed, laughs at the annoyed looks on both of their faces.
“They did,” John admitted with a soft huff.
A small smirk appeared on John’s lips at Sherlock leaving Irene behind, he knew that Sherlock did care for her, but it still felt nice to watch him leave her.
"The freaks probably just pretending all this time," Donovan whispers to Anderson. Said forenzic scientest flinched ever so slightly as the soft trickle of guilt started weeding its way into his stomach.
Everyone that didn't know about that night gasps in shock. Even Mycroft's eyes widen slightly.
"Repulsing," Kitty can't help but mutter under her breath, though no one hears her. Which is lucky, because if they did, they probably would have tried to kill her.
Transcript: Arainedevere
"Do you think that this is Mycroft?" Anderson asked, eyeing the screen warily.
"How did I not see that coming?" Donovan muttered quietly to herself. Still surprised despite the fact that Henry was depressed, sad, terrified and had a gun.
"If it wan't clear before, it is now, the dudes crazy," Anderson comments causing a few people to chuckle.
"You know, times like these just proves it. That Sherlock actually does have a heart," Lestrade jokes, John snorts, but none the less hums in agreement.
"But he did," Donovan pointed out. Trying to figure out what Sherlock could possibly gain from lying.
"Isn't that what Sherlock does though? Jump to conclusions?" Kitty questions, genuinely curious.
“Well, don’t we just know that the Doctor had taken Bluebell from her daughter's hutch, she could have just taken Bluebell back to the lab,” Molly pointed out.
Everyone glances at each other for a few minutes, no one really thinking of anything else.
"Yeah, thanks" Mycroft translated before anyone could ask.
"Is that actually the password?" Anderson questioned.
"Seriously though, how did you get my phone number?" John demands. Mycroft smiles but still doesn't answer.
"Hang on! Where did he get that ID?" Lestrade practically shouted, John smirked slightly, seeing this as payback.
"Is that you Mycroft?" Molly asks curiously and Mycroft hums in comfermation.
A few people frown, shock over Irene sending him the text, and the text itself.
"Moriarty"
"When did you have Moriarity in a holding cell?" Lestrade questioned in shock, turning to Mycroft with a frown.
“Who is she working for?” Molly questioned cautiously, though from the way this case was unfolding she figured she had a good idea.
"Why didn't you call?" Donovan questioned, remembering what Sherlock had said about Mycroft not texting if he could call.
"Fine," He muttered and together the three of them stepped into the back seats, Mrs Hudson in the middle as the girl got back into the front. But before the car could start; Mrs Hudson, John and Mycroft's vision turned white until it was the only thing they could see.
Those with a conscience, all sighed, feeling bad for Henry having to relive that night.
"And the lucks gone," Anderson added as John shrugged in answer to Lestrade.
"Why didn't you just go straight to the crime scene?" Molly asks curiously.
"Your insane,"
"Yes, yes you did," Anderson decided to answer, mostly just to annoy the present day John.
