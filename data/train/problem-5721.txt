Michael eyes him, "You say that now—"
Steve pulled back, his eyes warm, "I love you."
made Howard wince. "I hear I was a real bastard."
"What? No! You look gr-fine. It's casual. No sweat."
He was still just as handsome as the days when she had his poster on the wall above her bed, his smile just as dashingly cheeky.
Steve choked, fumbling as his laptop fell onto the ground, his face pinched.
"Wait a second." So, maybe Steve couldn't
"Well fuck." Clint groaned.
"Guess I did."
He shivered, his thoughts circling back to his conversation with Natasha and Clint and how they had plans to
Looking interested, Hill sat up straight. "Any progress on that?"
It took a few tries before he figured it out, but by tapping the white circle at the bottom, he could take a photo of himself
It was Steve who spoke at last, "Okay," he started, still a bit hesitant, "Okay. But if this doesn't work, you let the issue drop."
"Who's Bruce?"
"We ain't got the money, Stevie." She coughed again. It was getting worse.
Taking the ball from Dum-E's outstretched claw, Howard tossed it from one hand to the other before flinging it across the room. "Steve's okay with me now?"
Trailing behind is a nurse in a light pink scrubs and clogs. She holds a beige canvas bag and, when prompted, plucks out a tissue to pass over to the old man. He smiles his thanks and gently wipes spittle from the corner of the woman's mouth, his movements gentle and loving.
Bruce was afraid of that question because he honestly didn't know, "What do you think?"
"Should we get Howard out here as well?"
"Nat, just because the attention isn't solely on you for once…"
They were both wrong, but that didn't stop the guessing, and when Bruce returned during the opening credits of the next episode, he took one look at the two of them on the couch, pulled out his phone, and high tailed it out of there.
"Who's that? It sounds nice."
his best friend, who only ever wanted to pick up a dame, was hopelessly in love and dating a man.
This is turning out to be quite the slow burn, so I hope everyone is okay with that!
"I like the idea of butt plugs." He said on Saturday evening, finally finding Steve outside alone on the landing pad. The sun was setting and it was cold. Tony regretted not grabbing a jacket, but approached the figure typing away anyway.
He jolts.
"Come on, Tony, you gotta breathe!"
OH WAIT.
"Tony," Steve began again, stepping closer, "Hey, it's okay…"
of this."
"Good idea." Sliding backwards down Steve's legs, his lips leaving his at the last second, Tony's hands expertly undid Steve's belt buckle. He tapped Steve's side for him to lean up so Tony could slide his pants and underwear off at the same time. "Missed that too," he gestured to Steve's length, already hard and leaking with anticipation of Tony's touch. "Know what else I missed?" he asked, wrapping a hand around him.
"I don't know if that's much of a challenge, but I'll take your word for it." He paused. "That's a lot of food."
"Yeah, but I'm clean. I mean, if you don't mind. Are you? I want to feel you."
Tony felt the same way, his insecurity digging at the back of his mind that someone like him should ever have expected to be loved by someone like Steve. It had taken ten months of courtship and over a year of dating to quiet that voice. He was still constantly in awe of the man he had careened into completion with. He accepted a love without limitations, without obligation. Steve loved him -- despite his flaws or maybe because of them. It didn't matter.
He watched Tony and Rhodey, after months apart, pick up like they had never left the other's company. Their inside jokes and stories that meant everything to them and nothing to anybody else, how Tony could make one face and have Rhodey in stitches, or how Rhodey -- knowing when Tony needed it -- could open his arms and, with no explanation needed, wrap Tony up. He often teased them for their 'slumber parties' -- nights they would stay up until dawn watching bad 80's horror or action movies, melded together on the bed amongst candy wrappers, takeout, and discarded popcorn, giggling like twelve year olds.
"My nanny, she was with me from five to seven."
Together, they finished the refrain, "We hear he is a whiz of a wiz, if ever a wiz there was!" People around them were smiling, watching the two Avengers childishly dance down the sidewalk, "If ever, oh ever a wiz there was, the wizard of oz is one because, because, because, because, because,
"I'm surrounded by amateurs."
I can, what? Fix forty-three years of conditioning and be all hunky dory?"
He took Howard's hand and let him pull him to his feet. "Uh, thanks."
"Which is fine - and frankly good to hear - but you still need to take a seat." Bruce motioned to the empty chair again. "We still need to talk about your reaction and how you can fix this."
The English voice sounded bored. "Sir, surely you know that I prefer a challenge."
"I already told you, I love your belly!"
" She let her voice go annoyingly high as she imitated him, and when he grumbled in protest to the pitch, she bumped his shoulder, smiling sweetly at him. "It was kinda cute."
Tony didn't trust easily. Check one. If he was caught too unaware, he sometimes flinched away from an enthusiastic hand. Check two. He was seriously insecure. Check three. And tried to hide it behind an obnoxiously false bravado. Check four. He had a thirst to prove himself and a grave misrepresentation of his own worth outside of his intelligence and his looks. Check five and six.
The soldier had already hopped from the counter and was digging through the refrigerator, plucking items, judging them, and putting them back. "Beef, pork, or chicken?"
Bruce gave a soft laugh. "I don't suppose you slept last night?" He watched as Steve pulled the toy out, letting it vibrate along Tony's rim.
saving. And I
a genius, and partially because Tony had - in all his years -
Tony's voice was reserved when he answered, like he was testing the truth in Steve's words. "Okay."
She sent him an appraising glance and walked first into the living room, sitting in the middle of the couch. As a female CEO of such a large company, she had to learn little ways of commanding respect and drawing attention to herself as a leader and not someone to trifle with. This was one of the ways she did that.
"No, it's perfect."
The more Tony thought about it, the more he knew that he had to be the one to tell Howard. It was the only way to exert any control over the situation. If Howard was to find out - and it was only a matter of time - it was infinitely better if he was told rather than figure it out on his own.
"There's nothing to admit!"
Steve took the sketchbook from Nat and flipped it closed, "Tony is easy to draw. If you know what to look for," he responded quietly.
He turned the vibrator on, readying himself, and pressing it against his opening, bringing himself back into the present. Steve carrying him. Fuck, that was a whole fantasy.
"Yes. And for one, The Cold War is over, before you ask, and two, I
He kissed his thigh, "No, actually. But had to do a lot of research for the stories."
Tony hugs him back fiercely, something inside telling him that he wouldn't be seeing Yinsen again for a long time and that this moment is a gift to them both. A chance to say a proper goodbye. "Go," he says, his voice thick, "you deserve to be with them. You deserve Heaven."
"The currents could be off by miles," Coulson finishes, looking at once both excited and annoyed with the time they wasted searching the wrong areas.
"Oh baby. I want you. Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby. Yeah." Bruce dead-panned.
"Gross." And he hung up.
And he was loathe to admit a begrudging respect beginning to boil up inside him for the half-Sicilian.
This probably isn't what the prompt really meant, but I took it this way, lol sorry!
"Invigorating," Bruce replied dryly. "Not sure I'd like to be there again, but I will say that tonight was fun."
"The fuck, why?"
"Right." It seemed better to just agree with her. He liked living, after all, no matter where in time he was. "Where's Steve?"
like this. Maybe it was the fact that his mouth wasn't running. Or maybe it was because the stresses of his life smoothed out when he was sleeping. Whatever it was, when Tony slept, Bruce sometimes forgot that this was a middle-aged man with a whole lot of baggage. "He needs it," he said at last.
Steve guffawed, his face splitting into an enormous grin. "As if you ever get anything less than from me!"
to make their own business better. How the fuck you think a damn
"This is important, but-" She glanced at Clint and Hill, "-maybe we should give them a few more minutes. They're more -- I guess -- more solid when they're together. When they're not bickering like an old married couple at least." And they deserved a few moments of peace before the second shoe dropped.
"About what happened."
But somehow, the man who knew Tony the best tended to forget that little fact.
The ringing slowly fell away, and Steve felt his heartbeat skip and stutter as his lungs slowly remembered how to breathe.   It was so foolish that those eyes held such comfort for him, that even after all these years they could anchor him without fail.
And if the soldier overindulged once in a while after a particularly bad night or another clumsy fall that set off all the old injuries...  well. What difference did it really make? There was no level further down than rock bottom, and the soldier was already there. Nothing left to shoot for and miss. Nobody left to disappoint.  Nothing to leave behind when he finally faded into the darkness.
Steve realized he had been staring into space for an indeterminate amount of time. He dragged himself back to the moment with difficulty, his clouded mind dancing between the past and present; between what wasn’t real and what was right in front of him, calling him
Well... as long as they got the mess cleaned up in time for dinner. Otherwise, there would be a completely new argument to be had.
It was a fix he’d been craving shamelessly, and the heady rush that always followed it.
"Look, I don't know how to say this," Clint tried for brutal honesty, "or how to put it in a way that isn't going to ruffle your feathers or put you on the defense. You know I'm not much for words."
Tony defeated him easily, catching Steve's arm and slipping closer, into his space. Steve's hand came to rest on Tony's broad back, intent on pushing him away. He couldn't.
The soldier wavered, and he’d been so sure he could set his jaw and push through all of this, through the humiliation and self-loathing, but not
Turning away from the window and the hail that still barraged it angrily, Steve limped gracelessly into the small bathroom on the other side of the kitchen. His breath hitched when he caught sight of himself in the mirror, all mottled skin and bloody bandages. He looked like he'd been hit by a train... and felt it... though he supposed the truth was just slightly more startling. He was wearing Clint's clothes, he noticed. Guilt spiked again through his mind, leaving a splitting headache in it's wake.
"I'll go change," Steve suggested, but he was quickly overruled.
Not unexpectedly, Tony intercepted his fist before he could repeat the damaging gesture.
Howard fucking Stark standing in the living room!"
"Careful!" Bruce chastised lightly, "Or we lose our explosives genius." His smile was friendly, showing Clint he was just teasing.
Tony tilts his head in the direction of the elevator, signaling his workshop, "Had a breakthrough with Clint's arrows. You didn't answer my question."
Steve had snapped to Howard as soon as they were a safe distance away.
need you to speak for me."
"Can I go to my room? I'll sleep better in my bed." There's a pleading quality to Tony's voice, and Steve pauses in shifting him. He glances at Clint - who shrugs - then back to Tony.
"My facade is working for a government agency known as SHIELD, The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. Two of my charges are agents there, though I've been watching over them for their whole lives."
The dragon surged forward, his eyes on Steve, the yellow pupils dilated in agitation. "Steve!" Tony's voice filled his ears, panic evident in the shaking tone. "Steve!" The Iron Man armor swooshed overhead, turning on a dime to get between Steve and the dragon, 25 feet in the air.
"Right here," Clint says, tugging the packages from his coat pocket.
"The Starks are too close!" Thor called back, dismayed, "I'll kill them if I use Mjölnir!"
"Yeah," Steve said, patting Tony's stomach and causing the genius to wiggle and laugh.
"I'm fine!"
"Steve and Tony?" she asked, tentatively, unsure of how much she should insinuate. Rhodey had taken Tony out to lunch -- and out of everyone they knew -- he was the best at knocking sense into the stubborn genius.
"Nat and Clint!" Bruce shouted, as Steve was halfway to the door leading to the hallway.
Howard was just entering the living room when they joined the rest of the team. He looked shaken, but his face lit up when he saw Steve and Tony, his eyes zipping down to see their joined hands, a bright smile growing on his face.
Tony's lucidity doesn't last. Despite the solid two hours he got from napping on Steve, he's still gone days without a proper sleep. By the next morning, he's slipping back into his drained, disconnected state. Steve, freshly showered and in a shirt not nearly as soft as the one he was wearing the night before, shifts under Tony's weight, his hand coming up to cup Tony's head so he doesn't jostle him too much.
"Fuck." Tony gasped, and boy did he have a dirty mouth. But Steve was loving it, ready to draw more of those curses and those sounds from him. Tony rocked his hips against Steve's thigh, clinging to his shoulders and tilting his neck for Steve, who took the opportunity to suck down the outstretched skin and back up, picking a spot behind his right ear to lavish attention on.
"That was crude, even for you," Natasha laughed, entertained regardless of the maturity of the humor. Even if no one else appreciated Clint's mouth, she sure as hell did.
"-It keeps me alive," Tony spoke quietly, and Steve hadn't even noticed him come into the room. "Arms up," Tony said, lifting Howard's shirt off without unbuttoning it. He pulled off Howard's undershirt as well. "I'll get these cleaned for you," he said softly, tugging the clean shirt Steve had found over his head.
Tony is holding his breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop. But it doesn't. Steve braces his left arm in front of Tony and leans in further, kissing his forehead. "I lost her. I don't want to lose you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Tony.” A beat passes before Steve murmurs, his voice like a prayer, “I think I had to lose her to get to you."
The magazines in the office were the same, with a few new ones scattered about.
"Sorry for interrupting, Director, Agent Coulson," she looks at Tony, "Stark."
"Knocked his ass clear out, too. Honestly, it was beautiful."
Clint nodded and stood, "I'll get him. Thai?" he asked, moving to the door.
He told them everything. From the first fight with Rhodey there and how he kept speaking for Tony and deciding for him, to how Tony was adamant they tell Howard about their relationship, to him seeing Tony's shaking figure silhouetted by the light from the guest room, to taking Tony to Malibu. Somehow it all came out. Most of it was not necessary because Bruce had known a sizable portion, but it was filling in things for Thor, and by to some extent, Howard. He told them of his anger, of how he was still angry, and how Tony descended into a mental slump that was frightening to him.
"Don't start getting all philosophical on me
Holding up his hand to stop further conversation, Clint interrupted. "I'm making a plate for Bruce to bring to him. And going to lick my wounds. Be right back. Don't miss me too much."
Steve's overjoyed to hear that Tony wants to eat, but even more so that he wants to lay on him again. It's a little selfish, but as long as Tony is sleeping, he's not going to argue. Sitting back, he carefully tugs Tony against him, tucking his head under his chin.
This is me on my knees, begging for comments? Pretty please? They make me feel warm and fuzzy.
Steve tightened his hold on Tony but said nothing. He could talk about it with Tony later on, but he at least could let Rhodey have his word. No matter how wrong it was. Because no way in hell did Howard deserve even an ounce of pity. He didn't deserve redemption or a second chance or-
Tony snorted. "Nope."
"That's true. Steve can be a bit, ah, overprotective."
"Tony?" he asked, his voice quivering like the leaves on a branch during a storm. "What are you saying?"
It could backfire. This whole thing could blow up in their faces. But they had to take the chance.
"What?"
Howard formulates a plan, and Steve and Tony find themselves at odds over how to handle everything.
the time for a panic attack.
"Need me to get the door to his suite?"
Shadows shifting from down the hallway caught Howard's eyes, and he watched as Steve's broad form stalked out of Tony's room. It struck a fear into him that seized his muscles.
"Thank you, JARVIS," Nat placated the AI. She didn't care if she was on anyone's bad side most of the time, but an all-knowing artificial intelligence was where she drew the damn line.
"Uh-uh, c'mere," he grinned, tugging Tony into his arms. He came willingly, smiling up at Steve.
Tony just gave him a look as he pressed the side of the phone to turn it on. "You'll be the coolest kid in New York City for about a month until everyone has one."
wrong.
"We were just shopping! What are you doing here?"
Howard looked up and away, his face pensive. "And how's that?"
They all agreed.
"Holy shit."
Clint turned a fierce face to Natasha, "Really?"
"I get it."
"Vodka Tonic for
Natasha shook her head, her face worried. "Steve completely losing his cool, I think. Wasn't sure that was entirely possible."
Tony covered his face. "Jesus, Tash!" He plopped on the stool next to hers. "And does everyone know I like him?"
Howard had dropped his hands.
That startled a laugh out of Bruce just as the woman took the picture.
"Yes, and I won't go into all the sordid details, but I found out exactly how I raised Tony, and trust me-" leaning forward, Howard's voice took on a tone of insistence, "-I
The tears dry slowly as they walk, leaving his face feeling tacky and his eyes puffy. Tony’s awareness of Steve’s hand in his only grows, his skin tingling at each point of contact, and by the time they reach Tony’s bedroom, he feels like he’s about to combust. He heads straight for his bed, finally breaking contact with Steve, and flops onto it, air whooshing out of him and onto his pillow, heating his face. His eyes close gently and he feels like maybe he could pass out again and sleep for an entire day, and he rolls to his side, ready to do just that, when Steve’s voice calls to him.
The empty glass falls to the bed as Tony’s other hand joins the party of misery on his face. He groans, falls back into the pillows, prays that they’ll open up and swallow him whole and maybe somehow that will get him out of having to face Howard. The pillows don’t cooperate and Tony instead finds himself letting Steve drag him up out of the bed and into a pair of pants and a loose t-shirt. They don’t talk while Steve dresses him; they never do. It’s easier for both of them if they don’t, easier to pretend that this isn’t the fourth time in one week Tony’s woken up hungover and useless. Steve finally looks at him as his shirt goes over his head, expression soft and forgiving, and Tony hopes his eyes convey the gratitude he can’t bring himself to voice.
“I’ll pick you up in ten,” is all Ty says.
They’re a floor up from the lab when the tears start falling. They run in tracks down his face, over his nose and into his mouth, and Steve doesn’t say a word, but he does let his hand run softly down Tony’s arm, lets his fingers wind through Tony’s and gives them a gentle squeeze. Tony sniffs quietly, accepting the consolation even as the shame that he’s let his father’s words get to him starts to seep in, and brings his unheld hand up to wipe at his eyes. He should be better than this, stronger than this. But if he’s being honest with himself, it isn’t the first time Howard’s words have cut him to the bone and laid him bare for Steve to see, and it isn’t the first time Steve has witnessed his tears, his weakness, his childish sniffles and red face.
“Be careful. Please.”
“He’s wrong, you know.”
“Patience is a virtue, Captain."
Tony inhales sharply at the expression radiating from Steve. It is fierce, defensive, protective, and desperately, profoundly, sad.
Steve looks up from the table where he’s clasped his hands together to capture Tony’s gaze in an endless sea of deep blue and Tony is trapped, unable to move or speak or even blink.
The first time Steve saves Tony from his own reckless behavior is when he’s five. He’s in Howard’s lab, because Maria is out on business, and he’s under strict instructions to sit quietly and wait for daddy and Mr. Rogers to be done testing out new Captain America suit upgrades. But he’s five and he’s Tony, so it isn’t long before he’s bored and toddling around the lab on his chubby little legs, reaching for things on Howard’s desk that are shiny and distracting. Things like a blowtorch. He picks it up, his fat little fingers barely able to wrap around the handle and brings it close to his face, his bright brown eyes sparkling with curiosity. He’s reaching for the ‘on’ button that he’s seen his daddy press a few times, eager to watch the fire come out, to see how it works, and he’s almost got it -
And Tony believes him, trusts him. So he sleeps.
It’s nearing eight pm when Tony finally wakes up again to the sound of his stomach voicing loud complaints at having been empty for almost an entire day. He groans and rolls over, blinks sleep out of his eyes, catches sight of Steve asleep in his chair, and suddenly his growling stomach doesn’t matter so much. At least, not nearly as much as watching Steve sleeping does.
Tony vomits. His stomach muscles clench painfully around emptiness and his throat burns and his nose is filled with snot and his eyes are watering and...he’s going to die. He’s certain that this is going to be his end, he’s going to die like this, face in a bucket and bile in his mouth.
Tony smiles back, is about to make a quip about being a creature of the night, when his stomach gurgles painfully. Steve glances at it, his smile growing.
“That’s enough, Howard.” The words are low, powerful, rumbling up from Steve’s chest to expand across the room like quiet thunder. Tony tries to focus on them, to focus on Steve and the steel of his voice and strength of his chest, because it’s suddenly there, in front of him, blocking his view, and Tony’s hands are moving towards it of their own accord, seeking comfort, seeking heat. He’s too cold, shivering, his blood freezing, rushing through him like ice water even as his skin is on fire, burning brightly, so hot he feels like it could melt Steve’s hand. Steve’s hand, which is gripping his upper arm, tugging him off the stool, pulling him towards the door. And he should be more concerned, more embarrassed by the fact that Steve has had to save him again from Howard, but he can’t summon the emotion, can only think about his mother’s face, her disappointment, the sadness that will live in her eyes when Howard talks to her and tells her, and he didn’t think of that before. Should have thought of that before. Before he went out last night, before he got drunk, before he took the little purple pill Ty gave him, before he had to call Steve.
Tony finds his freedom from the sincerity in Steve’s eyes and the genuineness in his voice in the corner of a napkin. It folds and bends and shreds nicely in his hands as Steve’s words continue washing over him, through him, making him blush and blink against the sudden pain radiating from just behind his eyes.
“Breathe, Tony. Just breathe.” Steve’s voice is more gentle than it should be, solid and grounding. It’s more gentle than Tony deserves, but he does as he’s told. He doesn’t know how long he kneels there, sucking air in through his nose and out through his mouth, trying to get control of himself. Steve is a patient statue behind him, waiting until Tony is ready, before guiding him back to the bike. When they’re both settled on it Steve pulls Tony’s arms around his waist and turns his head to say, “Hold on and close your eyes this time.”
It isn’t the last time Steve saves Tony.
Tony’s foot pushes him to the left, twisting the stool. “Well, that’s your fault.”
He would die before he ever willingly admitted it outloud, but waking up before Steve and watching him sleep is one of his favorite things. It’s one of the only times he ever gets to simply to look at Steve, to let his eyes wander over him and map his face, his body, without fear of Steve or anyone else noticing. And, if he’s in the mood to be honest with himself, it’s always nice to wake up and see that Steve’s still there, still watching over him. It makes him feel….safe. Protected. Cared for. He wonders briefly if this is what it feels like to have a real parent before deciding that, no, it can’t be. Nothing he feels for Steve is even close to parental, even if Steve is old enough to be his dad, and even if that is how Steve feels about him.
They reach Howard’s lab sooner than Tony would like and as they approach the glass doors and he sees Howard tinkering away at something on the table, a small rush of anxiety runs through him. And suddenly his skin is electrified with the desperate desire to turn around, to walk away, to refuse to talk to him, to say “No, I don’t want to face this”, and without thinking he reaches out and grips Steve’s arm, hard, silently begging him to help, to not make him face this alone.
Tony smiles over his hands as Steve stretches, shaking out his tightened limbs, and yawns deeply. “Morning, sunshine.”
“Think you could pay a little less attention to your son, Howard?” Mr. Rogers doesn’t sound as nice anymore so Tony stops listening. He doesn’t hear his daddy’s response of “Seemed like you had it under control.” He doesn’t see Steve’s eyes narrow or hear his soft snort. He doesn’t know that Steve has just resolved to keep his eye on him.
He'll never admit it, but he loves the taste when he sucks Tony’s fingers into his mouth and it coats his tongue. He lets Tony believe he has a thing for his hands, rather than voice that he has an addiction to the taste of smoke on Tony’s skin.
He doesn’t get to wallow for long before their food arrives and he is diving into the greatest shake to ever grace his tongue. He devours it in its entirety before even looking at his burger and when he finally does pick it up, he chances a glance at Steve, only to find him snickering into his fries as he watches Tony. And just like that, the tension passes, fades into the taste of salt and meat and sickly sweet shakes, and the knot in Tony’s chest unwinds again. The rest of their meal passes in joking quips and smirks, light banter and rolled up straw wrapper being tossed around.
They never really talk about it, not in a normal way. It goes unmentioned, unspoken, unvoiced. But it’s always there, the underlying need, visible in the muscle that twitches in Steve’s jaw every time Tony flicks his lighter. He tries not to take advantage of it. He fails miserably.
Howard’s voice is dangerously low and soft when he says, “What am I supposed to tell your mother?” Tony stops spinning. “How do I tell her that her only son doesn’t give a god damn about anything but drugs and booze?” Tony’s ears are on fire now, too, and he knows his skin must be burning cherry red with humiliation and shame. “How do I explain that the baby she almost died for is growing up to be a useless, disgraceful, failure?” Something sharp twists in Tony’s stomach at the mention of his mother’s difficult pregnancy. It knots in his intestines, making him feel sick again, and he can’t see suddenly, everything is blurry, but he can feel, he can feel his nails digging into his palm, blunt and sharp and he wishes it was Howard’s face he was cutting into rather than his own skin. “You’re gonna cry now? Can’t even take a fucking lecture like a man -”
Steve whines when there’s no smell, no aftertaste, but fuck he'll swallow down the heady musk of Tony’s cock instead and it’s better, anyways
“Time?” He still sounds tired, ragged, if not raspy. He hears Steve sigh somewhere to his left.
“You’re unfailingly kind, Tony. You’ve inherited your mother’s penchant for watching people and picking up on what they’re feeling and reaching out to them when they need, offering yourself in whatever way you think will help. And you’re charming.” A small smile plays over his lips as he carries on and Tony feels like he can’t catch enough breath in his lungs, like his ribs are going to explode right out of him with how hard his heart is pounding to the beat of Steve’s voice echoing through him.
Tony nods, like he always does, and Steve’s hand falls away, leaving his cheek tingling. Tony watches Steve as enters the house, leaving him cold and alone in the garage. He picks up his phone and dials Ty’s number by heart.
His response brands new memories into Tony’s mind. It makes him smile a little each time. And Steve? Develops a pavlovian response to the sound of a lighter flicking. The little chink, flick. Chink. Flick.
He stops short, watching Steve’s face. His frown had been growing into a soft indulgent smile as Tony rambled but the mention of Howard had him looking down, a muscle ticking as his jaw clenched, and he finally looks back up through his lashes, and his eyes…
He squeezes his eyes shut again, throws his hand over his face, trying to block out the painful rays of sparkling sunlight.
“Sleep.” He says, his voice low and soothing. “I’ll watch over you.”
Tony gives himself a little shake. It’s nonsense, he knows that. The universe isn’t going to relay it’s divine code to him in the blinking tail lights of cars passing by a dinky little grease spoon in the middle of the night in the heart of Brooklyn, and it isn’t going to tell him what to do about the beautifully stoic man sitting across from him.
Steve drags him through the house and back out the front door. His hand doesn’t leave Tony’s arm until they reach his bike, and he only lets go so he can push Tony onto the seat. He doesn’t say a word as he mounts, kick starts it, and takes off, and Tony sighs. He’s due for a lecture any day now and he’s tired of waiting for it. He’s not a patient person and every day that goes by without a peep from Steve only gives him more time to imagine how bad it will be when Steve finally blows. The thought of it turns his stomach in knots and makes him feel sick, make him feel like he’s going to -
“How’s, uh….JARVIS? That’s what you’re calling it, right? How’s JARVIS coming along?”
It’s a common sight for Tony, waking up to Steve in the chair, usually either reading or sketching, but sometimes snoring softly. It’s never dawned on Tony to wonder why he’s always there, doesn’t occur to him to wonder now. Steve has his own wing in the house, his own rooms, his own space, but somehow still manages to always be wherever Tony is when Tony’s home, and always, always, stays while Tony sleeps. Tony doesn’t care about why, doesn’t want to care about why. He lets his eyes rove over Steve, drinking in his form unabashedly.
He sighs, blinks once, and lets the lights and their false promises wash away. He refocuses on Steve, who has been staring at him the entire time. He knows, can feel Steve’s eyes moving over him, watching him, assessing him. Tony chances a glance towards him and Steve’s eyes are searching, a little distant, but intent on Tony’s face. Tony isn’t sure what he’s looking for, but whatever he finds clearly isn’t what he wants to see, if the frown that grows on his pink mouth is anything to go by. A deep heavy sigh moves the muscular wall sitting across from him and This is it, Tony thinks. Steve is finally going to lecture him. He shrinks back into the creaking leather, wraps his arms around his middle in an effort to hold himself together as Steve leans forward and rest his hands on the table top, lacing his fingers together.
Howard’s hand slams down on his desk, making Tony jump. “God
It hurts. It hurts to think, to wonder, to imagine and want. It hurts to hear Steve say such beautiful things to him, such real things, such honest and earnest things. It opens up the secret space hidden behind his bones, cuts a path to his soft squishy heart beating a rapid rhythm. They can’t be true, the words that have wriggled into his mind, his heart, his entire body. They’re too beautiful, too full of possibility, too full of words that describe Tony in the wrong way. But he wants them, wants them to be real, and the longing for them, for Steve...it aches. So deep in his chest, it aches.
I'm sorry this took so long everyone, I've been dealing with a death in my family.
Steve feels guilty that he has such a thing for Tony’s smoking. He’s seen the research, he knows that smoking causes cancer. Logically, he knows he should discourage it. But the sight of Tony smoking, a cigarette dangling delicately between his fingers, smoke curling lightly away from him, and the smell that surrounds him, is a strange sort of aphrodisiac for him.
It’s Tony and Steve’s favorite place in the whole of New York.
He doesn’t, though. This time, for once, he keeps his mouth shut and lets his mind wander, lets his brain shut down and simply stares at the lights outside and begs the Universe to show him it’s hidden codes, to distract him, to let him not have to think because if he does...
It’s an emotion that he frequently ignores, evades, keeps locked up tight behind drinks and drugs. But it’s a knot of tangled emotion that, over the years, managed to lodge itself deep behind his sternum, somewhere in the region of his heart, and sometimes, usually when Tony’s feeling particularly emotional and his defenses are down, it pulses and tingles. It sends electricity sparking over Tony’s skin everywhere he touches Steve, heats him from the inside out, makes his heart race and his pulse echo in his ears.
He waits until he’s smoked the entire thing before even vaguely starts thinking about kissing Steve, who is nearing desperation. When he finally does it’s open mouthed, hot and hard and Tony’s tongue slides into him, passing the taste of smoke into Steve.
He forces his eyes down to the column of Steve’s neck before he can finish that line of thought. It never leads anywhere good, usually only ends in Tony chasing his desire to the bottom of a bottle. He focuses instead on the thick column of Steve’s neck, on the soft cream color of the skin there and the pulse he can see bounding lightly, and, oh….. how he longs to run his tongue over that pulse, to feel it spark and jump, to feel the muscle move and bunch as Steve swallows thickly when Tony finds the sweet spot where he can bite down and suck -
“Luke’s.”
Tony is out of bed and throwing on jeans before the word has fully left Steve’s mouth.
“You’re brilliant, Tony. Smart...smart doesn’t begin to cover your mind. The things you’ve created? DUM-E? U? Butterfingers? You brought him to life, Tony, you gave him a mind. There are so many awful things that brain of yours could be used for and you’re using it for good, to create beautiful and helpful things.”
“Howard’s waiting in the lab.”
Steve’s warm hand lands on his shoulder and he draws breath again into greedy burning lungs, swallows down rancid spit only to cough it back up immediately.
Howard’s sharp eyes take in Tony sitting on the stool, one foot pushing against the ground as he lazily spins back and forth, and Steve standing behind him, arms folded. He looks back down at his project, speaks to it rather than Steve as he says, “Steve, I’d like a word with my son. Alone.”
It is a promise, rushing through Tony, warming him from the inside, and it’s a warning, shivering across the room to Howard like a rush of cold wind. The door closes quietly behind him.
“Tony.” It’s a siren’s song, pulling at him, making him open his bleary, itchy eyes, and for a split second, he hates Steve for it. Hates that he’s so reliant on Steve’s words and his voice and his solid stability, the calming eye in the hurricane that is his life.
Tony shakes Steve’s shoulders hard, points to the side of the road, and Steve silently pulls over. Before the bike is even fully stopped Tony stumbles off, falling to his hands and knees as every drink he had that night makes a reappearance. He’s gasping and shaking, retching horribly as his stomach clenches, completely empty, his body heaving. His throat burns as he tries to cough up more, but there’s nothing left, and he thinks about passing out because he can’t breathe and his eyes are watering and he wishes it would all just stop.
Tony settles back onto the leather and rests his head in his hands, a small sigh whispering out between his lips. He stares out the window and lets his mind drift, mutely watches the cars going by, the red of the tail lights shining in bright patterns against the darkness, leaving spots behind his eyes. He imagines he can see codes in them, patterns, the answers to painful questions ringing unspoken in his head, the answers to the universe, even.
Steve doesn’t call him out on it, doesn’t say anything at all. He just lets the silence envelop them again, lets Tony look back out the window and watch the taillights going by. His quiet steadiness soothes Tony’s nerves again as they wait for their food, a solid reminder that he’s still there, waiting patiently for Tony to come back around and make a joke.
“Steve, Steve,” the brunette was repeating over and over like a mantra, his hands allowing no room for escape as he demanded eye contact.
The rules were simple.  Since he'd touched back down onto American soil, they had stood fast, and they were impossible to forget. Tony didn't get to be anywhere near him. Tony never had the chance to see him like this.
It was a long time—too long—before the soldier dared drag his eyes upward to gauge his lover's reaction to the sight of his battered body. He almost wished he hadn't. Tony's face was carefully blank, but the harsh line of his jaw and the dark, agonized shadow behind his eyes were all that was necessary to tell Steve how he felt.
The opposite door slammed; a key turned in the ignition. The car began to move. The siren lights flashing just outside the window were nauseating and spinning far too fast, so he shut them out behind heavy lids.
Eventually the phone would ring, or Jarvis would announce a visitor, or Tony would clear his throat. Anything, really, to break the moment.
"Steve." Clint was pulling on his jacket; the soldier could hear it. "I'm coming to get you. Are you safe?"
"You look like shit."
Tony rolled his eyes and waved a hand impatiently. "Beyond the usual."
He was on his feet, Tony seemed sober, and Clint had not yet come storming through the doors with a blade drawn despite his promise to refrain from doing just that. So far, so good.
The words made Steve’s heart flip painfully in his chest. He’d heard them on so many other mornings, what felt like a lifetime ago. Taken them for granted. He sometimes dreamed them now, knowing how foolish it was but unable to help himself.
"Pepper says I wear it to feel powerful." One red-armored shoulder shrugged with a mechanical sound. "Thought I would test the theory."
Steve tipped a nearly-empty bottle of Percocet onto the counter, hesitating before sliding most of the pills back into the bottle and stashing it back in the cupboard. He swallowed two tablets dry, punishing himself with the sour taste of powder on his tongue.
That night, as they lay in bed, Tony watched Steve as the soldier's eyes moved rapidly behind his lids, sweat beading on his forehead as a nightmare dug it's talons into his mind.
Tired eyes, drooping bags beneath them. Sad smiles. His mother was dead.
The soldier carefully shifted upright, wedging his bare feet into the narrow clear space on the floor that served as a walkway from the bed straight forward to the kitchen. Standing was another matter, and the first time he tried he found himself falling gracelessly back to the mattress, breathing heavily and biting his lip to keep from crying out. It hadn't felt this bad when he was immobile, but he supposed he'd deserved that.
Steve lay half-awake and floating, his face buried in Tony’s chest.
Steve tried to jerk back; the assassin caught him before he could lose his balance completely.
Steve’s breath hitched dangerously, but he couldn’t interrupt.
“I’m right here kid,” a fuzzy voice was echoing from far away. “Do you hear me?  I’m right here. I’m not going anywhere.”
For the first time, Steve heard regret in Tony’s voice.  Guilt, pain, self-loathing. Emotions too easy for him to recognize because there were his own. The billionaire had managed to stay so strong up until this moment, and hearing the break in his voice was almost too much for Steve.
"Finally," Tony grumbled, tightening his steel grip on the soldier's hand. Showing unusual tact, he said nothing more. Instead he reached out gently to smooth the stray strands of blond hair from Steve's sweaty forehead, breathing out his tension and stress I a long, heavy whoosh of air.
Clint was at his side in an instant, supporting him when the soldier's sudden movements and burst of adrenaline sent the room spinning.
At all times, above all else, the soldier tried to avoid the memories of the field hospital where he'd floated in limbo for months, swimming through the stifling misery and pain, losing pieces of his identity with every day that passed unmarked.  A childish defense mechanism designed to keep him from the teetering edge of insanity, his brain shied away from that time; it shunted those thoughts away into the deepest recesses of forgotten memory.
Bruce was waving him off dismissively again, smiling. "No, no, Tony, relax. I just wanted to see how you and Steve were doing."
“I abandoned you,” the words came out like a confession, harsh and rushed and rambling without direction. For someone who saw so much, Tony still didn’t see what a monster Steve was and he had to show him, had to
Looking back, it had to end somewhere.  Tony had always joked that he’d put a ring on the soldier’s finger if he’d let him. Steve tasted copper in his mouth and followed the call of war back to another continent every time.
"No," the soldier swallowed, "I got in a wreck."
He would see, was all that Steve could consciously think. He would see everything.
He thought of being happy and forgetting what that felt like completely.
In spite of all that , he knew he was lying to himself the first time he consciously lied to his doctor... when he told him he was taking the recommended dosage at the recommended times and managing his pain adequately, and no, not drinking at all. It was a downhill slide from there.
Clint lived on the second floor of a small, extremely old apartment complex that was probably violating a dozen different health and safety codes simply by existing. The sounds of the city roaring by and the dreary rain reminded Steve of the apartment in which S.H.I.E.L.D had put him up before he'd joined the Avengers. Minus all the stuff. He'd never had the heart to collect much. Even now, living with Tony, most of his personal belongings could fit into an army duffel.
"Yeah." The effort to speak was exhausting. "I'm fine, just... could use a place to crash tonight..."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tellingly, his crutches were laid across the foot of his bed, and from across the room he could see that his bedroom door wasn't locked.  A tall, clean glass of water replaced the room-temperature beer that had been sitting on the nightstand, and a small bottle of advil he knew he'd never purchased was next to it.  The covers next to him were wrinkled and out of place.
"You can be killed."
"The hell did you go wrong, Steve..." he asked himself, and predictably received no answer in the stillness.
The soldier tried to resist. He really did. But if that hadn’t worked for him years ago, when he was young and strong and ready to conquer the world... it sure as hell wouldn’t now.
So when Tony sounded scared... well, it never boded well. For anyone.
Steve winced. "I don't think that's going to be a good idea. Ever."
Tony smiled and pulled him in closer.
"Shh, sh..." Tony was murmuring nonsensically somewhere just outside his fading range of hearing, both hands now clasping the soldier's face, forehead pressed to forehead. "It's okay. Alright? Just... hush."
Glass exploded against his back, and he turned around, wide-eyed, to find Tony standing right where Steve left him. Minus his drink.
“Thanks for coming,” he finally said.
“Oh, I think probably 85 years.”
And then he saw it. Right after a dark image of Vision, illuminated only by the glow of his stone, was himself rendered in a scratchy sketch and carrying an armful of supplies to the compound’s kitchen table. A tomato teetered on the edge of a container of roast beef and it seemed like so long ago that he’d shifted his balance just in time to keep it from falling to the floor.
“R&R,” Steve said. “Wanda took Vision to Sokovia for some sort of cultural celebration-”
Someone had left Steve’s sketchbook on the bedside table and he pulled it closer, opening it to the middle. One page was just a close up of Wanda’s hands. The details were there, right down to her chipped nail polish and array of rings, but it was the motion of her hands that Steve had somehow managed to capture on paper that caught his eye, her fingers caught mid-twirl as power flowed between them. The next page showed Natasha and Rhodey laughing, probably during a lull in a training session. The sharp, heavy lines of the War Machine suit stood in stark contrast to the soft wave of her hair and Tony once again found himself stunned as he flipped through pages and pages of Avengers frozen but still vividly alive in grayscale. Forget the superhero business, Steve could make a mint on coffee table art books.
“What?”
“Not yet.”
“You could sound a little more impressed there, big guy.”
“Mr. Stark?!” the doctor said. “We were just coming to see you. You shouldn’t be out of bed!”
“About time. Did you have to build it for Christ’s sake?”
There was no response. With his other hand, Tony reached out and tapped a finger against Steve’s forehead.
“I love you, Tony.”
“I have no idea. But that’s where they are. Sam’s visiting his mother, Nat’s with the Bartons and Rhodes-”
“I know that one. He’s off scaring the bejezus out of some new Air Force recruits. What about you? No rest for the star-spangled?”
“Hit me.”
“Any change?”
“It hasn’t been good, Tone,” he said. “I don’t know how you stayed so warm, which is a weird thing to say given how cold you were, but he was nearly frozen solid again. But something’s different. Maybe the serum wasn’t ever meant to be frozen once, let alone twice…”
“Oh, no no,” Steve’s eyes went wide as he spoke. “That’s not what I meant. It’s good to see you, Tony. It’s…it’s always good to see you. I just meant it was nice to not have to be ‘on’ all the time, you know? I don’t have to The Captain, I can just be…”
“Noted,” Tony said as he took his own bite. He couldn’t help but notice how uncharacteristically quiet it was at the compound’s residential wing. “Speaking of, where is your team?”
>>FRIDAY: No.
>>FRIDAY: I’m sure someone will. And this suit emits a low frequency signal that can be detected at closer ranges.
“Okay, well, a fly wouldn’t have felt that. Come on Rogers, put some muscle into it.”
He nodded, and Pepper was out the door and probably halfway to her car before her words landed in his brain. And people called him the genius.
“I’m gonna really need you to wake up,” he whispered. “Because, see, I kinda sorta think I might love you, and I really want to talk about it. So, what do you say?”
“What’s that?”
“What?”
“I do.”
“Yeah, you can touch it.”
Steve grinned as Tony brought his hand to his lips, pressing a gentle kiss to fingers that were still a touch too cold.
“Somewhere around nanotech.”
She nodded and ran a finger around the curve of her ear. Her makeup was fresh and her hair redone. She even smelled faintly of orchid because — as she’d once explained — even if the people on the other end of a video conference couldn’t smell her, she could and it helped keep her in the right frame of mind.
“He saved my life, Rhodey. He saved my life, and I want. To see. Him. He shouldn’t … He shouldn’t wake up alone. Now you can help me, or you can get out of my way.” Tony made it to his feet this time, but it was a wobbly ordeal and though he wouldn’t admit it, he was kind of grateful for Rhodey’s arm squeezing a bicep and holding him upright.
“I don’t know what to think about anything right now,” he said before steering the conversation to safer waters. “How’s business?”
FRIDAY ran several calculations before speaking next.
Wow, she really did know him.
They ate the rest of their meal in silence, and Tony couldn’t quite shake the feeling that they were both stealing glances, always just missing each other by milliseconds.
“Yep.”
“Honestly, I was just enjoying the quiet.”
“I’ve got logs that say otherwise. How’s Steve?”
Yeah. He had a vague memory of waking in a panic that he couldn’t quite explain. But Rhodey and Wilson were there, and when he’d calmed down they’d filled in the blanks as best they could. Honestly, Tony barely remembered what they’d said, but he supposed the whos hows and whys didn’t really matter at this point. A disgruntled underling. A fake alarm. Sabotage. A crash.
>>FRIDAY: Everything okay, Captain?
“Doesn’t mean I wasn’t waiting for you.”
Of course, what wasn’t said was whether anyone would find them in time. But it must have been enough to ease Steve’s mind, because for a while he was silent. FRIDAY worked in the background, monitoring their conditions, coaxing the nanites into new positions for better heat dispersal and trying to amplify the suit’s signal.
“Uh, that would be me,” Tony said as he brought his other hand to Steve’s, carefully rubbing his fingers between his palms. Steve frowned at him.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean-” Steve stopped mid sentence and furrowed his brow at Tony, running his fingers across the fabric at his wrist. “You changed?”
>>>RESOLVE: ISOLATE DAMAGED PARTICLES
“Fine, fine,” he said. “You go back to your little drawing, maybe take a nap, and I’ll rouse you at the next milestone.”
Tony watched Steve’s video again. And again, and again, And when he couldn’t do it anymore he turned his attention back to the laptop and tried to occupy himself with figuring out why and how the nanites had failed. Was it the temperature? The composition? The programming? The answer had to be there, but his thoughts were like mud and soon he pushed the laptop away and grabbed the watch. Maybe he’d focus on the wearables for a little while. A glasses display. A more portable gauntlet. After all, he’d already put FRIDAY into a toaster and a wristwatch. Surely he could expand on that and leave the nanosuit for another crisis.
“OK,” Rhodey said. “We’ll see what we can find, and in the meantime, you have a visitor.” He stepped to the door and opened it wide. She was on the other side, red-eyed and dressed in a blue business suit that didn’t match the haphazard tie back of her hair.
Tony grinned as he pulled Steve to his feet. It had been years since he donned the black form-fitting getup and felt all the plates of the Mark 3 slide and screw into place. Back then he just hadn’t wanted to get his clothes caught in the metal on its virgin flight to right some wrongs, but this time the fewer barriers between the suit and him the better. But not even he was up for some naked time in a prototype suit.
“Okay, okay,” Rhodey said. “Just sit back down for a second.” Rhodey gave the gentlest of nudges and Tony found himself back in bed. “Sit tight, and I’ll have Sam rustle up a wheelchair-”
“Yeah, this one’s a little different,” he said as he led Steve to the center of the lab. Steve frowned.
“Oh.” Steve’s gaze traveled down to their hands, still joined like it was the most natural thing in the world. “And you…” Steve’s voice caught in his throat like something far more terrifying than ice had frozen his tongue.
>>SCANNING
“It’s so smooth…”
“Did you think I wouldn’t?”
“Kitchen!” Steve’s voice called from the distance. It wasn’t a long walk, but with every step Tony’s mood lifted. “Hey,” Steve said with a smile as he entered. “I was just making a sandwich. Want one?”
>>FRIDAY: If history is an indicator, Boss will call you an idiot and be angry for several weeks before unrestrained guilt sets in.
Steve just stared at him.
Tony breathed a sigh of relief as Steve looked back up at him.
>>FRIDAY: None yet.
“Hi, Tony.”
“Working on a project back home,” he said, cutting into a tomato and assembling his masterpiece. “It’s kind of kicking everyone’s ass, and the guy running it…well, he’s a little cuckoo, even for me. Thought I could use a break and remembered I was working on a new suit here. Figured I’d get back on that for a bit. Nothing like a little project hopping to clear the head.” Tony brought a knife down through the sandwich, and deposited one half onto a plate before sliding it to Steve. “There you go, big guy. Stick that in your piehole.”
>>CAP: Okay. Okay, listen FRI,I know you just moved that light to me, but give Tony everything he needs f…for as long as you can and put anything extra into boosting the signal. I can’t…
“It just looks like shoes.”
But Steve was still again, lost in a dreamscape that at least didn’t seem horrible, if his peaceful, relaxed expression was anything to go by. There was a part of him that wanted to let him sleep. Lord knew he’d earned it. But the other part of him just wanted to see his eyes and his smile. It wanted to talk with him and laugh with him and fight about everything and nothing all the while knowing that it was only because deep down they both just loved the fight as much as anything else. It wanted more than he could have possibly imagined.
No one would tell him much about Steve. Just that he was alive, and they were warming him back up, but it was a little more complicated than SHIELD’s notes implied. That left FRIDAY’s logs as his real source of information. He studied the data points until it painted a picture of Steve dressing him, leaning back against the flat side of the rock because there wasn’t room to stand and pulling Tony close. For a while, he coordinated with FRIDAY.
“Let me guess: Bologna, Wonder bread and mustard? Hard pass, Cap.”
HEY BOSS
Nothing.
Her eyes glistened as she shook her head, a near silent “No,” on her lips as she walked back to him, bent down to wrap an arm around his body and kissed the top of his head. “But it wasn’t for lack of trying.” Tony laid a hand over her arm, and they just sat there, holding each other for a moment, a tiny salute to the things they’d been to each other over the years. And then she coughed, pulled away and straightened up.
“YES - wait, FRIDAY, we can adjust for that right?”
Rhodes pursed his lips together and nodded his head before pulling a chair over and sitting down.
“What? You need some proof or something?” Tony swallowed and took a breath that shook just a little as he leaned closer and pressed his lips to Steve’s. “Please wake up. Because I love you, and I need you to know it.”
“FRIDAY, dim the lights,” Tony whispered. He thought about waking Steve when a pile of particulate fashioned itself into a tiny stabilizer, and again when the suit reformed and held its shape absent the containment field. But he just looked so peaceful that Tony thought it better to let him rest. He probably needed it after all. It wasn’t until he’d changed out of his clothes and into a thin flight suit that he laid a hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve breathed in sharply before turning to Tony.
>>CAP: FRIDAY, what’s our comms status?
“Can I get you anything?” Pepper asked as Tony ran a hand across his face. God, she knew all his tells.
The previous drawing looked like it had been dashed off in an attempt to get it on the page before the details slid from memory. There was a hurriedness to it that was absent in the not-quite-three-quarter profile he stared at now. The lines were clean and smooth as Tony’s lower lip tucked between his teeth and the corners of his mouth raised up in a half smile. His eyes were turned down, focused on an unseen pile of nanotech that had managed to hold an actual shape all on its own. The work was no less technically perfect than the others had been, in fact it was even more simple in its composition, but there was something else about it. Something extra. Like a different kind of care was taken with each pass of the pencil.
>>CONVERSATION PROTOCOL ACTIVATED
“Well, that’s impractical.”
But when had he believed in fate? Tony tapped the button and watched the black screen fade up on an image of Steve sitting with his back against the rock wall. He hadn’t expected to see himself. And yet, there he was, leaning against Steve’s chest, eyes closed with the top half of Steve’s uniform backward, stretched out and covering them like a blanket.
“Want to keep this between us for a little bit?”
Tony glanced toward the door. He strained his ears for the unlikely signs of anyone alerted by a twitchy finger. Satisfied that no one was coming, he got his weight beneath him and stood a little taller, leaning purposefully close to Steve’s ear.
>>BIOSCAN:BOSS
He slipped the watch on his wrist and tugged it tight before tapping the face twice.
“Your call go okay?”
>>CAP: No, I mean like a video or a … a pod…something?
>>FRIDAY: I have logs of this entire incident.
>>CAP: ‘Cept it feels a little different this time. I don’t remember a lot, but I think it’s different, anyway.
Someone hacked the jet. Seeing it there in black and white did something to his memory, and he could feel the vibration in his arms as he tried to regain control. He could hear the clicks as Steve sat in the co-pilot’s chair, flipping switches to force a system reset.
“Can I…”
“Just remember who said it first.”
“I didn’t invite you here this time,” Steve said around another mouthful. “But you know you never need an invitation. You’re always welcome. This place was yours long before it was ours.”
“You know what? I do work better when I have an audience to wow.”
“You don’t mind?” he finally asked.
“Hey, big guy. You awake in there?” Tap tap tap. “Come on, Cap. Time to get up.” Tap tap-
RECOVERING
. That is amazing.” Steve stepped forward and raised a hand, stopping himself before he got to close.
They hadn’t made it far before a doctor trailed by what looked like a team of medical students rounded a corner.
“How long have you been waiting to do that?”
“Sorry to interrupt.”
“That was beautiful,” Steve said. “I mean, uh,
“Oh, you’re very funny,” Rhodey said as he maneuvered through the room and helped Tony into the chair and rolled him to the door.”
“Better now, thanks to you.”
“I could really use some coffee.”
didn’t spark some hot hospital bed makeup sex, there’s probably no hope, anyway,” he said with a cheeky grin that always made her laugh and this was no exception. It was only when her giggles died down and her face returned to something somber that he spoke again. “We don’t work, do we?”
But nothing worked, and he remembered heading to the manual shutoff, pulling a panel and getting hit with an electrical blast that sent him reeling into the opposite wall and interrupted the suit enough to keep it from absorbing the blow that left him seeing stars and then barely anything.
>>FRIDAY: How are you feeling?
One corner of Steve’s mouth ticked up as he raised his eyebrows and re-twisted the tie on his bread. Tony could feel his eyes on him while he rummaged through the cupboards and fridge returning to the counter with a bounty of goods.
>>VOCAL ANALYSIS ‘CAP’ CONFIRMED.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said. There was something slow and soft about his voice. Like finding the words he wanted was a struggle and getting the air to say them even moreso. “I guess…I guess if you’re watching this, things didn’t go so well. For me, at least. I hope they went well for you. I need you to know that that’s all I want — more than anything — is for you to get out of this.” Steve winced. His eyes squeezed shut with a grimace he couldn’t contain. God, he was in pain and it broke Tony’s heart. Steve’s face relaxed and he opened his mouth wide, moving his jaw back and forth before speaking again.
He’d take any small victory at this point.  Anything to give himself the illusion that he was still in control of any small part of his life.
“Steve,” Tony’s voice was firm, a hard edge there the soldier had never heard before.  “I’m going to say this once, and I’m going to make it crystal clear. I’m sorry I never made you understand this while we were together, but I thought what we had... I thought it was what you needed. I was a coward, alright?  I was a goddamn coward.”
Steve wanted to say no, wanted to power through this until he could get back on his feet and back to Tony, who was doubtless a wrecked mess by now... whether he realized what had happened or not. But Clint had helped him, had come to pull him out of his own mess when he was too weak to help himself... had probably saved his life. He owed him more than excuses and deflections.
“Do you need me to get up,” Tony whispered into the space between them, and he was still breathless.
The soldier grinned, looking down and leaning heavily on his borrowed walking stick.
Through blurring vision, Steve watched the doctor hand over two small bottles of... something, before sliding into his jacket and swinging a suitcase-sized bag over his shoulder.
"You know what..." Tony stroked his chin thoughtfully, his fingers quickly returning to the keys, "parking garage, too."
"Americans are tacky."
Thank you to everyone who took the time to read and especially those who left feedback.  I'll be replying to reviews over the next few days, just know I appreciate you more than I can describe.
He reached to put the box back on the shelf and paused, waging an inner battle of sentimentality.
"G'night, Buck." The captain mumbled downwards, his voice caught up in the tugging wind. He zipped up his jacket and turned away.
“Why?”
What are you going to do when you touch it? Clint had wanted to know. The light. Don't get burned, Steve.
And then there was pain.
Several harsh breaths later he was able to convince his body to stay alert, and he reached a trembling hand down to his side, the place from which the pain seemed to be radiating. A three-inch shard of metal was protruding through his side, jutting up angrily towards the tower above like an accusing finger.
Tony didn't bother scolding Steve for his misplaced apology, another sure sign that the billionaire was now in full emotional lock-down. Instead he slipped around behind the soldier and smoothly slid the jacket from his arms, not blinking as the rain-bogged garment left a dripping trail of dirty water on his plush carpet.
"Yeah," he tried to say, but it came out as a cough again.
Because it didn't matter which angle he looked at it from: it hurt. That Tony was so willing to throw himself after anything with two legs while Steve was not allowed a conversation with a teammate burned deeper than any slight before. When he thought about it, what hurt the most was that he had almost been ready to accept the possibility of this beautiful trainwreck. He'd been ready to accept that this was all they would have, and that it would never make either of them completely happy, but that neither of them could be happy without it.
"And what is that supposed to mean?"
"Tony," Steve had to stop him, his voice shaking.
It would be a lie to say that he wasn't worried. He'd never seen Tony like this and worse, he had no idea what was running through his boyfriend's mind. Tony was cryptic and complex at the best of times, and now he was a vault, his expression unreadable and his sentences carefully clipped.
Jamming his crutches securely under his arms, he pulled himself slowly down the short hallway into the open air: the kitchen on his left, living room on his right. His apartment had never felt so small.
Tony laughed, and there were few sounds that got under the soldier's skin quicker. Because Tony was laughing at him; Tony thought he was stupid or naïve or idealistic or one of the hundred other condescending things the billionaire saw in his lover.
Next Tony went back for the matching glasses of orange juice—Steve hadn’t touched his, too preoccupied with the coffee made with aching familiarity—and that obviously hadn’t escaped the other man’s notice. Tony held the glass out in front of him and waited for Steve to take it. Only then did he join the soldier on the couch.  They were close enough that Steve could feel his body heat, could lean into him and touch him if he’d only had the guts.
"I—" Steve rasped, but if he was honest he had no idea what he'd been doing or looking for. "Needed to stretch," he finished dumbly.
I hope to have Part Three to you guys soon, fingers crossed.
The super-soldier ducked, and the glass exploded against the television behind him. Pepper was going to be... unhappy about that.
The silence must have gone on too long.
A special thank you marie72, puskababy, ExsistentialCrisis713, and hiraethia for taking the time to comment.  I hope Part Two doesn't disappoint, and maybe I'm out here trading bits of my soul for validation from strangers on the internet but it still means a lot to me.  Like any author I crave that feedback from my readers so it's a special little high to get that review notification in my inbox.
Steve frowned at the ceiling, trying to convince his lethargic brain to calculate the current time from that information.
"You didn't have to come," Steve retorted in anger before he really thought about it.
Knowing that Tony had waited too, waited for him a few hundred miles away through all of that... that he'd been so close.  Been hurting. It was too much.
"I deserve to be," Tony finished for him, his voice harsh. It held everything the soldier had dreaded hearing: Tony hadn't even seen the worst of the damage, and he already hated himself.
Clint was convinced that Tony was unhealthy for Steve. He'd never said it outright—not until today—but it was in the little comments; in all the things he didn't say. It was in the way he looked at Tony, sometimes, after something he said to the soldier. It was in the averted glances and clenched jaws, the tensed shoulders and furrowed brows.
His old motorcycle was a 1938 Harley Knucklehead 1000, and he'd spent nearly a year and about as much of his earnings hunting it down. The paint was faded and the chrome was dull, but it was one of the few things he'd ever found that seemed to bridge the yawning gap between where he was now and where he'd come from. As much as Tony hated the "outdated death-trap", it had it's own spot in the underground parking garage marked by a simple, painted, white star. Tony had ensured him that this was, in fact, hilarious, and when Steve deigned to grace them with his presence in the 21st century and an up-to-date vehicle, then he could have his full name on it. Steve didn't understand the necessity for having his name on a concrete space, so he kept his old bike and Tony kept up his griping.
Steve clenched his jaw hard.
Tony wasn't an idiot. He knew Steve wanted more out of this; out of them. But Steve had always been a little (a lot) old-fashioned and who were they kidding? They were two extraordinary men in an ordinary, extremely hostile world, and if they could give each other a little comfort in darkened moments and passionate nights, then no-one had to be the wiser. But anything more complex? It was out of their league. It was dangerous and controversial and compromising and it just didn't fit.
Plying all of his considerable strength, Steve struck a heavy downward blow to Tony's arms, and it damn well nearly ripped the super-soldier's skull off but at least it broke the iron hold. He staggered back, grateful for the air, and Tony looked at him oddly.
Steve didn't know what to do. And so, he did nothing.
Bodies of the dead. The report of artillery. Fighters overhead, bombs were falling.
He was beautiful.
"You look like shit."
It hit him in full clarity, then. He had no idea what he was doing and no way in hell was he prepared for this.
"It's okay. He can handle it."
Stoically avoiding his own reflection, the soldier wiped a tired hand across tired eyes.
"I'm okay," he slurred unconvincingly, earning a half-relieved, half-disgusted snort from the dark pair of worried eyes hovering overhead.
Steve sobbed dryly with relief, sinking into arms he had dreamed of and yearned for through every miserable night for as long as he could remember. He threaded his arms under Tony's, grasping his shoulders with shaking fingers that were no longer as strong as they had once been, holding on for dear life. He pressed his face hard into the too-soft fabric of Tony's t-shirt and breathed it in. That scent of engine oil and expensive cologne caressed his senses, catapulting him straight back through the years to a time when he had fallen asleep in that smell every night.
After that, Steve and Clint had simply coexisted in a peaceful way. It might even be called actively positive, some days. They worked together like a well-oiled machine, needing little action and fewer words to communicate. Their relationship had always been comfortable and effortless, easy, and in a world full of Tony, that was a welcome port in the storm.
Bruce waved mildly as he stepped into the elevator, leaving Tony where he was sitting, rubbing his jaw. The doors closed between them with a soft chime, and the billionaire was left sitting on his ass and trying to figure out what the hell had just happened.
The heating coils and thermal blankets had been removed. He was breathing on his own, and his heart rate was strong and steady. The only sign that anything had been wrong was an IV dripping warm saline into his veins. He just needed to wake up. The medical team had pored over the SHIELD notes from the first thawing. Tony’d caught a glimpse in FRIDAY’s logs, but it was all just a little too much biology for him, and for not the first time, he’d found himself wishing Bruce were still around.
Tony let out an involuntary gasp as the nanobytes began slithering up his legs. Around his torso. Across his shoulders and down his arms. It was like being tangled in ropes and submerged in water, and if he hadn’t lived the life he’d had, it might have just been a curious sensation, but as it began to travel up his neck, he could feel a tinge of panic in his chest. He focused on Steve’s eyes, got lost in the blue and felt a moment’s calm before the mask covered his face, shrouding everything in darkness. Tony swallowed and breathed through his nose.
For the next several screens of information, Tony watched FRIDAY’s morality protocols war with each other as his condition held stable and Steve’s declined. Technically, Steve hadn’t revoked the discretion protocol — probably didn’t even know he’d activated it when he told her to take over as they fell from the jet. She could make any decision available to her, and there was the rub. Protect Boss, warred with Protect Life warred with Respect Life plus a dash of concern for Boss’s Mental Health, and a slow failing of the suit’s power for good measure left all her scales teetering until she reached a decision.
And that was how the team found them. Vision and Wanda first, then Rhodey and Wilson flying in and finally Nat and Clint, landing in a backup jet, hot and ready to whisk them away. There weren’t even very many entries left in FRIDAY’s logs. Of course, that was because the nanotech had reached critical mass and the last decision FRIDAY made before going offline was to direct all the power she could into one strong signal burst before leaving them to whatever ambient heat remained and a prayer.
Tony sucked at waiting.
FRIDAY was able to slow their descent, maneuver them away from the falling debris of the jet splashing into icy water and get them to snowpack.
>>CALCULATING … AI DISCRETION STATUS: ONGOING … SUNNY DAY PROTOCOL INITIATED
Steve’s smile was all he needed as the door opened.
“Invite me here more often and I’ll make all kinds of things to expand your culinary horizons.”
Fingers curled around his, and all Tony’s breath left in a huff as he moved back just enough to watch Steve’s brow crinkle before he drew a deep breath and his eyes eased open.
“I’m fine.”
She watched him for a moment before turning her attention to Steve.
FRIDAY still replied in under three seconds, but for Tony it was a delay that may as well have been three hours.
“It’s delicious, Tony. Thank you.”
“Sorry.”
>>CAP: Give him everything.
>>CAP: Help coming yet?
Tony tried to read Steve’s expression or his tone, but any clues were hidden in his glance around for the bed controls and the whir as he raised himself to a sitting position.
HOW ARE YOU?
“What are you going to do?”
One foot went left, the other went right and Tony was left grasping at the bed frame to hold himself up as the door opened after a quick tap.
>>CAP: Good. Good. Any s…sign of rescue?
>>BIOSCAN: BOSS
Tony smiled and dropped a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Man with a plan! Sounds good.”
Tony watched Steve pick up the sandwich, listened for the crunch of the crust and lettuce and onion and couldn’t help but feel a small swell of satisfaction as Steve’s eyes closed while he chewed.
Maybe it was pity, some need for charity or closure, that had pulled Tony back to him after so long.  Maybe morbid curiosity. All the soldier knew was in that moment, he could briefly dream that it would last forever. For a sweet, infinite heartbeat he could lose himself in an illusion, and it was so achingly, beautifully comforting that he couldn’t resist it.
You'd think that being asleep for seventy years would have dimmed the pain somewhat.
Tony smiled at him, big and brilliant. This time Steve could read with perfect clarity the pain, the joy, the need hiding behind it.
"What are you going to say?" Clint quietly voiced the question that had been plaguing Steve during the painful trek of the last forty blocks.
If Steve could have seen the expression on his lover's face as the first quiet sound of distress broke through the soldier's lips, he would have understood everything.
Steve didn't need to be offered the escape twice. He turned on his heel and retreated to the closest bathroom, locking the door carefully behind him. He sank down onto the toilet lid and unwillingly met his own eyes in the mirror.
The soldier blinked, the sharp, spiking pain receding a little as his tense muscles slowly relaxed.
"Steve?" The sleep-fogged voice was quick to disappear, and the super-soldier could practically hear the assassin checking the phone's caller ID. Steve had never quite grasped the magic of it, but nowadays people seemed to have ways of knowing exactly who was calling and usually, where from. All Steve knew was that when Tony called him on the tiny, easily-misplaced little electronic device he'd insisted he carry, a little picture of him popped up. That was about as far as Steve had gotten with translating the thing's mysteries.
"It's tacky."
"Uh, sorry. What are you doing here, exactly?"
Of  breakfasts, too early in the morning while the city was still asleep but Tony wasn’t.  Cold sheets, soft against sweat-slick skin. Coffee on a windy balcony while the sun flickered between the skyscrapers like slivers of fire.
Of course he wouldn't stay. Steve tasted bitterness in his throat as he shook his head at himself in disgust.  He shouldn't be surprised. It was everything he'd expected, everything he'd feared. He was just grateful he'd been asleep for the part where Tony stood up and walked out of his life.
Since emerging from an icy tomb three years ago he'd found there were certain things—things from his previous life, things he'd never had the chance to explore before—that just didn't affect him like they used to. Weather, things like hot and cold and wind and rain, had been some of those things.
"Can't I stop in to say hello, Tony?" Bruce spread his hands, but it was that stupid half-smile, both knowing and pitying, that got under the billionaire's skin.
Steve Rogers knelt silently in front of a simple stone marker, the kind no-one used nowadays because lavish monuments and intricate symbolism had driven them out of style. Moss and age had dulled the edges of the once-crisp engraving, but the name "James Buchanan Barnes" could still be read clearly. This name, with a date of birth and a date of death, were all that was necessary to mark the habitant of the plot as a war hero and a great man.
Tony was here.  Or at least, he had been only hours before.  It was all too clear that the soldier was completely alone now.  Alone like he had always been.
Clint was waiting for him in front of Stark tower.
The blood in Steve's veins was boiling, and his head was throbbing and he wanted to badly to lash out, to hurt Tony back. But deep down, he knew that wouldn't solve anything. Whatever happened tonight; whatever they said to one another in hurt and anger... Tony wouldn't remember it in the morning. But Steve would, and he would have to carry the regret with him for years if he said anything stupid now.
Clint scoffed. "How about you 'stretch' when your intestines aren't falling out through your ribs, huh? Christ, Rogers."
"Tough. Super-boy or not, you're going to make yourself sick if you stay all drenched and pathetic like a drowned cat."
Steve allowed himself to slip into him, to slip away, and for the first time since he could remember, he wasn't lost in his own pain.  He didn't feel the crushing ache of his own worthlessness... he didn't feel anything but weightless. He was simply warm, and content, and safe for the first time in so long.
They continued the conversation-slash-argument all the way to the top floor of FAO Schwarz, where Pepper immediately departed his side to explore the racks of foreign wine imports. Normally, he would have joined her—far be it from Tony to turn down a good bottle of Port—but he'd made up his mind for the moment and made a beeline of his own for the media section. So maybe a small part of him was already convinced that this was a terrible idea, but for appearance's sake he thought he should at least make a show of browsing.
Sometimes Steve would pause at the floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out over the city and just stand there, unmoving, silent. Barely breathing. This could go on for hours. Tony would sit back on the arm of his couch and watch the super-soldier sadly, wishing he could climb inside his head and center him in the here and now... truly bring him back from wherever he went in those moments. The billionaire was convinced that Steve had no idea he did this. He certainly had no idea how much it well and truly terrified Tony.
"French, perhaps?" Bruce trailed a finger over the edge of the bar, checking it as if for dust.
The billionaire didn’t hesitate, his hands cradling Steve’s face as he kissed him back with a vengeance. Gone were the gentle touches of the previous night. This was sheer need, raw emotion, undiluted desperation.  Steve tasted hunger and relief and longing.
Eventually, one of the deck agents came hunting for Clint, and Steve had retreated to the quarters he was sharing with Tony. The billionaire was grieving too—looking for validation at the bottom of a bottle and wailing his anger and hurt out at anyone who came within hearing distance. The rest of the team was giving him a wide berth, unsurprisingly, but Steve didn't have that luxury.
By the time they parted, breathless, Tony was halfway laying on top of him, bracing himself against the back of the couch like he was somehow still trying not to hurt the soldier even when he wasn’t thinking straight.
Stark's eyes slammed shut and he held up a finger, tension radiating from every limb. "Don't. Just, don't."
Clint pulled back like he'd been burned. "You're right. I didn't." He glared at the super-soldier, rage burning behind his gaze like a fire Steve could physically feel. "But I came anyway."
He wasn't sure who lunged first—Clint or Tony—but both men were angry enough to act on their impaired judgment before they realized that Steve stood between them. Somewhere in the ensuing tussle an unfortunately-placed elbow jabbed the soldier in the side with as much precision as if it had been an aimed shot, and that was the end of his attempt to hold himself together.
"No," Tony approached quickly, jaw set, "no, these things don't happen. They—they can't happen."
"I'll wait in here." Clint read the soldier's mind without trying, wordlessly offering to give the two lovers their space, though from the look on his face it was the last thing he wanted to do at the moment.
He couldn't hear himself cry out, but he felt the sudden rumble exploding up out of his chest, ripped from him by forces outside his control as his body connected with metal and stone. He was falling, sliding, colliding with everything in his path. It seemed to last forever.
Jarvis did not grace him with a response, waiting patiently until Tony had hauled himself up and into a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. One of his mechanical creations, specifically designed for post-hangover mornings, waited by his bathroom door with a tall bottle of Voss and a handful of aspirin.
"I don't know."
"Why don't you just... get angry?" Tony waved his glass, only turning to face the object of his comment when Steve said nothing, at first.
The soldier faltered, fingers slipping on laces, but still couldn't meet the assassin's eyes. The words nearly undid him, nearly caused his weak resolve to crumble entirely. He'd never felt so low.
"It is not." Tony pretended to be offended. "It's American."
It wasn't fear, he told himself. It wasn't nerves.
"That was one time," Steve griped, but Tony noticed that he picked up his spoon anyway, looking properly contrite.
Tony shouldn’t be here.  Steve didn’t deserve this, hadn’t earned it.  He’d done nothing to be worthy of forgiveness or mercy or kindness.  Of eggs over-easy and coffee and toast.
Another man would have been dead already. The fall alone would have killed another man. He'd been lucky. It had only been a matter of time before something like this had happened.
"Home is home." The archer replied simply, allowing the first expressions of real mirth to drift across his features.
He'd never imagined this would be permanent. Even after they'd connected, Tony and Steve had never discussed future living arrangements. They'd simply migrated together, falling into a pace that was neither constant nor simple, but that fit their tumultuous lives like it was tailor-made for them.
“Sorry,” he repeated himself softly.  He couldn’t meet the other man’s eyes.
He didn’t.
His breath caught and shadows flashed down over his vision so fast that he couldn't stop it, couldn't even try. He was falling, pitching downwards into darkness. Steve was vaguely aware of alarmed voices overhead, strong arms catching at him, halting his descent, lowering him gently downwards.
He didn't bother pointing out that he would indeed love to call a cab, but his wallet was sitting in an old duffel bag on Tony's marble floor and all the money he carried was inside.
He didn't offer to drive Steve home.
"You don't." The assassin's words cut through Steve's like steel, leaving no room for argument or elaboration. He refused to turn around again and face the super-soldier, but Steve could read the anger in the line of his shoulders, rolling off of him in palpable waves.
“I tried to pretend you never existed. I just wanted to keep you away from this, from
The archer retreated to lean against the counter in the kitchen, letting Steve have a moment to regain his composure. For what seemed like hours, Steve slumped there, panting, and Clint tossed a folded knife back and forth between his hands, staring stubbornly out the rain-drenched window.
King's Hill was a spacious lot that had long ago seen too many gravestones and mausoleums crammed between its iron gates. No-one had been buried there in twenty-eight years, and many of the relatives of the dead had moved away or moved on, and no longer visited. The grass hadn't been cut in weeks, it appeared, and for a location in the heart of Brooklyn, the landscape held an aura of quiet and calm that easily transported one to a time and place where the man beneath the sod was more important than the monument that marked his final home.
But he couldn't. Because this was Tony, and if Steve had ever loved anyone, he loved this mess of a man. And he'd never been more certain that if anyone could ever learn to love him back... it was Tony. They were a disaster. But together, they had hope: anger and flying insults and blinding pain, but also real hope.
"When I heard what happened to you, I tried to fly into the warzone," Tony's voice rumbled through his chest, comforting and quiet. "I called in every favor I had trying to get into Mosul."
"Just say it." Steve's tone was defeated, eyes fixed firmly on the floor.
Steve had no response, mostly because Tony was right, just like always. The soldier slumped into Tony's embrace, weak against the onslaught of everything he wanted most.
But tonight, there was a change. It was small, and it shouldn't have meant much. It shouldn't have altered everything so drastically.
"I can see that. What's with the suit?"
The air between them was too loud.
"No." Clint answered bluntly, and he didn't seem to have to think about it. "I wouldn't. Because never in a million years would I believe that you would hurt Tony, even unintentionally. You treat the guy with kid gloves. You think no-one notices?
Gasping, Steve blinked harshly as he fought his way up out of the pain, focusing on the blinking dots of color that eventually—slowly—reformed to reveal the familiar ceiling overhead and two concerned faces hovering above him. Just like last night, voices were fading and out, breaking through in garbled fragments and half-thoughts he could barely keep up with.
"Sir, Doctor Banner is in the elevator." Jarvis intoned, "shall I grant him access?"
“Coffee just finished,” the brunette told him easily, “come on out when you’re ready.”
"Tony—"
"Get out of my face, feathers," Tony snapped at the archer as Clint moved to assist him, "I've got it."
"Thanks, Clint." He murmured quietly, joining the archer in watching the heavy rain trace paths of fractured light and color down the glass. "For everything."
Sighing quietly, Steve swiped the rain out of his eyes for the umpteenth time and practiced standing upright without support. He swayed a little, but the biting chill of the rain and wind was actually working with him for the moment, dulling his body's overall ache and focusing the worst of his distress into a pulsating brand just beneath his ribs on the left side. He could deal with this, he knew. He'd dealt with worse.
He knew them now.
His leather jacket was in shreds, but he managed to pull a fairly intact edge around his side to staunch the flow of blood as he staggered to his feet. Once he let the initial shockwave of agony wash over him, he found it wasn't impossible to make his way slowly back towards the entrance to Stark tower. The distance across the street and the small park between the buildings had never seemed to daunting.
He couldn't fashion words. He couldn't string two thoughts together long enough to make a plan, to formulate a strategy to save their ship going down. His foundations were crumbling and his body was trying to shut down, and it was very displeased that he would not allow it do so. He had to stay here, and hold himself together long enough to make sure that Tony did the same. How to accomplish this was the more difficult task.
Steve traced the stone-carved letters with his eyes, continuing the ongoing mental conversation the two had shared for months now. His own words in Bucky's voice still made more sense, as illogical as it was. His old friend had always made sense.
The world tilted around him in a rush of movement and two large hands were suddenly framing his face, holding him there, forcing him to look up.
His entire world had changed. And Steve simply didn’t know if he had it in him to keep up.
Not just Tony, but the full red-and-gold ensemble that the rest of the world both feared and loved. He was sure that Tony was in there, naturally—but finding a huge suit of armor pouring drinks at your wet bar isn't exactly the first thing you expect when you step into your suite.
"Not your fault."
At least that was one perk he could look forward to out of all this: he was exhausted enough that he wasn't likely to dream, a trick he'd learned on week-long missions with the Avengers. Stay tired, pass out, wake early. Rinse and repeat. Keep the mind racing to catch up with the body. It had worked so far and with any luck it would work tonight.
"Have you been watching me?" The archer spared a glance and a half-smile. "About fourteen seconds. You've been out for about ten hours, on the other hand."
There was no longer a future for him, and therefore no reason to take care of himself. He took his day one hour at a time.  He did whatever it took to temporarily dull the roar of pain in his leg and pain in his head and pain in his soul.
"I don't have my shield, Tony." Steve spread his hands imploringly. "I'm not in a suit; I'm not a solider. I'm just me."
Something flickered through Barton's eyes; something too quick and complex to catch. "Yeah." He answered quietly, not bothering to lie. "It's bad, Steve."
Tony snapped his fingers under his boyfriend's nose, not caring that it was rude. He needed Steve with him in the here and now, and that unspoken need translated into simple assholery sometimes. He could live with that if it kept the displaced soldier grounded.
Stark Tower stood highlighted against the skyline above, deceptively calm and peaceful in the clear night.
"Did you just...?"
Banner laughed at him, and damn but that was starting to get on his nerves. Tony tossed his empty bottle into the trash and slumped down the stairs.
Clint scoffed from somewhere to his right, letting out a lazy curse in a language Steve didn't recognize. Clearly, he wasn't buying it either.
Steve had moved in with Tony before they'd known this would last. He'd had nowhere to go with S.H.I.E.L.D. off his trust list and the billionaire hadn't blinked before offering him a home, as temporary or long-lasting as he chose.
Tony snatched his hand away, and didn't seem to notice when in doing so, he spilled bourbon all over the arm of his suit. "I'm inclined to disagree."
"I have to," was all the Steve could honestly say.
Steve silently thanked his best friend for being a mind-reader, and tried not to make it too difficult for either Clint or Tony as the two managed to work together just long enough to lug Steve's tall frame into the bedroom. As much as the soldier hated the coddling, accepting it as necessary for the moment seemed to be the easiest way to streamline his convalescence.
"Speaking of..." Bruce glanced around again, frowning. "Where is he? Steve?"
"Wanna try this again?"
at me!”
Steve had never meant to mention it. He really hadn't. He'd accepted his relational position and had allowed his relegation into silence and submission, and they didn't talk about things like this as a rule.
"What, you can't fight me because I'm human?" Stark was hovering over the rubble unsteadily, his boosters firing out of sync in his disoriented state.
"Jesus," Tony was saying now, and Steve must have missed something he'd said, "It's like talking to my grandfather."
"Dammit Tony, I don't want to fight you!" Steve's restraint snapped like a fraying thread, fists clenching. "Not because you're human, but because you're you."
Tony laughed in his face, and the predictability of it all hit Steve like a slap in the face. What had he thought would happen? Nothing was going to change.
And so, they decided to give it a try. They wouldn't see anyone else, and they would make a shot at pulling whatever they could out of the rubble of their current relationship. Maybe, Tony shrugged, they could turn it into something worth looking at.
Steve's throat clenched painfully, his sluggish brain awed and overwhelmed by the familiar sight. For a too-long moment, he was sure he was still dreaming.  The smoke cleared away.
"—a lot of blood, but we managed to get a hold of an IV." Clint was saying in his best soothing voice. It was a tone he reserved for children and Natasha and victims of unspeakable wars... and Steve.
“I love you, Tony,” he finally told him in the darkness.  A whisper, a promise.
"Yeah." He responded quietly. "What do you want to know?"
"So?" Tony lunged forward in what was probably meant to be an intimidating gesture; Steve automatically held out his arms to catch him if he toppled.
"No." The soldier slid onto one of the barstools, crossing his arms on the counter as he blankly watched Tony pour a bowl of cereal. His gaze started to slide back to the windows.
Steve let out a huff of surprised air, somewhere between a laugh and a sob.
"They wouldn't let me in," the words came out broken, like an apology. "I threatened to fire the damn pilot; swore I'd have the job of every man that stood between me and you."
"You with me, cap?" There was something strained and almost angry in Hawkeye's voice that Steve couldn't understand.
The soldier pulled his fingers through his hair for the fifth time and sighed heavily into his hand, hating that he felt so nervous and sick facing his own boyfriend.
"Agreed." Tony struggled silently before finally tucking the box under his arm.
"Oh, don't play so stupid." Tony's voice was rising with his temper, the glass finding a home loudly on the marble countertop. He reached angrily for a bottle of bourbon and poured gracelessly, mostly missing the glass. "Don't pretend this isn't happening. I know that you've got your little martyr persona wrapped around yourself so tightly it's become part of your skin. I know what you think about; what you don't say."
Tony woke up face down in his own mattress. He must have shed the suit sometime in the night, because it was nowhere to be seen. His sheets were a twisted, rumpled mess, and his head had become home to a splitting headache that could have woken the dead with its incessant pounding, but otherwise the place looked spotless. He must have been out cold if the combination of Jarvis and the maids cleaning up hadn't woken him.
