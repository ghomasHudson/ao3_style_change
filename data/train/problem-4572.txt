Terrified or not.
“Mmm, I think...” Dean muttered right next to Cas’s ear, the sound of his voice making him tremble with pleasure. It was curious – he had never realised how much he liked hearing Dean’s voice. What the sound waves echoing in his ear could do to him, when spoken from a distance so short. The human chuckled softly. “I think that might be the loudest I’ve made you.” A pause. “So far.”
His consent is all Dean needs – he hisses quietly as he touches his cock to lubricate it, breath stopping for a while as he angles himself against Cas’s hole, holding his partner’s legs from under his knees to support their position. He lets out a louder hiss as starts to push in, but his sounds are being drowned by Cas moaning. Slowly easing himself inside, Dean shudders, stops for a moment to just
No book gets written overnight. No story gets perfected with just a single dream. So even though the library has not had new prey in several months, there’s still plenty of work to be done.
Slowly, Dean’s hands fall away from the chains around Cas’s chest. He straightens his posture, huffs a breath through his nose.
"Holy fuck, Cas," Dean croaks, more at the fact he's talking than at his words, it seems.
OK. Something to consider later, something to maybe work his way up to mentioning to Cas
Did Cas just
Dean Winchester is standing up from his chair, the novel hanging from his hand. Finished. Their eyes meet. It takes Castiel a while to realise that he’s being smiled at.
He’s getting more and more pissed off by the minute.
been wanting to smirk at the almost-begging a second ago, but the tone Cas delivers those lines with is so intense, so far from a plea, yet not a command either...
His eyes fall shut.
Quietly, Cas brings his wings into the three dimensions surrounding them, letting them stay invisible but present. He drapes one, cautiously, over Dean’s head, letting it hover as shelter from the snow. “Just sleep, now,” he prompts gently, hoping Dean is already out of it enough to not argue with him.
, to try and fake obedience.
not hate them?” he asks, desperation in his tone. “Come on, please? Let me not hate your wings. I don’t care if they’re broken, Cas, I think your wings are beautiful.”
“Hey, buddy,” he says, softly, settling onto another easy chair, trying to maintain a distance from his partner that seems appropriate; not too far, definitely not too close. He knows there were no signs of any sexual assault, but Cas was gone for six damn months, so who can tell? Even if it wasn’t like that, Cas was obviously kept a prisoner for all that time, and Dean doesn’t want to bring back memories of violence, be that of any nature. He coughs quietly, eyes Castiel for a few seconds, then grabs up the poetry book from the coffee table. That’s another new; Cas was the one who really ever understood the appeal or literature.
“Yes. Apologies — it has been a long day.” His tone is flat, hoarse from not having said a word in... too long. “How can I help you?”
about the feel of the fabric around his wrists it sends a surge of pleasure down his spine.
Cas lets out a hum, as if thinking about it carefully. “For now,” he starts, lips moving against Dean’s skin, “I’d very much want to stay like this, for a while. To hold you, just to hold you.”
He uses all of his self-restraint skills to pull away after a while, but the low grunt Cas doesn’t manage to suppress, in protest of him doing that, makes it worth it. His angel’s eyes are dark with dilated pupils as Dean meets them.
, because the doors stay open a crack, instead of opening further, for several long seconds.
And Dean feels old, so old. Actually feels his forty years, instead of half of him being stuck in the illusion of a man of barely thirty. And maybe he’s done some growing, despite having missed it. He doesn’t think he’d have had this in him, ten years ago. This patience.
Dean pressed his palms against Castiel’s shirt, sliding to meet each other. Started to work on unbuttoning the garment, slowly, a bit hesitantly. Cas slipped his own hands under the human’s shirt to urge him to go on, stroking the skin of his back in circles.
He’s tied to a chair, Cas is staring at him with a look of

, can you? You physically can’t touch me.”
Castiel swallows a few times, shakes his head, makes conscious efforts to calm his breathing into a more steady rhythm. “No. No, I’m all right.” He’s not all right. “Thank you. I—” He lifts his gaze up to look at Dean again. Maybe he really is the taking-care-of-literally-everyone type, or maybe it’s the plea in Castiel’s eyes, he can’t say, but something has Dean’s eyes reflecting deep concern.
“Hey,” he mumbles with a low voice at Cas, as he moves to untie him, fumbling with the knots. “Good?”
The air comes to a stillness.
And he has to observe it happen.
“OK,” he murmurs, as Cas trails a path of new kisses along his face, starting from his forehead, grazing his nose, ghosting his lips, arriving at his chin. “That sounds good.”
Strange, how dominating his angel requires so much more trust from Dean than submitting for him does.
It’s perfect in all the ways it’s not; the both of them fumbling around something new, not really knowing the rules, yet. Figuring it out together, isn’t that what they’ve been doing their whole time together?
He hesitates again – he wants more, but with the wings manifested, he isn’t sure how it’d work, if it’d work, if Castiel would even want it to. But an idea is brewing. They have consistently used sex as means to wind down, to process emotions, and though it’s usually Cas taking control to help Dean let go, to give him a break from the responsibility of being in charge, they have switched their roles before, and if he’ll be able to, Dean would love the chance to be there for Cas in similar ways his angel has been there for him when he’s needed him, countless times.
The relief on Cas’s expression fades and is replaced by desperation. “I was against that. We knew you’d likely survive it, but risking your life like that-”
When one marries a guy who kills people for a living, instead of a marriage certificate, he gets a death certificate. It was the ultimate commitment from Cas. One Dean tried to vigorously talk him out of, in fear of trapping him to a life he would one day regret.
The next time he tries to reach the front side of the counter, he’s stopped.
is not the word he’d use.
He startles as he feels Cas shiver, hand shooting away from the feathers in a rush, but when he sees the look on Castiel’s face, he relaxes. Cas’s eyes are cast down, only open a crack, his features free of any of the tension that was there a few seconds ago. He looks as if... as if Dean’s touch feels
The newcomer’s lips quirk upwards as he leans against the counter, a spark glinting in his eyes as his body language spreads humane warmth towards Castiel’s direction.
“Excuse you,” he says as he opens his eyes to look at Cas, “I’ll do what I please with my own clothes.” He is
it if something aroused him. And Castiel knew him well enough to agree to say it if something was a strict no.
As much as he trusts Cain and Alex with medical care, though — there’s nothing they can do if Cas goes critical. They can’t perform major surgeries on their own; and if they need to hospitalise Cas...
; but Castiel is an innocent in all of this. Caught up in his line of job, Castiel might never have commited a felony in his life, but having been in a relationship with an assassin for over a decade wouldn’t look very nice on paper.
Perhaps it is just that it’s Castiel. That they’ve done their growing together. Perhaps Dean has sides to himself that don’t manifest around anybody else. Cas always brought out the best in him.
Cas loosens his hold of the coat, slowly letting go of his tension. Dean waits until he isn’t holding onto the fabric at all, before taking it as a permission to slide it off his shoulders.
Another kiss is exchanged before Dean moves to prep Cas, guiding his legs into a better position before circling his hole with a lubed finger. “Relax for me,” he mumbles, out of breath, pushing inside. “There we go...” Cas is being reduced more and more into a writhing mess under Dean, with each finger he adds. And his reactions are doing
. No one, ever...”
“Oh.” His frown disappears into raised eyebrows.

Dean studies him with his eyes, Castiel’s sadness reflecting from them. He has so much he wants to say – that nothing,
“Hm.” Cas takes his sweet time, letting his eyes wander Dean up and down again, before, with a tone of approval, “You are full of surprises.”
,” his eyebrows raise, “I see enough to know that something’s keeping you here against your will. It’s nothing I’ve encountered before, but your body language pretty much screams you want out of here. So just... let me help you. Let me try. Just for the hell of it, Cas, because I’m pretty good at what I do; just let me at least try. All I’m asking from you is that you talk to me. Honestly. And I promise you, I will do everything in my power to get you out of this place. Now I’m not gonna ask you if we have a deal, because the last time we did that, you kinda bailed—”
Being surrounded by
He clears his throat, searching for words. “Yeah, uh. Good job.”
Dean doesn’t object as Cas captures his lower lip in between his, deepening the kiss. He lets go of his hand to wrap his arms around Cas, his touch trailing against where his wings meet his shoulder blades before resting at his hips.
Towards Dean.
Charlie stays quiet for so long Dean gives up hope on getting an answer. Not as if she would know anyway.
His tone grows cold.
He’ll believe it when he sees it, but it’s starting to look like something
Dean jumps at the feeling of a hand resting on his shoulder, eyes darting towards Charlie, sitting next to him. Takes a breath, lowers his head again. Her hand stays still, grounding him.

in his eyes, and it’s turning Dean the fuck on.
He doesn’t sound that surprised, though, and maybe it makes sense to him as easily as Dean pieced it together in his mind. Whatever the case, Dean appreciates the way Cas is taking it: not making a big deal of it, certainly not acting as if there’s anything to be ashamed of. Which Dean realises he was dreading a little, in retrospect; he’s not used to,even after all their years together, having a

He lowers himself enough to lay a couple of kisses under Castiel’s knees, knowing the thin layers of skin to be sensitive spots. And the sounds his angel is making have him
Alone?
“I love you.”
Dean nods, aware of Castiel watching him as he secures his wrists to the headboard. He lets his eyes drift along Cas’s body after he’s done, waiting for just long enough for his angel to start shifting impatiently before smiling to himself and climbing on top of him on the bed, straddling him. Hands rest onto Cas’s chest, toying with his nipples, drinking in the desire in his eyes.
Not about the tug he feels, poking at his soul before gently nudging it forwards; not forcefully wrapping around him like the chains he’s never grown used to, but as a thread, bending, extending, never forcing, always adapting.
, Cas. Not blaming any of you. Would be blaming all of you if you hadn’t done it.” He pauses. “Thanks. I mean it.”

“Great,” Dean laughs. Seems to hesitate a little, before finger-gunning into Castiel’s general direction and stumbling towards the entrance... the

How does one love without touch? It’s new, delicious, maddening, being rendered unable to do nothing but stare as Cas steps back to unbutton his shirt, to do nothing but take in every touch he’s given, unable to give in return. It’s a real test on the durability of Cas’s tie; Dean keeps straining against it, tugging, every failed attempt at escape going directly to his cock, which is now also very much straining against the fabric of his jeans. The tie doesn’t relent, doesn’t loosen, doesn’t even tighten, just persistently stays a gentle yet firm constant, much like its owner has done the past decade. It takes Cas circling his fingers around one of Dean’s wrists for him to relax his hands.
, but their lips collide; gentle, sloppy, full of question marks. The both of them searching for answers they’ll have plenty of time finding together.

“Well, you need to eat before Cain is forced to perform CPR on you, and I’m pretty sure he isn’t that keen on kissing you—”
Dean takes that as a good sign.
Cas’s fingers curled against Dean’s hair, his other hand trailing across the human’s spine. He was fairly sure his neck would be left with very visible markings thanks to what Dean was doing. He was fairly sure he wouldn’t use his abilities to heal them.
Pages after pages of tragedies to be written.
“Dean, it’s Dean,” the man replies from behind him, his focus obviously elsewhere. “Winchester.”
“Colour?” he breathes, barely getting the prompt worded as he straddles Castiel properly once again, fumbling the bottle of lube open.
“I don’t
And he knows his arms are going to protest it later, knows people aren’t built to be tied up this long, but he just wants this moment to last longer. Cas helps him move in bed, and they stay there, snug against each other, for a long while, occasionally exchanging soft words, Cas rubbing Dean’s shoulders every now and then with promises of a proper massage when Dean can be safely unrestrained. The tie is gentle around his wrists, still, as if it were Cas’s hands holding him like that, safe.
Cas narrowed his eyes at him. ”Are you going to make me say it?”

“Hey. Everything good, buddy?”

His heart is racing as his consciousness starts to return, but waking up
. Nothing. The Empty. Why do you look like him?” He wants to ask
So, for the first time in decades, he talks about it. About how he has barely any recollections of his life before the library. About how he prays every time another person enters the building. About how he has no choice; how he tried to take his own choice, how that ended up in just... worse things. About what happens to the people who come there, how they die, are written into stories, and disappear. About how he is being used, about how he can’t control what happens to them. About guilt.
He doesn’t quite know how to react.
It’s blasphemy, not against God, Dean doesn’t give two fucks about God today, not if... It’s unholy enough to force the most alive eyes Dean has ever laid his on, closed, and as if him needing to handle that hasn’t been terrible enough, now Castiel’s broken body is left before him like this; never mind that he’s here by coincidence, never mind that no one knows he uses the abandoned church as a hideaway, an escape from himself, all that matters is
“But what do we
“Anything we want,” comes Cas’s reply.
“Here,” he says softly as he returns to Dean, placing the novel in his hands. “Just make yourself at home. Stay as long as you like. I close late on Mondays.” He takes in soft breaths, lowers his eyes. “It’s OK. It’s going to be OK.”
Cas swallows hard; it sounds like Dean is talking to himself, rather than really at Cas, but the words hit his heart,
. And he knows Cas knows he's there, even when he's not turning his head to make eye-contact. Cas always knows.
Considering the both of them have a habit of pretending to be OK. But the stoplights being an entirely different system of asking that help the both of them be honest during scenes.
He glances at the form of his husband sitting on the edge of the bed, hunched over, and curls into a ball, eyes half-shut, trying not to tremble.
And, God, he’s
“You meant it?” Cas manages, his voice strained, his hands pressing so roughly on Dean’s shoulders that he fears he might push him right through the mattress.
”Yeah. Did I wake you?” The corner of his mouth tugged into a small smile as he took his time to take in Dean's eyes – he'd never get tired of how expressive they were, how they were an ever so soft feature in his often so hardened demeanor. How they observed him. He'd never get tired of Dean looking at him.
“Good,” Cas murmurs, and the way he runs his hand through Dean’s hair as he says it makes it feel like praise, almost.
“Just need information,” he says, voice strained. “I... I’m coming back for you, OK? I don’t just leave people behind. That’s not me. I just — don’t know enough. I need to hit the lore with Sammy, I need — I’ll be back for you.” His features are shifting from fierceness to uneasy sadness. “I’d never leave anyone like this if I could help it. I’m...”
Cas shifts his hands away from the wall, slowly, not quite daring to believe what is happening — but nothing forces him back, nothing holds him back.

He wants to know what the hell happened to his world; what happened during the six months Dean spent in his own personal hell, after Castiel’s disappearance, after the murder scene that hadn’t seemed so fake at the time, before he ended up on that cross, in the church. He dreads the answers Cas might have for him, but he

“Hey, tell you what,” Dean says easily, circling at the front of the counter, snatching a pen from the holder, a piece of paper from his jeans pocket. Smiles at Castiel again before scribbling something down. “Since you managed that — how about a reward? I’m in town for a couple of weeks, just pick a bar, a restaurant, anything. My treat. If you want. Or if you’d rather just pretend this never happened, that’s fair. But,” he slides the paper towards Castiel, his features warm, “the offer stands. Deal?”

But maybe that... is exactly what he deserves.
Dean chuckled at that. He placed his free hand on the back of Cas's head, pulling him closer, resting his forehead against Cas's, which prompted the latter to let his eyes fall shut. Their lips met, and Castiel placed his hands lightly onto Dean's sides.
(But what if he never will be?)
And as trained as Cain and Alex are in medical care, none of them know too much about... psychiatric care.
Each of their kisses felt like the making of a whole new universe, one just for the two of them. An angel who fell in love with a human. A hunter who fell in love with a broken angel. They were unconventional, in a number of ways, but it bothered neither of them. Cas had a peace in Dean, a resting place, a love, a

“Dean, the entire point of this is that I keep an eye on you,” Cas responds.
“Even if your
“Uh, never mind what the fuck,” Dean continues. “I’ll take that, while it lasts, just... just... come on.” He stares at Cas, the both of them dazed, offers his hand to help him on his feet. “Let’s get you out of here before the universe decides to, I don’t... know what just... OK, moving, now.”
. It doesn’t register at first. “First you say he’s… he doesn’t… then you...” he stammers.
“Yes,” Cas replies, his tears falling against the skin of the crook of Dean’s shoulder and neck. “You can stop fighting. Life’s not supposed to be a fight, and you’ve... fought long enough, for one.”
“Green. As long as you won’t take photographs, even ones you’d delete straight off,” Cas replies.

And it’s not as if it’s… important.
He’s grown smooth at this part of his existence — the same little small talk he offers everyone, these days, decades of rehearsal making every little move second nature. But it’s not just acting, with Dean. There’s a candle flame residing in his heart, one he can foresee wreaking havoc with burns once he loses it. Maybe that’s a good thing.
Maybe he just was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He has come to believe the library simply needed someone, after the previous vessel was used up.
Cas quirked an eyebrow, making zero attempts to move further from the human, feeling his breath against his skin. ”Probably not. But you can always

”Make you?” Dean replied, sitting next to him, wrapping a casual arm around his waist. ”Could I even
So as he settles onto the chair, it’s not the worst thing ever, the gentle care Cas handles him with.
“Yeah, I kinda figured that part,” Dean says, offering him another smile. “Just...
“Green.”
. These, and a galore of other relevant points, have been what he’s tried to get through Cas’s thick-ass celestial skull, without so much as an exasperated huff from the latter.
. “If you ever come here again — just don’t. Get out. You are not welcome here.”
Because he’s not going to be that selfish. He’s not going to risk an innocent life; if Dean is lucky enough to get out of those doors twice, he’s not about to...
Dean moves his arms behind the back of the chair himself, but Cas is the one to shift them, with a light hold of his wrists, to reach a more comfortable position. There’s something extremely vulnerable about it, willingly letting someone restrain him, compromise him. And it’s still something Dean wants to roll his eyes at, that Cas is, from the feel of it, going with what he insisted in the first place: his tie. This, too, comes down to multiple layers of issues: Dean’s urge to point out how grabbing a pair of handcuffs would be more convenient, easier; how Cas shouldn’t bother caring whether Dean has the cuffs, unforgiving and painful in the case of a struggle, round his wrists. Even rope would be easier. It’s counterproductive, using a tie, the slippery material needing more knotwork to hold a person effectively than the coarseness of a rope, or the click of a handcuff. But trust Cas to take his time in favour of making sure Dean feels as comfortable as he can.
. I’ve done my homework — this library?” He gestures around them. “Doesn’t even exist, on paper, at least. Not a single record, not on any map. Nothing. I mean, I thought there was something off about — something — the first time I popped in... What I don’t understand is why you don’t just walk out the doors. And before you tell me you
“Thought so. You know, I think my brother once told me that I invented the gonna-drive-you-away-with-insults when about to do something stupid. You can’t fool the master.”
“I’m—”
“How’re you feeling?” There’s reassuring experience and compassionate strength in Dean’s tone, as if he’s no stranger to taking care of others. “You need me to call 911?”
The man stares back at him, for a few seconds, before bursting into laughter, stepping back from the counter, bending over. Castiel tilts his head slowly, observing the stranger. “What’s so funny?” In all honesty, the wholehearted way the man laughs is the most pure joy Castiel has seen in all of his decades trapped in the library. He doesn’t know whether it makes him happy or sad. Maybe both.
Fuck, he’s just going to have to say it. Cas is in full-on protective mode, not seeing the full picture.

“Wait—”
And he doesn’t know what is going to happen if this one actually finishes his novel.

“Great job, Chuck, universe, whoever,” he mutters to himself, turning around, pulling his shirt down. “Someone messed up big this time.”
And for several seconds, the both of them were trying really hard not to smile.
(”I’ve been basically married to you for five years, you ass, so unless you want to break up with me, deal with it,” Cas had finally said, and that had been that. And then, his features growing less stern, that stupid, beautiful, endearing, loving smile taking over, “Dean, I love you — could you stop trying to make me stop for five seconds and trust me?”)
But the doors are closing behind Dean, once more trapping Castiel out of the reach of the sunlight.
He’s able to pick himself up from what he’s lying on, but he can’t sense
He turns around and tears himself off the reading area, returning to his post behind the counter, hands pressing tight against the wooden surface.

narrows his), “You don’t know...” His words are slow as he keeps studying Dean with his eyes. “My, my, my… You honestly don’t know.”
“I promise.” There’s enough confidence in his tone that Dean believes him. And Cas maybe understands the need to be absolutely honest about this better than Dean feared he would, having usually been on the dominant side of these dynamics.
“You saying you want to...?”
Dean bites his lip from across the table. He hums. “...Yeah. And you’d be stuck being the delivery boy. Wanna reconsider?”
. “It’s a date.”
—and they open.
Dean pulls the covers over them, resting his face against the crook of Cas’s neck; the latter draping his arm around Dean’s waist.

Dean studies him, with care. “Are you sure?” he asks. “I don’t wanna make this worse. We do this, you gotta promise to safeword out the second anything gets uncomfortable, OK? And I mean
And Castiel Krushnic is, according to the records, dead.
He sighs. A heavy weight lingers on his heart, and then, just like so, fades away, as if just deciding to leave, to find a new residence. He moves closer to Cas, exhales a shaky breath. There is a sensation of freedom he can’t remember experiencing before.
Dean finds himself unable to handle the prolonged eye-contact but a fraction of his normal tolerance (one builds that up, living with Cas), and shifts the little he can in his chair. Clears his throat. Fixes his gaze somewhere between the wallpaper and empty space.
“Is this still all right?” Cas asks, his lips touching Dean’s earlobe.
“Sorry about the ‘buddy’, man. You always hated that,” Dean mumbles as he searches for the page he was left off last night. He needs to get a damn bookmark. “Said it made it sound like you were being friendzoned. OK, here we go, love. See? I’m capable of being cheesy, as well. Well, you know better than that, Cas. People wouldn’t believe the romantic crap just being in the same room with you made me wanna do for you. You know,” he huffs a mournful laugh, “I’m not even gonna bitch about it. If...
Blues search the vibrant greens, in desperation. It doesn’t look like Dean is giving up on him. It doesn’t look like the library is about to devour him, either — even if it was, Cas has no idea what else he could do to try to prevent that from happening.
“I’m sorry, man,” the guy wheezes, trying to catch his breath, straightening up, his eyes glinting even brighter at Castiel’s direction. He shakes his head, a full-on grin on his lips. “No, no, I meant — I meant lore. Mythology, anything. Not fiction.”
Nobody chooses the library.
Cas desperately wants to scream at his lover — to wrap his arms around him tight and never let go, to keep reassuring him, over and over, that it's
(never)
fall in love with him.
“Tell me if you want me to stop,” Dean says quietly as he experiments with it, tracing his fingertips along the feathers, the joints, the bones, his left hand still holding Cas’s.
“Good,” he replies, releasing the tension he didn’t notice he had been building on his shoulders. Trails a few kisses along Cas’s cheekbone, finishing with one against his lips before pulling away. “All usual rules apply. I would like to... tie you up, other than just your wings, too. And I would like you to see yourself, tied up. We don’t exactly have a full body mirror in your bedroom, but I’ll - I will think of something. I want you to see yourself.” He lets Cas consider that. “Colour?” It’s easier than asking
Cas heaves his upper body from the floor, trying to get back on his feet, but as soon as he sits up, his chains are tugging at him again, effectively pinning him against the wall, leaving him only inches of freedom to move. He tries to struggle against their force, frustrated (and, yes, scared), but freezes at the realisation that he can
and gentleness and…
Giving up — has never been an option, not for Dean Winchester, not when...
Finally, Dean does.
” But he knows that isn’t how it works; Cas can’t read minds. It’s a mistake on the human’s end if a thought slips into a prayer. He’s panicking now, anyway, because
him?! And the unthinkable: he’s dead. He’s dead, once more, and doesn’t need Charlie or anyone, anymore, and he must have cried out, because Charlie is hurriedly updating him, and Cas, Cas is still alive, still breathing.
His eyes still on his partner, his everything.
All of the ones working under her are people Dean considers family. Charlie, though... Charlie is practically a sister to him. The one of them closest to his heart.
“He will.” Her voice is barely a notch louder than Dean’s, but there is confidence in her tone. “He has a family. He has us. And Dean, he has
It’s hard to keep breathing.
“Good.” Cas presses another kiss, this one onto Dean’s cheekbone.
“Words, Cas,” Dean prompts, a smile playing on his lips as he takes a second to watch his partner. He’s so gorgeous, eyes still half shut, tugging at the rope binding him.
“None of that.”
Eventually, even as the images of his lover, crucified, persist, Dean’s panic dulls into a miserable lull of exhaustion. He ignores his friends’ attempts to urge him to get some rest; he’s trusted Cain with a plethora of stab wounds, gunshot wounds even, over the years, but that was all for
No. It doesn’t feel like he’s alone, anymore.
The thread binding Cas’s soul to Dean’s flows between them like a river, like an uncontrollable force, washing through the both their hearts. Cas shivers, feels something unravelling, while new bindings are being agreed upon.
Third button, Cas bit onto Dean’s lip gently, evoking a sigh from him. The rest were opened with less hesitation, and they only broke the kiss for more than a second to breathe when Dean started sliding Cas’s shirt off his shoulders. The latter removed his hands from Dean’s back to let him, then returned the gesture, faster than the human had been with his shirt, helping him out of his shirt as well.
“Do they hurt...?” Words whispered against his angel’s lips. And for a moment he’s worried; what if Cas has been in pain for all these years, never letting anyone know? But Cas shakes his head.
“I never… I don’t deserve-”
Castiel breathes through his nose, even but shallow breaths. Heaves out a broken sigh as the doors resume their movement, opening, not closing, opening and bringing upon the fate of the stranger stepping inside. He presses his eyes shut, tight, heartbeat settling, hope breaking.
Nothingness itself...
Dean spins on his heel. The entity he’s gazing at is
Cas shies away from praise, so Dean simply raises his eyebrows a fraction of an inch, letting his endearment show on his features before he leans to place a kiss on his partner’s forehead.
There’s nothing beautiful in the light of the sun, after all that time.
Castiel trails his lips along Dean’s neck as the latter wraps his fingers around him, gently shifting them along his cock while Cas kisses his neck, rough. Their breaths fall into a similar, heavy rhythm.
. He nods, summons a soft smile, closes his eyes as Dean leans closer, expectant of the gentle touches he’s kept offering him.
them. The chains, black and thin, circling his body, in plain view. His stare remains fixed at his left wrist, his breath refusing to flow, until Dean’s hand rests against his cheek, gently. This time, it doesn’t startle him, even though his attention snaps to the touch. “Can you see them? The chains? I’ve never — I’ve never actually seen them...”
to hide them from me. Cas, I don’t care if... I’m not gonna judge you, or...” He knows that it’s thick, coming from him, judging by how he handles his own moments of weakness. But just because he fails to let people help him... is no excuse to want his loved ones to be as stubborn.
”Dean?”
“This is different.”
Dean reaches for Charlie, not caring about all of his broken parts being there for her to see, for once in his life; just clings onto her and cries and cries and cries.
the most.”
“Colour?”
“Was it the tie?” Cas asks, leaning a bit closer, all analytics, as if to take a look at the restraint from over Dean’s shoulder.
But he hasn’t woken up. Cain says it’s not abnormal. But even if he’s physically safe and sound...
“How many times-” Dean argues, but doesn’t try to stand up. “That’s
Cas’s lips curl into an amused smile, and it’s the most beautiful sight Dean has seen in his life.
Dean briefly bites his lip, his gaze wandering towards Cas’s wings before returning to the ocean blue eyes. “You liked the angel proof rope the last time,” he says, hesitating, not wanting to go too far. “I know I’m not as intricate with ropes as you can be, but... I could try. I could... Maybe I could make you see what I see when I look at your wings. Make them beautiful, even in your eyes. Maybe it’s pointless, I don’t want to have you feel like I’m hiding them again if I fold them with bindings, I...”
He doesn’t feel dead. It’s nothing but nagging gut instinct, tugging at his consciousness, but he feels – wrong. Not whole. Transparent, to the point of staring at his forearm a long moment to make sure he isn’t.

doing it with a shirt again. And my wings...” He pauses. “Let my wings stay like this, for now, I don’t mind.”
“Better?”
“—we have a cosy little reading area. Who knows, maybe you’ll fall in love with a story, today.”
“Trust me, I know.”
“I...” Cas starts, loosening his hold, his breathing shallow. Their eyes lock with each others. There are questions, too many questions, buzzing between them like electricity. There are things in need of being talked about.
He runs a finger over dusty book spines, carefully pulls out a thin fantasy. He goes for comfort, with this one. A new world, with little to no conflict, with familial warmth. He likes to imagine there’s something bigger than him guiding his choices, but he has no illusions of it being more than self defense, an attempt to make his own fate a bit more bearable.
It’s as if he’s standing on nothingness itself.
. So he does.
His fingers adept, all-knowing on Dean, the sight of his other hand on himself, the fucking overflow of sensation and emotion pushes Dean over the edge fast, sending him into a freefall he can simply let happen, with the knowledge that he’s going to be caught. He’s floating, not tethered to earth the way he should be, vaguely aware of Cas following him a few moments after. And floating is fine, with Cas’s hands grounding him, holding him firmly.
— Dean isn’t sure if it’s his brain, if he’s speaking aloud, if it’s Jody, next to him in the car, but
His arm drapes around Castiel’s waist, fingers circling around his cock, and the quiet moan escaping Cas is enough to make Dean shudder as he bites his lip to suppress one of his own. He strokes Cas from base to head, slowly, a few times, before withdrawing his hand again. As an afterthought, he starts wrapping the rope around Cas’s forearms, up towards his elbows, binding them against one another. He hasn’t done bondage exactly like this before on Cas, but Cas has bound him this way more than once – and he’s testing waters to see if he’d like to be on the receiving end of that. “When you do this for me,” Dean mumbles, close to Cas’s ear, “not sure why, but it really gets me. There’s more... submission to it like this, isn’t there?” He trails his fingers down from the bound elbows, to his wrists. “You’re more completely bound than I’ve ever had you.”
His chest is bare under the trench coat, but that isn’t where Dean focuses his attention on. He watches as the smooth feathers, partly fragmented and scattered along the structure of the wings get released from under the fabric. They rise slightly and move a few inches, as if wanting to be free and stand proudly instead of being folded against Castiel’s shoulder blades, but too shy, too hesitant to really do so. The feathers are ink black, a more intense version of a night sky – with specs and diamonds of turquoises and emeralds reflecting light faintly, like stars and galaxies scattered across a broken surface. Broken or not, the sight takes Dean’s breath away; he can’t comprehend how Castiel can
Unless Cas thinks he’s not good enough for Dean.
He holds it as he steps in front of Cas, bites his lips as he tries to find a good angle. “Can you see?” From Castiel’s point of view, he should be able to see the reflection of his back – of his wings –  reflected behind him.
He knows what it’s like to willingly give up all control to someone he absolutely trusts. He knows how
Cas nods with extreme tension. Dean feels like his brain might explode. “How is
The thought is so selfish it makes him wail for several seconds. Cas holds him through his walls breaking, holds him through the wails and the sobs and finally the rivers of tears calming into droplets. And then, through the quiet.
It’s just that Cas is
Not when it’s about his people.
What started with tenderness and soft touches transitions into haste and eagerness; it’s evident in the way Cas keeps sighing, in his silent way of not-quite-moaning Dean’s grown accustomed to, that he might be discovering something new about his own tastes here as well. His caresses turn a little rougher, their kisses more sloppy. Pants get fumbled off, in Dean’s case causing slight trouble due to him being trapped on the chair, and though that would seem like the easiest part, Cas leaves them at his ankles, not pulling them all off, and for some reason that just adds to everything else, leaving Dean more helpless and more wanting.
“Cas...” He steps closer. Lifts his hand, lets it hover above Cas’s shoulder for a few seconds before resting his palm, gently, on top of the familiar fabric of the coat. He can feel the steady fall and rise of his breaths.
As much as it terrifies him, that Cas never as much as makes eye-contact with him, Dean is also able to find a sense of calm in their new norms. Waking Cas up by letting the sunlight in, cooking him breakfast. Urging him gently towards everyday things, like showering (and it gives him hope that Cas settles into a daily rhythm, is capable of taking care of his basic needs, doesn’t need Dean to do everything for him, understands him even when he is failing to communicate back at him), sitting at their balcony if the weather allows it, curling up in the living room and reading aloud until his voice is hoarse... It’s a change of pace, really. Charlie claims it’s good for Dean as much as it is for Castiel, after not allowing himself much other than work for the past half a year.
He’d scream, only there’s no breath left in him; it’s as if his very
’ in his tone. Also relief. There’s such relief in Cas’s tone, his features, that it makes Dean’s heart crack a little. How has he not seen all of this before?

, you son of a bitch,” Dean spits. “You’ve made it clear you can’t harm me, that I’m poofing out of here in, what, a few minutes? Just do us both a favour and go… make rounds on the sleeping angels. Leave me alone.”
; quiet, as always, yet still full of desire and need. Low moans, sharp gasps of air. They are both hard, Dean’s cock leaking pre-come without even having been touched. He awkwardly fumbles for the bedside table as he moves up along Cas’s body again, swearing under his breath before he manages to yank the drawer open.
“That’s
The concrete hitting his knees is there, at the back of Dean’s mind, the impact sending surges of pain up his thighs, dulling sooner than he deserves it to dull.
Without waiting for the human to reply, Castiel easily turned the tables, pinning Dean under him on the bed. He was sure Dean knew exactly where he liked and disliked to be touched, but it’d be fun to discover those spots for himself, in any case.
Maybe that’s as good as it gets — maybe the darker days will lessen and the brighter ones will seem just an inch brighter, as time goes by. But maybe... this is it. The aftereffects of Naomi, always ready to come back to haunt him. And maybe that’s OK. Maybe that’s not awful, at all. Could it be, that he will eventually be able to stop living as her victim, and start living as his own person, again, even with the memory of what she did to him there? He doesn’t know, but with Dean by his side, it doesn’t seem unlikely, at all.
“Not by choice,” Cas interrupts, finally finding his voice.
He circles around Cas to tug the knots holding his arms loose, rubbing at his muscles while he unwraps them, and brings his hands in front of him with a single wrist still tied. Then works simple loops around the both his wrists to tie his hands in front of him. Playfully pushes him towards the bed. Helps him settle onto it before lifting his wrists at the headboard by the rope. “Colour?” he asks, meeting his eyes.
And finally, “Can I stop fighting?” He’s asking Cas for permission, one he can’t grant himself. He’s spent his entire adult life
They glare at each other for a while, before Cas yields, lowering his eyes, and just sits down next to Dean. “At least
. But he can't find his voice, he can't... It's not that he doesn't want to communicate. He just struggles to have... control over his words. He spent a lifetime (it feels like at least) holding his tongue around Naomi. In fear of her hurting him, even if she never managed to properly make him
“Your wings are
It may be one of the reasons Dean finds this whole situation to be more tolerable with Cas rather than someone else, that he so swiftly manages to shift from the epitome of gentleness and patience to done-with-your-bullshit no-nonsense authority, and back again. However, right now Dean’s starting to wish it
“Did you just seriously smite a crapton of
His head snaps towards the library doors as he hears them creak open. The only life he knows has him expecting a new prey.
He strokes Cas’s wing with a gentle touch, kisses a feather again, moving up towards the bone structure. His lips brush lightly at first as his hands stroke along towards the ends of the farthest feathers hitting the floor, his caresses slowly easing into something more certain and less cautious as Cas shivers and leans the wing back against Dean’s touch. Slowly, he starts to entwine the long rope among the feathers, weaving it among their maze, before gently bending a joint of the wing to bind the point close enough to the tip and level enough with the shoulder blade to the base, where skin turns feather, folding the wing to rest against Castiel’s back, against his bound arms.
Towards a man who is practically a complete stranger to him.
Cas's hands twitch and Dean reaches for them,
"Cas?"
Nothing feels different inside the library, at all. Nothing has changed, aside from the obvious.
“Do you... want to do something about it?” Cas asks, contemplative. “I really wouldn’t feel comfortable leaving you unobserved, untied, with... But that’s up to you, not me. What I’m trying to say is that I recognise you are in a very compromised position, and I don’t wish to do anything against your will, Dean.”
“No,” Cas says, closing his eyes for a second. “No, just... looking at my wings.” He pauses. Breathes in deeply. “You’ve made them... Dean, I can honestly see them as more than simply broken,” he says gently, offers a soft smile. “Thank you. I just... it’s too much. Looking at them for so long. Everything else is OK. I’m OK.”
“Yeah,” Dean confirms, hazily looking up at Cas. “But it’s definitely not the hex.”
“I mean, I’d hope so--”
, Castiel thought, but before he could come up with a plan of action, Dean had moved onto his neck.
The Entity regains his grin as he steps closer, halting a foot from Dean. “Can’t blame me for
Why hadn’t he asked for help?
Doesn’t know which would be kinder.
Dean snorts. “Glad you’ve been taking care of them,” he replies, softly.
“No. Not leaving you here. Again.”
He thinks it has been decades since he last felt the sunlight caress his skin, rather than just see it from the brief crack of the library’s doors, whenever someone enters.
Dean has no right to be the one breaking down. Not in front of Cas, at least. No. And the judgement he places on himself makes him break down completely.
“I just can’t resist your charm,” Dean replies, only partially joking.
“I had all intentions to come back, with my brother, guns blazing.”
All he can do, though, is to try to make the guy’s last moments as comfortable as he can. Still, distracting people with kindness and not getting attached is a hard equation to solve.
. There is zero doubt they will find their way home; it’s only a matter of time.

“How?”

is being squeezed out of him, and all things considered, maybe that would be a blessing.
“I just need more information.”
And just like that, Cas’s hand is gone, and Dean can barely contain himself and not whimper at the loss of the sensation. Meanwhile Cas is just there, his eyes full of concern. And it’s one of those moments where Dean has to wonder how anyone can

“Let me guess. You’re ’the Cosmic Entity’ in charge of,” Dean gestures at their surroundings, “
“We’re taking a break,” Castiel decides as Dean’s eyes fail to focus on him. “You need to rest. You’re going to collapse sooner rather than later, at this rate.”
The both of his angel’s wings, deep black glimmering with hints of coloured light he doesn’t understand the source of, soft yet firm feathers woven with the rope, black against black, folded so that they can be visible, proud; beautifully wrapped in ropes, resting against Castiel’s arms, his back.
“Oh.” Castiel’s lips curve into a whisper of a smile, despite himself. That makes more sense. He tilts his head further, making eye-contact. “No, I’m sorry. We’re exclusive to fiction.” Even so, it’s too late for the man to change his mind and walk out the doors. Castiel wishes he’d chosen another library, even as he knows better.

company. I missed your company.”
Dean nods. Sure, yeah, he supposes, though
, and he’s having none of Dean’s whining about it. His patience has its limits. Especially when what’s at stake is his loved ones’ safety. So, without saying anything, he lets go of Dean to crouch and rest his palm against the layer of snow covering the forest ground, nearly a foot thick. He gathers his grace. “Close your eyes,” he tells Dean, doesn’t wait for him to argue. Concentrates his energy, lets it blast through the snow in a flash of brightness, the snow under his hand and the surrounding few feet melting, the withered grass on the ground drying; he only stops as a brush catches flame, extending his arm to put it out.
“I thought it’d… mmm, make you feel at

His hands are sweating, bringing more awareness to the fact that he’s restrained as the fabric dampens. Fuck, of all the things...
About…
Dean knows what he’s getting at. Their relationship is healthy enough that he gets it, how they’re probably supposed to take their time talking through it, establishing limits, safe words, whatever, sure, he gets it - but he just wants Cas; yes, because he’s turned on, but he also
And the wings. Feathers brushing against his shoulders, the floor. “Hands,” Dean prompts as he steps closer, crouching behind Castiel. “I love you,” he mumbles against the back of his neck as his request is instantly met with obedience. The three words come easier every time, more naturally. Dean starts to wrap one of the ropes around Castiel’s wrists, securing them behind his back, making sure the bindings won’t hurt him. “Colour?”
“Be silent, and put your mouth into better use, Dean.”
“Charlie,” he’s surprised he even manages her name into the receiver.
Dean can’t help glancing at her.
Dean doesn’t want to think about it.

Of course Dean would think this was
Cas finally turns to look at him, brow knitted, a question in his eyes before his expression softens into something terrifyingly
“It’s just a precaution. If you’re still feeling all right in a couple of hours...”
“You wanna stop?” Despite the smirk, Dean was breathless, himself. “Or to go on?”
, if...” Dean interrupts himself, shakes his head. “I know you know to do that. All right, trusting you, now.”
“Mutual,” Cas breathes.
Cas could hear Dean getting up from his bed and make his way to the closed door. Next moment it opened, green eyes studying him from the crack of the door. ”Hey, Cas. You all right?”

is happening.
“You have to tell me to stop, if for any reason at all you...”
”No. Was just resting.” Dean opened the door wider, inviting Cas in. ”What's up?”
They are both losing themselves in the moment, Cas quiet aside from the shivers and the brief gasps of breath he inhales. Dean just gazing at the wing his fingers are adventuring on, shifting enough to be able to reach the tip hanging close to the floor, but to still keep holding onto Cas’s hand gently.
, when...” He gives up. “Yes, I did.”
“You’re secure,” Cas says, still behind him, and Dean can’t tell if his tone is reassuring, apologetic, or both. He’s not wrong, though; it appears that in addition to his wrists being tied behind his back, he's been attached to the chair.

. That clear?” He wouldn’t forgive himself if he managed to add to his angel’s misery. Not with his wings. Not with this.
Cas let out a hum, pretending to consider it. Then let the corner of his lips tug into a smirk of his own. “You had your turn. Only fair, if…”
No, nope, he can’t comprehend where this is going.

“Right, sorry, the point being, might as well try with food you actually like. Meaning absolute junk.”
“Cas, you’re killin’ me here, man.” It’s the closest he can manage to
Cas arches his neck. “I… see why you like it,” he replies, his breath coming as shallow huffs. “Dean...”
He very rarely lets himself consciously think about it.
It’s unimaginable enough to have had a person walk out of the library unaffected; but to have him return — Castiel’s dusty corner of a universe is turning upside down.
Castiel runs a hand over his face before opening his eyes and facing the man, arranging his features into a businesslike smile; the only fate he has in this world, is to play his part. (He’s tried to rebel. Oh, he’s tried. And every single time, it has ended badly for the library’s next victim. The least he can do is
Castiel keeps his smile intact as he watches the man frown — at him, at himself, at the building. He can see his mind faltering.
He waits for several moments before withdrawing his hand, to examine the restraints. Cas can tell from his tone that, familiar with the paranormal or not, Dean has no idea what he’s up against, what he even can do.
He steps back, walks to Cas’s wardrobe, every step deliberately crafted, because he needs to focus to keep his body language dominant – and he keeps it up, even as he steps out of Cas’s field of vision, on gut instinct. Knows without looking that Cas will be keeping his eyes forward. Dean grabs the black, soft ropes from a cardboard box behind Cas’s shoes, the threads of the ropes individually carved with appropriate warding to make them angel proof.
“I know.”
. He wasn't sure what Dean had found in him – but it had to be something, judging by the way he was kissing him. It was soft and caring, breathless and needing. Cas finally broke free but refused to pull away, instead shifting closer to Dean, his hands wandering towards his hips. ”It was a good effort.”
In hope.
Dean huffs a sigh, his thoughts wandering.
But it’s still Cas, reaching his peak first, with an inaudible moan Dean sees through his half-open eyes, and the shudders moving through his body, muscles tightening around Dean, the look on his face, all of it is enough to drive Dean into his own orgasm.
touch Cas, here and now, he wants to do this as carefully as he can, too. Wants to do this for Cas. So he takes his time, before finally moving back to admire the sight in front of him.
“No one has ever touched them before,” Cas mumbles, as if in a response to Dean’s unworded question. “Not in this form. In their true form, back in Heaven, yes, but... it’s... I’ve never... This is... different.”
Not that the man screams the reading type; in here, though, it doesn’t matter.
The force knocks him on his back on the floor, violently dragging him past several shelves of books before he hits the top of his head at a wall. He’s vaguely aware that Dean is following him, rushing after him, saying something, he doesn’t know what, can’t make it out, but his tone is angry, scared.
“Listen, pal,” he goes on, “I literally have no idea what you…
Finding his determination again, Dean opens the doors, walking outside with his head held high, tugging Cas to follow him; and the moment Cas believes comes when he has to close his eyes at the sun caressing his skin, feeling both the warmth of the star the Earth is orbiting, and the warmth of Dean’s hand, tightly held in his own.
“Fuck...”
Slowly, he complies, the oceans of his eyes flicking up to face Dean’s.
Cas looks bewildered for what feels like an eternity; but then slowly leans down, cups Dean’s face with his hands. “You know, then,” he mutters, his eyes fluttering half-shut. “That defying Heaven wasn’t the only way I fell for you.” Dean half wants to point out what a big pile of
“Charlie.”
Dean stares. “What,” he starts, resisting an urge to close his eyes and pinch the bridge of his nose, “what the hell are you talking about?”
And all Cas can do is try to regain his composure, to remain as calm as he is able.

. Come back for you. I will.”
“Oh,” the man mirrors his words. “Guess I should’ve tried my luck at the town main library, eh?” Castiel recognises the look on his face, the confusion working its way into his features. The vitality of his forest green eyes (it’s been so long since Castiel has seen such a shade of colour), however, doesn’t fade. He might be imagining it, though, considering the amount he... likes this one. Castiel takes a second to frown at himself. He’d do better for his own soul refusing to connect with anyone walking in the doors of his prison. He’s learned better, a long time ago.
And whatever his brain may have toyed around with, with improbable dreams — he’s certainly not expecting Dean Winchester.
The latter nods slowly, after a long moment. “You have something in mind.” It is not a question.
, Castiel’s memory tarnished.
But even in his impatience... Dean can’t afford to frighten Castiel. That’s not who he wants to be for the man. Not that he ever wanted to, but especially now, after some twisted psychopath has done God knows what to his lover.
“I want something more.” Because he wasn’t sure, himself. How far he wanted to go. But he was certain that he needed to... become more vocal about this, no matter how many difficulties he had with expressing his desires in general. Emotions, even. He studied Dean’s expression, the look in his own eyes soft yet assertive. “Frankly? I don’t know

Dean sighs. Nuzzles against Cas, if a bit reluctantly. “An hour.”
Dean truly cannot fathom what kind of magical sources Cas is tapping into to restore his patience, but just like that, his demeanour goes back to calm and gentle, as he touches Dean’s shoulder, lightly, before helping his jacket off of him. “I know you don’t like to concern yourself with your own wellbeing,” Cas says, softer, “but I’d appreciate it if you allowed
Dean gives up trying to hide it; a blissful moment he’s consumed by an impromptu fantasy where he still has his hands tied behind his back, with that fucking tie, but he’s naked, and Cas is choking him, gently enough so he can breathe easy, but firmly enough Dean knows
Dean regains his ability to move, at first shaking, still staring at the sight before him, though his vision is getting all the more blurry. Lack of oxygen, tears, it doesn’t matter. His arms, spread and trembling violently, lips parted for a silent, unbreathed scream, still, and it feels like an eternity has passed since he stopped breathing, an eternity, and if it is eternity, that implies it has no end, and he—
; he’s denied himself that, at least in the romantic sense, for so long now. But his love for Cas, it’s going to be there, whether he voices it or not.
, you see, all those lies...”
“What the fuck?”
Dean wants to argue. Wants to tell Cas he owes him
But still, all the times Dean has taken a life (justified or not, it always haunts him), all the times his own has nearly been taken from him...
“I... Dean,” is all Cas can muster up.
“For the love of god, Cas,” Dean interrupts him, tugging him closer by his sleeves because apparently Cas isn’t about to let him sit up, “we are
you get better, and when you start to embarrass me by telling everyone I surprised you with an apartment full of scented candles, I’m not gonna be a pain about it. I will just let you. I mean it, too. No matter how many giggle fits Charlie has at me.”
, just for me?” the human chuckles, his eyes falling shut, as he rests his nose against the crook of Cas’s neck.
“I sent Bobby off for a burger run.”
But Castiel can’t stop himself from gazing at him. Can’t stop his heart from thumping against his ribcage.
“You forget who’s in charge here,” Dean replies with a chuckle but complies to the extent of trailing kisses in between Castiel’s shoulder blades before withdrawing again.
, and he’s not stupid; he knows he can’t, would know even if Cain and Charlie hadn’t given him a lecture about it. But it’s
He isn’t sure where the impulse comes from, but as he straightens himself up again, he doesn’t stop to think – just presses his lips against a tip of a feather, fingers holding it in place. Cas’s grip of his hand tightens at that, and Dean presses his body closer, feeling the both of their heartbeats between their chests.
keep an eye on you, Dean, and I intend to not do my job
Even after Castiel pretty much indicated interest in the man, and then never contacted him.
Right now, though, with Cas fixing his gaze on Dean, his presence on the bed is less comforting, more... well, he’s
“Three hours.”
“Definitely,
Dean nearly drops the mirror he’s holding, he’s in such a rush to set it off his hands. “Hey, too much? What do you need?” he asks, in panic, as he moves to cup Castiel’s face in his hands. “You need me to get you out?”
He’s still a bit hesitant about going forward with this; it still feels like one of his
,” Dean groans. “God, you’re hard work.”
“Unless it is an urgent matter,” he offers, his focus on the man again, “why don’t you stay a while? I specialise in rarities—”
More importantly, there’s something off about the way the Entity keeps circling him, but not touching him.
; that there are no parts of him Dean could consider less than beautiful. “Let
but seeing the Entity use Cas’s form like this… feels like an insult, a joke meant to personally offend him.
“God, you’re beautiful,” he mutters as he lowers himself on the floor again to grab the remaining long piece of the rope. “Do you have any idea... how hot you make me?”
But Cas isn’t satisfied that easily, he never is, and Dean can only really blame himself and his tendency to claim to be fine whenever he really, really is not fine at all.
Like waking up from a long nightmare.
He leans in for a slow kiss. Works Castiel’s shoulder muscles gently, slides his touch along his chest and abdomen, towards the edge of his trousers, his belt. “Colour?” he asks quietly, again, an inch away from Cas’s lips. He just needs to make sure.
Cas’s eyes lowered as his fingers played with the fabric of Dean’s shirt, then his jeans, settling onto his thigh. His head tilted, without him being aware of it.
“Cas, it’s me,” the voice says, all calm and collected, soft and... gentle? “It’s Dean. You’re safe. Hey. You’re all right. Not gonna hurt you. Not gonna let anyone hurt you. It’s just me.”
He takes a longer length of rope. His eyes observing Cas’s wings, from shoulder blade to tip, trying to decide which direction to go with this. “Cas, you sure that me folding your wings won’t make it feel like…
He grips at Cas’s hip roughly as he cries out with a low voice, coming inside Castiel, shaking, shivers running up his spine as he tenses up, then slowly, slowly releases every single knot his muscles were in. His breathing slows and he stays still a while before pulling himself out of Castiel.
Cas shoots him a look. That’s it; he’s done, they are
(over this.)
“You really don’t know that he’s in love with you.”
Cas considered the offer. Still holding Dean’s chin in his grip. If anything, that was probably exactly what he was after. So he let his hand drop from Dean’s face, nodding. “That could be interesting.”
There’re a few minutes of content silence.
; you’re
“Good,” Cas agrees, voice vibrating against Dean’s neck.
, really, all things considering, hindsight, et cetera. But did he have to wait until this particular moment of his life to figure out he likes being tied up? And the situation bears no association to anything traumatic. This is entirely new; a situation founded on safety, on caring, on, well,
Not because of what happened — what they thought happened — six months ago; no, all of them are dead, on paper. Charlie’s made sure of that.
“‘m fine, Cas.” He knows he’s thinking about the possible hex, and this is most definitely
“I am not even going to deny that,” Dean grins as a reply. He stops torturing his angel, though – leans down to really kiss him, now, slow and deep and tender.
Neither of them looks away, as Dean waits for Cas to consider the suggestion.
His heart stops a little as Dean pushes at the doors—
“Uh-huh. Yeah,” is all Dean manages to breathe out; if he’s trying to escape, it’s only to delight in the sensation that he’s unable to. He doesn’t want to get way, doesn’t want to escape Cas, doesn’t want to be let go, in any sense of the phrase.
wings there for anyone to see, unable to keep his wounded parts hidden. If anyone gets that, it’s him. “Just let me...?” He pauses. “Please.”
Cas moans lowly, lifts his hips up.
...” He shakes his head.
, does he also need to be stared at like that, making him feel all...
“Just...” Dean replies, his words coming out with him barely realising he’s saying them, “you too. Take care of yourself, too. While...”
“You’re welcome,” Cas replies, sits Dean down against the huge tree, fixes his trenchcoat Dean’s been wrapped in the past couple hours, to fit around him tighter. “Sleep. I’ll watch over you.”
"S-she took me because
. “Dean, the reason I don’t want you to see my wings is same you wouldn’t want me to see it if you had your legs broken and deformed, scarred by an injury you can’t reverse. That changed you in ways...” He trails off, his eyes hard before he lowers them. “In a word – I would rather you never saw the parts of me I
“Mmm, you’re a
“All right, Dean. Just make yourself comfortable.” Castiel turns to grab a gentle hold of his shoulders as they reach the reading area, guiding him to sit down on the comfiest chair. “I’d offer you a cup of tea, but I’ve unfortunately run out. Sit tight and I’ll at least find you the novel I had in mind.”
“And I’m grateful that you return, every single one of those days.” Cas’s brow knits, his expression gentle. He’s not distressed. He wouldn’t blame Dean, if he bailed out, one of these days. As terrifying as the thought of being so utterly trapped, for who knew how many decades more, alone, is; with the library holding him in some sort of stasis, never once having needed sustenance, for all Cas knew it could be centuries, he doesn’t have it in him to feel bitter.
Stories, he’s found, are usually less kind to their characters, than the real world is. With the exception of people like himself, and the victims of the library, maybe.
But his hand does withdraw.
“It’s cool, you know,” Cas replied after a silence, his eyes wandering lower again. “Taking things faster.”
No. Dean doesn’t want to ask. He wants to
He does get to choose the books he offers the library’s prey, one benefit of the job. And while he’s never been skilled at reading people, while he detests every single story residing in the library, knowing where they came from, he takes comfort in choosing the very best, for their very last.
“You want to ask me if it was all
“I’m an
going to untie you but only for a minute. Be good.”
— that never meant I’d fall for an attempt to shun me away in anger, just to keep me safe.”
Just to see what happens, Dean leans down, as if to kiss his lips, only to stop inches above them. Cas doesn’t disappoint – he lifts his head, letting out a quiet whimper at not quite reaching Dean’s. “Now you’re just deliberately being an asshole.”
“Get down on your knees,” Dean says, gaze fixed on Castiel. And it’s a
But they can’t. Unless Cas, once awake, asks for it, they

"This is my fault." Dean's words come so silently mumbled Cas has trouble making sense of them. "It's not like you'd have

. Fine.” No way he was ever going to win this one, anyway.
A deafening sound of metal against wood tears through Castiel’s mind without any warning, and at first he believes it’s the sheer surprise having his chest tighten; until the sensation stays, until he feels the tug on his arms, his ankles, as well. For a terrifying couple of seconds, he’s unable to draw in breath. His feet stumble, nearly refuse to hold him in balance, and he grabs the front of the counter, being forced backwards. His breaths finally come as gasps as he retreats behind his counter, and then — it’s gone. He spends minutes regrouping himself, hands shaking against the countertop.
A stranger who has, for some incomprehensible reason, shown him more kindness than anyone — ever, as far as Cas can remember.
“I know I can’t exactly... undress you, with you like this, but...” Cas murmurs, lips against Dean’s neck as he slips his hands under his t-shirt, making Dean whimper his approval; he’d like to touch Cas too, only every tug of his hands is stopped by the firm softness of the tie around his wrists, and wanting to touch but being unable to somehow makes the anticipation even better.
Something inside Cas’s heart fills up.
The one time something unexpected happens, the one time there’s an actual spark of hope — and Castiel just let his hope walk away from him.
Dean quirks an eyebrow. “Yeah, I’m convinced.” His smile is very much turning into a grin.
And most of all... He spent so much time grieving the loss of his everything. Turning out, that he never really lost him, that Cas is
He watches Cas sit down on the edge of Dean’s bed - or

Wait. “Di… did you… did you just...” Dean stammers, in panic.
Castiel huffs a sigh. Lifts his head up, a little. “Why? Sam countered the spell. A few days, and I’ll be able to keep them out of sight. You don’t need to see me like this.”
“But we can’t be sure,” Dean slurs. “‘s fine, Cas, it feels good.” It’s not been long enough to be perfectly in the clear, but instead of using that as an excuse, for once, he actually says what he wants: it just
“Think you could do that without, maybe, literally keeping your eyes on me? Like, I know you blink, but
Eyes unblinking, he tests the waters, lifting an arm over the limitations of where his chains allow him to move. But they are still there, unseen, but present, not letting him go. The library glitching enough to leave him time to escape with Dean was probably too far-fetched to hope for, anyway.
Cas licks his lips as he looks, tilts his head and shifts on his feet before nodding.
, so he’d like to stay like this, hex or no hex.

like this is.
Cas tugs against the rope, his breath heavy again. “Green.” He wriggles his hands, testing if he can break free, and Dean watches him take pleasure in knowing he
“OK?” Cas’s turn to ask.
He wets his chapped lips with his tongue. If it was only him, he’d be all right. He’d be peachy. He’s used to bottling up his emotions. But if Cas is really… if Cas is harbouring similar things that Dean has been and they are hurting him? That’s not acceptable, not in Dean’s books.
And hours later, Cas can already predict, Dean will grumble at him for letting him sleep for too long, for not waking him up after the agreed two hours. He doesn’t care; he can keep Dean safe and warm enough, can get the both of them out of the forest sooner or later. Listening to the calming
Fuck.
Cas sighs, pulls him a little closer, trying to warm him up. “You’re freezing,” he notes softly, covering Dean’s hands with his own. He rubs at them to warm them up. Then lets go for a few seconds to be able to strip off of his suit jacket and to lay it over Dean’s hands, over his lap. Quickly hugs him closer again. He’s only wearing a thin shirt himself, now – but he can shut out something as corporeal as cold weather, when he wants to. The cold doesn’t bother him.
must you be for not knowing?”
“No,” he replies, softly. “They don’t hurt. They’re just... there. Like scars.”
At that, Cas finally lifts up his gaze, brows rising in surprise. Dean smiles, his arms crossed.
And then it dawns on him; Michael. He’s free from Michael’s control. Sam, Cas, Jack, Kaia. The spear. Heart racing, he lifts the hem of his shirt, which is oddly intact, to see the cut through his heart. They did it, they stopped the archangel. Killed him, and Dean with him, which is what he
someone else, anyone else, because it’s certainly just Cas that could. Well.
They’ll just need to make do with what they’ve got.
Cas thankfully stops arguing, just lets Dean use the shirt to wipe them both clean enough so that they can take a while snuggling without making more of a mess. “Need water? Anything?” Because he’d get up for that, Castiel not actually requiring drinks, like, ever, irrelevant right now.
“I think we scored a couple of points there,” Dean said as he pulled back slightly. Cas could visualize the smirk on his face before actually opening his eyes to see it. He couldn’t argue at that, though.
“No, no...” Dean tries to force himself on his feet but can’t manage. On all fours, fumbles for any sparkle of hope, terrified, repeating his denial over and over, unable to think, wanting to act instead, but unable to as much as get on his feet. He forces his eyes shut, trying to rid himself of the image before him, but it’s no use; everything is seared into his brain, permanently. And he can’t think properly, can’t find the words, can’t find coherence, but through his haze he knows — he won’t ever forget this.
, because even though he doesn’t sleep, they’ve come to an unspoken understanding on how much less Dean has nightmares when Cas’s weight is there next to him.
He can
Dean huffs an unhappy laugh. “What do you suggest, man? A mattress made of snow? You think I won’t simply freeze to death if we stop moving?”
“That’s not gonna happen anytime soon, I’m afraid,” he teases, the power rush taking over him again. “I
Gentle, firm arms pull Dean onto the carpet on the floor along them. Cas settles them into a comfortable cocoon, grabbing throw pillows and blankets from the easy chairs at arm’s reach. Lips rest against Dean’s forehead.
Trembling hands fumble for his phone, on autopilot. Time loses its meaning, and instead of seconds, he counts the faint sound of Castiel’s breaths (or are they his own? they are so loud), the numbers losing their meaning, as well.
“Yeah, I get it, Cas.” He tries to fish for a softer tone himself, as he opens his eyes. Best case scenario, he’s not even hexed. And if he is, it’s probably easier on them both if he’s restrained when shit starts going down. Cas can take care of himself, but Dean might still get them both hurt, and it’s not worth the risk.
“Whoa, hey. You’re OK. Easy, there.”
, Dean," he sputters, shaking with all the tension he's holding. Needs to get the words out lest they disappear on him again. "
"It should've been me."
Cas raised his eyebrows a fraction of an inch, forcing Dean to shut up.

He trails a few more kisses, and Castiel’s free hand wraps around his waist, loosely holding him close for a moment before wandering up his back to guide him to meet his lips, pulling him by the back of his neck.
to be so endearing? “Are you comfortable enough?”
Before Cas is able to stop himself, his hand searches for Dean’s, closing around his wrist, only to withdraw seconds later, instead of urging him to — resume their proximity? Tell him not to move farther away? Clinging onto the idea of someone being able to stop this cycle?
"Wanna fix it," Dean mumbles, but he's so
A few more, shorter kisses, lips against lips, tongue against tongue, before he trails his tongue down Castiel’s chin, neck, stopping to suck onto his collarbone, which is rewarded by a shaky moan, and, OK, he’s done with his self-restraint now, thanks; Dean’s kisses turn more needy, sloppy, rough, his hands stroking Cas’s sides, fingernails trailing lightly along them at times, moving down towards abdomen with his lips, thighs with his fingers.
“Cas, when was the last time I said no to you?”
“I’m… good. Bit ow, but that’s what you get from being impaled with an archangel-killing spear, I guess,” Dean slurs as a reply. “I’m good, Cas. I’m good.”
