, Cas!” Dean threw his hands up. At this point, he wasn't sure why he even bothered putting on a macho bravado.
When Sam looked away Dean locked eyes with Cas and silently pleaded for him to turn it off. The plug oscillated even faster and the faint buzzing sound it made was suddenly audible in the quiet room.
Dean carefully moved Cas’ arm away and slid out of the bed. He picked up an extra pillow to cover his junk – because who has time to put on pants when your brother is about to smash his way into your motel room? - and went to crack open the door.
you.'
Apparently, his subconscious had been aware of the hunter's flirtations the whole time and had been trying to clue him in.
“Really? That kinda sounds like a cliché plot to an extremely bad movie,” Miguel laughed when Sam had finished. “I mean, no offense, you guys seemed a little tipsy maybe, but I wouldn't have guessed you were roofied or anything.”
that he understood Dean was giving him
Something clicks into place.
“Fuck, Dean,” Cas moaned as Dean hit the spot again.
“I’m a quick learner,” Cas answered, his mouth so close, Dean felt the heat from his breath on his shift.
Cas sat up and growled at the hunter. "What's my name?" He thrust his fingers in, down to the last knuckles and used two fingers on his other hand to twist at each of Dean's nipples. "Say my name, bitch."
“I. Will. Not,” Cas emphasized each word with a thrust, “fuck you in a filthy restroom.”
Sam, Kevin and Charlie returned to the bunker shortly after and immediately turned around to leave again upon hearing the couple once more in the throes of passion. Unfortunately, they didn't get out quick enough and were subjected to Dean loudly declaring his love for the former angel as he climaxed.
“It is ready, Dean. I've been up for hours.”
Cas wasted no time straddling Dean once again. With the denim that had been restricting his movement before gone, he thrust his hips more spiritedly and mimicked the moves he learned at the strip club. It wasn't overly graceful and he didn't seem to know what to do with his hands, but Dean was obviously enjoying it.
“Okay, so I guess we're going back to the motel then.” Sam sighed and started to walk to the Impala.
“That so?” Dean asked, sitting back in his seat. “Gotta say, you do the whole 'just deserts' thing better than your brother, but it's still torture.”
Dean takes the offered drink because he needs the caffeine but keeps up his interrogation. "What kind of buildings, Cas?"
“You said something at the gas station earlier and I wondered if you meant it.”
Dean narrowed his eyes at the blatant lie. “There's stories about me and Cas now?”
“God no,” Sam responded, realizing a moment too late the girl was flirting with him. “I mean, angels are more my brother's fetish, not mine.” He pointed to Dean, who was looking quite disgusted with the whole interaction, and the girl gave him a once over before returning her full attention back to Sam.
“Oh. If it eases your concern, Dean, I believe we purchased the rubber penises, along with several other oddly named items last night,” Cas said nonchalantly.
Dean nearly chokes on a deep moan escaping his throat entirely without his permission. Cas has his big strong hand on Dean’s thigh, gripping the meat of it. His leg stills instantly and he can’t help but look him right in the eye. Surprise and arousal fighting for dominance on his face. Cas’ pupils explode and nearly obliterate the blue in his eyes as Dean watches him take a shaky breath. Dean swallows down his pie in in slow deliberate movement, trying to calm his breathing. His heart is beating so fast he is sure everyone can hear it. Cas’ hand doesn’t move and Dean feels the blood drain from his flushed cheeks heading south so fast he feels a little light headed. He is still staring at Cas when he licks his lips.
"Hello Dean…. Sam," said Cas in his usual gruff voice looking between the two tense hunters. Sam turned to face the Angel, sighing at the interruption. He thought about asking Cas to leave and come back later, but then he remembered that Cas was in Purgatory too. He could ask Cas about Dean and Benny if he got a chance. Maybe the Angel would tell him something Dean hadn't.
being.
“Nothing. I don’t want to talk about it.” Dean’s mask slips back on and he closes himself off again with a practiced ease.
“Yeah, that thing.” Dean blushes.
Shit.
“A demon is a human soul, twisted and corrupted by its time in Hell. Father Thomson believed that you could wash that taint away and restore their humanity.” He says in his raspy voice.
“Okay, so the line got kinked, but you said Gabriel stepped in and patched it up?” Dean tries.
The drive back had mostly been spent trying to make sense of everything and failed attempts at getting Dean to talk about Benny. He couldn't get him to stop talking about Porcha and James, though, and his head was hurting.
“CAS?” Sam’s voice reached a level of squeaky he didn’t know was possible.
Mary takes in Castiel and smiles at the Angel. “Well look at you! You look like a rock star!” She has come to think of Castiel as one of her boys but seeing the man decked out in nothing but skin tight fabric is a little distracting- she is only human.
Dean cringes when Cas calls him beautiful but smiles when he realizes that he wasn’t the only jealous one “Two things Sunshine- I’m not beautiful, I’m handsome, or hot. Either one works. I’m a dude.” That earns him an eye roll from Cas that screams “I have had your dick in me- so I got that memo”. Dean gets a little distracted at that thought and coughs to clears his mind. “Second- I was going to beat that Abercrombie douche bag up if he so much as looked at you again, I haven’t felt that kind of rage since the Mark- so you’re not alone there. That’s jealousy for you, it ain't pretty but sometimes you can’t help it”
Cas looks at the teenager, something about him seems very familiar.
I might even get to a third, have had a slow day at the hospital and if I get off soon I might be able to finish another. This is all very un-edited so I apologize for any errors!
“Cas, she almost got you killed! I can’t just get over that!” Dean almost shouted as he turned to face Castiel. His face was plaintive, begging Castiel to understand that Dean needed to keep those he cared about, his family, safe.
"Yeah, let's get this done, Sabrina" Dean's clearly still not letting the thing with the spell go.
He still loved Amelia; Dean

He just keeps adding questions to his ever-growing list.
He takes a deep breath and looks at Charlie's confused face “It was a nice thought. The thought of people just looking and knowing that we were
They spend the day interviewing people and meet up at a local bar for dinner to compare notes. Sam already has drinks ordered for them when Dean and Mary walk up to join them.
One thing he is clear on- he’s pissed.
. She had no doubt that if Castiel had happened to inhabit someone other than Jimmy- that they would still have belonged. It was deeper than flesh. And that made it kinda beautiful.
"What are you thinking about?" he asks when he notices Sam's pensive face.
Sam dreams.
Sam had been living with Dean for pretty much his whole life. And he shared a room with him for most of that time. They had suffered through nightmares, sleepless nights, food poisoning and worse still- wet dreams a few feet from each other. So, they had built up tolerances most people couldn’t dream of, they had come up with creative ways to give each other privacy and space.
“What about her?” Dean asks starting to get over the system-wide shock of

he thinks and squeezes Cas to him a little tighter.
“Well you
He wakes up after the standard Winchester four hours and feels more rested than he had in a very long time. He stretches out his spine and rubs at his eyes until he can read the digital alarm clock next to his bed. Six thirty. He figures he can grab a quick shower and then maybe make some breakfast for his family.
"I am not able to restore you completely; whatever ails you is not natural," Cas said, feeling worried that even the excessive application of grace had not purged the rot from Dean's body.
He missed his chance didn’t he. He was too chicken shit to make a move and Cas found someone.
I didn't die or run off to join the circus. Just life... shrugs.
“Babe, I need you. Come on.” Dean pants out biting his full bottom lip.
They barely hit the bed and Cas is pulling his cotton pajama pants off. He hikes Deans legs up and spreads them. The silver plug is moving in and out ever so slightly - as Dean’s rim clenches and release in anticipation of Cas’ thick cock.
Cas follows Dean to the kitchen. They do this often. Even before they started being
“No- thanks tho, Babe. Come with me to the kitchen and I’ll make us some sandwiches?” Dean offers instead.
for Dean. No one else could fit into their life so effortlessly and be such an asset. Cas literally put Dean back together after Hell- there was nothing he didn’t know about Dean and he still worshiped the ground he walked on. Dean deserved that. He had spent his whole life putting everyone else first. He gave up every chance at a normal life to take care of Sam and save strangers who never even knew. Dean was a friggin’

had a raging boner. He leaned over, grabbing the bed sheet and pulled it up to cover the sleeping man's erection. Not that the obvious tent the sheet made over Cas' length did much to hide the situation. Dean was unable to stop from noticing his friend was a little bigger than him and
Cas didn't seem to notice that he had broken out of the handcuffs, but Dean guessed by the uninhibited moans coming from the former angel that he was too far gone to care about anything other than the ecstasy he was in.

And why he keeps catching them in the middle of whispered conversations.
the hunter's balls. "They gave me so many ideas. I procured the items from an adult store while you were on a supply run last week."
Dean looked up at him amused. “What's the rush?”
“Yeah. Okay.” Dean deflated after a few moments, finally managing to compose himself. He knew he was overreacting; it wasn't all that painful, but he was tired and irritable and kind of liked having Cas coddle him. “Do it.”
wasn't wondering what it would be like to run his hands over said hipbones - in a completely platonic way - when out of nowhere, someone slapped him in the back of the head.
Dean grabbed another bottle of water from the minifridge and settled back down on the bed. He was burning up and his shirt stuck uncomfortably to his sweaty back. “I don't know. I remember leaving the motel last night,” he said, taking a few drinks before handing the bottle over to Cas, who gratefully accepted.
“Is that also why you pushed me away when I kissed you?” Cas seems to steel himself for the answer.
"Not yet, Dean,” the former angel responded, shaking his head. “I have to put more oil on it."
"What was that about?" Kevin asked when he took his seat in the booth.
“Alright,” Cas replied. “I don't see what the problem is though. We've seen each other nude on many occasions, and you didn't appear bothered by my form when we were at the hotel.” Cas closed the bathroom door and Dean heard the water turn on.
'They're way too happy right now to care,' the woman holding the camera, who Dean assumed was Mia, responded. 'Some luck we have, huh? We meet couple of gorgeous guys and they turn out to be closet cases completely in love with each other.'
“I'm ready,” Dean said eagerly. Not that he didn't appreciate Cas' concern with making sure he was properly prepared, but his whole day had been leading up to this part and he was more than ready to get on with it. “Need to feel you in me.”
“Dean!” Charlie exclaimed in an excited tone. “That was Dean. I read it.”
Cas regretted that he didn't get to taste Dean's, but decided it would be something to look forward to. That is if Dean would be willing to do it again. He wanted to ask what it meant for them, for their friendship, but they had a long drive the next day and it was already after three in the morning.
Sam led them to an Oldsmobile he hotwired and drove them back to the motel. It was already after three in the afternoon so while Dean and Cas were taking showers he went out to pick up lunch.
Dean forces himself to stand upright, abandoning the safety of his chair support. The medication he was prescribed at the emergency clinic is making him drowsy, but he hasn't thrown up in at least two hours, so that's good enough for him. There's no way he’s sitting at home while his brother and a newly human Castiel work a case without him.
Dean put his hands down and scoffed. "
Pound. Pound. Pound.
“Seriously?” Charlie asked and let her shoulders relax a little.
"Take me in your mouth."
“No, Cas,” Dean forced himself to say. “That was just for you. But we can continue this later, if you want.”
“It was from that adult store in Tampa,” Cas explained and Dean could practically hear the 'duh' in his voice.
"I thought I'd conserve my energy for
"I thought you were going to be a good patient for me, Mr. Winchester." Cas opened the lube and
Sam's eyes went to the pillow Dean was holding over his crotch and made a face. “You could've at least put on clothes.”
Before Dean could get to the gun however, the creature knocked him back again. He went down hard, hitting the concrete floor and hissed at the pain. That was going to bruise. The thing rounded on him again, blocking the path to his weapon. Dean slid away, looking for anything he could use to kill it, or at least hold it off until the other two
He closes the news tab and spends the next few hours searching for information on love curses and counter spells. The other occupants of the bunker assume he’s researching for a case and mostly leave him to it. Cas wanders in a couple of times and offers assistance but Dean turns him away. He decides not to confront his brother and friend about it directly. If he manages to neutralize the spell without them knowing they’ve been under a magical influence, they'll be able to chalk the past few days up to being a crazy fling and move on. Then, hopefully, things will get back to normal.
Cas nodded his consent and put his hands on Dean's shoulders. Dean grinned up at him then leaned forward to place his mouth over the skin and gently trailed kisses around the sigils. Cas let out a shuddered gasped and moaned Dean's name.
Sam’s door opens before he even has a chance to knock.
Dean pulled back and locked eyes with the man under him. “Am I meeting your standards?” Cas looked down at the large bulge in his jeans and gave Dean a what-the-fuck-do-you-think glare.
“It's just a thing,” she said, waving off an explanation. “So, Dean, I'd ask what's new with you but I think Sam filled me in on everything. Speaking of which, where's that dreamy angel of yours?”
Cas pushes the door open enough to step in and close it behind him. “I’m sorry, but I was hoping we could talk.”
“So do you, Dean,” Cas replied breathless. “Amazing.”
“Good.” Cas patted him on the leg and moved over the hunter again. “I'm going to take my time,” he purred in Dean's ear. “And you don't get to come until I tell you to.”
“Hello, Dean," he said, getting to his feet. "What do you want?"
“Damn, I must be good,” Dean said, still grinning smugly.
Dean hummed around Cas' muscle and heard him choke back a noise as he pushed himself deeper. When Cas' cock hit the back of his throat, Dean gagged slightly and his eyes watered, but he didn't try to move away. Cas pulled back quickly before plunging in again and this time Dean swallowed around the head when it hit his throat.
, but there was no other sufficient word for it. “It wasn’t.”
“This okay?” Dean asked, hoping he didn't get ahead of himself by starting out with two fingers.
He stretched his limbs before climbing out of bed and putting on his bathrobe. His foot was a little sore, but he barely noticed as he made his way to the dresser. His eyes widened in shock when he pulled open his underwear drawer and found it empty except for the pink zebra print panties he hadn't seen since Tampa, an extra large butt-plug, and a small tube of lube. Laying under the plug was a note written in Castiel's perfect script, instructing him to put the plug in and wear the panties the rest of the day.
“I've noticed,” Cas responded, his tone cryptic. He continued inspecting the various items on the shelves, paying very little attention to Dean; who followed him anyway. When Cas got to a section with nothing but vibrators and dildos, he stopped to admire the multitude of colors and sizes. Dean watched and couldn't decide if he was amused or disturbed (or excited) by his friend's apparent fascination with phallic objects. He wondered if Cas even knew what they were used for and thought about explaining just to see how he would react.
Cas held up a set of nipple claps to happily show the hunter. “This is the last of it,” he said and began to open the packages with his knife. “Charlie helped me pick out the items."
“Come on, we both know you love it,” Sam responded and started to sing along.
Dean bit at his bottom lip as Cas moved the panties out of the way and took his aching length in his mouth. Dean moaned loudly when the wet heat surrounded him and he cursed under his breath.
. Punish me however you want."
Dean pushes through the motel door and stomps inside the dimly lit room. Peeling off his rain and mud-soaked jacket he tosses it in the general direction of the bed. It misses its target and falls to the grimy shag carpet - because that's the sort of shitty night he’s having. He doesn’t bother turning around when he hears the door close behind him. It‘s not slammed shut
“Dean!”
Unless, of course, that’s the reason they’re keeping it a secret.
Cas avoided Dean's gaze by staring out the window. They sat in uneasy silence for several minutes while Sam drove them to the only other place they knew for sure they have gone the night before.
“So you
"This is the best birthday I've had in a long time," Dean said through half chewed bites of cherry pie; spraying
Cas' gaze traveled over the hunter's body, spread naked and hard in front of him and Dean didn't miss the pure want in his eyes before he shook his head. “I'm glad to hear that, and I will hold you to it next time, but I have already prepared myself for you.”
“Only the things those
Cas smiled at him with wet swollen lips. “Would you like me to continue?”
He had barely swallowed the last drops of his bottle when he heard the squeaking sound of the bunker's metal door opening.
“They’re baby rabbits, Dean,” Cas answers.
All three men groaned in response and made their way to each of their rooms to get some much needed rest.
Cas shrugged.
Castiel sat across from Dean watching as he shoveled bite after bite into his mouth and seemed utterly unfazed by the older Winchester's rude
too, if you want.”
“Alright, alright,” Dean conceded. “Dear Castiel, will please fuck me into this mattress. Amen.”
Cas draws his fingers out slowly and brings his hand down to join the other on Dean’s cock. Slick fingers trail over the leaking slit, then lower to tease his balls. He doesn’t have time to be embarrassed by the shriek he lets out when those fingers move behind his balls to press into his perineum, because suddenly, they are at his hole and Dean’s legs spread wider on instinct. Cas seems pleased - and very aroused - by his response and brings his hips forward to rut eagerly against Dean’s thigh as he pushes a single digit past the tight ring of muscle. Dean’s cock pulses when he’s breached and Cas either senses that he’s getting close or he’s too distracted
“I can't believe you did that,” Cas panted. “I thought you weren't ready?”
"Oh, yeah?" Dean responded, bucking back to meet each of Cas' thrusts.
“Well, you should have thought about that before you went and had sex with the guy,” Sam replied, raising his voice. A few curious patrons at the table next to them turned to look in their direction.
"So, Dean," Sam said, glancing sideways at his brother. "How'd your big plan go?"
Dean let out a breath and small laugh. “For now,” he answered. “You're driving me crazy with that thing,” he gestured to the small remote control the angel held. “Probably gonna have a boner all day.”
"We saw those guys watching you the whole time you two were at the bar," Kevin answered. "When you got up we saw them follow and figured they were looking for a fight."
Dean reached under and slowly eased the plug out. Cas' let out a shuddered breath and Dean's cock twitched when he imagined how it was going to feel sliding in and out of the tight hole. Dean set the plug aside and squirted a generous amount of lube on his fingers, leaving more than enough for his cock. He rubbed the slick liquid around Cas' entrance, teasing the already wet hole before pushing in two fingers. Cas groaned and held on to Dean's shoulders for support.
your boyfriend, right? I mean, unless you guys have been holding out on me.”
“Yes,” Dean answered a few octaves higher than normal. He cleared his throat and tried to sound more convincing. “Don't worry about it. It’s my problem.” He caught a brief glimpse of the concerned surprise on Sam's face just as he shut the door.
Cas' wardrobe was proving to be an unexpected challenge however. Now that he traded in the ever-present suit and trench coat of his angel days for hand-me-down jeans and t-shirts, Cas had become accustomed to his new unkempt, casual look and was in no mood to change.
“I don’t pine.”
Several moments passed and Cas was beginning to think Dean had fallen asleep when the hunter finally replied.

He smiled and ran a hand through his hair, which was slightly tangled from sleep. He couldn’t believe his brother had
A wide grin spread across Dean's face as he caught the shirt mid-air. 'Show 'em how it's done ladies.'
“No, we need to see if something inside jogs our memory.”
“Why did you do that?” Cas asked.

“Oh look, it’s Elmer Fudd,” Kevin says sneer.
“That we don't have to deal with all of the
“Cas!” Dean snapped. “I'll let you watch all the kinky fetish porn you want if you just stop talking about it right now. We need to go find my goddamn car.”
“He's kidding,” Sam said and bitchfaced Dean, who was now muttering "Cristo" under his breath. The girls may have poor judgment and questionable morals, but they weren't demons. He was just thankful they hadn't poked around and opened the truck while the car was in their possession. “It's been a confusing day, no thanks to you.”
"Time to go, Cas. You can play Candy Crush later," Kevin said, snatching his phone away from the inebriated former angel, who in turn growled at the prophet.
“Alright, no funny business,” Dean said once Cas had settled in. “Don't go grabbin' my dick in the middle of the night.”
“I did not,” Dean scoffed. “You're just being
Cas continued rinsing soap from the plates and gently swaying his hips, now moving Dean's along with him. The hunter leaned in to the movement and rested his chin on Cas' shoulder, breathing in the sweet fragrance of the fruity shampoo the former angel used and the
“Sorry, Cas,” he muttered.
“It no longer matters, Dean,” Cas said quietly. “Naomi is dead and since I have no recollection of what memories she took or why, I can't miss them. Would you like to continue?”
"You're
“Yes.” Cas sat up on his elbow and gestured at the nipple clamps. “Try to remember that when I take those off.”
"Nothing," Dean answered sliding in next to Cas. "Just some drunk dickbags."
) shirt. Cas started to whine in protest when Dean moved his hand away from his crotch, but Dean put an end to it by sucking on his tongue. When the last button was open, he moved to kiss along Cas' collarbone, then down to bite at his nipples. Cas sucked in a ragged breath and arched his back when Dean flicked his tongue over the sensitive area. Dean got to his knees as he kissed his way lower until he was at eye level with Cas' prominent bulge. He glanced up at the former angel who was looking down at him through thick dark lashes, his cheeks flushed and breathing heavy. “This okay?”
“Might not be so bad,” Dean mused and licked a wet stripe up the shaft. He fit his lips over and slid down. The solid feeling of a dick in his mouth was still new and a little strange, but he knew he'd get used to it and he already loved the way he could reduce Cas to a whimpering mess with just his mouth. He glided his tongue around the crown and plunged back down. He risked going deeper with each slide of his lips until Cas' cock hit the back of his throat. He managed to keep from gagging, but decided he'd need more practice before he could deep throat. He pulled off and smirked up at the other man.
“This is different,” Dean said and sounded more like he was trying to convince himself rather than Cas. “Illegal substances were involved. It doesn't count.”
“No,” Cas responded. “I'm going to do as you asked while you drive me into town.”
Dean grabbed Cas' hand and brought it to his bulge in response. "You sure about this, Cas?" Dean asked, sounding a little reluctant, but pressing himself into the ex-angel's hand nonetheless.
His brother really was a complete and total idiot.
Cas pushed him back a little before it could get too far and untangled their legs. “We will continue this later,” Cas said, much more composed than a guy with a hard-on and blown pupils should be. “I need you to take me into town today.”
“Maybe. It's weird as hell,” Dean answered quietly. “I don't know if I can do...that.”
Leaning as far out of the car as he can manage to avoid splashing vomit on Baby’s paint, he spits out the last of the bile. Movement off to the side catches his attention and he sees an older woman walking by with a foam cup in her hand. She spares him one disgusted glance as she continues to the semi-truck and climbs in the cab. Dean doesn’t care enough to feel ashamed.
“Hmm, I like the sound of that.” Dean hummed in approval as Cas started to remove his own pants. “Does that make me
and you're telling me you haven't noticed?"
Dean sighed. “I don't just mean with me. I mean with everything. Being human and all that.”
Dean looked around the lot again.
He silently creeps close to Sam’s room and can hear their voices coming through the vent on the door, talking softly. He can’t make out what’s being said at first, but then Sam is laughing quietly and saying Cas’ name with such affection it makes Dean feel like he’s been gutted - and he was literally disemboweled in Hell - as the shred of hope he had left is crushed.
“No, we need information,” Cas spoke up, not waiting for the Winchesters to respond. He was rarely allowed to do more than observe interviews during hunts and took the initiative to practice improving his "people skills". “Tell us everything you remember about our visit here last night.”
"Whatever jerk. I wasn't the one watching the guy undress." Sam laughed and made his way to his own bedroom to change into something a little less hunter-y. He didn't like Dean's idea for "cheering" Cas up, but at the same time, he was fairly certain there was only one way the evening was going to go - and he wouldn't dare miss it. Sam sincerely hoped that his idiot brother and their formerly angelic friend would finally get their shit together. The perpetual sexual tension was driving him insane.
“Oh,” Cas said, understanding. “It has been difficult, but I'm trying. You have helped me immensely. Why do you ask?”
“Cas, I told you to quit apologizing for everything,” Dean said, silencing the other man. “Besides, not like I can judge you since I...” Dean held up his fist and quickly moved it back and forth a few times. Cas made a face at the lewd gesture and Dean laughed. “I didn't mean for you to hear that earlier. I kinda got carried away.”
This work is unbetaed so please forgive any mistakes.
not having.
“Seriously you guys?” Sam scoffed. “We're eating.”
"We should really get some sleep," Dean said and pulled one corner of the bed sheet up to wipe away the drying semen from both of them.
“Torture?," Cas chuckled. "And you accuse me of being melodramatic,” Cas responded with a small laugh. “Are we leaving soon or do you plan for us to sit here all day?”
They don’t pull apart until Sam comes in a while later and kicks them out for traumatizing the baby bunnies.
It’s still early enough that the bunker is quiet when he returns and he’s able to make it to the kitchen without running into anyone. He starts the coffee machine and leans against the counter while he waits for it to heat up.
"Sorry," Kevin muttered swinging his door open. "It feels like forever since I've been anywhere near civilization."
“That'll be me,” Kevin announced, contradicting what was happening in the game. “Or not,” he added a moment later when Cas landed another blow and his character KOed.
“I don't know.”
. Cas!"
Dean followed Castiel back to their bedroom. The former angel had promised that he was in for a treat and Dean's cock
Charlie repeated everything the younger Winchester had shared and Dean filled her in on the rest, only leaving out the more intimate details.
Dean frowned and shifted again. “Okay, I get it,” he said and moved his foot under the table to discreetly rub against Cas' leg. “I don't wanna fight. Will you stop being pissed at me if I apologize when she comes back with the check?”
“So where'd they go then?” Dean asked, feeling both relieved that nobody was in danger and turned on that Cas had planned the whole thing.
"If you're talking about the bullshit with the crypt and angel tablet, it's fine. Cas and I are good. So if you wanna go have a nice girl chat with the dude and play My Little Pony be my guest, Samantha, but this is how I'm going to help him."
There’s a pregnant pause, then Cas asks, “Did you really think that Sam and I were in an amorous relationship?”
"I'm so glad to hear that," Cas smiled. "You're so compliant. And
“Of course,” she said and grinned smugly. “It should be a piece of cake as long as you haven't deleted the internet history on your phone.”
Sam cleared his throat. “I can come back later if you two want more alone time.”
“Who you texting? Better not be about me,” Dean said, trying to see the screen.
They held each other for a while, hands
Cas frowned and looked at Sam - who simply shrugged unhelpfully and held out his hand for Cas' controller. “Very well.”
“You wanna get in the backseat?” Dean asked when the other man began to work open his belt buckle.
“We waited too long already.” Cas immediately threw his arms around Dean, crushing their mouths together. Dean responded hungrily and moved them towards the bed. He wasn't expecting it when Cas flipped their positions and pushed him back onto the mattress. Cas climbed on the bed and wasted no time stripping them both of their shirts. He ran his palms over the toned muscles of Dean's chest and bent down to suck on the skin over his heart briefly before moving on to run his tongue over the anti-possession tattoo. Dean shuddered at the feeling and moaned when Cas' mouth moved down to one of his nipples, copying what the hunter had done to him a few hours before. Dean had never cared much for nipple play, but the sensation of Cas' lips mixed with the slight scratch from his stubble – because the lazy bastard refused to shave regularly – and the damn ex-angel was already turning him into a writhing mess. He was so lost in the feeling of it that he didn't notice Cas had managed to unbutton his pants until they were being pulled away from his body.
"I hav' ta urinate," Cas whispered close to Dean, like it was a shameful secret.
“It doesn't matter.” Dean gave his friend a fleeting glance. “How would you feel?”
Cas gripped Dean’s shoulder and moved the other down between them, wrapping his own hand around Dean’s and they worked together. Dean leaned forward, capturing Cas’ mouth again as they each thrust into their combined palms. He bit down on Cas’ bottom lip, sucking it into his mouth and loved the way the ex-angel moaned and bucked his hips.
Dean grinned. "Hey, can't a guy love sex and pie equally?"
Well, if
“I'm fine with whatever you want, Dean.” Cas answered.
. "We don't have the necessary ingredients, though, so I'll need to go into town tomorrow and pick up a few things."
Dean led Cas back to his bedroom and true to her word, Charlie was nowhere in sight. She had however found the bottle of Astroglide he kept in his nightstand and placed it conspicuously in the center of the bed. Dean managed to grab it and place it back in the drawer before Cas could see it.
They decided to stop at a department store first so Cas could pick out a few new clothes. Dean was noticing a slight addition of color to the former angel's wardrobe, although he still seemed to prefer things that were dark (and a little tight, but that was
To Dean's relief, his brother made no attempt to turn the music up again. “How the hell do you not feel like shit, Cas?” Dean asked, half turning in his set to look at the man behind him.
“Yes, but Kevin actually likes the rabbits.”
“I think we have everything,” Sam responded.
“What did you do, Sam?” Dean asked.
Dean wrapped his hand around Cas' leaking cock and pumped it a few times, hoping the pleasure would help Cas through the initial burn of being filled up. It seemed to have worked because Cas finally started moving, going up and down in slow sallow thrusts.
He lowered himself down on the hard mattress of the motel bed and tried to process everything that happened. That had been the longest discussion he'd had with the former angel months, and certainly one of the only chats they've ever had regarding
“I've noticed,” he responded and turned his head to look at her. “You're only into women, right? Never been attracted to men?”
a reason to have kinky sex?"
gentleman.
They lay stuck together for several minutes until Cas pulled his hand out and wiped it on a dry part of Dean's boxer shorts. “Did I sufficiently make it up to you?”
pulled his fingers out. Picking up the bottle of lube again, he poured some into his palm and stroked his cock with the slippery liquid. He wiped his hand off on the bed sheets, spread Dean's legs open further and guided himself to Dean's entrance. He pushed in slowly,
pie was better, it just was.
Dean rolled his eyes. Seriously, what the fuck was up with people in Florida?
Cas’ turns to meet his gaze with a gummy smile. “Are you sure?”
They're both good friends.
,” Dean responds. “And if you wanna keep bullshitting me, fine, but stop acting like I’m the dick here.”
“Yes,” Cas said. “There's usually more screaming and fleeing involved. On the rare occasion, someone will plunge a knife through my heart.”
“I believe so,” Cas responded calmly, taking a hesitant step closer to the foul smelling creature. The thing was slumped over a large metal fork protruding from its scaly abdomen, nearly cutting it in half. Slimy liquid oozed from the body, pooling on the floor under it. “It doesn't appear to be breathing.”
He grasps Cas’ hips while fervently bobbing his head back and forth, swirling his tongue around the girth. It isn’t long before Cas is gripping his hair tighter and pushing forward, demanding to thrust in deeper. Dean eases his hold, granting Cas control and slides his palms around to grope the globes of Cas’ ass. Cas moans obscenely when the tip of his cock hits the back of the hunter’s throat and Dean swallows around the head to evoke more of the pornographic sounds while the angel fucks his mouth. Soon, Cas’ thrusting turns erratic as his movements speed up and Dean prepares to feel the flood of release at any moment.
“Okay, okay,” Dean holds up a hand to stop his brother from carrying on with his sales pitch. “I get it. They can stay.”
Dean shrugged. "Works for me."
“Very little,” Cas answered as he and Sam came to stand next to Dean.
“Dean, this creature just killed two people,” Cas reminded the hunter. “I don't think any form of
“No, you can’t.” Cas sounds horrified. “They’re domesticated, not wild rabbits.”
'That's my fault,' Dean said and rocked their hips together. 'I've been running from my feelings for so long. I was scared, Cas. Didn't wanna admit how much I've wanted
Cas leaned in close, his chest pressed against Dean's arm. "Are those men hunters?"
Sam’s voice carries into the library where Dean is searching for a case on his laptop. Heavy footsteps prelude Sam’s arrival and he stomps through the doorway in a hissy. His shirt is soaked and water drips from his hair and face.
The second recording was shot outside of a building they recognized as the Rainbow Cabaret.
Dean still feels betrayed, but it’s his own fault for assuming Cas would wait around forever. If he had accepted himself sooner and acted on his feelings, then maybe he wouldn’t have lost him.
“No?” Dean repeated. This wasn't going to be as easy as all those stupid rom-coms Sam liked to watch made it seem. “C'mon, Cas, I know this is weird, but you gotta be honest with me. What happened to all that 'I'm not ashamed' stuff you said?”
With a defeated sigh he pulls the keys from the ignition and climbs out of the car. He sidesteps the pile of sick near the back door and squats down to collect his garbage. When he’s finished, he tosses everything in a dumpster next to the station, then heads inside the store to relieve his bladder.
Cas pulled his hand away and a moment later the plug stopped moving. “I was teaching you a lesson about taking things that don't belong to you,” he said matter-of-factly and held up the small control to emphasize his point.
Whatever argument he had died on Castiel's lips and was replaced with a deep moan as Dean's mouth quickly brought him to full hardness. Dean, for his part, took great pride in being able to elicit such porn-esque quality sounds from the once uptight former angel - and he had only just started.
Strong arms reach out to steady him and he wants to cry. Cas.
“Um, yeah. Since we couldn’t exactly do it the way
“Later, there was a girl, a hunter, Eileen. They tried to make it work in our world. She died a while back. I don’t think Sam’s over her.”
. Dean makes pancakes or sandwiches and they share a drink or two.
“I guess I figured that would change somewhere along the way” he looks down at his mug.
Heading down the hall in his running shorts, he detoured on his way to the kitchen. Going to the library instead when he saw the lights were on. It was probably Castiel, and he'd check in with him, let him know about Missouri, so he didn't accidentally smite her.
“How long?”
“She rolled her eyes and called me a big softie. So- you know- that’s like equivalent to your squeal of joy when I told you” Dean smiled remembering the conversation he had with his kinda-step daughter.
“What happened? Chuck? I mean I’ve been praying but I didn’t think he’d hear or care. Did you see him?” Sam keeps talking- he is clearly a little overwhelmed himself.
He never slams the car door.
Dean moans, he feels the precome leaking down his cock and he is so past caring that he starts begging for it “Cas…Cas, please. Please. I need you. I need your cock. Give it to me. Baby, I need you inside.”
She gives them each a stern suspicious look before looking up at Sam again “What’s this about?”
His subconscious helpfully offers up a memory of himself picking Ruby over Dean, and he pushes down the guilt. That was different- she was feeding him demon juice; he wasn't himself, besides he did it to help Dean.
They finished up their errands and got back in the Impala and headed for the Bunker. Charlie insisting on blasting music from her iPod that she was sure Dean would love all the way home.
“How are you doing, Dean?” Cas asks, and his mouth pulls into that almost smile he gives Dean sometimes. That soft look -directed at him-makes him feel like he does when he pushes Baby over one of the hills outside of town. That split second when they catch air, and he’s weightless.
-----------------------------------------------------
Cas captures his mouth in a searing kiss that leaves his bottom lip thoroughly swollen and tingly.
. What's that saying about tables turning?
"He does, and I'm going to make sure he gets to go back. If it's the last thing, I do." Dean grits his teeth and turns away from the demon again to complete his last sigil.
though-
“You… didn’t mean muddy dirty, did you?” Sam asks feeling unnerved as he thinks back to the party. And the guy in the hallway
Less than 15 minutes later Eileen pulls up in her Toyota and parks behind the Impala. Sam hugs her a little too long and Mary gives him the quirked eyebrow before embracing the hunter in her own greeting. He sets his laptop up on the trunk next to Eileen’s Surface and fills her in on what happened.
After spending a few hours calling around, looking up books in the archive, and reading a lot of weird stuff on the internet, Sam calls it a night.
"Ellie," Cas says, putting the rag down.
The priest is the only person there this time of day, and that works out just fine. They tell them who they are and what they saw.
“Yeah I’d say. I was there to hear Kevin recount it in graphic detail remember?” she laughs a little at the memory of the sputtering kid running back up to the library. He’d walked in on Dean sucking Cas off in the Impala and acted like it physically caused him pain. Sam eventually threatened to stab him if he kept up with the descriptions.
The man looks down at the woman and sees her swollen belly. "We shall burn her." He says to the crowd with conviction.
What if yellow eyes had left him alone? Would Mary and John be sitting on the porch drinking Arnold Palmers, maybe talking about Sam out in California? Wondering when they’d see Dean and the grandkids again?
what he would expect from Dean.
"You want to go to my room and have sex?" she propositions him.
“Hey, Cas. Almost made it to the door like a civilized person.” Dean teases as he watches him descend.
"I don't usually do this." She says, whispering seductively.
With some help they had figured out that she was trying to complete a summoning ritual. Some ancient Egyptian god Hathor who demanded “a tribute of love” for any of the favors she could bestow- one of which was music. The witch wanted to win
The case had been a doozy, James, their cop-turned-witch friend, had been set up by one of his own, and they'd almost caught on too late. James' familiar was a beautiful woman who liked to take the shape of a large Doberman, and her relationship with James had seemed endlessly fascinating to Dean.
But this…
“I don’t know- so you can do your thing? “Sam mumbled.
It was hard keeping his distance all these years but now that he’s had a taste. He has never been very strong, and right now his resolve is crumbling like a sand castle in the tide. Getting swept up in everything
Dean was the most stubborn son of a bitch he knew- but he knew he would have been eager to get the hell out of there. To get back to Sam. That was always what drove Dean to do anything.
. His quizzical head tilt was just perfection as he took in the scene before him. He looked around at the soft candle light, the fire, the stunning garlands and shimmering accents and everyone’s Sunday best then back to Dean.
He puts the bags down on the table and looks back at what almost brought him down.
The following day they were booking a room in Ohio – almost halfway.
"So, you know who this is, Dean, walking us to our deaths?" he is making a pretty desperate play here but desperate times and all that.
The crypt was right where they thought, and after a brief argument, Dean waits with Meg as Sam and Cas go to retrieve the tablet.
Longest fic by FAR for me...tell me what you think? Did it turn out okay?
“Sam” Cas’s gruff voice comes from the doorway as he shuffles over to the percolating jo on the counter.
Sam squints and watches Dean's light reach in the angel's direction almost immediately. Castiel's glow reaches right back.
“I know. “Sam replies. Dean’s aura is a swirling mix of colors again, and Sam gets drenched in Dean’s mess of emotions. It’s a roiling stew of concern, fear, anxiety, and it’s going to make Sam dizzy if he can’t reign it in.
Dean groans when she mentions those damn books. They were written from his perspective so he knew what she meant. He had thought Cas was heartless and or junkless for a most of the time. Turns out he was wrong. He asked Cas about that a while ago and got a very satisfying blush from the former angel who admitted to thinking about him and jacking off. It was an immensely sexy thought and he had gotten Cas to tell him
with him the most when they are apart.
Dean had fallen asleep halfway through the second movie, and his head had come to rest against Cas' shoulder. It happened from time to time, and it was always Cas' favorite part of movie-night when it did.
"She's into you, man- and it seems like it's not one-sided? You gonna take her up on her offer?" Sam laughs as he watches Castiel, Angel of the Lord blush.
“Nothing new. He is still angry about me almost dying. He is blaming himself.” Cas admits looking down at his hands. He knows Dean doesn’t want Sam to know what happened between them but it would be nice to have someone to talk to about it.
Dean is left utterly confused.
“I am not his friend. He was- covetous of Dean, and I do not trust him. But he saved Dean. Dean trusts him, and that is enough for me.” Cas sounds unwavering, his aura flashes brighter and for a split second the red chord pulses.
Sam reaches up and swipes Cas' hand off his forehead. When did he get two mothers?
They both laugh at that- releasing some of the nervous tension.
stares back.
“Diary of Georges Dumézil” -Castiel remembers him, arrogant but intelligent.
Dean just shot him a sly smile and wiggled his eyebrows while emptying the cup. Sam took in his appearance; his hair was still sticking up and he has been smiling easy all morning. He knew what

so perplexed by what he sensed that he almost misses Dean's actual response.
This seems to be going better though, well even. She steps into Cas’ personal space and is running her fingers up and down his tie.
“And what does that mean? That there is some family tree out there with God juice in its sap?” Dean asks, managing to both get to the answer surprisingly fast and making it sound crass before Sam even had a follow-up question.
He grasps Dean by his erect cock and is swept under the wave of arousal that hits him when Dean
I just have to say - you guys have been amazing. I have never had so many people engage and give feedback and it is incredibly rewarding. I always like sharing my stories but I struggle feeling motivated to go through the trouble sometimes but this has been so great! Thank you to everyone who subscribed, bookmarked, kudo'ed and especially commented. I love you all!
They'd talked about Missouri, Sam's weird vision quest, and this trial business. They were currently talking about who was the better actor- Clint Eastwood or Kevin Costner. Which really? Where Cas got his taste, he had no idea. Probably Sam's influence.
“Ok, so the two love birds- they’re kind of a big deal-

Cas knew him, as in- read all his thoughts for years-knew him. There was nothing he could reveal about himself to screw this up and Cas knew the life. Hell, Cas was blossoming in
“I know that. And I’m grateful for that -I really am.” He still has his own guilt simmering away over how he had failed Dean. Dean’s not bringing it up anymore, but he’s still hurt by Sam not working to bring him back that year. It’s in the air between them- every day.
And he knew Dean loved Castiel.
She took in a long steady breath and
She had planted her weapon right in their inner sanctum. He was perfect for the task.
The spell is in full swing, and Sam has been getting an almost constant stream of information from Dean. He needs to get to the bottom of things- the sooner, the better. Being able to hear his brother go through his morning routine of "cleaning the pipes" is nothing compared to feeling his emotions as he does it.

in the barn. He isn’t stupid.
“Um, John. John Winchester. Who are you?” John says, trying not to jump to any conclusions. His mind is still reeling from the whiplash that was last night. He doesn’t remember anyone mentioning a teenager living in the bunker. He knows Cas now, and the only other person he is aware of is their baby Jack.
He runs his fingers lightly over his stomach making his muscles twitch in reflexive shivers. And he follows the light brown hair all the way down.

"No, I'm good. My mom went out to pick up some Thai food. She should be back soon." And with that, he dives right back into his notes.
"Woah Woah- you mean the Flood was REAL? No way you can fit two of everything on a boat!" Dean blurts out.

“Aw shoot, you mean Sammy hasn’t mentioned me? Not even once? And here I thought we were so close…oh well” the guy sighed and slumped his shoulders.
“I suppose I was” John shrugs still looking sheepishly at Dean. “Sorry about that son.”
And then he just takes
“Why would the Angels have him kill another angel?” Dean asks, clearly scoffing at the idea but not coming up with anything better.
AN- don't drink and drive!! ever! Dean having a double shot before doing so probably doesn't affect him and he had an Angel in the car...so just don't.
Sam can't speak- his ears are bleeding, and his breathing is labored. The sound is pushing in on him. He just stares at the Guardian and tries to convey how pissed off all her non sequitur is, making him while fighting to stay on his feet.
“You think your mother is a danger to me? Dean, I can assure you that I can take care of myself. Mary is a skilled hunter but I am an Angel.” Castiel says with some venom in his voice.
Cas squints trying to remember what happened. He remembers Dean looking at him like that. The same question in his expression when he was finally free of Lucifer. But that was months ago.
. He is pretty sure that way lies badness.
Dean turns around to face his husband with wide eyes searching his face for signs that he was joking.
They shed their already unbuttoned shirts in a fumbling urgent mess of limbs. Cas is sucking a bruise into Dean’s neck and his hand is fumbling with his belt as Dean makes work of his shoes. They separate only to make enough room to divest themselves of the remaining clothing.
He can not even speak it.
. They had always fought, sure, but Sam always knew Dean would do anything for him. Now he wasn't sure Dean would pick him over the vampire if it really came down to it.
Sam smiles as he watches this interaction. Cas has come a long way in his ability to read humans. He's become an expert at reading Dean.
"I have interceded the line is made whole, it will hold." Says a voice from the corner of the room, and Sam knows who it is before the figure steps into the reach of the candlelight.
what that means and he can’t help but smile and huff out a “Finally” under his breath.
“Whoa, easy there, tiger,” Dean says as he tries to step between them.
“Not exactly equipped for that kinda thing Sam, besides we got Claire.” Dean replies looking across the room at his step daughter. She is laughing at Kevin who seems to be trying to ask Alex to dance.
"Sorry, Dean, I just don't get it- what could possibly make you so loyal to the guy- explain it to me, and maybe I can let it go? "Sam tries to implore, but it comes out a little more sarcastic than he intended. Dammit, he is still furious over this whole situation. He needs to reign back his feelings so that he can sort through Dean's.

“Sure Bobby, its’ um, its’ Dean’s wedding.” Sam says smiling and shrugging his shoulder up in explanation. Bobby looks to Dean who just shoots him a cocky smile and wags his eyebrow up- “What can I say- turns out I can settle down”.
I am incredibly blown away by the love this has been getting. It's been up for less than two weeks and it's already my third most read! You guys made this a dream! Thank you!!!!
. Of all the scenarios he ran through in his head this was not one of them.
Sam takes in the room – heavy wooden crosses are hung on every wall, along with framed prints depicting Saints and Angels doing battle. He shoots a look at Mary and Eileen that says “
He should stop. He should not hold on to this flesh so fiercely. He should talk to Dean. But he lost his words after Dean had taken him into his mouth and wrung out pleasure from this body he never knew was possible. He suspects that the
“Oh- I was making my specialty- French Toast- you wanna help?”
One by one they head to bed, first Sam, then Mary. John is just about ready to call it a night too when he takes the opportunity to talk to Dean alone.
Cas lets out a sinful groan at that and grabs Dean’s ass.
“Do you think they are likely to? I mean – pick up where they left off?” Cas asks looking thoughtful.
“John, Cas is an angel. The boys did mention that angels are real?” Mary puts her hand on his when she sees his stunned face.
He walks a little faster- his heart picking up speed as he imagines the worst-case scenario.
“Shit the spell? “Dean clarifies, rubbing his hand over his jaw.
"And she thinks I don't?" Dean sounds incredulous.
He is worried about his brother and they need to figure out how to stop this thing and fast. He isn’t as concerned as Mary though. He would be if it weren't for one detail. He is used to being around Cas and his unique abilities have become part of Sam's everyday world. To such an extent that he immediately realizes something that the average hunter would probably never consider in this situation. He groans trying to think of a way to explain yet another mortifying concept to the last two women in the world he wants to be talking to about his brother’s sex life.
“Hello Sam,” Cas said as he came up on his elbows and Sam could see his naked chest, collar bone covered in dark bruises.
“No, no they were ... never mind. They are chronicles of our young heroes the Super Tall Bros’, you know the sexy one with the hair and the angry gay one.

Cas' hand remains. Dean’s muscular thigh is warm and solid under it. The noise Dean made has his body in overdrive. His arousal is a heavy thing roiling in his belly, threatening to spill out and over. He didn’t think about what he was doing he just wanted the rocking to stop. Now he is staring at Dean who is licking his lips and he is pretty sure his erection is never going to go down again.
He’s lost count. All he knows is he is not ready to stop. His brain is a puddle of post-orgasmic chemical bliss but he wants more.
The drive is too long. Sam doesn’t stop, not even to fuel up. They barely make it on fumes.
“So, five for five then,” Sam thought- not jealous at all.
"Sam, why did you really cast the spell?" He gives Sam a hard glare making it clear that he is not falling for his story.
"Yeah, well, comes with the job." Dean tried to deflect as he finally sat down on his bed to face Castiel.
“Relax ‘lil man. The worst is behind our amigos. Spoiler alert. Dean-o and my baby bro Cas are going to get rid of all the demons and the whole gang gets to live happily ever after. Not so bad huh?” Gabriel flings an arm around Kevin and gives him a squeeze.
is left. He pushes down the urge to breathe clamoring at him until Dean finally breaks away. Panting they pull back- Cas looks up at Dean who is smiling the most genuine smile he has ever seen on his human.
He found Dean painting the angel warding symbols from the warehouse on the window. He understood what was happening, and he pulled out a spray can from the box on the coffee table and helped Dean ward the cabin from Heaven’s prying. At least it seemed like they were on the same page as far as Cas was concerned.
“I just want you to know that that wasn’t what I would have wanted for… you know. For our first time or whatever. I mean don’t get me wrong- I wanted it. I have for like- as long as I can remember. And I mean we were kinda working our way in that direction any ways, right?” Dean blurts out unable to hold back once he starts. He is suddenly worried that maybe Cas wasn’t ready for that yet, the guys only had sex once as far as he knows.
and shit.” She kicks his foot under the table “I can’t even be mad that I lost my best wingman, oh well, more vag for me then huh.” She teases and he almost chokes on his tongue when he sees the look some old lady gives them as she walks by.
"Don't worry; he'll come back." She says, trying to sound dispassionate as she strokes her cold blade against his cheek. "Unlike you."
Thanks, friends.
From that day on he got his own room every time they traveled. And he got a pair of novelty socks for Cas every Christmas as a joke.
Sam frowns unable to keep his features neutral any longer “What about the bathtub? Something happened there.”
Lucifer stabbed him. He looks down - there is a hole in Jimmy’s white cotton button up and he brings his hand to his chest. Frowning a question at Dean he looks back up and notices that Dean’s eyes are overflowing with glistening tears. The tears leave tracks down his stubbled cheeks and land on Cas’ coat making soft wet sounds as they both seem to hold their breath.
"Nope, just manage the property," she says, getting to her feet. "You guys here about the job?"
And he deserved it.
“It was weird.” Sam’s eye catches on a folder with red tape on the spine.

“Dumb bastard. Running yourself down for the likes of me.” Cas’s eyes harden, and he starts frowning, ready to launch into a well-practiced lecture on Dean's self-worth issues. “What would I do without you?” Dean says softly, cutting him off.
"This spell- it's not giving you any clues on that?" Dean asks, from his bubble of anxiety and concern.
All seven shots find their mark and she drops to the floor and Cas follows. For an unforgiving second Dean thinks she took Cas with her and he rushes over to the pile of tan fabric.
Right now, they need to get Cas free of whatever was yanking his chain- literally.
"I can see that," Missouri says, reverently looking the angel up and down in awe.
“She didn’t,” Sam says. “I’ve got her address- she still lives in town.”

so badly in his life as he did standing there in that doorway.
Always.
Sam thinks wryly that Dean would be making a very inappropriate joke about not being able to think of a better way to go out, right about now. He decides not to share that thought.
"1645 BC, are you serious?" Sam blurts out, going back to the seventies seem like a cheap parlor trick compared to this.
"The Hell I have!" she spits out in anger.
“Yeah, and they won’t come out,” Sam says pushing his lips together tightly at the irony of that statement.
Castiel starts to move, gently rocking his hips back and forth. Slipping out a little further with each pendulum and pushing back in a little harder until he strikes the perfect balance. He works in and out of his husband and watches as his eyes roll back in ecstasy. He shifts his knee up higher to change his trajectory and he knows he found the sweet spot when Dean screams out;
Feral.
Dean pulls him into a quick hug and says “You’ll find a special girl Sammy. Or guy- no judgement here!” Dean teases at the end. “Cas and I are looking forward to being the cool uncles to your -no doubt- enormous rug rats someday”
“Cas, hold on. What are we doing here?” Dean managed to choke out.
The brothers make their way out of the complex- the slow way- and when they reach the Impala, they walk up to a blood-soaked Cas cradling a very obviously dead Alfie in his arms. Sam's powers faded out again on the way over, and he wonders what a dead body would have given off before shaking off the morose thought.
“You have nothing to apologize for,” Cas reassures him. “It may not have been the reason you thought, but we were indeed hiding something from you.”
times, but I didn't think you would be ready for me so soon.”
"Really?" Dean frowned, grabbing the beer from Cas and taking a swig. Cas watched in fascination as Dean's lips wrapped around the top of the bottle -much slower than necessary- and his head tilted back slightly to let the cold liquid slid down his throat. Dean was aware of Cas' eyes on him, and he was startled when heat began to pull in his groin. He shifted uncomfortably in his seat and threw a silent curse at his treacherous dick. "No, man, that's how it's supposed to taste," he said, putting the bottle back in Cas' hand and avoiding eye contact.
“What is a bathhouse?” Cas asked curiously.
“That's what I thought.” Sam said.
we didn't let them inside. If you fellas were drugged, I'm sorry, but it didn't happen here.”
Charlie smiled brightly. “Don't you though?” she said suggestively.

print handcuffs sitting on top of the sheets that seemed to be broken. Finally, Sam noticed a black whip, an open bottle of lube (at least it was organic) and a pair of faded cowboy boots on the floor next to the bed. Sam distinctly remembered Cas asking him to buy him those exact boots weeks ago at a thrift store in Hastings. He had no idea what Cas had been planning to do with them. He should've known.

Dean pressed back into the girl's body and smirk at her. Cas scowled and grabbed a fistful of Dean's shirt, pulling him away from the woman and back into his arms. One of Dean's hands gripped Cas' hip while the other made its way around to rub circles over his ass. 'Nothin' to be jealous of, angel,' Dean said adoringly and kissed under his jaw. 'I'm so fucking hard for you right now.'
“You don't think they were,” Rubin's voice dropped into a whisper, “drugged here, do you?”
Cas reached down to pick his box up from the floorboard and set it in his lap. “Yes, let's do that.”
“I’ll keep that in mind next time,” Cas said unconcerned. “Would you like me to undress you?”
,” Dean said pulling the sheets out from under the dozing ex-angel to cover them up. "It'll remember you."
“I find it most effective at defeating you,” Cas responded and he did the same combination of moves again. “Flee or die, little man.”
Well, he decided he may not be able to deny it, but he sure as hell was going to add it to the list of things he never wanted to think about again. He looked down at his softening dick and mentally commanded it not to betray him like that in the future. He grabbed a towel and started to dry off.
“I thought you threw all that stuff out?”
Cas nodded,
it,” Dean whined. “Gotta, come Cas.
Cas nodded. “It's a recurring habit of his.”
"Sure. And sex." Dean answered smugly.
When Charlie saw Dean, her face lit up and she ran to pull him into a hug. “Greetings, handmaiden.”
“Videos?” Dean repeated. Of course there would be videos.
“True. He is kinda annoying. So, exactly how much stuff did you buy?” Dean asked when Cas pulled a third item from the box.
“No, it's fine, Dean. I'll go with you.”
Cas froze for a few awkward seconds before Dean pulled away and cleared his throat. "Uh, Cas. What the hell was that?"
The girl giggled again. “You can stay as long as you want. I get off at five, in case you were wondering.”
Except for the low hum of the radiator it went blissfully silent until Sam mumbled something unintelligible and shifted in bed. Cas closed his eyes again, hoping the splendid quiet would last long enough for him to fall into a deep slumber.
“Such as?”
“Yeah, and it ain't for you, so hands off.”
"Ugh," Sam pushed his plate away and stood up. "I'm just gonna go into town for a few of hours. Maybe stop at a bar and drink myself into a blissful coma."
The unwashed dishes are a blight on his typically immaculate kitchen but he leaves them for the new couple to clean. Instead, he goes to the junk drawer and rummages around until he finds what he needs. At the sink, he chuckles to himself while he rips off a piece of Scotch tape and places it firmly under the water tap.
Dean didn't think he could do it, but he nodded anyway and tightened his grip on the sheets. He decided that next time he would have Cas tie him to the bed because it was too much effort not to grab his dick and relieve it on his own.
“Yeah, your little date rape drug really did the trick,” Dean said accusingly.
Dean feels his cheeks heat. “Shut your mouth,” he says again.
“Dean.”
“A little sore,” Cas answered. “But it will be fine if you want to penetrate me again.”
"Not my fault that shitty
The redhead's hands returned to Cas' hips and she nudged him towards the bed. 'You just gotta keep moving your body to the beat,' she told him.
Dean locked his legs around Castiel's waist. His hips moved faster as he pounded his dick harder and harder into the hunter, balls slapping
“Dean?” Cas spoke, breaking the peaceful silence of the room.
“Dean?” Sam's muffled voice answered.
Dean woke to the sound of pounding. He tried to open his eyes, but the light was too bright and he instantly snapped them tightly shut again. His head was throbbing and he couldn't tell if the noise he kept hearing was coming from inside his head or not. It didn't matter; it was way too loud either way. He attempted to move, but found that his body wouldn't cooperate. He felt numb and heavy, like a weight pressed down on his chest. His brain seemed to be barely functioning, but he tried to focus on as much as he could. He knew he was on his back, laying on something soft. His bed? He didn't remember the mattress at the motel being so comfortable. There was an awful taste in his mouth, not helped by the fact that his throat was incredibly dry. He was clearly dehydrated and hadn't brushed his teeth before falling asleep (or rather, passing out). Worst of all, it was too hot in the room, making him tacky with sweat and his shirt and the sheets under him were completely soaked.
"It's just a turkey, Cas! Throw some seasoning on it and stick it in the oven already, I'm freaking starving."
“Not so bad yourself,” he responded with a laugh then decided to take advantage of Cas’ post-coital bliss. “So…are you gonna answer that question I asked or what?”
at the bar tonight."
When they’re alone, Dean lowers himself to sit next to his friend. “Hey.”
When he finished his oral assault of the navel, Cas kissed his way up Dean's chest until they were face to face. “You're very good with
“I'm close,” Dean whispered breathlessly as the other man continued to nibble and suck at his skin.
“How was Florida?” Kevin asked over a steaming cup of coffee as soon as the trio had made it inside.
sacrificed everything to make sure the people he loves are safe. I see the man who kept my coat even after I betrayed him because he thought I was dead, the man who spent a year searching for me in purgatory when he could have escaped at anytime, and the man who took me into his home when I was at my lowest and had nothing and nowhere else to go. So, don't tell me what you're deserving of, Dean Winchester. I am not ashamed of how I feel and I don't understand why it's so difficult for you to hear me say that I care about you.”
” Dean thinks and reaches for the tie, he wraps his hand around it and tugs. This silk is cool and his pull is unrelenting until he has Cas where he wants him. It feels like an anchor, a life line keeping him in this moment, this monumental instant where Dean is about to change the course of their relationship in a way that terrifies him.
“I mean some lines are still important- isn’t that why we were the perfect vessels? Didn’t ole’ Zacharia tell us that we were like bred to be the Arch Angels meat suits?” Dean asks Sam, earning a confused look from Kevin.
"The other one?" Sam asks, wondering who she means.
The next week they were in a small town near the Idaho border working a string of what seemed to be werewolf attacks. Sam had spent the afternoon in the records office trying to find information about their suspect and was looking forward to a long shower.
Cas just does that head cocking thing that makes him look like a bird.
"Hey Cas," Sam returned. Dean still only looked at the new arrival, eyebrows arched in question.
Sam is an idiot. He is a former honor student who got a full ride to Stanford but he’s an idiot.

“Yeah
There
“Cas. Can I kiss you-again, I mean?” Dean asks as he leans his forehead against Cas'.
Dean slips his tongue into Cas’ mouth and Cas thinks he might not be able to stay in his body-he bursts aflame as a new wave of
Cas now had more than one, Dean had teased him about his ever-growing collection of clothes – they had had to drag a second dresser into their room just last month. And here he was, wearing the exact one that put this whole plan into motion. Dean had to chuckle a little and shook his head as he reached out to adjust it just a little.
He gets up and turns around facing Cas. He sees the familiar head tilt and frown when Cas, no doubt infers that Dean has been crying. He smiles softly and shakes his head very subtly, just once, knowing Cas will know what he means.
was forcing him to do their bidding.
This bunker the boys found is truly a remarkable place. He was really surprised when Sam had filled him in on Henry and how that had come to be. He thinks it's going to take him a very long time to get right with that. He spent most of his life being bitter and feeling rejected by his father, he’s not sure how to reconcile that with what he’s learned.
He steps closer, takes Cas’ face in his rough hands and he goes for it.
keeps echoing in his mind like some kind of nightmare mantra, and he feels like he might scream.
Dean is talking to him. He is faintly aware, but no words are reaching his brain, he just sits there in the aftershock of so much
“Dean. This is not to be taken lightly. A mating goes beyond death. It would mean that your soul and whatever I have passing as one- would become one. On the spiritual level. Indivisible. We would spend the afterlife together. We would be soul mates – is the human term I believe. “Cas tries to get Dean to understand the enormity of such a bonding.

"Ok let me get this straight … this spell lets you see stuff that we normally can't see? Like silver eyes on a camera lens?" Dean tries to make sense of what is happening.
They destroy the Enochian angel warding sigils as they stumble on them. Killing at least seven demons - before coming to stand in front of a heavy metal door. He assumes it's Alfie screaming on the other side of it and the sound has a sharp edge to it that hurts Sam's head, and he squints. It doesn't seem to be affecting Dean as he calls for Cas to join them. Sam's new sense is still fading in and out, some demons were hard to look at with massive oily tendrils flaring around them, and then others didn't have anything.
He sighs.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean rubs his chin and sets his empty beer on the coffee table.
“I think I have something that can work,” Cas says right into his ear as he lifts Dean up and wraps the hunter’s legs around his waist. He starts striding to their bedroom like Dean weighs nothing.

"Is there anything you don't know?" Dean asked -finding that even after all these years, he never stopped being impressed by the knowledge Cas had. "You know what – don't answer that."
Hearing Cas voice concern for her, minutes after having his dreamboat propose, made her feel all warm inside, and she didn’t know what to

"I just mean, she's a different SPECIES! Isn't that like wrong or something?" Dean sounded scandalized, which was rich coming from him.
He gets the impression it's how Angles are rewired.
John is terrified that he might be capable of filicide. He thinks he could murder Dean.

, he never thought about it again. Having Mary in his life has not been without its share of issues but he feels like it was something he needed. It had helped him settle into the man he had become. He had some lingering insecurities, resentments and repressed feelings that have largely been dealt with- in no small part due to having his mom around. No one had been more surprised by that than Dean himself. Seems like God’s sister had known what she was doing after all.
He is vaguely aware that he has a life, things he is responsible for. People who are waiting for him. He can’t care about that though, not when Cas is straddling him and he gives his mind over to the pleasure sparking low in his belly.
They find themselves in a forest, the air is crisp, and there's a familiar stench in the air.
