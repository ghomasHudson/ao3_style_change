“Yes” Sherlock sighed “It was my brother”
“Are you moving in with him?” Bill asked and leaned on the fridge, Mike handed him the bottle and Bill took a sip.
And so, it was written...
“How did it go?” She bit her lower lip to contain the smile.
“I couldn’t believe you wanted me sad and lonely instead of accepting me for whom I am. If only you could have seen your face when I told you James and I broke up and then I told you about Mary” John rubbed his forehead, trying to erase the memory with his fingertips “heaven opened for all of you that day…” John looked away and took a deep breath “I’ll call you as soon as we’re settled Mum. I promise” John approached her and gave her a hug “I’ll have Rosie, you can bring Dad if you want, but I have one condition” Julia nodded “My house, my rules” She nodded again “One word against Sherlock…” John let out a breath and Julia simply nodded again, closing her eyes and accepting everything John was saying.
I've died a thousand deaths. Once I was a still-born; my soul didn't even have a chance to enter my body before I had already died. Another time I died in a brawl... ah! a well-aimed knife, straight to where it mattered, but I had saved "The Bard" himself.
“How come you ended up with Rosie?” Mycroft knew it, everything, he had helped Gregory with the case, but neither Sherlock nor John needed to know that.
“Are you going to tell me?” Sherlock sat at the kitchen table and watched as John moved around the kitchen to prepare their tea.
“I need pick up” He said to the voice on the other end and in less than ten minutes the ubiquitous black car was there, Anthea opened the door for him, still wearing black for Mycroft… Sherlock realised he was alone, his parents blown up, his brother dead and the love of his life hating him… forever…
“It’s fine” Sherlock let out the breath he’d been holding “I guess I’ll have to wait and see what happens when I return to London for good” He bit his lower lip and kept silent for a moment “Besides” He was ready to give the next excuse “He has a baby and his plate is full”
By listening.
“So you’re waiting” Bill was astonished, knowing John the way he knew him…
“Hello, John” Sherlock sighed with relief and let him in, leading him to the once pristine living room.
“And who’s the cutie?” Irene asked with a sickly sweet voice “The baby, I mean” Both Sherlock and John huffed at the same time.
Sherlock startled, back to reality and focusing on the heat John’s hand produced in his body and how the warmth spread from his chest instead of his arm. “Sherlock, please” He managed to answer in a sigh.
“She’s four months, right?” Sherlock eyes the sleeping bundle.
Mycroft was silent witness to the exchange, feeling a warm feeling spread over his chest; he had never seen his brother this happy and all he wanted was to build a bubble surrounded by soft cotton and clear blue skies to keep Sherlock in the same exhilarating state for ever. He saw them approach the car and climbed out, unable to hide his happy smile. Sherlock looked at him, first with a glare, then a stare and finally a fond look in his eyes, one Mycroft hadn’t seen in many years.
“I’ll do the dishes” Sherlock stood from his chair and picked up the plates “Yes?” He looked pointedly at Mrs. Hudson and she just giggled and shook her head.
“Sherlock” John licked his lips again and met his eyes and stared for a long moment before looking down again to Rosie when she moved “I’m John” He said.
James walked out of John’s room throwing the door and stomping down the stairs. John sat on his bed, head in his hands, trying to stop the tears that were falling from his eyes; he tried to breath deep but it hurt in impossible ways, his lungs felt as if they were on fire, but at the same time it felt like breathing icy wind. Mary arrived twenty minutes after John texted her and she simply held her friend close and heard him cry.
Not having his baby around came both as a blessing and as a curse. John was moody and nobody wanted to be close to him. His flatmates, Mike and Bill avoided him the entire week, Molly walked on eggshells and Sarah, his earliest and latest admirer, finally -hopefully- understood he didn’t want to be with her in any fashion. He lashed out to several people, was rude to a couple of lecturers and by Friday afternoon he snapped and was almost thrown out of the lecture.
“You shouldn’t” John blushed like a beet when Siger handed him the tickets.
“I don’t want to sit down” John looked around, trying to listen if somebody else was in the house “I’m here for my daughter” he added.
“He does” John could hear Molly nodding.
“Yes” Violet worried at her son calling her and most of all asking if she was in London. “Sherlock, dear. Are you okay?” She tried to keep the panic at bay but fearing the worst.
“I’m completely aware of that” Sherlock pursed his lips and the cutest pout appeared over his lips, John shook his head and simply smiled “I know I’m in no position of demanding all your free time for me” Sherlock continued, interrupting John and whatever he might have wanted to say” I know you have your studies, your team, you have Rosie, but so far we have managed” He gave a shy smile “I know an internet relationship is not ideal, but I’m willing to give it a try” Sherlock played with John’s fingers as he waited for an answer.
“Is he good to you?” She pierced him with those aquamarine eyes that admitted no excuse.
“Where do I sign to say I don’t want any of this?” John asked and Sherlock finally relaxed. “Look, Sherlock” John continued “I love you because you’re who you are, not because of your money, or a bet; or because I want to fuck you, which I want, so much, but…” John took a deep breath and fixed his eyes on Sherlock’s face, Sherlock was pale and looked baffled, John thought about what he had just said and realised he had said Sherlock that he loved him and that he wanted him.
John turned on his heels about to ask what the boy meant when he found himself under the inquisitive eyes once again and his throat was dry and he had to lick his lips and he saw those eyes travel down and fix on his mouth and John felt as he had won a rugby match, breathless, agitated, a rush of adrenaline running all over his body, immensely happy and excited because the boy was interested. He walked to him and they were standing almost chest to chest and the universe collapsed; worlds collided and the history of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson began with a big bang.
“I can’t do it like this anymore…” John rubbed his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles; taking the opportunity life was giving him “I was so afraid to tell you…” He sighed and looked at Sherlock’s blueish-greenish eyes and got lost in them “I was so afraid that if you knew I was… failing… you’ll leave me again…” John confessed and Sherlock pulled him into a hug
He pressed send and wished he could delete the text.
… but he couldn’t leave, not just yet… He knew when his friends asked about that night, he could only tell them that he was ready to leave, ready to board that last train, but…
Eurus didn’t want to interfere in their relationship; all she wanted was for Sherlock to be happy. She had witnessed her brother’s decay after Victor fucking Trevor, she was aware of his wrong doing, she had several friends, and Jim had told her all about James and Victor… She was pissed and wanted to kill him, but out of respect to Sherlock she had stopped Jim from beating the shit out of both of them with his best friend Sebastian Moran. If it were for them… But no, she wouldn’t interfere, John was a keeper.
“Yes?” He bit his lower lip, unable to contain his glee.
"Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living."
“I also know that you know how important it is for me to finish medical school; that I somehow managed to get a scholarship and that most my time, for the next five years will be spent studying, having long shifts at the hospital, playing rugby and keeping high scores to keep the scholarship; coming home late and having just the right amount of time to be with Rosie and bring her up” John licked his lips once again and tried to keep his eyes on Sherlock’s the entire time, it wasn’t really worth it starting something that could end even before it truly began.
Upon his return, I was so... angry. But I love him so... but it was too late...
“Where you planning on telling us” John looked up at the hurt sound of her voice.
John was about to feel very offended; he was practically a widower, not really, but almost; until he noticed that the Sergeant had handed him a piece of paper with the name, mail address and number of the boy, again, man, he was looking for. He had no idea if he should be grateful or angry at the perceptiveness of the cop so he just nodded, folded the piece of paper and walked out of the office. Outside, reality came crashing down and he realised he was alone, in charge of a daughter, a house, school, a job… He was up to his neck…
“Tell you what?” He kept his back to Sherlock.
If it were under any other circumstances, John would be ever-joyed to have rendered the cleverest, most talkative man in the world speechless, but unlike the last time… let’s leave that behind… Sherlock was truly shocked and was even breathing with a certain amount of difficulty.
"I was so alone, and I owe you so much."
My John sighs and looks at me, a small smile on his beautiful lips. He licks them and I'm lost, it's so hard to concentrate when he does that. He reaches for my hand and squeezes it softly. I think we're done, but he starts to talk.
Silas dies of old age, surrounded by children and grandchildren. Maria, his wife, by his side, his last memory is of raven curls between his fingers, soft skin against his own, the smell of jasmine surrounding him, At 64, his soul finds peace.
John was excited when Sherlock said he’ll be arriving to London Saturday afternoon. He had planned everything for the month and a half Sherlock will be in London. Sure, his schedule wasn’t exactly flexible, but he’d managed to work out a system to improve his time with Sherlock.  When he received the text, he felt his world crumble, everything changed and he couldn’t understand how, in such a short time, he had put such hope in a meeting. He decided to put his mind in school and work, working himself to shreds.
John watched crap telly while Sherlock worked on more cold cases, made some tea and by ten he was too exhausted to keep his eyes open; Sherlock helped him to bed and they lay together for a few minutes, kissing and holding hands before sleep was to strong and took John first. Sherlock left him to sleep and went back to the living room to send Lestrade his notes on a few cases; by midnight he was ready for bed.
By being there.
Looking over John’s shoulder Sherlock could see the flat had been rearranged. The coffee table was pushed against the window, under the desk, their chairs were closer to the fire, and he could see a blanket on the floor, on top of their new rug, some food and wine spread, and if he focused enough he could smell Angelo’s tiramisu.
“Her girlfriend thinks so too” Sherlock snorted “Irene’s girlfriend, Kate, studies music with me” Sherlock felt the need to explain. “We’ve been… friends…” Sherlock waved his hand as if that explained the feeling “Since I came to University. Irene was the only person that talked to me when I arrived to school, and she’s been a good friend for the past two years. Used to keep me distracted” Sherlock shrugged.
“London isn’t London without you” John kissed Sherlock’s shoulder.
“John Watson” Sherlock took a deep breath and held it “Would you like to move in with me?”
And Sherlock’s eyes landed on him.
London, same cesspool since it was named London... And as usual, cue Stamford, is it Stamford this time too? But something's different. His eyes...
“You were at the lab for four hours?” John was baffled; he couldn’t remember the last time he was in a lab for so long.
“Starving”
“You have your bags?” Sherlock asked and looked around. John nodded and Sherlock led him to the waiting car “We’re going to Orleans, but Mamie promised we’ll have time to visit Paris before we leave” Sherlock beamed at John and helped him get in the car with his bags and his baby.
"Callistus" dies in his sleep. His master grants him rest that day, he's seen him sad before, but today he hasn't even eaten. Next morning, his master finds him, he died in his sleep, alone. At 60, his soul finally rests.
“Mrs. Hudson said I could move in as soon as I see fit” Sherlock repeated, he tried his “cold and detached” strategy, to avoid the hurt of rejection, but he couldn’t keep the hope from his eyes.
“This is Sherlock Holmes, not taking cases at the moment, don’t leave a dull message” he had only the beep to find the courage to say what he had to say, another deep breath and the force of what he was about to say hit him like a ton of bricks and left him aching all over
“Sure” John licked his lips and Sherlock looked down trying to control the blush.
They ate in an uncomfortable silence, neither knowing how to resume the conversation. When the food was finished and dessert was served, the silence had turned into tension, Sherlock kept looking out the window and fidgeting, John was focused on the candle in front of him, both thinking about what to do and ask. John decided it could be a good idea to come and live with Sherlock, that would give them time to know each other, but it could also ruin everything, having a baby wasn’t easy and Sherlock just had shared with Rosie a few nights at Oxford, never in London.
They talked after, long and hard… John had blamed him for everything and Sherlock had accepted the blame, he had accepted everything John had said, every word, every insult, every single disappointed look, everything John decided to throw his way, he had taken
“He’s in a lecture right now” Sherlock rocked Rosie “Molly was supposed to take care of Rosie but she left me alone”
He refused to check his phone or answer Sherlock’s calls. After two days, even Rosie noticed something was wrong and cried at the exact time Sherlock was supposed to call. Rosie missed him too, just as much as John did; but John tried to be strong, he couldn’t ask Sherlock to come back, he was visiting his grandmother, in France of all places! John had to give him time… At least that was a good excuse.
There is a lesson to be learnt. To forgive. Not the other but oneself. There will always be a soulless soul, a mateless mate. There will always be just one of us.
“Lestrade” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
The lesson? Complete understanding that our lives belong to others, the ones that love us, cherish us, wait for us...
When Sherlock finally called, twenty minutes after John arrived; John’s heart jumped in his chest and made for the run. He took a deep breath before answering, trying to be cool and calm, but failing… miserably…
"I don't want to die."
No excuses whatsoever... But my health does comes first. Back behind the keyboard and slightly more inspired to finish the story. Thank you all so much for reading. I love you all!
Rosie, the apple of their eyes… Oh how many times had Rosie interrupted what could have become their first time… Since the beginning, they had stablished a routine, with her, with their families and friends, with everything and everyone, and between them; but one day, things just shifted; Sherlock caught John masturbating and couldn’t help but stare until John came with a quiet cry of his name. After that, Sherlock became a voyeur and would just watch John pleasure himself, knowing that his presence fuelled the fantasy.
Just like in any other family, John was the youngest of two. Harry, older brother, eight years his senior, the pride and joy of mummy and daddy alike, was considered brilliant and just to follow gramps’ example, he wanted to become a lawyer, dad had patted his back and congratulated him on his choice of career and had called him brilliant, smart, intelligent “A good man to rely on, a real Watson”, and John understood that even though he was brave, he was nowhere near brilliant. That night, after their confessions, his older brother had mocked him, called him silly, and John decided to keep his dream to himself and move forward.
“What?” John needed Sherlock to repeat what he had said, he needed to make sure. Sherlock had asked him to move in together but they’d been together for two months, should he move in with him?
“Breakfast tomorrow?”
“Oh! Have you had sex?” Eurus surprised him but he tried not to show it. Not even Mycroft had noticed that change in him the day of the explosion.
“Of course I was. I just decided to move out yesterday. I was going to call you as soon as we settled” John looked at her for the first time, she looked tired, she’d been crying and the news about Rosie affected her more than she let on.
He was supposed to board that
I know!!! You few but faithful probably hate me right now, but I got a job! I'm super excited! I'll tell you all about it in another fic, as soon as I have more free time. Thank you for hanging with me and this story. I'll give you all I can this next couple of days before I leave again. Love you all and happy Sherlock! G.
"Thai?" I ask with the hope of distracting him, though not as successfully as he did.
John had never felt this way, so full and so complete, so right and so happy, immensely so, it was as if all this time he had been deprived of all his senses and now was able to feel, see, hear, taste, smell for the first time in his life, all his senses heightened, feeling Sherlock’s short breaths on his neck, his fingers tingling with the feel of Sherlock’s skin, his mouth swollen, tasting Sherlock’s lips, neck, tasting his sweat, smelling that sweet smell that belongs only to Sherlock, spicy, yet so much like honey, hearing Sherlock moan softly and call his name with every thrust, hearing the reverence, the need, the love.
“Not yet” Sherlock shook his head again and held her hand, closing the gap between them and planting a kiss on her cheek “If you need to, lease it” He sighed and she shook her head. John was silent witness to the exchange and couldn’t help but smile and look dazed and pleased when Sherlock looked at Mrs. Hudson or when she acted lovingly towards him. By nine, Sherlock hailed a cab and helped John with Rosie’s stuff.
She told John about the baby before telling her parents, of course she did, but when John asked what was she going to tell them when they asked about the father, her face fell and she started crying. John just held her and she allowed the warmth of friendship wash over her “Would you help me?” She whispered against his neck and John nodded, his arms around her shoulders and worry all over his face.
A lazy Sunday. Rosie is playing on the new rug with the bee I gave her for her first birthday. She giggles every time the bee buzzes and lightly vibrates in her tiny hands.
The months went by quickly and little Rosamund Mary “Rosie” Watson was born October 11th, 9 pounds 11 ounces, 47 centimetres, ten fingers, ten toes; Mary’s nose and lips. John was the first to hold her, his heart swelled with love for the little girl, HIS little girl; he cut the cord and gave Mary a kiss to the forehead before leaving the room to introduce the newest Watson to the family. The Morstans were ecstatic, while the Watsons could barely contain themselves. John paraded like a proud father and realised that no matter how deep in shit his life was, just holding little Rosie was worth every single tear he had shed the last eight months.
“Okay” Violet grinned “I’ll teach how to change a nappy, how to taste the milk and then you’re on your own. Let the baby guide you” She had a mischievous look. Sherlock paled the moment his mother said she’ll be leaving after teaching him whatever he is supposed to learn and absentmindedly ended telling his mother all about John Watson and how they’d met “He seems like a good enough man to me” She said seriously and Sherlock just looked at her as if she had grown another head.
“I won’t hold you to that promise” Mary whispered in his ear and John just looked at her, utterly lost for the first time in his life.
“Yeah, got the car, that’s all you want from us now” Bill mocked offence, he went over to Mike and put a hand on his shoulder and said in a sickly sweet way “Our little boy is growing up, dear, he’s got a boyfriend” dabbing a non-existent tear from his eye and putting his other hand over his chest before sighing sadly. Mike laughed heartily and grabbed his now growing stomach.
“I appreciate the offer” John took a deep breath “No thanks” He looked out of the window and his face brightened when he saw the black door to their flat and Sherlock at the door, waiting for them. John practically bolted out of the car and rushed to Sherlock, kissing him like a drowning man. Sherlock smiled softly against John’s lips, whispered something in his ear and John beamed at him.
“Actually, yes” John pursed his lips and fixed his eyes on Sherlock’s. He could see the Detective trying to school his features into the cold mask of arrogance, but his eyes said it all. Betrayal, pain, anger, sorrow and fear went over his icy eyes, before they settled in resignation and a blank stare that betrayed nothing. “With my therapist” John clarified and Sherlock took a short breath before steepling his fingers over his lips to hide the trembling. “I’ve been seeing her for the past ten months” John continued, breaking the uncomfortable silence “But instead of going to her office” He scratched the back of his neck trying to figure out how Sherlock hadn’t found out about it “She’s been going to mine” He took a deep breath “She’s scheduled appointments after five, three times a week and she’s been helping me with texts and calls…” he blushed and looked away “Whenever I had a nightmare or couldn’t cope with all that has happened the past year”
Rome, during the first century B.C. was... convulse. The Roman Republic was agonizing and the new Empire was on the making.
“Yes” John beamed and reached for Sherlock’s hand, pulling him for a soft and slow kiss.
… not that his son is a beast,
Sherlock occupied his time studying and doing some time in the lab, thinking about John and all the missed opportunities for kissing the man he had dreamt about the last month. He wanted to be with him, but at the same time, managing a long distance relationship meant not being there all the time. He had already experienced what it was to be apart when he dated Victor.
“He said it sounded like a plan” Sherlock scowled at the memory, John was feeding Rosie and barely listening “But I fear he wasn’t really listening, Rosie was acting out” He let out a biscuit muffled sigh.
"Lost chances," I mutter, just to say something. Sherlock looks at me and I can see all he wants to say. I make myself nod again and he stands, takes his violin and plays that tune he played when we almost met.
As I told you, my work hours are crazy, I work twenty one days each month and have only seven days free... @-@ (I know!) which is why I update every month. Thank you to my few but faithful followers for the patience and for reading this silly fic.  I love you all and Happy Sherlock!
“Seriously, John?” Sherlock steepled his fingers under his chin “Jealousy?” He sighed.
“Where are you?”
“Of course, dear” She cooed and served him another cup “The second bedroom could be used as a baby’s room” She winked and Sherlock blushed.
"I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead."
Life was busy, raising a baby, studying, going to university, working part time jobs and having a healthy relationship. In spite of barely having time to eat or sleep, they managed to have a date day every week, going for Chinese, to Angelo’s, sharing a night out, for the sake of their relationship.
After Violet left, all Sherlock could do was follow her instructions. As promised; Molly returned by three in the afternoon, what Sherlock wasn’t expecting was Lestrade with her, holding her hand. One glance and Sherlock got all the information he needed.
Oh, yeah... Married her several times, whenever I don't die... or she's simply writen off the latest script of my life, depending on who's writing it...
Mary decided to keep a secret from John, or well, several. She never told her parents he is gay, or that the “nice chap that’s always with John” -as her father referred to James- was John’s boyfriend, or the fact that she got pregnant after ninety stupid seconds with David during her first time. For all John knew, she’d “done the nasty” with David a few weeks after John had done it with James.
“Yes” Sherlock let out a breath he’d been holding and John smiled at the phone.
Dinner was ready for Rosie, after pasta they had to give her another bath, considering she had more food in her hair than in her plate at some point; she babbled, giggled, mumbled and wet them both. After bath came sleepy time, John read, Sherlock played and Rosie fell asleep rather quickly. Once she was out, Sherlock took care of the kitchen, John the bathroom before they ate dinner.
“I told him I was done with university, I told him I was out, but I don’t think he paid much attention” He pouted “Anyway” He sighed “I’ve decided to go to King’s and study Forensic Science” He put another biscuit in his mouth and drank some more tea “I’ve talked to the headmaster already, turns out I’m ahead on the programme, I’ll be done in a year… Out of university for good”
“As far as you want to take me” Sherlock answered without hesitation.
Rescuing you from a lit bonfire.
Life with her was like a dream, a very hectic dream. Sherlock was lost in love with her, just as much as John, charming, sweet, little girl that would melt them with one look; but as much as they loved her, the little respites of time they got from taking care of her meant a lot to them. Having even a few moments of silence apart from the squealing baby that got excited with an ant as much as she did with the buzzing lights, was something to look for.
“She’s working with me now. If you must know” Mycroft explained unnecessarily; Sherlock knew perfectly well what had driven Anthea away and was grateful -not that he will ever say it aloud- to his brother to protect and defend him. It was a nasty business at school and University when he came out and Anthea made very clear that she wanted nothing to do with “your queer little brother”; Mycroft broke it off, even though he seemed smitten by the curvaceous young woman. Sherlock knew that having her as a PA was an even worst insult to her, because now she had to deal with whatever Mycroft wanted her to deal with; as Mycroft once put it, revenge is a dish best served cold.
“Two months yesterday” John muttered “I know it’s soon. Pa” Henry looked at his son, it had been years since he called him that “But it feels so right” John sighed and smiled as he watched Rosie smearing some of her apple sauce on Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock’s laughter filled the kitchen along with Rosie’s giggles.
It was past eight when the Watsons made their way out of the flat, leaving and exhausted couple to fend with an over exited baby. They had to bathe her again to try and relax her with a scented bath; they read to her, Sherlock played the violin for over twenty minutes while John read her two Winnie the Pooh stories. It was after nine when she finally fell asleep; but they still had a flat to clean before starting all over the next day.
John was tired; he had an argument with one of the nurses during his last surgery and he almost made a mistake; fortunately for him, he was able to clamp the artery and do and emergency intervention, saving the patient’s life and his kidney. The nurse had handed him, a bit forcefully, the wrong instrument, and he hadn’t checked what he had in his hand until it was almost too late and he almost nicked the artery instead of clamping it.
As they walked along the garden to get to the house, John was marvelled -more astonished- with the size of the grounds; when the house came to view, his astonishment turned into curiosity, because the size of the house was nothing compared to the sumptuous gardens. The house was relatively small, two stories, large windows, not a grandiose entrance. When they entered, John found the house comfortable, cosy, he felt as if he had arrived home.
“Nope, not today” John smirked and grabbed Sherlock’s buttock, squeezing it lightly
“I know” John sighed “Sorry”
Mrs. Hudson practically forced them together for tea one afternoon, but “The Blitz” was a breeze compared to the moment they laid eyes in the other.
John hit send and put the phone in his pocket and felt for the paper he had there. He wondered how Sherlock would react if he were to write to him now. He looked for him on the internet and found and interesting blog “The science of deduction”. He read it by bits and snippets while feeding Rosie and laughed at the prospect of finding 243 different types of ash interesting and exciting.
“So…” Mike was looking at John with serious eyes “Has he popped your cherry yet?” He barely managed not to laugh. John blushed and bit his lower lip, looking away from his friends. Mycroft knew that John told them everything about his one night stands.
Eurus loved John, in a very especial way; she could see Sherlock being sweet, tender, loving, caring and she loved John for loving her bother the way he did. She realised they were both love-struck. She was different when John was around; her ability to manipulate rendered useless when he was near; he wasn’t like the others, her charms didn’t work with him; Eurus knew it was because he was charmed by her brother. She didn’t need Mycroft’s intelligence reports to know John was the best match for Sherlock.
They walked hand in hand back to John’s shared flat. To Sherlock’s surprise, John had packed most of his and Rosie’s things; the thought of John deciding to move in with him before the whole money, houses and titles had Sherlock’s heart bursting out of his chest and his stomach flipping and turning wildly.
At some point, during the next weekend, John helped Sherlock solve a cold case, they had lunch together and Sherlock talked with Rosie, Rosie recognising his voice. Sherlock would play the violin so she would sleep faster while feeding, making John’s work slightly more complicated when he needed to feed her; it never annoyed John, it actually made him truly happy that his daughter liked Sherlock so much.
Their goodbye had been sad; Sherlock left London and went to Oxford for his third year -being a genius, he had finished school by fifteen, just like Eurus and Mycroft and was accepted to Oxford and started his first year before his sixteenth birthday, Molly always admired that capacity of theirs to best everyone- and Molly was left teared eyed, with no one to tell she was to lose her best friend to a baby, that her life had changed after 90 seconds. Molly would text and Sherlock would answer. He told her all about Irene “quite a character” and her girlfriend Kate, she told him about James breaking up with John and John marrying Mary. Sherlock told him about Charles Magnussen and how his lectures fascinated him and Molly had the sad duty to tell him about Victor dating again.
“Over dinner?” John asked and Sherlock nodded “Chinese?”
They became friends quite quickly; they were attached at the hip. Mary would go to every game and cheer for him, she would go to parties with John and John would take Mary to the cinema. Eventually, they met each other’s parents, whom, at some point, thought there was something there, that is, until Mary brought David to her home and introduced him as her boyfriend, and John brought James home and introduced him as his boyfriend.
and continue his services privately, they leave tonight.
John stared at the screen of his phone trying to rack his brains to figure why Sherlock had photos of Rosie. The last one, of the baby on his chest, eyes closed and absolutely relaxed did it for John and he wanted to leave his lecture as soon as it was possible. As soon as he arrived to his lecture, John tried to call Molly but her phone was off, he even tried Greg but he wasn’t answering either, desperate, he called his mother and tried not to worry her and surreptitiously try to find something about his daughter when the first message of the day came. It was a photo of Rosie with an elder lady; the foot of the photo said “My Mum and Rosie. She’s fine, Molly just left her”
Silas is a good man, but even a good man knows certain things. Silas and his friends know of these "houses", he's been there a couple of times and has enjoyed the company of many ladies (and not a few men). His father keeps quiet at the table, but when alone, he congratulates him for having many ladies (father doesn't know about his not few men), they know the new precepts, but they also ignore them, most of them simply don't fit in their way of life. But, Silas thinks, what father doesn't know won't hurt him.
“I need to get my key back” He huffed and looked at John, his expressions changing to one of concern and fear when he saw John’s face.
After Mary was killed, Greg was glad that Sherlock was there to help him; every single time Sherlock helped him, he received a commendation and was going places pretty fast. He had joined the force at 18 -to help with University- and by his 23rd birthday he was made sergeant, thanks to his young friend. When he met him 5 years ago, he could have sworn he would find the boy in a ditch somewhere, drugged up to his bones without salvation. He was glad he was wrong and was proud that Sherlock had followed a different path instead of recurring to drugs.
Thank you all so much for subscribing and reading. I get my kicks out of the hits. I love you all my loyal followers. Happy Sherlock!
"Hush, love, These are your memories, too."
As for Sherlock, he was also halfway on his studies at King’s and was trying to manage his schedules, John’s, Rosie’s and his work with the police; his life with his little family was relatively easier than his life at school; yes, his teachers were impressed and were talking early graduation, but his peers were another thing; he had made a few friends, some he had worked with at the police, others knew him and John, but there were a few idiots on his way, Phillip Anderson the most renowned, jealous of Sherlock’s age, ability or whatever, he made Sherlock’s life a living hell.
“Every day, in every way it’s getting better and better”
“As soon as you’re done with school; just a week, and then we can go back to London, get ready for school… I don’t know” Sherlock rubbed the back of his neck and held the phone tighter.
“I’m going to Belgravia” Sherlock pointed behind him “You’re going to Barbican” He shifted on his feet “I’ll take the next one” He attempted a smile but failed. He was waiting for John’s answer when he saw the inconspicuous black car approaching the kerb and tried not to scowl.
Rosie is the centre of their universe; they work around her and for her. Sherlock is always thinking of new ways to improve her skills, being reading or playing for her for hours, showing her pictures and teaching her words, complicated words. So far, Rosie has learned to say “skull”, “forensic” -though it sounds more like frensic-, “laboratory” -but in her little mouth sounds like labotory- “femur” -feemu- “anatomy” -tatomy- amongst others. John simply chuckled at Sherlock’s attempts, but admires both of them, Sherlock for teaching her and Rosie for learning such difficult words.
Now that Christianity is the talk of the town, Britannia, as much as the rest of the falling Empire, is accepting this new religion and with it, a new set of rules and a belief system that now punishes what was once accepted.
We "first" met a long time ago. He was already dead and I carried bodies. I didn't recognise him at first. I was blind with rage. Rage to find that he's died from an arrow to the left shoulder. Very well placed the damn thing was... nicked an artery in an artful way.
“Fine” John sighed amusedly “I’d love to go, but I don’t think I can pay the fare”
“And the truth was?”
Sherlock felt his heart break after two days of trying to contact John and failing. He hadn’t promised to be there, but they had made plans. Sherlock knew John had another month of classes; they’ll only have two weeks to be together, to know each other more than they already did, plan… maybe.
“Easily fixed” Sherlock replied.
“How is she?” He asked, looking down at the sleeping baby “Did she behave?”
“I had no idea how” John sagged in his chair
It took Rosie and a hospital visit for them to see each other and be… polite.
“Hey” John couldn’t help but smile, his anger melting at the sound of Sherlock’s voice “Is fine. I assume it was someone that needed to talk to you” John bit his lower lip.
Do comment, and if you will, leave a kudo. Thank you for reading!
He was also aware that they lacked time, that John had shifts, Sherlock had cases, Rosie was their priority, and they also made time for school, work, friends, family… life… Between cases, shifts and nappy changes, they were on the wait.
John was more than willing to help. He talked to James before talking to Mary and James was on board. They discussed how John would participate. He would take the blame, assure the distressed parents he’ll be there for Mary and the baby and walk out, simple as that. But when has life been simple? John nodded and gave James a kiss, saying a quick goodbye before going to face his future.
“Mrs. Hudson” Sherlock hugged her and kissed her cheek “May I introduce you, John Watson” He pointed at John and she shook his hand, the motherly smile on her face again. When she saw Rosie she cooed at them and invited them in.
The crowd started applauding, whistling, catcalling… all around one body that was moving like it was the last day on earth… the movements were mesmerising, John was entranced. The dancer was precise; calculated, yet natural moves, sensual, sexy, hot as hell… he was dancing his heart out, like nobody else was there, he was one with the music, his hips swayed back and forth, his hands and arms moved gracefully around him, his legs lifted and bent, and bounced and ran up to heaven, up to… up to an arse to die for, round, firm, strong, biteable… he was so sensual, so sexy… so… he was a he!
“But in the meantime”
“Have a seat, John” Mycroft gave him another once over as they walked inside the house, he tried to be intimidating but apparently it wasn’t working.
“I’ll think about it, Bug” He rolled his eyes but decided to take his sister’s advice at heart.
They were having so much fun, the celebrated as if today was the last day of their lives. Bill had suggested they left London, for something different to do, instead of visiting the same usual places.
“Sherlock…” John was amused.
Marcus' Centuria arrives to Thapsacus. The morning of 6 April finds them preparing for battle. Caesar leaves his tent and addresses his men, the mandatory "pep-talk" to raise spirits and points to the always useful and ever present "Roman Spirit" held by the standard-bearer. The sound of trumpets signals the start, confusion, elephants, archers. Marcus holds his position and the battle goes to Caesar. Sadly, Marcus doesn't see the end of the battle, he falls under friendly fire trying to save a fellow legionary.
They held each other for a long while, just feeling their breathing, their bodies, their pulses, no more words needed, no more apologies, nothing, just the two of them then and there. More than sudden realisation of love, it was an absolute certainty that if they kissed, the world would stop and turn and everything will be right, forgiven… maybe even forgotten
"Your brother once told me you had the mind of a philosopher." John whispers, Rosie is asleep in his arms and he doesn't want to move.
“My mind works over time. I can tell you where you’ve been just by looking at you. I know you ate Lancashire Hotpot a favourite of yours; you eat it at least twice a week, always made by your mother. I know you changed Rosie’s nappies all afternoon, your mum wouldn’t help because she was distracted by other news, maybe your brother planning an event, maybe him having some problem with alcohol. I know you want to sleep desperately, but you still have a feeding and a nappy change before your own bed time and are calculating how many hours of sleep you can get before Rosie wakes up for her four am feeding” Sherlock rattled.
“I was up”
“I talked to Mrs. Hudson” Sherlock bit his lower lip again and looked out the window, what if John didn’t want to live with him?
“As I was saying” Sherlock cleared his throat “Molly was on babysitting duty, but she left without warning” He cradled the baby closer “And I really have no idea what to do with a four months old baby” He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm his nerves.
That night, during their call, he told Sherlock about the offer and Sherlock told him in his very “subtle” way of telling things “You’re an idiot, John” and he smirked -how could John feel offended?- “Take the offer” He took a deep breath “They’re quite good” Sherlock bit his lower lip “They raised me… after all” he blushed and John was lost, all he could do was nod and the next day he asked Violet to keep Rosie until the weekend.
From a very, very young age, Sherlock knew he was different, and he enjoyed being different. Having a loving family made no difference to his never resting mind, he knew they were all different, that Eurus, at seven, was the best there was in math, her riddles almost undecipherable, except for him and Mycroft; that Mycroft at fifteen, was on his way to become one of the youngest men accepted to Oxford’s Law; and that he, himself, could be whatever he wanted to be, even a forensic scientist specialised in chemistry.
“There’s one… issue” John scratched the back of his neck
While John was in his lectures, Molly went to visit Sherlock carrying little Rosie. As soon as he saw the baby he felt a rush of panic and wanted to reach for her, barely managing to contain his worry and school his features. “John’s at school” Molly said as greeting; she was one of the few people that could read Sherlock almost to perfection “Babysitting duty for the day” She smiled down at the little baby “You said you wanted coffee so, here I am” She looked up with a bright smile.
“Call in sick, John… please?”
Sherlock stoically accepted the news, Irene was there to watch him crumble, after that, he focused on his classes and focused on forgetting the love he once had felt for a man that promised to be with him forever, but that had left him the moment he denied sex to him. Molly convinced Sherlock to come to the wedding, miss a couple of days from his Hilary and accompany her to Mary’s wedding. As an act of good faith, and because he was already ahead on his work for his third year, and probably advancing early to his fourth; Sherlock agreed.
Getting your morning tea and making toast.
Titus feels his skin start to burn in a way he's never felt before. His hair bristles and hes forced to stop playing; as he turns to see, he catches a glimpse of a blond head. His heart starts beating madly and for a second he thinks it's going to burst.
Need time… Out of town SH
Hours turned into days and days turned into weeks, the unspoken love growing deeper and more fulfilling every day. They visited each other every other weekend, talked and texted every single day and missed each other more than life. Rosie was growing beautifully and she already was starting to talk. She waited for a particular day to talk out loud -their first month together celebration- taking advantage that she was in Sherlock’s arms, looking out the window of Sherlock’s Oxford flat.
John pulled the hair, he needed to kiss that neck again… the moan that escaped that sensuous mouth was sinful, the dancer… Sherlock, was down on his knees, eyes wide open, lustful, mouth wet, angry red, almost purple, kissed and kissable…. John pulled him up and continued kissing and caressing…
“Boring” Sherlock shrugged and stopped, making John halt and turn to look at him questioningly. “I have to tell you something” Sherlock looked at John in that intense way that made John squirm. John closed his eyes, preparing for the worst when he felt Sherlock’s hand on his cheek, caressing softly, urging him, silently, to open his eyes again “Nothing too bad, don’t worry” Sherlock smiled softly and John took a deep breath.
"Like sleep, it also involves a bed," his voice melts my insides, my breath hitches and he smirks. "Bastard." I whisper and he just gives me a lopsided smile. I rub his scalp soothingly as a long and faded memory tries to emerge. Sherlock, my genius, senses it and effectively distracts me, kissing that spot on my neck that renders me senseless to everything but him. I'm lost in him, in me, in the kiss, in the need for more, in the now...
“A hard row to hoe”
They arrived to the crime scene and most of Greg’s team vacated the premises as soon as Sherlock and John arrived; he did his magic, looked around, stooped down, looked at the body, touched, smelled and much to John’s chagrin, tasted a few things. He started rattling information to Greg when he was called out, John followed to get the call from Mrs. H; it might be something about Rosie, and Sherlock was left alone with the body and the evidence.
With the car packed, they recruited a few other friends to help them move. They had to buy a better cot for Rosie, a larger bed for their bedroom and some more furniture. The furniture Mrs. Hudson provided was more than enough for the two of them, but they had a child to think of, a little girl that will soon be reaching for whatever she could.
He was ready for a new relationship, after all, Victor had ended things with him almost a year ago, and he wasn’t exactly interested in anybody.
Molly had another friend, Eurus Holmes, the gracious little sister of Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes. They met at nursery school and had been friends for the best part of fifteen years. Yes, Eurus is a genius, but the kind of genius that’s able to convince anyone to do anything, really, so Molly was convinced to be Eurus’ best friend for life. When Molly was fourteen, she was love struck, she fell immediately for the lanky, thin and gracious, raven curly headed boy. She loved his scowl, his newly developed baritone voice, the way he walked, talked and mocked everyone he met. That crush saved her from the heartache caused by John’s confession that he was in love with James.
And so, we read and accept.
“I still can take her away from you” Julia threatened again.
Once they left Tesco, John hoped for Sherlock to be more relaxed, he could see his jaw tightening as time went by, resolving it was the last time he would put Sherlock to the tiring and trying aisles of Tesco -as Sherlock so eloquently put it- although he knew it was about lunch with his family. In the walk back home, Sherlock’s mood went further south and he complained about the weather, hour of the day, the brightness -or lack thereof- of the sun. John simply shook his head and rolled his eyes, concentrating on his own nervousness.
"Must we be so... morbid?"
“And Rosie?”
Seventeen, perhaps younger, two kids for the count and a third on the way -not you- not yet anyway-. The minute I saw her I felt... love... such a deep love, and fear, so much fear... I lost you that day without knowing who you were, or why I felt the way I felt. I had no idea of you...
“That sure is an annoying sound” Sherlock said as soon as John was on screen.
They met at their usual, The Bench. It was slightly awkward at first but then John kissed Sherlock deeply and everything was settled, from the butterflies in their stomachs to the wrecked nerves.
“Starving” John sighed and pulled Sherlock for another kiss.
Hanno left the next month to train as a soldier.
When Mary met John, she was supposed to be tutored by him. She had problems with science and John was to help her, but it took ninety seconds for them to become something more than just tutor and tutored. In ninety seconds John smiled fondly at her, patted her shoulder and told her she was brilliant, and in ninety seconds, he broke her heart and mentioned James six times. In the first ninety seconds of their meeting, Mary felt attracted to the strong, tanned, ash blonde, blue eyed, rugby captain. John was flattered, to say the least, but his heart was elsewhere, as he explained in the next ninety seconds after meeting her. Yes, Mary was the girl every girl wanted to be like and every boy wanted to be with, that is except John Watson.
“When?” John played with his water cup; he had no idea what else to ask.
"As I was saying... writing?"
“Completely” John kissed him again and worked him more “Forever” Sherlock shivered and John stopped, briefly and let the feeling sink and settle
. John couldn’t help the smile. He felt lightheaded, his stomach was fluttering and his heart was thrumming restlessly in his chest. He took a deep breath and tried to concentrate, but all he could think about was Sherlock minding his baby daughter.
Mary gasped, her mother squealed, Ajay, Mary’s brother stood abruptly from the table and Alex looked at John, hope rising in his chest. John blinked twice and tried to focus; he couldn’t believe what he had just said, he was supposed to go visit Mary’s parents, accept his responsibility, pretend to be with Mary, have the baby and help her move out, that was it. He never planned on marrying her, but now the water was up to his neck…
"Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with woman; that is detestable... If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are both to be put to death, their blood will be on their own heads."
“You endanger her every chance you have, John” Julia replied, not caring the face her son made “You took her to visit some strangers, to France nonetheless, without telling us, you claim you have a boyfriend, which we haven’t met, not to mention you lied to us, telling us that she was your baby” Julia was in the brim of tears but John couldn’t care less.
S.O.S
"I want to delete him from your memory," my John mutters against my neck. I shiver and he smirks. "Looks like I already have," voice low, husky, seductive, and I feel it, like every time, like the first time, fire.
“Yeah” John beamed at the memory, even though it was a sad one “He works with the police, he has a friend there and helps him with cases. Right now he’s working with some cold cases and has solved a few already” John said proudly “He’s been accepted at King’s College to study a Master’s in forensics” He smiled widely “He just finished his chemistry studies in Oxford.
At some point, the always concerned Mycroft made his appearance at their flat, only to find the most heart-warming image one could ever imagine; the three of them sleeping on the sofa, Sherlock holding John close to his chest, his head on John’s head, his arm holding him tight. John slept soundly, snuggled at Sherlock’s chest, his nose in the crook of his neck, one hand resting protectively over his stomach and the other holding baby Rosie closely. Sherlock’s other arm over Rosie little stomach, they both holding her close, all three fast asleep,
By waiting.
"Callistus" feels, for the first time in many years, he feels, even the cold leaves his body. Every inch of his skin tingles, his mouth still savours the man he had this afternoon, he usually performs one act, never two or three, not even if they pay him to. The deed usually takes 40 minutes, between preparations and the mandatory cleaning; he then rests for 20 minutes and receives the next one. But today, he stayed with the same man for hours -not even getting paid, he returned the money to the stranger- and he enjoyed it. He wanted more.
"Why can't I remember your face? He asks with dismay.
I was a scribbler.
Hanno's father, Hiram, has several business deals with Malchus. The other, he doesn't recognise, probably one of Malchus' sons.
His hands slid up Sherlock’s legs, followed by his lips, up to his thighs, to the crease between his thigh and his groin, slow, teasing kisses that left Sherlock breathless.
Sounds harder than it is? Not at all. Is it easier than you believe? Not at all. We just wander blindly for eons, until we're able to truly see... And to truly see... Means you have to let go...
“Right” Sherlock nodded slowly “She was the one looking for newer, more… sturdier… wicks” Sherlock clicked his tongue and Mycroft sighed deeply, frustrated.
Eurus just exclaimed enthusiastically “Finally!” kissed him on the cheek, congratulated him and threatened Victor with castration if he hurt her little brother; Victor just nodded and then shook his head, not knowing what to do or say. Things went smoothly for the first six months, kisses, and daring touches over their clothes, a few ruined trousers, but never skin on skin. Sherlock was curious, of course he was, but when the moment of truth came, by his seventeenth birthday, he decided he didn’t want to go that far, at least not yet. Victor swore everything was right, that he understood completely, but Sherlock could feel the way Victor was slipping through his fingers. To avoid the pain that came with rejection, Sherlock started repeating the mantra Mycroft had told him after Redbeard, “caring is not an advantage”.
“So?” Sherlock croaked and John smiled.
Once they were done with Rosie’s room they ordered lunch for the troop, Rosie was already eating solids at eight months so they tried some rice with vegetables which Rosie enjoyed, not only tasting but sharing with the people around her. Eurus was fascinated with the little girl and tried to teach Rosie her name during the entire lunch, Rosie simply giggled and called her “Eee”
“Please, pick up, just… pick up” And the phone went to voice mail again “I can’t do this over the phone, Sherlock, please” He left another message filled with anguish, despair, and yet, a bit of hope
“Probably. May I get my daughter now?” John huffed.
“I’m proud of you son” Henry patted his back “Sorry for not telling you before” He closed his eyes and took a deep breath “You’re a great man, son” Henry smiled at him, an apologetic smile “I’m sorry for everything” John shook his head but Henry stopped him “I talked with your Mum yesterday” He looked at his wife “she said that if we didn’t get our heads out or our arses we might never see you again” John gave his father a reassuring smile.
The happy ending I promised. Long live Mofftiss and that wonderful ending. It was so open and it let so many opportunities in! From now on, now that I know what trully happened, I can keep writting them as I love them, happy and together, forever!!!
“Who?” John furrowed his brow and looked at him questioningly.
“Thank you” Sherlock hugged John and squeezed him, feeling utterly happy. He leaned close for a kiss and John held him even closer, his hands roaming Sherlock’s back, the kiss became more heated. John started pulling Sherlock towards his bedroom when the door to the flat opened and Mike and Bill came rushing in. John huffed and Sherlock sighed, they got used to the interruptions, Irene and Kate at Oxford, Bill, Mike, Molly and Greg in London; they needed their own place, luckily, they had it.
“I don’t know. Isn’t it too soon?” John frowned and put his head on his hands, taking a deep breath he looked at his friends “I have Rosie to think of” He fiddled with his phone, willing it to sound “What if it doesn’t work?” John shrugged. “Could I move back with you? What about Rosie? What do I do?” He started pacing in the small kitchen.
Memory?
“WHAT THE HELL?” John shouted as soon as he closed the cab door “EXPLAIN” he looked at Sherlock with murderous eyes
“Sherlock?” John tried and Sherlock’s eyes moved rapidly, much like when he was on a crime scene inside his mind palace.
They haven’t had sex -
“Tell me how?” John smiled broadly at him
John chuckled to the phone… Such a cute man.
I know... Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Procrastination and second chackra blockage... Two chapter today... Love you all and happy Sherlock!
…The music was soft at first; Sherlock had no idea what he was hearing. It was a cello but he didn’t recognise the piece. He had no idea when he closed his eyes, or when he had fallen asleep, the only thing he knew was that he was in his bed, a duvet over him -Surely Mrs. Hudson- and the cello music, more like the background of something else, a noise, a happy noise… His heart started thrumming in his chest, louder and faster, he couldn’t believe John had brought Molly back to their home, the home he shared with Sherlock and Rosie… OUR HOME!
“Finished the case?” John smiled.
… John’s hand was soft; his fingers short, but worked him open lovingly, almost worshiping his body. When Sherlock was ready, John looked at him again, wanting confirmation. A slight nod was enough, Sherlock took a deep breath and John’s thickness breached him slowly, filling him up with a desire he hadn’t know he had in him…
“Je sais, Mamie” Sherlock bit his lower lip and looked briefly in John’s direction.
In our haven, separations used to last milliseconds. We leave our soulmates, or go with them, live for a while, learn, enjoy, become and come back.
“Cons first?” Sherlock chuckled and John nodded “Rosie is six months old” Sherlock started
… John pulled him out of the bathtub and carried him to bed, trying not to break the kiss
He walked him to Mrs. Hudson's only to discover she was gone and his heart plunged to the floor, she was gone for a few days, so he was all alone… Molly wasn’t picking up her phone, his parents were out of England and his freaking husband was away, away from him… from them…
Thanks to
The answer is quite simple. Yes, you do.
He arrived to Oxford 4 a quarter past six and the first thing he saw as he climbed out of the train was Sherlock’s bright smile. He couldn’t believe it had only been a week since they last saw each other; he had missed him so much!
“Yep” Sherlock smiled and kept walking, John on his heels.
“Remember I told you he asked me to live with him when he finished University?” John let out a huff and drank half the lager in one long pull.
Sherlock realised he was lost in love with John during Saturday’s breakfast -how mundane-, the scene was so domestic that if Sherlock had been the witness to it instead of the lead, he would have scoffed and mocked the people sitting together at the tiny table, taking turns to feed each other and the baby, looking at each other with big googly eyes. Sherlock almost blurted his love when John stood up to do the dishes and kissed him on the forehead, he looked down at Rosie and contained himself, just barely.
“Not even going to ask” John shook his head in bemusement.
No, it wasn’t a bad beginning; actually, it was a great one.
The crowd grew larger, the music grew higher, and John was ready to make his way out… he had to leave to make it to London before midnight, with time enough to take a shower, get his shit together and be there for last call…
“And?” Eurus asked, even more exasperated now.
“I’m sorry” Sherlock grabbed John’s face and looked at him. “I’m so sorry” Sherlock breathed close to John’s lips
“Yes…”
We part ways and then return to each other, we always find each other, but at times, more often now than ever, it takes many lifetimes for us to find each other...
“He cleared my name” John would have laughed but the solemnity in Angelo’s face prevented him.
Mycroft had said he had fallen in lust at first sight, but Sherlock had figured -after a quite thorough wank- that it was more than just lust, because John consumed his every thought even more than Victor had done at the time; although,
“Il est spécial” Vivienne winked at Sherlock and he blushed.
“Don’t worry. Private plane” Sherlock was beaming and John could hear it.
As always, thank you for reading my rambling and sometimes boring and idiotic ideas... Love you all and Happy Sherlock!
“Just finished exams today” Sherlock returned the kisses and held John close.
At seven, John’s world was slightly shattered, he realised he was different and that his family might never understand him; after that day, he never felt like a real Watson. This reality came crashing on him at fifteen and with his first kiss ever. “Seven minutes in heaven” was the name of the game; the party was at the Sholto residency’s basement, his first party and Sarah, the first girl inside the closet waiting for him. He walked in, sweaty palms; twisted stomach and an excruciating desire to run the other way. Sarah’s lips were dry, her tongue was all over the place; she tasted like crisps and tomato basil dip; John had no idea what to do with his hands as he mentally counted the seconds for the seven minutes to be over, she pulled him a bit closer, his hands resting on her shoulders and hers travelling through his hair giving him a dishevelled look.
Mycroft opened the door and greeted him; one look over the young man gave all the information Mycroft was able to gather, much like Sherlock did, though he was better at reading emotions. The file was more explicit about John’s life; one steady boyfriend for over two years -James Sholto (UK special forces (check current file of conflict and check for security) unit to be assigned, going as INT CORPS); currently engaged to be married to Sherlock’s ex-boyfriend, Victor Trevor; wedding programed for July;
“I’ll miss you too” Sherlock heard John’s voice break and wanted to hold him until the sensation of pain and void faded away, not even when Victor had broken up with him he had felt this way, the feeling of absence, of loneliness that filled his heart was another thing, he wanted to curl up and never move again, but he knew that soon they’ll be together.
“He?” Violet Holmes grinned and Sherlock rolled his eyes but blushed furiously.
I have no idea how getting ahead works in UK Universities, but I guess it works the same, getting advanced classes, turning papers and taking exams (At least that’s how I did it…), so I’m furthering the freeform here and extending the freeform universe to Oxford.
“You listen to me, and listen clear” John pulled him closer “You so much as look in his direction and you’ll find, in the worst possible way, who will end up being the frigid bitch” He whispered close to Anderson’s face “Be warned, Phillip Anderson, fuck up once more and you’ll wish you never met him” He let go of Anderson and walked to Sherlock, standing next to him  before addressing Donovan “And you” She looked at him “Call him freak again…” he huffed, closed his eyes and turned to Sherlock “You okay, love?” Sherlock nodded “You’re not a freak, my love” John crushed him in a tight hug; Sherlock was trembling from arousal, unable to control his body any longer “Sure you’re okay?” Sherlock nodded again.
“The music. I’ve had sex” She replied and Sherlock understood what she was doing, she wanted to distract him, derail him, disturb him, but he knew better than to get in to a deeper discussion with his manipulative sister
“Why didn't you tell me?” Sherlock snarled, trying to keep his voice low, minding his daughter asleep on the sofa
“He has a new boyfriend” John breathed out shakily, eyes closed, fists clenched to the sides, Mary looked at him questioningly and John just took a deep breath and held it. Mary let out a little “oh” of realization and held him close, there was nothing else left to do. “He’s my age” John continued and Mary just listened “A Chemistry Bachelor. Apparently I’ve met him, but I don’t know who he is” John shivered and Mary helped him sit. “They met at the registration office” John’s voice was coarse, holding the sobs and his eyes prickled with tears “They’d been talking for months, even before classes started” John crumbled and Mary wanted to kill James, somehow she knew John “proposing” to her wasn’t reason enough for such a nasty break up.
Rosie brought them back to reality with a shrill cry of excitement when Mrs. Hudson made her appearance, they had no idea how long she might have been there but they were soon out of their own reveries and paying attention to the little girl who was now covered in banana puree and honey from her ears. John sighed and picked her up, nodding politely to Mrs. Hudson who just looked at him adoringly.
“It’s big enough for the three of us” John shrugged.
He found a letter from the Army telling him he was a reserve, that in case he was needed he’ll be called for training; they were willing to help him with his child and wife and congratulated him on his upcoming nuptials. If only they knew… John took a deep breath and rocked Rosie; it was time for her bath. He pulled his phone out and took the piece of paper and put it away, for the time being, maybe a little distance could help; after all, he had to concentrate on his readings for Human Development.
And then, the memory hits me like a train... Are there trains yet?
“Hello, John” Sherlock smiled and held him close.
"Oh God!" I feel my John tremble and embrace him closer, some memories too hurtful. "I... I paid... for you..." He sobs in my neck. I feel desperate, I have to tell him.
“Yes” Sherlock cleared his throat and looked out the window, then closed his eyes for a few seconds and focused again on John “I’ve a few news” He bit his lower lip and looked at the candle in the middle of the table “Remember a week ago, I came to visit and I told you about Oxford?” John nodded and the shook his head, as if trying to clear his memories. Sherlock took a deep breath “Remember I told you I was basically done with University?” Sherlock tapped his fingers on the table. John shook his head again “I told you that I’ve managed to complete the entire programme, including my research. I’ve talked to my professors and…” He hoped John wouldn’t be angry “I’ve finished University, graduation could be in July” He gave John an awkward smile and waited.
, relatively close to the cold ocean, memories of that magical afternoon, a lute and a beach always on his mind.
John also could spend hours watching Sherlock, endless hours of watching this sweet man sleep, the way his face would tell him everything while he was unguarded in his sleep. He looked younger, fragile, sweeter, his features smooth and soft, those lips pursed in an eternal “kiss me” way, riotous curls spilled over their white pillow cases and limbs, so many limbs clinging to him, soft breathing on his neck, and those eyes, when open, amazing eyes that looked at everything with wonder, curiosity and so much knowledge at the same time. Sherlock’s eyes fascinate John, he could spend endless hours watching those eyes shift colour with every passing hour, how they looked in the middle of the morning while looking after Rosie, a luminous blue when the sun was up, or a soft green when the light was just right and muted. Unfathomable eyes that looked at his soul and smiled, smiled! at him! whenever he was near or close; the same eyes that got lost behind dilated pupils in the throes of passion.
“As I already told you, I promised Mary I will help her, she was very clear, as soon as she found out she was pregnant, she asked me to help her; her family took everything out of proportion and her parents were the ones that forced us to get married” John wanted to punch something.
The afternoon usually means nap time, potty training or a change of nappy, a quick clean-up and a change of clothes; a bit of chamomile tea with honey and a two hour nap, helped by the music Sherlock has recorded for her. After nap time, she would spend the afternoon with her grandparents, the Holmes, the Watsons or the Morstans, at least three hours every single afternoon, giving a bit of a rest to their young parents.
“Not coming?” John couldn’t hide the disappointment and the confusion, why was Sherlock saying goodbye, today, of all days? Sherlock shook his head and schooled his features to appear calm, but John noticed “Why?” John asked and the answer was interrupted by the cabbie grunting a “well?” That had Sherlock helping John in the cab and closing the door after him and rattling John’s address. John barely had time to look back and see Sherlock climb in the back of a black sedan.
I was a scribbler and had just heard of King Amyrtaeus' death; a couple of days later I was called to write about his successor, Nepherites... I mean... Nefaarud The First. Something happened on my way to him and I couldn't make it to Mendes, that day I heard about Socrates... The last I remember is a voice, asking me to wait. Next time I opened my eyes I was twenty five, half a century had passed since I last died, 344 B.C. The day of my twenty fifth birthday I sort of had my first memory of you, your voice asking me to wait.
my mind supplies... but which one?
“Love, I accept it’s over, I understand why now… I’m really sorry I couldn’t be the man you deserve, the man you need, the man you want… I’m really sorry…” his voice broke and he let the dam crumble “I’m not man enough to love you… I never was…” He choked on the last word “I’ll never be” he sobbed and tried to breathe “I love you, Sherlock, forever… Even if I don’t know how” He ended the call and walked back to Baker Street, packed all his belongings and called Anthea
The silent communication they had shared since they met became clearer, more intimate; more certain. One look, one touch, one smile, just the movement of a hand and they would know how the other was, that familiarity now heightened by the union of their bodies and the way they had shared each other. Sherlock sighed happily and John couldn’t help but feel his chest fill with joy and he laughed, hard and loud, a bout of laughter that had Sherlock laughing along, happily.
"Come."
“I have to go, love”
“Me?” John looked quizzically at his father.
, before Sholto’s deployment to Iraq- about eighty something one night stands after the break up -at least 10 every month since two months after the breakup and until he met Sherlock,
Mycroft felt calmer after the visit, a big weight lifted from his chest. His biggest worry was that Sherlock might find domestic life boring; he had seen him at his best and at his worst, and quite frankly, he couldn’t help but worry and think about the time his brother might do something stupid, put at risk the life he had created and blow things with John, harming them in the way. He had to admit to himself that he was wrong, that Sherlock had found what he needed, even though he complained of being bored when a week passed and he didn’t have a case, or when John’s wasn’t around and Rosie was at her grandparents.
“As soon as I arrive to London you and Rosie move in with me” John gaped and looked up at Sherlock, feeling like a fish out of the water, trying to catch a breath and reconnect his brain to his mouth.
He knows he's not allowed to touch himself, but he can't help it, he can still feel the tightness surround him, quivering and bringing him to orgasm, then that velvety mouth, doing such delicious things, and once again, tight heat surrounding him. He'd never had sex with the same woman (or man) twice, much less in the same visit, but this time... this time he couldn't get enough, he never felt more... loved... more... alive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course…” Mary bit her lip and glanced to the side, considering the “issue”, John’s boyfriend, James “Perfect” Sholto. Even though she loved James and respected their relationship, she was desperate, scared, alone… she was seventeen after all… and in 90 seconds her life turned upside down; instead of planning her years at Cambridge, she was planning on lying to her parents, tell them the baby was John’s and have John, her best friend in the entire world, to lie for her and put his current life at risk, because her life changed in 90 seconds.
He told his parents he was going to be the first pirate with a university degree in Chemistry. Violet laughed and ran a hand over his unruly curls, Siger told him he could be anything he put his mind to and Mycroft rolled his eyes, but read to him, every night, Treasure Island; Eurus shared those brotherly times sitting close to her bothers, although her dreams drifted towards becoming whatever her brothers wanted to be, so a chemist, a lawyer, a scientist, you name it, she’ll be.
Months went by and life became sweeter than it had been, now that sex was part of their life; they got a new way to get to know each other. Sherlock was amazed, every single day, by how much he ignored still about John, every single day he got to discover something new about his lover, his boyfriend, his best friend, his flatmate, the student, the future doctor, the father… the man. Sherlock could sit, for endless hours and watch in fascination, how John moved, when he reached for their cups in the morning, how he made breakfast, the way the muscles on his shoulders shifted under his shirt, or how his legs looked under his scrubs. Sherlock also observed the way he talked, the way his lips quirked when he talked about something he liked, or how his lips would give away his anger, disgust, frustration, at something he couldn’t solve or understand, how his eyes illuminated whenever he saw Rosie, or that special smile he had just for her, but Sherlock would find that every day, John had a new gesture, a small twitch, a slight frown… there is always something, something new, exciting and marvellous about John, and yes, Sherlock could watch him, in fascination, for endless hours.
. The reply came seconds later; John had to do a major effort to stop his fingers from trembling.
“A condition?” Sherlock’s frown deepened.
“Before” Sherlock whispered and he bit his lower lip, looking away “He was friends with Victor” Sherlock muttered and John could feel anger flowing like boiling lava in his veins.
“I can’t do it like this anymore…” John rubbed his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles; taking the opportunity life was giving him “I was so afraid to tell you…” He sighed and looked at Sherlock’s blueish-greenish eyes and got lost in them “I was so afraid that if you knew I was… failing… you’ll leave me again…” John confessed and Sherlock pulled him into a hug
“That’s very brave of you” Mycroft actually smiled “I wonder” Mycroft took a deep breath “What if Mary was alive?”
As best friends, they were always there for each other. Mary was there for John the day he came out to his parents, she was there when Harry called him a fag, and she was there to hold him when James ended their relationship and was there to comfort him when they ran on the street and he met James’ new boyfriend. As much as Mary was there, John was there for her too. Since they shared their most intimate secrets, John was the first to know Mary was pregnant and was ready to punch the lights out of David; unfortunately, he was nowhere to be found so John had to get satisfaction from punching the lights out of a ball and throwing it to the ground with as much force as he was able to muster.
“I already told you, I’ve talked to my professors, I’ll just have to present my project, deliver a compelling paper for each lecture and I could be done before next Michaelmas, including lab hours” He frowned “I might have to work over Summer break and I’ll be out of University by September” He looked at John as if willing him to say yes.
“We can go very slowly” John breathed over Sherlock’s nipple.
"It's been a long day." I sigh, exhausted, Sherlock is in the kitchen finishing the dishes, for once. I watch him close the tap and reach for the tea towel, turning to face me.
“Tomorrow?” Sherlock looked down at the table. The moment turned a bit awkward, but before Sherlock could ask, Billy, the waiter came with their food.
The music began and Sherlock started moving his hips, swaying them rhythmically. He started his part
She let them in to the flat and John stood there for a while contemplating their new home; Sherlock had dumped his stuff haphazardly all over the place, boxes filled with book, cases with his chemistry set and his microscope. A bed with a mattress lay on one wall next to five suitcases and a trunk containing Sherlock’s clothes. John’s boxes and suitcases were placed near the window, next to a desk and a couple of chairs. The cot they had ordered that morning had already arrived -“Mycroft helped”, Sherlock explained quietly- and it was standing next to another door.
John found out through a couple of friends that this “Anderson chap”, as some of his friends referred to the moron, was harassing Sherlock; even though John was annoyed, there wasn’t much he could do, except support his beautiful boyfriend -tell his brother in law, even though Sherlock had no idea he wanted to propose- and reassure him that he wasn’t a freak, that he was clever, a genius and that he had earned the right to be where he was. Sherlock tried with all his might not to listen, not to care, but being with John, since John, he couldn’t be as cold and hard as he once was.
“I thought you were just joking when you said you were bored” He looked away
“Mycroft’s”
“Love you too, Mum” John kissed her cheek “See you soon”
Sherlock cleared his throat and continued talking “When I was dating Victor, he somehow managed to find about this” he tapped the documents “After that, he kept on insisting I had sex with him” Sherlock blushed “I tried, once, but I was too nervous and when he started kissing me and groping me I felt disgusted, a few weeks later he broke up with me, his friends said it was because I didn’t “put out”, that he had lost a bet and that the only reason he was with me was because of my money” Sherlock closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “I…” John shook his head.
“What if I want to?” Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest and pouted.
“So happy together”
Sherlock frowned at the offensive screen.
Sherlock read it out loud and John smirked “Come here, my gorgeous genius” John pulled him for yet another kiss before ravishing him once again.
A thousand years, I've waited for a thousand years. My body has seen war, famine, disease, pain... unbearable pain. My fingers have gone through many bodies, all dead ones; and my soul... my soul has wandered alone for over a thousand years.
Rosie’s schedule was what moved them, crime scenes, shifts and nappy changes were programmed to the clock and they tried to keep the routine for their sake. Sherlock would help John with his readings, getting him journals and checking patient files, whilst John would help him with cold cases and real crime scenes. If they both had to leave the flat, Mrs. Hudson would be more than willing to help them with Rosie, and when not, there was always Molly, and even Eurus and Jim would come and help them.
The first kiss was a surprise, they hadn’t even shared their names and he had that sweet tongue exploring his mouth with an eagerness that could only be compared to his own…
Souls make love.
“An arse that’s marrying John’s ex” He sniffed.
“Sherlock” A deep, baritone voice responded… John felt his knees go weak and let go, kissing back with all he had… His hands started exploring up and down that lean body, firm arse, glut… strong back… long legs… a delicious neck… and soft, soft hair…
Souls have a way to find each other... sometimes a little too late...
“He called the police on me” Mary sighed and burrowed closer in John’s arms
Us, soulmates, as you might've already guessed, always come in pairs. And us, as a pair...
John looked down for a moment and then back at Rosie “I don’t know… Maybe I’ll be moving in with Sherlock. Mary and I talked about it, we were going to stay married for a year and then divorce, get the chance to fall in love, to move on. We were pretty clear that the wedding was a sham, just to get her parents of her case. I never imagined…” John rubbed his temple.
“I didn’t”
As the butterfly’s wings caused an earthquake in a lost island in the middle of the ocean, and an underwater volcano to erupt in that precise moment; it took a corpse, a crying baby and a failed wedding for John to meet Sherlock.
John was summoned by Greg to the Starbucks on Broadway at 4pm. The young sergeant, who was now around 23 years old, had become John’s friend out of sympathy at first, and then out of pure interest and concern. They’ve talked several times, Greg even offering to take care of Rosie; that’s how, during one of Greg’s babysitting shifts, he met Molly and he fell for the young student; that’s how he found out all about Sherlock asking for John every chance he got -meaning every day, at least twice a day- and that’s how he devised a plan, considering John asked for Sherlock every time he met with Greg.
Kanmi is sixteen, his father will send him to Greece to study at the
Once they overcame the shock and Greg left them alone under false pretences, Sherlock made the first move and asked him if he wanted some coffee. John nodded and Sherlock brought back the perfect cup of black coffee, no sugar and just a hint of milk. He wondered how Sherlock knew, but after hearing him solve Mary’s case in less than a minute, he knew he shouldn’t be surprised with his insight about him.
The night prior, John had called them and they agreed to come for lunch at their flat. They started the day by asking Mrs. Hudson to help them with Rosie while they went shopping for lunch with the Watsons. Sherlock was nervous and he tried all he could to distract himself, from doing a half an hour research on brands of salt to a full on strop in front of the beef and chicken. John managed to get all they needed in the meantime but had to go back and find his lovely genius having a break down in front of the ice creams.
“Because James’ fiancé is Sherlock’s ex!” Molly almost shouted.
The world had seen its first dawn and souls wandered on their own until they found their mates. Once the miracle happens, they would hold "hands" and would be joined in an eternal embrace.
“What is it to you?” Sherlock pouted.
“Vouz approuvez?” The only approval Sherlock ever asked for and even wanted was Mamie’s, he loved her deeply.
“Take me home” Sherlock whispered in his ear, low voice, filled with desire that made John shiver. John simply grabbed his hand and pulled him out of the crime scene. Greg looked at them quizzically and John just shook his head. Sherlock looked at Greg and mouthed “Laters” Greg couldn’t help the chuckle and when he saw Anderson, he understood what had happened.
When the music started, Mary was supposed to be walking down the aisle, her father was waiting for her outside the room she was changing in. after five minutes of music and no signal of his daughter coming out, he knocked on the door only to receive no answer. He tried to open the door but it was locked from the inside. He knocked again, harder this time, and all he heard was a small thud from the inside and nothing more.
Clothes flying all over, dressing gowns, jumpers, jeans and tailored trousers, purple shirts… red pants… Eyes met eyes and bodies met bodies, the kissed slowed down to give the hands a chance to feel the skin under eager fingertips, getting to know uncharted territory, feeling scars, soft and hard edges, savouring, slowly and thoroughly every inch of each other
“I didn’t ask for that either” John cocked his head to the side and gave Sherlock an annoyed look.
“Well…” John moved the baby to his other arm and Sherlock opened his arms as if offering to carry the baby. John accepted the silent offer and was marvelled by the tenderness with which Sherlock carried little Rosie “All of the above are quite hard” He licked his lips, tasting the slightly bitter coffee “Being a single parent isn’t easy but I have an excellent support system. My mum is great help and so are Molly and Greg, just to name a few names”
He finally managed to check his assignments and realised he’ll have to pull an all-nighter for his Friday lectures -the disadvantages of returning on Thursday instead of the same Sunday after the wedding, but he got to solve a murder, even though it meant he’d missed a week of lectures- he checked the basics of the assignments and outlined them, after all, he still had forty minutes to go. He could always skip lab time before going to Structural Methods with Professor Clarke in the afternoon, and work during the lecture the rest of the assignment; he’ll read Robertson and Edward’s pages that night…
“I’m here to tell you I’m responsible” He took a deep breath and lied to him.
. Beautiful city, incredible fishing spots, amazing beaches. Two souls that find each other, without knowing their journey together, in this world, has just started.
“I think about you day and night, it’s only right”
The eyes moved lower… lower… he kept his eyes on that mouth and he saw the moment when curiosity turned into lust… John’s dick jumped, greeted the new acquaintance and was eagerly suggesting they left as soon as possible, no matter where, JUST GO! The mercurial eyes disappeared behind dark pupils; John dared look down and was greeted by the dancer’s eager erection…
John looked at the time and all he wanted was to sleep but still had the 10 pm feeding and nappy change.
“I’m just saying she’s just six months old. I can’t pick up and leave without her” John sighed.
One of the many faceless soldiers, no family, no friends. MEAT... and a wandering soul. Can't remember the year, but I remember the ache, all over my body, my heart clenching, my gut wrenching, hands quivering, a faceless being asking me to wait. WAIT!
Back in Baker Street, they danced until dawn, sharing kisses and caresses, holding each other close, taking their time, not turning the other on. The first few weeks after they made up they kept at it like rabbits (excuse the pun…) every single touch was fire, every single look was lust, every chance they had they’ll be at each other, kissing, fondling… etcetera… With time, they created their own routine and after four months of being back together, John proposed and Sherlock proposed at the same time, they both chuckled and said yes. They planned a small ceremony and got married a month later.
It turned out that Sherlock was pretty much done with university, that if he wanted to leave he could, with one condition, doing four graduate lectures before his Trinity was over and that was that; Sherlock had managed to advance in his Chemistry degree pretty quickly; an amazing discovery made him happier than ever; all the effort he had put on focusing on his classes and practices -after the breakup- meant he had finished his credits early, both in music and chemistry; all he had to do were four more credits to finish his dance degree and the four lectures; with that, he’ll be done even before he imagined. By the beginning of June his plan was approved, he assisted to two more lectures, doing six instead of four and his graduation was to be by the second week of July, meaning John could be there with him.
“Sure you didn’t deduce him?” John chuckled and Sherlock furrowed his brow, looking up at his boyfriend with an offended expression “Sorry, love.” John looked contrite.
I knos, I know, it's been almost a month since I last published and I'm very sorry but RL can be quite shitty and throw you to the bushes without much preamble or explanation. I won't bore you with details, suffice to say that I'm back and kicking it, expect daily updates this week, until I'm back on schedule.
“Of course it’s for men! I’m wearing it!”
“What?” Even in the position he was Sherlock maintained his cool demeanour, even though he was trembling “Tell you the truth?” He chuckled darkly “You’ve never been good at handling the truth; everything has to be sugar-coated for you. You’re always the victim, the one that suffers, that never gets a chance to be happy… Your happiness always depends on others, never on you… Nice thing never being responsible for your own actions” He grabbed John’s trembling wrists and removed them from his collar “Lucky you to always have somebody to blame for whatever goes wrong with your life” Sherlock pushed him away
John had to remind himself he was grieving for the loss of his friend and future wife, but he couldn’t find in himself to look away from the celestial creature that had approached him and was looking at him as if he had found something precious, a hidden treasure worth all his attention. Blue/green eyes with pupils blown wide bored over him, he noticed the strangers pulse, it was erratic, his eyes got lost for a second on the bobbing Adam’s apple going up and down as the stranger swallowed, and swallowed hard, filling John’s mind with all sorts of ideas and desires; the stranger had difficulty breathing, short deep breaths and shorter exhales, startled and interested …
“Out! Out! Out!” Rosie rejoiced and John couldn’t help but laugh. They ended up at the Botanic Garden. Still stunned all they did was walk, hand in hand, while Rosie squealed at everything she saw, shouting “Out!” and “Daddy” every now and then.
“Yes” Sherlock nodded and kept his eyes on the people walking outside the window, his mind providing information relentlessly “She said I could have the flat” He mumbled.
“I guess time with your parents helped” John chuckled and caressed her little curly head.
“So? What?” John looked at her questioningly.
“Would you like to have breakfast? Sherlock asked before he closed the door. John nodded and waved a goodbye, looking back at the man he so wanted to kiss.
“Mate!” Bill’s brow furrowed and looked at John with mocked annoyance.
"Always the writer." Sherlock chuckles and I feel it in my chest. I blush and he rubs my knee, encouraging me to keep talking.
They made some small talk on the way, John telling Sherlock how his lecture went, about the military, the letter he’d received and how the people at the RAMC told him they would wait. Sherlock let out a relieved sigh when he heard John wasn’t joining the military, at least not yet. Sherlock told John that he’ll be done with school in a year, that he was thinking on going into full detective work as soon as he finished, but that he was interested in studying a bit of forensic sciences before definitely dedicating his time to Detective work.
“I haven’t done a thing to that man, he’s an arse” Sherlock pouted.
“I’ve missed you too” John held him closer and kissed his neck “And I love you, so much” He lay another kiss to his forehead.
We souls share a particularity, or peculiarity? We... become... as soon as we're acknowledged as something, we become. We become... something... sometimes we're written, others, just imagined, and more often than not, we're born.
The kiss lasted a long while, lips coming together and never coming apart. No oxygen was needed when all the air the bodies demanded was the one the other provided. The romantic side of John was flipping and turning, doing somersaults and dancing to the drums by the fire. Sherlock discovered he had a romantic side and couldn’t find a better scenario for a first kiss than the sunset, at the top of the Eiffel tower, right in Paris. When the kiss was over, when they finally broke apart, the light in Sherlock’s eyes could illuminate the entire world, much like the smile on John’s lips. Neither could believe they had waited so long to kiss.
Hanno runs faster, he can hardly breathe. He feels immensely happy, full of life. He tries to catch a glimpse of the men, but he is too late.
His eyes landed on a tall brunette, his curls were wild and… perfect… his body, sinful… he wiggled and swayed, he said something in French and then started singing, and John’s world stopped, because those maddening eyes were looking at him, singing to him, enticing him… He went the entire week to see him, but whenever he wanted to approach him, he was being seduced by another man and John would leave without a word.
“Wow” John was astonished “that… was amazing!” he exclaimed and smiled.
He chuckled and wanted to see the face Sherlock did
, and this might be the last he sees his son, after all, he's close to sixty. Kanmi is learning to fish... boring... but he indulges his father who's setting the lines and patiently teaches his youngest to place the barb correctly, before showing his renown "arc" and the correct way to strike, before boarding the boat. A servant will paddle.
“Explain yourself, young man” Mummy’s voice didn’t give him a choice.
He scrambled out of the bed and looked at John “No” He snarled “Not like that” He rested his head on the bathroom door but didn’t dare to leave the room “You can’t just come in here and try to make me feel good, or needed, only to leave again when you think it convenient” He closed his eyes “I’m done with this, with you” Sherlock’s voice broke “I don’t want to be a replacement for…” He still couldn’t say her name “I don’t want to be just a body to warm you… or to satisfy your need” He was trembling “I don’t want this flat to be just a place for you to stay when convenient, or me becoming a sitter to your daughter while you… gallivant around” Sherlock finished with a shudder and he felt his knees about to give but held the door behind him
“John” he managed to whisper between gasps and the next kiss
“You threatened to take her away from me” John yelled.
“That’s the point, Bee!” Eurus complained.
"Just come?" John extends his hand and I just take it, going willingly to whenever he leads, because I trust him. And John, my John, takes my hand and squeezes it softly, acknowledging the trust, guiding me.
“THAT’S NOT THE POINT!” John shouted “That’s not the point” He shook his head “The point is that you lied to me… you hid the truth from me…” He rubbed his forehead with his fingers. Sherlock was baffled; he was to blame for everything that was happening between them
The morning of the wedding John was feeling nervous, he was about to perform the biggest lie ever. He was to commit, until death parted them, to Mary, his best friend. Less than twelve hours ago he had agreed to have flings, romances and relations, breaking the vows of marriage even before making them… He was a mess, everything in his life was about to change in less than 90 seconds…
“How far you want to go?” John travelled up, getting ready to give Sherlock whatever he wanted.
Mike pointed to the stage and said “I know three of the performers” And he pointed to the man that was currently acting the role of Charity “He’s a nurse at Bart’s” he kept talking lowly and John just nodded and stifled a yawn. The play continued and Mike pointed to the other man, the one playing Charlie “Charlie” Mike pointed to a tall, blonde dancing “Is my wife’s cousin”.
They don’t see life through a pink glass, but through Rosie’s eyes.
Their morning started with Rosie calling for daddy. John startled awake and looked around him trying to figure out where in the hell he was, not having anything but a few unpacked boxes and Sherlock’s warm body next to his to make him realise he was home.
“You did go to prison” Sherlock clarified.
“Very” John took a deep breath and leaned his head on Sherlock’s, his hand going up and down over Sherlock’s back, the scars no longer triggers to memories now that he knew how he got them “Are you happy?” John kissed Sherlock’s forehead and let his hand wander further down
Yes, they love her to pieces, and they both know that having her in their lives makes everything better, worthy of any sacrifice; because as Sherlock so eloquently put it once, while he washed all the mashed potatoes from his hair “life will be dull without her, John”
“Yeah, when a man I thought was my friend started fucking my boyfriend” John grunted “I would never do that to him” John answered sadly.
“What for?” Sherlock looked at him curiously
Sherlock snorted “I was the perfect drug until you found her, and after that you settled in what you think would make you happy” Sherlock continued his verbal attack with a low voice too “The moment you realised you needed more, here I was, waiting for you, as always…” He took a deep breath “You had what you needed, the wife for romance and the friend for adrenaline” He laughed a dry sarcastic laugh
First times -spectacular first times- belong in books, to literary romantic heroes. The veiled, yet somehow arousing descriptions of how a hand travels up and down a leg and finds its way back to a backside or to a nape, are just part of embellished romantic stories from the nineteenth century, or part of salacious, erotic novels that can be quite descriptive of a sexual, turned romantic, encounter between two bodies -usually a man and a woman- that finally unleash their passions.
"He used to say... that if I showed my face they'll never leave. Only the ones that paid top money and asked for me daily had that privilege, he... he sometimes charged them for just seeing my face..." I grimace and my John kisses my cheeks.
“What?” John couldn’t believe what he was hearing “Does he know?”
They talked for hours, both minding Rosie and sharing some food and tea instead of coffee. The waitress came with their check at closing time and John invited Sherlock to come over to his flat. Sherlock accepted gladly, but to John’s dismay Bill and Mike were home so Sherlock offered to visit the next day and take John for coffee. Reluctantly, even though happily, John accepted and walked into his flat, wishing he had kissed Sherlock instead of giving him such a lame goodbye.
He heard a conversation between John, Mike and Bill, one night they visited the happy couple.
“Sherlock Holmes” John smiled lopsidedly “Would you like to be my boyfriend?” John’s blush deepened
That Friday, he gave his last exam and left University feeling the happiest he had ever felt since he started dating John. It had taken him less than four months to finish University and he felt quite proud of himself, mostly because it meant he had managed to finish something as utterly boring as University. He arrived to London four hours after his last exam, having packed everything he needed and after giving notice to his landlord he left his Oxford flat for the last time. The first person he contacted was Mrs. Hudson -he had already given Baker Street as his address to the moving team- and she was expecting him.
He still remembered the night they met, Sherlock couldn’t take his eyes off of him and he sang the entire song for him, his every gesture; his every line was directed to the stranger that was currently occupying his every thought… That night, and every following night after that, he had sent him flowers and had signed the card with two single letters,
John tried not to grimace and act as nonchalant as possible “And these business” John cleared his throat before continuing “Are about the case in Florida?” he asked, instead of asking what was on his mind, if Sherlock was interested in him or not.
A restless night for both; Rosie woke up three times, two nappy changes, three feds and John found himself drinking coffee and reading for his first class of the morning, nursing a cup of tea and wishing he had turned the heating sooner. As for Sherlock, he spent the night up, reading for his lectures and preparing the assignment, nursing a cup of tea, and wishing he was back in London, struggling with the heating, it was too hot to even think, but he considered his options, and freezing to death wasn’t part of his plans.
“John” John tried to hide the disappointment and held his hand out.
“Yes” Sherlock smiled and practically leapt from his chair to kiss John.
"I had just learned how to fish, father taught me. I was standing there, watching the ocean, waiting for father to prepare the fishing gear; when a sudden rush of happiness overcame my every sense. I couldn't concentrate on father's words, I had no idea why I felt that way."
“I can hardly wait to see you come of age”
“I missed you” He leaned down for a kiss and hugged him close “God I’ve missed you” He nuzzled his neck and inhaled deeply
“Rosie” She pointed to the rose and all they could do to not faint was stare at each other and smile like idiots. The afternoon turned into night, Rosie yawned and they took her back to the flat, before she fell asleep, she took Sherlock’s finger in her hand and squeezed “Dada” she said and seconds later, after staring for over a minute to Sherlock’s astounded expressions, she fell asleep with a content sigh; her mission was done, she had started to talk.
The day, 29 January 410 A.C.
“I don’t want to interrupt” John’s voice was clipped, his breathing short “I’ll call you when I can” He said but Sherlock stopped him.
“But I guess we’ll both just have to be patient” He pursed his lips,
“Are you happy?” Sherlock asked as he caressed John’s chest lower and lower each time
"Truly old scores and resentments." John bites his lower lip trying not to laugh, but I can see the mirth in his eyes.
“The constable was very nice” Mary smiled and looked up at John, John simply rolled his eyes “None of that, he’s too old for me” She chuckled and made John chuckle “Maybe Molly will fancy him” John shook his head and held her again, feeling less sad somehow “We have to tell your parents” She took a deep breath and broke apart the hug before holding his hand.
John listened to the advice, said goodbye to Sherlock and he slept, soundly, for over two hours, Rosie on his chest. At 10 pm, at the clock, Rosie woke up and demanded attention; and as promised, Sherlock was there to accompany John while he feed his daughter. They chatted until both Rosie and John fell asleep. Sherlock didn’t want to close the screen and watched them sleep until tiredness overtook him and he slept soundly until Rosie’s cries woke him up at three in the morning.
“You very well know what it is, Lord Holmes” Mycroft rolled his eyes at his brother “Hand delivered, as requested, with the mandatory congratulations” Mycroft smiled fondly at his brother “Mummy and Daddy are very proud of you, just as much as I am” He patted Sherlock’s shoulder and Sherlock looked down to the envelope once more, hiding his blush and his bashful smile “Bug called, said she couldn’t reach you, so did Mamie; they are both very proud”
But as they say, happiness usually is short lived, especially when you’re seven going on eight, his sense of pride and joy lasted exactly the time it took his father to tell his mother of his choice, she had cried, called him a silly boy, “too young to think properly about what you want, I’m sure by tomorrow you’d have forgotten all about this silly story of you becoming a fighter’s doctor”, she mocked him. John’s little heart broke that day and decided never to share his dreams and hopes with his mother, ever again.
We never saw each other." John mutters, catching his breath once he resurfaces from the memory. I just nod and wander if he looked as beautiful then, that day on the beach, as he looks now.
He was supposed to board that train. He was supposed to follow Bill and the gang and go back to London, back to headquarters, back to Afghanistan for the third time.

“My grades?” Sherlock mocked interest.
This time, oh this time! The lazy universe has intertwined their lives, but centuries still, to be what they are to be...
Sherlock placed the baby in the cot, again, and went down to get his violin, the squealing getting worse as soon as he left the room. He decided to play some Mozart, but Hamish was having none of it,
"Actually..." I push him softly, so he's sitting facing me on the sofa, he looks back at me, "I put the money back in your pouch; you were asleep for a few moments, your back to me. I wanted so much to see your face. I wanted you to see mine... but... his rules... I could see the ones that paid top money, so I would be... familiar."
At fifteen, Sherlock confessed his attraction towards Victor to his sister; Eurus just shrugged and said, as nonchalantly as she was able “Already knew it”. Sherlock looked at her wide eyed and gaped several times “Don’t worry Bee” She whispered close to his ear “Secret’s safe with me” and she winked in his direction before leaving him alone. At sixteen, he couldn’t control his attraction anymore, but he was rewarded with the best of news when Victor kissed him for the first time in Mummy’s greenhouse. The kiss smelled like mummy’s roses and gardenias and it sounded like the buzzing bees that flew around the flowers. Sherlock was ecstatic, a huge smile on his lips. He told Eurus all about it and she warranted she’ll keep the secret until he was ready to tell Mummy and Papa.
“Nope” John shook his head “But I’m happy with the situation. I know that when it happens it will be…” John took another deep breath “spectacular” he whispered and had a dreamy look on his face.
It had been two months since the breakup, everyone tried to get them back together, to have them talk.
John left the interrogation room and followed Lestrade to his office; he was tired and all he wanted was a hot bath, climb to bed with Rosie and sleep for a week; but at the same time, all he wanted was to find the force of nature that had infested his dreams -in the best possible way- for the past three days, he wanted to see Sherlock Holmes again. To his dismay, the boy was nowhere to be seen and the Sergeant explained to a disappointed John that the boy, well, man, he was referring to had to go back to school, in Oxford. The news crashed in his ears and crushed his body like a lorry. Lestrade eyed him curiously and as John blushed, Lestrade smirked and handed him a phone number “Just in case you need any help” he said, and winked at the man.
“Because I’ve just met him” Sherlock huffed “He’s basically a stranger”
“We’ll both have full schedules, you’ll start your rotations, it will get harder with time” John nodded “We can manage” Sherlock said firmly and John nodded again, smiling at him.
“What? No!” Molly started getting angry “Eurus just called me” She sighed deeply.
As for John, the week was hellish too. He had a fight with his entire family when he announced he was taking Rosie all the way to Oxford to visit his boyfriend. His father yelled, his brother almost punched him, his mother cried the entire afternoon; “so there goes the only people available to help me with Rosie”, John muttered when he told Sherlock about what had happened during their night call.
"Taking your own life. Interesting expression, taking it from who? Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it. Your own death is something that happens to everyone else.  Your life is not your own, keep your hands off it."
After a heartfelt conversation with his parents, he made them understand that he wasn’t damaged, that he wasn’t a fag, “not the correct vernacular, father”; and that if they wanted for him to go to military school he’ll go more than happy, after all, he hadn’t forgotten he wanted to be a military doctor. In the end, they accepted that their son just had… different… interests and that he had been bullied enough by his peers, misunderstood by his friends, and last, but not least, rejected by his family. His parents understood, in the end, and a bit reluctantly, that all he needed was their support and not their rejection. In the end, Henry Watson, a real Watson, knew he’ll have to make do.
“John” Sherlock breathed the name as if he was breathing for the first time.
“Oh” Eurus sighed “I…” She took a deep breath “Sorry Bee…”
“This is Angelo” Sherlock finally managed, Angelo finally greeting John.
“Rush things?” Mike snorted “After six months together you don’t want to rush things?”
The preparation…
“How was your day?” Molly asked mischievously and Sherlock glared at her “Is she ready?” She asked and tried to get in the house but Sherlock stopped her.
“I talked to Mrs. Hudson” Sherlock bit his lower lip again and looked out the window, what if John didn’t want to live with him?
