"It's your totally manly jawline, sweetpea. It's just too chiseled for ordinary clothing." Steve made a disgusted noise. "Now, now, no disparaging the chiseled jaw," Tony admonished, "I have
An hour later, Tony was drinking a warm coke at an outside cafe in N’Djamena. He was still in the armor, so he was drawing quite a crowd of onlookers, and the coke was disgusting, but he didn’t give a fuck at this point. He rubbed his hands through his hair, making it stick up in the sweltering heat. Then he took a deep breath.
"Well, well," the hermit said, "I believe the squire has come to search for his masters. Why don't you take off your mask and join us in our prayers?"
“As if I anyone else was even an option, Tony.”
“Good morning to you too, wanker. Are you lonely yet, little rich boy?”
"Then he cannot be all bad." She came inside and looked Tony over. "I can't do much for him. The infection has taken hold and he will have to fight his way through it. But I can give you garlic and yarrow for the wound and willow bark for fever."
"She does?” Tony processed that for a couple of seconds, then decided that wasn’t the real issue here. “Let's go get lunch." Tony felt uneasy. What the fuck was Steve doing here? It’d been a couple of weeks and he was wasting his fucking time and talents hanging around with Tony.
The vet had said that Stevie would hide somewhere to have her kittens and to keep an eye on her because her labor would likely be difficult because she was so young and still underfed. But that wasn’t how it happened at all. In fact she had her kittens on Tony’s belly, after he had fallen asleep on the couch and woken up to a shuddering and panting little cat, who refused to be moved. Steve came to the rescue with some newspapers that he maneuvered under the cat to catch the worst of the mess. And a mess it was. Tony had had no idea that kittens were born in a little sac, which the mother tore off with her teeth and then she literally licked them to life. It was more than a little freaky, but Steve had shoved a pillow behind Tony’s head and held his hand while he knelt next to him, so they could watch over Stevie together. An hour later she had produced three blind striped little furry worms, who were crawling all over each other trying to find a nipple. She laid back and closed her eyes, seemingly sure she was done. Tony figured she’d know better than him, anyway.
"I believe he is saying 'Begone, demon! Our Lord protects the innocent souls of this... slumber party? I am sorry, Sir. The recent expansion of your music library has left a few holes in my Old English database."
"Sir! Captain Rogers is not a villain!" J.A.R.V.I.S. sounded almost scandalized.
"Maybe not," conceded Natasha. "Maybe he got kicked out somewhere else, though." She pursed her lips for a moment then looked at Tony again with a speculative look in her eyes. "You know, he could have bought his get up at a dump store near an army base in Germany. But what if he didn't?"
"Thor has come a-wassailing."
Tony's shivering woke him up several hours before dawn. The hut was warm and Tony himself was burning up, yet he shivered. Fever. Steve swallowed down the dread that rose like bile in his throat and wrapped himself around Tony. Tony whimpered and tried to burrow deeper into Steve's warmth and Steve was happy to let him, happy there was something he could do.
“You’re something else, Tony.” he said finally.
“Are you-”
Silence descended in the room. Steve turned his head and looked at the machinery along the walls. Even if he could see it clearly, would it make any sense to him? Finally Steve turned his face back to Tony's.
“See you on the other side,” Tony whispered in his ear.
." Tony didn't stoop to doing air quotes around 'trial of the century' but he couldn't avoid a little sarcastic emphasis on the words.
"I think I'll go spend some time with my aunt down south. She's always on my case about spending the holidays with them. She is still pissed I missed Thanksgiving. Wanna come?"
“Tony! Have you emerged from the depths of your thesis? How is it going?”
"What does the lord of the manor say on these occasions, Steve? So as not to cause any interstellar incidents."
Actually, she wasn't half bad. The guy though, he was no Kenny Rogers. Tony wished for the eleven hundredth time that he and 'Del' weren't almost last on the billet. Or that Hydra would just fucking show and distract him from the urge to crawl into Steve's lap.
Tony wanted to protest, but he knew that look on her face and he knew that resistance was futile. Steve must have sensed it too, because when he came out of the bathroom in Tony’s robe, his cheeks rosy and his skin glowing, he sat down in the chair Natasha pointed at without protest.
“Hey,” Tony nods, glancing up at Steve.
“Good,” says Tony, striding closer. And Steve has no clue what he is referring to, the game or Steve's reaction to him, but it’s not like he has leisure to wonder. Every step Tony takes revs up Steve's heart rate, as it's caught somewhere between panic and excitement and by the time Tony is standing right in front of him, blocking his view of the game , his heart is about to pound out of his chest and his cock is filling. Tony's so close that Steve could reach out and rip the towel off without even leaning forward. He'd be able to run his fingertips through Tony's happy trail, tug on the short hairs, see Tony's cock. He realizes he hasn't even gotten a good look at Tony's dick yet. He's had it inside him -and his ass aches not unpleasantly at the thought-, but he hasn't
“That doesn't mean much. I'm sure you've only seen
“You're lying.” Tony stated flatly. He turned to Widow. “He's lying. You're an awful influence. And so are you, Barton.” he added with a nod to Clint. “The both of you should be ashamed for sullying Captain America's lily white soul.”
"Get out. Get
“Well, no. That is for aesthetics. You should see the piles of thank you notes I get from grateful women and gay men all over the world! In fact, I've been offered good money to design you a suit with strategic cutouts. They helpfully suggest all kinds of interesting placements for them, too. But, of course, that would negatively affect the function of your suit. You should be glad I am such an incorruptible soul and would never jeopardize your health for the sake of a few measly dollars, Steve. I mean, I have enough money anyway, but I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if you were shot in the ass.” He sounded so very, very sincere too.
, curled up on a bench with Steve, and apparently perfectly happy where he was. And so was Steve, he realized. Perfectly happy.
He had a point. Dead was dead.
“That is the salary you are going to offer Ms Potts to become your personal assistant once you return to the States. Believe me, she will be worth every penny.”
“Was confined to the suit. No suit, no JARVIS.” Tony swallowed hard and Steve let go of his respectful stance and wrapped an arm around his shoulder. He thought he was reading the situation correctly, but it still surprised him when Tony didn't pull away instantly.
"Superior genes," suggested Steve smugly, "I might not ever get gray hair." This set Tony off on a long and spluttering rant that Steve only half listened to. He smiled to himself as they pounded the ship's running track, the pace very slow for Steve, but he'd been ordered to keep his identity a secret so this slow jog was all he was allowed right now. Tony was getting a workout, though, it wasn't slow for normal people. The sun was just coming up and there was barely a soul in sight. The whole garish atmosphere on board was muted somehow. These last few days had been surreal, to say the least. Like a Dali painting. Or like Dorothy arriving in Oz. Except he wasn't looking for a way back home anymore, not really, more like he was looking for something to fill the emptiness of his new life. He was the Tin Man, then. He snorted when he realized the running track was an ugly mustard yellow.
"Says the man who takes it up the ass from Coulson."
“Fine,” said Steve. “I'll sacrifice myself in un-noble ways only. Now let's use this brain of yours to get this show on the road.”
Stark twitched as if he hadn't expected to have Steve be quite so close. “I am uploading my AI into the ship's system. Fury said I could not bring any tech that Porter would not have, but I am interpreting that as having to hide my own tech in the outdated crap Porter would carry around. So I spent the night before we flew redesigning and camouflaging stuff. Like I'd go anywhere without JARVIS.”
Fury was much more prompt in answering his phone than Bell had been. Probably because he'd been trying to get a hold of Tony for more than a week.
“Being Iron Man was never about the suit, Tony. Iron Man has always been the man within.”
Steve is frozen.
"On second thought, I am sure Reed will let me lease you back just for sex."
“Good morning, princess,” Steve smiled despite himself. “I think we can conclude that the sleep compulsion won.”
"What. Are they going to do a
Steve stared at the contents of Del's suitcase spread out on the odd circular bed in the cruise ship cabin. Stark had mumbled something about the seventies wanting their swinger pad back, whatever that meant, and had disappeared into the bathroom. There were red roses and chocolate covered strawberries on the night stand. Steve didn't think he had felt this lost and out of place even when he first woke up in the 21
Tony shrugged.
Tony drops his fork and strides over to the oven. Dropping onto his haunches with his hands on the oven window, he inhales deeply with his eyes closed. Between the lounge pants stretching across his ass and the look of pure bliss on Tony's face, Steve shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Then Tony moans obscenely and Steve fumbles to drop a napkin on his lap.
Tony's eyes flew to his.
“The orange one came over immediately and crawled into the box with him and started cleaning him up!”
Steve made a put upon noise and yanked the shirt out of his hand. He shoved it under the seat. Then he finished doing up his shirt and leaned over to kiss Tony softly. Tony settled himself against Steve’s shoulder and sighed.
Tony had watched all the footage he could find of the USO tours, so he knew exactly what Steve was talking about. There were so many things he wanted to say about that. That Steve had looked good: strong and noble and beautiful. But he also wanted to express his outrage that that had been all they had wanted to use Steve for, when it had been so blindingly obvious that Steve was so much more than a dancing monkey. That they had created the perfect warrior, with outstanding skills, but more importantly, with so much heart he was a boon to humanity, instead of the threat he so easily could have been. He wondered if that was why Howard had spent so much time and money looking for Steve, because he had felt guilty about helping create the new Steve with his Vita-rays and then abandoning him to bureaucrats without an ounce of vision. But even if he could have found the words to say it, this wasn't the time and place, what with all the girls in red and gold booty shorts kicking up their legs a few feet away.
,” Tony repeated.
you there was a question." The last bit was meant for Bors, who just rolled his eyes at him.
"You like that? It's a bit over the top. Do you want me to take a picture?" He held up his tablet.
“Wow,” Steve said, when he could. “That’s fucked up.”
"Not even to save her life? And all of ours? We'd all be dead if I hadn't managed to scare them off with the fire demon. And if that big ox hadn't shown up to prevent you from being hacked to pieces and trampled in the mud, you'd be dead twice over." She pointed over Tony's shoulder to Steve. Tony whipped around. A giant grin broke out on his face when he spotted Steve and Steve helplessly smiled back.
“Do you have
the sex. He pulled Steve in for a kiss that would promise just how much sex they would be having, but somehow it turned into a kiss that promised something tender and fragile instead, something that already felt a little like goodbye. Stamping down on that, Tony forced himself to replay the events of earlier this evening, the way Steve had bitten that bottom lip when Tony had been worshiping his dick and soon arousal wiped out everything else. That, at least he could deal with.
Tony planted his feet on the coffee table and enjoyed watching Steve delightedly explore them all, while the man kept one eye on the big screen and Tony was glad he'd found another multi tasker to watch a movie with, because honestly, how anybody ever expected him to just sit there for two hours and passively take in a story at a pace that was inevitably too fucking slow, was beyond him.
"Would you like to join us for drinks on the aft deck after dinner?" Abdel asked, "My wife and I would love to talk to you about certain... opportunities."
"Colonel Rhodes. The honor is mine. Sir." There was a pregnant pause as both men held the salute while they stared at each other. Tony rolled his eyes. They ignored him.
Bors nodded his gratitude and went to stretch out next to Percival. Good. Bors needed the sleep more than Steve did and Steve needed to sit in silence for a good, long while.
"Your brother is a king? King Arthur?” Tony whirled around to face her. “Tell me he is not the king of Camelot." That had to be a joke.
"No, he isn't. His father died before he was born. His mother went a little mad from grief and tied him to her apron strings for 18 years. He didn't see hardly anyone but her for all that time, so he just doesn't really know how things work. Or that some people do not mean well and you shouldn't listen to them." He glared in direction of the camp.
“I’m pleased to hear it, Sir. I’ll make the necessary arrangements.”
"JARVIS, just pick us a movie. Nothing that requires any explanations, please."
frequently enough to keep Steve from fretting. Eventually, Steve is able to relax a little and focus on his own book, even. The upside of this little episode is that it has totally killed the urges that were plaguing him earlier. It's with immense relief that he realizes he has control again, that he can look at Tony and see an attractive man, a very attractive man, but it's not making him sweat and shiver right now.
The fight took forever. The serpent kept luring them into deeper water, where it was hard to move and hard to stay on your feet amidst the crashing waves. It would disappear under water whenever it was cornered, but it never actually left. As soon as they'd wade back to shallower water, or try to catch their breath, it would surge back out of the spray and try to take someone's head off. Once, Percival slipped and went under. Weighed down by his chain mail he couldn't get back up and Steve had had to drag him out while Bors held off the oversized snake by himself.
“Not for
“Tried that,” Tony said with the faraway voice of someone distracted by other thoughts, “Didn’t work. It’s like I cancel out my own magic. Don’t know why, you’d think it’d be squared if there was any reaction at all, but it really does nullify itself. Gotta figure that out someday. My processor is over there.” He waved over towards an alcove that Steve hadn’t even noticed yet. Admittedly, things had been a bit chaotic. “I was hoping Bruce could use it, but it doesn’t like Bruce much, apparently.”
"Coulson has the plans. He's good, but he isn't on the ground, so they usually go to shit at some point and then we all just kind of improvise."
For a few moments the Iron Man just stood there, all lights extinguished except for the faintly flickering arc reactor. A hush fell over the crowd as they took in this new development. Then, slowly, inevitably, the armor toppled forward and hit the mud with a dull thud. Steve's cry of dismay was lost in the triumphant scream that the people let out in unison as they surged forward to claim their fallen foe. Panic clawed at his innards. He did not just watch Tony die. He did not spend more than a year yearning to be found, only to lose the man who finally came for him. To helplessly watch him die. Tony was not dead, the armor was malfunctioning, that's all it was and Tony was fine. He had to be. He was just trapped inside. Holy mother of God, Tony was trapped in the armor and these angry yokels were trying to tear it to pieces!
"Possibly not."
Tony sighed. He started pulling the coaster to pieces.
“With the solo missions she usually does? No,” Tony admitted reluctantly.
“Alright. Eight o’clock at De Wijnhaven.”
"Close enough." Tony admitted. "And here you're eating this like it's the breakfast of champions. Not even any honey?" He almost gagged at the idea. "How is that even possible?"
Not a soul was outside this evening, but it wasn't like they'd need directions. There was only one church and it was clearly visible on a little knoll at the edge of the village. As they drew closer, the air seemed to grow thicker and the stillness of the place took on a eerie quality. Besides the relentless rain hammering on the waxed hood of his cloak and the squelching hoof beats of their horses, there was no sound to be heard, and even those sounds seemed muffled as they neared the church. There was a flickering light visible through the windows, so the sanctuary lamp must still be burning, but apart from that, shadow predominated in this twilight. All in all, the place gave Tony the creeps.
the same. Tony didn’t want it to be the same. But what if it was? What if he was reading it wrong and Tony was the only one who was about to lose it from a little thumb rub?
She threw a toothpick at him. Tony triumphantly put it on his own pathetically small pile. On second thought, he put the toothpicks in his pocket as well.
"Seriously, JARVIS?
"Fuck if I know. I mostly ignored him."
“You know the drill, Tony. Chop chop.”
“Oh, come on!” exclaimed Clint. “You didn’t bring a cat in here! Now my eyes will be itching for days!”
“Please,” he manages.
On the screen, Steve was being sworn in. Then Elisa started her questioning.
Tony tried to collect his roiling thoughts and parse a coherent response.
Steve turned beet red of course and elbowed him in the side, but Tony smiled smugly, because he knew exactly what Steve would be wearing to bed later.
“What? No!” Tony crossed his arms, defensively. “I gave her a job, yes, but all the unadulterated awesome is her own.”
He took the path along the creek towards the beach and was really glad to see he'd picked the right direction, so he wouldn't have to drag his ass all the way back, wheezing and panting.
“Steve? Captain Rogers? Captain Fucking
Clint gave him a grudging nod, but was grinning outright five minutes later when the strategy had turned out to work like a charm and the hallway was full of writhing, groaning thugs with arrows sticking out of limbs. It worked just as well for the four that were waiting inside the cabin. Throwing the door open, Tony fell onto his front and stapled all four in quick succession, after which it was child's play for Clint to take them out. Clint stepped into the cabin and locked the door behind him, just as Tony spotted the guys on the balcony.
"Of course, if you'd rather stay out here and sweat some more..."
His voice pulled Steve's gaze from the wonders around him and Tony couldn't imagine what his workshop looked like to a guy from the forties. Steve's gaze landed on Tony and a small smile played around his lips.
“Fuck, this Compulsion is powerful,” he whispered. It was. It only took another few minutes for him to be dead asleep, half draped over Steve. Steve sat there, stiff as a board at first, but gradually relaxing as Tony’s breath deepened. Carefully, he allowed his head to rest on top of Tony’s, secretly relishing the soft tickle of the dark hair against his cheek. The late night quiet made him feel comfortably mellow. He stared at the opposite wall for a while.
“What gave it away?” Tony croaked, scratching his head and then clearing his throat.
Two months earlier
Things went downhill from there and Tony was grateful for having the face plate in place. It was like the catacombs all over again, only this time it was Captain America yelling at him and not Steve. He wanted to run away and hide under his bed like he'd done when he was small and his dad had yelled at him. He was considering just getting the hell out when he heard Thor's voice in his com unit.
“I’m going to take a shower, can you have one of the Hogwarts elves bring me some clean clothes?”
," he deadpanned.
“Because I like her too much and she objects to sleeping with her boss. And because I don’t want to stop sleeping with her, she needs a different boss. Also, being my assistant was too easy a job for her. You’ll give her a challenge, I’m sure.”
“Excuse me? I am your captain, I should be... Never mind, you'd be the perfect Bat Man.”
“Except that nobody was happy to begin with.”
Tony was beyond irritated. They'd scoured the ship after Steve had put his clothes on, more ass-hugging capris and super tight t-shirts to torment Tony with, but they had not found a trace of their potential contact. Steve was in the shower now and Tony was drumming his fingers on the coffee table in the cabin in lieu of banging his head on it. Fuck Fury and
That was the moment the crypt went dark. People screamed and Steve thought he heard someone cry. But several quick thinking people turned on their phones' flashlights and that made things quiet down a little bit. Steve pushed his way through the milling crowd towards the guide, who was asking everyone to calm down with absolutely no effect at all.
Tony tossed him the pants. They’d be short on him, but the waist should fit well enough.
Back on the bus, Steve sat down next to Tony, who seemed distracted and was staring pensively out the window as they started their way back to the town center. The roller coaster of emotions of the past hour had left Steve feeling unsettled and antsy. The near panic he'd felt when Tony went missing and the anger at the sloppy teamwork were to be expected, although if Steve was brutally honest with himself, both had been out of proportion and well beyond professional. Because it hadn't been just any team mate that screwed up and endangered himself, it had been Tony and Steve was by now feeling a bit unprofessional about Tony. Which was also the reason why he'd kissed him instead of punched him and why the fact that he was apparently attracted to men didn't seem quite as high on the list of things he needed to do some serious soul searching about as the fact that he was apparently wanting to jump into bed with Tony -Iron Man- Stark.
"Aunt Peggy, I've brought you another visitor. Don't freak out, okay?"
“Not-”
Tony had reached Steve, who had drawn himself upright and had watched him come closer with super stoic face. Tony felt at a distinct disadvantage, being shorter and so much weaker and with the bum leg on top of that.
Right.
“Really.”
“It’s nice they’re all happy to see you’re better.”
“You would give your prize to the peasants?”
"I so love your innocence. You go right on believing that one cost only a thousand dollars, honey."
“But you have airco.”
“It’s not like that! They’re not friends. They’re vultures, Steve. Vultures who flock to see if the Stark heir is showing any signs of weakness this year that they can exploit. I’ll be paying for your dress robes because you’ll be doing me a favor by attending. You’ll be my moral support. And I promise I’ll have your back. I won’t leave you alone with disapproving matriarchs who don’t want you to look at their daughters with your lack of pedigree.”
"Oh god, yes. Touch me." Two pairs of hands started frantically pulling off his clothes, not always in sync. When Tony was finally,
“I don't have any.”
As the evening bled into night and Tony was gesticulating wildly beside him, jarring his shoulder, and ranting about something else that these Medieval dingbats needed to invent, like, yesterday, it occurred to Steve that he and Tony had never talked like this before. Never this long, for sure, but the quality was different too. They'd always been too busy snipping back and forth and finding the faults in each other's words so they could jump on them, to ever focus on their common ground. Now, stuck together in this alien world, they had nothing but common ground. And it wasn't like he hadn't enjoyed their previous pissing contests, because, honestly, as irritating as they had been, they'd also been kind of fun. But this was so much more. Steve knew he had been smiling like a lunatic all night, but he just couldn't stop. He looked aside at Tony, who stopped mid-rant.
"Oh please. Only last week Cap was blushing very prettily when I suggested he wear the chaps, because Stark would like them. And he wore them today. And Stark -"
He set them down gently on the springy grass next to a tree. Steve tossed his shield on the grass and hopped off Tony's boot. He stood there for a few seconds, hands on his hips, looking away into the distance. Scanning for enemies, maybe. Or taking in the view of the mountains, and wow, those were close. They must have gone further than he thought, since he was pretty sure he was looking at the Matterhorn there in the distance. He made the helmet retract to get a better look. Yup. Matterhorn. Pretty. They didn't really have time for pretty, though.
"What for?"
“Aw, man. Seriously? Where do I get that?”
"I know."
“That’s going to change, Tony, now that Bruce is going to move out. It always does when we get someone new. We’ve had a surprisingly long run with just the 5 of us, but the dynamic always changes. It’s already kind of different now that Jane has practically moved in with Thor.”
Steve lifted his head slowly, determination evident in the shape of his mouth. He was bracing himself, Tony could tell. And rightfully so.
“I am not sacrificing Steve to cover up my fuckups. It's not like people expect me not to fuck up, anyway. There are plenty of ways to deal with this without involving Steve.”
"What? No!"
Tony elbowed him in the stomach. "You're ridiculous."
It took them a few hours to get Tony packed up to go. The Iron Man suit would sadly have to travel in a burlap sack, which was wrong and undignified, but it couldn't be helped. They needed an extra pack horse just for that, because it really was heavy. Steve inquired politely if Tony had actually ever ridden a horse before, when he had a little trouble getting the pack horse to stand still to accept its burden.
your comment when I tell you about those horrible days? And you want me to talk to you
“Except that you could have left things alone and nobody would have been any wiser and everybody would have been happy!”
Steve followed him mutely and stood taking in Tony’s room with the loft bed and the desk and the tiny two seater couch, which was really more like a wide chair, while Tony dropped the duffel bag in a corner and busied himself with opening the can of tuna. The big index finger stroked each furry head in turn to keep them from squirming. It was soothing even to watch. Once he had placed the saucer of tuna on the floor, Steve put the kittens down and in silent agreement they both sat down next to them and watched them make their way on slightly wobbly legs towards the saucer and then onto the saucer as they tried to practically immerse themselves in their food.
“Oh, yes, baby, that’s it. We’re going to be great friends, aren’t we? Yes, we are.”
“Tony…”
He had no idea how many miles of tunnel were in this section of the catacombs and he had no map, how the fuck was he going to find him in this maze? What if he was running
"Can we leave now?" he asked softly.
people will."
He considered calling Tony, now that he had his number, but he decided that whatever needed to be said was better said in person. He did call Nick Fury, though, to let him know he'd be in town next week.
“Lube? Condom?” he inquires.
She cried. Of course, she cried. She'd had been betrayed by her friends and lost her family and the life she thought she was going to have. Tony patted her awkwardly on the back, uncomfortably weathering this storm. He didn't think hugs were in order on such short acquaintance and other people's tears were not something he dealt with well. He suppressed a sigh of relief when she finally hiccuped to a halt and angrily rubbed her eyes. She looked at him with red blotches and tear stains all over her face and Tony was suddenly a bit glad he'd saved her. It wasn't like he'd put this world to rights, or anything close to that, but even little things made big differences to the people involved. The woman slid down from the table. She cleared her throat and curtsied clumsily.
Tony dropped the thesaurus on his foot and barely managed to grab the phone before it could follow the thesaurus.
"I don't get a bulk discount? Or a friends and family discount?"
"Can I help you?"
The bike rumbled seductively under his ass and the feel of Tony between his thighs, in his arms was perfection. He could hold on as tight as he wanted and it’d be alright.
“I… yeah. Thanks for the food.”
"Whoa! Whoa! Ste... Del! Oh, thank fuck you're here! Don't hurt him!" Steve eased up and took a good look at the man he was pinning down. It was one of the twins. He stared at the boy, not comprehending. Then he felt Tony's hands on him. One on his shoulder and one was turning his face towards Tony.
“Oh. That’s his name. This is the angry one that keeps hissing at me. Also bit me. Twice.”
It was the smile more than curiosity that drew Steve out of his bedroll. He sat himself next to Tony. "Want some help?"
"No. They. Are. Not. Don't even think about it. I will shoot you."
“Wow... You carried me for two
“Not fucking arguing about it, Stark. You won't be able to stay away and you know it. But you can have your mental health days for now.” He paused and stared at Tony intently. "Stark, I want Rogers."
"Oh please," scoffed Tony. "I am paying you to stay."
"Forever," stated Tony decisively. "Huh. I never thought of it like that. The way he talked about you, I could have sworn... But I guess I would say the same things about the armor or JARVIS if they were lost to me." He went back to scraping his branch and Steve got a new one out of the fire. They worked in companionable silence for a while. Percival was snoring softly on the other side of the fire. Tony shivered once, but kept working.
"So, I was thinking," Tony said as the bus was nearing the city center, "that whether Hydra decided not to stoop to kidnapping in the catacombs or whether the wonder twins somehow messed up their plans, it might be a good idea to
Tony snorted. Such a tragedy nobody would get that reference. Steve would have, Monty Python and the Holy Grail had featured one Avengers' movie night. But Steve wasn't here, that was the whole problem. Tony sighed. Steve also wouldn't have run away from Tony's demon. Actually, Tony best chance might be hoping that Steve would come running to some villagers' rescue once he'd heard about the 'demon', noble idiot that he was.
"I will bring all the others with me when I go and take my brother's throne. I am sure I can find a them a position in my army." And with that she turned on her heel and walked off, followed by Accolon. Mordred lingered a moment and smirked at Tony. Then he whispered: "Not so strong without your armor, are you? Better stick close to your friend now." Then he turned and made haste to catch up with Morgaine.
She looked exhausted, once the tears dried up so Tony showed her one of the rooms with a bare bed and told her he'd see her in the morning. Fortunately it was still summer and blankets weren't so essential just now.
“I think we should go-” Tony stopped himself, a grimace on his face. “Wait. What day is it?”
“You used a weird mixture of glamour, illusion and charms, so it looks like an apple, it feels like an apple, but it smells like plastic and hair and it probably tastes like that too, which I am not going to even try, just so you know.” He tossed the apple in the air and caught it, looking pensive.
"A penny for your thoughts." Steve leaned on railing next to him, shoulders touching. Tony felt something settle inside him immediately, as if the world was just a little more right when Steve was standing next to him. It scared the crap out of him.
Tony did, although with the fingers digging into his cheeks it sounded more like: "Yus, Culnul Wuds, Oi unnustund."
"Fuck you," said Tony, "I am not outsourcing anything, therefore I am not cheating. I'm just having J.A.R.V.I.S. project some lines onto the undecorated cookie. Would you accuse your grandmother of cheating if she showed you her paint-by-numbers masterpiece?"
“The asshole doesn't deserve that.” Steve couldn't tell if Tony was really bummed or not. “Sorry if that was painful. Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.”
"Don't be ridiculous," Tony retorted, a little weakly, "Spiderman is way more scrawny." But he was wondering the same thing. Who the hell
“Thanks, Banner. I love you too.” Tony shot back. "So what do I do with these until Monday?”
“You know you didn’t actually transfigure this, right?”
"Hold that tree for a minute, will you?" Tony dropped his end, watching Steve out of the corner of his eye as he fumbled with the unexpected shift in weight, but then regained control with awe-inspiring efficiency. So much for trying to trip up Captain America. But at least his face wasn't doing that thing anymore. Tony bought a bag of chestnuts, the warmth of which felt like heaven on his frozen fingers. He congratulated himself on his excellent ideas. Steve was watching him a little wide eyed, tree on one shoulder (hell yeah, beefcake lumberjack!), as Tony made his way back to him. When he got near though, he was suddenly faced with a dilemma. The chestnuts were for Steve, but there was no way Tony was giving up the deliciously warm bag and there was no way Tony could walk, peel chestnuts, keep hold of the bag and hand the peeled ones to Steve all at the same time, even if Steve carried the tree by himself. Fortunately, he spotted a bench not too far away.
"You knew."
"That would be awesome. Totally awesome." Tony busied himself with the coffeemaker to avoid having to look at her. Not that she wouldn't look through that in a millisecond and make him pay for it later, but he just didn't know what else to do. Looking at Steve wasn't an option either.
"I suppose.... the fund would revert back to you to do with as you will. But I am going to have to insist on hard proof before taking such a step. I am sure you understand. Your father -"
“Still got the legs, thanks. But definitely an arm.”
What followed was a tale of big indifferences and small cruelties. The story of a bright child who tried desperately to please his father only to be ridiculed or ignored. Whose father fed him on stories of his own brilliance and Captain America's heroic deeds, but when Tony tried to emulate the former he got disdain. When he had played at being the latter, as kids are wont to do, his father had laughed derisively and told him he'd never be good enough. It was a story of endless nannies and multiple boarding schools, of forgotten birthdays, trashed treasures and negative attention being better than no attention at all.
"We're not even-" Tony started, but lost his train of thought before he had finished his sentence. Jesus, Steve. Are you
Scunthorpe-the-Medieval-village looked exactly like what Tony had guessed a Medieval village called Scunthorpe would look like, except maybe even more muddy and depressing. It had been raining steadily for the past few hours and when they arrived around dusk the sagging houses were shut tight against the weather and the streets could easily be mistaken for shallow rivers. Tony's cloak had turned out to be only moderately waterproof and he was cold, wet, tired, hungry and absolutely miserable. His mood was equally dismal. He hated this place, he hated this time and he hated the fact that he was stopping himself from bitching about it at length, like he had every right to, because of some vague Steve-related concerns. Apparently now that they had leveled up in friendship Tony had a new found need to not disappoint him. It was really inconvenient, but there you had it. To be honest, that feeling had been there for longer than he cared to admit, but where it had been previously limited to battle situations, now he also seemed to care what Steve thought of him outside of those. He couldn't wait to shake off those kinds of irrational thoughts. And just as soon as that stopped feeling like he was kicking puppies, he would.
Steve looked away, staring out a window and that helped.
Steve laughed, surprising himself. And Tony, obviously.
many?" He handwaved at the dozens of cards stuck to the charging station. Pepper slid off the workbench and walked over with her heels clicking on the concrete floor to where Tony was still staring at the cards, as if trying to unearth the deeper meaning of a card depicting Old Faithful geyser. She tapped a manicured nail on the only one that had the message facing outward, a little cartoon of Tony that had masterfully captured the look of intense concentration he tended to get when absorbed in a project.
. And his ass was to die for in the European booty-short style swim trunks that clung in all the right places. He was going to have to send the real Del a thank you card for packing those. Right after he keelhauled Corbin for being the wanker that only packed Speedos as swim attire, mind you. Not that Tony would have been able to get in the pool with Steve anyway, because even camouflaged with the artificial skin flap, it'd be a little awkward to explain the arc reactor to the general public while still pretending to be Corbin.
"What?"
“I love you,” said Steve.
"Good thing we managed to avoid that then. Let's change back into Del and Corbin's shirts." He dug into his pack and handed Steve the mint green polo he'd been wearing that morning. Steve pulled the 'I heart NY' shirt over his head, but his head got stuck in the collar. It really was too small. He struggled, and got his arms out, but his head would not budge. He could hear Tony laugh.
"Maybe I can find an apartment and a simple job in Brooklyn and just lay low for a while,” he continued. “There has got to be something I can do to earn some money, things can't have changed that much. What do you think?" He looked back at Tony.
That made Steve laugh: "And you so meekly follow orders, don't you? Don't you run a giant company in real life?"
, who is your new friend?” Tony graced the girl with a viciously fake smile.
"You..."
He started stirring the honey into the gruel with a small smile.
"What the
"Really? That many? Well, consider me a rebel, then."
Steve came out of the bathroom dressed for their reserved dinner seating in a perfectly serviceable sports jacket, except that every single item of clothing in Del's suitcase came in colors that really should not be seen outside of ice cream parlors. This one was strawberry flavored, by the looks of it, but the alternative had been pistachio and that just really clashed with Steve's tan. Tony willed his hands to be still and got up to join Steve.
“Easy now, soldier,” Tony murmurs, but then he uses Steve's instinctive lift of the hip to slide his pants down his ass and shift him towards the edge of the chair.  Suddenly Steve is sitting bare-assed on the very edge of the tacky leather seat, with his leaking cock slapping against his belly.
Steve started straightening his clothes with fumbling fingers and a slight blush on his cheeks and Tony wanted to hug him. Sometimes he was even more annoyed with himself than with other people.
I'm not gonna.... What makes you think he's even.... Rhodey! Seriously! He isn't.... He doesn't..... You think he has feelings for me?" That last bit sounded just pathetically hopeful, even Tony could admit that. That's what living a Sting-song did to a man, obviously. Tony Stark, living the Dream of the Blue Turtles!
“Feeling a little lost, huh?”
He still flinches when Tony barges in again with a toolbox that is admittedly far fancier than Steve's mom's. Tony eyes him oddly, but says nothing.
"Go ahead," said Steve, dropping his bundle of wood by the campsite, "I am sure you can manage without me. I'll try to catch up with you in the morning." Or not, he thought to himself. If these guys were going to be sent on side trips by random holy men, he was better off on his own. There was a slight risk in not having someone else to watch his back while he slept, but he didn't need all that much sleep, and he'd be faster on his own.
“I… sure.” Steve took the papers and lifted his eyebrows. “Aren’t these important? They look like they are.”
"On second thought," he manfully changed the topic, "Let's not leave Percy here in Morgaine's clutches. That woman scares me."
Steve sucked in a quick breath when Tony dropped to his knees in front of him and when he took him into his mouth Steve gripped the countertop so hard, Tony expected the granite to dent. He couldn't remember ever having given a more gratifying blow job. Not only did Steve's dick feel as if it was made for his mouth, but every flick of Tony's tongue, every tease of the frenulum, every time he probed the slit, and every time he varied the suction, it was met with Steve's gasps and groans and aborted stutters of his hips. Tony had never been this turned on by
"Phone booth? In this century?"
The horde of squids were dealt with in good time. Tony lost sight of Cap, but saw the shield fly by in his peripheral vision a few times. It seemed to work a little better than Mjolnir, due to the edge it had, but the repulsors were the most effective, meaning Tony was very busy for a while. It was a good way to take out his anger and frustration, really. Which was why he wasn't about to let the nasty things go when they started to retreat. That, and he wanted a specimen to study. He wasn't buying this as the first sighting of the Kraken in modern times. In the Hudson of all places? Someone had to be behind this.
“It sure as hell
“You’re not horcruxing me into that bike, Tony.” Even though it was a beautiful and brilliant bike and Steve was dying to take it for a spin. It was Tony’s turn to roll his eyes.
“Bucky and Sam aren’t my goons.” Steve knew he sounded sullen.
Steve carefully picked up the wounded man, who had fortunately passed out while his fate was being decided and started walking towards the camp where they had left the horses.
“Jump, Steve.” It was as if Tony had whispered it directly into his ear. Goosebumps ran down Steve’s arms. Steve slid one hand up Tony’s back and Tony came forward without resistance. With his heart hammering in his chest, Steve leaned forward and kissed him. Tony’s lips opened eagerly under his and effortlessly, his tongue slid into his mouth. Tony’s arms slid around his neck and with a small moan Steve pulled him flush against his body. He reveled in the feel of Tony in his arms, Tony’s fingers in his hair, Tony’s scent in his nose. He couldn’t believe this was happening, couldn’t believe Tony was letting him kiss him, was kissing him back as if he wanted Steve just as much as Steve wanted him.
Steve had learned long ago that kissing was the most effective way to shut Tony up and Tony couldn't say he minded his methods very much. As always, his heart did a little stutter at the feel and the smell and the
"Good afternoon, Mr. Stark. Aren't you supposed to be at a board meeting?"
Instead of translating, JARVIS addressed Tony, his tone so dry Tony could practically see the dust forming around the speakers. “
"I'm sure I can't wait... So does that mean you're not..." Steve trailed off and looked embarrassed. "Nevermind."
"Really? Who sets the strategy? Decides how to deploy?"
“Made what worse? What did you do?” It was hard not to whine, as tired as he was.
The women turned around. The one bearing the Grail approached them slowly.
His hope of a quick return to more civilized state of living had died a slow and agonizing death about a week into the search. There were too many places Steve could be and there was not enough time in the day to visit them all on foot, or even on horseback. Tony had no tools, no connections, no communication skills, no friends, and no clout and it was fucking terrifying to think he might not find Steve soon. Life was a lot harder here than it looked in Braveheart, he'd realized. Appendicitis and diabetes and a score of other afflictions were death sentences. He'd seen people disfigured by polio and smallpox, and beggars starving to death. Hell, you could step on a rusty nail and die of lockjaw. The idea of being stuck here scared the shit out of him.
"I am not what you call a civilized man," Steve quoted at him.
“Lead the way.” Steve gestured magnanimously with one arm and slung his duffel over his shoulder with the other. They fell into step and walked the hundred yards in companionable silence.
“I didn't always look like this,” Steve interrupted, “I was really small and sickly before my.... growth spurt and after that I was continuously deployed. There was a war on.”
"Why don't all people go to heaven, angel? Why do they sin? Why can't they follow the righteous path? It is so clear when God lights our way." Galahad sounded genuinely puzzled.
See, the old Natasha would have smirked or given him the glare of death. This one looked a little resigned, or maybe even sad.
He put an exploding car between himself and the Whiplash guy, but while Tony ended up with singed hair and a cut across his eyebrow that immediately started bleeding like a motherfucker, it didn't faze the guy. He wasn't fast, but he was persistent and the whips more than made up for his lack of agility. Tony was out of ideas and he was rapidly running out of wreckage parts large enough to hide behind, with the way the whips kept slicing off pieces.
"Us people," Tony cut him off, "Are people. People who realize it is completely pointless to try and shoehorn some common decency and tolerance into your brains saturated by Fox news, your megachurches and your Tea Party, so we will leave you to your regularly scheduled ranting about Obamacare.” He paused and tried to look contrite. “Oh dear, am I making sweeping and totally unfounded assumptions based on what you are wearing? How terribly judgmental of me! So sorry! I will strive to be more open minded in the future.” Tony moved his chair back and got to his feet, pulling an unresisting Steve with him. He slung an arm around Steve's waist and smiled in triumph when Steve reciprocated. “Have a pleasant evening, I hope tomorrow's dining companions are less offensive to your delicate sensibilities and that all your grandchildren grow up gay. Goodnight." And with that he turned them around and started steering Steve away.
“Jesus, Steve!”
"How come you're not doing the bracelet thingie and have it come to you, while I shoot some target practice?" Clint cracked his knuckles.
"If you don't want to cook, just bring the booze, Stark," Clint suggested happily. "I'll give you a list for that."
Tony fought down another wave of jealousy.
"Grammy, I don't see Josh and Dane!" he whispered urgently. Steve immediately looked all around. The kid was right, the twins were gone. Then he went cold all over. Tony was gone too. He tapped his ear piece. Nothing.
"Verily, Sir"
"Hello! My name is Elaine. I am not a witch. And that is Sir Anthony Stark. He is not a demon, though his armor is possessed. He's French." She nodded for emphasis.
Tony had JARVIS leave a message with Pepper about where they were headed and then blocked the 17 calls she made in the next 34 minutes. Steve's lips had turned blue somewhere over the Atlantic and he had ice crystals in his eyelashes and Tony couldn't spare any energy on bickering with Pepper. He needed to get Steve home fast, because even if the man probably wasn't dying, like he'd said, he still looked fucking uncomfortable. Even with the added weight, he made record time. Possibly putting a bit more strain on the arc reactor than was strictly advisable, his health being as crappy as it was.
Percival looked at Steve in surprise. "Could you not see him? Oh! You weren't here. Right. Well, he was red and gold and he had icy blue fire shooting out of his feet and hands and his chest. And his eyes were empty and soulless and his voice was as loud as...." He continued on, but Steve wasn't listening anymore. Hope speared through him, hot and urgent and almost leaving him unable to speak. It couldn't be, but it couldn't not be. Tony had been here. Oh sweet Mary, mother of God, someone had come for him. He wanted to fall to his knees and cry.
“These are my lady in waiting Nimue and my knights, Accolon and Mordred.”
“You still wanna... ?” A little bit of the tension seeped out of him and he looked a little less spooked. “Yeah, okay, in a few days.”
"I am afraid your King Arthur is in for a rough time."
Steve flopped onto the bed next to where Tony was poking at something on his tablet. "Why is there a tuxedo hanging in my closet?"
Ah, Jesus Fuck. Darcy was Jane’s friend, who had taken over Tony’s room when he’d left.
"But, sir -"
"This is going to hurt like a son of a bitch, isn't it?" rasped Tony.
“Tony...” It sounded as wrecked as he felt.
"And?"
Tony cut the connection.
“Why would I do that? You beat my ass every single time.”
Tony could see he was trying to speak, but barreled over him.
“I know. I tried to get them out in the shower, but it didn’t work.”
“Did you ever....
"What are they saying?" Steve heard Percival ask.
Steve was laughing so hard, his attempt to shove Tony glanced off his upper arm. Tony shoved him back anyway. And then they were pushing at each other like middle schoolers and Steve knew it was probably childish and transparent as hell, but God, anything to get his hands on Tony right now. Tony didn't stand a chance, of course, not without the armor and definitely not now that he was laughing too. Within a few minutes Steve had Tony pinned under him, breathless with laughter and struggling feebly. He looked down at him and swallowed hard, the smile dying on his face. This felt way too good. Way,
"Well said, Sir Stephen! Alright, fellows, back to the village we go."
The haircut did look great and Steve was obviously pleased with it. If Applied Physics wasn’t going to work out for Natasha, she’d have at least one other marketable skill. Then the oven beeped and they all sprung into action. Natasha started sweeping up hair, Thor started setting the table and Bruce came out of his room to check on his creation. He declared it done, but needing to ‘sit’ for 10 minutes. Tony took Steve with him to get clothes on. He wasn’t sure if they had killed him with kindness or whether he was just really glad to get out of the rain or what, but Steve barely reacted to the news that his clothes were in the washer and wouldn’t be dry till the morning. He accepted Thor’s clothes with a small smile.
Steve clambered off the bike a little awkwardly, his muscles stiff after the long ride.  He shook his head trying to shake the buzzing in his ears. Next to him Tony practically yelled in his ear.
and then to set it as the wallpaper on Nick's phone. “Stark will get the mani/pedi, a perm, we'll dye his hair and beard gray and he will have to get his ear pierced for the diamond stud.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “And America thanks you for saving her favorite son from my wrath, J.A.R.V.I.S., well done, you.”
They walked out together, carefully closing the bedroom door behind them to keep the kittens in. On the stoop, Tony handed the bag with sandwiches to Steve. The man tried to protest, but Tony shushed him and he didn’t give them back.
“Yeah”, Tony sighed happily, “It'll be glorious.”
"The work was excellent, fuck you very much! All my work is excellent."
"Oh! Well! There is part of the fund reserved for a grand ceremonial internment at Arlington, sir. Mr Stark, your father, left full details as to -"
“Alright. I want to see that.”
, sneak up on me like that again." The accent is obviously New York. Steve spent a few months there after his discharge, thinking the hustle and bustle would distract him enough to manage his newfound anxiety, but it had been a disaster. Too much noise, too much aggression, too many assholes. Too many sirens at night. Then his mom had died and he had come home to make the arrangements and here he still is. Here he is feeling stupid for the assumption that a goat herd in a dilapidated trailer could be nothing but Mexican.
JARVIS' silence had a sullen edge to it. Just as Tony rolled over to stick his head back under his pillow, JARVIS turned on all the screens in the bedroom and tuned them to CNN. The Avengers were fighting a giant squid that was pulling people off a promenade into the Hudson river. Despite his best intentions, Tony couldn't help but look a little closer at how they were doing. Checking that they really didn't need him. Natasha's bullets didn't seem to be doing anything, and even Clint's exploding arrows didn't do much. The chunks they were tearing out of the thing oozed a little and then closed back up. Its brain must be hiding deep inside, somewhere in between the roughly 37 tentacles. Thor's hammer was just kind of bouncing back on the gelatinous mass, but the Hulk seemed to be doing alright ripping off tentacles left and right. They grew back apparently, but not super fast. No need for repulsors then, Hulk would get the thing eventually. He was about to lay his head back down and shut his eyes when the camera zoomed in on a man that was held aloft in 3 of the tentacles, struggling mightily as the creature was dunking him in and out of the water.
He talks to the young kid at the reception desk that looks too young to have seen active duty, but knows the Military likes them young. The kid tells him Sam is still doing the group, but his schedule is changed. He's left already because he’s doing another group later today in Martinez. Steve turns away, wondering if he should... but it feels like it'd be too much. Like he doesn't have the right to go to a different center, to a different group, to chase after Sam like that. All his nervous energy deserts him in an uncomfortable rush. He'll just go home. He'll try another day. But he knows he may not have the courage again for months. He starts walking to the door.
“You obviously have issues that I am not going to touch with a ten foot pole,” Tony continues. “I got my own shit to deal with, and I got no time for yours. But here is what I am thinking. You're hot. Like, ridiculously so.” He grimaces a little, as if life's not fair. “I'm hot. Hot enough, anyway. I want your dick. Or your ass. You want my dick. Or at least my mouth. This doesn't have to be complicated, if we don't make it complicated. We have sex. We
The tingling was spreading over his chest an down his other arm now. He closed his eyes and gritted his teeth for a moment and forced himself to stop railing, because he could feel he was running out of time. He strode over to Loki and grabbed his ear forcefully.
Steve pushed up unto his elbows, decision made.
Steve cracked up and after a short moment of mortification Tony did too. He collapsed on top of Steve burying his head in his shoulder. God, he was such a failure. But Steve was still shaking with laughter under him, and that made it impossible to to start freaking out. A little while later, Steve pulled up his head and kissed him, the smiles still pulling at their lips. Before long though, they were both panting as Tony finally figured out how to move and not fall apart at the seams immediately, and they gave up on the kissing. Steve threw his head back against the pillow with a loud moan and Tony pushed back up onto his hands to get better leverage. On the other side of the wall, Bruce cranked up
He cut off abruptly when Steve stepped into his personal space and looked down at him. Tony suddenly felt short of breath and his heart skipped a beat.
Steve kissed him softly. There was nothing of their earlier fire in the kiss and Tony didn't press it either. Yet it touched Steve even deeper than the one before. Gentle as it was, -and they were barely moving their lips- it soothed the panic he'd felt for days and filled him with something more warm and hopeful instead. He pulled back before the kiss could turn needy and change the mood. They laid there for a minute, their breaths mingling.
"Thanks,' he said instead, "but I don't think it's necessary to break your cover just to sell a few more Starkphones. I think the ladies and I can handle it."
"I don't think it counts as a grudge when it happened
"About 250,000 people annually, Sir," provided J.A.R.V.I.S. helpfully.
"Fine, fine. Take me to bed, O Captain my Captain."
"What is wrong with the back of a car?" It was Steve's turn to whine. "Lots of people lose their virginity in the back of a car."
Tony fled.
“I did have a reason.”
"He will die within a day anyway. Why would you kill him? Are you not sworn to protect him?"
It took a few minutes to get everything ready, then they marched inside. Tristan and Steve in front, swords sheathed, but Steve had his shield at the ready. The others followed with the litter, and Gaheris fell in behind to watch their backs. They made their way to the throne room slowly. A few older servants were crying in an alcove and one young girl, that Steve had always thought was too excitable for her own good, was having a bout of hysterics, while several women were trying to calm her down. He could hear the commotion in the throne room long before they made it to the doors. Several people were trying to outshout each other and could be heard over the din of the excited voices of what seemed to be everyone in the keep who wasn't having a breakdown in the hallway.
He tipped his head towards Percival, who was groaning softly, and really not as happy looking as Steve.
"Uh, no. But hot chicks."
"Who...?" said Steve. "I'm sorry, my vision is really blurry."
Steve looked at him. "Midnight mass," he said after a long pause.
lugging around a giant portfolio. Pepper wasn't impressed. And then she got even less impressed when Natalie met them in Monaco and Tony's morning took a nosedive. Between Pepper's pinched looks, and Natalie apparently rubbing it in; added to the jolly encounter with Christine Everhart and Justin Fucking Hammer and Steve breathing down his neck while radiating disdain, it was a small wonder he stuck around in the hotel as long as he did. He made his escape to the bathroom, the only place he could currently hide from Steve and honestly, the blood toxicity reading at that point was just the icing on the cake. He was dying. There was really no escaping that fact anymore. He'd have to tell Pepper. And Steve. Some day.
“My mother used to say a woman who is forced is not a sinner as long as she is true in her heart,” said Percival.
"And, lo and behold, there is Iron Man. He hasn't fought with us for six months, yet he showed up today."
When he drives down the hill to school, he is struck by how the sunlight illuminates the hills and sparkles on the water of the Strait. It is beautiful.
It didn’t come. Instead, Steve stepped forward and leaned his knee on the bed. When Tony didn’t say anything, he crawled onto the bed altogether, the mattress dipping under his weight, Tony’s gaze following him. Steve halted just above him, hands on either side of his head and staring down into Tony’s face. After a few long moments in which nothing made sense inside his mind, Tony lifted an arm and cupped a hand behind Steve’s neck. He pulled and Steve came, bending his elbows until Tony reached up the last couple of inches to kiss him. They hung, suspended in air, for a moment, their lips barely touching and then Tony’s abs gave out and he fell back. Steve followed him, landing heavily to his side and the next moment Tony had turned and wrapped his arm around his neck and they were kissing for real. Steve’s arm came around his waist, pulling him close. Tony opened his mouth for Steve’s tongue and revelled in how right it felt to have him so close, to kiss him with every bit of yearning he thought he had excised months ago.
"Hey man, you alright?"
"What? No, the kissing was metaphorical." He paused. "Although, this is magic we are talking about, and Loki... so who the fuck knows. This is why I hate magic, you know. I can outscience the best of them, but magic just fucks with the fabric of the universe." He shook his head. "No. I can't imagine... Did you know that in the original fairy tale the prince raped Snow White... Or was it Sleeping Beauty? Anyway, he fucked her while she was sleeping and she woke up when she gave birth nine months later. To twins, I believe. Since neither of us can get pregnant -God, that is a scary thought- I think we can rule out the kissing."
"So. What's next, do you think? You gonna go back in the army? Fight with the boys in Afghanistan? Or should we present you to the public first? Hey! You could be part of the Stark expo! That'd be a hit. Or, I can introduce you to this senatorial committee that wants to see me. And while we're at it, you could let them know how ridiculous it is they're even asking for the Iron Man armor. It's not like they'd ever ask you to hand over your shield. Or-"
“Maybe. But it also refuses to play my Throwing Muses CDs. We’re reduced to Thor’s vinyl collection.”
Steve dropped his kit next to his bunk, and flopped down on it, too tired to put it away right now. He was hot and sticky and there was a metric ton of dirt sticking to the drying sweat on every exposed bit of skin. Afghan dirt was nasty stuff, it got into the smallest crevices and into your pores and it was like superglue. Impossible to get off without scrubbing off a layer of skin, and it was
“Excuse you? You did exactly the same thing in 1944. And we won that time too. Wait. We won, didn’t we?”
They stopped for a gelato on the way back and Tony badgered him to try anything but vanilla, so Steve rolled his eyes at him and consented to try the peach gelato and wow, was that an awesome choice. Tony had had more espresso than was strictly advisable, ducking into coffee bars for 30 seconds at a time, which was apparently enough to complete that transaction, and he was almost vibrating next to Steve as they made their way to an electronics shop JARVIS had found for them.
The atmosphere around the campfire was subdued that night. When Tony and Bors had gotten to the cave, the demon had obviously cut his losses and disappeared. Steve and Percy had been in the process of hacking up their lungs and it had been a while before they had managed to get them out of there. Now they had made camp a few miles away from there, but, although they were breathing normally by now and didn't seem to have any other physical ailments, the experience was obviously still affecting them. Tony was exhausted. Once the adrenalin had crashed, so had Tony, and Steve had had to hold him in front of him on his horse, because Tony would have fallen off his own. Tony had not liked the stiff and tentative way Steve had held on to him, but he was in no condition to argue. And Steve hadn't said more than two words to him all evening.
“I'm making shepherd's pie.”
“He’s not ready to be thrown to the wolves, Pep. He has been Sleeping Beauty for seventy fucking years, you can’t just toss him into the real world.”
"I agree," said Steve, "I think they are coming to kill us."
At home, he opened a can of food for Steve-the-cat and promised him a trip to the vet in the morning. Tasha came over and tried to help herself too, but Stevie obviously wasn’t ready to share yet and she was forced to beat a retreat. Tony pushed Steve-the-man into the bathroom, with a towel and some of his own night clothes and then he changed as well and fell back on the bed, staring at the ceiling while he listened to the hiss of the shower on the other side of the door.
Steve smiled. "Did you meet him?"
Steve leaned back, crossing his arms and,
"Oh, bullshit. You have a giant heart."
“What game?” he croaks.
Steve couldn't help but laugh, for the first time in days. "You're something, alright."
Steve put a mock frown on his face.
“Alright,
this assignment! He knew that, while there was nothing wrong with being pissed off with Fury for general purposes, the man had almost always done something to deserve it (and if he hadn't he was thinking about it) but right now it wasn't really his fault that Tony wanted to rip something apart. Or blow up something big. Really big. Like Death Star big. No, the real problem was that Tony had been distracted at the wrong time, by the wrong thing and had been
Instead of finishing his sentence, he pulled something out of his coat that looked a lot like a plug of hair pulled out of the shower drain. Except that theirs were usually more reddish blond than black and grey, because Natasha and Thor shed the most, volume wise. It took Tony a moment to realize he was looking at a very wet, very still kitten. It was breathing, judging by the way the tiny little chest expanded occasionally, but it obviously wasn’t well.
Tony grinned at him. "
Tony had almost ached at the loss of Steve’s hand when they had gotten up to do the dishes, but he quickly found out that washing up with Steve was just as bad. Or worse. The whole procedure was foreplay. They stood too close. Their shoulders kept bumping. Their fingers kept brushing when Steve handed him wet dishes. And one time, when Tony couldn’t reach the top shelf to put the salad bowl away, Steve took it from him and leaned over him so closely while putting it up, Tony could have sucked a hickey under his jaw without leaning in more than half an inch. If he hadn’t been so aware of Clint and Natasha yakking less than five feet away, he probably would have. All he dared to do now was to inadvertently trail his fingers down Steve’s abs, while the man was up on tiptoes. Steve landed heavily back on his heels and his eyes burned into Tony’s. For a moment it seemed as if he was going to kiss Tony, audience be damned, but then Bruce came back into the kitchen to show off a tired, but very much alive little kitten. Natasha jumped up and came over too. Steve stepped back a little and they all admired Bruce’s handiwork. The look he exchanged with Steve next was less heated, but there was a happiness in it that melted Tony’s insides none the less.
A moan from Galahad broke through his reverie. The village healer had stitched him up alright and swaddled the leg with a poultice and clean linen. She'd given him willow bark for pain and sent them on their way with more fortifying concoctions and a shake of her head. Now it remained to be seen whether he'd survive the blood loss and potential infections. With only the willow bark as pain killer it was a miracle Galahad had been sleeping at all. Steve knelt by his head and offered him the water skin, which he accepted gratefully. Green eyes looked up at Steve, so very much like Lancelot's, except now they looked a little feverish. Steve felt his forehead. Yes, his temperature was definitely high. Galahad cleared his throat.
“I would,” said Steve. “They looked hungry to me. And it can pay the healer for the services Galahad needs.” He kept on walking. As an afterthought he added: “Take the tusks, Galahad may want them.”
Stark strolled out of the bathroom while Steve was still working up the courage to touch anything in the suitcase. He came over and stood next to Steve, following his stare.
"Tony." Steve's tone was soft, but brooked no argument. Tony rolled his eyes but did shut up, while Steve gently started prodding Percival to figure out what he did know. Which turned to be not all that useless after all.
He held out his hand.
“Yes, Tony, I fucking well know.”
“She’s going to kill you.”
"Think positive, Tony," came Steve's smiling voice from beside him, "This one has a boat that we can borrow to get to the Grail Island."
“I can relate to that. Any reason you couldn't do that while I was awake? So I'd get to see you in return?”
“Really? From where?”
“Nothing. Just thinking about how you'd react if I took pity on the poor princess's aching feet and carried you off the ice, bridal style.”
eat and you
“Hey Tony.” Her voice was tinny over the com piece.
Tony’s new room was small and a bit dark, because his window faced north, but it looked out over a canal and it had ancient wooden floors and a gigantic custom made loft bed that he had to pay Bruce for. Bruce had purchased it from Clint and Clint from Natasha, and so forth, when they had moved up from the little room to a swankier room. Eventually, as people moved out, Tony would get that opportunity as well, as his resident seniority rose. In theory, anyway, because as it turned out everybody liked their living arrangements well enough that nobody had the urge to move for the next two years.
Sam shrugged and handed the ball to Natasha.
“I'm going to need sulfur to lower the ignition temperature. It's known as brimstone in these good ol' days. You know, like the whole Fire And Brimstone thing? We should be able to find that a couple of days north west of here, where they do salt mining. It is practically on the way. And I need saltpeter as an oxidizing agent. There happens to be a lot of that in bat guano.”
Clint: nothing.
"Steeeeve...." Tony whined and pushed his head back into Steve's hand like he
, maybe even the truth, once they were out of here. He'd sprung into action before remembering that some of the moves he was using weren't considered feasible for non-enhanced humans. And he realized that could potentially turn bad. Very bad, because Tony would be pissed, or hurt, or very likely both. But that was some indefinite thing in the future and right now he was almost giddy with the sense of finally
"The front."
“It won't be done for another hour or so.”
"They send a full account of money spent, sir."
"Well. I imagine you'll be left alone for a while once the rumor has spread that the demon king has died, but the castle is now haunted by his ghost. I think you'll be fine without me, honestly, you're plenty scary all by yourself."
"And? Did they ever find anything interesting? Shipwrecks? Mermaids? Downed planes with super soldiers in them?"
“Congratulations, baby genius. So what are you doing now?”
"If Mohammed ain't coming to the mountain, then the mountain will come to Mohammed."
“Watch the game, Steve.”
"Go wash in the creek," Tony told all of them, "You reek of week old fish guts." Steve groaned just as loudly as Bors and Percival, the idea of exposing himself voluntarily to more cold water was abhorrent, but so was the idea of waking up tomorrow morning covered in dried up gunk. He sighed and dug some soap, a clean tunic and a pair of leggings out of his satchel. Percival dragged himself up from where he had collapsed in the grass to go with Steve, but Steve had to kick Bors in the ass a few times before the man could be made to move. They stripped to their small clothes and washed quickly in one of the deeper pools in the creek. Then Steve rinsed out his clothes and beat them against a rock. He hung them over a branch and he was back in the water, almost done with cleaning his mail, when looked up to see that Tony had joined them. Tony smirked at his surprise.
The demon laughed in a most unpleasant manner and Tony had to suppress a shudder.
Tony told the story dispassionately, shivering occasionally, as if it had happened to a second cousin, once removed, and yet it still rocked Steve to his core. He ached for the child Tony had been, ached for the obnoxious, lonely teenager who'd gone roaring off the tracks. He ached to hold Tony now, to promise him that he would make it right, but he knew he was about 40 years too late and this Tony would not want to be tucked under Steve's chin, no matter how much Steve wanted it. This Tony was radiating 'don't pity me' for all he was worth and Steve respected that, but he could not help needing to move closer. He settled on the edge of Tony's personal space.
Tony's tale trailed off into silence and for a while neither of them said anything. The fire crackled and threw odd shapes over Tony's face, obscuring his emotions. The wind whispered in the grass and an owl was hooting not too far off. Neither of them was still working on the charcoal. Finally, Steve deemed it safe to speak.
“I am,” deadpanned Tony. “I’m lovely. I rescue cats and everything.”
"Sure thing, princess. Whatever you say." Tony could feel Steve still smiling into his hair, his fingers playing with the hair in Tony's neck. Steve obviously had a thing for his hair and Tony had a thing for Steve having a thing for his hair. Actually, if he was honest, Tony had a thing for Steve, period. It wasn't even the sex, although the sex would have been more than enough by itself. Tony had spent the day modifying the staple gun and the toothbrush tasers, and Steve had just
, the meal came to an end. Steve volunteered to wash up and Tony wanted to howl in protest. He needed to drag Steve to his room and ask him what the hell he was doing, but because he couldn’t, he volunteered to dry the fucking dishes while Steve washed. Thor pounded him jovially on the back (because it had actually been his turn tonight) and said he’d hang up Steve’s clothes in return. Bruce went to check on little Bruce and Clint and Natasha opened another beer after they had wiped down the table, and they talked some more about youth hostels in Budapest.
He said flatly.
"Of course you don't. Horrible hassle that would be. Fine, dig them out of that box in the attic that passes for your filing system and courier them over. As far as I can see you're getting a six figure salary to do dick all, Mr Bell, and you obviously don't give a fuck about the purpose of this fund, so while I am looking at these reports I suggest you make yourself useful and research some charities for me. I think... yeah, homeless veterans would be suitable. Send me a full report in a week." With that Tony broke the connection. If Tony had believed for a second that Steve would have accepted the money left in the fund, he'd have dumped it in his lap in an instant, but Tony knew him better than that. Steve probably wasn't aware of the problems veterans faced these days, but he was pretty sure he'd like such a charity.
Steve looked a little embarrassed. "I could probably eat one all by myself if I put a little effort into it. My metabolism, you know. And we have two ovens," He gestured to the kitchen wall that held the ovens, microwave and wine fridge. "So we could make a turkey and maybe a ham too."
"Nah," said Bruce with a frown, "Apparently there is a 'eat one for every ten you decorate" rule and we've been busy here." He indicated the garland.
“Steve?”
Steve ran his hands through his hair.
“Not Iron Man without the suit.” Tony sounded more resigned than sulky.
“These are com units disguised as bluetooth headsets. All the posers have them, so besides the fact that we lose cool points, nobody will think we're odd. Just a bit more douchey than we really are. With these we can talk to each other and to JARVIS. I've set up a personal secured network in our bathroom that should cover the entire ship. Don't dick with the purple hairdryer in the bathroom, okay, it's not a hairdryer.” Stark tapped on the stubby thing that had no teeth as far as Steve could see, let alone blue ones, but whatever. The only thing he'd had come away with from that little speech was not to touch the purple hairdryer. That he could do. Then he suddenly heard Stark right in his ear when he said: “JARVIS? Say hello to captain Steve Rogers, known on this ship as Del Porter.”
The silence stretches.
“Easy, doll, just warning off the barracuda.” Tony caught her eyes and stared right back.
"We can't split. Tony, we agreed that we have to stick to the itinerary. Maybe the waiter is the contact, maybe someone will join us later. We're going in." And he turned to walk to the table. Tony followed, shaking his head. He sing songed into the earpiece: "Really not in the mood, Captain Strawberry Shortcake."
Del and Corbin had only preregistered for one shore excursion, two days from now. Steve and Tony didn't know whether they had planned to play it by ear or whether they were scheduled to meet with people on the ship, so to play it safe they had decided to stay on the ship unless the itinerary specified otherwise. The upside was that Tony thought they were less likely to be murdered while on the ship. Unless it was convincingly made to look like an accident a ship was easily closed down for a murder (or missing person's) investigation. It was easier to do away with someone and get away with it while wandering in a strange city. The downside was that Steve had looked kind of disappointed that he wouldn't get to see Nice and Florence. He denied it of course, but the man's poker face wasn't so good. That, or Tony was reading him much better already. Tony had to bite his tongue before he could offer to take Steve to Florence later, when this was all over. Because, really? That made no fucking sense at all. There wasn't going to be any after. Steve was nothing to him, after all.
From his vantage point Steve could see the small tailor immediately stiffen up and draw himself up to into a silent bristle. Then Tony sailed into his line of sight with a man in tow who was tall and slender and had floppy green hair. This was obviously a sign of trying too hard, in Steve’s opinion. This guy went rigid too, puffing up his chest a little.
“You’re the boyfriend,” he stated after a long pause.
He nodded grimly and took off again.
Tony's mouth fell open. Then he blinked at Steve.
"Yeah, you're right," Tony admitted, "I have got to go get the suitcase armor from our cabin though. I can't let that fall into Hydra's hands or we'll be battling an army of evil Iron Men next month."
after. Steve hadn’t even known Bruce and Tony worked together, he had kind of assumed nobody would be good enough for Tony of the ancient and noble house of Stark. But if Bruce made that part of the bike, then-
The serpent suddenly threw itself at the ship as if it were trying get on board and Steve slammed it in the face with his shield. Tony jumped back as Bors and Percival came running up with the lances. Again, the beast launched forward and Steve hit it again and both of the knights aimed their lances at the gills. They missed because the serpent crashed against the side of the boat and everybody lost their footing during the shock of the impact. Water gushed over the deck as the ship listed precariously, being dragged down by the huge body sliding back into the water. The ship had barely righted itself before it came again. Tony estimated that the beast's diameter was at least five feet and he couldn't even guess how long it was. It seemed hell bent on getting itself onto the ship somehow.
The next morning Steve was on the second round of fucking Tony through the mattress, this time trying to go slow and watching his dick sliding in and out the beautiful boy writhing in the tangled sheets and egging him on, when Bucky’s howler arrived.
"Never mind. Creep."
Steve breathed deeply. Stark was right.
“Yes, Steve, I will marry you,” Tony announces breathlessly to the apple crumble and for a moment it looks like he is going to kiss the oven window. “How long till it's done?” he continues in a normal voice and Steve hopes fervently his blush can't be seen from where Tony is just now getting to his feet.
"Tony, I..." he started, trying to pull back. Tony cut him off.
"For his choice of swimwear and the nipple piercing. Do you think we could have a threesome?"
Steve looked like he might be choking. "But you don't know-"
“Right,” said Steve, as he was making to get up. “I should probably-”
"Seriously, I fucking hate you," Tony panted next to him. He must be starting to feel better if he was using actual words. "There is no reason whatsoever to go jogging at any time, but I particularly object to it at five thirty in the fucking morning when I have a hangover!" he continued.
Steve whirled around, and Tony instinctively took a step back at the force of the motion.
“Coulson! Must we?”
"Tell, me," said Clint, "When is the last time you did something Christmas-like?"
“Of course you do.”  Tony tosses the useless remote on the couch and gives Steve a patronizing pat on the head. “Carry on then. I'm going to take a shower.”
"It's not that easy, Cap. We're a weird bunch of individuals. Hawkeye is too used to working alone. Total einzelganger. Black Widow has the chops, but she has the same issue and I am not sure how much SHIELD really trusts her when it comes down to it. Former KGB and all that. Thor is great, especially in brawls, but he sometimes loses sight of the fact that's we're not all gods. And he is hopeless in interviews, man, the shit he comes up with sometimes... Like a frat boy slash soccer hooligan slash alien. And then he goes all befuddled when people think he's weird. And my issues..." Tony held Steve's gaze, daring him. "You know my issues."
The next time Tony had to fly off as Iron Man to go deal with some crisis he spent the entire flight to Serbia being treated to Steve's tactical analysis of the situation, which JARVIS conveniently displayed on Tony's HUD. He was in and out in under 40 minutes, with no damage and no casualties.
"Does it feature the Lollipop Guild?" Thor wanted to know.
“Me? Are you sure that message is for me? Why the hell would he throw me to the sharks like this?”
“I’ve seen a lot of guys fighting imaginary everything.”
"Don't matter. I've done enough kinky stuff that I know that those are my hard limits. Everything else is negotiable. Not promising I'm gonna do whatever, but I promise I'll consider it."
“Okay,” he says. “Great.“ And pats Steve's shoulder as he turns away, looking over Steve's head into the distance. “Eight out of Ten. Regrettable fumble on the dismount.” He snaps up the towel and wraps it around his waist as he makes for the stairs.
By the sound of it, Steve was pulling wads of wet newspaper out if his boots.
Wait for it.....
"Even considering what money is worth in this day and age, I am insulted by how little value you think my thoughts have."
“SEVERAL MATRESSES. BLANKETS. POTS AND PANS. BOWLS. KNIVES. PENS, INK AND PARCHMENT. HAMMERS, WRENCHES.... AND GARDENING IMPLEMENTS.”
“Good luck with that.”
"The reason is that
Tony stared at him, wide eyed, then grinned and pointed at his stash. Steve grinned back and helped himself. Then he rolled onto his side and propped up one leg and Tony rolled with him, watching in fascination as Steve coated two fingers with lube and started circling his hole. He ran his hand up and down Steve’s hip as he watched, not being able to keep from touching. As the two fingers finally disappeared into Steve, first one, then the other, he moved to softly bite the inside of Steve’s thigh. Steve moaned in response and, encouraged, Tony moved up to lick a stripe up Steve’s leaking cock. Before he could reach the top and close his lips over the head, Steve pushed him back down, though. Following his guidance, he nuzzled Steve’s balls, and apparently that was more welcome, because Steve let out a long breath and relaxed back down. After a while, Tony pulled back again to watch and trailed a curious finger around Steve’s rim.
“What?! No!” Steve stared at Tony, whose face was still carefully neutral.
Steve felt old, all of a sudden. Young people, always so convinced they knew right from wrong. Then, with a stab of shame, he remembered himself telling Tony how self centered he was, hours before the man flew a nuke through a portal into outer space to save everyone in New York City. Okay, so maybe not so young people could be righteous asses too.
Steve said nothing.
“Good. There’s usually… work in port cities.”
“That isn't all it is,
"Aw, Tony, I'm one of the good guys. J.A.R.V.I.S. just said so!"
"But she just wants us come break our fast with her," complained Percival, when Tony had come into earshot. "And I am hungry, aren't you hungry?"
Tony winced a little. They’d be tracking tuna all over his floor after this.
"It is going to take a while to file that case and it probably won't be treated as urgently as this one was. It could be a few months before we need you to testify." She looked at Steve, who had no idea what to say, what to do, and a softer expression came over her face. "In the meantime, Nick Fury of SHIELD has a proposal for you, I believe. There is car waiting for you downstairs if you'd like to go talk to him now." Steve nodded and shook her hand before he started down the stairs.
“That's right, buddy. If anyone here is qualified to be Bat Man, it's me. Bruce Wayne is practically my long lost twin. He is a little dumber and he doesn't have my sunny personality, but we can't all be perfect.”
“Okay.” Backing out would not reflect upon him well.
In retrospect, he could have made different choices all along. From letting Pepper book his ‘business trip’ months ago, to keeping Steve a secret from Fury and, most recently, talking to Natasha on the phone. He could have made different choices and then he wouldn’t have ended up joining the Avengers and flying a nuke through an interstellar portal with Steve’s voice over the com, tight with misery:
Steve raised his voice: "Okay, listen up everyone!" The room was immediately silent, except for a sniffle or two. "This is likely a power outage that will last less than 20 minutes. You will all stay here with Cecilia, who has water if you need it. She has two flashlights and some of your phones have lights. To make sure they last, ration the light. This gentleman here will leave his phone on first, the rest of you turn yours off. When his battery dies, the next one can turn on. Do not leave this room. Hold your child's hand until the light comes back on." He paused, then decided to be honest. "We noticed 3 people are missing, I will take a flashlight and go look for them. Stay here with Cecilia and all will be well." And with that he turned, patted grandma's hand and ran out of the room. Where the
"Sometimes I can almost see why Fury dislikes you," Steve said. "Fine. But if Antonio feels me up again, I may have to break his pinkie finger."
“Your expressions are so weird.”
reboot his life. For the first time in a long time he was kind of looking forward to what was to come.
"Why the hell didn't you let me know you were going after those guys?!"
"Steve? You know.... I'm sorry for the way I... lost focus. This morning. And this evening too, I guess. It's something I do. I get distracted. By shiny tech or.... shiny people. Or annoying people. I know you must be pissed off and disappointed in me, I actually think I got Fury stuck in that state permanently, and I...."
"You know he is not worthy." She said it as if she was sorry and not like she was condemning Tony, but it still irked Steve.
“So it needs to be sentient to respond quick enough to the riders commands?” Steve asked for clarification.
Tony nodded. “Rhodey said it would increase his chance of a shorter sentence if he had a standing job offer. I don’t expect him to hold it long, which is a pity, because I could use someone I trust, but I’m sure he is morally opposed to fucking his boss or some such nonsense. I mean… not that I am presuming… I know it’s been three months and I wouldn’t blame him if he’d changed his mind...” Tony trailed off miserably, only to bristle indignantly when Barnes started laughing at him.
Steve decided to go guard the door to the shop.
“Did you know there are very salacious videos of him online? Have you seen them?” The bitch was practically drooling.
Tony shot him a pitying glance.
“Okay, Now that we are alone.... I'll admit I need to get off this leg.”
, the Sinatra/Tommy Dorsey version, the other ones are just too slow. Although you're probably correct. I'll be singing and you're going to look pretty and maybe hum along. Do you know it?"
Steve 's smile was a little apologetic. “Eidetic memory. Can't help it.”
He forces himself to walk slowly, as if he is only out for a morning stroll, but he isn't kidding himself. He needs to know if it's Tony is working on that fence. It's not entirely clear to him what would be better for his state of mind though, to find Tony or to not find Tony.
When he hears the shower turn off he jumps up to busy himself with setting the table.
Steve looked off to the side, unhappy twist around his mouth. He didn't answer.
He forced himself to slow down when he noticed he that the people he was moving out of the way were flying through the air a good distance before they landed, and weren't popping back up. His progress was agonizingly slow. He was yelling at people to get out of the way, but he was barely making himself heard of the noise of the crowd. From behind him suddenly came the blast of a horn. Repeated two, three times.
By the time they reached the gate Josh was able to walk again, even if he said his head still hurt. "You should probably have it checked," Tony offered. "Sounds like a fun way to spend an afternoon in Rome for your family. Wonder what Italian ERs are like?" Josh and Dane grumbled and wanted to turn towards the exit.
Tony got kind of used to Steve being mildly confused and eager to accept Tony's authority when it came to said current events, so it came as quite a shock to come back after his first time out as Iron Man (dealing with a terrorist attack in Chad) to a Steve that had his arms crossed in annoyance and was actively glaring at him. Tony looked behind him to see if there was anyone else Steve could be mad at. There wasn't.
Phil Coulson didn’t answer until he had gotten to the top and Tony had stepped aside to let him pass without forcing him to crowd into his personal space. Phil shook his hand earnestly.
When he woke in the morning, though, Steve wasn’t in the bed, but he had acquired several cats who were curled up in the nooks and crannies of his body under the blanket. He looked out the window. The storm had finally blown itself out and a bright sun was just starting to peek over the roofs. Early still. Steve must be in the bathroom. He had almost fallen back asleep when the door to his room opened and closed. He expected Steve to come back up the ladder, but it didn’t happen. Suddenly wide awake he scooted to the edge of the bed, under protest of the cats, and peered down.
“I'm not trying to... You can stay,” Steve fumbles. There is at least a couple of hours left on the dryer, anyway, that thing is getting old. “I can put fresh sheets on my mom's bed.” Oh God, what the fuck is he saying now? He feels his face heat up and knows there's bound to be blotches on his cheeks. Tony's going to know. He can't possibly have missed the way Steve has been devouring him with his eyes, anyway, and now... It's not normal to just invite people to sleep over.
Steve's moan cut through the quiet of the cave and both Tony and the demon turned their heads to look at him. He was still in the same slumped position, but the dopey, happy face he had had before was now transformed to something that Tony could only call... well, he could be kind and call it 'aroused' but honestly, this could only be Steve's sex face. Tony shouldn't be surprised. As hung up on virginity as these people were, it followed logically that the sullying of Steve's soul involved losing that. At least in his mind. Yet, Tony hadn't been prepared to witness it. He wanted to be a decent man and look away, but that was really fucking hard. No pun intended, but shit, if Steve ever looked at Tony like that, things would be hard and there would be fucking. For days. He tried to drag his mind out of the gutter and focus on the ugly thing in front of him, when Steve drove the final nail into Tony's coffin by moaning again and then panting:
“Just thinking. If you would have been there then, I would now be stuck here with a ninety something year old guy I'd be calling Uncle Steve. Of the two, I much prefer the current situation, really. Less... awkward?”
“Alright. If that is all, you'd best get on your way. We'll send the files with you so you can read them while your hair dye is setting and we'll meet in the morning before your flight.”
For a few glorious moments Tony sags against Steve's chest, head resting on his shoulder, breathing hot and heavy in his ear. Steve can't help it. His arms curl around the man on his lap on their own, holding him close while trying their damnedest not to hold too tight. The warm, limp weight of Tony in his arms is a revelation, an overwhelming feeling of connection, caring and belonging that causes an almost audible crack in the walls around his mind. It suddenly seems impossible that he's survived this long without someone in his arms, someone to hold. His head turns, his nose searching for the feel and smell of Tony's hair. His hands want to wander, to find and stroke skin and Steve can feel hot tears pricking behind his eyelids. What the fuck is happening to him?
The eye regarded Tony for a moment, then purred to life. Tony’s face lit up even more.
"Back to sleep, Captain Nemo. We have a busy day in Rome tomorrow." And Tony rolled onto his side, his back to Steve.
"You know. I find you, I kiss you, you hack up a piece of apple and everything returns to normal. Or vice versa. Anyway, the theory that us meeting would be enough to send us back."
“Thank fuck,” he swears. “I've been wanting to get my mouth on you for hours.”
Tony looked from Thor to Steve, who smiled a small smile at him. “I thought we’d agreed you shouldn’t aspire to martyrdom?” he berated Tony, nonetheless.
shit like that. You making assumptions about your equipment or communications getting through will get you killed! That is what the 'Roger that' is for, so you know your message came through. And if you make a pun with my last name now, I will punch you." Tony looked a little contrite but Steve wasn't done. "That was two stupid kids, but it could have been Hydra, you idiot. And you not only went after them instead of letting them come after you, you did so without back up! If they caught you and figured out you're not Corbin, which they'd know as soon as you lifted your shirt, they might have killed you!"
“Consider this payback for all the times you played tonsil hockey with an endless parade of redheads right in front of me, Buck.”
It wasn't until the next push that Tony figured out what the serpent was trying to do. The angle had seemed off this whole time, as if the monster wasn't trying to get
Steve turned back to Tony. He couldn't help the fond smile that spread over his face. He loved these little reminders that no matter how tired and weak Tony was right now, he was still the same cranky asshole at heart. It was probably all sorts of wrong that he liked Tony when he was bitchy, but it was so much better than Tony being serious and quiet.
my feelings with sex. Slowly." Steve's smile was downright wicked.
Like an unexpected stumble over a loose paving stone, Steve was faced with the fact that these hermits might actually know things other people didn't, like Lancelot had claimed. He blinked in disbelief.
Steve leaned his forehead against Tony’s and took a shaky breath.
Steve doesn't want it looking any different. There is a strong need for it to remain the same.
“Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.”
“I’ll consider the matter.”
Eventually, the silence became unbearable and Steve thought it might now be worse not to say anything.
“Enough!” said Steve and put all of his Captain America authority behind the word.
Behind Steve, Dinadan sniggered. "Well, with these two most virtuous of knights going on a quest for virtue, how can we fail to win the prize?"
to say it. And when he did say it, he sounded just as much like a hurt little boy as he'd feared.
He brought his arm up and ripped the damned shirt off his head. He almost cursed out loud when he saw Tony had stopped mid change to assist him and was also shirtless. Tony's back muscles rippled as he worked his tongue over the little barbell and then slid his mouth up towards Steve's neck. Steve had an excellent view of the swell of Tony's ass disappearing into the waistband of his dark grey slacks. He closed his eyes and pulled his head back but that only made him more aware of what Tony's tongue was doing to his neck, that Tony now had full access to. Holy cow, how was he supposed to
Steve looked at Tony in horror, ready to tell him off for even toying with the idea, but he forgot what he was going to say when he spotted the profusely bleeding wound in Tony’s eyebrow. He shifted onto his knees and grabbed Tony’s chin to tilt the wound to catch the light. Tony tried to pull away, but Steve was much stronger than him.
"Well, your discretion should be more discreet."
it not to be true. But it was. He'd heard Steve say so himself over the com and everything he knew of Steve fit seamlessly with the story of an American hero who had somehow, some way, survived being frozen for almost 70 years, up to and including the topics of his nightmares. It took him a couple of days to hack into the well protected military records, but then he had his confirmation of all the details of Steve's discovery in the polar wreckage, his unlikely resurrection and miles and miles of test results. What he couldn't find was any idea of what the brass planned on doing with him. They couldn't even agree on whether to make it public knowledge or not that Captain America was still alive. As far as he could tell Steve was now in Afghanistan, but still incognito.
“Thanks,” he whispered as she hung up.
“But the comb is plastic and the apple would be kind of alive. How do you infuse life into something that’s never been alive?” he asked a little plaintively.
"Dramatic." Steve offered.
"Are you judging me for a lack of commitment?" Tony said, sounding perhaps a tad tense.
"Shush, Tony. It's fine. It looks fine. How was it made? It's not animation and it's not puppets, what is it?"
, but
"Yep. Crystal clear. You got it. Not spending Christmas alone. But why are we cooking? I can't even make Ramen noodles. Really, J.A.R.V.I.S. has some excellent caterers on speed dial. I'd be happy to order whatever we want. How about a buffet? I like buffets. Who doesn't like buffets? Just give J.A.R.V.I.S. a list and-"
"You are asking us to let your wife watch us... in bed." He paused when he felt Steve grab his hand. He wasn't sure whether Steve was clinging to him to preserve his sanity or whether he was trying to calm Tony down. Probably the first, but oddly the latter was happening too. He squeezed Steve's hand and interlaced their fingers.
He landed on his ass on a rug still holding Tony. He shielded him as best he could from the shock of the impact, but it must have jarred the broken leg, because Tony gave a sudden gasp. Shit. He scrambled upright to assess the damage and was confronted with the sight of a couch full of open-mouthed Avengers who obviously had not expected them to turn up in their living room all of a sudden.
"I need to see him. You don't understand."
" Tony was angry now too.
“I… no. I just arrived actually.”
“Tony.....” Steve sounded strangled, but he tilted his head for better access and that gesture went straight to Tony's dick.
“It’s bad enough you’re buying me clothes. And food. And pay for the house and everything else! God, Tony, they’ll assign me a lawyer, you don’t have to pay for one on top of everything else! I’ll never be able to pay you back as it is.”
"Please do," mumbles Steve, but with the sharp look the man throws him he thinks he must have heard. Which is fine, because honestly, Steve doesn't feel as bad about the whole invitation thing, now that it means both sources of noise pollution have been silenced. That was his goal, after all, so he got what he wanted. That he also got a stranger in his house suddenly doesn't seem so high a price to pay.
He swallows Steve down with a greedy gulp and Steve throws his head back against the wall with a bang, barely noticing the hurt under the unbelievable feeling of the hot, wet suction of Tony's mouth. He cries out like he's been punched in the gut, his knees threaten to buckle. Tony's tongue curls around Steve's shaft , rasping over the frenulum as he starts moving up and down and Steve can feel that down to his toes. Mouth open, he silently pleads with the ceiling while moisture pools in the corner of his eyes and his fists bang the wall. Until a strong grip forces his hand forward and pushes the fist against Tony's head. Steve's eyes fly down, the sight of his dick sliding in and out of Tony's mouth almost undoing him. Tony seems to nod and Steve slowly unclenches his hand, sinking his fingers into the thick dark locks of Tony's hair. The luxurious feeling of it briefly distracts him from his straining cock, but then his hand cups the back of Tony's head and it fits perfectly. Tony moans and pushes back into his hand and Steve can feel the rhythm of it, of what he's doing to Steve. Of how he's sucking on Steve's dick like it's all he's ever wanted.
He paused upon entering the room, the light and the noise hitting him full force. Right. No stepping back into the hallway.
Yeah, no. Like hell that was going to happen. That'd be like letting a baby duckling loose in the middle of 5th Avenue. A very strong and muscular and heroic baby duckling, so maybe the analogy wasn't quite what Tony was looking for, but still... no. Tony's conscience wouldn't survive it and that was saying something. Unfortunately, he could already tell Steve had a stubborn streak a mile wide and would be ridiculously opposed to receiving what he considered charity, so he had to come up with a viable alternative for his muscular duckling. He tapped his lips for a bit and then tried to sound casual.
"Are you sure? I'd hate to sacrifice the chaps if you were planning on wearing them later."
“Come in, you dimwit. We’re not talking out there, are you crazy?”
"Dr Banner is still here, Sir. He didn't feel comfortable going out into a crowd. He promised to cook dinner though, for when they came back."
“On Saturday night?”
"Eyes up here, soldier," Tony admonished. Steve looked up and, wow, Tony was close, brown eyes laughing at Steve and all of a sudden he was actually having fun. Of course, he stumbled almost immediately but they quickly recovered and Tony turned it into a dramatic, but probably non-regulation flourish.
Steve rolled onto his belly and looked down at Tony on the floor from the edge of the bed. He stared at him until Tony quit laughing.
“Hey,” Steve tries to mimic the nonchalance in Tony's voice. He wants to shove his hands in his pockets, but that would look defensive, so he is at a loss of what to do with his hands for a moment.  He also doesn't know what else to say, so in order to stave off the panic he can feel starting to stir, he starts unrolling the fencing for Tony and gets the next pole ready. He feels a little stupid. Doesn't know if Tony thinks so too, but Tony wipes his brow with his forearm and then hands Steve the hammer. Surprised, he takes it and after a moment of hesitation, he gives the pole a good whack. It feels good. He hits it a few more time, until it's solidly in the ground and when that's done, Tony has the next one ready and is holding out his hand for the hammer. The rhythm is easy after that and with every hammer blow Steve seems to stand a little more firmly on the ground. It is almost meditative, and he stops worrying about what he should say. He even startles a little when Tony finally breaks the silence.
"I'm fine. I'm totally fine." Tony didn't pull that one off, he could tell. It was obvious by the way Steve's face went even more frowny.
"I wasn't quite as pungent as you, but I was still ripe. And who knows when the next opportunity for a bath presents itself? Can I borrow your soap?"
There was a whole lot of nothing. The walls were made of irregularly shaped rocks and the floor of irregularly shaped slate paving stones. The ceiling beams were unadorned wood. There was no sign that his building had ever functioned as a chapel, or anything else, really. Finally, in the far corner, he noticed one of the pavers wasn't actually a paving stone, but a dark metal manhole cover. He knelt next to it to explore it from closer up.
the entire thing. But that didn't make sense, until Tony spotted the serpent's tail in the water on the other side of the ship and then he realized it wasn't trying to go over the ship, it was trying to wrap itself
“Just so you know,” he panted, tearing his mouth away from Steve momentarily, “I'm calling dibs on your virginity.”
"You're a guy. It's how you think." She shrugged and studied her nails critically. "Don't you think it's time to go home yet?"
. If we leave now, they won't be able to find us again." Tony spluttered a little more but stopped fighting Steve's hold on him as they waltzed on. Any pleasure there was to be had in the dancing was gone, though.
Steve shook his head, a little morosely, as if he had failed Tony somehow, which was just stupid.
"I wasn't worried about you. I was worried about all the innocent people in this castle that would have been burned to a crisp after they were done with you. You should never have let that stupid girl go. Just because she shoved her boobs in your face and simpered at you." Morgaine pouted and thrusted her small breasts forward and continued in a high pitched voice. "Oh, Sir Anthony, I am sure it was all a misunderstanding. My village would never think I am a witch, just let me go back to my elderly mother, please." It was an admirable impression and Steve had to bite down on a laugh.
"The meeting was this morning, sir. It is now 1.07 pm. But the Avengers are -"
“Holy fuck,” panted Steve to the ceiling when he came back down. Tony reached for the roll of toilet paper he had up here for just this reason and started wiping the come off Steve’s chest. Steve looked at him. Then he laughed.
Steve stared at his plate intently trying to look as if he wasn’t listening. Tony had been in the hospital wing for three days last winter? He’d not even noticed. How had he not noticed? What had he and Bucky been doing? Nothing big, he was sure. Just the usual shenanigans. Snow fights, broomstick racing, quidditch practice, the occasional haphazard attempt at schoolwork, exploding snap and games of chess in the Gryffindor common room, nightly kitchen raids for pastries and mulled cider... While they’d been oblvious to the fact that Tony had worked himself sick, all by himself. He pushed down the tendril of guilt that wanted to worm itself up his throat. It wasn’t like Tony had asked for their company, right?
, Steve thinks, but "Yes," is what he says. And: "You could take a shower." What the hell is wrong with him?! He doesn't want this man in his shower. Except he kind of does, but in a totally unacceptable way. He hastily puts the clothes back on the man in his mind's eye, but that only leads to: "You could do laundry." Surely it is the heat that makes him feel like his head could explode any minute now. “You could turn off your generator.”
“It is also the most self centered, backwards compliment I ever heard.” When Tony still looked puzzled, he continued. “Look, would you say Pepper is your creation?”
"You can have a beer now, though." Clint handed him the freshly opened bottle and turned back to the fridge for himself. "Now get out of my kitchen, you're in the way."
Tony wasn’t sure, but he thought he saw a tiny little smile trying to sneak onto Steve’s face.
Steve smiled wanly. "Cookies and milk sound good."
"Not." Tony was just as out of breath as he was. "Not taking your virginity in the back of a fucking car, Steve. We're doing this right. We're doing this in the cabin."
Tony nods curtly. He clears his throat.
“I’m going to leave the top a little longer, but the back and the sides are going to need to be short, because you have some nasty tangles there.”
“When was the last time you were without JARVIS?”
“I'm cold, Captain. You're the warmest thing around that won't set me on fire.”
Tony's is wearing just a wife beater and a towel slung low across his hips. Steve's mouth goes dry at the glimpse of happy trail peeking out between the two. He thinks he can see drops of water still glistening in the dark hairs. He wants to lick them off.
"I....
“I was getting to that when you so rudely interrupted me....” Tony made sure he could see the Bite Me in his eyes loud and clear. There was a knock on the office door. Maria Hill opened it and then ushered in the most gorgeous specimen of male perfection Tony had ever seen dressed in fatigues. Built, blond, classically handsome and well over 6 feet. Aryan Prime Beef, baby. Tony did not have a soldier fetish, but, hey, obviously one should keep an open mind when it came to acquiring new ones.
Tony manfully un-scrunched his eyes and marveled at sight of Steve: sweaty, messy, bruised, debauched, beard burned and with a look of naked longing in his eyes so strong it might have been able to raise Tony from the dead. Which was good, because Tony was fairly sure his orgasm was going to break the arc reactor. When Steve finally started moving,
"No, no, no! It has nothing to do with being abused. Being submissive is about giving up control. Lots of really powerful people are into it, actually, like, to balance things out or something. It's like..... you're used to taking orders in the army, right? And you're used to giving them too, because you're a captain. And don't you feel sometimes, in certain situations, that you prefer just getting the orders instead of giving them? That you like not having to think about what could and should be done? That you don't have to make the decisions?"
"So, I figured there was no point in keeping the beard. And it was itchy."
"I'm sure he did. And what is going to happen if we find him alive?"
“Don’t be fooled by their pretty manners, Steve. They’re all sorry I didn’t die.”
"Recorded message from Ms Potts, sir. Set to play when any hashtag with your name in it hits a certain threshold while in Rome." Steve leaned over Tony's shoulder to look at the tablet screen with him. A pretty but severe looking woman appeared on the screen.
"Son, I can't retrace steps I didn't take," said Steve, "we'll have to go back the way I came." Tony grabbed the kid's hand and started walking with Steve.
home, not just me. In fact, Loki specifically mentioned you were my ticket back, so don't even think about nobly sacrificing yourself to send me home.”
“You’re leaving?”
"Please state your full name and date of birth."
"I don't know, Steve. Are you? You ripped the Captain America underwear, remember? Trying to get them off me. That wasn't very patriotic, was it? Maybe it wasn't quite the same as burning the flag, but on a scale of -mmmpfh"
Tony tilted his head and looked askance at Steve.
“Here. See the peds?” He pointed at the thousands of little spokes the bike had instead of tires. “They will shape themselves to mimic a rubber tire, complete with tread, when they sense asphalt, they will become spikes on grass or dirt and in the air they will form thin but sturdy miniature sails, so as to actually displace the air you’re traveling through. Now the eyes…”
Steve tries to relax his hands. It doesn't quite work.
Steve might have pulled Tony in a little more forcefully than he had meant to and a lot closer than they had been before, like Antonio-close, but if Tony didn't like that he shouldn't have let Antonio do it to him. Tony huffed a little in surprise and leaned back a little to look at Steve. He opened his mouth to say something, but then seemed to think better of it. Steve closed his eyes in relief. Whatever Tony had been about to say about this, he wasn't ready to hear it. He sighed as Tony settled in a little closer still and then JARVIS cleared his artificial throat and started counting
“Laugh it up, Coulson. Have you worked up the guts yet to ask for his autograph?”
“Such a chivalrous man you are, Captain. You truly aren't from this time, are you? Let me remedy that for you.”
“Whoa. Hey. It's alright, Steve. It's fine, everything is fine.”
“I’ll give you a refund,” Tony laughed.
Steve's mind blanks. Dinner?
“Not currently,” admitted Tony, “but I can be one by Friday at the latest. I’m thinking interlocking metal plates, lightweight of course, and hydraulics wired into your nervous system. If we get it right, we may even get your sense of touch back.”
“So… um. What do my robes say?”
“Jesus Fuck, Natasha! Why?!? He is going to kill me!”
“JARVIS? Did I not tell you to keep those videos away from him?”
Steve alternately laughed and eye-rolled his way through the Stark Expo events. They were watching the dress rehearsal when Steve said:
So watching Steve fight this fight was out of the question. The last thing he wanted was to be reminded yet again how thoroughly fuckable the man was. Instead, he checked the bat shit, and the sulfur and the charcoal and congratulated himself on being just about ready to blow some stuff up. Then repacked it all and sunk onto the slightly damp grass to wait for Steve's inevitable victory while he napped. It was ridiculous how quickly he tired these last few days, so the more sleep the better. Steve had made sure Tony always had first watch, so he could get a chunk of uninterrupted sleep, and Tony had wanted to scoff, but it did help, so he'd swallowed his pride and just agreed. The worst part was that Steve would always send Tony to bed with a worried face as soon as he took over the watch and there hadn't been any repeats of their midnight confessions. As uncomfortable as that had been, he wouldn't have minded to repeat the experience.
"No!” Tony interjected. “No, Pep, it's not... that's not... Steve will be staying for a while."
the lab break in that Steve and I were just decoys, stealing some poor saps' honeymoon. In fact, you deliberately misstated Widow's conclusions to make us stay put."
Goat Man is speechless. The awkwardness increases exponentially as the silence stretches and Steve has to stop himself from shuffling his feet. He forces himself into parade rest and meeting the disbelief in the brown eyes head on.
“Why the hell is he using a SHIELD phone and not the StarkPhone I gave him? And J, what the fuck? You can’t just call Steve, it’s-” A shot glanced the armor’s shoulder. “Fuck! This is not the time, people!”
“Happy will be pleased to take the motorcycle in, Master Stark. I’d like to inform you that Master Thistlethwaite is waiting for you in the parlor and I believe Pepper has some paperwork you will need to sign.”
It changed things. Of course it did. For one thing, the post doc position he had secured for after his PhD defense, was now more of an option than a necessity. Theoretically he could buy a villa in southern France and do whatever the hell he wanted for the rest of his life. Except he couldn’t really. With the money and everything else came a sense of obligation to Stark Industries that he hadn’t even felt a smidgen of a week ago. Actually, that wasn’t true, he’d started feeling a little of that after the afternoon he’d spent with Steve, months ago, when they’d talked about hamburgers and all things American.
Tony's voice was soft and urgent. "Dane, listen to me. Your brother is not dead. He's just knocked out. He jumped me and I tasered him and he hit his head. I don't think he's badly hurt. He's lucky I wasn't carrying my repulsors, though, or he'd been fried. That was an exceedingly dumb thing you guys pulled here, but see, Josh is already moving. He'll have a headache and possibly a concussion, but he'll be alright. We'll go back now and find your grandma, who I am sure is worried sick about you two, you moron." Steve crouched next to Tony, needing the proximity. He looked at the kid's tear streaked face in the blue light of the arc reactor and finally stopped wanting to beat the crap out of him for scaring him like that.
As he let go of the door it closed with a thud that he refused to think of as a tomb closing. Now that the sound of the rain was shut out, he could hear other sounds. There were whispers in the air and a scuffle could be heard from somewhere. Despite the sanctuary lamp the place was decidedly gloomy and it took his eyes a while to adjust. He had to give it to the person who came in here every few days to refill that lamp, though, Tony wasn't sure he'd have had the guts.
"Tony, look at me. I want to see you.
That was the moment Steve elbowed him in the side and urged him to come on. Tony blinked and took in the scene at the beach. The hermit had vanished, as they were wont to do, but the ship was still there, patiently waiting. Apparently they were to use it.
He couldn’t make out the features of the figure outlined in the alley exit, it was too dark and the streetlight was behind him and he was too far away, but he could tell by the way the man was standing, bag slung over his shoulder and hand shoved into a pocket. He looked down at the Steve in his arms, who had decided to go to sleep, now that he had some food in his belly and was being held by someone who smelled like other -probably familiar- cats and more food. Then he looked back up at the other Steve, his mouth suddenly dry. What were the fucking odds? He half expected Steve to dissolve into moonlight as he started walking closer, but he didn’t move, watching Tony approach in silence. Tony halted a yard or so away and looked him over. He was a little more gaunt, a little more ragged, but the biggest difference was the short beard Steve had grown. Tony tried not to think about what Steve had said about being clean shaven and what it meant. Steve’s eyes went to the cat and he smiled, while something twisted in Tony’s gut.
"So, according to the opinions expressed in that team meeting you missed this morning, fraternization within the team should be no problem, but -" Steve began.
," Steve smirked.
Both breathing heavily, they stared at each other for a while. Tony swallowed hard. He was here. His Steve was here with him and he could take him home and he was free and they could do whatever the hell they wanted and Steve still loved him. It was almost too much to take in.
