Dean searched through his brain but came up blank. There weren’t many bars near him he hadn’t been to yet. It must be one of those new builds. “No, never heard of it.”
Cas stares down at his right arm, baffled. “It seems your brother is getting stronger. He just moved my arm.”
The four of them span around at the sound of Sam’s voice. They all stood tightly together like sardines in an invisible container to block the wreckage from Sam’s view.
He’d told her of his plans when he got home very late the night before. She’d been very eager to help.
Cas takes Dean’s phone out of his pocket and unlocks it with the thumbprint reader. He taps the Netflix app on the home screen and picks the first thing on his recommended list, some cowboy thing by the looks of the thumbnail. He props the phone up on a pile of discarded folders and watches the opening credits roll.
“It doesn’t work like that. Normally, an angel can’t possess a corpse at all, because there’s no one there to give consent, but I got Jimmy’s permission before he died, so I can re-enter him at any time, as long as he is freshly dead. If I wait several days, he will be uninhabitable, even if I heal him. I need to keep him in this state or I’ll be stuck in you, and you’ve expressed your displeasure at that idea.”
This would also be the first time he’d be cooking for Sam and Eileen. They had decided to have Thanksgiving with just the three of them, as it was their first holiday as a family. Sam had burnt the stuffing. And the gravy. And the mashed potatoes. Dean had no idea how he was related to such a disaster of a chef.
“Because he’s… whatever he is. Dude was a forty million year old virgin when we first met, and the only time he’s had sex since then was when he was tricked by that reaper bitch. He was human and homeless and vulnerable and she only slept with him so she could kill him. And he’s shown no sign of wanting to have sex since becoming an angel again. Not that I blame him; wasn’t exactly a great first time experience. Remember when I tried to set him up with that waitress? He just sat there, didn’t even say anything. I was doing all the hard work! I think he sniffed her, Sammy! Who does that? He’s clearly not interested. Can’t believe I’m admitting this, but I haven’t had sex in years and weirdly, it doesn’t bother me. If Cas doesn’t want to have sex, then I’m okay with that.”
Jimmy, unsurprisingly, hasn’t gone anywhere. All of his wounds have now been healed and, to the untrained eye, he looks like he is merely sleeping.
The bouncer looked between the real Charlie and the photographic one a few times, before grunting an approval and giving the license back.
“Can’t help but notice,” Sam said with a smile, “but you’re madder at an alternative Cas for smoking in a different future that now never existed, then you are for Jack actually smoking.”
“I didn’t think it would happen so soon, though. Why does it all feel like it’s hitting me at once?”
Cas felt as though he’d been slapped across the face. “You still can’t say it. Even after all this, you can’t say it. That’s it! I need some space.”
all your associated man-parts. I knew what that would mean for the future. But family don’t end in blood. I don’t need biological kids, I have Jack. He’s as much mine as he is yours, and way more than he ever was Lucifer’s”
The fidgeting intensifies, and Dean looks away from the mirror, not able to meet his own eyes knowing who was really behind them.
Cas walks back to Dean’s room, regardless of Dean’s whining. He sits on the bed and opens Dean's laptop, the facial recognition immediately letting him in. He can feel Dean’s relief when there are no tabs left open and his history has been fully deleted. Cas navigates to the Netflix tab and types in the search bar. Sensing defeat, Dean sighs.
Cas sighs, unwilling to speak. “The spell was very specific. My grace will attack my vessel. This vessel. And only this vessel. So if I were to take another one…”
He didn't need telling twice. He was out like a light within ten seconds, Dean following a minute later.
A loud bang echoes through the hallways, loud enough to reach him all the way on the other side of the bunker. The shock of it causes him to spill his popcorn all over his seat and the floor.
They make it to a motel about halfway to Seattle just after nightfall, having only made limited stops at gas station bathrooms for Sam. Cas parks the car between the lines in the parking lot, so perfectly that even Dean can’t complain, and heads around to the trunk. With a quick glance around to check for witnesses, he opens it just far enough to reach in and poke his vessel, hoping the light of his grace isn’t too bright in the dark.
He considered that. “Fair point. I am still alive. Thought you might have named him after someone else we’ve lost, though.”
Dean sat down on his bench and pulled the blunt and his lighter out of his pocket. He lit it and took a slow drag, then exhaled.
Cas’s eyes open, blue light emanating from them for a second before they fade back to their usual darker color.
“No! I’m married, too. I’ve definitely moved on.” She stroked the frame above the part containing Sam’s face. “He’s still so pretty though.”
Cas leaves Dean’s room, and hopefully, Dean’s nonsense, behind him. His former vessel is exactly where he left it, lying motionless on the table. Sam scrapes at his plate with his cutlery on one of the side tables on the other side of the room with his back to the vessel.
Sam cuts Dean off with the tape, then slaps at his cheeks to make sure it’s secure and takes a step back to admire his handiwork. Satisfied, he tosses the tape over Cas’s shoulder to the backseat, takes his bag and Dean’s, and leads them to the rooms, with a quick glance around to check for witnesses. He hands the key to Cas and smirks. “Have fun now, you two.”
Cas shakes his head. “This makes no sense. He shouldn’t be able to do any of this,” he mutters, more to himself than Sam.
The bartender handed them their drinks, which they clinked together in celebration. Dean took a hesitant sip.
Cas gets several more hours of blissfully quiet research time, interrupted only by selecting the next film to watch, and occasionally telling Dean to stop saying the lines along with the characters.
He opened his eyes and looked around. The room was dark, which was good for his poor, hungover eyes, but bad for assessing his surroundings.
Dean glanced down towards the shoreline. Jack and Miracle were splashing in the shallows of the ocean. Jack scooped up a handful of water in his hands and poured it over Miracle’s head. Miracle retaliated by shaking his whole body, drenching Jack.
Cas opened the box and looked inside. He pulled out handfuls of cash, mostly in singles, but a few higher denomination notes in there too, all neatly held together in elastic bands. “Dean, there must be thousands of dollars in here! How long have you been doing this?”
Cas picks the flowers off their stems and grinds the petals into a pulp. They release a surprising amount of juice for something so little.
He slammed the door, then leaned his head against the wood and sighed. “Oh my god, she’s more annoying than I remembered.”
Dean and Cas were taking a break from dancing when they caught sight of a familiar face. Claire and another girl about her age in a leather jacket were headed right towards them.
“I wanted you to have the full experience. And just so you know, I will be accepting zero criticism. This place has been my baby for months. Even Cas wasn’t allowed to help.” Dean lightly stroked the doorframe.
He turned off the heat and plated up the pasta, placing more garlic bread on his own plate to make up for the earlier theft, and added some salad he knew Dean wouldn’t eat, but it was worth a shot.
“My baby brother’s all grown up. When did that happen?” He finally let go and pinched Sam on the cheek.
She looked impressed. “Why couldn’t my great-niece have married you? I worry for that poor little boy, you know. Having a wacky backy smoker for a father.”
“You cannot summon the Almighty to do your household chores. And besides, he’s studying. His exams are in two days.”
Cas is silent for too long, and Dean shakes him to wake him back up. “There is another way,” he whispers reluctantly.
Silence fell in the diner. Everyone set down their cutlery and focused their attention on Cas, except the old man, who finished his burger and started dunking his fries in ketchup. Cas turned back at Dean and there was a moment of unspoken communication between them using just their eyes. With a nod, Dean spoke.
“Dean, I understand you have some reservations, but I assure you, I’m not like Michael. I won’t use your body to commit any atrocities, and I’ll let you go as soon as my old vessel is healed.”
Dean drove them all to the burger joint, Sam and Cas keeping themselves as far apart as was possible. The diner Dean had been so eager to try looked like every other greasy truck stop they’d ever eaten in, in every hick town across the country, but he still rubbed his hands together in anticipation.
Over the next few months, Dean and Cas spent nearly every available moment wrapped in each other's arms. They would steal kisses in doorways, on couches, behind the bookshelves, but always when they were alone, breaking apart the second they heard someone else enter the room.
Sam waves awkwardly at the waitress as they leave. The trip back to the motel is in silence, other than Dean’s internal grumbling. They check out of the motel, handing the keys over to an elderly man with a seriously intense frown, and head back to the car. With Cas’s usual, exceedingly guilty glance around, he pops the trunk and presses two fingers to his vessel’s forehead before slamming it shut again.
“You’re having a baby?” Dean pulled back but didn’t completely let go, holding Sam around the elbows at arms length.
She considered it for a moment. “Hmm. Nah. We pretty much agreed we were going to break up after college, anyway. We’ve got different career paths ahead of us. He wants to join the Cleveland Browns,” she finished with a small grimace.
“Yes. It’s been nice to finally actually live in this house that is legally half mine.” Cas paused to shoot a glare at Dean. “He hardly let me in while he was working. Jack wasn’t allowed in at all. He made Jack live in the bunker alone so he wouldn’t distract him.” Cas frowned disapprovingly.
Cas ignores him and walks up to the tomato stall. The older of the two women looks at him appreciatively.
"Cas watched the neighbors too closely and told everyone who was having affairs with who. He ended three marriages in one evening."
“Dammit, Sammy,” he curses to himself. When he looks back at the TV, both women have collapsed onto the floor, having fainted. Christ, what had he missed?
“The ones who did know you said you retired but didn’t know where. They kept giving me the numbers of other hunters to see if they knew and finally a hunter named Gail gave me this address, so here I am!”
Sam sighed in a long-suffering, over-tired parent way. “Only because you don’t tell him off when he runs around the house screaming.”
Next to him, Cas was in his swimming trunks, his new tattoo of Dean and Jack’s names in Enochian gleaming in the scorching sun. He’d picked up a few others over the years, which Dean hadn’t minded one bit. His hair, wet from the ocean, curled lightly around his ears. The one human thing Cas had never gotten the hang of was getting regular haircuts, but Dean never reminded him.
Jack beamed, oblivious to the tension in the room. “He will be an excellent swimmer. It will be important one day.”
Dean laughed sleepily. "Okay. I promise to be horrible to every barista, waitress, and any other minimum wage employee I ever meet again. Happy?"
“On and off. I needed answers! I could have done it faster if I was doing this full time, but I had to make time around the kids. It’s easier now they're older and don’t need me to watch them so much anymore.”
His mind flashed with the image of Cas’s face as he said almost the same words an hour earlier. His mood suddenly somber, he collapsed back in his chair.
He points at the right side with glee. “It’s all here! Ingredients, quantities, directions! Sam, where did you find this!”
“Becky,” Dean started tentatively. “All that stuff, Chuck dusting you, us fighting him, that was four years ago. You’ve spent four years trying to find us?”
Cas ignores the rest of Dean’s battle cry as he walks back into the shop. Sam is just coming back through the curtain as he enters, a small object wrapped in tissue paper in his hand. His eyes are instantly drawn to the hand tied behind Cas’s back. He raises an eyebrow in question.
Sam and Jack sat down on a small bench while Dean went to get the pie. Dean returned with a whole tray of pies, shooting daggers at a man who nearly bumped in to him. Sam frowned at him.
Dean took Cas by the hand and dragged him through the house, to the back door. Upon hearing the latch, Miracle’s head perked up and he let out a small whine. He tried to get to his feet, but with his arthritic joints, it took him a few attempts. Dean let go of Cas’s hands and patted Miracle back into his bed.
Cas slams the trunk shut and fishes the car keys out of Dean’s jeans pocket. He sits in the driver's seat and waits for Sam to join him.
Dean didn’t seem nearly as impressed. “Who cares what we call him. Look, all that matters is he got us back online.”
“Oh, right. This is Zehra, she was in a few of the same classes as me in my first year, and this is her boyfriend, Chad. He’s in Phi Kappa Psi with me.”
“Sorry about him. He’s a bit–” Eileen spun her finger in a circle around her ear and took Cas by the shoulders to push him away. “Let's stick to the adult section, huh?”
“When your hairline starts receding, don’t scream bloody murder. I thought a demon was attacking you.”
As if to punctuate this point, another cut opens above his left eyebrow and drips blood down the side of his nose.
Sam hadn’t been idle the last few weeks. He’d been reaching out to every hunter he knew, seeing if any of them had intel on this witch or even any of the Guaire family.
Out of the corner of his eye, Cas could see Chloe run into the kitchen. Dean and the other staff followed her out a second later.
Dean starts to hum a tune Cas doesn’t recognize. It starts slow but gradually increases in volume until he’s sure Dean would be headbanging if he could.
Dean spent the entire car ride home practically bouncing in his seat. He didn’t shut up about how perfect his new nephew was, about how cute he was in all the pictures he took, how adorable his little clothes were. Cas sat in the passenger seat and hummed affirmatives whenever Dean paused for breath.
Cas was the first to turn and storm out of the room, but Dean quickly followed him, determined to get to the top of the stairs first.
“Angel, huh?” Everett snarls. He chucks the shotgun back on the counter and pulls out an angel blade instead.
When Eileen decided it was time for Harry’s bath, Jack grumbled and sulked off to his room to go fake-shoot something.
Jack reached for Harry, but Eileen was reluctant to let him out of her grip. Eventually, the toddler’s wiggling became too much to handle and she passed him over but kept her hand pressed to his back.
“Never. Can’t wait for that kid to get here. She must be, what, twelve weeks, if you’re telling me?”
Sam’s head snaps up at the sudden change in conversation topic before he realizes Dean must be speaking. He chuckles.
Dean twists the handle and steps through first, keeping his brother behind him. The witch is lounging on a once-ornate couch, sipping at a fancy cocktail in a sparklingly clean glass. Her pristine clothes, exactly as Cas described, even down to the scrunchie, look out of place in the ruined building. She looks entirely unperturbed by the gun pointed directly at her face.
“You think I’ve forgotten?” he laughed humorlessly. “My memory may not be what it used to be, but I wouldn’t forget a thing like that.
Once he’d washed the car long enough to clean it three times over, he had to reluctantly admit it was time to stop. He tucked the hose away and put the sponge in the now empty bucket to carry it on his hip back inside.
Sam runs straight to the nearest draw and pulls out two magazines of witch-killing bullets. He stashed them all over the bunker a few days ago just in case. He loads one into the gun in his waistband and tucks the other in his back pocket.
“Oh, they couldn’t make it out here. I’m going home to visit them in a few days, though,” she eagerly informed them.
Dean groaned and finally sat down. “I was hoping you wouldn’t ask that. It doesn’t make me look good.”
“I’ve been thinking, Cas.” Dean’s voice had a slight wobble to it that he was doing his best to cover, but Cas knew him well enough to recognize it.
Dean barely has time to register the fact Cas has firmly pressed their lips together before he feels the familiar sensation of grace entering his body.
Sam puts the last piece of tape over Dean’s mouth and reduces his complaint to muffles. He takes his phone out of his pocket to snap a quick picture, then gets back in the driver's seat and turns on the ignition.
Dean almost went to fist-bump the guy but stopped himself at the last minute. Don didn’t seem the type to appreciate that.
“It appears my work has reached a larger audience than I realized,” he mumbled, his eyes tracing the path Zehra had just taken.
By the time they got to the second floor, Dean had Cas pinned up against the wall with his arms bracketing Cas’s head, their faces inches apart. They jumped apart when they saw they had company.
Cas was silent for a second and Dean couldn't see his face in the darkness to read his emotion. "That depends. Do you promise never to flirt with the barista at Starbucks anymore?"
“Damn, time flies when you're having fun,” he chuckles to himself. “Yeah, we were getting that flower for the spell, decided to hang around and see the sites. Guess we should head back,” he adds remorsefully.
Dean pales. No. No, that can’t be it, he can’t die. “So with your grace gone, you’ll what? Become human again?”
Dean leaned around the door to check he was gone, then set Harrison down on the floor with his back up against the kitchen counter.
Sam opens the shop’s door, causing the chimes next to it to jingle. A middle-aged man in the standard hunter get-up of sturdy jeans and a scuffed leather jacket walks through a beaded curtain a few seconds later, ready to greet the customer, but his face widens into a smile when he sees Sam.
He turned to Cas and made grabby hands at the coffee. Cas brought it over to him and handed him the correct cup. Dean took a long sip.
He wasn’t sure he’d be able to get up without passing out again, but no one else was heading towards the door.
Dean stopped still. He set his beer down on the nearby table so it didn’t fall through his shaking fingers and stared blankly at Sam.
“Don’t worry about Anti-Vader over there. He always says that," Claire placated. "Oh look, Sam’s over there. Jody asked me to give him this card. Let’s go.”
“Well, that’s the thing,” Dean got out of bed, shoving a very annoyed Cas off of him, and walked over to his closet and grabbed a large cardboard box.
“Normally, when I want my arm to do something, it just does it. It doesn’t make sarcastic comments first.”
She immediately launched into what was a clearly prepared set of questions, in the way that only someone who had been imagining a conversation for nearly half a decade could do.
He spent the majority of mornings in bed with Cas, in part because they had no plans, but also because he had twelve years of sex to catch up on.
They finally found a house on the outskirts of a small town about half an hour from Sam and Eileen’s. It was a mile away from the nearest neighbors, down a winding gravel drive, and halfway into the woods. The house was in a small clearing with no fenced garden or lawn, just an expanse of wildflowers. At the back of the house, there was a short path through the trees to a small fishing lake that didn’t get many visitors, just the locals.
He placed the blade back into his pocket and turned back to the diner. Dean’s co-workers were all standing open-mouthed in the doorway. A few patrons were watching through the windows with impressed looks on their faces.
“About what’s next. For us, I mean. Look at what everyone else is up to. Jack’s graduated and is off traveling the world. Sam’s a super hotshot lawyer thanks to that Reynolds case, Eileen's pregnant again, Harry’s just started school, Claire and Kaia have finally got their heads out of their asses and are now even more insufferable than we were when we first got together. But what about us? Don't we all deserve to be happy?”
“You’d better go alone, Sam,” Cas explains. “Dean is planning on telling the receptionist that you are kidnapping him.”
“Hey Cas, I’m just going to take Miracle out for a walk around the lake,” Dean announced just after Sam left the room to use the bathroom and they were alone.
“Nothing, huh?” Sam was really struggling to keep from smiling now. “Nothing happened while you and Dean were all alone? Together?”
They had driven for hours to get to this small town in the middle of nowhere. How Dean had heard about it, Sam had no idea. Normally, he wouldn’t indulge his brother, but it was the first time he’d seen a shred of happiness on Dean’s face since Cas had died, so he couldn’t deny him.
Dean led them all through the patterned oak door he’d commissioned from a local carpenter and down a short, cream-wallpapered hallway.
“I must say, Cas, workout routine looks like it’s going well.” Eileen ran an appreciative eye over Cas’s torso.
She ran her fingers down her skirt to rub out the wrinkles she’d just put in it. “Anyways, who's this hot potato next to you?” she added with a nod in Dean’s direction.
“Good,” Dean beamed. Upon seeing the man's expression, he backtracked, “I mean, bad. Bad dog. I’m uh, I’m gonna take him to the shelter.” He scratched the dog behind his ears. The dog was staring at him with an infatuated expression, his tongue lolling out.
“I’ve been thinking; I have a nice human job, a nice human house, a nice human boyfriend.” Cas used his free hand to stroke Dean’s face. “It’s time for me to be human, too.”
They wobble slightly, and have to pull on Sam’s hands for balance, but eventually, they make it upright.
Dean tightens his hand around the doorknob. “On three,” he mouths. Sam nods and raises his gun to shoulder high.
“No, I like this one. I’d like to hear it again.” He’d grown quite fond of Fleetwood Mac in recent months. Of all of the bands Dean listened to, they were his favorite.
“I’m hungry. I thought this would be quicker. I’ve missed your cooking,” he said as they walked back to the kitchen.
Cas sits and looks at his bacon sandwich for several minutes after the waitress leaves. Sam tucks into his own meal and scrolls through his phone, searching for cases in the area by force of habit. The young couple walks up to the counter to pay, then heads outside to a beat-up Volkswagen camper with a hand-painted ‘Just Married’ sign on the back.
Dean took Cas out of the door, then down a few more twists of the bunker’s identical hallways until they were out of Jack’s celestial earshot.
Dean rubbed his hands together in glee when he saw his ice cream in Cas’s hand. Sam and Eileen handed the four ice creams to Jack, who beamed back at them.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You can’t crash a wedding you were invited to. You weren’t though. Who are you?”
Sam heaves a long-suffering sigh. “Yeah, they’re the worst. I’ve got another two days in a car with them back to Kansas now.”
Sam is on the highway for about half an hour on the second day before he glances over at Cas, who has a pained, almost constipated look on his face. More than usual, anyway.
“Cas,” Dean admonished. He sat next to Cas and pulled his legs up so his knees were over Dean’s lap. Cas buried his head into Dean’s shoulder.
In all the commotion of trying to free Eileen, no one had noticed how far out to sea they’d drifted. The water sloshed heavily against the plastic siding, unbalancing the inhabitants. The other boat renters were too far out of earshot to call for help.
“What?” Dean dropped his fork on his plate with a loud clatter. He stared at Jack with his mouth open, despite the half-eaten food now in view.
Sam and Dean headed out of the room. Sam had to hold the bottom of Dean’s shirt and let himself be pulled along. Eileen rolled her eyes at Cas.
Sam adjusts his aim on the gun and points it at Cas’s leg. Before he has time to react, Sam pulls the trigger, his shoulder bucking with the recoil.
“Oh, so I guess it wasn’t important enough to check before you blinked into existence in the kitchen a few months ago.”
“No, with a pineapple.” Sam rolled his eyes. “Look, I get that you’re shocked. Believe me, we were too. This wasn’t exactly planned, but we’re both really excited and I know this will change things a lot, but I think it’s time–”
“About two thousand years. My father told every angel we were to bestow a gift upon this child. So I went to a barn next to a small inn in the middle of the desert and placed a blessing on him.”
“Hell no. I like you for the exact opposite reason. I know you can and will beat me into a pulp, and, not gonna lie, that turns me on a whole lot.”
“As an angel, I could remember every second of my existence, and even now, those memories are crystal clear in my head. My human memories are fuzzier. I don’t remember what I ate for lunch last Thursday, or what score Jack got on his last project, but I would definitely remember the first time you told me you love me.”
Cas lowers his vessel into the new space. It’s snug, but he just about fits if he puts the rock salt-loaded shotgun on top of him. “It’ll do.”
Cas shakes his head. “Only certain bloodlines can be vessels. We’ll be very lucky to find one just walking around. Dean, there’s a reason I came back to the bunker rather than try to find one of Jimmy’s relatives.”
He all but pushed her out onto the porch and nearly had the door closed behind her when she turned around. “Could you tell Sam I stopped by? We didn’t exactly leave things on good terms.”
She barely took a breath throughout her whole speech. Christ, he’d forgotten how much she could talk. Dean, Cas, and Jack shared a sideways glance.
Jack ignored Dean’s protests and pulled him from the nail. Dean cried out in pain, but his screams were cut short by the familiar feeling of grace flowing through his body.
Jack appeared with a small whoosh across the dining room floor. He had about three days worth of stubble, unwashed hair, was wearing a Hawaiian shirt unbuttoned to reveal a very deep tan, pink knee-length shorts, mismatched flip flops, and a pair of sunglasses that they’d never seen before.
They creep up the rotten wood stairs and across the creaking porch, cursing every footstep rattling through the place.
They arrive at the shop about an hour before closing. It’s on a quiet, unassuming street a few blocks from downtown, nestled between a vintage clothes store and a cheap law firm. Dean uses his newfound ability to put the car in park and pulls up next to the sidewalk.
“And false pretenses, my ass!” Paul continued. “There’s a picture of the two of you on the counter. His fault if he didn’t notice.”
Dean laughed at his own joke because no one else was going to, and looked back to the mature end of the table. Once his back was turned, Jack poked a finger to his, Claire, and Kaia’s glasses, turning the contents into a deep red wine.
Dean bypassed the dance floor and went straight to the bar. He sat down on the green chair and flagged down the bartender to order a double bourbon. Charlie sat next to him on the blue chair and requested an elaborate cocktail with a cherry and a silver glittery embellishment.
Charlie slapped both her hands down on the counter, rattling the empty glasses. “Yes! One for me, too, please.”
Everett, quick as lightning, pulls a shotgun from under the counter and points it at Cas’s chest. Dean throws up his hand in a defensive gesture.
Dean got to his knees in front of his boyfriend. Cas’s eyes had been welling up since the beginning, but the sound of those three words he’d been longing to hear for so long had tears falling down his cheeks.
Realization dawned on Cas’s face. “Oh right. The… thing. That we’re doing. Today. Now. Yes. You should go.”
“That’s, uh, real nice, buddy. A+ for effort. But, uh, the relationship is, uh, what I wanted to talk about.
“I thought happiness would be just telling you about my feelings for you. I’d dreamed of that moment, but I had always feared seeing rejection in your face. Disgust. And it deterred me from ever saying anything at all. I let The Empty take me before you had the chance to respond. When Jack brought me back, I was too scared to look you in the eye for fear of your rejection, but it never came. If I thought true happiness was in just saying it, it was nothing compared to the day I looked into your eyes and knew for sure that if I kissed you, you wouldn’t push me away. That I could have you,
“Look, I’m a repressed asshole. You know that. My whole life, I couldn’t let myself get close to anyone because it would just hurt all the more when they died. And they did die. I’ve lost so many friends, more than I can count. And it still hurt every time. So what was the point in not loving them in the first place?
On day twenty-two, he and Dean are alone in Dean’s room, each with a hand on the same controller, shooting at some generic bad guy in the latest first-person shooter Dean had insisted on buying that, as far as Cas was concerned, was identical to all his others. Cas is just about to attempt a particularly difficult shot when he feels a surge of energy flow through his body.
Dean just about managed to contain a very manly squeal and turned back to whisper excitedly into Cas’s ear. “Oh my God, his name is actually Chad. This is the best day of my life!”
Cas trails off and leaves it for Dean to fill in the blanks. Dean continues to look at him, confused.
“Stupid phone,” he muttered to himself. The camera was supposed to be better in this edition, but clearly, it still sucked. Dean took another photo, tapping the screen this time to get Eileen in focus, then turned the phone around for her to see.
“Three broken ribs, one broken hip, compound fracture to the left shin. Multiple lacerations to the skin, exposed small intestine, internal bleeding, completely severed pancreas, several other organs partially destroyed.” Much worse than he thought. How he had managed the three and a half hour drive from Omaha in this state, he would never know.
He clicks the play button on the remote and settles in for a treat. The screen opens to where the season finale left off: Doctor Sexy having to choose between Dr. Cox, the sexy, but conceited, heart surgeon, and Dr. Johnson, the sexy, but paranoid, anesthesiologist.
“Now I’ve got the Five-O off my back, I’m back to my old ways. I’m going to be in your area next week, hand-delivering some care packages to the poor and needy, courtesy of our dear pal, Jeff. Was wondering if you wanted to meet up. I could do with a night of drinking.”
He doused the car in soapy water and murmured apologies to her for allowing her to get into such a state in the first place. He had just started washing down Baby’s hood with the sponge when he heard the front door creak open.
The reason for her fall was soon made obvious. The edge of her sarong had flown up in the wind and gotten caught in the rotating paddle mechanism at the front of the boat. Dean and Cas instantly stopped pedaling and Sam threw out a hand to catch her.
“I can hear them, too. Dean just said ‘keep your voice down, Sammy. I don’t want Cas to know we’re smoking the good kush.’ I think Sam’s got used to being loud around you because you won’t tell him to shut up, and he forgets other people can hear him.”
—” Each word was punctuated by another punch to the face, “—use language like that again. Do you understand me?”
Dean shot him an exasperated look. He still couldn’t tell a convincing lie after all these years. Dean had managed to guess where all his birthday presents were hidden last year because Cas’s eyes kept drifting to the cupboard under the stairs every time Dean brought it up.
At the back of his mind, Dean registers the absence of grace, how weak his muscles suddenly feel, how the toes in his left shoe are pinching uncomfortably, but he can’t focus on anything other than the body in front of him. The still, unmoving body.
They headed back to their towels, which were still laying in the sand, guarded by Miracle, who was lying on his back drying off his underbelly, and Jack, who had just started eating his final ice cream, which, as he promised, hadn’t melted.
“Well, golly gosh. What a handsome gentleman caller at my door so early in the morning! What can I do for you, sugar?”
Cas taps his foot impatiently. “If you would prefer, I could book a ticket on a commercial airline. It would only be about twelve hours in the air.”
"You know this means you're stuck with me now? No returning me to the store when I don't put my socks in the hamper."
“We knew you’d freak out like this and we needed a calm environment!” replied Sam’s voice from the other end of the phone, loud enough to be heard even without angel hearing.
He spun the coin with a well-practiced flick high above his head, then caught it and covered it on the back of his hand.
Cas is first to spot the small cluster of flowers, almost hidden under a patch of taller grass, but he eagerly directs Dean to crouch down and reach for them.
Dean shuffles his foot. He can tell he’s no longer on the soft carpet of his bedroom, but he can't quite make out what he’s standing on through his boots. It’s too soft to be concrete or gravel, but firm enough to hold him.
They all waved their hands in greeting. Expecting mumbled hellos in response, they were startled when Zehra yelped and nearly dropped her diploma.
“He’s inspired me so much. I already knew I loved languages from when I learned English growing up, but his work made me really consider translation as a career. I even changed my major because of him. I’ve read all his papers.” She gasped. “I think I have his paper on the Voynich Manuscript in my bag. Would you sign it for me?”
Valerie noticed Dean was finally alone and started to cross the room, clearly with the intent of asking him to dance so he quickly tried to look busy.
Dean uses the hand still pinned behind his back to reach down and pinch Cas hard on the ass. Cas flinches in his seat, his jump impeded by his seatbelt.
“Yikes. It's what he deserves, I guess. So I tried to find a way to contact you guys. I figured you’d have an explanation. The number I had for Sam didn’t work anymore, so I looked into news reports around the country of anything demony, ghosty, vampirey, anything your M.O. I got to flex my RP skills a bit. It’s been a while since my old forum days. I pretended to be a reporter following up old cases, asked if the FBI had been involved. Mostly I got dead ends, but sometimes they gave me cards with rock aliases on them, but those numbers were out of service. I got a few other hunters, too. Most didn’t know you but some did, and some hung up on me the second I mentioned your name. You've pissed a lot of people off over the years.
Sam was so done with Dean’s bullshit, he didn’t even bother responding. He just sighed and took Harry to the living room where Cas and Eileen were. Even hearing Cas talk about his new beekeeping book was preferable to another second in his brother’s company.
“Woah, woah, woah. Hold your horses. Not right now.” Dean took his wrist and lowered it into his lap.
The sing-song voice comes from behind them. They turn on their heels, abandoning their need to be quiet, and head to the door at the back of the foyer.
Sam had realized what Jack was about to do a second too late. “Uh, what biblical ability did you just give my son?” His mind was reeling with the possibilities of having a super-powered newborn to look after.
"Stay out of this, Sam.” Cas pointed a stern finger at him that only wobbled slightly with intoxication.
The young woman replied in a friendly, upbeat voice. “I think we might have up to age 5 out back if you want me to check?”
The second day of driving goes much like the first. Cas starts to recognize the cassettes playing from the stereo from repeated use. The landscape remains mostly unchanged for miles; just acres of fields and dirt. Sam sits quietly in his seat, headphones in his ears, staring out the window.
“Well we all kind of adopted Jack so if Jack is my son, then they’d be brothers. And legally, Jack is Cas’s kid and you’re dating Cas so he’s, kind of, your stepson, which would make them cousins, or step-cousins, at least. But biologically, he’s Cas’s nephew, so what would
Cas cleanses the knife of his blood and sets it back in the drawer, where it clatters across the multiple guns Dean has stashed in there and eventually settles on a face-down magazine that Cas pretends not to see.
“So Jack,” Sam started after a few minutes of comfortable silence, “what do you want to do now you’re God?”
freak out, and no. I did all that years ago. Turns out locking yourself in your room and drinking yourself half to death because your best friend died is a good time for some introspection. Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt.”
“Yeah, and humans bleed. We’re in the middle of nowhere, we’ve got no antiseptic. You really want to do this here?”
“Blessing? What kind of blessing?” Dean was very intrigued. Cas didn’t often talk about his life before he met the Winchesters.
Cas gets to his feet. Even with this small movement, he’s able to assess his new vessel. He’s only an inch or so taller, so his proportions aren’t too far off, but his new legs are bowed in a way he’s not used to and it takes him a minute to get his footing.
“Alright, sassy pants. Let me guess what she wanted.” He held up a finger in turn. “One: she’s gotten into trouble again. Two: she’s got a new girlfriend. Three: Jody wants us to come for dinner.” Cas and Claire’s conversations didn’t usually deviate far from the norm.
The next few weeks seemed to fly by. Sam filled Eileen in on what went down with Chuck and told her she was out of danger. She had been absolutely terrified, standing at the side of the road, waiting for Sam to turn up, but not telling her what was happening.
“I’ll spare your poor little heterosexual ears the details, but let’s just say there’s a certain amount of prep work involved, alright?”
Sam knows Cas completely healed all of his wounds, and he knows Cas is aware of that too, but he recognizes when he’s being dismissed. “Alright. Call if you need me.”
Sam finished his toast and called the waitress over so he could pay. She seemed reluctant to approach the table again and stood as far away from Dean as possible. Sam left her a large tip as an apology.
He turns back to look at the mountain of stairs he just valiantly conquered and catches a glimpse of Baby half-hidden around the corner.
“You win, alright? You can have your damn rabbit food. But,” he said, as he put his own plate on the table and sat down, “the meat man needs his meat. Double patty, double bacon, double cheese.” He tasted a bite and moaned. “Perfection,” he said around a mouthful of burger.
He jerked his head towards the front row, where Cas had heard every word and was just about resisting the urge to ball his hands into fists.
“So how’s work, Sam?” Cas asked Sam politely. It was the first thing he’d invited Sam to talk about all day. He’d gotten very engrossed in talking about his new book.
On a rare day that their schedules lined up, and they both had a full day off work, Dean and Cas went for a drive. They set off early in the morning, with a cooler full of snacks and drove with no set destination. Every time they reached an intersection, Cas flipped a coin. Heads for left, tails for right, but never straight on.
Cas tilts his head to the side, confused by his sudden hostility, before gasping in realization. “Oh, right. I forgot humans can’t see grace. Sam,
“That’s not–” Dean shook his head. “Never mind. I’m gonna go get some–” he gestured vaguely at the food stall.
Dean pulls his hand back and curls it into a fist. Cas catches it just before it connects with his face.
They throw their body to the ground, just in time to dodge the fire, which hits the wood panel wall and sizzles into embers.
Cas bid good morning to the two men and turned the coffee machine to start brewing enough for four cups. He knew all of their orders by heart: Lots of milk and sugar for Jack. A splash of oat milk for Sam. Black for Dean. Black with one sugar for himself. Even though everything still tasted like molecules to him, sugar molecules tasted better. Cas gave the others their coffee and said goodbye, then picked up the two remaining cups and started to head out of the room, but Sam’s voice stopped him.
With a sigh of relief, he grabbed his stuff and walked to their door, noticing the lights were off in their windows and every other unit in the complex.
"We only get power for an hour and this lasagna I prepped earlier will need to be in the oven for most of that time so I need to get started now," Jo explained, getting a covered baking pan from the fridge.
The sky was clear and because of the blackouts there wasn't much light pollution, so the sky was a huge stretch of stars and a glowing moon. Thanks to the white blanket across the ground, the moonlight bounced off of it and it was really quite easy to see everything.
Dean's car was covered in snow by the time he got to it and thanked whatever god is out there that his mom threw in an ice scraper/snow brush when he left home this summer and he knew it was in his trunk with a million other things.
And before a second thought, Dean had thrown his arms around the (former?) angel, a strange sense of relief flooded his body.
The game is incredibly fun but requires a bit of setup, and they just had everything in place when the lights flicked on with a whirr.
Charlie returned with a bowl of Cheez-its and put it in the middle of the table where the cards had been, as those were now in Cas's hands as he shuffled.
Taking a deep breath and ripping his eyes up to meet Castiel's, Dean said with more certainty than anything in his entire existence, "I love you too."
Dean had been driving for what could have been an hour and what could have been a few days. Bobby was right about time working differently here.
Charlie and Jo's apartment has a small fenced-in patio that faced this big field that the apartment complex uses as a dog park for the residents. It's really quite big, about the size of a football field, and dotted with a handful of trees, so Dean can imagine it would look stunning covered in snow.
The Impala rolls along, towards the storm, but the sun is still shining, a corner of blue sky refusing to concede. The weather is restless like Dean’s heart.
,” He concludes, gesturing expansively at Dean, very proud of his metaphor until he notices Dean’s death glare.

“Now hang on a damn minute. ‘Okay’? Just… okay? You’re just taking this in stride? You’re not even a
, okay, Sam? Why would he do that if this wasn’t the real deal? If he didn’t know that he—” he swallows the bile down, licks his chapped lips, shakes his head.
“I don’t even know if it can be done. It’s a long shot, Sammy, maybe the longest. You’ve got Eileen. Maybe you shouldn’t—”
He closes his eyes for a moment against the barrage of thoughts that threaten to make panic rise up his throat. To his left, Sam looks serious, poised, thoughtful. Dean is so proud of the man he raised.
Dean supposes that’s true. He supposes that the truth was there for everyone to see all along — all those years, all those taunting remarks from heaven and hell and everything in between (
But he can’t do that to Sammy, so he just white-knuckles the wheel, forces himself not to push down on the pedal.
“Fine. But I just—” Dean shakes his head. Where does he even start? Suddenly, he feels like he’s so small, like he’s 12 and looking for his father’s approval again, instead of 40 and a veteran savior of the world. He’s afraid Sam will laugh. He’s afraid he will cry. He’s afraid he’ll cry and
They win the battle. Life, restored to Earth, just like that, as if it never stopped. As if only a few hours ago, a stray dog didn’t seem like a miracle, a beacon of hope in a world gone empty. All that grief, all that loss – it only exists in their heads now. Life is back. They’ve won the battle.
the smarter one. Or maybe, Dean realises in a moment of uncharacteristic self-compassion, it’s just that he actually got to live life for those few years at Stanford, while Dean was busy turning himself into his father’s weapon.
They stop at a hotel, for a change. Separate rooms, for once. Fluffy beds. Good shower pressure. They deserve it, damn it. (So why does he feel like he doesn’t?).
, giddy and restless with the sensation of being unmoored, unfettered, unafraid. They both know this, so they enjoy it in silence.
“I know,” Sam says, like it’s so easy, like Dean hasn’t struggled his whole damn life to understand it. Man, he really
He takes a long, hard swig of the bottle, then almost goes to dump it into the sink; remembers he paid good money for it, and puts it back in his bag. He doesn’t touch it again, though. Right now, weirdly, he doesn’t need to.
Dean isn’t sure about happiness, not with the gaping, jagged hole in his chest that screams Castiel’s name incessantly. But he thinks maybe he can gamble on relief, at least. On something like peace.
Sam slows the car down, rolling to a halt by the side of the road, giving Dean his full attention. “About
They’re driving towards home when he finally says it, his eyes trained on the resplendent green shooting by outside his window.
(He remembers, too, how Castiel went out of his way to let him live that quiet life, making the worst choices and mistakes just to keep Dean out of harm’s way — did he love him then? Had he always?)
He smiles as Sam floors the pedal, and they’re going, going, gone, driving into the storm one more time, towards the rest of their lives, and the people they’ve chosen to spend it with.
As endless as it feels right now, it won’t last. The first thing Sam did after Jack left was call Eileen, and the smile on his face when she picked up was so bright, Dean damn near wanted to cry. He tells himself he’s just happy for Sam (he is); he tells himself he’s just relieved their friend’s alive (he is). He definitely doesn’t think about how there’s no one for him to call, not anymore, not anymore.
best friend – the smartest person he knew beyond Sam. A smart woman, a kind woman, a brave woman. A woman who loved other women. Was there ever anything wrong with that? Of course not. He hadn’t thought so, not even for a
They’re silent for a while. Sam is looking at the road too, clearly having figured out this isn’t something he can win by being pushy, that Dean’s exposed wounds are just too tender to be poked right now.
?” Dean knows he sounds betrayed, and knows how stupid that is, that he apparently was relying on Sam to tell him things about his own emotional life, but hey, he’s never been the sharpest tool in the shed.
Dean nods, the motion choppy and stilted. He can do this, drive, follow the road, put his heart on autopilot, ignore the road signs. He’s good at that part. They drive.
It’s one thing to be open with Sam, whom he’s known his entire life — and even that seemed impossible until just yesterday. It’s another thing entirely to open up to Castiel — Castiel who’s seen him at his absolute worst and still come back for him, Castiel who keeps laying down his life for him, but also Castiel who keeps
“Sammy, I can’t. I just—” he’s shaking his head and gripping the wheel again and it’s a wonder he gets any words out, from how tightly his jaw is clenched, and Sam gets it, because he knows him, because nobody knows him
He doesn’t. He didn’t. But Cas did. Cas always, always did. And he did save Dean, over and over again, in so many different ways; in all the ways that mattered.
Sam starts up the Impala again. There are storm clouds gathering on the horizon, but not the ominous, supernatural kind. Just a storm. Just rain. Dean thinks about Castiel — he always is, these days — and about how he used to smell of ozone and electricity, how he still did a little, under the scent of book dust and gunpowder, of their laundry detergent and Dean’s shampoo.
’ve. He thinks about the curve of Cassie’s lips, and the pulsing lights of nightclubs he was never supposed to be caught dead in. He thinks about Anna’s red hair, and about Aaron’s chocolate eyes. He thinks about shame, and lies, and a father’s hard stare. He tries to remember why it matters — why he should still be trying to win the approval of a man who’s long dead, a man who was too consumed by revenge to really ever
(Or maybe he did know, and simply refused to let himself believe it, because how could someone like Cas want someone like him? How could Dean ever be worthy of it, accept that love without making it ugly, without breaking it beyond repair?)
“You know,” he says, carefully, “it wasn’t a lie. All the other things. The girls, the—” he waves helplessly. “Lisa.” He doesn’t know why it matters to him to point it out – the cat’s out the bag, Sammy knows he likes men, and the world is still turning — and there’s only one person in the whole world that he wants right now. But it
“I told you. He’d made a deal with the Empty. Decided it was time for the Empty to collect. He summoned it hoping that it would take Billie too, and it did. He saved me.”
“Nothing,” he lies, feeling dirty from it. Then, because that’s an incredibly obvious lie even for him, he corrects himself: “Nothing that would matter to you.” It’s true enough, he thinks. Cas was both of their best friend, but his last words were all for Dean, only for Dean.
Dean can’t begrudge them that, nor does he. Happiness is so rare in their line of work, and those that find it, well, they better cling to it with all their might. It’s his own problem— his own regret— that he didn’t follow that advice.
But he knows that’s a lie. Dean Winchester knew nothing of angels when he met Castiel, knew nothing of vessels. By his reckoning, Castiel was just a guy when they met, and slowly but surely, Castiel had become ever more human, ever more tangible, less of a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent and more of… Cas
Dean doesn’t pour one out for him, but he does drink himself numb before oblivion mercifully takes over.
the damn laser pointer. Dean keeps his eyes on the road for a change— a convenient excuse. He can feel his jaw tightening; he can tell Sam notices.
“I should have said it on the porch that day we argued, at Sam’s wedding, the day you found me hungover.
Cas steps a little closer to the mirror to examine his wings closer. They’re healthier than he’s seen them in a long time, not a feather out of place. Even the soft under-feathers are fluffy and warm. He gives them a quick test flap to check everything’s in order.
Dean’s grumbling was cut off by a yelp from Eileen. She fell from her seat and tumbled forwards, almost knocking into Cas.
. Anyone with eyes can see that. Don’t you remember all those angels and demons that used to call him your boyfriend? They all knew!”
She gets to her feet and paces lightly in front of the couch, slowly closing the distance between them.
Cas had completely abandoned the pretense of reading and was staring unabashedly at Dean’s ass. With a chuckle, Dean connected the hose to the tap at the front of the house and started washing away the suds, not even bothering to clean the far side. And if he ‘accidentally’ got a bunch of water over his white shirt, rendering it see-through, who was going to judge him?
Cas sighs, and pinches the bridge of his nose with his good hand. “Dean, are you embarrassed by nudity?”
It’s a short walk to the roadside diner. It looks indistinguishable from any other restaurant of its sort Cas has ever seen before, with its checkered floors, neon signs, and lingering coffee stains. There are only a few patrons inside this early in the morning: a young giggling couple with brand-new matching wedding rings on their fingers looking over a map, a withered old trucker with extreme tan lines on his left arm reading a newspaper while tucking into his greasy fried breakfast, and a small boy alone at the table with an iPad.
It was too soon after he’d woken up for such questions. “Uh, we’ll worry about that some other time. We’ve got something more important to do.”
The last few weeks of Eileen’s pregnancy were the longest of Dean’s life. He spent almost all of his time at her house to keep an eye on her. Whenever he couldn’t make it over there, he was texting her constantly to check she hadn’t gone into labor yet, despite her constant assurance that she would inform him of any developments.
Sam snaps his fingers in front of their face to get their attention. “Guys, we came here for a reason, remember?”
Jack headed off to his bedroom the second they got back to upload all of the pictures onto his laptop, leaving Cas and Dean alone.
She shrugged. “Cas doesn’t look like my dad to me. Not anymore. There are the obvious things, like the voice and the glasses, but also, I dunno, he holds himself differently, laughs differently. My dad was a straight-laced, church-on-Sundays type. And Cas is, well, Cas is a doof.”
Cas picks up the needle again and threads it with the surgical-grade suture. At the last minute, he crosses the room to retrieve his belt. He folds it a few times and places it in his mouth.
Cas, already half-drunk on a single glass of champagne, pulled her into a hug. “I thought you weren’t coming?”
“Yea,” Dean replied before looking at the unconscious angel. “Hey get the needle and thread too,” he called after Sam.
, Dean thinks and doesn’t say. What’s the point of keeping score when it seems all they ever do is try to save each other? (
had done this; he, Dean Winchester, had made a fallen angel forget his troubles enough to ease unspeakable years off his features.
Castiel realized his stomach did feel empty and nodded. His clothes were stiff from being sweated in and then cooled. He groaned softly as he sat up. While the fever was gone, his throat still pained him and his head began pounding. He felt his full age as he set his feet on the ground.
“Shut up Cass,” Dean replied gruffly before rolling the towel over Castiel’s hair one more time, blocking the fallen angel’s eyes. “Okay. That’s about as good as it gets. Are you hungry?”
The fever finally broke in the 7AM hour. Dean, who had been checking the unconscious male every hour, pulled the sheets and towels off Castiel until he was just under the sheets and a bedspread. The hunter brewed three more cups of the Winchester mix and some coffee for himself. For some reason, he felt no need to reach for the scotch he kept in the inner pocket of his jacket. Making sure Castiel was still fast asleep, Dean slipped out to get breakfast for them.
Dean gently wiped the blood from the large wound on Castiel’s torso. “Yea,” Dean responded. “Sure. You know. Just dealin’ with a lot. You,” he looked at his brother standing there with the bowl. “You look like Hell, and something’s so wrong with you Cass can’t even fix you. And then there’s Cass,” he said, looking down at the unconscious angel and wiped the blood from his chest. “I don’t know if I can trust him, if I even want to trust him again.”
“Cure a demon," Dean said, still trying to wrap his head around that insane idea as he drove through the night. "Okay, ignoring the fact that I have no idea what that actually means, if we…if we do this, you get better, right? I mean, you stop trying to cough up a lung, and bumping into furniture?”
Gently, Dean slipped the dirty jacket off Castiel. His skin almost burned Dean’s. Dean looked worriedly at Castiel.  “I’ll be right back,” Dean said, glancing at the half-conscious Castiel before heading out to get his bag of things.
Dean cracked a smile. “Yea.” The hunter helped the other male sit up. “But you were 111 degrees. If I hadn’t thrown you in there your brain would have turned to mush.”
Dean helped the ill male back into the bed a few minutes later, propping him up against the headboard. The hunter handed Castiel another cup. “How many more of these do I have to drink?” Castiel moaned before lifting the cup to his lips. Dean helped tip the cup when Castiel got weaker, but the fallen angel managed to keep hold of the cup.
Unwanted memories came to him. The realization he had felt calmer watching Cass sleep than he had in months, the look in Castiel’s feverish eyes as Dean dried him off, the look Cass had given him that brief moment when he had woken the fallen angel. A thousand little moments shared between them with one big conclusion hiding behind them all.
They pulled up to the bunker and Dean turned the car off. “I’ll get some warm water,” Sam said. “We can at least wash him up.”
The taller hunter stopped just outside the door. “Think we’ll need them?” he asked, concern filling his features.
Dean heaved a breath, looked at his brother and then back at the road. A body appeared in the middle of the road before Dean’s eyes, and his heart leapt into his throat.
They finished eating and Dean downed the last of his coffee. Cass took up the last cup of the brewed mix.
“Cass, you okay?” Sam asked, seeing the blood all over Castiel. The angel stayed silent, panting instead.
“Motel,” Dean replied, walking Castiel to the main building’s door. “A room with two beds,” Dean said, smiling to the woman at the counter. He slapped Castiel’s chest, causing the fallen angel to groan, head rolling. “This one had too much to drink and I got the short stick to stay with him til he’s sober.”
Dean heard the fallen angel moan and looked back at him. “Get back in bed,” the hunter sighed. Cass looked up at Dean, blinked slowly, and obeyed. Dean settled the food on the bedspread and sat near Castiel’s feet under the covers. He handed Castiel a cup he brewed for him, settling the other two on the nightstand by the bed before settling his own coffee cup on his thigh. Castiel ate slowly, his throat still painful, but Dean was secretly pleased he was eating everything Dean put before him. He even took the drinks without complaint.
"Cold. Dark. Though more like a dreamless sleep if anything. Even when things are quiet, there's still the voice inside your head, your consciousness, inner dialogue. In the empty there wasn't even that, not until Jack of course."
They played one game with Cas as the ghost before deciding to take a break, there was only 15 minutes left of blackout (hopefully) before the power returned. Charlie said she wanted to set up the air mattress during the next 'power hour' as she called it, just in case the city decides to keep the power off throughout the night.
He and Cas each carried out a 6 pack and laid them on the ground in the thin cover of snow that managed to fall on their patio thanks to the wind.
Dean looked at him helplessly, and despite being here, in heaven with everyone he'd ever loved, he was still so confused and conflicted.
"Dean, did you want to take some beers out on the patio and leave them in the snow to get cold? it should only take a few minutes.
Dean's heart immediately beat out of his chest, blood pumping through his body at an alarming volume.
Dean glanced at the snowy patio concrete where the 2 six-packs of beer sat as the sound of an air mattress being inflated inside droned on behind him.
"Well we're going to risk a trip to Target tomorrow to try and buy, well, anything, but food mostly, you could see is they have better gloves, Cas needs a pair too," Jo explained.
To put it simply Dean felt awkward. What exactly do you say to your best friend who sacrificed himself for you after admitting his love which was his one true moment of happiness?
So much for the 'let's see how it goes' plan. Dean sat here in a sensible and homey living room with Cas across from him, one leg crossed comfortably over the other. He looked so at ease, his posture so relaxed.
Jo shot up immediately and ran to the kitchen, turning the dial to preheat the oven. Charlie flopped over to the couch and grabbed several remotes to turn on the TV and WiiU.
"Sure, I haven't had the chance to see the field covered in snow yet," Dean said, putting on his boots and coat.
"Yeah, I would go ask the RA on Call or whoever is at the front desk, we normally keep batteries down there for emergencies... Ok great, stay warm... thanks."
"Cas, after you were gone, after the empty took you, I tried to distract myself, even after we took out Chuck. First, it was hunts, work, then worrying about Sam, worrying about little things and jobs and which alias to use this go round, or which agency to use as cover," Cas smiled gently, Dean shook his head slightly to get back on track.
The inside of the car was just as cold and Dean shivered in his seat, carefully pulling out of the resident parking lot and onto the road. He knew to drive slow, and he could feel the snow crunching under his Baby, following the tracks of some poor bastard that had to come through here before him.
He can just wait and see how he reacts to seeing Castiel and whatever that initial reaction is is what he'll go with.
Dean took that first bite and almost died of happiness, it was the best goddam lasagna he's ever had, he couldn't even stop eating to praise Jo. Though he didn't really have to as Cas was quick to exclaim how good it was.
"Well, at least it finished cooking before the power quit again," Jo said, reaching over to light the candles still on the table.
Mary was quick to sit them down at the table and bring out the best beers from the fridge, and the conversation was quick to come.
Dean nodded in agreement and took one of the controllers from Charlie's outstretched hands, sitting next to her on their little IKEA couch.
"Maybe an hour? It was like 15 minutes after I picked up Cas and we got back," Jo said, to which Cas nodded in agreement.
"How about we have a couple of these, enjoy the night air, and then head in?" Dean proposed, grabbing two bottles and offering one to Cas.
They drove for a while, and it felt just like all those road trips, day trips, and night trips, and despite having Sam back, there was a tugging in Dean's chest for the company of someone else too.
"No I- I need to say this," Dean was certain that if he stopped again he would completely lose his nerve.
