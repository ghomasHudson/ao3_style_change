“You’ve been staring at me for 10 minutes without saying a word,” said Castiel, breaking the silence.   “Do I have something on my face?”
Dean confirmed that originally they planned to only get the audio recording of Alistair incriminating himself.  There had been a small microphone taped to the back of Dean’s belt in case Alistair had dragged Dean away from the cabin, and a second one hidden on the porch.  Benny had suggested the extra cameras, which gave them the visual to go with the audio.
Lee shook his head in disbelief.   “Not good man.”
Castiel was lying behind Dean, both of them on their sides, as Castiel made love to his mate.
“Are you walking home?  We could give you a lift?” said Sam eagerly.
Castiel was leaning weakly against the wall, the shock of the event causing him to breath heavily.   Dean gripped his arm reassuringly, practically keeping him upright.  In his shocked state, Castiel didn’t even try to pull away.
Dean made several attempts to engage Castiel in conversation during the lesson, but Castiel provided only single word answers.
“That too,” said Castiel, continuing to kiss and suck at Dean’s neck.   “And what you don’t know, maybe we can learn together.”
Upon arriving at Gabriel’s, he was greeted by Rowena holding baby Michael, and dancing around their lounge as Gabriel sang along, extremely loudly and very badly to Heart’s, ‘All I Wanna Do’, on the stereo, which Gabriel said was now Dean and Castiel’s song. Gabriel insisted Dean and Cas’s tale was a ‘Heart Story’ not a love story.  After actually listening to the words of the song, Castiel reluctantly agreed to the parallel.  It didn’t stop Castiel from calling Gabriel an “Assbut” and threatening to set Meg on him.
Thank you so much to everyone again for your lovely comments.  There have been some amazing ideas and suggestions for where people think this story will go.   I wish I had thought of them!
Dean had genuinely thought he would be sexually frustrated as hell by now.  He was used to hooking up regularly, but spending time with Cas had curbed any desire for random one night stands.   He wanted to be with Cas, and he surprised himself when he realised that he was comfortable to proceed at Cas’s pace.
“These are all safe.  Promise,” said Gabriel making a scout salute.
When they reached the 3
Sam took a seat in the chair on the other side of Dean, out of the way. “Anything I can do to help?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The following page was Cas posing outside, looking like he was working on a farm.   Wearing nothing but jeans and a cowboy hat.   Dean had to remind himself to breathe when he saw that one.   Cas shirtless carrying a haybale across his shoulders, biceps taut with a sheen of sweat across his upper body, his blue eyes looking directly into the camera.   A sexy smirk on his lips.
He felt Castiel tense.   “Just relax and listen to the music,” Dean said, “feel the rhythm, don’t force it.  If it helps, close your eyes.”
"Do you intend to stay with Dean for the rest of his life? However long or short that may be?"
Sam goldfished again for a longer period, before nodded quickly grasping to the suggestion like a drowning man.  “You got it Cas.  That’s exactly it. I’m kinda waiting for a phone call from a girl I like.”
Sam came bouncing down the stairs just as Dean returned with the ice packs and some tea towels.    Gabriel had managed to get Castiel's hoodie and T-shirt off and was gently checking over his ribs and back.  “Definitely some cracked, possibly a broken rib.  Back’s bruised too.”
The night was warm, and there was no need to turn on the fire in the room, although Dean did think it would have added a nice ambiance.   Instead he turned on the small table lamp by the window, before turning off the room light.     It gave them enough light to see each other, but still be intimate.
Dean is back in court after Jack's birth.
“Cas, just touch me,” said Dean hoarsely.  “You’re killing me here.”
Alistair setting fire to the cabin had been a surprise.  Dean had thought it most likely that Dean would be dragged off for a beating.  He’d made it look like two people were inside, with 2 wine glasses, two plates of food etc, in case Alistair went inside looking for Castiel.   Castiel’s actual absence would be explained by him having used trap door to escape, to explain why they couldn’t find him in the cabin.  Dean had made a recording that made it sound like someone was in the cabin with him, putting it on a loop to save him having to talk constantly until Alistair arrived.   As soon as Alistair knocked on the door of the cabin, Dean had silenced the playback.
“That was the meds making me sleepy,” Castiel objected, climbing into bed.  “I am sure he was just being a good Samaritan.  I mean isn’t there a thing where people that save someone feels responsible for them?”
“We had 2 working days to inform Judge Reaper about Jack’s birth. I was going to do it on Monday. But someone must have tipped off the Lafitte’s, because Ketch already informed the court, and somehow they managed to get a hearing arranged for Monday afternoon,” said Sam. “We only found out late on Friday. Crowley called and spoke to the court clerks personally, to try to get a postponement. But they won’t budge. I guess Noah pulled some strings or paid someone off. He’s got clout, that’s for sure.”
Cas smiled, “yes we can.”
Dean caught a flash of something across his father’s face.   Pride, concern, anger, fear, or perhaps a combination of all of them.
Dean and Castiel go public at school, take their relationship the next step, and discuss their future.
Until this point in his very long life, Castiel had only ever experienced two significant kisses.   The one he had bestowed on Meg, the other he had experienced with April.    Neither could compare to the feelings that blossomed within Castiel as Dean’s lips touched his.    Castiel could feel Dean’s desire, his love, his trust and belief in Castiel, burning through his touch.  It was intoxicating and powerful.
A small chuckle escaped from Castiel, "It's OK Sam.   I have 4 older brothers.  I know how annoying they can be."
“Please Dean.  Please.  I need you,” panted Castiel.
“Er, none yet.” Dean could hear Patience tapping away on the computer.
He continued to watch as Cas, his eyes still closed, bent at the waist and scooped up his Angel Blade from where it rested at his feet. Dean hadn’t even realised it was there. Another series of movements followed, initially slowly, but then gradually building up speed. The blade repeated caught the sunlight and glinted and flashed as Cas lunged, pulled back, dropped, span, rolled and sliced. Finally Cas began to slow down again and came to a stationary position facing Dean, his arms at his side, blade in hand, his feet in a strong defensive stance. There was a calm silent moment, before Cas opened his eyes and fixed his blue eyes direct on Dean.
Castiel returned to school on the Monday after taking the week off school.  His face was still a mass of bruises, but now they more green’s and yellows than blacks and blues.  It was so bad that it caused several of the girls to back away from him.   Castiel was used to hiding, and usually had a seat at the back of his classrooms anyway.  He kept the hood of his hoodie up concealing most of his face, and his eyes down.   Fortunately, the doctor that Gabe had engaged, had written a Doctor’s note for him, so he would be excused from PE until his ribs were better.  But he was still worried about getting accosted in the corridors to and from class and during breaks.
“Wow, that’s so cool,” said Sam impressed.
“If his shower is wet, he came back from his run.   If it’s dry, he didn’t return,” said Dean impatiently.
Looking at him, Dean could see that Castiel was now nervous.  He took his hand and squeezed gently.  “Yeah.   You can’t get rid of me that easily.”  Dean kissed Castiel quickly, just a peck on the lips.  “Are you frighten to face Gabriel?” asked Dean, although he himself was a little wary after Gabriel’s discussion with him yesterday.
His heart pounding, Dean managed to bring the car to a halt and looked backwards to see what he’d either, a) skilfully managed to avoid or b) clipped and probably killed.
“Seriously, this is too much,” said Dean, concerned.
Castiel stuck his tongue out at Gabriel but closed his eyes and sunk back in the pain free, blissfulness of sleep.
The message had come from Castiel’s phone, but it wasn’t from him.    Dean’s stomach turned over for real this time.  The message contained a picture.  It was Castiel, clearly tied up and blindfolded.  He was lying on the floor of wherever he was being held.  He was wearing his running gear, but Dean could see that it was extremely dirty, like he’d been dragged, and there was a rivulet of blood snaking its way from Castiel’s temple down the side of his face.   “Fuck no!” exclaimed Dean.   The phone pinged again.   This time there was a message.
Lurching towards Castiel, surprising him, Dean silenced him with a fierce kiss.   Castiel found himself both pushed back by Dean’s assault, but also being dragged forward as Dean gripped his jacket and pulled him forward eagerly, devouring his mouth.   “Cas,” he mumbled between kisses.  “You…. You’re amazing.  This… it’s too much.”
Thanks to my lovely beta's, Sailor_fujoshi and Breezeranger from Discord.
Somewhat taken aback by Gabriel’s speech, Dean was nevertheless glad that Gabriel was being so honest. “I’m not gonna apologise for being able to defend myself or my family, Gabe.  Today I was able to get Cas back, only cos I knew how to do what needed to be done.   Take the win.”  He paused.  “You see a gun or a knife and see a means to hurt someone.  I see a tool, only as good or as bad as the person that uses it.   I know you’re worried about Cas.  I am gonna worry too, every second I’m not with him.  I saw how scared he was every day.  How he was treated by people that should have loved him unconditionally.  I want him away from this town as much as you do.  I want him to go to Berkeley.  I do love him Gabe, I love him enough to know he has to go.  I have to let him go for now.  I don’t know what our future looks like a year, or four years from now.   We’ve talked and we know we’ll be apart for a while.   I made a promise to him, I intend to keep it.   But I’m not giving him or us up.  Not unless Cas himself tells me that’s what he wants.”
Breaking apart, Dean signed to Cas the word ‘promise’, and Castiel signed it back.  It was Dean’s way of confirming to Castiel that he would come back to him, and Castiel acknowledging it.    Dean turned and saw his Dad watching them with a small smile on his face.   Dean blushed.
“Dean,” protested Sam.
It took Dean’s sleep deprived brain a few moments to understand. When it finally sank in he looked aghast at Castiel’s earnest expression. “You can’t do that. Shit. You take the room, and I’ll take the car.”
From Dean, Sunday 6.53pm.               Dad just left.  I am not grounded anymore.  Want some company?
Sighing with relief, Dean quickly joined Castiel in the house, as the woman that had opened the door to Castiel closed it behind Dean. Dean could tell she was a Beta, and relaxed a little.
Castiel was gripping the bed sheets, his eyes wide, his mouth clenched as though he trying not to scream.   Dean couldn’t tell if it was with pain or pleasure.
“Wow.”
Considering her words carefully, “I’ll let Dean fill you in on the full details.  But Dean isn’t facing any charges,” said the Sheriff.  “Suffice to say, we’ll be throwing every charge possible at the boys in custody, including attempted murder.”
With a quickness that completely took Dean by surprise, Cas suddenly moved. One second they were standing, the next Cas had moved, pivoted and taken Dean down, lying him on the sand and covering him with his own body.
“Words Cas,” teased Dean smiling at him.
Dean spent the rest of the lesson on tenterhooks, unable to concentrate.  Castiel finally sent Dean a text message and said he would call him later.  That didn’t exactly make Dean feel any better.
“Yes.  Harder,” Castiel begged. Dean snapped his hips, nailing his prostate on every thrust, and Castiel just about sobbed.  He was an incoherent mess, “please….. oh….. Dean…. Please.” He begged.  “I’m close.”
“Goodbye Dean.”   Castiel watched as Dean drove away, before shutting the door to find Gabriel standing in the lounge watching him.   “Don’t say a word.”
Rubbing his extremely wet neck, Dean’s brain finally caught up with what the man had said. “I did apply blockers. I guess the rain washed them away.”	He looked across at the stranger and took a careful breath. He couldn’t smell anything specific though. “Are you an Alpha?”
“You were never a scout,” said Castiel.
“You’ve thought about this,” said Castiel.
“I understand a little sign language.  There was a deaf lady in our congregation when I was younger.  I tried to learn a bit for her,” said Castiel. “But I think you may have modified some of the gestures.
Dean knew that Sam really should have skipped a grade already, but with their itinerant lifestyle, schools were usually unwilling to take a chance and push a student that might not be around for long.   Dean might not be at genius level, but an eight year old teaching a four year how to read and write, and grade three maths, meant that Sam was already well prepared when he did reach elementary school, and that continued throughout their spotty education.   Dean never babied Sam when it came to learning, pushing him to understand the stuff Dean was learning, and now Sam was outstripping Dean’s knowledge.
Another tear tracked down Sam’s face.  “Dean wanted me to baby sit Cas,” he said finally.
Castiel’s feet making small steps, just gently rocking back and forth initially and then slightly more deliberately, the pair slowly and carefully moved around the space.
Working efficiently, Jess and Castiel soon had Jack extracted from the incubator. Castiel removed his tie, and started to unbutton his shirt, to allow Jack better skin to skin contact . He couldn’t help but notice that Dean was watching him. Dean was unconsciously biting his lip and kept flicking his eyes from Castiel’s collar bone to his lips and back again. There was a tiny hint of desire in the look on Dean’s face, and he dropped his eyes embarrassed, when he realised Castiel had seen him staring.
“Sure thing.” Dean indicated Sam. “This is my brother Sam. You can talk in front of him.”
“You ass,” grumbled Dean, as he bent to pick up the football.    He gazed past Benny’s shoulder and watched as Castiel slowed his sprint to a gentle jog.
Neither knew who had initiated the move, but in a synchronised motion they moved towards Dean’s bed.  Castiel sat down, and Dean sat across his lap, his knees either side of Castiel’s firm thighs.   Castiel kissed up Dean’s chest, neck and jaw, splaying his hands across Dean’s back and shoulders, as Dean raked his nails through Castiel’s untamed hair.
"Quod sic. Sed miror ego sum facis?" said Castiel back in surprise.   (**Yes.  But I am surprised you do?)
There was a drainage ditch along the side of the track.   He placed the blowtorch in the ditch, wedging it in the soft ground and lit it, turning it low, hoping the gas would last.   He placed the frying pan over it went back to stand at the rear of the Impala, making careful note of where the pan was.  It was deep enough not to be seen from the carpark.  He would only have seconds to make his move if his plan worked.
Castiel blushed.   “Can’t say I have.  It’s all seems a bit weird when you actually know some of the actors.”
Dean had been open about his sexuality with Sam since they had both left home for college.   When Dean had made his big announcement, Sam had just nodded, said “OK”, and told Dean he should keep the noise down.   Apparently, Sam had always suspected Dean was Bisexual, and was just glad that Dean could now be open rather than hide that aspect of his life.
Sam smiled reassuringly. "Look, there is a tradition in almost every family, that when someone starts a new relationship, usually the father, but occasionally the brothers, will get concerned and question the other party about their intentions towards the family member. Now this is normally something that is reserved for the boys dating girls. Boys are generally allowed to make their own mistakes." Sam coughed, "but for Dean, I am making an exception. He's too important to me, and Donna, and Jody, to not have 'the talk' with you."
Castiel stiffened slightly.  “Dean, did I hurt you?”
The comments and whispers about Castiel’s new look at school, had tapered off significantly by the end of the week, especially after Benny had practically growled when someone had suggested that Castiel’s new clothes were from a Sugar Daddy.
“Very sure,” said Dean.  He didn’t want to tell Charlie how many times he’d called it out that night or dreamt about it since.
“Now that’s a good look on you,” said Dean roughly from the side.  He cleared his throat, and said, “anything there you hate?”
“Uh, OK,” said Sam cautiously.
“Oh honey. I know you’re worried. I can promise you, we’re all doing everything we can to keep you and your pup safe,” she said. “You’re doing so well.” Missouri saw Sam reach for a bottle of water for Dean. “Do me a favour, and just rinse your mouth and spit it out. Don’t drink it down.” She saw the look on Dean’s face. “Trust me.”
“Dean’s fine. I’ve been seeing Doctor Moseley.”
“Oh lawd,” drawled Benny.  “Yep, definitely take him shopping Cher.   We’ll be there Monday morning to support you both.”
Nodding, Castiel agreed wholeheartedly.
“Hospital.”
Dean suddenly grabbed Castiel by the hips and pushed him away, panting heavily.   “Woah.  Just give me a moment.”
“A little,” confessed Castiel.  “You know older brothers.”
“I don’t know how to dance.”  Castiel sighed.  “I don’t want to disappoint her.”  He indicated his phone connected to the stereo, “she sent me songs to practice to.  I watched some online videos, but they were not as helpful as I hoped.”
Dean hoisted himself up on a desk and looked at Castiel, shrugging.   “Does it matter?”
Castiel stared at him, “Everyone, and I mean everyone is going to assume you’re gay.   You have no idea of the level of hell that entails in this school, or in this town.”   A sudden thought struck him.   “You’re not gay though, are you?”
Dean gaped.  “That’s worse!   Jesus man, you don’t even have a job.   I made you spend nearly a grand, in one go, without blinking.   You aren’t going to have to do something dumb to pay that off, are you? Like sell a kidney?”
Dean pulled Castiel inside his room, and shut the door by the simple effort of pushing Castiel against it.   He slid his hands up and across Castiel’s chest, marvelling at the firmness of the muscles beneath Castiel’s shirt.
Dean had already moved over to Jack’s incubator, and was looking down at him, as though checking he was still there. “He’s so much stronger, but still looks tiny.”
Castiel wasn’t surprised when Dean left his seat to the join the girls.   He was both disappointed, because for a moment he imagined having Dean as a friend, but also relieved, because he wouldn’t want to make Dean’s life difficult, and being friends with Castiel would certainly be difficult.   The conflicting thoughts in his head were too confusing, and he couldn’t help but watch as Dean chatted amicably with the group before he turned and made his way back to the seat next to Castiel as the teacher entered the room.
“I know.  But the guy doesn’t even own a pair of jeans,” said Dean.
“But they didn’t,” protested Dean.
From Dean, Sunday 8.19pm.               Words Cas.   Use your words.
When they returned to the lounge, Sam was looking at Dean very curiously.  Dean signed to him behind Gabriel’s back ‘later’.
“I picked that one,” said Castiel defensively.
“I’m sorry Sam,” said Gabriel remorsefully.  “I didn’t mean to embarrass you.  Let’s change the subject.”   His eyes fell on Castiel who stared back at him shaking his head with horror, knowing he was about to be the subject of the next conversation. “You know Zar, Castiel and Dean recently went to Topeka on a shopping trip and brought ….“
They made their way back downstairs to the Great Room and were met by a waiter.   “Hello, I’m Ryan,” said the waiter.   “It’s a lovely evening, and we have some tables set up on the patio if you would prefer to eat outside.”
“Yoga?” said Dean curiously.
It was at lunch time Friday that Lee made a suggestion to Dean.   They were sitting up high in the bleachers, so no one was around to hear them.   This had become their favourite spot for hanging out because it was far enough from the school to be private, but they could also see anyone approaching.
“I didn’t recognise you with the British accent,” said Dean.   “Mr Ménage à douze.”
“Not that you’re leaving town.  But that you are leaving him.”
Sam leant over so Dean could speak quietly into his ear, “If anything happens to me. You. You take care of Jack.”
“Cas, please… oh holy…” Dean broke off.
Dean strongly suspected that Ryan was aware they were both under 21, and he didn’t want to cause any issues. “A Coke or a Pepsi is fine for me.”
“Oh that’s nice,” said Castiel picking up the wide leather bracelet with the pressed studs he had admired earlier.  “I liked that one.
Dean licked into Castiel’s mouth.  It was wet, messy and Castiel just about sobbed.
Dean couldn’t help the blush that coloured his cheeks.  “Do I want to know how much he told you?”
John paused for what felt like an eternity, before relenting.  “Fine.  But you both do as you are told.  If I say ‘stay in the car’, you stay in the car.”
A second finger slid in and Dean could feel the difference immediately.  “Oh fuck.”
I've been brave and added the number of remaining chapters.   Everything is pretty stable story wise, so I won't keep you waiting longer than I have to.     Thanks to Sailor_fujoshi and Breezeranger - you both rock.
"Did I hurt you?" asked Cas with concern. "I have been threatened with death if I hurt you."
“My brother,” said Dean. “He’s not here, but he’s on his way.”
“Good to know,” said Dean with a slight hesitation to his voice.
“Yes,” said Dean. “And my last.”
“Are you here with Castiel?  Bit of bondage with the school’s resident gay whore.”
He was just adjusting the laces on a pair of Converse high tops when Noah knocked the door.   “I’ve brought you some bracelets and things that I thought you might like to try with the more casual outfits.”
Dean was excited to see Castiel on Monday.  They’d texted on the previous evening to agree what outfit Castiel would wear.   Finally narrowing it down to two, Dean agreed to let Castiel decide on the Monday morning, so it would also be a surprise for Dean.  They had also agreed that Castiel would stop avoiding Dean in school.  Dean had pointed out that Benny and Lee already knew they were friends.   The whole stop hiding or ‘fake it till you make it’ mentality wouldn’t really work if Castiel was avoiding everyone.
“Definitely.   Maybe we can use Gabriel’s back garden?   We can visit after school if you like, take you through some basic stuff.”
Sam thought it would be a great adventure to spend time at the house and spent a lot of time discussing film making (the non porn kind), film production and camera work with Gabriel.  The fledging lawyer in him was also fascinated by the detailed contracts that Gabriel used, and begged him to let him read a few blank templates.
“Not really.   You?” replied Dean.
Picking up the tags, Dean saw that the original tags had been beaten out, and reengraved.  Now they read, Dork and Assbutt.
As always a huge thanks to Sailor_fujoshi for being the most helpful Beta I could hope for.   But all mistakes are mine.
Taking a deep breath, and concentrating on just a single patch of skin on Castiel’s back, Dean sighed.   “Growing up, with Dad drinking, or taking off the way he did, there were times, and I ain’t proud of this, but there were times when I needed money to buy food or clothes for Sammy.   Well, let’s put it this way, I was considered pretty back then, and truckers travelling a long way from home often need company, and they pay well for it.  There are also a lot more male truckers than female ones.”
… ~~~ ...
“Right.  Dean, can I call you Dean? Who’s your obstetrician?”
Castiel’s scent soured, and Gabriel cringed. “Wow. OK bro, let’s get you out of here.”
Of course, the darkness made it impossible to see anything and Dean regretfully realised he would have to get out of the car to check. It might have been a deer, but equally in all good conscience he couldn’t not check, just in case it was a person.
Dean looked confused, "and how do you know about these sites exactly?"
Sorry for another angsty chapter with Benny.
“They had a knife?” exclaimed Gabriel.
“What are you sorry for?” said Dean confused. “I’m the one who spoilt…”
“I've got blockers in the car,” said Sam. “Let’s get you to the hospital then.” Sam picked up Dean’s bag, and held the door open for him. “Are you in any pain?”
Suddenly his phone pinged with a notification.  He smiled when he saw it was from Castiel.   He must be texting from the car.
Confused, Gabriel opened a drawer and removed a cook’s blow torch, “Will this work?”
“It’s because of me, isn’t it Sam?” said Castiel.   “Because they attacked me.”
"Yes," Castiel stated simply.   "This is an old worksheet, and I told them about the error when I encountered it, years ago.    They have obviously never bothered to fix it."
Dean nodded approvingly, "you know me well. But my favourite time of year was always around August when the Perseids meteorite shower would be visible. We'd lie out for hours watching for shooting stars and making wishes."
They exited the car, and Dean glanced around.   “Just to check, given the issues in Lawrence you’ve had.  They aren’t going to have a problem here with us are they?”
Supernatural – Supernatural - Supernatural – Supernatural - Supernatural – Supernatural
“And he’s in one piece, as requested,” said Dean meaningfully at Gabriel, who nodded his acceptance.
"Are you OK with that? I mean waiting. I really want you make you feel good Cas. Like you did for me. Not just some clumsy hand…." Cas kissed him again.
“Gabriel told me you hoping to head for California.  Berkeley no less,” said John addressing Castiel.
“Not yet.  But it could be.  Don’t close yourself off so completely to that possibility,” said Gabriel with all seriousness.
“Oh,” said a disappointed Castiel.  “In that case I guess I’ll see you on Monday.  But I’ll text you later.”
“Will you come to me, Omega mine,” Castiel growled softly, holding out his hand not supporting Jack.
Castiel still looked unsure.
It was now mid July, and Dean’s third court mandated medical appointment. Sam had accompanied Dean to this one, as Charlie was away for a few days, attending a book signing tour with Gilda. Dean knew she had been conflicted about leaving Dean, but they had both really been looking forward to some time away with together. Dean had insisted she go. He was six weeks away from his due date, and Gilda and Charlie deserved some time together away from Lawrence.
Returning the offer, Dean cut a piece of his burger and held it out to Castiel, in turn.  Castiel opened his mouth and let Dean gently place the piece of burger on his tongue, before closing his mouth around the fork and letting Dean pull it free.  Castiel closed his eyes in enjoyment at the taste.  “That tastes delicious.”
Castiel opened his eyes confused, and then with dawning realisation.   “Sorry,” he mumbled.
“Safe from what?” said Castiel completely confused.
“You may have got out, but at least we got Castiel,” said Alistair.
“What’s your problem? Jealous?” said Dean coldly.  “Feel like you’re missing out.  Who’d you want more, me or him?”
“True,” said Gabriel.  “So I’ll ignore that, and I will say this.   He seems like a good guy Cassie.   He’s good for you.”
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
Dean wasn’t sure exactly what had disturbed him.  He usually only slept for four to five hours a night anyway.  Glancing at his watch displaying 5am, he knew he wouldn’t be going back to sleep now anyway.  He slipped from his bed, pulling on a soft sweatshirt, and padded to the kitchen to get a drink of water.   He stared out the window as first soft glow of daylight was just beginning to take the edge of the dark night.    Changing the sky from an inky black to dark blue.
The Roadhouse was exactly that.   A large place next to road that led out of town.  It was loved by students because the drinks were reasonably priced, and there was often a visiting band giving free entertainment.
Choking and spluttering, Castiel tried to construct a sentence.   “I am not… I didn’t.”   He swallowed.   “Just don’t talk to me anymore and they’ll accept you.”
“Will Castiel have to be involved?” asked Dean.   “I mean, he wasn’t there.”
Sam didn’t look particularly happy at this reassurance, he glared at Castiel. "You know, the only reason I am not punching you right now is because of what you did for Jack."
Gabriel held up his hands in a gesture of surrender.  “I wasn’t going to say anything.”
Dean couldn’t help his cock reacting to that and it twitched in front of Castiel’s face.
Looking up at Dean, Castiel got another full-frontal look at Dean’s body.   Dean’s wasn’t as big or as thick as Castiel, but he was beautifully proportioned, and was already half hard as he stepped, unashamed, out of the bath.  Once he was stable and there was no danger of him slipping, Dean grabbed the towel he dropped earlier and wrapped it around his waist.    He held up another towel for Castiel as he too climbed out of the bath, which Castiel wrapped around him.    Taking another smaller towel, Dean gently patted Castiel’s chest to dry him, before quickly wiping his own, and heading back into the bedroom.
Castiel cowered slightly, reaching for his bag and swinging his legs out from under the table, ready to make a run for it.   “I was just leaving.”
“Dean,” Castiel admonished. “Don’t think like that.”
Castiel threw a piece of bread at Gabriel and turned to Zar.   “Perhaps you’d like to tell Dean and Sam the story of how you almost got expelled from university in France.  But maybe make it the PG version.”
Dean leaned in for another kiss as his hand slipped under the waist band of Castiel’s boxers and across his firm backside.  A soft teasing of fingernails scraping his skin caused Castiel to shiver slightly.   Dean stroked and touched Castiel’s hip under the boxers before raising himself up and moving down the bed to pull them down.   He looked down at Castiel, now lying naked on the bed.    Removing his own briefs, he watched as Castiel hungrily gazed up and down his body.
Dean reached up and touched his cheek like he could still feel Castiel’s lips.  He gave a little smile himself and joined his friends back in the Impala.
Cas gently pulled back slightly, giving Dean a chance to take a much needed breath. He pulled the young man into a simple embrace, this time no kissing, just warmth and acceptance. Dean's chin resting in the crook of his neck. "It's OK Dean, it's OK." He kept murmuring, whilst stroking his back.
The music was definitely louder in the hall way.   Humming along to the tune, he padded along the corridor, and into the kitchen.   But that was empty.
To Bitch: 8.36pm     Really?
“No, Cas wasn’t….”
“I’m a film producer and director.  Adult Entertainment films.”   Gabriel ran his hand over the duvet on the bed smoothing it down.   “My office is upstairs, I set this space up to save the cost of renting hotel rooms, or Air BnB’s.  You’d be surprised how upset the hosts get when a film crew turns up.  I rent it to my own film company – income, tax breaks, it all works out.”
Best wishes everyone.  Stay safe and well.
“No!” said Castiel.  “Don’t.   Please don’t do that.”
Dean sighed heavily and looked down at Gabriel.   “Given your reaction, I guess the bracelet also means something explicit?  Care to share with the rest of the class?”
"Hey Cas, what's your address?" Dean asked, throwing a look of concern at him.
Cas gently reached over and kissed him, moaning slightly as Dean nipped at his neck. "Probably not."
"Earlier when ….."
Dean was therefore surprised, and secretly thrilled, when after he entered his first class, English Literature, the teacher, an African American man named Mr Henriksen just pointed to a seat in the second row.
“Maybe we should …” started Dean concerned.
Dean grinned and kissed Cas again. He slowed his movements and saw an unhappy frown flicker across Cas's face. Dean slowly raised himself off Cas, so he was on his knees next to him. The lack of immediate stimulus allowed Dean's brain to catch up. Slowly Dean reached down and undid his own belt buckle watching Cas's face carefully as he watched Dean's actions. He saw Cas unconsciously lick his own bottom lip as Dean popped the button and lowered the zip on his jeans teasing Cas with just glimpse of his lower abs. The look of lust on Cas's face sent a spasm through Dean's groin, and his cock twitched in response.
Castiel looked a little confused at the comment, but made his way out the sofa area again, where Dean was waiting.  He took his place in front of the mirror as before, this time automatically adjusting his stance to be straight and tall.
“Great,” said Dean with relief lowering his hands.   “I got Alistair here, and I don’t think he can walk.”
"Yes, and Yes."
"I apologise."
Tilting his head on one side confused and clearly unsure, he replied “No one’s called me that before.”   Castiel signalled to the door.   “I have to get to my next class.”
When Friday arrived, Dean’s found himself pulling the Impala up outside Gabriel’s house at 5.50pm.  Feeling very nervous, he decided to leave his overnight back in the trunk.   He decided that bringing it into the house, might be seen as presumptuous.
Dean had already been thinking about Jody’s suggestion of applying for a Patient Care Assistant role, and promised Castiel that they would both talk about it further before making any decisions.
Dean shook his head and closed his eyes. “I’m good. Just give me a moment.”
Dean hovered near Cas just in case he suddenly keeled over.  He had no idea what to say.  Nothing he could say would make the situation better.   He sighed with relief as Gabriel returned carrying first aid kit, and a bowl of warm water.  "Dean-o, could you get some ice packs out of the freezer?  There are some physiotherapy gel ones on the upper shelf. Grab a few."
Nodding mutely, Dean paid for his purchases and walked hurriedly back to the flat he shared with his brother.   Fortunately, Sam was out at work, so Dean was able to take it into his bedroom without the usual judgemental stares.
“So what do you want to do about this boy then?”
Sucking in a breath, Benny found it hard to drag his eyes away from the Cas’s prone form.   Focusing on the picture, he took the phone, zoomed in on the background and then moved around the screen.  “He’s on carpet.  Weird lighting, looks like curtains covering a run of small windows.  That blue wall at the back, I don’t think it’s a wall.  It looks more like a car door.”
“Dude, I know Gabe said to go wild, but that….”
Castiel put his arm around Dean’s waist as they walked back to the hotel.  They walked quietly upstairs to their room, snatching quick glances at each other.
Cas turned to look at Dean with a smile and a curious tilt to his head.  He was wearing jeans and button down, just like in one the photoshoots.  Where was his Cas with the stupid jumpers, or the flower patterned t-shirts?   How could Cas look so normal?  Dean had spent the last three hours thinking whether anything Cas had said had been real, and there he was, standing at the bar, talking to Sam, like Dean’s whole world hadn’t just crumbled like a sandcastle on the beach.
Dean burst out laughing, “only you could say something like and make it sound hot.”
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
Dean was confused, Castiel seemed smart and helpful.  He couldn’t understand Castiel’s reluctance to engage with him.  But as Castiel seemed to be intent on pushing him away, Dean respected his wishes and dropped back to bit, staying about four steps behind him, as Castiel headed up a flight of stairs.
They sat drinking their beers, in silence for the next 30 or so minutes, before John dropped a twenty on the bar and they walked back to the car.
“Only about 50 times,” said Dean rolling his eyes and gazing at Castiel fondly.
“Bitch,” said Dean fondly.
Thanking Missouri for her time and attention Dean and Sam left. It was after Sam had dropped Dean off at his apartment, Dean realised that she hadn’t scheduled the next appointment.
This is a relatively short chapter, the next will be longer to make up for it.
People were moving out of Castiel’s path, like the parting of the Red Sea.   When he reached Dean, he stopped directly in front of him.  “Hello Dean.”
Dean slowly moved his hips.  Pulling slowly out of Castiel, until only the head of his dick remained inside, before firmly and slowly pushing back in.    “Fuck Cas.  You feel so good.”   He pulled back again, and could feel Cas trembling beneath him.  “Am I hurting you?”
“Why?” said Castiel confused.
“Sorry Cas, I didn’t quite catch that?”
“Excellent.  I’ll go get those, why you look at the menus.”  Ryan took the wine glasses off the table with him.
“And they are prejudiced bigots,” said Dean crossly.  He sat back down, and folded his arms, waves of anger radiating from him.  “Small town America, Sam.  It’s not quite as bad as Alabama, but not far off.   Not everyone is as accepting as you and Dad.”
“Night Cas.”
“You really don’t have to…” protested Dean. All he wanted was a warm bed.
“I’d like to say yes he has, but there have been times, when I wandered down for breakfast to find several naked people getting coffee in the kitchen.  Actors, not Gabe’s girlfriends.”
“I wanted to do something special for you.”
Castiel:
Feeling much better and somewhat relieved after their text exchange, Dean relaxed and let himself drift off to sleep.
Considering the situation, Dean shook his head. “You go get a few hours sleep, Sammy. I’m gonna need you to be clear headed tomorrow. He can be with me tomorrow, right Doc?”
Castiel said nothing but fidgeted awkwardly.
That was not the answer Dean expected.   Was Castiel afraid of Dean?  Did Castiel think Dean would hurt him?   Dean panicked; Shit, was Castiel afraid of sex?  Dean had no idea what kind of sexual experience Castiel had except that time with April the Reaper. Maybe he was afraid of being with a man?  He paused to see if Castiel would elaborate further.   He didn’t.
"Sam," corrected Sam automatically, sending a glare at Dean.
"We need to get you up," said Dean, taking charge.   He focused on Castiel, "We'll do this in stages," he explained.   "First stage, Sammy will get on your left, I'll take right.   We'll lift you under your arms, 'til you're upright.  Lean on the car.  Then, second stage will be to get you in the car.  Sammy, you're in the back with him.   Try to keep him upright, so he doesn't lie down and choke on his tongue or something."    Dean stared into Castiel's scared blue eyes.   One of his eyelids was already swelling.     "You ready Cas?"
Dean gently tugged Castiel back down next to him, on his right side, Castiel’s head resting on his chest.    It took a few seconds before Castiel relaxed and just let himself rest against Dean.
They remained that way, just gently holding each other until there was a shout.
Saying nothing, Castiel stared at the buildings as they drove through the town.
Tipping his head on one side, Castiel studied Lee like he was looking for an insult in his comment.   “Yes.  That was one version.”
Another round of cheering and whistles suddenly made them realise that perhaps that type of kiss might be better saved for somewhere more private.
“Cas, I had a plan,” Dean tried to explain.
Indicating the phone, Dean said, “I think Cas is missing.  I’m on with Gabe.”  He put the phone on speaker mode so Benny could hear.
“We still need to sort out your hair,” Dean said, approaching him.   “I was thinking perhaps a bit of colour, just on the tips.  Maybe a bit of gel, to keep it wild.”  Dean reached out as if to touch Castiel’s hair, then pulled back suddenly, as though he realised what he was doing.
"Jerk."
“Yeah, sure.”   Dean opened the trunk and let Castiel deposit his own bag there.  Feeling very nervous, he unlocked the car for Castiel, and they climbed in.   He saw Gabriel standing at the door watching them, as he pulled away.
Castiel obeyed.  He closed his eyes, and waited for the music to recommence.
“Please what Cas?” he asked.  “Talk to me Angel.”
“Absolutely,” said Jess eagerly.
“I’ll get the food, Dean,” said Castiel stacking the bags under the table.  “My treat for all your help.”
“I was thinking Stanford,” said Sam defensively.   “I like the idea of law.”
“What about you Dean?” John asked, when Sam had run out of steam.
He was unsure whether it was Castiel’s new-found confidence or the fact that he was no longer alone that was keeping everyone away, regardless, Dean was pleased that at least at this moment, Castiel was smiling and happy.
Slowly Dean moved slightly from the waist down, canting his hips and pressing down firmly onto Cas's. Cas's eyes fluttered shut and his hands gripped Dean's hips tightly trying to prevent any further movement. Cas could feel the solid muscle of Dean's thighs along his own, and the hard, oh so very hard, presence of Dean's still fully clothed cock nestling against his own.
“Does he fight back?”
The man reacted instinctively when confronted by a stranger in his home.  His hand dropping to his hip and pulling a handgun on Castiel.
Castiel couldn’t deny that he was curious and concerned about Dean, but he was also captivated by the Omega within. Dean’s attractiveness was obvious, but it was more than that. Dean’s willingness to trust Castiel, to offer him a lift to town and to allow Castiel to see his vulnerable side when he confessed how long he’d been celibate. The Omega was a fascinating contradiction.
Suddenly he received a strong kick from Jack. “OK buddy. I get you. No more bad thoughts.”
“’m OK,” Dean mumbled knowing Castiel wouldn’t proceed until he confirmed. “Go ahead.”
Gently shaking his head, like he couldn’t quite believe he was doing this, Lee let out a long breath, “OK.  But you owe me like your first born for this.”
Cas shook his head, "we're both clean Dean."
Castiel pulled away and started walking again.  Dean ran in front of him and put his hands up against Castiel’s chest to stop him. Castiel just stood there, like he was exhausted, and couldn’t put up a fight anymore.  “Why did you put yourself in danger like that.  I told you what happened to people around me.  Didn’t you think about how I would feel?  How it would hurt me if something happened to you?” Castiel said, his voice cracking.
Castiel nodded and waited for her to leave.
Cas stood silent.
The smaller boy laughed.  “Good one Alistair.”
A tension that Dean didn’t even realise he had felt released.   He closed his eyes for a moment and just breathed.   “That is good news.”  Leaning back, he relaxed, “is it over then?”
The Omega in him responded to the instruction and he took a small sip. Soon a small piece of cookie was being offered to him, and without a word he accepted that too. Then another.
The quietness continued as Dean made breakfast.   He was in the kitchen cooking pancakes, whilst Gabriel made coffee.  Sam was sitting at the kitchen table reading one of Gabriel’s contracts and highlighting certain passages with an orange marker.  Castiel appeared tousled haired from the Playroom and snuck in behind Dean to give him a warm hug and a kiss on his neck as he cooked.
“Read them.”
Nodding mutely, he carefully stepped back to the porch, wiped his feet on the mat, and then went upstairs to their room.
“After the kiss between you two up at the cabin, I don’t think he’s worried about who sees you,” said Lee.
Sam entered and looked around the room with interest.
“Talk to me,” said Benny easily keeping up.
“Sheriff seemed to think so.”
Releasing Cas, he turned to Dean. “Call me tomorrow OK?”
Dean had been wondering about how much to share with his Dad.   A lot of what he’d learnt today was more about Castiel’s life and the shitty situation he was in.  “It was fine.  Usual stuff.  Girls, jocks, nerds, bullies.”
“So boys, how was your first day?” John asked, giving them his undivided attention.
“How on Earth did you come up with this plan?” asked Lee.   “Or do you lie in bed at night, and randomly think of ways to get yourself killed?”
“Hey Dean, do you want come and sit with us today,” called Lisa from the far side of the classroom.
Dean nodded in acknowledgement, and Benny shook Gabriel’s hand.  “Glad I could help,” said Benny modestly.
Waving off the comments, Gabriel passed Dean a mug of coffee and sat down.  “I’d say the pleasure was all mine, but I am sure Cassie would disagree,” he said with a smirk.
“Do it Cas, you can do it.”  Dean’s hand sped up.   “Feel it.  Want it.   Cum for me.”
“Don’t worry about, I guess your meds are still making you tired, and you need rest to heal,” said Dean taking the awkwardness out of the moment.  “The movie is about over, and we’d better give you two some peace and quiet.  Sam and I need to get going anyway.”
Resuming his seat, Castiel hesitated then dug several books from his bag.   One of them grabbed Sam's interest.
“What do you want me to say Cas?” said Dean angrily. “I am sorry I stood watching you, dance around practically naked in front of me. I am sorry I didn’t make my presence known.” Dean tried to reign in his temper. “Do you want to know that I got a boner watching you? That I wanted know what each and every one of your muscles felt like if I touched them? Wanted to know if you would lose control if I ….”
“Yeah, not a great Hallmark moment,” said Dean wryly.   “But after my friend left, he sat me down and told me story about an army buddy he served with, Scott.    Told me how Scott had been through training with him, had saved an entire team of guys by spotting an insurgent breaking into the camp, had actually saved my Dad’s life by pulling him back from an IED, and a thousand other things that Scott had done that didn’t just make him a great Marine, and a good man.   Then one day Scott confessed to my Dad that he was gay.   Now this was huge back then, the whole don’t ask don’t tell policy.   Well after everything Scott had done for the team, Dad decided he didn’t give a crap about Scott’s sexuality.  It made no difference to what Scott had done as person, as a comrade, as a human being, and it didn’t make him any less of a soldier or man.   My Dad said, ‘so what’, and squad carried on.  Scott was killed on their next mission, and my Dad, when he returned to the US went to visit Scott’s family, and met Scott’s partner, Cal. Dad said life was too short to worry about whether love was right or wrong, but was important
Fighting the bile rising in his throat Castiel realised that something was very wrong.  “What’s is it?”
“Hmmm.  I must be slipping, it’s usually over 100 times by now.”
Annie’s Song – John Denver
Alistair sniffed loudly in disapproval.   “I could hear you talking to someone in there.  Who you got with you?”
“White, mid thirties, around six feet tall. Dark, almost black hair and the bluest eyes. Oh, I don’t know if this helps, but his bike. It was a Triumph. A modern, expensive looking one. He said he didn’t know the area, so I assumed he was just passing through. He paid for the B&B, Ma Framptons, but I don’t know if it was cash or card. They may have a record. He never said where he was from or where he was going. He could be anywhere.” He saw Sam approaching with a bag of food. “Let me know what you find out. I gotta go Sam’s coming back. Please don’t say anything to anyone else.” He ended the call, and sent the photo he’d taken of Jack to Charlie.
“I gathered.”  He gestured widely to the room, “What’s with the music?”
“But if we stick together.  There’s safety in numbers,” persisted Lee.   “Hell everyone knows I’m straight, I ain’t worried about being seen with him.”
“Don’t pretend you haven’t tried it before,” said John with a resigned air.  “I saw you drunk as a skunk at Bobby’s last 4
“Boys,” said the deep voice of John approaching them. “The Sheriff has said we can leave, but you’ll need to go to her station tomorrow to make statements.”
Castiel had extended the house, to create some extra bedrooms, and bought a minivan for transporting their growing family. Initially Castiel had purchased a safe little Toyota for Dean to drive the kids around in, as the Impala was impractical for child seats. But he’d insisted on Dean keeping the Impala, which was now in the garage, and in return Dean had insisted on Castiel keeping his motorbike. Although Castiel didn’t get out on it as much as he used to, he would on occasion, when Dean wasn’t pregnant, and they had bribed or blackmailed their siblings or friends into babysitting, take Dean on the back of it, far out of the town, to a field to lie out and look at the stars.
Gabriel sat back and inspected the boys.   “OK.   I’ll believe the whole self-defence thing until I have evidence otherwise.   Cassie vouches for you, and you helped him when you had no cause to.”  He nodded to the knives.  “Put them away.  I don’t want to see them again unless you’re whittling wood.”
“Fine. Make your way straight to the Birth Centre at the rear of the hospital, and ring the bell. If anything changes regarding your condition before your brother gets there, call us back. OK?” instructed Patience.
As Dean sat waiting, he heard Castiel call out, from the changing room.  “I think I need a larger sized shirt.”
The female Omega had what appeared to be her Male Alpha with her, the Male Omega had a Male Alpha partner. All four of them looked at Dean with curiosity as he was wheeled in alone.
Dean was more than happy to provide direction and guidance to Sam about his homework, before settling down with yet another book from the infinite collection available to him.
“I’m not sure I’m that brave.”
Thanks to my lovely Beta's Breezeranger and Sailor_fujoshi for their efforts.   I so appreciate your help and the work you put in.
“She’s never named,” said the boy, quietly remaining seated.
They lay together for several minutes, before Dean said quietly, “I’m not upset.   But can you tell me why you stopped?”
Sam grinned suddenly, realisation dawning. "Is this about whomever you have tucked away in your room? I saw your sock message last night. Thanks for the heads up by the way."
OK. OK.  This is it, the two big moments you have all been waiting for.  Castiel and Dean seeing each other again, and Castiel finds out about Jack.
“Yes, it is.”   Dean stood up and offered his hand to Castiel.  “Walk with me?”  Castiel took Dean’s hand, interlocking their fingers, and they walked slowly away from the patio, along a gravel path towards one of the paddocks.
Dean snorted, and shook his head.  “No Cas. This is all me.  My free will.”  He let his eyes drop to Castiel’s mouth before flicking them back up to look into the concerned eyes of his Angel.   “I was too scared to say it before, but I am saying it now.  I need you to understand.  I love you so damn much.”
This chapter is definitely lighter, but not joyful, as we deal with Benny's funeral.
“Well unarmed fighting is one thing,” said Dean.  “Knives and guns present a different challenge.    Your policy of running, isn’t a bad one to adopt.”
Missouri cleaned up the ultrasound gel from Dean’s belly, and indicated he could get up. “Full term is around 40 weeks. 34 weeks would be fine, if Jack,” she smiled using Dean’s name for the pup, “was a little bigger.” She hummed thoughtfully as she looked at Dean. “I think a steroid injection would be a good idea.”
Puzzled, Ma watched as he returned and held out the helmet to her. She took it from him with a small frown on her face.
Walking into the hospital, hand in hand with his Omega, made Castiel’s heart soar. He felt honoured to be standing next to such a proud, strong, (and OK he may be biased) handsome Omega. Castiel didn’t know all the details, but he knew that Dean hadn’t had the easiest of lives. Especially recently, with Benny’s illness and death, and having to cope with being pregnant on his own, Castiel admired Dean’s inherent goodness. Castiel trusted that Dean would eventually share his past history with him, and allow Castiel to both physically and emotionally support him.
Looking at the card, Dean saw the law firm’s name, “Crowley & Son,” he looked up.  “Are they any good?”
Cas cocked his head on one side, in his 'I am confused' way. He placed the box at the end of the table, and sat in chair opposite Sam. "Is everything alright Sam?" asked Cas. "Is Dean OK?"
“Wonderful,” mumbled Dean. “Stay there, I’ll want you again shortly.”
Holy shit, he thought as caught a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror.   Castiel had done a real number on his neck and chest.  He had several dark pinky/purple hickeys, fortunately all of which would be concealed by his overshirt if he raised the collar slightly.   He must have been further gone than he realised if he hadn’t noticed Castiel making the marks.  He also found several on the inside of his thighs.  It gave him a small thrill to think that Castiel had been so possessive of him.
Sam was spending the day with Brady, one of his friends from school, who was having a pool party for his birthday.  Dean had met Brady’s parents when he dropped Sam off, and thought it would be a nice change for Sam.  Sam was under strict instructions to call Gabriel if there were any issues, as at least Gabriel was local.
Gabriel smirked.  “What’s on your mind Sam?”
Castiel climbed into the car, and Dean watched as they left.  Turning around he saw his father standing at the door watching them.
“Да,” said Dean smiling.  “You got it Angel.”
Castiel had been impressed Dean had remembered the brief language lesson considering they had been quite distracted at the time.
“I won’t say a word, Dean.  I swear,” promised Sam.   “I like Cas.”
“Breathe,” said Dean, “It’s OK.  You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to.”
Cas turned away, and moved slowly towards a large rock, where he’d left the motorcycle helmet and his clothes. Picking up a towel from the pile, he gently rubbed the sand from his shoulders and back from where he had rolled.
Doctor Brown smiled. “Good to know. OK. Let’s see how things are progressing.” She washed her hands in the sink, and approached him. “Can I take a quick look?”
“Oh. My apologies,” said the nurse turning red, but giving Sam a smile.
The man hesitated. “You may have a point.”
“Do you want it harder, Angel?” asked Dean watching Castiel unravel beneath him.
Sighing Gabriel smoothed down a lock of Castiel’s hair as he lay in bed, looking less like the 18-year-old man he was and more like the 12-year-old scared little boy Gabriel remembered.  “Oh Cassie.  You can’t keep blaming yourself for Kevin’s accident.  I’ll keep saying it until you believe it, but that wasn’t your fault.”
“Have fun kids, use protection, be careful, be safe,” said Gabriel.   “Bring him back in one piece Dean-o.”
Gabriel had made several jokes about Castiel’s virility, and being two for two when he found out that Dean was pregnant again so soon. Something Dean couldn’t help but be a little smug and proud of his Alpha about, even if it was a shock to be pregnant again so quickly. Even more so, the evening after they had the pregnancy confirmed, when Castiel took Dean and Jack to a lovely little Italian Restaurant, to find it completely decorated with fairy lights and rose petals, with all their friends and family there. Dean had turned to Castiel in delight, to find Castiel already down on one knee offering Dean a beautiful white gold ring, set with a thin line of blue diamonds. Dean cried, Castiel cried, and Jack cried, making them all laugh, and everyone agreed as far as proposals went, it was perfect.
Everyone including Sam laughed heartily.   “What happened?” said Sam.
Dean looked up in surprise.  Had Castiel had booked the room under Dean’s name?
“Nothing concrete.  A few nebulous ideas,” said Castiel modestly.
Sprinting back to Impala it took Dean less than 30 seconds to drive as close as he could to where Castiel lay.   He ran around the car, opening the rear door nearest to Castiel.   Castiel was already a little more aware of his surroundings that he was before.  Sam had managed to find a relatively clean handkerchief and was applying pressure to the cut above Castiel’s eye.
Dean considered the man in front of him. He was tall, and powerfully built. He looked to be slightly taller than Dean, but some of that no doubt was his large motorcycle boots, and helmet. Dean took a chance, “Look, I can’t leave you out here, in this weather. Can I give you a lift to town?”
“Don’t play innocent with me,” said Gabriel waving his soup spoon at them.  “I wrote the book and made a film.   Look, I appreciate everything you’ve done for Cassie.  Anything you boys need, I’m happy to help.  This is a safe space for you guys.   I just want to understand exactly the kind of grief I might encounter for it.   Show me.”
At his Doctors and Gabriel’s insistence, Castiel stayed home the following week on medical leave.   The situation at school was so hostile anyway, Castiel thought that home was probably safer, and he was able to keep up with work being sent to him on email or via Dean.
Doctor Brown stepped away back to the sink and washed her hands again. “I swear she’s psychic,” she said. Returning to Dean’s bedside, she updated Dean’s file of notes. “OK Dean. Firstly your pup is doing fine,” she pointed to a line on the monitor, showing the Fetal heartbeat. “You’re still in early labour. Now if your waters hadn’t broken I might consider trying to head off your labour, but right now, we’ll let nature take its course. Your contractions are not very strong and aren’t really doing much at this stage.”
“Not to worry, we’ll keep an eye on you here, and have the Doctor assess you,” said the nurse. “I’ll be back in a bit.” She left the room, closing the door.
“I don’t bite,” said Dean trying to be friendly.  “Well not unless you ask me to.”
“Don’t worry,” said the lady with a laugh.  “I’m not stalking you.  We were due a large party here this weekend, booking out the whole place, but they cancelled at the last minute.   We only had 3 bookings since then, 1 couple I know, 1 couple have already checked in, which left the Winchester booking.”
Mouth dropping open in amazement, Castiel shook his head mutely, and Dean scraped the chair back intentionally making several people look round as he sat down.
The silence between them felt comfortable, like a warm blanket.  It wasn’t awkward, neither had the need to fill it with chatter or inane conversation.   They walked until they reached the paddock fence and stood listening to the wind through the trees and chirping of nocturnal insects. Standing shoulder to shoulder, needing that sensation to keep them grounded.
Zar inclined his head.   “I am half French, half English.  The French accent was an accident one day during filming, and it kind of stuck.”
“Thanks kid,” said Gabriel, “I’ll put these in the fridge for later.”
Castiel removed his fingers, and Dean cried out at the empty feeling.  Castiel quickly added some more lube, but this time used it on his own cock.   After giving it a few swipes with his hand to ensure it was properly covered, he moved forward closer to Dean, resting Dean thighs over his own.  Very carefully he lined up with Dean’s now open and exposed hole, and gently pushed just the head of his cock in, holding on to Dean’s hips.
Dean allowed himself to fall sideways on to his back, the gravel digging in and cutting into his back through his T-shirt.   He pushed back with his feet, scrabbling, trying to gain a purchase and brought the gun up, Alistair’s eyes went wide, but he was already committed, and gravity worked against him, despite trying to pull back.   Dean stared into Alistair’s eyes, his own face a mask of stone, and pulled the trigger twice in quick succession.  At this range, Dean could not miss.   Alistair jerked as the bullets hit, before his momentum carried him forward, and he fell face first and lay on the ground unmoving.  Instinctively Dean scanned the area for the next attack, but only saw Azzer propping himself against the campervan - no threat.
"Fuck," the man switching from flirtatious to serious in the blink of an eye. He ran to the car and pulled the door open.  "Shit Cassie.  What happened?"
“Is everything alright?” Ma asked concerned.
Now it was Dean’s turn to blush.  “Technical research?  Do I want to know?”
“M’ good,” stammered Castiel.   He was resting a hand on Dean’s upper arm.  Not restricting his movements, but reassuring him.
“Assuming everything proceeds normally, Sam can be present during the birth if you wish,” she confirmed.
Taking a couple of cable ties from his jacket pocket, Dean quickly secured Alistair’s hands behind his back, and dragged him up to the roadway.  Dumping him on the ground when Alistair couldn’t stand.   He looked up the road toward the direction of the cabin and was surprised to see a couple of torch beams making their way towards him.   Dean cautiously raised his hands, keeping the shotgun pointed at the sky.
“I wish I was.”  Castiel sat down on his yoga mat, pulling at his new jeans slightly to give him some space to bend his knees, resting his back against the bed, so he wasn’t looking at Dean.  “Gabe was concerned at first, especially since I was technically underage.   He threw one guy out that propositioned me.”
They finished their meals chatting about their recent exams, and their expectations regarding their results.   Ryan took their empty plates.   “Anything else for you,” he asked.  “Dessert?  Refill on those drinks?”
John walked to the truck, climbed in, and shut the door.
Castiel grinned, and pulled Dean in to lie next to him again.    “What about you?  You didn’t cum.”
“Dean.   Sheriff,” said John nodding respectfully at her.  He gave Dean an appraising glance.  Seeing no obvious injuries, he turned his full attention to Sheriff Mills, “Is my son in trouble?”
Castiel took a moment to lean back in his chair and study the people in the street.  He watched 20 or so people cross in front of the café, but he found himself looking frequently back at a young man, a street musician playing guitar, about 50 yards away.  He was dressed in simple ripped blue jeans, with bright red sneakers, and frayed denim jacket over a plain white T-shirt.    “Him.   The busker.”
“My fault,” protested Castiel with another laugh. “You were the one that insisted we should have sex on your birthday. You knew your heat was due the following week.”
The travel time seemed shorter on the route back, and it wasn’t long before Dean parked up in front of Gabriel’s house.
Castiel went quiet.  Dean could tell he was thinking about what Dean had said.
When Sam released them and took a step back, Cas glanced at Dean, visibly reacting to his relief and also very pleased that Dean had said something. He knew Dean would not have been comfortable sharing this news with his brother, but he was also happy that Dean had acknowledged the change in their relationship. That Dean wasn't going to deny that there was something between them, that this wasn't going to be a secret.
Castiel caught Dean's eye and dropped back into English.  "Well, there is a small group at the High School.   We meet after school on Tuesday's.    I could see about you joining us.  You may even be better than some of the group there."
From Castiel, Monday 12.20pm.         Trust me it’s not as interesting as you might think it is.  If you’ve heard one fake moan, you’ve heard them all.
Alistair looked at Dean in disgust.  In addition to being barefoot, Dean was wearing a low slung pair of jeans, that he hadn’t bothered to zip or button, the belt hanging loose, and unbuckled.  It looked like Dean had hurriedly pulled them on over his naked body.  Dean was also bare chested, but quickly pulled on a T-shirt that he was carrying.  Alistair spotted what looked like bite marks on Dean’s arms and spat on the ground.   “We need to talk.”
Dean pulled Cas against him again.  "You're Cas?"
Decision made, he allowed himself a moment to bask in the thought of it.
Wriggling comfortably into the cocoon of his Alpha’s arms, Dean hummed happily. “Love you, my Alpha,” said Dean, as he gave up trying to fight the wave of tiredness overwhelming him.
Once they had the bike on board, they headed to Gabriel’s home in Lecompton, just west of Lawrence. After about 30 minutes, Gabriel turned to his brother. “Come on Cassie. Spill. Something is bothering you. I can smell it.”
"Avunculus meus me docuit," explained Sam.  (**My uncle taught me.)    "Classis Latine Dictum est mihi, erat hic copulare potuerunt."    (**I was told there was a Latin class here I could join.)
As though a single entity, the group turned to look at the owner of the voice.  Dean Winchester was standing there, a short-barrelled shotgun held loosely in his hand, aimed directly at Alistair.  He’d obviously got dressed in a hurry; thrown a jacket on over his T-shirt and slipped his feet into a pair of boots.
Dean pushed himself to his feet, his gun still trained on Alistair, and approached cautiously, ready for another attack.   Dean saw Alistair’s knife still in his outstretched hand and kicked it away.   He grabbed Alistair’s arm and flipped him over.  Alistair’s eyes stared upwards to the sky, unblinking, unfocused, a large blood stain over his chest.   Although he was already sure, Dean reached down and felt for pulse in Alistair’s neck.  Nothing.
“I wouldn’t,” said Dean, snuggling back against Castiel. “Although I think Sam and Jess are feeling a little overwhelmed now with our brood. Thank goodness Ro and Gabe offered to take the kids to their place this weekend.”
Dean hesitate slightly, "I thought we might look at the stars for bit, but if you would rather keep on walking."
Dean nodded and took off in pursuit of Alistair.   Although it was dark, there was still enough light from the moon to allow Dean to see where he was heading.   Having spent a lot of time both camping and helping on wilderness survival courses, Dean knew that running at speed over wooded terrain in the dark, it would only be a matter of time before either Dean or Alistair would stumble over a tree root or something, and twist an ankle.   Dean paused every 20 seconds or so, to hear the snapping of branches and twigs in front of him as Alistair crashed ungainly through the woodland.   Dean quietly and consistently made his way through the woods in search of his quarry.  The fact that he still had his shotgun made him even more cautious.  He didn’t want fall and accidentally shoot himself.
Jimmy waved off the apology.   “I can imagine seeing your boyfriend, or at least who you thought was your boyfriend, in a skin mag a little confusing.”
A little over a year after Claire’s birth, and on their second anniversary of their mating, Dean persuaded Castiel that a third baby would complete their family. Unable to deny his Omega, Castiel agreed, and their third pregnancy resulted in the surprise of non-identical twin boys, Ben and James. Dean didn’t quite make it to full term with the twins, with them arriving at 37 weeks, but they were a healthy birth weight of 6lb and 6.5lb respectively, and didn’t spend any time in NICU or the special care baby unit. Ben was the spitting image of Dean, and James of Castiel, to the point that when Sam and Gabriel had dug out old photos of Dean and Castiel as babies, Charlie, Gilda and Meg had been unable to tell them apart.
“Dad came home early,” stammered Sam.   “I had to tell him.”
“Oh Dean,” said Castiel sadly pulling Dean’s arm around him further.
Cas calmed after a moment, and gently released Dean's lips. "Thank you. That was…." He tried to think of a word that summed up the experience and failed.
Dean was nervous about his father’s reaction.    They hadn’t spoken after Dean had returned home last night, and the morning had been busy arranging to visit Sheriff Mills.
Lee and Benny had only received a few enquiring looks from their teammates, at their newfound friendship with Castiel, but no significant negative or derogatory comments.
Ignoring the frankly indecent look the man had given him, Dean indicated his car with his thumb. "It's Cas. He's hurt bad."
“Yeah. Punch it Chewie,” said Dean trying to be funny.
"No."
“Are you going down to Matty’s then,” said Dean changing the subject.
“You’ll be OK Sammy. Remember what Dad said,” Dean reassured.
“Knowing you cared enough to do it,” said Dean, “makes me love you more.”
“You don’t have to go,” said Castiel, looking directly at Dean.  “I mean, I want to say thank you for getting Gabriel.  I am not sure whether anyone else would have called him.”
Sam quickly gave a repeat performance of the story from the car journey home, along with several additional details of his classmates.  Apparently, Sam’s maths teacher had already spotted his potential and was already setting him up with extra work.  His year tutor had discovered his interest and knowledge of Latin and had agreed to introduce him to a teacher at the high school to see if there was the possibility of him joining their afterschool Latin club.
“I could see why some women and some men would find you attractive,” said Dean finally.
“There was no shooting.   Castiel wasn’t there.  Yes, Alistair and Gordon were arrested,” said Dean quickly.
Neither Castiel or Dean wanted a fuss about their marriage. As Dean had been married previously, they’d had a pup out of wedlock or mating, and he and Castiel were already mated, it seemed an unnecessary formality. They both believed their mating was more important to them than a marriage certificate. Keeping it low key, Rowena helped Dean organise everything. It was a quiet simple civil ceremony at a local hotel, where they both wore royal blue suits, and had a formal sit down dinner.
Castiel tutted at Gabriel and went into the kitchen to make coffee.   “The hotel was lovely, just like you said.”
Dean paused. “I only have a first name. ‘Castiel’.”
Many thanks to everyone that left comments or kudos.  I am so pleased to hear that many of you are enjoying this story.
Dean’s jaw dropped open.  “You’re kidding?”
Benny shook his head, “I’ve barely spoken to him all week.  He’s too wrapped up making sure Cas doesn’t hurt himself.”  They laughed.  “Why?  What’s he up to?”
Dean looked on in stunned amazement.  “And you …”
Cas nodded, "Yes, I am aware that this is something 'new' for Dean."
After a few minutes, Dean realised that now his Omega was sated, his rational brain could think straight again. He’d given himself to an Alpha. He was so screwed. And not just in the physical way. Castiel had said ‘my Omega’, but Dean had asked him to pretend to be his Alpha. Castiel had also been kind of overwhelmed at the time, Dean was sure Castiel didn’t mean it, not like Dean wanted him to mean it.  But Dean
Castiel looked up at that comment and flicked his eyes to Dean in surprise.
Dean had texted Castiel a couple times on the Sunday and Monday after they had visited, just to check in and see how he was.   The responses were meticulously typed back, complete with the punctuation and grammar.   Dean didn’t expect anything less.
“Oh yes,” said Gabriel with a grin.  “Fergus Crowley is exceptional at backroom deals.   I wouldn’t be surprised if he’d done a deal with the devil himself one moonlit night.”
Dean hung his head, letting the water hide the tears that threatened to spill from his eyes.   He wasn’t crying about the pain in his back, or about killing Alistair, and despite what the Sheriff might have thought, he genuinely hadn’t intended to kill him.   Yeah, he’d thought about it, and been angry, but at the instance when he’d been faced with Alistair holding a knife, all he’d been thinking about was a shoulder shot to stop Alistair from hurting Castiel again.    Dean wasn’t crying about the fear he’d felt when he’d seen that picture of Castiel, tied and beaten.  An image that he knew he would never be able to forget.   No, he knew this was the release of the adrenaline, and his body reacting to the stress of the day.   But he was upset and filled with dread at the thought of leaving Castiel on Saturday.   He knew it was for Castiel’s own good.  But his Dad had been right about being heart sore.  Dean hated himself. His Dad had warned him, hell he’d even warned himself when he first met Castiel.   But somehow the kind, thoughtful, gentle person that Castiel was, had won Dean over, without even trying.
“Me too,” said Sam.
“Not sure if I should be worried you know that, or worried that you carry one.” Gabriel rubbed Castiel’s shoulder.
Walking into the main area, Castiel could see Sam sitting next to Jack’s incubator, his nose buried in what looked like a very dense law book.
“Gonna be honest, sugar,” said Missouri, her accent betraying her southern roots. “I was kinda hoping to see a little more weight on your pup this visit.” She patted Dean’s leg reassuringly. “You’re at 34 weeks currently, which is good, but your pup is more like the size of a 28 week pup.”
Because Dean wasn’t allowed to visit Jack, Dean begged Sam to sit with Jack instead. Sam sent Dean regular texts and photos. Dean spent a lot of time staring at the photo of Jack lying in an incubator.
Castiel cut a piece of his steak and speared it on his fork, holding it out to Dean.  “Go on try it.”
The man flexed his leg, testing it, “Not badly.”
“Dean you there?” said Gabriel.   “His school bag is here, but he’s not in the house.”
As an Angel Cas knew his own stamina was far greater than that of Dean, but the same response so soon after what Dean had just done to him was new. Cas's could sense Dean's increasing urgency and increased the speed and pressure. His mouth moved to Dean's ear, as he thrust harder, pushing down on Dean. He lowered his voice, and with said commandingly with no opportunity for discussion "Cum for me Dean."
“I love you too,” replied Dean as he continued to hold Castiel, rubbing his back and gently kissing his hair.   They stayed that way for a little while, until Dean said, “Are we good, Angel?”
Dean stared at him, before Cas smiled. "Fucking Sammy", said Dean annoyed. He saw Cas reaching out to heal him, but Dean leaned back out of reach, "No Cas, leave it. I want to feel it. To know it really happened."
“I don’t think so.  Uriel won’t be able to treat Cassie.  It’s considered unethical.  But he’d certainly report back to the family.”
“I know.   Night Dean.”
Suddenly as if noticing it was raining for the first time, the man said. “You’re getting cold. You should get back in your car.”
There was a deep rumble from Castiel that Dean realised was Castiel laughing, “Anything?” Castiel clarified.
Dean had laughed loudly at the idea Castiel would be laying low in his room to avoid meeting any of the actors or crew.  What a strange life Castiel had.
When Castiel had agreed as a favour to Dean, to ‘baby sit’ Sam overnight on Saturday, he had been reassured that it would be an easy evening, of watching TV, and ordering in pizza.  Dean had said he was going night fishing with Lee, but with his Dad away at the moment, he didn’t feel he could leave Sam on his own, and had begged Castiel to come over to their place to spend the evening with Sam.  “I mean it’s not like he needs bathing, and diaper changing,” Dean had said with grin.
Castiel flicked his eyes back up suddenly, and Dean blushed.  “I mean...” he stammered, “you… it … it looks better messy.”  Dean backed away and opened the driver’s door, fumbling slightly.  In the car he took a couple of deep breaths trying to calm himself, before Castiel opened the passenger side and climbed in, put on his seatbelt and looked expectantly at Dean.
Dean tried to smile reassuringly.   “I’ve never met a Castiel before,” he said enunciating the name carefully.  “Do people shorten it to Cas?”
“He sounds intriguing,” said Dean.
“Oh. Good.”
Dean heard Gabriel shouting in the background.   “Gay porn!!”
Castiel gasped and rapidly removed the elasticated bracelet.  “Oh my god.  I am never leaving the house again.”
Dean was still too zoned out, to notice Castiel placing Dean’s clothes on and near the radiator to dry, or to hear the rustle of clothing as Castiel removed his leather bike trousers, and sopping wet T-shirt, leaving only his boxer shorts. He didn’t even feel the mattress dip as Castiel climbed silently into bed behind him. He was vaguely aware of the feel of the sheet between himself and the other presence. A modicum of modesty between two strangers. Dean felt the last tendrils of consciousness leave him as Castiel drew him closer, placing the gentle weight of an arm curling around him, reassuring him. He knew he must be imagining it, but could swear he smelt warm, spicy honey and cinnamon. It reminded him of the tea his mother used to make for him when he was ill as a child. Too exhausted to fight or complain, he allowed his mind to accept the calm, soothing scent, and let it lull him to sleep.
Knowing how Dean’s body responded to his touch, Castiel continued his gentle movements, gradually building Dean’s desire and need for release to a crescendo. Several bouts of passionate and vigorous love making had already occurred yesterday and last night; Castiel’s Alpha giving his Omega what he needed. Now Castiel knew that Dean needed a different touch, less fast and furious, more worshipping and loving. A long, slow, drawn out crawl to the finish line, rather than a sprint, drawing out Dean’s pleasure.
Dean laughed, and it made Cas smile. "I love that story of you finding a liquor store and drinking it."
John looked at Castiel.   “You’re Cas?  Dean mentioned you.  You’re helping Sam with his homework.”
Zar had made a beeline for Dean as soon as the brothers walked in.  “Ah, our Cassie’s hero.  I’ve been so looking forward to meeting you,” he said with a strong upper-class English accent.
“As I said in the car,” said Castiel cautiously. “Courting, marriage if you wish, mating. I don’t know your current housing arrangements, but if you preferred to live there, I would be willing to move to be with you. My house has room for Jack and yourself if you would consider that. Sam said it was your decision, but I would understand if you needed to seek his counsel.”
Alexis appeared and disconnected the various leads from Dean, and made sure that Dean was suitably covered for the short trip down the hall to a warm but brightly lit room that reminded Dean of the surgical theatre rooms he’d seen on various TV medical drama. As Dean was wheeled in, he glanced around the room, taking in the sight of the little incubator in the corner, a woman in bright yellow scrubs that had little penguins all over them stood next to the incubator. There were shiny posable lamps and several people were already fussing around the room checking equipment. As soon as Dean’s bed was locked in place, several of the nurses around the room started moving, connecting Dean back up to the monitors.
"Dude I went to college and had gay friends," said Sam shrugging. "It's no big deal. I wanted to understand the mechanics, so I knew what they were referring to."
“I thought we agreed we could be friends.”
From Dean, Sunday 10.04am.             How r u doing?
“Big enough for 12,” joked Zar, and winked as Dean passed him a bowl of bread cubes.  “Ou douze comme on dit en français,” said Zar in impeccable French.
“Yours is a last resort for self-defence only,” said Dean.  “Leave Alistair to me.”   He eased up on the gas, looking for an area with reasonable tree cover, and limited visibility on the road.  “OK.  We’re about 200 yards from the trail head.  Best cover is on the left.   You ready?”
Dean took the time point to out specific areas on the human body that were the most vulnerable, such as the groin, nose, throat, knees, shins and even ears.
The bell signalling the end of the class rang.   Over the noise of 25 teenagers scraping chairs and gathering their bags, Dean stood up and turned to look at Novak.    “Er, hey.   Thanks for the loan of the book.”  Suddenly realising that Novak probably wasn’t this boy’s first name, and he probably was being a little rude, Dean quickly stuck out his hand in an offer of a handshake. “I’m Dean.”
Missouri tapped out a few notes on her computer, updating Dean’s records, and making a note for her report to the court. She quickly prepared the injection as Dean took off his long sleeved shirt, and hiked up the sleeve of his T-shirt to give Missouri space. Sam pulled a face at him. It was evident that he didn’t like needles.
“Maybe.  But it’s just for a few more months.   Just until I graduate.”
“I’m at the hospital. Jack decided to arrive early.”
Castiel cocked on his head on one side, “You’re OK?  Not freaked out?”
If Dean hadn't been so worried about Castiel lying on the ground, he would have laughed out loud at the high pitched scream the one closest to him gave, as both of them turned and sprinted down away, practically diving into the bushes that edged the service yard.   Dean knew his priority had to be Castiel rather than chasing the bastards down.   Dropping to his knees next to Castiel's prone form, he quickly felt for a pulse at Castiel's neck, sagging in relief as he felt the fast but unsteady beat.   "Sammy!" Dean yelled to attract his brother, whilst trying to assess exactly how badly Castiel was hurt.
Gently sucking on Dean’s ear lobe, Castiel whispered, “May I blow you?”
"Ha ha," said Dean dryly and began to rummage in the cupboards. "Do we have granola?"
Thank you all for reading.
From Dean, Monday 9.02am.              Is Cas OK
Picking up his book and his jacket, Sam offered his hand to Castiel, who took it with both hands, and shook it firmly.  "But if you ever hurt Dean, or even think about hurting Dean again, I'll do a lot more than punch you.  Do you understand?"
“I’m glad you approve,” said Castiel moving next to him, and resting his head on Dean’s shoulder.
Regrettably, with Dean being grounded and having to drive Sammy home, this limited their options for meeting outside of school.   John’s presence at home was also hampering Dean’s ability to even phone Castiel, and instead once in bed they spent their evenings sending text after text message.
Interrupting him Dean said, “The message said to come alone.  They may be watching.   I’m gonna drop Benny off away from the RV point and hope he can sneak up.  That message was sent specifically to me.  Not you.  I think they probably want me in exchange for Cas,” said Dean.    “I need you to try and get hold of Sheriff Mills from Levenworth County.  Tell her what’s happened.  She won’t get to me in time, but she needs to know.”   Dean swallowed and looked at Gabriel with a pained expression, “Sam is on his way here.  I need you look after him…. just in case.  He’ll call Dad if things go wrong.”
“And let me guess, those meat heads bully you for it?”
After Gabriel left the room, Sam and Dean sat on the sofa opposite Castiel, so he wouldn’t have to turn his head to look at them.
“Dean and Sam are interesting boys,” said Gabriel casually.
Cas laid a hand on Dean's arm, calming him. "He's your brother, he's family and he cares about you deeply."
“Go,” said Benny.  “I got these assholes.”
“What then,” asked Lee curiously.
Dean stopped the car, and quickly hopped out to walk Castiel to the front door.  “I don’t want to go,” Dean said quietly.   Dropping his voice so the he wouldn’t disturb the neighbours.
"Jerk."
Relieved, Dean grabbed the bags from the trunk.   He insisted on carrying Castiel’s bag but allowed Castiel to open the door to the hotel for him.
“You can say ‘porn’ or ‘sex’, Cas,” said Dean, sitting down on the edge of the bed.  “But I bet Gabe probably still sees you as his little brother, and thinks his job or lifestyle is something to shelter you from.”
“Thank you,” said Castiel relieved.   He indicated the bathroom, “I’ll just use the facilities, and then we can go down for dinner.”
A waitress appeared with a couple of menus, but they both knew what they wanted and ordered without looking at the options.
“I call everyone ‘Cher’,” Benny drawled.  “Saves me learning their names.”
A new shout out this time to Breezeranger on Discord for kindly taking over beta duties.  This is better thanks to her and Sailor_fujoshi.
Omega was out there. He didn’t have a lot to go on, just a name, and a vague description of a black car. But it was clear from the context of the note that was something Dean didn’t want. He didn’t want Castiel to look for him. Sighing, he carefully separated the page from the notepad, and folded it delicately.  He reached for his wallet in his back pocket, and placed it inside. He may not be able to do much now, but that was the only thing he had to tell him that last night wasn’t a dream. The only proof he had that he’d met an amazing Omega, they’d shared a single night together, and now it was over.
“Do you want the usual, Castiel?” said the friendly barista behind the counter.
“Cas, I have a job that pays barely above minimum wage. I rent a small apartment, in a not so great part of town. I’ve seen your house, trust me, that is far nicer than anywhere I’ve ever stayed my whole life. Sam will not object, and if he does, I’ll do it anyway. I ran away with Benny, and without hesitation I’d run again,
“Not a joke around here,” said John unhappily.   “The name came up when I speaking to Matty about a job down in Texas.  I mentioned we were staying in Lawrence and happened to mention the name.  Saying they made it tough for outsiders to get jobs.  I wasn’t too worried given we aren’t staying here long, but if he’s heard of them way down there, they gotta have some clout.”
Mustering a cheerful smile of his own, Dean met him halfway, and hugged him back, staring at Gabriel over Castiel’s shoulder.  “You said by six.”
“It was Castiel’s cousin, Zar, that gave me the idea. I just kinda ran with it,” said Dean.  “So, what do you think?   Do you think we could pull it off?”
“Don’t sweat it,” said Dean firmly.   “I can take care of myself.”
Gabriel sighed, "stubborn little ...." he paused.  "Stay with him, I'll get the first aid kit.   Sam, can I borrow you?"  he indicated the stairs, "Cas's room, second door on the left.  Grab him some PJ's from his dresser, and clean towels from his ensuite."  Sam bounded up the stairs two at a time.
“No Cas,” said Dean quietly.  “Trust me.  We have this.”
Castiel turned in surprised, dropping his arms.   “Hello Dean” he greeted in his characteristic deep rumble.  “I didn’t realise you were here.”
“Excluding me,” said Dean with a laugh.
Deciding that Missouri probably had a point about his hospital bag, Dean finished packing it up that evening. He compared the contents to the recommended list in his antenatal guide, scoffing at the suggestion of lip salve, and warm socks, but packed them anyway. Charlie had gifted him another StarWars onesie in a premie size, knowing the others would be too big. He’d laughed out loud at the caption ‘Welcome to the Dark Side’ printed on the nappy flap. He carefully added that one to his hospital bag.
“Holy…” Dean stopped speaking before he could say something stupid.  Dean was very glad he was facing Castiel, and not watching from behind.   Castiel was really flexible, and that pose had definitely raised some interesting and mostly inappropriate thoughts.  Dean was sure he would be blushing if all his blood hadn’t just rushed southwards.
He was about to say something to check on Dean, when the steam cleared for a moment, and he saw Dean standing in the burning hot water, his left hand supporting himself, pushing him back from the wall, whilst his right hand was gripping his cock, and fisting it roughly, pleasuring himself. His face bore a look of utter defeat as he looked down at his actions.
“What do you think Cas?” asked Dean with a smile.
“I know I don’t much, but I am fairly sure that sex is supposed to be ‘mutually’ satisfactory,” said Castiel using his fingers to make air quotes.
“He’s my Family Alpha, my brother,” said Dean clenching his jaw as another contraction hit. “Yeah, he can stay.”
Smiling widely, Castiel reached out and gently massaged Dean’s calf muscle.
Castiel raised a single eyebrow as though to question the order, reminding Dean uncomfortably of their shopping trip, and the misunderstanding that had occurred with the shop keeper.   Dean rolled his eyes, as he realised what Castiel was thinking, and mentally apologised to him.
Sam shook his head. "Dean, you have never been good at feelings, but I have seen the way you guys look at each other. You have serious eye sex going on. I have no doubt of his feelings towards you. You will work it out."
Castiel had suddenly change tack.  Instead of kisses, Dean felt a warm wet tongue lick at his balls before it took a slow tortuous route from the base of his cock to the tip.  It took every ounce of self-control not to buck under Castiel’s touch.    Castiel continued licking and mouthing Dean’s cock, as he gently touched Dean’s balls, dragging his fingernails across the sensitive skin.
For his part, Castiel seemed completely unaware of the effect he’d had on Dean.   He looked at Dean puzzled, his head tilted on one side in his customary, confused way.    Taking a step forward toward Dean, Castiel looked at him expectantly.   “Shall I help you get undressed?”
“That’s really fucked up,” said Dean uncomfortably.  “Doesn’t he have any friends?”
Taking one look at Dean’s agitated appearance, Gabriel didn’t even crack joke. “Cassie?”
Dean snorted, slipped the car into drive and pulled away from the kerb.   “He’s hidden for too long.  He shouldn’t have to hide.”
To all intents and purposes, Benny and Lee were just shooting the breeze, and getting some fresh air.   They deliberately pitched their conversation at a fraction below their normal level, but still audible to anyone eavesdropping.  They heard scuffling, but didn’t actually see anyone, although the smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming.
He passed the room that Cas had started to use. Since Cas had become human he had unhappily admitted to the necessity of sleep, and had welcomed the use of the room at the bunker. Dean paused for a moment and back tracked. Cas’s bedroom door was open, but there was no sound from inside the room. Carefully Dean pushed the door further ajar, hoping it didn’t squeak, to peer inside. The room was empty. Glancing around concerned Dean could see the bed had been slept in, but Cas was definitely not present.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nonsense,” said Gabriel.  “You aren’t imposing at all.  You guys stay here and distract Cassie for a bit.”
“All done,” said Missouri. “I just need to tape this up.”
Taking care not to shine the light directly into the eyes of whomever was lying on the ground, Dean crouched down nearby, but out of reach. The motorcyclist was wearing a full-face motorcycle helmet, but had lifted the visor slightly. Now Dean was closer, he could just about hear them speaking over the howling noise of the storm.
Dean turned to look at Cas. "About us?" he questioned. "Absolutely not," Dean said firmly. Dean opened his mouth to speak again, but hesitated slightly, just for a fraction of a second, and saw a moment of doubt flicker over Cas's face. "I just wish I had felt able to return the compliment last night," he said quickly reassuring Cas with the squeeze of his hand. "I just ….."
Dean shrugged.   “Honestly, not always.”  He reached down and took Castiel’s hand.   “But I’ll do my best to make sure it is for you.  I have so many things I’d like to show you.”
Relaxing when he realised that Dean wasn’t upset, Castiel kissed him back. “You’re OK with this?”
Gordon and Alistair walked over to where the rest of their gang stood.  The ones Dean hadn’t seen.  In total there were five boys, two of which carried petrol cans.   “You know what you gotta do,” said Alistair.   They nodded in silent agreement.
Fortunately, their Father agreed that both boys should spend the last three months of this academic year staying in one place.   Dean in the last year of High School, and Sam in the last year of Junior High, it was a good time for them both to have a small amount of stability.    John Winchester would never win any father of the year awards, but he loved his boys, even if sometimes he had a hard time showing it.   The death of their mother when Sam was only six months old, in a house fire, had hit the whole family hard.   After the initial shock wore off, John had spent a few months with his friend Bobby, before taking up random jobs that took them all over the country.   Dean had first learned to read from the road signs, then from maps, and learned his maths skills from calculating map distances, times of journeys, gas consumption and budgeting their limited cash.
“You know I don’t want to leave you,” said Castiel, his voice cracking. “But it’s college.   It’s the chance for a new start for me.  I can do that right?”
“That!” said Castiel excitedly.   “Can you teach me that?”
“Exactly how do you survive doing your job, if the sight of what was a fairly chaste kiss has you uncomfortable,” teased Dean.
“I can’t understand a word you’re saying, but you’re driving me crazy,” said Dean. “You’re amazing.”
At the check in window, Castiel saw an older lady approach him with a welcoming smile.   “Hey there,” she said in friendly manner.   “I’m Mildred, I’m going to guess that you are the Winchester booking.”
Dean blushed and demonstrated several of the swear words he knew in ASL to Gabriel.
“I don’t watch a lot of Television,” said Castiel.  “I tend to read.”
The look of adoration on Castiel’s face nearly broke Dean.  “Are you sure?” Castiel asked.
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
Castiel covered his mouth in horror and surprise.   “No way.”
Gabriel smacked Dean on the arm and started laughing.  “Oh I knew I liked you.  Yes, I directed all 13 films so far.  I’ve even won awards for a couple of them.”
The Birth Centre was clearly signposted and Sam had no problem navigating his little Prius to a nearby space.
“Yes, but it doesn’t mean it was unwelcome.”
“I’d never considered it before,” said Lee with a cocky grin looking Dean up and down.  “But, you are very pretty, I might be persuaded,” he teased.
Gabriel was like an over excited puppy when they returned.  “Wow!” was his initial reaction when he saw Castiel in his new jacket and clothes.    “Looking good Cassie.”   He insisted on seeing all the purchases, and ooh’ed and ahh’ed over the new clothes as he dug through the bags pulling out the various items.   “Good taste Dean-o,” he complimented, admiring the red Converse boots.
Castiel paused immediately at the feeling of Dean’s hands on him.  “Talk to me Dean.”
Sam pulled out a kitchen chair, and Dean straddled it, facing the back of it, allowing Sam better access to his abused back.   Pulling off the clean T-shirt, Dean allowed Sam to gently smear the cream along the worst of the grazes.   It would help prevent infection, and hopefully promote healing.
Sitting back in his chair, Dean watched as Sam and Castiel consulted on the sheet.  He couldn't explain why, but he felt a kind of warmth spread through him.    He hadn't been sure Castiel would speak to him again, after the incident with Alistair on Friday.   This felt like a positive thing.
Dean was still reeling from the experience.  Looking back, the whole evening felt like he’d been edged several times already, so he wasn’t completely surprised that he’d cum so quickly.   Feeling a little ashamed and embarrassed, he turned to Castiel and burrowed his head in Castiel’s shoulder.  “Um, so, well I guess that happened.”
Dean suddenly realised that everything that had just occurred had been centered on him, and Cas was sporting a hard on that he could feel pressing against him. "um look, I think you've taken care of me enough."
Dean stroked a thumb across Castiel’s jaw and touched his lip.  Castiel closed his eyes for a moment before kissing it and then drawing it into his mouth sucking it gently, he opened his eyes again and looked directly into Dean’s green ones.  Dean withdrew his thumb, and ran his hand down Castiel’s arm, causing goose bumps to appear, before bringing to rest on Castiel’s hip. He rubbed Castiel’s hip with his thumb in small circular motions for a moment, before moving his hand to the waistband of Castiel’s boxers, holding the material between his fingers.   He paused, and waited for Castiel acknowledgement.  The silent request was met a small nod of permission from Castiel.
The song came to an end, and the next song was Phil Collin’s, Against All Odds.
“Dean …” panted Castiel.   “Please..”
Silently Sam nodded.
“How far apart are your contractions?” asked Alexis.
Dean removed his hand from Castiel’s back and flipped Lee off.    Reluctantly he let go of Castiel, but not before whispering in his ear with emphasis, “we’ll ‘talk’ later.”
Henriksen looked to the rest of the class.   “But the story is told from the viewpoint of the second Mrs De Winter.  Can anyone here tell me the name of the new wife in the story?”
“Yes Dean.”   Castiel gasped slightly as Dean began to move his hand, holding Castiel’s cock and foreskin and drawing it back and forth.  He could feel Castiel tightening his stomach muscles and lean back against him.  Dean continued at a slow steady pace, allowing Castiel to feel the warmth grow in his belly.   It didn’t take long for Castiel’s breathing to speed up.
Castiel looked over at Dean, who gave a small wave.  “That looked quick to me,” said Dean as Castiel jogged over.
Dean’s hackles rose automatically, and John gently placed a hand on Dean’s arm.  “See, just the thought of that makes you angry.   I am not saying no, but you should maybe think about it a little bit more.  OK?”
“Great.  That’s another one then,” said Dean.   He passed Castiel yet another pile of clothes.  “Let’s see if we’re three for three.”

Dean turned off the water, and sighed.   Leaving Castiel even temporarily was a future Dean problem.
It seemed like no matter what position Dean tried in bed, he couldn’t get comfortable. Sighing he gathered all the pillows and cushions to create a supportive structure for his aching back. He had just settled when his bladder decided to tell him he needed to pee for the 50th time that day. Returning to bed, he sat on the edge of the bed ready to swing his legs up under the covers when he actually heard a soft pop and his lower half was soaked through. It took all of ten seconds for Dean to process that his waters had broken.
“One or two teachers try.  But my parents are big contributors to almost every politician in the area.  My great great grandparents pretty much founded this town, and the family still owns a lot of it.  They fund large bursaries at the school, and fund lots of events.   Almost every business in this town is either sponsored, funded or supported by my parents.  I’m pretty much the town pariah for taking them to court and winning.  I am fairly sure the only reason I managed that was because they had to get an out of state judge in for the case, because the local one had a heart attack.”   Castiel gave a small depreciating smile.  “I’m considered unnatural and unstable.   At one point they tried to have me committed.   My family spread enough wild rumours about me around the town, that no one is sure what is true and what isn’t.  Some people don’t believe them, but enough people do.”  Castiel sighed, “I am also going to tell you this now, so it won’t be a surprise when hear it from someone else.  Someone lied and told the school receptionist I am HIV+ and it quickly became common knowledge around the school, which means no one at school wants anything to do with me.  I swear I’m clean.   Even though I am not sleeping with anyone, my lawyer insists I get tested every three months, just to have a recent document to prove it if I get challenged on it.”
“Yes, please do that,” said Castiel.
“No, Ma’am, I’ve got it,” Dean said lifting them easily.
Gabriel tried to pull himself together.  “You’re very bossy.   I can see who the guy thought was the Dom in this relationship,” joked Gabriel.  Castiel and Dean glared at him.  “Well in certain clubs that require above statutory minimum age limits and cater to rather a ‘niche’ clientele, bracelets are used to identify different sexual preferences, or practices.   I’m aware that a bracelet like Cassie’s can be used to identify a preference for favouring 69 as a sexual position.”
Shifting his body slightly, Castiel leaned closer to Dean and pressed a kiss to his chest.  “I would like to suck you,” he whispered.
Jack's birth was based on my own experience with the birth of my son - and a bit of artistic license.   My husband almost passed out, because I was using gas and air and kept breathing it over him - A nurse had to open a window and put his head out.
“It’s OK.  Talbot won’t name any names, but the counsellor said the person said they had just seen it, and that was at 10am.”
“Sweet,” said Lee.  “I’ll pick you up at 7.”
“You did Casa Erotica!” exclaimed Dean, then flushed as he realised he had pretty much admitted to watching porn.
Dean pulled him in for another kiss and then lay staring at the ceiling with Cas comfortably snuggled against him, resting in the crook of his arm. Dean had never felt so happy or relaxed. Or even sober.
Dean had figured the next step would be to try to disarm him, and he was prepared for that possibility.   Dean flexed his arm, and the thin blade dropped into his palm.
