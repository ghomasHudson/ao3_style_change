Dean pulled away abruptly from Cas. "Hang on. You've heard us?"
Dean was silent for a moment. "Whatever. Time to sleep." Dean turned off his bedside lamp and snuggled closer to Castiel.
"No. No, no, no. Not with me, and I'm—I'm the only one that has any pull here. Not Heaven, not Hell, not G-O-D himself. So think harder." The entity poked Castiel's forehead. "Rack that perky little brain of yours."
"I know we will." Dean leaned forward and kissed Cas tenderly, yet pulled away after a few short seconds. "But first, we have to find that son of a bitch, Kane."
"Other than the fact that Sarah Robinson was a depressed saint, no. You?"
"Dean, I don't think that's such a good idea."
But if I ever get it right, you'll miss me sorely
"That's better. Now, I must warn you, this herb has a particular... side effect."
"Hello, Dean." Cas didn't seem like he noticed anything wrong, except for the complete and utter panic on Dean's face. "Are you okay?"
"Nothing. I was just about to get started on research."
"Well, I'm here now." Castiel pulled away and gave his boyfriend a small smile, which turned sad. "But we need to talk."
Castiel walked around, but all he saw was darkness. He shouted, but no one seemed to hear him. As far as Cas could tell, he was alone. "Hello? Hello!"
"No. She would barely even talk to me. Even when she did, she didn't seem like... she was all there. Like she was thinking about something else."
Castiel didn't know what to do with this information, so he decided to forget about it.
"No, everyone loved her. I'm sorry, but I thought Sarah had a heart attack."
"Can-can we just focus on getting you back? Please." Dean was close to shattering again.
"What the hell was that thing?" Dean asked once he and Sam were back in the Impala. They'd been chased by something small and fluffy, yet it sounded like a deer.
Thousands of tiny balls of pure light, so close it was like you could just reach out and grab one. Dean was completely awestruck.
Dean was starting to get frustrated and impatient, which led to him drinking a lot of alcohol. Sam and Jack had gone to sleep hours ago, so it was just Dean and Castiel up watching Scooby-Doo.
Cas relaxed, thinking that Sam didn't see his display. "Yes. It's a rasselbock, or jackalope as you probably know it. They're half-rabbit, half-deer, and they can mimic human voices."
"That's an understatement." Dean chuckled, still holding Cas' arm tenderly. "Actually, Mom, could you give us a moment? I'll fill you in later."
Cas poked Dean's ribs. "Dean, Jack said he found a case."
Dean stood in front of the growing flame, watching the heat consume his own flesh and blood, hoping Sam was moving on to a better place. A place where no monsters could bother him. A place where he could be at peace.
Dean's smile faltered. "Research? I thought you were doing inventory."
"Castiel?"
"Well, I was hiding out in England when a friend of mine said he'd heard of the world's greatest hunters in America. I contacted some of my mum's friends over here and they said they knew where you were. I figured it was worth a shot."
Cas smiled back. "I have no idea."
"Thank you, Dean." Cas looked surprised at the statement, but he had never really been well-versed in human communications or expressions (even unconscious ones) of love, so he didn't see how much Dean was trying to say with that one comment.
"Oh, save it. I have tiptoed through all your little tulips. Your memories, your little feelings, yes. I know what you hate." The entity lowered its voice. "I know who you love... what you fear. There is nothing for you back there. No. Here. Let me show you." The entity touched Cas's head again, and the same pain began.
"What, you thought I'd leave without a goodbye kiss?" Dean smiled at Cas and planted a soft kiss on his boyfriend's lips. "That's crazy talk right there." After a few minutes, Dean thought Sam might be getting suspicious, so he said goodbye to Cas and left for Illinois.
"You are the strongest man I have ever known, Dean. And I'll be here with you, every step of the way. I know you can do this." Castiel started to walk Dean back down the path. "Come on. We need to do this as soon as possible."
"Dean." Cas looked Dean in his perfect, soft green eyes. "When I was in the Empty, the entity went through my brain. He told me he knew who I loved, and what I feared. Dean, the only thing I fear is losing you."
"Kid, you've been saying that for an hour. A little help, Cas?"
Jim smirked. "You sure about that?" He gestured to the parking lot outside, where Dean and Castiel were sharing a tender kiss.
"Yeah, yeah, I know." He subtly pat the angel's leg, just for a second, but Jim noticed it, smiling smugly at Dale.
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but I will be watching over you
"The price was my life. When I experienced a moment of true happiness, The Empty would be summoned, and it would take me forever."
"Dean," Cas whispered in his boyfriend's ear.
"You know we'll bring him back, right?"
Sam was in his room, watching some nature documentary or something. Dean couldn't really focus on anything. "Hey, Dean." Sam shut his TV off and turned to face his brother. "What's up?"
Kaleidoscope eyes sparkle at the world
But what surprised him more was the fact that he knew Cas was feeling the same things he was. He was excited and happy, and a little nervous.
"We did." Dean laughed incredulously before he remembered why the Shadow had been there in the first place. Cas...
"Oh, I think I know where this is going. Jack, Dean and I have been through a lot together, so we're very close, and many people who have read Chuck's books have misconstrued that as romantic attraction. But even if that was true on my part, Dean is attracted to women."
The two turned back to look at her. "What is it?" Cas asked.
"How about we walk around, get breakfast?" Jack suggested.
Dean and Cas had decided to keep their relationship a secret from Sam and Jack, at least for a while. They didn't want to deal with telling everybody, and they needed some time to figure out who they were as a couple.
"We'll lose." Dean paced the room slowly, hopeless. "I just led us into another trap, all because I couldn't hurt Chuck. Because I was angry and because I just needed something to kill, and because that's all I know how to do."
Dean could barely speak, swallowing hard. "Why does this sound like a goodbye?"
"Hey, Cas?" Dean rapped quietly on the closed door, surprised when Cas opened it less than five seconds later, a strained smile plastered on his face.
Sam rolled his eyes, but he was glad to see Dean this happy. Ever since he started dating Cas, it was like he appreciated everything more. He decided that he should let Dean have fun with his boyfriend. After all, it was the day to celebrate love. "Alright Dean, where do you want to go today?"
"Jack!" Dean yelled through the bunker. "It's Movie Night!"
Dean watched the scene play out in front of him. It definitely felt familiar, but it was still a little fuzzy.
Kane laughed quietly.
Cas smiled. "Fair enough."
Cas loved him.
"Whatcha reading there, Jack?"
Before he could figure out how to broach the subject, Cas did it for him. "Dean, I... You can disregard everything I said. I know you... are not... that way. With, uh... with men. I can assure you, I will not let it affect our relationship and I will not bring it up again." He started to walk towards the door, and all of that fear, all of that dread, drained right out of Dean.
"Sammy, we've looked into less. Come on, it's Valentine's week. Let's go celebrate in D.C."
Yes this one may or may not have been *inspired* by that one episode of Friends but I don't care it's fanfic no rules apply
Sam raised his arm and pointed at Castiel. "No. You're - you're dead."
"Cas... what are you doing?" Dean was very aware of the fact that neither he nor Castiel were actually wearing anything.
They locked eyes. Cas knew exactly how hopeless the situation was, but he couldn't bring himself to say it. Saying it would make it real.
Your dream is over or has it just begun? There's a place I like to hide
Dean was staring at Castiel now, hoping against hope that the angel would get the message Dean was trying to send. And it looked like he did because Dean could see Cas' mind was racing. His eyes held so many emotions, some of them Dean had never seen before. They were flickering back and forth, almost like he was looking past the room.
Cas let himself be dragged off and into a church a few blocks away.
Dean gunned the engine down a narrow street. He stopped and shut off the car. He and Sam could see a figure that they couldn't quite make out, so they got out and walked closer. Then, he turned around. It was Cas.
Castiel slowly stood up again, determined this time to get back to Sam and Dean. "You can prance, and you can preen, and you can scream and yell and remind me of my failings but somehow, I'm awake. And I will stay awake, and I will keep you awake until we both go insane." The entity punched him, but it didn't stop Cas. "I will fight you. Fight you and fight you for...ever. For eternity."
"Two free slices of pie with any drink purchase."
"Honestly, I don't think we can trust him at all," Rowena stated while they were perusing the bread aisle. "What kind of whole wheat bread does Sam want?"
"Yes?"
"Well, as much as I could know an utter bitch who kept me banished from the Grand Coven for centuries."
"Wait, really? Wow." Mary paused. "Well, I'm really happy for you, Dean. I see the way you two look at each other. Does anyone else know?"
"Whoa," Jim said simply, as did Dale. "And the kid?"
Dean sat down on a rock. "Sure, Cas. What's wrong?"
Sam was now behind Dean, his gun raised as well as he went to turn the door handle.
"Hey, Dean," Jack said, not even looking up from his screen.
"Jody and Claire, Donna, Garth and Bess, Mary, of course, and Rowena."
"Well, I need to disappear. I figured hunters were probably the best at that, especially with erasing any supernatural tracks."
"Yeah, I remember. Why?"
Castiel found himself on the floor, panting. "What did... what did you do to me?" The pain in his head started to fade, but he still felt weak.
"Alright, kid, what do we got?" Dean joined Jack in the kitchen, the two standing before a truly epic spread of Halloween-themed treats.
"Release me." Cas stepped closer to the entity until they were an inch apart. "Release. Me."
Sam stood up. "That would make sense. She catches her fiance cheating on her, and she's so depressed she kills herself. Then, she comes back and kills her fiance's lover. Good job, Jack."
"Cas, man... Jack and I need you to come back. I need you back. Please, Cas. I can't go on without you."
A few weeks had passed since Sam's funeral, but Dean was still so deeply consumed in grieving that he could barely even keep himself alive. Jack was training with Bobby, and Mary was consumed in hunting. Cas - or, who he thought was his Cas - was the only reason he kept going. But Dean was starting to notice little things, little nuances about Cas that he wouldn't have seen if he wasn't only focused on Castiel.
"Sammy, I... God, I don't even know what to say. Just... I'm sorry. You have no idea how sorry I am, but... I had to. I had to kill you. I can't be selfish anymore. I mean, the reason you even got back into the life was because I didn't want to be alone. And now... look what's happened to us. I just... I hope you can forgive me." Dean stepped away from the pyre and gasped at the sudden hand on his shoulder.
"Well, he hired me to bring you to him. And before you ask, I don't know why. He just said that 'the fate of creation hangs in the balance', whatever the hell that means. But anyway, let's get going. Chuck offered me quite a handsome finder's fee."
"Sam, you owe me fifty bucks," Mary said while she, Sam, and Jack were making dinner.
Of course, the boys do bring Sam back, but that's a story for another time. Right now, let's let Dean rest. After all, he deserves it.
"Yeah. So we went in, and this chick- I mean, she had dark skin, and I mean like pitch-black, with stars moving all across her skin. She tried to scratch me up real good, nicked my arm a few times with these razor-sharp nails, but I kept her distracted while Cas freed the kid."
Memories flashed before Castiel's eyes. Metatron stealing his grace, Lucifer killing him, walking into the lake after the Leviathans took over his body, returning the souls from purgatory, lying on the floor, half-dead, after returning the souls.
Rowena did a double-take when she saw the young man in the dungeon. "You... You're Olivette's son, aren't you?"
Dean tried to imagine what it would be like to go millennia without falling in love and suddenly falling head-over-heels, and for that love to be requited. Of course, Dean had never fallen in love before he met Cas, but Dean had lived a much shorter time than Cas.
"Oh, I remember Gabriel and Balthazar talking about this once," Cas said. "The largest video screen in the world."
"Right there. How you just said that. It's like you're... not connected to what you're saying. Like you're playing a part." Suddenly Castiel was being held up against the wall, Dean holding an angel blade to his throat. "Who the hell are you and what did you do to Cas?"
"So? When do I stop being a freaking donkey?"
Kane chuckled. "You're one to talk. Chuck told me about some of the things you and your 'family' have done. I mean, letting out Lucifer? The leviathan? Giving Dean the Mark of Cain? You four are like the poster boys of bad decisions." Kane laughed again and crouched down in front of Cas. "No wonder Chuck wants to 'reprogram' you."
It was the best feeling Cas had experienced in his millennia of existence. Total serene, unclouded happiness. The kiss lasted much longer this time, and they were both breathing heavily after it ended.
"Cas, I-" Dean stopped short. He was about to say something meaningless, something he knew he'd regret later on. He felt his eyes burning, his vision slowly blurring at the edges, but he pressed on. "Thank you. Thank you. God, thank you." He felt his knees threatening to give out; at the same moment, he heard something behind him.
I'm just a white blood cell, fighting like hell for you."
There's a get out of jail card
After about four hours, Dean's Valentine's Day high started to wear off, and even he started to get tired. "It's probably time to head back. I'm sure there are some cheesy romance movies on tonight."
The three of them were all hallucinating a little bit when they woke up, so they didn't notice anything was wrong for a few minutes, at least not until Dean tried to hug Cas and ended up grabbing thin air. It took Sam a good hour to convince Dean that they needed to leave in case Kane decided to come back for the rest of them. He practically had to tear his distraught brother away from Cas' room.
"Babe, I don't think he's that bad," Dean said as he and Cas were falling asleep. "He just seems... tired."
Dean absently pawed at Cas' hands, who let him hold them with a small smile. "If we dated." Dean mentally cringed at himself, but there was nothing he could do about it. It was like watching a movie of himself.
"Oh, I discovered this thing called 'Wattpad' while you guys were out. Dean, what does 'Destiel' mean?"
But his mission wasn't from Heaven this time. It was from Kane.
"And she's gonna kill you, and then she's gonna kill me."
"Oh, I should, shouldn't I?"
"Why haven't we been doing this for years?" Dean asked Cas as they were falling asleep. Well, Dean was falling asleep. Cas was laying with Dean until he woke up the next morning.
Dean deepened the kiss, snaking his arms around Castiel's waist as he did so. Strangely, he felt something in Cas' pocket. Dean pulled away. "Whatcha got there?" He started to pull the object out of the angel's pocket; feeling that it was a book before seeing the title, and seeing how much Cas was sweating, he said, "Cas, is this porn?"
"What the hell were you guys doing out?" Sam was lacing up his tennis shoes, probably about to go running. Of course, Lance Armstrong would be out running at 5 AM for no reason.
Rowena nodded. "I only met him once when I was still in the Coven, but it's him. I'll be off, then."
"Then get rid of me."
"He's dead," Dean stated. He felt very tired, so he excused himself and went to sleep. A few minutes later, he heard the door open and Cas slide in next to him.
"When your chips are down
"Hey, it's not my fault I already had a costume idea and you didn't. About that, Cas, I got one for you, too."
Strange. It's almost like he was trying to get Dean and Cas alone together.
This man and his brother were different from the thousands of humans that Castiel had watched. They were different from the noteworthy ones that the angels told stories about, the ones that made the history books, the ones that made a mark on the world.
"I don't know."
"For the last time, no," Dean said, mocking Kane's annoyed tone.
Cas didn't know what to do with that last sentence, but he tried (and failed) to hide his confusion.
He was halfway through the football section when he heard the loud creaking of the iron door, immediately jumping up and shoving the book into his trench coat. Dean must've forgotten something in the bunker. "Hello, Dean," he said, trying to sound casual.
You're lying safe in bed
That was not the reaction Dean was expecting. "You're... you're totally okay with this?"
Jack buried his head in Cas's shoulder. "I missed you, Castiel."
"What do I want? I want you to shut up. I want—hmm. Having you awake, it's like a gnat flew right up here and it's trapped and it's buzzing," it growled.
"Cas, what the hell was that for?" Thankfully, Dean only sounded surprised, not angry.
"Rainbow Falls, Tenessee."
Cas breathed in the crisp air and sighed. "It's beautiful, isn't it?" He gestured to the city around them - well, Dean did too. The two had been holding hands since the second they got outside the motel room. It was really very sweet.
"Fine, but only if you and Cas aren't doing gross couple stuff the whole time."
Dean was silent for a moment. "Cas, earlier I was thinking about Lisa. How I got out of the life for a while. And I was pretending I was happy, and we were in love. But I wasn't happy. I mean, Sam was in the Cage, you were the new sheriff up in Heaven, and I was some normal guy with a dark past. Cas, I was miserable without you."
Since the moment he was created, Castiel was completely unaware of anything more than obedience. He never felt emotions, never hesitated, never flinched. That is until he met the green-eyed, bow-legged, flannel-wearing Dean Winchester.
Dean tried to think of why Cas would be overwhelmed. He had just come back to life, but he'd done that before. Could it be because he and Cas had finally expressed their feelings and gotten together?
Sam held up his hands in a time-out gesture. "Hang on. So, it is true, Rowena? He's telling the truth?"
"Dean," it said in a perfect imitation of Castiel's voice. Cas exchanged a glance with Dean, who seemed just as confused and freaked out as the angel.
"My name is Castiel," the angel said in a gruff, serious voice. He stiffly held out his hand to the two hunters, who shook it.
Castiel racked his brain. "The Winchesters. Sam and Dean, they must've made a deal."
"Goddamn it Cas, I love your eyes," Dean said while he sat across from his best friend, barely five inches between them. Of course, this wasn't the first time Dean was realizing this. He'd had feelings for Cas for about nine years now, but nothing had happened between them other than friendship.
"I think he's lying." Cas and Rowena were sent to the store for a food run while Sam, Dean, and Jack stayed to make sure Kane didn't bust out. "I don't think he's telling us why he's really here."
A/N: This one is really short but it's cute and I like it so whatever
A soul set free to fly
"Okay, fine. I'll rack it for you." The entity placed its hand on Castiel's head. Cas screamed in pain, he felt like his entire head was on fire.
"Seriously, man? You were betting on us?" But Dean couldn't keep up his fake-anger. Soon enough, he grinned. "Anyway, thanks for being cool about it. I didn't know what you were going to say."
Suddenly, Castiel felt some... other presence around him. "I know you're there," he said. "I can feel you."
Dean got an ominous feeling from Kane's words, but he shook it off. "What about you? Did you ever date anyone while you were in hiding?"
Ever since the whole Becky-magically-drugging-Sam fiasco, the Winchesters tried to stay together during their annual Vegas pilgrimage. Until the year Cas came with them.
Gradually, the boys began to trust Kane more and more. They started to look at him less like a threat and more like a little brother. They didn't know why, but something about him just seemed so... familiar.
"Then what do I do now?"
"It's in Buffalo, New York, so, long drive."
"Did- did we just-"
Cas smiled. "I know this artist. Jack listens to them sometimes."
"Wait, reprogram? Like the British Men of Letters said when they brainwashed Mom..." Dean left the room and came back with the British Men of Letters' mind-connecting machine. He called Mary and made sure she would wake them up after a few hours. And soon enough, he and Castiel were connected.
Mary exchanged a panicked glance with Sam before she thought up a convincing lie. "Well, we bet on how many times Dean's seen The Princess Bride. I said twenty, Sam only said fifteen."
Dean stopped the Impala across the street from the address Rowena gave them. The two got out and readied their guns and angel blades. "Now or never, I guess." Dean gave Cas a kiss, for luck of course. "I love you."
The Winchesters, Jack, and Cas were left watching cheesy holiday movies when Cas got up, claiming he needed Dean's help with something.
"Oh, yes, of course. That's what I meant."
"Dean, you can't pretend nothing is going on between you two. I see it, I'm sure Sam and Jack see it, too."
Dean pulled out Sam's laptop after shutting off the TV. He went to YouTube and played the song that his whole plan depended on. He could barely control his body, but he kept going. Being drunk enough to not care as much but not too drunk to not remember this really helped him go through with it.
"And?"
Sam and Cas walked over to the other two to swap info. "Did you guys find anything?" Dean asked once he slipped his arm around Castiel.
Cas paused, thinking. "Dean, I know you probably relate to Kane in some way, and that's great, but I get a bad feeling from him. I don't know why, and I can't explain it, but I don't think we can trust him." He paused. "At least not completely."
"Oh, my God," Sam said suddenly, breaking their spell. "Jack. He's gonna be thrilled, Cas."
"Guys, please. You're so cheesy I can taste it."
Dean turned the radio up, determined to celebrate with his favourite person in the world. He changed it to one of his presets, and an old familiar song came on.
"What did you guys bet on?" Jack asked innocently.
"Yeah, my theory is oleander. We saw some bushes outside her fiance's office building."
Castiel clapped his "son" on the back. "You did well on this case, Jack."
"Yeah, Sam does, but Jack doesn't."
"Cas, you've gotta listen to me," Dean tried again, placing his hand on Castiel's shoulder. Cas flinched at the touch, but he regained his composure so quickly that no one else would have noticed it.
Dean quickly wiped away a single tear. He laid back down on Cas and before he knew it, he was asleep.
"Mornin' sunshine." Dean turned on the light stick and Jack groaned.
"Yeah, a... what was it again, Cas?"
"Yeah, that would be funny."
"Wow. It's beautiful, Cas." Dean and Castiel sat on the roof of the Impala, looking out at the stars. Cas had the idea of driving out to a more rural area, just outside D.C. And it was incredible.
"Rowena, I don't give a rat's ass about the side effects. Just do the spell. Please."
He leaned forward and connected his lips to Dean's. It was only for a second, and Dean was too surprised to kiss back, but Castiel thought that conveyed all he wanted to say pretty well.
Cas held Dean's gaze for a heartbeat too long before saying, "I'm glad to be back."
When Cas woke up, he felt... different. He didn't know why at the time, but later he would describe it as how he felt before he rebelled against Heaven. As if his mission was more important than anything.
And your drinks are all gone
"Oh, no. That's gonna be a surprise for the party." He winked and kissed his angel once more before leaving to help Jack with snacks and get a final headcount on their Halloween party.
All Dean could remember of that night were the diamonds in Cas' eyes as he watched the screen above them. It was one of the rare occasions when Dean drank enough to blackout any memories.
"Good to meet ya." Dean shook hands with both Jim and Dale before gesturing to the angel at his side. The angel didn't say anything until Dean elbowed him in the side.
There was a sizeable mountain of presents underneath, all wrapped with varying degrees of skill and different wrapping papers.
Mary was back from a case, so Dean had to make extra pancakes. He whistled "Cherry Pie" while he cooked, much to his mother's amusement.
"Oh no. Dean, what are you planning?"
"You boys," Rowena huffed when she walked through the door. "Callin' me every other day when you need help." She set her bag down on the table and hugged Jack, Sam, Dean, and Cas. "Now, where is this half-demon?"
"Jack, it's not rocket science. Kane drugged us and took Cas. I should've listened to Cas. Ever since that kid showed up, he's been telling me he has a bad feeling, but I never listened to him. And now he's gone." Dean's voice wavered for a second, but he regained his composure.
"Dean, stop thinking about it," Cas told his boyfriend in a soothing tone. Cas could tell when Dean was in this mood, as he was very often nowadays. "Jack will be completely fine. I mean, we've been raising him his whole life. He's a good person."
Jack hadn't brought up Dean and Cas being together since the day after Cas came back, which Dean was grateful for. However, it also made Dean anxious. Part of him just wanted Jack to find out about him and Cas on accident, or confront Dean about it so he didn't have to think about it so much. Because every time he tried to tell Jack, something held him back.
Cas spit in Kane's face. "Ooh, ho ho! You're getting feisty, aren't you? Well, that won't last for long. My procedure's almost ready." Kane wheeled out a machine that looked like the Men of Letters' mind-connecting machine. He stuck a syringe into Cas' neck, and that's the last thing the real Cas would remember for a while.
"I just need to talk."
"So anyway, uh," Jim shifted on his stool, trying to get concrete proof to win this bet. "How'd you two meet, anyway? I mean, everyone's heard of you guys and your brother stopping the Apocalypse and stuff, but no one really knows how that happened."
Cas chuckled dryly. He decided he didn't have anything to lose by letting Dean know what had really happened. "Sorry, not possessed again. I'm still me, just a little... adjusted. You can thank Kane for that, by the way."
"I... I wanted you to come back. I begged for you to come back, but... I didn't know how. I don't think it was me."
Cas paused the song and turned to look at Dean, whose heart was almost beating out of his chest. "Dean, I..."
"Hey Cas, you know what would be really funny?" Dean could tell he was extremely drunk at this point, but Cas just went along with it.
"Really? Dean, it's been three days since our last case."
"Yeah, I've run into her a few times before, on hunts," Dale explained. "She's a damn fine hunter."
"Um... Cas, do you... remember what happened last night?"
"I-I read your mind, such as it is."
"Because it is." Those three words held an apology, a freedom, a second chance, a farewell. Dean inhaled, ready to argue, ready to say anything, but Castiel speaks before he can. "I love you." His face hardened in determination, his jaw trembling but his eyes clear of any regret or guilt.
Sam looked up from his book. "That does sound weird, but are we sure it's our kind of weird?"
All he wanted to do was just to grab Cas right then and there and make out with him, and definitely more. Of course, this wasn't strange by itself, but it came out of nowhere.
"Jack, Sam, come on. Let's get Dean his pie."
Dean watched with a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach as drunk Dean convinced Cas to get married.
"Thanks, Rowena," Dean said as he and Cas prepared to leave the bunker.
"Yeah, it's really me." Cas smiled faintly, and Dean almost ran over to him. He kissed his angel, sweetly and gently. After all of that time, Dean was afraid Cas would slip away from him.
"Oh. Okay."
I am gonna help to see it through
"Well, three people got gored in a forest. Cops are saying it's a wild deer, but get this: they all had wounds in their calves."
Cas leaned forward. "Did she have any idea who the affair was with? Her name, what she looked like, anything like that?"
"Oh, look at you. You're like a lost little primordial puppy." Kane stood back up and busied himself with instruments and jars on a table. It looked like some kind of spell, but Castiel couldn't tell what it was for. "Don't worry, your little hunter won't be harmed. We all know Chuck's finale for the Winchesters. Biblical fratricide, and all that. Anyway, you won't have free will long enough to stop those two. Now, let's get this show on the road, shall we?" Kane snapped his fingers, and the angel, half-demon, and table of spell ingredients were in some kind of opulent house.
Jack decided Dean wouldn't talk about it any more, so he left. Little did Dean know, he went to ask Castiel the same question.
"What do you want, Cas?" Dean's tone made Cas' heart collapse in on itself. This was the total opposite of anything Cas would ever want to do. All the angel ever wanted was to make Dean happy, and here he was making his best friend cry.
All of a sudden, Cas' vision went black. The last thing he saw was the signet ring on Kane's finger, right on the outside of his fist.
Sam rolled his eyes but followed his brother out of the morgue.
"I need help. You guys are the best hunters in the world, so I figured if anyone could help me, you could."
"I'll take that bet." Jim and Dale shook hands, and the whole deal was settled before Dean and the angel sat down at the bar a stool away from them, Dean on the closer side.
"Yes, I do. Sam and Dean need me."
Once Dean had gotten perfectly uncomfortable, he started trying to get out the right words. Sam, being the good brother he is, didn't try to force Dean into saying anything.
I will protect you in the night
"For the last time, I'm not going to massacre you," Kane said, annoyed. "Can I please have a sandwich?"
"Oh." Jack smiled. "That's a good movie."
"Tonight, we are watching Terminator." Dean held up the movie and grinned. "Can you go help Cas with the popcorn and pizza and stuff?"
Coughing up feathers
"Does this pie taste funny to you?" was all Dean could get out before his head dropped onto the table, along with Sam and Jack. They were all out cold. Cas felt like he was on some kind of bad trip, but he didn't pass out.
Castiel was still worried, but he decided there was no use arguing, so he stood against the wall with Sam and Dean while Jack and Kane talked.
It's a place where you will learn
"Hm." Jim took a long drink from his bottle, finishing it off. "What's next for you two, then?"
He leaned forward, hearing Cas's grunt of surprise as their lips connected. One hand wound itself around Cas's waist, holding the angel as close as Dean dared. The other hand snaked up to hold the back of Castiel's neck, brushing over the soft curls.
Castiel smiled and kissed the hunter. "Let's see your costume, then."
"I know. They're almost as beautiful as you." Cas smiled at Dean.
"Are we going to talk about what's been up with you lately?" Dean asked tiredly one day, completely out of the blue.
Dean lifted Cas's chin with a single finger, kissing him until he smiled. "Cas, you never have to pretend around me. I know you're not the most... well-versed in human things, but if you don't know about something, just ask me." He smiled and kissed Cas again before realizing that he left Sam outside in the car, waiting for him. "Damn it. I have to go. Let's pick this back up when I get back, okay?" He kissed Cas again and left the bunker, a giant smile plastered on his face the whole drive to the murder scene.
"In D.C., a man found his fiancee in her apartment. The police report says that her heart gave out."
"So? People died weird in Peoria, Illinois."
Once everyone had been introduced and greeted, they were led to the Dean Cave. Jack brought out the food, and the party was started.
"Well, maybe this James guy is bad news."
"No, man, I'm just... real happy to see you, that's all."
"Dean, we don't know what happened." Jack tried to console his "father", but Dean wasn't having any of it.
"Easy for you to say. You're not the one he bought a costume for." Sam stared in horror at the long black cloak, broomstick, and pointed witch's hat that Jack expected him to wear.
"Uh, OK, come on in." Dean shut off the TV and put down the beer he was drinking. "What do we need to talk about?"
The walls you built within
Castiel was silent for a few seconds. Then, he decided no words could describe what Cas wanted to say to Dean.
"Dean, stop blaming yourself. And we'll get Cas back. We always do." Of course, this was all Sam could do right now, just try and give his big brother hope. But the truth was, Sam had no idea how they were going to get Cas back, especially if Kane was working for Chuck. "Come on, let's get a good night's sleep and we'll start looking for him first thing."
"Yes. That's right. Nothing. Nothing but Empty. And you are soaking in it. Angels and demons, you all come here when you die."
Everyone arrived at a little later than 7, all wearing costumes. Garth and Bess wore werewolf costumes, complete with tattered flannels and fur-covered gloves. Claire had very intricate skeleton makeup, Jody was a zombie, Rowena was a fake witch (a lot like Sam's costume, actually), Mary was a ghost, and Jack was also a zombie. Everyone had their costume on except Dean, who was still keeping Cas in suspense.
A/N: Hey, Ryan here. I've had this thing in the works since like last summer, and I for some reason haven't finished it until now, but I wanted to publish something for Dean's birthday, so here ya go. Enjoy!
"Yeah. I guess."
"Yeah, well, it's not. Just drop it, Jack. Please."
They taught him about family, and how it doesn't end in blood. About how you don't leave family behind. About how you love them with all your being, even if they infuriate you.
"Or because I was too chickenshit to admit I liked you." Dean reached out and caressed Cas's face, looking deep into his boyfriend's eyes. "...Goodnight, Cas."
"Wait, Dean, I need your help with something," Cas called from the kitchen.
He could just ignore it. He and Cas would call Sam and Jack, see how they were doing, and they'd forget the whole thing. Right?
"So, what's this case you found us?" Sam asked once they were on the road to Peoria.
"Every angel that ever died is here?"
Look like the cat that just ate the canary
Dean's eyes dropped to the ground. Of course, this new Castiel couldn't understand Dean's complexities anymore, but he guessed Dean was ashamed. Which Cas could definitely work with.
"Why do you look like me?"
"I think you owe me a steak dinner, my friend. Shall we?"
"Seriously." Dean sank down next to his angel, who seemed to be trying very hard to burrow his head into Dean's arm. "Oh, come on, Cas. You don't see an angel and a demon together every day."
Once the four boys were back at the bunker and relaxing, they heard a knock at the door. Dean approached cautiously with his gun raised since no one had called to tell them they were visiting. "Who's there?"
"Yes, Dean?"
Cas, please. Send me a sign, something... anything. I need you back, Cas. I love you.
"Don't worry, they won't die." Kane stood up and strode over to Cas, who was still struggling to remain upright. "I only dosed them enough so they would fall asleep. You, however, are a mystery. I guess no one ever wrote how much belladonna to use on an angel."
I am smiling next to you..."
Sam got a book on witchcraft for beginners from Rowena, who in return got jars of potion ingredients.
"Thanks, kid. Now, go get your sleep. We're going on a case tomorrow."
Rowena rolled her eyes. "Understatement of the century."
Dean had to be sure not to make this "not-thinking-just-acting" thing a habit, but in the present situation, it was his only choice. Thinking about it too much was guaranteed to end in him chickening out, and he couldn't risk that.
Back at the bunker, Jack was sitting in the study, reading something on his laptop. "Hey, kid," Dean said, setting his duffel bag on the table.
"Yeah, we might want to do something about that."
"Yeah, not so scary now, are you, Bugs," Dean taunted the jackalope once it was safely in a cage. "Now, then. Back to the bunker?"
"Cas?" Dean stopped in front of the angel and kneeled so that they were eye to eye with each other. "What aren't you telling me?"
"What can I say? We got Cas back, you're back home, and Jack's doing pretty well with his powers. It's been a good few months."
"Actually, that legend was started by a prophet a few hundred years before this boy was born." Cas laid his hand on Dean's shoulder to get him to stop pacing.
"I love you too." They headed into the building, hoping this fight would be over soon.
"Okay, Jack, we're going to go out and see New York," Sam said, ushering Jack outside and into the Impala. He figured there may be some PG-13 things going on while Dean was 'lustful'.
"Well, I wanted to ask about you and Dean. While Sam and Dean were gone, I discovered this website called Wattpad, and there was a lot of people writing about you and Dean. Like, you were... together."
"That's good." Cas leaned over and planted a kiss on Dean's lips. "Do you want me to drive for a little while? You need your sleep."
"Dean, please. Can we talk?"
Castiel could understand that. Loyalty was one of his weak points.
Dean could feel the cloud's indecision, praying to the universe that it wouldn't take Cas. Not now. Not yet.
Cas answered this time. "I found a golden dagger lying on a table, and I thought it might do the trick. I stabbed her from behind, straight through her heart, but she turned around and knocked me back into the wall. Dean kept fighting her, and I tried to think of something I had forgotten, something that we could kill her with. Finally, I remembered her weakness: sunlight. I snuck away to one of the windows - I noticed they were unusually dark - and I found a heavy stone on the ground. I smashed it through the window, and-"
"Nothing's wrong, Cas. It's just... I love you so damn much. And I feel things for you that I've never even known were possible. I'm just... I'm scared it's not real."
Somehow, he dreaded that idea even more.
Dean buried his head in Castiel's shoulder. "I was so scared, Cas." His voice was muffled. "I was scared you were dead. Or worse."
And above all, they taught him forgiveness.
"Really, Dean?" Cas walked out of his and Dean's shared bathroom into their shared room to show his boyfriend the ridiculous costume. The pitchfork and forked tail he could deal with, but the horns? It was just so inaccurate. "You know better than anyone that this is not what demons look like."
"Do you have any idea why she was upset?"
A/N: I've had this idea for a really long time (mostly because, like Cas, I have no idea how sports work) but anyway I thought it was kinda cute. Also, the end is kind of unintentionally inspired by malec but I have no control over that part of my brain anyway
Castiel sat next to him. "Dean... this might be hard for you to hear, but... I think you should do what Chuck wants you to."
Cas shrugged. "Yeah, I guess you could call it that. Although he mostly used the word 'reprogram'."
Castiel woke up in a field. He looked up, squinting in the bright sunlight. He stood up and smiled. He could get back to his family.
"Of course. Why wouldn't I be? You and Castiel are like my fathers, and I want you to be happy."
"Yes, but there's still the side effect of-"
Castiel paused for a minute. "Dean, it's late, you should probably sleep. Aren't you and Sam heading out tomorrow?"
"Hey. You did good today, Jack." Dean left, and Jack smiled to himself.
"Yeah, Jack, good idea." Sam still had that laugh-y voice, but he was calming down. He pulled out his phone and dialled the red-haired witch. "Hey, Rowena. Dean got in a fight with a witch. No, no, he's alive, he's just... having a problem. Yeah, we're in Buffalo. Okay, see you then."
One day, a few weeks after he'd arrived at the bunker, Kane decided he should make everyone dinner, as a show of good faith. He even made Dean pie.
"Well, then? Go on, dig in." The five of them sat down and began to eat. Sam, of course, had mostly salad.
"What?" Dale asked in disbelief. "No way."
"Just like Dean," Sam joked.
"Rowena, wait." Jack stopped her before she could get out the door. "We might still need your help. Please."
Cas smiled. "Don't worry. I'm showing you my memory of last night."
As the sun set over the bunker, the Winchesters prepared for a night of spooks and fun.
"Cas, wait." He grabbed the angel's arm, the familiar fabric grounding him. "Thank you, Cas." His voice was raw, threatening to give out once again. "Thank you for- for telling me. I know how... uh, how hard that must have been."
"...Cas? What's up?" Dean lumbered down the stairs and kissed his angel on the crown of his head, his green eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiled.
"Hey, Sammy. We kinda need to talk."
"Oh, what's this? Does the little angel want his boyfriend again?" Kane laughed. "Castiel, how many times do I have to tell you?" He knelt down and forced Cas to look him in the eyes. "Dean can't save you. Best to just forget about him."
"No, no, it should come from me." Dean started to stand up. "I guess there's no putting this off."
Cas stopped, his shoulders tensed under the trench coat. Dean took this as a good sign and kept going.
"Of course, Dean. I'll just wait here then." Castiel ended the call and sat down on a rock. Kane clapped dramatically.
"I like where this is headed." Dean smiled against Cas' lips. Then he pulled away. "But, the kid. And Sammy."
"That's not part of the deal. No, no. Besides, you don't want to go back."
"Eh, had a few girlfriends, some boyfriends. But none of them really lasted. I never got that... deeper feeling, you know?"
"Why don't you go see if Sam and Jack need any help with dinner?"
"Uh, sure." Sam patted the edge of the bed. "Sit down."
"Dean. Look at me." Cas looked Dean in the eyes, and Dean saw something... fiery in those blue oceans. "I'm real. This is real. And it doesn't matter what we have to save the world from next. This will always be real."
Cas chuckled humourlessly. "I don't think anyone can act well enough to convince a Winchester to kill his brother."
"Alright, well thank you, Doctor. We'll go do some more digging, and we'll get back to you."
I am gonna help you see it through
"My name's Kane Fisher. I'm here to see the Winchesters." It sounded like a young British man, probably in his late teens.
"I love you, Cas." Dean gripped Castiel's arm, his words muffled by that goddamn trench coat that Dean secretly loved.
"Goddamn it," Dale muttered.
Dean looked over and saw Jim's flannel and recognized him as a hunter. "Yeah, I'm Dean. And you are?"
Dean smiled. "Do you wanna... I don't know, get some breakfast?"
Castiel flashed him a wan smile, turning quickly on his heels again as Dean released his arm. He sped down the hall, his trench coat billowing up behind him like a cape. The closing of his bedroom door could probably have been heard throughout the entire bunker; it could certainly be heard by Dean.
"Well, think!"
"Hey, Cas." Dean woke up in a hotel bed, smiling down at the angel cuddling next to him. The shirtless angel. "Wait. Cas?!" Dean sat bolt upright, racking his brain in a vain effort to remember the night before.
"Nothing. It's just strange how much we have in common, given how different we are. I mean, I'm a half-demon, half-witch, and you're a Hunter and a Man of Letters."
"What is this place?"
But it was worth it.
"Oh, God," Sam groaned. "I thought you swore on your grave."
Jack shushed Sam. "Why are you here?"
Jim started to say, "Yeah, way," but right then, the door of the bar opened and speak of the devil-killer, in walked Dean Winchester himself. Beside him was a man with dark hair and a tan trench coat. "That's him!" Jim whispered, excited. "That's the angel!"
"I don't even know what to say," Sam said.
"Guys, I think I found a case," Jack said suddenly. Sam was absorbed in some book about boring stuff, and Dean was absorbed in Cas' eyes, so neither of them heard Jack.
Kane blinked, surprised. "Yes, I am. Did you know my mother?"
"Little busy here, Sam," he said, annoyed.
"I swear on my own grave, Sammy, Cas and I will not do gross couple stuff the whole time." Dean shot Sam a cheesy grin. Sam rolled his eyes.
"Hey, Castiel, I have a question for you."
"Yeah, no, not touching that with a ten-foot pole," Dean said, closing Jack's computer. "Anyway, we have someone we want you to meet."
"Yeah, I would call eighteen hours a long drive," Cas said, laughing at his boyfriend.
"Thanks, Mom. For being so cool." Dean hugged Mary and left to tell Cas that Mary knew.
"There was a young man strapped to a table, and a strange woman in a dark corner," Castiel explained, taking a drink and squinting.
"It looked like a... a rabbit. With horns?"
"Yep, the very same. Apparently, he died the exact same way as Sarah Robinson."
"Well, I think you're going to like this." Cas handed Dean the box.
If I can think of something clever
"Oh, I'm intrigued. Who are we killing this time?"
"She's gonna be here in a few hours. Now, let's go back to the motel."
"Not horns," Castiel said, appearing in the backseat. "Antlers."
*SPOILER WARNING FOR 15x18*
"No, I actually wanted to ask you something," Jack said, walking closer to Dean with that same Bambi look he always had. "Is what I was reading... Is it true? Is that why you closed the computer?"
"I'm already saved." The entity kicked him again.
"Sammy!" Dean whisper-yelled, trying to stop Jack from talking about Destiel.
Which meant... what? Did he love him like a brother? That must be it. That had to be it. If it wasn't it, then... Dean didn't know how to do this. How to... how to turn down someone that important to him. Someone so vital. Or would he even turn Cas down?
Cas stood up. "Having me awake causes you pain."
"Oh, that's not fair. You know I can't resist your puppy-dog eyes, Jack."
Cas looked down at his shoes in shame. "I was just pretending."
As soon as they drove away into the city, Dean crashed his lips onto Cas's. He moved them both onto the bed and continued to taste Cas until he could barely form coherent thoughts.
"Well, she seemed to think that he was their next-door neighbour."
The movie was over, and Dean still hadn't told Jack. Oh, God, it was so much easier when the other person brought it up, but Jack was just so... clueless. Either that, or he was scared Dean would get angry again.
Cas paused. "Yes. And Dean, we'll find a way to bring him back."
"Alright, guys. Here's what I'm thinking so far. Jealous woman finds her fiance cheating. She poisons the mistress, then poisons herself. She just gave herself a higher dose." The coroner, a short, balding, middle-aged man was pacing around the morgue.
"What kind of special?" Cas asked.
Jack paused for a moment, but it felt like hours to Dean. Then, finally, he smiled. "I knew it. You stare at each other too much."
AND HE WAS KISSING BACK.
So here it is, another chance
"'Demon blood'?" Dean read off the label Jack wrote for the dark red punch. "Sammy's gonna love that. Anyway, who all is coming tonight?"
"Yeah, we just gotta prepare for the biggest 'I told you so' she's ever given us." Dean chuckled, pulling out his phone to call Rowena. "Hey, Rowena, we need your help." Dean paused, listening before he handed the phone to Cas. "She wants to talk to you."
Cas looked at Dean in surprise. "What? Of course not."
Rowena was laughing as hard as Sam once she saw Dean. "Wow, Dean, now you really are an ass!" Jack and Sam laughed at that. Cas was just concerned, and Dean was annoyed. "Tell me, where'd Shrek go?"
"So, Sammy, I found us a case," Dean said to Sam when he walked into the library.
Jack stood up, a mix of confusion and wonder on his face. "Castiel? But... you're dead. We burned you, and... what's burned stays dead. How are you..."
Castiel had been watching over Dean and his brother since their mother died. He'd seen them grow up, he'd seen Sam leave for college, he'd seen Dean join the family business because he was too loyal to his father to disobey.
Sam noticed what just happened, but he didn't address it. "So, you know what it is, then?"
"Shh." Dean held on even tighter. "It's okay. It wasn't you."
Castiel held the phone up to his ear. "Dean, I got away. I need you to pick me up."
Once they were in their room (yes, their room) Castiel shut the door and produced a small wrapped box from the pocket of his trenchcoat. "Do you remember the amulet Sam gave you many years ago? The one that is supposed to glow in God's presence?"
"I had an idea. Come on."
"Cas, I've been wanting to tell you something for so long, since I had the Mark, pretty much. It's just been so goddamn long, I don't even know if I can tell you this. Look, when you died, I kept having this dream. I was reliving when I went into a confessional while we were working a case. And this was back when I was convinced the Mark was gonna kill me. And I realized that I wanted to... I needed to let you know this, and then you died, and I didn't know what to do, and-"
"Oh." Dean closed the computer. "Yeah, no... I get it." Dean stood up and walked as fast as he could to his room, locking the door as soon as he got in.
Castiel couldn't quite put his finger on how Dean was different from all the other humans he'd seen. Dean was the angel's mission from his father. God had big plans for this man.
"I know, Cas. But right now, I need sleep. Goodnight." He kissed Cas' forehead and allowed his angel to rest his head on Dean's chest.
"No, really, they're like..." Dean tried to find the right words. "It's like they hold oceans inside them. They're beautiful. Just like you are, Cas."
"She could be, but angry spirits are born of violent deaths. Heart attacks don't exactly scream 'violent, horrific murder' to me."
"Dean, he doesn't think you're gay. He thinks you love me." Cas could hear his own heartbeat through his shirt, and he was sure Dean could, too. He'd been waiting so long to tell Dean this, but he was so nervous, he couldn't get the words out.
"What the hell?" Sam demanded.
"Now Cas, when we go in there, I want you to let me handle it." The two men had been driving for about ten hours already, and all they could talk about was what they were about to do.
"Dean, it's the only way to fix all of this. You know Chuck won't stop until you do. Look, you can't tell me you haven't considered it."
Dean decided to just get it over with as soon as possible. No chick-flick moments. "So, for a while now, pretty much since Cas came back, we've been... Well, we've been dating."
"Alright, so now that we're all here and conscious, I have news on the case." Sam stood up and pulled out his phone. "While I was out, the coroner called me to say that they found another body. The next-door neighbour."
Dean sniffed. "Yeah, let's get back to the kid."
"Of course I do. Remember those girls who wrote the musical? They called it the samulet. They said it was 'a symbol of me and Sammy's brotherly love.'"
"Thanks."
"Well, Jack... you remember what you were telling me, about "deastiel" or whatever?"
"Cas, just shut up for a second, please." Dean placed a hand on Cas's back, unfamiliar with how to comfort Cas like this. "Yeah, you've made mistakes. But haven't we all? I mean, Sam started the freaking apocalypse. I was a demon." Dean paused.  "Look, I don't care what mistakes you've made, because you're Cas. You're my best friend, and now, you're my husband, I guess." The two of them chuckled.
Of course, the entire Heavenly Host was built to be soldiers of the Lord; unwavering, unoriginal, trusting orders they didn't feel the need to question. Castiel was the same.
I am smiling next to you, in silent lucidity. If you open your mind for me
"I'm telling you, Dean, I don't see a connection."
Castiel, who was clearly much less shy with the physical contact, placed a hand comfortingly on Dean's. "I, uh... I rescued Dean from Hell fifteen years ago."
Unfortunately, Dean's phone started ringing. He groaned, seeing that it was Sam calling.
"What if it wasn't just a heart attack?" Jack suggested. "Mr Robinson said that she seemed depressed the days before she died. What if she killed herself?"
Silence on the other end. Then, "...Cas? Oh, my God, you have no idea how great it is to hear your voice, man." A pause. "Where are you?"
Cas couldn't forget about it. He decided to go to Dean's room and ask him about it.
Inside was a simple cord necklace, just like the samulet, except the charm was small silver wings. Dean put it on immediately, a smile across his entire face. "I love it, Cas. I'll never take it off."
"Well, let's go see what's what." Dean parked Baby and they went to see the coroner.
"Jesus, Cas!" Dean jumped so high his head hit the roof of the car.
Castiel woke up in the dungeon. Dean stood in front of him, eyes blazing. "Get out of him, you son of a bitch," he growled.
"Actually, it's more of a revenge situation."
"Because Dean, we have no proof that he's evil. Plus, we may be able to use him later." Cas tilted his head, trying to figure out his boyfriend's actions.
"How'd it go?" Jack asked, taking their duffel bags and setting them on the map table like he always did after a hunt.
Dean's eyes blazed, his temporary anger overpowering the despair. "You what?"
Dean turned back, seeing Cas standing there, at peace with his fate. He saw the black cloud reach for Cas, and all thought left his mind. He just acted.
"Rowena, what's going on?"
"Yeah, 'melted brain' sounds pretty witchy to me, too." Sam walked over and sat down next to Dean (and by extension, Cas, who was standing right behind Dean).
"Everything is already either made or in the oven, so there's nothing to worry about."
"Yeah, I was. But then I... annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me back." Cas looked kind of proud of himself. Dean thought it was adorable.
"Yeah, you know her?" Dean once again subtly touched Castiel's hand, only for a split-second. It seemed careful, calculated, just quick enough that any passersby wouldn't see it unless they were looking for it, but meaningful enough that the angel would notice it.
"I do. Welcome home, pal." Dean walked forward and hugged Cas, for the first time in a long time. He hugged Cas like he was afraid he would disappear, but Dean couldn't help it. Cas just felt so... real. Of course, Dean had had countless dreams that Cas had come back, but none of them were like this. None of them gave him this much hope.
"Oh, okay Dean." Jack sat back down on the couch and looked up expectantly.
Dean signalled to Jack that the four of them needed to talk about Kane.
The boys escorted her to the dungeon where they had chained up Kane for "protection". Truthfully, they didn't even know if the chains would hold him, which is why they didn't let Rowena in there alone.
"Actually, you know what would be funnier?" Dean was absolutely giddy. His voice dropped to a low whisper. "If we got married."
"Hey, you're that Winchester guy, right? Dean?" Jim asked in fake nonchalance.
"We just need to consider every possibility."
"Alright, I guess you've all waited long enough." Dean left the room to put on his costume and came back about ten minutes later.
"Yeah, sure, Jack. Sit down." Cas pulled out a chair for Jack in the bunker's study. "What's your question?"
"Dean, I'm telling you, nothing supernatural is going on here."
"Cas, it can't hurt to hear him out."
"Yeah, sure." Dean pulled over and they switched seats. Castiel wasn't so good at keeping his eyes on the road either, not with Dean sleeping so beautifully in the seat beside him.
"Up your ass is where."
Master of illusion, can you realize
"Nothing!" Dean said, sounding like he very much had a plan. He slung his arm around Cas' shoulders. "All you have to worry about is being hot as hell, so there's really nothing to worry about." Dean winked and kissed his angel, which resulted in groaning from both Sam and Jack.
"Let's go."
"But, those aren't real. They're just dead rabbits and deer put together to make an urban legend," Sam said.
"That doesn't sound the same as what Dean said," Jack told Cas, sounding confused. "Dean got very... defensive, it seemed."
"Hey, I said we wouldn't the whole time. Besides, I've had many graves."
Cas had apparently been shopping at the Hot Topical again because Claire opened a box with many necklaces and earrings.
"We should call Rowena," Jack suggested. "He said his mother was a witch, so maybe she knows if he's telling the truth.
"How'd you find the thing, though?" Dale asked, grasping at anything to continue the conversation. He would not go down this easy.
Dean held a hand up. "Don't worry about it, man. Actually, uh..." He cleared his throat, standing up and pulling on a green jacket. "I think we're gonna head out. I'm beat, and I'm sure Cas is, too. Thanks for the beer, and the conversation." He smiled gratefully before turning towards the door, the angel following suit.
He looked, the tears blurring the cloud of black. The Empty.
Cas was caught well off-guard at first, but he soon melted into Dean's touch, kissing back desperately. It was as if their lives depended on it; of course, after twelve years of hopeless longing, I'm sure it felt that way.
"What the hell?" Sam and Dean had arrived at the city's morgue and were now investigating the three victims. "What kind of animal does this?"
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
Cas left the room with a muttered "Alright," which was when Kane decided to talk about things other than food.
"What the hell happened to you two?" Mary asked, stirring the boys out of their moment.
"Yes, which is when I knew neither Jack nor your brother would be awake." Castiel started to kiss Dean, slowly moving his mouth.
"Cas, you are going to love this," Dean said, leading the angel through crowds of people on Fremont Street to watch the light show. Sam was back in the brothers' hotel room (Cas had a separate one) because he "wanted to watch a documentary". During Vegas week.
"Oh, God," Dean groaned. "I think I know where this is going."
Dean snuggled up closer to Cas on the motel bed. Sam and Jack had both passed out a while ago, but Dean was deliberately still watching the movie. Of course, staying awake also meant he could kiss Cas more.
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Dean drove Baby down a dark highway. Someone's cell phone rang, waking up Sam. Dean answered it. It was a familiar voice.
"Well, the legend also says I got a bit... murderous towards the end of my life. But I swear to you, none of that was true. The police thought I killed a bunch of people, so I had to get away. I've been hiding since... well, about the seventeenth century."
Dean finger-gun snapped at Jack. "Yes! Perfect." Dean grabbed Castiel's arm and the four boys headed out the door.
Cas paused. He set his hand on Dean's leg and decided not to let Dean be suicidal in this fight. "It's my life, Dean. And it's my fault. So if you think I'm going to let you clean up my mess again, you're wrong. We're either doing this together or I'm doing it alone."
Not when he could just now see a light at the end of the tunnel.
"Oh, Cas." Dean rushed forward and hugged his angel. Castiel allowed himself to melt into the hug and kiss that soon followed. Of course, Cas was indifferent at best, but he couldn't let Dean notice that. Kane watched the scene from behind the trees.
"I know exactly what you mean. Hell, I only ever got to the 'relationship' phase twice before Cas."
Dean stood there for a second, or it may have been minutes. Hell, it may have been freaking hours.
"Are you kidding? I never forget a bet."
"Well..." Dean paused, trying not to sprint out of the room. He decided to just get it over with, rip it off like a bandage. "It's real-life now. Cas and I."
Castiel smiled. "What?"
In the sickness of you
"Yes, it is," Sam agreed, and they continued making dinner.
The old Castiel wouldn't have seen it, the Castiel before he met these extraordinary men. He would've thought, as most angels did, that they were just blindly, insanely co-dependent on each other.
"Alright." The man paused for a second, rubbing his chin. "You know, now that I think about it, she'd been pretty upset recently. I don't know if that helps."
"And what do you want with us?" Dean asked, glancing back at his brother, who shrugged.
Until he met Dean.
"Oh. Okay." Jack went back to sleep.
"Yeah, maybe we can find a way to kill it there," Sam agreed.
"You two are very cute together, you know. That's not the kind of thing you take for granted."
"If I hadn't insisted it wasn't a werewolf, you would've gone in and gotten yourself killed-"
Cas softly tugged at Dean's hair, pulling away after a few seconds. His face was flushed and his lips glossy, a serene smile sitting on them.
Cas lifted his head and smiled back. "I'd love to."
Cas decided to bring Jack along to this one since Dean and Sam had been up for hours and needed rest.
Castiel laid his hand on Dean's, something he thought conveyed affection. He softly made circles with his thumb. After a few minutes, Dean started to open up. "Cas, I just... I don't know what to do anymore. I mean, so many times, me and Sam have been sacrificing ourselves for each other, sacrificing the world for each other. And I'd do it a thousand times, but... I can't do this. Everyone we love, everyone in the whole freaking world, they're gonna suffer because I'm being selfish. But do we even know for sure if Chuck is going to stop? I can't just... kill Sam for nothing."
Dean leaned forward and kissed his angel, and the rest of that night was spent together.
"Angel blade, maybe? It kills demons, why not half-demons?"
"No, I, uh..." Dean sheepishly rubbed his neck. What did he think would happen, that Cas would make the first move and he could just stand there and not burst into flames? Ah, screw it all. He'd done this a thousand times, what made this time any harder? It's Cas, a tiny voice in his head said. You've never cared about anyone else this much.
Jack tried to wrap his head around that. "Hang on. Demons are just souls, like corrupted ghosts. How do you even exist?"
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
"Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Well, I show up in my real form, and you freak out, rip out your own eyes, et cetera. That would be embarrassing, wouldn't it? For both of us."
"What the hell, Cas?" Dean looked over at the clock. "It's two a.m."
It was Christmas for the Winchesters. Everyone, even Jody and the girls, Donna, and Rowena came to the bunker to celebrate with all the true Winchesters plus Castiel and Jack.
This one is kinda short too but I think it's really cute :)
"This." Cas surprised Dean by rushing forward and kissing the hunter, desperate, yet sweet. Dean's eyes widened, but he soon melted into the kiss, completely forgetting all of his surroundings. His only thought was that Cas' lips tasted like mint - refreshing and electrifying his entire body.
"Oh." Cas leaned back. "She thought her fiance was engaging in a gay affair?"
Dean sighed in relief. But his breathing was interrupted again by Jack after they finished the movie.
"Hey, Jack?" Dean signalled to Cas and Sam to leave before he stopped Jack. "I need to talk to you."
"Dean, I'm so-"
Going through Castiel's mind was like opening your eyes underwater. Dean could only make out rough shapes, but after a while, he found a clear memory. Cas was teaching Jack how to make pasta in the bunker's kitchen.
The boys thought the grey concrete and steel of the building was too boring for the holidays, so they hung up multicoloured fairy lights throughout the whole bunker. But what was really impressive was the tree.
"Jack, we thought you might have something to do with how I got back. Did you bring me back?"
Once Sam and Jack were both asleep in the backseat, Cas started to talk. "So, you told Jack yesterday?"
Cas didn't try to hold the tears back; if he did, he'd never get through this. "I always wondered, ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be. What my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer because the one thing I want... It's something I know I can't have. But I think I know... I think I know now. Happiness isn't in the having, it's in just being. It's in just saying it."
"Seriously, Dean?" Cas called from the couch.
The whole wedding was a cringe-fest, so Cas decided to spare Dean the details. The memory picked back up after they were back in Cas' hotel room.
"Ah, ah, ah. Not a chick." Jim leaned in again and whispered, "It's a dude."
He heard quiet shifting noises, which meant Dean probably wasn't asleep yet, which was good. Cas knew Dean was an angry sleeper, like a bear.
"Are you kidding? You know I'll always accept you. You're my brother."
"Yeah. But first, I wanted to play you a song that Sam found a while ago. I think you'll like it." Dean had been planning this moment for days, going over it in his head and bouncing ideas off of Sam until he got tired of his brother and made Jack endure Dean's obsessiveness instead.
"Yeah."
"Well, Jack was talking to me earlier about how you got... defensive when he asked about you and me being... together."
"I'm a disappearing act done poorly
"You know, now that you mention Castiel..."
Castiel turned around to reveal... himself? "What are you?"
"Dean?" Cas asked, leaning into the room for permission to enter. "We need to talk."
Dean turned to his angel, serious and tired. "You remember all of it, don't you?"
"Okay. But we'll find a way to bring Sam back. I know we will."
"If you can't sleep, I can't sleep. Yeah? And I like sleep. I need sleep."
Castiel woke up in a dark warehouse, alone, tied to a chair. He had been gagged with his blue tie. He saw a light turn on around the corner, and soon enough, Kane came sauntering into the room.
And sure, Sam and Dean made their mark on the world and saved it countless times, but they also left an indelible impression on Castiel.
So I've had this thing on Wattpad for a while and posted it there originally (this is actually my first foray into AO3, it's not as confusing as it was before which is good). So anyway uh give me feedback! I may revisit this later - I know it is not my best work by a long shot, but it's one of the first stories I've ever finished so I'm proud of that.
"That's what I thought as well. However, that was our proof. Now, I haven't found a way to kill them, but they can be trapped if we lure them with whisky."
"I don't know, Dean. It looks like a deer attack."
"Agents, you know I have to keep up doctor-patient confidentiality," Dr Warner said. He was a professional man - glasses, short black hair, suit, grey tie.
Dean went to the kitchen to get a beer and found Jack drinking a glass of water at the sink.
Every prayer broke Cas' heart a little more. Every time he heard Dean's voice in his head, he felt his heart reach out and try to find Dean. But no matter how hard he tried, the distance was too much.
"And maybe you're right, about the kid. I mean, he tries. I'll give him that. And he tapped his powers, saved our ass, so that's a win." Except for the fact that everything he did reminded him of Cas.
"Okay, that's enough of that," Dean said, and he placed the cage and the jackalope in the trunk of the Impala and refused to talk about it.
He turned back to Cas, and the sickening drop in his stomach grew bigger. The door flew open, revealing Billie and her scythe. She looked almost like she was about to burst into flames; although, with her being Death, it was highly possible.
Bye, love y'all!
And ride the whims of your mind
When they were done with the lasagna, each of them took a piece of the pie. They started to dig in, which is when things started to go wrong.
"Gonna need a lifetime of therapy bills probably," Dean admitted, "but fine."
"Hello," said a voice behind him.
"Not just that. She caught him on the phone with another man."
"What do you mean? Nothing's 'up' with me."
Suddenly, a strange feeling flooded Dean's head, and the hotel room was swept away, replaced by himself from Cas' point of view under the lights on Fremont Street.
Everything stopped for a second. Then Dean broke the silence. "Cas, is that really you?" Castiel could hear the emotion in his voice, Dean was scared that this wasn't real.
"You poisoned us?" Cas gave up on standing, instead deciding to cradle Dean's hand while he knelt on the floor. "Why?"
"Why are you telling me this now?"
"Nothing," he kept saying. "I just... I get worried when you go out on hunts." Cas must've been getting better at acting because Dean bought it.
"Yeah, he could be, but why would he kill the man he was having an affair with? I mean, he could be not human, but that doesn't give him a for-sure motive."
After a while, it came to the parts that Dean had no recollection of whatsoever. And what happened surprised him.
The entity backed away. "No. No."
"Okay. I believe you. But why did you want to see us?"
"Well, it was arguably worse than Hell," Castiel said honestly.
"Yeah, no demon is as gorgeous as you are," Dean said, walking across the room and lacing his arms around the angel's waist.
"He seems like he was telling the truth. And it's not like what he's saying is impossible."
Dean was confused. He could feel Cas' emotions, but what he felt right now was... hope. And he felt Cas trying to restrict himself. But drunk Dean could break through those restrictions.
"Sure, Dean." Jack left, and Dean sighed in relief. Tonight was the night he and Cas planned to tell Jack, and Dean had no idea how he was going to manage that.
Jack winked at Dean, apparently having figured out what Destiel meant. "I was looking for cases mostly, but I didn't find anything."
"I'm sorry Dean, didn't mean to scare you," Cas said, resting a hand on Dean's shoulder before he realized what he had done. He took his hand away and sat up straighter.
"Well, there's not anything you can do, besides wait for it to wear off, which will take about a day."
"You might want to see this." Castiel sat upright and placed his hands on either side of Dean's head.
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
"Yes, sleeping an endless peaceful sleep. You know I... I was sleeping, too." He started to sound angry. "Hey, uh, since we're pals, there's something I've gotta know. I've just gotta ask. Hmm. Why are you awake? 'Cause fun fact—in all of forever, nothing ever wakes up here. I mean, ever. Ever. And second fun fact—when you woke up, I woke up, and I don't like being awake. So...what's up, smart guy?"
"Alright, fine," Dean conceded. "So anyway, we came into town because people kept finding bodies with charred chest cavities - no hearts. Obviously, we're thinkin' werewolf from the jump, but this one here," Dean elbowed Castiel, "wasn't so sure." He smirked at the angel, who frowned.
"No, Cas. Uh... we didn't... do anything, did we?"
"Well, why don't we check out the forest where they were found and you'll see that I'm right."
"Wait, you do? Okay, I'm sorry, please take these things off my head."
"Oh, I wouldn't talk to me like that if you didn't want to spend the rest of your life with donkey ears. Especially not if I know exactly how to make them go away."
Interesting, Jim thought. Very interesting. Looks like I should hold off on making dinner for Jordan tonight.
"Send. Me. Back."
"Hush now, don't you cry
Jack flew himself and Cas to James Robinson's house, which left Sam and Dean to go to the coroner's office.
"So I'll go buy some. I can be back here by midnight, and then you can help me decorate the bunker. Sam and Dean will wake up to the Halloween they never had."
"I might know a spell we could try." Rowena winked.
"Welcome to my 'I Promise I Won't Kill You' dinner," Kane joked, his arms spread wide. He had prepared a favourite family dinner for the Winchesters (and Cas, who had not yet married into the family): tossed salad and lasagna with a blackberry pie for dessert, which Dean was eyeing.
Dean smiled. "And tomorrow, we celebrate."
Cas' stomach dropped. Dean had been crying. Because of him.
Cas paused for a second before deciding that straightforwardness was probably best. "It's Kane. He double-crossed us. He was working for Chuck."
"So Jack, what have you been doing while we were out?" Sam asked while they were halfway through Children of the Corn.
It took Dean a while to comprehend what happened, but once he did, he leaned in and reciprocated the kiss. This time, both of them were participating.
Dean reached over and laced his fingers with Cas's, definitely not keeping his eyes on the road. "He said he knew it, and he was fine with it. He said he just wants us to be happy."
"Bravo, Castiel. Excellent performance. You know, you may be a better actor than me. And you know from experience, I'm very convincing."
"I know. I know how you see yourself, Dean. You see yourself the same way our enemies see you. You're destructive, and you're angry, and you're broken. You're 'daddy's blunt instrument.' And you think that hate and anger, that's... That's what drives you, that's who you are. It's not. And everyone who knows you see it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are. You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know." He smiled, fully crying now. "You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell... Knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam, I cared about Jack... I cared about the whole world because of you." He laughed sadly as a tear traced its way down his cheek. "You changed me, Dean."
"Nope." Dean stood up and grabbed his jacket. "Jack, Cas, we found a case. Might be gone for a couple of days. Let's go, Sammy."
Once the two were fully out of earshot, Dale turned to Jim. "Pay up, dude. No proof."
"Yeah, what did you find, Jack?" Dean tried to pretend like he heard him the first time.
"Sam and Dean were raised hunters, right? So I'm guessing they never got to have a real Halloween, or even eat candy when they were kids. And I'm guessing you didn't, either."
"Eileen Leahy?" Dale asked.
Dean could only sputter wordless noises for about five minutes.
Castiel started to fight back, and it looked like he had the upper hand at first, but the fight was a blur. In what felt like a second, Dean twisted Cas' arms behind his back, angel cuffs at the ready.
"Alright!" Jack jumped up. "Let's go!"
Castiel had made his mistakes. He'd killed so many of his brothers and sisters in Heaven, even more on Earth. But the Winchesters forgave him. They saved him.
"You say that like we weren't prepared for this." Cas pulled the Colt out of his trench coat - not the original, of course, but one Dean had made from studying the first for countless hours - and shot Kane in the forehead.
Dean broke his gaze. "I'm sorry."
"Ah, right. Funny story, actually. I noticed this old, rundown warehouse on the way into town, way far away from people. Long story short, we found out it was abandoned - huge red flag right there. We drove in, scoped the place out when Cas saw something through the windows."
"No problem." She paused for a minute. "Boys?"
"Okay, let's start with why you even trust this guy." Dean was pacing around the kitchen after Jack joined them. He had left Kane in the study and went to tell his "fathers" what they had talked about.
"Oh, I thought you 'didn't give a rat's ass about the side effects'," Rowena mocked, doing a pretty hilarious impression of Dean. "If you let me finish, you would know that galangal root is somewhat of a magical 'aphrodisiac', as you might call it. One of its uses is for promoting lust."
"That's for my brother, you dick." Dean stepped back, thinking it was over until Kane started laughing.
"What?" Dean tried to look like that concept was insane, but Cas could see through it. "Kid's crazy."
"You're in a good mood today, aren't you?" Mary observed.
Relax child, you were there
"Yeah, that sounds weird, but are you sure it's our kind of thing?"
"Pretty smart. Pretty smart, dummy."
Dean stiffened. "Oh, right. That. Look, Cas, I just don't want Jack to think I'm... you know, gay."
"Yes, I know. She gave me donkey ears. Laugh it up, Sammy."
Jack smiled. "I'm just doing what you guys taught me."
"Doctor, we understand, but we're in the middle of a murder investigation." Surprisingly, Jack was the one who said this. "If this woman was a victim of foul play, we must find the person responsible before they hurt anyone else."
"I love you, Cas."
"How did you find us? How did you even know who we are?" Jack sat down at one of the tables and pulled out another chair for Kane.
But why did the mere thought of doing that make him so nauseous?
"Ah." Kane slumped in his chair. "So you didn't get along."
"Come on, Dean," Garth accused. "You can't not wear a costume at your own costume party."
"Look, I was born on May twentieth, 1535. My father was a demon and my mum was a witch. I'm a cambion."
"Okay, I'll try not to tell him."
"Jack, it's nine o'clock. Time to wake up. We're on a case, remember?" Cas tried to gently shake Jack's shoulder, but eventually, he just picked the whole boy up and lifted him to a standing position.
