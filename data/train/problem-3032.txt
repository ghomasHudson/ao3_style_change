Castiel took Dean’s hands and kissed his cheek. “I’m really glad that we’re okay. I don’t know if I could ever lose you. You’re too precious to me.”
“Mmm, probably getting drunk at the bar. It’s okay, he has a short temper, but when he’s at an event like this, he’s the most charming man you’ll ever meet, no matter how drunk he is. He can lay it on you when he wants to.” Castiel’s voice was bitter and his lip twitched slightly.
Castiel’s brows furrowed in hesitation, drawing back slightly. His gaze finally moved away from Dean to ponder what to do. “Okay. Stay there until I’m back in my room. There’s some oatmeal and granola bars in the pantry. A few of those would be nice.” He swallowed. “Thank you.” His eyes met Dean’s again. That piercing stare cut into Dean’s soul like a knife. It made his knees feel weak and his heart beat faster.
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s waist from behind and kissed his shoulder. “I know. It was surreal for me when she was born. I didn’t believe it at first.”
“It’s nothing to get nervous over. I won’t leave your side the whole time. You won’t have to do much of the talking if you don’t want to.”
Sure enough, right after Jimmy left, Castiel emerged from his room. He was freshly showered and in a t-shirt and sweats.
Castiel nods and takes a deep breath, calming himself down. He looks at Dean, who is still quietly standing to the side. “Dean, I’m sorry. I was trying to save your life.”
Dean moaned, the feeling of someone else’s fingers being so much better than his own. Castiel seemed to be an expert too, which made sense, given that he had probably done this to himself a hundred times during his heats. Fuck, what Dean would give to see that for himself.
Dean nodded. “That’s not a bad idea. That might be nice.” He met Castiel’s eyes. “I love you, and I’m sorry.”
Things took a massive turn when an omega woman approached him, two and a half years after he left the Milton house, asking about Luke. Her name was Kelly Kline. She had briefly dated him a few months ago, and was now pregnant with his kid. Luke said to get back to him when it was time for him to pay child support and was refusing to help her until then.
Castiel looked at Dean with a smile. “I love you too.” He kissed Dean’s cheek. Once the water was warm, he plugged the drain and helped Dean into the tub. He slid in behind him, his legs around Dean’s waist.
With nothing better to do, Castiel decides to go buy groceries. He gets back into his car, a little blue Prius, and drives to the grocery store. He stocks up on all the basics, including his favorite snacks. He hopes that his roommate will be there when he gets back, because he’s been anxious to meet him for months now.
“I know. But if you have a heat now, it’ll guarantee that it doesn’t happen on our wedding day, or our honeymoon right after. I talked to Castiel before coming up. He said that he would help you if you wanted him to.”
Dean gasped at the tightening of muscles around his cock and moaned as he came, his thighs shaking slightly from exertion.
After dinner, Castiel goes to his room to get ready for Gabriel’s New Year’s Eve party. For this party, no one wants to be designated driver, so they decided to bring sleeping bags to camp out on Gabriel’s living room floor. Castiel doesn’t have a sleeping bag, but Dean offers to lend him one for tonight.
Cas shook his head. “You can’t control your physical health, and I happen to enjoy your company, so it’s no bother to me.”
Castiel shrugged. “It’s been more than five years. I’m sure things have changed with both of us. We could start over. It would be weird to jump right back in. We could go on dates and take it slow. However you want to.”
Dean accepts Castiel’s hand, holding it tightly. “I don’t know. I just...I can’t lose you, Cas. I’ve already lost you a few times, and it’s too much. If we do this, I really won’t be able to lose you.”
“Oh, right, you don’t know. Cas is the adoptive father of Luke’s kid, Jack. Luke knocked up some poor girl who died in childbirth, and Castiel adopted the baby. He’s two now.”
Dr. Adler stands up, pushing the chair back in. “Not bad, per say, just not where it was before. Has something been going on?”
“I’m sorry to hear that about your parents, but it’s extremely admirable of you to have taken care of your little brother.” Michael ran his fingers through Dean’s hair. “He’s going to Stanford, isn’t he? You raised a smart one.”
Dean decided to retreat to his room for a shower of his own. He felt way more confident with all the knobs now. He even figured out the massage setting, which was glorious.
Castiel paused in thought, rinsing out his mouth. He rested his hands on the counter, quietly contemplating. “Okay. I want you there. We’ll start with no touch, and if I’m okay, we can do anything.”
Dean shakes his head. “If that’s what you want, I’m out. If you’re an angel, you’re immortal from my knowledge. You’ll never age, you’ll never die. I’ll get old and die and you’ll still be here. Why would you ever want that?”
“Dean, an Uber from the Atlanta airport to Athens through rush hour traffic is going to cost you nearly a hundred dollars. I can drive you for free. He’ll have to wait at the airport longer, but it’ll save you money.”
Dean nods, a small frown on his face. “Jo’s dad died while hunting. Ellen, her mom, used to be a hunter. She stopped once she had Jo. The Roadhouse is always full of hunters. We should go sometime. It’s the only part of Georgia that I know and it’s super pretty.”
“I will. You should still get a paternity test. It would probably guarantee that you get full custody of her in court.”
After a minute or so, Cas rocks back and forth a few times. He opens his eyes to look at Dean as he raises himself up and lowers himself back down achingly slowly. “For now, don’t move.”
Gabriel, Ash, Jo, Charlie, and Meg are all staring at Castiel and Dean with wide eyes. The room is silent save for the music and Castiel’s giggles.
Dean hums, lips curled into a proud smile. “He’s done a lot of research and I’m sure he’ll tell you all about it if you ask.”
Dean unlocked the door and pushed it open slowly. He peeked inside and didn’t see Castiel in the living room or kitchen. He closed the door, and then he heard something. Loud sobs were coming from upstairs. The guilt pooled low in Dean’s belly, eating him from the inside out.
Over the weekend, both of them are too exhausted from finals week to do much. They spend Saturday and Sunday lounging around and napping.
Dean’s eyebrows perked up a little at the mention of an open bar, but went back down when Michael said he could have only one drink. Oh well. “Okay, sounds good.” He closed his eyes when Michael scratched gently at the base of his hairline. Out of nowhere, he started purring.
Dean wasn’t very inclined to believe Luke. He was an excellent liar and Dean had seen it in person. “What? Why?”
Suddenly, his tinnitus flares up. It starts off not so bad. He moves a hand to his head and rubs it, willing the ringing to stop. Slowly, it gets louder and louder. The volume of the ringing cranks up in his head and he presses both hands to his ears, face twisting in pain. He can’t even hear Dean trying to talk to him. He can barely feel Dean’s hands on him.
Meg was already a little scary at times, but Ruby was on another level. She had the kind of attitude that told you that she wasn’t afraid to cut you down if you got in her way. She never seemed to like Castiel very much, so whenever he came over Ruby would either disappear or stare at him until he left the room. It was creepy.
Dean didn’t want to press too hard, but the change was intriguing, and he was worried. “Your scent changed. I think it’s…cedarwood?”
Castiel leans against Dean and waits for the voices to pass. He squeezes his eyes shut and tries to relax. A few minutes pass and the voices start to calm back down again. Castiel opens his eyes and looks up at Dean. “They’re going away.”
Dean got into Baby, double checking that the garage was closed as he drove away. Part of him was nervous about leaving Jack alone in his house all day, but the kid seemed nervous and relatively harmless.
“He just...won’t let me leave.” Dean took a deep breath and checked his phone again. “I have to go. My ride is gonna be here.”
“Not much. Our scent profiles are supposed to match, he lives in Chicago with his two brothers, he’s got dark hair, blue eyes, about my height, I think.”
Castiel starts on his hashbrowns, adding some ketchup to them. “I had a craving for it today. It’s been awhile since I’ve eaten here.” He shovels a forkful of hashbrowns into his mouth.
Michael nods and pulls an angel blade from his jacket. “I understand. If you ever reconsider, you know how to contact me.” He steps forward and tilts Castiel’s head back. He nicks the center of his neck and holds a vial up to it.
Castiel hadn’t put much thought into how attractive Dean was, until now. Dean is someone that’s just Castiel’s type. He’s charming, funny, and he looks the part too. His freckles are adorable, and his sandy brown hair is fluffed up perfectly all the time.
“Sounds easy enough.” Dean scooted forwards and looked at the mess of feathers in front of him. He pulled out a couple twigs and leaves, tossing them aside. Once they were gone, he ran his fingers through the feathers, his eyes wide when he felt how soft and silky they were. He mindlessly kept going, brushing through all of the feathers on the backs of Castiel’s wings. Feathers fell to the bed, leaving the rest of the wing shining.
Dean felt kind of bad that Jack was scared of him. As much as being around him made him uneasy, he was still a kid. During the drive home, Dean tried to talk to him. “So, what do you remember?”
Dean shook his head. “He had already drawn his own conclusion that I just didn’t want you there because you’re my friend and it was getting too awkward to handle.”
The voices start to quiet down, making it easier for Castiel to speak. “It starts with ringing in my ears, and then I hear voices. They’re demanding that I come home, or that I come to them. They shout my name over and over. It comes and goes. It gets loud sometimes, and sometimes they just whisper.”
At 2am, Dean woke up to the feeling of slick moving down his thighs and whined. Castiel was awake and ready within a minute.
Dean nodded and opened the door. “He’s in the spare bedroom, just back there. I’m making dinner for him now.”
Dean rests his elbows on the table and his chin in his hands as he watches Castiel. “You’re gonna be a great professor one day. I can already picture you doing it.”
Jack started to come out from behind Castiel, peeking around his legs and trying to see into the bag. “Train?”
Inside is a studio apartment with huge windows lining the back wall. There’s a small kitchen, a couch with a TV in front of it, and a big, comfy-looking bed that almost resembles a nest of pillows and blankets.
Castiel hums. “I think my grace has decided that you’re my mate, so I suppose that’s where we start.”
Dean nodded. “Yeah, sure.” He stood up and followed Michael upstairs. Dean glanced back at the other side of the hall and saw Luke’s door open with the light’s off, and Castiel’s door closed, the lights shining through the bottom of the door. He forced himself to turn away and walked into Michael’s bedroom. He sat on the bed and yawned softly. It was only 8pm, but he was tired. Snuggling up to someone sounded nice. Michael was a good cuddler.
Dean pulled the mask off in mild annoyance. “I feel gross.” He heard the voices outside of the room getting louder. “What’s going on?”
Dean obeys the command without question. Somehow, it’s so easy to do what Cas says. Instead of feeling controlled, he feels safe and secure. In a time where he’s very unsure, the commands settle him and give him confidence in what he’s doing.
Castiel nods and starts gathering his things. “Yeah, British Literature. I like this class a lot. It’s my last one of the day and then I can go home.” He swings his bag over his shoulder. “Good luck with your studying. See you later.”
“Yeah, yeah I’m good. Just tired, I guess.” Dean rubbed his face and sat down on the edge of the bed.
Castiel looked at the address anxiously. “I really hope that boy is okay. He sounded very young from the description we got.”
They ended up curled on the couch, Dean cry laughing -or was that laugh crying ?- in her neck, babbling some nonsense about
After running a hand on his sleepy face, he scrolled through his short contact list until he found Bobby Singer.
It almost worked out with the guy that was really into board games, but Cassie went so competitive he forgot it was a date and jumped so hard when the dude tried to kiss him that he felt off his chair.
Dean went from zero to one hundred real fucking quick, grabbed Mr. Accountant by the sleeve and dragged him away.
Also...I'm very proud to say I've finished writing this fic. I planned 19 chapters, just as for the two previous parts, but it didn't worked the way I hoped. So I stopped at 17 chapters, because it makes much more sense with the story and I'll keep what I wrote after as a timestamp for later !
First, he didn’t have the energy. Second, well…he wanted to preserve a bit of his dignity. And explaining that he literally went on a date with the wrong person without noticing was far from dignifying. Dean wasn’t even sure he figured it all out at the moment and now, through the near-death experience, it was really hard to do so.
He extended his hand while offering a warm smile, since his brother raised him well. Said brother must have lost all his manners through the years ‘cause he literally kicked Sam’s hand away. Okayyy, so apparently being polite to Mr. Accountant was forbidden.
He never handled his feelings well, that didn’t change through the years. Keeping everything at distance, whether it was good or bad, was a protective reflex he had. No need to have a psychology PhD to understand that.
“You’re going like this ?” Benny asked, frowning. He was leaning against the doorframe of his spare room while his childhood friend was lacing his boots, sat on the edge of the bed. He had never imagined Dean putting on a suit for a job interview but that was… well. That was very casual.
Despite her obvious effort to repress it, a series of giggles escaped Donna’s mouth. Meanwhile, the fainted memory of a very, very, very graphic comic book came back into Dean’s mind and he felt a burning heat creep on his neck and face. Shit. That was like 25 five years ago, how could she even… Missouri wasn’t letting go. Her eyes bored into Dean. He shifted nervously and after an awfully long moment, all he could managed was a pitiful “Sorry, Ma’am”
Dean was putting away what must have been carving tools and wiping the coffee table. Repressing a smile, Castiel raised an eyebrow at the already very neat and clean living-room, which was apparently not up to Dean’s standards of tidiness.
The room was a bit dark, with the walls and the floor covered in weathered wood. The deep red leather seats were all cracked, the varnish of their table was flaky, and Castiel casted his eyes on posters of cars and old post card pinned behind the counter. He frowned :
Her eyes wandered on Sam. She knew he was now married and already had two kids but whenever she saw him, she was reminded of the lanky teenager that was following his older brother everywhere, back when her own mother was running the business. However, he was probably the one that changed the most. There was the heigh, but also the shadow of beard and the hair. God, the hair. Dean didn’t change that much, neither did she.
Dean watched Castiel cut a very generous slice of the damn pie and hold it out to him. No. Nope. The last time he barely survived three bites of that abomination.
Oh, that was awkward. Even for him. Castiel did not deal well with uneasy. He started to feel a bit paranoid. Why would Janice lie to him ? That didn’t make any sense. He chose his words very carefully and spoke even slower than usual.
It was definitely an angry look on his face when he straightened out of the car. A really angry one. Probably-not-Cam shoved a box into his arms and started stacking them. Dean couldn’t see his face anymore but he could hear him very well, abrupt tone and all.
He glanced at his brother. Castiel was rolling his eyes, that was a good sign. Balthazar could read Castiel like an open book since they were kids. They each had their role : Castiel being serious, stiff and clueless to the world, while Balthazar was overly energetic, witty and careless. He never dragged his brother away from of one of his gloomy episodes by being nice. Maybe someone could do it, but not him. So, he sticked to his script.
Castiel quickly gripped the handle of the pan and dropped the whole thing into the sink, burned pancake and all. Gathering his thoughts about
Castiel gives himself an internal pep talk. He'll do very well this time. Everything will be alright.
The pie that got out of the bag was so familiar his stomach turned a bit inside out. Castiel was beaming when he slid it on a paper plate.
Eileen laughed. She was always fond of Dean, even if she couldn’t say why exactly. Maybe it was because she could see him through Sam’s eyes, but not only. She knew firsthand Dean was an invested big brother, even if he wasn’t perfect. She always could read him like a book, and he kind of let her do that. He let her, probably because even if he knew that she knew, she never forced her opinions, advices or anything on him. She just had to look at him. Dean had a rough shell, but he was helpless if someone were really soft with him. That guy needed more soft people around, it could do wonder to him.
That meeting was no less hard than the ones before and he didn’t even try to stop drinking yet. But when he left the building and checked his phone, he had a text from Sam. A picture, no caption, but it meant more than a thousand words.
Two minutes passed; their eyes focused on the screen without seeing anything. She cleared her throat.
Ok, the dude was good looking. But he was also weird as hell. He was going to church, he had fucking bees in his garden. And he owned a trench coat. That he wore. Like all the time.
A little out of breath, Dean realized he was running out of negatives things about Cas way faster than he was about the positive things. So he switched for his very own trial. At least he was sure he would never run out of reproaches against himself.
Yet Dean still looked like a deer caught in headlights, shifting, taking a step toward the car, then back again.
Maneuvering someone like Dean onto the couch wasn’t easy for a girl her size, but thankfully, emotional Dean was way more compliant than the usual one. She retrieved the takeout bag and fished out all the paper towels, just in case. Her friend seemed to have recovered a bit of lucidity but he was still holding to his phone like it was his only lifeline. Jo sat on the floor beside the coffee table and started to eat her fries. As happy as she was for the Winchesters, she was starving.
” through his life. People said they were sorry all the time but it was only to be polite and to keep a good conscience. Their fucking “
Balthazar tried to ignore his brother pig-headed face and started the engine. He clamed up for the first five minutes of the drive, barely glancing at his passenger. When Cassie’s shoulder seemed to relax a bit, probably under the false impression that Balthazar was really trying to help him escape without any ulterior motive, he launched the attack.
Less than an hour later, the oven was hot and he held her up very cautiously so she could slide the dish inside.
He was sliding his phone in his back pocket when a colorful flag garland fell from upstairs, right in front of his feet. After picking it on the floor, he looked up at the staircase and saw Cas’ head looking down at him, above the railing of the second floor.
How much did he drink to be in such a terrible state ? She found herself helpless. It was the wrong time to talk about it, obviously, so she just poured some water into a glass, grabbed a towel and sit beside him, her hand stroking his back drenched of cold sweat.
Balthazar pinched his nose and tried to compose himself an amenable and innocent face. It took him a good five minutes, during which he heard Cassie washing the dishes with an aggressivity that was not usual for him.
Well, Sammy chatted lazily. Dean, on the other hand, spent the whole hour extremely focused, trying to avoid talking about Cas. That was stupid. It’s not like he even wanted to
Dean wasn’t aware that one could talk almost fondly about someone’s flaws but here they were. And that was weirdly working ? Apparently, he was now getting off on criticism. How insane was that ? And how insane was that Cas could say the right thing when even himself had no idea what the right thing could have been ? Cas smiled softly and shrugged.
Jo would be dead in one hour; he swore to God. Only pervs were using dating apps, he knew it, he told her and he was damn right. If she had some weird kinks and wanted to use those, good for her. But he’d rather not fucking ever again than going through all that shit.
She didn’t even offer to help : Dean would have rather deal with everything, his two hands tied in his back, than let her do anything.
Jody waved it away and turned to Jack, ignoring Meg who was the worst at taking notes, probably because she didn’t want to be asked to. “Jack, I know you never did it but there is a first for everything. Garth will help you, that’s okay Garth ?”
Ten minutes later, Dean was wearing a jacket over his t-shirt and he traded his boots for a much classier pair from Benny. “Can I go now ?” He threw Benny an irritated look.
Castiel felt a bit self-conscious when he realized that Janice probably told everyone she knew about him looking for someone. Even if it was more like her looking for someone for him.
No, this guy looked more like a random country dude, he was also wearing a concert tshirt but at least she knew the name of the band.
Everything’s fine, don’t worry. The dude is funny and seems quick-witted, I showed him around, gave him a little briefing. He’s in his office with Charlie, I think they’re doing all the settings for his computer…
Why would this one be different ? The salary wasn’t extraordinary, the position wasn’t especially exciting and the building, from what he saw on Google Street, wasn’t brand new.
I believe you'll get your money worth (unless you don't like disastrous (but delighful) situations. If that's your case, then I'm very sorry you happen to be here.)
Dean felt a sparkle of hope in the middle of the disjointed rambling poured in his ears. Maybe he wasn’t the only one with a nosy friend with a tendency to overstep boundaries.
I felt like I put all existant emotions, good or bad, in a jar and shook really hard. Please enjoy this weird cocktail and let me know about it in a comment, I'd be delighted ♥
They went running too, Dean was struggling at first, out of breath after 10 minutes on the trail. She never cut him any slack, making fun of him, being noisy and annoying, showing at his doorstep every other day, never letting him give up. Apparently, it was what he needed, cause after a few weeks she found him ready and warning up every time. He became more and more competitive and clearly enjoyed it, even if he pretended she was a pain in his ass and running was lame.
Hey there ! For the first time I needed an outside point of vue, so this chapter is from an OC. I felt a bit off about it, since I'm only using it in this chapter and won't do it again. It's like it doesn't fit with the rest of the story ? I don't know... Please let me know what you think about it !
And as a thanks, Sam rejected him and forbid him to see the family he wouldn’t even have if it weren’t Dean’s making. God, his brother was right, he was a piece of shit.
At first, the girls were wary and shy, clinging at their uncle and turning their heads every time they met with Castiel’s eyes. But when they discovered that he could provide honey biscuits and had the magical ability to touch the cats without scaring them to death -the secret was to not put some fingers into their ears- they opened up.
Ten feet away from the buffet, Castiel was congratulating himself on how his coat were doing a particularly good job at fusing him into the beige wall. When the familiar sound of nails clicking on a glass ringed on his left ear, followed by a very friendly “
Castiel went and washed his hands thoroughly, the question burning his tongue. After a minute of awkward silence, Dean leaned on the counter, looked at the fridge and crossed his arms.
He parked the car and stayed inside for a good five minutes. From where he was, he could see Sam, sitting outside, fidgeting with his glass, his phone, his sunglasses, while looking nervously all around, looking for his brother. His heart sunk a little in his chest.
Admitting out loud it was the first time he did this was not an option. Cas seemed more like a misfit than a dangerous guy but it would make Dean feel lessened in some way he hated. Even if he knew it was stupid, he couldn’t shake the feeling away.
He was awaiting a guy a bit like himself, not really talkative, a bit in a rush, but willing and strong. He thought there would be some king of electricity, or whatever. He never expected a coffee and a walk around the fair, trying tediously to make conversation. Cas seemed to be fine talking for both of them, by the way. The guy must be nice but like…dog-nice. Those eyes were beautiful but a bit too puppy-like. His smile was nice too, or at least Dean could guess it was nice when he wasn’t so nervous. But that wasn’t enough.
Twenty minutes later, they were both parked in Dean’s driveway, Castiel sat on the steps, trying not to be a burden while Dean was checking on his car.
Castiel looked at his hands and the sleeves of his shirt, stained all the way up the elbows. At least it wasn’t a new one. He tried to act as casual as he could when he followed Dean inside, rolling up his sleeves while observing everything inside, now that he was allowed to come in. He stopped in front of the fridge, intrigued by childish drawings and pictures. Two ridiculously cute little girls, eating ice creams. A baby on Dean’s shoulders at the beach. And the two little girls, again, with a very pregnant woman. He only went through half of the pictures when Dean cleared his throat. He was waiting, six feet before him, holding out a nail brush, the water already running.
It wasn’t an easy ride. Some moments were harder and the whole thing remained flimsy but time would fix that, they said. Besides a few hiccups, he hung on.
Speaking of dignity, Dean suddenly realized he bluntly told the dude he was attending an AA meeting. And that Cas didn’t even flinch.
Maybe just grabbing a coffee for starter. And walk around the fair. There was a lot to see and to talk about, that should do it. That was it. Coffee. Walking. Discovering the stalls. What could go wrong ?
”, she got to help on almost everything, including slicing the apples. Dean helped mostly with reading the numbers on the scale and used his big uncle muscles to mix the dough when Allison’s little arms were tired.
After two months of this back and forth, the longing became unsufferable. He didn’t dare to call nor to text. It seemed weird. The captionless pictures communication worked well but it felt so fragile at the same time. On a Sunday, he drove the hour to Dean’s city and send a picture of his favorite burger restaurant with his wristwatch in sight. He sat at a table outside, nervously taping the wooden table.
The most enjoyable thing was to be able to recognize her friend again in the man that was in front of her. She didn’t realize before he got better, that she really thought she had lost him for good.
He chuckled lightly and took the two mugs to the sink, probably to hide the redness creeping on his face. Eileen stretched her legs and got up, giving him a pat on the back as she walked past him on her way to the girls.
His eyes rolled so hard it hurt a bit. Why was he always the one opening the library ? The first patrons were always the jobless/retired/socially awkward ones who had absolutely nothing to do but wait for the library to open, so they could bust his balls. Ash looked for a piece of paper, couldn’t find one and grabbed a book on a trolley. Who needed those blank pages at the end anyway ? He taped the “GET YOURSELF A WATCH” note to the back of his computer screen and sat back to his chair.
His feet on the reception desk, Ash was looking through the glass door twenty feet ahead, to the guy desperately waving at him. He shook his head while articulated slowly “Five more minutes !!!” and showed his watch. Ugh, those patrons were the worst.
It took all Jody’s willpower not to roll her eyes. Not only she was almost sure that traffic was the least of Chuck’s problems, but also it was highly improbable that he sent a text to let them know. Donna was just kind enough to cover for him. She sighted : one problem at a time.
And just like that, the conversation died. Castiel kept his hands folded on his lap and looked outside the window, wondering why he was on his way for an outing with someone who would obviously rather be anywhere but here. The most annoying thing was that if they fought again, he would have to call Balthazar to come and get him, and he would never hear the end of it.
It was a dark blue bag, there was nothing specific about it, except that he belonged to her new coworker and desk-neighbor, who was nowhere to be found. Donna was probably giving him a tour of the library. She could have googled the guy eons ago, when Jody mentioned his name at the team meeting, but that would have been creepy… Ash-level-creepy, even. After a sigh, she shook her head and focused on her task. Well, she tried to focus. Her eyes were scanning the entrance of the room and she yelled an enthusiastic “WELCOME NEW GUYYYY !” the second she saw a shadow moving in her peripheral vision.
Already back into the motor, Dean shrugged and a wave of guilt rushed over Castiel, who drank the lemonade as quickly as possible, got up, took off his coat and walked toward the car.
Dean’s hands finally moved on the keyboard and after a little silence he cracked a smile and asked “Is that how you call weeding here ?”
And with those very rude last words, Dean ate a forkful of pie. Castiel’s eyes were fixed on him, hopeful, waiting for him to swallow and say something. Apparently, it was a bit optimistic to hope that Dean would wait for his mouth to be empty before talking.
Cas pushed a big jar toward him and Dean looked at the golden syrupy thing inside. He had to bite his cheeks to refrain himself from saying that Cas did have a bee kink, in some way. Dean reached out to take it and made the effort to look into Cas’s eyes when he cracked a bashful smile.
He followed Dean’s steps inside and sat in front of him in a booth. It was quiet, no one would come there in the middle of the afternoon just to eat a snack. The place was probably packed around lunch time and on the evenings.
Sam even invited him to come home and see the kids, two weeks ago. Old habits die hard, Dean instantly opened his mouth to refuse with a false pretext. Then he shut it. Opened it again. Well, new Dean was maybe better than the old one but he would never be one to talk openly about his feelings and he struggled to find words he was comfortable to say without lying.
He ran so fast outside he nearly fell on the hood of the Impala. Through the drenched windshield, Sam could see a blurred version of his brother looking at him, the hand still on the opened car door. They stayed there, starring at each other, Dean froze behind the steering wheel while Sam was getting drenched under the rain. None of them move, and it was the answer at the question he didn’t even asked yet.
The air seemed to shimmer around him, and Castiel felt her presence before he saw her. Brighid. Rare were the times she appeared to him. He bowed his head. "Faithful One, go. He needs you. He will need you forever." When his head came up, she was gone. Chara whined. Castiel turned and churned his way through the snow. Dean needed him.
Cas took Dean's hand and wrapped it around his own cock, then Cas took his own cock in his hand. "Hey, Cas, I know how to jack off...shouldn't my hand be on your junk?"
"She wasn't just a piece of ass. I thought I..." Dean didn't finish the sentence. You didn't talk to John Winchester about loving someone. "She was a nice girl."
"Damn." Dean watched the white clouds for a moment before turning to Cas. "Just how powerful are they?"
"Son of a bitch." The shout startled both of them. Castiel turned wide eyes to Dean. He was standing in the door to the store. Gun drawn and aimed.
Dean was so intent on his criticism of himself, he missed the soft whup whup of wings announcing Castiel’s return to the motel room. Castiel stood silently, frowning in confusion as Dean poked and prodded himself.
Movement brought his attention down to Cas' cock. Cas was stroking himself, using his own arousal to wet his hand. His rhythm faltered at the sight, but Cas' growl brought him back to the task. He slammed into Cas, the feeling in his belly getting hotter...white heat...Dean cried out as the supernova exploded behind his eyes. He emptied himself into Cas and the sudden realization that there was no barrier made his eyes snap to Cas'. The witch's eyes blazed with heat. Cas seemed to buzz with electricity. "I felt you, Dean. You. Only you." The evidence of Cas' completion was in thick, white lines on his taut stomach.
"You are very welcome," Castiel said, before turning to stoke the fire. He'd be leaving soon and wanted it to stay warm for Dean. "When did you eat last?"
He pushed and prodded again, feeling the give of the soft flesh under his fingers. He turned and looked at himself from every angle, noting with abject disgust he appeared to have love handles when looking at himself from the back.
Castiel sat up against the headboard; while, Dean puttered around the kitchen. Pierce was mewling and rubbing against Dean's legs. "You...I'm not talking to you this morning. Watching like that...it's perverted...okay, maybe just kinky. Your daddy needs to think seriously about getting you a boyfriend." Once Dean had the stove going and the eggs cooking along with some of the thick cut bacon Castiel got from Benny's store, he opened a can of tuna and dumped it in the cat's bowl. Castiel would have been happy to watch Dean all day long just moving around Castiel's cabin and making it his own.
Castiel took Benny's hand and brought it to his neck, knowing he could feel Castiel's pulse with his fingertips. Benny growled and Castiel saw his fangs drop. "Drink."
Dean gave the vampire a brisk nod. "Sammy, look, rent a car and take 220 south for..." He looked at Benny for direction. Instead of giving Dean the information, he held out his hand for the phone. Reluctantly, Dean handed it over.
"I trust you, Dean," Castiel whispered. He was the first to look away. He went back to his mixing, but he was very aware of Dean taking the book over to the bed. He heard the flare of a match being struck and from the corner of his eye, he saw Dean make himself comfortable against the headboard.
"Stay with me, Dean." Castiel called on every ounce of strength he had and picked up Dean in a fireman's carry, the hunter's body slung over his back. Castiel gripped Dean's legs and arms and trudged home. Once inside, Castiel let Dean fall to the bed. He stripped him of Castiel's winter gear and growled when he realized Dean was almost nude under the coat. Just those damn pajama pants covered his lower half. He moved quickly to gather what he needed. Whispering the spell for warmth, he annointed Dean's body with the oil again. Pierce, sensing his panic, wrapped herself around Dean's head. Her body heat would help.
He nearly jumped out of his skin when he felt Cas' hand on his ass. "Dean, look at me." Dean pulled his face out of the quilt and looked back. Cas was sitting on his heels, looking all cute with his head tilted. He held out his hand. After a second's hesitation, Dean rolled to his side and took it. "The first time we have sex, it won't be like that."
Castiel tilted his head and touched his lips to Dean's. He vowed that Dean would always know the power of his love, and he sent his thoughts through the kiss. While chaste, he knew Dean could feel the hum of Castiel's very core. They pulled back, mere inches, eyes holding. "I love you, Dean."
"Listen Broomhilda, the Goddess didn't have a damn thing to do with Cas and me falling for each other. As far as I'm concerned, I don't need ribbons, robes, and dancing fairies to prove to Cas that I love him and want to spend the rest of my life with him."
With the dim light from a waning moon, Castiel drove the powerful machine carefully. He took a quicker route since he didn't have to stay on the roads or trails. They flew over the snow, the bouncing making Dean whoop and Castiel could hear laughter behind him. It made him smile.
Dean sat on the bed and pulled Cas down beside him. He went over Bobby's plan. "So, I'll still have to travel some; and maybe, you could come with me."
“We’re married now, Dean. And it’s our wedding night.” Michael smiled, closing the distance between them again by taking a step forward, but keeping his hands off for now.
Dean scrubbed his body raw in the shower. When he emerged, he stared at himself in the mirror for a few minutes. He redressed himself and exited the bathroom. Castiel was picking up all of the feathers and depositing them into the small trash can.
Dean stayed quiet as he started to cook, making five plates of hash browns and eggs. Michael and Gabriel informed him on how everyone liked their eggs done. Michael wanted his poached, but when Dean looked nervous about it, he changed his answer to over-easy. Gabriel wanted scrambled, Luke liked them over-medium, and Castiel wanted them scrambled with a little extra salt.
Meg stares at Castiel for a few seconds, searching for something in his face. “Alright.” She looks at the time on her phone. “Let’s go get dinner. I’m starving.”
Dean did his best to remain calm. If he seemed too anxious, the driver would probably say something to Michael, which would blow the whole plan.
Castiel took the sheets of paper with a smile. “Not at all. I like editing.” He pulls a pen out of his backpack and starts reading over what Dean had written.
Dean put on a smile. “You’re gonna love California. You still have a phone and you can text me anytime. I don’t do much, as you’ve seen, so I’ll answer at all hours when I can.” He ate a french fry out of his fast food bag, which was mostly untouched. He didn’t feel like eating much. His stomach turned at the idea of eating that whole burger.
“When I presented, everyone thought I was an omega. It started like a heat, but then things changed. I popped a knot.” He took a deep breath. “I’m intersex, in terms of my secondary sex. That’s why my family threw me out. They didn’t want me anymore.”
Sure enough, Michael proposed that night, and Castiel saw the evidence the next day on Dean’s ring finger.
Cas took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. “Still, there’s a chance.” He sighed and shook his head. “You know what? No, we’re not going to worry about this right now. There’s nothing we can do. We did what we wanted to. We shouldn’t repeat this particular arrangement, but we can do anything else. This is supposed to be our last hurrah, so let’s try not to worry about anything else right now.”
Castiel smiled, but his face looked strained. “I’m about to go home. Luke wants to leave. I just wanted to say I’m so happy for you.”
Dean barks out a laugh. “You and me both, Cas.” He continues straight and drums his fingers against the steering wheel. “So, tell me more about yourself. I feel like you haven’t told me anything juicy.”
As Dean looked over his current cases, he realized that things were a little slow right now. A lot of cases were either thrown out from too little evidence, or had already gone to court. Now would be a good time to go looking for the Nephilim, if that’s what they ended up doing. There were a few things that would have to be settled. Jack would have to stay somewhere else if Dean left. Jody could probably take him. She already had two adopted daughters.
Dean watched as Michael left, having no idea what he said he wanted to eat. He searched the menu for a dish name that looked anything like what Michael just said. He was pretty sure he found it, but now he had to figure out what the menu said. Dean knew nothing about French food. He couldn’t read a word on the menu. When the waiter came by, he ordered Michael’s wine. When the server asked if he wanted the house, Dean just nodded and ordered water for himself. He pulled out his phone and started using google translate to figure out what the different dishes were.
Jody shook her head. “Nope. We kept him here overnight. He's still in a holding cell. He remembers his own name, Jack, so that’s what we’re calling him.”
Castiel got into bed and started to put his head on his pillow, but paused when Dean gestured for him to come over. He scooted over closer to Dean and put his head in his lap. “Do you promise that we’ll talk as soon as I’m awake?”
Castiel took a deep breath and nodded. “Same goes for you and Jack. It might be easier since he’s still so young.”
Dean blushed deeply. No one had ever described his scent like that before. “Thanks...Do you need help getting upstairs? Should I contact Luke? Actually, scratch the last part. I don’t know how to contact anyone.”
Dean broke eye contact for a moment. “I was wondering if um...Would you want to go out sometime soon? Like a date?”
Castiel walks into Meg’s apartment and thanks whatever god there may be that Ruby isn’t there. Meg leads him back to her room and instructs him to sit on her desk chair. Once he’s sitting, Meg starts laying into him.
Silence fell over the two. There was too much to say and they both knew there wasn’t enough time to say it. Dean pushed Claire on the swings for a while too. She was too energetic to stay still for long. She had big blue eyes and a head of blonde waves. She looked a lot like Dean in the face.
Castiel’s cheeks were red, but he went along with what Dean was doing. His hands moved to Dean’s hips. “You know, this isn’t very platonic. I’m not sure ‘bros’ do this.”
Pamela tilted her head. “Well, what you need is to be able to ‘finish’ in a timely manner to satisfy the needs of your heat so you cool down. If you think you’d be able to with just the presence of another person, that’s definitely something to try. A scent that calms you down could also be very beneficial.”
Castiel takes the time he spends outside of Dean’s door thinking about his decision. He has no idea when Zachariah or Naomi will come for him. In the meantime, the voices aren’t bothering him as much. Even when he hears them, he doesn’t freak out. He knows what they are now, so they don’t scare him as much. He knows he’s not crazy now.
Dean nodded in agreement, his fingers toying with a string on the hem of his shirt. “You’re right, we probably just made a weird connection during my heat, and it’ll stop once we don’t have to do that anymore.” Rationalizing his feelings that way hurt, but it was also comforting in a strange way. Maybe it meant that this wouldn’t be so hard to give up.
Despite their agreement, things between Castiel and Dean were weird. They would occasionally forget about the agreement and stare for a little too long, or hug the other from behind. Both cases were abruptly stopped once one of them realized what they were doing. It was awkward at times, and neither of them really knew what to do about it. They were stuck in the same house together, alone all day. The options were polite company or solitude. Dean wanted to be around Castiel, even if it could only be platonic. He would take his company over hours upon hours of solitude all day.
Dean drives them downtown and leads the way into the restaurant. The banter starts immediately, and the evening is similar to the night at Waffle House. They talk about anything and everything, and smiles never leave their faces. It’s a perfect date, one that Castiel knows he’ll commit to memory forever.
“Because it’s illegal to hold someone against their will and I’m pretty sure he’s too much of a goody-two-shoes to ever do anything illegal.”
“Yeah, figured it was time.” Dean sets his bags down on the counter, careful not to bother Castiel’s cooking.
Castiel was curled up in their bed, facing away from Dean, and crying into a pillow. Dean had seen Castiel get sniffly a few times during a movie, and he cried that one time when reliving his trauma, but this was on a new level. Castiel was choking and coughing as he cried. It was heartbreaking to see.
“It’s not too nosy. I found my twin, Jimmy. It was really hard to see him in the state he was in, but I was able to convince him to get help. He went into rehab and he’s nearly three years clean now. He got his GED and he’s in school now to be an accountant.”
Michael had the entire week they spent there planned out perfectly. They stayed in a beach house, which Dean really didn’t want to know the cost of. Dean spent most of his time lounging on the beach and wading in the water. It was quiet except for the ocean breeze and the waves lapping at the shore. Michael would sit with Dean until he had to work for a couple hours, then he’d return.
“With you. Saying the kiss was an accident was a real dick move on my part. I can imagine that it sucked for you. You got all quiet and avoided me all weekend.”
“Good, I’m glad to hear that.” Cas presses a kiss to Dean’s forehead. “If you’re tired, or if you just want to, you are welcome to spend the night.”
Dean looks at the assortment of colors hanging from the backpack. “Um, I don’t really know which one is for me.” He’s shocked that he’s even admitting this to someone. This is the first time he’s ever implied to anyone that he’s anything other than straight.
Dean laid his bed all the way down and closed his eyes. He was still pretty drowsy and hoped sleep would come easily. A nurse came in soon after Michael left and checked his vitals. Dean drifted off to sleep shortly after she was done, happy to sleep the night away.
The man nodded and looked Dean over. “I’ve heard a lot about you, Dean. I hope you’ll be a lovely mate, husband, and house omega for my son.”
Dean knew that Castiel was a little possessive. He never stopped touching Dean or holding him when they were here. He kept him away from the creeps, which was always nice. Dean liked it when people stared at him, but he decided just then that Castiel being possessive of him was way hotter.
Dean whimpered. “Please, sir. Fuck me so hard that I feel it for days, I wanna be able to sit down and feel it all the time. I need you to make me yours.”
Castiel lays down beside Dean and accepts the arm around him. He closes his eyes tightly as the voices start up again.
Zachariah touches two fingers to Castiel’s forehead, and suddenly Castiel is on the floor of the classroom, lying on his stomach. He opens his eyes and looks around.
Castiel starts walking down the stairs, ignoring Dean’s question. He’s moving slower than usual, like he’s exhausted.
Dean snorts. “You’re an accountant?” It’s hard to believe that the man beside him, who is still dressed in a rainbow crop top and denim shorts, puts on a suit every weekday and sits in an office.
Dean blinked in surprise. “That’s cool.” He looked around for any other plants that looked particularly thirsty. He saw a hanging plant with vining leaves that had a couple of yellow leaves and the rest were curling in on themselves. “What’s this one?”
“Yeah, I feel a little better now.” Castiel walked into the kitchen and grabbed his chicken out of the fridge to heat up.
Dean shook his head. “I slept all night, in my car. I woke up when the sun started rising and getting in my eyes. I saw all of those calls and texts from you, and I realized how bad I had fucked up. I came back as soon as I woke up. What I did yesterday was completely uncalled for. I know you would have understood if I said I needed space for a day, and I had gone out. Instead, I just ignored you for a day without thinking at all about how you would feel about it. I’m so sorry, Cas. I should have at least answered your call or texted you. I’m an asshole for that.”
“Cas.” Dean pulled back from the hug and looked at Castiel’s face. He looked like shit. His eyes were puffy, his face was splotchy red, and his eyes had bags underneath them. “Have you slept yet?”
The entree was a steak that Dean thought looked tiny, but tall. He got ready to cut it and pushed hard with the knife, only to find that it cut just about as easily as butter. His knife glided through the tender meat with ease. It melted just as easily in his mouth. He devoured it along with the garlic mashed potatoes.
Castiel added a third finger. “I know, my love. Soon.” He moved his fingers in and out a few times, making absolutely sure that Dean was loose enough. He pulled his fingers free and rubbed the remaining lube over his hard cock. He picked up Dean’s legs and pushed them back a little further as he lined himself up. His eyes were dark as he looked at Dean. “Beg.”
Cas shook his head, a smile on his face even though he was very purposefully averting his eyes from Dean. “It’s okay. I’m very messy during my heat too.”
On Christmas morning, Castiel has to pretend to be excited about Santa for his younger cousins. The youngest is a newborn and there’s three-year-old twins. Castiel’s Christmas list is made up almost entirely of books, and that’s what he receives, that and the sweater his grandma knits every year.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut and moans as his own climax overtakes him, flooding his body with warmth. He shudders and takes his hand away, breathing heavily.
“Then we wait. We’re not going to do anything until you’re comfortable with the idea of it. I don’t care how long that takes. I’ll stop initiating and I’ll let you start something whenever you’re up for it. Sex isn’t the end-all-be-all of a relationship. It’s supposed to be healthy and fun. If it’s not going to be for you, then we wait until it will be.”
Dean nods, chewing the inside of his cheek. “There’s one other thing. I don’t want to tell our friends yet.”
“Cas, that’s not normal. I’ve been around alphas in rut, had friends who’ve slept with an alpha in rut, and none of them came out looking like that.”
Dean had put Claire’s hair up into two pigtail braids and put glitter in the part of her hair. She was just as excited as Dean was.
The waitress sets two waffles in front of them, two plates of hashbrowns, and two plates of bacon. She asks if they need anything else, to which the boys politely decline.
“I think you’ve figured out by now that I don’t have a very happy marriage. My husband is far from loyal, and when Michael asked him about me helping you through your heats, he even said that it would take pressure off of him to satisfy me.”
Dean watched Castiel leave and whined, reaching a hand out for him. He saw Castiel pull a phone out of his pocket just as he disappeared into the bathroom. He heard his voice, but couldn’t quite tell what he was saying. He sounded angry. Dean shifted and remembered the dildo still hanging out of him. He blushed and quickly took it out, setting it aside on the bed.
“Dean looked half-dead. If Cassie didn’t call for me, Dean probably wouldn’t be awake right now. Heatstroke is serious.”
When he gets close to the area of her apartment, he texts Meg, asking her if he can come over. He gets a response almost immediately, so he bikes over to her apartment.
Around 10:30, Dean was happy to see Castiel walking into the sunroom with a mug of tea. He looked much more well-rested than he had in the past few days. Sam asked Castiel about the plants, which lead to a very long conversation about all of their names and care. Cas was especially happy that his dramatic fittonia, Fernanda, was flowering. There were four long stems with dainty white flowers on the end poking through the leaves.
Castiel’s alarm goes off earlier than usual the next morning. He leaves Dean in bed and throws on his clothes to go to health services.
Dean nodded. “Yeah. Haven’t seen Bobby since I moved here.” He sighed and looked at the time on the clock. “I should probably head back to Michael. I’m starting to get tired, so hopefully I’ll sleep soon.”
Dean raises a brow, crossing his arms. “You sure you’re going to be good at it now? You’re pretty drunk.”
Another strong wave hit when he felt Castiel’s knot fully catch and swell, locking them together. He felt Cas coming inside of him, and the sensation was breathtaking. He couldn’t see straight or think straight anymore. Everything was so wildly intense, and it was finally winding down.
“Okay. I promise I won’t hurt you, buddy.” With that reassurance given, Dean begins. He plunges his finger into the feathers and slowly drags his hands down. He starts on the left wing, since it looks a little more beat up than the right.
Dean sat up and pulled his shirt off. “I definitely slept a little longer than I would have liked. You?”
Castiel brushed a stray hair off of Dean’s forehead and sighed. “I want to, but…” He closed his eyes. “I’m afraid that the more you find out about me, the less you’re going to like me. Also, you’re in heat. You’re going to change your mind when you’re thinking clearly.”
Dean nodded a bit. He didn’t like the idea of not being able to go do things on his own. “Did you already ask about me going out on my own?”
He walked back to the shower and took a brisk one to get clean. He walked downstairs and washed the dishes. While he was on a good streak, he swept and mopped the kitchen, took out the trash, and tidied up the living room. He knew that he was doing these things partially because of his guilt. Dean hoped that when he talked to Castiel and they worked things out, that some of that guilt would go away. Even if it didn’t, Dean felt that he deserved it. He was an asshole.
Michael nodded and smiled. “Yeah, that would be great. It’s just one more heat, so it won’t be much trouble, right?”
Michael smiled back and gently took Dean’s left hand, sliding the ring onto his ring finger. He stood up and kissed Dean’s forehead. “Thank you for coming into my life.”
Once dinner was over, Michael and Dean cut the cake, and then everyone moved into the main hall for Michael and Dean’s first dance. It was just a standard slow dance song played by a live band. It was mostly acoustic guitar and piano, two sounds Dean enjoyed a lot. He felt a little awkward slow dancing in front of everyone, but they had practiced a lot, so Dean didn’t feel like he was going to mess up.
Dean holds himself up on one elbow to reach down and touch Cas’s skin. He’s still in that crop top, so his stomach is exposed like it’s waiting to be touched. Dean’s hand slides along his soft skin and traces the lines of the muscles underneath.
“Love you too. Bye.” Castiel hangs up the phone call and lets out a long sigh. “They knew. The angels literally just handed me to them, told them my name, and told them that I’d return to Heaven one day.”
Castiel reaches out and puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “It couldn’t have been your fault. You didn’t do anything.”
“Mmm, probably getting drunk at the bar. It’s okay, he has a short temper, but when he’s at an event like this, he’s the most charming man you’ll ever meet, no matter how drunk he is. He can lay it on you when he wants to.” Castiel was still angry about the fight earlier. He knew he sounded angry, but he didn’t want to. He was supposed to be comforting Dean, not the other way around.
The pizza arrives about twenty minutes later. Both of them eat quickly, hungry from missing dinner time. Castiel stays quiet, trying to think over his decision. He can’t deny that he’s drawn to being an angel. Maybe it’s the part of him that used to be an angel that’s pulling him towards that choice.
Castiel forced a smile as best as he could. “I’m about to go home. Luke wants to leave. I just wanted to say I’m so happy for you.”
“These are good things to learn about yourself.” As he speaks, he begins to speed up. His grip suddenly tightens on Dean’s hand as he pulls him up. He leans in and kisses Dean again. “I could kiss you forever,” he mumbles against Dean’s lips.
Castiel thought for a moment. He had to really think if he’d be okay keeping their relationship a secret for some time. He’d do it in a heartbeat if Dean was in the closet, so this didn’t have to be any different. He could do it now just to keep Dean comfortable. He nods. “That’s okay with me. Just as long as we do eventually tell them. I can’t keep the secret forever.”
The car that took them to the school arrived at 7:30. Dean carried Claire’s backpack and lunchbox outside and loaded her into her carseat. He was glad that Michael let him ride to school with Claire. The park was something recent. That took months of asking. Michael finally said yes when Dean brought up the point that Claire never gets to play in an area like that.
It felt a little weird to be naked in front of Michael, and it was even weirder when Michael was naked. Dean knew the unfamiliarity would fade soon. He wanted this with Michael. He liked him a lot and wanted to make him happy. Part of his mental preparation was to block out any thoughts of Castiel while he was in this situation. All was well so far.
Castiel offers a small smile back. “It’s okay. I’m not upset.” He stops there and says a silent prayer that Sam doesn’t ask again.
The day after that, they couldn’t stop talking. Dean would talk for as long as he could, but his heat eventually rendered him unable to speak very clearly. Castiel would talk while Dean couldn’t. He told him how beautiful he was, how much he cared for him, and told him about the life he wished they could have. That evening, they cried. It was really starting to sink in now.
Castiel’s eyes widen slightly, and he feels the blush rising in his face. He looks back at his laptop and swallows. Was Dean flirting with him? He did say he was bisexual so it wasn’t out of the question. Castiel definitely found Dean attractive. His face looked like it could be on the cover of a magazine and his body, underneath all of those layers he liked to wear, was one that Castiel craved to see.
Castiel blinked. “No, I’m not a servant. I help around the house because it’s the only thing I have to do around here. Luke works a lot, so I spend most of my time alone here. I asked to help with you. Gabriel was such a big help for me when I got here, and I wanted to make sure you had just as much help adjusting as I did.”
Dean woke up to the feeling of a gentle hand on his shoulder. He opened his eyes and saw Castiel standing over him.
Castiel nodded. “You bite your nails now. You did it for a solid half hour in the car before the police caught us. You did the leg-shaking thing, and your hands never stopped moving. I promise I’m not trying to hyper-analyze you. It’s just what I noticed, because you never did those things a few years ago.”
Dean looked at the cop holding Castiel and then back at the one trying to get him out of the car. “I wasn’t kidnapped! I’m trying to get away from my husband!”
Dean emerges from the bedroom, where he’s been unpacking while Castiel had grabbed the last box from the UHaul. He beams when he looks at Castiel. “Now the fun part.”
Dean is at the table when Castiel returns, eating a taking burger. He looks at Castiel and waves a bit. “How was it?”
Castiel takes his chance while there’s still silence to fall asleep. He drifts off with ease, falling into a deep slumber.
Dean hummed. “I decided to become a detective after several decades of nothing. Sam’s been a prosecutor for almost forty years. He loves it. I crashed at his place all the time and did nothing for forty years. Then, Sam made me get off my ass and I become a detective. It was the closest to the work I did with Sam right before the war.”
Castiel’s expression was sincere as he listened to Dean speak. “Dean, I can’t imagine what it was like being dragged all over the country like that. While I can relate to sleeping in motels or cars, I didn’t have a younger sibling to look after the whole time. You don’t give yourself enough credit for all that you’ve done, Dean. I can tell. Thank you for sharing that with me. If you ever want to talk about anything, I’ll always be here to lend a listening ear.”
Dean smiled and nodded. “Yeah, we got to do everything we said we did. Nothing was late or early either. Yeah, it was great.”
“The same way I called him earlier today. I pray to him. It sounds weird when I say it like that so I’ve been referring to it as a call,” Castiel explains.
Castiel kissed Dean’s cheek. “I don’t. Even if I did, I wouldn’t want to put you through something you didn’t want to go through. Besides, we already have two beautiful kids, and if we decide we want another one day, there’s always adoption. But right now, I think we have our hands full with just the two.”
The woman’s eyes moved to Dean, and he felt his stomach drop. He wasn’t going to be nearly as good at this as Castiel.
It only took a few minutes for Dean to fall back asleep. He slept peacefully until Michael’s alarm went off. Dean was good at ignoring it now. He just kept his eyes closed and stayed there. Michael got up and Dean heard him coughing and sniffling. He sat up and watched the alpha blow his nose and stare bleary-eyed into his closet. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose before shaking his head and walking back towards the bed.
Castiel seemed to think hard about what he was going to say next. There was a long pause, and his smile was gone. “I never learned to drive because I was kicked out of my family’s home just before I turned 16. I was waiting to get my permit, because I didn’t have a car that I could learn with.”
“Ah! Thank you! Thank you, sir…” Dean spread his legs apart further and resisted the urge to push back against Castiel’s fingers. He gasped when Castiel curled them against his prostate. “Fuck, please, need you.”
The voices don’t stop over the coming days. Castiel does his best to ignore them, but within two weeks the voices become more than just whispers. Sometimes Castiel whirls around in his bedroom because he swears he hears someone right behind him. Almost every day, the tinnitus gets so loud that he doubles over. It happens in class one time. Each time, he takes the migraine pills health services recommended. They don’t seem to do anything, since the pain only lasts for a minute at the max.
Dean shrugged. He didn’t really like talking about why he took them. “I just wanted them, I guess. Heats are a pain.”
Castiel reaches inside and grabs his keys off the hook before hopping into the driver’s seat of his car.
Castiel nodded. “It was tailored after the measurements you sent to Michael before arriving. It should fit perfectly. Do you need any help?” The omega laid the bag out and unzipped it, revealing a crisp black suit with a green tie.
“No, I have an Apple TV with pretty much every streaming service you could want. I’ll set it up tonight.”
Castiel chuckled softly. “Your brother is very proud of you. I hope I get the chance to meet you soon.”
“God, I didn’t even think about custody.” Dean groaned and ran his hands over his face. “This is going to be a mess.”
He finally finds a clearing in the crowd at the top of the street. He stands at the guard rails and looks at the empty road, which will soon be filled with floats and people.
Dean’s legs twitched and his mouth dropped open as he cried out, his body singing sweet release as he finally came, slick coating Castiel’s hand and streaks of white painting his belly. It was white-hot, and then cooling. Dean felt the room cool down and suddenly he wasn’t so strung-tight anymore. It was heavenly.
Meg takes the cash and sticks it in her pocket, staring down Ash like a predator teasing its prey. She picks up the ball and throws it, sinking it into Ash’s last cup. “I win.”
Claire didn’t move a muscle while Cas left the room and returned with a calmer Jack. His face was clean, but his baby cheeks were still red from crying. His big blue eyes locked onto Claire, and stayed there as Cas sat down on the far end of the couch.”
Cas chuckled, rearranging Jack in his arms. Luckily because of his angelic strength, he could hold the baby with only one arm even when Jack was squirming. A rare, tiny smile stayed etched on Cas’ face.
“Yes?” He looked up. The traffic-cone, orange sweater, that Claire dubbed an abomination, was in his hands.
he can have the candy bowls prepared by the time Jack is done with their costume. He couldn’t ask for a bigger win-win.
The woman didn’t move from where she stood, but she did take in every detail of the room that she could see. Her posture stiffened. “Where’s Samuel?”
Cas smiled softly, and then it fell while he stared at his hands in his lap. “I suspect now that Dean is mostly upset about the disappearance act, but...I’ve been keeping the distance so I don’t have to lose everyone. My siblings already dislike both Winchesters.”
“You’re angry with me,” Cas cut in. “Disappointed too, I’d imagine. Honestly…..who isn’t?” He finally lifted his gaze and caught Dean’s eye. “Because of
“-of course.” The angel knew what he was doing. “In Heaven I was a soldier and strategist. I didn’t just suddenly stop because I’m here on Earth-” His hand reached Dean’s shoulder, slotting into place where the faded scar was hidden under the fabric. He squeezed. “-with
Cas took everything out of the bag and examined it carefully. The bag contained: a machete, some silver bullets but no gun, a pouch of silver coins, an iron crowbar, a lock pick set, a coin Claire thinks is iron, a couple bottles of holy water, some spray paint, a half empty container of salt, a box of penguin band-aids, cleaning alcohol, and an angel sword. Cas frowned. “This is abysmal.”
, what we’re planning on doing next and-” He sat up straighter in his chair and held Dean’s stare. “I want us to retire from hunting.”
“Probably,” Claire answered simply. She glanced down at Jack. He was holding a light yellow, fleece jacket. The hood design was to make the wearer look like a giraffe. She cracked a small smile. “Sooo…”
He nearly knocked himself over turning around so fast. If he wasn't already dead, Dean knew his heart would have been racing. This was it.
Cas turned away from the window, and held Jack up in front of him with both hands. He could feel that Jack was close to another growth spurt. “We can’t have Claire running headfirst into teeth, and claws, and all kinds of trouble.” He placed Jack in the middle of his play pen. Cas bopped him lightly on the nose. “That’s Dean’s job, remember?”
Before Dean could say anything else the oncoming, thundering footsteps pulled his attention to the direction of the bedrooms.
“I’m surprised you could feel anything at all,” Cas mumbled while he crossed the room to sit on the corner of Jack’s bed.
First things first, she needed to scrub her hands. The blood wasn’t too stained into her fingertips yet. A deep exhale left her slowly as the water ran clear down the drain. Glancing around, she spotted a pale yellow hand towel in reach. She dried her hands, stopping only to get a better look at the bee embroidered to the bottom of the towel. It was unexpected, but well made.
. He didn’t think she’d rat him out, but he was still worried enough that he absentmindedly bumped into one of the picture frames on the wall.
“You’ve been doing good so far. Maybe they won’t find you,” Claire said, leaning her elbows on the table. She rested the side of her face in the palm of her hand.
“Dean, you really should come inside. It’s too cold.” Cas stopped at the nose of the impala. He rested a light hand right above the driver’s side headlight.
Cas hummed. He picked the candy bowls up from the table and stopped in front of Dean. He raised an eyebrow. “Do you see anything wrong with this picture?”
Cas’ eyes squinted like he wasn’t sure if she was kidding or not. He sat back in his chair. “Am I not supposed to be talking to Jack like I would anyone else?”
“When I did find Kelly,” Cas continued. “And I rescued her from Dagon, one of the Princes of Hell…..Jack called out to me. He showed me a peaceful world. A vision of the good he’ll be able to do.”
There was a hitch in Cas’ breathing. He blinked and held the candy bowls out to Dean. Somehow his expression remained cool and controlled.
The word left her lips before her brain even caught up that she just called for her son. The next thing Mary knew, she was standing in the doorway Dean left through. Her hands trembled, but her mind kept circling around the fact that she called out to her four year old for help.
Cas raised an eyebrow, feigning authority. “Now, can you please pick something out so I can get Jack’s lunch going?”
Cas’ expression softened studying Jack. “Yellow. Warm and soft like a…..I think it’s called a hellebores.”
New tears slid down his already soaked face, hugging his jaw. “I can’t do that without saving him one more time. He promised me forever.” His gaze slid up to meet his son’s with fiery determination. “Jack, it’s too soon to be his time.”
The card got slipped it back into the wallet and then into Cas’ his jacket pocket. He leaned a bit over the cart so he could speak quietly. “We are, but by the time the Winchesters notice we’ll be long gone. It’s unlikely they’ll find the house from here.”
Cas leaned forward in his chair. His stare pierced into Dean, unwavering, like he was certain that he could learn all he needed from his eyes alone. “Dean, you can tell me now. You can always tell me, anything at all.”
Shock slapped across Cas’ face, replacing all other thoughts and feelings he previously had. His eyebrows pressed together. “I’m….
Slowly, he withdrew his hand from the empty, plastic candy bag and closed the kitchen cabinet. His bottom lip twitched as his eyes slid over to the overly cheery, baby animal themed calendar. Not even the memory of Cas’ frustration that led the calendar being duct taped to the wall could stop the wave of nausea in his gut. Today was Halloween.
Dean reached forward and smoothed down the patch of hair that was still sticking up erratically. At his touch, Cas’ eyes squeezed shut, but the tension smoothed out the longer Dean carded though the angel’s hair.
“You shouldn’t, ever,” Sam answered. “That was the push behind removing your grace. Without it the Empty shouldn’t have any claim over you.”
It was the third car he ditched, and the fourth he’d stolen today. Cas knew that he was being excessive at this point, especially with the erratic out of the way routes and doubling back he’d been doing in case he was being followed. He couldn’t afford a mistake. Not now.
“Can’t either of you bring him back? Then no drastic measures would be taken,” she argued. Mary’s eyes rested on Cas. He might even know where to find Sammy.
“Yeaah,” Jack agreed. He was happily half-buried under some sweaters Claire threw into the cart after Cas eyed them several times.
“What you’ve been seeing is guilt. Since the moment you left I’ve felt like shit. Like I…..” But instead of finishing that thought, Dean sucked it back in. He sighed. “I shouldn’t have told you to go, and I’ll be able to explain soon.”
Upset, Sam went to sit in the library. Unfortunately the distance didn’t muffle the yelling. Where is he buried? No. Tell me. She didn’t take the news well. Why is it whenever you’re involved, I lose someone? Can’t you let me keep one damn person that I love?
“Dean-” Cas shook his head. One of his hands landed on Dean’s elbow and slowly moved up, wrapping around his arm.
Several emotions – confusion, grief, fear, and curiosity – flashed across her face. “I don’t think anyone’s ever had reason to try.”
They both stood there silently for a moment. Dean was carefully trying to put his thoughts together. Dead or not, his mind still felt jumbled.
“You’re free to go whenever you wish, but I’d like to go over a few things before you go.” Cas’ head tilted to the side and a small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. “But, yes, you get your own room. Technically, I suppose it’s my room, but since I don’t need to sleep I don’t have much use for it. I freshly laundered the bedding expecting that you’d like to rest at some point.”
“Maintaining customs, holiday traditions in this case are incredibly important to humans. I didn’t want to overstep or interfere.”
His gaze slid over to the rear-view mirror for probably the thousandth time today. Still, there in his eye line was Jack sleeping in his car seat. The sight unnerved him every time.
It was impossible not to giggle at that Claire discovered. The corner of Cas’ mouth pulled into an affectionate smile.
Mary opened her eyes to see scattered papers lightly floating down to the floor. The air had settled and she gasped for a deep breath. The strange light was finally gone. She got herself up, and hesitantly crossed the room.
Dean was making his way towards the living room when his memory caught up to him. Sam wasn’t back yet and Eileen was here
The sun was rising when they drove up to the small cabin in North Cove. Cas parked the car, but he didn’t move from his seat. Guilt was coiling and tightening around his throat for the entire drive, but it was only now with the house looming over him that he desperately felt like clawing for air. It wasn’t fair what happened to Kelly.
Opening her eyes, she saw Dean leaning an elbow on the table. Sternly, his eyes were coldly fixed into space. Another one of those odd rectangles, she assumed now was a phone, he had it pressed against his ear.
And then, Cas withdrew his hands and the chill of the autumn night flooded into Dean’s bones like a broken dam. His brain felt momentarily scrambled, but he wasn’t sure if it was from Cas’ words or the absence of his touch. Before he knew it, Dean was ushered inside the motel room.
Exasperated, Cas shook his head, but he pulled their hands an inch closer. He gently turned Dean’s hands over like he was inspecting every cell of skin. A soft smile tugged at the corners of Cas’ lips. “Jokes aside, much like your mother I did build this body with my own….well, more than two hands, but you get my point.”
“Soo…” She sat up straight. Cas took his eyes off the road to look at her for a moment. “Are you still sure it was a good idea to use the stolen credit card?”
“No,” Cas frowned. “Um...uh, well, to a degree, yes. I’ll never forgive myself for the wrongs I’ve done, but my guilt isn’t why I care...or why I want to see you succeed at something that I hear you enjoy a lot.” That got Claire to glance back at him. “I see you as my friend and as my family. Just like Sam, and Jack, and Dean. And...things have been hectic since I last saw you. A part of me honestly called you here, because I missed you.”
The lock clicked behind them and Jack sat up. He’d been laying in the center of the bed farthest from the door. “Sam called. He said that him and Eileen are aiming to meet us tomorrow if the weather isn’t too bad. Did it start to snow yet?”
“Yeah,” Dean grinned, losing himself in this new moment. “We’ll have to go elsewhere and grab your truck, but I have several ideas.”
The creature's mouth was still moving. He leaned forward. Hands still on the table. His eyes glowed an unnatural blue, and all Mary could see was the moment her dad’s eyes flashed yellow. She threw the blade.
Leaning forward, Claire dropped her face into her hands. “You let the devil walk around in my dad’s body.
“That’s fair.” Cas shrugged. “These days I feel like anything is possible eventually. I’d like to be prepared.” Claire nodded. “Granted all you need is to send an angel with a note.”
“I’d imagine. His mind is rapidly growing like the rest of his body. He’ll probably be able to perfect various speech sounds within the following week. If not sooner.”
Jack’s shoulders slumped dejectedly. “Daddy was helping me look through my things for costume ideas.”
“I get it,” Dean said, losing himself to his memories. There was something about that kind of pain that made any complication seem solvable. Like it wasn’t until he’d been cleaved open by death’s scythe that his truth was free.
The look on Amara's face softened. She sighed, "The world is far different now I'm told. I did this for both of you. A second chance. Don't you want to know your son?"
“It won’t be long,” Dean said, breaking the silence. “We should only be about a day behind Sam and Cas.”
"I understand," Castiel murmured and reached for his outerwear. Pierce mewled softly and rubbed her body around his ankles. She was out of sorts. It had been just the two of them for so long...three if you added the occasional visit from Chara. Having Dean here was unsettling for her...and for him, if he was to be honest.
"Sure," Dean said sarcastically and without a backwards glance, he pushed out the door and spied the old phone booth across the intersection. He snorted and wondered if it worked. Taking a handful of change from the Impala's ashtray, he walked across the street and picked up the receiver. After dropping a quarter in, he heard a dial tone. He pushed the numbers and heard ringing.
Dean stood on shaky legs and followed Castiel to the table. He sat, and Castiel took his place across from him. Carefully, Castiel placed his scrying mirror in the center of the table. "Give me your hands."
"When? What do we do? Who is it? Is it the hunter's fault?" Questions were hurled at Missouri from around the room.
She tilted her head and smiled at him like he was a dense child. Cas looked like he was going to stroke out. "Dean, just...go back to the cabin...please."
"Making a burn salve," Castiel replied. He could almost feel Dean's body heat, and he could definitely smell him. Dean's scent was a mixture of pine, commercial soap, and a muskiness that was all male. Castiel's nostrils flared. "I know you will be bored and uncomfortable here...I have some books..."
Dean still didn't trust the man. Witches are all evil. His father had drilled that tidbit of information into his head since he was a kid. Yes, witches are evil, but this one did save his life. Dean took the mug. The first sip made him turn up his nose, and he almost spit it out. Stern, blue eyes forced him to swallow the vile liquid. "Tastes like shit," Dean said sharply, staring down into the mug like the tea had a personal vendetta against him.
An hour later, Dean was at the bar drinking something called mead. It wasn't bad...not as good as a cold draft beer, but not bad. The food was a never ending buffet. Witches sure knew how to throw a party. He'd even danced with Mab. She called him a clumsy oaf because he stepped on her feet as she tried to teach him to waltz, but she smiled when she said it. He'd take it as a win.
Arif stood again and asked the one question Castiel had been dreading. "How will the hunters find us? I thought Castiel protected us from those that wish us harm." Castiel let his eyes roam the room, meeting everyone's gaze.
Dean wasn't normally slow on the uptake, but this particular...major...thought occurred to him about halfway to town. If Cas' aunts were old enough to be great aunts...they were old. However...and that was a big however, they looked to be in their twenties. Did that mean Cas wouldn't age? He looked damn good for thirty-five...if that was his real age.
"Dean, we're in Wyoming. If this is a blizzard, it could last well into the night, and we could be snowed in." As appealing as being snowed in with Dean was, Castiel knew the hunter wouldn't be happy at all.
Castiel needed to do something with his hands or he might just wring Dean's stubborn neck. He went to his work table and sat down. He gathered a few jars and opened his grimoire. He was low on burn salve and now was as good a time as any to make up a batch. When he'd counted to ten...twice, he replied to Dean's question. "Others in the town let him drink. Everyone offers. Benny never asks. Gabriel can't volunteer because he's a...was an...archangel."
His brow furrowed as he read of the conflict between Cas and his brother. Lucifer seemed like a big bag of dicks. Cas wrote of blood rituals and sacrifices. Cas' mother was a real piece of work. She forced Cas to participate. When he refused, she locked him in his room and warded it so he couldn't get out. He remained for a week with no food and rationed water from the rain outside his window. Furious, Dean's eyes followed the loops and swirls of Cas' words. He mumbled the spell to cut the coven's binding on Cas, so he could escape. As the hours passed, he read page after page containing only spells and recipes. When Cas journaled again, he was describing the town of Lafitte and how Benny took him in.
"Yes, but we can have some wine and celebrate," Castiel said the first thing he could think of. Understanding dawned in Mab's eyes, and she looked over at Dean, who was staring out the window, hands deep in his pockets.
After Bobby turned off the TV and the lamp, Dean tried to get comfortable and couldn't. About the fourth time he rolled over and punched his pillow, Bobby turned the lamp back on. "What is wrong with you, boy?"
"Listen up, everyone. I need everyone to go to their assigned locations. Dean's brother should be coming through the crossroads in an hour or so, let him pass. We believe the hunters are traveling together. Dean could you give a description?"
Castiel was silent, and then he nodded once. They drifted into the bar, and Castiel saw Gordon, still lying in the congealed blood. Gabriel made a noise of disgust and snapped his fingers. The body and the blood disappeared. Castiel saw John's gun under the table where it dropped. He stared at it. Obviously very old, there was something about it that made Castiel recoil from it. "Gabriel, the gun."
"I know, Dad...I was just asking..." Dean let his sentence trail off. When his father was drinking, you couldn't win.
Dean might be brash and obnoxious, but he knew when to stop. It was obvious talking about his family upset Castiel. Dean went back to his soup. Castiel had already finished; and now, he was putting labeled jars into a small box. "What's that?"
"I wouldn't just leave without saying something, Cas." Dean watched the man visibly relax, and Dean grinned. "Hey, if you teach me how to use that monstrosity you call a stove, I'll make breakfast."
"We need to understand your bloodlines to know how to design your robe," Maeva informed him matter-of-factly.
Castiel sensed Dean's need growing, and he kissed his way down Dean's belly. Dean sucked in his stomach, and he received a nip of teeth in retaliation. "Don't," Castiel whispered on the smooth skin. He moved lower, breathing in the scent of Dean's sex. The heady aroma of clean male sweat, arousal, and Dean's own pheromones could easily drive Castiel insane. He looked up. Dean was watching him intently. "I want you inside of me, Dean." He watched Dean's Adam's apple bob nervously.
"Fall in love, make lots of babies, and live happily ever after," Gabriel finished, clapping gleefully. "It's like a fairytale."
She tilted her head to the side. Dean smirked. "Yeah, didn't think so." The wolf made a snuffling noise, but remained still. "How do I choose?"
Castiel hid his smile as Gabriel turned pouty lips to Benny. "Yes...that's exactly what I will do...I hope the fleas of a thousand camels infest your crotch." The last part was set to a barely audible whisper, but vampires have a keen sense of hearing. Benny just laughed. Sam, who missed that part of the exchange, seemed relieved Gabriel wasn't going to share any space with him.
They answered questions, and Dean handed them his credit card for the payment information. Or Patrick Hunt's credit card, if one was honest. And he wasn't. When they were done, a chaplain came to see them. "I'm Father Davis, but you can call me Mike. Our social worker is gone for the night, but I can answer questions you might have about your father's future care."
Dean slowly unbuttoned Cas' shirt and pushed it off his strong shoulders. He ran his hands down Cas' muscular biceps before tentatively touching Cas' nipples. "You're...perfect."
He wanted to leave now...to get somewhere where he could have some Goddamn cell service. He looked down at his hands, still held in Cas' and suddenly felt calm. He agreed to wait until morning. Cas encouraged him to sleep, easier said than done. He cursed his stubborn streak. He should have let Benny give him a ride yesterday. He still didn't know why he'd insisted on staying with Cas. It wasn't just to fuck with Benny – there was something else, but he didn't want to think about it.
Dean pursed his lips and nodded. Cas spoke up for the first time since Sam called. "I will remain at Dean's side."
Benny took in the room, settling on Dean, now sitting up with a glare etched on his face. "Good morning, Castiel. I brought your laundry. Everything okay here?"
"I couldn't see the outcome, but boy, you will have to make a choice. It will be hard for you and will cause you pain."
Long after Cas blew out the candles and went to sleep on the floor, Dean watched the embers. His cough was better. The nasty tasting tea Cas kept forcing down his throat helped. He'd never admit that to Cas though. He was strong enough to walk to the outhouse by himself. He'd cut off his right hand before asking Cas for help again.
"It's only water. I'm not trying to poison you..." A veil seemed to fall over his eyes. "...or turn you into a toad, though I have thought about it recently."
Quietly, the two ate while trading small, shy smiles with each other. They were finishing up when the sound of a motor could be heard coming towards the cabin. Dean sighed. "Guess it's time to face the world."
This time, when they stopped, Dean glanced up from the bowl of water and a blue candle, locking eyes with Bobby. The old hunter smiled and nodded. Mab's voice rang out. "For understanding, support, intuition, and friendship. This I ask of you. So mote it be."
Stopping right outside the door to the bar, Benny spun around. "The only plan we have is defense. I'm getting ready to send everyone out to the different roads into the area. No one is to engage with your father. We just don't want to be surprised. We are going to stay out of sight and let you, your brother, and Bobby handle this. We cannot get involved. How you handle things...it's all on you. My job is to protect this town and the people in it."
Castiel heard the hitch in Dean's rapid breaths, and he watched in awe as Dean came undone. Dean cried out Castiel's name and his hand slowed. Castiel felt the warmth of Dean's cum exploding on the head of his cock, and it was the most incredible feeling in the world. He had no time to prepare for his own release. Time seemed to freeze as their bodies separated, and Castiel's semen splashed onto Dean's cock and balls. Trace amounts beaded in Dean's bush and dripped to the floor.
"Far from it," Cas said softly, a smile touching his lips. He pushed Dean's plaid over-shirt to the floor and growled at the t-shirt Dean wore under it. Dean was grateful for it, if he could keep it on until they blew out all the candles, he'd be set. Dean needed an even playing field. He gave Cas one more kiss and then gave him a playful shove towards the bed. Quickly, he went around the room blowing out the candles. Why did he light so many to begin with?
"Better than okay, Dean." Cas leaned over and kissed the top of Dean's head. Dean's fingers drifted closer to Cas' flaccid cock. "I can get that taken care of. I’m sure Arif can do it."
Dean quickly covered his junk with his hands, and then he pulled up his leg to hide his pudge. "No, water's great...I just thought it was cool you make your own soap."
Dean was on the road by six-thirty. He'd given Bobby a hug goodbye, something he'd never done with his own father. Dean pushed the speed limit and with only one stop for gas and food, avoiding dessert of any kind, he rolled into Casper at noon. He retraced his route and after a few wrong turns, he pulled into Lafitte. He parked in front of the store again. He needed to grab some liquid courage. If the store didn't have a bottle, maybe the bar would sell him one. He pushed open the door and didn't stop to think. He reacted. Seeing the bloodsucker latched to Cas' throat had him seeing red. What made Dean even angrier was when Cas defended the son of a bitch, saying he offered himself so the bloodsucker could drink from him. Cas was so fucking trusting. The vamp could have drained him dry. He had to rein in his rage at the thought of Benny's mouth on Cas' throat.
Cas leaned in and placed a soft kiss on Dean's lips. He pulled back a mere hair's breath and whispered. "I could turn you into a cockroach."
"Yeah, well she didn't warn you about me, did she?" Dean asked testily. "I stumbled on your place easily enough."
"Can I look at that?" Dean asked, pointing to Castiel's grimoire. Castiel hesitated. A witch's grimoire was sacred, not only were all his spells and recipes in it, but his thoughts as well. Slowly, Castiel closed the book and handed it to Dean. Dean's eyes widened and he accepted it, his eyes locked on Castiel's.
Cas sat back on his haunches. "We don't believe in it. Is it a problem?" Cas looked so sad that Dean pulled him down on top of him.
"Let me show you how," Castiel said softly, taking the jar from Dean. Dean nodded, biting on his lower lip. Castiel could almost feel Dean's shyness. Castiel spread his legs wider and dipped his finger into the sweet smelling oil. "If you go slow, the feeling of your fingers inside your lover is exquisite. There is a fine line between pain and pleasure. The pain is brief, but the pleasure is intense." Castiel found his hole and pressed inside. Dean's mouth opened in a small 'o' as he watched. "The muscle will release as it is stretched and stimulated, allowing for entry."
He threw back his head and reached for the sky. He inhaled and felt the power come from the ground into the soles of his feet. He breathed evenly as he was filled with energy. He exhaled and moved back to the east. "My lady, guide my thoughts. Let them lead always closer to you."
"She said a man would come out of the cold and would be a true and righteous man..." Cas stopped and Dean saw his body stiffen before he turned around. "No," he whispered.
"Can you wait a couple of minutes. I want to go with you and string up a line between here and there, so you won't get lost in the storm."
"Cas...listen to yourself. I'm a hunter. You're a witch. We're both men and right now, that's the least of our worries. There is no such thing as fate. I'm not a true and righteous man. Hell, I'm a fuck up...always have been. You deserve someone...better." The thought of Cas with anyone else caused bile to rise in Dean's throat.
He gripped the man’s arms and the wolf sank his teeth into the thick material of the man's sodden coat. Together they began to inch backwards. Once Castiel sensed safety, he got to his feet. Using the collar of the man’s coat, he began pulling him towards the cabin. The man wasn’t small, by any means, and his wet clothing made the weight heavier.
Castiel looked up when the door opened. Dean stood at the entrance to the bar, stock still. Everyone stopped talking. Benny stood up, hands on his waist. "Listen up, everyone. This is Dean Winchester. You all know he's a hunter..." The hum of voices rose and so did Benny's. "...he's a hunter, but he's one of us."
John looked like he was going to disagree, but Bobby cuffed him on the shoulder. "Come on, let's eat, have a beer..."
And there they were. The telltale wrinkles around his eyes. Dean frowned and noticed the slight lines around his mouth accentuated with the gesture.
Almost an hour later he stepped out of the shower, having enjoyed using all the hot water just for himself. Dean toweled himself off, scrubbing his hair roughly. He secured the towel around his waist and opened the bathroom door.
He began to follow the footsteps, using the staff as a crutch. He was wheezing and feeling dizzy by the time he made it to the forest's edge. "Cas," Dean whispered because he didn't have the strength to call out anymore. Leaning against a tree, Dean hung his head. Then he slowly slipped down, his back against the rough bark. He started to shake. His teeth began to chatter. Dean was so sleepy.
Eyes wide, Castiel snapped, "No." He came from behind the counter and all but ran out the door. Dean looked at Benny for some sort of explanation, but the vampire looked just as confused as Dean. By the time Dean's brain was engaged enough to follow Castiel, the witch was already fifty yards down the road. Dean took off after him, shouting for him to stop. Either Cas didn't hear or he didn't want to, because he kept running.
"I impart these words gently to Grandmere," Castiel named his grandmother and the people around him said the names of their departed loved ones. "Carry the smoke of my love and memories with you into the next world when you return."
"Your dad is an ass," Bobby said matter-of-factly. "He's full of hate and wanting revenge because of your ma. If it ain't human, he thinks it should be dead."
He heard the sound of an engine and tried to steady his nerves. He reached into his pocket and touched the pouch of stones with his fingertips. He somehow managed to look up in surprise, as his father pulled the truck next to the Impala. Bobby's truck with it's flat tires sat on the other side.
"Yes...no." Castiel said, his eyes drifting back to where Dean sat with two of his great aunts. "You said our bond was strong and unbreakable, that is good enough for me."
"Goddess, pull aside the veil, the edge of time where all things begin and end. Open the gateway between the here and now, and the hereafter, so that our loved ones may join us this night."
"Gordon Walker," Dean muttered. "He's a loose cannon. Doesn't care about anyone but himself. I've had some run-ins with him."
The sheriff leaned back in the chair and crossed one booted foot over the other. "Why are you still here?"
The four of them ran out to the rental. Benny reached into his truck and pulled a strobe light from under the seat. He affixed it to the roof of Sam's car. Dean took the passenger seat and Sam got into the rear with Bobby. Castiel remained standing on the sidewalk. "Come on, Cas," Dean implored.
"Son, I need you to listen to me." Dean was already shaking his head, and Bobby cuffed him on the side of his head. "I said, listen to me."
Cas picked up the jar and handed it to Dean. "You will need more." The oil smelled pretty good. Lube was something he used to jack himself off with, never needing it for sex itself. Women had their own natural lubricant, so there was never a need for it when it came to sex. He's used it with the few male encounters for handjobs too.  He took another sniff. It was just something he'd have to get used too.
“Just…go back to helping Sam. I just want to be left alone,” Dean finally said, moving to sit down on the closest bed.
He took two loads of wood to the porch and went back for more. The pile was getting low, and he needed to split some more. He picked up his axe and began to chop.
Dean swallowed and nodded. He wasn't happy about it. He was going to make sure Bobby knew it, but he kept his mouth shut.
Castiel was gathering his pajamas, mainly a old pair of flannel pants and a even older t-shirt, but he stopped and narrowed his eyes at the mound under one of the quilts. Pierce always slept at the foot of his bed. Always. Yet, there she was, obviously content to be in Dean's bed. He put his clothes on the bed. "I will move her."
Dean rested his forehead on the steering wheel for a moment before looking back at Benny and nodding. "I'd appreciate a ride."
"She will turn back as we get closer to town." Dean sighed. Cas was bound and determined to make this difficult for him. "Look, Cas, about yesterday...it's none of my business who you..."
Castiel watched Dean slip under the quilts, and he looked up at Castiel solemnly before lifting the bedding in a silent invitation. Castiel crawled in and laid stiffly on his back. Dean curled onto his side facing away from Castiel. He could feel the body heat the other man was producing. Before he could think about the ramifications of sleeping with Dean, he was asleep.
"Yeah, right," Dean muttered and with a sigh, he dialed Sam's cell. After he talked to his brother, he sheepishly approached Benny again, who was stacking jars of peanut butter. "Hey...Cas mentioned you had internet access..."
"Could a shock or something have set this off," Sam asked. Dean looked up, preparing to hear that his father's condition was all his fault.
The door banged open and Benny walked in. Dean's jaw tightened. The town's sheriff was a vampire. Were the people even aware of it. This Gabriel guy didn't seem scared or concerned.
"Shhh, I'll explain later," Cas whispered. Mab walked to the northernmost point in the circle and raised her arms again. Dean saw a pile of salt, a green candle, and a round loaf of bread.
As they left to walk to town, Castiel leaned into Dean, wrapping a loving arm around him and whispered into his ear, "Tell my aunts I slept with Benny and I will turn you into a guinea pig."
"Seems kind of funny you called Bobby when Casper is less than thirty minutes away. Couldn't you call a tow truck?" Gordon chimed in. While Dean was rambling, the other hunter had gotten out of the truck and made his way around.
"Remember when you said I was perfect?" Cas nodded. "Yeah, well, so are you. Just the way you are. Got it?"
"Okay, Mr. Expert," John cut him off. Dean was staring at Cas in shock. How did he know all that shit well enough to rattle it off like a freakin' grocery list. He confronted Dean again. "What needs to be done to the car? The faster we get it taken care of the faster we can leave this hellhole."
"Look...I gotta split..." Dean's gaze lingered on Castiel until Benny cleared his throat, pulling both of them out of a trance.
Dean didn't know what to say. No one had ever called him beautiful before. Hot, handsome, sexy...yeah...but beautiful...nope. "Don't sweat it, Cas." Dean realized he'd been using a shortened version of Castiel's name all day. Guess he didn't mind, since he hadn't corrected Dean.
The driving was easier once Dean got into southeastern Colorado. October was still a bit early for snow in that part of the state. In Denver, he stopped at a Walmart and bought a prepaid cell phone with one of his fake credit cards. He also bought a new wallet, since his hadn't held up well after being dunked in a frozen river. He left a text message for his father that he'd be spending the night in Colby, Kansas and would arrive in Oklahoma the following afternoon.
"Yeah...get us a beer, will ya." Gabriel snapped his fingers and two pint glasses full of cold beer appeared before them.
Sam narrows his eyes at the pair, then nods. “Alright. I’ll hold you to that, Cas. Have fun with your...grooming.” He backs out of the room and slowly closes the door.
The next day, Castiel and Dean are all over each other. They eat breakfast on the couch, curled up next to each other like two inseparable parts. For lunch, they go out to a local sandwich shop. All afternoon, they sit on the couch and watch TV together.
“Damn, has it really been that long?” Victor crossed his arms. “It’s great to finally see you two as a couple. You look great together, especially during that short scene.”
Dean was in his room reading 1984 for the second time. He was due for another heat by tomorrow, so he was trying to rest and relax as much as he could. He was actually looking forward to it. It was five to seven days of fun with Castiel. When his heat was taken care of, it was pleasant. There were times where it felt unbearable, but Castiel was always there to soothe him and take care of him.
Gabriel chuckled. “All good, kiddo. I don’t have anyone living with me in my suite of the house. I don’t like the ‘m’ word.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “I said, Nephilim. I think a Nephilim erased his memories. I have no idea how one is walking around without every angel knowing about it.”
Michael kissed Dean’s forehead before leaving the room to grab his things. The tension between Castiel and Dean hovered in the air as they sat and picked at their food. Once the front door closed and locked, Castiel spoke.
Dean watched Claire, unable to look Castiel in the eyes anymore. “You know, you were wrong about Michael. He changed a lot after you left. I tried to leave six months ago, and it didn’t work.”
The door opens and Dean walks in. He seems a little startled to see Castiel in the living room, but happy nonetheless.
Castiel chuckled softly. “If you have to know, I waited until you were asleep to eat, rest, and jerk off. I wouldn’t have survived if I didn’t.”
Cas considers Dean’s offer for a moment before speaking. “You’re in the closet. No one in your life knows that you’re bisexual. I think you’re just starting to figure it out for yourself. I’m thinking it was something about your upbringing that has you burying your sexuality. I think you came to Pride today because you’re curious, and you want answers,” he finishes. “That’s what I have so far.”
“The heat scent is gone. Michael probably knew it was over when he left for work this morning. Gabriel is still here, I can smell his cooking. It’ll look weird if we take a shower in the same room now.”
On Christmas Eve, Dean finally got to meet the friend Cas had in Chicago. Her name was Meg, and she was nothing like Dean thought she would be. She was an alpha and a fireball of a woman. She brought Castiel a box of Sherri’s Berries, which Dean discovered were decadent chocolate-covered strawberries. Castiel gave her a new necklace with a lock pendant, which she seemed to love.
Dean swallowed. “Uh, not much. Physical description, last known location, places he would go, any contact information you can get, yeah. I can try anything.”
Dean kissed Castiel on the cheek. “I promise I’ll take care of you. I won’t let anything happen to you.”
“I’m glad you thought so.” Michael wrapped an arm around Dean and held him close for the ride back to the house.
Castiel kicked the door shut behind himself and laid Dean down on the bed. “Hm, it was hot, I’ll give you that, but I wanted them to know that you were mine. Every time someone started to approach, I shook my head to send them away.”
Dean grabs the backs of Castiel’s thighs and picks him up, spinning around a couple times. “Holy shit, I missed you.”
He could smell Dean’s distress from down the hall all day. He returned and found Dean burning up so badly that he feared for his safety. He helped the omega into a cool bath, but it was too late. He wanted so badly to take Dean to the hospital right now, but he knew there would be consequences to disobeying Michael. Fortunately, he heard Gabriel coming inside when they got to the bathroom, so he had a ride if needed.
“Fret not. I’m coming back.” Cas opens the drawer of the bedside table and pulls out a condom and lube. “How recently have you had an STI screening?”
Dean picked his head up to look. Sure enough, there was a long line down Castiel’s right wing. “Damn. That sucks.”
Dean nodded a bit. “Guess we were in the same boat, huh?’ He chuckled a bit. “I think we’re both avoiding talking about the war.”
Castiel sat at the table. “I don’t really feel like talking right now. I’d appreciate the company, but I don’t want to talk.”
Dean laid down and ended up taking a nap on his own. He slept for a few hours, through most of the morning and afternoon. When he woke up, the room was on fire. His entire body was soaked in sweat, and all he could think about was finding Castiel. It took a few seconds, but then he remembered to call him. He clumsily grabbed his phone, knocking his book off the bedside table. He called Castiel and held the phone to his ear.
Castiel tilts his head in confusion. “No, you didn’t. I don’t think I’m the one we should be worrying about here. You just had a nightmare.”
“Asphyxiation can make an orgasm very intense. I’m sure that was a lot for you, especially since it was your second orgasm in just a few minutes.”
“Hm, not really. He keeps this place super clean. I usually just relax until lunchtime, eat, then I go get the little squirt.”
Dean nodded, slipping his phone back into his pocket. “Okay. I’ll be in my room if you need anything.”
Meg hugs Castiel and pats him on the back. “I missed you too.” She pulls back. “Now hurry up and start drinking so I’m not the only drunk person here.”
Through Dean, Castiel had made some new friends. Jo and Ash are old buddies of Dean’s from when he traveled all over the country. Charlie is a new friend Dean made in his computer science class. She took a liking to Castiel upon meeting him, and since then they’ve been pretty close.
Castiel chuckles and nods. “I do remember the ‘peches’ stand. You really drove all the way out there for this?”
Damn it, how did he sound so nurturing and so sexy at the same time? Dean tossed the pillow aside and let his head rest on his hands. “C-can...can you keep talking? Your voice is nice…”
They spend the rest of the evening curled up on the couch together before migrating to Dean’s room to sleep. Castiel watches Dean put the gun under the bed before getting in. As much as he trusts Dean, he doesn’t feel comfortable sleeping in a bed with a pistol under the pillow.
“It’s an estate, and there’s four. Our parents live in their retirement house in the country, so the place is all ours.”
Castiel wraps his legs around Dean and holds onto him with his thighs. He grabs his face and kisses him sweetly. “I missed you too.”
Dean hummed and leaned forward slightly to be closer to Castiel as he stroked him. He found himself captivated by the way his cheeks lit up red and his eyes struggled to find one part of Dean to stare at. Castiel was beautiful, and Dean wanted nothing more than to make him feel good.
Castiel wasn’t extremely vocal, but he had other ways of showing Dean how much he liked what was happening. He panted softly and shuddered when something felt especially good. Little moans were always muffled by a hand over his mouth or his teeth digging into his lower lip.
Michael hummed against Dean’s neck. “It’s been a long day. Do you want to come sit in my room? You don’t have to spend the night again if you don’t want to. If I fall asleep, you can go back to your room whenever you want.”
Castiel stands up and stretches his arms over his head. He briefly considers going back to sleep, then decides that he should eat with Sam and Dean. He grabs a box of his own cereal and makes himself a bowl. Since there’s only two chairs at the table, he sits on the counter and starts eating.
Dr. Barnes shook her head. “I’m afraid there isn’t.” She paused. “If you’re that opposed to sex before marriage between you two, how opposed would you be to someone else, like a beta or another omega, helping him? No suppressants, no premarital sex between you two.”
Castiel timed Michael’s arrival well. They heard him coming up the stairs at nearly 10pm. Their strategy? Castiel had been teasing and edging Dean for half an hour. Dean was wound up and desperate, so the scent closely matched his heat scent. They heard Michael come up the stairs and then literally run to his room and close the door.
Dean shrugs. “It’s just one of my nicknames for you at this point, I don’t mean anything by it. So, are you okay?”
Back at the station, Castiel followed Dean into his office to look at what results the names brought up. Luckily for them, the first name brought up an address that included several other names that they had received.
Castiel kisses Dean back and smiles at him. “See you tonight.” He can admit that he feels a little disappointed about their date, but he knows that family comes first and he’s glad that Dean is getting to see his brother.
Gabriel walks up beside Castiel. “I forgot how much of a stubborn bastard he is. I’m out of shape and he kicked my ass.”
“Yeah, he’s nice. He works a lot. He leaves before I’m fully awake in the morning, and he’s usually back around eight, so I spend a lot of time just lounging around here.”
Dean saw a doctor and managed to get the same prescription of suppressants he took right before the wedding. It was a massive relief to know that his heat wouldn’t be bothering him anymore.
Once Claire was awake, he got her to help unpack some of the boxes of her toys. She actually helped by just pulling everything out and showing Dean, who would smile and put the toy on one of the shelves.
The wing under his hands twitches slightly with each pass of his fingers. The feathers along the ridge start to lift off the top, puffing up and flaring out. Dean watches with morbid curiosity, wondering what that could possibly mean.
“It’s at a country club owned by one of my superiors. A lot of my family members will be there and eager to meet you. We’ll arrive around seven pm. Luke and Castiel will be there too.”
” men. Men with no shady background, very put together, Church involved, willing to settle down. More office worker than manual worker. More polished, less…raw.  The kind of men that seemed perfect on paper.
He couldn’t get any further. Dean suddenly felt like his brain defrosted and he gripped Cas’ shoulder, dragging him closer. One second later, he was holding Cas tight, one hand in his hair, the other one gripping at the back of his shirt. There was no finesse involved when he crashed his mouth on his. It was sloppy, eager and scary as fuck. And it was right, not too fast, not too slow, exactly right. Dean pushed Cas against the armrest and kissed him until they were both out of breath. When he straightened up a bit and opened his eyes, his heart was beating loudly into his ears. Cas’ hair was even more wild than usual and he had a very annoying look of satisfaction splattered on his face. They locked eyes and Dean grunted :
As usual I'll be very happy to have your opinion on the story, the writing, or what you think will happen ! ♥
For as long as she knew him, Dean’s always been a bit gruff, a bit grumpy, a bit rough around the edges. But the last few years he’d become almost a stranger. Moody, gloomy, sarcastic and not in a funny way. She hated the self-deprecating jokes he made all the times and that sad twisted smile that had replaced the wide grin she used to know. But it all happened so slowly that she didn’t get to do something until it was too late. She really thought she had lost him. When he didn’t come to the bar for three weeks in a row, her first thought was he was dead. She didn’t even have his number anymore, they didn’t hang out like they used to, they only met at the bar when she was working.
The eyes of his guest were glued at the wall, past Castiel’s shoulders. His mouth was still opened so Castiel remained silent, waiting.
Cas’s house was a mess. None of the furniture were matching. There was a slim book slid under one foot of the dinner table to keep it steady and one of the armchairs was losing his padding on the armrest. But the most striking thing was the notes, almost everywhere. On the mirror, on the coffee table, pinned on the wall or stuck into the door of the dresser. Some of them must have been quite old, since he spotted a “
Cas has retrieved the pie and shorten the suffering of the rabbit by taking a huge bite on his plastic fork and Dean wondered if he could ever wipe that dildo-rabbit thing from his mind. That and the fact that he was a terrible uncle that destroyed his niece masterpiece without sentiments.
Dean didn’t realize he laughed. Did it matter ? He never paid much attention to the reactions and emotions of people around him. Cas, unlike him, seemed to overanalyze everything, like an alien discovering life form on another planet. Now that he met him a few times, he was starting to understand that Cas wasn’t doing it on purpose and wasn’t meaning any harm, as awkward as he could be. That was still making Dean a bit uncomfortable though. He opened the box and smirked and held it to Cas.
The chuckle that escaped Dean had nothing to do with the loud belly laugh he heard a few times. It was way softer, but no less sincere and just as lovable. He pointed at Castiel t-shirt.
