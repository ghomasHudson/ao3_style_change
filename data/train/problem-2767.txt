“Cas, wherever you are, I hope you’re safe.” The words get caught in his throat as he thinks of the last time he prayed, on his knees in the dirt of purgatory and it feels like he’s swallowing thick tar. “But it’s time to come home now. It’s too quiet around here without you, man. We…”
He doesn’t know how long he stays there. It’s so easy to get lost as he listens to the sound of running water and focuses on the way it patters onto his head and shoulders. It’s relaxing, not thinking about anything else, and he wraps his arms around his sides and just
The sudden relief that floods down over Dean’s shoulders nearly has him sagging to the ground, his knees weakening as he struggles to stay upright. It can’t be this easy, Dean knows there has to be a catch, but knowing that he’s so
“She’s with me,” he explains, almost a little hesitantly as if he doesn’t know a simple way to answer the question. “We’re in harmony.”
“Humans,” the Shadow spits. “I’ve never liked your kind. God’s favourite creatures.” It lets out a sharp laugh. “I told them all I never wanted anything to do with your lot, and yet look where we are.” It shakes it’s head as it extends it’s arms. “You’re like a virus. Infectious nasty little things that are impossible to stomp out no matter how hard you try.”
He’s been lucky so far. Only Jack’s has been tormenting him each time he walks out of his own, the door still stubbornly shut from when Dean closed it. Cas’s room is further around and out of sight, something Dean is thankful for. Jack’s room alone sits like an open wound, but Cas’s would mean so much more.
Dean’s not created a spell before. He doesn’t know enough about the intricacies of the work involved to even have the slightest idea on where to begin, let alone make one that can do the seemingly impossible. Eileen is only somewhat better at this than he is, something she freely admits to, so most of their hope relies on Sam who’s frown is starting to look permanent as he buries his nose in one of Rowena’s journals.
“I said I couldn’t reach him, Dean, and that’s true,” Jack says, looking earnest even as he returns to scratch Miracle’s ears with both his hands. “The Empty was around long before God and the Darkness. My powers can’t affect anything that happens there, and that's the way it should be.”
it's terrifying but it feels so good as his eyes start to blur but he won’t look away from Sam, “he can have me.”
The drive back to Hastings is quiet. Jack sits in the back, staring out the window with a look that Dean can only think as wistful. He doesn’t know what has happened entirely, what Jack is now or what he’s capable of, but he
him, and that's all that matters. Despite everything that’s happened, everything over the years that's twisted and torn their relationship into something barely recognisable at times, Dean chooses.
Sam is a whirlwind on the other side of the table. Dean looks over to see it's covered in a phenomenal amount of
Dean wakes to a hand landing on his shoulder, jarring him from his broken sleep with an intense jolt.
But Dean shakes his head and lifts his eyes to meet Cas’s. “But people are who they are,” he says strongly, shrugging his shoulders as if to say nothing can change that. “And no matter how hard you try, there are just some things that are too true to deny.”
“Don’t,” he interrupts harshly, voice hard and without room for discussion. He hopes it's enough to show this isn’t something he wants to talk about.
“Not here,” Dean says as soon as Sam is in front of him. He shakes his head. “I can’t do it here, Sam.”
“When Jack was dying, Cas made a deal to save him.” Dean starts to scratch Miracle’s ears, finding it easier to breathe when he feels Miracle’s cold wet nose press against the underside of his forearm. “His life for Jack’s.”
He finds the archangel blades where they last left them, thrown in a cardboard box and pushed to the back of the old shelves lining the walls in the storage room. Dean gets the box down and pulls them both out, eyes flicking between the two as he tries to decide which one to use.
He opens his bleary eyes, blinking a few times until he reaches up to rub at them. It takes a moment to realise where the noise is coming from, and he sits up searching for it until he notices the dog is sitting in front of the door and watching him with that wide soulful look again.
The room is even blander than Jack’s. Where Jack’s had at the very least shown signs of living with clothes everywhere and an unmade bed, Cas’s room is impeccably tidy and neat with a thin layer of dust settled over everything.
I watch the lively crowd wandering through the streets like water flowing between rocks. Every single person carries in their soul a story filled with memories and emotions, unique in their diversity, unpredictable and hard to decipher. I could be watching Humans for all eternity without getting tired of it.
Uriel's voice thunders in the room, tinged with jubilation, and no one contests his words. Even Anna remains silent, staring at Uriel as though she has never seen him before.
" Zedekiel hisses, having become pale and agitated. "No need to drag me down too! In my defense, I had never seen Uriel so brutal, and I will confess that in the moment I panicked and agreed to whatever he wanted!"
What I don't understand is Uriel's hilarity. He is bent over, slapping his knee and laughing endlessly.
In a blink of an eye, the light is gone and the Hall of Justice looks quite dim. My wings are open wide and my Grace is simmering with all this new knowledge.
My prisoner broke free, was killed by Sam who defied us by stepping in, the Garrison failed to answer my call for help, and my investigation is still going nowhere. If Alastair was telling the truth, that would mean that the demons aren't the ones who killed my brothers and sisters... but then
Now I understand why he's acting so angry. Chuck probably made the mistake of revealing to Dean a future that concerns his brother and the first demon created by Lucifer.
The demon's blood-slicked fingers wrap around my neck before I can make a decision, forcing me to look into his eyes. Unspeakable terror fills me, but not for my life. I have never been afraid to die. But the possibility that I might fail the mission stirs a deep, raw kind of panic inside of me.
"You do remember him?" he smiles. The kind of devotion in his eyes should only be for God. He walks slowly past me, his gaze distant and wistful. "How strong he was? How beautiful?"
Siosp freezes when we all rise to our feet and move to surround him, holding our blade threateningly.
I slowly twist my blade into the wound. There are red sparks flashing and crackling across his hand, and his agony grows even louder. Blood is dripping on my wrist and staining my coat sleeve as I watch his ugly, true face cover the unfortunate possessed Human's one.
When I finally get to the site and land on the earth, the entire Garrison is already there. My brothers are standing in a circle with their heads down, staring at the ground in silent consternation.
Dean's eyes shift behind me, and I know that kind of look all too well. The look of a General ordering a soldier to attack. I quickly reach behind me and grab the iron bar that the bearded Human - whose name is Bobby, according to memories of Dean I've explored - has just tried to hit me with. Ludicrous. His presence is interfering with my mission. I need to speak to the righteous man, and to him alone. That's why, with just a touch on his forehead, I push him into a deep sleep and then turn to face the target of my mission again.
Judas hurriedly moves aside while the apostles are yelling and fiercely fighting to protect their master. Blood gushes out when the ear of one of the guards is sliced off, splashing the grass with red.
"That human free will is contagious. That the Garrison is infected and any Angel who comes too close might catch it. The idea has grown stronger with Camael's and then Anna's rebellion and now with everything you've been accused of."
The growing fame of Jesus has stirred up many grudges and envy in the hearts of men, and there are many who want him dead. But until now his enemies have never been in a position to harm him: either because they did not know where he was or what he looked like, or because they did not dare to attack him in public before his hundreds of faithful disciples.
I share a long look with Dean, trying and failing to stifle back my compassion. When he averts his eyes, I turn myself invisible and gaze for a moment longer at the life the Winchester brothers have preserved.
He only gets a respectful silence in return. Anael eyes us coldly as to make sure none of us will dare defy him.
"No," I tell Htmorda. "Sam Winchester is a descendant of Cain, and as such, he is valuable. Besides, it was to bring him back to life that Dean went to Hell. We need his collaboration to defeat Lucifer. Killing his brother would be the most effective way to make him see us as the enemy. Should the chain of command deem him dangerous, we'll be given orders. Until then, we have more important things to do. Rachel, did you come up with a strategy to protect the seals?"
The Sisters are loudly whispering among themselves, obviously furious. I clear the glowing sigil with a handwave and the tiny portion of my Grace reintegrates my body.
"Absolutely. There is a unique bond between each holy spirit and its Grace, which is why Graces are not interchangeable. We’ve only got the one, you and I couldn't exchange Graces or give our own to Camael. And this connection between holy spirit and Grace influences them both. Grace is born out of Life, out of the Lord's creative energy, and the slightest brush with it is life-giving and pure creation. Even stripped of its Grace, Camael's holy spirit carries a small portion of it, just enough to create life in an empty womb or to achieve all those lovely little miracles. Millions of years of merging energies cannot be erased from his holy spirit after only a few decades. This is what we call an echo."
I've been a vampire too, of all people I ought to know you can't repress those kind or urges for more than a couple of days. Even Lenore, despite all her good will, gave up in the end too. No one can fight back his nature, it always wins in the end.
"So we will no longer be allowed to treat him like our brother?" I ask. "Or at least help him in his mission?"
I knew it was likely to happen at some point. Born Human, she's been walking the earth without being closely watched and protected like Camael had been. It was only a matter of time before demons or Angels would find her - it would have been surprising if she actually managed to escape us for her entire mortal lifetime.
"One last thing: as you already know, except to deal with a few inside details, we haven't been receiving orders directly for millennia. You will be required to receive Revelations to stay up to date on the Will of Heaven - you will be notified whenever necessary."
Lightning keeps streaking the sky and the thunder is deafening. A sudden downpour starts beating the ground littered with corpses, which makes the coppery smell of human blood rise to us. And still the voices rush into my head like a haunting litany, listing the names of our brothers who died in the battlefield.
"I agree with Anael," Rachel says. "We should grant this honor only to women. Unlike men, they don't butcher their kin or torture animals, and they understand the value of life."
. He orders us to bow down before Adam and Eve. And from now on, to love Humans more than we love our Father."
"Time is running out. The demons only have a few more seals to break to free Lucifer from his cage. Then it will be Hell on Earth and we will need you to stop the Apocalypse."
"Your brothers in arms will do just fine bringing animals back to life on their own. How many soldiers are there in your division?"
"Put your sword back in its sheath," Jesus orders the apostle who did this. His voice is calm but commanding.
He stops talking and walking, his body tensed. Slowly, he turns toward the dark forest. Gripping his weapon tight, he points the trees with his chin. I think I see one or two dark shadows with glowing eyes sneaking up behind the trees in the darkness.
But the temptation to finally go into Cas’s space is overwhelming when Sam mentions maybe airing out his and Jack’s rooms, changing the sheets and gathering all their things together to store away. Dean is convinced Sam says it only to get a rise out of him, its only just gone a month since Cas… but the worse part is that it actually
He forces himself to keep looking at them as both Sam and Eileen blink in surprise before exchanging looks with one another.
that rips through him as he stumbles to a halt in the open doorway and sees a barista handing a customer a cup of coffee with a bright smile on their face.
“Look, Jack,” he starts to murmur, unsure where he’s going with it, but Jack clears his throat and makes Dean jump as he briefly rests a hand on Dean’s knee to catch his attention.
Dean shrugs and doesn’t respond. He’s just going to get himself into more trouble and work Sam up, and he’s not really in the mood for either of those things.
might give him at least some liquid courage, but he thinks of Cas and he knows while he wouldn’t judge Dean, there would be that little bit of disappointment in Cas’s eyes as he would clap Dean on the back and sigh.
“Cas,” he suddenly says, the word ripping from him with fervour. He turns back to Jack and Sam, notes the tears burning in his brother’s eyes, but ignores him to pin Jack with a look. “What about Cas?”
“There was something else,” Dean says hesitantly, his voice quiet, and Sam’s head snaps up in response. His stare is hard and questioning, and Dean feels his already frayed nerves have stretched too thin. “Another reason. The nuns were…”
Michael’s and Gabriel’s blades are currently stored away here in the bunker and, while Dean would usually pause because of how
“We’re going to have to create a rift,” he starts to explain as he turns back to the paper, “but we can’t just use a regular spell like we have in the past. The Empty is different from Hell or Purgatory. It’s a
Sam appears beside the chair after a moment, tipping something crushed in the cauldron before he looks up and spots Dean in the doorway. He calls out something, something Dean doesn’t hear before Sam starts towards him
It’s nerve-wracking to realise how close they are to having read through the bunker's library, but also how far away they are from finding anything to bring back Cas. Hundreds of books have passed between their hands and yet nothing about the Empty or the Darkness has come up. Dean believes in Jack, trusts him to know what he’s talking about, but he can’t help that inkling of doubt starting to worm its way back.
His phone is ringing. It’s long since blended into one long continuous noise. He thinks he hears the ping of the occasional voicemail but it doesn’t matter because he’s here and he’s on the cold hard floor and he can’t get up, can’t make his legs move or his arms work, can’t do anything but stare at the blank wall in front of him as his phone vibrates pitifully on the concrete.
He twists the comforter until it hurts, and Cas’s hand is a stark contrast on his wrist where the warmth of his fingers are pressed to the gentle thud of Dean’s pulse. He takes comfort in it, tightening his grip around Cas’s wrist as he pushes himself to continue.
One, two, three drops, each one hitting the liquid with a steaming hiss, and Dean blinks blearily as the concoction changes colour once more but this time into a blinding gold. He glances up to see Sam has taken the knife away, and Jack steps back from the cauldron with his other hand gripping his wounded one. Dean wants to say something, but he’s stopped as Sam calls his name once more.
Dean shakes his head. “Not helpful,” he mutters, and Sam laughs as he leans across and grips Dean’s arm again, giving it a little tug as he waits for Dean to look up at him.
“Because you’re lying!” Sam yells back, and Dean recoils as Sam steps into his space. “I know something happened that was big but you won’t tell me! Why won’t you tell me?”
He has a vague idea of what to look for. There must be a spell or a ritual or something that can bring Cas home, so finding and combing through books containing those is his first port of call. He remembers Sam had found the Book of Spells after Charlie had destroyed it and, while most of it is severely damaged, it’s still readable in parts.
Cas doesn’t look away from Jack, but his other hand does fall down to rest on Dean’s knee. “I will give up my grace,” he says matter-of-factly, “and become human.”
to tell his brother the truth. He doesn’t know what he fears, but he knows telling Sam about what happened Cas isn’t just about Cas. It’s about parts of him too, and he fears that will change
Eileen’s mouth drops open, and Sam’s hands fall flat on the table. Dean makes himself look between them, wincing at the surprise written all over their faces before he drops his head to look at Miracle.
“Something from an angel and from a demon,” Sam continues, unaware of Dean’s thoughts, and he taps his fingers on two big question marks, one with a bright red line crossed through it, “to build a connection to the inhabitants.”
“Something that connects to Cas, okay. What’s the other part?” Dean asks, but Sam just scratches the back of his neck as he refuses to meet Dean’s eyes.
an archangel’s blade is, he doesn’t spare it a thought right now. “We can use an archangel blade,” he mutters, and Sam’s eyes light up as he reaches for a pen and scribbles under the normal question mark, “but what from a demon?”
Dean looks up, meeting Sam’s eyes. His brother looks a mixture of exasperated and furious, and Dean just grits his teeth as he lets out a thin breath through his nose. “Consider it a momentary lapse in judgment,” he says flippantly, but that only seems to make Sam angrier.
behind him, and focused on the fact they needed to stop Chuck. The trip had blurred into nothing, just road signs flashing by and cars on the road to drive around carefully, and Dean’s mind had thought of nothing but the end.
And Sam looks back at him and his eyes are wide and his face is cracking out into a tearful smile. “Dean…” he says, “Dean, you
read, and littered amongst them all is a vast collection of bowls with dregs of milk in the bottom, the condemning sandwich with its plate missing, a phenomenal amount of beer bottles clattered all over the floor, and mugs with stone-cold half-drunk coffees.
It’s just instinct that has him reaching for a gun that’s not at his hip, followed by gripping the arm of whoever is touching him and
Before Dean can say anything, Jack takes the knife to his palm, slicing his skin with a quick movement. Dean’s mouth drops open, not sure he remembers Sam saying anything about
Dean shoves the harness back onto the rack, his lips tightly pursed together as he feels his eyes start to sting. No, not here, not now, and he just grabs a plain black quick-release collar off the rack above and tosses it into the trolley with a matching bland lead before pushing out of the aisle.
Miracle just bumps his nose against the inside of Dean’s wrist, eyes bright and soulful, and Dean swallows thickly as he reaches up to rub his hand over his face.
The smell of fast food accompanies Sam back, though Dean’s stomach twists uncomfortably at the stench. He takes the food but can’t eat, waiting instead until Sam turns the impala on and pulls back onto the highway before he feeds the dog his burger in small bites.
The rush of relief would’ve knocked his knees out from under him had he been standing, and Dean lets out a breathless laugh as he leans forward to push his face against Sam’s shoulder. He laughs until he’s not laughing anymore, until Sam’s arms come up to loop around him firmly as Dean lets out gut-wrenching sobs, as the sheer exhaustion he feels on a bone-deep level threatens to drag him down. Sam’s grip around him is the only thing keeping him tethered to reality as his throat aches and his shoulders shake violently.
He just doesn’t have the strength or energy to deal with other people. All he wants is to block out the world for a while.
Big soulful eyes look back, reassuring eyes, and Dean smiles tightly at the dog as he ruffles his ears and tries not to think how strange it feels on his face.
. “Nothing happened, Sam. I already told you. He summoned the Empty and it took him and…” he trails off, grief swelling as he thinks of Cas somewhere so far out of reach, “and he’s not coming back.”
He sits bolt upright before he even wakes, hand darting out to try and grab whatever hurt him instinctually, but he comes up with nothing. He stops, feels the solid support of the kitchen island behind him as he rises, the handles digging into the top of his back, and tries to calm the sudden panic he’d felt as he realises he’s still in the bunker. When he opens his eyes, he quickly closes them again as his head
Sam and Eileen are both in the library pouring over books when Dean sticks his head in briefly. Sam looks up, eyes a bit crazed, and Dean just mutters quietly that Jack will be staying in his room for the night. There’s a long moment where they just look at each other, Sam’s face softening to one of the matching guilt Dean feels sitting right beneath his ribs, and Dean just
Sam’s excitement finally wins out again, and he reaches for both Dean and Jack’s wrists as he pulls them from the room. He’s yammering something that Dean can’t keep up with and clearly, neither can Jack as he blinks at Dean in shock, still wearing Dean’s robe over those mismatched pajamas, but it doesn’t matter as they tumble into the library where Eileen is waiting with a brilliant smile.
making this mess, but he vaguely remembers it becoming harder and harder to use his legs the more he drunk until he was sitting on the floor with Miracle’s head in his lap, a bottle of whiskey pillaged from the kitchen somewhere gripped in one hand and struggling to keep his eyes open.
overrules whatever is churning in his stomach and telling him to walk away, and he opens the door with a slight twist and gentle push. Light from the hallway floods into the room as Dean gropes blindly around for the light switch.
Oh. Dean drops his gaze and scratches the back of his neck. “Well, yes, but…” He clears his throat. “But, ah, not exactly to you.”
Sam seems to understand though. “I miss him,” he admits quietly, and Dean’s eyes flicker briefly back to him. Sam’s shoulders are hunched, his eyes downcast, and Dean nudges his brother’s leg with his foot.
“It’s not about Jack,” Dean snaps, words thick with sudden venom. He still won’t take his hands away from his face. “This is about Cas.”
But Sam doesn’t calm down and Eileen seems to have it covered, so Dean disappears to his room with Miracle in tow. He’s tired, still so tired, and this is no one else’s choice but Cas’s to make.
that Cas seemed to feel as he wrenched open his chest and bared his soul to Dean without hesitation.
Sam is being. “What do you mean?” he says, elbowing Sam as he does so. “Of course he’s gonna back to the bunker.” He grins at Jack. “He’s the man with the plan. He’s top dog. He can do whatever he wants! Come on!” Dean turns around and starts to head back to the impala, waving a hand at the other two to follow. “You know what? We’ll spruce the place up. We’ll get some recliners. We’ll get you one of those big-screen TVs-”
Eileen disappears with a plate for Sam, two carefully made burgers perched on top, and Dean sits by himself at the kitchen bench taking bites from his own. Miracle stays with him and Dean slips the dog small parts of the leftover patties, smiling tightly when Miracle neatly takes them from his fingers.
The Shadow looks murderous all of a second, leaning into Dean with a vicious sneer ripping up its face. “Simply granules that slipped through the cracks,” it snarls, and Dean feels a hint of satisfaction seeing the Shadow’s composure drop.
Cas, sitting on his bed with his legs outstretched and hands resting in his lap, Dean’s cassette player tucked beside him as he leans back, eyes closed and Dean’s headphones settled over his ears. His fingers might tap to the beat of the music, maybe he’d sway his head as the gentler songs at the end of the tape would play, and perhaps a smile would break out over his face as he’d start to mouth the lyrics as he’d replay the cassette from the top for the nth time.
.” It grins at Dean, teeth too sharp all of a sudden. “Even when every single cell in your body is telling you to run, still you stay. How courageous.”
. He can’t take his eyes off Jack as the young man takes a deep breath before he squeezes his hand into a fist above the cauldron, causing fat drops of blood to drip from beneath his fingers.
’ and from the curtness, Dean knows his brother has definitely seen the aftermath of last night. He crumples up the bit of paper, dropping it into the bin as he heads towards the cupboards with his stomach starting to grumble in hunger.
He looks like he’s ready to throw up as he drops his eyes from Dean. “It was your seventeenth,” Sam mutters darkly, “and Dad wanted to spend time with just me. He thought it would be a good test.”
“Sorry,” Jack mumbles, voice muffled by Dean’s shoulder. Dean claps him hard on the back before pulling away, frowning when he sees Jack looks confused. “I thought you were expecting me.”
“Dean…” he starts, trailing off as he clears his throat and looks around at the mess again, obviously unsure where to begin. “What are you doing?”
“Could be a little nicer.” He gets up with creaking bones that snap and pop as he moves. He rattles his brain for the first sign he can think of before he pulls his hand into a y-shape and rotates it up by his forehead. “Cow,” he mutters darkly at her and winces when Eileen smacks his arm.
He looks up, stares at the cruel blank wall, swallows his heart back down. Cas wouldn’t want this, he forces himself to think. Cas wouldn’t want Chuck to win, wouldn’t want Dean to give up, wouldn’t want him to sit here and fester as the world burns down around his ears. Cas would want him to go on.
. What’s changed since Sam last saw him with a beer bottle in hand as he’d miserably saluted Sam and Eileen out the door?
makes Dean frown and he tilts his head to the side in confusion. “Sam, I…” But nothing else comes out. He thought Sam would be mad at him, furious and disgusted, and while that’s not exactly off the cards right now, it looks like his wrath is pointed elsewhere as Sam opens and closes his fists on top of the table and glares somewhere past Dean’s shoulder.
inside me. Like there’s something missing.” He thinks of his first hunt, of his father closing the door to the impala without meeting his eyes, about the ghosts he saw and the raw pain he’d felt creep its way into him with each moment he’d spent with them. “And part of me knew what that was, what was missing, but the rest of me refused to acknowledge it.”
Dean pushes down the urge to yell at Sam, even if he remembers how good it had felt weeks ago when he’d exploded at his brother over the same thing. It won’t feel good now. It will just taste like defeat and Dean already feels like they’ve had enough of that.
He wants Cas. He just wants Cas to be here, sitting beside him with their shoulders pressed together. They don’t have to talk or even look at each other. Dean just wants Cas here with him so badly it's like a physical
Nevertheless, he rolls his shoulders, pulls the Book of Spells forward, takes a deep breath, and starts to read.
He wants to argue but knows it's useless when she turns her back on him, especially when Sam kicks out from across the table to nudge Dean’s leg with his foot. The look on his face offers just as much argument as Eileen’s had, so Dean just pulls a face at his brother before getting to his feet and letting out a short sharp whistle.
He leaves Miracle behind, ignoring the pout it seems he’s giving Dean as he closes the door. Part of him feels bad, but he doubts the store will let him bring a dog in, especially without a collar or lead. He glances over his shoulder briefly to see Miracle standing up against the driver's side door, watching him go, and he winces before grabbing a shopping cart and hurtling into the department store.
The Shadow rolls its eyes, stopping its circling as it crosses its arms. “If you insist,” it jeers, and Dean’s breath is ripped out of him as black goo appears from nowhere and slides over the Shadow’s face.
The cauldron is bubbling away where it sits on top of a camp cooker, the contents a lumpy black liquid that has Dean’s nose turning up. Sam is chanting beside him as he lowers the archangel blade into the liquid, and it’s fascinating to see the blade slowly melt down until Sam lets go completely and the handle is submerged, adding silver streaks to the contents of black.
“But it has happened before,” he points out ruthlessly, “so it can happen again.” He takes a deep breath as he sees the Shadow starting to rear back and away, waiting for the response.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean murmurs as he scratches behind Miracle’s ears, water seeping under his nails, “where have you been?”
He looks down at Miracle, thankful for at least his company. “You gonna help?” he asks, shaking his head when Miracle just buries his face into the side of his bed.
Dean isn’t too sure what to say back, any words that could come out just catching on his tongue. It doesn’t seem to matter though as Jack lets out a soft sigh and drops his head back onto the pillow, his arms visibly tightening around a sleeping Miracle.
Maybe the answer to that is Jack, and Dean still hasn’t told Sam about his visit. He and Eileen had just returned home as Dean had finally left Cas’s room, still registering what Jack had said, and Dean hadn’t had it in him to tell his brother what they’d spoken about. He’d not wanted to give Sam any false hope but, in truth, he hadn’t wanted to give himself any either.
“No,” Jack agrees when Dean stays quiet. “But that doesn’t mean the words don’t need to be said.” He smiles at Dean, eyes soft and comforting, and Dean lets himself smile back.
He genuinely feels lost as he stands in the doorway and looks at the stacks and stacks of books that line the shelves of the library.
He settles down on the edge of Jack’s bed, frowning when he notices a familiar piece of fabric tucked under the pillows. Hot dogs printed on black, and he can’t help the laugh that spills out his mouth as he finds out where his favourite pajama pants have migrated to.
Sam takes an obvious deep steadying breath and turns his gaze back to Dean just as Eileen appears right behind his shoulder, her eyes widening comically and mouth dropping open as she has her own sweep of the library.
“Hey,” Sam greets him quietly where he’s leaning in the doorway. Dean doesn’t respond, just looks his brother up and down and notices the half-drunk bottle of whiskey from this morning held loosely in Sam’s hand.
He won’t ever forget how he just stood there, speechless as Billie had pounded on the door in time with the pounding of his heart, so loud in his ears as he’d realised what Cas had been saying… what he was meaning… and what if Dean also… but he wasn’t fast enough as the Empty had crawled out of the wall behind him and seeped across the floor, had consumed Cas whole.
He meets Sam’s eyes, Sam who looks like he’s vibrating with barely contained excitement behind that concern itched out over his face. “Yeah?” he says, uncertain as he fidgets with the ends of his sleeves.
“It took a lot of piecing together,” Sam starts as he smooths out the wrinkles with shaky hands, “but I think we’ve got a decent foundation going. We didn’t really have any framework to guide us but Eileen pointed out we should just use the basics and build up. Start with the properties and the materials and go from there.”
Gabriel’s or Michael’s, and the only reason Dean can tell the difference is Michael’s is an obnoxious gold instead of the usual silver. He’s drawn to it more than Gabriel’s, and he drops the silver one back in the box and wraps his hand tightly around the handle of Michael’s.
There’s a long beat of silence as Dean looks between Jack and his brother, letting the words register as he rolls them around for a moment. Okay, he thinks. Okay, so it’s got to be something that connects Cas to… to…
Dean lifts his head, makes sure Eileen can see his lips. “You asked what happened with… with Cas,” he starts, ripping the words from his chest and hoping Sam and Eileen can keep up with the sudden turn. “He made a deal with the Empty.”
The walk doesn’t feel as peaceful today as it normally does. Maybe it’s because Dean spends most of it wanting to get back to the library to finish translating his book, something he never thought he’d ever be keen to do, and yet his fingers itch for the feeling of the pages between them.
Eventually, Eileen comes back and pries the dishwashing brush from Dean’s hands, nudging him away from the sink with a soft reassuring smile. Dean flounders for a moment, unsure if he wants to leave Eileen for the rest of the clean-up, but she seems insistent as she gestures vaguely at the doorway and turns her back to him. It’s enough of a message, and Dean slips from the room after a long enough hesitance.
“Oh.” Jack pauses beside Dean, his eyes settling on the photo Dean still holds. “He needed my assistance with some parts of the spell he’s creating. Unfortunately, I don’t know a lot about spell work, but I tried as much as I could.”
“Morning?” Sam offers a bit weakly, and Dean’s shoulders sag as he lets go of his brother and takes a shaky step backward, the backs of his knees knocking into the chair he’s just spent the night on.
Dean looks past his brother at the brick wall behind the chair and it has his stomach rolling as nausea creeps up the back of his throat. “Sam, I can’t…”
Now, it's too late. He huffs and slams the door shut, wincing at the loud echo in the corridor. No wonder Jack didn’t want to come home.
Sam still doesn’t look overly convinced as he runs a hand over his face. “Dean, I didn’t want to say anything but-”
When he wakes in the morning, it’s to Cas sitting in his desk chair across from him, and the peace that Dean finds settling in chest is something he never thought he was ever going to feel.
He pauses though when he reaches the corridor outside his room, lingers at his door with his eyes locked on the one opposite, the one that leads to Jack’s room. There’s a small curious feeling growing under his ribs, one that’s mixing with the restlessness he feels deep in his bones, and he lowers his hand from where its hovering over his doorknob before he crosses over the hallway.
They don’t talk about it though. Jack had left in the night and Cas’s shoulders tense whenever Dean starts to skirt around what had happened. Clearly, nothing had been agreed on, and Dean decides to leave it at that as he instead turns to focus on what to do now.
Something bold rises in his chest, and Dean lets go of Miracle as he lifts his eyes to meet Sam’s. He holds his brother’s gaze and squares his jaw, that feeling of determination back again and reminding him that this is not over. It can’t be over. Cas has to come back.
It’s so sparse, he realises as he looks around at what has been illuminated. Sure, there’s clothes all over the floor and the bed is unmade, but there’s nothing really
“I know that’s not all of it,” Sam murmurs though, and the feeling is gone as such a strong surge of anger burns under Dean’s skin.
He thinks of Cas, somewhere far away and still out of their reach, and Dean’s fingers itch as he lets out a shuddering breath at the
“We don’t have much time,” Sam is saying in his ear as they pull away, the knife still gripped in their hands and the black pushes against the red line repetitively as Jack steps back. “There’s only so long the iron will hold the Empty back, even with Jack’s extra boost.”
“I didn’t understand at first,” Dean balls one of his hands in the comforter on the bed, feels the press of the fabric between his fingers. “And I’m sorry… about everything. All the anger and yelling,” he lets out a shallow breath, “the
He settles at the table with the engravings on it, moving Sam’s laptop to the side as he spreads all the books out over the wooden surface. It’s a mix of old and new, books by hunters, the Men of Letters, the odd demon or angel, and even a few that they’d found on their travels over the years.
It leaves Dean alone, positive that his heart is beating loud enough to fill the room as he stares at the spot Jack was just standing in. Miracle shuffles beside him, moving to drop his head on Dean’s thigh, and Dean naturally drops his hand to bury in the fur on Miracle’s back as he tries to make sense of everything rushing through his head.
part of him knows that Sam is right. Already he feels so saturated. Seeing Cas might’ve just pushed him off the ledge he’s balancing on.
Dean takes a bite of his sandwich, chewing thoughtfully as he watches Miracle before it hits him, mid-bite, and suddenly the bread turns to cardboard in his mouth and the peanut butter becomes too sticky and the jelly too sweet.
Back in the kitchen, all traces of his binge last night have been cleared away. Eileen has done a good job, although there is still that unpleasant tang of alcohol in the air. Miracle’s toys have been laid out on the counter top and Dean spots the plain black lead and collar hanging off the coat hanger just to the right of the main doorway.
He rolls his shoulders and takes in a long shuddering breath before he focuses on turning the door handle, listening for the clicking sound of the lock retracting back, and he stands still for a long moment with the door half-open.
Turning around, Dean heads back into the bunker with Miracle following behind. Time to find something for them both to eat and drink, and he finds he actually likes the sound of Miracle’s claws clacking on the concrete behind him as they head into the kitchen.
, and Dean slams his fist down on the table in anger, at himself and at this shitty situation they’re in.
It doesn’t escape his attention that the lines in that relationship have blurred even more with Jack’s recent ascension.
Sam smiles and it's a loveable dopey one. “She’s good.” He ducks his head and rolls his mug between his palms. “She ah, wants to come stay.”
By the time they reach Smith Center though, the stores are starting to pack up. Dean isn’t even sure what day it is at this point, but as they drive past all the shops pulling in their signs and locking their doors earlier than normal, he gathers it's probably a Sunday.
She kicks out with her foot, pressing it sharply against his side and he knows now where the sudden pain came from. “Get up,” she repeats, and Dean twists up his nose as he pushes her leg away.
“But I’m not even that,” Jack interrupts, voice trembling with barely contained guilt. His eyes watery as he shakes his head. “I’m sorry that I’m not strong enough to bring him back myself.”
Just like Azazel, Lust or all the other demons I've come across, Lilith masters the art of irony. I believe she went after hunters knowing perfectly well that we were protecting Dean Winchester. To mock us, to show us her presence by preying on the righteous man's equals.
Pride sends a pleasant thrill through my Grace as I lift my chin and glance at Rachel out of the corner of my eye. And for a moment, I allow myself to be smug.
"I won't send you to rehabilitation either," I say bitterly, "since I have not deemed productive to report you all to the hierarchy. I saw far too many of our brothers and sisters die in the last few months, and I'd rather keep my army when I need it most to prevent the Apocalypse. I covered for you even though you don't deserve it. I deceived the hierarchy to save you despite your disobedience, but rest assured that at the slightest slip, at the slightest suspicion of treason, I won't hesitate to denounce you."
But this isn't my most pressing concern. They were only a hundred soldiers from my Garrison... About half of them. Where are the others?
I did see with my own eyes her human body being blown apart by the explosive fusion of her Grace with her holy spirit... How is this possible?
The righteous man is here. All alone in the gas station evacuated by my soldiers, he is standing in front of a mirror and staring at the red, blistered handprint on his shoulder.
I glance over my shoulder at my sister, cautiously laying Dean's head on the pillow before placing his jacket on his body, just like we found him.
Had I been a better General, had I been able to neutralize the threat sooner, I wouldn't be grieving the death of my brothers and sisters. Whether it is part of Fate's plans or not, I can't help but be filled with throbbing guilt. This isn't right. This should never had happened at all. Levanael was a faithful warrior of the Lord. She should not have died like that. Neither should have Miz, Pmox, Ephra, Yasen, Ecaop, Hcoma, Siosp, Camael, Riemu... All the losses that have drained the Garrison since it was formed.
I look up to realize that she is glaring at me intensely. Me, not Uriel. She's holding me accountable as General. If her access to the communication channels has been cut off, she most likely doesn't know about my demise.
"Apparently the witch knows who you are too." I walk over to the bedside table and show them the hex bag I pulled from the wall, whose spell has been deactivated. "This was inside the wall of your room. If we hadn’t found it, surely one or both of you would be dead."
"Brap and I are presiding today over this unusual session," says Zachariah with his hands clasped behind his back.
Inside, a woman and two men are copulating in a relatively normal way compared to what is happening in the rest of the city. Indeed, the woman looks like she has two faces. The human one, soft and smooth, and another one superposed whose features are slimy, with a thick black tongue as long as a snake.
I watch as the crosses are raised, the martyrs' toes nearly touching the ground. Jesus, with his knees slightly bent, clenches his teeth and tries to relieve the pain of his body's weight straining his bloody wrists, but can only shift the weight onto his nailed feet. Blinded by the blazing sun, he closes his eyes, trickles of blood streaming down his forehead and along his temples. There is also blood dripping from his wrists, running down his arms. His shivering body is drenched in sweat and he is already struggling to breathe. Over the past thousands of years I have seen how the human mind works to find new, more brutal ways to kill others by prolonging the agony, but this is probably one of the most terrible ones. Assuming he doesn't suffocate to death by sundown, the guards will break his legs with a hammer so he won't be able to put his weight on his wounded feet. I know this, because I've seen this kind of execution before. However, it's much harder to keep a stoic attitude when it's my own brother who's being tortured this way.
Seeing myself through Cain’s eyes is quite surprising. And unsettling. Do I really look so terrifying?
From what I hear, it looks like the hierarchy finally confirmed that Camael's Grace has been destroyed – there have been rumors about this for almost a decade which have caused a lot of unrest among soldiers. The voices are getting louder still. Some of them sound neutral and indifferent, but they're drown out by thousands of outraged whispers laced with disbelief and anger…
and be at least as dirty as me if not even dirtier, it's him, alive and well. Relief overwhelms me and I can't help laughing while I walk straight to him to pull him into a tight hug. I don't give a fuck about everything I said about personal space, I'm too happy and relieved. 'Cause even if I claimed every day to Benny that Cas was alive and tried to convince myself of it, the truth is I feared he was dead too, just like anyone close to me and stupid enough to want to help me. The hug's brief, but long enough to fill my nostrils with the strong and musky smell of sweat and dirt.
I can no longer observe the Humans with an indifferent eye now that I know Father made them in His image. Which means my brothers and I do not look like God. And that these Humans are now the most accurate representation of my Father I could ever imagine.
"Of course you are." Zachariah arches a patronizing eyebrow. "You were on probation while the investigation was going on, but that's all cleared up now. I expect everyone to realize that the disgusting rumors about you and Dean Winchester were just dirt spread by Uriel to undermine you. There is no doubt about your reliability anymore."
I alter the inclination of my wings, slowing down my flight to a stop. Gently, I land on the smooth surface, troubling it just enough to create undulating circles moving away from me. I fold my wings behind my back with a soft rustling sound, then crouch down to take a closer look and stare into my own eyes as though I could find in them the answer to all the questions that keep eating at me like waves on the seashore.
I look into his eyes, praying that he won't make things worse by fighting the order. That he won't make it more difficult. That he won't make me watch Uriel hurt him or threaten Sam's life again.
"I don’t know what is right and what is wrong anymore, whether you passed or failed here." I already broke the most important rule by voicing my doubts, I should at least warn Dean of what awaits him. He deserves to know. "But in the coming months you will have more decisions to make. I don’t envy the weight that’s on your shoulders, Dean. I truly don’t."
Surprisingly, it’s not hard to respond. Dean thought it would take force and willpower to dredge those feelings up from where they sit so low and deep, but it takes only one hard swallow to push back that lump in his throat as Dean leans forward and settles his hand over Jack’s head, threading his fingers through Jack’s hair.
It’s a photo of Jack with Dean, Cas, and Sam around him, and it surprises Dean since he’s never actually
Dean can’t help but let out a shaky laugh, thankful and embarrassed all at once. “I’ll keep that in mind,” he says, and Eileen laughs with him as she rolls the vial along the table until it hits Sam’s knuckles.
Dean takes a shuddering breath and drops his hand, looking up and around the room only to jump nearly a mile in the air when he spots Jack out of the corner of his eye, leaning in the doorway with one hand raised and a small smile on his face.
Sam’s fingers curl around it, pushing Dean's away, and Sam gives him a stiff nod with a grim look before he takes the cassette and turns back to the cauldron. Dean’s arm drops back to hang uselessly at his side, his hand feels empty now, and he turns it into a fist and
He shoos Sam away as he gets out of bed. He contemplates getting changed for a moment but instead settles on pulling on some overly fuzzy socks that Sam throws his way and tucks himself into his woolen robe that Jack seems to have brought back. Even though Dean feels vulnerable in only his pajamas, he knows it's making a statement of some kind, obvious enough when Sam pauses by the door for a moment as he looks Dean up and down.
The woodlands behind the abandoned power station are endless entertainment for the dog, who loves the smells and bounds way ahead of Dean as he sniffs his way through the underbrush, getting mercilessly dirty in the process.
, something deep and sadistic and not like Cas at all, and he rips himself away from him as the angel turns around and Dean sees its not… its not him.
It knocks something loose in Dean’s chest to know that Cas had truly believed that, to his very soul, had said it with so much conviction it had blown Dean’s breath away in one hit then and it still leaves him gasping for air so out of reach.
Jack doesn’t respond. He just closes his eyes, a serene smile on his face as he tilts back his head. He doesn’t know what to expect, but even so, it’s like nothing changes for long enough that Dean exchanges a look with Sam as he feels that doubt creeping back in that maybe this won’t work.
Article after article, blurb after blurb, it all starts to roll together as Dean feels his eyes ache from looking at the screen. It doesn’t matter though as he’s determined to look in every crook and cranny. It’s what Cas would do and it’s what Cas deserves.
Slowly, he tilts his head back down and closes his eyes. He keeps the cassette pressed between his palms as he pushes his hands together in prayer. Cas had said he didn’t have to do that, didn’t have to do any of the head bowing or hand gestures, but Dean doesn’t think it could hurt right now.
Dean’s eyebrows go up this time. “Why would I be expecting you?” he asks, wincing a little at how unwelcoming he sounds, especially when Jack frowns back at him.
The touch is so gentle that Dean nearly snatches his hand back in response. It takes a surprising amount of willpower to instead just tighten his other hand in Miracle’s fur to keep himself more grounded as he drops his head and takes in a deep breath. He’s not sure how he’s feeling, overwhelmed if anything, but there’s a resolution starting to work its way into his chest as he knows that this isn’t supposed to be about the case or the nuns or their Dad or any of the self-hatred Dean can feel swelling up in his chest.
getting up off this cold hard floor, knows the answer should be simple and selfless but Dean is tired. He’s tired of sacrifice, tired of death, tired of fighting.
come back I will be well-rested and ready for him.” The Shadow locks eyes with Dean. “And I truly cannot
“Dean, half a bottle isn’t a ‘lapse’,” he says, using his fingers as air quotes and it has Dean’s chest clenching. “Especially not after a whole crate of beer.”
“Is that a half-eaten sandwich on top of Drakopoulos’s journal?” Sam asks, voice filled with warning and Dean winces as he looks over to the other table.
Dean can’t help but smile. “You’d have already done it by now if you could,” he says confidently. “Every moment I’m here proves that.”
Sam frowns. “But that was over two years ago,” he mutters, “why would the Empty take him now? How was it summoned?”
Miracle’s barking makes his head snap up, and he opens his eyes to see the dog bounding towards him. He’s covered in so much dirt and muck from the forest and Dean lets out a weak laugh that feels so horribly foreign as Miracle scrambles to a halt in front of him, his tongue lolling happily out of his mouth and his head on an angle.
“Hell,” Dean says, his voice dangerously shaky as he reaches out to rub Miracle behind the ears, “aren’t you a mess.”
“The last two are a bit harder,” Sam murmurs after their attention is back on him, seeming nervous as he presses his palms flat over the last few lines, obscuring them from Dean’s view. “I’m not too sure about them.”
“It’s not that, Sam.” Dean lowers his hands back to his lap to look at his brother and hopes Sam can understand what he’s trying to say. “It’s just that I
“We did it,” she says the moment they’ve stopped, stepping forward to grip Dean’s elbows with small hands. Dean notes that despite the tiredness behind her eyes she looks as hopeful as he’s slowly letting himself start to feel, and he gives her a tense smile of his own.
After a couple of burgers and two meat patties the waitress hadn’t even blinked at him ordering, Dean starts to look for the nearest department store. Everything he needs for Miracle should be easy enough to acquire from somewhere general like that, although his eyes do follow the local vets as they drive past.
Dean nods. “The nuns,” he repeats quietly as he wraps his hands together and settles them on top of the tabletop. There’s only one book on it now, the last book that Sam had read, and Dean feels empty as he looks at the dull brown cover and thinks of how useless it is.
Because Cas is back and Dean had let the world disappear behind him in his grief, something he realises when Cas turns to him with a bright smile and asks whats next?
The thought hits him like a tidal wave, and Dean’s chest constricts painfully as he stumbles to a halt. The forest chirps around him uninterrupted as he finds himself swaying, hands fisted tightly at his sides as he tries to breathe jagged breaths. He can’t do it. He can’t go through all of this again.
for them not to leave it like this. He won’t forget Chuck’s words. Dean Winchester, the ultimate killer.
But it’s not the sandwich. It's the memory of Cas, the memory of them sitting here at this very table and Dean pushing a PB&J at Cas and grinning as Cas had wrinkled his nose after his first bite. Tastes like molecules, he’d said to Dean, and he’d looked so damn dejected as Dean had laughed and laughed until Cas finally laughed with him.
“I have to do this, Sam,” Dean says, voice wavering but still strong, “I have to bring back Cas, no matter what it takes. Because…” He hesitates, just for a moment. “Because Cas told me that the one thing he wanted was something he couldn’t have and, and he didn’t know…” he trails off as he feels it.
Eventually, their laughter dies down though, and Dean takes deep breaths before he looks towards the door. It's shut tight and he knows that Cas is somewhere on the other side. He has a brief thought for the others, for Jack and Eileen, and even for Miracle, but he knows they can wait for now.
He glances up to see Jack squinting at him, a look so reminiscent of Cas that it makes Dean ache. “Yeah?” he asks, and Jack looks hesitant for a long moment before he drops his gaze.
“I don’t know about the jelly,” he says as he sits down at the table and Miracle follows him, “but I’m pretty sure you can have peanut butter.” He makes his sandwich first before he scoops out some peanut butter with a teaspoon he’d brought over and holds it down for Miracle.
He swallows back the emotions creeping up from his chest, forcing them down as he feels the desperate need to get out of here right
There’s a slight commotion in the doorway, and Dean glances over to see Eileen standing in it, wearing a raincoat that’s extremely wet with a dog leash in one hand and a bag full of greenery and twigs in the other. That explains why Miracle is wet, and Dean raises an eyebrow at her with a pointed look at the bag.
With shaky fingers, he gently picks it up and closes the drawer. He recognises it, of course he does. He poured so many hours and hours of work into this one mixtape that it would be insane for him
Now, when he can’t eat a stupid fucking sandwich because all he can see is the one person he lost after all that, after everything they’d gone through, and it makes a chilling sob rip up his throat.
of ice-cold water rippling over him. He fumbles for the mixer to shut it off, swearing under his breath as the tension that had finally
There’s also a note sitting beside the toys, and Dean purses his lips when he sees it's been written by Sam. It simply says ‘
“Yeah, Dean,” Sam says in a rush, and his eyes are watery as he rubs Dean’s arm. “It worked. He’s back.”
Sam doesn’t loosen his grip though, just holds Dean as he talks. “In his room, resting.” He squeezes Dean’s shoulder. “Jack is with him. Neither of you were conscious for very long after we pulled you out.”
He turns away, clenches his hands into fists and waits for the inevitable tirade about to come his way.
He lets himself just focus on that, on the gentle rise and fall of his hand as the dog breathes quietly in his sleep, until eventually Dean’s eyes slip shut as the exhaustion takes over.
Sam’s the researcher of the two of them. Dean knows enough to get by, but Sam’s is definitely the one who will spend hours and hours reading books just for fun. Hell, he’s the one that’s willingly creating a giant archive for all hunters to have access to, which Dean will admit is a decent thing to do, but Sam actually
But he can’t hold it back now. Can’t stop the images of Cas appearing in front of his eyes no matter how hard he pushes his palms into them. Cas’s smile, his tears, his wide eyes, the press of his hand to Dean’s shoulder, the bloodied mark left behind on the jacket still hung on the back of Dean’s door where it greets him every morning.
he can. Sam looks the most hesitant of them all, Jack somehow hiding all his emotions behind that serene mask he’s adopted, and Eileen is the one drawing it to their attention that they’ve come this far. Throwing everything away because Dean is terrified to enter the Empty would not only be a waste, but it would also guarantee that they’ll never see Cas again.
Dean can’t focus on what he says next. He sees Jack’s lips move, can hear Sam responding beside him, but he can’t hear a word as his heart thumps painfully loud in his ears and his mind grinds to a sudden and blank stop. Jack is looking at him, saying something directly
“No,” the Shadow says, voice ricocheting in the empty around, almost as if it’s purposely projecting it’s voice. “I will not allow it.” It comes around to lean back into Dean’s face. “If I let one go, I let them all go, and that simply won’t do.” It sighs. “And you have
“Yeah,” he grins, shaking his head at Miracle’s gusto. “Thought you might like that. Sammy isn’t the biggest fan of PB&J, but at least Cas has some taste. He practically lived on them when he was human for a while.” He laughs. “I really felt for him when he got his grace back. Said everything tasted like molecules after that.”
He leaves the kitchen, giving a sharp whistle and hoping Miracle knows what it means. It takes a moment until he hears the sound of the dog's claws clattering on the concrete, and by that point, he’s already scooped up the impala’s keys where they sit on the library table and headed towards the stairs.
Dean’s endured pain before, endured more than any human should in all the years he’s been alive and all the years he spent dead at the end of Alistair’s blades. He’s felt so damn much and yet nothing,
The dog practically jumps at the chance, and Dean has to make sure to hold one end so that Miracle doesn’t swallow the teaspoon whole.
“You’re stronger than I thought,” the Shadow coos, reaching out to knock Dean’s hand from it’s chest. “But know this, Dean Winchester.”
Sam quickly gets up, pushing back from Dean’s desk as his chair scrapes across the ground loudly and he moves to perch on the edge of Dean’s bed, his back pressing up against Dean’s knees. He reaches out and wraps his hand around Dean’s wrist, and Dean’s heart continues to thud painfully as he waits with bated breath.
He gnashes his teeth and shakes his head, choking on the tears as he pushes himself forward. Forcing the pain of each tortured step to the front of his mind, focusing as much as he can on that as he fixes his eyes on the rift. It’s getting closer, slowly but surely, and soon he’ll be able to reach it.
That’s exactly why Dean loves his brother, and he lets himself give Sam a small smile back. It feels foreign on his face, but it makes something in Sam’s eyes flash and his smile becomes a little less tense for a moment before he gets up and puts a reassuring hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Sam nods, brisk and sharp, before he dips the knife into the cauldron and pulls it out with the golden liquid dripping from the blade. He’s chanting again, rushed words in a language that Dean couldn’t possibly dream to understand, and he turns around to face the brick wall behind him.
The kid stands in the middle of the room forlornly as Dean rustles through his drawers and pulls out a mismatched set of pajamas. He looks like he’s trying to swallow back words, maybe another attempt to get out of staying, but Dean doesn’t give him any room to speak as he pushes the pajamas into Jack’s hands and steps out of the room.
Dean opens his mouth to respond, only to find that nothing comes out as he realises he’s not entirely sure how to answer Sam. It should be easy, just say he’s looking for ways to bring Cas home, but he finds that there is a whole lot more sitting beneath those simple words.
But then his phone is vibrating in his hand again and Dean knows it's time to go. It's time to fix this, to right this wrong. With a heavy deep breath, he stands back on his own two feet and swipes to accept the call, muttering Sam’s name with a raspy voice as he takes one last sweep of the room, eyes lingering briefly on the blank wall and cold floor.
But the real answer as to why now, the one that Dean isn’t so sure he wants to share, is that it took one look in the mirror after Sam and Eileen had left to see his sorry hungover ass looking back for him, holding a bottle of beer and looking like such a
I bite his skin a little harder and then draw up a wet line with my tongue until my lips wrap around his ear lobe. He does this thing again with his hips and I urge him to continue by pressing my hand firmer on his clammy back. I move with him and he's becoming more insistent. An angel of the Lord's rubbing against me like a hooker, holy shit, I can't believe it. Just thinking about it, I smirk and I let go of his ear lobe to kiss him again, but softly this time, to calm him down. Cas learns fast – he's kissing me slower now, with a tenderness that looks like devotion, and I shiver.
would do such a thing. We are not like Humans who take pleasure in killing each others for selfish and futile reasons. We are superior, loyal, and we always act in the group's interests and for the Mission. But looking now into his eyes blazing with rage, I'm not so sure of it.
Let's leave aside the part about the Reapers choosing their own names, that's not what I'm really interested about. A missing Reaper is a sign I've been expecting since the Garrison came back from Hell. One of the 666 seals requires the ritual sacrifice of two Reapers at the winter solstice.
Anael knows the orders and rules. As General of the Garrison, him of all Angels knows this. Yet he seems to take the Humans’ matters a bit too personally. Once the human children are born and taken away, I will inform Raphael of his delusion.
Benny's voice tears me off my thoughts. I remove my feet from the stream and I slip on my socks, then my shoes.
That’s fine with me. This mission doesn’t require talking. So I just ignore him and we both go back to work in silence.
Unable to hold his glare or the grim echo of my own doubts in his voice, I turn away, clasping my wings so tightly behind my back that it aches.
I open my mouth to answer, when I hear the roar of a motor getting louder and louder, until we see through the window the Winchester's black vehicle parking in front of the building.
He spat the Lord's sacred name like a curse and I snap my eyes up, my Grace ablaze with rage-infused indignation. The blasphemy makes my wings stiffen behind my back - but as soon as I meet his gaze, the holy wrath gives way to sourness and shame.
Gabriel and Raphael are surrounding Lucifer, and I notice Michael inside his human vessel standing on the palm of Raphael’s hand. Cain’s body is shivering violently, still consumed by flickering flames, and Michael looks like he’s trying – and failing – to heal his host. His blurred wings are no longer white, now they look like they’re made of fire and embers. Obviously Balthazar was wrong: the son of Adam and Eve is unable to contain the most powerful Archangel.
I stare straight ahead again and shove my hands into my pockets as a metallic rattle unlocks the door. I feel empty.
From our position, we follow the march of men armed with spears holding burning torches, which form a long snake of fire slithering in the darkness. Judas is leading them to the garden of Gethsemane where Jesus and his apostles are gathered, and he tells them in a low voice that they will have to arrest the one he will be embracing, for he will be the one they are looking for.
I wrap Jimmy's soul with my Grace to shut out his feelings and memories until nothing filters through, and I spread my wings as I turn the corner. A simple flap is enough to launch me in the blink of an eye to my destination.
I briefly wash my socks and wring them out the best I can while laughing.With each twisting, a grayish liquid – sock's juice – drips from the grated cloth.
"You have tested me and thrown me every which way. And I have never asked for anything. Not a damn thing." I look up to meet Dean's eyes - his imploring gaze is vibrant with anguish. "But now I'm asking." His breath blows steam in the cold air. "I need your help. Please."
"We did commit treason," he admits quietly. "That's true. And for what it's worth, Castiel, there isn't a day when I don't regret the decision I made to say yes to Uriel. Not because I betrayed you, not even because our brothers died, but because I lost sight of our true purpose." He runs a hand over his face and beard, sighing as he gestures to the rest of the Garrison. "They are not as much to blame as Zedekiel, Rachel, and I. They have only recently been transferred to our ranks. We, the original Garrison, were created by God for the sole purpose of protecting Humans. We should never have forgotten that. Never. And there is nothing we can do to change that."
Anael is standing in front of us, his hands resting on the table while he waits for the latecomers to arrive. Camael then Miz appear and settle on their seats. Once we're all here, Anael's serious gaze focuses on us.
She yanks her blade from our brother's neck and steps back to watch him collapse right in front of me. She takes a few steps to join me and stands by my side while Uriel, lying motionless on the floor, stares up at the ceiling with wide, horrified eyes - a bloodied gurgle rises from his throat.
I reach out to them and they flinch, clinging to each other in terror. Just like Adam and Eve did in the past, when the Garden of Eden was ripped off from Earth. I brush two fingers against their foreheads and all physical damage disappears from their bodies and from mine, and all our clothes are clean and undamaged again.
She comes to a halt near the stacked wooden pallets, her fingers running over the book's leather binding that lies there, then turns to me, a wan smile on her lips.
My older brother's voice rises with gentle, pensive intonations. He leans against the back of the bench as I glance sternly at him. His head is tilted back and he's gazing up at the gray sky where dark clouds are slowly drifting away.
This is all because of my superiors and the Council who mistake my compassion for the Winchester brothers and specifically Dean for something much bigger and condemning.
I'm standing in front of a barn door. This is where the summoning comes from, and I can distinctly hear the righteous man's voice through the walls.
On the desk lies the blade of my dead brother - the blade he never once tried to use against me. He could have killed me at any moment, he had the upper hand. Why didn't he just slay me like he did to Levanael, Pmox, Miz or Ephra?
"He is merely suspended for the time of the investigation. Unless charges are proven against him, he keeps his rank."
"Be quiet, traitor!" Raphael hisses. "You more than anyone know why we can't do that. Adam's soul has been consumed to bring Lucifer back, Eve's soul has merged with the Mother of All, and the Reapers never found Cain's anywhere."
Dean has a hard time with the concept of destiny and our visit to the past clearly failed to make him see that no matter what he does, no matter how hard he tries, he will always end up triggering the very events he was trying to prevent.
But then he hears it, the faint sound of wings followed by the bed dipping with the weight of someone sitting beside him, and Dean can’t open his eyes fast enough as he turns to see-
Dean can’t breathe all of a sudden, Sam’s words hammer over and over in his head as he feels his shoulders start to shake. He glances at Eileen, trying to stall for time maybe, but Eileen just smiles softly at him. “It’s okay, Dean,” she says as she reaches out and covers his hand with one of her own.
Making himself visible to their eyes, the Archangel is towering over the Humans, radiating with light and power.
With a wave of my hand, I draw a cloth-covered cart from the shadows. One wheel is squeaking grimly as it rolls toward the righteous man, who wordlessly extends his hand to catch it.
But out of all Paradises, however magnificent and shimmering they may be, this one is by far my favorite. Although simple, it radiates a sense of peace and quiet joy that I like very much. The park grass is soft under my feet, a warm breeze makes the kite hover in the blue sky. While the Human is alone in his Paradise, there are still sounds of life filtering in the background. Children laughing, indistinct voices, the clear gurgling of a fountain... Feeling at peace, I let my eyes drop shut, basking in the sun's warmth.
I cast him a warning glance. Has he forgotten what Michael said when we all bowed down before Adam and Eve? Father created Humans in His own image. To insult them is to insult the Lord.
My brothers and I have been created to be God's weapons, shaped to be warriors, while the Sisters of Fate are slender and have this look of wisdom and ingenuity. We might look similar, but I don't think they really are Angels.
"Good!" he says brightly "The first thing you need to know is that this Apocalypse has been planned for quite some time - since the day Lucifer was thrown into the Cage by the Archangels, to be specific. Sam and Dean were born solely to bring about the Apocalypse and to be vessels for Michael and Lucifer. There will be peace and harmony on Earth and in Heaven only when Michael has defeated the Devil, who will never inspire rebellions like Uriel's again, to name just one. There will be no Hell anymore. No demons. The Garden of Eden will flourish again and it will be Heaven on Earth as it used to be. Creation will no longer be divided into three worlds. We will all be united."
"What Cas means is, we would be much more efficient if we could bypass paperwork in case of emergency," Uriel shrugs.
The Archangel gazes down at the sleeping city where only a few monsters and Humans are still wandering through the streets.
"Jesus doesn’t know that," I say in a neutral tone. "All he knows about Heaven is what the hierarchy has instructed us to pass on to him through dreams."
For I have learned to love these flawed and unpredictable beings, their works of art, their courage and their bonds of family and love. I don't want to see the most precious piece of creation destroyed.
Time seems to freeze as I tumble into these blue eyes invading my vision. My body dissolves, my wings melt behind my back, and suddenly I can't see or hear anything. There is nothing except the sensation of falling into the void.
"We're too close to the city, and I can't guarantee that her eyes won't burn out of her head. These little things are so fragile. Just try to talk to her by whispering softly into her reality plane. It's all in the dosing."
Before I can think of an explanation that Humans might understand, Uriel steps forward, losing his nerve.
Unexpectedly, Uriel bursts out laughing, slams his hand on my shoulder and wraps one of his wings around me. He hasn't been so affectionate for a long time.
"For real?" She straightens her back and smooths down the folds of her regular outfit. "I should have guessed. Well, I'm the one who held a Winchester soul before you made it cool. More than one Winchester soul, in fact, I beat you to it!"
Surprisingly, Sam doesn’t launch straight into it though. Instead, he moves into the room and takes a seat at Dean’s desk, straddling the chair as he faces Dean with the bottle of whiskey held in a white-knuckled hand. Dean drops his gaze at the sight.
He tries not to think of who else normally sits there, just grits his teeth and focuses on the blare of Led Zepplin as it plays and how tight his hands feel around the steering wheel.
feet, looking just as judgemental, and Dean mutters something about him being a traitor under his breath.
Dean reaches up to press his hand to it, remembering when it was bright red and stuck out every time he looked at it in the mirror. It’s just a silvery mark now, a faded scar, but Dean still feels a shiver roll down his spine every time he touches it.
, beating against his ribcage, desperate to come out. Dean can barely deal with the pain of Cas not coming back, let alone all those difficult feelings he knows are festering deep down just waiting to crawl out and bear his soul to the world.
Almost reluctantly, Sam turns his attention back to Dean, that smile slowly disappearing. “We haven’t decided yet.”
Miracle is of no help, just lolls out his tongue as he gazes up at Dean. Dean huffs as he scratches the dog’s ears before he steps into the room, eyes roving over all the different bookcases. There is a system but for now it's all a little overwhelming. Sam’s laptop is sitting on one of the tables though and Dean makes a beeline for it as he sinks into one of the chairs and pulls the laptop close to him, moving his legs to the side as Miracle slides under the table and settles into his bed Dean had put there for this very reason.
Even the rift is gone, and that is more unsettling than anything else. Dean had expected that would still be shimmering away and act as a beacon to point him in the direction of home, but it's been swallowed up somewhere and it leaves his stomach rolling unpleasantly.
Dean keeps a straight face somehow, even as he feels a flare of anger at the mention of Jack. It’s nothing though, nothing he should be focusing on, especially since it gives him an idea. He knew it wouldn’t be easy to get Cas out of here, and he braces himself for what he’s about to do.
Eileen’s eyebrows go up. “That’s not fair on Miracle,” she points out, and she’s right. “Plus you need the break.”
It barely moves though, and Dean doesn’t hold back in stepping forward and wrapping his hands around his brothers. Together, with agonising slow movements as they pour all their strength into it, the blade cuts through the snag and a golden rift starts to open in its wake.
Going back even a month ago, he wouldn’t have even hesitated in buying it. It’s a gaudy pink, glitter in the grooves where the stitching is, and Dean would’ve been filled with glee to put it on Miracle and prance him in front of the others. Sam would’ve groaned and hung his head in his hands but Cas would’ve just looked delightfully confused and done that slight head tilt as he’d narrowed his eyes and…
Sam shakes his head. “Dean, I don’t think you’re in the right space at the moment to be left on your own.”
The cassette is still in his pocket, loose in his jeans, and Dean reluctantly draws it out. It’s the last piece of Cas he has and, while he doesn’t know how it will be used in the spell, he knows that it will most likely be destroyed. He rotates it in his hands, scratching the pads of his thumbs over the worn plastic, the gouges from the constant insertion and removal into cassette players, and he closes his eyes as he thinks of Cas.
It does take him past Sam’s though, and Dean can’t say no when his brother insists on Dean at least having meals with him and Eileen if he’s doing to spend so much time by himself. He doesn’t say much throughout the breakfasts and dinners, just watches as Sam and Eileen sign at each other when they realise Dean won’t be drawn into their conversations. He thinks he’s starting to pick up on what some signs mean, especially what he’s pretty sure is his
Dean lets go of the photo with one hand to reach up and grasp Jack’s elbow, stopping him from moving forward and Jack’s eyes jump to Dean’s in surprise. “Remember what Cas has always said, Jack,” Dean says, shaking his head. “You sell yourself short. You know more than you think.”
Dean hesitates for a moment before he rolls his shoulders and answers. “He said that there might be a way to bring Cas back somewhere in all these books,” he explains, and Sam’s eyebrows go up.
Now isn’t the time to be thinking about all of this, he tells himself. Now is the moment to go back and read those last few books and hope to every single deity out there that there will be something written in all those pages that there is a way of bringing Cas back.
“I can explain?” Dean tries, reaching up to scratch a hand through his greasy hair and grimacing at how grimy it feels to touch. He’d forgotten to have a shower that morning, not that he’s remembered to have them at all recently, but this time he was too busy returning back to the library after his late-night power nap.
He pulls back just briefly, breathing heavily. “Cas,” he murmurs, but Cas just makes a small wounded noise and Dean can’t help but grin as he leans back in, parting Cas’s lips with his own and delighting in the way Cas’s hand scrabbles on his back, settles on his hip.
So the next time Dean is left alone in the bunker, he finds himself standing outside Cas’s room with one hand pressed against the door and the other wrapped around the door handle.
as he tilts his head back and clutches his chest, as Cas grumbles something under his breath and shoves at Dean until he falls down onto his back beside him, as he laughs even more while Cas pouts and crosses his arms in surly silence.
Then Miracle brushes past and pushes against the door, hard enough that the handle pulls from Dean’s grip as the door swings wide open. Dean drops his eyes as Miracle walks into the room and he shakes his head as he quickly follows to flick on the lights as the dog makes a beeline towards the bed.
“Call Eileen,” he says, voice loud enough to carry down to Sam. “Life is too short for more excuses, Sammy.”
Dean clears his throat and looks at Eileen, finding it easier to keep her gaze instead of Sam’s right now. “He told me that he, ah,” he pauses, swallows thickly, “that he loved me.”
else to focus on. He picks two different toys, one meant for chewing and the other for tug of war since he’s unsure of how Miracle likes to play and grins as he finds a throwing stick with a set of tennis balls. There’s not much of a selection of dog beds, but there’s one that will fit perfectly under the library table so he doesn’t hesitate in adding it to the trolley followed by a soft green blanket with black paw prints on it.
He begins with entering in the same words Sam has done and scrolling through text after text in hopes of there being
Jack frowns at him before he moves slowly into his room, hands clasped behind his back as he goes. “Sorry,” he awkwardly says, looking hesitant. “I thought Sam told you he’d called for me.”
“I promised to be hands-off, Dean,” Jack interrupts, not meeting Dean’s eyes and focusing entirely on Miracle, “and I intend to keep that promise. However, if someone were to really need my help, maybe need a ‘jump start’, then it would be…
“It’s not…” Jack shakes his head. “I don’t mean to be ungrateful but this- this isn’t what I wanted for myself.”
We need to hurry. The righteous man has been subjected to the worst torments of Hell for almost ten years now, and we have to find him before he breaks. Unless he has already failed…
He gets up and switches the device off before he wearily rubs his eyes. And reopens them wide when the screen immediately switches back on.
The same solid gold columns, towering and melting into the overflowing light. Wings folded behind my back, I look down in fear to the ring of fire surrounding me. Its fiery reflection in the marble floor doesn't match the flickering rhythm of the flames - as though it's dissociated from their time course - and sometimes it even fades out altogether. My own reflection only emerges sporadically, displaying a faceless, light-fracked version of my vessel. There are countless shadows slithering all around on the ground, but so fleetingly that I can't get a good look at them, they remain lurking at the edge of my eyesight.
I come to a halt in front of the open door of the room, and stare for a while at Dean's unconscious figure, wired with tubes that keep him alive. Sitting at his bedside, Sam looks up when he sees me, and I motion to him to follow me.
I try not to think that He could have saved my soldiers and averted so many more tragedies by just intervening, and that He never did. The Lord works in mysterious ways. I know this. And no matter how many times I have reminded myself of this, never before has this sentence seemed so empty, now that I'm standing in front of my brothers' lifeless bodies.
I shut my eyes for a moment, praying, pleading to my Father. This war has already caused too many unnecessary sacrifices. All I can do is hope that the righteous man won't make me give the order to destroy this city. I have no desire to add the lives of these innocent people to my list of regrets and orders that I have reluctantly obeyed.
The fresh wound from my army's betrayal only grows more painful and I clench my fists as I struggle to keep a straight face.
We appear in a huge library immersed in deep silence. Countless rows of shelves stretch in the distance and disappear in a golden mist. When I look up, I am unable to tell how high they rise either. I reach out and brush a finger against the spine of a leather-bound book. Its title is carved in golden Enochian sigils. Something about the souls’ energy.
"Oh, hardly." Balthazar is smoothing down his wing. "Nothing much to worry about, just an upcoming Apocalypse."
I silently nod, oddly satisfied. Even if the hierarchy doesn't acknowledge my work, and Humanity will never come to know about the sacrifices that my Garrison has made, at least the righteous man will know about it.
The Garrison is severely affected. At this rate we will all perish, every single one of us. And the Humans along with us.
Sam's voice sounds weary as he brings his phone to his ear, phone that has been ringing only in his mind.
I know this is something that has to be done, and I know that my reaction is illogical - an insult to the memory of my brothers and sisters murdered by demons, and highly improper according to the hierarchy - but I can't contain the heat of my indignation and I resent my Father for allowing this injustice to happen.
"I really wish I could help, believe me. Budget and workforce have been assigned for the century. We made a big exception to the procedure already by providing you with two hundred of our best soldiers, and I'm still wading through all the paperwork it generated. There's only so much we can do for you. Don’t be greedy, Castiel."
I look up into the righteous man's shadowy dream. I remember vividly my elder brother, towering and radiant with light amidst the smoking ruins of Creation and the wandering souls of the exterminated Humans. How powerful he was. How beautiful. And I remember his words, how he threatened the Humans...
Finally, Anna turns to the righteous man, touching his arm and reaching out to press her lips against his. To see my sister, my General, once a Warrior of the Lord and fine strategist, stooping to such a human and primal action is a shock.
Weirdly enough, I feel unable to serve him Michael's version, and share my own thoughts instead. Because Samandriel is right about one thing. We are not capable of love or hatred, no matter what Cain's memories showed. Cain might have felt love for Camael, but the reverse is impossible.
. Covering such a distance takes dozens of seconds even if we hurry up, but it would seem like the Archangel did it in a split second, since he is already there when we finally reach the battlefield.
Blade in hand, my soldiers are trying to reach her, but they can't get close. It seems the energy thickens the air and repels us, while the sounds get heavier. Anna's figure is now blindingly bright and her outlines are fading into a radiant sphere. My Grace freezes as I watch her rip herself in half and utter a chilling scream. The kind of scream I haven't heard since Siosp died.
The Holy Rosary Church's artificial light is replaced by daylight when we step out. There is a blue sky striped with white clouds above Baltimore. Sister Abigail is shivering in the winter wind heavy with iodine, and wraps herself in a warm, thick coat. Walking around the cars parked in front of the church's pale stone facade, we cross the empty street to follow her from a good distance. I already know where she is heading. Like every day, she's going for a walk in Patterson Park, then she will attend charity events before going home to drink tea and read psalms.
The anger that has been growing inside me since Anna fled sets my Grace ablaze. While I have to put up with constant criticism from my superiors, I will not allow any kind of disrespect from my subordinates.
Balthazar raises his eyebrows mockingly and ignores my order to pour the sparkling golden liquid into two crystal flutes.
"Hearing that they were dead pained me. But I fear Fate is working against you. Apparently this Apocalypse has been written a long time ago. We all have our roles to play, but yours is most certainly the hardest to embrace."
"You have several options to approach them. Dreams are efficient, talking directly to them works too – even though it could slightly tickle their eardrums at first – but the rational part of their brain might lead them to believe this isn’t real, and you know better than anyone how quickly Humans start to panic. I have a few ones who thought they were losing their mind and ended up committing suicide or being murdered by their kin. Such a waste. But I’ll teach you how to « seduce » your own vessel during a training session when the time comes."
I slowly stand up and walk over to the Winchester brothers who are followed by Htmorda as their shadow, still invisible to mortal eyes. I'm instantly mesmerized by Sam's face. I hadn't yet had the chance to see him with my own eyes, face to face, in full light. Neither he nor any of the other children who had been contaminated by Azazel's blood. They all died before I could see them.
"Nothing. I will report the situation to our superior officers and then we wait for orders. Get back in position and keep me informed."
Let Dean know what's happening... Zachariah sounds like he thinks I've already failed. As if the war raging on Earth, in which my soldiers are fighting relentlessly, is doomed to be lost. As if we're nothing but pawns, and our efforts are a waste of time and energy.
"Oh, right." Zedekiel huffs. "Balthazar knows all the confidential bits and never tells us a single thing."
"Then lock me away. But I’m telling you, when the day comes you realize I was right…" His stormy blue eyes snap open, any trace of sadness washed away. "… you will be the ones to set me free. And together, we will bring the Apocalypse to wipe the Humans of the Earth."
"Honestly I don't even care that you want a female vessel. What bothers me, though, is that, of all the available vessels you'd set your sights on
Htmorda sounds uncomfortable, glancing nervously at Uriel. He looks uneasy too. This isn't like him.
I understand his frustration all too well, having suppressed it myself for so long. Dean is a creature of free will and it comes naturally to him to believe that he is free and that he can change fate. My Father granted Humanity free will - a beautiful and inspiring idea, but one that I've never seen prevail. Not once. Be it for Cain, Pharaoh or Judas, we as agents of Fate have always crushed, manipulated, subdued their will.
Dean's brother didn't bat an eyelid even though he's subduing one of Hell's most powerful demons like it's a bug in his hand. It took me hours of chanting and the combined power of three Angels just to capture him!
I push my aching Grace into my vessel's muscles and slowly rise to my feet to stare at the brother - the friend - I failed to save from himself, with my fallen sister standing beside me.
"We should have left your Human to rot in Hell, if you ask me," he growls angrily. "He keeps getting in our way when we're on mission. If it were up to me, I would drive his head into the ground to teach him to show respect in the presence of superior beings."
"We just got back from Pamela's funeral," Sam speaks more submissively, stepping in front of his older brother.
As Michael is talking and Gabriel staring in silence, Raphael reaches out to Lucifer hesitantly. There is in his eyes a silent supplication, a harrowing kind of vulnerability I had never seen before.
We head to the Apocalypse's epicenter. It is pure chaos. The ground is crawling with demons, monstrous red-eyed hounds and wandering souls Reapers are desperately trying to snatch from Lucifer's pawns' claws. They walk the Earth, ripping Humans apart and gutting them methodically like an unstoppable tidal wave. This is a purge. Looks like Lucifer is firmly determined to wipe Humans off the planet for real and resorting to drastic measures to achieve that.
The Three Wise Men are walking in a single file, drawing a trail of trampled grass behind them. The soft tones of my brothers' voices are echoing through my head as the wind blows ripples over the grass. Some are singing Father's praises with fierce devotion, while others speak of Camael and the new era that will open for us all. An era where, as it was in the past, there will be no Hell and no Heaven, and where we will all live united in the love of the Father.
A strain on my Grace. I can feel it thickening and congealing in my vessel, as my wings spread and become rigid in my back. A familiar sensation reminiscent of Azazel's drawling voice, of Camael's golden eyes so full of rage...
All of this has, apparently, been planned in high places for more than two thousand years. It is only my current rank and my new position as Guardian that allows me to be informed today, since I must protect Michael's vessel for the Apocalypse to come. I am bound to be deeply involved in the impending battle.
Anna's wings are twitching behind her back with barely repressed frustration. I haven' t seen her like this since the day Adam and Eve were born.
I might as well get back down to Earth. The sun has moved all the way through the sky. An entire day has gone by since I left the Winchester brothers in front of the hospital.
My eyes snap open. I am about to defend myself, but I see no trace of accusation in his eyes. He's looking at me with so much compassion and empathy that holding his gaze hurts.
I clench my fists and stifle the anger growing inside of me. I'm wasting precious time that I could have used to do something useful, like tracking down Anna and briefing the Garrison.
"You've changed as well, Castiel," Uriel’s voice cuts me short. "We all have. Those times are over and won't ever come back."
There are only a few more seals left to break before Lucifer is set free. After Uriel's death and his army's betrayal, Castiel feels his doubts growing when he finds out about the hierarchy's schemes and lies. He also hears that there is a rumor about the Garrison Angels being infected with free will from being in contact with Humans. Zachariah summons Castiel and reveals Heaven's true plans: Castiel was a key player in bringing about the Apocalypse and now he has to let the three remaining seals be broken. The last one is Lilith's death by Sam's hand and Castiel chooses to rebel when he finds out. He steals a book from the library containing the seal Camael used on Cain, and plans to do the same to Sam and Dean…
"Be quiet, Gabriel. If we use this seal on Cain, we won’t ever be able to find him again comes the day we do need him. I’d rather stock a weapon than just throw it away."
Anael appears by my side and stares down at the creatures that have come to look like some kind of weird apes loosing their hairs. They’ve learned how to walk on their hind legs as if to imitate us, and their brain has grown bigger along with their soul glowing brighter. From up here, they seem so tiny and insignificant, but still we watch every detail of their evolution.
Hester's mood visibly improved since our last talk, and he's getting almost pleasant with me. He even listens to my advices on how to proceed more efficiently with resurrection. But it is quite obvious that he's still very reluctant at the very idea of bringing Humans back to life.
The Angels' voices keep screaming imprecations, calling for rebellion. And suddenly, by hundreds, by thousands, they vanish as if they had never existed.
"Alright," I say, standing up from my chair. "I'm going to summon the Garrison to change the strategy to protect the seals, then send a unit to raid Hell while the enemy is weakened, and..."
"Lucifer. Stop thinking. All we have to do is to be obedient to our Father and never question His orders. For His orders
"If the Humans in Siosp's sector were to decide to build a tower, I'm willing to bet they would reach three hundred feet easily. Don't you think, Siosp?"
The flow of my brethren's whispers seeps into my Grace like warm honey, grounding me back and restoring the holy bond binding me to Heaven. Before us rises an old barn in the middle of the woods. Uriel's information was correct, judging by the black vehicle concealed in the vegetation, that I recognize as the property of the Winchesters.
"Sign. Quickly. We can’t transmit our request to the hierarchy without this form signed by at least three of my subordinates."
I halt just in front of the table, hesitant for a moment. What I am about to do is strictly forbidden without proper authorization from the hierarchy.
"Levanael, you can go back to your initial mission. Baradiel, make sure that Alastair is properly restrained in the trap. Don't say anything to Uriel or to the hierarchy, I want to inform them personally!"
It might be because Dean is Human and therefore could listen to me without judging what Angels see as a disgusting crime. Or it might be the weight on his shoulders that reminds me of my own.
"They have been swarming around for decades anyway, and we still haven't been ordered to take action," says Rzionr Nrzfm.
Balthazar remains unfazed and just glances at her cheerfully. "Oh, sweet Anna, you look just lovely in your meat suit!"
He doesn't make this contact last more than three seconds, folds his wings behind his back and silently turns away. I shove those thousand years old memories back and struggle to find some kind of control over the emotional turmoil roaring inside of me.
"I don't even like Humans, Hester." I look down to the human body I'm rebuilding. "I'm only following orders."
"Ecaop, no! Don't go!" Uriel calls out in vain. "Oh to hell with this! Get out of my way, just leave it to me!"
I withdraw my hand and straighten my back. Down at our feet on the tiny boat, half of the Humans have lost consciousness with their eye sockets empty and burned to ashes. The other ones were quick enough to bury their heads under a blanket and cover their ears.
"For a while now I could see you were letting emotions cloud your judgment, and for a stupid human maggot too. Why did you have to pick Dean Winchester over one of us? I refused to believe it but I should have reported you at my first suspicion, and for that I am sorry. Thankfully, we stopped you in time. You would definitely have been executed had you performed this seal like Camael did. We stopped your rebellion, which means you will stay alive."
Even centuries later, having returned an incomplete report to the hierarchy leaves me with an unpleasant sense of failure.
She stretches her wing to lead me to a dark corner between two seemingly endless shelves filled with books. Her true face glows in the golden shade as she faces me, staring at me with a stern look, her smile fading from her face.
I turn to Anael, like my brothers in arms, waiting for orders. When our General realizes that every soldier in the Garrison is staring at him expectantly, he squares his shoulders but remains silent.
And if I were to denounce them, they would undoubtedly be sent to rehabilitation or even executed, and I simply can't stand to have any more of my brothers die because of me.
Uriel nods and slowly steps towards the door, his aura lacking its usual energy, and his wings sagging behind his back.
The righteous man's voice sounds a little tense, but certainly not impressed. Obviously that wasn't enough. I focus on making every light in the vicinity burst out, and I slowly step forward as the wooden doors open wide before me with a sinister creaking sound. The shattered light bulbs are crackling and spraying sparks in the dark. The barn's inside is covered with protection or trapping markings, some of them intended for demons, pagan gods, or the Mother of All's creatures.
"It was a bit vague," says Rzionr Nrzfm in his childish and rather nasal voice, "but he did mention a female Human who has access to all of our plans and secrets."
She jumps between Brap and me, taking the full impact of the kick in the stomach. The music turns grand and epic, and the soul is still dancing, oblivious to anything happening, while Hester rushes in to support Levanael. Together they hurl themselves onto Brap in spite of my objections. Attacking an Angel as high-ranking as Brap will not be without consequences.
Giggling, the Cherubs release me much to my relief and fly in all directions, leaving us alone in a matter of seconds.
All eyes converge on us when we appear in the very same courtroom where Camael and I had been accused of treason. A heavy silence greets out late arrival. Michael’s cold eyes follow us as we join the rest of the Garrison in the stands facing the three Archangels.
Dean Winchester, once again, doesn't realize that what he doesn't see is just as real, sometimes even more so, than what he perceives through his five senses.
"God isn't real! I have never seen Him, and if He does exist, then He should manifest Himself at once to prove me wrong!"
With a silky rustle of wings Baradiel appears at my side. Radiant with light, he gazes down silently.
"Well," Zachariah says in a conciliatory tone. He crosses his fingers over his stomach contentedly, bobbing his head with a hint of a smile curving his lips. "You did have a traitor in your midst who was ruining your work, these things happen to even the best of us. Our Lord Himself failed to see Lucifer's disloyalty before he refused to bow down to Adam and Eve, didn't He? No one will hold this against you. I'll personally make sure of it with the Council. You are, after all, under my guidance."
I carefully raise a hand in front of my face, sensing the fluctuating and chaotic flow of time against my Grace protecting this artistic composition of bones, veins, articulations and flesh. I hold my breath and let my Grace slowly withdraw from my fingers, then from my entire hand down to my wrist. Instantly, the work of time's effects show on Jimmy's skin. From one moment to the next, as though touched by an invisible snake, part of the hand withers and decays, revealing bones that eventually turn to dust. And this, only to regenerate and grow back into the chubby hand of a child and then of an infant, then disappear entirely.
Her hair sways like a liquid halo around her head and there is a glowing-red and ancient sheen in her eyes. She’s wearing a white dress thrashing as though a strong wind were blowing, whereas the air is static, only weighed down by the fire's heat.
I step away from the counter and walk over to the jukebox which keeps playing music, then come to a halt, joining my hands behind my back.
I close my eyes and fervently pray to my Father. And like it has always been since my Creation, I receive no answer.
Hester's feathers are now ruffled and his eyes are positively murderous. He dramatically whirls around and grabs a soul into his clenched fist, back to ignoring me.
I spent hours making that trap. It wasn’t just an ordinary trap. It was perfectly designed for Alastair, impossible to break from the inside. I designed it myself using all my knowledge, using the finest and most precise Enochian there is.
Smiling, he ruffles my hair with the tip of his wing and flies away in a rustle of feathers, taking away the unwelcome batrachian.
"Well that's a bother. But you see, I'm not part of the Garrison… so guess what?" With a flick of his claws, he sends a soul flying away. "… I don't give a flying fuck!"
I am aware this is supposed to be a punishment. Being deprived of my sector that was my charge since forever is humiliating, but now I feel bonded to my brothers by something more than just the Mission.
He nods and nudges the book left on the floor with the tip of his foot, wrinkling his nose as if it were something filthy.
"Yes, please save them! Susan is pregnant but hasn't told Brian yet and I was really looking forward to it!"
The neon light paints the chairs and tables in red and blue. My Grace becomes fluid and I get my sensory efficiency back, making the music audible.
Anna is obviously trying hard to appear slightly more human, but her poor imitation of distress is a blatant failure. Her stance remains rigid and her voice is flat, which is not very convincing. It's quite awkward to watch, actually.
"So you finally decided to join me? You won't regret it, Cas. Believe me, I have had thousands of years to ponder this. I suspect the Council Angels or Archangels have usurped our Father's authority. Together we could find out what they are hiding from us, and find our Father..."
"Oh, don't take it the wrong way, Cassy! I would have carried you gently and reverently, like a newlywed bride."
Clearly, she has no intention of leaving, so I close the holy book with all the deference and respect it deserves. I need to be completely focused to pursue my reading and I can't do that with an intruder who keeps staring at me so insistently, her shoulder pressed against mine.
I will try to explain to him, despite the severe lack of Faith in his voice - and maybe he will understand how crucial his role is. How important everything that is happening right now is.
How can I take such a major decision when I don't know all the facts? Should I join Uriel and fight authority with no chance of success? I have no idea what is going on in the highest ranks of command, but even if our superiors did plan on destroying the Garrison to punish us for our failures, or to make the final battle between the Archangels happen faster, there is something amiss in this theory. Something I don't understand. Michael would
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Dean steps in. "Okay, I know she's wiretapping your angel chats or whatever, but it's no reason to gank her."
Without a word, the righteous man turns on his heels and strides to the door and I watch him as he slams it shut violently - the noise makes Chuck wince as he takes a gulp of alcohol to swallow his medicine. I give him a respectful nod in farewell, to which he replies with a small, frightened wave of the hand.
"I will notify you of our new strategy and your new stations in a few moments via the celestial channels," I conclude wearily "Dismissed."
And once again I guess I may have been speaking too low, since only the electronics seem to detect the sound of my voice. I squint and raise my voice very slightly. I can't make the mistake I made the first time. I have to keep my voice down.
Zachariah is gone in a flutter of wings and I throw a glance at Pmox who keeps his head lowered, looking sheepish and embarrassed. No matter how many times I've sent him to training sessions in the last twenty years, Pmox still is a mediocre soldier, not to mention his bad sense of direction. Miz is the only one not to show any sign of annoyance at his constant clumsiness.
I open my eyes wide when he wields his two blades and strikes down next to my shoulders. And this time I can't hold back the scream that bursts out of my throat as a searing pain rips through my ethereal wings, nailing them with the kind of excruciating pain I haven't felt in thousands of years.
I've said enough. I've completed my mission. I slowly spread my wings and they fill the hospital room, extending into the walls. There's nothing left for me to do here - I have to deal with an army of traitors and a war to save Dean from the probability I've just revealed to him. And I have to report back to Zachariah.
"What?" he says in a defensive tone. "II had a duty to report it, as you know. You did the same thing for Anna before she was rehabilitated, remember. I did it for your sake."
"I didn't think I would need it, but it turns out to be the only way for me to make contact with Dean Winchester. Due to the recent incident I reported, he knows my name, and is likely to summon me at any time. Without a vessel to contain me, I might cause him serious injury."
Benny joined me about a month ago. He's pretty useful to watch my back and seek out well informed monsters, but not a day goes by without him trying to make me give up on Cas. He's probably in a hurry to bleed innocents dry on the outworld. I can't stand those fucking bloodsuckers, and it's only because I have no other choice that I haven't chopped his head off already.
Dean comes back to his brother, unknowingly walking through my right wing. I fly away as silently as I can. Their voices fade out and I reappear in Wyoming, high up in the sky, which makes the city look small, expanding along the river.
"And Sam Winchester used his powers," I cut him short. "Zedekiel, you will give him a warning. The hierarchy is clear on that, he must no longer use the abilities of Azazel's blood."
"Castiel did not lie, it is indeed a seal that temporarily deprives any Angel around of his powers and sends him as far as possible on the planet. It is one of the sigils that have been forgiven because they are too dangerous and require human blood or a soul’s consumption."
Lined with black veins, the demon blooded boy's face is frequently twisting into an evil grin, his eyes hollowing into their sockets. But I do notice some improvement compared to the last time I saw him - now his human facial expressions are dominant. And at this moment they convey both indignation and dread.
