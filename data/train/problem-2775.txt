Raphael folded his arms along his chest, “You need someone to accompany you, Castiel!” He didn’t want to miss the best part of the job-
For the first time ever, he saw fear in the alphas eyes.
And apparently, so did the blue eyed man- judging by the darker blush that painted Cas cheeks. The shy blue eyed man nodded, “I’m ok with you guiding me, Dean”.
Shit.
The rest of the drive was filled in silence. It wasn’t long before they were parked outside a handsome white marbled mansion. All he could do when he turned the ignition off was whistle, “Wow. Neat.”
John stared at him with undeniable sympathy. “Oh son, I wish I knew what to say. But, son, pack duty requires a lot of sacrifice. A heir to the Winchester Pack title must be born”. He sadly added, “Castiel cannot give you an heir Dean. He is almost in his 30’s and omegas around that age become even more barren".
And every time, they would end up driving over the edge together. The alpha spurting his come onto the sheets below; whilst Castiel’s cock was gripped hard by Dean’s walls, preventing him from pulling out. He would join his lovers guttural moans as he emptied himself deep into Dean.
He was tempted to kiss the omegas bitten lips….but no! Barbarians didn’t kiss outsiders…they fucked hard!
Fuck! He needed to feel that hole clench and cum on his cock.
He couldn’t help but shiver lightly as the alphas hand somehow slipped underneath his material to creep up the inside of his thighs, tip of those thick fingers finding his heated moist sex. The alpha whispered gruffly while holding his stare, “how very boring, omega.”
Amongst all the excitement of Mary and John Winchester welcoming their son, Castiel stood there not knowing what to do, couldn’t even turn around to see Mary and John who had walked past him to hug their son. He startled  slightly when Gabe laid a gentle touch on his forearm, “Cassie, you ok bro?”
So yeah, big surprises when his little brother turned on the charm and made the short blonde omega before him swoon and blush. Cute.
He didn’t want to be near anyone right now.
Time to get things in here sorted. She was not going to let the Milton Pack alpha get away with these despicable crimes against omegas. Not as long as she’s living and breathing!
Yes, he still held a little skepticism in his heart and mind for his original pack, however, he still held onto the fact that whatever Michael and Heather said were nothing but true. There wasn’t a hint of lie on Michael and Heather’s wolf faces as they spilled the beans.
Hearing his momma only made him want to run over to her, and cuddle into her arms, so she could calm him with her soothing omega scent, her hugs and her soft hums that always lulled him off to sleep.
Neither he nor Dean had spoken much as they made their way back to the Winchester Pack encampment. Both were lost in deep thoughts it seemed, mulling over the surprising events and revelations they had just encounted.
He couldn't help but smile with all his baby teeth showing at grandma, grandpa and uncle Sammy, “Good morning grandma! Good morning grandpa! Good morning uncle Sammy!”
The alpha looked stone cold pissed and within an inch of morphing into his true wolf form. Where was John?
The omega shyly answered in a barely there voice, “I’m ok, Dean.”
The woman’s voice held emotion, but, was still filled with motherly love.
He commented,
Honestly, it was quite the revelation. No scratch that, it was like a massive bomb dropped out of nowhere.
It felt like he was in a dream. Where everything seemed too magical to be true. Where everyone looked at him with pure joy and pride. Where he was dressed in the most beautiful tailor made white suit, his dark hair ruffled yet tamed and glowing. Where Kaylen was in the most adorable white outfit, walking down the aisle ahead of him throwing beautiful pink flowers out of his little basket while giggling cutely.
He spared a glance at John and Mary Winchester, giving them a small nod before he jerked lightly at his big brothers arm, “Come on Gabe.”
They were now leaning their foreheads against each others, sharing their breaths. Their slow grind was slowly picking up speed.
He balked, “what!?” His eyes swept over his café patrons, as if trying to spot who was missing. And, now that he did check out the cafe, he noticed that there were quite a number of tables empty. He quickly shifted his focus back at Gabriel who was now aiming him an
The alpha again spoke with fondness, “His names Kaylen.”
He swears to God he can feel blood rushing to his face, the longer Castiel just stared at him- like he was trying to decipher him. The blue eyed man then released a small smile, suddenly looking flustered, “Well. I think Cas is fine”.
Mary saw the way Cas eyes fell down to his lap, hands cupped around knees, pulling his legs in a little. She glanced at John out of the corner of her eyes, the alpha caught her gaze and nodded, giving her the
“No probs Cap!”
Such was the life of a male omega.
. He asked, “do you mind if i guide you into the perfect position?” Christ his thoughts travelled to how naughty that sounded.
“And like I had mentioned earlier, she WAS my girlfriend.” Maybe, Cas didn’t hear him proper.
But, his heart cringed when he glanced into his brothers light brown eyes. It held
It wasn’t that he missed his family, no. It was more to do with the fact that he missed the warmth and comfort his alpha provided. He was provided a fully furnished room of his own and allowed his own space to get comfortable.
Castiel rolled his eyes, repeating, “So, you’re, SLEEPING with Sam Winchester and John has accepted it?”
“Dean?” Castiel walked in and stopped in his tracks when he saw Anna- and her obvious nakedness. Those blue eyes immediately turned icy cold and so did that gravelly voice, “what in the hell do you think you’re doing, Anna?” He walked towards Dean, inspecting his husband, “Are you ok, love?”
His high school crush. Who knew…
And he couldn’t refuse. He just couldn’t! So, he answered what his wolf and heart wanted. “Yes, Dean.” His voice had been the quietest he had ever heard, but, there was excitement underneath.
. Anyway, he wasn’t complaining and returned Cas hug, “Great! Now, you’re going to kick ass!”
For however stupid reason, her conclusion was sealed whenever Dean would bring Lisa over. Cas would slap on a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes, and say the hurting words
whenever we fought. But, we kept coming back to each other every damn time, because we were what each other needed, at the time. Jimmy was reckless, and, I was pissy. Bad combination!”
Castiel chuckled, “Of course I would love to come see the bees with you, Kaylen. It would be my pleasure.”
“What?”
The alphas words made him preen in delight and want to wrap himself snuggly around the wolf, rub his scent all over the wolf's body, however he felt himself in doubt still,
He nodded. He was kinda feeling excited that Dean was going to teach him a few things.
Are Dean and Lisa over?
Dean was watching with pride as his omega wolf got accepted by his pack. He was caught off guard when a tiny wolf pup pranced on his large paw, snarling and sinking his puppy teeth into his ankle. It wasn’t painful, more ticklish. The little pudgy pup rolled around on his back, tongue lolling out of his mouth, wiggling around between Dean’s paws. Those cute honey eyes smiling up at Dean.
A/N: Dean is 14 years old in this chapter. Cas is 10 years old. This is 5 years ahead from the time Cas was 5 years old.
” Yeah, she was one to get into things swift and sure, mostly because the boys already knew that there was a special bond that existed between them.
He was the perfect twin. He shrugged, not really meeting Dean’s eyes as he said, “Yeah Jimmy’s eyes reflected the beauty of the universe in them”. He feigned a chuckle, “Mine on the other hand, isn’t so…inspiring”.
The alpha shook his head, “No Cas. I won’t tell them. That’s between you and your alpha.” Then, the alpha was walking down the stairs.
The way Castiel looked up at him as if with stars in his eyes made everything a little more sweeter.
Lucifer tried to struggle, whining in pain as the grips on his biceps tightened. “This is a mistake!”
Till next year….the same thing, different year.
“We have witnesses. You brother Michael and his omega mate, Heather, are willing to testify.”
As long as trouble didn’t come knocking- all would be good.
Really being depressive and all. And it worried Charlie a lot. Today though, was not the day to ignore her; not after seeing Dean- 10 years after Jimmy’s funeral.
Cas had this beautiful twinkle in his blue eyes as he smiled. The man picked up his burger and commented, “And, maybe you can show me a few great takeout joints in Lawrence?” The man bit into his burger humming in delight and eyeing his cheese burger with adoration. “I swear this is like a bite of heaven”.
Gabe giggled and for once sounded happy. Yeah, hearing Gabriel happy was all that mattered right now.
In that Instant, time stood still.
Castiel rolled his eyes at his best friend’s antics. “What is it Gabe?”
He didn’t hesitate, jolting at the door knob, voice deep and growly as he barked, “Cas! Open the damn door! Now!”
Dean cupped Cas cheeks in both his palms, bringing the omegas head down to meet his lips in a quick wet kiss. The alpha met his omegas eyes, “I do, Cas. I seriously can’t be away from you any longer.”
Castiel felt pleasant tingles through his entire being. He nodded, “I love that nickname, Dean. Thank you”.
He closed his eyes and fell asleep to Dean’s words,
Cas is definitely stirring something up in Dean.
Sam watched on in fondness as Gabriel and Castiel laughed at whatever joke they shared. He nudged his brother on the shoulder, “It’s great to see them getting along huh? I’m glad they are both happy now, Dean.”
Thank you for your patience and I hope you enjoy!
Sammy smiled, “You’re getting wise in your old age, Dean.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Well, you haven't seen me transform yet, honey. I look pretty scary then".
two mates together.
John did not seem affected, the older alpha shrugged and stuffed his hands into the pockets of his slacks, “He will come through Dean. He needs to respect Winchester Pack traditions.”
Cas wrapped arms around himself- as if for comfort. The omega had slightly watery eyes as he turned to face
Castiel had had enough of Anna. He replied sharply, yanking her hair a little harder, “No Dean! I am tired of her trying to ruin my life!” He glared at a terrified Anna, “I told you that if you stepped out of line, I would throw you into the basement!” Cas kicked open the basement door and walked down the stairs with a frantic Anna. He tossed her onto the bed they kept in the basement, “now, you stay here! From tomorrow, you will eat here, you will use the basement bathroom, and you will only be out for a few hours to see the light of day….SUPERVISED!”
Gabe’s mate was favorable towards honeyed brown.
Castiel wrapped arms around his mate’s neck, sniffling and glancing into his mates glassy green eyes. He could see how well Dean was trying to mask his pain- apparently, he knew Dean all too well. He sniffled, “I just- thought of the miscarriage for a second there. I don’t know if you’d feel what I mean, but, it still pulls at my heartstrings to the point I’m in agonizing sadness”.
Alphas loved seeing their omegas running ahead, trying to tease them. And, he wanted this chase to last for long. Cas was a beautiful wolf- the perfect mate with the perfect stamina, in the eyes of his alpha wolf.
A/N: Again, for what must seem like the umpteenth time, I must apologize for posting up late. I really haven’t found time in the week days to do some writing, plus I’ve just somewhat lost focus.
There were so very few male omegas left nowadays. Hence, why the alpha barbarian kept him nearby for his hands, cock, mouth and eyes only.
Castiel walked in, eyes on the ground, a slight tinge of pink crawling up the omegas neck and cheeks. The omega stopped a meter before Dean, eyes carefully finding his. The omega smiled shyly and said, “I um- I couldn’t sleep.”
When they got out of the hug, he apologized, “Sorry Bobby. I had some settling in to do, before I got to meeting anyone. I did meet Sam a few days back and we’re having dinner with the parents tonight. You and Ellen are welcome to join us”.
Such was his life now.
. He felt
He felt slightly dizzy as the scent completely took over the air around him. A scent that made his heart pound in excitement and slight fear.
He added,
What the hell was he thinking!?
Even when he felt saddened and worried about his omegas degrading statement of being imperfect because of his limp. No, he didn’t care about his slight walking difficulty- well there was a story there that he’d like to find out and he did care- but, there was no imperfection. Not in his eyes.
. He took a step back, his voice trembling and his words uncaring of who was around to witness their exchange. He was tired of all this, he was tired of keeping this secret.
Dean turned his gaze unto him. The alphas green eyes held an inkling of irritation, along with an unknown fierceness, yet, the alphas face resembled a calm one. There was definitely this tightness in the alphas tone, as he replied with a shrug, “Whatever/ whoever makes you happy; makes me happy, Cas. So yeah, just drop it, ok.” The latter sounded like a warning.
He gasped, “Sweet Marge has visited Dean’s café!” Marge was their oldest café patron, in fact, the oldest, sweetest, old lady in Harmony, aged 80. He whined, “Oh Gabe. This is not good!”
A stout women in a cooking apron came walking out with enthusiasm. Her face lit up when she spotted Castiel. Her eyes drifted over the frail omega and her heart dropped, “oh must we feed you a lot, sweetness!” She asked, “How May I help you, Master Castiel?”
There is this heavy weight in his chest and the fear that John may not want anything to do with the Novak Pack. And, he wouldn’t blame the Winchester Pack alpha seeing as his main priority would be to secure the Winchester Pack from any form of harm. On the upside, he always viewed John to be an open minded, rule breaker and free thinker, so he hoped something good would come out of the discussions. He nodded,
He pulled his black leathered trench coat into himself, jogging over to his sweet ride. He ran his hand along the gleaming hood of his car. His eyes roamed for scratches or specks of dust.
He could hear Charlie’s barely audible gasp. He couldn’t blame her when his own heart started to beat erratically-
Next chapter is Dean POV🙂 and the zing....😛
The pout on Sammy’s face definitely said so.
He felt such pleasant warmth travel within him as the alpha spoke sweetly to him. Then, something else happened. His nose was assaulted by the mesmerizing scent of honey and whiskey. His alphas scent. His true alphas scent.
Dean smiled carefully, “He has, Cas”.
that Cas loved to talk to in the gardens. The bird usually sat on the branch of a small tree and sang along its reply to the little omega.
He wanted to reply,
Castiel instantly felt his blood boil. He hooked Raphael by the lapels of his jacket, growling, “Don't you ever speak of an omega in that manner again, runt! Show some respect!” He shoved the alpha away.
. He had to ask,
If her husband hadn’t spoken up, which is a massive IF that is, she would have instead and stalked up to the Milton Pack alpha and given him a slap across the cheek. What was even more painful was the revelation by the no good alpha himself on how he treated half breeds. As if the halfbreed was to blame for their very existence, and as if the halfbreed wasn’t a wolf. Half-breeds still transform the same as any pureblooded wolves.
The sight that greeted Dean was expected but heart aching. Castiel was slumped on the sofa, quietly staring at the wall before him with glassy eyes. Dean knew that his sweet mate had probably just finished crying before he got lost in his mind once more. It was honestly worrisome for Dean, which is why the first thing he did this morning before leaving to pick Anna was contact Castiel’s therapist, Missouri Moseley. Castiel had agreed to another appointment tomorrow early morning.
If only he knew what fate had in store, leading him down the path of rejection and heartache.
. He said in a displeasing tone, “who in the hell still drives that piece of scrap metal! Such blasphemy to be parked beside a beauty like baby!”
Cas grazed those lips gently across his, before pulling away with a big smile. The man carefully turned around in his arms- with the bee still being cuddled into the man’s chest. He instinctively wrapped his arms around Cas waist- both his palms rested flat on Cas tummy, while he enjoyed the snuggle of the blue eyed man’s back into his entire front chest and torso. He laid his chin lightly over Cas left shoulder, and, just stood there-  both lightly swaying side to side, as they glanced out over the waters of the glassy lake.
He smiled but didn’t open his eyes when he heard daddy saying, “Son.” He felt daddy’s warm hand touch his forehead, then he purred as daddy tickled his scalp with his big fingers. “Come on sweetheart. Time to get up and have breakfast. Grandma made your favorite today.”
Castiel nodded, “Sure Dean. I’ll be up soon.”
He suddenly felt safe.
, maybe, but OK!
Castiel shivered lightly when he felt Dean run a finger down the nape of his neck. He met the alphas green eyes over Gem’s head. The alpha smiled softly at him, mouthing an almost silent, “I’m sorry. He gets like this every evening before bedtime”.
And, Chuck Milton could whine all he liked from whatever wolf prison he was currently occupying for a very long time to come- so thankful to the high wolf council for acting swiftly and quickly.
Dean felt that this was escalating and not in a good way. This was definitely a catastrophe waiting to happen.
If that ever was a thing….
Honestly, he never really expected their relationship to last that long. At first, it was just a hook up or rebound sex. Then, rebound sex turned into late night booty calls, which then somehow led to dates and moving in after a year. It wasn’t until the 3rd year of their relationship that Dean noticed the controlling behavior and the abruptness. But, like a dumbass, he stayed.
“You look nice daddy.”
By instinct alone, he placed a palm on Cas mid back, gently guiding the man to the door. He was feeling relieved that Cas didn’t react negatively to his touch, instead, he could sense the man sinking back into his touch. He willed down his beating heart, letting loose a laugh and said, “Yup tiger! Soon, you’ll be chomping down on Lawrences’ finest burgers”.
Ash was the first to toast to him, “Here! Here! The great Dean is back!”
He chuckled at the man’s look of pure enthusiasm and renewed hunger. “oh yes I did, Dean”.
His body was not his own now and his wolf was the one calling the shots. The omega in him called out to its alpha mate- nagging and begging to be acknowledged. With heat running through his entire being, he nodded and answered with shivering breathlessness, “Please Dean.” He sounded as if he was pleading.
She already knew what he was here for.
But, the opportunity to go out and hunt at night was a chance for two lovers to meet.
As irksome as it felt; every time he visited his omega, his cravings to be buried in his true mate’s body escalated a little more than the last time. He couldn’t even bring himself to console and comfort his mate by touch, for fear of jumping the very young omega then and there.
The way Dean’s eyes lit up and the way the man smiled at him- showing him all that perfect white teeth, filled his chest with warmth. He would spend an eternity-
He was still trying to wrap his head around the whole ‘
He kept his vision to the ground, trying to will his beating heart and contain the heat in his cheeks, as he stood but a meter apart from his intended. He ignored the light purrs of his baby brother beside him, taking responsibility and greeting, “Hello Winchester’s. I am Castiel.”he gestured to his brother beside him, “And this is my brother, Gabriel.”
. But, he knew that Cassie would never hurt him. He asked, “So, Dean Winchester, eldest son of John Winchester, huh?”
was at the forefront of his mind. He itched to transform and run into the woods looking for these intruders.
He felt on top of the world.
a chance, not like the colleges rushed to give alpha Gabriel a chance to get out of their disgraceful fathers shadow.
Anyway, he was happy for Gabriel. His big brother deserved something good.
Pam continued, “Now come on, time to get you into a warm bath and then into this fine silk. You are invited to be part of the gathering tonight- it’s where most alphas show off their mates to be.”
, he supposes.
Gabe looked forward to meeting Castiel’s omega. He felt in his heart that his big brother’s omega and he would be great friends.
He ignored that weird feeling and decided to get moving. Time to get shit sorted with the accountant, so he could get on with his damn day.
Dean’s heart was literally skipping several beats as he came to stand still by the bottom stairs of the throne platform. He knew there was no use lying to his dad. He didn’t even have enough time to catch a shower and change into brand new clothes before the hunters could find him. He swallowed, “Um. Yes dad. I um- ran into a vampire and we- ahem- had an altercation". He somewhat lied through his teeth.
His eyes bugged out. “you what!? So, you’re dating the enemies brother!? How can that be good, Gabe!?”
The popular alpha stopped Lucifer from doing the horrible and all it took was a shove and glare at the other alpha. The young Winchester alpha growled and snatched back the picture from a smirking Lucifer, “Give it back, man! Not cool!”
“I AM YOUR TRUE MATE! I DESERVE TO KNOW WHY YOU’RE DOING THIS TO ME!”
Yeah he deserved Castiel’s hostility. But, he wasn’t going to stand here and be silent as to why he had to fuck Anna the moment he arrived. He bit back with quite a strong tone, “Omega, I have my reasons for doing what I have to, the moment I step foot here! Too young for you to understand!”
Every fiber of his being wanted him to chase after the distraught omega, and, that made him stand up from his seat. He was about to pursue when the authoritative voice of his alpha dad ordered without any waver, “Stop right there, son! Let him go!”
Castiel knew where Dean was coming from. They were going to return back to the Novak manor. The omega probably thought the worst.
He headed straight to the kitchen and pulled out a vase from the cupboards, aware of the eyes that lingered on him. He filled the vase with water and carefully slipped in the flowers, before finally meeting Dean’s green eyes from across the room- that were definitely focused on him- somewhere below his waist. He cleared his throat, “Um, where do you think I should put theses flowers, Dean?”
What would he make of this, because, if he was being true to himself; he was affected by Dean’s words- to the very soul.
He watched as Dean basically guzzled two huge slices of pie within minutes. He was feeling damn proud of himself that his date enjoyed the pastry. He was content with just sitting on the dining table a little while longer, staring at Dean or losing himself in those beautiful green orbs, while he sipped on wine, letting the red liquid fill him up with so much buzz.
He pulled his head slightly back, just enough to capture Cas starry blue eyes. He smiled warmly, thumbing at the man’s left cheek, “Cas, I am honored to be the one to give you your first kiss. And, I thought it was so perfect too.”
Last night, he saw a completely different side to Dean. A more relaxed, charming and carefree one. The deep crinkles in the corner of Dean’s eyes as the man barked out in laughter, was damn near heart melting. And, he found himself slowly slipping into the teen who had total ‘
passing between them. Then, mom held his other hand, squeezing lightly, “speak to us, sweetheart. Why did you need to divert you attention?”
His kid never missed meal time.
He felt a thousand times better.
Ok. The Anna relationship tag is explained here. Sam POV. Plus, a little light of hope in the dark.
. But, though Gabe always flirted, it was only heated friendly banter. Castiel was more like a little brother to him and that made him fiercely protective of his longtime friend. He said, “You know that Craven is going to be awakened soon?”
He cleared his throat, “Boys, what’s going on?”
. A storm brewing underneath that beauty.
I hope you enjoy this Dean POV!
On many full moon nights, the townsfolk could hear the eerie night howls of the forest wolves- the darkened almost black forests that were blanketed by the darkness night brings- was frightening to look at. What lurked in those dense forests under the moonlight and cover of night had most town wolves staying indoors come dusk. As if frightened that the forest wolves would jump out from behind those large trees or the shadows and snatch them off the streets.
He wanted to stay stubborn, but, he always liked Dean’s presents, so he reached out and accepted the the gift from Dean. He didn’t intend for their fingers to brush, but it did, and both couldn’t help but gasp at the tingling sensations crawling up their fingers and arms. He watched the alpha blush hard, clearing his throat.
Guy really didn’t want to see his bad side right now.
have been a shitty alpha.” Dean had tears pooling in his eyes, huffing out, “I shouldn’t have been so ignorant and distant. I should always be there for you and Sammy, whenever you needed me. Instead, I got my priorities messed up.” The alpha smiled sadly, “And, for that I am sorry…… Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?”
So, they didn’t waste any time.
As they passed a orchid filled meadow, he had a sense of déjà vu, like he’d been here before. Like he had run in these very fields with that
With a heavy heart, he watched Castiel walk away towards the direction of the field’s with a slump to his posture. So much for spending all his time, during his travels, getting to know his true mate.
humor, there was definitely
And he did meet that special someone 10 years ago, in his opinion at the most horrible of events- senior prom.
He didn’t miss how Castiel’s mouth thinned into a straight line, eyes narrowed and scanning him as if he were something foul. The little omega folded his arms along his chest, spitting out, “So, I suppose you’re coming to tell me that you’re leaving now. As usual, after a great night with Anna!” Castiel then tapped his lips and mockingly voicing out, “Hmm, oh yeah. And probably coming to give me another ‘
An alpha being single dad to an omega pup was quite the controversial topic of discussion within the pack territory. Many wolves would tell Dean to give the baby up for adoption because of the little ones omega status, and oh my, the way Dean reacted with ferocity, protectiveness, possessiveness and anger towards these wolves was enough to make them shut their mouths or nearly piss their pants. She was proud of her oldest because despite his fears of being a single dad, not once did he mention loving his son even less nor giving him up. Dean loved that little pup with his entire being and so did John, Sam and her.
But, that was for a time they would mate (if they mated). Now, they were
His back was turned to the bathroom door, eyes closed shut, when he heard it open. The immediate scent of apple pie was back in the air. He swallowed the lump in his throat, daring not to move an inch when he heard the drawers being pulled open and the ruffle of clothes.
He really hadn’t felt this high on giddiness before. It felt so amazing- like he was being swooped off his feet by a handsome prince. One who would promise him the world. Again, thinking such thoughts when he was around Dean- was really becoming common for him. But, with his fluttering heart, he didn’t mind. He was surely unable to contain his blush as he nodded and answered with a small smile of his own, “That sounds lovely, Dean. I look forward to lunch”. And, he damn well meant it.
He didn’t want Dean to hate him, most of all. It would absolutely wreck him. So, he had made up his mind last night. He would respect Dean and Lisa’s time together- even if it hurt him.
Castiel thumbed the tear that escaped his husband’s eye. “Oh baby, I know this is hard, but we will get through this together. There’s no pressure, we just need time to heal proper”.
“Cas?” Sam finally asked- a small smirk and curious hazel eyes were aimed at him.
since the mans teen years. An alpha that was kicked out of the Morningstar Pack due to his weakness.
Sam’s heart hurt further. Alphas didn’t like knowing that their omegas were feeling down and upset. He typed out a reply.
It was almost 7pm and he was already dressed in casual once again. This time, he wore a black button up (which was a few buttons open to reveal a little of his chest), blue jeans and black sneakers. This time, his hair was somewhat neatly styled and he was clean shaven.
There was complete silence between them. He felt a little put under the microscope, bare for everyone to see, as the omega tilted his head and took him in with deep thought. Jesus, he had never felt more nervous before. After some time, a genuine smile that touched the omegas eyes made itself known, the omega squeezing his hands lightly, “I would love to be your omega and angel, Dean Winchester.”
Oh so that’s how alluring he smelled to his alpha.
“Um Cassie, would you like to accompany me to the Annual Meet tonight? It’ll be fun!”
“Well, well, Cassie. Maybe I should leave you two alone”.
I hope you enjoy!
“Good night, son.” John replied with still so much calmness in his voice- yet, there was an unmistakable quiver of emotion wrapped in his tone.
Castiel blushed all the way to the tips of his ears and god damn it was adorable. The omegas shy blue eyes met his with a hint of enthusiasm. “Yes.”
But, again, he found himself staying mum, because, he just didn’t want to hurt the smiling man’s feelings. Cas feelings.
Cas shook his head, “N-No. B-But, I saw her- that red head slipping on a bra - behind you, while we were skyping, around 9 months back.”
to be happy about him and Bal. He slammed his cup down unto the wooden tea table before him. “Stop lying to me, Dean! I know
He shrugged, deciding to speak as honestly as he could. “Yeah, Cas. Lisa is
The alphas eyes met Cas teary ones,
His tears streamed down his cheeks, freely because no one could see. His heart ached and there was an empty feeling brewing in his chest- much more worse than when he had to reject his beloved mate 10 years ago.
She didn’t want that bond between Dean and Cas to become one of
He promised he wouldn’t cry on his big brother’s wedding day. But, seeing Castiel so happy…..smiling brightly….looking so beautiful and in love…made those tears he was trying to hold back come sliding down his cheeks.

The now 11 year old, in his worn out tunic, halted in his steps. Those beautiful blue eyes held so much devastation- much like he felt in his own heart. But he couldn’t, for his body was reacting of its own accord- his alpha was calling out for sexual satisfaction.
It was when the green eyed alpha handed him back his moms picture with the most charming smile that he knew he had fallen in love with his secret crush.
His parents would only send a very young Gabe to his room with a basin of antiseptic laced water and a damp cloth to get to dabbing the wounds on his back. In the case of his damaged knee, the doctor only told him ‘

A/N: Comments and kudos always inspire me!
Dean swallowed loudly, asking, “W-What do you mean dad?”
Butterflies. Yeah. Butterflies were in his tummy. Dean Winchester was in his apartment.
Oh how his heart did another flip. How could Cas be such a loving and caring omega after the crap he had threw at him? He rubbed Cas’ back in such gentleness, murmuring into the omegas sleep ruffled hair, “I’m ok Cas, I promise.” He then pulled out of the hug, to search the omegas face, smiling shakily at the teary blue eyed omega- feeling his heart break a little at the sight. He thumbed at the escaped tear from Cas right eye, “We need to talk, Cas.”
Dean grit his teeth, gripping the stirring wheel hard.
He swallowed again the lump in his throat, his heart jumped a little in excitement. He opened his eyes to the dark room, replying almost as quietly in his usual gruff voice, “Yeah Cas. I’m awake.”
Whatever this was, he was torn between feelings of anxiety and excitement. Surprisingly, more of the latter!
He was silent for a while, trying to catch any sly reactions from his brother.
He could practically see her mulling things over in her mind, before she asked, “We’re not talking about Dean Winchester…right? Because, if i remember correctly, he was the only one you had a secret crush on in high school.”
He watched as Dean flipped them around- sucking on Anna's right tit, while kneading the other. The alphas muscled ass was bouncing as the man slammed into Anna. His sister had her thighs spread wider, yelling and moaning as Dean drilled into her- harder and faster.
Cas preened. The omega seemed to lean his head closer to his, just touching the side of his face lightly.
But, then, Dean didn’t seem like he approved. He repeated Dean’s words without very much thought, “But……it’s not a good thing to be thinking of your little brother…um kissing and doing more stuff.....during ruts.”
It was silent for at least a few minutes, the air slightly tense as everyone took in the information presented. Eventually, it was Dean that broke the silence, saying, “What should we do, dad?”
She was an omega from the Braeden Pack. A pack located just to the south of the Winchester Pack.
He was getting freaken nervous as the silence stretched. Cas seem to be contemplating a thought, whilst shyly scratching the table with his index finger.
by the hands. The man groaned, “Red, come on! I can’t play pool, even to save my life!” However, the red head managed to get the man up and dragging his feet towards the pool tables.
“Mary”, He warned. It wouldn’t be nice to get their scents over someone else’s pup. It was something wolves kept sacred.
“Yeah! I’m ok with it!”
Except, this time, the bond was stronger.
Yeah, he definitely felt his body quiver deliciously under Dean’s touch.
He deserves something exciting and thrilling to cling on to.
He smiled sleepily and dug his fingers into the little omegas fur. His voice strained as he said, “Little omega, wake up. You’re suffocating me.” Though, he could push the omega off or roll onto his side, so that the omega fell unto the mattress;
“Blue Jay?”
Again, his attention was caught, and he tilted his head to the side as if curious. “Second most beautiful?”
He half heartedly wanted to just shove open his front door and run into his cabin- to safety, but, he couldn’t. His omegas curiosity was peaked. My God, he didn’t even think much of how, if he turned around, could mean his death if the alpha lurking in the dark was a rogue.
Daddy gestured to the blonde one with brown eyes that sat beside uncle Sammy, “This here is Gabriel Novak. He is Uncle Sammy’s future mate.”
Soon, he would call Dean his.
“Mhmm. And why is my nickname Blue?” Castiel was flattered but darn curious. He had a few ideas though.
Bal nodded, grabbing his bag too quickly, laying a swift peck on Cas cheek. “See you later, Castiel.” With that the alpha was skedaddling past Cas and Dean with his head lowered- eyes to the ground as a sign of submission.
And so, Dean pulled out more and sank in. This time both were crying out at how good it felt. The way Cas hole got more wet around him had him knowing that his omega was ready for a real fuck. So, he started with short thrusts and soon it went on to be longer thrusts that aimed to claim every part of that beautiful tight wet hole.
Him and words- aren’t very friendly. He rubbed the back of his neck, suddenly feeling a blush climb up his cheeks. He cleared his throat, speaking the truth. “Um- I was…um- hoping that we could refer to each other as boyfriends?”
Cas nodded, “Ok Dean. Come in.” He certainly missed Cas warmth as the omega stepped out of the hug to provide him room to enter.
He honestly felt a little hot now. He could feel his omega purring as it celebrated how the alpha was finally settled and happy. It was like Dean being happy was all the omega wanted. In fact, he wanted to see Dean smiling again and not yelling in pain. He couldn’t help but say, “You know, I dreamt of you a lot, this last week.”
, it didn’t.
Everything was the same; except for those eyes.
He rolled his eyes at the stupid voice of reason inside him.
Dean did his own unique thing for a first date and he was impressed. He laughed, he blushed, and he felt immense joy. That was all he needed.
Castiel watched on in fascination. His heart melting at the adorable relationship between his alpha and the tiny, hyperactive pup. Dean spared him a glance,
Castiel POV
And he knew that his feelings had everything to do with the way Dean seemed distant. It was like the alpha had completely shut him off- because, at this moment, he couldn’t feel the beast within Dean, nor could his omega.
“I should say that I do not like to be fooled alpha.”
The tall alpha all but smiled so sweetly at him, uttering in the most soothing tone, “Hello precious. I’m Sam Winchester.” Sam reached out and brought his hand to those soft pink lips, laying a tender peck on the back of his palm. “And, you are?”
brotherly.” Dean chuckled, but, he looked a little nervous as he added, “No changes there. We are growing stronger as brothers.” A little on the oversharing side.
That would make him feel better.
A horrendous injustice!
At one point, Castiel was distractedly enjoying the feel of his alphas fingers massaging the nap of his neck. Too distracted that he was caught off guard when Gem asked, “Don’t you think butterflies are cute, Blue?”
Everything else around them became background noise or non existent. He found his focus drifting downwards to Cas pink lips.
Tomorrow brings Dean to the here and now. And it’s even more worse. While his broken beloved was at home, he was parked outside the council chambers- ordered by the council to pick Anna up. It was as if the council wanted him to quickly get to forming a bond with Anna- which he had to remind himself that maybe they were. And that only pissed him off further.
He hadn’t realized that his tears were streaming down his face until he heard the omega within him give out an involuntary whimper of sadness. He couldn’t do anything as he sat there, in the grass, at the edge of the top of his hill, watching and knowing that nothing good would ever come.
When he hugged his mom and dad at the engagement party, he caught a familiar alluring scent, the same one he had caught 10 years ago on that dance-floor. A scent that made his heart thump hard and his alpha wolf weak in the knees. A scent he dreamt of every night at the Training Institution, one that was able to calm him at any time of need.
And for some reason, he knew, this is exactly what Cas needed right now. To feel the presence of his alpha, to know this is all real and that he is loved.
, he could wish nothing bad upon Sam. The Winchester Omega was nothing but kind and welcoming to him.
Dean eyes flew open. He wished he hadn’t sat up so fast as his world started spinning and he felt like heaving all his contents onto the floor of the car. His stomach cramped and he gripped it tight, groaning. He didn’t hear the rumble nor feel the vibrations of the car anymore. It had come to a slow halt. Then he heard that same foreign gravelly voice, “Dean. Tell me what’s wrong. Should I take you to the hospital?”
Dean swallowed the thickness in his throat, wiping away the tears that sneaked out of his eyes. It hurt him so much to be the one to break Castiel’s heart, but right now, he didn’t have a choice.
He knew he had to go see Cas.
He was certain that he may not get along with
. The omega sounded irritated as he spoke,
He was going to meet Dean again today, as the man will return his contract. He is hoping that all is well with the work conditions and requirements. He really didn’t want to be dealing with a dissatisfied Dean today.
He found himself getting breathless, so he stopped in his tracks. He feared to move further; so from a meter away, he asked, “Momma. What’s wrong with Dean? Is he sick?”
Dean smiled at finally finding out his possible mates name. All he could do was shyly utter, “Cas”.
Castiel studied his lovers beautiful grass green eyes, those long lashes, that freckled face, that 3 day old scruff and that full, inviting lips. He ran his hand up Dean’s bicep, commenting, “You know, for a werewolf, you don’t look so scary".
off or shutting down, Cas responded with a starry eyed look (which he was pretty damn sure the omega didn’t really realize), “I miss running beside you too, alpha.”
In the dark, barely lit, stone walled bedrooms, Dean would destroy his
Anna this time targeted the distracted alpha. “Prince Dean! Tell him to return to sleep!” Her voice was sharp and impatient. It was irritating, however, it was enough to get Dean snapping back to reality.
moment; a
I’m so sorry for the delay in update. I had hit a writers block with this fic! I hope you enjoy though! 🙂
Cas hummed, “Mhmm”. He took that as a good sign.
Samuel instructed the bodyguards, “keep your eye out on Sam”. He followed behind the bodyguard that carried his useless omega grandson, Dean.
He enjoyed the comfort of Dean’s chesty purrs. It rattled his body and pleased his omega wolf. Despite all that was going on- he felt blanketed in safety and love, at this moment. That’s all he needed from Dean.
He heard moans and groans of a woman and man engaged in sex. He could smell  the scent of arousal and hear the slap of skin on skin- all coming from his humble family home.
“Like the crystal blue waters in the shallows of the Pacific Oceans”.
Sam itched to stomp over to the Milton’s and give that no good Lucifer a punch and a piece of mind. Damn did it take all his willpower not to. He didn’t want to make anything worse. Not for Gabe and not for Dean and Castiel too. With trembling hands he typed out a reply.
And my was he met with a heart stopping sight.
A/N: I'm sorry that I couldn't update in the last few days, as I have been quite busy at work. Its the weekend, so I had time to write up a chapter for you lovelies.
John met Michael’s wolf eyes,
Just as he was about to turn around, a hand gently gripped his forearm. He gasped as he felt that slight tingling spark travel up his arm, his heart a drumbeat in his ears. He met the alphas calm green eyes with slight question. The alpha shook his head, green eyes pleading as the handsome strong jawed man uttered almost intimately, “Don’t leave me, omega. You have in no way offended me.” The hand then released his arm, leaving a pleasant warmth in its place.
Cas pried his other eyelid open, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, before smiling at him. The little omega telepathically replied,
And behind John stood four other wiser older looking wolves and even more awesome was Sam who stood by Gabe and a good 30 or so Winchester warrior wolves. All looking ready to maim and kill for the protection of their own.
No way was he going to let the heartlessness of one pathetic pack alpha ruin the happiness and love of his children- no matter who they choose to be with. His eyes were soft as he met his youngest son’s fearful hazel eyes, placing a hand on his sons and squeezing lightly, “Listen here, Sammy. I know that it’s a lot to take in and I’m sorry it has come to this. Maybe, Gabe deserves to know the truth about his father and I’ll leave that for you to decide, but, at the same time, both of you need to be careful.” Sam nodded his head, so he continued, “You also need to limit your time spent at Gabe’s for both your sakes. Lay low and off the radar until everything mulls over and Lucifer gets his comeuppance. Is this understood, son?”
Whatever it was, he needed to get back to bed.
Dean approached the sofa quietly, “babe”. He carefully sat down by his vulnerable mates side, laying a hand on Cas ones that were rested atop his thigh. Castiel turned those lifeless and drained eyes at him- and damn, Dean couldn’t hold back his tears, feeling it pool in his eyes. Then Cas broken scratchy voice responded but almost sounding void of any feelings and emotions.
Sam and he were going to attend the event together. At least his brother was going to be there- searching too.
Gabriel knew that this was a dangerous game, but, he really only had one option
Cas stood his ground, nearly eye leveled with him, “Dean, behind me is my boyfriend, Balthazar. He is an alpha, who I have been dating for nearly 8 months now! And, we were in my room, spending some quality
He couldn’t help the bubbling of happiness in his chest, meeting his baby brothers smiling hazel eyes, “Yeah Sammy. It’s falling into place.”
“I miss Dean, momma!” His tears started to flow heavily now.
The omega was in the middle of kneading the dough for the pastry, when he heard the front door to their home open. He could already smell the familiar scent belonging to his alpha-
10 years later, after jolting awake from another saddened dream- he asked why? Why did he have to be the one that found his brother? He rubbed a hand down his face, peering into the darkness of his room. He spared a glance at his digital clock sitting on his nightstand, seeing it read 4:00am and murmured, “I need a glass of water”.
He was 17, and, definitely turning heads. Who knew that once he bloomed after his first heat, at 16, that alphas eyes would be on him.
Again, the choice was Cas’s too. Dean was not going to force Cas into anything he felt uncomfortable doing. He wasn’t a controlling alpha and believed in balance.
Before he could process Cas words, the white wolf was sprinting away, leaping above the underbrushes and taking off into forests.
Damn was he getting hot under the collar. Then, he somewhat picked up on what Dean had said.
He smiled faintly, before his eyes met the ground- pinching the grass out with his fingers. He didn’t even want to look up at the Jay Bird that sat on the little tree branch.
He usually sat on his lonely porch, watching how all the pretty pure bred omega wolves of the Milton Pack would beautify themselves for tonight’s event; trying on eye-catching dresses or suits, getting their hair and makeup done. And secretly, he wished that he was one of those pretty pure bred wolves who were so excited to meet THE ONE. It was times like these that he loathed his tainted blood.
His heart sped up,
And he didn’t have to ask.
Well, after the way Dean roughed him up last night during sex, draining him despite his tiredness, what did he expect? He should be expecting that Dean would treat him horribly, rare male omega status be damned.
Lisa had tears in her eyes. She stuck out a stubborn jaw, her own anger making her voice tremble as she belted out, “its Cas, isn’t it! That omega bitch is trying to act all innocent, but, he is an evil piece of shit that’s pushing us apart... He wants to have you! He wants to own you! I see it in his eyes!”
Comments and kudos are appreciated 😊
He smiled when he neared Cas door. He could smell the omegas apple pie scent as he reached the top of the stairs, which could only confirm that Cas was in his room. But, the nearer he got, the scent changed to include another foreign one, intermingled with Cas’s.
Rufus wanted to release a growl but instead sounded like a rusty broken piece of scrap metal squealing around here and there, with no business being on the roads except for the junk yard.
His eyes were wide open now and he was so super excited. “Wow, really! I love bees too! We have lots of them in grandma’s garden. You come see!?”
Yeah. Both believed that they could get away with this.
The only person who ever made him feel pleasant in his previous dark atmosphere, was his little brother, Sammy. Always with his jokes and tender loving care. He pulled himself out of the heart wrenching thoughts of his baby brother, giving in to his curiosity. “What do I smell like to you, alpha?”
There was a platter of meat, fruits and salad beside him when he woke up. He was also surprised to find that he was covered in an expensive midnight blue silk.
An alpha growls, you tuck tail and run.
He wanted to pounce at Cas and say
Gabe huffed, “That’s bullshit!”
He resisted the urge to throw up in his mouth.
He wondered where this talk would lead.
He adorned a
This time he carefully got up and stuck his hands into the front pockets of his jeans. “Um- thanks Cas, but, no I don’t have anything to discuss”.
Missouri tapped him lightly on the bicep, “You’re welcome sweetheart. Now, send your brother, Jimmy, my love, ok”. She added with a wink, “he is definitely watching over you, Castiel”.
He would make it up to Cas when he returned from his alpha lessons with dad.
His heart skipped several beats, eyes meeting Deans suddenly and equally curious ones. His alpha nodded reassuringly, coaxing him to ask the next question.
All Castiel could think was how much he owed to his Blue Jay friend. He smiled as he surrendered to the warmth of his alpha, whispering, “Good.”
Lisa screeched, tugging at her hair in frustration. “Fine!” Before she stomped away, she met Dean’s eyes, spitting out, “You’re a hopeless shit, Dean Winchester! That omega will be your downfall!” With those venomous parting words, she stomped off.
. Didn’t mean that it would hurt less, when the truth came out. He cleared the thickness in his throat, and of course, resorted to downgrading himself. “I um- yeah…I mostly kept to myself and stayed hidden. Um- more so, a hermit”.
The alphas or families these slaves were sold off to, were crude and practically dragged these omegas away, kicking and screaming, by the hairs on their heads. Once or twice, he tried to intervene but got slapped around by his bigger alpha brother, Michael. In all honesty, he had no power over his big brother or other family members- he was the lesser alpha.
. He was
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being patient with this fic and showing your constant support! You are my inspiration! Much ❤️
He pressed palms into his eyes, taking deep breaths. He couldn’t afford to have a breakdown now!
He let the alpha choke him and drag that delicious hard veiny cock in and out his hole, he felt every inch of the alpha- that firm pair of sacks hitting his ass so loud, slick wet sounds resonating into the air as a thick cock was being pounded into his dripping hole. He wasn’t completely unresponsive, he was moaning loud and hard just like his alpha. It was hot, messy and thrilling.
He itched to seek out someone who would listen. At this moment, he could only think of two people that practically knew him inside out. One was out of the city for a couple of weeks.
Dean shook his head. “He’s been throwing up a lot in the mornings!” He adds, “And his scent has changed some…like there is an added scent intermingled in his that I can’t yet put my finger on.”
Nearly 20 of them, standing tall and proud behind two lead wolves (one was smaller than the other). He instantly huddled into Dean’s side, still hearing his alpha growl lightly in warning.
’, but, Charlie, the conniving red head, had shot him a cheeky smirk.
He saw the most beautiful smile light up Cas eyes, and for the first time, his alpha wasn’t as cheeky, instead it was calm and eager to give its omega the gift of comfort.  Cas didn’t wait a second longer, scooting over and plastering himself to his side, laying his hand and side of his head right above his steadily beating heart.
Castiel is in his human form, while, Dean and Sammy are in their wolf forms. Dean is speaking to Cas telepathically, whilst, Cas is talking.
- as you so eloquently put it! And FYI, Lisa and I never went beyond kissing ok! She wanted to, but, I didn’t allow it! I didn’t have sex with her, nor have I had sex with anyone else after her!”
“And does he feel the same way about you?”
Speaking of Gabriel, the omega was smiling hard and walking up
He enjoyed sleeping in his human form-
Castiel was an even more beautiful 16 year old now.
John and Mary eventually kept mum when they noticed that he was not paying heed to their advices.
He decided, he was going to tell Cas the things he was feeling for the man.
Call him self centered, he couldn’t help but get hooked on one word ‘Beauty’. He found himself asking with a fluttering heart, “You think I’m beautiful?”
“Me? A halfbreed?”
Castiel’s response was to wrap his thighs tightly around Dean’s waist, locking his feet behind Dean’s back. The omegas hole squeezed tightly around Dean’s cock, “please Dean! Knot me! Fill me up with your cum!”
But, deep inside, the lesser time he had with Dean because of Lisa, the more upset and angry at the alpha and omega he became. That fascination he had for Lisa was slowly fading away into a much more nastier feeling. Something heavy in his chest and churning in his tummy.
“You’re awake, master Castiel.”
There was an unreadable expression that flickered through Dean’s face, before the man suddenly frowned, shrugged and got back to skimming through the pages of his contract. He blurted, “No problem”.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had to ask, “What does this mean, Dean?”
Another long chapter....🙂
Yes, yes that was a great plan!
The forest pups howled into the orange skies, whilst the other human wolves joined in welcoming the mate of their future pack alpha.
Dean cleared his throat, “Um- I didn’t mean to make you feel like your eyes aren’t admirable, Castiel. It’s just, the first thing I noticed about you was your eyes, and they are an interesting shade of blue”.
Castiel Novak, omega son to Chuck Novak, was the lead medic in his pack. He was an exceptional healer, determined to cure his people using nature’s given plants and herbs. His people were known as ‘White Wolves’ due to their shade of fur that reflected the snow blanketing the mountain tops. They were impossible to see if they decided to camouflage within the snow but were very much visible in the night.
The next morning, he woke up warm and curled up under his sheets. The furs on his body acted like a heater- enough to sustain him through the lonely cold night. The time on his caterpillar digital clock read 7:00am.
Gabe's lips downturned. The omega walked up to him, resting a hand on his shoulder, whispering so gently, “Come to the Annual Meet with me, Cassie. I will vouch for you and say that I forced you to come.”
He somehow felt that asking this question would only upset him further, but, his curiosity got the better of him, “Um- that’s a good thing…right? You thinking of me when you were going through your difficult situation. That’s normal….right?”
He nodded, “Ok. Um- what do you want to talk about, Cas?”
The only disappointment was that-
that he had someone as charming as Bal in his life- though he could see the underlying
He sighed, “No! Cas! You’ve exhausted me of belly rubs!” He’s been giving Cas a belly rub every morning for the past- oh-
They leaned in for more soft sweet kisses before Dean led Castiel towards the woods. Sam and Gabe following behind. Castiel leaned his head into Dean’s shoulder, just wondering out loud, “Do you think he’s here with us?”
“You are.”
Dean snorts. “The hell do you think?”
Cas shakes his head. “If I were to lose my grace, it would be from a death blow from one of my siblings,” he says. “They would not allow me to remain alive in any capacity.”
Cas presses a palm over Dean’s fingers and relents. “I could.”
—there’s not a burden in the world he’s ever gonna have to shoulder alone again.
He was so startled by it that it took a moment to grasp and hold on, to fold his own hand around the one beyond his sight and
“Sure it isn’t.” Dean sighs. “Ever notice that the rules around here never really stay the same for long? Shut up and eat your damn ribs.”
Cas shrugs. “Maybe next time, then.”
“I was,” he steps closer. “I was thinking.”
Dean retreats, risking one last over the shoulder glance he wishes he’d left undone, because the tired wince of Cas’ closed eyes makes nausea slip its way underneath his tongue.
He blinked and he was reaching deep into the cold, damp prison on only some crazy instinct, made crazier by the touch of smooth, warm flesh on the other side.
The conversation cools rapidly when its set down for even a second; Dean runs a tongue over his teeth and looks at the chick.
“You,” he says, holding the small bounty with delicate hands, “you son of a bitch. Bury the fuckin’ lede, why don’t you?”
Dean snorts. “Right, how romantic.”
He settles into his seat with a sigh, feeling the heavy weight of everything he’d been able to put off for the last few hours start clinging to his clothes again like static electricity. He’s tired, sure, but there aren’t enough shitty motel rooms in the world to sleep off the pending apocalypse, so he turns the key and points true north again—towards Sam.
“I don’t agree.”
And the miracle was, Cas was looking back—until he wasn’t. Dean blinked and he’d lost the grip on his sleeve, lost his hand, as the concerned tilt of his head was now pointed toward Jack, who looked at the world with blank but smiling eyes.
The Impala is right where he’d left it, shiny and unharmed. Whichever angel intern finally throws the idea of tracking his car into the ring is sure to get promoted out the wahoo, but for now, Dean relishes in his safety within its four doors.
Dean watches him as he drinks, rooted to the floor without an escape plan. He can’t sit on the bed, he’s not fucking insane, but they obviously have to—God help him, or don’t, really—talk about it. He fidgets.
“For fucks sake,” Dean says, standing to rinse them off and plunk them in the dishwasher. “I swear I raised him better than this.”
“We’re,” the backs of his knuckles brush Cas’ open palm. “We’re good, right?”
“You’re—you’re doing pretty great at that so far, my point of view.”
“We’re watching Riverdale instead,” Cas says, still looking at Dean with a half-squint. “Jack keeps sending me texts about something called a Gargoyle King and I don’t know what to make of it.”
Dean swallows, closes his eyes, and refuses to decipher.
Before Dean can even start to answer that—and believe him, there are quite a few choice responses—Cas, as gently as is possible, slams a palm over his mouth.
“Dean, please.”
Castiel takes a moment to look at him, washed clean in cheap motel bulbs. There’s an urgency about his eyes that makes Castiel want to lean back in, offer up again the comfort they both had just so previously found, but he knows without moving that the window for such a thing has closed.
All too suddenly, the dormant rage that’s been building within him since before he knew he was allowed to feel it bubbles to the surface. He can’t even resent it; here is clarity, at least.
In the black-out interim that Dean had thought—until about fifteen minutes ago—was gonna be the rest of his life, he’d gone over Cas’ face in his mind an uncountable number of times. Sure, they had some pictures of him, maybe even a lot of them, but he hadn’t wanted his memory of someone so goddamn
Castiel’s eyes are still closed, but he hears, feels everything: Deans’ ragged breathing against the exposed skin of his thigh, the tight press of his hips to the bed below, the hitch in his inhalation. There’s no rulebook for him here, nothing to follow or break, so Castiel merely holds gently to the side of Dean’s head with one hand and digs the other into the meat of his shoulder to ground him or—take him away.
Dean smiles through the feeling of his stomach splattering on concrete. “Oh yeah?”
“If you’re finished,” Cas says, holding out his hands. “I’d like to show Wrath the garden now.”
Dean blinks. “I don’t see why that matters.”
“Hey,
In his room, Dean’s stomach nervous like it hasn’t been since the ninth grade, Cas stops on the threshold and tilts his head, considering.
As if, maybe, if the whole thing gets played at 1.5 speed, he’ll be able to ignore the pit in his stomach that solidifies under each of Cas’ concrete affections. He’ll be able to get out of it unscathed except for the tingling ache he’ll never tell anyone he enjoys.
Sure enough, within a few minutes the ancient bunker pipes squeal and shudder and Dean can barely hear it over the air rushing out of his lungs. Boy, he’s pathetic.
He’s trying, he is, to make a gift of himself half as effectively as Dean has done, but he is so alien—he was built for a certain kind of love, and there are some prayers he cannot answer. What a picture they now make, the supplicant on his knees and pleading for a thing he does not want from Castiel, and the angel over him writhing and possessed with the inability to even give him a semblance of it.
It’s not as if he’s trying to hide this—thing from Sam, it’s just—if he talks about it, who fucking knows where the conversation’s gonna end?
“Why not a femur?” Cas says, ignoring him. “Scapula? His left side looked so defenseless, lying there in sleep.”
“How can you even ask me that,” Cas says from two inches away. Or, hell, maybe he’s given up all pretenses and merged with him completely, dug his hand deep into Dean’s chest to squeeze the sorry organs that live there. He doesn’t look down to check.
“Sure am. You want any eggs?”
“We now have,” Cas scans the crumpled receipt he’s pulled from the bottom of a bag, “forty-seven cents off gas.” He looks up, grave. “There was a deal attached to the tomatoes.”
“I got you back,” Jack said, voice a little dreamy. “I did it.”
human. No matter how new they are to the job.
“You’re a sap,” he says instead of articulating any of this, lets the softness of his voice do it for him. Besides, Cas already knows. “C’mere.”
Until then, it’s enough, just barely, to grab Cas’ hand and hold on tight for as long as he’s allowed.
Cas, who’s currently shaking through something above him, a revelation, maybe, that Dean wants to keep at bay. He doesn’t know, and that’s the problem.
“Sam.” Dean presses the backs of his knuckles deep into his eyes, so he doesn’t have to see his brother’s painfully earnest face. He’s been to Hell, and it was worse than this, but honestly, not by much. “It was never anything you did. It was never gonna be anything you did. It was all me, alright, and I knew I could have told you, but I just—I didn’t want to.”
Cas nods, gestures him forward. “Hi.”
Yes, like it’s supposed to free him. Yes, like it helps at all.
“I mean,” Dean says, crossing his arms over his chest. “What’s changed? I thought—okay, fuck me or whatever, but I thought things were going pretty alright.”
They really are so close now, breathing together as any two animals might. “Show me, then.”
“You, singular?” Dean’s eyebrows draw. “A salt and burn’s easy shit, but that don’t mean you won’t need backup.” Over the lead that’s suddenly coating his stomach, he says, “I’m coming with.”
Cas blinks his very dark eyes. It’s working, whatever stupid play Dean’s landed on, it’s working. “I want—what I want is untenable.”
Cas sighs, rubs his forehead with his hand and Dean’s, the world’s stupidest ape, is distracted by it. Who’d he learn that from? Not Dean. The world leaves its fingerprints all over Cas even without his help.
Dean rubs his eye. “Do we have to?”
Castiel knows any smile he could offer would pale in comparison to the black hole of Dean’s expression now; he hands one over anyway. “Of course I’ll let you.”
Cas hums, rifling through the dregs of their cloth grocery bags. “They no longer have that spice you wanted.”
“It depends, I guess. Is anybody immediately in danger?”
Dean looks away again. “He told me he was in love with me and then he
“Okay,” Sam says. “You’re right. Uh. Sorry.”
“Okay, then,” he says, nodding. “We’re agreed—nothing changes.”
“We have the space!”
“Hey, kid? We got him, you can slam the thing,” Dean said, not looking away from Cas’ face, not quite trusting it to remain if he did.
An interesting position he’s in to be insisting, kneeling between Cas’ legs on the cold concrete ground. But then, isn’t it as good a place as any to start demanding things?
“Dean, did it ever occur to you I may be avoiding you on purpose? That I might want some space?”
“I’ll see you inside, killer,” Dean says, winks with all the polish he’s never had to use on Cas. “And then we’ll—”
“Don’t make me talk about it anymore than that,” Dean says, lowering his hands. Spots dance in his vision before it clears. “I’d rather go another ten rounds with God.”
“Eggs,” the no longer timeless being standing in front of their open fridge says. “And honey.” Cas points at him, and it takes a moment for Dean to correctly read it as an instruction and not an endearment, but with Cas it might always be a little bit of both. “Do
Cas nods, just slightly. “Yes. You’re cool.”
Cas nods, grim. “Which is why it’s imperative we stop my brothers and sisters. They can’t be allowed to—”
“I’ve seen it,” Castiel continues, ignoring him. “I can see it now.” And he can, undulating in Dean’s expression, healed and broken and something new. The singular bright spot in hell.
Cas’ voice was gentle, firm. Real. Dean swallowed past thick relief. “Jack, you have to close it.”
There are other times when he just—can’t. When just looking at Cas eyes-closed in the light makes Dean feel like he’s stumbled the wrong way across a witch, or annoyed an angel, or done any other number of things that’s had him spitting up blood. If it’s one of those days, he can barely handle watching, but he does, quiet even if he knows Cas has already heard his boots crunch on gravel. And then he goes back inside.
Finally, after too much maneuvering, Dean catches him in the garden.
what’s
“Jack likes it,” Cas says. “And it’s important for me to keep up with his interests.”
“Oh.”
It’s not his fault.
Dean tilts his head. “Now there is that.”
“Velma is an animated character.”
“Dean.”
“The mob girlfriend seems to have it covered.”
“No, no, hey, what was that?”
“You heard the woman,” he gesticulates with his occupied hand; the rib drips red onto the table, “get to it.”
“Dean.”
“Jughead.”
He redoubles his efforts, tonguing at the head like he knows every dude from here to the Atlantic Ocean he’s never seen likes, leans into the wide-open palm of Cas’ hand in his hair. He wants, he denies himself, etc, etc, until it’s not really under his control anymore, until it’s Cas pulling the strings, pulling his hair in exactly the way that makes Dean tilt his head back and groan.
And here’s the part of the conversation where Cas interjects, dry as anything, about the completely unrelated bug problem he’s having with his pepper plants, and do you know which fowl species are perfect little exterminators, Dean?
“I,” Castiel says. Of all the decisions that have been piled upon him in his short interim of free will, this is the easiest. “I’ll take whatever you can give me.”
“Isn’t it?” Dean’s smile has returned, but it’s a brittle kind of weapon this time. “Isn’t this all just some kinda celestial pissing contest? You’ve heard them, it’s—predestined, or whatever; what the hell am I doing here, anywhere, that’s gonna change anything? We’re all
Simple as that. Humanity, life, death—of course.
“Whatcha got there?”
Dean smiles, head turned just enough to reveal it. “Boy, I wish I had your problems. Listen, if you want—you can waste some of that celestial time here.” He sighs. “Or not. It’s the end of the world, no one’s really keeping track anymore.”
Castiel frowns. “I wouldn’t.”
Bad form, maybe, to call the guy who’s admitted his since-unspoken-of love for you sweetheart, but Dean’s loose, he’s happy, he’s got blood burning deep in his veins; there was nothing else he was ever gonna do.
“Maybe he’s just enjoying the time with Eileen.”
Jack tilted his head—like father like son.
“Cas, buddy,” Dean says, and his hand rests firm on Castiel’s chest, a weight, a reminder, something to hold him inside this fragile body. “You wanna kiss someone like it’s the end of the world? I’ll show you how to kiss someone like it’s the end of the world.”
“Your reduction of the species is unearned,” Cas say. “Besides, you know Sam agrees with me.”
“Huh?”
“He—okay. Okay. I—okay.”
Dean tilts his head, hungry in only the most satisfactory way, the itch of teeth already open and poised over flesh. “Tell me anyway.”
And hell, maybe he does. Dean’s never been all that careful about reading contracts before he signs them.
Well, he didn’t want the omega getting the wrong impression of Lisa’s invasive grope session. He just wouldn’t settle down, till he clarified things with Cas. And, boy oh boy, was his alpha wolf extremely unsettled too- it was threatening to surface.
Cas said shyly, “That was my first ever kiss, Dean. And, it was perfect.”
What was surprising was that Cas would undress before him, so boldly, before slipping into a bathrobe and heading to the bathroom. It was times like that that he would feel a sense of shyness, and at the same time a tinge of excitement overcome him.
Cas was his brother.
He gnawed at his bottom lip, his heart doing a small somersault. He opened the pouch and dipped his hand in. His hand felt something cold, metallic and hard. He carefully pulled out the tiny object, immediately sucking in a breath.
The young alpha would thrust his cock into Castiel’s eager warmth. Both breathless, sweating, bloodied and moaning hard as they attempted to break the bed beneath their lustful bodies.
This time, Chuck came in with a strut and his head held high and proud. Waltzing into the Winchester Pack Encampment with several warrior wolves and a few old looking geezers.
On impulse, he defiantly threw off his covers, sitting up and fixing his sister with a dark stare, “NO!”
“You are not my omega! Castiel is!” Dean honestly had the urge to stride over to the red head and slap her silly. Seriously, he never hit women nor omegas, but this wolf was getting on his nerves.
Next he knew he was being introduced to a blonde haired green eyed beautiful woman in a midnight blue dress and her mate, a salt and pepper bearded man in a designer black suit and tie. An omega and an alpha respectively. They were both smiling and studying him with a hint of curiosity. Mary and John Winchester, Sam and Dean’s Mom and Dad.
Gem, who had his head bent back, so he could look up at Castiel responded with a big smile, “Mhmm! Your nicknames Blue!”
If there was anything any alpha was drawn to, it was how good an omega is around any pup. It was some kind of a sign for a potential and perfect mate.
The omega gasped as his eyes landed on the encampment of the Winchester forest wolves. All around were massive trees, spaced out against vast forest lands, the blue skies peaked in through the gaps between the trees, there was a sufficient amount of sunlight sipping through. It was still bright enough to see the encampment for what it was:
in such a way that he was covered from neck to foot in his intended mates favorite silk color of choice. In this case, his mate was favorable towards sky blue.
I apologize that it took so long to update. I hadn’t been feeling the urge to write, but today it came back to me.
And, here’s a 2000 plus word chapter!
A/N: I would be curious to know your thoughts on how you think Dean and Cas will meet? Or who will point Dean towards Cas? 😁
- at each other, like they were peering at the image of a ghost.
But, if last night was any indication- it only went to show how much of a weakling he was.
It started with glorious smells emanating off each other in the morning. Those amazing scents sent both alpha and omega into a sexual high. Dean couldn’t help but push himself into Castiel’s wet hole that morning, right on their bed, immediately starting up a firm rhythm. It didn’t take long for both to orgasm hard, knotted once more.
“Did you pick up any foreign scents?”
Forever will be, no matter how big or older they became.
The omegas head was closer to his alphas, now, lapping up water right next to him. He felt giddy as he thought of how the omegas tongue was close to his-
Dean of course didn’t give in. The alpha defended his mate and even went down to the council to try and solve these issues. But, Castiel saw that nothing was working….and because of that, he made the move to save his mate from any sort of murder or death. He sneaked out in the darkness of night and walked a long distance till he reached the Morningstar Pack.
Cas stuck up his nose, “Not unless you stop calling me little omega!”
His chest burning with love as he thought of how mates would be the ones who usually engaged in such closeness.
He couldn’t believe this! He was going to be mated at 25!
Question is, would
They drove around, passing parks, buildings and a few wonderful sceneries. He saw that they were nearing the cemetery Jimmy was buried in, so, he found himself asking- out of the blue, “Can we stop over and see Jimmy, Dean?”
Again, it felt like his heart was tearing itself into pieces. He sniffled, “I shouldn’t have called Cas needy, whiny and suffocating, dad. It was wrong of me.”
He was mostly ignoring Charlie’s calls for meetups, lately.
Dean suddenly looked a little red- maybe realizing that he was caught staring, rubbing the back of his neck. The man glanced around, “Um- how about….ah…on the dining table? Looks great there!”
His alpha walked up to him, unbinding him and pointing towards a nearby stream, “Bathe yourself omega, get yourself ready for my arrival in our tent.” With that the alpha walked away.
Nevertheless, he walks away, without another word. However, he walks away, with the pain of his latter words, in his heart.
Dean nodded, before a darker blush made its way up the alphas neck and cheeks, as he uttered in a low voice, “And more.”
The man’s voice was unique enough for him to identify. His eyes followed the handsomely casually dressed man in perfect ass hugging jeans.
Gabe held up a finger, “before you get your panties in a twist, Cassie; there was a reason that I visited the café”.
He found himself on the defensive, snapping out, “Don’t you ever call Cas an omega bitch…..ever again, Lisa! He is a good person!” He could feel his alpha wanting to surface, so he closed his fists that were still in his pockets real tight- digging his nails into the palms of his hand. He needed that biting pain to keep him in check. To hold him in his human state, or else he’ll be morphing into an alpha wolf and unashamedly eliminating the threat.
Ellen tapped him lightly on the forehead, answering, “when this-“, she brought her fingers down to his chest, tapping lightly over his heart, “and when this- gets out of control- flooding you with more pleasure and happiness, whenever you think of him or are near him….then, that’s when you’ll know this was meant to be”. She cupped him lightly on the cheek, smiling at him, “ain’t no time like the present, Dean. You gotta seize the day”.
Dean nipped lightly at the tip of Castiel’s ear,
Rufus scoffed, “You barely can get your ass to the
Hence his father’s unwanted reputation followed his family wherever they went. His poor mother, died of the stress of heartache and sadness due to this burden that followed them around, leaving only Chuck and his two sons: the oldest, Gabriel and the youngest, Castiel.
Dean reached out to collect their empty plates and smiled at him, “How about I clear the dishes and get them washed, while you enjoy your wine”.
Yeah. He also wanted to call Dean his boyfriend.
He winked. They started to walk side by side, paws crunching on the leaves and twigs- following the wolf made paths. He added,
His alpha purred when it sensed its omega sit down beside it. His eyes searched Cas face in silence. He hoped all was well and Castiel wasn’t having regrets.
He hated saying
Somehow, he felt that that connection between Cas and he, was only growing stronger. Like an invisible red string of fate was thickening and strengthening this faded bond between them.
. So, without further ado, he said,
A/N: And let me hear it! 😁
Sam carries on, “Your 2 dominating scents are caramel and sea breeze. The other one is very faint and seems to be foreign.”
Mary’s gasp was heard from behind him. “Oh my God! John, is that a pup!?” His wife then crouched down beside him. “What happened?”
All that mattered was Dean’s hands, lips and cock buried inside him. The alpha leaned his forehead against his and whispered hotly unto his lips, “ride me good and hard omega. Show them that you’re mine.”
He was thankful that Dean could hear his questions.
Before he could answer, their drinks and wings were delivered. They both said ‘
Novak Pack lands had the same scenic view of Winchester Pack lands. There were tall pine trees littering the mountain sides, there were placid lakes and waterlily filled ponds in the flat lands. The only uniqueness inside Novak Pack lands were the different varieties of orchids that grew like weeds everywhere.
Castiel held in his gasp. His heart aching harder- if that were possible. In this instant he knew that he wanted to make it his life’s mission to keep this traumatized, broken omega, happy and continuously smiling. So, without much thought, he promised, “I will not let anyone harm you, Dean. You are mine and as my omega, I will respect all that you do. I will respect your choices. I will keep you by my side and make you my prince, so to speak”. He was surprised at the determination and emotion in his own voice. No one would dispute his decision back at home, if he has chosen an omega slave to be his mate. After all, that’s what a few of his relatives have done over the past century, if they found an omega appealed to them.
He choked into his pillow, ‘He won’t Gabriel. How will he love someone who is littered in scars and has a limp in his walk because of a lifelong knee injury?'
Castiel held no irritation in his heart for the littlest Winchester. In fact, he felt protective and nurturing towards the little one snuggled between Dean and he. He shook his head, returning Dean’s smile and whispering back, “It’s ok Dean. He’s most welcome to snuggle in anytime”.
Sam answered a little chirpily, “Gabe and I were hoping you could make it to our engagement party this week Saturday. Can you? It would be amazing to have you be part of our engagement celebrations.”
So, she knew that she had to do something. In the end of the day, she kept in mind that both her boys were young and didn’t know what to do with the way they felt for each other. It was only natural for Dean, being the big brother, to feel repulsed by the idea of being attracted to his younger sibling, Cas.
Dean threw his head back and barked a laugh- he couldn’t help but chuckle at the alphas contagious humor. Dean smiled at him with so much softness, “Do not worry omega. Though, I have sex with your sister, it is you that holds my heart”.
- chirping from somewhere beyond the tall trees that surrounded the
The green eyed man was all in his element; sitting back, relaxed, one hand on the steering wheel, eyes intently focused on the road ahead- smiling and looking dang proud. Dean was a very handsome man behind the wheel. The perfect driver. He had a feeling that this is where Dean belonged- behind the wheels of the Impala.
Finally he saw. An alpha well dressed in a black suit and skinny tie walked out of the shadows of his tall oak tree. A very handsome alpha who glowed under the moons yellowish- blue light. His heart beat harder than it ever has as the alpha stepped up unto his front porch, the porch light finally revealing the exquisite features of a very beautiful man.
The kiss was a sweet one.
WARNING: I know that I mentioned 'No Underage' but from this chapter onwards there will be 'Underage' warnings. Please heed warnings and don't read if triggered easily!
He wanted to leave the tent immediately and let the servant do her work, but deep inside, his wolf could not bare another looking at his omegas nakedness- so he found himself dressing Castiel carefully in midnight blue silk before he was satisfied enough to dictate what Pam needed to do and leave the tent.
The alpha took in an audible great whiff of scent, he could hear how the alpha sniffed. The alpha hummed in delight,
He scoffed. “There is nothing good about Dean. Trust me.”
But, they
He watched as both Dean and Castiel glanced briefly at one another, hands tightening their hold. Then, Dean nodded at Castiel, before the young alpha’s eyes fell back on him (hesitation in those green orbs he dearly loved). “Dad, Cas and I- uh- we ran into a few wolves during our hike through the woods, today.”
Mary’s tone was soft, motherly and something aching to sadness, as she replied, “Of course, sweetheart. You may be excused.”
Cas took a step back (damn, he missed Cas close warmth). The omega once again folded his arms along his chest, huffing out a sarcastic, “Oh yeah, too much assignments and school workload during the last two years that it demanded all your attention, right!?” He didn’t like Cas tone.
Welcome to the next chapter!😁
With a hurt heart, he turned his back to the couple. Yeah he couldn’t see, but he was pretty sure he could still hear.
He knew something was off when he irritatingly said in his head, “Haven’t you been taught to respect alphas, damn Omega!”
He could confirm one thing-
There Cas stood in his slightly debauched state. It seemed that the omega had tried to tidy himself up, fingers through the messy dark hair to settle the ruffled nest, fully clothed and slapping on a smile that didn’t quite reach the omegas eyes. But, there were tells, things that Cas couldn’t hide, such as those bitten red swollen lips, that angry red hickey peeking out just under the collar of the omegas t-shirt, that flushed face, those fully blown pupils, the slightly wrinkled clothes, however, the biggest affirmation yet, was the slightly cautious looking, blonde haired, fully clothed, equally debauched male alpha that stood at least a meter behind Cas.
Of course, Charlie completely ignored him, in favor of racking up the pool balls into the triangle. When she was done, she grabbed two cue sticks and walked over to him. Her smile was as-sweet-as-sugar, “Come on Cassie! Give it a try!” She added with the worlds biggest pout, “Pretty please, for me”.
The young alpha sighed, “They will love you, Cas.”
that night at the bar.
He fell asleep while his alpha was still buried deep inside him, knotted and leaking hard. He felt the touch of soft lips on his cheek, but it must be a dream, Dean would never be affectionate with him. Never.
There was a sadness in the omegas tone as he asked,
‘I hope I can make my mate happy dad.’
Seeing the alpha smile softly was something he was never probably going to get used to, nor did he expect it. The alphas voice was surprisingly soft and secretive as he asked, “You seem…disturbed… omega?”
He smiled into the kiss as Cas ran his hands up his chest. In return, he ran his hands up and down Cas sides. Soon, they had to break for air, resting their foreheads together, panting. He leaned in and nipped Cas bottom lip, sucking and letting go with a pop. He kept thumbing that now swollen bottom lip, his voice gruff as he murmured, “I have a secret to tell you, Cas”.
Soon, they were nearing the
The blonde haired lady tilted her head to the side in curiosity, “Castiel? I swear I have heard that name mentioned once or twice in our house by one of our boys, John.”
Almost like a pesky parasite.
So, they followed.
Now, a full hour later, Dean was coming down hill, with someone else. That seemed to stop the party goers, some gasping and frantically grumbling whilst some just stared on. The most annoying was Chuck, who looked like his eyes were about to fall out of its sockets. Then, his face quickly morphed into one of absolute disgust and rage- all while hawk eyeing the omega in Dean’s arms.
“We have to tell my father, Castiel! We need to go now!”
was that a beautiful sight.
Castiel walked side by side with his alpha. He was slightly shy as all the forest wolves eyes, both human and wolf, were on him.
Dean pulled out of the hug and took a step away from his mate. He didn’t miss the way his mate’s eyes turned even more worrisome by his actions. He sighed and rubbed a hand down his face, leaning his ass against the edge of the kitchen sink, and just watching his mate with a saddened expression. He contemplated how he was going to say this, in the end, giving up and figuring that straightforward was the best way to go lest he suffer a damn brain ache. He licked his lips and broke his silence, “We have a problem that has arisen baby. The council haven’t taken to the miscarriage very happily.”
He found it weird that daddy was with Dean today. Momma was always the one that sponged their heads and looked after all of them, whenever they were feeling sick.
This lookalikes eyes were much more lighter than Jimmy’s.
He called out, “Mary! Can you make your way to the kitchen, love!”
Castiel was at least 150 years old. But, looked like he was in his 30’s. He was one of the best fighters in the coven-
Dean and Castiel were throwing on their clothes when a knock sounded on their room door. Castiel slipped into a dark corner of the room, just in case they were being hunted and found, while Dean peered into the peek hole.
The white wolf only hoped this wasn’t their last encounter.
Castiel closed his eyes; his breathing increased when he felt the press of Dean’s bulge into his own hardened one. God the things Dean did to him. Castiel cupped his lovers scruffy cheek and met the lycans fully blown green pupils, “I would love to meet him, Dean”. His hand slipped down his lovers hard chest, down that perfectly sculptured abs, to finally grip his lovers protruding bulge. He massaged that perfectly hard bulge, panting out, “but after we take care of this baby”.
I want to thank you all for having the patience and sticking by me always. You are still very important to me.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was the most erotic moment in his entire life.
Dean was getting slightly irritated now, because his body was hurting. The lycan growled, “well, CAS! Gabe’s family is not a prominent vampire one that has elders or deadly warriors, OK! Yours on the other hand, hold a lot of power! There’s a difference!”
He saw the way Cas eyes softened and lingered sadly over his parents.
A lot gets revealed in this chapter......ALOT!
Dean smiled one of his charming lopsided grins, “sure Cas. Let’s”.
Everything felt so alive from head to toe.
He saw Cas look like he was going to cry or something and look over at his daddy. His daddy kissed Cas cheek and whispered something into Cas ear that made him smile and his cheeks turn pink. Cas looked back at him just like the way daddy would look at him too – with heart eyes, “Yes, sweetheart. I would love it if you called me papa.”
Dean pulled his fingers out of Cas leaking hole to grab at the now whining omegas waist. “Come on Baby. We need to get to our spot in the barn.”
No way could he deny his want any longer. He chucked his horn filled with wine aside so hastily and began undoing his clothes until he was standing their proud and leaking. He prowled towards the bed like a hungry lion stalking its prey, moaning as the smell of apple pie wafting from the omega got stronger.
Bobby Singer, a good friend to John, surrogate father to Dean and Sam  and a member of the High Wolf Council, added with seriousness, “Yes Chuck! Expect a visit from us soon!”
- mostly. The green eyed alpha snorted loudly, before saying,
Dean could only nod, pulling Castiel tighter into his side, while his other hand gripped one of Castiel's clothed ass cheeks and squeezing firmly, eyes never living his omegas fully blown blue orbs, voice husky as he replied, “Yes omega. Lets".
She just hoped that the choices Dean and Cas both made, in the near and distant future, weren’t going to destroy them both.
Dean knew that communicating back telepathically may be the only choice he is provided by the omega, for now. So he decided to turn his back to Cas door, sliding down it, till he was seated on the ground. He had his knees pulled up to chest, his arms wrapped securely around his crooked knees, his feet firmly pressed flat into the floorboards, and the back of his head pushing back into the wooden door. His gaze fell on the portraits of he and Cas hanging on the walls- all laughing and happy. He sighed,
Even, quicker than developing affections for Jimmy.
Just as the door closed behind him, Dean grabbed him by the waist and planted a surprise sweet kiss on his lips. He absolutely melted into the man’s strong arms, almost dropping the red rose in his hand. It felt like the air was sucked right out of him. The handsome green eyed man pulled out of the kiss and said, “Hey Cas”.
Both Dean and Castiel were stunned at first. Then, Dean felt fire begin to creep into him. How dare she! He instinctively stepped in front of his husband as if to shield him from Anna’s wicked eyes. He clenched his fists barking out, “Anna, I gave you an order! AND you better mind your tongue. I already warned you earlier”.
Gabe corrected, “I’m fucking his youngest”.
Castiel giggles at his choice of words. He pulls out of the hug once more. He gives his big brother a little shake, thumbing at Castiel’s one or two escaped tears, “Now, no time for tears! Let’s celebrate yeah!”
He felt his hackles rise, his alpha was on edge. There was a musky earthy scent mixed into Cas scent-
Dean craved so badly to have his hard cock buried into Castiel’s dripping hole. The smell of Castiel’s delicious sex juices, dominating the air, had his alpha feeling excited and mad with lust. But, he couldn’t. He should be able to, as Castiel was ripe for the taking; and under wolf laws, Castiel could be claimed by his alpha if he wanted.
Castiel smiled with unmistakable tears flooding his eyes, “thank you Gabriel for bringing Dean to me”.
They were both snuggling on the bed, naked as the day they were born. They were still sticky with sweat, breathing heavily and still hazy from the power of their recent orgasms.
All because of Castiel!
Daddy chuckled and stood up, hugging him close, “Ok, on our way sweetheart.”
How could his future alpha love someone
Gabe’s face lit up, “Of course it is, little brother. Like Sam said, it would mean the world to us.”
He sighed, “His mother might be looking for him”.
Then, without warning Castiel began unbuttoning his shirt. Chuck on the other hand looked in between panicked and agitated, “Castiel, stop I command you!”
Ellen threw in an amused brow, “Well, the way I see it, sweetie; if you’ve already been for a first date and going for a second, then, I’ll label you as boyfriends”.
He nodded, “Ok thanks, Cas”.
Now, he only repulsed at the thought of seeking attention, warmth and cuddles. He didn’t want to impose himself unto anyone, particularly, Dean.
His dad was ever so supportive too. His son had his grandpa wrapped around his little paws from the moment he smiled up at the alpha leader while being cradled. John was a goner for little Kaylen Lee Winchester.
Cas raised a wolf brow at him, smile still lingering on his lips.
Mary whispered to her grandson, “Go get grandad and daddy sweetheart.”
He got up, pushing the chair back a little abruptly, before he walked out the office without another word, but, not before slamming the office door a little harder than necessary.
Gabe raised a brow. “Betrayed?”
Bobby huffed, “Yes she can and has Rufus! She mated me….FYI!”
Gabriel had eventually reached tipping point. The golden haired omega blurted out, “LIES!?” Before he turned to face a very shy scared omega, “Show them, Castiel. Show everyone here exactly what Chuck has done to you!”
He didn’t know why he was blurting out of the blue, “But, Sammy doesn’t like him very much.” That all earned surprised looks from Dean, Mary and John.
It hurt his heart, bringing tears to his eyes.
Momma immediately turned and shot him an alert look. Without another word, she quickly headed towards him, wrapped an arm around his shoulder and guided him away from Dean’s bedroom door. She quickly mumbled, “Come on love. Let’s get you far from Dean’s door.”
On that night that all began, his parents were not there, having gone to stay the night with the farm animals in the shelter- preferably to give the Prince his own space. He could recall Dean asking his parents if Anna could warm his bed for the night and though he could see the fear and heartbreak in his parents eyes- it didn’t stop them from saying
Castiel keened, “Yes please alpha. I need you in me!”
He noticed something. He was treated differently from all the other omega whores and concubines within the barbarians camp. He lived in the barbarian alpha leaders tent while the other whores and concubines were shoved into a tent of their own, waiting for any alpha to demand or call them over for a fuck.
Now that broke his heart. He was 35 years old and any omega would be incapable of bearing pups by the time they reached 40. So, chances of conceiving and having his own pups were getting slimmer day by day. But, such was his life. Who would even think to bat an eye at a halfbreed scarred omega like him?
moment; an
(See the end of the chapter for
And when he brought out the pie, Dean gasped so loudly. “Oh man, you didn’t, Cas!?” As, if he were unsure that what he was seeing was really pie!
He shrugged his shoulders, meeting the man’s eyes briefly. “No problem, Dean”. The way Dean smiled warmly at him was enough to make his heart want to climb out of his chest, run around and scream out loud how ‘
He sighed.
The guy was doing fine reeling him in- with his beautiful blue eyes, perfectly shaped chapped lips and fuckin amazing sex hair. And then, there was that voice- like the man was gargling rocks when he was little-  as a result, the man’s tone was gravelly, with a hint of smoky.
He wouldn’t be surprised.
. Dean shook his head and finally glanced at him, again with saddened eyes. The alpha looked like whatever he would say next, would be hard. The alpha smiled sadly at him, making his heart squeeze in a hopeless way. Then, Dean admitted something shocking- in a hesitant tone, “Cas, I…um…I had dreams of you too…every time I fell asleep….and….um- sort of thought of you….alot…when I was awake…um…mostly during my ruts.”
He somehow felt dismissed.
Gabriel smiled into his big brother’s shoulder. He loved Castiel’s warm hugs. It always felt trusting and comforting. He hummed, “ok big brother”.
. He hugged himself, rocking back and forth and repeatedly sobbing out, “please don’t take my brother away from me! Please don’t take him away!”
Michael sighed,
Uh! He rolled his eyes, muttering, “stubborn omega!” He wouldn’t have given up to the omegas request, so easily, but, the need for air was paramount right now. He sighed, “Ok. Can you please get off my chest, CAS!”
His gaze dropped shyly to the ground, before he dragged his eyes back up to meet Dean’s. He asked quietly, “Shall we go for lunch now, Dean?”
Sometimes you have to deal with the challenges, before things got better.
Whatever the reason was, it was HIS fault. He started the fight with Dean and now the alpha despised him. Dean seemed to be fed up with his need for comfort and attention, for a very long time now.
His knot was still thickly inflated around the base of his hard cock. He still needed more friction. He was frustrated and on the brink of losing his mind. It even went up to the point of him crying and yelling in half irritation and pleasure. He couldn’t do this alone. He needed his dad to guide him through this- no matter how embarrassing.
He suspiciously asked.
He had to correct her. “Um Ellen, we haven’t talked about what to name this…thing…we got happening between us, yet”.
Oh who was he kidding with Anna eyeing Dean like a piece of meat.
Yeah she was loyal, and he actually felt like a dick, however, she was an attention freak. Why he only noticed now, he didn’t know. He tried to be as nice as possible when he said, “Lisa, I just don’t feel attracted to you anymore. I don’t want to waste your time.”
Gem beamed with pride, excitedly squealing in victory. The little one clapped and said, “Do you want to chase butterflies in the garden with me tomorrow, Blue!?”
And with morning the storm stopped. The alpha ate and packed before he was ready to be on his way. He didn’t want to watch how Prince Dean headed towards his horse- so he continued to feed the pigs.
Castiel was so immersed in the conversation he was having with Kaylen, “So, those 10 bees we saw today have names?”
And boy oh boy was he an expensive and unique possession. All male omegas were.
His heart hurt that the omega would ever think that he would punish him. Again, he wondered what this beautiful omega had been through. He needed to clear any doubts, replying, “Of course angel. I will not force you to be with me if you choose not to do so. I will respect your every decision.”
Cas and Dean telepathically communicating is in bold-italics.
“That’s a promise ring". Dean held up his hand, showing the exact same designed ring on his finger, but only bigger. “I have one too. A promise that my heart belongs to you. Forever". Dean gestured, “Put it on".
John Winchester watched on in silence. Honestly, he had never seen a love as strong as the one brewing before him. Not even with true mates that found each other before Dean and Cas. The bond between Dean and Castiel held a special power. One that would hopefully change the course of their dreadful and bloodied history. John asked his ancestors to bless this pure bond of love that was now blossoming before his eyes.
He cleared his throat once more, “Um- I should go check on Bobby. He says he’ll be helping me familiarize with the auto shop setup”.
He believes that he is.
Ok. This still wasn’t good. There were times wolf parents left their pups to go and hunt for food. He probed, “did you see any wolves around?”
Castiel hoped so.
There was another person he felt was with him, in spirit, during his rut. He didn’t know if he was imagining things, but, he swears he could hear Cas telling him, ‘You’ll be ok, Dean.’ It was like a mantra. He even had the cutest dreams of Cas- his smile, his laugh, his big blue eyes….cuddles they used to share.
Castiel dreaded what was to come.
Jesus! Lisa was a bad apple!
See, Castiel was born a female. But, because of his beauty, he was chosen to undergo certain procedures and hormonal treatments to get his body firm and masculine. The only thing these physicians never touched or modified were their sexual organs….he was still all female between his thighs and womb. He was then slapped on with the label ‘Male Omega’.
He could hear and see the rage in Cas.
He could feel his heart start to pump faster- not out of fear, but excitement- and his breathing begin to increase. Then the alphas breath ghosted his neck, that soft black fur grazing his cheeks, it sniffed behind his ears, down his neck, clavicle and under his chin.
Castiel grumped out, “Then what do I do in the meantime, when you’re not here and I get horny. Hmm?”
He feels those words rattle him, his heart squeezing in pain. He closes his eyes briefly, still unable to turn and face Sam. He settles for saying over his shoulder in an almost tired voice, “Then it should start to show, Sam. But, until then, Dean comes second to Bal.” And damnit, that was the hardest thing he had had to admit in his entire life.
So, he turned to face the white wolves, sole attention back on the two leads. He asked,
A/N: I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my readers. Thank you for being patient with this story and for continually sticking by it. You are all my inspiration.
Samuel shrugged and abruptly said, “Do whatever you want with him! I’m done with the weak piece of shit!”
Man. All this thinking was giving him a whiplash. Because, damn was it one hell of a revelation- and if it happened to be true-
Oh how his chest filled with this strange giddy feeling and his heart was once again fluttering in excitement.
Epilogue
Every minute that passed would draw him closer to his lunch….thing….whatever this was….with Cas. And if Cas made him feel like he did last night at the bar and this morning, in front of ‘
He couldn’t stop staring.
Before his alpha would stand up and busy himself with other things.
He hadn’t realized Ellen had walked in and while she was organizing a few tools,  had stopped to study how he had drifted off. “Must be someone damn important, honey. Never seen you distracted from getting under the skirt of a car before”.
He didn’t know how long was he asleep for. All he knows is that he woke up to his mattress moving and to the strong scent of leather and whiskey (the kind that daddy drinks).
Gabe liked twisting his brother’s arm, and corrected, “actually, Cassie. Dean’s café hold a full 5 star rating by pastry and coffee experts”.
Dean was growling mad and gruff as he shoved his cock deep into his omega- locking his knot into his omegas boy pussy. He sank his canines into his lovers neck, as his orgasm was ripped out of his still rock hard cock. He thrust in nice and slow, push his knot further in, feeling how it rubbed deliciously against Castiel’s walls. He released his omegas neck, licking his omegas mating bite. All the while he was humming in absolute pleasure and delight.
Castiel finds salvation sitting slumped on a floral motel bedspread.
“Right.” Dean clears his throat, nervous again. If this bid doesn’t pan out—well, Dean’s not gonna think about it. “Not much of a brain buster or anything, but uh, we haven’t had a movie night in a second, and you’re behind on Dr. Sexy.” At Cas’ face, he course corrects. “Or, I mean, y’know. Anything you want to watch.”
Dean’s so tired. “You don’t have to,” he repeats.
Dean breathes through the harshness of a sob, jaw left slack in the aftermath; they’re already made of too much momentum to even consider it. “I’d beg you not to.”
“Yeah.” It’s easier, to be called on it, than to conjure a confession out of thin air. “I did.”
disagree. He watches Cas’ face for something he can interpret and comes up empty.
The breadth of Dean’s sigh is tremendous. “Good, that’s—thank you,” he says, scrubbing at his face rather than keep eye contact. He laughs very slightly. “God, what a—you see what I mean, now? Stupid.”
“I will,” Cas says, deep, leaning in to mouth the promise into the skin of Dean’s neck. “I will. I will.”
“Then what?” Dean says, and he’s asking much more than that. He
“Of course I will, you philistine, but that’s not my point.”
“Them?” Dean eyes his getup—nothing more than a t shirt and sweatpants, not even good for the ol’ five-finger discount. “You hiding the other six somewhere?”
It seems to be decidedly on the table, until Cas pulls back with a suddenness that has Dean chasing him, saying, please, please, come back. I’ll let you in again.
“Well, I get that,” Dean said, feeling blasphemous for the laugh in his mouth. “How soon can we—?”
“Because it’s true, man! They’re three bucks more and I can hold like, ten of ‘em in one hand. Oh, grab another thing of mustard while you’re out.”
before I got to say it.”
this isn’t true.”
“Why?” The roughness of Castiel’s voice surprises them both.
It ends. All things do. Cas draws away.
For a moment, the world is reduced to their offbeat breathing.
Dean sighs, the air of himself reflecting off the nearness of Cas’ thigh. God, he—he can’t think about this, not too deeply, he can’t think about Castiel, angel of the lord, the best friend he’s ever had, losing his grip on his words because of Dean. He’ll die all over again, he swears it.
“And I did?” Dean lies, because of course he had; he’s known what it is he’s been looking for since the world first went up in flames. But even now, having it, holding it between his hands, it’s still difficult to put it into words. Cas looks at him and allows it. Understands.
Or, uh. Outside of one. Against one, really, but whatever, a car’s close enough, who’s gonna card him for the technicality? It’s a goddamn milestone.
“Yeah,” he says. “Yeah, Cas—Cas.” Like it’s the only thing he knows how to say.
He’s breathing, probably. If he cared, he could stop to check, just—he really, really missed this.
He blinks and blinks, and tries to keep everything fuzzy in the periphery.
“Oh, God.”
More than he deserves.
“Yeah, yeah, molecules, I get it,” Dean says, breaking the small paper loop around his utensils with his thumb. “But maybe you haven’t had the right combination of molecules yet, huh? Maybe there’s one out there that you’d, you know, really like.”
“You’re, that’s,” Dean tilts his head back and groans. “That’s playing dirty.”
“Listen, before you say anything else, I wasn’t yanking your chain back there, I’ve got an answer,” Dean said, holding onto Cas’ arm as tightly as he dared. “I know, I
“What the fuck do you mean, no?” Dean says, splayed and begging. He’s at the mercy of a creature who only oh-so-recently took human shape; Dean understands him better than he does the rest of mankind. And it’s never done a thing to help them. “You keep
Dean raises an eyebrow. “Home to what?”
“Hey,” Dean says, snappish where he doesn’t want to be. “I’m trying, don’t be an asshole.”
He’s not.
“It’s not
“We’re not getting chickens.”
Sam looks at him. “Dude.”
Cas sighs beside him, and Dean almost wants to imagine his breath flowing out of his lungs and into the green and outstretched tendrils, some sort of circle he can’t quite actually see. “Sometimes I do miss it.”
,” Sam says, joining in a little like he doesn’t know if he’s allowed. “Shut up, I’m trying to be supportive.”
“Nope.”
“Regardless,” he says, and then doesn’t continue.
“Sure,” Dean says, feeling the beginnings of pins and needles in his cocked hip. “Bye, Cas.”
Sam shrugs, takes the beer Dean offers. “Salt and burn, like we said. Kid was hanging onto a rosary hidden behind this loose brick.”
Perhaps, Castiel thinks, staring down upon the miracle of lines that build a human face, he is projecting.
“Hey, I’ll drink to that,” Sam says, raising his beer. “To the end of fighting over dumbshit secrets.”
“Yeah, she likes it,” Dean says, handing the phone back. “With Jack, it’s kind of hard not to.”
She doesn’t write it down, which is fine, seeing as they’re basically the only ones here on a Wednesday night. “Sauce?”
“No, no, I just didn’t expect you’d take me up on it,” he says, and smiles. The gentle creases around his eyes when he does so make Castiel wish for any fate but the one he’s now plummeting towards. “So, what? You wanna take another shot at this whole,” Dean gestures lazily in the air, “last night on earth thing? Hit up some other ‘den of iniquity?’”
, it’s the
“Jail, with an underground bare-knuckle boxing ring, sure, whatever, it’s a dirty system, blah blah—that I can accept.”
“You’re ready,” Cas repeats, not in disbelief, an honest question.
“It kind of was,” Sam says, mouth still slanted up. “How about you guys, what’d I miss?”
“Right.”
“Well, Cas,” he says. “Then I guess I’ll see you on the other side.”
“Yeah, man,” Dean says. “I’d say nature documentaries are off the table, but I kind of liked that whale one.”
Dean shrugs, clears his throat. “Gotta have a two by four supplier if I’m gonna build a coop, c’mon, Sammy, use your head.”
“I like it.” Sam stirs his food with a fork, plops it back in the microwave uncovered.
. How is he supposed to respond?
“There’s only one thing I’ll ever choose again,” Cas says, and if the certainty in his eyes doesn’t make the insides of Dean’s elbows ache. It’s too much, almost, to bear that kind of weight, but at the same time, he knows, he
He’d known all those years ago, watching Jason Patric in a leather jacket on a shitty motel room TV, clenching his jaw and being oh-so-grateful for once that Dad’d been gone for days. He’d known that first fumbling fight turned something else behind a bar he technically wasn’t even old enough to get inside of. Dean had known, several times, that year before Hell, the one dotted with more bar hops than usual, the one that’d had him screaming on the inside:
“You—” Sam stops, pinches the bridge of his nose. “Oh my God.”
There are words for it, probably, this thing he is experiencing on an unclean motel bed somewhere in the state of Kansas, but he is at a loss to find them now. He can barely do so for its separate quotients—there’s heat, indeed, pressure, the whorl of Dean’s thumbprint as it presses deeply into Castiel’s hip, holding him solidly in place. This single digit is heavy enough to make Castiel doubt the strength of his own grace in moving it, to wonder why he’d ever want to.
skates his eyes up and over in a terrific roll before popping the button of Dean’s pants with practiced ease and using his hand to broker the rest of the argument.
The dam breaks. “What the fuck is wrong with you?” Dean says, past the laugh that’s been building in his chest like a fuckin’ Meat Loaf song.
Dean huffs. “You asshole.”
all together, all at once.
“Is this—how far are we goin’ with this, Cas?” Dean asks, suspended above him on strings. Castiel looks at his dark mouth and darker eyes and can’t imagine a single human thing to say. “You gonna poof out on me if I take it a little further?”
“What does?”
“Fuck,” Dean says. “Fuck,
Cas doesn’t. He stares up at him with an expression made of anger and confusion, but he doesn’t speak to undo the thread that’s been holding Dean together and hanging him at the same time. Dean exhales.
In his life, Dean’s felt all nature of supernatural draws—demon, angel, whatever else was deciding to yank him across the room that hour—but nothing to date has been exactly as strong as this slight crease of Cas’ mouth; helpless, he leans back in to taste it.
It’s not exactly easy to avoid, to give the guy who looked you in the eye and saw your slack-jawed reaction the old dodge and slip, so Dean just mostly ignores it. Or, well, tries.
“Please,” Dean says. He feels drunk, spinning, and it’s not the three quarters of a beer that’s done him in. He turns his face into the hand resting on it, the source, and begs with words, mouth, tongue. “Please, please, Castiel.”
Sometimes, it seems to Dean as if it never stops happening, like the space between instances of being crowded between Cas and a wall, bed, hell, the cool metal shell of his car, exist in a blink or even less.
“Don’t tell the kid I don’t like his show.”
“Very clever.” Cas’ voice is dry enough to catch fire. Dean smiles back.
“Yes.”
Dean laughs, feeling brighter than the final lemon resting on their counter in its wrinkled bag. He pivots on his heel, snagging it as he goes; it rolls its uneven way down his forearm to the socket of his elbow and with a quick, smooth motion, he pops it back up into his waiting hand.
“Dean.” Sam looks absolutely incredulous. “How was I supposed to?”
“I hardly make light ones.”
stinging only in the fact that he knows the bid is not quite enough. It never will be.
“I see.” Despite Dean’s inability to see his face, he hears Cas’ smile loud and clear. He wants to press in even closer, feel the warmth of it on his cheek. “We wouldn’t want that.”
“Yeah, yeah,
Dean takes a step forward, turns them in midair so that he lands with his back on his familiar rumpled navy sheets. He likes it, this position. He likes the baring of his neck. He likes to offer himself, to say
Sam makes a face. “Dean.”
He gasps, in, out, ragged as he finishes into Cas’ fist, leaning his forehead on his open shoulder. Breathes a little more, eyes scrunched closed.
“Dean,” he says, not for any reason but to say something, to voice a piece
, somehow, miracle, skin of his goddamn teeth, to be watched? He hopes, he prays—as much as longing is a prayer—not.
Cas relents after a second, passing off the baby bird in a move that puts more skin against skin than Dean’s felt in days.
“What? No.”
Cas stands, jaw tilted, and doesn’t answer; Dean waits, used to the game.
on the shoulder. He rolls off of Dean slightly and onto his back, putting an arm over his eyes; Dean scrubs his own with the backs of his knuckles, clears his throat.
“But you should talk to me about this—if you want to. Four decades is a long time to be so, uh, repressed—”
As far as he cares, this might as well be it. He’s not gonna go hunting for more, at least—he’s found enough of Eden for him right here.
Recently, though. Recently, Dean hasn’t had to do much handwringing at all over that particular anxiety, and it all comes down to three reasons he’s gonna hang onto until his knuckles blanch.
Dean manfully resists slapping the top of the doorway on his way out.
, Sam, what was I supposed to do?”
“Hey, so,” Dean says, instead of answering the unspoken question present in his tilted head. “I know you’re busy but, c’mon—Kansas City. It’s against the law to not stop in for some barbecue.”
“So you’ve been,” Sam says, blinks. “It’s been—months.”
He still clenches his jaw to the point of pain when Cas fails to even look up.
Sam furrows his brow but allows the subject change. “Uh, as far as I know, yeah. Why?”
. Too much for any human—any
“You must realize that isn’t possible.”
Dean shoves the phone back in his pocket, the grateful sound of Sam’s voice echoing in his ear—fine enough to be on the receiving end of, sure, but he can’t quite hear it without thinking about how soon it’ll probably be tainted again by the bitterness that won’t stop running like a river between them. How soon Dean has until one of them does something unforgivable, again. How soon before the other has to forgive.
Cas huffs a little under his breath. “Don’t make me leave you here,” he says, doing the opposite and crowding Dean right back up against the unyielding barrier of his own door. Despite the contradiction, the pit of Dean’s stomach twists like a rope, because—that’s the crux of it all, isn’t it?
, okay? I,” Dean cuts himself off. “Whatever.”
“The end of the world,” he says, the syllables entirely too light on their feet. “What do I say if it does occur?”
“That’s not a stupid question—is anybody
“Awesome.” And it is. Something to do with his hands, something to get Cas to look him in the eye again. He’ll deal with the bird shit consequences later—all goes to hell, they’ll just be eating chicken for a couple meals, no biggie. “We’re gonna be ass-full of eggs in no time.”
“I could,” Cas says, an agreement, not an action. “What do you want?”
“I have to check out,” Cas says after a few more minutes of background noise. Dull wheels skidding, the voices of strangers—Dean’s gotta be on speakerphone in the cart’s basket. “So I’ll let you go.”
“Do we have to talk about it? You could just stay.” He tries to press the truth of it deep into Cas’ skin with his fingertips, and only really succeeds in reminding himself of the borders of his body, all the ways in which they’ll never really meet.
Dean hums, tosses him a tupperware that holds some leftover shepherd’s pie.
Castiel lets out a breath he doesn’t need to be holding. “By all means.”
So, yeah. Dean’s adjusted himself to worse things.
They’re lying there again, that same lamplit place they so often return to, when Cas speaks.
“I,” Castiel, weak as he’s felt his grace becoming, hesitates to confirm against the heady feeling now awake and living within his fingertips. “Not intentionally.”
“Don’t—what?” Dean looks up at him, the curve of his neck pronounced and coloring with blood and heat. “Don’t say that.”
“C’mon, kid,” Dean said. “Join the team.”
He opens his mouth, stop starts a few sentences in vain, and then just gives up on all of it; instead, he plants a hand on Cas’ knee and clings for dear fucking life. Cas tilts his smile towards him like he’s heard him anyway.
“Did I?” Amused, this time.
“Now there’s a cliche.”
Cas smiles, allows strangeness of the adage, likes it too a little, maybe. “Maybe,” he says. “But not the first time.”
As soon as Dean and Castiel appeared behind John, Ellen’s voice changed into motherly excitement, her face lighting up as she got off her chair and made her way to his pups with open arms, “Oh how are my sweet children?” Yup, Dean, Sam and Castiel were considered her pups too.
He wanted to answer her saying that men would still find him weird, so, yeah…anyway, he diverted the topic and said, “So, shall we get going?”
He slipped on his black leather jacket and stomped past all the vampires gathered in the living room- drinking blood out of wine glasses or out of blood bags. He shot glares at them and pushed the big wooden front doors open. The fresh night air brushed his cold face, waking him up to his cause of finding Castiel.
But then, a year later, Michael was murdered. No one knows by whom. Since Michael didn’t have a brother nor an heir, Lucifer, Michael’s nephew (son of his only sister Naomi who is now deceased), had taken up the title of Morningstar Pack Alpha. Tensions soon arose between the Winchester and Morningstar Packs, all because Lucifer demanded that Castiel come back to camp.
Sam shook his head, “No Gabe. I didn’t know that Dean and Cas were true mates ok. All I know is that my brother had to leave to attend Alpha Training at a Winchester Institution.”
But no, reality was, he will never be a part of such a great traditional event.
To divert his mind, he cleared his throat loudly earning a startled gasp from Castiel who dropped what he was doing to look at him with wide eyes and reddened sun kissed cheeks.
He felt his shoulders droop, “Did I do something wrong by dating Lisa and spending time with her?”
He had felt, seen and heard the want and need coming from the alpha. So, he was going to put his faith in Dean. He willed his omega in, sucking in a breath and smiling lightly, “Ok Dean. Soon.”
He felt in his heart that this year, Gabriel would find the perfect mate at the annual meet. The Winchester Pack was a new pack to join in the meet, so maybe Gabriel’s mate was there. In all honesty, he was happy for Gabriel. Truly.
The jay bird took them onto a hidden path, beyond the boulders. It was still Winchester territory, however, it wasn’t explored much. He huddled close to Dean, as his old friend flew above them, its little wings flapping so excitedly.
But, all he felt in return was violated and disgusted with Lisa. His anger clawed its way to the surface, when his eyes flicked over to the person standing a few meters behind Lisa’s shoulder, only to capture Cas teary blue eyes, before the omega was hugging himself and trudging into his own bedroom- shutting the door too softly behind him.
And, they would talk about these feelings and actions, but, not now. Now, they enjoyed the company and warmth of each other.
Do leave some love and comments too 🙂 They inspire me!
He shook his head, voice tight and emotional as he said, “And why should I give you that chance Dean, huh? So you can break my heart all over again? So you can tell me that I’m not worth enough to be your mate? So I can get rejected once more like you did me 10 years ago on Prom Night?” He swallowed the thickness in his throat, swiping at the tears running down his cheeks, “10 years of wondering why, 10 years of sorrow and pain, 10 years of keeping this within me is more than enough. I won’t take any more from you Dean, I can’t let you break me completely.”
The handsome alpha chuckled, his expression fond, “The first most beautiful omega is my three year old son.”
Castiel nodded and shifted closer to Dean’s side, “Ok dad.” Dean only nodded and wrapped an arm around his omegas shoulder, pulling the omega closer to his side to keep warm and most importantly, to comfort.
Tears of joy!
Benny, who was occupied sucking on omega Andreas neck, just growled out, “Aye Brother!”
“Uh! Whatever! Fact of the matter is, ELLEN CHOSE ME! Even though we are both alphas!” Bobby continued sounding proud.
The complements and moans Dean gave out, after taking bites of his meal, made him crimson in the face. The man was enjoying the home cooked meal a little too much, not that he wasn’t flattered though.. It wasn’t long that they finished their dinners. He announced, “I have dessert. Wait here.”
- opposite his café. A stain in this old and vulnerable town. He shivered at the sight of the red bricked structure and that flicking green neon sign that read, ‘
And maybe he wanted Dean to eat him up- but somewhere much more intimate. And maybe, he craved for Dean to dip his tongue into his delicious dripping cavern. And maybe, he wanted Dean to bite him good and proper when they are at the peak of their pleasures. He felt desire creep out of him- too overstimulated by Deans body- closing his eyes, head falling back, stretching his neck out, as he hummed, “Mmm, You’re going to be so good with your teeth and tongue, Dean.” Yeah, he was way past caring about what fell out of his mouth.
5 damn years!
“He has to know that we will love anyone he chooses to love, right John?”Mary leaned into her husband’s side, finding comfort in her husband’s warm embrace.
Alphas were faster and he was already catching up to the white wolf. Cas was only a few feet ahead, enjoying the run, with the breeze ruffling that gorgeous white fur. The omega knew that the alpha was just behind him, so, it quickened its pace. And, he allowed the omega to stay ahead, because the view was better from behind.
Dean’s brows furrowed. ‘
Firstly, Dean was a heart stopper. The alpha was a dream boat. He was 6 foot tall, had sandy blonde hair (Ivy league cut), had light dusting of freckles on the bridge of his nose, grass green eyes, nicely trimmed beard, thick lashes and pouty lips that could make any girl jealous. The man projected the vibes of simplicity; dressed in a red and white checkered flannel whose sleeves were folded up to elbow and unbuttoned along the torso, a black t-shirt underneath flannel, a nice dark blue pair of jeans that wasn’t on the side of too tight and brown boots. Castiel couldn’t control the blush that crept up his cheeks and the race of his heart as the alpha smiled so handsomely at him.
Dean was tempted. But, he needed to get back. “Sweetheart, I can’t stay. I need to get back. But, I promise I will be visiting more often now. We will continue where we left off. I promise”.
Yeah, Dean always found the idea of him and Jay Bird having a bond quite hilarious.
I do hope you enjoy!
Bobby couldn’t stop laughing after that, roaring into the air. But, just when he thought the fun had ended, Bobby had laughed too hard and released an unmistakable fart- that sounded even worse that Rufus failed attempt at a growl. A loud squeak.
Both trembling with untamed desire as they collapse into one another, holding on for dear life- releasing and moaning for the next 5 minutes.
It wasn’t long before Dean released his neck, licking at the mating bite. He felt at one with Cas. It was the best feeling ever, because now, Cas was his for life. Officially. So, he took a step back to peer into Cas blue eyes and all he saw was the love the omega had for him. He smiled,
“I think Dean should make that decision for himself Castiel! You have no say in this as an under aged omega!”
He was 20 now, but, he still remembered what he saw that night. He still remembered how he had witnessed Dean, in the silence of the night, taking a willing Anna, his 18 year old sister, on her straw bed.
There were two new people in their kitchen.
“So, hows work, man?” Adam asked. “Heard you got a job at Singers”.
Hmm. The endearing name itself, spoke of how much Dean adored this car.
And Goddamn did Sam hate lying to Gabe.
“Mom. Dad. Castiel isn’t feeling too well!” Dean came bustling into the great hall in panic.
Yes, he liked a few alphas, but, that didn’t mean that he was just going to say
Their lovemaking didn’t stop there. Dean refused to pull out, instead carrying Castiel to their bed,, laying his omega down on their ruffled sheets,  pressing his omega into their cum stained sheets and fucking the pleading omega deep and hard once more.
(See the end of the chapter for
Unfortunately, Castiel had had a miscarriage at 3 months pregnant. And it broke both Dean and he, seeing as they had been trying to conceive for nearly 5 years.
He asked almost quietly, “Then why did you seem disappointed just a few seconds ago?”
Dean knew that Anna was a manipulative , daring omega and he wouldn’t trust her one bit. Nevertheless, this situation was beyond his control. He turned his attention away from the omega next to him, starting up he’s Chevy’s engine. It was time to drive home.
She handed a few thornless white roses for him to hold. Soon, she walking over to the counter and getting the flowers bundled up with a fancy midnight laced string. He proceeded with the payments before accepting the flowers from her. The sweet smell was so calming. He smiled at Missouri, “thank you. These flowers are exquisite, as always”.
As if an invisible force was guiding his chin up, he met the green eyes of the alpha that smelled so alluring. This time, he felt his omega yip within him, particularly happy that its alpha was smiling so handsomely back. He couldn’t help the small pull at the corner of his lips as he glanced into those warm welcoming eyes framed by the most longest lashes he’s ever seen on a man. He didn’t mean for the next words to slip out of his mouth, “You…like me?”He didn’t dare turn his head to see why Gabe was giggling like a school girl with a crush while he chatted with the other long haired alpha.
“I’m thankful that mom and dad are coming.”
Whatever the universe was weaving, it felt right.
Lucifer felt his heart in his throat. He growled, “You have no evidence!”
It was Dean who spoke up this time, “Are you saying that, Cas and I….we’re true mates?”
She had said to wear his black ass and thigh hugging jeans, his blue button down with a black blazer and black skinny tie. He had on a pair of black sneakers to go with his look. Yeah, he sort of had an odd fashion choice but he liked it- might as well get comfortable seeing as he might be ridiculed.
Instantly, his omega internally whined and folded. He felt tears swim in his eyes as he lay back down in the same position he was before, pulling the covers over his head. But, before that, he was pretty sure he imagined Prince Dean looking apologetic and sad.
“I don’t think it, I’m absolutely certain that you are the second most beautiful omega I have the privilege of knowing, however brief if may be.” The alpha aimed a heart stopping lopsided smirk that made butterflies flutter in his tummy.
Dean threw in a cheeky smirk followed by a chuckle, “Mhmm. That's not what I picked up, omega”. The alpha then shrugged, “Plus, I could smell how jealous you were too".
up at mom, before, strutting away and disappearing into his own bedroom.
“So, are you and Cas planning to do anything today? I mean, it is a beautiful day. Perfect for a run or walk in the woods.” He shrugged, “Maybe, you guys can go down to the Wicker Streams.”
Cas was 20 when Dean finally asked him to come live with him in the castle. To say Cas was speechless was an understatement. His entire being was riddled with excited trepidation.
He peeked his head into the office, meeting Castiel’s beautiful- um no- unique blue eyes. He said, “Um- are you free right now? I’ve um- I’ve read the contract and signed it”.
John centered himself, before he said, “Boys, I need you to look at me, please. What I am going to say or clarify is very important.”
, kept running in Deans mind in repeat. He was about to break Castiel’s heart with what has to happen here tomorrow.
And it broke his heart, it filled him up with immense guilt and pain. He remembered his name, Castiel. His sweet omega, his sweet omega that he left torn and crying in the middle of the dance-floor.
He was leaving him behind. And, though he knew it was always bound to happen, didn’t make it hurt less. That piece of his heart, that was going to be lost, was filled with his love for Dean.
Cas whined,
So, here he stood, outside Cas bedroom door.
“Yes we are.” Castiel answered with a small smile.
Shut up!
Bobby’s truck and a classic 1967 Chevy Impala was already parked side by side, in the yard. He parked his car beside the classic car and got out. Well, his car looked ridiculous beside that beautiful muscled car. Maybe, he should go park his car beside all the junked up cars stacked in Bobby Singers car yard out back.
Here he was setting up the proper documents for the new employees contract, when his office door was shoved open.
Sam wanted to see Gabriel so badly, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t risk Gabriel’s safety. And, he had promised Dean that he would stay away till Lucifer was brought to task for his heinous unforgivable crimes. He would have to resort to texting his upset boyfriend who still did not understand why Sam had to stay away.
If Dean was dating and had completely forgotten about him, then he supposes he could do the same too! And that’s why, when the charming British accented alpha named Balthazar Cruise, asked him out, he had said
He lamely uttered the perfect excuse, “Red, I’ve got work tomorrow.”
And it hurt real bad.
Lucian and his kind had been in chains all their lives; in spiked collars; in rags; lived in dirty stone cages- everything under the feel of a barbed whip against their skin.
Their first heat and rut together lasted two weeks.
Cas blinked the daze away, eyeing him much more attentively. And at this moment he was holding his breath, fearful that Cas might just freak out and tell him to leave. But, then, Cas asked with a timid smile, sounding as if he were trying to figure out if he was telling the truth or not. “Really? You love me?”
. He was caught off guard from all directions.
. He just assumed that Dean was in love with Jimmy all these years, but, the man wasn’t.
He felt like they were drifting apart-
Daddy nodded and helped him sit up, kissing the top of his head, “Yup, pancakes baby.”
“No Dean! YOU COME! And when you’re done with Anna, then we can work on building this bond between us! I will allow it!” The omega ordered, “DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR ALPHA!?”
Pies were baked in traditional brick ovens, whilst, coffee was brewed over the firewood. An aroma so rich would flow out the café doors, luring townsfolk in, with watering mouths and grumbling tummies.
A/N: So, I will be ending this part of the story here. I am thinking of writing a second part sometime later- Gabe still needs a wedding and I’m thinking PUPS for both Gabe and Cas in the next part of the series :D
He was setting himself up for the worst treatment ever.
One of the old wolves of the Milton Council stepped up, “You will release the halfbreed, young alpha! The Milton Wolf Councils decision must be adhered to or else, you face punishment for non compliance!”
Yup that question certainly caught both he, Dean and Mary (judging by her raised brow at John) off guard. However, there was no venom in John’s voice, just the same fatherly gentleness.
Castiel’s  smile was Jimmy’s smile and it nearly made his heart stop. This feeling that he had only felt once before, a hell of a long time back, started to claw its way unto the surface. It drew him to the accountant like a moth to flame.
Today, after the cemetery visit- he had come up with a theory as to why he felt connected to Jimmy.
He lightly thumbed at Castiel’s bottom lip, “Oh I heard you angel.” He met Castiel’s eyes with deep intent, he swore he was going to get lost in those sapphire blues, “Listen to me babe, apart from my mom, dad, baby brother, there is no one else I’d rather trust with my son than you. I know you never intended to put him in harms way, AND you didn’t. Chuck is the culprit and asshole here, Cas. He is the one who deserves all the blame. Ok?”
His eyes somehow flicked
thing. And, most shockingly, is that his parents were
ran around him, trying to entertain him by chasing after the toads, bees and bunnies.
Still sounding snippy.
Lisa again…pushed herself into his personal space. This time her eyes were pleading and her voice was sugary sweet….her hands were also running down his chest and tummy- sending a few, surprisingly, unwelcoming tingles down his torso. Seriously, he wanted to shove her off- his hands twitching at his sides- clenching and unclenching his fists. His alpha wolf was definitely on edge, giving him that sensation that there was a threat around.
Yes, as much as he was willing to claim Castiel as his mate, he still wanted his omega to have free will to choose.
His heart softened when the pup managed to crawl on its belly, to snuggle into his two front paws. He rolled his wolf eyes, ‘
Dean and Sam just watched the exchange quietly. These were happy times now. Lucifer and his alphas that participated in the slaughter of the Novak Pack omegas and pups were now captured and sentenced immediately to life imprisonment in wolf prisons. The Novak Pack wolves no longer hid and were now given space to set up their homes in Winchester Pack lands.
They were just standing there, looking all awkward. So, this time, he had to step up and decided a change of topic. “So, I’ve got your um- paperwork for your contract printed out. Maybe you could get down to reading it, and if you have any queries or concerns then you can point them out to me”. He gestured to the empty chair before his office desk, “Have a seat, Mr. Winchester”.
The man was his perfect fit.
Castiel blew out a breath, chuckled and nodded, “Yup. Just adjusting to your massive size. But, you can do it again.”
John and Mary are talking because they are in their human forms (Their kids can communicate telepathically with them).
“Fell asleep cuddling?” He replied a little teasingly.
He closed his eyes briefly, taking a huge breath. He uttered, “you can do this, Dean”. With those final words, he got out of the car, dug his hands into the front pockets of his brown leather jacket and walked towards the spot he knew Jimmy was buried.
And, he admired the attention, but, it was just too much. Not to mention, it made him feel like he was cheating on Dean- if he ever gave in to their advances.
Mom had her hand over her mouth (trying to hide her smile), whilst her eyes were very happy. His dad was smirking at the two. He remembered Gabe’s words from last night,
He found himself shaking his head, uttering repeatedly, “No. No she can’t. Dean, please she can’t. She can’t take you away from me.”
Nevertheless, that was the least of his worries. Today he sat at the dinner table, feeling terrible and upset. He lowered his gaze onto his still filled plate of food before him, feeling tears well in his eyes as he whispered, “I’m sorry.”
Soulmate bonds don’t actually ignite unless those fated to be together are within close proximity of each other. And how close can two wolves be if they came across each other just by the borders of their land? It was the burning, yearning sensation, the delicious smell of the enemy wolf that caught both the Omega and Alphas attention.
Castiel wanted to melt.
Gabe didn’t hide his dislike for her. His omega huffed, “You know, she asked about your brother Dean?”
Mary resisted the urge to smile hard. It seemed that John did to, rubbing at his mouth and chin, to cover up that smile that was threatening to spill out. Castiel had
So, an argument between Dean and he was bound to happen sometime.
He smiled happily. He liked it whenever Dean inhaled his scent and gave him compliments. His omega wolf was yipping for joy inside him. It was so weird to feel this excited, but, it was nice.
He’d keep that retort to himself though.
He was sure that Mary didn’t hear the wolf- she only could, if her and Cas were either ‘
did I forget my omega, waiting here at home for me. I knew I would see you once I got everything, including myself sorted, Cas. And, I’m sorry if I made you believe that I had abandoned you….I don’t think I ever can. I couldn’t leave you in the woods 17 years back; I won’t now.”
And yeah, maybe he did feel his heart thrum at the thought of Cas
He could see that the man, whose back was still turned to him, was studying his car intently. He felt pride consume him. Mhmm. He kept Baby in tip top shape.
establishment has been run by his family.
He ran his tongue along his bottom lip, heart skipping a beat, as he watched Dean follow the movement briefly before dragging those green eyes back up to meet his blues. He looked for something to say-
Cas reading his curiosity asked,
Yeah, his heart was skipping several beats now. Could this be possible? Again, his mind always drifted to the negative flaws he had with him and somehow words crawled out of his mouth, murmuring with slight heartache, “But, I’m imperfect alpha. I limp.”
It was only labored breathing, pants and erotic moans that accompanied the sexy sounds of skin slapping against skin and the obscene sound of a wet hole being destroyed by a hard cock. It took only several minutes more for Dean’s knot to start swelling at the base. The alpha couldn’t help but fuck himself harder and deeper as his knot rubbed so deliciously against Castiel’s rim. He growled, “Cas! Tell me you want my knot!”
He may have been slightly deaf, because there was no way that that was a growl from the alpha. Or, maybe it was a growl and the alpha was pissed at him. His eyes couldn’t stay rooted on the ground any longer, he glanced up to meet a disappointed face. Naturally, he assumed it was him and blurted out, “I’m sorry to offend you in any way, with my halfbreed status. I will just go in and leave you be.” Oh how his heart hurt right now.
The sun was streaming in through his white lace curtains, giving an orange- yellowish glow into the entire room. But, that warmth and brightness of a new day was not enough to dull the ache he held in his chest.
He handed the signed papers to Castiel, who immediately started flipping through it. The blue eyed man finally glanced up at him and asked, “All, the conditions are to your satisfaction?”
He suddenly felt so good. He suddenly felt so accomplished. He whistled happily and grabbed a wrench out of the red tool box, lifting the hood of the rusty Camaro and getting to work. At least, he’d pass the time faster, burying his head into work.
Mhmm. Cas looked cute when he was all happy.
His voice was utterly scratchy with emotion as he decided to focus on a tree behind Gabe. He could feel the tears well in his eyes as he replied with an ache so deep in his heart, “Um, I know that I won’t be able to bear kids Gabe. I am mateless and chances are high that I will never find the one, simply because I am not mate material. So, this is a fate I am willing to accept. “
Yeah, colleges never wanted to give the
Thank you to all for your comments and kudos! You inspire me, truly! ❤
Dean reveals The Councils decision to Castiel. Hope you enjoy.
A unique and rare beauty he had never seen before. Then again, maybe he was just used to being around too many black furred wolves.
“Son, a promise is a big deal. You only make them if you’re going to keep them.” His dad raised a serious brow.
Castiel chuckled at his lovers childishness. He leaned in and brushed his lips gently against Dean’s in a feathery light kiss, murmuring, “I do love all of you, Dean".
Dean kept sneaking peaks at his future mates wolf. The first time he had laid eyes on Cas, after transformation, he knew he was screwed for life.
“Thanks! Did you like the fishy too, Cas?”
Charlie replied, “Dorothy will be busy working on her latest ‘Wizard Of Oz’ project for the upcoming Emerald City Convention, so she won’t be coming. Plus, she will want me to be out of the apartment for a few hours, as she can’t concentrate when I’m around”. Charlie giggled at the end.
And, he had parents.
The energy from his body was depleted. He couldn’t do much in bed, luckily the alpha just wanted a warm wet hole to sink his cock in, thrusting rough and firm till he was knotted and spilling deep into his womb.
A tiny shy smile lit up Cas face, “Um- yes Dean. I would want that very much.”
Dean himself looked stunned. And, that included Mary and John, whose eyes and secret smiles he caught, whilst standing behind Cas.
He only spoke truthfully, as he addressed Michael,
He carefully picked up the pup by the nape of its neck.
He nodded, “Ok daddy.”
Charlie’s phone was picked up on the second ring. Her bubbly loud voice bursting through the receiver of his phone, “CASSIE! I NEVER THOUGHT I’D HERE FROM YOU, EVER AGAIN!”
Nevertheless, he forced out a smile, “I will hold on to whatever hope and faith I have left.”
Oh how the walls around his heart dissolved.
That’s what he felt when he parked the car outside the driveway of his childhood home. He sat in the Impala, for at least a minute, breathing in the cold night air and taking in the soothing orange lights pouring out the cabin windows. He got out the car, wolf eyes taking in the surroundings. The gardens were still the same, the trees were still standing tall and the woods nearby the house still looked welcoming- calling for a good run or chase.
Dean, her clueless son, would always reply, ‘
The king shared his views with his beautiful wife, Mary. She of course swooned at the idea of their oldest child having a secret love.
bound by a thick rope, his rope was linked to his alphas black stallion of a horse and in the grasp of its masters rider, jerking the rope if he stopped or was too slow whilst he walked a few meters on foot behind.
. Dean was just as curious.
He certainly wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to talk to tall, long haired, dimple cheeked and handsome over there. No way!
Craven felt anger course through his veins. That blue eyed vampire never adhered to anything he said nor showed him any ounce of respect. He still loved the vampire; he desired him. He had let Castiel get away with his petulance; but not this time! This time he was going to fuck and claim the vampire; make him his without the vamps permission. He called out, “NAPIER! COME HERE!”
“I was heartbroken that night dad!” He boomed, “You should’ve looked at me as your son who was suffering and confused, you should have said ‘fuck pack traditions’ and guided me towards my mate. It is your job as a father to be there for me, to lead me towards happiness.” He scoffed, “Instead, you pushed me away and sent me off to some Institution where I didn’t get to see my family, Sammy and my mate for 10 years! Did you ever stop to think how it would make me feel? Better yet, did you ever miss me?” His voice trembled with emotion now, tears clouding his vision once more.
A/N: And there you have it, their first meet💁
He needed to be in his mates arms.
But in the end, he concluded that he wanted Cas, badly. His alpha wanted Cas. And his alpha wasn’t shy to show its interest, however mildly. Thank heavens for sheets pulled up to his waist, or he would have a lot of explaining to do.
For two years Dean and Castiel stuck to pleasuring each other with their mouths, fingers and tongues. And, the longer it went, the harder it was for Dean to stay true to his words of not fucking Cas till he was 21. And, Castiel didn’t make it easy too with the way he always begged Dean desperately to knot his leaking hole.
Meanwhile, Gabriel watched in confusion as his father got whisked away. He felt like he needed to say something, but, after what his father had done to him- hurting him, made him drop what he had to voice out. He instead heard his mates gentle tone coaxing, “Babe, come on let’s get you up and inside, ok.” He felt the big warm grip of his alphas hands on his bicep. He carefully stood up on trembling feet and immediately leaned into his alphas broad chest, suddenly feeling comforted and safe in his alphas big arms. He buried his face into his mates neck, asking almost too quietly, “What’s going on Sammy? Why have they taken my f- Lucifer?”
Dean’s unshed tears made his heart ache, no omega liked to see their alpha in tears. Still he held on strong to his words, he deserved something good and he had to voice how he felt, despite the consequences.
He could hear the conversations happening, because he was in his wolf form. He surveyed while he listened and noticed that all the other wolves (nearly 20 of them) were alphas….
Castiel POV
Again, Dean stood there, looking like a damn heartthrob.
“I wasn't jealous!”
Dean had said to wear something casual. So, he did. He wore a long sleeved denim dark blue button up, with black jeans and dark boots. He had kept his hair messy- just the way he knew Dean liked it. And that was according to
Lastly was Gem Winchester. The little 3 foot child was dressed in a cute blue woolly sweater, brown khakis and black sneakers. The kid had magnificent honey comb eyes, dirty blonde hair (messy Ivy League cut), carried around a teddy bear named Nash. The kid had somehow squeezed himself comfortably between Castiel and Dean, tiny omega within the kid purring loudly in happiness. Both Dean and Castiel were forced to break their handholding to accommodate Gem. Castiel couldn’t help but have his heart melt at the sweet pups movements and behavior.
I got this, Sammy!
Dean’s eyes diverted to his lap, voice sounding almost croaky as he replied, “Yeah Cas.” The alpha took some time before he aimed his glassy eyes at Cas, slapping on a small smile that looked forced, trying to sound cheerful as he said, “But, cuddles and hugs are still something we can do! That’s awesome….right Cas!? No harm done!”
“It’s Sam!” Sam huffed out with a roll of his eyes.
Cas pulled out of the hug and smiled shyly at him, “thank you for showing me how to play pool, Dean”.
A burly looking, stormy faced death dealer came marching through the vamps. The man stopped before the lead vamp, bowing, “Yes, Master Craven”.
Before Charlie could answer, a deep, gruff voice replied, “It’s called stripes or odds”.
“Pino, Nina, Lenny, Misha and Queen Rose!” Kaylen replied with so much enthusiasm he nearly spilled his lemonade drink, clutching it steadily just in time.
“How long?”
Where anyone else currently standing on earth might hum in consideration, fill the air with some kind of noise to keep the flow of conversation, Castiel remains silent a beat or two too long to be comfortable until he’s found the words to speak.
“No, no,” Dean says, cutting the air with the flat of his hand. “You’re not—that’s not true.”
“You don’t exactly have the most untainted metric for ‘alright.’”
Dean goes boneless.
“I do,” he says, rather than try to voice the immensity in his throat. “Very stupid.”
“Miss dropping my ass in the middle of a conversation?”
Now, standing in front of the real deal, Dean knew there wasn’t a picture, painting, hell, any translucent fragment of stained glass that could capture the person before him. Dean wanted to slump into him in relief and, from the look on his face, Cas might even allow it. He settled instead on the most stitched together smile he could manage.
“I’m,” Cas says from where he’s already steps away from the hallway. He gestures over his shoulder. “Enjoy your coffee.”
“I’m still clearing out boxes of what I can only hope aren’t cursed objects from the closet near my room,” Cas says. “The cult presence is very much a lingering one, Dean.”
Dean leans on his hip against the kitchen counter. “Need me to check on anything else?”
“They really don’t make ‘em like they used to,” Dean says, scratching onto his list. “Hey, Cas, you saved some of that ground beef like I asked you to, right? I was gonna show Claire how to grill a real burger if she makes it down this weekend, how’s it sound?”
time that happened.”
Cas stares a beat more, looks away. “Thank you.”
“Hey.”
the cage-free ones are?”
“Whatever,” Cas says, like he’s tasting it, so Dean’s a little jealous of a goddamn word now, but it’s fine. The tension around his eyes doesn’t entirely go away and Dean doesn’t even mind; the lines of his face when he squints have always kinda made the back of Dean’s knees go hot anyway.
Castiel tilts his head. “Ideas.”
“Oh.”
, like he’s twenty-two in the dirtiest bar of his life and he knows it’s the only move he’s gotta make, like the rest’ll just fall into his lap.
Dean laughs, feels it soft inside his mouth. “Right, right,” he says. He screws one eyebrow up. “Were we ever so young?”
“Perhaps.” Cas is almost smiling again, so similar to his face on that old lonesome bend of road. “Not many as human as you.”
Sam smiles.
Castiel hears his plea like any other prayer and meets it with the thrill of finally encountering an inquiry he can satisfy. It is, like all questions, an answer as well: a yes, the same one that will never rest in Michael’s hands.
are? I should be apologizing, I mean,” Dean waves a hand. “In the kitchen? I was being a dumbass. I just—I shouldn’t have done that, uh—kissed you. It was stupid of me.”
Dean’s startled out of his thoughts by the heavy sounds of the bunker door. He looks up from where he’s pinning chicken wire to see Cas squinting up at the sun with something cupped in his hands. He sets down his tools.
“Okay, I just—when did you
“No, you don’t get to—we’re still talking about this,” Dean says, trying his level best not to smile. “Velma is not—she hit on my brother, dude!”
He tosses it up and over to Dean, and it arcs through the air nothing at all like any blade either of them have ever borne; Dean feels himself cut wide open all the same.
“Huh?”
“I couldn’t see it then,” Cas says, pauses. “Or, at least, I couldn’t read it for what it was—but I know the whole of it now.”
Sam strolls in just exactly a second later, only enough time for Dean to whip around towards the coffee machine at a speed that is definitely, definitely suspicious.
Dean blinks. “What, like—”
Sam shrugs. “They were advertising for chicks.”
It’s not a direct no; Dean’s done much more with much less. Besides—maybe he’s just projecting his own relief, but hadn’t Cas’ face been folded in a rare sort of smile when they’d first landed alone on this stretch of back road? Maybe it wasn’t a full one, but he’d been happy to see him, Dean’s nearly sure of it—and, boy, had he been happy to see Cas.
, man.”
The machine beeps. Dean breathes, in and out.
“Given my limited time on earth, most probably no.”
“Hey,” he says, face buried in the side of Cas’ neck, his attempt at halting successful. He’d known it would be.
“Oh.” Dean’s left eyebrow pops up, drawing the same half of his mouth with it, as if Castiel’s just said something shocking, pleasing, equally both. “Yeah, why not.”
Cas tilts his head, resting it at the angle and considering him. “I’m just thinking,” he says, as if he ever just does anything. “It took me a while.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he can’t see Cas’ exact expression. He can’t turn any closer either.
that game. Or he
said he was in love with
There’s a beep of disconnection. Dean stands for a moment more before pushing away from the counter to snap his already black-screened laptop shut. He should probably start making room in the fridge.
“I don’t know, he sleeps in my room? You walked in on us like, four different times?”
“What?” Dean says. His eyes flick between Castiel’s as he fails to speak. “Are you gonna tell me you, ah,” he swallows, “‘find my lack of faith disturbing’ or whatever again?”
“The—no, but that is compelling,” Dean says. He sets his beer on the nightstand, already too close to spilling it all over his bed. “The shit that bothers me is—how are his friends working this Gargoyle King thing? If I remember last season, the guy with the hat—”
He takes the lapse in conversation to catalogue the progress of Cas’ garden—if it can really be called that. Dean’s not claiming to be an expert at tilling the earth—maybe there was always gonna be more Cain in him than Abel in that regard—but the haphazard splay of plants doesn’t look much like any cultivated plot of land he’s ever seen. But what does he know, maybe this is just how they did in ancient Mesopotamia or something, cucumber vines crawling random and haphazard all over half barrels filled with pepper plants.
“Sure you don’t,” Dean says. “The show’s pretty to look at, I’ll give you that much, but if you try to dedicate even one of your other senses to it,” he screws up one side of his face in a grimace, “radio interference, man.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, squinting himself. “Maybe.”
“Alright then,” she says, shoving her hands deep in her apron pockets. She gives them a tired smile, one Dean knows from experience is a son of a bitch to shake the dust off and put on. “We do close up in about twenty minutes, so you’d better eat quick.”
“What?” Sam says, laughing a bit. “It is good!”
Cas’ eyes remain narrowed, but Dean can hardly care. There’s an excitement underneath his skin, one that’s tired and strange in its calmness. It’d been a close call, and he can still feel the weight of Zachariah’s hot, faux breath on his face before it’d been replaced with cool roadside air. His eyes are still stinging with it, both the quick transition and its accompanying relief. More than that, even just sitting in a restaurant after 72 hours of fighting for his life in some savaged wasteland, after seeing the devil wear the skin of his brother like it’d been born for him—returning to a world that makes even a lick of sense makes Dean want to kiss the tacky formica tabletop. Maybe slip it some tongue.
He waits for the creak of the floorboards that means Sam’s continued on whatever Cas seeking mission he’s currently on, but gets some from the opposite chair instead. He glances over to see Sam settling in with raised eyebrows.
Sure, that year? The fact of it’d been easy. He just had to think a little something like:
you. Now hand over the remote, we’re done watching cartoons.” Cas begins to, then draws back with a wary eye. “What?”
Dean huffs a laugh, ignores him. “Listen, man, I wasn’t trying to stop you.” He was. “I wasn’t.” He really, really was. “You should be doing whatever you want now, right? Free will, wasn’t that the whole point of this?”
, what kind of dumbass is he—is way, way too close for comfort.
“Your brother is,” Castiel stops, remembering Sam’s bowed and weary head. To say the word well would be to misspeak. “I believe the worst of it is over.”
Cas dodges his gaze, looking anywhere but—the bird in his hands, Dean’s tools on the ground. He smiles a little, sick and sad small.
“Sure do.”
“Nah, it’s just—you don’t often spare enough time to give a sendoff, y’know? Work must be
Sam-we-have-to-go-
Castiel follows the movement of his hand in all its nonchalance and almost wishes it was moving against him instead.
“Just—just this once.”
“Texting Jack,” Dean says, squinting down at the screen. “He’s gotta have something to say about this—hey, do you know if there’s, like, a prison emoji?”
The red glow of the cheap bedside clock reads sometime past midnight, finally ticking the scales over into Thursday. Not that the particular date matters, except in that it inches them ever closer to the apocalypse. Maybe as an earlier iteration, Castiel would have wondered at this, the lost and godless week, Sunday here and gone again without her holiness; what significance is held in seven days if no one observes the God who made them? But now, everywhere that is profane has become a sort of home, one that’s rooms echo with a hallowed afterimage—the cross that forms on the patterned floor from the shadows of multiple light sources is as much a crucifix as anything else.
It’s not a penance, unless it is, unless it should be, but it’s not. It’s just—Dean’s giving him some space. Both of them some space. It’s not his fault it stretches into the next week.
When he comes back into himself, “Dean.”
“I’m not growing onions,” he says. “It was too late in the season.”
Sam hums. “Look, Dean, it’s tough, but you were right to stop things, if you don’t feel the same way. I mean—”
“—but thank you, for telling me—”
“Hey, hey,” Dean says, breaking out of the kiss as far as the door behind his head will let him. His mouth is buzzing. “Cas. You gotta let me—c’mon, you’re wearing, like, the entire men’s rack. Gimme a hand here.”
It goes on long enough that he forgets the incendiary event, enough that he loses a bit of himself in a whine as Cas breaks it and rolls off of him slightly to reach for the bedside table. He hears the click of the cap and remembers quick enough.
“I—Cas,” he says, and hopes that counts. Ain’t it a confession, of sorts? Isn’t everything?
“Yes,” Cas said. He was looking at Jack with a strange intensity, one so well-worn on his expression it ceased to be odd. “Jack.”
He adds another finger. He’s right.
“Dean.”
“Right,” Dean says after a moment,
Sam rolls his eyes. “I’ll, as in Eileen and me,” he says. “You’re staying here.”
“It was.”
“Let me, let me,” Cas says. “Let me take care of you.”
Mm, mm, mm.
“That’ll work great.” She gives him a half nod and turns on her heel back towards the kitchen, barely getting out of earshot before Cas beings to speak—which, for Cas, displays restraint of epic proportions.
Dean blinks. “Whatever?” He grins, but it’s tinted with the crease of his brow. “You don’t know what you’re signing up for here, Cas, I could be into some kinky shit. Not that—wait, uh,
“You should—”
Cas smiles a little, clouded by the crease of his forehead. “I know you weren’t.”
Dean stays on, the black screen of his phone warm against his face. He doesn’t really have much left to say, but Cas might. Or he might not. Either way, it’s not like he has anything better to do than stand here, socked feet on kitchen tile and ear on the line.
Nothing ever did.
John Winchester who was a few meters ahead, turned warm green eyes at his son and omega mate.
He knew that Dean was just speaking an honest observation, however, he couldn’t help but feel as if it meant that his eyes were dull, lifeless and….boring. Yes, his brother’s sapphire eyes could tame the most vilest of beasts- he has experienced its power to calm and he has seen how brilliantly attractive it was.
Castiel helped support Dean as he tried to put one foot in front of the other.
She glanced back at Cas,
It was just for him to hear. And boy, did that resonate loud and clear- fear and worry filling him up. He needs to warn Sam about the Milton’s, later. Right now, they needed to know more than just a few words of the ‘
