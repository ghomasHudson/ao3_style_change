The song ends. Parting ways with Eileen had upped the gravity in his room, and he realises it’s not the hunt that’s bothering him, but the hollowness that follows: the oppressively ugly and peeling wallpaper, the bed that’s too big and too lumpy, the pressured silence of empty air.
The child had been blessed with the gift of sight, growing to become a powerful psychic far ahead of her time. The first psychic. Gabriel, in particular, had found her fascinating — startlingly quick wit, fierce protective love, beautifully divine. Cas had watched her like a hawk, certain then in the lie of man’s violent nature. Cas had thought her something more than human back then, though he knows now that he hadn’t understood her properly. She had been not more than human, but more human. Humanity distilled into her.
“Jody, I —” Dean fails to release the clutch and stalls out for a second. He puts the key back in the ignition.
Dean understands, really, that Sam wasn’t afraid to tell Dean. Rather, he was afraid to tell anyone. He was afraid to speak the thing and make it real. Sam, like Dean, understands that wanting something is the first step to losing it.
Sam bends to grab the shovel. He could go for a snack. The Indian place had been amazing, but it’d also been hours ago.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean snaps, even though he knows. Dean is a coward, and Cas is calling him on it. Anger rises by the league. “Why were you even looking for me?”
Dean had chosen love, over and over again. Dean preferred death via hypovolemia to denying someone else a single drop. Cas had held Dean to his chest, covered him in his embrace, sworn again to protect him — like he had in Hell, like he had in the waiting room, like he had in front of every good decision he’d ever made.
Dean has a new hatred for singers whose lyrics he can easily decipher. He wishes desperately for more Gang of Youths — arching metaphors, rumbling tones, and lyrics he doesn’t understand. Missio continues, unaware of Dean’s desperate desire.
He takes off the headphones, stuffs the walkman in his pocket, leaves the whiskey on the table, and finishes the dock in silence.
Depending on schedules, the girls, Jody, and Donna all variously pop in for game night. And Dean does mean Pop In, literally. They live too far away to drive down, but Jack is always delighted to go get them.
He looks back at the paper. He is resilient. Well, he was. He took all of Chuck’s beatings —  metaphorical and literal — and he’s still here. He’s still kicking.
They’re all so caught up in increasingly more obvious and ludicrous ways to cheat that everyone is surprised when Jack mutters, “I’m not sure I understand the rules of this game,” and Kaia responds, “I do,” before placing her last card victoriously on the table.
Cas finishes prying Dean’s hand off the walkman, and Dean hears the gentle clink of it being put back on the desk, but Cas’s hands don’t stop caressing his fist. Peeling back his fingers to find his palm, Cas slides his hand where the walkman had left its indentation. Dean keeps his eyes closed through Cas’s gentle minstrations, keeps his eyes closed as Cas tugs Dean’s left hand between them, keeps his eyes closed as Cas pulls him apart.
It doesn’t even get a laugh. Dean usually loves her Deaf jokes. Instead, he merely signs “but” and “girl” with his eyebrows furrowed.
She looks at the text again. Seems casual enough. Plus, she knows the boys are used to hunting in pairs. This is probably Dean’s version of being friendly. Probably bored with Sam heading out for the Lunar Ceremony.
Dean’s foot taps along to the beat. What? It’s a catchy song. Dean listens to it once, restarts it, and then is struck with a thought.
Confused about how the angels could be at all related to this, Dean says, “What?” but it’s clearly too quiet to even register.
comes back over the headphones, he’s about halfway done, so he restarts again and let’s that carry him to the finish. The second time it comes around he picks up
Dean will do better, he decides, sliding his hands back into the Buick’s trunk. He’s carried things heavier than himself. He can do this.
He thinks about how she never let them down. He thinks, for a second, about Bobby and all the things Dean never told him. He thinks
“I’ll go with you.” It was the way Cas let Dean talk about things — actual, real things — without making him feel too weak for not being able to handle it himself.
“I —” This time Dean cuts Cas off, and it’s not on purpose, but after that closeness, it feels wrong to not be touching him. Dean lets his left hand float forward and squeeze Cas’s arm the way it always wants to.
Sam and Dean’s little “Hello, we’re Feds” thing is endlessly hilarious to Eileen, mostly because Sam is still a little uncomfortable with pretending to be a federal agent, but also because it's insane that it still works. There’s no denying that it's efficient, but then again, Eileen’s also never shown up on the FBI’s most wanted list. Eileen usually sticks with “nosy reporter” or “distraught friend of the deceased.”
Dean wasn’t sure that he deserved a soft ending, but Sam and Cas insisted. He knew better than to stand between them and something that they wanted. Dean hadn’t been sure there was peace for someone like him, at least not peace that didn’t come at the point of a knife or the wrong end of a gun, but here — right here — he feels it. The languorously stretching expanse of life that he doesn’t have to fight for. He feels life.
him. Dean had stupidly, idiotically mentioned her too many times and Castiel had asked, and Dean remembers scream-singing Blank Space in Baby, and nudging Sam into singing along. Cas had sat in the back seat and laughed with them.
The song starts, but Dean is staring at “Light of humanity.” like it might somehow make sense. There’s even a period at the end. The song mocks him gently with
Dean is trying to bring his hands to grab the heart, to stand and knock it out of Cas’s hands, to do anything but kneel miserably at the edge of Cas’s pyre. He can’t. His chest is flayed open, jagged ribs jutting in every direction. He can’t draw breath to speak other words.
Because here were the facts: Castiel loves him. Cas is in love with him, but also. Cas didn't want him to know, and he'd only told him with the intention of fucking off and dying forever. So, Cas loves him — but he doesn't want him. And Dean knew this. He knew this because Cas's words rattle around in his head anytime there is a silence for more than two seconds. Because he pulled them apart one hundred times, in every lull in conversation, and every time the music took too long to flip over to the next song. Like right then, the silence stretching between them as Cas stared at Dean and Dean valiantly tried not to think
“You’re going to regret that,” Isabelle hisses, gesturing at the Marid’s head where it drips on the counter. The air shifts. A flicker of fear seeps down Eileen’s spine.
Distantly, Dean is aware that something is not right. He hears the soft squelch of wet flesh and glances at the maw of teeth in Cas’s hand. He realises that the drips of blood hitting the floor aren’t coming from his heart, but from Cas’s mangled hand. The heart, bursting with razors and knives and hellhound teeth, has bitten Cas’s hand and is steadily devouring whatever else it can. Cas is looking at Dean with beautiful, happy, blue eyes, and Dean is frozen.
“Dean? All Good?” Sam’s voice floats in from the other room, but it’s clear from the sound that he’s walking towards the kitchen. Dean shoves his face in the fridge to buy himself a second to take one more breath.
Dean, fist uncurling, pulls himself off of Baby’s frame, makes his feet walk to the door, slides past the bunker’s wards — they don’t have anything that keeps Dean out — and walks in.
“I —” Cas’s response is cut off by something Zadkiel says, and Dean can’t make out the quiet conversation that follows. After a good few minutes of conversation, Dean picks up the nail gun and walks it back to the tool table. He’ll clean up the rest later.
Cas sits on the bed. There is a comfortable silence for a few moments, as Dean fiddles needlessly with things on his desk.
Dean’s ears are tired from the screaming, and his body is tired from everything else, so he lays down on the hard motel bed and falls asleep with no complaints.
It had almost been comforting to realize that this was simply another nightmare about things he could never have.
Dean’s quiet surprise after each affectionate act Castiel proffers, no matter how small, means that Cas hopes to tell Dean “I love you” in some form every day for the rest of creation.
He’d died. He’d probably died a hundred times at this point, but he got up. He got up, and he kept fighting, because someone had to.
. He had smiled brilliantly and ran over to hug Sam, babbling about how he'd fixed Heaven, and how Michael and Adam could watch over it for a while, and how he was sure they'd come get him if he was needed. The stupid kid had even waved when he showed up. Waved and said, “It's me, Jack” — like the shape of his face and the curve of his shoulders weren’t seared into the back of Dean's eyelids. Like Dean isn't haunted in his sleep by the two angels he failed.
Cas loves him. It still surprises him sometimes, though he can hardly conceive a version of himself that doesn’t.
Slamming the nozzle back into the gas dispenser with more force than strictly necessary, he tries to shrug off acting like a 4 year old.
That was okay. Cas isn’t going to be mad about it. Cas liked it. And it’s not like anyone else was there, so no one else would know.
Dean flips the walkman over in his hand and checks it for cracks. It's a tough piece of technology, which explains why it survived this long, but Dean knows better than to expect things to be unbreakable. It seems to have survived Dean for now, so he slides the headphones back on and restarts the song.
Dean pulls out the paper. Reads “11. Angels Of The Get-Through by Andrea Gibson” and “12. Leave It All Behind by Sleeping With Sirens.” He needs to remember that Cas is gone. Leaving.
When he finally lifts it, the flowers are still there, the mixtape almost taunting in its familiarity.
Dean pulls into the bunker halfway through Hold on To Your Life, but it could have been John Cage 4’33” for all that Dean was paying attention. Something is happening in his chest and between his ears, and he can’t really focus on anything other than that.
‘No,’ he thinks as he coats the bones in salt and kerosene. ‘The hunt isn’t the problem — uh, situation.’
She runs off, presumably to tell Claire the news. Dean stands up to wash their mugs, and his hands for good measure. The coil of Alistair's voice creeps inside him, a reminder of how prettily Dean had begged. He carefully dries the mugs and puts them away.
He slides the tape into the walkman, which he nestles in his pocket. He doesn't have headphones, but he doesn't think much about that fact. He has the walkman in his pocket, and his Colt tucked into his belt.
The thing is, Dean is pretty sure he’s technically 80 years old. He doesn’t usually examine the fact that he’s spent about as much time topside as he did down below, but he knows that on his best days he’s somewhere between half of a man and half of a monster.
She discards her sunglasses in the passenger seat, even though the sun hurts her eyes and the sparkle of blue is a bit distracting. She revels in knowing she won’t be caught off guard, in knowing that Sam and Dean understand it without her having to explain.
Dean, because he knows this is the one single thing that Castiel has asked him for, goes for the throat. Finds enough anger to punch against the sliding black.
The next song starts off strong. It’s heavy and atmospheric, and more Dean’s style. He can get behind
Cas wonders if he somehow learned the wrong lesson, because now, thousands of years later, he rejects it. He will not accept Dean’s pain, at least not as part of him — only as something done to him. Cas doesn’t begrudge Dean his anger, or his grief, or his pain, but he rejects his suffering. Dean isn’t made of suffering. He’s made of love.
From the bed, the abandoned walkman taunts him. After the disaster of Eileen playing the mixtape in the car, Dean moved it from Baby to his walkman, tossing it aside not to be thought about again.
Regardless, Eileen doesn’t like to dwell on dying. It’s far from a happy memory. She also knows she’ll never forget it. That being said, she’s hardly going to dump that on Dean Winchester at 2 o'clock on a random sunny afternoon as they walk to interview a witness. Instead, she shrugs and says, “It’s not like I could see it.”
“Howdy, Cas.” He tosses out, because he’s an embarrassment. Their staring contest is broken when a young man with curling red hair and a slight build makes himself known from his position behind Cas.
makes sense, since being a human after being an angel must have made Cas feel weak and confused, but the
Dean takes a breath, and then he thinks, "Fuck it. I've already made a goddamn fool of myself," and plugs them back in.
Because she’s not an idiot, Jody picks up on his agitation. “Dean?” She looks out over the water where Dean is staring like she might identify a threat.
Dean shoots Sam, Cas, and Jack a message saying he’ll be home a day later then he planned, since he’ll be following Claire and Kaia to the concert tonight instead of going home as anticipated. Claire had nearly extracted a blood oath during breakfast about it, so there is no way he’s backing out now.
Dean tosses the half cleaned intake manifold onto the work table and leans against it. Sam loves him. Cas loves him.
It’s...very passive, he realizes. It’s patient, and waiting, and it asks for nothing. It requires nothing from Dean. In fact,
Listen, Dean has had a very long day. He's tired. He wants to sleep. As he's pulling the headphones off his neck though, he settles them on his ears and lays on his bed, fully clothed.
. Unbidden, Dean thinks of Sam. Sam, who he carried out of a fire, who he carried out of Hell, who he carried out of a normal life. Sam, who carried him out of Apocalypse world, who pulled him back from Hell, who made Dean remember there was a point to having a life.
Eileen hangs around the house while Dean sets up in the nest. She steals a fizzy water (after taking a moment to snap a picture of the full-sized fridge filled entirely with La Croix — it’s not like Isabelle needs to eat food, Eileen supposes) and wonders if it’s inappropriate to take a selfie with the decapitated Marid head for Sam.
He pops the mixtape out of its case and slides it into Baby. As he waits for the garage to open, Dean pulls out the two papers. The first one says “1. The Deepest Sighs, The Frankest Shadows by Gang of Youths,” and the second has a corresponding “1.” beside the text “Light of humanity.”
Dean cooks up some bacon because why the fuck not, and then he's on a roll and already has a greasy pan, so he makes eggs and sausage, too. They all eat and discuss plans for the day. It's only when they're putting away the plates that Dean realizes they're out of eggs. Cas and Jack have Heaven business, and Sam has an Irish lore question he wants to answer (aka: he wants to Facetime Eileen and is using leprechauns as an excuse to do it. He's not even ashamed about it). When Dean gently teases him, he just shrugs his massive shoulders and says, “Whatever works, am I right?”
The foreign song comes on just as he's settling back into bed. His alarm says it's 3:30 in the morning, which means Dean actually got a decent bit of sleep, but he doesn't want to deal with Sammy calling him out for being awake before him 2 days in a row, so he closes his eyes and lets the song play to the end.
A/N: Sorry. Time is an illusion and we forgot what Fridays are! Also it's possible that Yar didn't realize that she had to hit the post button. This is why Non is in charge 😂
For Leave It All Behind, the paper reads “12. Legacy.” Dean has no idea how that relates. He still has no idea what the song is trying to say. He remembers a brief moment, when he thought maybe Jack would be their legacy. That the world would be safe, and they could retire and enjoy just living in it.
She strides out of her motel room to see the black car glinting under morning light, more carefully maintained than Dean’s own body. As she approaches, Dean smiles and leans over. He pushes open the passenger door, carefully sliding his journal and his phone off the seat, making space.
“Doing what?” Cas asks, confused. Sam flaps a hand in his direction, which is how Cas realises his hand has drifted up to gingerly touch his lips.
“Yeah? He need a — whatever you call it, a second, or something? Or is this more theoretical stuff?” Dean replies, looking to Sam with easy-going curiosity, like the biggest issue he could possibly have is whether or not Sam will be around for dinner so he doesn’t mistakenly make too much food.
Dean can’t think of a single thing Cas is getting out of this. Before, maybe, with a different Dean, or a different Cas. But, this Cas was happy, had a purpose, had power. He didn’t need Dean to teach him anything because he’d already learned it the hard way. Dean, who thought he’d reached the bottom before he first met Cas, knows he found a way to sink further.
He’s got a couple hundred miles to go before he can make it to the bunker, but he’s thinking about what happens when he gets there. Nothing’s changed, except now Dean knows that they’re dating in Castiel’s mind, which means everything has changed. He rewinds the tape to the very beginning, like that might somehow reveal how that happened to him. Hell, he contemplates pulling out the first tape and trying to rip that apart for clues, too. He didn't think he’d be alive in a post-Chuck world, let alone this. He just can't figure out what Cas is getting out of this arrangement, and he has to figure it out. If he can’t, he knows he won’t be able to keep it. Cas is good at leaving, and Dean — Dean is really bad at asking people to stay.
The car ride to the motel is mostly comfortable, but Dean still seems agitated about the thousand dollar bowl of fake produce. Eileen would talk about it more, but while Dean seems comfortable hurtling down roads with his eyes on the passenger seat, Eileen is (as usual) very invested in not dying.
Dean feels his shoulders rise. Sam spends a few more seconds screwing up the courage to speak, and in the silence, Dean hears every single time Sam left.
Dean blinks. Sam’s in the foyer, and is totally fine. Dean is going to grab them all some beers and go join them. He just needs to put back on his skin. He needs to check his hand to make sure there is still skin. He needs to move his hand.
The first says “2. Schoolin’ Life by Beyoncé.” Dean should have figured. Cas really likes Beyoncé. He was honestly surprised she hadn't shown up earlier. The song gets soft at the end, and Dean listens to
Cas frowns down at the headphones. Pouts, even. It’s the sort of confused sadness of an angel who makes a man a mixtape and then walks in on him violently shattering his headphones on a wall.
But Cas is in his room, late at night, and Dean is only human. Dean slams into him like a hurricane, and Cas opens, suddenly and easily, surging into the kiss. Dean’s hands are frantic, pushing at Cas’s coat, his blazer, his shirt. Cas is wearing way too many layers — always too many layers — and Dean would have him out of them by now, but Cas is relentless. Cas kisses like Dean is a war he intends to win, and Dean keeps losing focus. Buttons are surprisingly difficult when he can’t bear to keep his hands away from the small parts of Cas’s already exposed skin.
And then Jack asked the question that Dean was pretty sure damned him. Hindsight being 20/20 and all.
Dean knows he should be grateful that it didn’t go further, that he didn’t have it for longer. It’s lucky that Cas was able to realise what Sam always knew — that loving Dean isn’t a good enough reason to stick around — before Dean got too used to him being there.
. He executively decides that the details aren’t Jack's problem, and specifics aren't necessary here. “I made some mistakes, Jack. And, unlike you, I did know better when I made them. And then, in Hell, I made more mistakes, and I started the Apocalypse, and I brought demons and angels down on the world. And on Sammy. Hell, I got Cas injured or killed more times than should even be possible.” It doesn't hurt as much as he expects, to admit to Jack that all of this was his fault. He thinks it's because he knows that Jack needs to hear it. Jack needs to not blame himself, and Dean can give him that.
Eileen is used to hunters like Dean who think they’re the best at what they do. She’s worked with several. Dean’s arrogance might be justified, but it’s probably still arrogance.
Which, like, get it Sammy. She's way out of all of their leagues, but she seems to find Sam tripping over things because she winked at him amusing, so more power to them.
Dean doesn’t even pretend like Cas needs permission to keep pulling Dean apart. Cas has been doing that since the day that they met. Dean doubts a little thing like Dean desperately wanting to stay together would change that.
The next song doesn't have lyrics, which is great, but also awful, because it leaves Inside Out rattling in his brain. He can't steer himself to any other thoughts with the dark and atmospheric piece playing under it.
He deflects, fast. “What about you? Anyone in your life?” He peppers her with questions as she talks about Rob. He’d vetted Robert Costa (age 43, SSN 154-76-2612, criminal record, but only for being arrested at protests) as soon as the two of them had moved in together, but it's not like he’s going to say that. Dean likes Rob. Rob is way better than the guy she’d dated immediately after Dean. Cassie’s string of lovers was a bit like watching a step program where each one is better than the last. Rob was a good man, and a gentle person.
They toy with the idea that the monsters are actually selling some of the organs on the black market. Dean quiets for a moment, types a few words on his laptop, then swivels it to face Eileen.
Safely, in his own head, he lets himself accept that. He didn’t want to. Hell, he never wants to, but he did get back up. Again and again.
But now she has Sam. And Jody and Donna, who are constantly trying to get her to ditch game night for wine night. And Cas, who perfectly rivals her in snark and wit.
She wants. She sends Sam the bathtub emoji instead of saying so. He knows. She knows he knows. That’s more than enough.
The anger rises atop a wave of relief. Of course Cas left. That’s what Cas does. He lies and says he loves you, then leaves you in the dust. Maybe Cas thinks he loves Dean, but no way this is love. That's not how it works.
Cas, fully powered and able to choose anything in the world, has chosen to date Dean, the moron who got him killed and can’t even say I Love You back without panicking and explaining that he means like a brother. Dean drains the glass.
“When did you meet?” Dean is calculating whether or not he can just slide Baby into reverse and drive away, but Claire and Kaia are grabbing their stuff from the backseat to transfer over to Claire’s shitty Volvo, and he’s not actually willing to run them over.
Perhaps, he has failed language. Either way, Cas can not locate the next phrase to say, unclear how to articulate the emotions he’s navigating.
Dean bites into the burger. Maybe, if he can understand why Cas would feel the way he does about Dean, he can figure out a way to stop him from realizing that he’s wrong? The old, patented Winchester “fake it till you make it.”
Cas wishes he knew what they were fighting about. He doesn’t want to fight. This fight feels different, too. Cas isn’t certain why. Perhaps because he doesn’t know what they’re disagreeing on? Perhaps because they haven’t had cause to fight in so long? Perhaps because their last fight had been so bad? Perhaps because Cas can’t seem to figure out why he’s angry?
Eileen bursts out laughing, which catches everyone's attention, and then breakfast becomes a celebratory “Cas is the Fastest Angel Ever” breakfast (named by Jack, cooked by Dean). Sam is quickly bogged down in the logistics of the race, so Cas is explaining how the angels can be on earth and vesseled while not actually existing on the same plane. This is how they achieve invisibility, since true invisibility is apparently impossible. The angels had to be vesseled for the tournament, to equalise for differences in size and shape of true form.
Cas’s only consolation for having somehow miscalculated this conversation so completely is that Sam seems equally confused by this turn of events. Sam continues while Cas marvels at how Dean somehow makes talking about these things easy. “Dean is the best man I’ve ever known, and every mistake he’s ever made has been because he was trying to do the right thing. If you can’t see how good he is, then you should just…you can…” Sam trails off, either because the absurdity of that concept caught up with him, or more likely because the lack of suitable threats stifled his speech.
He remembers carving out parts of himself. Dad staying away even when Dean begged for him to come back. Sam, desperately searching, Dean’s heart struggling to keep sinus rhythm, and Dad —
The stupid plastic lane divider smacks back in a distinctly unsatisfying way. Dean punches it again.
Sure enough, Claire greets him with massive sunglasses and a frown. She’s so hungover that she doesn’t even grumble when Dean hands over the t-shirts to her and Kaia. She happily and somewhat blearily slides it over her outfit, creating a hilarious medley of grunge and flannel and Power Puff.
In the kitchen, alone, moments later, Dean returns the sentiment by wrapping his hand around Cas’s bicep in a gentle embrace as he passes by.
Cas says, “I should probably go.” Then, because he’s not allergic to goodbyes, he waits for Dean to wave him away.
Cas’s response is a strangled sort of sound, followed by the facial expression of a person mortified by their own physical responses. “Yes. I’m fine. Good, even.”
attracted to men. I mean, hell, the siren was a man for him, and there was that whole weird thing with Benny that Dean never talks about, but whether or not Dean will own up to it is a different thing.
The Aswang returns as Eileen slides her phone back into her jacket pocket. If Isabelle is surprised to see the head of the Marid prominently displayed in her counter’s fruit bowl, she doesn’t say it. Instead, she casually takes off her sunglasses and slowly stalks forward, revealing sharper teeth.
“Ah, don’t worry about it, Cas. Bring the kid to the cabin. I got some time.” Dean pops open the beer and takes a long swig, remembering that he still believed in angels the first time he tried beer. Examines the fact that he definitely has faith in at least one now.
Dean deserves a happy ending, but Sam has no idea how to give him that. Especially when Dean won’t even admit that he could want something more. That he isn’t happy.
Alex and Patience follow in short order, and a loud demand for breakfast suddenly echoes around the room. Dean is making shakshuka in a kitchen he’s too large for by the time Jody and Donna show up, and despite it probably making more sense, neither of them displace him to take over cooking.
The next song is soothingly angry. Dean would be drumming along his wheel if he didn’t have exhaustion settling in his bones. The lyrics are loud enough to jolt Dean to attention.
and Dean wonders how, after all this time, after everything he’s done, Cas doesn’t already know the answer to that.
What do you say to the person who looked at you and saw something more? How do you tell the person who died for you, a gesture that fervently and desperately made you want to live for the first time in years and years and years, to never ever die for you again?
Eileen is wondering if that wasn’t some kind of blind dumb luck, because the man across from her is staring like an idiot.
He hits the hardware store first, and then Cas's weird artisanal bakery where the snooty barista whose name is something French that Dean always forgets looks personally offended when he asks where to acquire a Pillow Pet. Dean tries the toy store, where he strikes out, so he goes to the grocery store, where weirdly they sell not only Pillow Pet unicorns but a slew of other animals as well. He grabs a unicorn for Jack and then what appears to be a blueberry cow for Sam because that's hilarious, and then he grabs the DVD of Mamma Mia and silently wonders if there is anything you CAN'T find in a Super Target.
Dean turns her on, flips on the song, and lets it play. He loops it. He plays it over and over again.
It takes him a surprisingly long time to find a blank piece of paper and purple-colored anything. He sketches out the flower with the same careful precision he uses to draw sigils and diagrams in Dad’s journal. It turns out pretty okay. It’s clearly a Gladiolus at least, and it’s definitely purple. It’s a black ink pen sketch filled in with the purple marker he’d found in a bucket of random things belonging to Jack. It’s hardly a Monet, but it’s definitely a flower. Dean contemplates writing “congrats” underneath, but figures Cas will get what he’s trying to say anyway. He folds it into his pocket and joins the noise in the kitchen.
Dean’s feelings were torrential. The tiny volume that had flooded the prayer had been overwhelming. Even with him safely in Cas’s arms, Cas couldn’t shake the feeling that Dean was dying somehow. Coming apart.
“You should tell him how you feel.” At this, Cas smiles. There is such joy in telling Dean that he loves him. While there is joy in having, there is a distinct joy in saying, in naming this unspoken tie that grew between them for years and years.
She catches him staring because she’s not blind and pops out one earbud to shoot him a questioning look.
Dean's orbiting Cas, who's orbiting the Sun, but Dean's the only one that can burn. He's not chained to a comet. He's already been hit by it full force and he's simply taken 10 years to disintegrate.
It had taken a few days for Dean to remember everything about Hell, like the memories had needed time to catch up to his body. Dean had momentarily entertained the idea that if he moved faster, pushed harder, he’d be able to outrun what he’d become.
Dean doesn't have a plan when he leaves the gun range, other than to leave the gun range. He slides into the war room, pops open his computer, and starts idly searching for a hunt. He finds two instantly, both milk runs.
The Impala is already parked outside of Mo’s Diner when Eileen finally arrives, so she gives herself a few seconds to stare at it. This isn’t going to be weird. Eileen isn’t going to let it be weird. Dean and her are friendly.
There’s something a little hilarious about the fact that they all still train Jack to be a hunter, even though he will under no circumstances be allowed to hunt. Old dogs, Dean reasons.
The singer of the new song interrupts Dean’s thoughts. He hadn’t looked ahead on Cas’s little paper, so he has no idea whose plainative
“Dean, will you hold on for a moment? I’m going to resurface.” Movement gurgles from the other end, which is good, because Dean has just now realized that when Cas said ‘followed a school of fish,’ he actually meant to the bottom of the fucking ocean. Dean is freaking out about nothing like a baby, and Castiel is taking phone calls from the bottom of the ocean.
The man’s basically naked in the library. Dean’s pretty sure he’s had nightmares that start like this.
Dean is a violent man, and Cas recognizes that. Dean looks back at the paper. Why apologise? Dean’s whole life has been defined by rooting out monsters, by putting them down.
Dean smothers a laugh into his empty hands, but he does help Sam slide 10 cards into Claire’s coat pocket when she looks the other way.
“Goodnight, Jack.” Dean flicks off the light, and makes to head out. Jack sends him off with a parting, “Good night. Love you, too.”
Cas can’t fathom what Dean could have feared, but the certainty settles in his chest. Dean had been afraid of
After everything, they had climbed in their car and driven home. Sure, Dean had been somber, but things had been insane. The strangest thing for a while was the way Dean had been perfectly fine. He’d made jokes. Hell, he’d even agreed to build Jody a dock while they were coordinating, just three days after everything went down.
He’d gotten his point across. Dean fiddles with the half cleaned piece in his hand. Sam knows. Sam doesn’t think of Dean as a needlessly violent man, and he wasn’t afraid that Dean would turn on him because he’d started learning some magic.
“So, how did you two meet then? On a job?” And Dean is too busy smirking at Claire and Kaia’s nonplussed reaction to Cassie’s non-reaction that he just fucking says, “Oh, he pulled me out of Hell.”
Dean fails. He can’t hold it back anymore — can’t even try. Sobbing, gasping nothing escapes his throat. Not nothing, it’s not nothing. It hurts.
Thinking about Sam’s insight, about the way Cas knows Dean views himself, Cas reconsiders this wild joy. He pictures the way Dean smiles softly sometimes, like his mouth has momentarily forgotten to frown.
He wants to do things that make him happy. He wants someday to be able to say out loud that one of the things that makes him happy is Cas. He wants to take Jack fishing. He wants to see who Sammy turns out to be.
Castiel is back in the bunker by the time regret catches up. It’s a short flight — less then a second — but shame moves quickly, obliterating anger and annoyance and fear. He looks down at his hand and tries to think.
He drinks the coffee. It's cold, and he's fine. He doesn't want a beer instead. He doesn't want to be asleep instead. He doesn't want anything, because he's fine. Everything is fine.
“Shut up. I’m — I’m saying, I want you to be happy, and I don’t really know how retiring would work, but I can try. We can try.”
Archly, Cas replies, “Oh, how foolish of me. To suggest that you would say something other than what you mean.” He takes a deadly step forward, and Dean feels his own stance lock in response. “You
Cas had left him. Dean had pushed him to leave. If it had been anger, Dean wouldn’t have cared if he stayed. Dean had pulled anger over something. Was it fear?
The next song is, of course, not calm at all, but bright and peppy. Normally, Dean would say it's uncomfortable how the songs jump from tone to tone, but right now he's happy enough that every song jolted him to another place until he wasn't doing anything but listening to the mixtape.
Dean and Baby cruise the open road alone, which means there are no witnesses when the song ticks over and Dean laughs so hard he actually has to pull the car over.
And Dean, even though he shouldn’t — he really, really shouldn’t — laughs. “Yeah, Cas. You’re a regular rebel. James Dean would be proud.”
and Dean is thinking about the beginning — the very beginning, Uriel saying “Castiel, he has this weakness: he likes you,” Naomi messing around in Cas’s brain, and Cas waiting and waiting and waiting. Cas had held his love like a secret precious thing, unwilling to share it even with the object of his affection.
“Aw, come on,” he starts. He has to say something, otherwise the blood will never leave his face. “Don't thank me yet. You might not even like it.”
Dean wakes up to Sammy banging on his door. His gun (not his walkman, thank god) is out and tucked under his pillow by the time Sam opens the door. Sam quirks his eyebrows like he wants to call Dean out for being jumpy, but also knows that he doesn't have any legs to stand on, so he ends up making a spectacularly constipated face and announces that everyone wants breakfast. Also, Cas brought fresh strawberries from Japan of all places, and Jack thinks they should make pancakes.
Jody meets Dean with a hug when he pulls Baby up the cabin's driveway. She holds him at arm’s length and says, “I was worried you weren’t going to make it! Did you run into trouble?” and he knows she means trouble like a hunt, or some other reason he might have been delayed leaving the bunker.
But also, good news! While we initially listed this installment as including 10 chapters, that number was a guesstimate. 10 chapters were completely sufficient for well-adjusted Eileen to complete her arc, but because our repressed boys are all NIGHTMARE humans, we're anticipating another 2-3 chapters being needed to wrap up their nonsense. Never fear! We are committed to that happy ending tag, and we will write as many chapters as we need to get us there.
He knows he won’t be able to sleep any more, so he grabs the walkman and wanders down to the kitchen.
“Oh, uh. Uhm.” Sam turns a curious shade of red for what Cas is fairly certain is an innocuous statement. He thinks of Dean often, so this is hardly surprising. “What, uh. What about Dean?” Sam bumbles out.
Dean’s mind was a mess, the prayer opened and never closed. Misery, anguish, grief poured out in sharp rivulets. Cas had felt his own tears wet his face at their depth. He put his hand in Dean’s soft hair and pulled him closer, letting Dean’s soul spill out of him and onto them both, as if that would allow Cas to lift some of its heaviness.
“You're family, Jack. And every time I made you feel like you're not, that's…that’s on me. That was MY fault. You'll always have us — me — for as long as you want me around.” Dean takes a shot in the dark. It’s a familiar task after a hundred repetitions — hunting doesn't really lend itself to good lighting. He hopes that his aim here is as true as it is with his handgun and says, “You didn't ruin anything, Jack. You couldn't ruin it. We'll look out for you and we'll always look out for you. You belong here.”
He understood even less when Dean collapsed. It was as though a hundred years of grief were escaping Dean’s body. It was beautiful. Raw. Dean so rarely allowed comfort. To be able to hold him — even not knowing why he was distressed — was a rare honor. Cas had felt the breeze in the field, so he spread his wings over Dean, hoping he wouldn’t feel the chill, hoping he’d know that he was safe.
tagged on afterwards doesn’t quite fit, since Cas is one of the bravest people Dean knows, angel or not.
Cas is still frustrated and annoyed, but the emotions stop crowding him as soon as Dean is out of the room. He resigns himself to worry. “Will they be alright?” Jack had discovered Monster Energy at a bodega a few weeks ago and had decided that it’d be cooler if Heaven operated like a bouncy castle. It’d taken Cas a whole hour to get the gravity back to right.
“Uh. Yes. He’s a man.” Eileen responds, adding a verbal component because clearly they’re having a breakdown of communication here. Out of kindness, which she’s not sure is deserved in this moment, she doesn’t add that she’s very aware that Sam is a man.
They wrap up the case pretty quickly after that. Eileen would like to see Isabelle’s memory villainized instead of martyred, but they couldn’t compellingly link her to the disappearances. Instead, they clean up prints and any evidence that could tie them to Isabelle’s untimely end, torch her body, and head towards dinner.
changes Dean's half smile into a broad grin. He’s suddenly thinking about Cas pitching an apiary for the field behind the bunker, and Cas distributing ziplocs of honey, and Cas showing up on his car covered in nothing but bees. Dean’s amusement and Cas’s persisting love of all things bee carry him to
It’d destroy Dean, too, but Dean gets that he deserves it. He treats Cas worse than anyone in the world. Worse, he can’t seem to stop himself.
For a second, he's worried that Cas is going to ask him about the mixtape right there and then. That he'll have to explain it to Sam or Jack. Instead, Cas just serves him a big smile, wide as you've ever seen.
“Jody said that I should ‘let loose’ when I’m at home and with my family. Taking off one’s uniform is a way to separate being at work and being at home, she says.” Dean’s going to send her a fruit basket, or maybe a bomb. He’s not sure. It depends on how many brain cells he has at the end of the week. “I don’t have a uniform,” Cas adds, which is hilarious because Cas absolutely has a uniform, but sure. “But I wanted to demonstrate that I am happy and comfortable at the bunker.”
Usually, it’s just Dean and the dock he’s building. He’d pick a weekend and let Jody know he was going to be working, and then either people would come or people would not. Usually not, though there was always someone around.
Not to mention dangerous. Cas’s true form would likely burn Sam’s eyes out of his skull. He reasons he should probably speak before Sam hurts himself.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel says, 3 seconds later, and presumably several thousands of miles away from where he started the call. Dean briefly worries about the data service fees Cas is probably wracking up.
“Dean! Love Languages aren't always about romantic love, remember!” And the worst thing was, Dean does remember. It really had been a whole conversation. “It's just about ways that people demonstrate and receive love.”
Dean stares down at the walkman. Oh god, are the mixtapes seduction? Is Cas pulling a “it’s been three dates, let’s nooky?”
Sam thinks back, trying to remember when Dean last talked about his cooking — wry bragging, or even just excitement about eating it. Cas had brought back dragonfruit a month and a half ago, and Dean had marveled at it. Laughed. Made some wildly good guacamole, which is not what Sam had expected, but had earned a top rating in the journal.
So, Dean doesn’t. He pulls on a casual posture and pretends it doesn’t hurt to hear the weight of Cas’s love pour so plainly out of Baby’s speakers.
“Jack decided he wanted Krunch-Cookie-Crunch at 5 AM this morning. He was not subtle about it.” He actually was reasonably subtle about it. It isn’t Jack’s fault that Dean was already awake. He’d feel bad about using the kid as a scapegoat, except that’s kinda Dean’s thing, isn’t it?
He thinks about stopping gods, denying archangels, throwing apocalypses out the window. He thinks about Sam, who turned out 600 times better than Dean, who’s still the best thing Dean ever saved.
He’s not positive when it started, but he can’t stop. He can’t stop wanting Cas. He wants Cas all the time. When he’s gone, when he’s dead, when he’s standing right there. He can’t stop wanting Cas. He tried.
and Dean sees black exploding from the lake, black sliding over Castiel, black consuming and black writhing and black and black and black.
Eventually, breakfast breaks up, Jack offering to take Patience back to college if she’ll give him a tour, Eileen taking off for the road. Goodbyes momentarily distract Sam from building a reading list.
Dean’s breathing fails. Trying to draw a breath, he hears a rattling wheeze instead. He takes three unsteady steps. He takes three more. He walks to his bedroom and closes the door. His knees cut out, and he's sliding down his door.
“You can’t lie to the kids, Cas.” Dean opens his eyes, and Cas is so close — impossibly close. Dean can see the tiny frown lines appear on his face, the way his eyebrows furrow.
He reaches Fire Fire again and listens intently, his breathing perfectly controlled. Done once, he does it again. Then again. Then again.
For a while, ruinous anger at Cas had been a relief. Dean had been able to paint over every time Cas had walked out with a searing red swath of not wanting him around anyway.
Dean’s not actually sure how many times he’s died because of Sam’s whole “repeating Tuesday” thing, which Dean really doesn’t know much about except that he ended up throwing out his Asia tape because Sam’s shoulders would always get tight whenever Heat of the Moment played. He’s also extremely tired, didn’t get nearly enough coffee at the diner, and is still somewhat reeling from this whole day. It’s not even noon.
Okay, it is. Dean doesn’t really like it. He also doesn’t dislike it! He’s just sorta...neutral on it. Like elevator music — better than silence, but not usually something you’d pick for yourself.
Cas had laughed, and said he was sure they could find a way to communicate coded messages with flowers anyway. They’d just have to be more creative. They’d spent a few minutes designing the most beautiful “fuck you” Dean had ever seen. Dean had been a little sad that he couldn’t think of anyone to send it to.
Dean listens with half a mind as Cas explains that they each compete with one set of wings from their true forms, although switching between races was allowed. That’s about when Dean realises he has not had nearly enough coffee to contemplate engaging with that right now. Jack hops into the conversation, and Dean settles at the table to share aggrieved eye contact with Eileen as he hears the words “quantum entanglement” leave Sam’s mouth.
So, yes, it’s unlikely that Dean was going to learn about bisexuality from John. The guy couldn’t be assed to go to his 11 year old kid’s play because it wasn’t a
It's not like Jack even needs a gun. He could smite most threats by sneezing at them. The kid doesn't have any dangers to protect himself from.
Cas stopped speaking, and looked at where Dean's hand curled around his trenchcoat — which made sense. It's the sort of gesture that intimates a desire to speak — but Dean didn't have anything to say, he just wanted Cas to stop talking. He just wanted.
It’s painful, but Dean listens, rewinding once. Something is pulling in his chest, a feeling that he can’t quite identify.
She slides in, comfortable, and Dean holds his hand out for a high five. They slap palms with a quick laugh, and Dean peels out of the parking lot.
Dean’s still remembering movie night, so he doesn’t think to protect himself, flipping to the other page. He reads “9. You rise.” without any fanfare. The paper is halfway back to his breast pocket before it hits him.
Sam, Jack, and Cas are all at the table when he comes in. Jack says, “You’re home!” excitedly. Sam nods. Cas smiles.
“Come on, Eileen not text you back or something? What’s got you moping at your phone like a 12 year old girl?”
“Dean.” Cas growls. It rips something from Dean’s chest until he’s shoving Cas backwards. Cas moves where Dean pushes him. That alone has Dean’s hands stuttering like he’s a teenager again, unsure of how to touch someone. Instead of thrusting Cas onto the bed like he originally intended, they make it halfway there before Dean stops pushing. Dean’s so thrilled about Cas going where Dean leads that he can’t seem to want Cas anywhere else. Standing entirely too close in the middle of the room, Dean wastes no time divesting Cas of his stupid jacket and his collared shirt. His hands are skating down Cas’s sides as he kisses the plane of Cas’s naked stomach because, really, that’s the only rational response.
By the time the gang traipses in for lunch, everyone is exhausted in the way that only prolonged exposure to sunlight can make you. Claire’s cheeks are a dusted red that smacks of sunburn, but everyone is happy, if a bit sun drunk.
“Dying for someone isn’t romantic,” Dean asserts. It would be just his luck to finally get a decent boyfriend and have said boyfriend kill himself because he misinterpreted what counts as an appropriate anniversary gift.
When the song ends, Dean rewinds the tape and busies himself with ham and cheese sliders, just in case the nachos and rice aren’t enough. Better to be safe than to leave anyone unfed.
“No. You can’t. You can’t check in on me, and make these fucking tapes, and bring me all this stuff, and you can’t—”
So what if he doesn’t deserve it? He has it anyway. He can keep them happy and safe. Dean can make himself worthy. Little goals. He just has to keep anyone from figuring him out until he’s there.
, will always be too much. Too ugly, too violent, too dark. He remembers how he’d just lost Layla’s life for his, and how not even a month later, his father’s. He knows he can’t say “you were” to Cassie, even if it was true.
Sam wanders by in running gear, bearily staring at his phone. He gets 4 full feet past Dean before he registers the strangeness of Dean standing there doing nothing. Dean scrambles to speak before Sam can hit him with another fucking lecture about mindfulness, or cholesterol, or whatever thing he’s decided Dean is doing badly today. He may be grateful that Sam turned out so much better than him, but god, does he have to be so annoying about it?
Cas regards Dean, and Dean can see that this is a line of thinking that Cas hadn’t expected, so he tries to press the advantage while he has it. “He’s your kid. You can’t just abandon him — he needed you.”
“Dean,” Cas breathes, just beside Dean’s left shoulder, as Dean tries to smother his face into his own right hand. Cas’s hand rises to rest softly on Dean’s left shoulder. There’s that horrible gentleness. That obliterating kindness. “Are you alright?”
If the kisses are anything to go by, the sex is going to be mind-blowing. God, Cas is so warm, it’s like his touch burns. Half of Cas’s touches make Dean want to sink right to his knees, while the other half have him flying apart completely.
If the first mixtape taught him anything though, it’s that Cas loves him. Dean knew that, he really did. Somewhere between Cas leaving him forever, Cas coming back, and 18 little songs piping out of his headphones, he’d actually come to accept it.
Cas responds, because Cas always responds to Dean, and Dean realises the answer to the question that had haunted him since Cas first said, “You changed me.” The answer to how he was supposed to respond: this. It was always this. Dean should never do anything but this.
“Uh,” he says moronically. “Looking casual there, Cas.” For some reason, Dean flails his hands in an up and down gesture, like Cas might not be aware of what he’s wearing.
Dean lets the Chainsmokers song come to an end because he has to. Because there is no other way to interpret this song, and also because he's feeling a weird buzzing in his chest when he tries to examine that too closely.
Dean’s half-formed prayer had echoed in Cas’s mind, then it had stopped suddenly. Dean had stiffened in his arms, ripping himself from Cas’s grip with brutal force. Dean had sharply pushed through wings he couldn’t possibly see, putting distance between them, and Cas’s confusion had returned in full force.
Dean’s capacity for self-torture is unlimited, so he reaches out. “Here. Let me.” He unrolls Cas’s sleeve, and with laser focus, starts rolling it for him.
Dean doesn’t even blink at the name, and he’s very proud of himself for his complete non-reaction. He types “Nemophilia flower meaning” and is immediately rewarded with “success everywhere.”
She’s maybe falling in love with Sam Winchester, and Dean Winchester is gonna meet her at a dinner in 15 minutes to get caught up on the case. Dean. Who raised Sam.
Dean sits in that field for an hour, carefully repeating the song. He burns it into his heart, trapping it in his chest. At some point, he looks at the first paper and reads “10. Can You Feel My Heart by Bring Me The Horizon.” He can’t make himself look at the other paper.
Cas enters a room, offering Dean the same smile he’s always given, and Dean is a raw nerve of ‘oh god he knows, he saw, he knows.’ Dean doesn’t know what he’s allowed to say, how to apologise, how to thank Cas. He doesn’t know how to fix anything.
“Woah. Hey. I’m sure your Dad loves you.” Patience’s hands tighten on her cup, nearly audible in their tension.
He sits on his bed and listens to the mixtape. By the time the Peacock Dance comes on, he's able to put on pajamas, and he's able to softly sing along to cowboy like me and I'm Beginning to See the Light while brushing his teeth, and when Covered By Roses comes to an end, the only other voice he hears is
And that was it. Excluding that one awful moment when Cas had tried to give it back, they just never spoke about it again. Dean had already said what he'd wanted to say by giving Cas the tape, and it didn't matter that Cas would have no way of knowing that he was being a 12 year old girl and giving the boy he had a crush on a mixtape full of the music his parents fell in love to. Nope, because see, Dean didn't have ulterior motives like that. It was just…music.
The main event comes out, and Claire and Kaia shoulder their way to the front of the crowd, so Dean posts up at the bar for a better vantage point. The singer grabs the mic to sing about Coffee at Midnight, multi-color lights fanning out behind her. Despite himself, Dean finds himself nodding his head along to the song. Hard not to get behind a song about coffee.
does manage to drag a smile out of him. Cas is literally the vehicle by which miracles occur. It’s a funny line for Cas to include. Cas is a real funny bastard, and half the time it's even on purpose.
Lunch could be a tense affair. Dean is tied up like a live wire, and he slid the fucking walk man into his pocket after the shower without thinking. He's stuck in a loop of fiddling with it, blushing, looking away, making eye contact with Castiel by mistake, blushing, and — Dean's really getting worried about how he's supposed to do anything today, but then Jack is stunningly delighted both by the Pillow Pet itself and by the fact that Sam has one, too (which is doubly hilarious because Dean
Dean smiles. It’s wide and genuine as he signs back, “Same.” He doesn’t say it out loud, but his eyes crinkle with his smile when he signs, “I’m bisexual.”
One's in California — a salt and burn that any amateur could take — but Dean knows Donna just finished up a vamp’s nest three towns over. She's honestly going to have to drive right over it to get back to Jody and the girls, and it just seems dumb for Dean to suit up when she's going to be done before he even gets there.
He looks at the crowd of screaming, angry fans and thinks about his Dad's explanation of what makes good music good. He watches Claire and Kaia scream along to Lavender Bones and thinks of Cas putting anything he likes and thinks
Before he can think himself out of it, he fumbles on the headphones and listens to the tape wind backwards.
Cas steps back, but then stops, turning back to Dean with questioning eyes. “You called me ‘honey’ again.”
Dean, who didn't have a plan, and never really has a plan, constructs one real fast because Jack is squeezing Dean's arm like he's got something Holy in him, and he's looking at Dean with Cas's eyes and Sam's fucking puppy dog expression.
He’s smiling a little bit to himself when he gets to his room. He really has the best older brother in the world.
After Cas died and Jack left, Sam had thought he’d been ready for Dean’s grief. He’d seen bouts like it before, after all.
Cas loves him. Cas wants him. Cas chose Dean in a room with no doors, and then chose him every day since then.
Also sorry for the mild delay in responses, and a slightly shorter chapter! But we love you ALL and happy Friday! Your comments feed my lifeblood. -Yar
Huh. Dean looks at Cas again, but Cas is giving him the look of a man who tried to save you from something, and then you walked right into it anyway. It’s halfway between ‘I told you so’ and ‘you’re on your own, pal.’
He wants Cas to stay. He wants Cas with him in this horrible motel room, with its putrid green wallpaper. He wants Cas to lay on his bed. He wants to touch him, to smell him, to have Cas pull him against his chest where he was warm and safe. He wants Cas. He just wants Cas.
Dean, who has been to exactly one concert in his life that wasn’t for a case, feels a strange thrill in his spine as they head out.
Dean’s thought about it. My God, has Dean thought about it — but that’s nothing new. Sure, maybe he’s been looking at those thoughts more directly recently, but he’s not so dumb as to pretend they weren’t there before.
“What would you have done?” Cas says, like he’s genuinely curious about what Dean’s plan in that scenario might have been. Dean doesn’t even have a response, is the thing.  Because that’s different. Dean wasn’t meant to live in this world — not like Sam, Cas, and Jack. Dean’s own life didn’t have meaning to him the way Cas’s did. Cas had died before, and each and every time, it had destroyed a part of Dean.
“Dean,” said the angel, and it's not really his name — it's just a place Castiel is stopping before he strides into a speech. Castiel says
Eileen looks down at her jumble of notes, her open journal, and the two mugs of coffee (both hers, one way too cold, one currently too hot) and manages to resist the urge to tidy up in case Dean walks in the door.
They haven’t...done anything. Dean’s had no idea how to give that to Cas, and Cas doesn’t seem to be asking. Definitely not asking the way other men who thought Dean was pretty had asked.
You know, when Dean was living with Lisa, she’d once remarked on how Dean could steer a conversation around any topic he didn’t want to talk about. She’d said his mastery of small talk and polite misdirection was borderline scary. Dean wonders where the fuck that ability went.
Eventually, Eileen finds her eyes flagging and she lets out an unintended yawn. They agree to call it a night, and there’s only a split second of weirdness at the door. Eileen’s not sure if they’re hugging goodbye kinda friends, which ultimately results in a very weird high five, Dean making a hilarious grimace before mumbling something she can’t catch and hightailing it out of there.
Dean doesn't pretend to understand it. And sure, Cas and Jack have duties in Heaven sometimes, but they always come back. They have a Tuesday night game night, where sometimes the girls and Jody or Donna will show up. They have a
Dean reaches down to the walkman and hits play before he can talk himself out of it. The tape had played out during his conversation with Sam, so it starts at the beginning, but Dean’s not in a rush. It’s not hard to wander in and out of the kitchen, doing odd jobs and watching the chili. He has to pause it for a second when he goes to change the lightbulbs in the east hallway because he drags Jack out on a whim to teach him how it gets done.
Jody’s had to put down too many friends. Dean’s not gonna put this on her as well. He can hold his crazy together for a few days. He plasters on his best smile, which isn’t difficult with Jody here and the girls piling out of the house, and says, “Got distracted with the newest episode of Dr. Sexy and left late.”
Basically, Dean likes both. Apparently that’s normal. Eileen likes both, and Eileen is the coolest person they know. In retrospect, it’s extremely likely that Rhonda had liked both. Maybe Dean isn’t broken.
“Yes.” He agrees to Sam. Sam offers him a small grin, and Cas’s own smile widens. They settle back into their books, still smiling softly when the front door bangs open to reveal Dean and Jack returning from a grocery run. Jack is talking excitedly about a target of some kind, and Dean is muttering something about child leashes. Dean nudges Jack with his shoulder and says, “Come on, kid. Let’s put these groceries away.”
He didn't vanish at all. He just sort of hung out, had dinner, and then retired to bed. Just like they do every night. Sometimes, after Jack and Sammy have retired to bed, Dean and Cas will sit around in the big armchairs and talk, or not talk — just be. But not last night. Cas had smiled at him (no black goo, just a smile), said, “I hope you like it,” and gone to bed.
Dean can’t wait till she gets to the twist in the next episode where it turns out it’s not even EvilSexy, but Juaqeem (Dr. Sexy’s half brother) in makeup PRETENDING to be EvilSexy to save Daneel.
Dean stares at the water like it personally betrayed him. He takes a sip, and it does nothing for the tightness in his chest.
“I nearly killed you.” Dean lands on, because he’s thinking of the crush of Cas’s face beneath his fist and the Mark singing for blood, but then, before he can correct, Cas slams him with —
So. Cas was going to win. Indra had faced Mariel, whose chosen wings had been fashioned after those of the golden eagle, in the semi-finals, but Indra’s experience won by mere seconds. Indra was a talented flyer. Still, he took his turns wide, hesitated in pulling close to other angels in flight, and took some time to pick up speed. Cas could win. Cas would win.
Cas had said. It wasn’t Dean loving him that Cas couldn’t have, because Dean did. It was a version of Dean that could say that, that could look at Cas and not see the million ways Dean had fucked them up. A version who could look at their lives and see a possibility for a life.
“Cas, buddy, we gotta work on how you introduce news. I thought a Knight of Hell was on my ass.” Dean shakes his head and starts to head back to the cabin.
Dean sets a little goal for himself, and it’s weird for him, since goals are usually insane things like “Free my family from the curse of Yellow Eyes” or “Kill God and secure free will for mankind” or “Stop the apocalypse.” But Dean is (maybe?) retired now, so he figures he can set a little goal for himself.
He manages to sign out a quick “Ask him about Sandy,” even though he has to finger spell Sandy. Dean is a champion, and Eileen loves to ask Sam embarrassing questions. Fortunately, Dean knows so much embarrassing stuff about Sam, like Sandy being the stuffed dog Sam owned and loved to death when he was 6, who had honestly been disgusting because Sam rarely relinquished him long enough for Dean to sneak a wash in. Sam had been attached to that thing for a year, treating it like a real dog half the time. John had thrown Sandy out while they were at school, when he’d packed up the boys’ stuff to move them to the next town. Dean doesn’t really blame him — the thing had one eye and more bald spots then Professor X at that point. Plus, Sam hadn’t really seemed surprised when the dog went missing. He didn’t even ask where Sandy was when they unpacked at the next motel.
It's pretty. Atmospheric. Honestly, it makes Dean think of streetlights and standing on the road and Castiel softly asserting, “We had an appointment.” So, Dean, like, gets it — he thinks. He's not smart like Cas and Sam. He's not going to understand Vivaldi's Four Seasons or anything. But this isn't some fancy composition. It's just a nice song.
Oh yeah. If Cas wants to drop secret tokens of affection, he’s got another thing coming. Dean’s a fucking ninja.
Dean should say something. Dean is fine. He’s fine. He is completely and totally fine. Dean just has to say something. Respond. Say fucking anything.
Most people see that she can lip read enough to get by and that’s that. Dean had always been better than average about remembering to be in her line of sight, at using movement or light to get her attention, but she’d never expected that he’d learn sign. Maybe some of the basics, like Tracy had after they’d hunted together a few times.
“Dammit, Cas. You don’t think I feel the same way?” His hand stings, and maybe that snapping noise wasn’t just in his heart. It might have actually been his hand cracking down on the desk. “You think I was happy with that? You think I enjoyed you saying — you said you loved me, and then you fucking died.” He leans forward into Cas’s space, leveraging himself off the desk and to his full height. “You tell me what the fuck I was supposed to do with that.”
“There isn’t an issue,” Sam says, because there isn't. Sam was making a big deal out of nothing, overthinking like always. “I’m just trying to figure out if I want to go.”
“You good, kiddo?” he asks, winding around her in a wide berth to reach the trash can. She starts — a sure sign that she’s not good.
He rewinds the song. He tries to decide if it's worth it to put milk in the coffee to cut down the acid of having 2 cups of coffee on an empty stomach.
Eileen is great. She’s funny and quick-witted. She’s not afraid to call Sam on his bullshit (and there is a lot of bullshit). She’s independent and smart and honestly a badass, but she likes to hang out with Sam, and Sam is running with it. They talk about stupid questions, like what fictional character would be the worst roommate, and important questions, like what makes a body yours. She’s patient with him, like it doesn’t matter to her that Sam sometimes can’t make himself touch her, or sleep next to her. That he sometimes can’t keep himself sewn together. She’d stood by him in those six months after Chuck, when Sam shared a bunker with the ghost of his brother and had no idea how to bring him back to life. She never judged him for wanting to escape that with her sometimes.
Dean hits play on the tape and sits down. Staring out over the lake, he gives Cas’s mixtape the attention it deserves.
The Banes twins are always interesting, that’s for sure. Dean and Sam had heard about Alicia walking, talking, and being generally Not Dead in the dark weeks after Chuck. They had hauled ass to be in the same town as them by morning.
Eileen’s a great hunter. Still, if it does turn out to be a pack of purebreds, she’s going to need backup. Backup Sam won’t be able to provide from his hippie retreat.
“I’m glad, Dean. I’m really glad.” Dean regards her in silence, surprised at the depth she affords that statement. “The last time I saw you — I dunno. Part of me felt like I was giving a goodbye kiss to a dead man.”
“Claire showed them to me.” Dean smiles at Kaia over the rim of his coffee mug, just an encouragement so she knows she can keep talking if she wants to. “I actually was gonna take Claire to their concert tonight, but Jody had a surprise work thing and Donna has to be back in Stillwater by 9 AM tomorrow, so I don’t think Claire will have fun if we go now. ”
Balance seems to have restored itself while he was gone, so Dean listens with half an ear while the girls discuss their plans for the day. Donna invites him on said hike, but Dean shrugs her off — after all, he didn’t come here just to ruin their weekend. He has a job to do.
“Yeah. Thanks, Dean.” Between the mixtape from Hell and the 3 year old who’s sort of his son and sort of god, also from Hell, but in a very different way, Dean figures he's actually probably used up every feeling for the rest of the month. He gives a curt nod.
Patience is just a child. She’s barely out of high school, but she’s grappling with monsters and magic on top of everything else. She hesitates against his chest for a half second before she sinks, sobbing, into the embrace. For lack of anything better to do, Dean holds her with the same force that she grips him, the same steadiness he’d use to hold a crying Sam. It’s unfair. She’s only a kid. It’s not her job to make herself palatable for her parents. She shouldn’t have to mold herself into a perfect daughter in order to earn a father.
Naomi had erased her from Cas’s mind. Her, and dozens of others. Restored now, in grace and memory, Cas inspects a lesson he learned twice. Love is not about knowing. It’s not even always about understanding. It’s about accepting.
He slides the headphones on and lets his fingers linger on his lips before hitting play. He rewinds it just a bit, and it’s not as hard to hear the words this time. Because Cas loves him, and somehow, against all odds, Cas knows that Dean loves him, too.
Dean wanders to the Buick, lifts up its hood, and sets to work rooting through the other parts. It wasn’t what he had planned to do today, since it’s long and dirty work, but it has to be done.
Cas had felt confusion, uncertainty. What he could see of Dean looked fine, but as he approached, misery was clear in the armor of Dean’s shoulders, his hand pressing into the Impala like it was the only thing keeping him upright. Cas hadn’t known what was happening.
Kaia picks up on it first and starts laughing. Cassie smiles at her. Cassie. Cas. Dean’s whole face turns red, and he realises he’s out of coffee, so he tries to make eye contact with the waiter to get more, also the check, and maybe a quiet place where he can lay down and die.
“If making Dean realise how much he matters was just about loving him…” Sam trails off, pain holding his tongue. Cas immediately realises what he’s leaving unsaid.
Dean fumbles to rewind the song, looking at his right hand a bit too long for someone hurtling down a highway. He remembers the gun in his hand, remembers staring down at Chuck, remembers wanting to blame Chuck for everything that they’d lost and strike him down the way Chuck had stripped every good thing from their life.
Dean feels a shuddering in his chest. “You’re...” She’s right. “Listen.” Dean sets his mug on the table beside Patience, placing his hand on her shoulder to make sure she hears him. “There is nothing bad about who you are.”
Hell, rage, disappointment. He could handle those. Dean knows how to take hits. He knows how to get punched, how to get back up.
Then, since the fantasy train is already in the station, he lets himself imagine more selfish scenarios. A version of himself that isn’t one bad decision away from black eyes. A Sam who is happy, healthy, and comfortable in his skin. A Jack who is happy and hale and thriving in the childhood he deserves.
The song rounds to an end, but Dean liked it, and it was new, so he rewinds it as he settles in and lets
It’s not that Dean isn’t familiar with this blinding rush of fear — he just has no idea what he’s supposed to be afraid of in his own fucking kitchen.
The world is good. Everything is fine. Dean just needs to sit here and answer the phone. That is his whole job.
“Is there a reason we’re all standing outside like morons when there are perfectly good couches inside?” Alex chimes in before Dean has to decide if Patience’s statement warrants more of a reaction.
She pokes his shoulder as they start their approach to the house, and he apologises again for being overprotective. “I’m impressed,” he signs. “I had problems with dogs after my first run in with hellhounds.”
She tries to organise what she knows about Dean, but it’s mostly stuff Sam has told her. Dean and Eileen have plenty of fun interactions. They teamed up once during a vicious game of Egyptian Rat Screw. They invented shots at the bar with that nice bartender. They brainstormed pranks. Really, Dean’s like a work friend in a lot of ways (Eileen assumes. She had one job other than hunting when she was 15 — working at a Coldstone Creamery — and honestly, she didn’t like any of her co-workers at all). They have plenty of pleasant interactions whenever they’re in the same place, but they don’t really seek each other out. They’re proximity buddies.
because he thinks he sees a blackening on the eggs, but it’s nothing that a quick spatula flip can’t save.
Jody’s hand comes down on his shoulder, causing him to turn back and look at her. “Thank you, Dean. It...that means a lot.” She smiles, but it's somewhat wobbly. “Honestly, most days I’m worried that I'm messing it all up. Hell, half the time I’m worried they’re the adults and I’m the kid.” She pulls her hand back, takes her own sip.  “I didn’t think I’d have this again. I wasn’t sure that I could.”
Cas has already seen him at his worst, already chosen to love him, knowing full well what he is. Sam won’t give up on him just because he’s weak. Jack just wants his approval and love. He’s saved the world once or twice. He can make himself into the person his family thinks he is.
But each time, Cas had come back. Now, in a world without Chuck making him bleed for the Winchesters, Cas still stays.
He remembers Sam’s surprise when he figured out he’d tried to tell Cassie about the life, but she was too smart to buy his constant stories about work out of town or accidents that explained away the bruising.
It’s exactly a week after Cas gives him the first mixtape, and Dean is in the kitchen making pasta for dinner because Cas had shown up this morning with not just tomatoes, but an entire tomato plant, and why not? Dean has to peel the tomato skins off, which is much weirder than you’d suspect, but so far all their experimentation with Cas’s dislike of them has pointed to the skins being the problem.
The latch echoes through heavy silence. Familiar sadness creeps in. Dean’s glad Jesse called about the potential nest. He’s not ready to go back to the bunker.
He holds the walkman in his left hand, and the coffee in his right, and sits at the table. 3 days, 7 heart attacks, and the full awareness of how much Castiel loves him has brought Dean full circle to the kitchen table. 4:30 in the afternoon, instead of 4:30 in the morning. The terror of having listened to the whole tape, instead of the terror of having listened to none of it.
Sam knows that. He definitely knew that. Dean’s never given up on him, but everything gets so messy in Sam’s head sometimes. Dean always accepted Sam, sometimes before Sam was able to accept himself. Dean only got in his face about it when he thought things were dangerous: the visions that hurt him, the demon blood that drove him past the edge of himself. Those were the things that Dean had rejected. Never Sam. Never anything Sam had wanted, even when it went against Dean’s own wishes.
This has the wonderful effect of inspiring a vaguely disgusted expression from Jody and protecting Dean from needing to find any additional words. Claire comes over to harass Jody, either about some concert in a few days, or dinner tonight — Dean’s not really listening — and Alex tries to hand Dean a lemonade. He stuffs another bite in his face, gesturing to Alex to drop it over on the tool table.
Sam blinks, for some reason surprised by this response. Cas thinks about how Dean would react in this moment, but Cas doesn’t think making fun of Sam’s hair or calling him a hippie would quite communicate what he intends. Cas hasn’t mastered Dean’s ability to make insults affectionate, and he doesn’t really think this is the moment to try.
Sam is a complicated pile of puzzle pieces, some parts asking to be thrown out or cut to make the final picture. If that’s true, Dean is hiding some of the pieces you actually need, tucked safely in his person. So, Eileen wants to get to know Dean. She wants the version of Dean that Cas and Sam always talk about to be the right version, not a rose-tinted construction.
The tape starts at Khooneye Ma, which is where he'd paused it yesterday, but Dean feels a weird uneasiness, so he fast forwards to the last few seconds of the Make Me Feel remix and waits for the song to switch over. He doesn't even open his computer, even though he's ostensibly at his desk to look for a case.
Just because he knows it’ll make Eileen smile, Dean glances over at Sam, then back at Eileen, then brings two fingers to the bridge of his nose to sign “Nerd”.
He briefly entertains the idea that Cas put it here as a break from getting his heart stepped on before he decides that's absurd. Cas probably didn't even think about the order. Cas probably sat in his room, decided on a song, and put it on the tape. No muss, no fuss.
Dean clenches his right hand tighter. He starts the song over. His left foot bounces, agitated. He frowns.
The next song plays for a solid minute before Dean realises there aren’t going to be any lyrics. It’s sort of elevator-esque, honestly. It’s not that Dean doesn’t like it.
Eileen attempts to choke down the slightly-too-dry burger with a swig of beer while Dean takes a phone call. When she focuses back on him, he’s finished both the call and his burger.
“You tell Eliam that being the older sibling is a serious job.” Dean lets himself smile back at Cas. Why shouldn’t he? Cas smiles so easily these days. “And tell Zad to stop wandering into trouble. Family needs to take care of each other, and I’m gonna be real annoyed if I have to hunt him down and kick his ass.”
Dean thinks about being a good son. He thinks of Cas, who loved Jack when he made mistakes, when he lost his soul, when Dean turned him into a weapon. He thinks of Sam, who Dean loved when he made mistakes, when he lost his soul, when demon blood drove him out of his mind.
, but something similar. Going on hunts with Sam, having Cas and Jack around, taking some of the phones off of Garth’s back. Sure, at some point Dean apparently started dating the man he’s been in love with for a thousand years, but Dean didn’t
However, none of this explains why Dean is standing awkwardly in the command center, except that Cas is in the kitchen, which is where Dean was headed before he realized that Cas was in the fucking kitchen.
The interview is useless because it tells them nothing they don’t already know. It’s also amusing because Dean catches sight of the fruit bowl (full of crystal fruit) and has to visibly stop himself from doing something drastic.
Dean is going to bend down and fling the walkman into the lake. He’s going to destroy it, drown it, hurl it miles away from him. He’s going to do that, as soon as he can get his fucking chest to fill with air.
Dean grumbles because he knows damn well that Sam knows how to make pancakes — he taught the bastard how — but also knows Sam's pancakes are sorta flat and sometimes have protein powder in them, so he can touch Dean's skillet with his cold dead hands.
If only Dean could split himself in two, excise all the bad parts, kill the demon that lives in his bones. Hell, maybe with two Deans, he could be half the man Cas deserves.
Then, he stops himself from stopping. Carefully rewinding, he carries himself to the beginning of Angels Of The Get Through and lets himself listen. He lets his heart fill with caulk and duct tape instead of teeth and knives. He allows the sharp edges to scrape notches into his ribs, cut his vocal cords on their way out. He lets the words hollow him out.
Eileen doesn’t comment on how this makes it harder to understand her — her mouth moving in unfamiliar ways around a pile of fangs — but only because she can make out the word “Hunter” dripping with disdain in pretty much any mouth.
“Look at that, Jodes. I mean, look at that. You did that. You can’t tell me you see that and think you didn’t do good.”
It wouldn’t be the first time that Dean has threatened the whole heavenly host for one angel, and it probably won’t be the last.
The next song interrupts Dean’s resolution. It’s louder, tonally and in volume. Dean’s ears have barely adjusted by the time the lyrics start.
He listens again, annoyed to find his foot tapping along. It’s a catchy song, if completely incomprehensible.
Cas meanders to the table, and any thoughts he might have about grabbing Cas and making him stay there, of making Cas explain the tape, fly away in the humdrum of making breakfast, then making fun of Sam, then chores, then Claire calling about something that's maybe a werewolf that turns out to be definitely a ghoul. By the time it's 8 PM, they've had a long and totally normal day, and Dean hasn't taken the headphones off his neck, but he also hasn't thought about the mixtape anymore.
Dean frees half a breath. Sam’s at the bunker, safe, and probably eating all of Dean’s leftover chicken. Dean sees the time in the corner of his phone and wonders how many minutes he spent flailing around like a particularly idiotic baby.
“Hm?” Cas responds, more a questioning noise than a full thought as he pulls his focus from the last sentence, his mind half wrapped around new ideas for wards, protection spells, and whether or not Jack would be interested in learning human magic.
“I’m —” he starts. Unwilling to turn his face, desperately trying to keep his voice level. It comes out rough and breathless. He starts again “I’m —” I’m fine. He’s fine.
A/N: We saw that you liked Dean/Eileen Sibling-in-Law bonding, so we got you some Dean/Eileen Sibling-in-Law bonding to go with your Dean/Eileen Sibling-in-Law bonding. -Non
“He was lost and confused. And he deserved better than to just tag along on the ride of our revenge trip.” Fuck — Jack deserved so much better than what Dean had given him. “He’s just a kid.” Dean adds, because Jack is maybe God now, but he is definitely only 4 years old. “He looks up to you.”
Maybe, just maybe, if Dean is really good — if he gives Cas what he wants, satiates and tires him out — Cas would stay long enough for Dean to fall asleep.
“Sorry kiddo, I’m just not up to date on the plot twists of Sofia the First, which I’m sure is more your speed,” Dean responds.
It’s obviously not a strong instinct, since it sends her to the couch with him, but it’s definitely there.
Dean looks down at the mixtape, looks at Cas’s spindly handwriting: “For You” this time, instead of “For Dean,” like it’s so obviously Dean’s that it doesn’t need his name on it. He decides to let himself have this for just a little while more.
“Your insistence that you’re not worthy of respect is by far your worst character trait, Dean.” Which, rude. Also, Dean can think of several other significantly worse things. “The angels are naturally curious about you and Sam — some have faced you in combat, others have read the gospels. Some of the newer ones feel that they owe you their lives. They know that Jack and I remodeled heaven with your happiness in mind. Perhaps this is my own bias coming through — when I seek to explain humanity to them, I often default to you.”
Dean slides on the headphones and restarts the song. He shoots a text to Sam to let him know he found the nail gun. Staring at the lake, he doesn’t think about Cas drowning or leaving. Doesn’t think about Sam afraid, alone, or dying. Doesn’t think of Jack with Dean’s gun in his face.
Dean, very graciously, pretends to ignore Sam’s shoulders sinking in relief. Dean fucked up his relationship, but he can at least smooth things over for Sam, who deserves a weekend off from everything. Plus, Dean wanted to get back to baseline, and there’s nothing more baseline than killing monsters.
“No, nothing major. One of the new angels was curious about me — had some questions.” This doesn’t seem to calm them down.  “Cas had him well in hand. Don’t stress.”
This time, he’s blinking blearily awake, pushing off his bed to stretch his arms and almost faceplanting back down. There's a mixtape sitting on his bedside table. Specifically, there’s a mixtape that wasn’t there last night.
In his defense, he didn’t have much time to ruminate. That night, Jack and Cas were flying over the salt flats in lazy loops. Cas had explained how to take sharp turns and sudden shifts without losing altitude before they passed time racing. Cas had tried to explain how to use thermals to your advantage, how to pinch your wings close to gain speed while diving. Jack had tried to cheat by manifesting a second pair of wings. Cas had still won. After a few turns, Jack had been delighted simply to fly to great heights and barrel down to the earth, leaving Cas’s heart beating loudly in his chest.
Dean’s good with change. He just doesn’t know how to get back to baseline. It’s not like he’s gonna throw Cas out of the bunker. ‘Again,’ his mind tacks on. He’s not gonna throw Cas out of the bunker,
Cas had died, and Dean had carried his trenchcoat in his trunk. Cas had died, and Dean had begged Gadreel to bring him back. Cas had died, and Dean had spread his ashes in a beautiful field beside a windmill and a brook and a blackberry briar. Cas had died, and Dean was left with nothing but a bloody handprint over a fading handprint over a broken heart.
“Cas!” Dean pleads in desperate warning. He starts, but then finds he has no good way to end that sentence.
Kaia smothers a smile in her hands, while Claire splutters indignantly for a moment. Alex says something that sounds suspiciously like, “God, you idiots,” but it’s drowned out by Claire’s much louder, “How do you even KNOW about that show?”
His phone buzzes as he starts to cut up some cilantro. He pulls out his phone and reads the quick message from Jody, which is just “Ohmygod, EvilSexy is back? I thought he was Dead!” Jody is the only person they know with good taste, but she’s a busy woman and is therefore 3 episodes behind Dean in the newest season of Dr. Sexy.
“Woah, hey now. Not all mixtapes are romantic. Sometimes, you want to make your friend a playlist for a road trip or something.” See, and the problem was, he then had 3 sets of wide eyes staring at him, and he absolutely should not have opened his mouth. “It’s, uh…it's just a way of letting someone know you're thinking of them.”
Dean coughs, tries to find a place to look where he doesn’t need to make any eye contact. He can't think of any reasonable response except, well, Cas isn't a man. “He's an angel.”
Dean decides that’s a good enough understanding of the song. Of course Castiel would be drawn to songs about choices, songs about free will. He gave up his life, multiple times, in defence of choice and free will. It's just a song that Castiel likes and he put it on the mixtape. No further reason to pull it apart.
“And no one even cared how much you took. I made a bowl of soft serve ice cream with Fruit Loops and Cocoa Puffs. No one even blinked. Charles high fived me!”
It’s not that he’s uncomfortable being wanted. Plenty of people want him. Dean’s always found that kind of attention carefully flattering. However, those are people who don’t know him. People who like Dean for his shell. People who probably wouldn’t care if it was Dean inside or Michael.
Eileen starts puttering around the motel, straightening her bed. Sam always makes the bed if he stays over, pressing military tight corners out of her rumpled duvet.
Well, it’d been something to do with his hands when not at work. But again, just out of books and a smattering of videos. When they met Eileen, Dean started trying again. Once Cas had come back and Dean had seen him signing fluently, he’d seized the opportunity. His learning went significantly faster with an actual teacher, and Cas had put away 2 hours every Tuesday and Thursday to work with him on something that Dean should probably be able to figure out alone anyway. Still, it was nice, and Cas didn’t seem to mind. He seemed to find it an interesting exercise, since he knows every language without consciously thinking about that knowledge.
She chuckles and shoos him away. Dean takes the win, all but running back to his motel room. His dingy, dark motel room.
Sam looks at Eileen, the light glinting in her hair as she’s driving comfortably down the road. He’s reminded vividly of a road trip 100 years ago, sitting scrunched in Jess’s tiny VW Bug, driving to Capitola for a weekend at the beach.
Dean puts it away, fiddles out his phone. 6:30 AM. Sam will be up and about soon. Dean hoses Baby down perfunctorily, slides into the driver’s seat, and heads out.
Sam snapped. “Cas didn’t save you so you could throw away your life,” he hurled at Dean. “He’d want you to be happy.” It was a desperate bid to resuscitate the cardboard cutout of a brother that Dean had become. Sam figured he would get angry and snap back, maybe scream, or cry. Something.
Dean was in charge of Cas's cultural education, after all. Led Zeppelin is sometimes the only good thing about being human. Cas deserved some sweet tunes. That's it.
Content Warning: references to Dean's time in Hell, Dean's ongoing rumination on his own monstrosity
She’s not, but Dean’s gonna try and meet her anyway. “Sounds like you think you don’t have a choice. Patience, if you want something else — you know everyone in this bunker will fight for you to have that.”
He doesn't even have to fast-forward through Untouched. He's calm. He's fine. Dean Winchester is fine. He didn't even break anything.
A few minutes later, he sets a steaming mug next to Dean, who is comfortably bustling around the kitchen. The smell of the ready-baked bread wafts up, and Sam parks himself on the counter just to be annoyingly in Dean’s way.
Eileen steps out of her bathroom to see her phone flashing on the counter, but by the time she walks over, it flashes again.
“Why wouldn’t she have fun?” Dean says, “I’m sure she likes spending time with you?” Dean can’t quite stop the last thing from coming out as a question, but in his defense, he’s flying by the seat of his pants, and he hasn’t had any coffee yet.
Dean’s happy he remembered that Alex has that weird cilantro gene that makes you have bad taste, but apparently using parsley instead hadn’t hurt anything. Patience had even uttered a surprised, “Oh, it’s good,” which had sent a pleased thrill down his spine even as he’d gently mocked her for not having seen that coming.
Castiel felt his wings as wide as Heaven itself before being struck dumb by the overwhelming desire for Dean to be here, to witness this, to experience this joy.
Dean remembers realizing that Dad was possessed because Azazel had twisted “I’m proud of you, Dean,” out of a mouth that had never formed the words. He remembers Dad leaving him behind for stealing peanut butter. He remembers being sent away if he was too loud, too ungracious, too insubordinate.
Now it haunts him. What else had Sam missed? How many times had Dean put himself in the line of fire to protect Sam? How many things had Sam blamed Dean for that weren’t his fault at all?
God, Sam is bad at this. For a second, he wishes he was a bit more like Dean, who always seems to find the right words, who can put people at ease, who’s always known who he is.
Dean looks at himself in the camera of the self checkout kiosk, staring down his pixelated form. Cas is probably already used to disappointment, loving Dean.
Content warning: subtle references to homophobia, (monster) decapitation, our boys generally wrestling through anxiety/panic attacks
Cas’s hands grip him and Dean quickly amends his revelation. Oh, there is a lot more he wants to do. To be doing, immediately. Dean threads a hand through Cas’s hair, winding the other around Cas’s back — eager to pull him closer, like if they’re flush in just the right way, Dean can cradle Cas inside his own chest. Cas opens under him and Dean takes. He feels electric, like he’s burning, like if he doesn’t kiss Castiel every day for the rest of his life, he’ll turn to dust.
Dean mimics the sign for bisexual carefully — almost reverently — for how slowly he does it. Signing it back, he asks, “What the hell is bisexual?”
Eileen signs a quick ‘what?’ as she raises an eyebrow. He nonsensically replies with ‘you flirted with the waitress’. He’s been alternating between signing alone and speaking along with his hands for the entire conversation. Eileen enjoys how much more expressive he is with sign, but his confusion is evident in face and hands alike as he fingerspells ‘waitress’. Eileen spares a moment to enjoy the hilarity of Cas teaching Dean the sign for ‘Flirting’ before the sign ‘Server’ before replying.
Sam gives him a weird look, and because his evil little brother is blessed with both good hearing and a desire to fuck with Dean at all times, he says “Was that Nick Lowe? When did you make a Nick Lowe tape?”
It’s not that she doesn’t need backup on this case. Shit’s hinky as hell. She’s just not looking forward to Dean busting in and taking over. Her experience with men like Dean generally says that this is going to be a really annoying few days.
Dean slips beneath a tidal wave of regret. Scrambles to grab Baby before he can be washed away. He can’t breathe. He can’t think.
Patience is looking at Dean when she says, “She’ll be back in 13 minutes, and I’m sorry, but they didn’t have that beer you like at the shop.”
“Could be a purebred,” Dean hedges, but it doesn’t feel quite right. Even if it was a purebred, that’s a lot of feeding. “Maybe a pack?” He’d have to look at the bodies if he really wanted to know.
Cas stops him in the hallway. They stare at each other for a moment before Cas says, “It makes me happy, that you're listening to the tape.” He says it with such a soft smile that Dean's possessed left hand flys out to settle on his bicep.
Dean sits up slowly, stretches out his perpetually achey left shoulder, which Cas swears is fully healed. Dean grabs a morning shower and, weirdly, thinks that today is going to be a good day.
“Okay, l — He’s...he’s not. That’s just a coincidence.” Claire and Kaia are howling with laughter, and Dean shoots Claire as dark a glare as he can muster because this is her fault.
Dean chops and dices and generally does whatever Jody tells him to. He lets the sound of the girls and Donna in the other room waft into the kitchen, carried along by the softly playing radio. He lets it settle somewhere between his shoulder blades.
Jack keeps crying, and Dean sorta starts rocking him. After a few minutes, Jack calms down enough that Dean can say, “Hey, buddy. What's going on?”
Today, he just needs to lay down the final pieces and treat the wood. He’d spent more money on it than he would have if it was just for him, but he didn’t want to do shoddy work that Jody would just have to replace in a few years.
“You don’t actually like me at all,” Zadkiel concludes, and no being that can probably smite half the eastern seaboard should look so upset that Dean Winchester doesn’t like them.
“Dean. I assure you, I have no intention of sacrificing myself ‘willy nilly.’ And as I have no deal with the Empty, I don’t think I’ll be summoning it again any time soon.
“Yes, Sam. I am, in fact, aware that Dean is Dean.” Cas responds, as sincerely as possible, which in this particular case is not very. As if Cas could ever forget who Dean is.
A/N: Since last week's chapter was a little late, we're making today's post an early morning affair! For those of you who've been looking forward to more alternate POV's, we hope you enjoy some Saileen rights, as well as Dean's classic Horny And Mad About It antics :P
“If I have any say in it, you will not die for a very long time.” Cas says, with all the gravity of someone who has already died so you can live more than once. Which is to say, deadly serious and impossible to argue with.
He wants and he wants and he wants. Dean is constantly wanting things he knows he shouldn’t. It used to be easier to put them away. Dean had pushed them so far down that he’d thought he didn’t have any wants at all. He wants a mattress that remembers him. He wants good food. He wants Baby to run forever. He wants Sam to be safe. He wants Jack to be happy. He wants Cas to be — he wants Cas to…
“But I have questions!” Zadkiel responds and it reminds Dean so clearly of an 11 year old Sam lamenting not knowing the answers to a history homework packet that Dean actually laughs out loud.
Okay, Eileen could see how this maybe fell through the cracks. Really, it’s a miracle that Sam turned out so well-socialized.
Dean breezes into the kitchen, squeezes Cas's arm as he passes, and takes the mug of coffee that Jack already has set up for him because Jack is apparently the strongest and best Winchester. Dean ruffles his hair and then, because he hasn't had coffee yet, and he's tired, and honestly he's mentally making pancakes in his mind, he drops a kiss onto Jack’s forehead as he bustles into the kitchen.
Jack tries to apologize about the gun, but Dean is able to shut him down with, “People make mistakes when they’re learning. Just don’t do it again.” Jack had seemed happy enough with that. He’d peppered Dean with questions and laughed at Dean’s dumb electricity puns (Dean is ex-static). Making Jack laugh isn’t difficult, but it is always rewarding.
Glancing at the Impala, she adds, “Maybe someday you’ll sign as well as Dean.” Smacking Sam with a kiss, Eileen uses his flabbergasted stupor to slide out of the garage with all the caramels.
She pulls out some pajamas, brushes her teeth, and walks over to her bed, smiling to herself when she finds the same crisp corners that Sam always tucks carefully into her bed. Dean, for some reason, made the bed before he left.
this time, and it actually makes him almost smile. Cas is a lot of things, but stubborn bastard is definitely high on that list.
Cas thinks back to one of his conversations with Jack, soon after they’d returned to the bunker.  Early on, Cas would catch Jack looking over at Dean, then wincing and averting his gaze. At first, Cas had assumed it was a byproduct of all the hurt that had accumulated between the two of them. After a few days, he’d sought Jack out after the boy had gone to bed. Jack didn’t technically need to sleep, but he seemed to enjoy it, and going too long without still makes him cranky. Nevertheless, this felt important enough to warrant an interruption to Jack’s circadian rhythm.
Dean fiddles with the case, rubbing his finger over the rigid ribbing on the back of the plastic cassette cover, distracting himself with the sound.
She glances back to Dean, intending to get back to the conversation, but Dean is staring at her, flabbergasted.
“Jeez. I got something on my face or something?” Dean says, ducking to look at his reflection in the sparkling steel pot balanced on the drying rack.
He has no idea what it means. He tries to think like Cas. Tries to understand what Cas would be saying with
Jody shows Dean where to dump his stuff and tosses him a beer as he settles into the couch. In the five minutes that they were out of the room, Claire and Alex have started an argument about a sweater, which Patience is trying to arbitrate.
Sam had never known someone he could be wholly himself, and quiet, with other than Dean. With Eileen, he doesn’t have to pretend to be anything. Not even whole.
“I like you as well.” And then, because even Castiel can’t fix angels’ allergies to basic rules of polite behaviour, Zadkiel flies away.
Dean, who has no idea how to take that — no clue why Cas would write something and apologise for it in the same line — feels his hand reach out to press play as he flips to the other paper.
“Thank you, Dean,” she says, serious and heavy. Dean examines the boards at his feet. They sit in silence for a few more moments.
Claire is staring at him with a carefully blank expression, so Dean stops fucking talking and tries to figure out where he went horribly wrong.
He remembers everything, except the very very end. He doesn’t remember Castiel rescuing him. He doesn’t know how he’d ended up with Cas’s hand branded on his skin. He remembers drowning in the suffering of others, and then waking up in his grave.
Why not further? A Dean that Mary had the chance to raise. A Dean who never learned what goes bump in the night. A Dean without gun-shaped divots in his palms, whose soft hands build and create. A Dean born to a Mary unburdened by a deal made in impossible circumstances, whose son could finally be what she wanted instead of what John needed.
It’d been a week and a half of research, chock full of magical talk that Dean didn’t even pretend to understand. Alicia spent a lot of time staring, horrified, at her own hands, then staring, horrified, at her brother. She and Dean had a quiet conversation about love, and sacrifice, and Dean had lied through his teeth to give her hope and faith, and he’d explained the one thing he could absolutely understand, which was that Max loved her.
Eileen will just nab a different hunter for support if she needs it. She’s hardly shy, and she’s definitely not stupid, but Dean can tell from the look on Sam’s face that he’s going to be stressed about it all weekend.
Eileen, uncertain, snaps a quick selfie and sends it to Sam along with, “Why are these glasses weird?” She’s sure they’re weird in some way. She’s just not sure how. While she waits for Sam to respond, she notices a hint of blue at the edge of her vision. As she turns her head to see it head on, she notices a sparkle of light emanating from the warding on her car.
Dean releases a shaking breath, trying to collect himself enough to listen. He misses a few lines but catches
Dean racks his brain and tries to pick Zadkiel out of the hundreds of rotating angels that Cas talks about. “Zadkiel…” he says to buy time, but then he remembers. “Isn’t that the angel who asked if Heaven could have purple magpies?”
“She’s always acting like she has to look out for me, for everyone. And I get that. I do. It’s just...I want her to take the night off and enjoy a band she likes. In public, at a bar. I want us to get drunk and do something stupid and spend the night in Minneapolis because we want to, and not because there might be a shifter in Rochester.”
Dean is struggling to think in complete sentences, but he finally manages to push Cas’s trench coat off his broad shoulders and onto the floor. Cas pulls back to rip off his own tie. Dean’s mouth goes dry.
“Cabbage is just pretentious lettuce,” Dean fires in return, popping the cap off his and taking a sip that’s long enough to say ‘God I love beer’ but hopefully not long enough to say ‘what the fuck is wrong with me’.
He casts around for something, anything, to distract him — he feels his hand reach for his gun, but everything is wrong, and it doesn't sit right in his hands, and it's not comforting, and Dean thinks, wishes, prays that he could feel anything else right now. He's alone and his gun isn't right and it's not safe.
. Dean Winchester, starter of the apocalypse, has a standing Tuesday game night which is…honestly, nice. It’s fun. They have to remember to confiscate Claire's weapons at the door after the Great Pictionary Stand Off, but other than that, it's…fun. Safe. Jack clearly loves it.
Cas says, “Goodnight, Dean.” Dean can't think of anything to say that isn't, “Hey, you should come to my room and just lay near me. This isn't even a sex thing. I'm just asking for you to be near me while I’m unconscious because apparently I'm a fucking crazy person,” so he doesn't say anything at all.
Dean really, truly, honestly cannot figure out how his life ended up like this. Castiel looks peeved. “Are you —” There is no way. Come on. “Are you jealous?”
Dean looks at the walkman, stands up from the bed, and paces a short circuit before sitting back down abruptly.
Maybe Sam’s overthinking it. Something clearly happened between Patience and Dean last night, so it makes sense that Dean is a little on edge. Dean worries.
The conversation around breakfast is the sort of inconsequential nothing that Sam loves. Jack, Eileen, and Cas are having a conversation in sign language entirely too quickly for Sam to understand, and Dean and Patience are having a many-layered argument about
Dean’s not blind. He knows that he’s done some good in the world. Hell, he and Sammy have even saved it a few times. But he’s never done anything that anyone wouldn’t do in his shoes, and boy, he did not pick those shoes. When you talk comparative values, Dean’s not much better than a lot of the demons they kill. There isn’t even a point of comparing him to Sam and Cas. There isn’t a scale that would make that graph fit on a page.
Cas, of course, doesn’t back down from Dean. Nor does he offer a solution to how the fuck Dean was supposed to respond to one of his worst nightmares brought to life, which is probably a good thing. Dean has punched angels in the face before, and it usually hurts him more than it hurts them.
“4. Rhumba for Peregrine by Mike Dillon.” Dean blinks. The song picks up a bit and Dean finds himself absently tapping a foot along. Okay, better than elevator music.
The chorus about leaving everything behind hollows Dean’s chest. He doesn’t want Cas to see him, but god, he doesn’t want Cas to leave either.
Ten minutes later, Eileen texts him a smiley face and information about the motel she’s staying in. She suggests meeting at a diner when he gets in. Dean extremely doubts that she had nearly as much trouble as him in performing a basic human task like
But the thing — the confusing thing — is that Cas had done that, too. For every time Cas had betrayed or abandoned them, there were a million times he gave up everything for them. Cas turned on the Host, gave up his army, died and died and died — all for Dean.
Everyone must be busy. Eileen doesn’t really think she’s in Dean Winchester’s top five best buddies for casual hangouts. Or his top 10.
Sam responds with a hesitant, “Alright?” fixing Cas with another look. “Well, okay. I guess it can wait.” Then, since being confusing is a Winchester family trait, Sam sits down at the table and starts flipping through a book.
Claire and Kaia turn bewildered looks at Cassie, and Claire opens her mouth to ask a question. Dean, who has been to Hell and also ridden shotgun to a homicidal archangel, can truly not think of anything worse than Claire asking a question right now, so he grabs the conversation with both hands and very carefully doesn’t pray.
Except this is Dean. Sam knows him. Dean is chopping red onions perfunctorily, with a perfectly content air. He grumbles at Sam to make coffee, and Sam complies, but he watches Dean when he can get away with it.
“I —” Dean starts because he should say something, but Cas cuts him off by lifting his eyes from Dean’s scarred knuckles to look at his face. Dean watches his eyelashes as they part to reveal brilliant blue, finds himself trapped in Cas’s unrelenting gaze. Dean’s hand flutters uselessly in Cas’s grip, like he wants to rip his hand away but can’t.
Alistair's voice curls in the back of his mind, but Dean blacks it out as firmly as he can. He hears his mom saying
Sam seems startled by the question, as though the many times he ran through this conversation didn’t prepare him for this as a possibility. Sam looks up, and his eyes are as big as saucers when he says, “I...I don’t know.”
The author labors over his subject, crafting gentle prose that belies a soft care despite the harshness of the material. It’s nice. Affectionate. Loving, even.
“Sam,” Cas interrupts. Cas doesn’t have a version of the earnest implorement face, but he hopes he communicates his absolute seriousness regardless. “I love your brother. You do not need to convince me of his worth.” Cas wonders if he should have included the preposition in that declaration — make clear not the strength of his emotion but the quality. No matter. He's certain it's obvious to Sam. Sam must have learned about Cas’s deal in the 6 months when they thought him gone forever.
Dean squeegees soap from Baby’s windshield. Cas’s existence on Earth had meant being used and discarded by Dean. Dying for him with a smile, then coming back to die again.
He looks back at the flowers, plucks one off the bedside table, and carries it to his desk. He even manages to not think about the fact that he had kissed Cas in this exact spot 5 days ago. He definitely doesn’t think about the dream he had after, because a toddler with a developmental delay would be able to tell him what his brain had been trying to warn him about. It’s just hard to remember how bad an idea this all is when Cas is actually in front of him, putting away groceries, or advising Jack, or dunking on Michael for flying like he just got his wings. It’s impossible to remember with the memory of that kiss still on his lips.
Dean swallows his beer and grabs another, desperately letting the song pass because he needs to not have any thoughts about Castiel throwing him around by the time the two idiots return from Heaven.
Nope. This is fine. Dean's fine. He doesn't need to make a list of nice human experiences that Cas is missing. Cas is fine. Cas is here.
Dean shrugs, “He might pop in later. And if not, he can come get you for Tuesday night’s game night.”
“So. Nachos!” Dean’s pretty sure he’s seen trainwrecks that were less idiotic. “I’m gonna go make the nachos,” Dean clarifies, since the statement wasn’t bad enough on its own.
He has been carrying the torch. He is resilient. He had some slips here and there, but it’s not like he didn’t get back up.
when he turns her off. Eileen shoots quizzical eyebrows across Baby’s front bench. He frantically signs out that he has to use the bathroom, giving her a ‘what can ya do’ shrug.
Great, now he’s projecting onto chili. If he’s going to go insane, Dean thinks, it should at least be for a good reason.
It’s not, really, is the thing. It’s not really a big deal. Dean isn’t quite that dumb. He knew he liked dudes. It’s just that he also liked girls, and one of those things was much easier to deal with. Plus, he wasn’t gay, because he really did like girls. He did.
Dean goes to click on another tab. Cas's hand settles on Dean's — curling, protective. Cas is a hot presence lighting up Dean's entire back and right arm. Dean could lean back half a centimeter and they would be flush.
“A little bit, dude,” Dean says, because if he doesn’t tell him, Eileen absolutely will. It’s hardly a bad thing. It’s not like Eileen hasn’t already died once. “Here’s the thing. I could use the chance to stretch my legs, so I’m gonna text Eileen and see if she doesn’t mind me crashing, whether you like it or not. So, it’s sorta out of your hands now.”
Dean returns to Baby. He thinks about driving to the bunker, but chokes on the idea of walking in to see Cas gone, or worse, Cas packing. Jack would go with him, which would destroy Sam.
Eileen has no idea how to prod what he wants to say out of him, so she waits. Dean frowns through her extremely basic explanation of bisexuality, so much so that Eileen wonders if she really did read him wrong, if Dean and Cas are just really good friends. She braces for some good old-fashioned bi-phobia, but instead, Dean asks, “What about Jack?”
Castiel says, “I will like it,” with the same firm assurance that had carried, “You should show me some respect.” Which is to say, in a tone that leaves no room for argument.
Dean can’t really see Sam trusting a stranger with having Eileen's back, especially someone outside of the network they’re slowly building. Now that Dean thinks about it, he doesn’t really either. Eileen doesn’t deserve any old hunter as backup.
It’s not that he wants Claire and Kaia to like Cassie. It's just that he feels like Cassie deserves Claire and Kaia to like her. Cassie’s great.
Sam stands up, and he walks to the door. He seems to remember himself and stops, turning back to Dean.
“It’s a — do you actually want me to explain the magic, Dean? It’s a ceremony, a bunch of witches will be there.”
The problem then becomes not “is Isabelle the monster?” but “what kind of monster is Isabelle?” With some subtle stalking, Eileen drops holy water in Isabelle’s morning Starbucks, Dean drops a silver coin into her palm via truly horrible flirting, and they both disgustingly oversalt her salad (Eileen feels bad about that one. The poor waitress did not deserve to be yelled at — if Eileen wasn’t already planning on killing Isabelle, that interaction would have been enough to convince her it was necessary).
And Sammy — blessed, glorious Sammy, with his ability to speak words that have emotions in them when not nearly dying — just said, “We missed you too, Jack.” Sam hugged him, which is doubly good, because it meant Dean didn't have to.
They spend half a day retreading the information they’ve gathered, but with fresher eyes. When the first pass leaves them as frustratedly blank as the last several days, they review it a third time. They’re leaning towards a Djinn draining the blood, accounting for the length of time between the grabs and the drops. Dean mutters angrily about Djinn as a whole, but also searches ruins and abandoned homes as potential nests. There are a couple of creatures that could be responsible for the organs, but Eileen and Dean are operating on the “find one monster and it should lead us to the other” school of thought.
Dean sucks in a breath. He rewinds the tape aimlessly, deciding that sitting in silence isn’t the best move, and hits play. His fingers move sluggishly through thick air. He’s not paying attention to how far he rewinds, so he startles slightly when he hits play and it pipes out — tiny, soft, and powerful — “God Mason, heart heavier than all the bricks.”
Eileen doesn’t think about how sad it must have been to live for years and not have a name for what you are, to have John for a father and not a community who makes you feel safe. She doesn’t think about how she might be the first person Dean has come out to, doesn’t think about the courage of that. She definitely doesn’t let any of that show on her face.
Thankfully, Sam hasn’t noticed. He lets out a snort and heaves his shoulders in a way that reveals that, while Sam is acting as though this is funny, he deeply doesn’t think it is. “Convince Dean of his worth? Sure, no problem. I’ll put that on my to-do list right after moving a mountain.”
Music isn't supposed to be like this, he thinks, but even he knows that's wrong. Music is exactly this. Castiel took his stupid, guilty pleasure and made it beautiful and meaningful, and Dean is going to die alone in this bunker, because how do you even respond to that?
But, it was nice, is the thing. Cas’s love for him is without expectation. Cas doesn’t seem to want anything from Dean except the opportunity to love him. Dean knows, eventually, Cas will wise up, move on, leave. Dean also knows that he’ll never recover from that. That’s fine though. He’s never recovered from any of the other times Cas has left them either.
He puts his head down, pushing his palms into his eyes like the heels of his hands could banish that selfish thought. He’s acting like a child. He just —
Dean starts to say, “There are meetings?” before he catches himself, shakes his head, and laughs. Eileen grins.
Dean wakes up the next morning at 8 AM, which is the latest he's slept since Jack and Cas returned, and calls it a win. He can't remember his dream last night, but he does remember rolling over in the middle of the night and idiotically thinking for a split second that his bed was larger than normal.
The imprint of a crying girl in his arms is hard to ignore. She carries her sadness so softly, wrapping it around her throat so it doesn’t spill into her new family.
Dean is very aware of the gun at his belt, his clenched hands, and the fact that Chuck is still alive. Powerless, but alive.
He tore through the bunker, and when that yielded no result, he called Dean while tearing through again. When Dean didn’t pick up, Cas unashamedly panicked. Dean had sounded like he was dying, and Cas couldn’t find him.
Goddammit, Dean. Sam accepts him. Dean would know by now if he didn’t. Dean’s never been subtle about his weaknesses. Sam has killed and died and bled for them.
Later, he’s sitting in the library texting with Max about a lunar ceremony that Max thinks Sam should attend. Sam’s interested. He’s just —
In retrospect, Dean thinks that was one of the moments that slid a ladder into the dark empty hole that hid his heart at the bottom.
that he’s breathing. He has to be breathing. His chest feels compact, like Billie’s cold fingers still curl around his heart.
Cas smiles, gorgeous and perfect, and Dean brought him there. Cas slides his hand down Dean’s face, tracing burning trails down his neck before stopping above his bare chest.
He’s at a diner getting lunch, idly flirting with a waiter and letting their mutual appreciation distract him from staring down at the walkman he’d loaded up with the tape by muscle memory, when he lets himself pull the thoughts apart.
Eileen makes the bed, frowning at how she can’t quite seem to get the lines crisp. She doesn’t usually make her bed, since it always seemed kinda useless. Like, it’s a crappy motel somewhere, and she’s just gonna be crawling back into the thing later on.
Dean is mind-numbingly bored. He has absolutely nothing to do. There isn’t a hunt for him to handle. Everything has someone on it already. The bunker’s clean. The warding is good. Dean’s double checked all the weapons. Hell, Dean is even thinking about going on a run, just to have something to
Dean shoots off a nothing text — full of emojis and nothing else because he knows that Jody hates it — and, sure enough, she replies quickly, “Sleep with one eye open, Winchester.” Dean chuckles.
Dean remembers it differently. He remembers Cas slinging fire to buy Dean five minutes. He remembers Bobby taking a shot he knew wouldn’t make a difference in a last ditch attempt to protect him. He remembers Sam overcoming insane odds to save the world. He remembers that everyone died.
that was you!” It’s said with a laugh and a smile, and Dean looks over even though he doesn’t need a visual to know who it is.
Her tiny village feared her. She was not like them. Cas had been certain they would turn against her, that their mortal minds couldn’t comprehend the gift of divinity that she carried. Yet, she received love in equal measure to their fear.
The garage is mostly soundproof and far enough from the bedroom that he doesn’t have to worry. He lets Gang of Youths rumble in his ears, and welcomes Baby as a comfortable weight under his hands.
Fuck, what does Sam think? Does Sam know? Did Cas and Sam talk about it? Is Dean going to have to tell Sam? Is Sam going to be angry?
And Dean, because he's a useless blunt instrument, because he wants to be gentle but has no way to do that, started forward in the way he had last time, and he wasn't even sure if it was to punch Cas or hug Cas or kiss him senseless (no wait the kid is watching, oh god the KID), but then Cas had turned those blue, blue eyes on him — and Dean had stalled out. He stopped completely short because, God, his eyes are
Dean doesn't calm down. Dean barks out gruff orders about never pointing a gun somewhere you don't intend to shoot it, like the fucking hypocrite he is, and once Jack's expression has collapsed so far south it's probably at the equator, Dean storms out.
At the very least, Cas feels comforted that language has failed Sam as well. Sam returns his gaze to the table, his secret keeper, absently tracing the scratch marks of their names. He seems to pull language onto his tongue by sheer force of feeling, a skill which Cas at once envies and finds terrifying.
Dean treats himself as if he’s a monster, like if he loosens the cage of his body some horrible darkness will be released.
Sam and Jack go to bed first, because that's tradition, but Dean is exhausted, so he finds himself trailing up to his room soon after.
Dean remembers asking Sam to keep the faith for him, about Cas being the only one who’s ever answered his prayers. Thinks about Cas coming to him, comforting him while he sobbed like a child. Thinks about the things he’s told Cas that he’s never told anyone.
He listens and listens, and tries to imagine a version of himself that could possibly make this true. Dean tries, desperately, to see himself through Cas's eyes. Wants to grab this imaginary version of Dean that Cas envisions. Maybe if he can just see it, he can fake it. Maybe if he tries really, really hard, Cas won't remember that from the moment Cas found him, Dean has been neck deep in the misery he's created for other people.
Dean notices something glinting on the ground and wanders over to see his walkman carelessly discarded. He picks it up with reverent fingers.
Jesus, what is happening to him? He’s always aware of when Cas is in the room, but this is — this is ridiculous.
As predicted, Dean scoffs, gathering his things. “Whatever. Text your broom-mate before he thinks you’re giving him the cold shoulder, and try not to be such a baby. I’ll be in the garage.”
and realizes he hasn’t been listening to the music at all. The strings carry the song into silence, and Dean pauses the tape. He carefully rewinds the music, but his hand hovers over the play button. He repeats
Inside is a pair of…not very fashionable glasses. They aren’t even sunglasses. Just glasses. Is Dean trying to say she needs glasses?
Maybe — maybe he never even loved Dean in the first place. I mean, most of their relationship took place in Chuck’s world. Maybe Chuck had messed with Cas’s programming, orchestrating a romance. Maybe Cas dying for Dean was another of Chuck’s horrible machinations, a vengeful God adding something good to the board so he’d have more to rip away.
And there, Jack stared at him with such an imploring gaze that Dean was positive Sam must have taken Jack aside and taught him how to do puppy dog eyes at some point. He now possessed one powerful pout. He was clearly waiting for Dean to say something, so Dean did. Because lord knows he let the kid down enough, and if Jack wasn't smart enough to realize that he should be punching Dean in the face, Dean was just going to have to do better. Someone should protect Jack from Dean, and since no one else would, Dean would do it himself.
“What the fuck does that even mean, Cas? You —” Dean, fucking say it, come on. “You care about me because you’re you? That’s your thesis statement on this relationship?”
Hell, the first time he woke up next to her screaming, she’d made jokes about how she didn’t hear a thing, even as she’d gently untangled herself from his trembling to get him water. It’s like she somehow just knows what to do.
“Aw, Cas, you’ll always be my favorite angel in a trench coat.” Dean says, because he can also be a little shit sometimes. He wanders down from the porch to stand next to Castiel.
The door slams. The engine roars. Dean is driving before another conscious thought descends. He hurtles down the road to
Cas would put it on sometimes, when they were driving alone. It had been nice to watch him bob his head to familiar music. But it didn't mean anything. It was just, y’know, a friend educating another friend.
And Dean, who has faced gods and monsters the likes of which you can't imagine, runs away to his room.
She couldn’t see them. She couldn’t see the hellhounds. Dean’s not sure why he’s surprised, because he knows she didn’t make a deal. He just — well, he forgot.
When he tuned in, it was with no coffee and no defense that, at 7 AM that sunny (who knows? There are no windows in the bunker) morning, Dean found himself listening to Jack turn to Sam and ask him to “explain the emotional significance of a mixtape.”
‘Eileen can’t hear it,’ he reminds himself viciously. She doesn’t know what's playing, only that something is playing. Dean forces himself into a casual posture, thumbing the beat on the wheel. He doesn’t sing along, avoiding any chance of Eileen identifying what's playing. She can’t read his lips if he’s not saying anything.
Dean and Cas are dating, and Cas gives Dean his love, his attention, his care. Brings him gifts from all over the world, crafts him mixtapes, and smiles at him openly and without complication. Cas has given Dean his loyalty and his faith.
He feels the beginning of a thought forming and sets himself to examining it. The mixtapes seem to make Dean very happy. They are an action that Dean can see and hear and touch. If Cas wants Dean to view himself in the same light that Cas sees him, perhaps a mixtape would do the trick.
“What did you think I was going to say?” Dean’s voice is a blade. He doesn’t even know why it comes out angry. There is silence for a split second, so Dean’s mind provides him
A bit of silence settles over the phone, but it’s comfortable. Cas doesn’t expect him to respond to a statement as big as that, and Dean’s not going to try.
This has become their new, secret, private greeting. Everytime it happens, Dean swears he can hear the entire mixtape condensed into the brief tap of Cas’s fingers against his cheek.
Tapping his foot to Blackpink, Dean thinks that maybe he doesn’t have to get it to find it beautiful.
How do you make friends when you’re 40/80 and also a moron? Dean hits send. Apparently, by acting like a 12 year old girl trying to get invited to a sleepover.
“It's okay, kiddo.” God, his voice sounded like sandpaper. “You deserve to be happy.” Jack's face lit up like Dean was a God handing out revelation instead of a broken man stating a basic human fact. He could feel Cas's smile widen behind him, and wasn't that a wild experience?
A week later, Dean sank into a self Sam had never known existed. He started drinking and didn’t stop. He barely ate. He wouldn’t leave his room. He ignored texts and calls from anyone but Sam.
Kaia, because Dean suspects sometimes that she’s the only one of any of them with a modicum of self-preservation instinct, joins him.
Dean’s never really fought with a partner before. Cassie enjoyed banter, and they were certainly combative at times, but never on opposite sides of a fight. Not till the end. He’d held his anger on a leash around Lisa and Ben, bludgeoning his grief into the person they needed, the person Sam told him to be. There’d been nothing to fight about, not till the end: Sam back, but wrong, Dean caught between staying and leaving, a danger in either direction.
“My Dad. He…it’s like —” Patience huffs out a frustrated puff of air. “I want him to be a part of my life, okay. He’s my Dad, and I love him. But he —” Patience looks back down at her cup, but Dean sees the way her eyes are glistening as her thumbs start to fidget.
“You really trying to tell me that this has nothing to do with me? That’s your fucking response? Cas, no jury in the world is stupid enough to buy that.”
enough hobby. Eileen knows Dean tested out of high school early and was socialized almost exclusively by hunters, old friends of John, and the television.
“Dean.” Sleep-addled, his voice sounds so much like his father’s. Dean turns around and looks at the kid. He's clearly still half asleep, but his grip is insistent.
Dean hauls a blanket over Jack and goes to walk out of the room when one of Jack's hands snakes out and grabs him by the wrist.
Cas gestures towards the door, and for a second, Dean thinks Cas is apologising for leaving the door open. That absolutely merits an apology, but somehow he doubts that Cas-“what is privacy”-tiel would care. Then, he sees them, shattered into three pieces in the hallway: his headphones. He stares at the pieces so hard he can’t even see them anymore.
“Dean’s love is….” Again, he bucks against the constraints of language. He thinks of a blanket wrapped around his shoulders when he was suffering. A hand on his shoulder, a voice calling his name, soft lips pressing against his. He tries to find the quality that unites them.
The worst part about this, Dean observes distantly, is that Dean actually likes Kimchi. It’s yummy. It’s good on burgers. And now he can never eat Kimchi in front of Sam ever again because Sam will be insufferably smug about it.
I Will Follow You Into The Dark reminds Dean he can’t push Cas out and away, since they’re apparently dating, and even death isn’t an out.
Dean had found himself staring over it constantly, like if he looked hard enough, a trench coat might wash to shore. He’d stare, and then staring would become painful, so he’d look away. Five minutes later, he’d be staring again. If he didn’t pay careful attention, if he looked away for too long, he’d catch the dark waters of the lake out of the corner of his eye and see Cas fading away. It was better he look and see blue instead of black.
The song ends, and the next plays for 5 or 10 seconds before Dean is able to rouse himself enough to pause it. Dean looks down at the paper. Reads “3. I am a credible source.”
He makes the 30 minute drive in 15 minutes, which probably isn’t good. Opening the tape deck, he slides the mixtape in, blindly rewinding it from where he let it play out while he was being pathetic.
Eileen pauses. She was ready for some flack. Maybe an assertion that she can’t be bi and in love with Sam. Even some horrible threesome joke.
He remembers Dean saying goodbye on a car-ride like this. He remembers Dean talking obliquely about how John would send him away when he stepped out of line, but Sam had been too mad and too scared about what Dean was planning to even think about that.
Jack isn't crying anymore, but his eyes are a bit bright when he says, “Why are you telling me this?”
Sam, who had been trying to offer comfort, who had just wanted Dean to admit and talk about his grief, broke down crying in Dean’s arms instead.
Eileen starts trying to explain how different people relate to bisexuality, the broad and varied definitions, and Dean’s hands stall slightly when he asks, “Are there many?” Eileen first thinks he’s asking if there are many definitions of bisexual, but she quickly realises he means, “Are there many bisexuals?”
After Eileen’s third cup of coffee goes cold on the counter, she thinks to wonder how the monsters are funding their operation. They’d have to coordinate, and they’ve lived here for at least 20 years. It isn’t expensive per se, but it certainly isn’t cheap. Even if they’re squatting, they’d have to avoid detection for a long time. Plus, they’d need eyes in at least a few of the homeless shelters, or some other way to identify victims who are unlikely to be missed.
