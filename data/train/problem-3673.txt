Once it was straight, Bobby went into the basement, coming back with a couple of yellowed and creased boxes of Christmas lights.
Jesus stayed awake, watching the fire.  When the fire burned low, he rose to gather more wood. He wandered around to the surrounding trees and bushes, breaking off various branches. He was about to crack one of the bigger sticks over his knee when he heard the sound of wings, followed by familiar steps making their way through the corpse of trees. “Hello, Castiel,” he said. He turned to face the angel while he cracked another stick, the sound echoing through the night air.
Sam slumped against it, his eyes vacant and fixed on the bathroom door opposite him. “He just passed out and then there was all this blood—”
“Who?” Sister Joan asked.
:: Emperor Constantine, also known as Constantine The Great, was a Roman Emperor who reigned from 306–337 CE. He decriminalized Christianity within the Roman Empire via The Edict of Milan, convened The First Council of Nicea where Christian doctrine was agreed upon and transitioned Christianity into the official state religion of the Roman Empire. According to tradition, during the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, he received a vision of the Chi Rho with the phrase "In this sign you will conquer.” He had the symbol painted on his battle standards and after he won the battle, converted to Christianity.
“That so?” Anger filled Dean’s voice. “Well, I see that paid off

. There’s a ten-minute skip on the tape.”
“Which is?”
“Thanks for everything,” Jimmy said, climbing out of the backseat of the Impala. He closed the door, walking to the driver’s side. “I really appreciate  it.”
Dean remembered Cas telling him about the Watchers falling in love with humans and how the beings that came from that love- the nephilim- had brought about the Great Flood. Such a love was an abomination.
“No.” Dean shook his head. “
A few hours later, Dean felt the nudge of a hand on his shoulder. He opened his eyes to find a police officer standing behind him. “Sir.” The officer nudged him again. “You can’t sleep in here.”
“How do I
“Will you just—“
The woman blinked at him. Hope and excitement then spread across her face as she watched him pick the Bible up. “That’s a great one to use, it’s not as intimidating. It’s forty dollars if you’d like to buy it.”
Castiel nodded. “You two are a lot alike.  Like you, Jesus was the dutiful eldest son, a protective older brother. He was also very stubborn.” He took a deep breath. “But he cared about others deeply and had a strong thirst for justice.” He looked at Dean sincerely. “You might not give the Sermon on the Mount, but you’d certainly drive the money-changers from The Temple.”
.” Sam was quiet for a second. He chuckled bitterly. “Things you always scoffed at and called bullshit. Things you always scoffed at
Sister Joan chuckled, grabbing him. “It’s not a problem. Trust me.”
Sam smiled at her sadly. “Well thank you for your time, ma’am. That’s all I needed to know.” With that, he turned and left the bar, heading back to the Impala. He climbed in, shutting the door with a squeak as he leaned his head against the back of the seat.
“Is that all you’ve got? Lilith laughed pained and breathless. “Freak.”
Mary and the infant disappeared in a burst of flame.
He wanted nothing more than to wander around the salvage yard, but his ankles were already throbbing.
Briefly, Judas shot Simon a look. “Her name is Asariel. I summoned her a fortnight ago. She told me that I’m a —” He paused, trying to force the word from his mouth. “‘Righteous one.’” Slowly, he turned his gaze back to Jesus. “I’m supposed to find the Messiah and help him stop the apocalypse. She didn’t tell me how I would do it, just that I was the only one who
Jesus pieced together a crude shelter from tree limbs and brush, where they waited out the storm. By the time the rain relented, the sun was low in the sky and they decided to make camp for the night.
Sometimes the heat was like fire, slow and burning. Sometimes like lightning, fast and buzzing.
Three more demons lay in the far corner of the stable, another two out in the field, their eyes vacant pits of charred flesh.
that!”
things right, yeah. She was my wife,” Dean paused. “And her name was Miriamne, by the way. She had eyes the color of honey and black hair… She always smelled like jasmine.” Dean grew quiet. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. He took a deep breath. "You know, before I died, I asked Sam- James- to watch over them. I trusted him enough to take care of my wife and kid," Dean smiled sadly. "Now I can barely trust Sam to take care of my car." Dean pursed his lips. "Actually, I know for a fact that I
Dean took one, taking a bite from it. “Nevermind.”
But weddings were also a time of questions. Questions about children, marriage arrangements, and proposals, questions that were, one way or another,
Not long after night fell, Dean’s eyes began to droop. He lay down inside the circle, wrapping the wool blanket around him, his legs curled up tight against his chest.

“-There was
Claire nodded. She let out a tiny sob. Dean reached over and hugged her, pulling her against his chest. “It’s okay. You’re gonna be okay.”
“James. My brother. Yeah, Cas. I remember.” Dean shook his head, grabbing his flannel from the floor, throwing it back on. He shuffled himself over to the couch, sinking into it. “Fuck.” He pressed his hands into his eyes before running them through his hair. “This is only gonna get harder, isn’t it?”
After what Michael had told him, Jesus knew Heaven had different plans for him. Then after Joseph died, he had to provide for the family he already had. He couldn’t afford to have a family of his own on top of taking care of nine other people.
“Bobby.” Dean’s voice shook. “It— it fucking hurts Bobby,” he sobbed, slowly pulling his shaking hands away from the side of his head as he sat himself up, glancing woozily around the bathroom.
Three times he tried to step into the river, but every time he reached the water’s edge, he stopped.
Dean grabbed John by the jacket. “
Pamela paused, then scoffed.
Faith.” Her voice became serious and almost pitying. “All you have is doubt, Dean. You need to accept your mission and trust in the Will of your Father.”
Jesus was gathering more firewood when he noticed a small group of men and women heading East through the hills. They were filled with fiery zeal and purpose, singing psalms as they traveled, almost as though they were headed to a new Promised Land. When they approached, Jesus invited them to share the campfire. Though they accepted, they stayed just long enough to warm themselves before leaving, thanking him for the hospitality.
“Relax, Scrooge.” Bobby smirked.“Besides, it’s your birthday. You should enjoy it.”
Dean looked up, setting his eyes on a young nun dressed in a dark brown habit, standing next to his pew. “Yeah, I’m fine.” He nodded, giving her a half-feigned smile. “I’ll be even better tomorrow afternoon.” Dean paused, his voice shaking. “Hopefully.”
Sam pulled his tented boxers down to his knees, exposing his hard cock. “I missed you,” he groaned, stroking himself.
Amelia walked Claire made their way into the kitchen, staring at Dean as she walked away.

Dean was dreaming. He was remembering.  This time, it was the sound of shattering pottery, cracking wood and spilling coins, shouting and chaos. A whip hewn from ropes he held so tightly it nearly burned the flesh of his hand.
“Of course.”

“I flew to farm about a day’s journey from here. The woman wasn’t too pleased that I took her food, even after told her it was a holy sacrifice.” The angel recounted.  “She called me a—” He paused searching for the word. “ ‘Brigand.’”
Sam jumped up so fast that the couch slid back. He marched out of the house, slamming the door behind him.
“Yeah.
“Because they wouldn’t understand,” Dean replied. “Just go and live your life, alright?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, well, if I’m not mistaken, that Son said, ‘Judge not and you will not be judged’. Why don’t you do yourself a favor and
With that, Castiel's vessel was gone. Hidden from him.
But already, the musty stench of age and decay in the church had been covered up with the scent of roses. For the first time in months, Dean welcomed the scent. Closing his eyes, he breathed it in deep, allowing it to fill his lungs.
James chuckled, “Why
“Possibly,” Bobby sighed. “Why?”
“I don’t know.” Jesus shrugged. “In any case, I have a new abba now so it doesn’t matter,” he mumbled.
Jesus walked up to the podium and placed his hands on the handles of the scroll. The fire grew stronger, crackling and burning under his skin.
Sam swallowed the lump that formed in the pit of his throat. “Tomorrow is Good Friday.”
“Fine.” The officer sighed. “But I don’t wanna get anymore complains about him squatting in here. You understand that?”
Instantly Sam scoffed. “Dean’s a
“Fancy seeing you and your bitch here, Sammy-Boy,” one of the demons sneered.
He remembered that Palm Sunday — the feast commemorated during the mass—never happened. There was no donkey. No palm branches. No crowds. He—Jesus had walked into Jerusalem as nothing more than a pilgrim, as he had done for countless Passovers before.
go through this.”
The sound of snapping fingers filled Mary’s ears just as her eyes opened, finding herself back in bed, early morning light filling the room. She lay there for a moment, her eyes moving around the room, before she sat up.
Dean took a deep breath.”I don’t want to have a problem with you.” He said, not in English, but Aramaic.
:: Obstetric ultrasonography began to be used in American prenatal care during the mid 1970's and was standard practice by the early 1980's. Mary's pregnancy with Dean occurred right on the cusp of this so there's a slight bit of artistic license and assumption on my part.
Sam was quiet for a moment before he chuckled bitterly. “You know… my

“You’re so
Jesus stood up and walked over to his mother. “Ima, what’s wrong?”
Eventually, Sam’s search worked its way back into the bathroom. The only things out of place were Dean’s bloodstained shirts, left behind after Sam had patched him up. Sam found them in a crumpled mess on the floor in the space between the toilet and the bathroom counter.
“You are meant to fight Lucifer and his army, Dean,” Castiel said bluntly. “You must do as you are fated to do.”
Jesus shrugged, breaking another stick. “I couldn’t sleep. And besides, someone needs to stoke the fire.”
have that Jesus had convinced himself that he had to die, that it was his destiny even, there was a mantra that played constantly in the back of his mind.  It had lingered quietly during the Last Supper and in Gethsemane. Among the torments of the Roman soldiers, it had screamed.
“I’m sorry.” Jesus lowered his eyes. “I shouldn’t have asked. That’s none my business.”
“I got lucky, I guess.” Sam shrugged. Standing up from his bed, he began walking towards the bathroom, folding the bath towel repeatedly between his fingertips. He only got a few steps away from his bed before Dean spoke again.

Almost as quickly as the vision appeared, it was gone again.
He quickly rose up from his chair, chugging the rest of his beer. Before he made his way over to the door, he threw his jacket on as he grabbed the Impala keys from a pocket in Sam’s jacket, shoving them into his own. He glanced into Bobby’s living room where Bobby and Sam were out cold before he left the house, closing the door behind him.

“He won’t have the stomach to do what you will ask of him.” The demon smirked. “And because of that, you will lose.”
“Never mind that. I’m about as appalled by this as you are,” Balthazar whispered, pulling Castiel into the street. He gestured to an officer sitting atop a horse. “So is Anna.”

them for the task ahead of you. ”
“You return to Nazareth and preach to the people there. After that, you’ll go out into the neighboring towns and villages and preach to them. When the time is right, you’ll reveal yourself.”
“You know…the wounds Jesus received when the Romans crucified him?” Bobby walked into his study, returning with a dust-covered Bible in hand. He pulled a yellowed prayer card from it, placing it in front of Dean. It bore an image of the crucifixion. “Crown of thorns, scourging, nails.” Bobby glanced at Sam before setting his eyes on Dean. “A spear.”
“Now Heaven’s gotta waste their time cleansing you so you can actually be of some use to them,” John scoffed, shaking his head. “Despite what you did, they still bothered to save you. They gave you a second chance and you’ve got the nerve to be a little shit to them? To
Jesus sighed. “We ran out of wine, and the wedding isn't even over yet.”
Castiel watched Uriel for a second. “If Dean dies with his soul in the state that it’s in right now, Lucifer rises without anyone to oppose him. We lose this battle before it’s even begun. Tell me Uriel, how does that benefit Heaven?”
Castiel clenched his fists. His voice turned desperate and he took a step forward. “Dean you must understand, this is long foretold—”

Castiel walked to the end of Dean’s bed, his gaze focusing on the man’s broken feet. Even though they were covered by a blanket, Castiel could see the faint glow of the wounds that marked them. Carefully, he placed his hands over each of the ankles. A light emanated from his hands, soaking through the fabric of the bedspread and into the skin and bone resting just underneath. He then moved over to the side of Dean’s bed and did the same to each of Dean’s wrists.

“What’s wrong? What happened?”
Hearing the man’s voice, Dean’s heart plummeted.
Jimmy stared at them for a moment until he spoke again, lifting his gaze towards Dean. “Castiel told me about you. Who you are. That’s why I said ‘yes.’”
“It is. It belonged to my great-great-grandparents. It was one of the few things they managed to bring up to Boston with them when they left South Carolina.”
Sam finished up the rest of his breakfast as he went about the task of cleaning up the motel room and packing their belongings and hunting equipment, bringing them out to the Impala while Dean stayed seated at the table, slowly drinking his coffee. It took Sam a single trip before he was able to walk Dean out to the Impala and check out of the motel, leaving Dean’s untouched food behind in the trash bin.
“I’ll take a walk, then.” Dean breathed heavily as he stepped into the hallway.
“Samael is an angel,” Jesus stated. “He tested Job on Hashem’s behalf. He is an adversary only to Humanity insofar that he tests our faith.”

“Officially? No. As far as the Church is concerned, it’s far more likely that the person is exhibiting something purely psychosomatic. But, if God had a

“Shut up Paul,” Dean shut the radio off, taking a deep breath. “Son of a bitch.”
Dean lowered his gaze to Castiel, furrowing his brow. He watched the angel for a moment before he turned his gaze to the Impala, sitting at the end of the parking lot. Taking a deep breath, Dean marched over to her.

Dean hung up the phone, shoving it back into his pocket.
“It’s no problem.” Dean cleared his throat. “Just don’t tell anyone what happened, okay? Pastor Jacob is a good man and I don’t want him gettin’ in trouble.”
:: Most secular historians believe Jesus' Cleansing of the Temple to be the most likely reason for Jesus' arrest. It is documented in all four canonical gospels and, along with his baptism by John, is thought to be one of few historically likely incidences in Jesus' life.
Dean cocked his eyebrow as he picked his beanie back up, running his hand through his hair, fixing it. “Hey, I’m not the one giving third base in a church."
Sam stood up and walked over to the bath tub, pulling some of the gauze strips down from the curtain rod before he kneeled in front of Dean, taking Dean’s right arm into his hands.

Already the floor was a mess of blood caked tiles and grout and the room stunk of roses.
“—Doing that would do jack shit.” Dean scoffed. “I have ‘phenomenal cosmic powers’ and
Judas scoffed. “And you haven’t listened to them.”
“Well, not anymore,” James said. “Things have changed.”
Bobby jumped to his feet, knocking the chair over as he rose. He darted up the stairs. When he pushed the bathroom door open; the sickeningly sweet aroma of roses he had come to associate with fear flooded his nose.
“You don’t understand. I can’t sit around doing nothing,” Sam said desperately. “This is
“Thank you. ” A sad smile spread across her mouth. “But I’m ill. Very ill. ”
“The fuck was that?” Dean asked, pulling his hands down from his temples.
Castiel kissed him back. Harder and deeper. He grabbed Dean’s jacket, turning him and pushing him against the front of the front pew, He slid Dean’s beanie off of his head, letting it fall to the floor as he dug his hands into Dean’s hair.
“You’ve Chosen

Rufus paused. “When did you learn Aramaic?”

Jesus didn’t respond and instead just kept chiseling away at the wood.
“I don’t mean to interrupt the reunion, but the padres’ eyes are burned out!” Bobby yelled, staring down at the lifeless bodies on the floor.
Then Sam noticed the blood dripping from Lilith’s mouth, running down her chin.  As soon as the first drop hit the floor, it turned into a thick, twisted, line. Slowly creeping and curling around the floor like a snake.
“—I tried to give the purse back but Naomi wouldn’t take it. Michael wouldn’t take it, so I tossed the cursed thing,” Judas hissed. “Tell me Castiel, what sort of fate befalls the man who betrayed the Messiah?
“And you haven’t introduced her to me yet?” Jesus cocked an eyebrow.
Alastair chuckled, grabbing Dean by his jacket, the leather scrunching between his fingers. “You know, we always knew about Sammy; Azazel’s Favorite, the Prodigy, the Boy King,
Dean cocked an eyebrow. “So you’re a hunter?”
“Yeah… looks like it.” Dean winced, glaring at him as he dragged himself out of the book pile.
"You go,” Jesus grumbled. “I need to finish my work."
Dean took a sip from his drink. “You wanna know what else isn’t like me, Sam? Getting my back torn up outta fucking nowhere,” Dean scoffed. There was frustration in Dean’s words as much as there was fear. “It’s been a week. A

Sam turned to see Brett, the same man in the photograph, surrounded by a group of what Sam assumed were the bar’s regular patrons, his face now completely healed.
Dean smiled at her sarcastically as he took a twenty from his pocket and handed it to her. “Sure. Why not?”
“I’ll ask you again,” Castiel growled, his voice filling the stable while he paced inside it, his gaze focused on the demon tied to one of the stall gates. “What are you doing here?”
“Oh, but that’s why you’re here, Dean-o,” Zachariah scoffed. “Didn’t you read the script?”
Dean glanced over at the truck driver, Tom, an elderly man pushing near eighty. He had offered Dean a ride completely unsolicited back in Lakin. Dean had learned through conversation that as a young man, he’d gone to jail for stabbing a man in a bar fight. “Hey, this is where I get off.”
Castiel lifted himself up off the floor the stage, spitting blood from his mouth. “It won’t come to that.” He pulled his sword from the sleeve of his trench coat. “Not again. Not while I’m alive.”
“Come on Dean! Breathe goddamn it!” Sam’s voice echoed through Dean’s ears, panicked and desperate. It was accompanied by the stench of blood and sulfur. Pungent and odorous.
Just as Mary looked as though she going to consider this, Joses stepped into the room. “Ima—”
Jessica’s grandmother had had one just like it on her living room mantel.

Finally, Bobby asked, “How
Estelle nodded. She walked Sam down a small hallway into the living room.  Against the walls sat a series of tables covered with saint statues and mansion jars filled with herbs. In the center of the room was a round coffee table on which rested stubby candles and a stack of tarot cards flanked by an old love seat and armchair. Estelle gestured to the couch for Sam to sit on while she sat down in the armchair.
The officer cocked an eyebrow. “Are you sure about that?”
“The Jordan. To follow John.” He glanced down at the rock his brother had thrown at him, still feeling its sting.
After a moment Sam lifted his gaze back up to Dean, shaking his head. “Dean, that’s
James froze dead in his tracks. He looked him up and down. “Castiel?” His voice cracked.
“War. Famine. Pestilence. Death. The Antichrist. They’re coming. The End is on its way. We’ve
Dean was sitting in the front pew of the church, the taste of blood still lingering on his tongue, when he heard wings flutter behind him.
“Winchester?” Jacob paused, squinting his eyes. “
Dean squinted.
Still, there was nothing. Just like every other time Sam prayed to Castiel.
They made their way out of the church and back to the Impala.
Ruby was a desperately needed escape from the constant pressure of caring for his brother. Ruby was nice curves in a low-cut tank top and tight jeans. She was body heat and sweet moans not held back as they moved together in an impassioned rhythm, skin against skin.

She looked at Sam and blinked.
“Exactly. You
This corpse was a far cry from the one Bobby had cleaned a year earlier when Dean had gone to Hell. That corpse had been a mauled mess of eviscerated organs and vicious hellhound bites. Bobby had to suture his torso back together to get him ready for burial. The smell had been awful.
“Cas taught me that! Dickwad!” Dean shouted, still wincing at the light as he ripped off a piece of his flannel shirt, tying it around his hand.
“I haven’t been batting a thousand for
“Whatever,” Dean sighed. “My point still stands.”
Dinah glanced down at his right hand. She cocked an eyebrow. “Why did you fight with Simon yesterday?” she asked, concerned.
Before Dean could object, Sam added quickly, “I’m
James looked at him and scoffed. “They’re not the only ones, brother. You’ve put quite a bit away yourself.”
The girl’s torso jerked itself forward with a loud gasp. Her eyes darted around the room with fear before they locked on Dean, still crouching on the floor next her. Tears started to fill her eyes as she lunged at him, wrapping her arms tightly around his waist as she buried her face in his chest and sobbed. “I’m sorry! I’m so sorry! That thing made me— “
Sam stopped dead in his tracks. He stood facing the door for a moment before he turned around, looking at Dean apologetically. “I knew how you were going to react. I just wanted to know
Everything was ready, he just had to wait. Aside from the bloody sweat that stopped some hours ago, nothing had happened.
“Dude. Will you chill out?” Dean rolled his eyes. “You’ve been on edge all day.”
of pain. Pain that was mockery in the form of signs hung around his neck and crowns placed upon his head. Pain that made his shoulders, forearms, and back raw. Pain that pierced straight through tendons and muscle. Pain that twisted itself inside his wrists and ankles and made his lungs burn every time he breathed. Pain that was the sound of a mother’s sobbing and the utter silence of a father.
“Well.” Dean chuckled. “I can

Dean had seen the image of the crucified Jesus many times in churches and on the ends of water-swollen rosaries, more times than he could count. Mostly he saw it as a symbol of man’s vicious towards one another. Of what the powerful could do to the powerless. More rarely he saw it as a symbol of why he could never get behind the idea of God: the need of violence and blood sacrifice and a father allowing his son to die. Now it had become yet
Ruby shifted in her seat, facing Sam. “You know Sam, I’m no expert on your brother, but I’m guessing that if Dean
“Is that supposed to frighten me?” Jesus scoffed.
“Why do you think those demons tried so desperately to get you to sell your soul? Why do think you were only given
This kind of thing happened far more often than Dean liked; angels sending overzealous people of faith to him as part of some personal revelation. It started happening soon after he began healing people and it was becoming a frequent occurrence.
Dean’s heart sank.
“What’s wrong then?”
As Sam walked over to them, he gave the priest a quick nod. “I got your text,” Sam lied.
Jesus rose from his place at the table and followed Castiel outside, stopping a few paces beyond the threshold. “You’re not here to join us. Are you, Castiel?” He glanced down at the wine cup in his hand before locking his eyes on Castiel.
Dean’s body was on the cot. Lifeless and still.
Dean cleared his throat. “Yeah. It is. But I’ve been praying…I guess.” He looked at Castiel. “And for
Jesus nodded, swallowing another bite of bread.  He raised the goatskin back to his lips. He spit it out immediately, wiping his mouth with his hand. The water had changed, becoming bitter on his tongue. Wine.
“You had a
Dean Winchester?”
He waited again, but nothing happened.
Doubt swirled in the pit of his stomach.
I’d expect from you.” He smirked.
After a few minutes, Ruby climbed out of bed, her wounds already half healed. Sam watched as she walked into the bathroom. He lay there quietly, listening to the shower turn on.
Dean sighed, relieved. “Good.”.
“Dean has stigmata,” Ruby’s words were sincere and blunt as she stood up from the bed. “Not only that, he’s the Chosen One for the Light Side of the Force. I get why you were keeping it under wraps. It’s smart of you do to it. But you don’t have to keep it from me.”

ago,” Zachariah scoffed. “We’re different people now. In your case. Literally. It’s time we moved past that. After all, we have the same goal now.”
Instantly the cave and desert were gone. The air was cooler and moist, filled with the familiar scent of burning cedar and olive wood. Jesus found himself standing in the hills just outside of Nazareth.
Dean closed his eyes. “So all these visions I’ve been having.” He swallowed, opening his eyes again, blinking tears away. “They’re my own….
When the nails were in, the demons they lifted the board up and nailed it to the pole, just high enough so Dean’s feet didn’t hit the ground.
Sam didn’t say anything. He climbed over the fence, vaulting over the top and on to the ground with a thud.
James quickly interrupted him. “—Joses, why don’t you help me gather up some of the—?”
Dean stood there for a moment, breathing in the cool, moist air before he took a deep pull from the bottle. He walked slowly down the stairs, every movement sending sharp pain through his ankles. Once at the bottom, Dean stopped and glanced around Bobby’s yard.

“You are
“So they’re…
He glanced over to Dean who was lying still on his bed—fresh bandages wrapped around his wrists, ankles, back, and forehead—his breaths shallow and pained. Castiel had appeared in the room briefly, not long after they got back, to ask them about the attack in the church and to check on Dean. He had offered to heal what Alastair had done to Dean, but Dean had refused. Sam watched with frustration as Dean reprimanded the angel for not doing his job before sending him away.
“Bobby if you Rick Roll me, I swear.”  Dean sighed.
“Do you remember anything?”
All Dean could do was scream. A guttural wail that cracked his voice and stung his throat raw.
Dean was silent. His chest heaved as he glanced around the room, refusing to make eye contact with the angel.
“What?” Dean blinked.
It was then that his phone went off with a text message:
Dean quickly collected himself, darting across the room to the motionless girl. He crouched down on the floor next to her, placing a hand lightly on her forehead as he whispered, “Get up.”
“No.” Dean froze in his seat.

“Are you Estelle Rohan?”  Sam asked.

When she finished wrapping Dean’s wounds, she grabbed the first aid kit and the glass of water and made her way back over to the counter. She only made it a few steps before she looked into the glass, stopping for just a moment before she continued her walk to the counter. She put the first aid kit and glass down and crossed herself, her hands trembling.
For a few days, Dean had been able to crash in the spare room of a farmhouse an hour outside of Dodge City. Andy, a man in his late forties with a bad hip and a failing farm, had offered Dean a place to sleep and a ride into Wichita if he’d fix his 1972 Chevrolet C10. Before Dean climbed out of the truck, he healed Phil’s bad hip, curing him of his bone cancer.
Shouts filled Dean ’ s ears. Castiel became a man named Simon of Cyrene. Dean stared at him through a swollen eye and a mess of blood and thorns.
” Naamah spat, her exhausted face reeling in disgust. Her eyes briefly turned black as Dean reentered the room. “You smell like you took a bath in some old lady’s potpourri bowl.
Bobby turned away, wiping his eyes again. He reached into his back pocket and pulled his flask, taking a deep pull. Bobby stood up and put the flask back in his pocket and walked over to the door, he opened it slowly.
—see him.
of you.”
The demon wearing Bishop Tamsen screamed. He collapsed to the floor.
Sam flexed his fingers, glazing up at the night sky. Aside from the stars, it was pitch black. No moonlight shone, making it all the more dark. “Powerful.”
Dean chuckled. “But what about the other side of it?” he asked. “Giving yourself up—no holds barred— to God? After everything you’ve seen, all the evil in this world.” He shook his head. “How do you do that?”
Bishop Tamsen froze. He looked at Dean’s hands. He shot Dean a look.”If you are Christ...then you should have the marks of His Passion.”
After cutting cut the ropes, Jesus and James walked the man back to the road were the Apostles were still waiting. They gave the man some food and water, before taking him to the city where they searched out a blacksmith to remove the chains. They had barely entered the city gates when the inhabitants crowded around them, demanding that they leave.
“So you went against our mission.” Castiel glared. “Again.”
“Well…” Sam took a notebook and pen out of the pocket of his jacket. “I noticed during my research and even in your book that there’s not a lot of set lore—
“No!” He stumbled back from her, shaking. With a blink, Lisa disappeared.
“That depends. Shapeshifters and Lycans you have to stab in the heart with a silver blade. Estries you behead with a sword.” Simon paused. “Dybbuks you can fend off with a sling and rocks of salt or a bow with arrows hewn from acacia wood, but if you truly want to kill them you have to salt and burn the bodies of the deceased that the dybbuk came from. We do that to every abomination we kill.”
“ So, what did you do to the Padres?”
to do with him losing his.”
Dean was walking out of Walgreens, a plastic shopping bag with three packs of Christmas lights inside when he heard a sound. A sound he was dreading. A person speaking into a megaphone echoing from the sidewalk just beyond the parking lot.
“Am I?” Zachariah cocked an eyebrow. “Your own father warned you about Sam. You know far better than anyone how far gone he is. How much
"Not anymore. After everything I’ve been through, I can’t be,” Jimmy shook his head. “I’m sure you understand.”
“I told you Dean. You
Jesus grew quiet. He looked at the front of the synagogue where the podium was situated. Behind the podium was a cut out in the wall covered by an embroidered curtain, behind that lay a wooden Torah ark where the scrolls where kept. Jesus and his father had built it just before his bar mitzvah. Normally, looking at it made Jesus' heartache. Now it caused a spark within him.
Dean took a deep breath. He shot Castiel a nervous look as he stepped away from the car. “So, which desert you would recommend, Cas? Sonoran or Mojave?”
“Set who…?” Sam’s eyes grew wide. He froze. “...What?! No! I stopped it!  I killed Lilith-”
But Dean couldn’t ignore it. He couldn't distract himself. Ringing out over the sound of hammer, over Dean’s sobs, was a voice. Nasally. Boisterous. Mocking. It was a voice Dean had come to know all too well. A voice Dean had come to fear and loathe, one that always promised more pain.
Ruby let out a guttural moan, jerking her hips closer to him. She reached up, pulling Sam’s hair tight until their eyes met.
Bobby nodded.  As Dean started to make his way down the hall Bobby called out. “Hanukkah starts at sundown, by the way.”
one that can.”
But the night before, Dean had heard something else in his dreams: The Voice. It was accompanied by the rustle of wings, wailing cries as a whip cracked through the air, mocking laughter and mourning sobs, and the terrible sound of wood and iron striking against each other.
“While we’re on the subject of Hell, Dean, was it
for you.”
“It’s not
Dean nodded reluctantly as he sat on top of one of Bobby’s filing cabinets, a tired sigh leaving his mouth. “Yeah. He said that I
—was more active at night than during the day when she would play Beatles records and talk to him. He was mischievous and loved attention. Mary shifted, running a hand across her belly.
Castiel watched Sam carefully. “Be careful, Sam.” There was caution in Castiel’s voice. “Envy, no matter how insignificant, doesn’t suit you.”
“Before...you loved Miriamne. And even if you hadn’t, you knew that a relationship between us was forbidden. You may have had feelings for me but you never acted on them.” Castiel nodded. “I know you won’t act on them now.”
Dean promptly shook his head with a sigh. “Sam, we’ve got an angel who’s lying to religious folk. We’ve got bigger shit to worry about right now.”
He remembered going by himself to say nightly prayers dressed in tefillin and a prayer shawl and when he was done, Castiel would always be there.
Dean cleared his throat. “Yeah. I know.”
“Really? Then do you wanna explain what you’ve
It was benevolent and
“Good.” She grinned as she gave the Bible and change to him. “You’ve got the Holy Spirit working within you. I can tell. You just gotta let it lead you.”
A warm gush of blood ran down his side.
Lisa stepped over the salt line. “Yes, you can. I can help you, Dean, just stay with me.” She wrapped her arms around him. “All you gotta do is nod your head and we can be in my bed, okay?” she whispered, leaning in to kiss him.
Dean was also a man in pain who had scarcely left his bed for three days. He was barely even able to care for himself. Despite the sacred wounds having closed over into bruises, the bones and tendons in his wrists and ankles were still torn and shattered, rendering both his feet and hands almost useless.
Sam stopped mid-stitch, his eyes locking on Dean. This wasn’t first time Dean had offered to heal him. There was his bruised rib in Michigan, a vampire bite in Tennessee, and a sliced arm in North Carolina. Dean offered to heal them all, but Sam had always refused.
, Dean. Don’t you wanna at least try—”

like you do. I’d see it for what it actually is.”
A lump grew in Dean’s throat.
“Jesus—”
Simon turned to walk inside. Jesus' fists clenched as he ran after him. He only got a couple steps before James jumped out in front of him, shoving his palms against his chest to hold him back.
John’s fists clenched. “You little—”
“Yes.” Jesus nodded. He held out his hands as if to gesture toward his still too thin frame.
“I know.” Anna sighed. “But putting Dean on a path to fulfill his destiny won’t prevent that from happening again.”
Sam’s jaw clenched. He knew he had blood on his face when he rescued Dean. He had tried to wipe as much of it off as possible while he ran into the pastor’s office, and he did it again in the Impala when Dean wasn't looking. He even washed his face when they got back to the motel room. He thought Dean wouldn’t notice it since he was so out of it from the beating and his wounds, but he’d been wrong.
Sister Joan watched him drink it. “You’re welcome.”
Castiel shook his head. “I can’t promise that.”
“Did I overcook it?” Bobby asked, putting his plate in the sink.
Dean couldn’t heal him. He couldn’t purge the demon blood from his body. Dean couldn’t
With a flap of his wings, Zachariah disappeared.
“Ruby?” Dean scoffed. He shook his head. “She’s got you by the fuckin’ nuts, Sam. She’s playing you for a chump and you’re falling for it.” Dean ran his hands tensely through his hair. “Tell me Sam, after everything that’s happened. After everything that’s happened
“Damn it.” Dean growled, changing the station again.
Again, there was no answer.

It was then that she heard the sound. A sound she hadn’t heard before, different from the creaks and groans of the house which she knew well; this one almost sounded like the rustling of wings.
The Title is from
Susan looked at Dean for a second. “I’ll say he does.” She walked over to Dean and hugged him. “As soon as we’re done taking care of that demon, I’m giving you a big bowl of that beef stew I’ve got going in the crockpot. You look like you could use a good meal.”
“Castiel.”
“Because I
His phone began to vibrate in his pocket. Dean pulled his phone out of his pocket, his hands trembling. It was Bobby. Dean just let it ring. The ringing ended and his phone flashed with a missed call.
“Hey.” Dean walked over to her, crouching down in front of her chair. He grabbed her hand. “It’s okay.” He paused. “Listen to me. What your Dad did was very brave and selfless. He did it because he loves you. Okay? Remember that.”
“The same thing I’ve been fighting my whole life. A vile, evil piece of supernatural shit. The only difference between them and you is you got the bigger ego.”

“I know this is hard for you. Given the bond the two of you had. He didn’t want to leave you. Again.” Jimmy paused. “In fact, his last thoughts were of you and how much he loved you.”
Dean just nodded. Silence filled the booth for the long moment before Dean cleared his throat. “So you’re from Illinois?”
“Don’t tell me that.” James spat, tears streaming down his cheeks. “I’m the reason he’s doing this.”

The priest crossed himself at the sight of the wounds. He hesitated before he touched Dean’s hands, turning each of them over as he inspected them. “You poor boy,” he sighed, remorse tingeing his words as he let go of them.
Dean got up and walked over to the window. Rufus’ front steps were covered in snow so much that the steps were no longer visible. The driveway and the Impala was buried in a blanket of snow
hopeful,
“Cas!” Dean yelled.
Dean sat on the bench for a moment before he stood up, checking his watch. He sighed deeply. “Come on Sammy, it’s quarter till. If we go in now, we can probably still get good seats.” With that, he marched himself in the direction of the sanctuary door.
“No James—”
“Once the Nazarene is dead, we’ll make sure that the brothers and sisters you led astray are handed over to Naomi and dealt with. You can thank Uriel for that, he was loyal enough to come forward and beg that their lives be spared,” Zachariah hissed, his eyes narrow. “As for you? Anna convinced Michael to spare you. And because you’re one of our best soldiers, we will, but this is your last chance. The next time you defy a direct order, brother, it will be your last.”
“One of my older siblings took it but beyond that, I don’t know what happened to it. No one does.” Castiel shrugged. “I can only assume that’s its atoms are strewn out among the stars.”
Castiel watched him for a second, then nodded.
Climbing out of the Chevelle, Dean was enveloped by the smell of cold lake water and trees. Leaning against the side of the car, he took in a deep contented breath, letting the cool, fresh air fill his lungs.
Embarrassment washed over Dean’s face as he shook his head. “Sam, I’m not—”
“If you think that’s good, wait until you try the
The Impala was instantly engulfed with the blaring sound of rhythmic feedback from the guitars and bass. Then the singing started. Kurt Cobain’s rendition of David Bowie’s ‘The Man Who Sold the World
“Dean, listen.” Sam sighed, picking the bloody bath towel up from his bed. “I didn’t have a choice. He was gonna kill you and—”
Bobby awoke to a throbbing head and water dripping on his face. He opened his eyes to a twilight sky covered in black clouds, thunder booming in the distance.
“What do you mean we ran out?” Jesus scrunched his brow. “There was enough for sixty guests.”
Jesus had seen the angel many times while he walked through the desert.  He’d seen him standing behind palm trees and on top of rock bluffs, hovering in the hills outside the tent of a Bedouin family who had given him shelter.
Jesus nodded. He flung his bag and goatskin over his shoulder and wrapped the scarf back over his head. “Once I get back to the river I just need to follow it north to Galilee. It shouldn't take more than a fortnight to get home.”
By midnight, Castiel had killed two demons and three of his brothers. Their bodies lay at the entrance of the garden, the charred impressions of their wings contrasted highly against the sand in the moonlight.
He set his gaze on the angel tending a fire near the mouth of the cave. Jesus' goatskin and bag were sitting next to him by the fire, his prayer shawl meticulously folded and resting on top of the bag.
Sam stared down at the circular bruises, crusted with half-drying blood, on his brother’s wrists. “Yeah. I would.” Sam glared, looking back up at Dean. “And I wouldn’t treat like a
There was a beat of silence before the message ended.
As soon as the door closed, tears flooded Dean’s eyes. When the sound of Sam’s footsteps had disappeared down the hall, Dean let out a broken sob, sucking in raspy breath after raspy breath as his chest heaved.
“Careful.” Castiel caught him just as his feet touched the ground, his legs instantly buckling under the pain. “I admire your determination, but it’s still going take some time for them to fully heal.” He carefully placed Dean back on the bed, steadying him.

Dean was saved and his salvation was preordained. Dean
His torso became rigid as his eyes shifted.
The parishioners clapped and cheered.
As soon as Dean’s feet touched the concrete, the woman snapped awake. Her eyes grew pitch black, locking squarely on Dean. She growled, low and vicious, her hands tightly gripping the armrests.
“I’m not just “some dick angel”, Dean,” he raised his voice slightly. “I’m Zachariah. Castiel’s superior.”
This coming Friday was the start of Hanukkah and it was already Tuesday.
“Are you an angel?” She tilted her head slightly.
He sat there quietly for a moment, his hands resting weakly on the steering wheel. His eyes looked over briefly at the empty passenger seat before he turned the ignition on and backed out of the parking space, taking the short drive back to the motel room that seemed to take an eternity.
“A few of John’s followers came from that village.” Jesus shifted his eyes. “ I met some of them at the Jordan and with John dead—”
Dean watched Castiel, glancing between the angel and the crucifix. “Jesus didn’t go to the cross
“No.” Castiel shook his head, pulling his hand away. “I can’t— I

“He got the shit kicked out of him again?” Ruby chuckled. “That’s been happening a lot lately.”

Dean watched him for a moment, furrowing his brow. “Man, you really are jealous, aren’t you?” Dean shook his head. “Tell me Sam, would you want

The golden light coming from Lilith grew brighter, almost blinding, showing the shadow of her vessel's skeleton. After a few seconds, Lilith let out a loud scream. Then the light flickered out. The body she was possessing collapsed onto the floor next to the altar with a thub. Motionless. Lifeless.
? Giving you back what was taken from you?”
Finally he opened his eyes again as the air in the church began to thicken. It tingled and buzzed on Dean’s skin, like static before a lightning storm. Dean closed his eyes, letting the smell and the heat radiate through him until finally he opened his eyes again.
“No offense, but your brother’s a handful twenty-four seven, three-sixty five.” Ruby sighed.  She pulled a flask from the back pocket of her jeans and held it out to Sam. “Take this. You’re gonna need it.”
That always happened when Dean had those dreams. Eventually, he would end up speaking Aramaic or Hebrew in his sleep.
“Basically, yeah.” Dean took another sip of his beer. “But that’s not the
Dean stared at him. “You—” He took in a sharp breath as he rose slowly to his feet. “—You like you’ve seen a ghost.”
He was awoken by the feeling of a cold, perspiring glass nudging against his arm. He woke quickly, rubbing his face as he stretched to find Bobby standing next to him, beer and a plate of dark brown grilled cheese in hand.
“...the Stigmata?” Jacob’s eyes went wide. He looked at Dean for a moment. “What exactly are you trying to get at here, Dean?”
Sam had watched Dean die before, countless times. But he had watched Dean die
,” His voice was quiet and strained. He lifted his head up from the back of the seat.
“You know,
“Get up,” the officer ordered.
“Well…” Sam cleared his throat. “I’m writing my senior thesis on the phenomena of stigmata. Your book’s been a major source of my research and when I found out that you lived only twenty minutes away...”
His heart sank for just a moment, though he didn't know why.
“Right.” Castiel took his shoes and jacket off before climbing into the bed, wrapping his arms protectively around Dean. “How was the first night of Hunnukah?” He said, his breath brushing against Dean’s neck.
:: The Gospel of Mathew mentions that at the time of Jesus' death, 'The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.'

page.” Dean gritted his teeth. “You and your boss Michael to go fuck yourselves. I’m not saying ‘yes’ to him. Ever. And I’m sure as hell not letting him use my corpse while my soul’s stuck in wherever the fuck this is.”
“He will stop Lucifer. He’ll have the help of the righteous man who started this whole mess in the first place, Judas of Kerioth.” She took a deep breath. “I’ve tasked our sister Asariel with retrieving him from Gehenna and giving him his mission.”
Dean woke with a start. He placed his hands over his eyes, rubbing them tensely. Though he remembered the conversation, he couldn’t remember what it was about. All he knew was that it was something important. Something dire.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Were you ever close?”
“No,” Castiel said bluntly. “I need to return to Heaven.”
The hypocrisy of his brother’s actions grated on Sam the most.
“It’s okay Dean,” Bobby’s voice called out to him, panicked and dripping with fear, but never the less trying it’s best attempt at comfort. “You’re gonna be alright.”
Sam nodded anxiously as he walked over to the motel room window, Dean’s water glass in hand, and peered outside from behind the blinds.
Sam stopped, turning around. “What?”
Dean Winchester.
It looked like the kind of place Sam would have hunted ghosts in. A sanitorium or a tuberculosis hospital, perhaps.  The only clues to the building's real identity was a crumbling, half-missing cross on top of the tower that marked the entranceway.

“You shouldn’t talk to me that way,” Ruby threatened. “Sam won’t like that.”

“Bits and pieces. Being possessed by an angel is kinda like...riding the tail of a comet.”
:: Though Lucifer and Hell have always existed in the Supernatural universe, anthropologically they are concepts that evolved over time. Lucifer, has some (though not all) of his roots in the angel Samael who is referred to in various Jewish apocryphal texts as ‘HaSatan’ or ‘The Adversary’  and is said to have been cast down from Heaven by Michael. Likewise, Hell has its roots in the Jewish concept of Sheol, a realm of the dead were everyone – both righteous and unrighteous- went after death. A place similar to Hades in Greek mythology. Late second temple Judaism developed the concept of Gehenna, a section of Sheol were the wicked went after death to suffer.  While I can have Castiel and other angels refer to Lucifer and Hell as Lucifer and Hell, having Jesus refer them as such would be anachronistic.

“Am I?” Dean cocked an eyebrow. “You know, when he died he felt abandoned by God. All of his faith was gone. For all I know, the reason why I don’t have faith has

Then, out of nowhere, came the sound of a whip cracking.
“You could say so. Yes.” Jesus said. “But my family hasn’t exactly taken a liking to it.”
He was different. He lacked faith, but what he lacked in faith, he made up for with a will as strong as iron. He was rough and angry, but despite all of that, there was great kindness and love within him.
“Do you work here a lot?”
“Thank you.” Aleah stared at Dean for a second. “You’ve got a halo,” she said bluntly, her eyes focusing on Dean’s head.
, her very first ones, and she treasured them dearly.
Dean’s eyes once again lowered. He bit his lip as he laced his hands together between his knees, “Ya know what Sammy… Since this started I’ve been having visions of the crucifixion. I’ve felt what
“Thanks?” Dean furrowed his brow, watching Jimmy dig into his burger. A long moment passed before he spoke again.  “Do you know what happened to Cas?”
“And you’re supposed to fight each other? To the death? And take the planet along with you? Finish what Michael and Lucifer started when Michael chucked his baby brother Lucifer into the Pit?”
Dean nodded awkwardly. “Got it.”
“I’m scared shitless. But like you said, I don’t have a choice.” He tied a wool army blanket to the top of his duffle bag and then looked up, meeting Castiel’s gaze. “The one choice I know I do have is to not sit on my ass.”
“Nothing. Let’s go.” There was urgency in Dean’s voice as he backtracked, grabbing Sam by the arm in an attempt to pull him closer to the Impala.
“I think I have a
Dean raised his voice, disgusted. “No.” The word barely left his mouth when he cleared his throat. “No.” This time it was placid. Apathetic. “I’m not hungry.”
“Castiel.” Uriel let out an annoyed breath as he went about inspecting the area. “I see you finally decided to join me.”
“No, I’m not here to take you to Heaven.” Without a second’s hesitation, Dean reached over and grabbed her hand, his larger callused hand engulfing her smaller one. “Did you…
different from the pain he had known in Hell.
“You’re here, Lord. Zachariah told me you would be,” the boy, Joel, chirped.
It reeked of sulfur and blood.

“Why?”

Then Dean remembered.

Dean took it and placed it around the rearview mirror.
Dean sat there in silence before he put the key in the ignition, turning the accessory function and radio on. With a wince, he reached down into his shoebox of cassette tapes, briefly rummaging through them before he pulled one out.
“Unfortunately,” Castiel said. “Dean has certain restrictions. Healing Sam is one of them.”
Dean didn’t know where he was going. He had only a basic route of
Sam stood there for a moment. He was utterly silent as he grabbed his flannel shirt and jacket from the floor, quickly making his way over to the motel room door.

kind of hunt. Finally, he came upon what he could only hope was a poltergeist in Northwest Missouri. Sam protested, but the rest of the week was spent on Interstate 70.
Sam ignored him. Glaring, he turned to the demons wearing police officers. “Crucify him.”
It was an evening of Jack Daniel’s shots and overzealous flirting. By the end of the night, Dean found himself on his knees out behind the bar; his face between the thighs of a redhead dressed in a denim miniskirt and cut-off Gun & Roses t-shirt, listening to her enraptured blasphemes and feeling her fingers tug at the nape of his neck. Dean hated knowing that such sounds were, in fact, blasphemes and he knew, or at least

to find Dean. Tell me where he is.”
Dean could feel Him.
By the time he had checked the Bethlehem Public Library’s hours of operation, taken a shower, and gotten dressed, the sun had fully risen. Dean was still sleeping when he left the motel room. Sam was thankful for that.
“And you’re okay with that?”
Bobby stared at the body for a long time before he narrowed his eyes at it. “Fuck it,” he rasped. He made his way over to the basement door, grabbing an axe as he made his way upstairs.
to make it stop. Doesn’t that count for something?
Jesus nodded. “I did.”
Standing in front of the altar was a woman with curly blond hair, wearing a white, blood-spattered satin gown. In her hands was a large metal chalice.The woman turned at the sound of the doors slamming open.
Dean and Bobby left the restaurant, heading back over to Jimmy’s house. They knocked on the door. A few seconds later, Jimmy answered the door.
? Alpha and fuckin’ Omega? I should be able to heal Sam, no problem.”
completely divine.”
The dust-caked pews were painted white, chipped and rotted. Some had already collapsed with age. Walking down the aisle, Dean noticed the organ. It was covered in dust, but he could still hear it hum from the wind going through its pipes. The pews were covered with stacks and stacks of hardcover hymnals and bibles. They were water stained, and they looked as though they would fall apart if Dean picked one of them up.
Anna disappeared. Castiel stood out in the field for a moment before he looked back at the stable.

James glanced over at the vats. “But that’s
A light scoff left Sam’s mouth. “We’re not Irish. Or Catholic. Or
“Why the fuck did you even bother?” Dean blinked tears away from his eyes, turning back around. “I broke the first seal. I jump-started the damn Apocalypse. I’m the reason the world is doomed to shit. Why didn't you just leave me there? Why did you bring me back?”
The Sunday after getting the nail wounds, Dean had woken up to find the bones and tendons in his wrists and ankles completely healed. Though Dean wasn’t sure
Then, through the open chapel doors he saw Sam.
“Dean! What the hell happened?” Sam was crouched on the floor next to him, his eyes wide with horror; he had been jolted awake by the sound of Dean screaming in a language that sounded vaguely like Hebrew. He’d bolted out of bed to find Dean lying on the floor, the back of his flannel shirt intact, but stained in ever-thickening crisscross patterns of blood.
been going, then?”
“Neither is killing half the world!”
Dean quickly paused the video. Staring at it.
As soon as Castiel hands touched him, a smell flooded Dean’s nostrils. The stench of blood and sweat surrounding him. It was followed swiftly by the sound of shouts and jeers and cries. A voice—raspy and deep—whispered to him, begging him to let him stay. Standing before him was Castiel, but it wasn’t Castiel.  He had dark eyes and tanned skin wearing a rough wool tunic, but he bore same the expression on his face. One of guilt and anger, sadness and pity. He pressed his hand gently on Dean’s left shoulder and a bright light emanated from it, soaking into the raw skin.
Jesus rolled his eyes. “I didn’t buy wine from the merchant. I just told Ima that I did.” Jesus said bluntly. “On carpenter’s wages, we could never afford enough wine for sixty people. Not even with the extra money Ima and Dinah make from selling goat cheese. I thought I made enough earlier, but I was wrong.” He shrugged. “Dinah’s new family has quite the appetite for wine,” he muttered to himself.
“I’m not gonna say yes. I
Dean turned his head, cocking an eyebrow at Sam. “Reveal myself?”
“Getting you out of here,” she said, her words blunt and panicked.
It was quickly followed by
“Are you frightened?”

“So it’s in Heaven, then?” Dean looked at Castiel warily. “Right?”
Jesus lowered his eyes. Slowly he walked over to Mary and wrapped his arms around her shoulders.  She squeezed him back briefly before she pulled away, cupping his face in her hands. Without a word she let go and did the same to James before she went back inside the house.
Soon the narrow access road disappeared, turning into a forest trail made of crushed leaves and footprints. The only real source of direction being a series of upside-down crosses carved into tree trunks.
“The hell are you talking about?”
James and Joses came out of the house, both of them laughing. Joses ran over to the work table, briefly greeting Jesus as he grabbed a small wooden amulet, intricately carved—a gift for a girl he had his eye on—from the table before running out of the courtyard. James walked over to him, leaning against the work table. He watched Jesus work for a moment he let out a slight laugh. “In the entire time Joses and I covered your work we never made anything as impressive as that table.”
Jesus didn’t say anything.
But Dean-Jesus- did love him. He just couldn’t acknowledge it. Part of him and always felt that he wasn’t supposed to find love. He had a different purpose. But had found love with Mariamne- Mary Magdalene. Maybe he wanted to feel normal. Human. Have the one thing he had denied himself. Maybe it was the work of the angels to ensure that his bloodline lived on. After all, Dean and Sam needed to exist. Dean wasn’t sure.
“Here. Eat.” The angel said, holding the plate out. “You need your strength.”
ago. Hell, what I shoulda done the moment you told me about this whole Messiah thing in the first place.”
Dean was quiet for a second. He swallowed. He scrunched his brow. “Intimidating. I guess. It was huge. Of course, there were Roman soldiers stationed on top of the outside court. Watching.”
“You’ve got some nerve,” Sam hissed. “You sanctimonious asshole.”
“No!” Dean rasped, pulling himself out of the brush. Before the light faded, he could see the shadow of Castiel’s frame- limp and motionless- slump to the ground.
“Yes, I do Cas.” Dean pulled his beanie, jacket, and flannel off, tossing them to the floor. He held his wrists out.
Dean dragged his hand down his face as he ran out of the study. “Fuck,” he hissed. “We gotta find him. Now. And stop him.”
Jacob nodded. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”
“I know.” Sam’s eyes narrowed. “I just want my brother back.” He paused, his hands gripping tightly around the steering wheel. “How much longer until I’m strong enough to ice Lilith?”
“Shit!” he hissed, dropping the beads into the dirt and cupping his hand in his other.

“Ya know…” Dean looked down at his hands, smiling sadly. Already, blood had begun to seep through the gauze. “You remind me of someone.”

The heat beneath Jesus' skin began to swirl like a sandstorm. His hands clenched into fists. “Unclean spirits,” he yelled, his voice trembling with rage. “Leave him.”
When Sam came into the motel room, Dean was sitting on the end of his bed, watching television and slowly drinking a cup of coffee, his face still very tired and pale. “So… what’s the verdict on that Dullahan?”
The oppressive smell of roses lingered heavily upon Dean's clothes and body. The smell even managed to soak into the interior of the Impala. No matter how many sponge baths he took or how much cologne he doused himself with, it
The sound of the door closing followed by footsteps filled the church.

:: David Koresh was the leader of the Branch Davidians, a religious cult and offshoot of the Seventh-day Adventist church, located in Waco, Texas. He was believed by both himself and his followers to the Final Prophet and Messiah. In 1993, a raid was conducted on their compound, the Mount Carmel Center, by the U.S. BATF. A later siege conducted by the FBI ended with the compound being burning to the ground. All of the occupants, including David, were killed.
“Can it. You’re not the one that’s been driving for the last seven hours,”  Bobby said, sinking into the armchair with a groan, closing his eyes. “After my nap I’m gonna do some laundry. Then we can do some lore digging. Figure out where Sam and Lucifer are.”
Even though Dean wasn’t a believer, he nevertheless appreciated the honesty and humility of those churches. The Methodist church would rather put the collection money towards a child’s medical bills than towards a new steeple. The Baptist church ran a soup kitchen and clothing drive after every service. Even the Pentecostal church that Dean wasn’t too thrilled with had some of the best homemade pie he’d ever eaten, courtesy of a bake sale.
“Father?” Dean called out. The word didn’t sit right on his tongue as it echoed through the church. He glanced up towards the ceiling. “Listen, I’m not gonna leave this place until you speak to me. No angels. No bible-thumpers. Nothin’. Just you and me, mano-a-mano. You got that?”
Bobby walked over to him, picking one of the amulets up. “I still can’t believe that you made two anti-possession amulets out of a random branch from the back yard in what? A few hours?”
“Jesus was supposed to be a Prophet and Messiah to his people. He was supposed to remove the yolk of Rome from their shoulders and take their pagan gods out of the Holy Land. Eventually, He was to help the Heavenly Host take back the Earth from the various pagan pantheons.” He took a deep breath. “But then Seals began to break, and that all changed. Instead, we needed him to take up arms against the Morning Star.”
He kicked them with the sole of his boot

Father DeMatteo stood up. He stared at Dean. “He’s telling the truth, Your Excellency. When I opened my eyes, the light of Heaven shone around him. He was joined by choirs of angels and saints.”

“And Sam’s the vessel of Lucifer?”
Mary pressed her hands to his cheeks. She was just about to walk away when she glanced over at Miriamne.  “Shalom,” she called out, wiping her eyes. “I am Jesus' mother.”
“Please Castiel. Just,” Jesus’ voice trembled. “Go. I can’t bear for you to witness this. Get my wife to safety. Get my family to safety. Do that for me.”
Dean nodded, taking a deep breath. “So what’s the deal with this?” He gestured to her habit. “Is this some case you’re working?”
It was roses and it
loved him. Even as years turned to decades. Even as Decades turned into centuries. Even as centuries turned into millennia. Somehow, some way, his love for Dean never faltered. Even now. But he had never spoken it. Maybe it was because angels weren’t supposed to love humans.
The words stopped and the pain receded.  When Dean came to, he found himself lying on the pavement, Bobby hovering over him.
“Shit,” he hissed.
“Thank God they have a laundromat. I’ve been rotating the same pair of skivvies for the last week.”
“I know that.”
Dean was halfway through eating when it happened. An ache slammed into his chest, heavy and tight. Sadness stole his appetite and robbed him of what energy he had left.
“Hello!” he shouted.
“How you holding up?” Sam asked. He winced as he pulled another stitch through his skin. He took a large gulp from the whiskey bottle, wiping up the blood that ran down his arm with a dingy bath towel that was quickly becoming more red than white.
Sam sat there for a moment. He stared down at his phone and then at the empty flask before he shoved both into his jacket and pulled out of the parking lot.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw the glint of an angel sword at his feet on the floor. He reached down and grabbed it, thrusting it into Azazel’s chest. He watched his body stiffen and glow before he yanked the blade out, pushing the body to the floor.
“Then why do you have such doubts regarding your mission?”
“I know. I’m sorry, Bobby.” Sam took a deep breath. “You look exhausted. Why don’t you go take a nap? I’ll keep an eye on Dean.”
“Did he mention where he was going?”
Dean’s bloodshot eyes were crusted with dried tears. Eventually he managed to open them, rubbing them as he sat up, groaning as the wounds pulled.
Enochian.
Half a foot behind him was Castiel.
Jesus' head bobbed to the side of the crowd, scanning it briefly. “I saw my brother in the crowd. He brought Ima and Miriamne here. If you want to help me, Castiel, you’ll make sure they’re safe.”
James did not quite meet his eyes when he shrugged. “I’m not sure,” he replied.
“Okay, you’re upset. I get it.” Zachariah shrugged. “Our
kinda church yet, Sammy.” He shrugged. “Who knows, maybe they won’t be as bad as they look.” Dean breathed deeply as he made his way over to the door and walked inside, Sam following behind him.
A month and a half passed by in much the same way as it always had for the brothers. A vampire nest taken out in Tennessee and a salt and burn in Indiana. But things had also become very different, taking the form of broken Seals and fallen angels. There was a demon not seen for six centuries raised by a witch on Halloween and an angel reborn as a young woman. The brothers also found themselves trapped in a motel just outside of Raleigh the week of Thanksgiving courtesy of a blizzard, the newest round of ever-increasing demonic omens.
He looked Jesus up and down with a critical gaze. “Brother,” he sneered. “Did you stroll back into the village just this morning?”
Dean sat up, putting his torso against the wall and pillow, staring at Castiel. Not at his vessel, but at the angel underneath. A glowing figure with a pair of black wings with rainbow colored tips.
Father’s image. He was the Son of Man as much as he was the Son of God. He was a human and he needed to be as most humans were: devoid of pretension or grandeur. It was far more of a miracle for the son of a poor, grieving carpenter to bring salvation than the Emperor Augustus.
Something snapped within Jesus. In one quick motion, he drew back his fist and swung at Simon, landing a punch across his jaw.
was one, Sam.” Bobby deadpanned. “ In case you forgot who he is.”
“Jesus, this is Elias of Magdala.” Daniel gestured to the man, “I was showing him the table and mezuzahs you made and he thought they were just magnificent.”
Through his blurring eyes, he saw Sam, covered in cuts and bleeding, standing just inside the office with his hand raised, pinning Alastair to a wall. He watched as Sam’s fingers tightened into a fist and Alastair screamed out, convulsing and glowing until finally the light faded and his body collapsed, slumping down in a broken pile against the wall. Sam ran over to Dean and lifted him off the floor, carrying him quickly out of the church and into the parking lot.
Bobby shook his head. “Whatever he’s sayin’ to Dean right now is for Dean’s ears only. Trust me.”
Dean froze. “But…why the hell am
“Let’s try this again.” Sam lowered his hand. “Where’s Lilith?”
Dean brushed his short bangs over his forehead with his fingers, trying to cover the purple-tinted scars that marked it to no avail. For months he had always worn some sort of beanie to cover them, but he couldn’t wear one into a police station while posing as a FBI officer. Without it, Dean felt almost naked.
“Do you—” Sam cleared his throat. “—Do you want something to eat? Broth? Saltines?”
Suddenly, Dean’s lungs filled with burning pressure and his ankles and wrists began to throb, the flesh twisting against the nails. Dean choked back the sobs with a sharp cry as he wiped the tears away with his stiff fingers.  He looked down at his wrists and the blood saturated gauze that wrapped them and slowly lowered them into his lap. He leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes.
Before Dean could say anything more, The Silence returned, followed by the agonizing pain of steel cutting between his ribs, sliding past bone and into muscle, radiating through his chest.
“I don’t
“Yeah. I know.” Dean let out a deep breath, rolling his eyes. “Trust me.”
Ruby sighed. “There’s barely a soul in Hell who
Sam cocked an eyebrow her. “What exactly are you talking about?” He chuckled nervously.
After a few moments, Sam was greeted by a short, middle-aged priest with a mug of tea in his hand. “Hi… Father Michael Frati?” Sam smiled awkwardly as he quickly regained his composure. “I’m Sam. I called earlier?”

So when Dinah’s new father in law, Daniel, called him over to meet a family friend who was attending the wedding with his daughter, Jesus almost refused to go. But the hopeful look on his sister’s face as she watched the exchange between the two men ultimately made him consent to the meeting.
standing in Lucifer’s way.” He grinned. “Not even Michael.”
Archangel Gabriel?”
Two hours later Sam pulled Bobby’s driveway, the tank nearly empty because he didn’t dare stop for gas. He darted around to Dean’s door, opening it and walking Dean out. Sam closed the door with a hard slam that made Dean wince and shoot him a look of worry while they limped up the stairs of Bobby’s porch.
even.  A welcome change from what their lives had become. There were no trench coat sporting angels, no threat of broken seals or the very real possibility of Lucifer being freed from his Cage. They weren’t dealing with the impending Apocalypse. Just a three hundred-year-old dead girl throwing a fit. It was familiar, comparatively easy and nostalgic.
, but it lasted only a brief second before it faded again, leaving Dean cold, plagued by his fear, guilt, and self-doubt.

Disgust washed over Uriel’s face. “I never went against our mission. I did what we had been
Sam pulled against her grip, causing pain to sear through his scalp. He let out a growl and gripped her wrist, squeezing it.
They walked into the police station, made their way to the front desk, and pulled out their badges.
Bobby smirked. “What’s that thing you always say about shotguns and music?”
“Sam doesn’t know where I am.” Dean paused for a second, looking her up and down.
Castiel nodded.

and you certainly don’t believe it now. What the angels did—whatwe did—was wrong. You know that better than anyone. From the moment Jesus climbed out of the Jordan River, you never left his side. You walked with him to Golgotha.” Anna glanced down the road, looking at Dean. She watched him climb into the backseat of an oil truck before she turned her gaze back to Castiel. “Please, Cas. You have to stop this before it goes too far,” she pleaded, grabbing his hand.
:: Jesus' Baptism in the Jordan River by John the Baptist is considered by the canonical gospels and by most historians to mark the start of Jesus' ministry.
Just as quickly as the memory came on, it left, and Dean found himself back in the church with Castiel—
Pamela asked, curiously.
“Because,” Jesus paused, “because I
“No. Shortly after Jesus’ death, I was forced to return to Heaven. The first thing I did was look for him. I searched for his soul—desperately—through all the heavenly spheres, but I could never find it.” Castiel paused. “But…I did find his soul again. Eventually. I stood in its presence for the first time in twenty centuries, five months ago.” He locked his eyes on Dean. “When I pulled

Jesus froze. “Don’t worry about it, little brother.” He lifted his gaze up to James. His voice shook as he started to walk back over to the work table. “You wouldn’t understand.”
Ruby hooked her ankles behind his back.
“Balls.”
Dean knew these dreams weren’t the result of remembering Hell, even if they often bled into one another.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed, he put the car in drive, heading off down the street.
Bobby shot Dean a look as he opened the trunk. “Told ya.”
The pastor continued, “As you know, last week my nephew, Joel, told me that an angel came to him. That Messenger of the Lord told him that for the first time in two thousand years, Christ walks the Earth.” He gestured to a nine-year-old boy sitting in a chair up on the stage. “Well, this angel has now told him that we’ve been Chosen. We are going to herald His Second Coming.”
hope Dean gets better.” Ruby smiled. She pulled Sam into a quick hug, kissing him lightly on the cheek before she pulled away and walked back over to her Mustang.
Castiel watched the reflection of the Christmas lights in the black door of the Impala as Sam helped Dean into the passenger seat. This Christmas was icy and he knew that if was he able to feel the cold as his vessel did, he would be freezing in the night air and snow with just his trench coat. He remembered the first Christmas and he couldn’t help but compare it to this one, the first he’d experienced on Earth in two thousand years.
Silently, he made his way past spatters of blood, police tape, and chalk body outlines through the vestibule and to the sanctuary. His angel sword tucked into the sleeve of his trench coat.
It was early afternoon and Sam was exhausted.
Slowly, Dean’s gaze drifted over to the pile of clothes on the bed next to him. Staring at the pile for a second, Dean picked up the haphazardly thrown trench coat, shaking the wrinkles out before he laid it out on the bed and folded it. Meticulously and with great precision like a veteran flag. Once it was folded, he grabbed the tie from the pile, straightening and folding it before laying it on top of the trench coat. He picked them both up into his hands, staring at them for a long moment before he took a deep breath.
James was sitting next to the fire, staring into the flames. He smiled tightly in greeting when Jesus joined him, and scooted over on the fallen log to allow Jesus to sit. “How many demons were in that man?” he asked, poking the fire with a stick to turn one of the logs over. The flames rose up, their heat blowing across Jesus' face as the wind shifted.
, did He?” The question played on his tongue with fear as he stepped out of the pew and into the aisle.
go to Hell.” Dean shook his head. “But I’m no demon or hellspawn or anything like that.”
Dipping his fingers in the blood, Dean drew the sigil on to the trunk.
“I have to pay the priests a visit. I’ll be back later.”
“Dean?”

“We’re not
They left Dean’s feet dangling, laughing as they backed away from him.
Before leaving Pontiac, Dean and Bobby stopped at the Pontiac Family Kitchen- a mom and pop diner Bobby insisted on stopping at because he had eaten there whenever he took a trip on Route 66.

“At least two. Make sure you get the ones that stay lit even if one goes out.”

Jesus didn’t respond. He led her out of the garden, heading to the storage room of Dinah’s new home.

Castiel didn’t say anything.
Sam didn’t say anything. He turned slowly, his eyes locking hard on Dean.
“Well...we’ll see.” Bobby scratched his head under his hat. He plugged the light set into a random socket, checking them.
He was about the cross the threshold when his mother walked in. Mary glanced down at the jug in his hand. “Makes sure you come back inside for morning meal,” she demanded. “We’re making honey cakes.”
A moment passed before James spoke again. He breathed deeply. “You still blame yourself for what happened to Sarah?  How many times have you gone to her tomb asking for forgiveness?”
Dean walked up the aisle without saying another word.
It gave him purpose, clarity,
The title is from
Jacob did the same.
“How do you know that?”
“—Stop this, Jesus.” Simon hissed as pushed himself through the crowd and ran up to the podium. “You’re embarrassing yourself.”
John looked up, an excited smile spreading across his face. “A boy? You must be bummed that we can’t name him Deanna. You were so set on it.”
“No, he doesn’t.” Anna shook her head. “We’ve asked far too much of Dean already.” She paused. “If Lucifer is released, we’ll be asking the impossible of him. Dean will have to—”
Much to Sam’s dismay, he found neither a hunt nor Dean.
As soon as Dean’s feet hit the second-floor landing, Castiel turned and started to make his way through the kitchen to the front door.
All he knew was darkness.
“Pretty bad,” Jacob said wearily. “I counted seven demons in her so far.”
“No Bobby. I’m fine.” Dean shook his head.
“Hey, Bobby.”
“I know, I know,” Dean hugged him back. He held for a long moment before pulling away from Bobby.  “How- how long was I out?”
Castiel turned his eyes, setting them on Anna.
But there was one thing Castiel never forgot, even as the decades turned into centuries and centuries turned into millennia.
“You’ve got no idea.” Sam’s brow furrowed as he extended his hand out, open and fingers spread, his eyes focused on Naamah. Her eyes grew wide with pain as her body started to spasm. Sam’s fingers and teeth clenched as she began to choke and gag.
At John’s words, bile rose from the pit of Dean’s stomach. Dean looked down at the floor, swallowing thickly.
Dean paused for a second then nodded. “I am,” he whispered.
The first thing Bobby noticed was the smell. The

A bright light began seeping through the cracks in the wood planks and through the bottom. A high pitched buzzing filled the air.

“You’re wrong.”

cleared his throat as he sauntered over to her. “The name’s Gabriel.
“Uriel had other duties to attend to and your brother left a couple of hours ago.” Castiel paused as he walked over to the nightstand, grabbing a silver flask resting on top of it and handing it to Dean as he unscrewed the cap. “He was rather… upset.”
The singing stopped. “Come in,” the small voice within the room chirped.
“No.” Judas took a pull from the goatskin. “There’s just so much suffering and pain. Not just among our people, but out in the world. And evil. Real evil. I’ve seen so much of it.” Judas paused. “I used to doubt if Hashem was even there. I didn’t know and I was fine with that because at least then I didn’t have to wonder why He allowed such things. Now I
As soon as the beads touched Sam’s fingers, pain ran through his skin. Searing and throbbing through his hand.
“Because I was his firstborn, but I was nothing like him.” Jesus paused, drumming his fingers against the wine jug and scoffed. “Because I
Sam took a drive over to Saint Alphonsus Church, a Catholic church a few miles away from the motel. Wooden and painted bright white, it looked more like an old Congregationalist or Baptist church than a Catholic one, save for the Virgin Mary grotto out front. Sam walked slowly up the path, his hands shoved into the pockets of his jacket. He hesitated, taking a deep breath before he rang the doorbell to the rectory.
They walked about one hundred feet away from the fence when Sam saw it.  A three-story, sprawling, red-brick building with rows of small arched windows. Many of the window panes were cracked or broken and the brick was covered in layers of graffiti.
Dean scoffed. “I don’t know, Sam, you sure seem poised for it with your whole “trusting Ruby”thing.”
Bobby hung up the phone.
“No. Y-you should go.” Jesus shook his head, his body half slumped. “You’re in enough trouble as it is.”
Claire screamed.
enough.” Dean’s voice cracked.
Sam stumbled out of the arm chair, placing the coffee cup haphazardly on the TV stand before he walked into the bathroom, coming out with a stack of fraying, pink tinted wraps as he walked over to Dean’s bed. A deep breath left Sam’s mouth he checked Dean’s vitals. “How are you feeling?”

“Oh, it’s not
Jesus’s fate.” His words were angry. “And Michael wouldn’t jeopardize his —”
Sam bit her clit.
A question finally broke Dean’s concentration. “You’ve got a strong devotion to The Blessed Mother?”
Jesus gave him a sad smile, patting his shoulder before he headed back into the room. When he sat back down at the table, he took one of the remaining pieces of matzo into his hands. He looked back at Castiel, clearing his throat before he turned his gaze to the apostles.
The mass had reopened his wounds and this time, the bleeding had been worse.  The Eucharist, usually a balm to the pain, barely took the edge off.
Dean stopped at the first open bar he found, parking the Impala and going inside. Dean shuffled himself over to the bar counter.
Jesus grew quiet. After a moment, he nodded. “Join me and Apostles for supper tonight.”
He never forgot those green eyes.

where Lilith is. Once we nab her, we’ll have Lilith in the bag. About time too, we’re getting down to the wire.”
“Huh.” Dean cocked an eyebrow.
It was the exact same guilt he felt during the dream.
At the sight of them, Castiel clutched his head. The last bit of Naomi’s programming faded away.
“No,” James said bluntly, wiping the tears away. “If my brother is going to die, he’s going to die with his family near him.” He glared. “He’s not going to die alone with strangers mocking him.”
Flanked on either side of the door were four demons.
Dean choked, collapsing to the floor again, clawing at his neck. Spots of black crept in from the edges of his vision and he grappled for air. Just as Dean’s eyes started to roll into the back of his head, Sam unclenched his hand. Dean wheezed, sucking in air.
Sam quickly raised his hand, but before he could react, Alastair sent him flying through one of the office’s stained glass windows with a casual wave of his hand. With another, he sent Dean colliding into a bookcase, a stack of books falling on top of him as he landed on the floor.
By sunset, it was worse. The storm in the pit of his stomach grew until Jesus felt he had the whole of the night sky inside him. Millions of stars settled in the space between his heart and his throat. A swirling cloud of light blossomed, expanded all the way to the tips of his fingers. It pounded against his ribcage and pulled tight against his skin, threatening to rip him apart.
“Last time I checked John wasn’t Jewish and Bobby ain’t Jewish either,” Rufus said. “ So turn the TV on kid.”
Silence.
Sam drifted, the fog of the blood in his veins mixing with sated exhaustion. He closed his eyes; listening to Ruby’s quiet, even breathing next to him.
“Oh?” Zachariah cocked an eyebrow “And why is that, Dean?”
Jesus couldn’t understand why anyone would want to ignore her. He could barely pull his gaze from her. Finally, Jesus gestured to the woman, clearing his throat. “That’s your daughter over there, isn’t it?”
?” Sam glared. “Dean would
When Jesus stirred, the angel lifted his gaze, watching him intently as he grabbed the goatskin and handed it to him. “Drink,” he demanded, his voice deep and rough.
James nodded and ran off, retrieving the knife.
They hugged each other.
Castiel cleared his throat. “Israel means ‘he who wrestles with God’. You certainly do that on a regular basis.”
Castiel squinted at him. “Why would Bobby roll a man named Richard?”
Sam responded back quickly:
:: The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness, also referred to as The War Scroll, is one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, a wide range of Jewish religious documents found in the caves at Qumran near in the Dead Sea. Typically thought to be the product of the Essenes, the scroll contains an apocalyptic prophecy of a war between the Sons of Light and the Sons of Darkness. Dating of the document has ranged between the Second Century BCE and the First Century CE.
supposed to be your life, Dean? Sacrificing yourself? Dying a bloody death? For what, a world that can’t be saved? Because that’s how this is gonna end, one way or another.”

“What are you doing?” Castiel asked.
Dean nodded.
“The Son has certain restrictions, Dean.” Castiel pursed his lips. “Unfortunately, that’s one of them.”
Dean paused, blinking at her. “How the hell did you even
“Virgin Mary is talking to her? Is that even possible?” He stared at Dean.
After a while, he fell back to sleep.
“You stabbed me when we first met and you’ve told me to...” Castiel thought for a second. “‘Fuck off’ more than once. You’re much more argumentative. And stubborn. That’s
A smile spread across Ruby’s face as she led Sam back over to the bed. She pushed him down on top of it as she straddled him, grabbing the knife that was still resting on top of it. “Now, where were we?” she whispered as she ran it across her arm. A thick stream of dark red started seeping out of the wound as she held it out to Sam.
“Don’t mention it.” Bobby patted him on the shoulder as he sat down at the table across from Sam, sliding one of the books over.
“Pretty much, yeah.” Dean sighed, his gaze lowering to the floor. “Cas said they were… ‘cleansing’ me of my time downstairs.”
There was a flash of white light. Sudden and brilliant.
“What do you think that was?” Dean scoffed.
“You’ve got one hell of a savior complex, you know that?” Lisa shook her head and sighed. “You’ve gotta save everyone but yourself.” She stood up, taking a step closer to the circle. “You’ve done enough, Dean. Save yourself. Leave this place.”
“Then who did?” Dean scoffed. “God?”
Sam, on the other hand, didn’t move an inch. A grin spread across his face as he watched her walk right into the trap.
Dean heard the singing as soon as he got off the elevator. It echoed through the halls of the hospital ward—sterile and identical to every other ward, aside from badly painted circus animals on the walls—just over the beeping of heart monitors and the sound of televisions playing cartoons. The voice was beautiful—rhythmic, young, hopeful—but very tired, betraying the sickness of the body that it came from.
Dean wanted to punch Sam in the face and scream at him. He wanted to tell Sam to walk right back out the bathroom door and get the hell out of his sight, but he didn’t have the strength to do it. He couldn’t even raise his voice beyond a loud whisper. He didn’t have the time to do it. In a few hours he would be dead and, one way or another, he wasn’t coming back.
“That was
“His name is Sammy,” Mary whispered, almost like it was some kind of awe-inspiring secret. She looked up at Dean and smiled. “You’re gonna be a good big brother for me and Daddy and help us take care of him, right?”
“We’re

“That’s right. You were.” John nodded. He pulled Dean’s hands off of his jacket; his hands were cold against Dean’s wrists. John took a step back from his son and smirked. “And that’s why you’re gonna fail.”
worthy. Your doubt gives you humility.”
“Where did you hear that?” Jesus asked, cocking an eyebrow.
At least twice, Castiel heard Jesus and James fighting. The fights took the form of Jesus ordering James to go back into the city followed by James steadfastly refusing. At first, they were hisses, and then they became shouts.
"Come again?” Bobby blinked.
Dean stood up from the bench, narrowly avoiding the puddle of vomit at his feet, and walked over to bars. He grabbed them, the chain of his cuffs clinking against the steel.
Before long, however, the tributary dried up, and Jesus had ventured far out into the desert. Arid heat blistered his skin, pocking his hands and feet. Even with a scarf wrapped around his head, the sun had burnt him until his lips were cracked and his forehead had peeled away in uneven splotches.

Castiel watched him for a moment. “I could wash you myself if you’d like.” His suggestion was nonchalant, yet sincere.
When he awoke the following morning, he found fresh bread and a full goatskin. He also found a jar of aloe that he used on his sunburns. Castiel, however, was nowhere to be found.
Jesus and James walked in into the synagogue. As they stepped in, James nudged him in the shoulder and gestured up at the woman’s gallery. Their mother was sitting up there with their sister Dinah and the wives of Judah and Simon.
“I need some fresh air.” With that, Sam left the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.
“Shit,” Sam hissed. Without saying another word, he shoved the phone into his pocket as he ran out of the house.
“You know Shabbat starts a couple of hours right?” Rufus deadpanned.
sooner.” Bobby said, frustration lacing his words. “This is the Stigmata.”
He sat there quietly for a second until a female voice broke the silence.
Soon there was a knock on the door, followed by it being opened. Sam was there, his face wrapped in concern as much as curiosity. “Hey… Me and Bobby heard you talking to someone.” Sam slowly made his way into the room. He briefly glanced over at the glass on the nightstand before fixing his gaze on Dean. “Was it Castiel? Did he tell you why this is happening?”
“Is… everything alright?” Miriamne asked. “Your Ima looked rather upset a moment ago.”

The sound of wings flapping wrung out. With it, Castiel was gone.
“Sister Joan-Hubertus,” she stated. “I’m one of the junior Sisters at the convent next door.”
—doing so as quietly as he could manage so he didn’t wake Dean. Looking desperately for a nonexistent hex bag or a trace of sulfur or ectoplasm, anything in the hopes that he could explain away what happened to Dean.
The flask was empty. It had
Dean raised his hands up above his head. He turned slowly to find Jacob and Susan standing behind him, barrels pointed at him. “I’m Dean,” he said with cautious honesty, eyeing the guns. “And your baby is fine.
After she was gone, Dean let out a deep sigh, pulling his sleeves back down before taking a sip of his coffee. “So I’m guessing I’m not what you were expecting.”
, that he shouldn’t have been causing them in the first place.
Jesus' mouth salivated at the thought of them, but his stomach stiffened. “I will.” He nodded. “Thank you, Ima.”
Dean’s body was motionless, save for the trembling. His eyes locked on the sickening grin that spread across Alastair’s face. This wasn’t going to end. Alastair was going to do this to him, over and over again, for as long as it took, until he said “yes”.
Dean blinked. “What? Why?”
They made their way down to the dock, setting up their chairs and baiting their lures. Once they were cast, Bobby reached down and handed Dean a beer.
Castiel raised his eyebrow. “A debt?”
of you. You get in there and you
“I was doing it again, wasn’t I?” Dean chuckled.
Sam was walking out of a pizzeria, pizza box in hand, having just paid a visit to the Rock Port First Lutheran Church, when he noticed a yellow Mustang sitting in the parking lot a few spots away from the Impala. A woman with dark hair was leaning her back against the driver’s side door. She was the first and last person Sam wanted to see. “Ruby…” Sam froze at the sight of her.
She stared at Dean for a second. Then she gasped, a cloud of breath billowing from her mouth. “It’s…
by a demon, he was
Sam took a deep breath. “Hey, Pamela.”
“Dean Winchester, Son of God,” Alastair deadpanned. He sauntered over to Dean. “You’ve
“John’s not my only father.” Dean took a deep breath. “I have
“I made these for you.” Dean held the amulets out to Amelia. “They’ll keep you safe. So will the devil’s trap we painted under the rug in the entranceway.”
Castiel watched him for a long moment. “You have Faith, Jesus. Do you not?” He squinted at him.
Castiel watched as they gave such visions to a man called Saul of Tarsus. They did so because he could write and speak Greek, was a Roman citizen and could travel around the empire and had no problem spreading his ideas among pagans. But most importantly, he never knew Jesus. The angels could fill his head with all manner of ideas that they could never to do to men and women who had known him.
“Why did you do it, Uriel?” Castiel’s voice carried through the sanctuary as he marched down the center aisle. “Why did you try to kill Dean?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel nodded. “I do.”
why… but I don’t have faith. I never really have and I
Dean let out a hitched gasp as his heart stopped. Abrupt. Violent.
Sighing, Bobby closed the slot and walked back upstairs. He went into the kitchen and poured himself a cup of coffee, adding a healthy dash of Bailey's.
Then out of the blackness and calm came a sharp twinge of pain to the left side of his ribcage. It dissipated just as Dean’s eyes opened.
Dean paused, his breath shaking. It was followed by the sound of sniffling and rustling against the speaker
“Tell me what happened, Cas,” Dean demanded, taking a step closer to him.
“Say the word, Dean.” Alastair’s voice was triumphant.
Death himself, riding a white stallion and dressed in a long black toga, came to reap Jesus. Soon after, the ground quaked. The dead rose and walked out of their tombs and ossuaries. The sky began to bleed.
Anna paused, thinking for a long moment. “Demons didn't kill those angels. If they did, we would have known it.” She took a couple of steps down the sidewalk before she stopped and turned back around. “Where was Uriel stationed this morning?” Her face was serious and her voice leading. “When was the last time you saw him?”
“I don’t mean to be rude, but how did you cut up your forehead? Those look like pretty nasty scars.”
“Yeah.” Dean nodded. “Positive. Thanks for the ride.”
A few days later, Dean found refuge in a truck stop diner on I-44, just past Joplin, Missouri. The owner, Phil, had to catch Dean before he collapsed in the middle of the candy aisle from a spiking fever. He gave Dean a piping hot bowl of fresh chicken noodle soup and two grilled cheese sandwiches on the house and let Dean use their shower facilities. He even let Dean sleep for a couple of hours on the couch in his office.
“You guys okay?”  Dean asked.
“Sam!” he called out again.
Castiel stared at the demon’s corpse for a moment before he followed Anna.  “What was that demon talking about? What won’t Jesus have the stomach for?” he asked.
Jesus' father followed her three years later.
“Well, given your
Dean stood in the aisle for a moment, giving the church a final glance before he flung his duffle bag over his shoulder and walked back out into the winter chill. Dean could see the morning sun rising to the east, just above the horizon. He walked towards it, his tired eyes squinting against the light.
Alastair’s eyes locked on the blood that started to creep down Dean’s forehead and chuckled, pulling the hat off of Dean’s head, tossing it across the room. “Heaven actually thinks they can fix you with those wounds. But after all you did downstairs, after everything
He stopped and ran his wet hands down his face before gripping them around the side of the sink, his gaze fixed on his reflection. “Your name is

Jesus stared down at the red liquid on his hand for a long moment. He took a deep shaken breath. “So, Castiel, what I do
Instinctively, Dean placed his hand under the old T-shirt and flannel he was wearing and ran his fingers against the left side of his ribcage, expecting there to be gash, but there was none. Only a thick line of raised tissue.
“No. It’s you,” Judas said sarcastically as he stepped closer to him. “I—I can see your halo.”
:: The first Sunday after Easter, also called the Octave of Easter, is referred to in Eastern Orthodox Churches as Thomas Sunday, referring to the gospel passage from the Gospel of John that is read on that Sunday of Jesus appearing to Apostles one week after the resurrection with Thomas present.
“You’re demon hunters, aren’t you?” Jesus asked.
Dean let go of the bars and pulled his jacket sleeves up enough to expose the wrists. They weren’t marked by open wounds as they had been in the last moment Dean could remember, as they
“Halloween, 1991.” Dean sighed putting the scroll down. “Me and Sam were Batman and Superman. I dared him to try to fly off one of your storage sheds. He broke his arm and I took him to the hospital on the bars of this old lime green schwinn stingray you-”
you.”
Castiel sighed, stepping just beyond the threshold of the room.
“I know,” Sam said bluntly.
Quietly, Dean ducked into the bathroom and wrapped bandages around his torso, forehead, wrists, and ankles. He pulled a black beanie over his hair before leaving the store, hoping the ache would go away, or at the very least, not get any worse.
wounds.” There was a weight and reverence to Castiel’s words.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “Not if I have any say in it.”
Shavuot had been always been difficult for him. It had been Sarah’s favorite festival, the last one his sister had attended before she died, a month before her seventh birthday.
As Sam carried him out to the Impala, Dean caught sight of a half wiped away streak of blood on Sam’s face and hand.
“You’ll be welcomed into the tribe.”
She was wet.
Dean sat up, turning in his circle of salt to see John leaning against one of the rotten pews. He moved closer and Dean fought the urge to stand up straight.
Dean pulled out of the bar parking lot. He made his way aimlessly through empty roads lined by fields of corn and farmhouses for what felt like hours until he came across a long stretch of an empty field. On the side of the road was a white cross made out of plywood and stuck in the ground with a wooden spike. Inside the cross in the shape of it were words in big red letters.
“So?” the voice sighed out. “No dice on your brother, I’m guessing?”
universal?”
Dean’s eyes grew wide. “Sam! Don’t!”
Dean nodded. “Thanks, Cas.” A weary smile spread across his face as he gave Castiel a pat on the shoulder.
soul. That aside, you’re not here so Michael can get consent from you. It’s only a matter of time before you say yes to him anyway. No, I’m here for another reason.”
Dean froze at the touch, holding his breath. Rigid and tense.
“Pretty much. It’s an ‘As Above, so Below’ kinda thing.” Dean gestured with his hand, pointing up to the sky and down to the ground.
Dean picked the tree back up, groaning. “Jesus this fucking thing is heavy.”
worthy, Dean,” Castiel insisted, watching Dean. “Even if you bearing the same soul weren’t the case, you
As far as Dean knew, last year’s Christmas was going to be his
One table being run by a young woman had Christian Rock CDs, T-shirts, religious tracts, and Bibles with edgy looking covers stacked on top of it. Dean stopped at the table briefly, picking up one of the CDs and looking at it inquisitively.
With the exception of an occasional barn or unlocked shed, shelter had been a rare commodity the last two weeks. More often than not, Dean had found himself curling up beneath an overpass or behind a dumpster in an alleyway.

“It’s late,” Castiel murmured, walking over to him. “Shouldn’t you be sleeping?”
have been. In fact, the body hadn’t even paled.
His eyes flickered black.
Nothing came.
A vicious smirk spread across Ruby’s lips.
“So strangers?” James said annoyed. “Men you don’t even know?”
“What’s wrong?” Jesus asked, furrowing his brow in concern. He watched her carefully. It was then that he noticed the slight shake of her hands and the various signs of trauma her body bore, her right hand scarred by burn marks, a scar on her brow, each one a different age.
Dean cracked open his eyes to find Sam squatting on the sleeping bag. He was holding Dean’s torso upright, his hands digging into Dean’s shoulders.
The video followed Sam, jumping in front of him.
Castiel stopped his blade.
“No. After I came out of the water, it stopped. I can… understand their words now,” Jesus took a deep breath as he looked over at the synagogue, watching as the other men filed into it. He turned his gaze back to James, pursing his lips. “Maybe I’ll have you speak for me instead, like Aaron did for Moses.”
“It’s the only way to insure that they don’t return.” Simon shrugged. “But when we bury our own fallen, we don’t burn them on pyres like the pagan hunters do. We bury their bodies inside of tombs. We just drape a tallit over the burial wrappings and wash the entrance of the tomb with salt water. An easy feat since we live near the Dead Sea.” He took a sip of his wine. “That’s one of the many ways we’re different from pagan hunters.”
Jesus looked at him and nodded.
the heat. It suffocated it. Snuffing it out like dirt kicked onto a fire’s embers.
He thrust his sword, but Uriel managed to dodge it, knocking it out of his hand as he pinned Castiel against the back wall of the stage, just below the choir loft.
, a fact that Dean could never seem to recognize, never wanted to recognize. Sam watched Dean look at his wounds, look at his role as Messiah, with apathy and annoyance at best, and sacrilege and fear at worst. He watched Dean hurl blasphemies at people who called him “Lord” and scoff at the idea of God being his Father.
was really talking about.”
These were mannerisms Castiel had once known well, but they had been wiped from his memory. Taken. Though Castiel wanted to find comfort in seeing these gestures again, watching Dean perform them brought him nothing but sadness. They were a shadow, a vestige of someone long gone. A reminder of Castiel’s own failings.
Bobby walked back into the kitchen, a bottle of whiskey and two low ball glasses in his hands.
blood relationship. Most of the time, when we reincarnated- or whatever- something would be off. Like...we’d be brothers but I’d be younger and he’d be older or we’d be cousins. At least once we were sisters which- apparently- wasn’t close enough.  But a lotta times we weren’t even related.”
Dean lay on the cot. Still and lifeless.
“Only when I heal am I ever really sure of it.” Jesus paused, taking a sip. “But the angels keep telling me that I can only heal those who need it. That some are more deserving of it than others.” Annoyance filled his voice. “Now they’re telling me to stop healing and focus solely on stopping Lucifer. They say that there are bigger concerns now than a few cripples and lepers.”
A church.
like our cousin. A messenger of Hashem pulled you from the desert.” He glanced up to the sky. “Heaven is watching over you.  It will watch over us.”
“I’ve had lots of practice,” Sister Joan said simply. She walked over to the counter to grab a first aid kit and a glass of water.
The power seemed to amplify the sounds around him, from the softest whisper of wind against the wings of a locust to the very movement of the constellations. He heard it all. The sounds pounded against his skull, a constant tick against his consciousness.
:: Apparitions of the Virgin Mary are common in Catholic lore. Most often, she said to appear to children. The two most well-known examples are Fatima Portugal from 1917 where she is believed to have been seen by three children, Lúcia Santos and Francisco and Jacinta Marto, and Lourdes France in 1858 where she is believed to been seen by Bernadette Soubirous.
“He’s back in the motel room drying out,” Sam lied. “He took off last night, saying he needed a break from the whole Jesus Christ Superstar thing.”

“Pepperoni and hamburger.” Sam nodded hopefully, opening the pizza box, sliding it closer to Dean.
Sam froze at the touch, his eyes going wide with shock. “D— Dean?”
Sam sighed. “You’ve been given the power to
A streak of pride run through him at the sight of it.
“The church doesn’t
James nodded in understanding. He turned his gaze over to Jesus. “So, what are we going to do?” he asked, concerned. “We can’t afford to buy more.”
“Gotcha.” Dean saluted as he made his way back to the front door, closing it behind him. He made his way down the steps and over to the Impala, climbing into the driver’s seat. Starting the car, he turned the radio on.
“Bobby, We don’t -”
“They did, huh?” He smiled at her sarcastically.
“No.” Miriamne shook her head. “I want to help.”
Sam didn’t say anything as he slammed the door behind him. He made it only as far as the bar next to the hotel where he sat down and texted Ruby. Six drinks, fifty dollars, and no reply later, Sam staggered back into the hotel room where he found Dean passed out cold on top of the covers. An empty Jim Beam bottle lay on its side, a small wet spot staining the bed spread. As quietly as he could manage, Sam pulled the covers over his brother and made his way into the bathroom, closing the door behind him.
said he couldn’t smell anything.
Mary froze.
“A mega church?” Sam scoffed as he looked at Dean, laying on his bed and watching Die Hard on the hotel room’s television with a glass of whiskey in his hand. “
Sam scrunched his eyebrows. “What do you mean ‘he’s not decomposing?’”
because it’s my job to know.” He shrugged. “Also, the paint is blue. Ain't exactly rocket science to figure that one out.” He glanced over at the neatly painted squares on the nursery wall. “I’d go with the Carolina Blue.” he nodded, a grin quirking his lips.
Jesus looked up at him, his eyes staring at him with certainty. “We’ll see each other again. You know that.”
certainly—“
Bobby nodded, tossing a pack of black waxed thread onto the table.
. The old leather smell of the Impala’s cabin gave way to the stench of bodily fluids and dirt. It was followed by a feeling of rope burn around his forearms and the pointed pressure of cold iron against the flesh and tendons of his inner right wrist.
:: All four canonical gospels depict Jesus as healing the blind, often on multiple occasions. The Healing of A Blind Man Near Jericho occurs in all three of Synoptic Gospels, though the account varies slightly between the three. The Gospel of Mark gives the man a name ("Bartimaeus") while The Gospel of Luke does not. In The Gospel of Matthew, Jesus heals two blind men, also unnamed. The Gospel of John depicts Jesus healing a man born blind.
, I feel better keeping it covered.”
Castiel paused for a moment as he glanced around the church. “We need to talk, Dean.” His voice was serious.
Sam glared at him. “Well, if you’re not going to eat can I at least change your bandages?”
Sam raised his hand. The wooden doors swung open, revealing an empty chapel. The only thing left inside was a marble altar.
Sam tightened his grip, keeping their hands clasped.
Pamala’s voice turned serious.
“No!” Dean pulled himself free from Castiel’s grip. “I can’t leave him, Cas!
“Have what?” Dean cocked any brow.
He was
With that, Jesus and James walked away from the house. They made their way to the small inn that their family was staying in during the wedding. Instead of staying the night, they just grabbed their bags and left, making their way east to the Sea Galilee.
He shook his head, trying to dispel the sound of his own screams.

The rabbi watched Jesus for a second. He nodded, cautiously. “Countless other young men have claimed the same. You’re just old enough to remember Judah of Gamla’s revolt and how much bloodshed
Dean swallowed hard. “And did they?”
The pounding of a hammer on nail was no different and Dean did his best to ignore it. He tried to focus his mind on other thoughts. Other dreams. The sweet humming of his mom’s voice as her fingers lovingly stroked his hair while he rested his head against her swollen belly. The opening acoustic guitar chords of “Ramble On”—rhythmic and fast, but gentle—as it bellowed through Baby’s cabin just above the roar of her engine. The stillness of a warm summer night where the only sound he could hear, apart from the small talk he and Sam made around sips of beer, was the chirping of crickets.
Sam picked the bag up and put it back into his pocket. “I need to find a way to fix him. Do you know of any manuscripts, spells, herbs or amulets—
“You son of a bitch,” Dean hissed, his lip swollen and bleeding.
“Sam,” Dean swallowed. “Please, tell me you didn’t do what I
:: Shavuot, also called the Feast of Weeks and Pentecost, is a Jewish festival that commemorates God giving the Torah to Moses.  It is one of Three Pilgrimage Festivals, along with Passover and Sukkot, when the ancient Jewish people were commanded to visit the Temple in Jerusalem. After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, such requirements were no longer mandatory.
Dean decided to spend the holiday distracted by rum-spiked eggnog and the twenty-four-hour marathon of
A sad smile spread across Dean’s face as he wrapped his fingers around the steering wheel. This was the first time in a week he had sat in the Impala’s—No. In
Ruby paused. “Lilith. We’re getting close to finding her.”
Dean glanced over at the child again. The boy was whispering something to the pastor, both their eyes landing on Dean briefly before the pastor nodded and sat back in his chair. Dean swallowed hard. “If we leave now the kid and the rest of the congregation are gonna go postal,” Dean rasped. “We’ll wait until it’s over and then haul ass outta here.”
“Faith is always something that came easily to me. I have it not in spite of everything I’ve seen, but because of it. The way I see it, you can’t have darkness without light. I’ve seen enough darkness to believe that the light is out there.” She shrugged.
Jesus didn’t say anything. He looked at Castiel. “Just promise me you won’t try to stop it.”
Amelia shook her head. “No. It’s-it’s fine.” Her voice shook. “Just-just tell Jimmy I’m sorry.”
Dean swallowed. “Well, I was in the neighborhood so I figured I’d stop by.”
Dean stopped, cocking an eyebrow at her. “

“I’m already thirty.” Jesus glared, pulling his arm away.
“Well.”  Dean paused. Thinking. What he wanted to say, he couldn’t. “Well about half a year ago I found out that I have Jewish ancestry. Distant Jewish ancestry. It’s been a struggle for me to come terms with that. Ya know? I think the only way I can come to terms with it is if I…” Dean paused. “Embrace it. On my own terms.”
“Yeah, I’ll be fine. It just hurts like a bitch.”
, Dean.
Just as he heard feet running up the stairs, The Silence came.
Then he heard the sound of a woman screaming. It echoed off in the distance, down one of the dark corridors.
Dean walked over to her and gently placed a hand on top of her head. She gasped, lifting her head back up. Tears filled her eyes quickly as she started to sob.
Sam looked down at the beads and glared at them.
“Sam I know this ain’t easy for you, but this is just how it is.  There’s nothing we can do about it.”

Reluctantly, Bobby shook his head. “We don’t. All we can do is deal with this as best we can.”
