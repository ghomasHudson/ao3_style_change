Tony and Clint lined up again. Clint swung at him and Tony managed to block it. Clint grabbed the arm he had extended to do so and flipped to the ground.
“Quit ogling Assmerica the Beautiful over there and pay attention.  You were actually improving in the two minutes you were trying.”
“You’re adorable!” she said as he handed her the drink.  Steve blushed. “And I’ve gotta run I have a meeting.  Thanks Steve!” She said before heading to the door and Steve was left wondering when they had gotten on a first name basis.
“Umm?” Steve said watching the exchange with confusion.  They stopped and both turned their attention to him.  He contemplated telling them for a moment but decided against it.
“Oh. Um, Hi.” Steve froze and turned around. His face was flushed and Tony knew it wasn’t from the exercise. He stepped away from the bag and wrung his hands. “Look Tony, I’m sorry… I really… I know...” Steve was stumbling over and mincing his words. He had a whole lot he didn’t know how to say.
Natasha half led half pushed Bruce over to one corner of the mats.  She began showing him how to punch.  “Not like that, align your wrist.  If you go in with it bent you’ll break it; if you break it you’ll hulk out.”
“That doesn’t sound nearly as cool.  And don’t dodge the question.” Tony could see that Steve was stumped.
“Disturbance in Chinatown. High population density, Citizens at risk. Avengers Presence requested.  Hawkeye is en route.” Steve stood up and pushed his plate of eggs toward Bruce.
“I am ready to come out, but I realize that this involves you to given that... well... um... given that we are involved, and I’d like you help and support in this.” Tony didn’t immediately say anything, so Steve continued. “And I’m still not super good at this whole modern thing so I don’t really know where to start or what to do.  I’d like your help.” He made himself stop talking then so it didn’t appear that it was rambling.  He held Tony’s gaze.
“The contest you suggest is hardly fair Stark.” Thor said. “Lady Natasha, would you do me the honor of allowing me to fight as your champion.” Thor’s contemplative mood seemed to have evaporated as he again became the life of the party.
Tony slunk in to the training room ten minutes late.  He was deeply offended by how bright eyed and pleased to be there the rest of them looked.  Except for Bruce, he was standing off to the side looking apprehensive.   Tony stood beside him and tried to angle himself so that he was hiding from the rest of the group.
Tony had known that Steve would decide to come out the second Bruce had said it would be good if he did.  He didn’t particularly disagree with Bruce, but he also would have never said anything about it.  He already had a PR strategy laid out before Steve had come down earlier.  He had just said he needed to work because he needed time to think, about what this would mean for him, about what it would mean for Steve.
The next afternoon Tony walked into the living room and tossed a garment bag on to Steve’s head.  “Put that on.” He carried on to the kitchen and Steve hear the familiar sounds of the overburdened coffee maker seeing to the needs of its most frequent customer.
“Given the amount of adjusting we are talking about you are doing admirably.”  Tony snatched the pickle.  “But that’s sad talk. Tell me what’s your favorite thing about the future?”
“You need to find a better outlet.” Tony said.  He was vaguely aware that he was still holding Steve’s hand, holding pressure he told himself. “What if we get called in five minutes and you get it a bad situation because you can’t throw a punch.”
“I don’t know.” Bruce pointed to one of the bubble like anomalies that flickered in and out of existence. “It’s not radiation.”  Steve opened the fridge and pulled out the egg carton and a package of sausage. Bruce was still staring at the chart. Tony was using his distracted state to slowly inch his coffee away from him.  Steve put the coffee pot on and broke all eighteen eggs in to a frying pan one by one.
“Nonsense, I just left the gala, it's like two,” Tony said, and he felt oh so very tired. Too tired to worry about what Steve was saying. Steve who was so warm. Steve who was so strong.  He gave up trying to stand all together and collapsed into Steve, who caught him because of course, he did. Tony didn’t worry about a thing after that.
“Jarvis, apply vectors.” Tony said. He gestured towards the graph and was pleased to see it shift and jump again.  Jarvis understood the game he was playing perfectly and could execute even the most nonsensical command better than fuckit.js.
I'll try to get one more chapter up before Thanksgiving. This keeps getting longer despite my best efforts. (sorry, not sorry.)  I might also be making some minor edits in chapter one for continuity purposes (probably tomorrow).  Thanks for all of your lovely comments.
“Yeah, floor, everyone has a floor.” Tony said as if it was the most normal thing in the world. The elevator accelerated upwards without prompting and numbers flew by on the control panel. It stopped at floor 60 “My labs on 59 if you ever need to find me.” Tony said. He ushered Steve out of the elevator.
“We’ll need a strategy,” Tony turned back to his tablet.  Give me a few hours to make some arrangements.  “Talk about it over dinner tonight?” He glanced back up at Steve to see him nod.
He stumbled into the elevator even though he didn’t really remember getting there and slapped the panel. When the door opened, he took a few steps down the hall before he realized he was in the common area instead of his own floor.
“Well, that’s not right...” He mumbled. He spun around and ran into a very solid figure. For a second, he just let himself rest there against the firm warmth of…
The afternoon had been wonderful.  Tony had made him laugh more than he had since before the war.  For an hour or two he hadn’t felt out of place.
“You swore.” Tony giggled, “You can't swear you’re a superhero” but then did what he was told. The second Steve took the now empty glass from him had he flopped back on to the couch. Steve repositioned him to his side.  He told Jarvis to let him know if Tony was having any trouble and went into the kitchen to make breakfast. Even though he knew Jarvis was watching he couldn’t help but check in every few minutes. After he ate, he settled on to the chair across from where Tony slept with a book and waited for him to wake up.
“It doesn’t seem like I have.” Steve said with a sad smile.  He’d started picking at his hand again.   They finished the ride to the tower in silence.
“What does Steve like to do, like, in his free time?”  He asked. He could have stopped there and they probably would have answered but he charged forward. “Sheild sent over his stuff and its literally like a half full shoe box and he has a whole floor and that’s just fucking depressing, and I don’t want it to be all empty when he gets here which is in less than a week.” He took a breath but now Natasha was doing that thing were she just raised her eyebrow and waited for him to say more. “I just want him to feel at home?” he added.
Steve was again at the punching bag stringing together hit after hit.  Tony took a moment to sip at his steaming drink and admire the view.  Steve was wearing a tank top that left every twitch of his shoulder muscles visible.
“We agreed it would be a good thing Tony.  You can bring Steve up to speed on the modern world and you might not forget to eat for days at a time while I’m away on business.” Pepper said in her CEO voice.  Tony didn’t like that voice.  It meant resistance was futile.
The refrigerator in the common kitchen was extremely large with four doors in total.  Steve spent a minute rummaging through it before finding eggs, milk, and bacon.
“I didn’t want to stick around for the cameras.” Clint said with his mouth full of thread as he tied off another stitch. “That’s Starks job.”
“So…” Pepper said as he trudged his way through endless lines requiring his initials. “I had a meeting with Fury this morning.”
“I brought you breakfast,” Steve said. He set down the plate and mug and the noise finally drew Tony’s attention from, well, the rest of it.
Steve ran.  He panicked and sprinted through the halls of the tower. The door to his apartment nearly ripped off its hinges and slammed shut with a loud crack.  He sunk into the couch and began to hyperventilate.  He was frightened of his own actions, certain he had ruined everything.    He wanted to do it again and that scared him more.  His throat constricted as nausea set in.  He made it to the sink just in time to heave up half of what he had eaten.  When his stomach finally calmed he sunk on to the cool hardwood floor and leaned his head back against the wall. He felt like a wreck.  A small voice in his head reminded him that Tony had no problem sleeping with men but that thought scared him more than anything else.
“Steve.” Tony was right next to him but he didn’t respond.  “Steve!” The man’s rhythm faltered momentarily but he shook his head and ducked in to another hard hitting punch.  Sweat beaded on Steve’s forehead, blood dripped on to the floor.  His knuckles were split, bloody and swollen.  His shirt was ruined from the spatter.  Tony grabbed Steve’s arm and was almost thrown forward when he tried to throw the next punch.  Tony yelped as his are almost exited the socket and Steve finally took notice. He stood frozen in place looking at his torn up hands not with horror as Tony would expect but resignation.
“Shit, Steve.” Tony said.  He noticed Steve was still shivering. “Jarvis will ya turn the heat up?” The room got warmer and Tony began to doze off.
Months passed, and Stark Tower went back up. It was Avengers Tower now he supposed.  He put out an invite for the team to come back and they all showed up within the week, except for Steve.  He wrote Tony a letter.
Opposite the door to the study, there was another door which Steve pushed open hesitantly, afraid of what lavish things might lay behind it. While the bathroom was extremely decadent, to the point that Steve was a little concerned, the bedroom, though huge was simply furnished and a single box sat on the bed.
Tony was pleasantly drunk.  It was the kind of drunk where he probably shouldn’t drive but most people wouldn’t notice a difference in a conversation. It was the kind of drunk where doing higher math was not pleasant.
“Thank you Jarvis.”  Pepper smiled at the ceiling.  Tony smashed his head against the table again and flicked off the nearest of Jarvis’s optical sensors.
“Jarvis, go ahead and project the data in the room.  Color-code the frequencies and set the communicator as origin.”  The room lit up with Technicolor waves that were polluted by little bubbles of error that appeared at random like popping popcorn.
Tony kissed Steve.  It was a brief kiss, only a few seconds, but Steve could taste a hint of the wine they had drank at dinner as Tony’s tongue briefly brushed his.  Steve’s fingers brushed Tony’s.  He held on to Tony’s hand as he pulled away.  “Goodnight Steve.” Tony walked away down the hall.  He looked back with a smile before he turned the corner.
“Pepper left.” Tony hung his head and ran his hand through his hair.  The bottle dangled loosely from his other hand.  “We’re done.” His voice cracked on the last word.
“I know he’s entitled to his opinion but that doesn’t mean I have to sit there and listen to it.” Steve was still visibly struggling to calm down. “And I’m not hungry.” He paced back and forth in the hall.  “I’m going to go hit the gym.” He tried to walk toward the elevator but Tony got in his way.
Steve smiled at him as they got out of the car and that was enough to make up Tony’s mind.  They stepped in to the elevator.
By the third morning Steve was expecting some beautiful woman with last night’s makeup smudged on her face to come waltzing into the kitchen.  Instead a man in boxers and a bathrobe quietly padded in and began shuffling through the refrigerator.  The man poured two cups of coffee and then walked back out of the room.  Steve tried to go back to reading the paper but he was too distracted contemplating that Tony Stark appeared to like men as well as women.
“Are you alright with me reading this?”  Tony asked.  He held the file back out to Steve. Steve looked at it cautiously.
“Popular approval still isn’t high enough that it’s no big deal.” Tony traced the seam of Steve’s shirt down his shoulder with his hand.
“You have exceeded you limit of seven cups for the day Master Stark, I overrode you request as per prior instructions.” Jarvis said. Tony groaned and pressed his forehead against the workbench.
“Look, we have a good thing going here where we do friend like things for each other on a weekly basis. Let’s not ruin that with you judging my lifestyle decisions.” Tony said.  He was eyeing Steve suspiciously.
The elevator dinged and opened.  Steve considered hitting the button to go back upstairs but Natasha was up there, and she had made it explicitly clear that he wasn’t allowed back up until he had ‘dealt with his shit.’  He paused by the doorway to decide exactly what he was going to say.   His hands shook as he pushed the door open.
“Yeah” the woman said. “The talking ceiling called me a cab.” Then she wandered down the hall without saying any more.
“I can’t imagine this is and worse than the war.” Tony said. “I know it’s a steep learning curve, but you are doing well.  You’ll get the hang of it.”
“That sounds like some bullshit Jarvis,” Tony said.  He set down his tablet and walked over to Steve.  “How are you today?” He grabbed one of Steve’s hands with his and kissed the tip of his shoulder.  He had been doing things like that all week. Sometimes it took Steve by surprise.  He had always wanted something like this but never had imagined it would happen.  He kissed Tony on the top of the head and the stepped back, so he could see his face.
As soon as he could he excused himself and went to go help at the triage station, He worked there until midnight but still didn’t find anyone with the same mark as his.  At 12:01 he claimed exhaustion and walked out into the wreckage of midtown New York.
Tony pointed the missile up into the void and he knew he had to go with it, He told Jarvis to call Pepper because she was all he had.  The phone call displayed the date and time code and he remembered, today was supposed to be the day. He felt guilt more than sadness, He was sure many people’s arms would be blank after today, all people he couldn’t save.  He figured it was for the best though; that it was him up here and not someone else. As the darkness closed in he told himself his soulmate would be better off this way, without him to put them in danger.  He told himself that he was keeping them safe by doing this, and that was all he could do.
“Right.” Tony said. A little notebook a few tool boxes over caught his eye. Tony never wrote things by hand, Pepper must have brought it in at some point.  He snatched it up and opened it. A few notes were neatly written on the first page in such short hand he couldn’t understand it, definitely Pepper’s.  Otherwise it was blank.  He ripped out the page gracelessly and chucked the book at Steve. “If you don’t get something write it down, that way you aren’t interrupting conversation. Once you pile up a few we can go over them if ya want.”
“Good to be back.” Steve tried to mean it, but every inch of the tower was alien to him except maybe they newspaper in Bruce’s hand. Bruce gave him a knowing smile.
Steve slipped his jacket off and then unsnapped the cuff around his mark. He was starting to get a tan line which made the ink stand out all the more. The marks that once filled him with hope now made him feel nauseous, he told himself he covered it so that he didn't have to look at it. That it would help him forget, but it had weighed on his mind every second of his trip.  He knew that why he really wore it was he didn't want everyone to know that he was alone, incomplete, and always would be.
“I was thinking…. That…well maybe..”  Suddenly he found himself unable to speak because Steve was kissing him.
“If you don’t mind my saying so Sir, this doesn’t seem very scientific.” Jarvis said.  Tony could almost feel the A.I. looking disapprovingly at the scotch.  He was trying to do better.  He’d finally patched the whole in his chest and had promised Pepper that he was done with everything that had come with it.  She’d almost walked out on him when he’d built Mark XLIII but he had talked her down; promised it was the only one, for emergencies only.  He meant it.  The problem was the alcohol had been there before Afghanistan and the need for it had stayed with him like a limb.
Why some people got them later than others wasn’t fully understood, but the prevailing theory was that a formative event had to occur to set the person on a path to meet their soul mate before the mark would appear.  Steve’s appeared the day after his mother died. For just a moment he was excited when it prickled into existence on his arm until he saw the date. May 3
“I’m doing alright.” Tony said.  “Having a little argument with science and a bigger argument with my robots over my coffee intake, but these things tend to work themselves out.”  He walked toward the window where Steve was looking out.  As he approached a notification popped up on the window pane.  Steve took a step back in surprise.  Tony took a quick look at it and then tossed it away with a swipe of his hand.
“Here’s to eighty more years.” He said.  Bucky raised his hand as if making a toast and then ran off to find books on Russia.
Steve looked him dead in the eye and said, “I am bisexual, I am attracted to both men and women, and I am ready to come out.” He seemed out of breath after he said it.
Tony sighed.  “I thought you might say that.”  He took Steve’s other hand in his. “I’ll support whatever you want to do but there is something I want you to see first. He let go of one of Steve’s hands and tapped his tablet to turn it on he then made some gesture that Steve didn’t fully understand or fully bother to process because Tony hesitated for a moment before he did it and grimaced before he continued. Steve squeezed his hand and then turned his attention to the image that was projected in the room.
Tony as a rule either wore nothing more than a band shirt and jeans or nothing less than a designer suit.  There was no in between.  This meant that for an outing such as this one Tony had the choice of either being over dressed or looking like an asshole.  Pepper must finally be rubbing off on him because he was picturing the tabloid headlines from each one. He went with the designer suit, although the deciding factor had been the face he imagined Steve making if he showed up otherwise.
“You too?” he asked.  Steve nodded though he felt no excitement. He began to roll his sleeve back down “C’mon Stevie! Bucky said.  It can’t be as bad as mine.” He flashed Steve his mark.  Whatever was on his wrist wasn’t in English. “I have no idea what it says.” He grabbed Steve’s arm and looked at it for a minute slightly stumped.
“It contains your orders and advisements for this case.” He said repeating Fury’s exact words to him.  Tony sighed.
“The war was hell.” Steve said. “But it was where I was supposed to be.  It was my fight.”  Steve shivered. “I didn’t lose consciousness when the plane hit the water.” His jaw worked up and down as he looked anywhere but Tony’s face.  “I don’t know how long it was.  A few hours maybe.  Haven’t felt warm since.”
Steve reached in to his duffel bag and pulled out a manila folder. In black print on the front cover were the words STEVE ROGERS: REEDUCATION a large red stamp under it marked it as S.H.E.I.L.D. classified level four.
People in the twenty first century were either bitter or busy, often both.  After the battle when he walked in to S.H.E.I.L.D. Head Quarters everyone stood and applauded as he passed.  Those in reach had patted him on the back and it had almost felt like a homecoming.
Tony knew that they needed him but it was painfully clear that Steve shouldn’t have been in the field in New York that he shouldn’t be cleared for duty now, but he was.  Tony knew he didn’t have room to talk, but he didn’t have people he answered to, people who made him do the things he did; except for Pepper, but she sat squarely in the anti-avenging corner these days.
Steve put his phone in his pocket and headed toward the elevator. He pressed the button for the common area as the doors slid closed.
“Here we are.” He said.  “The door only opens with your permission emergencies aside. And um, I’ll be down in the common area if you need me.”
“The Towers visual display systems are a combination of Vector based projection and nano-fiber optics; resulting in a comprehensive and interactive 3d display system, Captain.”  At Jarvis’s voice ringing through the room Steve jumped and firmly grabbed his shield.  He looked around trying to find the source of the voice. Tony had to admit that it amused him a little bit.
Tony was sitting on the couch that was tucked in the far corner of the lab looking at an expanded view of the Ironman helmet. When he saw Steve he swiped it away.
“Combat training room two, sir.”  Tony tucked the letter into his back pocket and headed to the elevators.
He threw his shield over his shoulder wondering exactly Tony had in mind for transport.  When he ran on to the roof Tony was already waiting.
Steve was staring at the fridge trying to decide whether he wanted orange or apple juice when he heard the sound of heels down the hall. Pepper stopped when she saw him in the kitchen.
Tony knew there were worse things than being the keynote speaker at a charity gala, but he still hated it. The schmoozing, the fake laughter, the happy couples with their soul marks bare on their arms letting everyone know they were living their best lives.  It was worse now that he knew that would never be him, now that he knew he had actually cared about t way more than he had ever let himself acknowledge.
“Hey, um, Cap? Last time we met I was kind of a jerk and well you didn’t deserve that.” Tony said in one giant huff of a breath.  His eyes were focused on the ground at Steve’s feet like a five year old being reprimanded for stealing from a candy shop.
There was a message on his phone, which he still didn’t know how to use from Natasha.  All it contained was an address and the word debrief.
“How does that work?” Steve asked.  He cautiously placed his hand against the window. Tony was about to answer but Jarvis beat him to it.
Tony turned a dial simply for the purpose of making the graph suddenly flare and jump, and Steve with it.
“I’m so sorry” Steve said.  He felt like he was supposed to offer something more in the situation. He put a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“You know there was med Staff on the scene.” Bruce looked at Clint’s sloppy stitches with disapproval.
Jarvis had dimmed the lights during the encounter. Tony watched Steve trace the wrinkles on his shirt for a while.  Steve’s eyelids began to hover half closed.  Each time he blinked his eyelashes rested against his cheek a little longer. They stayed closed for a little while before Steve jolted himself awake.
In the back of his head he knew this was his first charity gala since the incident since he missed his soul day, and the first time he had drank since then, and he was sure Pepper was aware of it too with how closely she was watching him.  He was sure she was trying to be subtle but he noticed all the same.  At his fifth,
Clint, despite threats, did not burn the bacon.  Steve was clearing the dishes when a voice he didn’t recognize spoke up from the door.
He found a bike abandoned on the street still mostly intact—one of the handles was a little bent and began a trip across town to the location.  The blocks blurred by as he pedaled the bike beyond any speed it was meant to go. At some point, as he felt tears begin to roll down his cheeks, he had made it all this way, all this time, just to miss it. He knew he couldn’t have done anything differently, the world had needed him; he had saved the world. They had won. So why did it feel like he had lost?
Tony hated Soul Marks.  They were the least efficient system possible.  The date to find his one true love marked on his arm.  Which would be fine and semi-straightforward, except sometimes they changed, and no one knew why. It drove some people crazy.  Checking to see if their every decision brought them closer to or further away from their soul mate.
“I’m doing well.” Steve said, but the smile he gave was weak.  “Yourself?” He wandered to the window and looked down on to the street that was a half mile below. His fingers brushed the glass.  He flinched a little when it lit up.
“Jarvis, go ahead and activate the press blitz protocol,” Tony said.  Patch me through if I need to make any calls in person.”
As he was riding back to his lab in the elevator, he told Jarvis to order Clint ‘the biggest fucking crystal he could get in the city.’ And Natasha ‘more chocolate than she could ever eat.’
Tony would write him back via text message.  Soon a small pile of postcards cluttered his desk and If anyone looked at his text log they wouldn’t have been able to make sense of it.
“He likes to read,” Clint said sparing him from further babbling “And there are, like, 70 years of books he’s missed out on. Definitely get him Harry Potter.
“Yeah, it was close though.”  Steve slipped his fingers around Tony’s wrist and pulled their hands towards his cheek.  He gently placed kisses on each of Tony’s knucklebones before letting their hands fall to their laps clasped.
This was worse.  He couldn’t move but he could feel the water icing over in the darkness. Each crystal that formed seemed to stab.  He knew it must have gone on for hours measuring time by the beat of his pulse the only thing audible aside from the occasional groan of the hull and the sound of his lungs once again rattling in the frigid cold.  Eventually he lost track of time as the buzzing in his ears drowned out everything else.
“Home of fire and brimstone, institutionalized guilt and pray away the gay. Unfortunately common.” Tony said scrunching up his face.
“I have yet to acquire a taste for this Midguardian drink.” He said.  “The beer in Asguard has more heart.”  Thor leaned against the railing with Steve.  “You seem reserved tonight Captain.  What troubles you?”
“Hey, so for the comms I was thinking of adding a vitals sensor in case…” Tony stopped talking.  He was accustomed to being listened to and Steve was not listening, he continued to pound away at the bag.  Upon moving closer he saw that the canvas, Kevlar reinforced, was streaked with blood.
He took a minute to appreciate the heated floors and towel bar when he got out before wandering into his bedroom again.  He opened his closet and sighed in exasperation, just as he had the night before at the expansive selection of clothes that were behind the door.  As he put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, he discovered that the pants were tailored to fit perfectly, a rarity with his build, though the fit was… more modern… then he was accustomed to.  He walked back out into the living room.
“Bend your knees more.” Steve said.  Then he swung at Tony’s shoulder. “Freeze.” He said as soon as Tony moved to block. “Look at your body. You’re flinching away you want to meet it not run from it.” He set back up and motioned for Tony to do the same.  “Again.”
Tony wandered down to the training rooms playing with a new communicator design. Clint had been complaining that it had been interfacing with his hearing aid poorly. Three prototypes and several shocks to Clint’s ear later, he wanted to clear the final design with Steve before he put it in to production.
“Too much traffic.” Tony sounded amused.  Even though Steve knew he was right he still held it against him a little bit.
“Is my fault you know.” Tony said. He finally looked at Steve. His eyes were red rimmed and puffy. “I promised I’d stop all this hero shit.  It was fine when it was just me I put in bad places. At the beginning you know, but she kept getting dragged in and… and that wasn’t fine. I meant to stop.” Tony took a ragged breath.  “But I can’t.  I had to choose. And I meant to choose her.” He looked down at his feet. Steve could see tears leaking out of the corners of his eyes. “But I can’t not do this Steve.  I don’t know how to stop.”
“I’m sorry, I went off today.” Steve poked a stray pickle around with a fry. “I know I’m pretty rotten at the whole adjusting thing.”
“You’re Steve Rogers aren’t you? You’re Captain America.”  She looked very excited all of a sudden.  This seemed odd to Steve as she had an hour previously had Ironman as a bedfellow.
He thought he had understood what it was to be cold when he had been ninety pounds and the New York winter had ripped through him with sleet blowing winds that soaked his ratty jacket and left him shivering with the flu till it finally stopped snowing halfway through April, when they couldn’t afford wood for the fire and Bucky had snuck home coal stolen from the docks in his pockets so they could boil a pot of water that Steve could sit over and breathe the steam that came off it to try and calm his rattling lungs.
“Hey.” Steve sat facing Tony with his legs crossed. He tried to start talking several times, but no sound came out of his mouth when he opened it.  “This is a little out of my comfort zone, but I think I want to give it a try.”
“Stark doesn’t deal with things.  He runs from them.” Natasha said.  As if to prove her point Tony managed to avoid all contact with anyone till Steve again spotted him sneaking out the next evening.
“That’s not why I’m here.”  Steve sat down on an empty stool and pulled out the little notebook Tony had given him. “I’m here because you needed more coffee and I need to figure out what the hell a hipster is.”
“It’d be a media shit-storm,” Clint said. “The paparazzi would go crazy; Fox News would drown in their own tears!”  He seemed giddy just from the thought of it.
Steve took the bottle out of Tony’s hand without resistance.  Tony slumped against his shoulder. Steve watched him through the reflection in the window as the city lights twinkled in the background.
Tony in turn told the story of what he, as well as the Collegiate Times, titled “The great burrito heist.”  He had to stop and explain the concept of burritos to Steve.  He promised an outing to chipotle when they weren’t stuffed full of burgers.
Saying he was taking some time to road trip across the country, that’d he’d be back in a month. He said he’d join them then and he wished Tony well. Tony couldn’t help but smile at the excruciatingly perfect penmanship or the precision with which the stamp was placed on the outside of the envelope. He pulled out his phone and sent Steve a text.
“Fuuuckk.  Why Jarvis?” Tony moaned and rolled over.   He had only gone to sleep two hours previously.
Tony stepped up to Clint and raised his hands suddenly grateful for the few self defense lessons Happy had given him.
“Supposed to be cutting back.” Tony slurred before taking a long swig. He looked everywhere but Steve. “Been fucking up a lot of supposed tos lately.”
“Go right ahead.” Natasha said. “Stark is just bitter because I already put him to shame once tonight.”
“Oh, right, slang, not your forte.” Tony said. “How often does that happen anyway? Like do you ever completely follow a conversation?”  Steve didn’t answer.
“I donno Cap.” Natasha said.  She was smiling and already lacing up her shoes.  “You really going to hit a girl?” Steve stammered a little bit and Natasha laughed. They headed to the center mat.  Out of the corner of his eye Steve could see bets being placed and money exchanging hands.  He did not appear to be the crowd favorite to win.
Tony talked a lot. He talked to the point of babbling and often Steve completely lost the direction of the one-sided conversation. They walked from room to room and floor to floor and Tony happily punctuated every sentence with a sip from his drink and gleefully stole Steve’s when he noticed it had thus far gone untouched.
Steve looked back at the rainbow mess being projected in the center of the room. “And how’s that going?”
Steve: Sometimes it's nice to take the time to do something by hand for someone. It shows appreciation.
“He is basically a computer that runs everything in the tower.  If you never need anything just say so.  He can hear you.  Right buddy?” Tony said. He smiled at the ceiling.
“No, sir.” Steve was sure he was imagining it, but he thought he heard a hint of concern in the machine's voice.
“You two disappear for hours and now every time you are in a room with each other you are sneaking glances at the other and looking away as soon as the other moves.”
“Hunger is a mental construct meant to distract me from being productive,” Tony said but he kept eating. Steve chuckled.
The sermon was longer than Tony would have liked and the wine was wretched but Steve seemed pleased by the whole ordeal.  Tony figured it was the familiarity of the routine.  Steve knew when to stand up and sit down with the rest of them.  Tony on the other hand was always two seconds behind the group, the first second because he had no idea what was going on, the second because he was too busy watching Steve to try and figure it out. When they held hands for the prayer Steve’s hand seemed to envelop his completely.  Steve’s skin was cool against his.  He began to worry about how sweaty his palms must feel.
“What are you looking to get out of this?” Tony asked.  He thought back to the park and how there was undeniably a connection.  He doubted that the terms ‘just casual’ or ‘fuck buddies’ were within Steve’s vocabulary or capability; not that he wanted that.   Tony’s brain was currently requesting scary things like ‘everything’ and ‘forever’ that he knew no sensible person would be thinking about after one make out session.
“You are so much more than that.” Steve saw Tony try to pull away at that. He raised his other hand to Tony’s face and kissed him gently slowly until he felt him relax. “I’m ready for this if you are.” He said quietly.  Tony stepped back and looked at him intently.  Slowly he relaxed though he was still trying to avoid eye contact.
Almost (mostly) dying had a way of distracting people from other things, it wasn’t till the next morning that Tony really realized he had missed them. His mind raced. He fumbled with the thick metal cuff he wore over his mark and looked at hoping it had changed without him noticing, but it had stayed the same. Yesterday had been his soul day and he had no idea who they were. He felt panic set in.  He tried to admonish himself, this had always been the plan hadn’t it? To pretend his soulmate didn’t exist, to pretend that happiness didn’t have an expiration date marked into his flesh. He supposed deep down even if he actively tried to not care he always figured his soul day would come and he would meet the person, he would know, and would have simply saved himself all the angst and worry up to that point. But here he was, alone, expired, trying not to have a panic attack about it.
“Hello.” Steve said.  He reached into his pocket and pulled out the postcard and handed it to Tony. A huge smile slipped across Tony's face as he read it and then slipped it into the back pocket of his jeans.
“Too busy right now”  He waived at the schematics. Steve swatted at the projection gracelessly and it went away again.
“Yeah.” Steve said rolled his shoulders out. “Give me a few days to recover from that one and we can do it again.”
“Have you read this?” He asked calmly. Steve nodded and purposefully continued to look out the window.  He had read the file on the ride over even though he suspected he wasn’t supposed to.  It didn’t paint a pretty picture.   Inability to comprehend or interact with modern society… PTSD… Anxiety disorder…Depression…  Tony closed the file.
“Hey, what are you writing?” Tony peered over Steve’s shoulder.  The text read: A wild Stark on the hunt for coffee.  “you’re hilarious Barton” He said.
drink she came up to him and told him the car was waiting for him outside.  For a second, he was offended but then he realized this was his out. He followed her and hoped she didn’t notice when he stumbled a little bit right before the stairs,
An hour later, six a.m., god he had woken up early, he had managed to pull himself together and had a shower he headed downstairs to the kitchen of his upstate mansion he was putting everyone up at till all the debriefing and paperwork was done. He wasn’t totally surprised to find Steve up and puttering around the kitchen, gloriously sweaty, presumably from an early morning run. He was wearing a hoodie and gym shorts his sleeves rolled up but tony noticed he too wore a cuff around his wrist obscuring his soul mark.  It looked like old worn leather and Tony wondered how he had come upon something so aged in the few months he had been back in the world. Tony scuffed his feet at the doorway and Steve quickly yanked his sleeves down over the cuff.
“It might be.” Steve was already getting out three pates.  Just as he put the eggs on the table the distress beacon began sounding. It was the first time it had gone off since the battle of New York
“You’re late.” Steve walked up and took the coffee cup out of Tony’s hands. “No caffeine before a workout.”  Tony almost cried as Steve dumped the drink in the trash.  He was quickly reconsidering his opinion on Steve Rogers.
“About you and Stark.” She said.  “And don’t talk with your mouth full. It makes even you look unattractive.”
It took him a minute to understand what he was seeing.  In the center of the room larger than life was the cover of one of those magazines that were in the grocery store aisles. Tabloids, Clint had called them ‘hardly ever anything true in em’ he’d muttered.  This one, in particular, had a blurry picture of two young men kissing red plastic cups in hand.  Written in blocky yellow text over the bottom of the picture:  Tony Stark Makes out with Mystery Man. Tony swiped at the air and the picture changed.  This cover featured a posed photo of Tony poorly edited to look like he was wearing makeup and glitter. Tony Stark Gay??  This one read.
The press was moving in. A news chopper flew over head.  Tony tried to wave but the arm of his suit gave an unfortunate whir and Tony grimaced.  “Debrief at the tower?”
“it is a good representation.” Thor quickly hit the send button.  “Tony, Steve, we must take a photo to commemorate the start of your relationship.”
“Eh,” Tony shrugged. “It guarantees I get at least a few calories in every hour.” He drank deeply and Steve gave him a concerned almost fatherly look that was turned humorous by the eggs in his mouth. He gestured to the skillet
“Hey Jarv, gimme a local church, low on bible thumping, high on stain glass windows.”  Several options floated themselves in front of Tony and Steve.
When they got back Bruce was lounged on the couch. His nose buried in one of the thickest physics books Steve had ever seen.
Steve could see the fight unfolding a block away. Ironman dove down and released him from about thirty feet up.  He flipped to the ground next to Clint who instantly started giving a situation report.
“Sir, Captain Rogers had just arrived in the first floor lobby and is proceeding to the elevator.”  Tony set down his tablet and rubbed his eyes.   He had literally every piece of data possible on the Chitauri communicator but he had yet to make any sense of it.
“Hey,” Tony ran his thumb over the part of Steve’s collarbone visible over the collar of his V-neck shirt. “You set the pace okay? I need to know that if you aren’t comfortable you are going tell me, alright?
He looked up to see Steve looking very concerned and realized that all that was holding him up was Steve’s hands on both of his shoulders.
Natasha watched him closely for a moment and then seemed to come to her own conclusions.  From what he knew of her Steve was inclined to think that they were correct.
“If I had known I wouldn’t have done it.  I’d have tried to turn the plane around; I’d have made sure I didn’t make it.”
“What’s all this?”  Steve asked.  His eyes followed the graph and the over abundant number of points that were now defining themselves.
The training rooms were exquisite, state of the art, better than what shield had,  When Steve said as much Tony scoffed.
“Tony?” Steve said.  He squatted down and lifted Tony over his shoulders and walked him to the couch where he gently deposited him.
“Take away all the numbers Jarvis.  I don’t want to see the numbers.” Tony said waving his hands at some of the data points that had begun to define themselves.  Tony sat on his chair and watched the array flicker as he took another sip of his drink.
While the rest of the crew was eating an the destroyed restaurant, he snuck into the bathroom, miraculously still intact and rolled up the sleeve to his suit. His mark was still there, He sighed in relief and then for a second an insane thought crossed his mind, His arm had begun to burn the second tony went through the portal in the sky, he wondered, but he quickly shook it off, he had helped hundreds of people out of the rubble today, and met hundreds more on the shield helicarrier. The hope blossomed viciously again, but he realized, Howard had seen his mark, he hadn’t bothered to cover it back then, had It been Tony, Howard would have told his son, Tony would have known. He sighed and walked back out to join the group.
Steve wandered out to the balcony and watched as the sun set over the city. He could hear laughter and Tony’s loud protests of cheating in the background. Steve swirled his beer, still the first one of the night it had long ago grown warm. Thor walked out to join him.
“Science doesn’t seem to apply Jarvis.  We are taking a more… liberal approach.”  And by a more liberal approach Tony meant drunkenly staring at the wave of colors the display was producing while he let his mind wander where it wanted.  The theory was that some other intoxicated conversation from his year as a theoretical physics grad student would float to the surface and suddenly give meaning to the senseless data. His mind instead took the liberty of playing over the file Steve had handed him.
“Steve, let’s be clear.” Tony sounded agitated. “You are not here because Fury is making me teach you how to use a computer. You are here because you are my teammate and you needed a place to stay.” The folder pressed against Steve’s arm with more force. “Besides, this would be a pretty shitty Avenger’s tower if there was only one avenger living in it. And hey, you might even learn to use a computer along the way. “ He said with a smile.  Steve took the folder and tucked it back in to his bag. He wondered how much Tony had read, if he thought less of him for it.  Good soldiers didn’t get shell shock, of whatever fancy word they had for it these days.   They kept walking to fight another day.  He had always told himself he was a good soldier.  Some people still seemed to believe it but he wasn’t so sure.
Steve landed a kick in the center of Thor’s chest that sent him flying back on to his butt.  They both sat there breathing heavy for a minute. Steve bent over and put his hands on his knees resting waiting for Thor to get back up.  His shirt was soaked in sweat.  It rode up in the back revealing a thin line of skin.
Steve sighed “Is there a way you can… not do that?” Just in here, you can still be in the living room I guess.”
An hour later Tony was sweating more than he had since Afghanistan and seemed to have made very little progress.
“Steve?” He called from the door of the dark apartment.  “Jarvis, lights at twenty percent.”   He made his way through the apartment as loudly as possible in the hope that Steve would not startle and punch him through a wall.  All of the bed sheets had been thrown aside. Steve was drenched in sweat and shaking so hard it was visible from across the room.  His ribcage moved up and down rapidly while his shoulders seemed to curl further in on themselves.
“Just hear me out? Okay?” Tony said.  “Firstly I want to you to know I’m not upset with you.” Tony saw Steve visibly relax.  He continued. “And it’s pretty clear you have some self discovery that you have to do.” Steve started to object but Tony put his hand up. “If you decide you just want to put all of this behind you we are all good.  But if you are interested in exploring it further, consider this an invitation.”
“Not hungry my ass.” He dipped his fries in his shake.  Steve was too bust eating to talk so Tony rambled about anything and everything.  Steve suffered through the techno babble admirably although Tony saw his eyes glaze over once or twice.
He spent the evening watching firefly on Clint’s recommendation.  He heard a crash followed by the clanking of glass against glass coming from the living room.
He stood up and began to walk over to the coffee pot himself mumbling unintelligible things under his breath but he didn’t get two steps before Pepper slid in front of him.  When she wore heels she towered over him.  Usually he found that incredibly attractive but at times like these he hated it a little bit.  He tried the puppy face again and only got an eye roll for his efforts.
‘Stark, take the scrawny one in the back. Hawkeye get the strong man. I’ve got the speedster.’  They listened to him without question jumping in to action, trusting his call.  He took down the attacker with a single hit to the gut, careful not to break and bones. He put the guy in handcuffs and looked over to see that Clint had equal success.  Tony was a different story. Somehow the boy, no more than seventeen years old, had managed to get Tony’s helmet off and was now holding a knife to his throat.  It was clear as long as the boy was touching him Tony couldn’t move a muscle.
“I don’t know how.”  Steve knew he sounded pathetic but the prospect of talking to Tony again scared him shitless. “I’ve never done this before.”
“Do you think I should do it?” Steve had made his way through all the boxes and strewn about parts nearly silently.
“Right down the hall.” Natasha said when it became apparent Steve and Clint were too bust staring to answer. “Do you have a ride?”
“And now the feature event!” The doors slid open to his floor And Steve knew his mouth was hanging open but he couldn’t really stop it.  The main room was massive.  A large sectional sofa cordoned off part of the room with a huge TV  on one wall and a bigger fireplace on the other.  The space then flowed into a kitchen and bar larger than any total space he had ever lived in.
Steve’s phone buzzed.  When he opened it two new apps sat on his main screen which before had only had the weather app and online cribbage. Steve clicked in and saw his profile all set up.
“Yeah.” Tony’s thumb rubbed circles on the back of his hand.  He gave Steve his full attention. Steve had spent the week choosing how he was going to word what he was about to say.
“He does, but this time he ran over the target with an SUV screaming ‘DIE FUCKERS DIE’ at the top of his lungs… in the middle of the town square.  It made the city’s local news.  Thus paperwork... also a psych eval. ” She must have seen the look of mild horror on Steve’s face because she quickly said “Don’t worry.  They deserved it.”  If anything that made him feel more concerned.
“Yes.” They kissed lazily for a while and ended up sitting side by side Steve’s arm draped over Tony’s shoulders his cheek pressed into Tony’s hair.
“I don’t think either of us was acting our best that day.” Steve said.   “Don’t worry about it.”   Tony smiled and held out his hand.
“You’re my teammate. “Steve said. “It's my job to make sure you stay at least semi-functional.” He smiled. “Also the way you are inhaling those eggs don’t even try telling me you weren’t hungry.”
“Thanks Tony, this is all real swell.” Steve said.  He was about to push the door open and go inside when Tony spoke up again.
“I have programmed them into Mark VII sir. It is ready in the launch bay.” Tony sprinted, the earlier thought of the day had totally evacuated from his mind.  As he ran Jarvis played security footage a few feet in front of him. He could tell it was going to be a rough few days.
“I can turn off video surveillance if you wish, Captain; however, I will still be able to speak to you during emergency procedures such as evacuations or calls to assemble.”
Slowly the other Avengers showed up to live in the tower.  Bruce came first. Steve walked in one morning to him and Tony neglecting their toaster waffles on their plates and animatedly gesturing at the same graph Tony had been looking at the other day.
Tony snorted and snatched the book out of his hands. He flipped through the pages Steve had filled, an embarrassing number.  An over dramatic sip of coffee later he said “Fasten your seatbelts; we’ve got some work to do.”
The plane was going down and he knew it.  As he was comforting Peggy, as the water got closer he  imagined that he’d hit the water and that’d be the end of it.  He told himself it would be okay, it would be over. He almost dared imagine he would be in a better place.
“Did you win your board game?” Tony pressed a kiss into Steve’s hair. Steve blushed at the simple gesture.  Further proving, as a far a tony was concerned, that he wasn’t ready.
“Thank you.” He said.  He went back to looking out of the window and the silence stretched between them.
“Of course Captain, if you need assistance I shall still be available from the remainder of your living quarters.
When Steve met Peggy, his heart hurt from knowing that she was not the one, she was seventy years too early, and her soul day less than five years away. He loved her dearly and couldn’t understand how she couldn’t be the one, but it was there inked on both their wrists clear as day.
“But…but” Tony tried to protest but articulacy came with caffeine.  Without it he was approximately a three year old.   Steve didn’t notice or skillfully ignored his protests.
“Come on Pepp.” He said giving her his best puppy eyes with his cheek still pressed against the table.  No Effect.  Maybe He’d been using the puppy eye too much lately. “I’m in the middle of almost having a breakthrough here.  I need to be able to think.” He begged.  Pepper looked skeptically at his work surface and the jumble of sensors that surrounded a small chunk of grimy metal.  Tony tweaked a random knob on the largest machine and gestured to the changing graph that was projected in the center of the fortress of tool boxes that he had made.  Pepper again looked at the tangle of wires and then back to him.
“Not even the exciting part!"  Tony interjected. He pulled Steve into the room and the around the corner. He opened the door to what Steve could only assume was supposed to be a study but it looked more like a full-blown library, one wall was lined with books the other with thin cases he soon realized were records. Against a wall made entirely of windows, there was a large desk with an assortment of art supplies
“When I first arrived here I struggled Thor said.  It had been centuries since I last visited Earth and very little of what I found made sense to me.  Do not try to reconcile the life you had with the one you are leading now.  You will fail.  Find a new path here.”
Tony wondered if his soulmate was still alive, withering away in some nursing home or if they were long gone. Either way, he felt bad for Steve, worse than he felt for himself if he was being honest.
“That was one time!” Clint wailed. He turned to face Steve. “It’s not fair she uses her boobs for the forces of evil!”
“Agent Romanov is but she has already eaten sir.” Steve nodded in acknowledgment.  He started the coffeemaker and placed two pans on the stove range and began cracking eggs into one of them as the smell of coffee filled the room.
“Hello?”  He peaked around the corner but the room appeared empty. Just as he was about to turn and leave he heard another clink and a shuffle. “Jarvis, lights please.” He stepped further in to the room and barely caught a pair of feet retracting out of view on the floor behind the bar. Quietly he walked up to the bar.  He could hear the sound of liquid sloshing from below the granite counter top. He turned the corner and found Tony slumped against the counter staring a dead eyed stare through his reflection in the window. His tie was pulled off and thrown across the floor absorbing the last drips of an empty bottle turned on its side.  Tony took a sip of the bottle he was currently working on not even seeming to notice Steve. Steve slowly sat down next to him.
“He draws a lot,” Natasha said. “On everything, envelopes when he is talking on the phone, on his mission briefs. Get him some art supplies.”
His mark not matching Peggy’s didn’t stop him from pining for her or kissing her before he hopped on the plane. As he watched the water draw closer he hoped fate had been kind to her and given her someone who would survive the war. He also felt guilt, he wondered if his soulmate had their mark yet if they would know he was gone. He tried not to think too hard about it in those last seconds, there was nothing else he could do now. As he blacked out surrounded by cold water the last air bubbles that left his lungs held the words ‘I’m sorry.’
“That its happening right now and we have a chance to change it.” Tony said.  The waiter came by with the check and Tony handed him a hundred dollar bill and told him to keep the change.
“It’s just a lot to take in. Everything is so different from what I’m used to.”  Steve took a swig of the beer and resisted the urge to spit it out over the edge. “How do you do it?”  Steve asked.  He wondered if the difference was that Thor could go home with a single word.
Both of Tony’s parents had lost their marks in the war before they met the person it was attached to. Tony thought they were really the lucky ones, free to do whatever they wanted, no bullshit magical tattoos dictating their fate.
Tony ordered what he thought to be too much food and watched in amazement as Steve put away two quarter pounders, two orders of fries, a basket of onion rings, and an extra large milkshake.
Fury told him they would let him know when he was needed and until then he was welcome to train with the agents on base.  Steve had quickly figured out that no one had time to talk to him or answer any of the dozen questions he had about the future. People looked at him funny when he called it that.  He had to remind himself repeatedly that to everyone else this wasn’t the future but the present.  Every agent, however, seemed to have time to come down to the gym and try to hold their own against him hand to hand in the ring.  Many were good natured; asking him for advice and not hitting hard enough to hurt.  Other times men came in with something to prove; often taunting words came with them.  They would say things like Iron Man had been the real hero of New York, not him… any man with a bit of muscle in a costume could have done what he did.  They hit harder, with a sneer on their faces and a crowd would gather to see if the local hot shot could take down the living legend.  Bullies hadn’t changes much in a century.  They found themselves with their backs on the mat quickly, more so if they tried to get back up.
Had either of them been paying attention they would have noticed four figures poorly concealing themselves behind furniture listening to their every word and watching intently.
He wasn’t looking at Steve or the images anymore but at his feet.  “And this is what you will be associating yourself with if our relationship is the platform you use to come out.” He set the tablet down, but the image stayed floating in the middle of the room.
Clint had plopped down on the couch with a first aid kit tucked under one arm and pulled out a needle and thread and began to stitch up a deep gash on his hand.
“There was great debate on how to organize things.” Tony said steamrolling through Steve’s objections. He pointed to the bookshelves. “That center case each has a shelf our recommendations. There was concern over whose shelf Harry Potter got to be on.  Natasha won the rock paper scissors game.” Steve walked over to the desk and ran his fingers over the covers of one of the sketchbooks.
