Cas had sliced one throat, but then a hound charged his whole weight onto him and he fell backwards to the floor. The thing attacked viciously his right arm, since it was his right hand that had his blade gripped, and shook his head until he got it out of the way… and into the Holy fire.
Castiel had not been the first mage to find some similarities between The Corruption,
Cas appeared flawlessly beside his bed, but before he opened his eyes the weight of the hunter´s body made him almost fall face-first into him. He tripped with a little yelp, but managed to lower him into the left part of the mattress.
Dean´s eyes shone with uncertainty for a second; before he frowned, determined, and gave a curt nod. Before Cas could move, the hunter took a small scalpel that the doctor had left ready beside the cauldron, and made a small cut on one of his fingers. He directly put his hand over the cauldron and a drop of blood dropped in the mix. A faint-glowing red spiral of light surged from where it fell on the center, to swirl around the cauldron until it touched its edges.
The mage steeled his resolution and trotted quickly after the hunter. Behind them, the severed monster was still twitching on the ground. The bee was gone.
“Don´t… touch my arm. It hurts”
“It´s… not. Not completely”, he grunted, unwillingly.
”, she chided jokingly.
“Good morning, Castiel”
He lost his words, too many he wanted to say at the same time. Dean was frozen, looking at him with wide eyes. Cas was panting, rage flaming on his veins; he was shaking. The rage mixed with his pain and simmered down to pure hate for a second.
“You okay, Kevin?”, asked Dean.
Cas smiled at his concern.
His body started to shake, horror taking control of it. Suddenly the air was not enough to breathe, and as he gasped he saw the knife stop just over his skin, tip barely caressing it. His neck strained as he looked down towards it, as he tried to lean back away from it, as he grunted from the spikes on his back biting deeper.
If he were a biomancer like his brother Gabriel, if he knew more about using life magic, he could have easily touched the ground and ask the forest. But he wasn’t. The biggest feat he had ever done with life magic was changing his own eyes, and probably because changing one´s body was very close to healing magic. He couldn´t make a plant bloom even if it killed him.
“It wasn´t like that”, answered Cas, glaring.
“Behind you!!”, Cas shouted.
When I started this fic, I was deeply depressed. Full pandemic raging, away from the boyfriend and friends, no hopes for studies or work- the only thing that gave some kind of sense to my life was creating a bit of this every day. The only difference between a day and the next was in which part of this story I was. Now things have changed a lot, but I am deeply grateful to this idea, to this project. The drive might not be the same- luckily my life has more sense now and the depression is I think overcome- and I am writing another fic, studying much more, creating several roleplays (Supernatural themed, by the way, and they are kinda awesome xD)... but I am determined to see this little thing grow and achieve completion.
He ran his hand all the way to his neck, pressed the back of it a bit with a grunt, and started to clean himself. He was exhausted, but he had developed too many years ago the habit of showering first thing when a hunt got bloody. It was the easiest way to work in motel rooms. Anyone is allowed to sink into bed after spending the night on a nest full of vampires, but the blood-stained sheets cause way too many questions and raised brows. Now he had his own place- his own room, for heaven´s sake- but old habits die hard, he guessed.
“Do you think he’s inside?”
Dean had been waiting for him, impatient, uncomfortable, ready to leave for the forest, not knowing when his next chance for getting clean would be. The only source of hygiene he had had at his grasp had been the silver basin that Cas had so hastily cleaned to make himself decent. So
Dean turned to look at him questioningly. The mage stepped forward and put two fingers to his temple without a word.
, he thought.
“Damn”, said Dean frowning, “How the hell did you recover so fast?
Lucifer pressed his lips, apparently unhappy, and looked away. And before Castiel´s eyes, he… shrank a little.
Cas looked at him, pensive again.
“I… do remarkably well on my finances”, Cas mumbled.
“Faaan-tastic”, grunted Dean, “I guess you can´t take us, I don’t know, some feet away from the stone proper”
“The killing, Cas”, grunted Dean.
Until Dean had a single wolf on his right. Then, Castiel saw from where he sat how Dean smiled slightly to himself. He blinked as he recognized his angel blade on his left hand, never having seen how it had gotten there.
Dean´s eyes were lost on the possibilities, a slight glint to them.
He felt his cheeks flush. His… mind really couldn’t recall all of Dean´s nakedness. He was too embarrassed, it was too inappropriate. But… his chest though, he´d seen it several times now, and as Dean had said… the important bits were covered. That was okay… at least it was not so bad? His chest, and strong shoulders, and…
His head whipped back, some kind of feeling grasping at his heart for a second. Like… fear, for some reason. Like angst. Had…
He had started from the assumption that when he felt Castiel´s grace, that was exactly the moment they all had arrived. In seconds he had gotten there, and assumed that the boys were in the next corridor and running from their lives as he faced the angel; specially from that pathetic little shout the seraph had given.
“Yes you can, don´t fucking say that”
“I´m guessing we are going to appear exactly where you found me?”
“Shh, it ́s okay, it ́s okay”, he murmured as his hand patted calmingly.
Dean looked up at him, surprised.
done before worked. He took his arms up, hands clawed. While he raced, he took as much magic as he could from the world around him; and he then thrust his balled fists to the ground beneath him.
Castiel fluidly grabbed the end of the discreet door as it bounced back, in a movement of pure habit, and opened it to walk into adjacent quarters.
They had finished eating and had left the tray on the floor outside of the room- only two goblets and a big bottle between them. Dean was sprawling in the chair, not sitting straight on it for even a minute, tilting it towards the wall sometimes; while Castiel sat on the bed.
Also, till now Dean´s mostly sucked cause he was hurt and out of his element. Its *his* time to be cool! ^^
Dean sighed.
“Yes, you have”, nodded Dean, “And that´s awesome, man. But this place, it makes no sense”, he looked around pointedly, “Someone saves me and takes me to the most luxurious room I could imagine? Heals me, promises to help me find my brother? Too good to be true. There´s gotta be a catch”
His frowned eyebrows raised a bit as his eyes locked on something, like a hound that´s found its prey. Then they glided to the left, making him slowly turn his head, turn his whole body…
“Cas? Today?”
The Great Hall shone in its usual splendor. Dark wood and golden filigree were illuminated by candlelight, the picture windows that opened into the dark night covered by red velvet curtains.
“You can’t mean that”, the hunter insisted.
“And he fully intended to die trying! The
“Just saying, man”, Dean shook his head, relentless, “In my line of business, you can´t go around trusting strangers. And I´m sorry, dude, but you´re sketchy. It´s very clear that you wanna hide your identity from me, and where we are. You are elusive as
Then four, six.
!! Dozens of screams rose in the house, as beneath him the man took a loud gasp of air and started coughing desperately.
They shared one of their looks, one of their staring glances, as both kept the shadow of a smile on their lips.
came when you met someone new. Everyone had learned to bond through trauma, he thought. Five years of war will do that to a society.
And then a beautiful punch drove him to the wall. That´s how he discovered there were people downstairs, too.
He didn´t think twice before diving down. It was stupid, an unnecessary risk, as his mother would put it. He fully knew. Combat manuals don’t stipulate
“Dude, dude, dude”, the hunter quickly said worried putting a hand on his shoulder, “You okay?”
He turned in a slow circle, his alert eyes scanning the vegetation. His hand had come to rest at the hilt of his sword at some point without him noticing.
He approached with business-like manners to the center of it, the proper workspace, and stared into the mid-distance to organize his thoughts. He needed a healing elixir. Something not magically charged, something that helped him heal without corrupting him. But not too slow, or he wouldn’t make it. Not too strong. Not too weak. Calculus started forming in his mind, until he nodded and got to work.
“Dude, seven's a lot. So many siblings”
“Huh… Handy”
“I know that you are important. As much as Sam or me. You are not… less important. And… you don´t need the other angels. They turned their backs on you, well that´s
Cas nodded and whirled to run out the door.
“Dean!”, he heard someone coming, and he flinched away.
Gabriel´s… reality was a bit too tough on him. Each of them dealt with the duties of being a noble in a different way, and while Cas just buried himself in Academy work… Gabriel ran away. He hid in the jokes, in the illusions. He indulged in alcohol and recreational substances sometimes, though never to a worrying degree that he´d known. He disappeared sometimes for days, on
. But not for nothing he had chosen the best guy to do it, he thought to himself as he smiled wickedly.
“According to them, there are three located woodland fiend nests in the forest”, he explained as Dean got closer to get a look at the map, where three crosses had been marked in red ink, “Two are close to where my bluestone is currently located. We could go towards either one from that point today”
He had definitely never seen Gabriel like that. He was suddenly very sorry he had worried his brother like that.
He could still hear them, laughing. Talking.
, he told himself,
“Like I said. More in common than I thought”
So, like he said. More like himself.
“You seem happy”, he commented, the slightest smile on the noble’s lips.
“Ah…”, he babbled as he started walking towards the bathroom, “Let me… let me get changed first!”
“Oh… I don´t. I don´t!”, she finally snapped out of her astonishment, “Castiel, this is incredible!”
“But isn’t that kind of information super expen…?”, started to ask Dean, turning towards him with his shirt half-way on.
Suddenly restrained by strong arms, a needle to his neck.
Footsteps approached… and entered the room. They both fell quiet, breathings controlled, eyes wide open.
Sam´s nerves jittered as he run alongside Kevin through the hallways. He grimaced as he heard Cas howl in the distance. He tried not to think about what would be happening to him. About why, if the situation was too hairy for him, wasn’t he vanishing and reappearing somewhere else, confusing their enemies; as the angel had assured them he could do to convince them to leave him behind as bait. About what was too much to overpower an angel of the lord. About what was his brother running towards.
Cas hurriedly got to the door and opened it, but just before closing it behind him, he looked back.
“That, that´s it!”, whispered Dean.
It really didn’t matter. The six demons that had been scratching the symbol a second ago turned towards them.
“Well, well”, Crowley said smiling to himself, “Turning angels into humans?”
“So”, Dean made a wicked smile as he joked, “Still not super sure on the potion part”
But Dean, observant as the hunter he was- and paying attention this time- noticed the differences. His shoulders were slump, he moved slower than usual. At some point he looked up from the parchment and his gaze got lost in the distance before he shook his head a bit and started moving again.
“I´m not leaving you, Cas”
“There were just, people we lost. Alive, happy, with us. Dream world, remember?”
English is not my first language so sorry if I mess something up ^^ Constructive criticism will be valued as gold!!
“You think so? You
“What do you need, Dean?”, he asked, his blue eyes drowning him.
His ashen, pained face just made a sweet smile, as if thanking him. As if saying that it was okay. That he was happy. That it was enough. That it was really okay. There was only a little bit of sadness, but his fond eyes seemed to say
Sam pursed his lips as he raised his head and nodded, admitting they would probably have the upper hand in this.
Cas nodded again and delicately put a hand to his covered belly. He felt the tingly sensation of magic leaving his skin, and the slight tensing on the hunter´s body under his touch let him know he felt it too. His power whispered the damaged muscle fibers to start growing, to join the sisters they had been torn from, to embrace each other and thread again as if no damage had ever been done; his skin, to grow evenly over the last marks, the scarred tissue, to be reabsorbed… all in the hushed poem of energies and pulses and warmth that inspired Castiel´s healing magic.
“Me? I told him that we had lost enough of our people, thank you very much, and that if he tried to do something like that again I would
After all, he has Charlie to cheer with for Arya.
Reluctantly he opens his eyes and finds Cas wrapped around his body: Dean’s legs are practically stuck, his back is against Cas’ chest and it lowers and rises slowly, their arms are resting on his belly and they do nothing but raise his temperature again.
Weird how Dean didn’t notice how Cas was hard pressed against his thigh, how their mouths were too close.
Castiel is fully dressed between his legs and he is leaving languid kisses on the other guy neck. He is moaning and sighing… It's fucking erotic.
Other than the youtube’s playlists of the best GoldenBuzzer by American's Got talent or The Blind
He would have laughed at Castiel's face if only he hadn't been busy trying to figure out what was happening to his characters.
Dean stares at the bottle in his hands, where only a small piece of paper is still attached.  Then Dean looks in the eyes of the stranger who has just spoken. When the place next to him on his bench has been occupied, it remains a mystery.
ends the call and Dean starts to feel so stupid, so pathetic.
He has a nice car, a good job and enough money to afford one of those apartments in those skyscrapers in the center of the richest district of Seattle. No one does really like them. They’re too nosy, too expensive and so pretentious.
That is the first morning that Dean don’t go to class since he got to collage.
So yes, Dean is tired of people, but he does not hate them. It's just that they've all become so predictable that Dean doesn’t have even to try harder to get something.
“I know” Dean smiles and tightens the knot of his tie, slightly loosened.
A big
And it’s really stupid suffer so much because at this point you should know that life is a bitch and at least suffer less. Doesn’t habit muffle the pain?
Dean want to scratch it away, rip it from his skin, eliminate for good everything related to Cas but this is wrong and selfish. Cas doesn’t deserve it, he deserve to be remembered forever and Dean deserve everything. He deserve his heart burning in his body, he deserve all the fallen tears, the pain that never will leave him alone and Cas deserve Dean’s pain, after everything he’s done for him, after every time Cas put Dean above all, Heaven, his brother and even himself, so many times that Dean can’t even count them.
“Dean…”
Eyes that are not empty or glassy anymore and keep staring at him amused ... and Dean has not answered the question yet.
But in no way, no one, Chuck could have predicted what would happen in the end.
People would probably all laugh in front of those serious blue eyes that keep staring at Dean as if they really want an answer.
"What, Dean?"
"Go to sleep"
And then Cas... Cas? A blasphemy, Dean Winchester took the name of an angel of the Lord and made it become a real thing, a person, part of that strange and unknown concept that he calls Family. No longer a mere useful object to insert a little pepper to the plot, ready to go out as soon as he accomplished his purpose.
Dean regretted what he did in the same time he took a step in that house. Seeing his body there, on that table, was his official breakpoint. Despite everything, his face was in peace, Cas didn’t breathe but after all he never did, angles don’t breath. His eyes didn’t shine anymore, that brilliant blue that had always made clear the difference between Castiel and his vessel.
Dean told him about his mother, the apple pies she makes every Sunday and about his father and how he doesn't agree with his choice to graduate in English literature, or go to college in general.
It is not just
"You aced today's exam"
"Did you think I'd leave you like this? Open and wet for me?"
It is no longer even meta-writing, it has become a complete joke. It wouldn't be surprised if Amara got something to do with it, maybe it's her revenge for having locked her up a long time ago.
Once again Chuck found himself watching Dean's soul doing things, feeling things, which he could never have considered, never written even if he wanted to.
"Cas ..." he whimpers when he realizes that that hand has no intention of moving away or at least helping his movements.
“You think he’s okay, then?”
“Dude”, Dean interrupted in a firm voice, “You got munched on for trying to bring me a freaking ingredient. Don´t apologize”
“Everyone´s fine, Charles”
“Are you sure?”, he said, insecure.
“Yeah”, he said finally, deciding to drop it, “Any more questions, Dr. Phil?”
“Already flowing to be protected, plus that big old suitcase you´re carrying”, he pointed at the briefcase that was already closed and on Sam´s hand.
“Mm-hm”, Dean made an affirmative sound.
“Ah, isn´t it beautiful”, murmured Lucifer, a well-fed cat air to him.
“I… will bring him home if, if he wants to come”, he added, “If not… I´m sure he will find a way to meet you and say hi or whatever”
Castiel took a deep breath, heart thumping. They were both ready, standing by the bluestone. Dean had the angel blade on his hand, while Cas… had simply rolled up his sleeves.
“Er, Cas, about…”, he started a moment later.
The mage frowned in anxiety at that. The way he had said that… it really seemed that he actually meant
His mind was racing furiously, calculating. How much magic he had in him, how many bursts of force he could still make. Magic translated into force, the direction of that force, weight, resulting trajectory, final parable. That high? Higher. Better to be safe, he concluded- while a voice in his head screamed at him that
He saw that son of a bitch raise a sloppy guard in front of him, his eyes wary as he gulped. Dean made a cruel smile. He had stood out of his reach as he cast the spell, as he summoned the Holy Fire that had consumed his parent´s house and his family…
He had left the cauldron ready with the ingredients needed for the little ritual Gabriel had explained to him in the hallway. He turned to Dean, who had given two ginger steps towards him.
Jack nodded, and the solemn look returned to him as he stared right into his soul.
They walked away from the rest, closest to the family portrait, to speak in low voices and barely moving their lips.
Dean nodded. Then he should leave soon, leave him to his prayers or meditation or whatever shit he did to refill.
Dean stared at him for a moment, before nodding.
“Would… you like to see the ranger´s message? It´s got some nest locations. It will be very helpful to find Sam”
debate.
“You know nothing about how
Cas grimaced. He should not have said that. He hoped Dean wouldn´t remember.
“Yeah, they do”, Castiel provided.
That made his little brother beam, and Cas felt that his weariness leaving him for a second at the sight.
. He kept calling it
A single wolf lashed towards Dean, but a quick lateral lounge took him out of its reach. The beasts kept staring, most of them just looking. Two more of them jumped at him; two lateral strides took Dean completely out of their reach. Growls of complaint sounded in the forest clearing. Dean never stopped moving, slowly, but avoiding being surrounded.
“No!! Dad!! Mooom!!”, Dean screamed, voice breaking.
“One cannot spawn children in a cis homosexual relationship, Dean. That is basic biology”, he stated in a tense, crisp tone.
“It´s okay”, Cas mumbled dismissively, “Do you always…? Say it so… carefree?”, he asked in a curious, confused frown, examining Dean again.
“It… sounds really impressive. She”, the mage corrected himself.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He wanted, he really wanted to do this
“How can you know?”
It had been a pressing day indeed.
Dean looked up at him in sudden slight surprise.
He started to take his jacket off and, under the confused look of his brother, did a noose on one end of a sleeve. He smirked at Sam, let the noose catch flame, and flailed it towards the darkness monster.
“It is mainly located on the chest now”, Cas answered, feeling the black veins over his heart, barely reaching his shoulder.
“Oh!, yes, yes…”, he looked around wildly until he found his folded trenchcoat and walked to it to rummage on its wide pockets, “I… I was told it was customary to deliver gifts at birthday celebrations”
“I know the feeling”, Cas smiled, “I have found people hurt in the woods before, and healed them. It is a risk, me not being an experienced fighter and all, and my mum has really tried to stop me from repeating it… but how can I turn around when I know I can help?”
Holy shit guys!!!! I´ts been a long while since I updated this and I´m sorry- if there´s someone following it, I´m not really sure there is ^^U. The thing is that, I got a super cool idea for a new fanfic, my first Alternative Universe. It swallowed me up and I´m so proud of how the worldbuilding is coming. I have three chapters already, but don´t wanna publish them yet cause I want to include some drawings that are not ready yet :) Follow my user if you wanna be warned when it comes out! The title is Kingdom of Heaven, and its a medieval destiel AU. Cas is a mage and Dean a non-magical hunter :)
“Awesome. I promise not to ogle”, the hunter said in a very disinterested voice, “Second”, he tugged on his own shirt from its neck to show him the tattoo on his clavicle, “You really need to get one of these. A dampening tattoo. It´s pretty clear that you can get some Corruption in you and shrug it off by the next morning, but the symptoms dampen your performance. The headache, the disorientation… By the way, how are you feeling?”, the hunter interrupted himself to look at Cas, tilting his head.
“Dean!”, he heard.
"Nope", said Dean with a nervous smile, "Guess we´ll burn that bridge when we get to it..."
“Yes. Or so I thought…”
Dean was looking at him, puzzled. He nodded as Cas paused.
He still felt pretty sick, so hunger was not a problem for him. But the hunter must have been starving for
“We are very sorry we couldn´t get here sooner”, Sam was saying, “We can´t face Crowley in his domain
“Wow, Cas…”, he whispered in a careful voice, “I… I’m not…”, he babbled as he started to get up from the chair.
“Come on. We´ve rested enough already”
He opened his eyes as he heard the Impala unlock, and sniffed as he returned his back to the backrest as Sam entered the driver´s seat and closed the squeaky door behind him.
an angel. Hell no!”
He roared and attacked forward, a guy fell down but someone grabbed his throat from behind, he thrashed. Then he screamed, more in surprise than in pain. Something had bitten onto his calf, and when he shook his leg violently he saw something black and small fly away across the room. Panting, he tried to see what it had been, but it had vanished into the shadows.
Cas frowned, doubt creeping into his gaze.
Dean snorted.
Second, because he had to get away from Gabriel, as fast as he could.
But Cas didn´t sleep.
The peasant looked at him for a moment before smiling a bit in what seemed like gratitude and nodding. Then he turned the heel and started walking in long strides, the noble following suit.
It was an act. He had dropped it on purpose.
“I do. I… There are… some tests I have to pass”, Castiel tried to explain, “Not only knowledge, but also performance. And as you saw, my first performance with the wolves left… lots of room for improvement”
He scrubbed off what he knew was a mix of demon blood, hellhound blood, his own; and very probably angel blood too, from when he had lifted Cas. Bits of burnt clothing stuck stubbornly at him. By the time he was done, parts of his skin were pink and sensitive, but he felt cleaner than in a long time.
“I mean… there’s not really any place we can go together”, he finally said with a wince, “No one should know you are here”
“It´s my pleasure”, the mage said meekly.
“Som… Something´s not right, Cas”, he murmured, eyes flicking nervously over the garden, as if his surroundings could give him any answers.
Cas looked up sharply... to find two green orbs watching him.
“Is everyone alright?”, asked the angel.
“And? What does that mean?”
“Ugh…!”, he groaned.
meant… But man, sometimes…”
“I know”, answered Castiel softly, still smiling to himself.
“Do you
“I´m not saying it´s all a bad thing”, Sam continued, turning to him, “God knows… well, I don’t know about God, but
“I’m so sorry”, frowned Cas.
“What?”, he murmured, “What do you mean?”
“Would you like a beer?”, murmured John.
“It´s done”
“Shit!”, Sam grunted, hacking at them.
“You come here”, he said tilting his head up, pure acid on his voice, “to tell me how to live my life? Are you really
“Don´t know, but it bites!”
“Yeah. See, apparently there´s something blasphemous in ghouls, given they feed off the dead of those that deserve their holy rest… So angel blades hurt them a lot. You can also identify if someone you´re talking to is a ghoul in disguise by touching them with it, even if it’s the handle. It´s something in the material they´re made of”
“Castiel”, Dean heard, halfway from them.
he answered himself,
“We gotta get to it right away...”
“What?”
But before his palm could alight over the door, before their hands aligned, Cas whipped his head back.
tell you I´m gonna give it my best effort”
“Well, you know we´re hunters, right?”, Cas nodded at that, “He was following a lead. Some kids have been getting missing in different villages that are all close to the Forest of Wyvernon. Lotta kids. Like, more than ten”
And it came out in a tone so magnanimous, so
He hadn´t shown him the bathroom.
“I don´t have the ingredients”, he sighed.
As he was munching through the corridors, something nagged on his mind, and he stopped to look over his shoulder.
“I-I shot you…”
Castiel took a deep breath and let out a sigh. Michael and Lucifer had been competitive with each other for as long as he remembered, but even though he rarely spoke to any of them, he felt it had gotten worse with the passing of the years. He fully knew that all of that was because of the conditions of their birth.
He couldn´t keep this up forever. He had no idea how long it could take Dean to end the other monster, he couldn’t wait. But what could he do? He wouldn’t even know how to attack the creature with so many legs in the way, and besides, would his angel blade even pierce that shell? He thought of his magic. His specialty, healing, was utterly worthless in the situation. Light would not blind it, and he didn´t expect to be able to push such a heavy creature. Even if he could, it would solve nothing…
Something… nagged at him suddenly at that thought, and he turned to the angel.
“What’s the big deal? I merely have bruises, and the slash on the side’s just a cut. It bleeds a bit and annoys me if I bend. Small business”
“Will you act as a gracious host, Castiel, seeing to the needs of the guest?”
“Sam!! I can´t open, it won´t fucking open!!”
Castiel blinked, surprised.
Castiel closed his eyes, concentrating. He visualized the pushing spell, gave it form on his mind… and when it was done, he tried to keep it there as he licked his lips and started raising both his hands.
His speech. He had a speech. He had worked on it for days, and for some reason, when he came here he had believed it was a good one. Now he only felt he was such an asshole, that the only thing he could do was hurt Cas more- but he deserved something. After all he´d been through…
“Can you take me back?”
The… thing… he didn’t see where it ended. It came from the corner, but occupied all of the width of the hallway with its black mass, that divided into creepy tentacles. It wasn’t incorporeal darkness, but Dean really couldn’t see if it had scales, hair or just smooth skin.
And suddenly he was there.
“I helped too!”
He looked so damned exhausted. Shoulders low, panting, bites and slashed on him. How many things had he fought alone until he had come? Dean gritted his teeth in anger. He shouldn´t have left him behind.
The mage walked meekly into the room and left the tray on the bed, Dean following him with his gaze in ominous silence.
“Yep! Consider yourself on prophet vacation”, added Dean.
A minute later he came back with an arm sling and offered it to Cas. The angel winced as Sam helped him put it on, but once it was on Castiel looked pleased and positively surprised.
“Yes, my lord, it is”, the servant provided with a compassionate smile, “I guess you are focusing a lot on your studies”
“Okay, that´s it, I´m getting you out of here”, Sam said firmly, “Come on”
“… of course, brother”, he answered dubiously.
“Did you try to transform yourself into a wolf?”, he asked, worry coloring his words.
He suddenly
They both shared that comfortable silence they sometimes got into, sipping on their scotch, knowing all the feelings between them without the need of acknowledging them or saying them out loud. Bobby might not be his father… but family didn´t end in blood.
”, he said, voice raised in the slightest due to his emotions, “I don´t care that you are a peasant. I knew that when I picked you up. You are not the first one I help, and will not be the last. You needed help, you still do, and I
thought of it that way.
, “It was fast. Merciful, I think. Destroyed half of our patio”, Castiel said playing a bit with his glass, eyes low.
complicate things a bit. It came with a side dish of waiting eternities in the dark, hiding around the stupid place until some poor bastard passed; and it was earning them a ton of avoidable punches and kicks. But it felt like an interesting challenge, at the most. At the end of the day, those people didn´t see in the dark, their punches didn´t send them flying towards the walls, and none of them could turn their entrails into goo just by looking at them funny. It was a nice change.
For some reason, everyone was on the second floor. Cas had appeared by the stairs, by Sam and Jess. Ellen, Bobby, Jo and Charlie stared in mouth-agape horror…
Kevin´s hand flew to the Angel tablet…
The mage stared at him for a moment.
. He cleared his throat, tried to gulp.
Castiel sat on the bed and, to Dean´s surprise, he opened one of his eyes to peek into it, then the other.
“She´s making your baby”
“What?”, a chair squealed as the angel suddenly got up, his tone immediately worried, “Where are you? What happened?”
The hunter blinked at him in confusion.
disapprove of and worry about your life choices but I know I can´t talk you out of it- when Dean had primly answered that he preferred to have a pass on the pills then. Now the bottle of Jack was half empty- which to him sounded way more positive than it being half full- and he let out a relaxed sigh. What did Sam know.
The hunter looked wide-eyed to the other locations mentioned.
“What happened to you…?”, murmured his brother slowly, prowling forwards like a cat for a second.
Whatever had latched onto him was propelled away, ripping part of his shoulder in the movement. The mage barely registered the pain as he scrambled to his feet, but could run only a step before something latched strong jaws on his leg and made his knees buckle. Something hit his back as he landed on his hands, and a huge weight tackled his body to the forest floor. He was able to cover his head with his arms before something would rip his head off his shoulders.
“What is it…?”, she simply said in a pressing tone.
Dean felt radiant with joy. His mother didn´t have to tell him how happy she was to see him, how much she´d missed him- and he had only been away for like two weeks. Full-on with the hunting business, he was usually crashing everywhere he was allowed to- at Sam´s, at the Roadhouse, at Bobby´s, or at his parent´s house. He felt no shame from being at his childhood home so often. His parents always made him feel welcome, although his dad was less prone to displays of affection than his mother.
Cas had his lips parted in admiration. Indeed, when Holy Fire- Holy Oil set ablaze- burned close to someone infected by The Darkness, it consumed it; given the lightomantic purification properties of the substance. That entailed a very deep understanding of the magic elements. The Darkness had finally been revealed to be the biggest shadowmantic spell that had ever been casted- mixed with some perversed healing magic, plus enough climatemancy to make a storm out of it for swift delivery.
Dean´s green eyes were wide, locked upon something in front of him, dismay and alarm slacking his face for a second.
“It ́s okay, Dean”, Castiel smiled at him, “Try to get some rest”
“Always. You know it”, Dean stated softly.
Dean smiled as his brother gave him his smartphone, where a newspaper webpage was open.
The hunter moved the light around, but nothing charged toward them. The djinn must have been somewhere else.
…the rail that looked over the War Room in the bunker.
He startled when his foot stepped on something hard, and as he looked down he saw the ripped ferns he had held onto. His angel blade lied there. He took it quickly, immediately getting vertical again, looking all around. The plant creature seemed to have extinguished the flames somehow, or maybe they hadn’t caught into its moist tissues, and its vines flowed again in his direction.
It was true that this was Cas´s first attendance to a Winchester party, but it wasn’t such a big deal, jeez. However, he could not help but feel the shadow of a smile invading his lips. Bobby´s attitude was a nice change of tune against John´s reserves.
, he told himself in a rush, and he made himself think of the least person he was attracted to- it worked like a charm, and for once, he felt grateful to have such a presence in his life.
“Well, a good hunting teacher would probably have not let you get caught by a mandrake, but here we are”, Dean shot back with a complicit smile, “Guess none of us is perfect”
The rune carved at the base of the crystal suddenly glowed intensely, its purpose known. At that, Cas raised his arm and crashed the stone into the ground.
The mage blinked confused and looked around. He gave him a moment.
And the fern leaves started to rip.
Dean´s sword stopped an attack, furiously deflected another one, and a strong slash delivered with a roar severed one of those frontal legs. He immediately jumped back, rolling through the ground, ready for the second endrega. He had to attack and roll, never stop running, never stop watching both creatures at once. He dodged another attack, sprinted to get behind the second creature and delivered an attack to its rear. The creature´s tail slashed, lighting fast, and hit Dean in the stomach; the hunter took several steps back, a hand to his middle, doubling over. The protections on his chest seemed to have stopped the spikes, but the blunt impact landed anyway. Both endregas turned towards him during the second he took to look up at them through a pained expression, panting.
Yes. They were going home.
“For God´s sake, Dean, I brought you here to
As they advanced, the ground became more humid, sometimes squelching beneath their boots. It kept growing until they got to a stream, before which Dean stopped, raising an arm to halt Cas.
. Dinner would be in twenty minutes, but he was expected even before that for the reception with his brothers. He actually had like… five minutes?
He stared at the blade for a second, puzzled. He… Had he kept his angel blade on his hand the whole time?
One second. Three seconds. Five. Dean´s heart was hitting double time when someone suddenly appeared.
He stopped himself as Sam turned the nightstand lamp on. He had felt, for his life that he had felt the scales of the Echidna all over him, its mucus drenching his clothes, seen those furious eyes on him.
“How so?”, the mage asked, indignation in his voice upon considering finding dead children something good.
He started crawling towards it, more than willing to put himself between the creature and the bullets.
“I thought it might…”, he murmured.
“Dean, you´re still poisoned…!”, Cas complained, sitting up on the bed.
He felt blissful. The gruesome images were finally fading, the anxiety on his mind drifting away, the knots on his muscles unclenching. And it was about damn time. It wasn’t as if the events of the day had been any more traumatic than average, he told himsel. He distractedly mused for a second over how the dream shit would affect the people that were not used to see living nightmares on a daily basis like him. He figured that the therapists of this little town were right about to strike gold. The bars too.
“I´ll find a way to speed it up. Okay?”
“He seems like a very skilled warrior, indeed”, Castiel said as his eyes roamed around the clearing, “He must take after his brother”
“Sure they had, and they looked, but couldn’t find them in the populated areas. And they won´t get into a forest that´s full of monsters. You gotta pay a crazy hunter for that”, he provided, tilting his head as if that were obvious.
Castiel clasped his mouth as John got to them, and he gave him a tense smile.
Cas snapped his eyes up to Uriel, who was looking at him and the note he had already folded… and who was getting the attention of his whole family towards him with his question.
Castiel took the tray from his hands, still clutching the message with some fingers until the peasant took it from them.
“Sit. Back”, he ordered firmly as he did.
He shook his head, willing the dizziness off, as he saw how the guy touched something on the floor, looked at his own fingers… and suddenly opened the chamber of the gun with a sharp flick. In frantic movements he took the bullets out, and… tossed them on the ground?
The noble licked his lips as he looked to one side, thinking.
Jack nodded slowly… and vanished.
Without being asked, knowing fully how necessary it was, Cas walked there and touched the bag of holding for a second.
*Remember this chapter*. Things from there WILL come back... and every detail is important :)
He had always been a bookworm: whenever he wasn’t at the Academy, he mostly stayed in his room; doing alchemy, completing his research, or reading. He had never seen the appeal of physical activities. But it´s not like he didn’t exercise. Twice a week the Academy held physical training, some light sparring with angel swords that he had never excelled at.
Cas closed his eyes for a moment, his insides a mix of embarrassment, wonder, horror, incredulity, panic...
Angels fell, Cas was human for some time, but recovered his Grace. Angels hated and hunted Cas for some time while Team Free Will looked for Metatron and a way to restore heaven. Third change is, no Abaddon, so no Mark of Cain- so Charlie is still alive, and has not met Cas yet. Rowena hasn’t ever appeared. Fourth change, they succeed in defeating Metratron without him killing Dean. Cas breaks the Angel Tablet in time for Dean to kill him with an angel blade. Metratron is dead cause I hate the bastard xD. Angel Tablet was destroyed into pieces by Cas in Heaven, and no one knows what happened to the Demon Tablet, since Metratron had it but he´s dead so he can´t tell.
“It’s been sixteen years since the last time I was sick”, Cas added with a small, apologetic smile, “And… I’m not really sure that counted as a sickness. I’m pretty sure I’m immune to venoms or poisons, too. My nature is healing, so… my body sometimes takes care of things on its own. If not, it takes just a thought to make it happen”
“Do you think Michael will lead the house, then?”, asked Cas frowning- to his knowledge, that hadn´t been settled yet.
“Yeah, man”, said Sam patting his shoulder, “You don’t have to start with that. You need to… regain some mental peace. Rest. Read”
The fire had leaped through the walls, through the ceiling, had started dripping down to the floor with the curling wallpaper and paint. It reached the boiler placed in the middle of the hallway of the second floor, and a sudden explosion could be heard several houses away.
“No!”
“And I do know something”
“So? What´s next?”, asked the hunter, “The castle´s your turf. The forest´s mine”
“Let´s move fast”, the hunter continued, clapping his shoulder, “All that noise could have scared some things away, but it could attract others”
“Cas says he´s not sure about the killing”, he provided, “That the abilities we mention do not match the Echidna´s feeding habits- wait a second, Cas. Thinks it could be a breed between an Echidna and a djinn”
“I´ve been thinking… Everyone always had those… jokes. Calling us… you know. That you were my boyfriend and that shit”, he thought of Meg, “That you were in love with me”, he thought of Balthazar, “All of those. And… I feel like an idiot, man. Maybe it was always there, and everyone saw it, but… not me. I guess it comes from my dad, you know. He always mocked gays. I did too, for some time. Later I met some people and, I don’t know, I realized it wasn’t that bad. But I never thought anyone close to me… Not that I´m saying there´s something bad”, he interrupted himself quickly, “There´s not. I just, never kept it in mind… as a real possibility. For anyone. Close. You know?”
“Shh!”, made Sam suddenly.
Between chitinous shields, the mage could see the black intersections of its articulated body. Two back-jointed legs, wider than the two on his abdomen, were there to hold its weight. The ones of the abdomen were smaller and arched strangely towards its back. The upper appendages ended in what resembled a mantis´s scythes- obviously resistant enough to stop the advance of the Impala.
Dean, feeling himself right there, had covered his head with his arms instinctively. When he lowered them, he saw two things.
“There´s… no catch, Dean”, murmured Cas, “I just… found you in the forest and brought you to heal you”
going to allow this son of a bitch to do more damage. Playtime was over.
“A… a boy!!”, he exclaimed, “A healthy boy! Healthy?”, he suddenly asked looking at Cas, “He´s healthy, right?”
“Hm…”, he said pensively, easing on the pressure he made on his face.
mad when he had seen Dean enter the Holy Fire Cage, instead of leaving.
“Can I have a look?”, the hunter asked.
“I… no”
“No”, the angel said very seriously, standing, “Something´s wrong”
Part 3- Starts when they find Sam. (...?)
“Another inch”
“You´re in a Doomed Forest, Castiel”, the hunter growled in a low tone, “You can´t let your guard down, not even if we´re resting.
you right now!!”
And he didn’t know how, but in that moment everything making perfect sense, he suddenly could see what was happening upstairs.
Castiel’s head was drifting. With his eyes closed, he could feel it spin slowly, as if he were lightheaded from having a little bit too much ambrosia. It could have been a nice sensation, if it were not interrupted at intervals by growing feelings of tension on his head, iron fingers that gripped it at the sides and top and squished till they made him grunt in discomfort, only to then relent after a second or two. He sighed. After several cycles, the pressure was lessening, and every time the bursts of pain took longer to arrive.
“Wow. Just like that. Without even talking to us”
“But maybe you´re right. Maybe…”, his distant gaze turned pensive, “Maybe the two humans that helped the new God be born could get some kind of reward. Just once”
The hit of shell against shell clanked in the forest, the wounded one bellowed in protest. Castiel observed in horror, lips parted, face slack, heart thumping furiously.
The flowerheads reeled back as the vines tensed, one of them breaking with a snap; and Cas screamed as he felt how the sudden tug almost cracked the bones on his legs. But it made the plant stop tugging so much for a second, which made Dean trip forward against the centipede. Suddenly not needing half of his strength to keep them in place, he planted his feet and pushed his sword forward- the Impala broke through the thing´s upper end with a satisfying crunching sound.
“Maybe we should call it a day”, he said as he turned back to the noble, “This is a good place to put the crystal thingy. No enemies close that I can see”
Dean was on the floor beside him, teeth gritting in pain, lying on his back. A centipede had gotten on top of him, its mandibles biting into his right arm. He punched it once, twice with his left as he grunted, the chitinous cover resisting the hits.
as the impact made the mantle of leaves of the forest ripple and spread out to the sides, the displaced wind shaking his hair.
She got to the center of the room with unhurried steps and stopped in front of her children, passing a look from right to left, gazing at each one of their faces for a moment. Then she made a little pleased smile, and continued walking to the next room, the Great Hall.
“Okay. Yes, sir”, he said with a tentative smile.
Castiel’s eyebrows raised slowly in understanding, to then turn into a sad frown.
Castiel frowned in frustration and worry. His eyes flicked between the abrasions on his arms, to the slash on his side. He held one of his shoulders a bit stiffly- maybe the clash between the two monsters had hurt one of his joints.
He shook his head a moment and then walked the perhaps four or five paces that separated the bluestone from the last woodland fiend the hunter had killed. He kneeled beside it, wrinkling his nose upon the stench of dead flesh.
Bobby had taken the bottle from his hands and opened it, poured them both a bit of scotch on their glasses, and left the bottle on the table.
“T’s okay, man”, Dean said as he shook the map to straighten it before he started folding it, “You did a hell of a show- you can have a damned break. But you gotta get yourself that tattoo we talked about”, he added in a slightly sterner tone.
Hope you enjoy!
“Hello, Dean”, he smiled at him.
Cas thought of his father for a second before smiling.
“Sure, honey. I will be right back”
A little pause followed his raspy voice.
Cas looked at him and then down to his drink.
Glinting white wings extended wide at his back, and though he couldn’t get any sensation from them, he could control them at will. For some more minutes, at least. Flying was, if he was honest to himself, the only time he felt truly free. He loved the feeling of the wind on his face, the thrill of speed as he lunged forward between the treetops and the clouds.
“How old were you?”
not to go out”, Dean snarled, “And I don’t see a bathtub anywhere!”
Dean scowled at his brother, not liking the conversation.
“It really depends on how well your body responds to the antidote”, he answered pensively, “Two days, maybe”
“Yes”
Dean locked eyes with his, breathing heavily, a little tremble to his legs. Cas took him gently by the shoulders, not really sure if he was kinda pushing his luck by physically impeding a confused and possibly violent stranger; and pushed back slowly but firmly, adding increasingly more force.
“So not very good, huh? Have you killed something with this? Ever?”
Life before comfort, he remembered Bobby told him often. He’d keep it. Unless some winter he got too damned cold and too damned hungry.
Dean huffed out a laugh.
And then… a certainty in his heart.
“My brother ́s there”
“Come on, I said I´d try, just give me a chance”, he jokingly continued, chuckling as he tried to catch more tears.
“Dammit…”, he rasped.
“Wow”, Dean said, stopping for a second to repress a burp, “Did you just compare nobles to monsters?”, he snickered.
Castiel, noble, healer and mage; found a hunter bleeding to death in the Forest of Wyvernon. He was bleeding to death, and the creature that bit him poisoned him, so Cas took him home to nurse him back to health. The hunter woke momentarily, told him his name, and said that him his brother Sam has been missing on a hunt for some days. Though Dean tried to leave right away, Castiel was able to convince him that he was too hurt to help anybody- if barely.
If someone is wondering what Cas said that made Sam laugh, its "Everything can breed, and wants to. Of all people, you would think he would know by now" xD
“I know it was different on the Angel War, okay? You had your army and all that shit, and we weren’t as close. But now we´re in the same team, man. Especially since Heaven has kicked your butt out. I´m not telling you to ask us for permission or that kind of crap. I get that sometimes, one´s gotta do what one´s gotta do. But… can you like, at least, not plan stuff behind our backs? Maybe tell us what you intend to do, if you have the chance?”
“He´s the one that brought everyone and everything”, Dean said in a proud tone.
The older hunter made a wide grin at that.
“Don´t worry, I have enough things on my mind to get into politics now”, he sighed.
“Okay, let´s all just… relax for a second”, said Dean with a dismissive wave of his hand, “Yeah, that thing´s there and we will kill it someday soon. But for once, we don´t have a huge doomsday on our hands. Crowley had a plan and we fucked it up. The angels are cozy on Heaven. Maybe we can just all, you know, take a break. It´s been a while since we dedicated some time to old-fashioned hunting. And monsters haven´t waited patiently until we finished our hellish/heavenly disputes. We got some work piled up”
The Road So Far:
“Come, my children. Let´s dine”
The mage looked at Dean with a gasp. The hunter was smiling from ear to ear, a sharp contrast to his previous humor.
Castiel shook his head in disapproval as his brother untied the sash and twirled it around his neck, using it as a scarf and hiding the revealing shirt and tunic.
He saw…
“Nada”, Dean answered with a disgusted grunt, “He should be back already. Like, days ago, man! But neither is he, nor the kids. So I got into the forest. I… found his trail and followed it to where you found me. I got into that fight cause those things were eating something, and I thought… It could… be him”
Cas looked up at him… and smiled slightly. It was amazing how often a question like
“I´d like to come with you”
“Get behind me”, he heard Sam tell Kevin urgently.
“Maybe something that will help the angels”, Cas speculated.
“Why?”, the hunter asked nonchalantly; but his tone was a bit more serious, and his eyes searching, “Have a deadline?”
“You sure? You´re not, uh, seeing things or…?”
“I´m mad because you inflicted horrendous wounds on yourself, Dean”, countered the angel, “If I had been too tired to heal you, you could have died there, at the mercy of our enemies”
But he heard a grunt of pain, and he froze. He looked back.
“Thank you”, she said with a small smile, and turned towards the end of the table, smile widening, “Samandriel, my youngest. How are your studies progressing?”
“Y-yeah…”
Castiel, with his head on Dean´s shoulder, saw him look down towards him and smile proudly.
The mage felt his guard lowering, his own annoyance fading as he gave Dean a compassionate small smile.
“Yarrow and turmeric”, the mage said then, making him look down- he was sniffing at the bottle at what looked like a second time, before a final confirmatory nod, “It is indeed the same formula of the healing potion you took the day the woodland fiends attacked you”
They didn’t stand a chance.
“Crowley”, he muttered, mouth suddenly dry, “H-How…?”
”, Dean barked in a low tone as he pointed.
“Do… Do you think… Sammy’s still alive?”, the hunter asked shyly, feeling embarrassed.
“Happy birthday, love”, said John, close to the kitchen door with a loving smile.
. You were taken by the Apocalypse
He was feeling the magic inside the feather in his pocket flicker a bit, warning him its energy would end relatively soon, when he heard a fading echo coming from the forest.
Dean chuckled.
“But this… is super expensive!”, she managed to babble finally.
The demon just smiled to himself, not stopping.
, he thought.
Cas gulped slightly, but pushed through his awkwardness to give a step forward.
The man looked back at Cas.
Dean´s eyebrows rose in understanding. It had been so damned long since any of them had mentioned Sam´s long-lost girlfriend. He cursed his damned stupid mouth for ever opening.
Dean took a breath and then let it out in a slow, calming sigh. As the last of his fears left him, he rubbed his mouth with his fingers - bad habit when you got as stained as he did in his business, he knew, but sometimes he couldn’t help it- before going down on one knee and picking something up.
“Fine! I am very proud of my progress. Today I managed to set a bush on fire, and kept it going for more than two minutes before I cleanly extinguished it”
”, Dean said in an eager tone, “You’re green as a pea but
“A human corpse”, he growled as he looked back at him with a glare.
Relief punching his guts, he let out a breath he didn’t know had been holding. For a second his eyes stung, and he needed a moment to find his voice.
and that any other family members were
!!”, he beamed at Castiel with the biggest smile the mage had ever seen in him, “That was
“I just… want to help. I’m glad to know I can”, he said, looking down shyly.
“Not me at least. It will wear off eventually, but I don’t think we can afford that kind of time”
Dean then snapped his eyes up. Sam was coming back.
He turned his eyes to him. Sam brother had his shoulders tensed, jaw clenched, probably lotta emotions boiling inside. Wondering.
He could blame it on the alcohol, he guessed. But deep down- he knew he hadn’t been
The noble walked to it and kneeled.
“To all of my minions. We appear to have an angelic intruder on aisle 6B. The one that gets me his wings, will get anything they desire granted”
“Playing decoy”, said Dean from somewhere behind him, “So we are on a timer here. He can´t face Crowley either. Chop, chop, Sam!”
Then he took the warrior on his arms, gripped him tight, and saved him from the forest; both disappearing in a blink.
Cas would always be bewildered by how different all his brothers looked from each other. Most had spiky hair like his, but some were blond, some had darker hair tones. Several of his siblings´ eyes were blue, like his, but Uriel´s were black- and Gabriel´s, honey golden.
Dean and Cas must have been connected somehow, because both of their mouths opened slightly upon the realization of… where this was going.
“So”, he looked at him wickedly as he wiggled his eyebrows, “what do you have in mind?”
“What?”, the angel asked in utter surprise.
The mage’s eyes widened and he grasped tighter on his blade.
- Michael here has the face of Jake Abel (Adam in the show, who does not exist in this universe as a Winchester brother)
Dean looked at him at that again.
They stopped at a sound.
I am really sorry I did not update this in such a long time. Its been a very hard time for me, both for personal reasons (Im sure everyone in the world is being as unlucky as me when it comes to personal tragedies cause *these two years, jesus*) and also in regards to the finale. I dont think Ill ever feel the same after those two episodes- but I think Im starting to recover, and to regain the love for this fandom and these little stories I made :) So I´m gingerly, slowly coming back to writing.
Disturbing.
Obviously Dean doesn't mind that there are people all around the campus with Cas's sweatshirts or t-shirts, it's just that he doesn't want him in his room, that's all.
Sam is still looking at him, the sun is anywhere in the sky to be seen, all is dark and Dean can see only thanks to the flames that keep burning the branches. It’s cold, there is only a little patch of moonlight and Dean totally doesn’t understand why the moon keep shining if everything inside him is dark. It doesn’t seem right.
“I don’t understand, Dean was his… boyfriend?” the last word slip from his mouth like it was fake, empty and without meaning. He says it with a strange accent, the memory of hearing it only one time, accidentally, in same sort of conversation before his birth.
He hopes with all of himself that maybe Cas didn’t get the double meaning that he can swear, he had no intention of doing since we have already established that Dean hates him and would have no interest in sleeping with someone like him.
“You told me good things do happen Cas, you were right. You were my good thing”.
Dean laughs so hard that he would feel ridiculous if only he wasn't so drunk. He is not used to drinking and has definitely knocked out too many glasses of peach vodka for his taste. It was Cas's idea given that, according to him, Dean is not the type who can handle alcohol a lot. Obviously vodka is okay if you swallow less than half a bottle of it. They are past that from a while now.
Dean would respond but he doesn’t want absolutely to give at the stranger the satisfaction of an answer. Above all Dean doesn’t want to start any discussion about life and its problems in front of the ocean.
"You look like that kind of guy, actually ," Castiel says only, and Dean is too tired to even pretend he does not care, so he looks into the blue in front of him with an obvious question in his eyes.
He would like to resist a little longer, force Dean to go through at least a minimum of what he has been through but seeing him in this state, seeing him move against him, is starting to drive him crazy. He grabs his wrist and turns Dean towards him, one of his hands immediately falls on his ass and squeezes it tightly, as he dreamed of doing for months now, bringing their bodies as close as possible.
That night he get out of his room only to bring some water to Sammy, he’s was thirsty not even Dean and instead of some water he found himself a nice childhood trauma.
It is not just any book. Obviously, it had to be the Book, his absolute favorite. The first book his mother gave him and obviously had to fall on the grass close to the boy who is now staring at him.
He has this strange smile that takes all his face and makes this little dimple at the corner of his mouth. Dean can't help but notice how much everything is too adorable, but he have to stay strong so he looks away because he shouldn't really notice these things.
He does it just for a moment, just long enough to drive Dean crazy more than he already is. Dean really just want to impale himself on his roommate's cock at this point, but Cas seems so determined to bring him to the brink of a nervous breakdown, especially when he suddenly gets up and leaves him on the bed with his legs open, naked and alone.
out already!”, he grunted, yanking one of them from Cas´s back and throwing it into the flames by mere brute strength.
The hunter suddenly looked at him, frowning.
“And it’s certainly practical, if we have to move”, the mage added looking around.
The mage scowled and raised both arms in a wide circle, fingers curling as if he was grabbing the whole world.
. Back in the bunker. Back home.
“Nah, not for now… Thanks”
“And check your surroundings”, Dean reminded him with an amused smile on his lips as he turned his gaze to the front.
He pursed his lips… Why the hell not. He had the time. And if Cas kicked him out, this might be his last chance.
“Not yet, mother”, he answered in a guarded, gentle tone.
But the hunter´s smile widened, welcoming, predatory, and eager.
The word made him think of Sam, and the weight that had hung from his heart since the moment he’d realized with a that his brother should have come back already tugged relentlessly down. He put both his hands on the sink and let his head hung down.
He suddenly saw a vine rise in front of him, and he instinctively screamed as he pushed his hands forward; a pulse of force brushed the vine away. He remembered the plant in a panic. Wasn’t it bad enough to fight the endregas but also…?
Several whines were covered by a big booming sound that echoed in the trees, and suddenly Cas was free. But as he sat up trembling, his balance wavered, and his head started to pulse to the rhythm of his frantic heart. He froze for a second.
He tiredly guessed that was a problem for future Castiel.
“D-Dean…!”
Cas looked at him with sad eyes and then lowered them to the ground. Dean sighed and walked back to him.
“I´m having a servant come”, he said walking to the door and turning back to him, “You should…”
, holy shit- was smiling into the road, into the future, hands resting on the leather seat.
His heart stopped for a second before leaping forward. He took the metal bar again and hit down, roaring with all his rage. The angrier he got, the harder he could hit, and the crack extended an inch, three inches, under his rage.
“Yeah... I-I mean, it´s gonna be a cute little
broke something, the spell, the whatever thing that had locked him in place; his face broke into a smile and he advanced a step to hug him. Like so many other times when they had thought they´d lost each other. After Purgatory. After Cas´s death at the hands of Lucifer. When Dean returned after confronting Amara and God.
“Blast force!”, Dean ordered as he pointed in one direction.
Dean took a deep breath and let out a sigh as he sat on the bed. At least things weren’t so awkward anymore.
“Awesome, now help me search”, he said as he walked past the mage, his steps brisk.
So like, yeah some changes too- it's Sam who's 4 when Mary dies and not Dean. But I needed that so that Sam was old enough to be like, smart and problem-resolutive when the Darkness got to him, or then the war would have been too long. And we needed some time without war for the people to settle, so the characters would have had to be even older, and that would have made Michael and Lucifer like 45 and that was too damned much xD I wanted Dean and Cas to be younger than me cause it felt weird if they werent?? And the war had to be short enough so Samandriel could be born, since Cas's dad fought there and left half way... Well, it was a mess but I'm happy how it turned out xD
“I have to...”, Dean said, sitting up.
Leave some kudos/small comment to give a boost of serotonin and energy to an stressed and broke student/writer that just got her laptop broken and lost a bit of what she last wrote xD I hope you like this one!!
“Exactly my point”, Castiel sighed, looking down, “Zachariah’s power was
He wanted to find him quickly. He wanted the disgusting repellent and the potions and Castiel’s abilities and his stupid map. He knew going refreshed to every hunt due to good rest and good food made him a better tracker. The noble hadn’t lied about being able to help- and Dean wanted every advantage to find Sammy.
I love adding images to the fic, but I´m usually conflicted about if I have the right? Specially with fanart- those I won´t share unless I know I have explicit permission from the author (and artistically that sucks cause I have so many images that served as inspiration and would help with visualization, but my conscience wont let me). I actually had someone drawing the characters for me at the beginning of all of this, but they went MIA and since Im not sure I still have their permission, those images are gone now (their pretty clooothes :( But you gotta do things right!). But since I´m not as conflicted when using images from game guides, they only have screenshots of the game itself, using their monsters has an added advantage aside from "how do I create a monster now" xD
His enthrallment broke when something touched him.
“The old Laws of Hospitality?”, he asked unbelievingly.
to an angel that has lived, what, millennia?, I don’t even care. But to us, man, that´s
“Sam? Dean!”, a muffled voice could be heard.
”, groaned Cas, closing his eyes as he panted, “Just… give me a minute”
“Mmph?”
He turned around, closed his eyes for a second as he shook his head, and closed the door behind him.
And well, this things with Dean only came with alcohol, probably because it’s the only friend that’ll never abandon him.
"Sorry I forgot the color of my toothbrush" was the excuse of his supposed-to-be-roommate, bastard.
“Hi, bitch”
Chuck found himself looking at Castiel, one of his angels, one of those characters put there only to serve the plot for a few scenes, to grab the soul of what was once a man and open his eyes (Well at least figuratively speaking, not that he really had eyes at that moment or a hand with which to grab Dean's shoulder but it had become so poetic that he just couldn't help but put that little detail in the story. Who doesn't love a romantic subplot).
He hasn't even left his chair to go to sleep, it's late at night when Dean opens his eyes and notices him.
One of the longest separation between Cas and Dean was the year in purgatory. Year full of research, prayers and tortures. Year pretty useless, throw in Dean face when Cas decided to stay. Even that time he came back, with the angels in his head and the absurd want to be an hunter.
When Cas found out, he laughed so hard that Dean didn't talk to him for three days. It is a sensitive topic for him but his roommate certainly cannot know. Dean has always been more than good at specifying that the limits imposed between them also concern personal things.
This time Dean doesn’t want to keep anything, all was gone with Cas. That horrible trench coat, that stupid tax collector tie, everything. The last time Dean brought his trench with him in Baby’s trunk, around America, because Cas always find a way to come back. But he’s never die like this.
Dean... Dean was supposed to be just the son of the man who was supposed to bring the Apocalypse, one of those characters that everyone would love even if he died too soon in the story for anyone to really miss him.
"What?”
The last two times Dean hasn't even bothered to hide his satisfied smirk when two girls went away with their tails between their legs and disappointment in their eyes.
Dean has no words, really.
Or maybe the problem is not hell, maybe no matter how far away Castiel is sent from Dean Winchester, they will always find each other in the end and this is damn frustrating.
Dean thought about it a lot and he never found the right answer, especially because a child that ear his mom say, “
Okay, Cas tried.
"Not that I meant... I'm not saying that one day I'll ask you to ... I mean, I would never ask you to touch-"
There is this strange calm in the air in this seafront a couple of hours after the sun goes down.
Cas is not Stark team but Dean cannot have everything and he’s pleased nonetheless.
They’re all massed up, his white shirt is completely rumpled, his eyes empty and a bit glassy.
Dean would like to stop her but he is so tired that he allows it to happen. He doesn't know why, since he has known her for exactly three minutes, but he already trust her.
The next day the fever dropped but not enough yet and Cas keeps putting that stupid wet hand towel on his forehead claiming that it is the most important thing to do in situations like these.
“Yes but, I read something you know. He seems like a bigshot from Sales, he was one of the Head Departments in New York. Do you remember last month? That big contract for which everyone was happy?”
“Dean…” he knows Sam and Jack are staring at him, obviously he doesn’t care. He simply decided to ignore the Nephilim at the moment, there are a lot of things to think about right now. Most of all in his head.
He doesn’t know exactly when he stopped believing in people but he can still remember how he liked to looking into their eyes and search that sparkle that makes everyone so special. The sparkle that makes you understand that each person has a story to tell, something to share.
room and the other part of that
"Drink" he intimates in a sweet tone and Dean nods, trying to raise his neck high enough not to wet the pillow.
Going through the administration office, avoiding falling at least three more times - really what are his problems? - he pauses once more to look at the building. There are three, all close and all equal to each other.
He certainly could not have known that this moment would definitively change the course of history.
“Nice to meet you, Dean”
After Lucifer killed Castiel again (or better, Chuck had Lucifer kill Castiel again) he decided to call it quits. Too many times he had brought him back to life and honestly the story was completely getting out of hand.
Cas starts fucking him faster, so hard that Dean is rambling phrases neither of them bother to understand.
"Insightful, Cas"
“Maybe you should worry about your crappy day” Dean says, pointing to the crumpled shirt. The stranger just shrugs, as if he does not really care to look like someone just got out of a brawl. He puffs a small cloud of smoke in the air and follows it with his eyes until it dissolves completely and then turns to Dean.
Even if he had to expect it, this story was going to hell for too long now (well ironically it's exactly where it will end).
Well and that’s not usually a big deal, it's just that he normally wears hoodies and Dean is already struggling to see those obscene arms when they are at home, let alone if they have to spend the evening together in a crowded place that will make it inevitable for both to touch each other.
Dean puts his soul into everything he does, he commits himself so much that he’s often surprised of his own results.
Dean could say a lot of things, all those things he never said to Cas, their stolen glances, those feelings they never shared to each other, but the only thing Dean can think right now is “I lost him, this time for good”.
Dean grew up with those four sentences spinning round and round in his head till they became his personality, the way he socialize with people, what drives him to behave in a certain way in practically all aspects of his life.
The hunter imposed on them the quickest pace they could manage given the treacherous footing, and the whole time his eyes never stopped raking over the ground, the trunks, the bushes. Castiel reminded him soon that they had to reapply the repellent, and Dean put it on with no more complaint nor delay than a disgusted wrinkled nose. They quickly resumed their walking.
The dismay Cas felt must have shown, because Dean muttered a curse and pushed firmly Cas away to rise to his feet.
He remembered there was an enemy nearby, an… an enemy that had hurt… who…?
“As if I cared”, Dean said as he drank again.
“Yeah, that was me”, he answered with half a smile.
And to his enormous surprise, Lucifer turned concerned eyes to him.
“And you think the kids are in a place such as that?”, Castiel asked, worry in his voice.
?”, he said, squinting at him with that smile betraying his serious face, “I guess it’s hard to resist”
And he dragged Cas through the opening just before the circle closed in again. They both started running with the frenzied pack a step behind them, a wave of roaring creatures in their pursue.
Dean simply nodded at that.
Then he closed his eyes and laughed up to the sky, somehow making it a whole-body movement, hand palming his thigh.
“Don´t think about it too much, Sammy. Not good for anyone”
“Awful”, he sighed, and looked down at his hands, “The shadows got inside me and I felt they were going to make me explode… But Pestilence was worse”
Dean could not stop smiling from ear to ear. As moments passed, his mother was more and more awed, looking at the rock and the angel alternatively.
, he thought,
needed to change things was
“I´d like to examine your physical state now. If you see no inconvenience”
“It´s just a human thing”
“What?”, repeated Dean in confusion.
“Well done, buddy”
Castiel pressed his lips, jaw tight, an almost unbearable frustration building up. Dean frowned at his expression and his hands balled into fists.
Obviously, that was not enough to keep up with a hunter running in the wilderness.
Dean didn’t stop his smile from conquering the rest of his face as he took the glass and sipped from it. He immediately moaned with his eyes closed.
The mage looked at him in horror- he thought they could have been
“A bit better. Tired”
“Leaving so soon?”
“Cas. Cas!”
“Thank you”, said the mage inclining his head.
“Let me go find a mirror”, she said as she started to walk out of the kitchen.
“Oh, it really wasn´t”, said the angel shaking his head, “See, it´s expensive because it´s very difficult to find, and dangerous to acquire. It only forms under very determined circumstances, in the slopes of active volcano mountains, and it dissolves with rain. So in the few places where it does grow, it disappears quickly if the climate is adverse. And there are no many people eager to go fetch it to the volcanoes… I´m sorry”, he quickly added, frowning, “You probably know this already if you are a mineral enthusiast. It is not my intention to…”, he looked over to Dean as if trying to remember a word, “… angelsplain”
be useful or not, in search of any scrap of information anyone could have missed. Excluding the scholars whose work he was already familiar with, few people had stopped to take many notes during the Plagues, and the recollection of past events was often contaminated by the subjective experiences of the writers. He set aside yet another useless journal with a little sigh. His personal notes lay patiently to his right.
“I… hadn´t thought of it that way…”
“Yes. I…”
than my sword…”, the hunter grunted as he scratched his head.
“That makes me glad”, said the angel fondly, so much care in his voice.
“You’re telling me that when you become an
Suddenly Dean had recoiled nervously, taking his hands with him, looking away. Was he blushing? Holy fucking crap. And
“Mum, you remember Cas, right?”
“I, Castiel of the House of the Mighty, give you my word”, continued the mage.
resounded as some unseen force flung the hound from the angel, against a wall, from where he fell to the flames and screamed as he writhed in pain as the flames consumed him. Cas gritted his teeth for a second, doubling in pain and fatigue, but shot a look up as a demon appeared in front of him, blade already flying down.
“I… I am so sorry”, he said again, “Then… I will provide you with anything you need to repair it. I can take it to the castle´s blacksmiths. I… will find a way to explain why I need them to fix a hunter´s sword. But I will fix this, Dean”
Castiel looked down with a slight sadness on his features.
“Only if we… are too loud. Stone walls…”, Cas murmured clumsily, and rose his gaze to the hunter in awe, “You… saved me”
“Not that I intended to run away, Crowley. This fight is between you and me”
“I did not say such thing”
And then Castiel had frozen.
“No”, he answered in that sassy tone that had worked before for him, “It just looks unsanitary”
The hunter got into the room and dragged a chair from a little desk so that it was close to the bed and facing it, and plopped into it with wide-spread knees.
“To him not being busy, then”, he said handing him the glass, “To all of us being able to do this more often”
The warrior blinked at Cas as he walked to the worktable, then looked down to himself and put a hand to the bandages that covered his abdomen.
“Won´t that delay things even more?”, grunted the hunter slightly.
“We need to go!”, he screamed, running back to Sam and Jess.
“You… you assume too much. Too fast. You assumed…”, he complained, and he knew he was not making any sense, but he couldn’t be more coherent than that, he looked up at him intensely, “You never told me”
The mage frowned in confusion. Dean was sitting on his desk chair, having put it against the wall beside the desk to look towards him, and had a big tome open on his lap.
“Amen”, echoed the boys.
. As if things were suddenly slowed down; he saw the creatures crouch, their ears fold to their craniums, their fangs being bared…
“I… I try to”
“There’s no blood past that stone”, Dean provided at his confused eye squinting.
“H-how to lock up Heaven, cast the angels out. It´s… a spell…”
Cas… just blinked at that, mind blank.
“I´ll leave with you!”, roared Dean as he sliced a neck and backpedaled two steps to avoid a hound´s bite.
”, Cas blurted, almost too quickly to understand.
“Sure I won’t”, the hunter growled with a wicked smile.
Cas stared wide-eyed for a second. He´d never seen Lucifer display emotions that could be cataloged as weaknesses. But his brother… was afraid. He was coming to him for counsel… because he was afraid about his future.
“Okay”, Cas smiled at him, “I can send the message right now, and as we wait for an answer I can maybe make you a potions and give you some food so that…”
“Sammy left eight days ago, Cas!”, Dean said excitedly, “We’re only like, five days behind him. We have gained all the time I spent laying horizontal, and a bit more!”
The mage’s eyes flickered towards the cave, worry on his features. Then he pressed his lips as he frowned, determined, and shook his head once.
“Do I pass the test?”, he deadpanned unamused, glaring at the hunter.
“Nothing”, said Sam, still smirking, his attention away from his brother, “Okay. You think that will work…? Well, guess there´s just one way to find out... Yeah, yeah, we will… Okay. Don´t worry, Cas, we got this… Yeah. ´kay, call you soon”
“And you use it for
“A bag of containing?”, asked Dean bewildered, “That´s…!”
“Of course I do”, protested Cas.
“But I mean it, man, you deserve some rest, come on. You did great today”
And they both vanished.
“Where are you??!!”
“Yep. No wonder you don’t know it, they’re not common. Hadn’t found one in years. Though, it’s true that they stay hidden till they sense a juicy prey”
, Dean though,
“Cause I think you got Corrupted”, he deadpanned.
that you kinda
… Trying to steal my tablet?”, he said in an incredulous tone.
“Dude, the war left
Dean blinked at him as he passed by.
. After three or four minutes Cas started to get winded, but he magically asked his lungs to provide more oxygen for him. After ten minutes, his legs started complaining, and he muted their demands by numbing the pain. Now, he had no idea how long they had run- but he was honestly starting to wonder if he would get Corrupted by using magic simply to keep up the damned pace.
“Dude. Don´t wander off into the forest following a bee”, Dean´s dry voice sounded a bit far from him.
, he thought, unable to stop grinning to himself like an idiot.
He walked to a little string that hung close to the bed and then got inside a hole in the wall. He pulled from it, and in some place outside, a little bell rang.
Castiel finally caught up and his expression turned into a frown.
Then he realized he was not keeping his guard at all, and opened his eyes again. Dean was swinging the bag of holding over his shoulder. He looked back at Cas, as if wondering what the hell was he still doing there.
without good reason. He had not graduated yet. He was no combat expert.
”, he finally said.
“For the last time, we are not calling him
Well, I am back :) I'm still marching at full speed with Kingdom of Heaven, but I have decided I will try to keep uploading this one. I reread it and... damn, I thought it was such trash when I stopped writing; but this time I honestly liked it. Maybe it´s a self-esteem thing? Anywho, I've decided that this one is worthy too, and it also deserves to be born ^^ I can´t keep a clean-cut schedule for both, so this one will still be updated following a bit more the rhythm of inspiration. But I´m not burying it anymore as I intended till now :)
as offspring was born. No studies that Castiel had ever read had given a clear explanation of why- it was just the way things were. The firstborn was always the strongest one, the second one a bit less. The first four sons of a House were always distinctly more powerful than the rest, and they were known as the Four Stars- Morningstar for the first one, Eveningstar for the second, Northernstar and Southernstar for the next ones. After four children, power significantly diluted; but in a world where every mage was valuable, having a huge amount of offspring was almost mandatory amongst the nobility.
“I am a nobleman of the kingdom, and a server of the Lord”, he said firmly, “My family is the most magically gifted of the nobility”
One of the flames was steady, tall, orange… normal. The other… had flickered. Turning blue, shrinking, then suddenly as tall and orange as its twin. Cas advanced one step, very alert, worry nagging on him. The flame flickered once again, very briefly, to then go back to be steady and calm. It danced around, then the other one started dancing too… and both died down. The ritual had ended.
“Nothing happened, don’t worry”, he said after clearing his throat, pinching his eyes and wrinkling his nose in an effort to stop a couple of tears that had managed to swim through.
“And… your magic does not work like that?”, Dean asked curiously, watching him intently.
“You´re blushing, Dean”, Cas informed.
The mage’s eyebrows raised a bit in surprise… Then a pleased smile spread on his face as he looked away, towards the cauldron again.
“Yes. Rendered useless, as many angels thought. Difficult to get all the chips and chunks, the dust even, I have to say”, he mentioned while turning the tablet around, as if inspecting it… and finding it of acceptable quality.
“You´re a noble”, Dean started to say slowly, eyes slightly squinted, as if the thoughts were difficult to puzzle together, “belonging to the richest family of nobles. That so happened to pass through the forest I was being mauled on. And took me to his… bed to heal me”, finished with an incredulous tone.
“See how it stops staining the leaves a few steps forward?”, he continued, a knowing smile tinting his words.
“And no one knows exactly where souls are, right?”, his brother continued “So, what if I get like, a transplant and… I get someone else´s soul in me? Like, a bit of someone else, bugging me? Could that even happen?”
*My guilty pleasure, I am going nowhere,
Dean clasped his hands over the mouth and nose of the guy, pinning his arms down to the floor with his knees and keeping his body by sitting on his chest. His legs trashed, and his fists started to hit awkwardly his thighs, but Dean kept pressing.
“Okay. Thanks, Cas. Right back at´cha”, he gave him half a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
He swallowed, realizing why Crowley had made the cage so big… How many demons, how many hellhounds could fit inside that and attack him all at once?
“You”, he said in a dangerous tone, “healed all of us, not just before healing your vessel. Also before healing
Castiel closed the door and hurried away.
This was gonna be
Cas reacted after the booming sound, looking wildly in all directions.
Dean opened his eyes and blinked away the dots the pressure of his fingers on them had created. The tears were at bay. He then realized how fucking weird this must seem from Charles´s point of view. Calling her in the middle of the night. He glimpsed at the phone screen. Jesus, it was 2 am.
Dean opened his eyes and looked at him, hesitating a bit at that, a hand to his bandages. Cas tried to push him to the mattress by pressing gently on his chest. He looked away, but still did not lie back.
“Cas, you know… You don´t need a mission to be… you know. Okay. Good”, the angel looked at him, “Maybe… what you need to do is that. Find out yourself what you wanna do”
“But you healed me”, said Dean angry, “Before healing your
“Says you brought her a gift”, John finally raised his eyes to the angel.
it. That’s why getting him to explain was like pulling teeth.
“Thank you, Dean. It really isn’t important. You don´t have to worry”
His eyes were wide, panic on his face. Why had he said that? He had intended to assure Dean he would not condemn him for something that as a doctor he knew was natural and innocuous, that if he was attracted to men it was obvious he wouldn´t be an illiterate homophobe; but instead he had just… blurted out…
“… saying it couldn´t happen someday”, he muttered quickly.
The young kid looked at the angel in distress.
“Thank you”
“How is that frigging possible? Didn’t you wreck it?”
“That’s where the High Academy of Magic is”, Cas commented.
Suddenly there was warmth, softer light, familiar smells… but the weight and growling still remained.
“What?”
“But you just don´t have the homefield advantage, kids”, Crowley continued, hands on his back; and ordered, “Squeeze a bit, honey”
“It´s not such a big deal”, he grunted, “I just… don´t know you either. I took risks bringing you here. I thought that if I kept you in the dark, I could have a better handle on the situation. I honestly did not expect you to need more than some hours of therapy. That you just… would be sleepy and not bright enough to realize… things”
“The one that´s been active for the past three years”, Dean could not help but add in an excited whisper.
“We gotta take a detour”, Dean said as he veered to the right, a few steps from the course of water.
Then Dean took the offensive. He charged towards two wolves, in his wake two bodies hit the ground. He whirled over his feet, swords flying around him, parallel to the ground: a wolf that was already jumping onto his back got twin killing blows to its face. The hunter walked back a step and dove into a roll to dodge an attack. As he got up, both blades crossed in front of him to slash to both sides as he jumped forward towards an enemy. Roars raised as a body fell with a thump into the leaves. The hunter immediately whirled, burying the angel blade on the head of a wolf that was jumping into his back; his sword immediately hacking in a wide horizontal arc scratching two creatures at his right, making them retreat a step. He retrieved the angel blade, facing his left, jumped back dodging a bite.
Dean glared at him, tilting his head in incredulity.
He closed his eyes with a moaned sigh. The adrenaline spike was leaving him, and the pain of all his wounds was starting to register and clutter his mind. His shoulder probably wasn´t killing him, but it sure as hell felt like that. However, his torn leg constituted a new record for him on the pain scale. He gritted his teeth as he kept panting through them.
One: in the explosion, a screw had flown away in deadly speed from the boiler… and gone through Bobby´s head. The old hunter laid sitting against the wall, a trickle of blood on the white paper, head lolling to the side, looking as if someone had shot him on the head.
Sam gulped.
Now, about today´s story- bit of a long chapter, but we are getting into *important passages* with important details, and we are finally getting to the pieces that are gonna hold the very center of the fic. I first visualized this in October, and finally in March we are getting there. I am so happy ^^ (People, don´t ever write longfics if you can´t deal with waiting and frustration- trust me! xD)
He saw, panic rising, how the pupils in the center of Gabriel´s golden orbs turned into slits, like the ones of a beast. He tilted his head… and inhaled sharply, sniffing.
At the sound of the door, Dean whipped his head violently towards the mage.
But that was advanced shit. He smiled at Cas, who looked a bit overwhelmed as he searched the ground.
“Y-yeah, of course”, Kevin frowned slightly at that, but nodded.
“So we leave your father stranded here at the house?”, she said arching an eyebrow, as if she were actually considering it.
“Please, Gabriel. I´m really tired, and I want to return to my room”, he said in a serious tone, walking past him.
“So... you like it?”, he said with hopeful eyes.
“It was my pleasure, and it cost me nothing. Ellen and Jo had everything already set, all I did was move it”
“Some arms to twist, some bargains to make”, he shrugged, “Nothing too fancy”
“Want some drugs?”
“Good”, Cas finally answered, his gaze falling down, his movements sharp.
“It´s just me and Sam”, he cut him off.
The healing mage squinted and tilted his head, concentrating.
He had to
“Freshly healed, remember? What about you?”
It would have been too low for any human to hear, but he knew Cas could. And that he could come to him. Not like him. He… His legs were locked in place for some reason. He suddenly appeared in front of him, and he was so nervous he even flinched a bit, eyes wide open.
“And also… I rejected it”, the angel added.
The Darkness had been less extensive than the Apocalypse because it had only affected people that were outdoors. But those who it had found under the sky…
And under Dean´s confused look, he put his good hand on the glass. An invitation. No demands, just an offering.
“It’s different”, he finally said, eyes lost in the middle distance in concentration, “I know that I will have to fight, and kill, for survival. So yes, if at some point I need to eat, I will kill too. But… that is not the case right now”
“Who?”, asked Gabriel with a guarded expression.
He´d also made the bed, and tidied up whatever medical supplies he had left out of their places while healing Dean. A fire was crackling in the fireplace, warm and welcoming. He had taken all the junk he had left earlier on his worktable and somehow found space for all his normally unused utensils in drawers and chests, leaving out only the little black cauldron in the middle of the table. To one side, two new potions bubbling in burners…
Cas smiled fondly at him. Samandriel was the youngest of them all, the last son, and that implied he was the least powerful of all of them. Nevertheless, he trained constantly, working hard every day to surpass the low expectations everyone had put on him since he was born. And he was managing. What he lacked in raw talent, he was compensating through effort and will.
“I´m just saying, this… training, this learning you want. You must care a lot about it”, he said as his eyes wandered over the trees again.
“Thank you”
“Nice to meet you, Dean”, he said smiling more with his eyes than his lips, “How are you feeling?”
His angel blade slashed left, right, spewing trails of blood that shone with the light of the reddish flames, two bodies went down. Other two demons attacked him and he dodged one, kicked the other, and then he sunk his blade into mid-air: a whining, doggie sound rose against the roar of fire.
“Did you know that those who peel the labels off the bottles are sexually frustrated?”
“The bench is taken”
"You were good, Dean" is all he lives for.
"What do you want, Dean?"
"Dean ... Dean"
“And you really seem the typical guy who goes around doing stupid personal questions to people he barely knows at two in the morning” Dean answers, he doesn’t look at the stranger yet but he takes back his lighter and put it in his jacket pocket. Dean keep losing every lighter he buys, losing one now, for some drunk guy sitting on
Looking at them now, with the world that once again, for one last time, is ending around them, Chuck can not but recognize that he lost on this.
Castiel, always Castiel, who in the most absurd and less likely way was slowly starting to turn his back on his family, the one that Chuck himself had created for him, the angels, to follow the ideals of a rebellious character who does not believe in himself but believes in his brother, in his family, which he has chosen and built himself and more importantly, in free will.
"Yes, Dean?" his hoarse voice is directly blown on his neck, with those two words Dean is already reduced to the limit and it is a rather shameful thing, honestly. He can feel Cas’ smile on his skin and immediately becomes aware of the fact that Cas is playing with him, testing him. The thing should annoy him instead it only causes in him the desire to remove that smile from Cas’ mouth in a very inappropriate way.
And yes, Dean is clumsy to the limits of the impossible but not that much.
obvious hypothesis that he is in fact the new manager of his company.
It's not his fault, really. It's just that He created souls for humans, never for him and if there is one thing he learned at his expense, over time it is that often the feelings, those that make souls a little brighter, beautiful, they are always unpredictable.
Yes, now they have even started having dinner together. It does not matter what their commitments are, it’s now customary that they wait for each other even if it is not a totally official thing.
He takes off Dean's shirt with a quick gesture, almost offended with himself for not having done it before and Dean quickly lowers Cas' pants, sliding them down from his thighs and then continuing to take them off with his feet.
And he can't help to agree with Castiel, not that it doesn't bother him.
He slightly regrets having accepted the invitation when he sees Cas near the door looking at his phone with a stupid smile on his face, he is probably watching one of those videos on kittens or bees that he likes so much.
At least until now.
"I was already sleeping," he mumbles, changes position on the chair and Dean can't help but notice the slight expression that passes on his face when he tries to straighten his back or move his legs. He looks like he’s really uncomfortable.
When he comes back to lie down, Dean is looking at the ceiling with the most beautiful and satisfied smile in the world.
When Dean finds the physical strength to move again and remember that he exists and has a body, the courtyard is practically empty. It's almost dinner time but the only thing he can think of is finding his room and settling down as he wish.
When he returns from his well-deserved hot shower, there is a steaming soup on their little table near the sofa. He takes a seat next to Cas with a small embarrassed yet grateful smile on his face. Cas pretends not to notice it and Dean does the same when his roommate hand. It’s a gentle touch, right behind his neck, his fingers brushing his hairs, still wet after a shower.
"You know what I mean"
Today, as usual Dean is late and as usual he needs the bathroom.
And at that moment he realized that perhaps he had to change strategy.
But no, Chuck hadn't taken one thing into account. A small and insignificant thing that in the end was able to change everything and completely rewrite his story: Sam.
Yes, maybe he exaggerates sometimes but once he found Castiel go through his things in his closet because according to him their clothes mixed at same point in the laundry and he had lost a denim shirt.
When he's finally all in, he's not ready for the sensation. Dean is so hot and tight that he has to wait a while before starting to move, which is impossible for him since his roommate is anything but an example of patience and increasingly tired of waiting, he starts moving by himself, in small, timid movements that only make Cas lose control more. It looks like Dean is asking for permission to take it, as if up until two seconds ago he wasn't literally begging to be fucked.
Perfect, the pain, Castiel's trembling voice and Dean's devastated gaze looking in Cas’ shining eyes. Even better than he could have imagined it.
You don't spend the last decades of your immortal life writing and programming every line, every plot twist just for seeing your own story completely turned upside down by one of your characters, one that at the beginning wasn’t even so important.
“I told you… I told you good things don’t happen”
Charlie sits on Dean’s left and makes a face.
"In a bit, maybe"
"Yes, I am Dean" he adjusts the shoulder strap on his back. Everything is becoming too heavy and every second that passes he feels that his arms will give up at any moment. Charlie notices it, goes around the table and takes the heavy box in his hands.
but Dean is not listening. His ears are full of his sobs, his eyes full of water that can’t come down.
It's a night like any other and Dean is by the sea, sitting at his usual bench somewhere in the middle of the eight miles of beach facing the ocean. It's all calmer than usual, perhaps because it's so late that even in such a big city the time comes for everyone to sleep.
bench, is just a waste.
The agreement above provides that the bathroom is free in the early morning, when Dean, always late, have to run to class. He still has the chills after the last time. There was a blonde girl with only Cas's shirt on (which it itself is already terribly annoying), and his toothbrush in her mouth, HIS fucking toothbrush.
Awesome.
Dean stops for a moment, hesitant about what to do but then he turns and "Dean, my name is Dean".
If he had put them on the right path by accompanying them to make the choices he wanted, perhaps the story could still be saved, it could go as it really had to go.
Obviously, he had to stumble between the cracks in the sidewalk bricks, it is an essential step to make a good impression when you move to a new school and you have to make new friends. Not that he cares so much, though.
Turns out losing one of their most important clients doesn’t piss off only Dean but even the Capital One Investing headquarter.
He is now in a somewhat complicated situation; on one hand he would like to gather the book on his own so he doesn't have to pay attention to the boy in front of him. He already seems too pleased with this situation and Dean doesn’t want to draw more attention to himself beyond that which he already has.
It's just that he doesn't want to let this Castiel discover his literary tastes, it's not that he is ashamed, it's just that... not really that book, come on.
“Cas, I…”
Which is quite impossible considering that Dean has a list of things he washes and has no intention of losing his belongings or taking stuff that is not his by mistake.
She does this weird expression with her face when Dean tells her the number of his new room but he is too tired to ask questions. At the moment he just wants to unpack his things, take a nice shower and sleep at least until tomorrow.
And they continued to save each other, to cover their backs in front of every obstacle Chuck put on their path to separate them and at some point it stopped being fun.
The stranger raises his eyebrows. He expects a reply but Dean’s only reaction is another eye roll.
"We have already talked about the boundaries inside the apartment and if there is one thing I hate it is the people who invade my personal space, and by personal space I mean that you cannot touch my things, especially my bed or my body, unless I have explicitly told you before "
“Well, this seems to me the right moment to tell you. At the end you’re dead and it doesn’t matter anymore. I love you and I don’t love you like a brother Cas, or like a friend. That were all bullshit. I love you and that’s all and I was a stupid son of a bitch not to tell you, Cas. I’m sorry, really Cas, sorry. I didn’t deserve you, I never did but doesn’t matter know so I can tell you. Yes, I can tell you”.
He touches it too much with his hands and Dean tries really hard not to get nervous. He hates when people touch his things, especially if the people in question have their dirt-wet fingers on his precious cover and then we are talking about his books, of his Book. He is so obsessed with it that when he reads them he tries not to open the pages too much so as not to ruin or wrinkle them and now he is forced to see a stranger handling it with so little care. Dean can feel his eye twitching.
, is there like it doesn’t mean nothing. It’s weird and even pathetic but Dean can swear that since Cas has saved him from hell, in any circumstances he
It’s with this same though in his head that at three to ten he reaches the elevator of his floor and blocks the doors with his paper folder before they close.
Even heel couldn’t break him.
No matter how many times he prayed to Chuck, how many punches on the wall and bloody knuckles or curses he threw at him. Castiel had to stay dead, the story was coming to an end nonetheless, after the birth of that Nephilim.
And he certainly could not have known that there is always an archangel on the shoulders of a prophet to ensure that history is written, goes on. It was not difficult to connect the dots and understand who had provided that information to Dean.
He looks like his mother, he's so worried it's funny.
“Do you have any idea how much is a commission for a sale like that? We had to go in Europe next summer” she pouts, her shoes resonate on the marble floor of the conference room.
He looks his keys again, as if he didn't already know his room number by heart, and the small blue plastic circle attached to them reminds him once again that his room is number 401.
Of course, he had to imagine it since we are talking about Dean, the same Dean who is unlucky since the day he was born.
People love Dean and he loves that they love him.
He tries to close his eyes but if before it was the heat that kept him awake, now it is the awareness of the body wrapped around him. He tries to free himself but becomes impossible when Cas relentlessly, annoyed by his constant movements, begins to move.
Obviously he will certainly not give it to him so easily.
"Good" Castiel clears his throat and looks at Dean again, "Shall we start?"
The truth is that Castiel "lends" too many shirts, if only he stopped letting his “conquests” out of his house with his clothes on, all this would not happen.
It's not really a nice pick-up line, especially if it's two o'clock in the morning in the middle of the ocean.
It doesn’t take long to figure out in which of the three buildings his room is, (it’s the second one) so Dean walks along the short tree-lined avenue and he goes through the small door.
His raison d’etre.
at him.
The journey has been longer and more tiring than he expected and only now Dean is beginning to realize how far he is from home.
Dean pretends to be busy with something else, maybe reading a book, maybe changing the layout of his room or reorganizing his library for the millionth time, but in reality he is just waiting for Cas to come back from work or from some evening class at the university.
Then there was Cas with is absurd pretense to being God and trying to do everything his alleged father never had the balls to do. Obviously all get screwed up, like always in their miserable lives. Cas opened the Purgatory, the Leviathans destroyed Cas and he disappeared under the water of a lake God knows where. That was probably the longest time Dean believed Cas was gone, death not exactly death after all.
Cas breathes on his neck, leaving there few chaste kisses, and then reaches for his shirt at the foot of the bed to quickly clean them both.
And yes, probably you’re thinking, how can Dean possibly find relaxing a place so full of people?
Charlie stares at Dean for a few seconds but then turns her attention to what it’s not apparently the new Starbucks delivery boy but their new manager.
In the end he doesn't have to choose anything, because Castiel, Cas, stops keeping his arms stretched out on the grass behind him and gathers the book.
There is a small table right on the left, a girl with a huge and kind smile welcomes him. Behind her there is a clearly hand-made banner that welcomes freshmen. She has red hair and a Star Trek t-shirt with the words "Live Long and Prosper" and Dean just knows that they need to be friends. Feeling safer not being the only nerd in this situation, he greets her with the Vulcan salute and her smile only gets bigger.
"May I come in?"
"Like this?"
Dean can't find him adorable because we're talking about Cas.
"Cas" repeats, but he doesn't answer, he just caresses Dean's earlobe with the tip of his nose but doesn't touch him otherwise, his hand continues to rest on his pelvis, it squeezes him lightly to tell Dean to stay still. His other hand is on top of his stomach but just for comfort, it's not really touching him. His fingers keep going in and out of the pajama pants, loosening the elastic only to make it return to the initial potion, literally driving Dean crazy.
obviously is Castiel.
Of course, looking at things in hindsight, giving a soul to Castiel wouldn't have really made a big difference considering the fact that at the beginning it wasn't exactly Castiel’s fault.
"Like this?"
"At least come here" Dean says with a small voice when he finally finds the courage to ask, the fear of a possible rejection in his heart.
There’s nothing interesting enough to sightseeing for the tourists, children don’t scream building their sandcastles, even the traffic decreases substantially.
But for months, months he has been forced to look at the other's smile from afar, to bear all his complaints about how little often he cleans their common areas and all his unsolicited advice on how to do laundry and how to cook. In reality, every time it happened, Cas dreamed of being able to silence him, making him kneel right on that floor that Dean accuses him of not cleaning often enough and getting his cock wrapped around those full lips, always too red and shiny in his opinion.
"I ... I want ..." he moans when he takes his lobe between his teeth and bites it slowly, passing his tongue over it several times.
And Dean could scream, cry and pray but where’s the sense of all this if the only person listening to his prayers now is gone?
Cas started to like Dean's company a little too much, not that he was ever sorry for it , and Dean didn't even complain when his socks were on the sofa the other day.
"I don't want to leave you alone" he whispers after a while, closes his eyes again and Dean swears, he's not sighing at all like a fifteen-year-old in front of his first crush. Luckily he has a fever so he has a valid excuse for being red in the face.
Dean is so close to tear the cigarette off from his mouth and throw it on the ground but the guy probably would pull another from his packet and at that point Dean will surely get an aneurysm.
Dean can’t even feel the pain on his knuckles when he first punch the wall, the blood is staining the paint. It’s a clear warning in his head but he can’t feel anything. He can’t feel his skin rips up against the wall of his room or the voice of his brother calling him behind the door. It’s a chant of
He often wonders what would have happened if he had sent a different angel to save Dean's soul from hell.
Not that his father is guilty of something, he just loved the wrong woman at the wrong time.
And really, the arrogance. Not only did Castiel completely turn his back on everything he had known practically since the beginning of time, what he had been created for but now he was at "his" home, Chuck home, ready to die in the name of the Righteous Man.
So Dean drinks, drinks and drinks, till the ice in his body leaves him alone and his mouth is full of bile. It’s useless and stupid like Dean in this moment and he just smile because at least now he’s feeling something. Is revulsion for himself a feeling, right?
"Let's go out to celebrate then"
"Look what we found"
Charlie take him to the elevator and when they finally arrive on the fourth floor she leaves the box near his door.
Dean is a set of disconnected moans and sighs, despite Cas’ iron hand on his pelvis he begun to make these small, needy, circular motions, with the ever-growing desire to see what it seems to be an impressive erection inside him.
If it was Dean who raised so many walls between them, it's up to him to remove them or at least ask Cas somehow to do it.
Cas smiles against his neck and starts moving his hands. They are soft touches, just fingers brushing that makes Dean shiver more and he knows, he just knows, how strong those hands can be, how big they look above his skin and he would like only to be touched a bit more rigorously with them until they leave signs that he can see in the mirror tomorrow.
The handprint,
When he realizes it his ears become red too.
It not much later that Dean gets tired of standing there helpless and begins, or at least tries in every way, to make his body closer to Cas', as if it were still humanly possible, not just to have a little relief but also because he wants to prove to him at all costs that he is certainly not the only one in a precarious situation, considering that the reason he woke up in the first place is an erection pressing against his ass.
Cas smiles one last time, more fond than amused. He lies down next to him even if after all these months spent being careful not to cross the line to Dean’s room without his expressed permission he’d rather make him wait a little more but he's tired and even if he doesn't show it, he's worried about Dean.
him. Many times this simple gesture was the only thing keeping Dean’s mind straight, because Cas was somewhere, Cas was alive.
"Cas..."
Since that evening on the bus he has been more careful not to get drunk so much. He still can't get over Dean's rebellious hair, his languid eyes for the too much alcohol and his relaxed, full smile. Cas hardly sees it on his face in their daily lives.
When he wake up things are not better. His headache is going stronger and Dean can’t understand if is the alcohol running in his veins that make all feels blurry, vague, inaccurate, or there are just too tears in his eyes to make he understands what’s happening in his head.
A few minutes without an umbrella and he is so wet that he has water even in his socks. He can't wait to get home and take a hot shower.
“So, new boss. I’m worried”
“Cas, it’s still me. It’s Dean. You have to come back, man. I don’t know if I can do it without you. I don’t know if this time I can make it through. I still need you Cas, please. Come back to me”.
He looks like a completely different person with his clothes in the right place and the blue tie of the same shade of his eyes.
"Come on Cas, hurry up"
“You are a stupid son of a bitch, you know that? You promised me… you promised you’d have stayed, no matter what. Everyone will leave me, everyone except you, but you left”.
Cas gives a slight grunt in response, right in the direction of Dean’s ear and he is only human, he is forced to get a little closer but Cas stops him, a hand on his pelvis blocks his movements.
The problem is that Cas has noticed him and cannot help but smile in front of his roommate's red cheeks and wide eyes.
"Cas…" he can't help but say when the fingers become three and they are suddenly so deep that they touch his prostate.
"More Cas, touch me more"
So Dean picks his little red lighter and passes it to the stranger, hoping at least to finish his cigarette in silence after the brilliant pick-up line of the guy next to him.
The reality is that he feels pretty useless and wants to be there for him in whatever way he can.
"I'm not open yet" and Cas immediately becomes serious, the blue of his eyes disappears almost completely, swallowed by the black of the pupil. If he could right now he would eat Dean.
Dean can’t help but notice it while shaking his head, pretending to be outraged by what the guy just said and slowly moving away towards his Impala.
And then, what sane person would lend their toothbrush to a stranger? Or his shirt? Dean still finds all that situation completely absurd.
Oh but Chuck can adapt. He was angry but there is nothing better than a little brotherly love, always leads viewers to remain glued to the pages and identify with the stories. So Dean ended up in hell for Sam and yes someone might think it was a cruel thing to do but who doesn't like a tormented hero?
Sam is staring him with a broken look, watery eyes that don’t spill even a single drop.
Dean Winchester always thought good things can’t happen, or at least they never last, but a certain angel nine years ago put this strange hope in his mind that maybe miracles can happen. Obviously he was wrong. Good things don’t happen. Al least not for Dean.
Dean told him about his family, Sam and how they watch Game of Thrones together. It turns out that although Cas is not a big fan of TV series, he actively follows this particular show.
"Touch me Cas, please touch me"
Cas' mouth drops slowly to his chest and then lower and lower, leaving a trail of wet kisses everywhere, as if he has all the time in the world and Dean isn't going to beg him to take him right now.
Thinking about it, Dean doesn’t stares at Cas so much by the way because every time he needs a great amount of strength not to blush or not to feel embarrassed.
Castiel looks down on him as if he is studying him, Dean clears his throat and keep staring at his new boss, looking for an alternative explanation for his presence in the room, in addition to the most
And maybe this is the problem. He does everything only if it’s necessary.
“Mh, bad day?”
It’s a bit stupid seeing him close a book casually just when Cas comes back home.
It fails miserably.
“Do you ever take that stick out of your ass?”
But the stranger of the bench, Castiel or whatever his name was, is in front of him with a spark of amusement in his eyes.
Audition by The Voice. (Yes, it's a bit obsessed with talent shows).
It often happened that Cas brought different girls to the apartment, a couple of times Dean also noticed some boys sneaking away early in the mornings.
The last one was Lucifer, even if maybe that death doesn’t count. Cas was not died, he was only possessed but Dean never wanted to punch him like in that moment.
Cas pretends not to notice it even if he secretly does the same thing.
Every time his shirts are on the floor, his socks mysteriously under Dean's bed and his underwear... Castiel has problems with his underwear, really.
where Cas grace was. He didn’t need of his immediate proximity to know that Cas was somewhere in the universe, safe and sound, doing whatever stupid angelic job in order to save the world. Dean only needed that, touching the light burn on his arm and feel Cas, just
He is too drunk to think about the scent of the salt that permeates his nose or the constant sound of the waves that touch the sand. There is only Cas and his eyes shining with alcohol, he stares at him amused.
They are in a post sex spoon and they haven't even had sex.
room, this is
After a few moans Cas opens his eyes, he doesn't know if it’s for his fever delusions or just his usual embarrassing-self but he swears he can see the blue of his eyes even in the dark.
Dean, frustrated, closes his legs around Cas' torso and pushes him closer with his feet.
It rains so much that Dean had to leave his bike at the university parking lot and walk to the dormitory convinced that he could cover the short distance on campus without getting completely soaked.
"But it's your bed, are you sure I can get that close to it?" despite the complete darkness in which the room is immersed, the dim light that penetrates from the glass of the window makes Cas’ smile more than visible. He has his eyes closed even though it is now more than clear to both of them that Cas is more than awake.
The first time Dean saw Cas die with his eyes was when Lucifer snapped his fingers. They know each other from what, one year? The situation was so complicated that Dean didn’t have even the time to realize what was just happened and Cas was already there, besides him, where Cas should be. Cas was there again new and improved, fixing the messes they created together, as usual.
Dean opens the door of his new home, expecting to find darkness in the small living room that welcomes him but obviously with all that has happened today his brain simply decided to erase a small but very important information.
It is Saturday when Cas's hair, stupidly shot in all directions, appears in his room. Dean immediately lowers his gaze to check if he crossed the border on the door that once a particularly angry Dean, indicated to him.
Now... now he's forced to watch Jack suffer Dean's words and feel guilty about something he hasn't really done and which luckily, even if he doesn't know yet, he can fix so to not see Dean watch him with all that much hatred in the eyes. Not that Dean looks Jack in the eye much anyway since they returned to the bunker and Castiel is not with him.
Because now is different, Cas is really dead. Dean knows this time. There were Cas’ wings on the ground and it never happened and Dean knows that Cas want to come back to his family, to him, but this time won’t happen. God doesn’t give a shit of them poor bastards on the earth, technically the world isn’t in any direction to a new Apocalypse. Lucifer is trapped who knows where and Jack doesn’t even know how to tie his shoes. Cas had faith in him but at the end of the day Cas had faith even in Dean and that didn’t work out good.
If Dean often accuses him of being a bastard, well that's what he will be for him right now.
Dean lost the track of time and when he opens his eyes he’s in the bunker, on his bed with his shoes and all his clothes, full of blood, soot and God knows what. It’s dark, too dark and Dean can’t even watch his own hands. The only patch of light comes from under the little door. There is a quite noise in the hallway and Dean knows that it comes from the library.
He was too busy following the Winchesters everywhere to realize what Lucifer was up to. Contrary to popular belief, Chuck is not exactly omniscient and the last time the Nephilims were in this universe he swept the Earth away with no remorse, this time it won't be better. They are too unpredictable, powerful and not as manageable as humans.
The stranger next to him is now holding a cigarette in his mouth. He plays with it with the tip of his tongue making the cigarette wobble for a moment while he is patting his trouser pockets looking, certainly, for a lighter.
It would be a great scene for a movie, but this is not a movie.
This is also Cas’ fault. Dean told him he didn’t deserve to be saved, he told it with the eyes and the angel understood. It was one of his mission here on the earth, make Dean feel the righteous man. Dean never understand what Cas saw in him, he said Dean had bright soul, the brightest he ever seen in millions of years. Dean never believed him but that didn’t matter. What mattered was that Cas believed it, everything seemed more real in this way.
"Who likes to have a stick in the ass”. He has again that slight smile painted on the lips,
It’s all people fault. People who have this strange claim of having to always seem happy that leads them to pretend so much that at some point in their lives they are addicted to their self-conviction and when something happens that destabilizes their precarious mental balance, they realize... They are not happy.
Dean realizes only now that he's still in the taxi, a grumpy man with a worn baseball hat is looking at him in a wrong way. He hadn't realized he had been staring at the building for so long and he certainly didn't want to stay there sighing like a little girl when she sees the boy she likes. He's just happy and wants to enjoy the moment, thank you so much taxi guy! You ruined the atmosphere.
Or at least they admire him.
He’s kind when it’s necessary, hell, he even help old ladies cross the street with their ridiculous shopping cart. He even smiles, when it’s necessary.
It doesn't bother him so much, it's not that he has some claim on him, it's just that Cas invited him and at least for tonight it shouldn't be a problem for him not to score.
Dean throws it on the ground beneath him and gets up from the bench, he crushes the cigarette with the tip of his expensive pair of shoes and he pat his trouser pockets in search of the car keys.
Everything started when he was little, normal family in a normal house in Dumbfuck, Nowhere. Even the maps don’t know where it is. A normal family of the twenty-one century where you’re mom never loves you enough and your father is so busy to figure out when is life went to hell to realize that it’s your life that he’s screwing.
He is not ashamed to say that he had a list of things to say to Castiel as soon as he would be brave enough to talk about them. And it was perfect, really, a detailed discussion on privacy and personal spaces with lots of super explanatory examples and simulations but it has been a while since Dean understood that every time they are both sitting so close, his brain does not respond well at his brain controls, his mouth begins to speak without a filter or knowledge.
"Nope…"
But obviously Cas does not miss the opportunity, it would not be him otherwise, and looks at him in a way that really, what could Dean do if not blush terribly?
“I promise Cas… I’ll never forget you”
He suspects that if Cas continues to be this close to him, his temperature will never drop.
"Castiel, we have to talk" Dean shouldn't scream but he's so tired! It’s not the first time he found Cas's things scattered on his side of the house despite the fact that Dean has told him so many times, personal spaces, but nothing.
Dean looks in Castiel’s eyes for the last time and then stares the ocean; he's already too far from the bench when Castiel speaks again
He doesn’t want to get out, is not like he has a porpoise but Dean can’t keep staying in the dark, alone, when the only thing with him is his broken head. Dean turns on the little lamp on the nightstand and his eyes put more that they should to get use to the yellow light that begins to spread in the room. When Dean meets his eyes in the mirror he cant even recognize himself. His face is swollen and there are many cuts on the skin. He should feel pain but his broken heart covers everything. Dean splashes some waters on his skin and changes his clothes. The pain he feels when he looks at his reflection has nothing to do with what he has felt so far.
Despite all this, the strange thing is that people love Dean.
He has the most innocent look in the world on his face, like that of a dog before his master scolds him because he already knows he has done something wrong.  He is adorable and Dean would love to touch his hair right now, they always seem so soft but for obvious reasons he has not yet confirmed his theory.
Probably he just realized, at some point of his life, that people get you nowhere. He’s never been a cynic person, even if this claptrap could make you think quite the opposite. But it’s not like he goes everywhere with a gray cloud upon his head and no children cry when they meet his eyes.
He’ll deal with it, like always, nothing is better than alcohol to break the ice.
At one point it became a bit of a challenge to inflict so much pain to see how far Dean could go, if he would break. But no matter how hard Dean bends, he never got to that point, especially because he continues to lean on Cas every time and always come back a little straighter.
Charlie makes such a funny expression that Dean would laugh if only his heart had not just stopped in his throat.
He wasn't angry that time, even though he should have. Again his characters wrote themselves, took the roads, made choices that he had not even thought of writing in a draft.
It’s not his fault if you had to sit in your room when the dishes flew in the kitchen, it’s not his fault if you had to plug Sammy’s hears when the screams get too loud. And Hell, it’s not even his fault if your mom doesn’t feel like to be your mom.
Probably if he put them against each other causing irreversible and irreparable things between them, there would not have been so much desire to fight, hope in them that they could forget the wrongs that they did to each other.
It rains, it rains a lot.
He was wrong.
He doesn't have time to get used to the sudden change of position because Cas is back inside him, with a single push that makes him arch his back. He raises his pelvis slightly to take him all, all the way down, and Cas holds his hands tightly on his hips to indulge his movements, he’s aware of the marks of his fingers he’s leaving on the pale skin that moves languidly under him and he can’t’ wait to see them tomorrow, every time Dean walks in their apartment.
He wears dark thigh-fitting jeans that hug his legs in the right places and a black short-sleeved shirt.
For a very long time Dean believed that was his fault. Now maybe he stopped believing it, even if there are moments where he wonders,
“It really seems you had a bad day”
Would the same thing happen?
“Charming like always, ms. Bradbury” Bela smiles at Charlie, it’s one of her fake smiles that creeps everyone out. She straighten up on her chair as soon as she hears the door of the room open.
Did he already say that he hates him?
Sam nods, he does a small gesture toward Jack and Jack frowns and tilts his head. He doesn’t understand the gesture of the little Winchester. Dean wants to puck. Is he gonna spend the rest of his life finding Cas in every little day-to-day action? Dean turns his head, watching again the bonfire. Sam is dragging Jack in the Impala.
Well nothing. Nothing when the sun shines.
“Just a moment Sammy, please”
Nothing except Alki Beach.
"Cas, please"
And he tried to get him out of the scene more than once. One of the reasons he brought Alastair out of hell (if not to force Dean to confess to Sam what had happened - all that repression was getting boring -) was just to kill Castiel.
Dean is impatient and puts his hands everywhere on Cas, it seems that he does not know where to start touching that solid body that moves like a cat on top of him.
But he could only be fascinated by the way in which Dean's soul called Castiel in the darkest depths of hell, as he tried to cling desperately to his grace to be brought to safety even though aware within himself that this was his place, next to the wheel on which the soul he was torturing was tied, aware that he did not deserve to be saved.
Dean grabs all his belongings and gets out of the car, he has a heavy leather shoulder bag and a backpack full of clothes, not to mention the box full of books he has in his arms. Like hell he’s spending a day without them, he would never leave them home alone unattended. God only knows what could happen.
"What Dean?" he put his face in the hollow of Dean’s neck, leaving wet kisses and making the skin red with his teeth.
“What?”
People love him because he makes them laugh, Dean loves to make them laugh. See how their eyes engage the mouth when he says something stupid, their kind expression when he decides to do someone a favor without expecting anything in return.
His mother often warned him about college during the long months before he left. According to her, university looks more like a den of addicted hippies with ambiguous sexual orientation rather than an educational institution and looking at Castiel in front of him, Dean can't help thinking that maybe she wasn't so wrong after all.
Even before he can ask the bartender for something, Cas's stupid face pops up again and trust him, Dean would like to be able to repress the smile that inevitably draws on his lips when he sees him, elbowing among the people with some shots in his hands, but he can't.
He looks so small under the covers, with his red cheeks and feverish eyes.
how could be possible guilty for something?
Charlie is the Director of Research, Development and Innovation, which for Dean makes absolutely no sense but she seems to be good at whatever she does in her field. She’s probably one of the very few people with who Dean likes talking at work. There are so many people in the building.
Why does Dean's life have to be like this?
"... More" he whispers because despite how obvious his desire is, he feels tremendously embarrassed about how he's behaving but it's certainly not his fault that Cas drives him completely insane.
Bela clears his throat, bringing him back to the planet earth and Dean can’t help but blush as everyone keeps staring at him insistently.
“Well, that´s good, right?”, the hunter said turning back to him, his eyes just slightly bright, “What happened?”, he asked alarmed upon seeing the cauldron unlit.
When they got to the kitchen, Kevin was already there, munching on a bacon strip. Dean smiled at him with both cheeks full.
“Of course”, Cas answered with a slight, worried frown, “There are some kids playing two houses over. Do you want me to fly over there and tell them to stop?”
“I don’t know man, it wouldn’t surprise me if your castles kept them at bay”, the hunter snorted as he drank some more.
“Oh, God”, he moaned in a squeaky voice, “He´s kicking. Little Dean is kicking!”
Cas closed his eyes and just let his head rest on Dean´s shoulder, his body slumping.
“Oh. Where the plant thing was”
The hunter glared at him.
Why there was more magic in the Doomed Forests, that was a matter that had not been settled yet. Some theorists argued that mages might have depleted the populated areas of magic due to its intensive use during Heaven´s War. Others argued that it was the unique environment of the Doomed Forests that originated the rise in the levels, that monsters and magical creatures exuded magic to their surroundings. Since most of the records from before Heaven´s War had been lost, there was no way to really know.
“I mean, we got rooms to spare. And you don´t have to hurry back, right? Stay for dinner. It´ll be nice, smaller. Just us and my folks and Sam and Jess. Mum will love it”
Okay, he realized, maybe he shouldn´t have left him alone like that. Castiel already knew everyone there from separate events, but this was the first Winchester party he ever attended. Yes, he had once said hi to his mum from the Impala as they left, and he got along with Charlie marvelously; but he was not the most social being, and navigating a human gathering could not be easy for the angel.
“You are the youngest mage to ever acquire full access to the Great Library of the High Academy of Magic, and that’s just a testament of the paramount importance of your work", stated his mother in a proud, pleased tone, "Finding a cure for the Corruption would change everything, and provide the utmost honor and distinguishment to our House. Do not despair, and persevere in your efforts”
“No, no. Sam and Cas are fine. Kevin too”
Well, he
to fight them. He could see them with the glasses, but the damned things moved when he charged, when he spun, when someone pushed him.
“T´s okay, Cas. Get some rest”
“How did you do this?”, Mary whispered between joy and astonishment.
Dean looked at the screen. Charlie was trying to start a video call.
“Welcome… back”, Alastair repeated.
He roared and punched; the guy ducked and retreated a step.
He panicked, screamed Dean´s name, grappled with the guy and tried to get away. He saw that same guy he though was just a normal, offended person; kinda smiling at him. Everything got dark so soon. He got a glimpse of Cas, looking wide-eyed on his direction, Dean throwing whatever he had on his hands to run toward him, Sam being held by the neck by the chick with the dog.
“I do like pie”, he admitted with a shy smile.
Cas knew full well that he did not want to do
Dean snorted and laughed slightly.
Dean looked at those blue eyes for a second, then turned to where his brother was breaking the news… to his mum and dad. They looked so happy…
And he had jumped from the bed and gotten two steps away, almost tripping in his trepidation, while color rose to heat his cheeks.
He felt self-conscious enough just walking past to think about sitting beside him to examine him, so Cas took the clothes he´d left prepared the previous day on the chair to get changed in the bathroom. The healing would come next.
after me!”
“It´s… not important, Dean”, the angel said in a sad, low voice, “Just leave it alone”
Uriel nodded slowly towards him before turning to the servants on the communication barracks, probably to supervise the costs of correspondence of that month. Damn, was Castiel happy that he hadn´t marked the rangers´ message as urgent. Uriel could have read it and learned what it was about.
Dean frowned a bit at that.
Cas closed his eyes to let out a tiny sigh. Of course. It just made sense he was the host of that meeting. The healer nodded his thanks to his brother as a knot of mixed feelings cozied itself on the bottom of his stomach. It… had been months since he´d last seen his fiancée.
“Huh?”, he was able to let out.
Castiel walked backwards, his eyes tracking all of the giant wolves in front of him. His right hand was raised up, the light spell dazzling in sparkling radiance; his left extended in front of him, ready for defense. His heart was beating fast, his breathing was panted.
“Then I promise, yeah”, Castiel said.
“You had a baby??”, asked Castiel in pure horror.
“The last thing I want to do is to hurt you. Any of you”, he said in a firm, calmed voice, “But you know how things work for us normally. You know we will face these kinds of choices again. It´s always one of us that has to sacrifice for the others”
Feeling a weight lifted off his shoulders, Cas put his hands on his knees to stand up.
Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise.
“Come here, you big asshat”
“I´m not sure, Castiel...”, he said, looking uncomfortable.
Two gunshots resonated in the room, lighting it up in two little bursts of light. In those, Dean saw… that presence; that beautiful, warm and caring presence… getting hit. Heard it hiss lightly, more annoyed than pained, but his rage multiplied.
Cas opened his mouth a bit and looked at his feet. Holy God, he was right. There was a big plethora of ground-digging creatures…
Dean´s eyes widened as his heart galloped. Castiel frowned at the question, as if he didn´t know what to answer. Panic surged in Dean at the possibility of the angel declining, and he practically screamed:
“I don’t know!”, he answered, his last syllable transforming into a nervous laugh.
Sam smiled to himself, apparently proud.
“Cas, Castiel, the angel?”, asked Jess to Sam.
As soon as the metal spike stopped moving, the pain got to a bearable level and after a few seconds of panting, he opened his eyes again. He looked towards the bag in disbelief.
“The usual. I studied, researched… I went to the Academy yesterday. Did some combat training, and they gave me some ingredients I needed”
Uriel was an arcanist, a mage that performed magic by drawing sigils and infusing them with energy so that they performed complex magic results. Any mage could draw and infuse a sigil they knew before, but only arcanists had enough understanding and connection with the magic symbology to examine a sigil and understand every thread of the matrix that led to what it would do, to enhance it, to modify it… and even create new ones from scratch. Cas would never understand arcane magic. It required a strange mix of math, physics and magical instinct that was unfathomed to him.
“Come on, c´ mere”
“Okay, don´t sweat it. Just you know, don´t breath too deeply”
“I thought you were in a hurry of sorts”, he answered in a sassy tone.
“I… am…”, Castiel babbled, trying to get his mind away from that pathway, “
“Okay, Imma go see which way to go- we got no time to lose. We gotta find Sammy”
“Tsk. Sorry, man. Maybe I was being a bit of a dick there”, he grunted.
“Dean…!”, he emitted in a tone of protest.
“Do you mean in a… medical sense?”
Yeah, it was definitely being a very good day.
. Tell them I don´t care how much I need to pay, but I need to know
“My family can´t see me hurt, Dean; or the scars non-magical healing would leave”, Cas said firmly looking up at him, “They would ask questions I have no way to answer”
worse. He guessed John had done his damned best.
THIS ENDING. This is the ending of a chapter that I like the MOST out of all that I have written for this fanfic yet xDDDD The second best is when a wolf bit Cas, he screams, and several guttural growls roar in answer. Poor guy xD
The hunter grunted in pain, eyes fiercely shut as he scowled and covered his waist with one arm. He started thrashing, tried to sit up but let out a choked grunt of pain and laid back down, panting.
At that, the mage frowned a bit in confusion and looked up at him. He widened then his eyes a bit in understanding.
“You take that side, I’m on this one”, he pointed at the other end of the clearing as his eyes traveled through the ground.
“I´m sure he´ll be back in a sec”, he turned to her, “So, I know that the official celebration is not today…”
PLEASE gimme some comments, I really want to know what you guys think xD
“I´m… I´m fine!”, he said loudly, “Something… splashed on me. I… I healed it already”
, Dean thought,
At that, the hunter turned to him chuckling a little, obviously having liked that.
He felt his face burning red, with embarrassment, with shame, regret, with all the pain this issue had always brought him; sensed the rush of hormones sent into his bloodstream, the quickening of his heart, the tension of the muscles in his stomach, the raise of his body temperature. He felt so humiliated. There was no way he could answer that question.
Dean frowned, but stayed silent.
“Now, now”, Crowley continued talking, now from his back, setting his nerves on edge, “I totally understand how you would feel safer with both Tablets gone, huh? No need for a pesky little prophet if there ain´t no prophecies to decipher, right? I bet… you just wanted to go on with your life”
“Happy?”, he sighed.
“I don’t know what the fuck is this
After all, Castiel is not that attractive...
“Castiel”
"You are wet"
Cas grabs him by his pelvis and turns him on the bed with a sharp movement, Dean suddenly finds himself with his stomach on the bed, his erection rubbing on the damp sheets.
It is only natural for him to open his legs and welcome him between them, Cas immediately bends over to kiss him, his mouth open and his tongue caressing his palate. Dean is hot, he still a little feverish, Cas doesn't even dare imagine how hot it must be inside. It might come in his pants at the very thought of sinking completely in him.
making a single mistake.
Now the only thing Dean feels when his trembling fingers touch Cas’ handprint is
"Do you have any plans for tonight?"
When he comes back with a bottle of lube, Dean sighs in relief and Cas starts laughing.
"If you really insist" Cas laugh and aligns himself with his opening and enters him slowly, enjoying all the various shades of expression that pass on Dean's face, watching his mouth open with pleasure and moaning for every extra inch he takes .
"You know I write the salary checks at the end of the month, right?" He winks at her, before sitting down on the other side of the oval table, to his right Bela, their lawyer, Dean hates her with the intensity of a thousand burning suns but at least with her they never lost a case in Court.
Not only were his characters doing everything they could to go against what he had always predicted for them but they were doing it consciously, aware that they were wrecking the story written for them even if they never really knew by whom, not until today.
Castiel (although Dean has to be honest with himself, he has started calling him Mr. Darcy for quite some time in his head), sits on the sofa with him.
And if on the one hand Cas does everything to repress himself from touching him, at the same time Dean has started to do it and a lot. They are not prolonged touches, they are mostly light hands that touch him almost everywhere: his back, his hair and the neck, especially the neck.
The first time Dean Winchester tore the script and completely did things of his own way, Chuck was angry. Furious.
“I don’t know… I like the feeling”.
