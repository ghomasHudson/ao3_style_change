"Excuse me that I didn't want to flip the tube accidentally with you in it!" Peter says. He turns to Steve and points at the lake. "Flat surface, therefore less dangerous. First team to the other side?"
In the ensuite, Tony finds light linen-like pants with drawstrings that will do well as pajamas. There’s a sonic shower like the one in the ship—too bad, actual water would have been great—and in ten minutes he's cleaned up and ready for bed. After another glass of water, Tony reenters the bedroom to find Steve closing the room's curtains.
"Oh no, I don't think so."
Unable to talk because of the cock in his mouth, Steve hums in agreement. Tony always knows how to make him feel wonderful. He's so lucky.
"Yes, Tony."
"What?" Cora looks unapologetic, and Tony chuckles.
Tony reels back in surprise, frowning. "What?"
The exterior resembles a rundown hangar, fitting the rough industrial neighborhood. The interior isn't magically more classy, which was to be expected. There's a counter to the right that at first glance looks like every coat check in a club ever, save for a wall covered with a series of lock boxes. Tony supposes it’s for weapons. Big Purple gestures to the man and woman working the desk who nod and then go back to their conversation, barely sparing them a look. Deemed unarmed and vetted, they then proceed to the main part of the establishment. It's a mix between a casino and a stripper joint, where small, dimly lit alcoves curling around mini-stages alternate with tables with croupiers and their players. Since the mostly naked performers in the booths use their preferred music at the same time, it causes a chaotic wall of noise that’s hard to describe. It isn't helped by the loud conversations and occasional cheering from the gambling spots. Tony catches Steve wincing at the cacophony of it all and commiserates.
"Well, that depends on the guy," Tony says, tapping a finger on his lower lip. "I'd need more details on what he likes."
Steve doesn't know if he'd like that. It unsettles him a bit. Surely it's not normal to want someone you love to hurt you?
Steve raises his chin defiantly. "They don't scare me."
Obviously the high priestess wouldn't have bet on that outcome (which, to be fair, never happened). She glances at Tony's hand.
The numbers change, this time saying '3490', and the alternate reality in view is at least not in the middle of a battle. In fact, it looks like a lawn party with a mix of people either well dressed or in superhero costumes, mingling in little groups. Tony is searching for himself—he's been the only constant from the start, maybe because he's the one opening each reality—but can't see his counterpart. Since there are many heroes he doesn't know at all on the portal window, this is definitely not their universe.
"We're not here to have fun, we're here to make you the best fighter you can become."
"Anyway," Tony says, gesturing as if saving the universe was just a fluke, "we're sure glad it worked out. And thank you so much for your invitation; it's been an honor to meet the great Sovereign people. Everything I've seen has been more impressive than we'd even heard about."
"We almost died together the first time we met," Nebula tells Tony, her tone a little clipped. She's tilting her head to the side as she observes him, and she reminds Tony of a bird.
Very few details of the two fights against Thanos, the one pre-Decimation and the one they won, have surfaced. The purpose of their current victory tour is to spin the final battle to their advantage, and they keep pretty mum on the defeat that came first. Tony read a compilation of the most far-fetched theories Carol has heard and it was damn entertaining. His favorite was how it wasn't the humans who defeated Thanos but Earth's terrifying fauna; stories about Australia must have circulated far and wide. Once Thanos was dead, the Avengers just had to grab the gauntlet and snap people back.
Tony's heart lurches and then starts rabbiting at that. It seems pretty straightforward as far as declarations go, but Tony is afraid to hope just yet.
"I could kiss you all day. Turn around again, look at yourself Tony."
"I've got this," Tony tells Tal, nudging him out the way so he isn't hit by a right hook. The punch lands on Tony's shoulder, but the armor absorbs the shock of course, and he barely even budges. Kol, on the other hand, shouts in pain as he probably broke several fingers.
"The Summer Pavilion should have everything you need," she says, unlocking the door and giving Tony the keycard. "You are welcome to join us for breakfast tomorrow, in the room we just left."
"We wouldn't!" Morgan says, but her smile is huge as she looks up at Peter and giggles. The teenager winks down at her, unrepentant.
"Hey, Cap," he says.
A message, which clarifies why they are in full uniform. But it's obviously not just that. This reality's Steve is looking at his future wife with so much love that it makes Tony's heart squeeze again. Steve could be interested if Tony was a woman, which is even more heartbreaking than thinking he's never had a chance at all.
It makes Tony roll his eyes and retract the helmet. "No. It's me, asshole. And I don't have time for this shit."
"I see how it is," a new voice pipes up from the Compound's sliding door that opens onto the terrace.
"Good. I want you so much," Steve says. "I want to do everything with you."
"You heard the ladies," Tony says, shuffling into the room. The bed is huge. There shouldn't be a problem if they want to respect boundaries.
"They keep him busy," Jim says. "Seems good for him."
"What?" Tony asks, stunned. He scoots to the side of the mattress to see Steve lying on the floor, stiff as a board and panic written all over his face.
"I agree with you there," Tony says, checking the remote in his hand. He doesn't know what happened in this world, and why this Cap is here. This WIM-Tony clearly presumed him dead. But he's pretty sure that they won't find a way home from here. The scene continues to unfurl before them nonetheless.
"I ain't doing nothing," Carol drawls. "Just sitting pretty."
There are sounds behind him now; the beast is running too. It makes Tony speed up, and finally at last he emerges in the clearing, hands in the air, his right still clutching his pistol. The soldiers are training their rifles on him, but Tony expected it, barging in like this.
"Is this real?"
Tony nods, "Correct. But it was her 'let me see!' meow, not a panicky one."
"Are you going to shoot or not?" he goads instead.
"Hey guys," Steve says as he walks towards Jim and Tony.
“It’s been surprise after surprise,” Tony says, raising an eyebrow at Thor. On his shoulder, Cora shifts from one foot to the other before settling again.
"Let me add my congratulations, but I also need to be that person and break up the party," Everett Ross says. The guy might be CIA, but he has an earnest and no-nonsense veneer that Tony likes. "I've—"
Tony smiles. "You're welcome. Now, are you going to kiss me or what?"
Tony had thought so too; in fact, it's the only reason he touched the portal. He's about to joke that he hopes he sings better than the other man when Steve turns his head towards Tony and his eyes widen comically.
It's hard not to focus on Tony's smile and grin like an idiot in return, but Steve thinks he manages. Peter once again easily climbs up the hill with Morgan and their tube. As they approach, it's crazy to see how much Tony's girl has grown in the seven months since they left the hospital for the cabin. She's as cute as ever though; the spitting image of her father, with huge liquid brown eyes (which Steve is unsurprisingly partial to).
"As you wish, my little speed demon!"
The quip makes the stoat chirp. "Silly. Come on, let's go explore!"
Tony hums. "I think that it's something you'd like, if you ever want to try it."
"Yes, eidetic. I'll draw you and Lilly, for sure."
Tony grimaces. He knows himself enough to know he'd hold a grudge for something like that.
"Exactly! It would give you a good lead!"
Speaking of love, Steve is standing tall on the battlefield, shield on his arm. Tony knew they could pull this off, but it's a relief to see that he doesn't appear hurt.
"By herself, I swear!" Sam adds.
He turns his attention to the table again, where the game just finished. The croupier takes back all visible tiles, then everyone turns the hidden ones, including the house tiles. A woman to Tony's right cries out in delight, clapping. Her girlfriend, whom she'd been hanging onto all game —a lady with blond hair and shrewd eyes—has a lot of tiles with the same number. Nebula and Tal quickly explain to Tony what combinations are best while the tiles are still on the table. Again, there are similarities with poker, though having six different suits make the game more complex. It's soon confirmed that the blond lady won the round, and she passes a card to the croupier. When he taps it on a machine to his right, it projects a series of numbers in the air. The amount won, which earns her cheering and congratulations. And grumbling too, especially from the man with Tal.
"I went to medical, Steve. I'm fine."
When put together like that, it makes a compelling argument.
Tony nods. "Yeah, for Rhodey." He must see the disappointment on Steve's face because he chides. "I told you, I'm done."
But he has so much to learn. Tony forms two small balls of energy, one in each hand. He throws one to the side, where it hits the cupboards and ricochets straight back towards Steve. He raises the shield instinctively to protect himself, but Tony has already thrown the second one, this one on the floor, and Steve can't deviate both. The small blue ball that bounces on the tiles hits his thigh; even though Tony hasn't made it too strong, it delivers a sharp electric shock that makes Steve yelp in surprise.
He tries to be gentle, but Steve rears back as he wakes up, immediately alert. He almost falls out of the chair, but the moment he locks eyes with Tony, he relaxes his shoulders and smiles.
Rhodes throws his arms in the air. "Fantastic."
Rhodey nods. "Yeah, of course. Thanks, man. But before you agree, read the damn Accords. It's not that I don't understand why it's not ideal—"
Instead of being sad about it—it's not been easy; he had truly hoped they would work—Tony feels a bone-deep relief. This fresh development deserves a pause: he's actually getting over his heartbreak, then. This is good, very good.
It's great to see them getting along so well; Tony must be delighted about it too. Steve knows that Tony thinks of Peter as nearly a son, and right now they absolutely could pass as siblings or cousins.
"Okay, cool," Tony says with a wide smile. "They are awfully cute."
"Are you done freaking out now?"
Steve and Tony look at each other, equally confused.
Tony flings himself into Steve's arms, legs winding around his waist. Steve laughs, catching him while dropping the flowers.
"Distract you from your work?" Steve repeats. "At four?"
"I can see that," Tal says, flushed. He's visibly very impressed and turned on at the development. "So, so cool!"
As Tony speaks, he follows Carol in the sky. She’s flying around the Kree fighter plane, not concerned at all that she’s being shot at as she weaves in between the blasts. She's slowly luring them away from the casino, probably to a place with fewer civilians.
"Goddammit. Fucking ow!"
," Wanda says, sitting on the ground and offering her hand in the hope they come closer.
Jim interrupts and points at the house. "It's fine, I need a pee break, anyway."
He approaches and sits on the edge, feet and calves in the water. Callie, now on his lap, is side-eyeing the pool, and doesn't look like she wants to jump in at all.
"They were here for you, ready with those darts." Tony doesn't even voice it as a question; it's fact.
"That is so disturbing." Steve grimaces. "Just my luck that Loki is the one with a crush, and not—" He shuts his mouth closed when he realizes he's about to say 'you', and can feel that his face is definitely tomato red now. Oh jeez.
Tony got over this anger and feeling of betrayal once; he can do it again. The circumstances are different too, as Steve was honest when Tony asked instead of hiding a devastating secret for years. But honestly? Tony would love for his damn memories to return and not have to start anew. The lack of progress on his amnesia worries him too. He hasn’t gotten a single memory back since he woke up in that hospital on Banturia, not even a flash of one.
"That never gets old," Steve says, looking suitably reverent. He looks awed by the armor, which is enough to make a man gloat (even if Tony doesn't remember how he managed this miracle).
"You don't want to see this?" Johnny asks, gesturing at the ceremony.
"I love you too."
"It's okay, it's okay! Why are you here, kid?" he asks the guy.
"Did they ever," Bucky grumbles. Tony suspects Barnes had an involuntary earful in the Quinjet, but can't muster any shame about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, I've got this."
And as long as Tony is working—and he's doing it as much as he possibly can—Steve's absence is not so bad.
She nods and gestures, shutting the vault's door without touching it. Next, she makes a red mist morph into a surface that perfectly mimics the back wall, and the door to the vault disappears. He tested the barrier in the last few days, and it's astounding how real it appears. It also hides the core's energy signature thoroughly. If the Krees ever make their way back here, it should fool them into thinking they have the wrong room.
"Get out!" he'd yelled.
"Cool. How powerful are we talking about here?"
Steve laughs. "You make it sound like we're separated parents."
"Yep," Carol says. "And there's weirder, believe me."
"Of course," Steve says. "Take all the time you need. I understand."
"Where to?" Tony asks, focusing on the controls because he's currently being a coward.
"If we turn it solid instead of energy-based, yes. But you'll have less nanites for the armor, so less protection.”
"I know." Steve raises a hand to cover Tony's. He keeps watching the display though.
"So good for me."
Tony scoffs. He doesn't believe the act for one second.
"It can wait," he protests. Five minutes and he'll be done.
To his surprise, Steve turns his hand up so their fingers intertwine, squeezing back. It does all sorts of things to Tony's insides to be holding hands with Captain America, especially when he's being looked at with so much affection.
"Why did you try to run away, then?"
"Welcome to Asgard, my dear brothers-in-arms. I hope you feel as esteemed here as I do when I am in your company on Midgard. Skol!"
"That they are," Nat says as she joins the others. She's staying further away, and Steve wonders if she doesn't like cats. Maybe she's allergic.
"Nice!" Rhodey says, smile slowly stretching his lips again. "Though I've had a couple of dozens of those over the years. Where's the rest of the party?"
Tony gestures at Steve, a clear
"I am!" Peter insists.
"I could never hate you. Never."
"No worries. He has strict instructions never to move if either of the girls is less than a foot from him. I made it hard coding, and FRIDAY has overrides to stop him too. Same for U."
Tony had the advantage at the moment, even as he protected his head from being slapped by feathers. Cora did not try to peck at him or scratch him with her talons, which they both knew would hurt. Lilly, now fully awake, was trying to intervene.
Steve, who had already looked like a wreck, seemed to deflate. "Okay."
Steve appears in his field of vision, dropping to his knees by his side. He’s looming over him and Tony raises his hand up in an instinctive move to protect himself as his stomach lurches. Fuck, that's too similar to the end of the fight in Siberia, and Tony's heart is racing.
“Yes.” Thor points at an ornate grandfather clock that currently shows five o’clock. “I will be here at eight. Be dressed and ready.”
Steve laughs. "Is that so?"
"I said I won't let go," Steve says, stubborn as a mule.
"I don't want to hide it! Secrets got us in this mess in the first place. I swore I'd tell you. I wanted to yesterday morning, after we talked about hiding that you had Morgan—"
"You're a brat."
Tony is also immediately endeared by the boy.
"You won't just leave." Tony taps on his temple. "Not knowing it's all in there."
"Are you sure?"
There’s enough morning light for Steve's eyelashes to cast shadows that Tony longs to reach out and gently swipe at with his thumb. His breath catches when Steve's eyelids part to reveal a soft blue gaze that immediately focuses on him. Tony's been caught staring, but he keeps his gaze steady, not trying to hide or pretend otherwise. It's a good thing too because the smile that blooms on Steve's face is beautiful.
"Who the hell would—" Tony pauses when he pushes a newspaper aside and finds two minuscule kittens, the black one wriggling and screaming, "Oh my God."
There's a nice little coffee shop, three blocks away, that they found a few years back and prefer over the big chains. They don't even need to talk about it, falling in step in the direction of the shop. Halfway there, they stop to let a young man push a full trash bin on wheels closer to the end of an alley for pick-up. Tony has his phone out, distracted by emails, and it's probably because they're not talking that Steve hears a faint sound that catches his attention. Was that a mewl? He normally wouldn't bother, thinking it's a stray cat, but it seems to come from
It's tempting. He could be
"Just act normal," Steve says to his reflection in the rearview mirror.
"Sam!" Tony cries out. "Tell Steve to let go of me, or he'll get pulled in too!"
did. It was on me. Well, both of us."
As soon as they've entered their ship to finally escape those tedious people, Carol digs at him goodnaturedly.
"Shit." Tony's lightheaded with revulsion. How disgusting do you have to be to sacrifice your own child for power? Just thinking about it makes him feel sick, and Tony doesn't even have a kid. But then he feels uneasy for a completely different reason. He turns to Steve. "But… if someone needs to be sacrificed to get that stone..."
"Ugh," Tony protests.
"I'm sorry."
"What do you think you're doing?" the young man who placed the container asks him.
He squeezes her hand and brings it up to his lips to kiss. She shakes her head, charmed, and then leaves towards the party. Maybe it was rude not to say goodbye to more people over there, but Tony's got the feeling that if their chancellor is on their side, they’re alright.
Tony blinks. "Really?" As if the suggestion alone is preposterous.
Steve checks the counter in puzzlement. "It has to do with sex?"
"I do, Boss. What can I do for you?" FRIDAY answers from his pocket.
Cora draws a lot of attention as they follow Thor through the large dining room on their way to the head table. Tony notices hushed conversation, and there are several people staring. It could be the Iron Man armor—it stands out—but he's certain it's only part of it. Being observed isn't new for him, but Tony is hyper aware of it now. Every Asgardian daemon they've seen until now, may it be from the ruling class or the common folks, are mythical or fantastical creatures. Hell, there's an unicorn and what looks like a small dragon just ahead of them right this moment. But the dinner guests look blasé about it and are fixating on Tony's crow instead. It's positive attention, though, mostly curiosity and respect. It makes Tony keep his head high, and Cora does the same. She's pretty badass-looking, her feathers gleaming with an indigo sheen under the dining room's lighting. Frigga has risen from her seat and is waiting for them with a welcoming smile.
"Agreed." Tony groans beautifully when Steve bites the top of his shoulder. "Fuck, Steve, please."
Things are starting to come back independently from the visions in the machine, as if summoned by what has been unlocked. The bald man was Obie, which comes with the duality of remembering him both as an almost-uncle, a rock he depended on, but also as the guy who tried to have him killed. It leads to a very strong series of flashbacks that Tony knows aren't in the correct order. Being thrust head down in a bucket of water, sitting in a military vehicle when all hell breaks loose, being operated on without anesthetic, fighting an Obie clad in a bastardized Mark-I suit, Yinsen dying—
"Yeah." Steve hits redial and puts the phone to his ear.
The examination room in question is small and smells quite a lot like disinfectant, but that might only be to Steve, who's very sensitive to those chemicals. There's a stainless steel table to deposit the animals, but Tony doesn't relinquish the kittens. He’s opened the bundle and is whispering to the cats about how they are wonderful babies and how the doctor will be here soon. Frankly, Steve couldn't be more smitten if he tried. He knew he had a crush on the guy the size of the moon, but this is just too much. Steve takes the liberty of going to the sink, where he wets several paper towels and tries to clean his shoes and pants.
Tony tilts his daughter's face up and kisses her forehead. He's such a loving father, it makes Steve melt every time he witnesses it.
"Oh, yes, please," Tony says, burrowing his fingers in Steve's hair. It makes him slow down a tad. They just exchanged almost promises of seeing this through, of exploring where they could go together, but he still wants to savor the instant.
"Thanks."
The babies in question are fast asleep, though, so Steve leans in the box to kiss their little heads. So that is that. It was fun while it lasted.
"Yeah, yeah, funny guy. You're the one who said you don't get why I'm doing this," Bucky adds.
Steve notices that there's another box on Tony's workspace, with plexiglass walls and what he supposes are sensors.
"Oh my God!" Wanda exclaims.
"Great." Tony straddles Steve's thighs, who is enticingly hard in his pajama pants. He kisses him again with all the passion he feels too. "It's a shame I don't have the time to make love to you like you deserve, gorgeous," he says when he breaks the kiss, caressing the side of Steve's face.
"I don't know how you can leave her behind."
Rhodes smiles. "See, I knew you'd be for it too. But yeah. Thaddeus Ross, who is Secretary of State now—" Tony scrunches his nose. Ugh, he hates that guy, "—led a group that drafted what they call the Sokovia Accords. 117 nations are asking for ground rules. Not everyone agrees with the sentiment though."
Thankfully Steve knows how to slow down a descent from his multiple dives without a parachute, and Tony's tech is awesome. Once he reaches him, Tony matches their speed to minimize the impact, then smoothly rolls to slide under Steve's falling form. They're thirty-seven feet from the ground when he locks Iron Man's arms around Steve's torso and then shoots back up.
"Shut up. Pure luck," Kol insists.
Rhodey smiles back and Steve has to admit that he might miss Tony a lot, but he's definitely not the only one.
Carol starts, which makes sense chronologically. "When I was on the P.E.G.A.S.U.S. project, I tested the core of a new light-speed engine, developed in secret by Doctor Wendy Lawson while she worked with the military. She was not human, but a Kree. She was building the engine to help the Skrulls, another alien race."
"Very cool," Steve was whispering. "I wish I had my sketchbook, you're so beautiful."
"Someone’s in a hurry," Steve chuckles.
The statistics of the World Health Organization report that less than one person in ten is a Shifter, but Steve believes it must be at least twice that in reality. Until thirty years ago, being identified as a Shifter meant a life either in the armed forces, in a lab, or as a freak in a circus. Shifter rights have evolved a lot since then, but many cultures still keep their Shifter children unreported to the authorities. Heck, most churches still demand that their parishioners repress their "inner demons" at all costs.
"Wow, it's not like me to be the first to leave a party, but I'm beat," he says. "I think I'm going to use one of these rooms you just offered."
"No, wait. It's fine, really."
"Ah. In short, the ones who kidnapped me, the Krees, will probably show up sooner rather than later to either grab me again or kill me. They're strong, they're well trained, and they have lots of firepower, including spaceships. It's an all hands on deck emergency, or I'm possibly dead for real. I don't know about you guys, but I'd prefer that it didn't happen."
"Get ready," the Supreme Intelligence says. "And show no mercy. Vers has to pay for her betrayal."
"You would?"
"Good. Will Nat go with you?"
"You're going to strut right back to your seat, aren’t you?"
"I want you to come, baby."
Hair rises on Tony's arms as Gandalf guides Shadowfax through Minas Tirith. It always gives him goosebumps, even if he's watched this movie at least twelve times.
Steve had said nothing, in fact. Instead, he'd cupped Tony's face with his large hands—oh so careful and tender in that moment—and he'd kissed him. A firm press of lips, impossible to misinterpret but for a declaration of intent. Just like that, Steve had rearranged Tony's world and made it better.
"What do you want? It's late." He knows his words are harsh, and Steve's disappointment must show because Tony's smile stiffens and his eyes turn guarded.
"No, thank you," Thor murmurs, entranced by his charge.
"Thank you. For helping with this," Steve says. "I know I should have told—"
"Take her out, you'll see," Tony says.
Steve answers after a few long seconds, his crisp edges rendered soft with sleep. His hair is slightly tousled, and the loose black T-shirt and blue pajama pants make him look mellow. God, he's gorgeous. Steve's gaze sharpens as soon as he sees it’s Tony.
"The—we've had sex on your plane many times, and I'm convinced I wasn't the first. You're a Platinum member of the Mile High Club!"
Shifters alternate between three phases of being. There's the Baseline where they are indistinguishable from Regulars, with none of their anima's characteristics. Visibly, at least, because most Shifters have increased stamina and healing powers in all phases. Several top athletes who in the past illegally played as Baselines in Regular teams were shamed and outcast, even imprisoned, when caught hiding their true nature. There's the Fully Shifted phase, when they transform into their anima form, which covers from birds to elephants, passing by mythological figures like harpies and centaurs. And there's the Half State, where Shifters can more or less modulate between the two, depending on their mastery of the transformation.
"Of course." Steve turns on his heel and hopes that Tony will follow as he walks towards the kitchen.
There we go. He's so intelligent; it's one of the many reasons Tony is smitten.
"Do you plan or just looking, or—" Tony trails off. He opens his legs a tad, just enough to be suggestive, and then grabs his cock to give it a slow stroke. It makes a pearly drop of pre-come appear at the tip, that Tony spreads around with his thumb with a visible shudder of pleasure.
"Of course," Steve says. He wonders if it will top Snowball dramatically crying earlier as she tried to get out of the weighting box, and falling over several times in the process. She's downright hilarious, and a total drama queen.
"I think… I think we need to talk," Steve says, taking his cowl off. He's absolutely lovely with his tousled hair and bright pink cheeks from the icy wind on the trip back.
"He was lost in the Decimation?"
"Yes."
"Fine, it was good."
For a moment, everything is wonderful. Steve pushes into the touch and brings up a large hand to delicately cradle Tony's neck. He kisses back and groans, low and sexy, which makes a shiver go down Tony's spine. But just as Tony teases the seam of Steve's plush mouth with his tongue, Steve rears back violently. He gets away so fast that he stumbles off the bed.
Tony is both entertained and exasperated at them, but the brawl is getting more heated so he can't spare much attention to their cock fight. Ha.
He trails off, and Tony understands with perfect clarity that Steve has been blaming himself for Tony's presumed death all of this time.
"No, lies are everything that Yon-Rogg and the rest of them told you since they took you. Let me guess, you don't remember a single thing from before a supposed accident. The Skrulls killed your family-"
"Huh. Your boyfriend?" Tal asks Tony.
Van-Igha tilts her head to the side. "And who's that, your guard dog?"
But Steve's doom scenario didn't consider Tony. Their shortstop reacts in an instant, too, with an incredible bound to his left. He somehow catches the ball, securing one out, which makes Ward hiss in frustration. He didn't even have the time to transform into his puma anima. But that's not all: Tony also twists in mid-air, rotating his tail as a counterweight, and makes a beautiful hard throw to first base. Hyena-Rumlow, who'd started running as soon as Ward connected, realizes too late that he's toast. He tries to run back to first, but Bucky gets the ball before he arrives, wide smile displaying his razor-sharp teeth.
Anthony doesn't remember his mother, although he sometimes gets flashes of a kind, blond woman in his dreams that
"Fuck!" he exclaims, shocked when he feels Tony swallow around his length. The final blow comes from seeing how blissed out Tony looks, glinting fathomless pupils in half-lidded eyes, his face flushed and pretty lips stretched wide while encircling Steve's dick. It's the hottest thing that he's ever seen. "I'm gonna—"
Steve's eyes widen comically.
tech, after all.
Surely it's okay to ask, at least a bit. "How is he?"
"I know, I know," Steve admits. When the team began living together, Steve thought Tony couldn't take care of himself. He eventually realized that Tony skipped organized meals, but he did eat. Sleep is another matter, though, but not one Steve wants to argue about today.
"Thanks. How did you even pass it through security?"
The reality is probably a mix of that and Tony's experience with multiple partners. Steve appreciates reaping the benefits of it, but doesn't want to think about Tony with anyone else.
"What?" Now that Tony can't even imagine.
"No alien invasion, if that's what you're asking," Rhodey says. "But JARVIS and I continued to deploy the Iron Legion. Lots of fights to dig up Hydra, which makes even more sense if you tell me Cap knew about Barnes for the last two years."
"I saw Carol burst into flames earlier. Can you do that?"
That being said, having Tony back at the Compound would be great. For one, Tony wouldn't be by himself in this big tower and the team could make sure he's fine. And maybe, when the time is right, Steve can grow a pair and ask him out.
“Yes. In a way that makes sense to us.”
"That sounds really skeevy," Tony says, but the corner of his mouth raises up in a half smile and Steve wants to crow at his success.
Steve winces. "Of course not. I'm sorry for scaring you. You weren't supposed to see me, I wasn't careful enough."
Tony doesn't seem bothered, in fact, he looks happy to keep the kid.
"Love you too."
"Newbies are welcome if they have 5,000 credits," the croupier says.
Tony would prefer getting his bearings before that conversation. "Not right now, but I'll call her soon, I promise. What about—"
"Answers, please!" Rhodey insists. He doesn't seem to mind Tony encroaching on his personal space though, even resettles so they're more comfortable. They've watched lots of movies like this over the years, and it's easy to slot back together.
Steve doesn't seem to like it either and is now frowning.
"Of course you'd want to help. You always want to help. But there's something more you need to know. Hydra made Bucky kill your parents."
Steve smiles grimly, finally a little light in this confusing morning, but it doesn't hold. "Yeah, just like Bucky because it was him in the flesh. Hydra found Bucky after he fell. They brainwashed him and used him as a tool ever since. They'd place him in cryo between missions and reset his brain every time. He didn't know what he was doing."
"Huh," Carol says. "I could photon blast you in the head, see if it shakes something loose."
Those two have been heavily flirting—maybe more—and Tony is a bit torn about it. They'd make a fantastic couple, and seem to get along great, that's not in question. But with Carol's work that is mainly in other galaxies, it would be quite the long distance relationship, which wouldn't be easy. Then again, it's their problem; who is Tony to judge?
Over the last years, Tony has tried to keep his vanity in check, but so much of his identity used to be about his image that it's hard to let go. Steve's words are more of a reassurance than he knows. But even so, he looks like an old man!
The Siberian bunker seems empty, at least at first. They follow Barnes, who even with his machine gun looks borderline skittish, which reinforces the aura of danger they're facing. Tony could have gone in only in his undersuit—he doubts whatever awaits them can withstand his powers—but he preferred putting on the armor to have JARVIS with them. It proves to be a great idea when they enter a vast chamber with a circle of capsules holding what can only be the super soldiers.
"Look, we don't have time for this shit. Things just changed, and we can't afford a split team. Even the damn Accords will have to be put on the back burner. But I still have to bring you in so Ross doesn't send a J-SOC unit to shoot you in the head on sight."
"We have a slight issue," Nebula says. She’s gone from one door to the other inside the pavillon and now has a frown on her face.
"Sure," Viv says. Now that the surprise has passed, she doesn't seem to care one way or the other. "I'll let you in consulting room two, Doctor Martin will be with you shortly."
"Sorry, Uncle Rhodey!" Morgan replies. "But Dad is Iron Man, he can do anything!"
Steve is pale as a ghost. He drops his hand from Tony's back, and Tony misses the contact immediately or at least he does until Steve speaks. "I didn't tell you."
"Ah, fuck," Carol says, getting in a fighting stance and facing the new threat.
It would be great to have his best friend on board. Rhodey's always been fantastic at calming Tony down and constantly gives him perspective.
One loss too many, it seems. Steve always walked a tightrope mental-health wise. Clearly traumatized—who wouldn't be, with what he went through?—and too proud to ask for help.
Yon-Rogg's mouth turns down, vexed. "It didn't take much for Vers to corrupt you."
Steve blinks, as if surprised Tony asked at all.
"That's it, run!" Tony yells, then powers down the core with the remote and makes eye contact with Wanda.
"There you are!" she says brightly.
"Fans all over, huh?" Tony teases.
What is certain is that he's completely lost now. Tony doesn't know how long he's been walking when he spots the light of a small fire in the distance and hope surges in his chest. Oh, thank God, he found them again. Unfortunately, there's also a low growl—close, way too close—that makes the hair rise all over Tony's body.
"You hold your own, old man," Tony teases.
"Oh shit, I am so sorry!" Steve apologizes, guilt twisting his stomach as he thumbs away a tear that leaked from Tony's eyes.
"So practical," Tony says, cheeky.
"With a ring and everything," Carol says, who's walking over to offer her congratulations too. "Very cute. So you're Captain America, huh?"
Baylee grabs the card and uses it to salute Carol. "Got it, Captain. Holler if you want me to come back."
"In the Meeting Room, last I knew," Jarvis says as he puts the broom in its usual cupboard.
"Sounds great, but not right now," Carol says. She pushes a little plastic card towards Baylee. "Flag the table as yours, though."
"I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized... there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw."
"Morning," Steve murmurs, voice scratchy with sleep.
"I know, and I won't," Steve says, dead serious.
"Damn right," Tony says, grabbing a perfect ass cheek. "This is years in the making, by my count."
"Nah, only if she goes by herself." He doesn't want to traumatize her.
"The best hand is an uninterrupted series, with all different colors," he says, leaning into Tony. "The higher the value, the better."
"Tony. When you left, when you died, my world collapsed again. I am so, so grateful that you are back in my life to make it worth living once more, just like when we met and grew to know each other the first time. I love you, and you would make me the happiest man on Earth, in the Universe, if you agreed to share your future with mine, to make it ours. Tony Stark, love of my life, would you do me the honor of becoming my husband?"
"I'm going to bed," Rhodes says. "You should too. We're leaving early."
Thor isn’t on the contact list. Tony thought he would have solved the electricity surge problem by now, or maybe he did and Thor just doesn't want a phone. What is strange, though, is that Tony has to do a search to find Clint's thread: they haven't texted since 2015. He's shocked that his conversation with Steve stopped about a year later, in June 2016. Steve isn't a big texter from what he still remembers, but the last thing Tony said to him was "Come on, please call me. It's important!" and then nothing. What did Tony do for Steve to not want to talk to him? For seven years? And Clint too! Something happened, it must have, and Tony almost gets up to go ask questions, but he's not in the mood to learn how badly he fucked up.
He won't guilt trip Tony like that, though, so he keeps the words in and grabs his backpack instead, making for the door.
"Oh, you're strong too!" Morgan says, looking impressed. It's probably ridiculous how much it pleases Steve.
"So I've heard about the return of the prodigal son and daughter," he drawls.
"You can talk it out when we're back where we're supposed to be," Sue says. She takes her husband's hand and grabs her brother's sleeve, who is holding up Electro with Grimm. "Everyone grab your neighbor, we're going through."
"Well played Vers, Anthony," Yon-Rogg says. He's kneeling a few feet away, hands webbed behind his back. He also has a split lip and a bruise high on his left cheekbone. Tony has an inkling about who tried to rearrange his face.
"I'm not sure I want to know, to be honest."
"Steve," Tony says, extending the black kitten towards him. Her little eyes are closed again, as she's fast asleep. "Meet Snowball."
Which reminds Tony that he has questions. "Would he die if left here?"
"I wouldn't expect anything less from you."
"Sovereign."
Steve laughs. "It's the normal age to—" he starts.
"C'mere," he tells Steve. "I'll fly you there too."
"That's mine. Iron Man. War Machine is back to gunmetal gray after a stint in red, white, and blue a few years back as the Iron Patriot. What a stupid name. Speaking of... Before that embarrassing stroll down memory lane, you talked about Fury. Nick Fury?"
"Good!" She fixes Tony's hair as she's done a million times. Pepper then looks at Steve, who hasn't been further than ten feet from Tony since the Quinjet, and tilts her head. "Hi Steve, it's wonderful to see you too. And it's lovely to see you smile again!"
"Yeah, she's a third heavier than her sister. In fact, Doc Martin said they're on opposite ends of a regular growth curve," Tony says as he calls Snowball over, who continues meowing with insistence. "By the way, he hates when I call him that and says it's neither funny nor original."
Agreeing to this space road trip and hoping that it would put to rest the last of the unease with Steve.
They face the now-quiet guests, two hundred people or so by Tony's quick count, most in rich attire or partial armor. It's an impressive-looking crowd, but Tony was expecting it.
"I am so sorry, Tony, so sorry."
"No, but I work at the convenience store right there," he says, pointing.
"The explosion, he was too close."
"Banturia’s the place with the hospital."
"Yes, please," he says as Steve takes hold of his hand and slides the ring on his finger once more, then kisses it, making something settle in Tony's chest.
"Steve!"
"Save everything, Fri."
"Me too. I was lost without you. I am so grateful that you're back."
Steve snorts as he kicks the guy away, but he throws Tony a fond look. "God help me, but I do."
Steve sips his drink and can already feel its warmth soothing his nerves. This surprise visit is going fine, falling into their usual good banter.
She then walked on him, her claws digging in his side expressly to tickle. Her eyes were bright as she reveled in making him squirm. Two could play that game, so Tony moved fast and caught her legs, then used his other hand to dig his fingers at the juncture of wing and body. Cora squawked in outrage, flapping her wings as she tried to get away.
"Alright." So Tony eventually earns Steve's forgiveness; that's great. It comes to reason that Steve will want to give it again. Hell, he wants to. It's clear as day. Tony drums his fingers on his sternum. "Okay. So it can wait until tomorrow."
"That's it, use your tongue. So good," Tony praises, petting Steve's head. "That pretty mouth looks amazing around my cock. Hell, you're gorgeous all over."
"Okay, fair, but I'm sure I can do it," Tony argues. "I have little to do at the moment, honestly. If you tell me exactly what to do, I swear I'll follow the instructions. Just until you find good people for them."
"Good to know. And kink shared, by the way."
"Will you let me take my gun now?" Tony asks, eyeing it. As much as he hates Hydra, they aren't the biggest threat to him right at this moment.
"There's that vibe, you know? The Bolivian president has clashed with the current administration, and elections are coming up. Equally plausible is that they have a shady dealer of Chitauri tech based here in America. As you know, I took over the Department of Damage Control with the federal government, but we couldn't round up
Steve is gazing in the distance, subdued. Probably taking in how much Thor lost. Tony wonders if Steve was witness to any of it.
There's suddenly a newcomer at Steve's side with a maroon, black, and light gray suit, who opens his metallic helmet with red eyes to gape. Tony doesn't know where he came from.
Almost losing Rhodey in Germany, but the renewed lesson on how fucking strong his best friend is.
"Popcorn?"
"Dearest Anthony," Thor says as he finally lets go. Suddenly, why the Kree called him Anthony instead of Tony makes a lot more sense. Thor only pushes Tony far enough away to examine him, enormous hands still holding his shoulder. "I am so pleased to see you again. I thought it would only be in Valhalla."
Cora makes a scoffing noise that draws Frigga’s attention.
"Look at this sweetheart," Tony croons. He's convinced he should know her, and it's frustrating when there's nothing in his mind to back it up.
"Someone figured out time travel," he says with disbelief.
"Oh thank God," Grimm adds.
Orange Lady on his left picks a tile from Kol, who without surprise steals Tony's newest one. It's exactly what Tony hoped for, and he takes a mid-level yellow tile from the dealer and puts it facedown. He's perfected his poker face a long time ago, and he hopes that it's as effective as it used to be because he's got a fantastic hidden deck right now. And there's only one hand to go.
Tony has deviated to go around the bin but stops when Steve opens the lid and peers in. The smell of garbage is terrible, not helped by the hot weather, but the sound is clearer now.
The blowjob isn't all, as Steve is stretching him too, which only adds to the onslaught of pleasure. Those fingers feel huge, but he's gentle, at least at first. Greedy for it, Tony moves in counterpoint to Steve's movement, and they easily fall into a rhythm. And then Steve finds Tony's prostate, and that's almost his undoing. But it’s not, only because it looks as if Steve can read his mind and backs off when it gets too intense.
Who knew that threats of violence could be so heartwarming?
"Yes!" Anthony crows, pleased with himself. Take that, traitor. And it wasn't even that hard.
"We could hang out here, maybe?" Tony says, throwing Steve an uncertain look.
It makes Steve groan in dismay, mouth forming a disappointed pout.
"The more we wait, the stronger she'll become," Anthony argues once more.
Unsurprisingly, it's an appreciated sentiment, and cheers and applause break out again. They sit down and the food is brought in, plentiful in variety and sheer quantity. Curious, Tony doesn't take more than a few bites from each dish but samples everything. There is very little that he doesn't like, but he's never been picky. Traveling all over the world from a young age helped with that, he supposes. Tony avoids drinking too much, sticking to wine when the mead proves to be potent. By his side, Steve is less careful, and as he drinks his posture relaxes, his smile widens, and he talks and laughs louder. He's almost inhaling the food placed before him, which everyone around them rejoices in, Thor in particular. Tony will have to ask for a sample—or a barrel—of the mead. He'd love to analyze it with Bruce: a tipsy Steve is fun, but maybe there's something in there that could lead to a relaxant or a painkiller that beats the serum, too.
The reporters shout out, trying to catch his attention. "Mister Stark!"
Nama has also spotted Tony's damaged hand. "Are you Stark?" he asks.
"It's been a wonderful evening, Chancellor," Steve says.
"That would sour a relationship," Tony agrees. "And now the Sovereign want to meet us. "
"I am so sorry," Steve whispers.
"Geez, strike a last blow to my poor ticker, why don't you?" Tony breathes out.
"Yeah, me too," Tony adds. The Kree want that light-speed engine more than anything, they'll at least risk it.
"The Guardians had a contract with the Sovereigns where the payment was Nebula. The Sovereign captured her while she tried to steal a power source. Batteries. The Guardians did the job, picked up Nebula, but then stole the batteries too," Carol says.
"Yeah. To help with the kittens," Steve says, with what he hopes looks like a casual shrug.
"Oh, yeah, she would. I think it can wait. What about you?" Tony asks. "Anything planned?"
"Aww, come on," Sam drawls. "The water's good."
In the box, the kittens are bumping into each other, searching for Tony, maybe. From the documentation Steve and Tony got from Doctor Martin, they mostly use touch and smell to navigate the world around them, and their eyes won't open for another week or so.
"Yeah. Translating the notes first, but soon I was building it. That's when Yon-Rogg showed up."
"Could everyone take their seat, please? We're ready to start!" She grinning wide, excited.
"Helping others find the redemption you were lucky enough to find. Makes sense to me. What I don't get is why you have to do it
"I guess. It's not a walk of shame if you don't have any! What can I say, I'm proud of having been railed by Captain America. Don't huff like a disgruntled bull, it's the truth."
"I've been ready, Smurfette."
Steve is breathing hard, pupils now blown wide. "Yeah. I can't wait. I want you too, so much."
Natasha.
Yes, this is a fantastic day. And tomorrow? Promises to be even better.
Steve's hand stops moving and there's a long pause before he answers.
"Sorry," Tony apologizes again. He looks sheepish, and Steve is just starting to grasp how insecure Tony is with him. It's both endearing—in how it shows how much Tony cares—and a little sad. Only three weeks ago, before they started dating, Steve was convinced that Tony was made of pure confidence and every inch the playboy he claimed to be.
But Steve is so much more than that. After clashing hard at first, they had learned each other's language. And once they stopped perceiving attacks in the way the other talked, they got along great. They'd even started seeking each other's presence more and more. If Iron Man and Captain America were a formidable duo on the field from the get go, eventually Steve and Tony grew to be close friends. And then more.
Steve rears back in surprise. "What? No."
"He's great and a good kid. Extremely strong—probably the strongest of us all. Science whiz. He has web shooters he made himself and uses them to trap people or grab things, and he swings like Tarzan between buildings in New York."
"Uh-huh. We had a time-space GPS, so to speak. So the plan was to travel back in time to known past locations of the stones, grab them, and use the stones ourselves to bring back everyone and everything lost in the Decimation."
"Fair enough," Tony says. He turns in his chair and rests his chin on his hand, watching her straight on. "I'm sorry I forgot." He feels as if he's letting Nebula down somehow.
"He's what, eighteen?" Steve grumbles.
"That I want you? Of course. That I won't fuck it up? Not so much," Tony says, his smile faltering. It's understandable that he's nervous; the end of his relationship with Pepper wasn’t easy.
"It's okay. I know this is a lot."
Of course he noticed Tony's nerves. Over the last two years, they've learned how to read each other's moods. To be fair, they could only improve after the clusterfuck of their first interactions.
Okay, now is not the time to think about that. Steve's here as a concerned friend, with no ulterior motive. And the first part of Steve's plan is working like a charm; Tony all but inhales his first burger and helping of fries, and is still going strong with the second sandwich.
Tony huffs in amusement. "I thought it wasn't long enough. Didn't figure I'd have to climb back up there eleven gazillion times in a row. But believe me, I will."
"My intended," Tony says, using the Kree vernacular. "And he told you to get out. I'd do it before he gets really angry."
"Oh!" Tony gathers the boy even closer, protective. Steve knows without a doubt that he'd give his life for this random child he has only known for a few minutes. "Don't worry, sweetheart, you'll be fine."
A charming, long-haired brunette alien with a bikini made of a cascade of delicate golden chains sashays to their table with painted lips and huge green eyes.
"Sort of. We've hit them often enough that I know there were rumors," Steve says.
"Yes." Steve's blood is pumping again at the mere suggestion of fucking Tony, even though he's too fresh from his orgasm to get hard. It won't take long. "I want that too, I want you," he says, happy when Tony smiles.
"Meraviglia, my reputation as one of the most skilled ass worshippers in the Western world is verified and plenty earned," he says with a playful eyebrow waggle. Granted, those skills were used in a very different context, but still. "I've never had any complaints."
"Yes." She looks around until she finds a piece of paper and folds it into a small triangle. She then sits across the table from him. "Get in position," she says, holding the paper triangle up with a mechanical finger, ready to flick it his way. Huh. Tony had no idea paper football was common throughout the galaxy.
Tony leans into Nebula as he leaves the dance floor.
Tony shakes his head as he picks the black kitten and brings her up for a kiss between her ears. "You're the one who insisted on naming them!"
"Thor’s had a rough few years. He lost Asgard, his sister, both his parents, his friends, and Loki, sort of."
. There’s a mess of scars, but they’re mostly white. Old news. But then his eyes catch on his right hand and arm, covered with much fresher marks, slightly raised and pink. "Fuck, it's gone! What happened to me? Am I dying?"
"Perfect," Tony says.
"Tony!"
Over his shoulder, Steve goes from concerned to amused.
He sure hopes not, because that would practically be a death sentence. Or, if they live forever like this, a likelihood of never going home while haunting a reality not their own.
Bucky looks relieved and starts pushing Zemo out. "Got it."
"If there's money left," Tony confirms, aiming two repulsor blasts at Krees that FRIDAY detected behind the containers to the left. Nebula has taken control of her own adversaries in the cluster she chose for herself. "I'm afraid the Krees are making a mess."
"That's what I wanted to say."
Rhodey continues his story. "They brought in a psychiatrist to evaluate Barnes. But he broke out of his bonds and began a rampage. Too bad, because I think I was just about to convince Steve to work with me on the Accords, from within. But when Barnes escaped, Steve and Sam followed. That was 12 hours ago, and Ross gave me 36 to bring them in or he puts out a shoot to kill order."
"Are you serious?" Steve doesn't want to believe that, but it's possible.
. It makes Tony reevaluate everything he thought he knew.
"Fan mail had multiple invites from middle school students enrolled in Thomas Jefferson's University Saturday Academy, in Philadelphia. Their science fair is this afternoon."  FRIDAY puts the colorful advertisement on the screen, then switches to a slick and polished flyer. "And the Unicef Snowflake Ball, eight-thirty tonight at Cipriani Wall Street. Optional since Ms Romanov and Captain Rogers already confirmed."
The Supreme Intelligence's blue eyes are amused as he raises an eyebrow. "Aren't you?"
Steve doesn't answer, but he's dressing up too. When Tony enters the kitchen, both Carol and Nebula turn to look at him. The furrow of Nebula's brow, and the way she's trying to glare past Tony in Steve's direction, makes him realize that they heard part of the argument through the wall. It's slightly embarrassing, but there's nothing he can do about it.
Steve frowns. "What happened?"
"Oh thank God, you made up," Rhodey exclaims while Pepper's own smile widens and she leans in to kiss both his and Steve's cheeks in congratulation.
"How long until we're there?"
he's called Carol Warbird before. Even remembers her pleased little smirk the first time he used it. "Looks as if stuff is now slowly coming back to me."
The black kitten keeps meowing in the box, stealing Tony's attention, who pets her with two fingers.
"Children are a blessing," she says, wistful now, and looking in the distance.
"Yes. In many things."
Steve lifts a shoulder. It's so weird to hear him say “vibe.” He adapted over the years, it seems.
"And as always, you do it too much," Nebula replies.
Tony has—almost reluctantly—made a new friend. Jerôme is no Rhodey, but he's smart, and they work well together.
Steve also looks constipated—okay, concerned. "FRIDAY?"
"He said that, huh?" Tony murmurs.
"JARVIS, please stand down for recognition protocol. It's me, Tony. And a friend."
In a ploy to assuage his own nerves, Tony climbs on Steve's lap. If Steve's hands immediately hold Tony's hips to steady him, his brows stay knitted as he looks at him in puzzlement.
"You really think this will draw the Kree here?" Steve asks, inclining his head towards the core.
"What's your bad news," Steve asks. Tony must make a face because he clarifies. "Nat said it was a good news bad news situation."
"A baby?" It stumps Steve totally. A boy, he assumes, dressed in blue with a yellow beehive on the front of his shirt.
"How about both?"
Which clarifies absolutely nothing. "But I didn't buy any figs?"
Tony kisses him, soft and loving, hoping that his regard is clear. Steve delightfully yields into it, giving back in kind.
"Yeah?" Steve can feel Tony hard as a rock against his hip, slick with early release and he
Of course not, and Steve feels like an insensitive jerk for even suggesting it. "I understand."
Tony gestures to Disorganized Guy to replace his stolen tile already,
"Closer to the door, if you don't mind."
Tony doesn't know what he was expecting, but that throws him off.
"Siberia." Steve slides a paper with coordinates on it over the console.
Tony smiles encouragingly. "And you said it, we're good now. We got over it."
"Yes! That's it!"
Carol winks. "I wouldn't call people who live here fans, per se, but sure.”
"You retired, married Pepper, had Morgan. You were out. After the Decimation, we tried to get on with our lives. Then five years later, Scott—another Avenger—got unstuck from the quantum realm where he'd been all this time and had an idea."
Tony turns his head to the right and sees an older woman, he'd guess in her late seventies, sitting in the next chair and gazing indulgently at him. He didn't even know he had company. It's only after a few seconds that he recognizes her as Chancellor Almar, a member of the planet's high council.
"You keep your clothes during the shift?"
"Yeah, because you're ridiculous. But I love you anyway."
"Yeah?" He won't say it out loud, but he's honestly terrified of fucking it up. He didn't have the best role model. "I wonder where I got that from."
"You could have died!" Steve was a tad too intense for the situation in Tony's opinion.
They bump against each other one morning, Tony turning the corner to go into the kitchen while Steve is leaving it. It's an actual collision and it feels like bouncing off a rock, but Steve catches Tony's upper arms so he doesn't ricochet into the door frame or the wall.
"Clearly you'll be an awesome dad, Tony. But maybe just not right now." They're still at the Academy, and way too young to care for kids, in Steve's opinion.
"Where's yours?" Tony asks Carol. Steve implied that she didn't spend a lot of time on Earth.
"I can take care of myself on a battlefield and you know it," Hildr says. It has the air of a long-disputed argument.
The opposite-from-a-compliment (it's been a sore point for over four hundred years, he's aware he has issues) makes Tony huff fondly. There is no denying it: he's in love.
"Iron Man times five at a minimum, probably way more. No suit needed. I can fly, shoot photon blasts, manipulate cosmic energy, even enter binary mode, which is crazy cool. Also, superhuman strength, speed, endurance, and reflexes. Plus long lasting youth, it seems. It's amazing."
"Get out of here." He needed time to process, and Tony didn't want to say or do something he wouldn't be able to take back. Like punching Steve in the face.
Steve snorts.
But Carol, though. Carol taking care of the Kree ship once she has it where she wants it is a thing of beauty. She’s lit up in an aura of flames, bright in the night sky, so powerful she's cutting into the little vessel like a hot knife through butter.
"The Accords are tying your hands and we must act fast," Steve says. He makes a small grimace. "Plus, we need a Quinjet."
Yon-Rogg's mouth pinches, but he relents. "Fine, let's go on the outside training course."
"What?"
"Be still, my beating heart. How things change in eleven years."
When Tony left for his home to continue his rehab, they began texting more and more frequently, then added video calls. They still play chess at least once a month and redo the world on the regular. Some days, they keep a link open while doing their own things just to virtually hang out, Tony creating a better future while Steve works on his own assignments.
"Then come. I want to feel you."
"Touché," Anthony admits.
He rocks her for a few more seconds before looking at Thor, who’s sitting cross-legged on the floor. He has an arm looped around his lioness, seated tall and proud by his side.
"Yeah?" Steve says, certain that his smile is taking over his entire face.
"I suppose that I found out, and then we didn't talk for seven years."
"Yes. And history repeated itself. He wanted the core, I made it blow up, Yon-Rogg kidnapped me. And brainwashed me to make me want to fight Carol."
"Tony? I think it's time we go see our common friend." Carol points towards Yon-Rogg.
"That's so cool," Steve says, enthused.
"I do.”
The End
"Would you prefer coffee?" he offers.
"So they knew about you?"
After a pause he chuckles, and Tony wonders why until Steve smiles at him. "Buck said thanks for the warning and that he won't shoot then."
"Good job. You're loading the Quinjet?" Steve can hear the team going through a checklist in the background.
Steve would appreciate it if the universe could give him a break, just for once. He glares at the phone that is vibrating on the table and wishes he could throw it at the wall.
Steve is damn lucky to have had an open-minded entourage when he presented as a centaur at puberty. It helped that his mother is a selkie, so she knew what Steve would go through. Sarah also believes that Shifters have to stand up tall and strong, and made Steve promise to always be proud of what she calls a gift instead of a curse.
"Ah dammit, don't make that face! It was a joke."
"They are
Tony has one of the smoothest transformations from Half State to Full Shift that Steve has ever seen, and he's an 18 year old freshman. He's a rarely recorded cheetah, and perhaps to defy expectations - or to annoy Dean Fury, also very possible - he forwent track to join the baseball team. He fits right into their infield at shortstop, with panther-T'Challa on third and lioness-Carol on second. Wolf-Bucky on first is the odd one out, but he can keep up.
"I’m aware I should know you, but for the moment I don't," Tony says. "Sorry about that."
"Yeah, me too." Tony resettles on his seat.
“Likewise. And what are
"Take your shirt off," Tony demands after letting him go (which is almost disappointing, Steve really enjoys the hair-pulling). "I want to see those lovely shoulders."
"I guessed as much," Steve says. Work is how Tony deals with most problems. "Thanks for helping me with this. I won't insist on staying if he wants me gone."
"As long as you promise not to give me heart attacks like that anymore," Tony replies.
"No. They’re perfect."
"Hello, you," Tony says, carding his fingers in Steve's hair.
When they get back to Leipzig, the Joint Counter Terrorist Center branch of the CIA under the command of another Ross, Everett this time, is present to collect Zemo. Fortunately, this more sensible Ross agrees to listen about the potential Kree problem before arresting the Avengers. He therefore accompanies Steve, Bucky, and Tony as they rejoin the others, who've commandeered a meeting room in the airport.
"And we have things under control over here." Nat's poise does inspire confidence.
"I could do this one? If it would help?"
They’re being fired at, and the nanites shape into a blue energy shield that Tony uses to protect Steve and himself at the same time. That's new and came instinctively, but he's glad for it. Steve doesn't have his own shield, so he's practically defenseless (if that can ever be said of Captain America). Nebula is right behind them, so she’s out of harm's way too for the moment.
