John’s never had a death wish. He never actively tried to end his own life. He isn’t trying now, not really. But he’s tantalizingly close to finally figuring out what the fuck is wrong with him, and he can’t stop himself.
Sherlock smiles and lets John go. “Good. Now go home and don’t wait up.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Return to the village, and from there to Musgrave Manor, I suppose.”
“I don’t think so,” Sherlock answers, locking eyes with John. “If he wanted us dead, we’d be dead. I think he wants to test me. He wants to know how I think. He wants to play.”
“What look?” Sherlock asks, confused by the non-sequitur.
John holds up a hand. “You know what, you're right. So do what you want. Nobody cares about me anyway.”
He takes it home, together with a case of bullets.
He didn’t mean to fall asleep. Shooting and cutting the video took longer than anticipated, and he hasn’t yet uploaded it. Producing new content is vital now, he needs as many social media interactions as possible if he wants to attract serious attention.
“Careful, I’ve measured the exact amount I need,” Sherlock says, trying his best not to snap at her, and not sure he’s succeeding.
"I don't want a new flatmate."
John turns towards Sherlock, curls his body around the space where Sherlock is sitting. His knees are touching Sherlock’s thigh. He doesn’t move them, and Sherlock doesn’t stir. “Thank you,” he mutters.
“Then take this the way it’s meant. You’re really bad at asking for what you want. You’ve wanted to be stage manager for two years now, and Mike’s promised you every year he’d retire, and he never has, and you never push him. You don’t go to Mrs Hudson and tell her to make you stage manager, because you assume she’ll pick Mike over you. You always assume people won’t be on your side, won’t pick you, won’t want to be with you.”
“Yes,” he answers, quietly, hoping it doesn’t show on his face how utterly terrified he is.
“Very good. Almost nobody guesses the mint.”
Sherlock looks around the room. “Janine’s used too much food colouring, Mary overmixed her batter. Neither of them have yet sieved their jam, but they might still do that. Neela’s sponges won’t rise, they will be dry and she’ll have trouble getting them all into the same shape”
Sherlock is glad he has to concentrate on traffic, because he can’t see John’s expression and he isn’t sure he wants to. “You don’t know me half as well as you think you do.” He tries for harsh, but somehow he sounds wistful.
“Fuck,” John mutters against his shoulder, voice gravelly and rough. He looks well-fucked and absolutely debauched, and Sherlock’s heart does a traitorous little stutter when John smiles at him, loose and warm and sated.
Sherlock flinches, because he knows down to his bones that John isn’t only talking about Mary. Now they’re talking about the many ways, big and small, he has lied to John over the years. “I only ever wanted to protect you,” Sherlock says, and even as the words are out of his mouth he knows it’s another lie. He can’t even count the number of times he’s lied to John because it was easier, because he was lazy and didn’t feel like explaining, because he wanted to be dramatic.
Sherlock is next to last.
I know it’s too much to ask for you to actually weigh your ingredients, but a ballpark figure would help your readers immensely. Even ‘a handful’, however imprecise, would be better than just ‘add raisins’. I’m performing a public service here, standing up for the confused multitude of your followers.
John nods, giving her a self-deprecating smile. “I suppose she thought I’d have fun here. I’ve always loved baking, even when we were little.”
Suddenly, Sherlock discovers that there’s a lump in his throat and he has no idea what to say. He hasn’t talked to John in three weeks. His emails have gone unanswered. John’s mobile number is disconnected. His office phone is always answered by the surgery’s secretary. He never opened the door at Harry’s no matter how hard Sherlock knocked on it.
“They’re ready to film the judging.”
“Met any interesting people?”
“Tomorrow after work?” he asks, trying to get back to practicalities.
“I got better offers in New York. More interesting parts. I was seen more. Got a higher profile. It didn’t matter that I didn’t like it, it was the right thing to do for my career, so I did it.”
John grimaces a little as if in pain. “I’m sorry about that,” he mutters, rubbing his hand over his face. “God, I broke your nose,” he adds, and there’s a slightly hysterical tinge to his voice, like it’s almost funny but at the same time the farthest from it he can think of.
John’s home for exactly five seconds when Billy knocks, and from the ashen colour of his face, John knows it’s not good news.
“That’s rubbish, and you know it. If you tripped me, you wanted to hurt me, so it will affect me differently. My leg may be equally broken, but I won’t feel the same way about it.”
It’s Tuesday, and Sherlock is making a large batch of rosehip-currant jam. He has an order for ten kilos from Angelo’s, who’s using it as filling for bomboloni, and he’s stirring the large vat in his kitchen.
John’s breath hitches when Sherlock settles on him, and the brush of John’s naked cock over Sherlock’s clothes makes them both shudder. “Let me,” Sherlock mutters into John’s mouth as he leans down and kisses the smug smile from John’s lips. “Let me.”
“You are my business. Literally.”
John rolls his eyes, but he takes another bite. “The poppy seed base is a bit too dry. And something is missing, I’m not sure what. There aren’t any raisins in this, are there?”
Without really thinking about it, John walks over to Sherlock and hugs him.
John smiles back, warmed by her obvious concern. “Nothing anyone can do, I’m afraid.”
John approaches as stealthily as he can, occasionally switching grips on the nasty-looking fire iron Ginger gave him to wipe his sweaty palms on his pants.
Sherlock makes tea and slices off a piece of his filo strudel. He plates it up and takes the tea and the plate over to Mr Chatterjee. “Here, try this.”
Sherlock passes out after the first two stitches, which is just as well, because it makes it a lot easier for the doctor to stitch up and re-bandage Sherlock’s wound.
“Have fun,” Mr Chatterjee calls back from behind the counter before continuing to serve the line of customers. He turns to Sherlock between serving two customers. “Can you just push another tray of the croissants into the oven before you go?”
Sherlock leans down and kisses him, and John thinks back to that first kiss, that heart-pounding-life-changing-head-spinning kiss, and as he winds his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, he thinks that eleven years have changed so very much between them, but not this.
Sherlock can feel Lestrade’s gaze on them. He meets Lestrade’s eyes in the rearview mirror and raises his eyebrows, daring him to comment.
“Grub’s decent, much better than they had at my school,” he says, while helping himself to a large bowl of soup and a slice of bread.
“So,” Lestrade starts, gazing at them critically. “This is unusual. We haven’t had any newcomers in a very long time.”
John laughs and drains his cup. “Sounds about right.” He scratches the back of his head, and his smile takes on an embarrassed note. “Listen, I need to go. I’ve got work in two hours, and I need to shower and change. Do you have any idea where my trousers are?”
Molly squeals and hugs John tightly, then turns and hugs Sherlock as well, and Sherlock finds that he doesn’t mind one bit.
Sherlock gets his pie into the oven.
Sherlock grins.
“Thank you!” Mary notes down something in the binder. “Lilies or roses? I mean, I hate roses, so lilies, I guess?”
Ten minutes later, they’re walking in Regent’s Park with coffee and appallingly awful chocolate muffins. The sun is shining and it’s an objectively lovely day out, but Sherlock feels nothing of it. His head feels like it’s been stuffed with wool, and the coffee does little to dispel his exhaustion.
“Our eleven bakers will have two hours to make their delicious cakes for our judges to enjoy.”
“The one interesting thing about Kitty and Violet’s murders was how he got them to drink the poison, and he just forced them to at gunpoint. Dull,” Sherlock says dismissively.
Donovan glares at Sherlock coldly. “We keep to the facts. And the facts say this was suicide.”
“I don’t,” Sherlock gives an indignant huff.
John touches his shoulder lightly and cocks his head, smiling. Sherlock nods, and together, they cross over to stage left, and John helps Sherlock onto the ledge halfway up the stage wall where Sherlock spends his first ten minutes as Puck. John smiles at him and pats his calf like he does every night, and every night, his hand lingers a bit longer. Every  night the hands on Sherlock get more secure, and Sherlock wants nothing more than for these hands to stay on him and drag through that goddamned green paint and just smear it over Sherlock’s entire body. He wants John’s handprints on him, and he wants John to be covered in green paint, so everyone will know that John is
He mentions Sherlock by name twice, but he only implies that the baker he thinks is inferior is John.
John comes to stand next to Sherlock and gazes after Mycroft. He looks a bit shell-shocked, which in Sherlock’s experience is a normal reaction to meeting his brother. “Charming chap, your brother,” John observes, then takes a sip of his coffee. He makes an appreciative noise and takes another sip.
“Stay away from him,” John grates. Something about the way Jim says Sherlock’s name makes his hackles rise.
“Right,” Donovan agrees. “Violet Jones probably stumbled out of the Gate a few years ago, stole the files from the Watch because it interested her, and committed suicide because she felt guilty.”
John smiles at Molly reassuringly. "I know."
A taciturn groom picks John and the three other boys up from the Torquay train station and they drive for about half an hour through the falling dusk. Nobody talks much, they’re all tired and a bit apprehensive.
Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, fog begins to rise. John's skin prickles with apprehension, and the vague feeling of being watched.
He leads them through a door that says 'Employees only' in English and Feyara, and into a tiny kitchen. He gestures for them to sit down and then takes the chair opposite them with a heavy sigh. “Truth be told,” he says, looking down at his hands. “There's been a theft. And since Kitty disappeared right afterwards, I have to assume she took the object.”
“Yes, John, I know. You already told me twice.”
he wants to say, but the word sticks in his throat, because it’s not true. ‘The house where most of my things are’ is a more accurate description, but it’s a bit unwieldy. So John makes a vague gesture in the general direction of where he thinks his current place of legal residence is and leaves it to Sherlock to fill in the blanks.
“How?” Sherlock asks.
John runs up the stairs as quickly as his feet carry him. He bursts into the room, and Sherlock looks up from the book he’s reading, surprised by John’s sudden entry.
“Good plan.”
She fidgets a little with her hair and tries to smile, but she looks insecure about it. “Yesterday, when you helped me take care of Sherlock, I noticed something. You’re good at this. You didn’t flinch or look faint, even though there was blood and pain and vomit. You’ve got a pair of steady hands and a good head on your shoulders. So I wanted to make you an offer.”
“It’s make-up when it’s actually on your face,” Sally says. “When you carry it on stage in your hand, it’s a prop.”
Sherlock introduces Janine, offers tea and plays host with the odd self-awareness that the kitchen he’s standing in technically belongs to his guest.
Sherlock nods, unsure where this is going.
John looks at him speculatively. “Got any ideas?”
The killer takes two steps away from John, and John quickly gets to his feet, wincing when he straightens, holding a hand to his ribs. That’s a nasty bruise at least, if he’s lucky.
“I love wild boar,” Janine says and everybody laughs.
John sits up, straddling his hips, arse shifting against Sherlock’s erection which is pressing almost painfully against his trousers. Sherlock tries to pull him down again, but John traps his hands and grins. “Just a second. Get naked, I’ll be right back.”
John groans when he hears Sally yelling. “What now?” he mutters without moving.
Molly’s already there, setting up, and she greets him with a cheerful wave. He nods at her and sits down on the barstool at his workstation to mentally go through his bake.
He works slowly and steadily, grateful to have four hours instead of two. He melts the dark, slightly bitter chocolate and carefully lets it cool a bit before stirring it into the egg mix, just a bit at the time, cool, another bit, cool. He did a video on this and showed the audience how easy it is to end up with scrambled eggs if one does this too quickly. It’s one of his most-watched videos.
“Mary’s fiance,” John says, taking out his phone. It’s 4:30, three hours to curtain up. He calls Janine again.
“Next time we should definitely wait for Lestrade,” John whispers as Sherlock easily - too easily - picks the lock of Violet Jones’ tiny one-room flat in a tenement down by the river.
So he says nothing, and watches in silence as Mycroft rises, takes his umbrella, smoothes the crumbs from his trousers.
“You already knew you were right, and you already knew that I knew you were right. I’m a doctor, and I know where I was shot,” John says, in his ‘I’m not completely stupid, thank you’ tone. The tone he uses when he calls Sherlock on his bollocks. “Why did you really do it?”
Sherlock opens his mouth to answer, but John interrupts, “That’s not important right now, is it? How did you get here?”
Neela smirks at him over her coffee cup. “I’m looking forward to mocking everything at your wedding.”
He trails off and squints into the darkness in the direction of the tent. “What’s that?”
“Bossy,” he says and unceremoniously sits on top of Sherlock, making a low sound of pleasure that Sherlock echoes. “I like it.” He moves back in for a kiss, and all that naked skin against Sherlock’s feels insanely good. He can feel John’s erection slide against his, trapped between their bodies. He thrusts up blindly, and John grins against his lips and moves back a bit.
John snoring next to him.
“Won’t be long now,” Sherlock says, opening his eyes to watch John fidget around.
John presses his lips together to keep himself from sobbing in relief when he thinks of 221B, the quiet calm of his room, the cozy mess of the sitting room, the sounds of Mrs Hudson hoovering, the dusty carpet, the bad water pressure. He’s so tired. So tired. “And then?” he asks. “What then?”
“Enjoy it while it lasts. Three ovens, plus the headlights, and we’ll be able to melt chocolate at room temperature.”
“You?” She gestures at the two of them. “You’re children.”
He can’t help himself.
It’s the first time John is undercover as well.
Sherlock reaches out and entwines nervously trembling fingers with John’s. John gives his hand a reassuring squeeze, and Sherlock knows, in that moment, that he made the right decision. “Oh,” he says with an irrepressible smile. “I think I’ve already won.”
The car stops at a red light, and Sherlock gets out and walks away, because he is one hundred percent certain he doesn’t want to hear whatever Mycroft has to say, and he isn’t sure he’d be able to hear it through the ringing in his ears and the crunching sound of his heart breaking.
“By kissing me,” John adds, and it’s not really a question, and it’s very much a question.
“Mr. Musgrave, this is John Watson. I was wondering whether I could show him your collection?”
Sherlock takes a deep drag from his cigarette. It’s the first one today and he’s proud of himself for making it through two proofing periods and the tedious, boring judging without nicotine.
. Something terrifying. He can’t quite bring himself to look away.
“So you know there’s more to sex than just puttin’ your cock…”
“This has to be the most uncomfortable Christmas Eve I’ve ever spent,” John complains, checking his watch. It’s been about twenty minutes since the power outage, but it feels longer, sitting here in the semidarkness, alone with John.
He gets up to drink some water from the nearby brook.
John grins. “You really should quit, Lestrade, that shit will kill you.”
, no matter what Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson say) a flatmate comes down to his last landlord and the fact that he had Sherlock evicted.
“How is he?” she asks, fidgeting a little with her teacup. “He’s an odd one, your friend.”
John snorts, and Sherlock looks at him for the first time since they’ve started filming. He’s been doing his best to ignore John, and anyone else in the room. They’re just distractions, especially John, who’s wearing a blue shirt that sets off his eyes and jeans that hang off his narrow hips, showing where he’s lost weight recently.
“If this is supposed to be an apology, you’re making a mess of it,” John points out, trying to keep the irritation out of his voice. Sherlock woke him up for this?
, Sherlock deduces automatically.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, and John smiles. It’s weak and miserable, but genuine.
Sherlock shrugs and closes the door to the corridor of his mind palace where he hides the things he doesn’t want to think about anymore. “The usual. Baking.”
“If you were bored, all you needed to do was tell me. I had plenty of offers. I could have gotten you several television auditions, people who are very interested in you. I didn’t mention them because I was under the impression that you needed some time to re-acclimate yourself to life in London, and you needed some quiet time after last year.”
Again.
“Any more stories about your nanny, maybe, how she taught you to bake? The judges loved that, and the audience did too.” Emma smiles at him encouragingly. She’s one of these annoying people on whom his death glares seem to have no effect, and his most barbed comments just glide off her like she’s made of teflon.
There are a few stray chuckles from the other people around the table, and Irene starts talking to Molly about her bake for the last show before the final. But John’s eyes stay on Sherlock and he gives him that look, that
"The surprise party? For John's birthday?" Janine pauses for a few seconds. "Wait, are you not in the group chat?"
John smiles at him wistfully. “Just seems odd.“
Set just after TEH
“You know me, I’m always bored. I was lucky, I was in a lot of productions where we’d switch roles around, so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been.”
But on the nights when he can’t stand it any longer, when there’s an itch under his skin and a roaring in his mind that’s as if all the details in the world have come to live on the inside of his skull, he goes to John’s bedroom like a puppet on a sting, he admits the ugly, sordid truth: It’s too late, he’s already lost, he’s hopelessly and entirely addicted to John Watson, and there aren’t enough nicotine patches in the world to cure him.
“Have to agree with Donovan, here,” Lestrade says, scratching the back of his head, clearly uncomfortable. He shrugs. “But let’s move on, right?”
to bake?”
“Waiting isn’t going to make this any easier,” Sherlock points out, hoping to get John moving with a bit of gentle encouragement.
@thescienceofbaking.co.uk
Sherlock dismisses any thought of Lestrade with an annoyed little wave. He was spooked before, but now he’s glowing with excitement, his eyes sharp. Sherlock’s clearly enjoying this, and if John is entirely honest with himself, he is too.
Sherlock is in the kitchen, cleaning up from his latest batch, when the bell on the front door to Speedy’s dings.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner stroll over with the steadicam, John tells a funny story about his gran and how he nearly burned down the bakery making choux pastry once and forgetting it on the stove, and everybody within hearing laughs, but Sherlock can tell John’s heart isn’t in it.
Sherlock shrugs, clearly uncomfortable. “You looked like you needed it,” he says, looking pointedly at Mary, then he ducks into the room where they keep the make-up and the wigs.
“How am I supposed to know? You’ve lied to me so many times, about so many things, I have no idea how you really feel about anything,” John snaps, and he feels an odd sort of satisfaction when Mary winces.
“What time is it?”
“Likewise. You’re supposed to be clever. Can’t say you’ve impressed me yet.” This must be their killer. The voice is deep, rough but powerful. Clearly not from Temera, and clearly not from little country cottages in Sussex, either.
“There’s a decent chance that I won’t be coming back next week.”
“Harriet met me for coffee a few days ago and said I should leave you alone because I’m bad for you. And I was just wondering, am I?” he asks, his voice barely holding steady over the last few words.
“AM or PM?” Sherlock asks, turning to look at John, who gazes at him with obvious worry.
“I’m still your agent, Sherlock,” Mycroft reminds him.
“He hates sports,” John answers for Sherlock. He takes his own bowl from Mrs Hudson and starts eating. He’s ravenous. He’s always hungry these days. Probably a growth spurt. Hopefully, since he’s still on the short side for his age.
He adds the rest of the sugar and shows how the dough now comes together perfectly. He then demonstrates how adding sugar helps yeast dough to rise, and explains how ingredients all react to one another.
"What group chat?" Sherlock asks, entirely confused now.
“It seemed appropriate, seeing as this is the third time I’ve kissed you,” Sherlock says, but John interrupts him.
@thescienceofbaking
“Well, I’m going to be honest here, I’m not really good at this, so I’m doing a chocolate sponge with a sun in the middle.”
“Right.” John grabs Sherlock’s coat from the hook by the door and all but shoves him in the direction of the door. “Coffee. Breakfast. Now.”
As soon as he’s out of sight, Sherlock darts into the tent, closely followed by John.
Sherlock pulls him down again and resumes carding his hands through John’s hair. “There are no addicts in my family,” he muses quietly, glad that John isn’t looking at him anymore.
“Would it make you feel better if we get married before you leave?”
John smiles at him, fondly amused. “On Tuesday, I asked her to clean her toys off the floor, and she said ‘Boring’ with your exact tone and inflection. And her favourite word is ‘Obviously’. And she scoffs at the notion that sleep is a good thing. Your bad influence.”
Sherlock looks down at the carefully put together business plan and wonders why he does this to himself, again and again. Why he gives Mycroft the chance to show him, again and again, that he will never be anything other than the screw up little brother, the second, the lesser.
“He won the challenge.”
“Who the hell is Sherlock Holmes?” Sally asks, taking a pint from Mary, who did the bar run.
“I know. Touching a prop, on Broadway I’d be ostracised,” Sherlock says, giving John a small smile.
“I’m trying to determine whether a well-aimed tennis ball could have caused the injuries in a case I’m consulting on for a Bulgarian client. Obviously.” He manages to sound defensive and superior at the same time.
For the first time in his life, Sherlock has a problem he never thought he’d have. Somebody loves him far more than he knew, or anticipated, or in any way deserves.
“The truth, Sherlock. I want the truth,” John snaps, pain and tiredness and fear wearing down his temper. “I want to know whether in your big brain you’re currently concocting a complicated scheme to get us home by somehow either truly striking a bargain with a killer or tricking him into thinking we’re going to. I think I have the right to know.”
Sherlock looks up from the microscope and examines John critically. “Go home, before you fall down.”
“John.”
The lab is dark; the only light comes from a small desk lamp that sits to his right. It smells of chemicals and bad coffee. It’s eerily quiet in here, even though a hospital never sleeps. Up there, people are being born, people are dying, people are being stitched together and people are sleeping, laughing and crying, eating and bleeding, a humming beehive of human conditions.
John's hand brushes against Sherlock’s.
“They’re leading us in the wrong direction,” Sherlock says, quietly. “What do you think?”
“It’s our job, darling.”
Two years. Two fucking years.
Sherlock grins. “This time, he’ll have me, and all the publicity a top-rated BBC programme can offer.”
Sherlock suppresses a smirk. Asserting authority while simultaneously giving Sherlock what he wants. Lestrade has indeed grown up as a director.
“Sherlock, you threw up on me. Three times.”
. The thought of not talking to him every day, not hearing his breathing at night from the other side of the room, not ever having the chance of finding out whether he wants Sherlock to kiss him again, it's nearly unbearable. And he's not sure that there's anything he can do to change that outcome. When Sherlock comes back, he'll probably apologise, and John will forgive him, but the certainty that Sherlock won't just discard him like a well-read book is gone, and John isn't sure he can easily regain it.
The door of his cell opens. A man walks in and sits down on the room’s only chair without saying a word. He’s lean, over six feet tall, dark hair and interestingly coloured eyes. He’s sharply but conservatively dressed in a bespoke three-piece suit in a dull brown. Everything about him is sharp, precise, and contained.
Billy snorts. “That’s a load of bollocks, right there. Listen, the present lot in charge, right, magistrate and all, they’re not a bad lot, but they’re stupidly naive when it comes to the Fey’a. Takin’ their word for it that the Gate is closed.”
He lets out a small frustrated sound. Sitting here going over this isn’t helping. Sherlock is asleep, has been for hours, and even when he’s conscious, he’s been so out of it he doesn’t even seem to know where he is. They’ve got him on a morphine drip, and John already knows withdrawal won’t be pretty. But at least he’s reasonably sure that Sherlock will live.
A short silence falls, and then John says, quietly, "You didn’t give me the look.”
John nods sympathetically, and takes a final bite, finishing the pie. “Maybe a bit on the mushy side? But that could just be because you carried it around in your pocket?”
This time, they don’t just stumble into the Forest. This time, they prepare.
“Over-whipping cream is one of the mistakes that every single baker has made before. Well, except me,” Sherlock says to the camera with what he hopes is a self-deprecating smile.
“Mine are ruined, I’m sure,” Neela complains, leaning her head on Molly’s shoulder.
“Great Mother, no wonder you and Holmes are both so uptight,” he gasps out, still laughing. “You’re both the most virgin of all the virgins I’ve ever known.”
For a heart-stopping second, nothing happens.
Sherlock is quiet for a long moment. "I love you too. You know that, right?"
“Oh, of course!” John takes another spoonful and spreads it over his scone. “It’s bloody delicious.”
Emma looks at him expectantly.
He runs a frustrated hand through his already messy hair and decides it’s time to bake.
John blushes a bit and rubs the back of his neck, an obviously embarrassed gesture that makes Sherlock think entirely inappropriate things, like what John smells and tastes like exactly there. “Thanks.”
They spent half the night relearning each others’ bodies, what feels good and what is too much, what tickles, what arouses, and it was even better than John remembers, because there was a sense of playfulness, of fun, that Sherlock didn’t have six years ago, he was all laser-focused intensity then, and he’s more mellow now. Still high-strung and intense and focused, but more self-assured, and somehow more sure of John, as well.
“I didn’t think you would. It’s a disgrace. I’ll complain to your superiors.”
Instead, John pushes him down into the mattress and holds Sherlock’s hands firmly over his head as he grinds their hips together. He tears the condom open with his teeth and prepares himself with shaking fingers, then takes Sherlock’s cock deep inside his body.
. He doesn’t really care about the head in the fridge and the Petri dishes in the sink, he just uses them to defend himself against being completely bullied over by Sherlock, which he will never, ever, allow.
John huffs a small laugh and makes his way upstairs. Sherlock watches the fabric of the grey slacks stretch over his arse. Then he closes John’s recipe book and follows him upstairs.
Sherlock curses himself for being an unobservant idiot, because he didn’t notice John didn’t have his cane last night, and he didn’t notice it now. He puts down his tea. “I’ll help.”
So Sherlock doesn’t sugarcoat his next answer, either. “Nothing. I hated being a child, and no episode of my life has yet lent itself to over-romanticised remembrance.”
Nothing changes, not on the surface. They eat and sleep and work and chase criminals through the dark streets of London. It rains for what seems like solid five weeks and John puts them both on vitamins so they won’t get sick. John gets sick anyway. Sherlock gets him tea and soup and mostly leaves him alone, sitting grumpily in front of the telly.
They fall asleep tangled on the couch.
Nothing moves. But he can briefly see the glimmer of a mobile phone screen lighting up. Mycroft’s people are still watching the house, then.
Sherlock opens his mouth to answer, then closes it again when he realises he has nothing whatsoever to say.
Sherlock swallows. No words come. He clears his throat. Still nothing.
“That’s the worst part of the story. The fucking sheep had to have a dressing room to itself, and we had to share.”
Sherlock swallows. “Good,” he croaks. “That was good.”
Rosie’s in tears, kneeling on John’s bed, shaking his shoulder. John is groggy with fever, and trying to calm her down while apparently doing his best to not be violently ill.
John turns to Sherlock. Messy, unruly, obnoxious, blunt to the point of rudeness, impatient Sherlock who calls him an idiot ten times a day. Who just went missing for 24 hours to track down the pickpocket who stole John’s single valuable possession.
The contestants are staying in a large, cozy house with several guest rooms and a shared kitchen and dining area. The contestants all scatter on arriving, and Sherlock goes to have a much-needed shower. He peels off his disgusting socks with a deep sigh of relief and washes off the sweat and flour and rain.
Sherlock, Molly and John make their way into the green room, all three of them on wobbly knees with exhaustion and fading adrenaline.
He’s sure about absolutely nothing else right now, but Sherlock alive means he can go about sorting out the rest of it later. Once he gets some sleep.
It takes him another day to reach the field hospital.
Sherlock huffs a laugh and straightens from where he was leaning against the side of the catering tent. “Tea, I think.” He nods at John and walks away, and finds to his surprise that the need for a cigarette isn’t as pressing anymore.
Not for one second was he worried, or afraid, not for one moment did the fear and helplessness of the victims get to him in his rapture of intellectual abstraction, not once did emotion get in the way of his purely academic enjoyment of the puzzle, the great chess game between him and Moriarty.
“Flighty? Capricious? Unable to focus your considerable talents on anything other than where to get your next hit?” Mycroft suggests.
Well, it bears repeating, I think. - SH
Sherlock still looks sceptical, but then he reluctantly nods. “All right. Why not.”
Moriarty leans down and lowers his voice, nearly whispering into John’s ear. “What does it feel like, being used and tossed aside by the world’s most mediocre baking influencer? How does it feel, getting shagged as clickbait?”
“Obviously,” Sherlock answers absently. He stops and rounds on John. “Don’t you see? The package! He’s sending a very clear message. The shoes were a threat. Look at what I do to people who get in my way. But the crystal, I think that was an offer.”
When John was in his second year of med school, his flatmate at the time was involved in a student theatre company that put on truly awful productions, but had so much fun doing it that nobody cared. They were doing an all-girls version of Richard III when their lighting tech got sick with a virulent stomach flu three days before opening. John was used to all-nighters, and helping out his flatmate was a very good excuse to delay going home for Christmas by a week, and he also had a bit of a crush on one of the actresses. He sat down with a manual, learned to operate a light desk and programmed sixty-six light cues within 24 hours. When the curtain went up on opening night, he was exhausted and hadn't slept in far too long, but as the lights dimmed, a hush fell over the audience. The curtain rose, and as he hit his first cue perfectly, John Watson fell in love with theatre.
John looks at him, a hungry gleam in his eyes. He licks his lips, an unconscious gesture, but Sherlock’s eyes are drawn to the movement anyway. His eyes snap back to John’s, and then John reaches out and fists his hands into Sherlock’s coat lapels and reels him in for a kiss.
She looked worried and told him John wasn’t doing so well.
Mary's loaves are tough and nearly inedible, so she goes home. She seems vaguely relieved, and after filming they all hang around the tent, waiting for their reaction interviews. Except Moriarty, who exits the tent with a huff and loudly insists that his reaction interview be filmed first so he can leave.
Sherlock ignores him until he’s out of the door, then closes and locks the door to his flat. “I should change the locks.”
The train is full of children like him, with handed-down, faded, ill-fitting clothes, clutching their few meagre possessions to themselves, trying not to show how scared they are.
“Stop talking, please,” John says, sure he’s going to die of embarrassment any second now. Nobody has ever talked to him about sex before. Vague jokes from his rugby mates are the most he’s ever heard about the subject.
“Believe me, I’d much prefer it if you took over the place. There are so many memories here, and I know you’d preserve some of that,” Mr Chatterjee answers, shaking his head sadly. He gestures at the swinging door to the cafe proper. “I used to measure my daughters against this post over there, you know.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “That’s your fallacy right there, John. Feelings. Emotions. They’re unreliable.”
And when John’s done wringing the thoughts out of him and replacing them with sensation, overriding Sherlock’s galloping mind with pure physical stimuli, Sherlock sleeps.
He’s not going to come. Why would he?  It’s not like Sherlock has given him a good reason to.
It’s hot and hard and immediate, no hesitation, no false starts. Sherlock’s hands are on John’s arse and John is crowding him against a nearby tree. Sherlock leans against the rough bark and pulls John in, hooking a leg over his and bringing their hips together. He’s hard enough for it to be painful, and he wants John’s hands all over him, he’s starving for it.
Sherlock doesn’t move. “Why?”
Not that they have time to partake, but the beds are soft and the bathroom is huge.
He goes into the tiny kitchen next to the rehearsal room to get himself his approximately tenth cup of over-steeped tea. Not because he thinks he necessarily needs more caffeine - he has no desire to actually vibrate out of his skin - but he needs something to do with his hands, and holding a hot cup of tea has a viscerally calming effect on him.
They’re sitting at the kitchen table, John’s medical kit open between them, and John is systematically cleaning the blood from Sherlock’s too-pale skin. Sherlock is watching him with a mixture of wariness and boredom, and John knows that Sherlock can probably guess all the words he isn’t saying, but right now that isn’t very difficult, because John would be the first to admit that he’s thinking very loudly.
John heaves a sigh and visibly deflates, as if whatever he was going to say, whatever strength he gathered has deserted him. “About six months ago. I’m getting a little far-sighted in my old age,” he says, giving Sherlock a tiny, self-deprecating smile.
“To be honest, no. I once dropped one into the oil too energetically and got burned pretty badly on my arm. You can still see the scar, here.”
“Sorry,” Sherlock finally says as he pulls back, taking a painful step out of John’s personal space.
The meeting with the BBC and their sponsor was.... disappointing. The sponsorship would extend to Sherlock using the products in his YouTube videos and featuring them at the beginning or end of every video. Since the quality of the baking equipment is adequate, this would not be a problem, but the arrangement doesn't get him any nearer to what he actually needs, which is loads of money. Now.
“What?”
“Tell you what,” John says, leaning closer to the computer screen as if whispering into Sherlock’s ear. “You come home, and I’ll get you a sex thing for your stocking. Something completely, entirely, thoroughly naughty. Deal?”
“What? When?” Sherlock asks, because it’s the first he’s heard of it. “Who was it?”
Moran steps up to John and leans down, grinning at him. “He makes me money,” he stage-whispers to John.
“No, you won’t,” Lestrade interrupts whatever Donovan was about to say. “You’ll both stay out of it. This is Watch business. We won’t press charges for the break-in because you gave us valuable information, but next time we won’t be so lenient. Understood?”
Sent: 3:33 am
John goes completely still. “What?”
John smiles at the way Sherlock says
“Oh, Jim, please. And I do very much exist.” Moriarty’s smile widens, but his eyes remain oddly dead. “I must admit I wasn’t looking forward to this show. Good for social media engagement, but  not much of a challenge.Now that you’re here, though, that has changed.  Winning against the rest of these imbecilic, talentless amateurs would have been meaningless. Winning against you, however, will be my crowning achievement.”
“No, I was giving you mixed signals the entire time-”
“Making something simple and elevating it is difficult in its own right.” Donovan gestures at the pudding. “The spice blend, the bite of the alcohol in the sauce, and the ice cream are all fantastic.” She smiles at Sherlock, and Sherlock has no trouble smiling back, because he’s pretty sure he’ll win.
Sherlock stubs out his cigarette and gets up. “I fucked it up,” he says, short and precise. Then he walks away in search of a cup of tea.
“Was he trying to get free footage for his supervillain audition?” John mutters under his breath at Sherlock.
“Problem?” he echoes his question from before.
“Your sister signed you up for the competition, is that right?” Mrs Turner asks.
“Sherlock? Any input?”
They get bad takeout and solve murders. They watch quiz shows at three in the morning that John is always better at. Sherlock discovers that John is a fantastic poker player and they play for hours, but Sherlock isn’t sure that they’re not both just using it as an excuse to stare at each other.
They leave on a fishing boat. John bribes a stoic fisherman who does regular runs to Sicily and they spend the night on board.
“Sit tight, we’ll get you out soon.”
Kick his arse, John.
Sherlock nods.
Sherlock glares back. “That’s it.”
His rescuer screams at him, calls him all sorts of names. An old lady asks if he’s all right.
It’s not an emotion he’s proud of, it’s not something he’ll ever say out loud, but he can’t help the little possessive, special thrill that goes through him whenever Sherlock introduces John as his friend.
Friday they were at the bank robbery crime scene, and Sherlock didn’t seem very interested; he didn’t give Lestrade his usual waterfall of deductions, he just laid out the most pertinent facts and left. The whole thing took ten minutes and was completely unremarkable. Saturday John was at the clinic, and Sherlock was still in his dressing gown when John came back. They watched a bit of telly and Sherlock fell asleep on the sofa. Sunday they had lunch out and walked a bit around Regent’s Park then spent the rest of the day reading in companionable silence in the sitting room. Nothing happened.
“I have a hospital full of sick people,” John says mildly.
They stand there for several minutes, completely silent. John stares at Sherlock like he’s the most heartbreaking thing John has ever seen, and it guts something in Sherlock, shocks him into speaking. “John…,” he says, hoping his voice doesn’t come out as choked as he feels.
John snorts in amusement. “When you’ve pinched an artery closed while getting shelled, everything else is relative.”
“Sally. She’s had to do it before, when Mary had pneumonia last year. It’ll be fine,” Molly says, reassuring him automatically.
“Bakers, on your marks. Get set. Bake.”
It’s Thursday, and he’s bored, so he decides to go through the bake one more time, maybe he can figure out what isn’t quite working for him. So he makes the pastry and lets it rest, then gently pulls and stretches it so it’s thin enough. He spoons in the fragrant pumpkin filling, spiced with cinnamon and cardamom, the pecans finely chopped, the cranberries as small taste capsules, exploding in the mouth, giving tartness and sweetness. Into the oven.
“That's impossible,” he whispers. “The magnet in your compass and the lodestone are attracted and repelled by the same forces.”
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock isn’t hungry, but he does want a cigarette. Badly. So he bums one from a sound tech and smokes it behind the catering tent. The nicotine settles him, and the familiar bite of the smoke and the feel of the cigarette against his lips grounds him and brings him back to himself a bit. He’s felt oddly outside of himself since he woke up in John’s bed this morning and discovered that he had no desire to leave.
Maybe he’s the only one who really knows Sherlock and genuinely
“Oddly specific, but somehow fitting.” John hesitates briefly before he continues, “You know, he said something odd to me the other day.”
@harrywatson
“Well done, John,” the blonde woman next to him says, and there are nods from around the table.
Confused, Irene follows Lestrade out into the courtyard.
This could be it, right here and now. This could be the last time they see each other. And even though Sherlock knows that if he said to John, right now,
“What?” John asks for a third time, but this time it’s more specific. “Vanished how?”
He puts a steaming mug next to Sherlock’s elbow and sits back down. For a few minutes, he just enjoys warming his hands on his own mug, slowly sipping the hot beverage. It’s oddly comforting, sitting here like this. Sherlock ignores him, but John is content just watching as he slowly and carefully dissects the rabbit, checking every organ he removes for damage. It's interesting, a bit like being back at school in Biology.
“Who are you supposed to be?” she asks, eyeing them nervously. “What about Vi?”
Sherlock nods, a tiny gesture of acknowledgement, because Victor is right, of course. It still feels odd, sitting here, both of them sober, finally grown up in a way they never were before. It’s odd, looking at Victor and realising that he doesn’t precisely recall how they even began, even though he remembers how they ended. “It’s good seeing that you’re doing well,” he finally says, because he feels he has to say something, and also because it’s true. He finally allows himself to really
to mess with my head, but Sherlock, for the love of god, stop it.”
John flinches a little, breathes in, and it’s obvious he’s trying to find something to say.
“Fantastic,” John mutters. “What do you think? Power outage?”
John shrugs, but says nothing. He’s obviously freezing, but at least he’s wearing a jumper over his pyjamas and took the time to put on shoes.
“Tell me about one of your cases, you know, before me,” he says.
“That’s absolutely none of your business, so leave him alone,” Sherlock snaps, feeling an entirely irrational surge of quick, defensive anger.
John nudges Sherlock’s thigh with his elbow. Sherlock looks up, meeting John’s eyes. “There’s nothing wrong with being like you,” John says.
They sit down on the crates Billy uses as chairs and Sherlock gets right down to business. “Billy, how did you know the victim?”
He breaks into John’s tiny house to wait for him to come home from the surgery. He makes tea and searches the house top to bottom for any clue what John is doing here.
Lya looks at the Midnight Queen, who gives her a signal to go ahead. “A few years ago, we found a young man on the beach. He’d been shipwrecked. He’d stumbled through a Gate, much like you two, and he’d come out on an island to the west of here, an island we call Thiernanoch.”
“I have orders not to kill you, but my orders say nothing about your kneecaps,” the Fey’a leader says, pointing his crossbow at John’s knees.
John is bandaging his leg with shaking hands, trying valiantly not to pass out, spitting colourful curses.
“Sherlock, do you have a minute?” Emma the contestant wrangler asks as he’s finished clearing his workstation.
Sherlock tells her and he can hear a pen scratching over paper. “Lunch before to strategize?” Janine asks.
Sherlock checks his phone. “No.”
When John gets off the plane in London, he waits for the feeling of ‘home’ to settle in. He waits for the UK damp and the grey buildings and the bland four walls of his small room to shift into the comfortingly familiar after the alien glare of the Afghanistan sun.
She looks up at him, frowning, her unruly curls falling into her face. “Is Daddy going to be okay?”
His head hurts. His clothes are damp. He’s completely disoriented.
John groans. “You’re good at that,” he mutters, voice barely audible.
Molly visibly hesitates, then lowers her eyes to the two cakes. “John’s.” She looks at Sherlock. “Sorry. The jam does make the cake more moist, and I really like it.”
Mr Chatterjee is locking the door behind him, then turns and looks around with a nostalgic sadness on his face that Sherlock can empathise with.
He starts to read the comments with increasing dread.
Sherlock turns his head and blinks at John several times.
Professional, he tells himself. Be professional. Do your bloody job, and be grateful the ex whose heart you broke is over it and prepared to act like a mature adult. It’s more than you had any right to expect.
Sarah smiles at him gently. “Anything I can do to help?”
“No.”
Sherlock smirks. “I won’t. Is that it?”
She gestures at the floor. “Sit.”
Wordlessly, John falls into step with Sherlock and they walk into the cavernous warehouse. They sneak past the Watchman who’s supposed to be guarding the door and quietly make their way into the very back, where Lestrade and Donovan are bent over a still form on the floor, red hair fanned out like a halo around her head.
“Wait and see.”
When they get to the clearing, they spread their blankets behind a thicket of bushes that hides them effectively from view, and settle down to wait. They both brought books, and they frequently change shifts so one of them is watching the clearing while the other one reads.
He stops wandering and goes looking for Sherlock.
“Don’t hotels usually have backup generators?” John asks, still staring at the communication unit.
“If you have to,” Sherlock answers, and for the first time John has known him, he actually sounds tired.
Sherlock turns off the ignition, and the radio cuts off George Michael in the middle of the word Christmas.
“Come for me,” John whispers, breath ghosting over the shell of Sherlock’s ear, and that’s it, Sherlock is lost, done, he tumbles over the edge, hard.
“Yes.”
Sherlock winces.
So his interactions with John are an entire gallery of firsts.
Sherlock picks up Rosie from the bed and hands John the waste paper basket in time for him to throw up into it.
John props himself up on one elbow and turns Sherlock’s head with a gentle finger under his chin, so Sherlock has to look at him. “I know you want some sort of certificate that says, ‘This is a good idea’, but that’s not how things work in life, Sherlock. I can’t guarantee that we won’t hurt each other horribly, you certainly have the capacity to, and I can be a right dickhead sometimes, just ask my sister. And if you think I’m not bloody terrified of this, then you're wrong."
Sherlock’s quiet. He’s been quiet for days. At first, he was all manic energy, roaming the city streets and spending hours with John at the local library, devouring every book about travelling between worlds they could find. It’s not like they’ve learned nothing. There are several known Gates. Most of them aren’t what you would call easily accessible. All of the gates on the British Isles have been closed down or destroyed. And even if they hadn’t been, nobody they’ve talked to and no book they’ve read has told them how to open a gate. And the Fey’a won’t help, because they don’t want more humans to come here.
She’s lying on her side, sleeping peacefully. The room stinks of beer, vodka and vomit. John sinks down on the floor beside her bed, strokes her hair and silently waits for her to wake up and start the whole cycle again.
Lestrade smiles. “If more people did what was necessary, maybe both this world and yours wouldn’t be in the state they’re in.” He nods at the doctor. “Molly.”
“This is a serious business proposition,” Sherlock points out, gesturing at the printed out Excel sheets and floor plans.
Sherlock turns his head to look at John, his eyes razor-sharp and hard. His voice is hard, too, and angry, when he says,“John, you have to stop assuming that I have all the answers. I’m a genius, yes, but I’m also twelve years old and stuck in a world I don’t know. I have no idea what I’m doing, all right? I’m not even a good person. And yet you follow me around like a puppy and expect me to fix everything. But I can’t. I can’t fix anything, I can’t solve this, and I can’t save you! So go away and leave me alone!”
“Then do your job,” John says, calmly meeting Mike’s glare.
Sherlock looks slightly shell-shocked, and John continues, “You didn’t even tell me you’d gotten the role. I learned it from Mrs Hudson when I came in to work the next day and you were gone. And it sort of made me question-” he makes an all-encompassing gesture with his hands “- just, everything, I guess. Our entire relationship. I thought if you didn’t find it worth your while to tell me you were leaving the country, you must’ve thought we’d just had casual fun, and I just read too much into it.”
“And what does he do? Does he bake standing on his head?”
Sent: 3:02 am
That you’re still there
Sherlock shrugs. “I wouldn’t put it past him.”
Mr. Musgrave shrugs. “I don’t know what else to tell you, Sherlock.”
Mrs Hudson sets down the pot of stew and John automatically helps her set the table and get water. Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice them, he’s reading a Feyara (the Fey’a language) newspaper, only moving when he’s turning a page. He’s still spending much, if not most of his time trying to find any and all information on the gate, trying to find a clue to how they might reopen it.
He looks over the cakes, all competently and expertly made, and acknowledges that Molly’s coffee cake and Irene’s dark chocolate are the superior bakes. They’re lighter, more professional, better balanced, more difficult.
as you used to be,” he bites out between clenched teeth. “Got all the attention out of it you were going to get and then decided it wasn’t worth it?”
Sherlock’s leaning against the wall next to the main entrance of the theatre, taking a deep drag of the cigarette he bummed from one of the stage hands and cursing himself for the biggest idiot in human history.
Sherlock has no idea what to say to that, and silence falls. It's dark and quiet and the music is soothing, and Sherlock thinks that maybe John is asleep, and even though he hates driving in London, he wants to drive all night, comfortably silent with John's breathing and Vivaldi on the radio.
They lurch a few inches, but then all movement stills. An alarm bell starts ringing.
John stares out of the window, resolving not to be the first to speak. If Mycroft has something to say to him, then he can just come right out and say it.
John sighs and gives him a tired half-smile. “I need to try to get some sleep. And you as well. I won’t even ask when you last got a good night’s sleep, because I can see it’s been too bloody long. Help me get out of this chair?”
It’s only when he rounds the corner and sees Speedy’s Sandwich Bar that he realises his feet have carried him towards Baker Street Theatre without his conscious direction. He was thinking about John, and apparently his subconscious has directed him to the place he most closely associates with him.
“Frankly, I don’t even want to know how you know she was friends with Violet Jones, but that makes this an even more open and shut case,” Lestrade says, and he rubs a hand over his face, obviously exhausted. “She had access to the poison Violet took, and had a reason to be suicidal.”
Sherlock feels himself go cold, then hot, then cold again. “Thank you,” he says, trying to keep his voice steady and succeeding so well that he knows he’s almost completely hiding how nervous he actually is.
“Mhmmm… can you wake me like this every day?” John mutters between slow, sweet kisses that are still demanding and pushy enough for Sherlock to know that John has a destination in mind.
“Wow,” John breathes and looks around the room. Sherlock watches him as he walks around, checks out the large refrigerator, the shelves and shelves of home-made jams and marmalades, of different types of sugar and flour, spices and condiments.
“Then why tell us?” Sherlock asks, as ever cutting through to the heart of the matter.
They rush down the stairs, Sherlock pulling John along, down into the wine cellar, where the boys, staff and Mr. Musgrave are already sitting on long benches. The cook is handing out blankets and biscuits.
But things can’t go on like this.
Carefully, slowly, so as to not wake John, Sherlock slides out from under him. He lets John’s hand slide from his hips to the mattress with a ridiculous pang of regret, and gets up carefully, rooting around for his clothes in the dark. He finds most of them, then slowly, carefully, clicks open the door. The corridor is cold and dimly lit by the light of the emergency exit sign.
Sherlock is waiting for him outside the clinic. “We need to figure out what Jim wants from the museum,” Sherlock says instead of a greeting, turning to walk away, assuming John will follow.
John glances in the direction of the stairs, thinking that he’d better check on Rosie.
“Was anyone here beside you?” Lya asks, glaring at him angrily.
John sets down the mug he was about to put into the dishwasher and frowns. “Okay, out with it. What’s wrong?”
Sherlock swallows around the lump in his throat, because he isn’t sure what he’s being thanked for. “You’re welcome.”
When they arrive at home, Mrs Hudson tells them a red-haired girl was looking for them.
John laughs, and Sherlock feels oddly like he just made a perfect souffle or got a tarte tatin exactly right, a small thrill of sweet, sweet victory. They look at each other for a moment, smiling. The entire room smells of cooked apples, sugar and cinnamon, and it reminds Sherlock that he hasn’t really eaten all day. His stomach rumbles loudly, and John’s smile widens.
So Sherlock has a few very good reasons why he really should wake John up.
In the meantime, he texts Billy. His usual order, from before. Billy will remember.
Molly’s cake is lovely, her hidden design is a butterfly, and her cake is decorated beautifully. The judges praise her design and the taste.
John smirks humourlessly.
Air. He needs air. He buries his face in his hands and tries very, very, very hard to breathe.
They stay like this for a long time. Sherlock has lost all sense of time and place, and it takes him a while to realize that he just had sex in an elevator, but that’s quickly eclipsed by the mind-boggling realization that he just had
John pushes the ‘Talk’ button. “Two.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Now I know who to turn to if I ever decide to go into the fortune cookie industry.”
In the end, Mycroft said the one thing Sherlock listened to. “Do you want him to live? Then you can endure seeing him sad.”
“Here, drink before you murder someone.”
If only Sherlock wasn’t still as brilliant, sarcastic, magnetic, graceful, amazing, rude, caustic, funny, gorgeous…
“Thank you, I think.” John smiles at him, openly fond and obviously amused. It should be illegal, that smile. It does things to Sherlock, to his pulse, his breath, his stomach.
“You have a lot of faith in him.” Pause. “John?”
“Now, go to bed before you fall down,” Sherlock says, tone softening. “You look absolutely terrible.”
“We couldn’t foresee that somebody would blow up the gate,” John defends himself. “We didn’t know it would get dangerous.”
“We obviously tripped a mechanism that caused the explosion,” Sherlock says, pinching his lips in frustration. For a moment he is silent, then he bursts out, “How did I not notice anything? I notice everything!”
It’s why, when John was told he wasn’t going back, that he’s been released as an invalid, that he’s going home, when he faced the void of a ‘normal’ life, dispensing pills to old ladies, curing flues and coughs, giving shots, he found that when he tried to get out of bed for the first time, his leg wouldn’t hold him anymore, and he fell flat on his face.
“We’ll see.”
There’s a short silence, then John says, “So? All that means is that he’s good enough at something he didn’t study at school that people give him money to watch him do it.” John looks at Anderson, and there’s something in his voice, something steely and yet velvety smooth, something that sends a shiver down Sherlock’s spine. “You’re just ticked off that he’s better at this than you are.”
Saturday finds him in northern Shropshire. They’re staying in a large, ugly wellness hotel that looks like it was built in the late sixties, but that’s surrounded by a very large garden, where the producers have put up the now familiar tent.
“Grimey Joe works for Jim?” John guesses.
Sherlock nods and sets the oven timer before taking a tray of freshly thawed croissants and putting them into the hot oven.
“Um…”
“Gesundheit,” Moran says, and everybody laughs, except Moriarty, who is the only person in the room who doesn't seem to find John charming.
“Let’s change the subject,” John whispers against his lips and kisses him, and Sherlock falls into the kiss, lost once more.
Sherlock makes a face that John knows means he isn’t entirely satisfied with the words that just came out of his mouth. “There’s a ridiculous amount of snogging going on as well, all very unprofessional,” he adds, and John smiles.
Sherlock’s lips quirk up into a half-smile. “I promised you I wouldn’t lie to you again, remember?”
“Sherlock, what have they given you?”
John’s grin is feral and possessive. “I think about you when I touch myself.”
Sherlock’s in the kitchen when John comes in for supper. His hands are cold and his ears are freezing, but the rest of him is warm with exercise and fun.
So far, the Bake Off social media accounts have also ignored Moriarty and his trolls, and Sherlock doesn’t think that will change any time soon. But the controversy has driven up social media engagement for all involved, and so Sherlock thinks the BBC probably loves the drama. Sherlock can only imagine how absolutely livid Moriarty must be at being ignored, and it fills him with satisfaction, in the brief moments he can bring himself to care.
Moriarty’s cake is objectively stunning. The outside is a beautiful watery blue and the inside shows several multicoloured fish. The judges think it tastes bland  - Donovan especially criticises the lack of strong flavour - but they still praise his design. Moriarty walks away looking even more smug than he already did.
John lies back down with his head pillowed on Sherlock’s chest. “I don’t have many friends,” John says quietly, and it seems like a non sequitur, but it really isn’t. “The people I knew from before… do you know what it’s like, when you know people, and then something happens, something that changes you so profoundly that the person you used to be doesn’t exist anymore? And the people you knew before still think you’re that person, and you can’t bear it when they find out you’re not?”
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock says, removing her from both himself and John. “We need to get the cake.”
"John?"
“Not much of a challenge for you, is it?” John asks, and Sherlock shrugs, since it was obviously a rhetorical question.
Sherlock snorts. “Billy will stay loyal to whomever pays him more. But at least Billy might give us a chance to outbid Jim.”
But if he says no because of John Watson, he will do what he swore he wouldn’t do. He’ll cede power over his professional life to his heart instead of his head. So in a way, this is the ultimate challenge. And Sherlock Holmes loves nothing more than a challenge.
They walk, and walk, and walk.
Finally John says, "You can let me out here, I'll catch the tube from here."
“Be grateful for my not being an arsehole. I very much am, you’re just catching me at an odd time.”
“Fine, be like that. I’ll be back later,” John sighs and leaves Sherlock alone.
Molly's on duty at the clinic when they arrive, and she takes John to an examination room immediately.
Sherlock stares at him in disbelief. “You mean ask total strangers on the internet for money.”
“What do you dream about?” Sherlock asks, not because he necessarily needs to know - obvious, really - but because he wants to get John to talk, to pull him out of that headspace where you’re so alone you doubt other people exist, even if they’re right next to you.
The crew ignore him while he checks the workstations, they’re used to him doing it by now. Emma the contestant wrangler greets him cheerfully and hands him the key and directions to their accomodation. He thanks her with a dismissive hand wave and starts setting up his equipment.
I’ll be a judge. No, seriously, Neela, Molly and I can be the judges.
“Because you’re my best man, fuckface,” Mary says and chuffs him on the shoulder affectionately.
Sherlock’s heart is pounding as loudly in his ears as the Falls when he steps out of the wood to the small clearing John has paused in to find his bearing.
“About what?” John asks wearily.
A dog barks in the distance, and he can hear the bleating of sheep from a nearby pasture, and of course the sea, pounding against the coastline, is the constant background music to life here.
“Um.”
“What’s the goal here?” John asks, and the slightly dangerous excitement is in his voice as well.
“Just tired.”
Lestrade claps his hands. “So, people. We’ve got ten rehearsal days. At least four of these days we’ll spend in tech. So let’s get started.”
Sherlock dons a pair of leather gloves and carefully unwraps the package. Inside they find a miniscule Fey'a crystal, a pair of dirty, broken down shoes, and a note.
“John, so close, you nearly won today.”
@thescienceofbaking.co.uk
John smiles at Sherlock. “After this afternoon, I thought I’d give this thing a try where I actually say what I want.”
John collapses on Sherlock’s chest, and they stay like this for a long moment. Sherlock’s hands trace patterns over John’s sweat-slicked back, and John presses little open-mouthed kisses against Sherlock’s chest.
His mobile beeps. John’s answered his text.
Sherlock looks up at him, eyes wide with surprise. He doesn’t answer, and he looks a bit like a deer in headlights, caught out and uncertain which way to run. For a long moment, he hesitates. “Yes,” he finally says. “Yes.”
“Sherlock?” Lestrade sounds hesitant, tentative. Like he has something to say that Sherlock won’t want to hear.
He needs some air. He needs to walk this off, whatever it is, so he can finally sleep. The Bake Off final is in two days, and he doesn’t want to go on national television with bags under his eyes. Before he goes, he puts one of the mince pies into a plastic bag and puts it into his coat pocket. He doesn’t let himself think of why.
Everybody laughs nervously, and John says, apparently not for the first time, “It’s a Golatsche.”
“Your bake didn’t go so well, did it?” Sherlock asks, a bit surprised that he didn’t notice.
He can hear it in his dreams, sometimes. The alarm. The flatline. He can almost feel the shocks. He sees it almost as often as he sees Sherlock jump.
John crowds him against the wall, hands finding their way unerringly under Sherlock’s coat and his suit jacket, a demanding thigh pressed between his. “You need a mint,” John whispers against his throat, and when Sherlock tilts his head back in invitation, John bites him there, ever so slightly.
Mary looks at him compassionately, like she knows what he’s thinking, which is very likely. She was there when his dad died, and she’s seen him at his worst.
“I didn’t sneak out, I left,” Sherlock says, and he doesn’t know why he’s arguing semantics with John, here, because he very much did sneak out.
The killer grins, and it’s the most chilling, humourless smile John has ever seen. “Not bad. Looks like Jim was right about you.”
They wait for a few minutes, eyes squeezed shut, concentrating on home, home, home.
Here's to this crazy, awful, thoroughly weird year, and here's to all the performers out there who have had it extra hard this year. We miss you! I hope in 2021 we can all finally put this craziness behind us. Stay healthy, guys!
Sherlock sighs. That’s actually the last thing he ever wants to tell John Watson. And if he’s entirely honest with himself, he wants to see John, he’s ravenous for it, aches for it.
Sherlock gazes thoughtfully at John, rabbit momentarily forgotten, and John feels an odd rush of adrenaline at all this razor-sharp attention directed at him. “It’s obvious from your clothes that your family doesn’t have much money, and you’re from North London, but I can barely hear it when you speak, so I’m assuming either you spent your first years at school at a boarding school and your mother brought you home when money got tight after your father passed, or you’re in one of London’s better public schools on a scholarship. Based on your academic interest in the rabbit and the fact that you play rugby I’d say the latter. Do you want me to tell you how I can tell you play rugby?”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Watson,” he says.
Sherlock?
For a moment, he hesitates. He feels oddly like he’s walking in on Sherlock doing something that he has no right to see, that is none of John’s business.
“What’s funny?” John asks, and his voice is loud after such a long silence, but there’s nothing accusing in his tone, or in the look on his face, he just sounds idly curious, and he looks utterly calm.
John rolls his eyes. “For God’s sake, I thought you had your own problems.”
“Oh, fuck off,” Janine says, but she’s smiling at him a bit crookedly, as though she knows he’s got a point.
“Sunday,” Sherlock answers, eyes still on the pig. “How did you know?”
Jim’s grin broadens, as if he’s read John’s thoughts. “You know I’m right. I can offer him the two things he wants most. A challenge, and a way home.”
“Dead no more than twelve hours. Footprints, size of shoes says killer most likely a man of above average height and build. Abandoned warehouse means premediation,” Sherlock rattles off, barely looking at Lestrade, gazing at the corpse, taking everything in. “No sign of violence, which begs the question of how he got her to take the poison. Didn’t hide her in a cellar this time, didn’t dump her in the river, so he wanted her to be found. Warning, maybe?”
“You came through the Gate. How?” one of them says in oddly-accented but clearly understandable English.
It takes the entire taxi ride back to Baker Street for the reply to come, but it’s worth the wait.
“Come back here,” Sherlock snaps, and John grins.
“Thank you.”
“John!” Distinct thread of fear in the voice, panic making it crack.
“I wouldn’t expect you to understand,” John says, and there’s something in his voice, something bitter and hurting and sad. “I love it here. I love this theatre.”
“The poppy seed-sugar-butter mix is spectacular, and I love the fruitiness of the rhubarb-strawberry,” Donovan adds, taking another bite.
“God, sorry, sorry,” John says and winces. “Wasn’t looking where I was going.” He looks over Sherlock critically. “You got anything on you?”
But he plays offhandedly, almost as an aside, to distract himself, to think, automatically and almost unconsciously, a side note, an afterthought.
The snipers hit Sherlock in the shoulder. He remembers this. He remembers pain, and water, and impact, and darkness.
Sherlock should really wake John up. John’s neck will cramp if he sleeps like this any longer, and they need to be ready to move to catch their suspect at a moment’s notice. Besides, John won’t like being caught all but snuggling against Sherlock by Lestrade, or at least Sherlock is almost sure that John won’t like it. John’s been inconsistent about this, unpredictable like he is about so many other things.
Lya and Shae melt back into the forest, and John turns to face Sherlock to reprimand him for being rude, but then he catches sight of what Sherlock has been staring at, and his jaw drops.
“Fantastic,” John mutters, and kneels down back at Mary’s side. “Mary,” he calls out, gently. “Can you hear me?”
In the morning, everything is sharp and heavy and dull, and in the cool daylight, there’s nothing warm and dark and dangerous in John’s eyes at all.
Sherlock supposes he should feel some way or another about this, should care about winning or even staying in the competition. He’s never been good at doing things as he should, though, and his apparent difficulty with regulating what he cares and doesn’t care about is pretty much the reason why he’s sitting alone at this bar, staring into a glass of whisky.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock says, and he hates that he’s sure that Mrs Hudson can hear how much the words pain him.
to, something that, apparently, his subconscious has known all along. He wants to kiss John while he’s wide awake and in full control of his faculties and his body. He wants to touch John, take him to bed, strip him naked and crawl inside him, and obviously sometimes this shows on his face, because John sometimes gives him this look that says,
“And where were you all night?” John asks by way of greeting.
It’s after midnight. John won’t respond right away.
John would really like to argue. But in truth he can barely keep his eyes open, he badly needs a change of clothes, and every bone in his body hurts.
He reaches into his coat pocket and fishes out a tiny sprig of mistletoe. Then he holds it over John’s head.
“What are you nostalgic for?” he asks, anything to prolong this quiet midnight interlude, just the two of them in the dark, eating scones, enveloped in the lovely smell of freshly baked goods.
The thing is, he’s not  entirely sure he can do this again. The whole holding himself together by the flimsiest of strings. The picking up pieces of himself and trying to fit them back together. He’s done this once - or twice - too often.
Three hours later he, Sherlock, Lestrade, Donovan and Molly are in Molly’s morgue, the dead body that used to be Grimey Joe on the slab. They found him in the exact spot Sherlock said they would, basing his deductions on the exact sort of river mud on his shoes.
Sherlock runs a hand through his hair, a highly uncharacteristic gesture of uncertainty. “Look into her mouth,” he says, barely audibly.
“So, tell me, John, who do you bake for at home?”
“Until you speak actual English,” John says, leaning against the wall behind his bed.
“When’s your birthday?” John asks, predictably, looking at him with a small frown like between his eyes, looking slightly put out, like the worst thing he’s heard all night is that Sherlock Holmes never had a birthday cake. It’s so completely like John, and Sherlock’s heart does a traitorous little John Watson induced twist.
, that
“What?” Sherlock asks and hates himself a bit for the husk in his voice.
Moriarty’s smile vanishes. “I always win, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Gorgeous,” John whispers, biting kisses down Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock runs his hands over every part of John he can reach, finally settling on his butt cheeks, pressing him down so the lovely, lovely friction will stay just where he wants it, needs it. He’s so hard he can see stars, and he hasn’t felt like this in ages, like his skin is too small to contain him.
that he has human weaknesses like hunger and thirst and a body that needs to sleep. And he hates it even more when people know he has human weaknesses, and mention it to him.
Two days.
John’s grateful for whatever instinct made Sherlock keep in contact with Billy. He taught them more about the city and the society here than anybody else. He knows the city like the back of his hand, and most of its dirty tricks and secrets.
Now, though. Now Sherlock has solved three cold cases from the files Scotland Yard gives him occasionally to peruse at leisure. He’s developed a formula for a new experiment involving the longevity of blood stains.
“It won’t be,” Sherlock says, just as his phone buzzes. He takes it out of his trouser pocket. YouTube comment, a stupid question about how much baking powder is too much. How do some people survive day in, day out without tripping over their own shoelaces?
Sherlock feels a possessive urge to wipe that smug grin from John’s face. He grabs John and tackles him to the bed. “If you like whipped cream, I’m more than willing to provide some,” he all but growls and pins John’s hands to the bed on either side of his head. John’s laughter fades into a gasp as Sherlock grinds their hips together demandingly.
“I also took some myself,” Sherlock adds, attention already back to his microscope.
“Right, of course, but this is a real chance! A real, actual chance to get what you always wanted.”
"Waiting for you to pick the workstation with the optimal climate, obviously, so I can pick the one with the second-best climate," John says, calmly unfazed by Sherlock's rudeness.
“It never occurred to me that I was risking my life,” Sherlock finally continues. “You know how indestructible it feels to be young. And we were so careful. Only bought from dealers we trusted. Never mixed substances. Always monitored dosages. We were both chemists, after all, what could go wrong? But one day it happened anyway.” Sherlock looks out at the lake again, at the waning moon and the lights it throws on the still water. “I don’t know who called the ambulance. It wasn’t Victor, he was too out of it to notice. When I woke up in the hospital, my chest hurt. They shocked me to restart my heart. It was then that I realised that I was killing myself, and that I was going to die in a dingy, run down drug den if I continued like that. Victor… he didn’t see it that way. Said I’d made a mistake, it wouldn’t happen again. We’d spot each other.” Sherlock swallows. John wordlessly squeezes his hand. “I walked away. I left him there. In that squalid hole in the wall we called a flat. It was more difficult than heroin withdrawal, to stay away from him, afterwards. When I was clean. But I did it. And I made myself a promise, then. I wouldn’t get involved again, wouldn’t let myself get involved again. Caring isn’t an advantage. Caring made Victor a drug addict, and caring made me stay one for long enough that I nearly killed myself. Caring ties you down and clouds your judgement and makes it more difficult to walk away.”
“All right.” Sherlock steps back and lets John go into the bedroom to collect the rest of his clothing. When he comes out he’s fully dressed, and Sherlock thinks of soldiers putting on battle fatigues, because John looks like a different person, dressed and in control again.
Sherlock has no answer to that, so he just nods once, stiff and stoic, and then he raises his violin to his shoulder and starts to play again, aware of John’s eyes on him, boring into him like John wants to x-ray his skull to make sense of him.
There are twenty ways he could make these scones more interesting. Cranberries, lemon zest, cinnamon, chocolate, poppy seeds, the permutations are endless.
“I don’t think you fully understand the state John was in when you were gone.”
On the other hand, it’s raining, and it’s not like they’ve never shared a bed before. John didn’t kick Sherlock out of his hotel room, and all he had to do was walk across the hall, not trek across the city in the rain. “Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock finally says. “You’d get soaked through and you’d probably blame the resulting pneumonia on me.”
Silence descends again, and they just look at each other. John’s eyes are very dark and very blue and very calm. Sherlock swallows. He feels a curious warmth travel through his body. His breathing has quickened a little. John’s eyes are heavy and he’s smiling a little. The very air between them seems charged, dense. John licks the salt off his lips.
Silence falls, and Sherlock feels this odd sense of deja vu again, like this unprecedented situation is deeply familiar, like someone sleeping in his bed isn’t reckless and unheard of but natural and logical and safe. Maybe he should have asked John to leave. Maybe it would have been better. But it’s too late now; John’s small snore tells Sherlock that he’s fallen asleep.
The pub’s lighting makes the most of John’s colouring, his blond hair is catching the low lighting in a flattering way, and he looks younger, less care-worn away from the theatre. So far, they’ve kept to surface chatter, which Sherlock usually hates, but he’s glad of it tonight, because he doesn’t want to hear about John’s relationship and his wedding and anything else that reminds him that John is unavailable.
They share a long look, then they both start laughing.
“Of course, I’m sorry. How could I forget.”
Sherlock finishes the piece, and the sudden silence of the room is still reverberating with the last notes.
His mood is further soured by the multitude of YouTube comment threads clamouring for more content with John and another, smaller number of comment threads calling him any number of homophobic slurs plus people being outraged on his behalf, and an increasing number of comment threads arguing over whether he and John are shagging or not. Moriarty has so far been astonishingly quiet, but Sherlock thinks he’s just timing his attack to be closer to the final to get maximum attention.
Molly clears her throat audibly, and John starts a little. He’d forgotten about the three other people in the room.
They run and run and run, and the cobbled streets under their feet are slippery from the recent summer shower. It’s dark and the night is warm.
The Fey’a boy is sitting on a stone, watching them. “Are you all right, then?” he asks, sounding a bit bored. “I was supposed to stay with you to see if you need any help, but if you’re fine, I have things to do.”
John looks him up and down critically. “It doesn’t look much different from what you normally wear.”
He steps out into the cool night air, letting the brisk November night slap him awake after the drowsy warmth of the hospital.
“What?” John says and takes them out of Sherlock’s hands. “Oh my god…”
“Poison. He was found dead when Sergeant Donovan went into his cell to question him. Apparently he had a vial of poison sewn into the hem of his shirt. Clever of him, somewhat surprisingly, since otherwise he was so very dull,” Sherlock muses, his tone academically dry.
John curses himself for the biggest idiot on the planet. He’s done this so often during the last few days that he’s lost count. He wonders how he could have misread the situation so badly as to honestly think there’s anything left to rekindle there. Obviously, Sherlock is no longer interested. Obviously, he’s moved on and now everything is awkward and stilted because Sherlock is aware that John is still in love with him. They’ve barely exchanged ten words that weren’t related to the production since that dinner, and John isn’t sure he blames Sherlock.
The bathrooms are in the basement, at the end of a long, dark, dingy corridor, and all in all, Sherlock shouldn’t be surprised when he hears footsteps behind him, when someone calls his name.
He’s sorely tempted to tell her that he will come down for Christmas shortly before hell freezes over, but he knows when the day comes, he’ll make the trip because he’d feel guilty if he didn’t, and his parents may be benevolently neglectful, but they didn’t deserve anything of what he put them through over the years.
Around them, nature grows wilder as they approach the forest. They walk mostly in silence, only occasionally stopping to drink water from a brook or to rest in the shade of a tree for a few minutes.
“Of course he’s coming, Sherlock, you know people never say no to me,” she says. “We’ve always gotten along splendidly, so I didn’t even have to try that hard. Whatever you’ve done to that boy, Sherlock, you had better try your damndest to make up for it.”
Sherlock makes a helpless gesture with his shoulders, and can’t think of anything to say.
“All excellent questions, which I intend to find answers to.”
“No.” John shakes his head and doesn’t meet Sherlock’s searching eyes. “It’s just… ugly.”
“It’s freezing in here,” John says, nudging Sherlock with his arm in greeting.
“Please give me a chance,” Sherlock ays, and he knows he’s pleading, but he can’t help himself.
Someone removed them and stacked them neatly on the end table. John guesses it’s the same someone who turned off the light and covered him with an ancient  but extremely comfortable blanket.
Irene is, predictably, the last to arrive, and she grins at Sherlock across the room. He nods politely back and she winks at him, then goes to take the last of the twelve workstations and starts setting up.
Emma promises to do so and leaves. John drops his box of equipment and all but runs over to Sherlock. They’re the last of the contestants, but the crew has only just started taking the tent apart, so they’re far from alone, and John keeps his voice carefully down when he says, “Sherlock, that’s absolutely fantastic!”
“I’ll get her,” Mary says, almost eagerly, and darts out of the room.
Slowly, they get up and brush the dirt from their clothes. John still feels a little shaky, but steadier now.
First stop, as always, is the baker who sells them day-old sweet buns for a few coppers just before closing.
John doesn’t hear Sherlock’s answer, but he watches them from the window as Irene puts her hand on Sherlock’s arm and Sherlock leans closer to catch what she’s saying. He rests his forehead on the cool glass and lets out a deep breath. He’s made it through Day 1 of ten days rehearsal and 30 days of performances without killing anybody and without completely embarrassing himself. He’s been professional, calm and polite. And it’s hell.
Lestrade nods thoughtfully, and Sherlock spares a moment to be grateful Lestrade is directing, because he knows Sherlock hates politely tiptoeing and always comes right to the point. “We won’t throw away five weeks of work because you don’t like the direction we’ve taken the character in, but we can certainly adjust and come up with a version we’re both comfortable with.”
There’s a pause, then he can almost hear Sherlock releasing the breath he’s been holding. “Obviously, the people who killed Violet asked her to do something she didn’t want to do. Possibly steal something from the museum. She ran, they found her and killed her.”
"Well, just get some Pompous Git Shop gift certificates for my brother, and some sticks for my parents' arses, and my family is set."
The judges return and the four of them line up to hear their verdict. Sherlock tells himself that he isn’t nervous. It only works a little bit.
John startles awake, disoriented for a moment, unsure where he is or what time it is.
John grins and invades his personal space. “I have one or two ideas.”
He also got an envelope in the post that further soured his mood.
“This is ridiculous, the judges are clearly letting Sherlock win because they think people like him more because he’s shagging Watson. They’re just doing it for the attention, can’t you see this? And you’re playing right into their hands. This is a baking show, and you leave in all their ridiculous flirting, and cut away from people actually bloody baking.”
“Well, this time you won’t. But don’t worry, there’s a first time for everything.”
“Magnussen deserved to die,” Sherlock points out.
John sighs and finishes dressing. Sherlock is right. They don’t have time.

“They’re both very good.” Molly takes a sip of water and tastes both cakes a second time.
Then, after too many hours of bad champagne and tedious small-talk, they finally go into dinner. It’s hot in the tent. The food is fine but a bit on the boring side, but at least they’re seated with the Bake Off crowd, so the conversation isn’t quite as inane as it could be.
“At what price?” John demands, matching Sherlock's tone. “We get to go home, and bugger anyone who dies as a consequence?”
John looks after her. “What was that all about?”
They sneak in from the back, through one of the tied-down ‘windows’.
Listra’s eyes light up with interest, and she all but shoves John aside and leans over Sherlock’s workspace.
“What is there to say?” Sherlock walks past John and starts packing up his car.
“We appear to be stuck,” Sherlock points out.
John smirks humorlessly. “Good to know that an overdose turns you into a terrible liar, normally you’re so good at it.”
“Piss off,” Lestrade answers affectionately. He turns his head to turn a scrutinising gaze at John. “You all right?”
“Oh, it happens,” Billy says. “I’ve known plenty of men who live with other men, and women who live with women, and nobody thinks anything of it.”
“Don’t be absurd, of course I can walk,” Sherlock mutters and actually manages to get to his feet. He sways alarmingly for a few seconds, but he manages to keep upright.
John nods again, and Sherlock can almost see him retreat more deeply into his mind as he physically moves away from Sherlock. Sherlock knows he should stop talking now, but somehow he can’t. “You volunteered for the Army, meaning you thrive on danger and high-pressure environments, so no wonder you’re understimulated at a surgery that caters to the small, day-to-day illnesses of people who, 90% of the time, don’t even need a doctor. You should be working at a busy inner-city A+E, you should do triage and save lives. So why don’t you?”
His mind replays the scene from the kitchen endlessly, Mrs Hudson’s words, explaining, gently, “It’s always the same story. The Fey'a (that's what they call themselves, you know, fairies is quite impolite) one day discovered that there are places where the walls between the worlds are thin, and they discovered how to travel through the mists into our world. And sometimes, people from our world stumble over one of the ancient doorways they built. So there’s been a steady influx of humans from England into this part of Dera - that’s what the Fey'a call this world - for the last few millennia. Many came in times of crisis, like the Saxon conquest, the Norman conquest, religious persecution. The last group that came were fleeing a disease that had killed many people. One of their number had been to Dera as a child and led the others here, with the help of some of the Fey'a. The problem was that feeding and clothing 300 people who showed up out of nowhere was a logistical burden on everybody, so the Magistrate at the time agreed with the Midnight Queen - that’s the Fey'a ruler -  to close the Gate. So I wonder why you are here.”
What he doesn’t know, what he only learns when he meets John Watson, is that love doesn’t distort  perception so much as it sharpens it. Love is what happens when you look and look and finally
They ditch the car, their clothes and everything else they possess in the outskirts of Prague, where another one of Mycroft’s “associates” meets them with a new set of everything.
“Can we get started? I thought I heard somewhere that there’s a certain amount of time constraint.”
The director, who introduces himself as Glen, gets up on a little box and claps his hands excitedly. “All right, ladies and gents. Let’s do this.”
One of the crew - Emma, according to her name tag - greets him cheerfully and hands him a hotel room key. “If you want to, you can go freshen up. There’s still a lot of time until you need to be on set.”
“What you did before doesn’t concern me, I’m here now and I’m not cleaning the blood stains off the carpet if you try to get up and break your nose when you face-plant on the floor,” John says, taking the lapels of Sherlock’s coat and hauling him bodily up until they’re practically nose to nose. Well, nose to chin, seeing as John is significantly shorter than Sherlock, which makes Sherlock snort with amusement.
“Well, it smells absolutely delicious,” Mrs Turner enthuses. “But you do have a lot of work to do, so we’ll leave you alone.”
“Tea?” John asks from the kitchen.
Sherlock doesn’t rise to the bait, he just shrugs. “We’ll see.”
John smiles. “Let’s find it then.”
Sherlock frowns, confused. “Who?”
“They just vanished. Packed their things and disappeared into the fog. Nobody knows where they went. There was no blood, no bodies, no passages bought to America. Three hundred people, gone without a trace.” Sherlock sounds gleeful as he continues to tell John about the village. Apparently friends and family from other villages knew nothing of any of the inhabitants planning to leave, and yet evidently the entire village just packed up and left, taking chickens, clothes and even in some cases furniture with them. Efforts to call in the authorities were delayed by the village constable having been one of the vanished.
John doesn’t know what to say, so he stays silent and hopes Sherlock will continue talking.
Rewind.
It seems a lot longer.
that matters.” Sherlock shakes his head and instantly regrets it. “John?”
Sherlock nods. “Of course, what’s going on?”
The boy hands him a water skin and a piece of nut bread. “Eat and drink before you faint.”
“Let’s make sure,” Sherlock says, and there’s something in his tone that dares John to argue.
John tells the guardsman their story, how they’re billeted at Musgrave Manor and came upon the stone circle, then got lost and were guided towards the city by two fairy creatures.
Sherlock?
He takes one and lights up, then hands the entire outfit back to her.
He gets up abruptly and mutters something about bathrooms before he all but flees in the direction of the loo.
Sherlock nods absently. He’s noticed that himself. His YouTube channel is growing exponentially, he’s doubled his subscriptions and his hits have quadrupled. He’s also noticed that John’s blog’s following has vastly expanded and that John is posting more baking content as well. He also noticed that many of the comments on John’s blog range from subtly to overtly sexual, and he doesn’t want to think about why that makes him uncomfortable.
There’s the click of the hammer hitting an empty chamber.
John raises a sceptical eyebrow. “You are aware that it’s after midnight, right?”
Sherlock shrugs. “Clean.” There’s really little else to say.
Mr. Musgrave’s collection turns the mansion and the extensive grounds that belong to it from impressive house to magical wonderland. Or rather, if John is honest, it’s really Sherlock who does it. He drags John along into a world of mystery and discovery. They spend hours every day exploring the extensive woods that belong to Mr. Musgrave’s property, often returning home in the nick of time for dinner. Then after dinner, Sherlock and John spend hours with Mr. Musgrave’s collection, translating Latin inscriptions, figuring out whether a bone they found belongs to man or beast, is ancient or modern. More often than not, they’re chicken bones or rodent skulls, but it’s still an adventure. The area had been host to a Celtic village, replaced by a Roman fort, then a Norman castle, so there’s much to explore. Mr. Musgrave has a whole lot of books, too, especially on the practices and remnants of the Celtic druids, and on rainy days, John amuses himself by reading both fact and fiction about ancient times. Sherlock spurns fiction, claiming it’s a waste of time, but John adores stories and always has.
John snorts and turns to look at Sherlock again. “You already know exactly what our wedding cake will be like, don’t you?”
He meets John in front of the car, and they stand there for a moment. Then Sherlock reaches for John’s hand and winds their fingers together, safe and sure, and he hopes that John gets the message.
John shrugs. “I don’t know. But we’ll manage. Together,” he says, and smiles at Sherlock encouragingly, hoping Sherlock can’t tell it’s mostly fake. Honestly, he feels like rolling into bed and crying, but he knows one of them has to be strong right now, and that it has to be him.
John looks over and beckons him with a nod of his head, and Sherlock goes over to join the group with surprisingly little reluctance.
“Sherlock, of course.”
The room smells of vanilla, cinnamon, honey and nuts. Many bakers are doing baklava-style pastries. Some, like Janine and Mary, are making savoury pies. Irene made a spanakopita that looks stunningly perfect. Moriarty is doing his deconstructed thing again, he’s made small filo pastry rolls and is currently soaking them in syrup.
“All right?” he asks, and Sherlock nods absently, attention wholly focused on their surroundings. The stumps form a perfect circle around the ring of mirrors around them. Beyond, the forest is sun-drenched and quiet.
But all that happens is that he asks himself whether London was always this dull, this damp, this empty, if food was always this bland, if life was always this meaningless before, and he simply never noticed because he was used to it.
John smiles. “If this was a bigger theatre, you’d be in so much trouble right now.”
“Can we go yet?” Sherlock groans into John’s ear as hour six begins with speeches from assorted friends and relatives of the bride and groom.
at Victor.
@hyperfixatedbaker
John snorts. “I was going to point out that smoking messes with the taste buds.”
John sighs and rubs a hand over his face, looking down at his water glass as if it held any answers. The truth is, he’s never liked the house very much. It’s far away - which he realises now was sort of the point of it, Mary wanted to wean him from 221B by making it thoroughly inconvenient to reach - it’s too big for two people, too expensive, too much for a single dad to clean and keep up.
“Will you hold still!”
Sherlock has looked up from his book and is watching John with a carefully neutral expression. “Why do you think you have to tell me this?” Sherlock asks, tone also carefully neutral, like he’s academically interested and no more.
“Care to tell me what in the name of the Great Mother happened to you two?” Magistrate Lestrade asks from the chair next to the one the doctor pointed to.
“Is it a hallucination if you know it’s not real?” John asks, and the amused warmth in his voice soothes over Sherlock’s raw nerves like a balm.
John is… Sherlock can’t let himself think about what John is.

Mrs Hudson’s already looking at the Wall, a giant cork board featuring the head shots of every actor who’s ever done a production at Baker Street Theatre and is worth re-hiring. “It was difficult to cast in the first place,” she muses, looking at the thirty something male section of the Wall.
Life proceeds as usual. They investigate a complicated fraud case, unravel a human trafficking ring and put two of Moriarty’s old henchmen in jail. They’re so busy that John quits his job at the clinic, but he occasionally picks up night shifts at the A&E at Bart’s. Sherlock spends most of these nights in the Bart’s lab and they take the tube back together in the early morning, when it’s still dark and cool and empty, when London seems to belong just to the two of them.
Sherlock draws back and looks at John critically, at the many data points that make up John Watson. “First, you’re obviously bored, you even admitted it on your blog. Second, you’ve been back from Afghanistan for about a year now, and your limp only improved when you were on Bake Off, so something about Bake Off made you better. I’m guessing you respond well to adrenaline and pressure, and given that you were limping badly when Bake Off started, your daily life provides little of both. Locum work?”
He wonders if it’s still there. The power of John Watson’s attention. He wonders if he even wants to know.
With that, he turns and walks away, not caring about the rain.
Sherlock isn’t being noble. Far from it. Sherlock is being purely, 100% self-servingly selfish by keeping the Watsons at Baker Street. He loves them being here, and if it were up to him, they would never leave.
The realisation twists something bitter and complicated in Sherlock’s stomach, and he looks away, trying to banish the thought from his mind.
“It should be possible to reconstruct the recipe, you can probably do it from memory if you try a few times.”
“Fuck,” John whispers as their eyes lock, and Sherlock can practically see John’s pupils dilate. “You should come with a warning label. ‘Kinky fucker’, or something.”
Afghanistan? - SH
“Radio.”
Something about the question brings up a memory of his talk with Harriet earlier in the week, and Sherlock swallows. “John?”
He takes out twenty pounds, throws them at the table and leaves without another word.
It’s six in the morning when the housekeeper shakes him awake where he fell asleep in the kitchen chair. He’s frozen stiff and has a crick in his neck.
“Fuck,” John whispers. His leg hurts. The one with the imaginary limp. It twinges in time with the beeps of Sherlock’s heart monitor. “I’m getting too old for this,” he mutters, even though he knows Sherlock can’t hear him. He’s also not entirely sure he wants Sherlock to hear him, because he’s not sure he’ll want to hear whatever Sherlock has to say. He knows he’s one of maybe three people on the planet who appreciate Sherlock’s bluntness, but he’s not sure he’s up to it right now.
The point is, he doesn’t know. And for the first time in his life, he isn’t sure that he wants to.
“Sounds good.” John yawns and drains his tea cup. “All right, I’d better get going.”
“Okay,” John says, and there’s something in his voice, a steely determination that Sherlock finds extremely aggravating and deeply reassuring at the same time. “You need coffee. And breakfast. Come on.”
He looks at Sherlock, and there’s an expression in his eyes that makes Sherlock’s breath catch. “You used my gran’s recipe.”
“Boring,” Sherlock says and John laughs outright, looking up to meet Sherlock’s questioning gaze.
He turns and walks a few paces, but John stays where he is.
Mycroft only looks at John mildly, and John snaps his mouth shut and glares out of the window, angry at himself that he let Mycroft goad him into defending Sherlock, angry at Mycroft for lying and lying and lying for two fucking years, angry at Sherlock for leaving him alone for so long. He blinks against the tears threatening again, and rubs his stinging eyes while Mycroft pretends not to see.
It’s difficult to see in the fog, and John consults his map and his compass several times, but Sherlock seems to need no such help. He strides confidently along, as he seems to know where they’re going with certainty, but John has learned only last week that this can actually be deceiving, because they got horribly lost and it took them two hours to find their way back to Musgrave Hall.
“Because you’re high as a kite. Because I said so,” John says, slowly, and there’s something in his voice that sounds like a warning.
“And what are you doing down here again?”
He’s just about to unglue his lips from John’s for long enough to suggest it when John’s phone rings.
Sherlock rolls his eyes reflexively, hoping it hides the tremor that goes through him at the tone of John’s voice, low and serious. He isn’t nervous, why should he be? They survived; surely whatever follows now can’t be worse than what they just went through, but somehow getting almost blown up and shot isn’t nearly as frightening as knowing this night might have ruined whatever it is that’s between them. It didn’t feel like it at the pool; if anything he felt more in tune with John, closer to him than ever before, but that was then and this is now.
“The air is getting thin. All my cake has to be is the worst of a good lot. And that’s not difficult at all.”
For a moment, John is back on the pavement at Barts’, looking up to the roof, watching Sherlock do something unforgivable out of fear and desperation.
Mycroft darts a glance at John, and John, well-bred as he is, immediately starts getting up. “If you two have something private to discuss….”
John nudges his ankle to get his attention. “Most uncomfortable place we’ve ever been trapped in?” he asks, an obvious attempt to change the subject, but Sherlock lets it go.
“Your gran’s recipe?”
“Wow, Sherlock, you’re making me teary-eyed. Didn’t think you had it in you.”
He has no idea what to say. John apparently doesn’t, either, and he’s not the type to talk just for the sake of it. It’s one of the things Sherlock appreciates most about him. He despises the meaningless chatter people fill the air with to prevent socially awkward situations.
Irene grins. “Anywhere. We could do anything. Be anything. Think of it, Sherlock. No more boring rules. We go where we want, do what we want. Who could stop the two of us, together?”
It’s ten minutes to two when the door to the rehearsal room opens, and Sherlock walks in with Lestrade, who met him in Mrs Hudson’s office to go over the contract details.
After dinner, Sherlock disappears and John helps Mrs Hudson with the dishes.
It was harsh, but true.
John’s oven clock dings and John goes to get out his cakes, one pale yellow, one just the right shade of blushing pink.
“Close your eyes.”
at the microscope, but his attention is still very much on John.
John nods, satisfied with himself so far. He’s calm. Professional, helpful. Everything a good DSM should be. He goes through details of rehearsal times and wardrobe fittings with a minimum of fuss. This is easy. He knows how to do this. He’s worked with loads of actors he couldn’t stand, or thought were idiots, or had a little crush on.
“John!” Janine calls from behind them.
On his way home, Sherlock gets a text from John.
Normally, when theatre becomes too messy, when there’s too many people and too much noise and chaos and emotion, all the things he normally thrives on, when it’s too much, he can just retreat into music, and science, and they’ve never failed to calm him down.
Sherlock blinks, and John presses on. “What was the mistake, Sherlock? Because from what I saw, your bake was bloody perfect. So could it be, Mr Consulting Baker Genius, that my bake was just better than yours, and that the sex we had last night was unrelated to the fact that I kicked your arse in competition today? Could it be that we’re not just a group of amateurs, that some of us actually know what we’re bloody doing? I’ve been baking since I was five years old, Sherlock, so get off your bloody high horse and acknowledge that you’re not the only person who can bake here.”
John smiles a little, then cocks his head and looks at him searchingly, apparently trying to figure out if Sherlock is telling the truth. He takes a deep breath and says, slowly, obviously picking his words very carefully, “The last few days, I sometimes had the feeling that you were… enjoying yourself, for lack of a better word.”
Sherlock hates himself a bit for the heat that rises on his face, and he hopes he can blame it on the temperature, which has reached the boiling point.
John listens intently. Then he hears it. It’s like… singing, but not. It’s more sensation than sound, making the hair on his entire body stand up.
He can feel Moriarty watching him, and once, Moriarty passes them on the way to the loo and says, voice dripping with fake sweetness, “That looks delicious, Sherlock.”
For all of the above reasons, Sherlock knows that if he reaches his limit, Mycroft is the only person who can truly help him. For all of the above reasons, Sherlock knows that if he ever does cross that line, Mycroft will be there to stop him.
Mrs Hudson tells him, and some of the elation leaves Sherlock, because it isn’t nearly so challenging when it’s a part he’s done before. He and Mycroft agreed he’d only take parts that challenge him artistically or would look good on his resume, and this will do neither. Baker Street Theatre is too small to get him any prestige, and he made it a personal rule not to do anything twice. It’s difficult enough not to get bored during rehearsals as it is. On the other hand, it’s early May and he starts rehearsals for his project at the National in early August, and he’s got nothing on in-between, partly because he was supposed to be in the US until the end of June, but the project he was supposed to be doing fell through.
Resolutely, he steps outside and closes the door with a very loud, very final sounding click.
Fifteen minutes pass, and John’s tea goes cold, before Mary returns. She sets the empty bottle down next to the sink and retakes her chair opposite John.
Sherlock takes a deep drag of the cigarette he bummed from Janine and listens with half an ear as she complains to Irene about her ganache.
Then he immediately takes out his phone and sends a text to John’s new mobile number.
“Obviously.”
They stop at a crossroad. The road leads slightly downwards, and they’re standing on a bit of a precipice. The silence is absolute. Occasionally, a car drives by, but then it’s quiet again. They stand there and look out into the night for a few quiet minutes. Then John reaches out without looking at Sherlock and winds their fingers together. Sherlock’s heart does a curious little flip, and his breath catches in his throat, just for a tiny moment.
He sits down on his side of the bed. “Yes, he’s going to be fine. He just caught the bug you had last week, remember? He’s going to feel bad for a few days, and then he’ll get better, just like you did.”
John’s last.
“You kissed me,” John says, and immediately wishes he hadn’t, because it’s like suddenly a space opens between them even though neither of them has moved, and he can almost see Sherlock’s defences go up.
“Sherlock!” Warm hands on his shoulder, shaking him gently.
Mr Chatterjee pats his shoulder in a grandfatherly sort of way. “Well, I hope you do.”
in his bed. Someone distinctly Sherlock-shaped. John presses his eyes shut and pretends he’s still asleep. He doesn’t have the energy for this. It’s still dark outside, and John needs every minute of sleep he can get.
“You need to really slather them with melted butter before they bake,” John says, turning back to Sherlock, biting down on a huge yawn.
Sherlock barely sits in his chair nowadays.
Irene grimaces. “Ouch.”

John can’t help but stare. So this petite, quite ordinary-looking Fey’a woman is the famed Midnight Queen, the Fey’a ruler.
“On national television.”
“Hate to break it to you, but you actually sleep a relatively normal amount,” John points out, leisurely flipping the page of his paper.
Unsurprisingly, it’s John.
John shifts, settling in. "Are you staying? At least until I fall asleep?" he mutters, sleepy and warm against Sherlock.
“Yes.”
John looks from the book to Sherlock and his lips twitch with suppressed amusement. “You ‘fixed’ the baking instructions, didn’t you?”
For a long time, they just stare at each other, in a sort of disbelieving limbo, like this is too good to be real and too painful to be good.
He looks at his watch. 45 minutes to go. He gets into costume and fixes his hair, which looks like somebody kneaded his hands through it while kissing Sherlock as if his life depended on it, and Sherlock smiles.
“Thank you,” Sherlock answers, and congratulates himself for not snapping at Mr Chatterjee to get to the point. He despises small talk, and his landlord is entirely aware of it. “What can I do for you? Do you need me to let in the plumber again?”
It feels like goodbye.

Just. Be there. Be real. Be alive
Sherlock wakes up disoriented for a moment, which is unusual for him. Normally when he is awake, he is awake, and when he is asleep he is asleep, no hovering at the edges for him.
“Your wife would still be alive,” Sherlock says, astonished that his voice works.
Then he remembers. He’s on the sofa in 221B, and it’s somewhere between sunset and dawn, probably closer to dawn.
“Do we have a choice? We’re lost, and it sounded like they’ll take us to the edge of the forest. Once we’re out of the forest, we can ask directions from the nearest farm,” John answers, and they follow the two retreating figures, hurrying to catch up.
This chapter contains a frank discussion about past drug use.
Sherlock nods absently, and John wanders up the creaky stairs to 221B to fall into bed.
“They need me,” John insists, but he isn’t really looking at Sherlock, he’s looking at the phone, and Sherlock knows exactly what John is thinking, what John is always thinking.
“Um… Sherlock?”
Sherlock has been gone from Baker Street for 79 days when he finally gets a text on his brand new burner phone.
“You’re going back to London. Tonight,” Sherlock says as he presses the gauze against the wound and fixes it there with two plasters.
John’s hesitation is obvious as he shifts from one foot to another and clenches his left hand reflexively.
They meet the museum's one and only employee, an elderly Fey'a man, on the top floor. Sherlock and John introduce themselves as friends of Kitty's.
“The bank vault in France,” he says without hesitation.
There’s a stripe of flour on the side of his face, and Sherlock can’t take his eyes off it. He’s been thinking of reaching over and wiping it off with his thumb for about ten minutes now.
He starts playing again, and John falls asleep thinking of home, and where the hell that even is.
“I stranded us here.”
Finally, Sherlock stops a few paces away from where John is sitting. “Look,” he says, pointing at the earth. “Something was dug up here.”
Sherlock comes home to Baker Street after 688 days, and John is gone.
John shows him the compass, and Sherlock's eyes go wide.
“But still, you won. That must have felt nice.”
“At the beginning,” Sherlock says, and John glares at him. Sherlock rolls his eyes and adds, in a softer tone, “I suspect you ran away from your posting because the farmer you were stationed with made unwanted advances toward you, correct?”
Sherlock does forget about it, mostly, once the drugs are completely out of his system and the fuzzy warmth fades with them. He almost misses it, the feeling he knows so well, the soft, mellow glow of a morphine-derivative high. But then he looks at the bags under John’s eyes and puts another nicotine patch on his arm to slap the softness from the edges of his mind, and deletes the incident save for the moment his lips were on John’s, and John’s breath hitched. Some things are too precious to delete.
Sherlock frowns at her in surprise. She smiles gently at him and continues, “And I wonder why you didn’t, when you so clearly wanted to.”
John is the only thing he has to hold on to.
“What
“What kind of mistake?” John asks, trying to make it clear from his tone that he is genuinely asking.
Surprised, Sherlock looks up at John, who’s perched on one elbow, looking at the screen. “But it’s at least six months. In Sydney.”
“Good,” John says, and the vehemence in his voice surprises Sherlock. “So if you want me to “count” you kissing me, then you’d better be stone cold sober and you’d by God better know what you’re starting.”
The air raid disrupted his sleep, and they’ve had an exhausting day slogging through the mud yesterday’s rain turned the grounds into, and he’s sitting by the fire, only half listening to Sherlock questioning Mr. Musgrave about the village, which has turned into Sherlock’s newest obsession.
“True, but I have no desire to make topfenstrudel for 100 people,” John answers, then sets down his container of noodles and straddles Sherlock’s lap on his chair. He smiles down at him, and Sherlock smiles back, feeling that thing tugging at his chest again, that thing he refuses to name, that makes warmth spread through his entire body down to his toes.
John smiles. “The tea’s nothing to write home about either.”
John just hopes that if they fail to get back home, their sneaking off won’t mean they can’t return here, because Mrs Hudson seems a genuinely good sort.
Sirens. Footsteps, running, shouting. Darkness.
Five inches. Five fucking inches.
Sherlock exhales audibly. He's so tired. He just wants to go home. All he wanted for two years was to go home. He wants two mugs of tea in the sink and pointless arguing about milk. He wants tennis matches in the middle of the night and reading in silence for hours. He wants chases through dark London streets and bad telly with the garlic Naan from that place with the good Mango Lassi.
“They’re little, pink - well, I guess, Petits Fours, and they’re layered. Sponge on the bottom, then a mixture of sponge, orange juice or rum, and jam, and then another layer of sponge, and then they’re glazed with a pink sugar icing.”
. I have serious work to do. Some of us aren’t just in this for the fun of it, you know, some of us actually
Tonight, all he can think about is how he always sees his mistakes in perfect clarity - after he made them.
“I didn’t know we’d end up here,” Sherlock says, and the annoyance in his voice makes John’s hackles rise.
John looks tired and sad. “I know we said that this was just a bit of fun. But we get on like a house on fire. I’ve been having the best time with you, and not just the sex. Just waking up with you, or arguing with you over YouTube, or baking next to you while neither of us talks for three hours. Being woken up at two in the morning from you playing the violin. All of it, it’s been so much fun, and I haven’t felt alive like this in such a long time. And I don’t want it to end. No matter if I’m going home tomorrow, I want to see you on Monday, and as many Mondays as you’ll let me have.”
John winds his hands into Sherlock’s hair and pulls him back so he can look Sherlock in the eyes. He’s searching Sherlock’s face like he’s looking at something, but when Sherlock’s fingers trail over his cock through his jeans, his eyes darken and he says, “Fuck it. Can’t get any worse,” and kisses Sherlock until Sherlock forgets to ask what he meant by that.
Since they started so early, it’s still well before noon when they reach the edge of the forest.
“Oh, high praise from the master,” John teases, but Sherlock can hear the warmth of his smile in his voice.
The stage door opens and John sticks his head out. He nods at Molly, and they wordlessly vanish in the direction of the stage to prepare the scene change from city to forest.
“Take ten, we’ll do food porn shots and then we’ll film the judging,” the director yells over the mutterings in the room.
about, like John
“What were you thinking?” Donovan asks.
They get into silly little snippy arguments that neither of them really wants to have. John complains about the food and Sherlock tells him to shut up. Sherlock hates their bed and John tells him to suck it up and go to fucking sleep already.
It’s the constant vigilance, he thinks. The constant danger, the ever present tension. They’re also constantly together. Even when they’re not in the same room, John watches over him. Mostly from afar, from convenient rooftops or empty flats. Sherlock often can’t wear a wire, so John mans the directional microphone and catches the criminals on tape as they spill their plans to Sherlock. It’s oddly reassuring, knowing that John is watching over him. He likes having John’s undivided attention, and he’s had a lot of it. John’s eyes are always on him, even when it’s in the form of an infrared camera.
Sherlock sighs. Trust John to cut through the bullshit and ask the one question Sherlock can’t actually answer. He takes a sip of his revolting tea and thinks of how to put this in words. The truth is that he had no idea what was going to happen, and that the not knowing was so very thrilling, so very much the opposite of being bored, that he let himself get carried away with the rush. But he can’t say that to John. So he tries to find other words that are equally true. “I wanted to see who he was, draw him out of the shadows, and then find a way to beat him.”
As soon as Glen yells cut, John walks out without looking at anyone, and Sherlock can feel the entire tent glancing at him with badly suppressed curiosity.
“What am I supposed to say?” Sherlock asks, because he honestly has no idea.
“How is it your fault?”
John, relieved, squeezes Sherlock’s fingers reassuringly. “Yep. Definitely don’t let go of me, okay?”
He has to be spectacular this week. It’s the last show before the final, and every week he’s on television drives up his YouTube followers.
Sherlock shrugs again and takes a sip of his coffee to avoid looking at her.
Shut up, or I’ll spam you with emojis all day, and I know you won’t be able to resist finding out what each of them means
Silence. The only sounds in the kitchen are the oven and the tinny sound of someone speaking on the other end of a phone line. John has turned his back to Sherlock and is looking for his jumper.
Sherlock shrugs. “No idea.” He pauses for a moment, and then says, uncomfortably, “Apparently you were right.”
John closes his eyes and lets the sound of Sherlock’s questioning lull him into a doze.
“So,” John says, smiling at him, standing facing him in front of the stainless steel fridge, the dim light from above the sink picking out the gold strands in his hair. “Good night, then.”
“You know me, I’m never boring.”
He makes a noise that could be construed as agreement. It
A hand on his arm pulls him back down even before he can get to his feet.
It has the desired effect, because his mother and his aunt Ruth both excuse themselves with matching mischievous grins to go watch the show.
“Well, this looks like a lot of work, we’ll leave you to it.”
Sherlock wakes John reluctantly about ten minutes before they reach their destination.
John gives him a tiny smile, obviously amused. “Mycroft is teasing high-ranking members of the clergy, is he?”
His phone dings with a missed text. Mummy. Again. Asking when he’s coming down to Sussex for Christmas.
A word about Viennese food, especially Viennese baking. It’s heavily influenced by Jewish, Hungarian and Bohemian food traditions, because Vienna used to be the capital city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and a giant melting pot for all the cultures of the Empire. So there’s a lot of powidl and poppy seeds and potato dough.
