“Yup.” Balthazar snarled.
“Dean…”
Hanging up, he wasn’t sure how to react. ‘What job?’
Misha threaded his fingers through Jensen’s hair, pulling him back down to his lips, nipping and kissing along his rigid jaw line down to the sensitive flesh of his neck, causing Jensen to thrust his pelvis against his. A slow rhythmic grind against one another had Jensen fumbling for Misha’s belt as Misha pulled feverishly at his Jensen’s t-shirt, yanking it over his head, his hands and eyes instinctively moving over the curves of his biceps. Jensen gave Misha’s pants one hard tug, his thick cock springing free from the top of his boxer shorts. Wasting no time Jensen dragged his tongue hungerly up and down his impressive length before taking him into his mouth. Misha let out an audible gasp, as Jensen began sucking gently on the tip, licking the slit clean of a little pre-cum before taking him deeper, from root to tip.
“Somewhere else. Like it’s me, but it’s not!” Misha replies.
Castiel noticed the once inhabited chair that held a bloody Dean Winchester was now empty, red droplets adorned the concrete floor leading towards the bunker’s sleeping quarters. Castiel followed them, leading him directly to Dean's room. Standing outside the closed door, Castiel took a breath, placing his palm against the door...he could feel Dean's pain. Finally, he gave the door a sturdy knock.
Jensen cleared his throat, and gave him an awkward nod,
“I love you too didn’t fit..”
Dean kicked off his shoes and jeans, and climbed under the covers, his body and mind had never felt so painfully exhausted from one day. Cas tossed his wet towel on to the floor, picking up a pair of pajama bottoms that laid over his desk chair and pulled them on before climbing into bed, snuggling against Dean.
“But don’t you want it to be the best damn show? Because I do!” Misha shouted.
“They have a connection right? A connection so strong it broke God’s will...MAYBE THEY JUST NEED TO FEEL IT!!”
“Practice is everyday after school. Don’t be late. Hell of a hit, lucky to have you.” Dean added, giving him a smile and a nod before the bell sounded.
“I know who you are, and I need you to leave. Right now.”  Misha demanded.
“We should…”Dean said pointing at the field equipment.
G.M. wrapped his arm around him and began to sway as Misha joined in with the lyrics he could remember...surprised that he knew a lot more than he thought. G.M.froze as Misha continued, stopping only when he saw the look in G.M’s eyes.
Within the hour, the storm hung over the city, crashes of lightning and thunder filled his dark room. Everyone was asleep, and it was time to go. Jump starting his car, he pulled out in a hurry, never looking back, and headed towards Cas’s house. The sheets of rain were making visibility more and more difficult. Dean had to drive slower than he hoped, as his windshield wipers were losing the battle. He finally arrived, pulling his hood over his head, he ran out of the car, bypassing the door and climbing straight up the tree that he had before, and pounded on Cas's window. No answer. How could this be happening? Where the hell was he? Dean tried one more time, and was stunned when Castiel’s sleepy face appeared in the window. He pushed his window open, the rain poured in along with him.
“Oh. I see what this is. Did the crew hire you?”
“Sure. No problem. I should get going anyways. “Jensen whispered as he walked towards the door. “Can we talk later?”
“I don’t want to get up either.”
“I got him something so good, but not as good as what I got you. I think I should get an extra gift for picking out such an epic gift for you. ” Dean boasted,  giving Cas a playful punch before heading towards the kitchen, with Cas in tow. Cas stopped in the doorway when he heard Dean’s voice talking to someone about a dessert he saw or heard on Rachel...on the Rachel something Show? Dean continued to rave about how delicious it looked, the whip cream, cookies, custard, and how it looked like a big giant pie. That’s when Cas had an angelic epiphany. He snuck away, back to his laptop, searching “Rachel’s whip cream cookies, custard, dessert” There it was. Grabbing a pen from the mug on the table, he hastily scratched down the ingredients & directions:
“You’re a stripper, right? For my birthday? Gotta say, they did good. Real good actually. Definitely my type. And on any other day I would make you work hard for every single dollar bill, but I have a big day meeting my new boss and I really need to get ready and make a good first impression. So if you’ll excuse me.” Jensen instructed, handing the man a $100 bill from his wallet as he moved towards the couch to set his stuff down.
“Awww.” she cooed. “Well you know what they say, distance does make the heart grow fonder.”
“Me too.” Dean replied with a small grin, before Cas pulled him back into his arms. “Never, ever, letting you go.” he whispered.“Can I stay here tonight, Jimmy?”
“Except Lisa of course, right?” his father questioned.
“I don’t know, you tell me Cas. This is your hometown. Was hoping you might want to give me the nickel tour. Then after that, I thought maybe I could  introduce you to my father.”
Cas tapped the bat once again in the dirt, before pulling up to take his stance for a second time.
“We? We?” The bald one growled. “YOU were the one that wanted to pet the deer, I told you to leave it alone!”
"Lisa can wait. I'm gonna go get Coach..."
"Who the fuck is Dean?” Jensen barked.
“No. Not exactly. My roommate recently got married, and three is definitely a crowd with newlyweds. But I got this job, I found a place, but it won’t be ready for a couple of weeks.
“Jensen?” Misha interrupted
“Misha…”
Balthazar fainted in dramatic fashion, collapsing in the big, awaiting arms of Uriel. Uriel smiled, lifting his angelic partner for the last 35 years up to cradle him like a baby Then taking a final moment to look upon the two very much alive souls in the men before him, his wings expanded.
Laying back on the couch together, enjoying the closeness and endless post coital kisses, Jensen took out his phone, and took a selfie of them, Misha’s head resting just under Jensen’s chin.
Castiel shook his head, continuing his downward stare at the floor, “Dean you don’t have to say that, and certainly do not need to eat it. I will go out later and get you something else, anything else. I will throw it away.” That’s when Castiel noticed Dean had already removed it from the fridge, and had taken a bite, a big heaping bite.
“But Bobby, I don’t know where he is, I don’t have my car keys…”
“Jens...What happened?.” Misha asked, intertwining his finger with his.
“THERE HE IS! THE OTHER BIRTHDAY BOY!” a man shouted from the top of an old wooden bar behind where Misha was standing. Turning, he saw Jensen, with a bottle of whisky in one hand, pointing at him with the other, dancing and singing to a Lynard Skinnard song blaring from the speakers of an old fashioned jukebox. He signaled for Misha to join him. Misha moved slowly to the bar, plopping down on a stool below him.
“Be right there!" Sam yelled back. 'Dean let's go. Let him finish, don’t ruin it.”
It was at that moment, at 11:59 p.m., that both men’s heart monitors flat-lined instantaneously.
Cas had to prepare himself for the morning. He would need to tell two of the most important people in his life his secret; before someone else did.
“Show yourself.” he growled.
“There he is!” the network executive yelled.
“Hello my little Mishushu.” he heard his mother’s voice say.
Later that night Sam awoke, and headed towards the kitchen for a glass of water; finding Dean standing in front of the fridge with the door wide open. Sam shuffled in, grabbing a glass from the cupboard.
“Let me guess. Broadway is calling?” G.M. commented sarcastically.
“How adorable. It talks. Jensen, when you’re done with the help, you really should get your ass down to the make-up room, they have a whole thing waiting for you.” Rachel sighed, giving the still unclothed man in the room a swift smack on the ass. “I’ll take over here.”
“They have less than a year left. We need more than hot.” Uriel stated.
“Look at you. You clean up nice. Wow. I never realized how much you remind me of my brother. Not the dead Vietnam one, the one that died in the car crash. He was a good looking fellow too.” he rambled.
“Don’t be stupid boy. You’re sick, and as long as you live under this roof, it’s my job as your father...”
Misha laughed again, taking the kit from him, pulling a band aid and a tube of burn cream from it.
“Come in!'' Jensen yelled. It was Rachel Miner, Jensen's leading lady who plays Dr. Megan Sullivan; and also one of his very best friends.
“I can’t Dean.” was all he was able to get out as he swiped the back of his hand over his cheeks.
“What did you say?” his dad barked.
“Well, oldest brother Michael died in Vietnam and I don’t remember him at all, but my middle brother James, who we called Cas, was killed in a car crash during a huge storm. Weird thing is I have this memory of him saying goodbye to me before he left, he was leaving with this other guy...a friend of his...what the hell was his name...Dean! Played baseball together. He died in the accident too.”
“The hell you are!” Bobby barked, stopping them in their tracks.
“Jensen? Don’t you?”
“Hi Mom.”
“I’ll put on some coffee.” his mother added, giving her son a sweet kiss on his head as she passed by.
“Hey. Calm down. What is going on? Why are you here?”
A few more hours passed, and Misha was officially drunk. Between the vision, the coincidental confusing names that G.M. spoke of and the soft smiles and whispers Jensen and Matt had been sharing slouched on the couch together across the room before making their way to the terrace, he was grateful for its pain dulling effects. It was time to go. Making his way slowly to the elevator, stopping only for a moment to grab a couple more left over swag bags for his mother, he was shocked to see Jensen waiting alone at the elevator. Jensen looked him up and down, his eyes stopping on the extra bags of goodies.
A few weeks passed and it was finally game day: State Championships. The small town had decorated the surrounding areas with signs, balloons, ribbons, and plenty of pictures of their town hero,Dean Winchester. A parade was being held in the team’s honor in an hour, and Dean was as usual, running late. The sound of pebbles hitting his window caught his attention as he pulled on his shirt. He opened his window and saw those magnificent blue eyes looking back at him as he let out a boisterous laugh.
Jensen opened his dressing room, closing the door quickly and quietly, only to find a strange man he had never seen before standing there in only bright orange underwear. He was handsome, blue eyes that pierced through the disheveled black mane of hair, and from the look of those snug boxer briefs, he had a lot to offer.
“1802 W. Hargrove St. It's just a block north of here.”
“What about college, D? What about baseball ....”
Misha gathered his stuff and put on his jacket;
“Welcome to the team.” a voice said.
“Huh. That was a funny episode.” Dean sounded as he closed the door.
“The Fitzgerald Farm. Celebrating the big win. Biggest bonfire I have ever seen. Wish you could have seen it. Everyone was there.”
“Misha! NO!” Jensen cried out as G.M. walked in the door. “Misha! Please! I love you too...”
“What are you talking about? II sent you plenty.” Misha replied.
As the party died down, couples began to wander off on the large estate with one another. Cas was alone, cold, and terribly drunk. He needed to go home. Wrapping himself in a horse blanket he had found hanging over a stall in the barn, he made his way to the main house to use the phone.
"So what if he is? HUH? Does it really fucking matter? He’s the one who got us here asshole! And so help me God if ANY OF YOU lays another hand on him, you will have me to deal with. Understood?!"
“What turns you on?” he asked, his eyebrow raised in a stern demeanor as he stared down Matt.
“Cassie? Is it really you?”
“Wait, was that not what you wanted me to say?” Jensen inquired
“Hey!'' Dean yelled.
“You saved my life Cas. Again. I know I said to not save me, but I am glad you did.”
“Hi.” The blue eyed man said as he continued shuffling the arm load of items. “I know it’s late. And I didn’t call, but I didn’t have your cell number, but I did have your address from the birthday muffins, so I took a chance and brought you pizza, beer, and work that still needs finished...not that I am asking YOU to finish it or anything.” he rambled, clearing of his throat loudly.
Jensen Ackles groans at the sounds that have interrupted his and Misha’s sleep. Jensen looks at his phone which reads, “Mom”. He answers, just as she begins to sing Happy Birthday to him in Spanish, just like she has every other birthday.
The sound of the first ring sounded on his phone as another phone’s ring sounded outside his door. Ring. Then another.. It continued as Jensen moved to his door, looking out his peep hole to find Misha clumsily juggling pizza, beer, and a pile of papers, as he attempted to reach his phone in his back pocket. Jensen opened the door, his phone still to his ear.
“Misha, I can’t do this. I think you were right, it is like we started in the middle somehow, and I’m just …I just can’t do this again, ok?. Not again.”
Bleary eyed and exhausted from all of the rewrites, Misha made his way out to the car, fiddling with his keys, when he noticed a balloon and what appeared to be a card attached to the windshield wiper. As he opened the card, a $100 bill fluttered to the ground. As he reached down to pick it up, he started to read the card.
“Pipe down. It’s harder without cleats. It’s gotta be…”
“We got him back.” the doctor said with relief before rattling off another long list of of tests to run, and an order for medications. He finally turned to the anxious guests in the room. “We got his heart restarted. He is still breathing on his own, but we may need to put him on a ventilator if his oxygen levels get any lower. I promise, my team and I will continue doing everything we can for them, I’ve just never seen rapid deterioration like this in such healthy patients.”
Dean shook his head in disgust as he laid down on the ground, pulling Cas down with him to rest. It was perfect. The moon, the stars, the sounds of the lake. Gentle neck and forehead kisses grew deeper as the night went on, hands moved less timidly, urgent to discover more and more about one another as the need to be closer became almost unbearable. Cas rolled on top of Dean without pulling their lips away from the other’s,his hands roving through Dean’s thick mane of hair, then traveling downward, rutting against him as his fingers found their way to the top of Dean’s jeans, popping the button open.
33 had not been kind to Jensen. Over the span of his acting career, he had become accustomed to seeing his face on every daytime magazine as the rebellious but brilliant Dr. Ryder Morgan, but recently his face was splashed across the covers of magazines and in the news because of his personal life. A very nasty, public break-up, after a very private relationship with former cast member of After the Storm, Dylan Winter's, confirmed the rumors of Jensen's bisexuality. Jensen had never purposely hid the fact that he was bisexual, and decided to face the press head on about the subject. To his surprise, he found himself welcomed with open arms into a new community, the truth making him even more endearing to his biggest fans.
“Damnit!” he hissed, answering his phone again.
“I need coffee.” Jensen grunted.
Balthazar ran from the room to find Uriel, who was standing out on the terrace admiring the night lights of the Vegas Strip.
“Hey! You came over here for a reason, and I am not sure what that was, but I’m sure as hell not letting you leave until you hear me out!” Jensen demanded.
“Did you try going over there?” Bobby asked.
“We ended it. Last night, It's over. He’s going to go back to his girlfriend.” Cas dropped his face into his hands. The words he just spoke burned his lips as they passed over them; it was a lie, and it was killing him to do so. He never expected them both to be so accepting, but he also didn’t want them involved with this any more of this situation than they needed to be.
“I love you Dean.” Cas blurted. But Dean didn’t respond. He just sat there, quietly moving the cheese whiz nozzle over a single Pringle between two fingers.
“Jensen? What is it?”
“Mine too” Jensen said, showing him the couple extra he had hidden behind his back.
“I’m guessing that’s them.” his father denoted as he stood up slowly from his chair.
Dean shook his head, “Didn’t really have to say anything, she knew.”
“Stop it. You always look gorgeous. I couldn’t believe I had no pictures of us while I was gone.”
Cas? Oh God. He probably doesn’t even remember what happened either! But oh, the delicious warmth of his chest, so inviting, feeling himself plumping once again as Jensen cupped one of his ass cheeks, pulling him closer against him.
“Come on man. Pick up.” he whispered tapping his foot as pools of tears streamed down his face.
“What time is it?”
“Please sit down,” his dad instructed.
“Is that meat?” Dean questioned. “And peas? And whip cream?”
“You should go.” Jensen said abruptly.
“Yes?” he answers, his eyes on Jensen. “Ok. Ok. Give me a minute and then put it through. Thanks.”
“I can give you a ride.”
He felt a gentle nod and gave Dean a wink as Cas carried him out of the room to the sounds of his deep, baritone voice singing, “You are My Sunshine” softly into the little boy's ear.
“No. Like I said. You don’t have to worry about me. Not my first...time with this…”
Bobby Singer finally arrived, Dean ran to meet him in his car. Just the sight of him relieved a small bit of the pressure that had built within his chest since he got the news.
“You are making a HUGE mistake Mr. Collins. I will call G.M. myself and see what he has to say about you.” Dylan snarled as he made his way to the door.
Minutes before reaching Bobby’s house, the Impala careened off of the road down an embankment...landing upside down.
Misha had a look of confusion on his face as Rachel poured a small amount of water from the pitcher into a cup, and brought it to his lips to sip.Taking a few gulps with a nod of appreciation to her, he finally turned back to G.M.
“Shhh…. hey, what happened?” he asked softly.
“Love you Rachel.” Misha added
“Do what?” Cas asked.
“But Bobby, I don’t know where he is, I don’t have my car keys…”
Finally hanging up with his mother, he barely got a second to himself before his phone rang again.
Castiel’s voice growled from his lungs in short bursts, “No. No. Nothing...nothing about...any of this...OK? OK? Dean, you were, you were….”
Misha seemed to tense, his eyes widened.
“WE NEED A MEDIC!” G.M. yelled, hovering over both men, now lying listless on the stage.
But Cas was the one who was not fine, something was coming up, and it wasn’t the whisky the….
Bobby nodded and got back into his car.
It happened so quickly. The roads were so slick.
Cas and Dean found themselves standing in front of two men in long, ethereal white coats. One looking furious, the other seeming to be having some sort of panic attack, whispering the words, “We have utterly fucked up!” over and over again.
Swinging open the door wearing only his jeans, Jensen was shocked to not find the man he wanted, but the man who didn’t want him; the man who had left him broken-hearted.
“Hi Ms. Miner. A real pleasure to meet you. Everyone usually just calls me Misha, the help is so informal.”
“Think the audience would be upset if I kill her character off?” Misha asked with a smile finally putting on the oversized pants and suit that was brought in for him, then slipping on his shoes.
“Who was that?” Jensen asked, handing him a glass of champagne.
“Son? Answer me. Why would she say that, if it wasn’t true?”
“Jensen?”
His father, a man who had always been of very few words, leaned down and squeezed his shoulder. “His loss.” he mumbled to him, then welcomed the Winchester’s into his home.
“CAS! STOP! I DON’T WANT YOUR HELP! I DON’T DESERVE YOUR HELP! I DON’T DESERVE ANYONE’S HELP! IT DOESN’T MATTER! YOU HEARD CHUCK!! IT’S OVER! IT’S ALL OVER CAS!” he pleaded, his eyes strained with tears as he curled his knees closer.
Jensen gave him one final nod and smile, as he made his way out. Misha ran his hands through his hair, desperate to focus on anything other than the way Jensen’s tongue pushes against his front teeth in the cutest way when he smiles. Taking one big deep breath in, he finally picked up the phone to take the call.
“Me too.” he stuttered just as a thought skipped through his brain: blue eyes again, lips. His hand.
“Dylan’s back. Kind of hoping Jensen kicks his….wait, what are you doing here?!” Uriel shouted.
“Woh. I don’t need any more details.” Dean intervened.
Misha nodded, his cheeks flushed with excitement. Jensen sat the bottle they shared down next to where they were standing and hopped off off of the bar to the sound of boos from the gathered crowd. He reached up this time to help Misha down, said their goodbyes and thanked them all for the birthday wishes as they made their way out the door, Misha’s hand still gripped tight in Jensens. They were both terribly drunk as they climbed into the back of a large black muscle car outside.
"Cas?"
Misha walked up behind him, placing a kiss then a bite on his neck. “So, where’s that coffee you promised?”
Misha laughed out loud in the deserted staff lot.
“Did you have that looked at?” he asked, pointing at his arm.
“Let’s go swimming.” Dean decided.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
“Dean!”
Crossing through the rest of the cemetery hand in hand, they stopped along the way to lay flowers and pay their respects at the Winchester and Novak family’s graves, until they finally came upon them, the ones they both needed to finally needed to pay their respects to...the ones they needed to say goodbye to most of all: their own. Dean leaned down and brushed the dirt from the engraved lettering of his name with his fingertip as Cas made his way over to his nearby, each taking a moment of silence.
“So what do you think?” Misha asked as he pulled them on.
“Jensen…”
“Wanna get out of here?” Jensen hissed in his ear.
Rachel’s face was a mixture of shock but not total surprise as her half naked co-star approached her.
Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive – the risk to be alive and express what we really are.”  –  Don Miguel Ruiz
After quick showers, aspirin, and a pot of coffee, Jensen rummaged through Misha’s dresser looking for some clothes to borrow.
“Is the car open?” Bobby asked. Dean nodded. “Well, time I show you how to hotwire a car.”
“I know that face.” Uriel retorted. “By the way, do you know if guardian angels are allowed to hate their fragmented souls? Asking for a friend, of course.”
“Mom.” Sam interjected
“What do you want? Why am I awake?” he asked.
No answer.
As Misha began to walk them through the script with a few members of the writing team by his side, Balthazar and Uriel entered the room. Uriel took his stance behind Misha’s chair, while Balthazar leaned against the wall directly behind Jensen.
“Nope. I was just headed out. Here. Enjoy your morning.” Misha said handing over the breakfast items to a very confused Matt.
“Get in my office, right now!” was all Misha could vocalize, grabbing a handful of Jensen’s ass as he walked by him.
“D, I’m not mad. I’m the one who should be sorry, I just got carried away, and that is no excuse for making you feel that way.”
“Dean! Stop, ok? The fact that you seem...ok with this is really great...but honestly I don’t want to talk about it anymore! The only asses we should be thinking about kicking is Bakersvilles.” Cas quipped, tossing the ball from his glove up in the air for Dean to catch.
Cas hiked his sports back up a little higher on his shoulder, and gave Dean the biggest smile.
No answer.
“Dean?”
“Hello Clarence" The face of his demon counterpart, Meg Masters, said with a grin.
“Yes, after I left you at your room I got very drunk, but Dylan had been texting me all night about wanting me back...and all I could think about was how much I wanted you back. Matt was the one who escorted me back to my room. He was just looking after me, nothing else. I tried to find you, but...”
“I’m scared Cas.”
“Who’s that for?” he quipped with a childlike grin.
“Maybe. Might be asleep by then. 34 is feeling old.” he quipped, giving him an adorable gummy smile before finally making his way to his meeting.
“Who was it?”
Cas soothed him with a hush, rubbing his back. “I am just going to go away for a little while.”
“I was wondering if I could get an autograph. I’m a huge fan.” Cas joked holding up one of the posters the town had made with Dean’s face plastered on it.
“I lose my medical license, break up with my girlfriend, and run for office?! Are you fucking kidding me with this bullshit?” Jensen howled.
“Kidding. No plans on killing her or you off either...yet.” Misha said jokingly.
“Don’t you ever wear pants at work?” Jensen snarked. “And I did knock, twice.”
Sam nodded to his brother, giving Castiel a comforting pat on the shoulder as he headed back towards his room.
“Woh. Woh . Hey you ok?” Jensen asked, steading him with his hands on his shoulders.
“So Gabriel Michaels, is that your real name? Or your stage name? Reason I ask is I have been thinking about changing mine now that I am transitioning from theatre to television or maybe even film someday. So many people have asked me if I am a Cohen Brother.” he joked with a laugh.
Jensen jumped looking to see another set of icy blue eyes looking at him. It was Matt.
“Maybe I can find another deer.” Balthazar responded, making both of them smile.
“Jensen? What is it?
“What the hell are you talking about!” Jensen growled.
Looking down at Misha, sleepy eyed and staring up at him, Jensen smiled.
“God? I know what you must think of me, but I am still your child, your servant, and I need your help right now. Please. I need you to help me find Cas. I need you to help me because I can’t be without him; he’s my soulmate. I love him and I promise you that I will love and protect him the rest of my life, and follow in your word. I know you say it is a sin, but how can it be when he is your greatest creation?” Dean stood up from his knees as the sounds of the storm began to rumble in.
“Misha...hey...stay with me.” Jensen quietly pleaded, squeezing Misha’s hand a bit tighter as a single tear streamed down his face.

Bottom of the 9th, 2 outs, 2 men on, the game was tied 3 to 3. Dean Winchester walked out of the dug out and took a few practice swings to the sound of his name being chanted over and over again. He tapped at his cleats with the bat, loosening the impacted dirt he had collected from the muddy pitcher's mound. Dean turned towards the crowd, his eyes went to Lisa along with the tip of his bat, sending the crowd into an even bigger frenzy. Lisa blew him a kiss, but he missed it. Dean’s attention had already turned back towards the dugout, where he saw Cas standing behind the fencing, his fingers intertwined in it’s chains, chanting his name along with the rest of them. Cas’s triple had brought home the tieing runs, and now it was up to him. To his surprise, Dean pointed his bat for a second time; and this time it was at him. Some noticed, others didn’t, but the tears that welled up in Cas’ eyes were hard to miss. Strike one. The cheers of encouragement continued, The team was on their feet pounding on the fence. Strike two. Dean stepped out of the batters box, regripped his bat and took another practice swing. He looked over to the dugout again, just in time to see Cas place his fingertips in his mouth and whistle the loudest whistle he had ever heard. He smiled, adjusted his helmet, and stepped back in the box. “Breathe.” he whispered to himself. Bobby Singer once said that the sound a bat makes when it makes perfect contact with a ball sounds like music; and this hit was a symphony. Up and over the right field fence, a textbook hit, sent three members of the Woodcreek team across home plate. The game was over: Bakersville 3, Woodcreek 6. The Hawkeyes were State Champions for the first time in school history.
As Dean left the field he noticed Cas carrying all the equipment towards the equipment shed. It was Cas’s turn that day, but his pain stricken face told Dean that the injuries he sustained by the hands of his own team were a lot worse than he was letting on. Dean dropped his bag and ran over to him, lifting one of the large canvas sacks of equipment off his shoulder.
“Dad, your job is to love me and accept me for who I am…”
“And what if we don’t find each other?” Castiel asked Balthazar.
Dean pulled Cas into his chest and held him close as he gently wept.
“Fuck!” was the only word Misha could find as his fingers found their way back into that thick dirty blonde hair. He wasn’t going to last very long and Jensen knew it as he felt the raven haired man’s body begin to shutter, his fingers gripping the corners of the couch cushion, desperate to hold out longer, and not to thrust his hips upwards. Jensen hummed around him; It was all it took to unravel him. Misha’s hips shot upwards as he came, letting out an orgasmic fueled shout from deep within him...
“Misha just pulled in the driveway.”
Dean threw Cas’s bag to the ground and both scurried down the tree together to the car to escape the torrential rains.
“Misha, hey.” Matt growled with a large yawn, wearing only a pair of boxer shorts.
“Sam’s fine. Better then fine, he’s happy. So is Jack.” Dean assured him.
“Dean...”
“Coach? D what…”
“Not likely in these parts.” he promised, pulling Cas even closer.“You cold?”
Castiel continued to ignore him, walking faster, not looking back.
“What?!” Dean yelled out to him, noticing his serious stare.
Cas began to curse at himself. What the hell was he doing? He talked himself in and out of it a million times as he stripped off his clothes.
“So what are you saying? That my character is vapid? She is a heart surgeon for christ sakes!” Rachel screeched.
“I don’t get it.” Balthazar exclaimed. “They are actually beginning to recognize one another, which should be impossible, but did you hear that whole ‘Novak’ thing? And yet they still are no closer than ever before! I give up. Do you hear me God? I. GIVE. UP!” he screamed to the sky, his hands flailing above his head.
“I need to go out for a bit, get some air.”
It was perfect. All things Dean loved. Minus the fruit of course, but still! Most pies have fruit in it! This says trifle though. No! This is what he said he wanted! Castiel had hoped all along he would find something personal, something that would let Dean know how much he cared. Their relationship had changed in the last few months since Michael died. Mentally. Physically. A sweetness. A softness. A fondness. A touch. A smile. A stolen whisky induced moment in a shadow just outside Dean’s door, that even he was not sure he even remembered. Cas could feel a flush fall over him, before he headed up the stairs to the store.
“Jensen?”
Castiel fell silent once more. His head tilted, his face contorted as he struggled to find the right words the right reaction. He looked to Dean for relief, desperate to figure out what he wanted to hear.
“Dean. Stop. I’m going with you.” Cas stated as he walked towards his closet, pulling a large already packed suitcase from it. “I’m ready.”
“Yes.” Cas replied calmly. “The current storyline is old, boring and has been done before a million times over. Your character realizes he can't just make a difference in the operating room, but make an even bigger difference in this country's failing medical system.”
The rumbles of Dean’s Impala were heard, alerting Cas, and sending the rest of the team rushing to him as he hopped out alone, in the gravel driveway. The team began to harrang him about being there alone, some of the comments were sympathetic, others more lude about who needs one chick when you can have them all. But Cas could see through the facade, Dean’s red swollen eyes and his movie star smile that he used to protect himself from the truth gave him away. The group welcomed him with his very own bottle of whisky, and led him back down to the fire so he could do a little howling himself.
“Don’t give me that bullshit. What works, works. I have won awards playing this role!”
“It seems we are too late. There is nothing he can do.” Uriel read.
"We'll figure it out together. Just like everything else."
Dean Winchester is reborn Jensen Ackles (An alternative universe version that is single, with no disrespect to the actor's family, and is similar in appearance and name only)
30 plus floors to go.
“Then move in with me.” Jensen blurted.
Popping open another bottle of champagne with a cigar dangling from his lips, G.M. sat back on the couch next to his favorite new head writer, and members of the cast and crew. He refilled their glasses as he told stories of his days as a  big soap opera star, and other stories of not so star-like moments,  like playing a mute waiter on a telenovela after lying on his resume that he was fluent in Spanish. . Misha smiled, laughing politely at his bosses tales, while his focus kept drifting to the green eyed man who sat across from him, all in black, his shirt unbutton just so, embarrassed by the teenage-like thirst he was feeling for him. Jensen, sitting next to Matt across from him couldn’t help but notice the way Misha had been nibbling nervously on his pillow bottom lip, wearing that crisp blue long sleeve shirt that was secretly Jensen’s favorite on him because of the way it brought out those perfect cobalt blue eyes,
“Dean? Dean!” Castiel turned him to lie on his back on the bed once more, placing his hands over him, his eyes brightening as his hands moved quickly over the eldest Winchester.
Dylan’s eyes followed Jensen as he made his way into the kitchen and watched as he slammed his bare foot down on the pedal of his stainless steel trash can, and dropped the single rose into it.
"Say cheese!" Dean’s mother squealed as she snapped what felt like the millionth picture of him today. Brushing the tassel out of his face, Dean pulled at his shirt collar under his graduation gown.
“Jensen. I’m begging you, please don’t read too much into this. When there is something to tell or for us to discuss, we will. I promise. But for right now, I don’t want to talk about it. I just want to enjoy this day, our birthday with you. Will you do that? For me? ”
To minimize the confusion:
Dean sat up and wrapped his arms around Cas, hugging him with every bit of strength he had in him. “Me too.”
Misha, frustrated with the timing, took Jensen’s hand and they walked into the theatre together, taking their seats with the rest of the cast and crew.
Misha nodded. “I do believe you.”
“You love me??” Cas asked, sitting back down slowly.
“What’s the score?'' he asked, as shucked off his jacket, and placed the pizza on the kitchen counter. “I got some money on the Yankees.”
They both sighed in relief.
(See the end of the chapter for
Misha did not protest as the Yankees' best hitter walked up to the plate, and he was due. The fans of New York began to chant his name over and over again. Something came over both of them, the sound of the crowd, the crack of the bat, and by the time the winning hit crossed home plate, Jensen and Misha were making their way around the bases too.
“Of course I do! Jesus Cas, don’t you know by now that you are so much more to me than anything else in my life. Bigger than baseball, or blackmail, or scholarships, or what people will think of me?” Cas sat up on his knees and placed his hands on either side of Dean’s face, his eyes puddled with tears.
The two men lowered their heads. “Again, we are so sorry.”
“It’s all very thoughtful Dean, I just…”
“We'll talk tomorrow. Go do what whatever it is you need to do, Mish. Good night.” Jensen said softly with a grin, before turning back towards the elevator.
Thank you for reading thus far!
Misha explained that Jensen had been gone a couple weeks on a press tour, appearing on all the local morning and late night shows, some national, which was great for the show as they prepared for the Emmy's.
Jensen Ackles, the 7-time Daytime Emmy recipient for Best Actor on the ever popular daytime soap opera After the Storm groans at the sounds that have interrupted his slumber.
“Are we done here? ”Jensen said, standing up to move away from him, his voice still stiff with restrained rage. “Because your time is almost up!”
“I know. Sam told me.”
With only an hour before the wedding, the now Tony nominated and Emmy award winning actor and his future husband, the Tony nominated and Emmy award winning writer grabbed their matching sports bags, in their matching suits, and headed out to the old ball field Jensen’s dad had built for him behind the barn.
“You Are My Sunshine...do you know that one? It relaxes me” G.M said before beginning to sing it aloud. “Sing it with me Collins.”
“Coach? D what…”
“No you don’t!” Dean exclaimed. “And you’re not fine! Now let me help!”
Cas Novak is reborn as Misha Collins (An alternative universe version that is single, with no disrespect to the actor's family, and is similar in appearance and name only)
It was a stellar night. The show swept all the awards including: Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for the Writing Team, Outstanding Performance By A Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Jensen, and Outstanding Performance By A Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Rachel, and the coveted award for Outstanding Drama Series. As the cast and crew took the stage, the tears and all the hard work that this ensemble put forward seemed all so worth it. G.M. spoke on behalf of the network, followed by Misha who was visibly shaking as he approached the microphone. Looking back at Jensen for a moment for reassurance, and getting the nod, he turned back to the audience.
As they pulled away, Balthazar & Uriel were left sitting on the curb outside the bar.
“Does that include me on Line 2?” a deep sexy voice asked. There sat Jensen at Linda’s desk, the phone still held up to his ear.
“You flirting with me?” Dean asked coyly.
“And what? Dean interrupted, “Still be miserable? Still be alone? Pretending to be something I wasn’t? Living a lie every single day for the rest of my life? You listen to me now James Novak, I would rather spend an eternity working at a bar with you, than one more day like THIS. One more day where I can’t talk to you without raising suspicion, or worry that someone saw or didn't see. One more day that I can’t hold you in my arms or kiss you whenever I want. And I won't spend one more day feeling scared… all the time.”
“Thank you, Cas.” Dean said with a smile, his hand patting his upper arm. “I am going to go clean up."
Jensen didn’t even have time to acknowledge him as Misha pushed past him to take the stage, giving the crowd a wave and finding his way to his assigned seat at the long rectangular table. Each actor had made their way on, and it was time for him to go. Putting on his million watt smile, Jensen  jogged out on stage as the screams became almost deafening. He acknowledged each of his fellow cast members, and writer,  before taking a seat.
“Fine.” he snarled at his brother giving one more glance back before exiting just as Mary walked in with an arm full of groceries. Giving Sam a quick peck on the cheek, she noticed Castiel unveiling a bowl from under a dish towel, hovering over it protectively. She turned to Sam, seeing an anxious grimace on his face as he observed him also.
“Like a vacation?” the little boy asked.
Dean opened his, reaching his hand out towards him…
He was there again, the nothingness of The Empty filled his senses. A sound behind him brought him quickly to his feet.
“Weird. You want to come in?” Jensen asked, taking the case of beer out of Misha’s hand before moving back from the doorway to let him in.
“THAT’S NOT FAIR AND THAT’S NOT TRUE!” Dylan shouted, standing up to face him.
Dean pushed him, angrily. “Where the hell have you been?”
“Cas. Come on. I’m OK…”
Jensen thanked him, and closed the door, his stomach rumbling as he pursued all the yummy treats; it smelled delicious. Pulling the card from the top, he noticed unfamiliar handwriting on it.
Cas gulped at the now awkward silence, but his curiosity was getting the best of him.
Misha left the elevator in great haste, his heart beating in ears, wiping haphazardly at the tears running down his face with the sleeve of his suit jacket. Reaching his hotel room door, he fumbled for his wallet to retrieve his door key when he felt a hand press down upon his shoulder. He turned around, finding himself face to face with Jensen, his blue eyes still seeing the hurt he caused in those beautiful green ones..
“What’s going on?” he asked, “You ok?”
“Happy Birthday my dear Mishushu. How is it going? Did you meet him yet? Please tell me he is as hot as he looks on T.V.?”
The door knob began to rattle then opened.
I decided to post early and bring the story its ending...finally.
“Have you ever actually seen the show? My character is a doctor! He has always been a doctor! It’s what I am known for on this show. And he finally gets the girl he loves, and you just want to throw it all away to make him what? Some sort of bisexual politician?”
Jensen nodded as Misha circled his arms around him, squeezing him as hard as he could.
“Hell no! Get your ass up here!” Jensen demanded, putting his hand down to help him up. Misha felt like he was dreaming for a moment. Jensen pulled him up with one hard pull, his body now pressed against him and his perfectly swaying hips. He tried to step back but was intercepted by Jensen’s strong arm around his waist. His breath stuttered as his blue eyes found green. Jensen handed him the bottle of whiskey. Misha’s first sip’s were polite at first, but soon turned into large gulps with each passing song. The friction between their two bodies and the heat of the whisky was causing his body to soften and harden all at the same time, pressed against the gorgeous actor he had always admired; he was truly perfect. Misha suddenly felt those lips he had been staring at since they met pressed against his, moving quickly, his tongue slipping past Cas’s lips, letting out a groan when the blue eyed man’s tongue pushed back. The kiss ended with a gasp from both of them.
“Like a vacation?” the little boy asked.
“Thank you. And Happy Birthday to you!” the delivery man added.
“Hi Castiel, whatcha doing?” she greeted, moving to stand next to him. That is when she saw it. She swallowed, quickly placing a look of admiration and joy on her face as she ran her finger down the bowl, across each layer, pausing for just a moment on the warm layer near the top. “Did you make this for dinner?”
Dean ran over to his bag to put his glove and ball away, then jogged towards Cas to catch up with him.
Jensen opened his front door.
“Please sit down,” his dad instructed.
Dean matted down his still very wet hair with his hand, moving into the living room to face his father.
“Right here Mrs.. Ackles.” Misha responded.
Dean returned to his guests, making his family quite happy. As he looked around, he knew this would be the last time he would see most of them. Lisa and her family arrived soon after, and Dean played along just as he had promised Cas, her arm laced through his once felt so natural, now felt more sinful than anything written in the Good Book. Dean would intermittently run back into the house to call Cas again, but still no answer.
“That you got drunk at the hotel bar, got escorted out, and fucked Matt Cohen in your room? Yeah. I already know…”
Jensen swipes at the electronic pad, exchanging it or the basket.
“Cas! Stop! Tell what’s going on. Can’t what?!”
“You chicken?” he teased before starting to make his way down the long, wooden dock.
Jensen lifted his hands up to cup Misha’s now hanging face, wiping away a few more stray tears with the pads of thumbs. Misha reflexively kissed at each one lightly as they neared his lips. Jensen moved in slowly, timidly, his hands pulling Misha’s lips towards his, sharing a breath for a moment, eyes closed.
“You’re kidding right?” Dean snarked. “This isn’t the West Wing, it’s After the Storm!”
“Happy Birthday Mr. Ackles! Looking forward to meeting you today, and working with you on this very special show. I know we are going to make an excellent team. Hope you enjoy these treats! Regards, Misha Collins~Executive Producer/Head Writer~After the Storm. Jensen bit into a blueberry muffin, intrigued by the kind gift and note from his newly hired boss. Maybe this was a sign that this really could be his best year yet.
Cas smiled kissing Dean’s hand once again, “Yes, I have. But Dean, I have always known I was... gay. Never had anyone to tell that too til now..., although I suspect my mom knows. Being an army brat meant I moved around a lot, it was easier to hide, and it gets lonely...”
Blood. Cries of pain. The sounds of sirens.
"Say cheese!" Dean’s mother squealed as she snapped what felt like the millionth picture of him today. Brushing the tassel out of his face, Dean pulled at his shirt collar under his graduation gown.
‘Misha!’ he thought to himself as he hopped out of bed.
But when I see you darling
“Wish I could have too.” his dad replied, taking a small drag.“Everyone huh?”
Dean Winchester is reborn Jensen Ackles (An alternative universe version that is single, with no disrespect to the actor's family, and is similar in appearance and name only)
Standing at the end of the bed wearing tuxedos, was Balthazar and Uriel, looking as exhausted as they did handsome.
“I already did.” Misha responded. “He said he’d never heard of you.”
“Because if you read your emails you would know that he is our new boss.”
To minimize the confusion:
“If you could sign here?”
“Ha...You wish.” he snarked.
“Dean...”
He stood up to button up his pants, finding himself little off balance and now face to face with Jensen but Jensen didn’t move, he just steadied him with his hands.
Chapter includes explicit sexual content.
“I’m fine. You don’t have to worry about me.”
Dean Winchester is reborn Jensen Ackles (An alternative universe version that is single, with no disrespect to the actor's family, and is similar in appearance and name only)
“What are you doing?” Uriel thundered.
Misha finally found his way back to his office. His mind racing about the man he had just met. He was one of the reasons he applied for this job, not only was he the most gorgeous man he had ever seen, but he was also an exceptional actor. But oh how they met, standing there in his underwear, thinking he was a stripper. Why! Of all times! He couldn’t think about that now. He had to focus.
"FINE! Just know this isn’t over! And hey, forget about what they were saying....”
To minimize the confusion:
“A bunch of us are going out tonight, you should join us.” Jensen said.
“Hey, Matt.”
Misha let out a grunt, bringing their attention back to the patients. G.M. ran to his side, taking his hand, as his blue eyes fluttered open.
The story starts again. I truly hope if you have read this story up till now, you will continue. The main characters have chosen reincarnation, with the hopes of finding love with one another again, and living the life they deserve.
Jensen finally emerged from the bathroom groaning with each step he took, one hand holding up the oversized white towel around his waist.
“Dean the reason I...”
“So close.” he whispered to himself over and over.
“He says you will do no such thing.” Balthazar said. “But he does have a counter offer. Being that it's too late to send you back to your previous lives since your funerals have now already taken place, he has agreed to either let you stay in heaven or be reincarnated under certain conditions.”
“And I still love that song, and that ass! “Cas replied, as he pointed one more time before digging in and giving Dean a smile.
“Walt said it was the dream.” Jensen added. “And who the hell is Walt?”
Jensen found himself in a reality he didn’t recognize. A shed, a familiar arm...an injury...a kiss so powerful he lost his ability to speak. He suddenly made an audible gasp.
Castiel nodded, his face left facing the floor. “ Wait, Dean? I just want you to know we will fix this, all of this. I am just so glad you are OK and I just want you to know…”
“Jensen, you never will because I lo…”
“Well, what are you waiting for you two! Let’s go!” G.M. yelled, waiting for them to join him.
An alarm clock buzzes.
“You are, aren’t ya? I mean, that’s what everyone is saying... only one without a girl in the stands, never see you talking up anyone but D at parties…he doesn't swing that way in case you haven't figured that out yet.”
“Stop it Balthazar. We were given an impossible task, but here we are, this close...and I refuse to give up..AND NEITHER CAN YOU!” he yelled at a still unconscious Jensen.
“Impressive.” Cas complimented. “Kind of a turn on actually.”
“What?”
Jensen realized he missed a lot more than he thought while admiring those exquisite thighs of his. He couldn’t let on.
Castiel suddenly found himself in Heaven. Walking up and down the white bright hallways, he searched for any familiar faces, there didn’t seem to be anyone around. Then, that familiar voice again in his head; it was emanating from here in heaven! Castiel followed the sound, growing louder and louder as he found his way to the door of his favorite heaven from years ago. Castiel searched for the autistic man who had drowned in his bathtub, but he was nowhere to be found. Making his way through the lush, grassy knolls of heaven, he found the man without his kite, looking nervously up into a tree; but nothing could have prepared him for who was looking back.
An alarm clock buzzes.
“The hell you are!” Bobby barked, stopping them in their tracks.
Happy Birthday Jensen.”
Misha made his way down the rest of the red carpet, stopping to interview with a few reporters along the way about his nomination. He was delighted by all the buzz around the writing team, but found himself mostly gushing about it’s star actor who truly had broken some barriers both on and off the set. Standing by the buffet, was G.M. himself, looking very dapper, and a little off center with what appeared to be not his first martini of the night in his hand.
“A little.” he answered, lacing his arms around Dean’s neck, “A lot warmer now.”
“5 minutes.” Jensen said curtly.
“God I hate them.” Rachel complained, to Gabriel’s delight.
Jensen rolled over, pulling Misha back down to his chest, shushing his pleas with a few lazy kisses to the top of his head.
Misha’s eyes pooled with tears, his lips were moving but nothing was coming out until his voice finally found the words he so desperately wanted to say.
Castiel’s eyes warmed and brightened, watching him take bite after bite, wiping the bits of whip cream and meat haphazardly from his face with the back of his hand. Castiel began to laugh, instinctively reaching toward him and wiping a bit he had missed with the tip of his finger; but nothing could have prepared him for what happened next. Dean grabbed his hand, bringing it back towards his face, before gently sucking the stray food clean from Castiel’s fingertip. His breath hitched, from the sensation of the sudden heat and cool of Dean’s delicious mouth as it moved on then off his skin. With their eyes still locked on one another, Dean took another bite, a messy one, but this time, he didn’t even attempt to wipe it away, he just moved closer. Still holding Castiel’s hand in his, he lowered his lips towards his, whispering against his cheek, “Do I have anything on my face?” Returning to look deep into those cobalt eyes. Castiel looked at his lips, noticing a small blob of the trifle in the corner of his mouth, and another just below his thick lower lip on his chin. He attempted to pull his hand from his, only to be met with resistance, as Dean shook his head “no” and moved even closer, pressing Castiel’s hips against the counter-top. Castiel pressed back, as he slowly, delicately, dragged his tongue along Dean’s chin before moving upwards towards his mouth, hesitating for just a moment, before pressing the tip against his lips, lapping at the creamy area till it was clean, before delving his tongue deep within Dean’ accepting mouth, lazily swirling his tongue around his, tasting him and the dessert before their lips fell away from one another, leaving each one breathless.
“DEAN!”
Jensen laid back down on the bed, pulling the covers up over both of their heads, turning to face Misha.
“Hello boys.” She said as she looked about the room. “My my. What’s going on here? Is he a birthday gift?”
Matt peeked out from the curtain at the waiting crowd. “Na, live crowd has always been my thing till now. Kinda turns me on.” he said with a wink.
Dean climbed the stairs of his house and went into his room, finding a large suitcase almost fully packed on his bed, his laundry basket full of clean clothes, sitting next to it. Instead of moving them to sit down, he knelt down in front of it, clasped his hands together, and began to pray.
“Shit. Hi.” the man said, looking frazzled.
The lobby lights began to flash letting them know it was time to take their seats.
Dean smiled at him, his eyes sparkling like the water under the moonlight. For the next hour or so, they played as friends and lovers. Laughs. Kisses. Touches. In that man made lake their souls were free to be in love.
She then went on to say there was someone else, but what she said next, well, it just didn’t make a lick of sense son.”
“Don’t worry about it right now. Get some rest.” Cas reached up to kiss him on the cheek before returning to lay his head in the crook of Dean’'s arm.
With a few hours before the beginning of the day one of a two day event, the cast was met by the staff of the MGM along with their very excited network executive, G.M., was nearly hopping up and down as he announced the show was just nominated for several Daytime Emmys including Best Show, Best Writing, and Best Acting Nominations for both Rachel and Jensen. Their morning fatigue turned to celebration. G.M. praised Misha for being the catapult the show needed to get it into the 21st century to the cheers of those in the lobby. Misha sheepishly smiled as he shook G.M’s  hand, who held their hands together up in victory.
“Rachel!”
“Fuck.” he hissed hanging up the receiver. He needed to find him, tell him the timeline had changed. They had to leave tonight!
Blue eyes met green eyes, Misha giving Jensen a nod.
“Yeah, but those can get infected real easily. You need to keep it dry, don’t pop it.” Jensen added.
“Misha, are you leaving? Did you get another job?” Jensen uttered.
“Well, keep it down, you'll wake Gabriel.” she responded.
“Your boy’s a queer! A homosexual!”
Jensen’s breath was bordering on panting when he noticed the writer's deep blue eyes.
The only person they trusted enough to tell was Bobby Singer, who immediately rang up an old high school friend and told him about their situation. Rufus Turner had moved to California from Kansas years ago, and opened a bar, and was willing to take in the boys, give them jobs and a room til they got settled. Between the both of them, they had enough money to get them there...and of course Bobby gave them what he called a loan, that could only be paid back by helping him clean up the baseball stadium for the summer seeding, in addition to phone calls from California at least once a week, letting him know they were ok.
The Hawkeyes had themselves a new 3rd baseman.
“What does it look like? Getting the milk for free one more time.” Dean yelled back, to Cas’s dismay.
Cas stopped immediately. Leaning back back on his heels he saw something in those green eyes he had never seen before in all the time they had spent together: fear.
“Coach? Hey. It’s me. Are you planning on stopping by? You are? Good. No. No. It’s not the reason I called, I need your help...I leave tomorrow.”
“You’ve been drinking too, Dean.”
“What’s all this?” Sam looked around at all the materials laid out in individual bowls “I finally found something Dean wanted for Christmas. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it first. Dessert!” Castiel announced proud as a peacock. “It's this pie or trifle thing that I overheard him talking about that he saw someone named Rachel make on a show or her show. He couldn’t stop talking about it!”
“Cas.” Dean whispered softly, taking his hand.
Misha was speechless and he watched him walk away. Had he just forgiven him? Everything in him told him to chase Jensen down, wrap his arms around and never let him go,  but work was calling him again.
“Sorry mom. Good night. I love you.”
Castiel stood defeated in front of him, his eyes on the floor, his hand stuffed in his trench coat pockets. “Dean. I am sorry. I really did try. I heard you talking about…”
“Yes you have Jensen, and congratulations on all of your accolades, but that's because with your looks and talent...I mean Jesus, you could read the phone book and you would still win a Soap Opera Digest Award.”
“Hey!” Dean interrupted, taking a protective stance in front of Cas.“I don’t know what is going on here or who you are, but somebody better tell us what’s going on? One minute we were being rescued from an accident, and now we are...I don’t even know where the hell we are.
“My ass.” Dean swore. “You’re a 36 year old man who hasn’t played since Freebird was on the radio!”
Dean shed his cap and gown fully, hanging it over a chair in the kitchen and headed out the door.
Misha started to drift off, his eyes closing slowly.
The blood drained from Sam’s face, as the memory of a night at a dingy motel flashed through his mind, a marathon of “Friends.” There was this episode, oh no. Sam swiped his hand across his lips, as he tried to find the words to tell the elated seraph when they were interrupted.
"Love you too."
“I need to use the phone.Too drunk.Gonna call my parents for a ride.”
“Dean, can you really imagine your father agreeing to something like that?” Cas asked.
“Please don’t leave Cassie.”
“Thank you for letting me know. I’ll go check on him.” Misha said as calmly as he could as he gathered and paid for his items.
“How about that lap dance?” Jensen slurred as Misha climbed on top of him, peeling his t-shirt off, and unzipping Jensen’s jeans...
“Call me later! And please don’t spend your birthday alone!” she added before he hung up.
Dean looked at his watch impatiently.
“Come on!” Cast whined.
Misha had dreamt of a producer and head writer his entire life. His initial dreams were of Broadway, but his flair for love stories and poetry led to countless writing awards, and a scholarship to Kansas State University, where he was made Editor and Chief of the renowned newspaper. But after graduation, he found himself in a revolving door of freelance jobs, eventually leading to him to writing a romance novel called, I’ll Just Wait Here Then, which did terribly in book sales, but caught the eye of a producer in California who was looking for a writer for a 30 minute day time soap opera. Ratings went through the roof after he was hired, and it eventually led him to this very moment, when his phone rang.
“Dad, tomorrow? I…”
“I did. I have, but I didn’t love them D, it wasn’t...special...you know? And trust me, we can take it as slow as you want , hell we don’t have to do anything at all if you don’t want to, because THIS, this right here? It’s all I need! Just you. That’s all.”
Misha’s cell phone rings .
Two months turned to one month in a blink of an eye. Jensen and Misha were still going strong; even making appearances together at smaller award ceremonies where they and the show were racking up the awards. Their only “problem” seemed to be the constant carnal need for one another, which had almost got them caught more than once on the set, and in a bathroom stall at the Soap Opera Digest Awards.The show it self was also going strong in the ratings, and G.M. and the rest of the network were thrilled with Misha and his staff. In fact, there were talks of a night time spin-off; but Misha couldn’t even think about that as he sat in his office, staring out the window. Jensen was all he could seem to think about lately. His desk phone rang, waking him from his lovely daydream
Reminder that all actors appearing in this story are an AU version by name and appearance only. No disrespect to them or their families.
No one expected such a turn out. The main panel was sold out, throngs of fans cheering and screaming at the soon to be filled stage with their favorite characters and a certain writer that Jensen had been thinking about all morning after a very vivid dream. He had woken up achingly hard, frustrating him even more when he heard a rumor from a few crew members that Misha had started seeing some stockbroker. Jensen couldn’t think about that right now, but oh, that dream...the cool lake water, their tongues and bodies swimming around one another's, the heat of those same bodies as they laid on the dock together...
“What kind of conditions?” Dean scoffed.
“Yes,” Cas continued. “Just like a vacation, and I promise, I will be back. Ok? Now, how about I sing you your favorite song and tuck you back in just the way you like it, snug as a bug in a rug. Does that sound good?”
“I think you would have enjoyed a lap dance more, but maybe another time.”
“Quit being so modest. How is Prince Charming by the way?” she asked
Cas Novak is reborn as Misha Collins  (An alternative universe version that is single, with no disrespect to the actor's family, and is similar in appearance and name only)
“What is this?” Cas asked, moving to sit next to Dean as he began to empty the basket.
The angels remained close to them, still standing over their beds and continuing to pray. Uriel could feel Balthazar getting aggravated, cursing under his breath at everything and everyone, including their father.
Updates on Monday & Friday
Cas stammered, opening his door a crack to greet her. “Uh yeah! Sorry! I thought I saw...a rat. It wasn't.”
“Then go. I am very tired.” she said as she made her way back into the darkness, but not before a snap of her fingers.
“I’m guessing you’re looking for Cas?”
Cas took a deep breath, his core shaking. “No thanks guys, I need to get home.”
“Shower. You wanna come in? Just about to order some breakfast.” Matt said before noticing the coffee and bag of food in Misha’s hand. “Oh. Were you two…”
Before Bobby left, he told him to sneak out after the parents went to bed, try Novak one more time, and then meet him at his house. Bring his bags.
“I’ll see you tomorrow at work.” he said glumly as he made his way out the door.
“...that’s horrible! I’m so sorry.” they heard Rachel say as they entered the room. “I can't imagine what it was like for you to lose both of your brothers.”
“Dead? Yes. Huge mistake. So. So. Sorry. But we are working on that right now. By the way my name is Balthazar, this is Uriel. We’re your guardian angels ” Balthazar added as fax began to print from the fax machine on the single desk in the room. Both angels ran to it, tearing the paper off of it.
“We were not!”
“Dude. I tried to tell him, but mom, she told me not to. I mean how do you not know that meat does not go into a dessert? But he was just so...happy. Kept going on about how it was exactly what you wanted, and how perfect it was. It’s the recipe that Rachel made on the show Friends, not the recipe I assume you saw on the Rachael Ray Show that he heard you talking about. ”
And just like that, they were gone.
“Would you just shut up and get up here.” Dean responded with a smirk.
“No!” Castiel yelled as he focused all of his angelic energy,  Castiel pulled his listless body to the floor and began to perform CPR along with with his grace radiating at full power. He felt for a pulse. None. No breath sounds either. Castiel continued to press in to Dean’s chest as his eyes grew brighter and brighter. “Come on...COME ON! You cannot die like this Dean. Can't lose you... I can’t lose you!”
“Is that your medical opinion, Dr. Morgan.” Misha teased. “Good thing I never gave the other pants back. Can you grab my medical kit? It’s in that box right by your leg, I think.”
“1802 W. Hargrove St. It's just a block north of here.”
“They were all ugly, that’s how. Now get down, and no smiling.” Dean demanded.
Jensen gave him a nod as he stepped back from the door.
Benny stepped in front of Cas, blocking his path.
“Rachel I’m being serious! And NO! Please. It’s important.”
“Actually Mr. Ackles is my gift. It’s my birthday today, too.” Misha interrupted, giving Jensen a wink.
“I will always be with you Jensen...I love you.”

“Thank you dad, I love you.” Dean’s voice cracked as he gave him one more tight squeeze, before walking away.
“You. All of this. You're just not what I expected.” Jensen added.
“No, he is not right. You are. It is perfect. ”
“Hello?”
“Dean? It's me. Can I come in?”
“I have won 7 Emmys, Novak!”
“So beautiful.” he murmured, before dropping down to his knees between Jensen’s legs, kissing his way up the inside of Jensen’s thighs, leaving tiny little love marks on his tender skin.
Dean fired off the next pitch, a fast ball, but it was no match to the velocity of Cas’ swing, sending it up and over the centerfield fence. Dean, mouth gaping open, watched it go over before he turned back to look at the hitter, and only then did Cas carefully dust himself off, his blue eyes focused on him only, as he tossed aside his bat and took his victory lap.

“Hello Dean? What the hell man! I have been looking all over for you. Where have you been?”
“Hi.” Misha replied.
Dean climbed the stairs of his house and went into his room, finding a large suitcase almost fully packed on his bed, his laundry basket full of clean clothes, sitting next to it. Instead of moving them to sit down, he knelt down in front of it, clasped his hands together, and began to pray.
“It’s for my mother.” Misha slurred a bit. “She loves this kind of stuff.”
As Dean pulled away he looked out at the water, it was a beautiful night. Leaving his shirt on the ground, he stood up and removed his pants, leaving Cas speechless as eyes washed over him.
Standing outside the gym doors, Cas stared at the freshly posted team roster, a sense of relief washed over him just when he heard someone walk up behind him.
“I said, No!” he repeated in the same tone. “I won’t go. I’m 18. I’m an adult. You can’t make me.”
“Yeah, it was kinda weird.” Matt replied, handing Jensen one of the cups of coffee.
The cast and crew finished the script, and were excused to prepare for filming that day.
“Nope, just going to get ready, maybe get some lunch.” Jensen said as he placed a kiss on Misha’s temple.

“No way, it’s freezing.” Cas whined.

Misha finally made his way back to his office, plopping down in his chair, full and exhausted. He so badly wanted to drift off for a quick nap, but a loud familiar voice got his full attention when his lead actor stormed into his office, his script gripped tight in his hand.
“But what if we don’t find each other Dean? We could be together here, now..”
“I love your show.” an elderly woman near the back said with a wink.
“Dylan, people who do what you tried to do to this man’s career have no place on my set. I commend you for getting the help you needed and I wish you nothing but success with your road to sobriety, but don’t you ever call my office again. And if you show up on my set, you will be escorted off by me or by my security team. Now, did you understand that?”
POSTING TWO CHAPTERS TODAY!
“Heaven. Not hell.” the panicked one interrupted.
“You mean he, the…”
Cas picked up his gear, and what pride he had left and headed home, leaving Dean speechless.
“See, that’s the thing son, she was very specific, she said you broke up with her for a teammate of yours who is rumored to be a homosexual. Dean, why would she tell us that?”
After a long goodbye, Dean pulled into his driveway. He looked down at his watch and cursed, he was for sure going to get in trouble for this. He wanted so much to be back on that old lake dock, bathed in the moon’s light, in Cas’s arms, content. Turning his key ever so slowly, he tiptoed into the house, placing his foot on the second step to avoid the squeaky first one, when a lamp clicked over, illuminating the living room; it was his father.
“Ok then.” Dylan quipped, clearing his throat.
To minimize the confusion:
“I don’t think that’s even possible, Mom.”
“Not much? How about not at all.” Misha responded, as he filled two wine glasses of chillable red from the spout, handing one to Jensen.
Jensen “Dean Winchester” Ackles and Misha “James ‘Cas’ Novak” Collins were married exactly one year later on Woodcreek High School’s varsity baseball field pitcher’s mound, surrounded by all of their dearest friends and loved ones. To some it seemed like an odd location choice for two hollywood names, but when Dean and Cas looked in to each other’s eyes as they read their vows that day, slipping a gold band around the other’s finger, the only person they saw standing in front of them was the man with the same blue and same green eyes that fearlessly stared each other down from that batter’s box to this pitcher’s mound the stood on on, the eyes that connected their souls, looking deep into the other’s when they made love for the first time under the stars by the lake all those years ago, and the same eyes that closed when they died and reopened to live again.
“Yes. I think so.” Castiel answered.
“Number one, you will not remember who you were/are now, nor being here. Knowledge about heaven’s existence could be risky when it comes to humans and free will. Number 2, you will be born and raised by families with similar qualities, and will be doppelgangers of your current self. And finally, you will only have 35 years to find and profess your love for one another. Then, and only then, will you remember your previous life together.”
“Problem. Matt Cohen is in there. Can we go to your room instead? And then maybe you can go get him out of mine?” Jensen begged.
Misha looked down at it momentarily before looking back up into Jensen’s eyes, noticing the colors were the same. A memory of a lake flashed before Misha’s eyes, causing him to sway.
The first day of the convention was a success. Tomorrow would be filled with individual panels, photo opportunities, and autographs; but tonight would be filled with the biggest party on the Las Vegas Strip as the cast and crew celebrated the Emmy nominations on the dime of their network. G.M. went all out, from the champagne to the decadent foods and swag bags that included thousands of dollars worth of merchandise.
As Cas crossed the home plate to the sounds of his own cheering, he turned to make his way towards Dean, wrapping his big arms around the still hunched over pitcher.
“Remember? He was 4 years old the last time Misha saw him, IN A DIFFERENT LIFE! That HE erased from his mind! ”
It was Misha’s floor.
“I love you Ma.”
“I know. I remember. Used to come watch you play baseball every spring. Wrote for the paper.”
Jensen froze. Taking a deep breath in, he slowly turned back around.
“Jesus Christ, you scared the hell out of me Dean Winchester! I thought you were an alligator or...Nessy!”
“The extra pants? Can you grab them for me?”
“Dean?”
“And both of you having your 35th birthday land on the same day as the Emmy's! It will truly be a day for celebration!” She added gleefully.
Castiel exhaled through his nose, looking down at the strong, stubborn man, laying broken before him, his heart breaking. He suddenly had a flashback, a memory of a story that Dean had told him, about how Mary would make him feel better when he was a young boy...it was worth a shot. With great caution, he laid his hand gently atop Dean’s head and began strumming his fingers slowly through his thick, coarse hair. Dean flinched the first few strokes, still resistant to being healed, but the simple wave like pattern of his fingers was almost euphoric. He began to press in to it, shifting slightly upwards with each stroke to be closer...eventually lifting his shoulder ever so slightly to rest upon Castiel’s thigh, allowing the angels trench coat to drop over his shoulders like a blanket. Castiel continued the motion, his eyes closing, as he felt Dean begin to relax, his heart rate started to slow….too slow...
“Why were you in rehab?” Jensen interjected, finally making his way over to sit on the opposite side of the couch.
“Love you too. Happy Birthday! To both of you! Good luck!”
Dean continued to undress, pulling off his socks, and then his underwear.
“So, you and the Winchester boy.”
“Time for us to go! Mr. Michaels is already at the studio and everyone is looking for us. The meeting is in less than an hour!”
“Yeah.” Cas replied.
Jensen turned and nosed around in the box, and pulled it out, noticing all the rest of the boxes stacked in his office.”
Dean leaned on to the counter top, and took a couple of deep breaths. It was going to be ok, he kept telling himself. He picked up the phone receiver one more time and dialed.
As Misha moved towards the door, he handed Jensen his $100 bill back and he slid on his coat, looking down at his watch. “Ooo. I have to go. I have a meeting to get to. It was very nice to finally meet you Jensen. Happy Birthday.”
“There is plenty of air right here in our backyard, and this is your party. Now go back into that house, put your cap and gown back on and greet your guests….they’ve been waiting.” She demanded, snatching his keys from his hands.

“Your mother gave me these. You forgot your ties. Here.” Gabriel said, handing Dean a blue tie, and Cas a green one. Gabriel wrapped his brother’s tie around his neck, tying it perfectly for him before giving him a loving pat on his cheek.
“I packed like two weeks ago, just in case. Oh. I almost forgot.” Cas reached into his desk drawer and removed two envelopes: one addressed to his parents, the other to his brother Gabriel. He ran out of the room to deliver them, returning only moments later. “Ok. Now I’m ready, let's go.”
Months flew by. Their relationship after that night on the couch became strained, almost nonexistent. Misha tried so many times to talk to him about what happened but Jensen was all business, rebuking every attempt he made to talk alone. Rachel shared a tidbit about Jensen’s psyche over a drink one night about his history of not so nice people, and how he had been cheated on in the past. The show was the only thing going well: ratings were up, and the updated storyline, along with the changes made directly to Jensen’s character were being reviewed as ground breaking in their line of entertainment. There was buzz about the upcoming fan convention at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. Meet and Greets with its main stars were sold out, along with photo opportunities and panels. Misha himself was even going to have a panel with the actors to discuss the forward thinking writing that was getting Emmy talks along with it’s leading actor, but the main topic would for sure be the recent casting of a male character who was set to play a new love interest for Jensen’s character.
Maybe he should call him. He knew that he was a very busy man, maybe he was still working? Or forgot? Or maybe he just didn’t feel the same way, or just saw him as a hook up? Jensen began to nibble on his fingernails.
Arriving in his favorite faded Stones t-shirt and jeans, he followed the hostess to a reserved backroom. The sound of loud classic rock music and voices greeted him as he opened the door.
Dean pulled off his cap, running his hand through his sweaty hair. “Is something wrong?”
“What ‘s the matter with you? I get nothing for that? That was perfect!” he decreed with a proud smile.
“Well whatever you do...I’m just really glad you won’t be alone.” she said with a little sniff.
“What the fuck man!” Cas whisper screamed.
“You love me?” Dean added with a knowing grin.
“You said you always wanted to come here, right?” Dean asked, still ignoring Cas’s pleas.
Castiel took a handful of ladyfingers and began placing them carefully in the bottom of the glass dessert bowl. Sam smiled as he watched him create layer after layer of the delicious fillings as he made himself a sandwich. The layers of jam and custard were even making him hungry. As he reached the top of the dish, Castiel moved to the stove, picking up the hot saute pan and moving it to the counter top.
The newest member of the team shook her small delicate hand, “I’m James Novak, people call me Cas. It’s nice to meet you, and thank you.”
“AAAAHHHHHHHH!” Cas screamed, silenced by Dean’s open hand over his mouth seconds later. Cas shook with fear, but calmed when his eyes adjusted on those very familiar green eyes. Dean pulled his hand away, and closed the door.
Tarnished and torn the three weary men returned to the bunker. The odds were against them, but they survived. The brothers stumbled to the closest chairs, collapsing in to them as the angel leaned with trembling hands on the table, taking inventory of his own wounds, before he could tend to theirs. Winded, and still in a state of shock over the events that occurred that night, he groaned as he motioned gingerly over the wounds of his battered vessel. Turning to the tallest Winchester, he found tears and a pain stricken grin reflecting his relief to still be alive, his golden green eyes mirrored Cas’, full of worry for his well being also. What they had been through was nothing like they had ever faced before; the Apocalypse was here. Castiel pressed two-fingers gently to Sam's head, the broken bones and wounds began to regenerate to their former, healthier state. Sam immediately pulled him in for a much needed embrace, releasing him with a nod and a slap upon the shoulder before stretching out his arms, rotating them in small and large circles, grateful for the physical relief. There were no words... the lonely pencil on the table said it all.
