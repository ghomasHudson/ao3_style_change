I've counted on readers remembering Endgame pretty well here, so I'm sorry if for anyone things feel rushed or confusing. I just really didn't want to rehearse the whole movie to you because that in my opinion would be boring as hell for you and me both. Let me know how I did!
It’s okay. He can do this. He can. He will not let Tony down; he will control his lust like he’s expected.
But letting that magnificent, ruthless, beautiful thing between them go? Giving up on the love of his life?
Steve wishes he could believe him. But even as he tires of the crying, he feels like all of his wounds are left bleeding. He just grows momentarily numb to them, to the pain.
Steve didn’t want to keep him waiting, so he pushed Tony’s underwear off and started to caress his ass and thighs, slowly progressing to Tony’s perineum and starting to massage it with his fingers as Tony pushed his leg forward to allow him better access. After a moment, he brought a finger into his mouth, letting Tony hear how he wet it, and then brought it back down to tease at Tony’s hole.
Tony’s silent besides his ragged breath. There’s not much space for him in Steve’s thoughts as he floats in his escape, but when he feels Tony suddenly slow down a bit, his panting getting throatier as a telltale sign that he’s about to come, Steve snaps out of his head. He listens to Tony finish, feeling a little disappointed that it’s already over.
”Nat”, Steve whispers. ”Of course you can.”
Tony flips him roughly back onto his stomach and locks his wrists behind his back. Steve’s breath hitches as Tony kicks his legs apart.
”I think that’s enough”, Tony’s voice tells him calmly.
”What the fuck is wrong with you?! What is it?!” Tony cries at him, seeing nothing but all of his own failures as he looks at Steve. And then he sees that it’s even worse; he’s managed to make a cut on Steve’s cheek with the door. It’s bleeding. Great. He’s physically hurt his omega. He’s done that in battle before and he still thinks about it every single day. It doesn’t matter that it’s small, or that it will heal in a minute.
”I’ve never been the easiest one, and you know I’ll never be. But I regret causing you so much pain, I regret it every breath I take, and If I could I would do things differently. But I can’t go back in time. If that was possible, I would have left this century the second I woke up in it and would have never met you. I’m not trying to justify what I did, but I keep telling myself that there has to be something good waiting after this too”, he says, breathing out shakily. His fingers squeeze Tony’s hand, and Tony realises he has squeezed back without even thinking.
The therapist shifts in her chair. Steve notices that something’s probably caught her attention, but he reminds himself that she’s only here to help.
When he was done, he reached for Steve’s shirt from the pile of clothes on the floor. He used it to gently wipe Steve’s own mess from his stomach, then finally his own hands.
Tony looks at him, his mouth hanging open as if he can’t believe that he’s alive and here. Both of them are at a loss for words, so for a moment they just cling to each other, trembling in each other’s arms. Steve can hardly breathe through his relieved tears as he kisses Tony’s temple.
? He shrugs him off.
But Thor insists that he shouldn’t have done it. He can’t really say aloud that he should’ve gone the other way, because it
”Little Starks, I see”, he says, eyeing the dark-haired offspring of his childhood friend.
”I mean that it’s entirely possible to genuinely want a child and also hope that having them will fix your relationship. It’s more common than you might think. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you didn’t want your children, and it most definitely doesn’t mean that you don’t love them.”
Steve is silent for a moment, clearly swallowing his tears down. He’s lying on the floor, his hair touching Tony’s knees.
”Please”, he heard himself say.
Steve makes a little choked sound at the playful accusation, unsure if he’s meant to answer. It isn’t true, though, and for a while he loses himself into the thought, even though he knows it’s just play talk.
Despite the blush that creeps onto his face, if Steve could somehow present himself even better, he would. Every cell in him seems to be aware of Tony’s eyes on him, of the fact that he is staring straight at his most intimate places, but in this setting, he also feels that Tony simply has the right. In a way, his body doesn’t belong to him here, it belongs to Tony, and it’s freeing. He is also not a weapon, a super soldier here, he is a human with human needs and flaws and fears. These are things that Tony not only allows him but recognises in him here, and for that, Steve is more grateful than he could ever put into words.
The alpha is sitting across from where Steve has sat down, focused on his tablet. His scarred fingers are curled lightly around his coffee mug that says ”Dear Dad, Thanks 4 putting up with a spoiled, ungrateful, messy, bratty child, like my sibling.”, which is as Emmett as a present can be.
Tony hums in confirmation, then lifts his finger up to signal for Steve to hold whatever he’s going to say as he fights off a new wave of nausea.
The next thing to get affected is his appetite. It is the last thing he could ever imagine becoming a problem for him, and that makes Steve realise that this might be more serious than just the stress of a new parent. But he pushes the realisation to the back of his mind, reluctant to face it. And so eating begins to feel like nothing but a chore, much more so than when he was eating the hellish amounts while pregnant.
”No. I doubt anyone’s up to it. I know I’m not.”
(See the end of the chapter for
”Surviving?” Steve repeats after him. To his woozy mind the doctor sounds annoyingly cryptic. What is the man trying to say? Steve certainly isn’t happy about this, but he’s never had any health problems during heat after the serum.
”Yes, that”, Tony answered when the man finished, voice still unfaltering. He stared at Steve, like an animal preying. ”Let me see”, he assured the caller, but he didn’t see shit – he grabbed Steve’s cock and started jerking it slowly. Steve had no chance to swallow the whimper that escaped him, but Tony’s free hand closed around his mouth quickly, like he’d been expecting it.
Tony stares straight into his eyes for a moment, his face hard to read, before he lets go.
In the car, Steve stares out the window tiredly, half-listening to the news coming from the radio. It’s raining so hard that he can barely see outside, so his eyes follow the raindrops running down the glass instead.
”You know what I’m going to say.” They’d talked about this before and Steve had already reminded Tony how well he was recovering multiple times.
Tony always used that word. According to him, Steve was perfect, and it didn’t matter that Steve himself saw everything but perfection when he looked at himself. That was what Tony called him; time after time, year after year, again and again. Even after how Steve had once hurt him, after everything that they’d been through.
”Yes! Peter Parker, sir. I saw you in – at the –”
But Steve is smiling when he looks at him again.
”You’re fucking dense, you know?” Tony says frustratedly.
”You’re a lousy nurse”, Tony joked, hauling himself to sit. Steve kissed the top of his head.
”You promised me”, Tony says, and the blame in his voice doesn’t sit well with Steve at all in this moment. He grits his teeth. ”You promised to share with me –”
”Is that so?” Tony answers, no emotion recognisable in his voice besides a hint of weariness.
He sounds so genuine, and perhaps Steve cannot see what he sees, but he can hear it in Tony’s voice.
”Come here”, he told Steve, and Steve was back to his lap in a heartbeat, his thighs rested on his calves on both sides of Tony’s thighs.
When Steve actually lifts the thing he doesn’t have the time to think about that either because he needs to save Thor. But as the Mjölnir then returns to his hand obediently, Steve allows the rush of power flow through him and makes it his goal to let Thanos be the first one to know that the rules have changed for him.
They stare at each other until Tony finally rests his forehead against Steve’s chin. ”That place smells like your distress. I think my reptilian brain got confused.”
When Steve comes back to consciousness, he sees Thor with Thanos and there’s a glimmer of hope, the last pinch of it. Thor’ll stop Thanos, not because he’s a god or because he’s strong, but because he has to. They have to.
”Sweetheart”, Steve says, voice weak but urgent, his hands now busy again with Tony’s hair. Tony lifts his face just to be pulled into a kiss by Steve. His hands start working on the buttons – what’s left of them –  on Steve’s shirt, but Steve swats them away, yearning control for himself. He slips his tongue into Tony’s mouth as his hands hurry Tony’s jacket off, then move to his belt.
As Tony quickens his thrusts furthermore, Steve’s moans begin to morph into small cries. It seems to only fuel Tony more, and he slams into Steve punishingly, grunting in abandon himself. Steve’s body is so wonderfully tired and it feels unimaginably good to have Tony take complete dominance over it, to just be there and lull in pleasure while knowing that it feels good for Tony too. He makes a mental note to be sure to remember his gratefulness when it’s his turn to drive Tony crazy with lust. But right now he can’t even imagine it, his whole world condensing into the feeling of Tony’s cock hitting his prostate over and over again.
Questions are racing through his head. Is there another? Was the ugly part of him right to be jealous of Barnes after all? Or is it just his own incompetence as an alpha? Is it a punishment?
”Oh, I know what that look means”, Tony croons. Steve pulls him close, pressing his lips to his neck.
Steve smiles unhappily, a little huff leaving him. He doesn’t know what to say. To Bucky, or to anyone else. This should be the happiest time of his life. He doesn’t know why it isn’t, why he feels like doing nothing but lying in bed for days, why he cries every night listening to Tony’s soft breathing and feeling alone. Why when his babies’ cries wake him up, he lies still and lets Tony tend to them.
He kisses Steve’s shoulder. ”You could fuck me”, he suggests airily. They’ve tried that a few times in the past and Steve has seemed to enjoy it after he’s gotten past his initial insecurity. ”That might be fun.”
”Oh, honey”, Tony sighs, pulling Steve’s head into an embrace. ”Shh.” He pets Steve’s hair comfortingly. ”You’re not in pain, are you?”
“Alpha”, Steve breathes out as they part, his long eyelashes fluttering as he looks at Tony, eyes bright just like Tony has missed seeing them as.
But Tony doesn’t touch him. There’s a joyless laugh.
”Good”, he whispered. He then switched to Tony’s right side so that the alpha could put his weight onto his good arm, taking a bottle of lube from the drawer in the process.
But there’s no going to sleep until the knot comes down. Seeing as it’s been so long since the last time, Tony knows it will take at least an hour. The wait becomes easily enjoyable as Steve begins to draw circles on his back.
Tony hadn’t answered. He still can’t say what it was, but something had struck him in that moment. And whatever it was, it still hasn’t left him.
As it turns out, I'm not nearly done with this verse. In fact, you can go
”I’m so sorry”, Steve cries. The emotions are just pouring out of him now, everything he’s been through coming out in such frantic, hopeless noises that he can hardly draw a breath in between. But he’s not really crying for what he’s been through – he’s crying for everything he’s lost. He misses his child so much. ”I think I made a mistake, Tony.”
At some point, it dawned on Tony that he was drooling. Still, it took him a few more minutes to lift his head and dry Steve’s shoulder into the pillow as was practical. When he did and then turned to look at Steve, he found the omega with his eyes closed, no distinguishable expression on his face. The long, strong legs around Tony had eased their hold of him and fallen to support themselves against the mattress.
Tony’s expression is slightly puzzled as it follows him.
”I take it Jo is with the twins?” Tony asks.
”Give me a break”, he mutters, pouring himself another one.
”So he helped you?”
There’s no point in trying to argue about that with Steve.
”I’m sorry, sir.”
Steve’s body shook in pleasure, his eyes locked on Tony, full of adore. Tony started moving his cock inside of him in a steady rhythm, and soon Steve was panting, becoming more and more loud by the minute.
Saying that, Tony realises how much he actually needs it himself. The sense that he’s doing something good for Steve, easing his grief and pain even for a second. The urge is so strong it feels primal, and it must be showing on his face because Steve’s expression turns softer.
”Tony”, he says then, looking up. ”Can you give me your hand?”
”What purpose does a funeral serve to you? You don’t believe in afterlife”, Steve says harshly, and there goes Tony’s patience, all of the fire under the ashes flaming inside of him.
The first night he can sense Steve, sense him in their old bed, where they used to make love and whisper things to each other, and he can feel his hopefulness, his longing. Tony forces the bond to mute and buries himself into his projects. The next night is the same. And the next. He tinkers on, bags starting to form under his eyes.
Steve lies down to the other side of the bed and reaches to kiss Emmett on the forehead. When he lifts his face, he sees Tony looking at him, his eyes shining with tears. Careful of Emmett, Steve moves closer to Tony and kisses him.
“I want you to count”, Tony says, gripping the laces so tight it almost makes Steve’s chest part from the mattress. Tony’s other hand finds the crook of Steve’s ass underneath the skirt, and Steve hears him hiss from between his teeth as he moves his hand across the curve, the hem of the skirt sliding up. For a moment he just caresses Steve’s ass, then palms it roughly. Steve’s breath hitches and it takes all of his self-control not to grind against Tony’s lap.
When Steve does finally come, it’s almost painful. His legs tremble against the cold tile floor as he lets himself go.
Tony pets Steve’s hair as he drops back to his thoughts, where Strange’s last words keep echoing.
”I’d love to, if you really feel up to it”, Steve told him, kissing his jaw. ”But you’ll have to let me do the work, sweetheart.”
His omega. Not so proud right now, but beautiful in a different way, with the vulnerable glint in his eyes, the nervous strain in his shoulders. It makes Tony’s chest tight, and as endearing as it is in a way, he wants to see Steve flourish again, see him happy.
Steve’s gaze had traveled somewhere Tony hadn’t been able to follow it, and his voice had been colourless when he’d spoken. ”He was supposed to be here this week, wasn’t he?”
still look like the definition of peak human performance.”
If the heat would’ve happened two months ago, like it should’ve, Steve would’ve been home. With Tony, who would’ve taken care of the twins.
These are facts, ones that make it very hard to explain why, for the past two weeks, Tony has been buried in the subject. He has scoured through everything and everyone, from Doctor Who to parallel universes, from Gödel to Matthew McConaughey. Most of it is complete rubbish, of course, and in a different mindset, Tony would simply laugh at it. But he’s looking for something.
”Tell me what you’re thinking.”
”Let me put a pillow under you”, Tony prompted, patting Steve’s thigh with his palm.
Steve stirs a little as Tony strokes his chest, and when Tony presses a kiss to his back, Steve’s arm moves indulgently to allow more room for Tony’s touches, his hips pushing back towards Tony’s hard cock. It’s a pretty clear invitation, and still aware of their limited time, Tony lets his hand travel lower to palm Steve’s ass, earning a little hum from his omega. Pliantly, Steve leans forward to bare himself, and with a satisfied growl Tony slips his hand to Steve’s crack, the side of his palm sliding against the wetness as he cups Steve’s ass cheek. There’s so, so much slick, and Tony has to bring his hand to his lips to taste it.
”Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t”, Tony mumbled. ”I’m done moving for the day.”
Steve’s eyes flick towards where there seems to be light coming inside the ruins from the outside. He can feel his whole body becoming electrified with purpose, his chest filling with determination so raw that it’s close to rage. He never feels rage.
”I know”, Steve struggles. ”I know, it’s just – I doubt myself, and it scares me.”
Tony’s mouth parted, his eyes widening. Steve sucked the finger slowly, close to the manner that he’d suck a dick in.
, he thinks, his ass sucking the knot inside of him, his breath shaking as he keeps biting Tony. He feels hot white heat rising in his own stomach as he’s reminded of being bred, of Tony marking him in a way that his body wouldn’t erase. He can feel Tony’s heartbeat inside of him, his cock throbbing against his walls as he keeps releasing come inside of Steve.
Steve couldn’t help the affectionate smile that pushed onto his face. He walked to Tony and wrapped his hands around him from behind.
Tony squeaks at the way he has to stop himself from simply devouring Steve. Because of his healing abilities, every time is physically the first for Steve, and Tony has always preferred to take his time with him.
”Good”, Tony murmured, riding him through it, planting a kiss on Steve’s back. ”Good, baby.”
”Of course”, he answers, relieved that they seem to be somehow managing to avoid a pointless argument, which Tony had honestly been expecting. ”Of course I would. Right now?”
Steve settles down, yawning so deep he thinks his jaw will dislocate. He snuggles as close to Tony as possible. ”Thank you. I love you. Please be quiet.”
”— he’s back, Tony, he’s… they’re both here –”
It hurts so much to think about it, how much they’d wasted time fighting with each other, how much they’d still loved each other and somehow always found a way to make it work.
”Steve”, he whispers tightly, his own voice sounding pathetic in his ears. He doesn’t really care, though.
A choked noise escapes the back of Steve’s throat, and he’s too high-strung to even respond to the kiss properly. He parts his lips but doesn’t move them much, his posture stiff as if his body is about to snap in half any second. It’s like he’s too afraid of ruining it to even move.
”What’s going on, Steve?” Bucky asks when he doesn’t answer him.
touch me –”
to him, to his touch.
”We need your help, guys”, Bruce says as they part.
”Yeh, ’ir”, he struggles, drool dripping down his jaw despite his efforts. His eyes land on Tony’s cock again, and he can’t not look at it, the way it’s moving, the tip of it vanishing between his pecs and Tony’s hand and appearing again in a steady rhythm, making slick noises against his wet chest. Steve’s hips want to move in rhythm with it even if they have nothing to gain from it, and he can’t stop them from pushing into the air uselessly.
”Good”, he tells Steve after a while, and he’s surprised by how low his own voice has become. This should be a calming moment for them, but Steve’s breath has grown shallow and he lifts his eyes to look at Tony in agony.
”All in good time, honey”, Tony tells him, noticing his brief misunderstanding. He warms the liquid in his hands and then begins to massage Steve’s back, uncaring of how the dripping oil will probably give the corset its final death blow.
“Please”, Steve groaned, his voice needy. He knew what he needed to say, he wanted to say it, but his face still heated aggressively as he slurred the words out.
”I’m going to be honest with you, Steve. It doesn’t look good. The nano-machines have managed to stop the bleeding, but the internal damage is bad.” Bruce looks at him sympathetically.
Because there’s nothing else in the universe that matters in the end.
Steve shakes his head, trying to get hold of some rational thinking.
”It’s rude to be late”, Steve had fired back in the slightly cheeky, educative tone he had seemed to fall into way too easily for his own taste those days, especially around Tony. He hadn’t seemed to be able to act naturally around him. Stupid things had just forced their way out of his mouth whenever he had been in close proximity to Tony, and Steve hadn’t known how to stop them. The reason, of course, is obvious.
When Steve shows up on his - their - doorstep, silent and his head bowed down, it’s way too soon. Too soon after his betrayal - that’s what Tony calls it, because that’s what it is -, too soon for the anger to have begun to wear, too soon for the wound to have had enough time to start healing. But what is Tony going to do, slam the door shut to the face of the omega he's bonded to, denying him the shelter of their shared home?
“That’s adorable”, he says fondly, and Steve swallows, a quick, self-deprecating smile flickering over his features before his face relaxes into a moan as Tony pushes his fingers demandingly against his prostate. He starts rocking them back and forth, and Steve squirms around his fingers, feeling his cock leaking pre-cum to the floor in response.
A wide smile spreads onto Steve’s face.
Several minutes pass before Steve breaks it.
He’s Tony’s, simple as that. From head to toes, in and out, for better and for worse. Was always meant to be, will always be.
”I love you too, baby”, he whispered.
Steve blinks at him, then drops his gaze into his hands. It takes a long time before he answers, and Bucky already fears that he’s going to hear some nonsense about how it isn’t that simple, when it obviously is.
”I want to have a funeral”, he says suddenly into the darkness, feeling more clear-headed than for a month despite the alcohol in his blood.
If Steve thought Tony wouldn’t beg, he had another thing coming.
It was bordering on being a case of too little too late, however. The heel of Steve’s foot was sloppily yet insistently pressing against Tony’s lower back, trying to pull him closer and closer so that it was becoming difficult for Tony to move his hips. Steve was bigger and much more stronger than him, and were he to go truly out of control, there wouldn’t be much Tony could do. Thankfully, Steve was usually rather docile even in his worst heat deliriousness, just a big, clumsy ball of love, and Tony had never had any real problems dealing with Steve’s heat despite their difference in size not working for his favor.
”Fuck!” he screams, voice hoarse from crying. His back hurts, his head hurts, his heart hurts, and he’s fed up with this feeling of loss and unsatisfiable lust and need.
”So, I take it Steve’s recovered then?” Pepper inquires. Tony’s face springs up.
”I’ll let that slide just because it was so fucking cute”, he says, petting Steve’s hair in passing as he moves back behind him. ”But from now on you’ll be good, right?” he asks, more an order than an actual question.
They’ve been together for years, but Steve still doesn’t know how to react when Tony praises him for the weirdest things, things that should appear as unattractive to an alpha. He knows Tony says them earnestly, that he’d never mock him for how he is, but it’s hard to accept when all Steve sees himself is flaws. There’s a dichotomy inside of him, because where one part of him respects and values the responsibility he’d been given as Captain America enormously, another, private part of him feels wrong, malformed. Of course, he doesn’t miss being sickly and weak, but he sometimes can’t help envying the omegas that look like they were expected to look. Some of them are so beautiful in all of their grace that they almost make Steve himself want to protect them. It isn’t like Steve is the only omega with a bigger build out there, but everyone knows what type of an omega tends to get the most of attention.
”Kyle says there was a war between you”, he puts out innocently, out of the blue.
as he’s forced to lift his body, including his hips, under Tony, to free the corset from under his weight.
”Tell me”, Steve encourages, and Tony tells him about Peter and Strange, about Ebony Maw, about Titan, about Peter Quill and the whole weird quartet that had showed up, the battle with Thanos. He goes quiet as he tells how Peter had turned into ashes in his arms, how everyone except him and Nebula had vanished. About how they’d ended up stranded in space with air about to go out and how “the glowing woman”, as he calls Carol, had showed up at the final hour.
every syllable as they translate into information through his ear.
Tony pets his hair tiredly. His eyes have already slipped closed.
It was too absurd for Steve to not let out a little laugh. He leaned down to kiss Tony’s forehead, and the alpha brought his hand to his face, coaxing his mouth to his.
”I’m sure they’re both fine. The building collapsed. It’s only been a few minutes.”
”You don’t need to think about anything like that”, he told Tony. ”Nothing could make me more happier than having you here with me, having our family back.”
”Yes.” If he has to make any more reassurances, he swears he’ll –
”In Germany”, Steve finishes for him, holding onto his smile. The situation must be at least confusing if not curious for the young man, Kieran’s persistent crying in the background certainly not helping. ”You were really impressive.”
Steve would normally offer him some banter back, but he’s got too much on his mind to come up with anything.
”What day is it? How’s Emmett?”
He could lie. He could say that he was afraid that either of them would get seriously injured in battle, die even. But Steve has lied before, and that, at its core, is the reason why he’s sitting here now.
”You okay, honey?”
”Me neither. Tony –”
”I thought a violinist would’ve been a tad too much, so I hope you like AC/DC.”
”Aah, that’s good, just like that, baby.”
Steve gives his alpha a chiding look before turning back to Peter.
”Daddy, please.”
”But I don’t know if Tony’s gone or not”, he says, grimacing at the way his lower stomach spasms. His forehead is drenched in cold sweat, and he wipes it with his sleeve.
”Mmh?”
He quickly forgets the whole thing as the morning routine gets going; between making and drinking coffee Steve feeds, changes and dresses the twins. The babysitter insists on helping by making breakfast, and Steve doesn’t protest – it’s probably awkward for her to be at her workplace and just sit watching.
Steve’s choice, but Steve can read from between the lines that he thinks so. He wouldn’t admit it to Thor, but the more days pass, the more Steve feels that Thor might be right.
”Okay. Then what do you wanna do? Name it, I’m down for it. Let’s go steal a car. Or how do you feel about Seychelles? Oh, have you ever been to a colon cleansing? Kinda want to try –“
”Sorry”, Steve says quietly.
”Are you
Friday comes, and everything seems to go well. They watch a movie, after which Steve is gifted probably the best orgasm of his life so far and then falls asleep breathing against Tony’s neck peacefully. He wakes up only once to Tony being up on his tablet following the stock, but he just wraps his arm around Tony’s waist and lets Tony stroking his hair lull him right back to sleep. The next time he drifts awake, Tony is pressed against him and sleeping soundly.
”You have nice hair”, he says. It’s true and he just feels like saying something nice. Steve studies his face.
“Well done”, he says then. “Look at me.”
to help him, Tony.”
”Thor!”
Tony had sat beside him, taking the coffee Steve had brought for him. It had been a bright day in mid-July, way too hot for coffee. Sweat drops had formed on Tony’s forehead as he’d sipped his steaming drink.
Tony wipes the tears from Steve’s face, and when he’s done, Steve gives him a frail smile, catching his hand between his own. He brings it to his mouth and starts planting kisses on it.
”Don’t look so disappointed, sweetie”, Tony tells him briskly, his fingers admiring the leather of the whip, and Steve forces his face to go back to neutral. It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy whipping, it’s just that he needs Tony inside of him like yesterday.
When Steve had come down enough, he felt Tony pull out. A hand wrapped around Steve’s trembling body.
”I was afraid”, Tony admits, and he looks so fragile, having lost so much weight. Just like with Emmett, Steve isn’t sure how he’ll ever let Tony out of his sight again. ”I couldn’t sense anything through the bond.”
”Stop it”, Steve snaps at Tony. ”You’re stressing Emmy out.” He turns to Emmett. ”It’s okay, honey. Shh. You don’t have to worry about it. No, you don’t have to worry about anything, sweetie.”
”Is it bad?”
After a few more snaps of Steve’s hips Tony was coming, panting hard, his hips trembling against Steve’s weight.
So. To the epilogue. :)
Tony hums in affirmation. ”And is that how we play?” he asks, tightening his grip even more. Steve gasps in pain.
”Tony”, Steve chides between his pants, sounding a tad embarrassed. But Tony won’t have it.
”You have money, Steve.”
”Sorry! Sorry,” Tony says guiltily, stopping immediately. He looks vaguely confused when Steve shoots him a look over his shoulder.
Tony rolls over to blink his eyes at the clock on his nightstand. 6:57 am, it informs him.
Steve’s voice pulls Bucky out of his thoughts.
He’s trying to be a little stern; they’ve already explained the situation to the twins well ahead, never mind the fact that this isn’t the first time they’ve been sent away from home for Steve’s heat days. But, as Tony glances at him from under his brows with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, Steve has to purse his lips together to suppress a grin.
Tony sighs through his nose. ”Yeah, I’m sorry, that went too far.” It’s more the thing to say than an entirely sincere apology.
Steve doesn’t answer. Instead, he huddles close and presses his lips on Tony’s forehead.
A particularly long and demanding thrust cuts his voice. Tony shows a quick smirk at this. Steve doesn’t smile.
”No”, Steve confirmed, his voice becoming alarmed. ”What do you mean? Was that –”
Steve gave JARVIS a long list of take-out to order, ignoring how Tony’s brows rose amusedly as he listened to him go on and on.
”And I love you because you’re the most handsome man I’ve ever laid my eyes upon, and I love you for the subtle grey that has begun to show up in your beard, because it makes you look even more handsome if possible.” A kiss on the chin, where said beard prickled Steve’s lips.
Steve’s hips had stopped moving, and when he began thrusting again, Tony whined into his mouth. Steve took his hand and pushed it gently against the mattress, entwining their fingers together.
”You’re not okay, honey.”
The one shouting is Bruce. It is good to hear Bruce’s voice. It’s not good to hear it so alarmed.
”I imagined your voice in my head and I…”, he trails off, looking fragile, and Tony sighs, the sadness catching up to him. It’s better that Steve says these things out loud if they haunt him, instead of holding it all in, but it frustrates and hurts Tony to remember again how he couldn’t be there, couldn’t protect his omega.
Steve swallows. He doesn’t stop to consider.
”That’s not what I meant”, the doctor explains, his voice getting serious as he continues. ”I strongly advise you’ll find an alpha. A friend, perhaps. But you’ll need an alpha to be with you.”
”Please”, he begs, curling himself into a ball. He doesn’t know who his plea is meant for; for God perhaps, or the universe. ”Please give him back to me.”
They’ll make it count. They’ll get everyone back, and Nat will at least be able to tell Clint’s family how brave Clint was.
”Okay. Maybe try to, you know, keep the growling at minimum”, he jokes, narrowly escaping a pillow thrown at him as he slips into the hallway.
The tongue was persistent and pressed against Tony’s neck now, slightly tickling him as he shifted under the 240 pounds of weight that was his omega clumsily trying to climb into his lap and left Tony’s lungs in a shortage of air.
teasing, but it was good, so good and he couldn’t think straight for long enough to argue anyway.
”Let me do that for you.”
Tony gives him one final, ensuring look and after Steve answers it with a sincere expression, he begins to kiss a trail up Steve’s arm to his shoulder, his hand slowly finding its way back lower. Steve caresses Tony’s spine lightly with the tips of his fingers, his lips meeting Tony’s with a tiny hum.
Tony’s eyes stayed closed when Steve pulled away, but a drowsy mumble still left him.
”Yes, it’s a defence mechanism. You know this”, Tony answers. ”Now you’re thinking: ’next he’s gonna tell me he likes that loud music they call rock or stone or something like that’.”
”You say that now, wait ’til he outruns you on your morning jog”, Tony teases.
There are no dreams now when he sleeps, no Tony. Just darkness.
“I love you too”, Tony says when they part. Steve’s fingers fidget with the sleeve of Tony’s t-shirt.
”Tony”, Steve said with patience gentle enough to stop wars, stroking Tony’s cheek with the tip of his thumb. ”It’s all right to let me take care of you.”
As usual, Steve was ready to go either way, his cock fully erect and slick dripping down his thighs as he stroked himself a few times. While he then lubed his cock his eyes studied Tony, making sure that this was a safe position considering Tony’s injury. Deeming the alpha comfortable-looking, he pushed Tony’s leg to the side a little, spreading him wider to make entering him easier.
“Good”, Tony grinned at him, kissing his calf. He pulled Steve’s other leg up, pushed the thigh against Steve’s stomach. His cock brushed against Steve’s hole. “You want daddy to fuck you?”
”Make love to me”, he says, pressing needy kisses on Tony’s neck.
When he’s gone, Steve ransacks through the box, finding the toy he’d used before placed back inside it. He can’t muster up any shame for the realisation that his friends must have collected the toys after him earlier.
Just on cue, Steve turns, laying his arm over Tony’s chest carefully. Tony never stops wondering what a graceful sleeper he is – he never steals the blanket, never kicks Tony in his sleep or throws a crushing leg over him, and absolutely never snores. He just adjusts perfectly to however Tony moves, even in his sleep, always making sure that Tony isn’t too far away but never smothering him either.
”There. That’s better, right?”
Steve peeks in to see Tony sitting on the floor, his forehead leaned against the toilet seat. Steve steps in and rubs Tony’s shoulder comfortingly before he sits down to accompany him.
Tony stares at her. He doesn’t know if he should be worried – even more worried than he already is – or angry. Steve has been sick? And now Tony’s been caught with his metaphorical pants down, not having a clue about what Pepper’s talking about.
”You’re welcome. You can use my name if you want.”
Steve tries to focus his senses into understanding what Tony’s talking about, but Tony’s pace gives him no mercy. He slaps Steve’s ass again, his pace almost in the realm of ruthless now and the pressure is gathering inside of Steve, blocking everything else from his comprehension as the noises leaving him fill the room.
much. It’s like something massive has collapsed right on top of him, his panicked mind clawing at the weight but finding no way out. Deep inside of him, he’s now aware that Tony’s gone, although nothing still makes sense.
Steve sounded like he was in fucking love, and for reasons unknown to man, Tony had to see for himself. He forced his eyes open to see Steve’s hand working between his legs, his mouth parted in an expression best described as fascination. A normal human would have grown tired of the pace Steve was keeping very quickly, but Steve hardly seemed to be thinking of it, his eyes concentrated on Tony’s cock.
Tony solves his throat.
”The heat started, and it was bad. I couldn’t think about anything but you, all the time, every breath. I ended up fainting from the pain. When I woke up, Nat and Thor were there, and Thor, he smelled like an alpha –”
”Jesus… FRIDAY!” he grumbles, and the bells go silent.
Steve whimpers, his walls trying to demonstrate exactly what Tony has just described. Tony fucks his fingers in a bit harder a couple of times, then resumes his slower pace. Though he doesn’t show it, he never stops being alert for any signs of discomfort from Steve.
“That’s my man. Look at me, baby.”
”I thought… Fuck, okay, never-mind. Guess we’re here.” He settles his weight down to his arms, tries to smile at Steve.
Tony kisses him on the cheek, his finger teasing at Steve’s hole.
Steve gives him a warm smile. ”I’m happy to hear that. Does this mean I’ll finally get to sleep next to you?”
”No, don’t stop, baby, don’t stop”, Tony urges him on, his hips now meeting the backs of Steve’s thighs each time he sinks his ass back down on his cock.
Steve nods. Tony caresses his cheek, his eyes subtly turning darker.
He’s wrong to expect praise for his words, though, and he realises his mistake a little too late. Tony shakes his head slowly, meeting Steve’s eyes in the mirror. Then he yanks Steve’s head backwards roughly by his hair, and Steve winces, the pull nearly pushing tears into his eyes.
”I’m sorry. Emmy was sleeping and…” Steve trails off. He simply hadn’t wanted to leave Emmett.
Steve can tell that he’s already afraid of the answer even if he’s trying not to let that into his voice. But even without the bond revealing to him that Tony is nervous, this close Steve can easily hear his elevated heart rate.
After a while, Steve puts his own hand on top of Tony’s, and Tony grips it.
”Do you really think it’s possible?”
Steve has to process the information for a moment. It’s somehow a little endearing, really, although he understands that Tony actually struggles with this thing. But obviously, it doesn’t put Steve off an inch.
Steve’s hand reaches to frame Tony’s face, to fondle Tony’s ear and the back of his head. ”I thought I’d lost you. I
”Thank you, sir.” He offers Tony a cordial look.
”Emmy’s okay, he’s with Rhodey –”
It takes a while before Tony answers. ”I shouldn’t have left at all. Didn’t really help you build your trust in me, this stunt, did it?” he explains, chagrined.
“I’m sorry for vanishing.”
”Mine”, Tony hissed, his balance tipping a little as Steve suddenly lifted his leg. In a quick motion, Tony fixed it by pulling the leg against his chest and lifting the calf to rest over his shoulder, and Steve wailed as Tony’s cock sank deeper into him.
Tony looks away. He guesses he should already be used to Steve putting him into humiliating situations like this, situations that make it obvious that he has next to zero control of anything happening inside of his relationship, but he isn’t. Steve had made a promise to him.
Steve leaned closer to press a kiss onto Tony’s forehead. He’d expected more habitual protest from him, but he was glad that there wasn’t any.
A memory spikes Tony suddenly. Phil’s death: Steve Rogers, this broody, all important omega that seemed to instantly know where all of Tony’s buttons were, approaching him just to talk to him condescendingly.
”Good. You’re allowed to look. Keep those pretty eyes on me for now.”
Steve frowns. Therapy. He knows it’s not a taboo anymore, that even a lot of completely functional people benefit from it and that many, in fact, practically consider it a privilege nowadays. But the word still evokes a negative response in him, his lips pressing into a tight line.
these are very common phrases obviously but I know nothing of this silly language so please correct me if I'm wrong
Steve opens his eyes as he hears steps from the corridor. He knows it’s Nat before the woman steps into the dark room and walks by the bed. She sits on the bed, setting her tablet aside, careful not to wake Emmett. Steve can tell from her sigh that there’s no news.
Yet, he’d be lying if he said that he looks forward to it.
Tony hurries the kids out the door, going with them to carry their overnight bag to the car, and Steve migrates back to the kitchen to get himself some of the french toast. Tony soon rejoins him, coming and wrapping his arms around Steve from behind. He leans his chin onto Steve’s shoulder.
Then it’s over.
”Steve.”
”I only said that because you’re still recovering –”
”Where?” he asks, squeezing Steve’s hip, not sure of what the tone of his touching should be.
When Steve felt the digit draw a line down the crack of his ass, he struggled to keep still, his breath turning short. Tony watched him, eyes fixed to his, and when the finger prodded against Steve’s rim, Steve let out the breath he’d been holding with a whine.
The doctor stops at the door.
Tony blinks, staring at him. He doesn’t really want to fight, but he doesn’t want pity either. So he does what he knows best and turns it into a joke.
They lay silently, basking in their closeness. Steve ends up massaging Tony’s prostate gently and Tony releases again inside of him at least twice, earning kisses to his forehead from the effort. By the time the knot finally subsides, Tony has turned completely into putty. Steve works him quickly ready again and then rides him slowly for almost two hours. They don’t talk much, just kiss and listen to each others breaths and moans. Neither of them cries anymore.
”Leave me alone”, he pleads in a strained voice. ”Please.”
Tony wanted to act humiliated, but it was just so incredibly hot that he couldn’t do anything but stare, his cock greedily begging for Steve’s attention. It didn’t help that Steve was making a show of it. But eventually, he lifted his head, looking at Tony.
been over a month since the last time. Tony’s body is acutely aware of these facts even with all the grief he carries with him now. Perhaps even more because of it – it’s no small comfort to be able to concentrate on something else for a while. Booze and fucking had always been Tony’s weapons of choice for escaping himself, after all. But this is not that, at least not just that. It’s the realisation that Steve is still here to touch him so softly like this that makes the sorrow fade into the distance in this moment.
”How are you feeling?” Thor asks, and Steve has to take a moment to gather his wit.
you, but you might lose your capability to conceive ever again. The other way – I can do that too, if you really are sure. But be aware that there’ll be a much higher chance of pregnancy than with a human, even with protection. Trust me, I’m speaking from experience.”
”No”, Steve says stubbornly. ”It’s just not gonna happen.”
Steve opens his eyes at the sensation of a gentle hand in his hair. Then another hand comes up to his face and removes the gag, leaving it loose around his neck. Steve licks his lips, the feeling of being free from the gag always weird at first. His mouth really doesn’t have to get used to being empty though, because Tony pushes his cock against his lips, and Steve opens his mouth eagerly, feeling like this way he has at least something to take his mind off of his own need.
Steve can see that Tony’s afraid of the answer despite his anger.
He shifts his body so that he’s able to bring his lips to Steve’s, to whom a kiss after the pain and teasing feels like life itself being breathed into him. Steve shivers, letting out a broken sound and parting his lips hopefully. Tony accepts the invitation and slips his tongue into Steve’s mouth.
”I know”, Tony answered resignedly, closing his eyes as he laid his hand to Steve’s cheek. ”I just want to keep my young and beautiful omega satisfied”, he added with the some amusement, but Steve didn’t laugh.
The twins vow to Steve to be on their best behaviour, and after smacking a kiss on both of their cheeks, Steve moves to give Tony his turn.
Steve feels a rush at Tony’s words, his cock twitching with interest. And he knows, he knows from Tony’s tone that he has been good, that he deserves this. When Tony’s fingers leave his mouth, Steve finally turns his eyes to him. Tony doesn’t notice, his focus on the fingers that he presses against Steve’s entrance. Steve takes the opportunity to savor the sight openly, the way Tony’s all focused on his body, how his mouth parts a little as he prods his finger inside.
”And when you… when you started talking about kids, I saw how much you wanted them. You were like a different person when you talked about it, and I wanted nothing more than to keep you happy. So, I – I decided to give you a child.”
Standing up calmly, Clint had left without saying a word, which had made Steve more than a little annoyed with Tony. They had been having a perfectly nice dinner. Tony’s eyes had followed Clint leaving over his shoulder briefly before he’d turned back to his meal, unaffected.
Steve’s heart fluttered at the softness in Tony’s voice. Years, and he was still so helplessly in love.
Steve hums, considering.
Thor doesn’t take his eyes off the TV.
“Pretty much”, he answers, and the reference doesn’t go unnoticed by Tony. He snorts, giving Steve’s hand a firm squeeze.
“I hope there’s nothing too spicy in here”, Steve had started, resting his hand on Tony’s shoulder, smiling faux-innocently and continuing before the delivery guy had a chance to open his mouth. “Daddy here has a sensitive stomach, and I think he’s not quite old enough for diapers ye-“
”’Late in life’”, Tony had gone on, immersed in his own genius thought process, then added quickly like he’d just invented electricity:”’Late bloomer’! Damn, that was way too slow.”
them”, Steve says to the silence suddenly. He just wants to make it clear, because Tony accusing him of that still hurts him. It simply wasn’t true.
Tony studies his face, trying to think of what to say. It’s not like it’s exactly an easy situation for him either, but he has to find courage for the both of them now.
”Can we switch positions?” the alpha asked after a moment. ”I want to kiss you.”
”It’s still Friday. You’ve been out for ten hours or so”, Thor says. Steve had assumed that he’s asleep, but evidently, he’s not.
”I’m sure Emmy could’ve slept at the dinner. It wasn’t a very loud gathering”, Nat tells, chagrined, and Steve feels sorry for her. She tries so hard.
Hey, don't-cha wanna dance with me baby, Whitney ponders, and Tony downs the rest of the scotch to his throat. But it’s not the only bottle of liquor he has in the workshop, not by a long shot. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.
”We can blame ourselves and each other for his death but it won’t change anything”, Steve says grimly, jiggling Emmett in his arms. ”Believe me, Tony, I get the appeal.”
”Aw, what a mess, sweetie”, Tony says, beginning to pull the strings off. Steve’s grateful to get rid of them, although most of the mess is actually on his stomach and the sheets since his cock had forced itself out of the tiny underwear.
”You do know I’m not gonna leave you for an omega that won’t blow like that?”
”How about shower?” he asks, praying that it won’t break this moment of peace they both need. Steve hums.
”Steve, I’ll go”, he says, turning to him. ”Call Happy and get the twins somewhere safe.”
”That’s sweet.”
“Tell me what you want”, Tony told him, his voice low and dirty and Steve just grinded his ass against him helplessly, moaning.
”No, I’m fucking disgusting”, Steve says like in trance, not really listening.
Tony has to take a second to stop himself from saying something he’s going to regret.
there would be any problems in Tony’s healing process, Steve wanted to know as soon as possible. Luckily, so far it seemed to be going well, at least if Tony’s frustration with it wasn’t taken into account.
Steve hummed again.
”It won’t hurt, I promise it won’t, I’m so – I’m so wet. I’m ready, Tony, please.”
Tony sighs heavily. ”I know”, he says. ”I know you did. I’m sorry for saying you didn’t.”
”Uh… a week ago? A bit more?” she says, then continues as Tony stands to leave: ”Will you be okay, Tony?”
”I know”, he said. ”You’re the alpha.”
”Never mind”, Tony muttered, then continued, fully aware that Steve would never let it go. ”You’ve never been hangover, right?”
”You’ll make a trail to the floor if you go on like that.”
. And some people have been beyond desperate to get a piece of that.
Tony understands well. Everything they feel is haunted by guilt and grief, be it good or bad, and there hasn’t been a lot of the former lately. Allowing themselves something good feels wrong, even if Tony recognises that it isn’t so. Remembering how they’d fought in this very bathroom in the spring, Tony’s just happy if Steve is able to show him how he feels. He wishes he were better at it himself.
Tony finds him in their bedroom, and before he has managed to gather up the strength to speak, Steve has sat on the bed, buried his face into his hands and started crying.
Steve’s chant dissolves into a moan as Tony leans closer, burying his cock deeper, and there’s a chant in Tony’s head too: mine, mine, mine.
”But that’s where you are wrong”, Steve counters, walking away from the desk. Tony’s eyes follow him. ”You don’t even realise how much I’ve concealed from you – we should’ve gone to therapy ages ago, before the twins –”
Steve sighs.
Steve’s blood turns cold. Tony could be anywhere, but the way Steve can’t feel anything through the bond is ominous. He tries to breathe, suddenly feeling like the armour is suffocating him. He stumbles out of it, his hands trembling as he fidgets with his own suit’s utility belt to get his phone.
”What’s that? You think that I’ve been an asshat too?” Steve jokes. ”What do you think, Emmy?”
For what feels like a long time, Steve just stares at him, and Tony can’t seem to stop himself from shivering. When Steve finally closes the space between them and wraps his arms around Tony, Tony has quickly pressed himself as close as possible just to get a grasp of reality by holding onto Steve.
”Tony”, Steve echoes, kissing his temple. Then he starts to kiss his way lower, to Tony’s ear and neck. Tony exposes his neck, letting his back fall towards the bed.
”Tony, Kieran –”
Steve looks at her. She’s got all her stuff, and it’s seven am. He knows she doesn’t live exactly in the neighbourhood and it looks like she hasn’t driven her own car.
Steve’s eyes flutter open. He looks at Emmett, petting his tummy lightly with his thumb.
He’s going into heat.
Steve smiles as much as he feels he’s able at the moment. They walk outside.
”Another noise and I’m unloading myself to your face and leaving you with nothing.”
”You make me so wet, alpha”, he said. ”So wet and so
Tony has tried, tried hard to think about it as rationally as possible, in the short time he’s had to consider it. But it just… no. Every cell in his body protests the mere idea. No way in hell.
”No”, Tony answers, and suddenly he really doesn’t sound like he is. ”No, I’m not.”
”No”, Tony says, his tone diplomatic. ”I just didn’t feel it at first. Do, now. Please, Steve, let’s not make a number of it.”
”I’ll be brought food here”, Steve says dismissively. It’s getting harder and harder to focus on the conversation.
, his instincts told him.
”See ya, soldier”, he says, giving Steve one final look before turning and vanishing through the circle with Strange and Bruce.
Thor lets go of him and seems to contemplate his next move for a second before pulling Steve into a hug. Steve would be unable to resist even if he wanted to, but he doesn’t want to. He buries his face into Thor’s hoodie, his sobs getting more and more loud.
”Tony”, Steve chides his language lamely, a lopsided smile creeping onto his own face too. ”But, yeah, what your father said.”
”Easy”, Tony says breathlessly, stilling Steve by gripping his hair. ”You’re gonna make me come if you do that.”
They take their bath, Tony saturating Steve with after-care even though he already feels like the most cared for person in the world. When they finally get to bed, Steve snuggles as close to Tony as possible, wrapping his arm over him.
Tony’s surprised at first, but when he thinks about it for a second, he does remember at least joking about it quite a few times... and now Steve thinks that he’s let him down.
Tony squeezes his arms tighter around Steve. Then he looks at him, and Steve’s expression is so vulnerable Tony could cry. He kisses Steve instead, and it’s just for comfort at first, but Steve seems somehow desperate, and Tony feels himself getting pulled into it, his hand coming up to frame Steve’s face. In some way, things feel a little off – Steve’s scent isn’t quite how it used to be, and Tony doesn’t feel like the person he used to be. Yet when Steve opens his mouth, shivering against Tony tensely, Tony slips his tongue into his mouth and does his best to let Steve know that there isn’t anything to be afraid of. It’s a lie, but what use is there for a truth that just hurts them?
The door comes down, and on the other side there’s Steve, crouched, holding the door that has fallen towards him. Tony freezes, stares at Steve who lowers the door to the floor carefully.
”No, she’s not. She’s really been a good friend, though.”
Thinking back to the conversation between them not two hours ago, Steve realises Tony’s right. He’s just promised him access to his thoughts and feelings.
”Steve”, Tony says gravely then, his armoured hands grabbing Steve by the shoulders. ”Thanos is there, outside. Bastard’s persistent, I’ll give him that.”
”I love you, too. Good night, honey.”
Then Tony’s hand wraps around his throat, pressing down slightly, and that’s infinitely better. Tony’s fingertips still caress his skin, but Steve can feel the pressure on his airway. He concentrates on that.
”What if it can’t be helped?” he asks. ”What if I’m just no good? What if you’ve made the biggest mistake of your life by choosing me? Maybe you should’ve never let me come back.”
Steve had suppressed a sigh, hoping that his brain would come up with an actual topic for them to talk about instead of listening to Tony’s nonsense.
”I believe you.” Steve runs his fingers through his hair. ”Listen, don’t talk to him about the heat and what happened. I’ll tell him when… I’ll tell him.”
”I know, sweetheart. I want to be inside you so bad”, he breathes in a low whisper. Tony knows dirty talk works on Steve like magic, so perhaps voicing his own need might make Steve relax and his body more pliant, make things move on quicker. He licks Steve’s neck, ghosting the skin with his teeth, then breathes into his ear. ”I want to bury my cock in you. Want to see you squirm and moan around it. I’ve missed it.”
”Stark”, Tony answered it, his voice collected and professional, and all the time he kept moving his hips and Steve was positive that he would lose his mind.
”I know, I know”, Tony reassured, holding onto Steve as he determinedly finished his task of rolling the omega onto his back. ”There we go”, he continued his mumbling as he settled between Steve’s legs tightly, no room for his intentions to be left unclear, quite literally.
His baby. Steve’s eyes, his hair. Little fingers and toes. None of those things show in the picture, but Tony can see them anyway, feel exactly how much Kieran had weighed in his arms. So little.
“You’d like to get this off, wouldn’t you?” he asks.
it’s something to worry about?” he asks, unable to completely mask the concern from his voice.
”I have never lied to you, by the way, about whatever I’ve used as my excuse for not staying, they’ve been real things. But I
”You work too hard”, Steve mumbled against his neck like he hadn’t even heard Tony. He reached for one of the hands on his ass and pulled it up for inspection. Just like Steve had guessed, there was dried black grease on Tony’s hand, smudging his index finger and thumb, originating from some machine Tony had been working on earlier today. Steve sucked the dirty index finger into his mouth.
he’s out there, you’re his alpha, he needs you, he might be hurt, protect him –
It feels pure despite the bittersweetness, and Tony thanks the universe for letting him keep this, letting him keep his heart even though it’s broken. He aches thinking about how much Steve has suffered and how his omega still has all of this tenderness left in him despite everything.
”FRIDAY, lock the master bedroom door, please”, he says then, getting up to his knees. He grabs Steve’s hips and pulls his ass up gently but firmly, Steve letting out a gasp against his pillow. His eyes are still closed, and Tony studies him as he rids himself quickly of his underwear.
Tony had found himself wanting to fix that loneliness and ended up getting fixed himself in the process. They always said you shouldn’t wait for someone else to fix you, or try to fix others with your love, but it had happened.
”Good”, Tony says again, framing his face with a hand and kissing him tenderly. ”Let go. Do that for me, baby.”
He tries to silence his mind, to stay rational, even though his every cell is screaming at him that he shouldn’t be touched like this. Softly.
”I won’t”, Steve says earnestly. He can’t give up. He will get Tony back, he has to believe that.
He half expects Tony to come up with another show to make him see something that he probably never will, but Tony just keeps staring at him, the corners of his eyes wrinkled in thought, his mouth pursed into an inexpressive line. Eventually, it starts to make Steve feel self-conscious, but he doesn’t dare to look away.
”Tony.”
Before going to bed, he sends Tony a message. ”I love you. Always.” is all that it says.
”He’ll be fine, Steve”, Bruce tells him. ”It’s mainly just malnutrition and stress.”
Finally, it stopped, but there wasn’t much opportunity for Tony to catch his breath or come to his senses, because Steve pushed him onto his stomach, a firm hand pressing between Tony’s shoulder blades. His thrusts didn’t stop for a second, the pace as ruthless as it were, and the overstimulation kept Tony crying out his moans, loud and unable to stop himself, ears red from the knowledge that his animalistic noises could probably be heard to the other side of the house.
”Not that good, as you can see”, Steve answers, trying to rub the tear stains off his face.
It’s pretty much the only thing that seems to be like it was when they were children. Or even like it was when they weren’t children anymore, when Steve had been changed by the serum, when they’d fought for ideals and not for their lives.
After they get to the medical bay, a lot of things happen. Tony’s put on an IV drip and his pupils, temperature and blood pressure are checked amongst other tests. He’s checked for injuries. Bruce and the two nurses they’ve got left bustle around Tony, and Steve stands in the side, following closely that they don’t overwhelm or hurt his alpha.
(See the end of the chapter for
He smiles sadly at Tony’s still figure on the bed.
Steve did, pushing his cock carefully back inside before leaning his weight onto his arms so that Tony wouldn’t get crushed under him.
Tony pulls him close and Steve buries his face into his chest, staining his shirt with his tears.
”Tony”, Steve pauses him gently, turning his gaze to him from Peter who seems a little overwhelmed. ”Let Peter answer.”
But Steve forces himself to take another look. He can’t go out there and present himself to Tony while feeling like he’ll die of embarrassment. Confidence is sexy, he reminds himself.
”Yeah, baby. I’m – I’m gonna fill you up.” Tony was close, his entire body
It takes a while, but eventually Steve’s mind starts to dull enough to the situation he’s looking at that his sobs die down and it starts to feel like there’s enough air again. The doctor’s words ring in his ears.
”Steve told me about what you had discussed here. Guess you could say that I didn’t take it very well. We had an argument and I felt like I needed some time alone. Sort of a, uh, ”clear-my-head” type of solution.”
Tony tries to touch his head, but is thrown off track when Steve reaches for the lever under the seat. The seat goes down with a surprised noise from Tony that Steve ignores, putting his focus back on the task at hand. His tongue tantalises Tony’s frenulum, then his lips close to kiss the head wetly before he sinks the whole thing back into his mouth.
”You’re beautiful”, he says earnestly.
As Steve tries to crawl onto the bed, he’s pulled down so that he ends up face against the mattress, and more importantly, over the knee on Tony’s lap. He inhales sharply, this time quite sure he’s guessing right what’s coming, and tries to relax despite the anticipation bubbling under his skin. How was this called a “punishment”, exactly?
”Don’t tell me that.” His voice is muffled from the way his face is nuzzled against Tony’s arm. He knows Tony’s been with others, of course he has. Steve even knows some of them, but he doesn’t want to hear a comparison of any kind to them, never has, not really even as a joke.
Steve relaxes his throat, and as Tony’s cock sinks deeper into his mouth, he closes his eyes, concentrates on breathing through his nose. Tony’s cock hits the back of his throat, again and again, and Steve can feel his eyes starting to water, his pulse rising, breathing becoming challenging. Before he can really start to feel much more than mild discomfort, though, Tony stops. He’s breathing hard, looking at Steve, quite obviously checking his state. Steve pulls a much-needed breath, but then closes his lips around Tony’s cock again, lifting his head to suck it deeper into his mouth again.
can see you so much better like this.”
It’s Steve - of course it’s Steve, it’s always fucking Steve. Something’s wrong with him, and the bond is picking at Tony’s nerves like it’s on fire, screaming at him, demanding his body to respond. Tony sips at his drink, his hand shaking.
”I… I wasn’t trying to”, he stammers. He’s lying, he has to be. ”I was just thinking about how much you like toast with orange marmalade.”
Fifteen minutes later they find themselves sitting in the communal kitchen.
Tony stands there for a while, watching, then goes to fetch another bottle, offering it to Emmett. Steve, completely taken by Kieran, doesn’t register much of what’s happening around him, not even as Kieran stops eating. He lifts him up against his shoulder, patting his back lightly, and closes his eyes, inhaling Kieran’s scent.
Thor’s aim had been to merely curse Steve with ’bad fertility’ for some time, but it’s clear that what he’s ended up doing is worse than that.
Steve entwines their fingers, licking a trail from the base of his cock to the tip, and Tony lets out a needy hum.
”No”, Steve answered softly. ”I’m saying that you’re a genius, and you have never needed anyone like that. But if, as you said, we do get to live old together, it’ll be my honour to change your diapers.”
Tony pushes some wild strands away from Steve’s face, giving his hair a final pet before quickening his movements, beginning to fuck his mouth more roughly. He holds the back of Steve’s head and brings force to his thrusts.
There’s that thrill again, yet Steve doesn’t know if he can do it. He’s mentally aroused, but he’s not sure if his body is on board with this as easily. He tries to think of something, but all of the thoughts just get him further from the present, disturb him. Soon, he finds himself starting to feel uneasy.
Tony hmph’d at him, but let his hands wrap around Steve again. It was silent for a moment.
”Love me”, Steve whispers. Tony’s brow knits for a second before his expression softens in understanding. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but nothing comes out. Steve’s hand travels down his body.
Steve knows who she’s talking about, but he doesn’t address it. They haven’t talked about it, even though Steve’s known for a while. He’d figured he’d be told properly when the people in question felt like it.
”No, I should’ve realised how drunk you were then. And I really didn’t think about the hangover at all. Sorry”, Steve said sheepishly, then continued with a twinkle in the eye. ”I’m all up for a comeback if you want, though. I’ll even call you daddy if you like.”
Mostly, though, it was just about the fact that Steve loved making his alpha feel good, and since he knew that it was something that Tony enjoyed, he was happy to provide. He often did it when he took Tony into his mouth, or when Tony was knotting him, and sometimes Tony would growl at him. At first Steve had got startled by it, but he’d learned that the inner battle with his alpha nature was something that Tony found exciting.
”My apologies”, FRIDAY responds. ”You specifically told me to leave the music on.”
Steve huffs, turning towards Tony. He can’t stop himself. ”Yeah, how
He took a sharp breath, laying a hand on Steve’s head, just to touch his hair absently. Steve made an affectionate sound of recognition, gripping the base of his cock with his hand and sucking the tip teasingly. Then he took as much into his mouth as he could and begun to move his head. He went slowly at first, took the time to roll his tongue around the sensitive frenulum softly, to pause to kiss Tony’s cock wetly a couple of times. Tony’s still recovering, alcohol-poisoned brain short-circuited at the sensations, and he couldn’t tell when the low, needy noises he was making had started.
“You’re here”, he says, trying to hide his sourness. He can understand wanting some time apart after everything that’s happened, but after the message on Saturday night, Tony hasn’t answered a single one of Steve’s texts, never-mind the few times he has tried to call. Even the gift stopped feeling good after Steve realised Tony wasn’t going to answer his thank you -message, or the picture of Emmett and Kieran sleeping nose to nose he sent, or any one of his attempts at contact. By Monday he’d gotten the message Tony didn’t have to send, and stopped trying.
Tony’s not giving himself enough credit, as always. Then again, pot meet kettle, Steve guesses when he thinks about it.
“See”, Tony starts. “This is what you don’t realise, Steve. To me, those eyes look pure. Innocent. Even when I see them looking up while my cock is slipping in and out of your pretty mouth, they look innocent. Do you have
”No”, Tony says strictly. ”Not like th-”
”Twelve point five percent probability of having lost all of you”, he explains, and Steve moves closer, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. Tony must’ve been through hell, living so long in all that uncertainty.
Her voice doesn’t sound very reassuring. Steve looks at her wildly, trying to comprehend what’s happening. Then he realises that the spot beside him is empty.
”More”, Tony muttered against the pillow, making Steve drop out of his thoughts and realize that he’d been at it for a while.
Fifteen minutes later they are sitting in a warm bath, Steve’s back leaned against Tony’s chest. Tony wraps his arms around Steve, pressing his face into his still dry hair.
“Okay”, Tony mutters then. “I think that’s it.”
Hearing the pain in Steve’s voice, Bucky wants to be able to reassure him that his alpha won’t leave him, but what does he know. Stark could be drafting the papers with his lawyers as they speak.
”I want it”, Steve grunts hastily. Tony’s grip tightens again.
”I – I can’t”, he tries, tears burning his eyes. ”Can’t help him, I –”
Steve doesn’t see that coming, but he knows instantly that Tony’s talking about the therapy again. His first reaction is anger. Then he thinks about how much he needs this.
It’s lucky that he hasn’t picked Emmett up yet, because he can’t guarantee that he wouldn’t have dropped him at the sight of the spaceship. And he knows, knows right away, because the bond is suddenly awake and makes Steve’s heart miss a beat.
to the caller. Steve had no idea what he was talking about but his confident, steady voice made Steve’s cock weep and he kept trying to keep his moans in check. Every muffled noise he made against Tony’s hand made Tony press it down twice as hardly.
”Alpha”, Steve croaks instantly. His voice is hardly audible, but his body becomes alive quickly as it senses the pheromones in the air.
”All right, honey. You know the rules”, Tony tells him tenderly.
When Tony pries Steve’s arm from his face, Steve opens his eyes reluctantly, aware that every broken piece of him can be seen on his face. But if Tony sees them, he doesn’t show it. He leans down and kisses Steve hard, his hand still around his throat. Steve can’t even think about how his stupid beard must be scratching Tony, his mind occupied by the sensation of Tony’s lips pressed demandingly against his.
Tony smiles at him, nodding subtly towards Peter and Kieran. Steve glances back over his shoulder, acknowledging the way Peter’s holding Kieran carefully like he’s afraid to even breathe with an amused look.
”So I can stay exactly here for at least twelve”, Steve said lazily, nuzzling his face against Tony.
Tony’s fingers are pressing into Steve’s leg forcefully and Steve’s eyes are shiny again and Tony can’t restrain himself. He pushes his cock past Steve’s rim carefully, locking his eyes with Steve who whines brokenly, quivering all over.
It’s infuriating. Steve knows that Tony knows that if he’ll promise something here, he’ll do it afterwards. They keep their promises, even if none of this is very orthodox.
”You, too. I’d call myself lucky, but…” he drifts off. He didn’t lose Steve, Emmett, Rhodey, Happy or Pepper. But he did lose Kieran and that’s more than enough.
”You’re good, Steve. You’re perfect for me”, he whispers. A little sound escapes Steve. ”Does it hurt?”
”That’s fucking hot”, he says huskily. Then he kisses Steve tenderly, the knot twitching inside of Steve slightly. Tony hums, nipping at the tip of Steve’s nose playfully after they part.
”Good. That’s good”, Tony reassures him, allowing his voice to soften a little. His other hand is still on Steve’s thigh, and he moves it closer to Steve’s crotch.
Tony’s hands stroked Steve’s sides.
Once again, Tony just hummed at him, smirking a bit. His free hand closed around Steve’s cock, pumping it slowly, and Steve let himself go again, let Tony continue taking care of him.
”I have read your contract and signed it. But it wasn’t really needed – your state does not affect me and I’m more than capable of overpowering you physically if I have to”, Thor tells him simply, and his voice does not falter for a single syllable, no colour rises to his cheeks.
Obediently, Tony shuffles to the bed, his belt clanking loudly against the wooden floor as he drops his jeans next to his side of the bed. Grimacing at the sound, he lies down as discreetly as possible. He still wants to move closer to Steve and cuddle him, but he doesn’t dare, afraid of Steve’s reaction. He’s not sensing any hostility through the bond, but the bond doesn’t always tell everything. It would be inconvenient for mates to be able to know every time their partner was even mildly dissatisfied with them.
But his recovery had, in fact, been nearly miraculously fast so far. After he’d woken up, he’d sometimes had trouble remembering words, but lately there had been almost no instances of that anymore. Walking had come back to him in a mere couple of days and he had only small problems even with fine motor skills. It was true that the alpha usually ended up nodding off on the sofa at some point of the day, but at least part of it was due to the painkillers.
But of course Tony’s not going to do that. He pushes his chair back, standing up, and Steve looks at him, realising the effect his words have had.
Tony laced the fingers of his uninjured hand with the one Steve had snaked under his head and smiled.
”Has he – has he read the contract?” he asks Nat.
”Yeah.”
”Alpha”, he pleaded, submissively switching to words. ”Please, you need to –”
But Tony just positions himself, his cock poking at Steve as he finally turns his eyes to him.
”Perfect. Just like daddy said you would be.”
”I’m sorry, honey”, he says, conciliatory but not hiding it from his voice that his patience has been worn thin. Steve can’t blame him, but it’s still upsetting. Somehow he doesn’t know what to answer, even though it should be self-evident.
” he whispers in alarm. Steve moves his hand away from his face.
One Friday, Steve is telling the therapist about the time when they were repairing their relationship, about how afraid he’d been that Tony could never forgive him, when the therapist pauses him. There’s no sign of the avalanche that’ll follow.
Steve watches dizzily, trying to get up to help.
”, Steve mutters dreamily. They’ve known that it’s two boys for three days.
Tony stared at him and honestly, he looked tired, but Steve still didn’t want to turn him down. First of all, Steve wanted to have sex with him, but more importantly, he didn’t want Tony to feel rejected when his injury was already eating away his confidence. He figured that if Tony’d run out of steam they could always just stop and continue at another time.
Tony leaves the room in Bucky’s wake, leaving Steve free to curl up on the sofa and stare into the distance. He’s too tired to scream but he really, really wants to as he reflects on his own behaviour. At this rate, Tony is going to leave him. He’ll take the kids Steve isn’t able to love properly and leave him. Omegas’ rights to the children in case of bond break were much better today, but Steve is practically a criminal without Tony. He might not get any rights to the twins, at least not for a long time.
”Yours”, Tony rasps, and Steve didn’t even ask it but he wants to hear it again, so he bites his jaw, working the muscles inside of him to create as much pressure on Tony’s cock as possible. He wants his seed inside him, needs it.
“Thanks”, he muttered, lying back down to his side and closing his eyes again in the hopes that he hadn’t lost the sleep. Steve didn’t answer, but Tony felt the bed shift as Steve lied down next to him. Tony was just starting to think that it was a little uncharacteristic of Steve to come back to bed once he’d already got up, when he felt a touch on his neck. Ah.
”Do you think you could take a bit more?” Tony asks him, and despite it being a question, Tony’s voice is too sweet to even consider saying no to.
”The love of my life, Steve”, he corrects simply. Steve’s shoulders turn stiff.
Steve laughed again, and Tony patted the hand resting on his chest. “Come on, be nice to daddy.”
”What? What’s absurd?”
”Tony”, he breathes out, the slight relief from hearing Tony’s voice disappearing quickly when he registers the connection starting to go weak. It isn’t difficult to put two and two together.
”Well”, he starts earnestly. ”You’re not a an idiot at all. You’re wonderful.”
Steve swallows. He doesn’t want to talk about it. ”I know.”
”Like Tony leaving me.”
”Thank you”, Nat says, smiling in her small way.
With a tight grunt, Tony forced himself apart from Steve and back to the sitting position, his hands finding Steve’s waist again. Suddenly, it was him for whom the world was getting out of control, but it didn’t matter. Steve had closed his eyes again, his freed hands gripping the sheets and his pillow, and he was magnificent.
It’s nearly morning when he finally falls asleep. His sleep lasts for whole two hours until FRIDAY wakes him up and informs that the babysitter has arrived. She hasn’t been needed much at all lately, but apparently Tony has called her to be here to help now that he himself is wherever he is.
Steve pretends to pout. Tony pokes his pushed out lip with a finger and Steve retracts it with a faux-stern face, then smiles, his eyes wrinkling.
Tony began to slowly move his hips, and what he saw was the perfection of Steve’s plush lips as they parted into a moan. He saw the way Steve’s stupidly long, gorgeous eyelashes fluttered from pleasure, and his hips jerked.
”I know”, he says, starting to wet Steve’s hair with his hands, watching how the water makes it look darker. Steve leans into the touch, and Tony is grateful to just share some silence with him. The bathroom is lit softly, and it makes the world feel a little less unforgiving of a place for a change.
Mewling at the sensation of the knot swelling inside of him Steve strokes himself until all he can think about is
It was late, the TV that was on in the background the only source of light in the living room. Steve had managed to get the boys to sleep an hour ago, after which he’d figured that Tony needed the rest and taken a bit of time just for himself before coming to wake him up.
”Yeah”, Steve agrees, his eyes closing. ”Yeah, I know. It’s just…” Steve lets out a noise that could be either a bitter laugh or a sigh. ”Guess you’re never ready for it when someone does really die.”
”This is exactly what I mean”, he says then, grabbing Steve’s jaw again and turning his eyes back to the mirror.
Later Steve had admitted that a part of him had wanted to test Tony when they’d met, and Tony had laughed, endeared. That was before Steve had actually betrayed his trust out of loyalty to
”Yeah, but see, now you’ll have to come and try, otherwise this’ll haunt Steve for the rest of his life”, Tony fuels him. Steve shakes his head, a lopsided smile on his face.
”Does it hurt?”
”Why?” Steve asks, pulling his hand away. He doesn’t sound pleased, and Tony gets it. Funerals are painful. Others had held funerals or memorials after the snap, but many hadn’t. Steve had only told Tony that he hadn’t felt like he could do it without him, and after that they haven’t talked about it.
