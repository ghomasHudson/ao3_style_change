“I skimmed,” Pepper admitted. “But the thing is, it’s not addressed to just Anthony Stark of Stark Industries. They want your opinion as Iron Man of the Avengers, to.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve breathed, wide eyed and confused as he looked around. All around him were strange tall buildings, taller then even the Tower, and all covered in bright lights. “I don’t… I don’t know how I got here.”
“Dr. Conners?” Gwen asks, blinking in surprise. “You mean Curtis Connors? I red one of his papers. It was really, really cool.”
“So,” his Dad said as Peter was settling into bed. He knew he was to old for it now, but Peter loved it when his Dad tucked him in and it was only on special occasions now. “Was the day as great as you had dreamed?”
“Nothings happening,” Steve said as Tony drove to wherever they were going. “I mean, the streets are pretty stuffed up, but there's nothing bad happening.”
“It would be best analyzed in the Lab. Take it there and I with run a scan of it. Should I contact the Boss?”
After accidentally creating a death bot, Tony had spent much to long not sleeping to track the sucker down. Then, he found out that Ultron was gathering vibranium, and had to make the shittiest call ever to T’Chaka, who he’d met only a few times, when the Wakandans were trying to hunt down Klaue before. And talking to the Wakandan king was an absolute shit storm, and it sucked.
It had started like any other. He woke up, left whatever woman he had had in his bed the night before to go start working in his lab. And there he stayed, for a good many hours with only Dummy and Jarvis and the other bots as his companions. Pepper came by, talked to him for a bit, wanting paperwork like always.
“This is how it's going to be, Pepper,” Tony snapped, then turned, guilty, to go back to his workshop. “Jarvis will take care of everything else.”
Eventually they got to a large room where they were looking at a drone of some kind that Oscorp had developed. Dr. Connors was actually there to explain what it did, and why they had made it. It was sort of a substitute Iron Man and Captain America mash-up, and only a prototype, but Peter didn’t like it. Nothing good came from trying to remake the Super Soldier serum and nothing good came from trying to remake the Iron Man armor. Dr. Connors and Oscorp were on a dangerous path.
They were cleaning up the streets, slowly working their way through Queens, and getting everything into some sense of order.
Peter ran a hand over his face, trying to wake up. What was going on? Why was his dad calling about something like that?
And with that, Friday went silent as she refocused on his Dad. He didn’t mind, though, and just went down to work in his mini lab, doing tests on the strange goop. He also took scans of his body, to see if anything else changed. There was, oddly, a small sack of time kind in his arms, just where the goop had come out of his wrists, and of course the small spider like hairs on his arms and feel. For whatever reason, his weight had also gone up. Not into overweight range, but into a more stable weight then his somewhat undersized one. And from what he could see, it was because his muscle mass had been raised quite a bit.
There was the sound of a revving bike, and Steve opened his eyes to find that Deadpool’s prisoner had escaped. Damn, that guy had some pain tolerance… Steve definitely couldn’t ride a bike right after pulling a sword out of his own shoulder. The guy definitely wasn’t human. They should probably go after him.
For a minute, Tony wanted to argue. He did. But he knew that Wade was right. He had to be the one to tell Peter. It had to be from Wade. Otherwise, it would only hurt Peter. So he pulled up to Weasel’s shop and let Wade, before heading home to start preparing for the worst.
When he crashed, he climbed his way out of the suit, and began to walk. He walked for hours, hoping to find help, or shade, or for help to find him. And when Rhodey flew overhead with a helicopter, Tony fell to his knees, screaming with joy.
“What?” Bob and Weasel say together, and Wade only giggles. Oh, New York was going to be so much fun.
The two then went to the edge of the helicarrier, and Peter turned his attention to the ristrainsts. They had only strapped down his wrists and upper torso. It was more then amatur kidnappers did, but less then some others had tried. If he had his backpack, he could activate the legs to get out, but he didn’t. Giving the restraints an experimental tug, Peter realized that they were a lot stronger then most.
It didn't matter what they could have done. Everyone made mistakes, and there was no point worrying about fixing it. All that mattered was moving forward, toward the future, and working for a better tomorrow.
It took Tony a while to find information on Peter's mother. Nearly a year, actually, thanks to all the dates with Steve, teammates birthdays, holidays, and other special occasions. It took nearly a year, to find out everything he could about Peter's mother.
Sucking in breath, Tony choked back a sob. “You’re going be so amazing, both of you, no matter what you do. And you need to know that, no matter what you do, I’ll be proud of you. I wish I could be there to see you both grow up, but I can’t. I won’t be able to make it. But if Steve, if your dad, succeeds, you’ll at least get your big brother back. Peter- Pete will make sure you know just how special you both really are.
And, with that, Tony left his first and only child in the hands of someone else. That was his first, and most unforgivable, mistake.
Peter watched as Bucky got up, heading for the elevator. So… His uncle had something on his mind… Wanted to get out and explore the world… Peter honestly couldn’t fault him for that, but he was really, really going to miss him. He was probably Peter’s favorite uncle. Who was he kidding, he was Peter’s favorite uncle. Sure, Clint used to take him to do dangerous things, and Phil had been around for, like, ever, and Thor and Bruce left, so Peter guessed he had a little bit of a grudge, but Bucky was totally his favorite. Sorry, Sam!
Getting into her house, a little place out in the country, was also far to easy. The house was remote, so no one was around to see him going to the door. It was unlocked, and Wade couldn't help but chuckle. Clearly the wolf wasn't hiding. She was expecting him, and left her den open for him. This was going to be too easy.
Mrs. Warren told them they'd set up their beds first, and then they would do an activity to get to know each other. Peter glanced at the other three students, and unrolled his sleeping bag. He set his backpack at the foot of the fluffy bag, and opened it up to pull his ‘toiletry’ box out to put by the head of his bed. He was wearing glasses, not that he really needed them, they were just part of the ‘Peter Parker’ disguise. He'd put them in the box with his phone and the emergency pocket repulser his dad invented just for this when he went to sleep at night.
“Tony,” his best friend said once Tony answered. “This had better be important. And not ‘my son is gone and I'm having separation anxiety’ important.”
As Steve moved to stand before his table, which now included Pietro and Wanda, who were sort of just there to hang out with Clint, they all looked up at him expectantly. Clearly, they’d been filling Wanda and Pietro in on what was happening.
His group went to the Tower first, starting the week off pretty great. Peter already knew everything, but it was pretty cool to get the same tour as everyone else. To see the Tower the way his group mates did instead of as someone who lived there.
All around, white walls, while ceiling, while curtains, white tile, white sheets. Really, everything was white. Which was probably the first clue Tony had that he was in a hospital. The second was probably the faint beep of a heart monitor somewhere to his right.
Peter sighed, running a hand over his face. God, his parents were so embarrassing… But they were his family, and he wouldn't change that for anything.
Eventually, Tony got Peter to go sit on the couch, to wait, while he got the suit off. It was hard, getting the suit off, and Peter was giggling as the bots tugged at the pieces.
For a moment, Friday didn’t respond. Then, voice very stern, she spoke. “It is a matter of grave importance. I believe it would be best to see him now. I will send him to the lab.”
“Don’t worry, Pep,” Tony assured, heading to follow Peter into the elevator. “I’ll get right on it when we get back from dinner.”
“Tones,” Rhodey interrupted. “I get that you need someone to talk to, but unless Pep tells me that we should talk, I have to get back to work. I'll call you later.”
He car, of course ran him over, and Stane attacked him with a motorcycle. Then literally stomped on his chest and threw him into bus. For extra measure, Stane even blew it up with a missile. He managed to right himself, after the blast, power getting lower, and hovered. Stane lifted up, his own suit able to fly. Tony didn’t appreciate Jarvis snark, and rose to maximum altitude.
“I can’t believe I’m doing this,” Wade says as he hurried down the block. “Is there a word for half afraid, half angry? I mean, my Petey boy can hold his own, he’s the son of fucking Captain America and Iron Man, but against Francis? Who might use me somehow to draw him out? Oh god, I don’t know what to do!”
She trailed off, her free hand reaching down to shuffle notebooks around on her desk. Without caution, she tosses a few to the floor. Wade would shoot her, but if she was telling the truth, if she was going to fix everything, then he didn't want to miss the chance to be reunited with Peter.
“8:17 in the evening, Sir,” Jarvis supplied from above their heads. Barnes jumped. “You started at approximately 3 in the afternoon yesterday. Young Master Peter visited you in your shop twice whilst you were working. Once before leaving for his private lessons and again a few hours ago when he returned.”
Obadiah said nothing for a moment, simply looking away. Then, he turned, looking out at the sea of reporters.
Putting his head back against the console, tears stinging at the corners of his eyes, Tony sucked in a shaky breath. “Johnny, Susan… I’m so sorry I won’t be there to watch you grow up. I don’t know if you made it, if only one of you, or both of you, made it. But you have to know how much I love you. And I know, no matter what happens, you’ll do great things. Susan, already I can tell that you’re going to be so smart. Some day, I’m sure you’ll be taking my place, making all this revolutionary tech that I can’t even dream off. And Johnny, god… You’re nothing like your sister, but you’re amazing all the same. I bet… I bet you’ll be some kind of star. You look so much like Steve, but I know you’ll take after me. You’ll be charismatic, a shining star athlete, or actor, or racer, or whatever you want. And I just want you both to know that I love you both so much.”
“Not exactly,” Peter hummed, adjusting his glasses. “But I heard that your dad has a division dedicated to bio-chem tech. Stark Industries doesn’t really do much of that.”
It had been nearly 3 months since their original date night, and they still hadn't gone on that date. He was starting think they never would. With villains and meetings and the team gathering for ‘team bonding time’, they never had a moment alone with each other. It was maddening.
“Two weeks?” Even with his eyes closed, Tony could tell that she was crying. “But Tony… That’s… It’s going to fast! At this rate, you’ll-”
Wade turned to look around, his hood up around his face. He looked at the people sitting down, and the people in the food lines. Just as he raked his eyes over the food area, he saw him. Peter, sitting with his friends and eating nachos as they pulled on protective gear. Wade stared, feeling a wave of relief wash over him. He was just as beautiful as the last time Wade had seen him, with those big brown eyes, messy but perfect head of fluffy brown locks, and looking so small in Wade’s old hoodie.
For a second, the doctor shot Tony a glance, but sighed and finally start talking. “Well, it’s… your liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. Tumors. You have cancer, son.”
The first thing he had to work on, was the flight capabilities. He built the boots, heavy but movable, first. The first model was done by the time they broke for lunch, and Tony managed to make PB and J for lunch.
“I know,” Tony groaned again as the got closer, finding Deadpool leaning over a guy who was pinned to the bridge with one of the swords. “I’ll fix it. I will.”
Taking another deep breath to calm himself, Steve took the hand. He was going to take a long, long shower, and maybe got for a run. Or maybe he could just go to the gym and let his anger out on a bag. That sounded nice…
Tony heaved a sigh as he sat in his lab, rubbing his temples. He was rewatching the footage of what had happened in the cells, hours before, for the umpteenth time.
Peter sat on a roof, stretching as he looked around at the quiet streets bellow. It had been almost a year since… the incident, and Peter was finally feeling back to normal. Well, as normal as he could. He was still hurt, and he still loved Wade, even though he was gone, but maybe in a few years he could move on.
Peter took a seat, leaning his head back for a moment as it began to throb heavily behind his eyelids. God, he hated feeling like this…
“We’re sorry for barging in,” Steve cut in. “We just need a few days to figure out what to do next.”
They both knew that it was probably more then just a temporary babysitting, and he took off, heading for Stark Industries factories. He couldn’t stand waiting, and he eventually asked Jarvis.
“Mr. Stark!” Deadpool cheered, jumping up and turning to look at them. “Oooh, and Captain Frowny-Face to!”
As he went back to the sitting room, looking for more pizza and wondering about Pepper, the phone rang. He was tired, after such a long day, and walked slow, picking up a few pillows before he found it. Pepper calling… He answered, sitting down.
Wade scoffed, pulling the hammer of his pistol back with a sneer. "Don't play dumb! And put your hands up!"
He let out a sigh of relief when he saw Steve helping Peter out of the shit box. With a wide grin, he raised his hand, waving wildly to get their attention.
Like the champ she was, Pepper took deep breaths, reaching in to attach it to the base plate as he started to feel dizzy. And, just like that, he was back to life, giving a shout of surprise. Pepper jumped, though she thankfully didn’t yank out the reactor, and slid it into place. He laughed, watching her as she stared at her plasma covered hands.
“I’m sorry I didn’t give you a heads up,” Tony said, turning to walk towards the exit. “But if I had-”
What were your guys favorite parts? And what were your least favorite? Tell me in the comments, I want to KNOW!
He supposed that was a good thing, though. If he ever did get close enough to touch Peter, Wade would probably grab him and just… stay there. Never letting go, and never moving.
Tony laughed with him, grinning as he wrapped his arms around Steve’s shoulders. Everything just felt so right in this moment. Sure, the Ultron experiment failed, but he had
When they finally pulled apart, Steve hummed and smiled. “I'm very interested in you, Tony. I have been for a very long time.”
Once he was safely tucked away in his room, Peter layed down in his bed, staring up the ceiling for a minute before turning on his side and reaching over to his bedside table. Opening the drawer, he pulled out the framed picture that he had taken on the balcony the last time he saw Wade. He used to keep it on the table, but Gwen saw it once and said it wasn’t healthy for him to be clinging to the past… Peter had told her that he would put it in the box on the top shelf of his closet, with the rest of Wade’s things that he couldn’t find an excuse to keep, but he just couldn’t bring himself to…
With a sigh, Wade closed his eyes as he layed back on the bed. He was ready for a time jump. Really, at this point, he didn’t care about what he did while off the page. Wade just needed things to move a little faster. Maybe if they did, he could finally rejoin with Peter…
The day before, when Tony had returned, Steve had been so overjoyed, he had wanted to kiss him. But it had been so long, and Tony had just gotten back… He had known Tony had been in a vulnerable state, and he hadn't wanted to take advantage of that.
He fell, slowly, thanks to emergency power, and thrusters jumping in and out. Eventually, he stumbled into a land on the roof, calling Pepper again.
“I’m fine,” he managed to slur, one hand holding Peter and the other grabbing Rhodey’s sleeve. “Where’s Pepper?”
For a split second, he was free falling, the air pushing up against him as he flailed and tried to reposition himself. Then, he finally managed to aim his wrist, shooting a web just in time to fling himself back up. He shot another wet, turning back to the smashed window where his aunt was standing at the edge, Connors hissing as he advanced.
“No, no,” Tony said, glancing at the timer Friday had set up for estimated time. Peter would be leaving his room any second now. “You’re fine. You’re the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I’ve ever met. You’re gonna do great. Is it too much to of a problem to ask? Cause I’m sure Pete would-”
When Natasha turned to start back toward the Tower, Steve moved to follow her. Still, he paused at the front gate to give the mansion one last look. He’d focus on his task at hand, getting New York under control, until more could be done to get everything in order or fix what Thanos did. Who knows, maybe Wilson was already hunting Thanos, and would call them when he found the bastard. Wishful thinking, but still.
“Alright everyone,” one of the teachers called, clapping his hands together. “We're going to head for the gymnasium now, and then split into groups. Three groups of three and three groups of four.”
Tony was mostly helping him with gear. His katana specially made, the suit that was like a World War Two Captain America uniform with a red and black Spiderman color scheme. Seriously, Wade loved it. But he was worried about the tension that helping him would cause back home. After all, Tony hadn’t told Steve about who Deadpool is, and definitely didn’t tell Peter. Though, to be honest, when this was all over, Wade wanted no one to know he was Deadpool. He was probably already going to be on Steve’s shitlist again, and Peter would probably hate him a million times more if he ever found out. He didn’t need it getting any worse.
But anyways, now Steve knows he has a problem on his hands and he also knows that Tony is probably aware of said problem. So Steve really hopes this internship Howard won’t let him forget about pays as much as Howard makes it seem because he has
They stay like that for hours. Eventually one or both of their stomachs growl and they have to get up to eat. The mood stays somber but Steve is able to go until bedtime without bursting into a sob again, so he’s calling that a win.
“I see,” Jarvis said, “I can offer you a temporary solution, but this will be a common occurrence so we may want to take a shopping trip in the near future. For now though, follow me.”
“You don’t have to eat, but I brought this in case getting up was what was holding you back,” he explains as he crawls back in, reclaiming his spot.
Tony’s face seemed pleasantly surprised as he flipped through. He must not have gone all the way through it, because he didn’t burst into laughter or give any other sign that he’d seen the portrait of himself. Instead, he nodded his head, said, “I’m no art critic, but I’d say you’re pretty talented,” and wandered off, sipping his smoothie.
Steve, now with his feathers in a rumple, because how could Tony be so obtuse, finally entered his classroom with a frustrated sigh. The last thing he needed this time of year was Tony rubbing in his face how much the school cared for the track team. Sure, if he had a face like that he might be able to get his way all the time too. Steve had been practically begging the school board for pottery stations that actually worked. He’d even thought he had a chance this year but then in the January meeting Tony had waltzed right in, pitched his stupid plea with his stupid face for his golden track stars to get new golden uniforms and he’d lost all hope immediately. He didn’t know what Millikan’s oil drop experiment was, but he’d guess it wasn’t cheap either. Where the hell was the funding for that coming?
Jackie laughed. Now Steve was confused. “No, Mr. Rogers, I’m serious. We joke with each other. His class is actually my favorite class. It’s a grand old time. You should stop by sometime. Is this about what I said last week? Because, really, I give it right back to him. Plus, you know how I love attention. Thank you for looking out for me though, Rogers.” With that, she patted his arm and went back to her seat.
After an eternity, Steve’s senses return to him and he realizes it’s Tony holding him and that at some point they must have moved to the couch. Tony is stroking his back lightly as Steve hunches over with his head in his hands.
Tony put his hand around Steve and pulled him closer. Steve now had his face hidden in Tony’s neck. He kept it there for the majority of the film to avoid seeing the gross or scary parts, but he suspects he might’ve found an excuse to keep it there even if the rest of the movie had been about puppies.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck as he laughed. “Yeah, well, I was using my anatomy studies as an excuse, and I was in quite a bit of denial for the better part a week, so… yeah, you’re shirtless in a few.” Then his eyes widened. “Actually, maybe stop flipping now, there might be something more graphic in there from Monday. Monday was… especially tough.” Steve said as he lunged for the notebook.
Steve continued to spend as much time as he could with his mom. Some nights when he couldn’t sleep he would sneak out of the large house and drive down to see her. The receptionist always let him in. He tried and failed not to think about the implications of the bent rule.
“Nice shirt,” he said to Steve, quiet enough that only they could hear it. The rest of the table was engrossed in conversation about something, but Steve had gotten lost minutes ago.
Or, well, he was about to. But then they both heard the door open. They both turned their heads and Jackie was standing there, jaw dropped almost to the floor. “That’s not what I meant when I said talk to him!” she squealed. “But I’ll just go ahead and leave you two alone. It wasn’t important anyways. Coach Stark, I’ll see you at practice later.” She all but ran out of the room after that.
Speak of the devil and he will taunt you outside your own classroom, Steve thought to himself. He was pretty sure the cocky, son of a bitch had no self-awareness.
“Your shoulders might be a little broad, but I think we can make this one work,” he told him, holding out the hanger to Steve.
It must be more serious than he thought. “Jackie, you don’t have to put up with his teasing just because he’s a teacher. I would back you up on this if it became a bigger issue.”
The movie was actually pretty good. Steve found himself fully invested in the emotions of the characters. It was a little bit action and a little bit drama. At one point there was a jump scare and he almost spilled the popcorn. Tony snickered and reached over for a handful. Steve ended up handing him the whole bowl a few minutes later. He’d had more than enough and didn’t want a repeat embarrassment.
Tony narrowed his eyes and pointed his pen at Steve. “Nuh uh. I know how this one goes. No insults today; I mean it, Steve. Not today,” he said.
“Please, Mr. Stark, I don’t want to let him down.” That sounded suspiciously like Jackie, but it wasn’t near time for her to be at school yet.
Jarvis led him towards Tony’s room. Steve mentally crossed his fingers that he wouldn’t be in there.
Jarvis had been very helpful when he’d moved in. Steve felt comfortable asking him if he might be able to set him up with something he could wear tonight. Steve, Tony, and Jarvis all had rooms in the same hallway, which had come to annoy Steve immensely in the few nights he’d already spent here. Tony had a habit of bringing girls over, which was fine.
make Steve feel better about his mother working there. The place was huge; a reminder of everything they didn’t have. Their son, Tony, was a spoiled brat. He was late to dinner without so much as an apology. To top it all off, they didn’t seem at all grateful that his mother spent day in and day out cleaning up after them, cooking for them, and whatever else they asked of her.
Steve furrowed his brow. That didn’t sound very nice of Tony. Steve might be a bit biased when it comes to Jackie, and even more biased when it comes to Tony Stark, but he couldn’t imagine having the gall to taunt a student like that in front of a class. “Well that wasn’t very nice of him,” he said back.
Tony’s lips quirked up. “Well, how am I supposed to stay mad with you looking at me like that. Sure. Forgiven. Tell your conscience to stop bothering you. You’re fine.” He was still looking in Steve’s eyes.
Steve couldn’t believe his ears. That was a lot of information to take in. And he needed to move because he was pretty sure one or both of them were going to come around the corner at any moment. Tony likes his biceps? Wait, no, not important. Tony handling Jackie in a panic? Super sexy. Good, dad-like behavior. Wait, no, what? Tony’s not dad-like? He’s mean and –
He was crawling into bed when he heard a knock on his door. Cursing the fact that he was no longer about to get cozy in his comforter, he walked over and opened the door. It was Tony.
that was a bad idea. Holding his breath, he prayed Tony would get bored before he got to the last page. Anything else in the book wasn’t nearly as incriminating, unless you counted the numerous sketches of his ma. Even Tony didn’t have the heart to make fun of him for that right now, he figured.
Tony looked up with glee as he stiff armed Steve and turned away from him. “OH really? Rogers, you? It must be Christmas,” he giggled. Then the bell rang and he straightened. “Okay, lucky for you, I don’t want us to get fired over some nudity you angst-drew but rest assured this conversation will be continuing later.
Sighing, he went to his room to mentally prepare for the embarrassment that was sure to be tonight. It had been awkward enough when he was a visitor. At least then it was okay that he stood out. Now he’d have to act as if he belonged here. He halfway understood why Tony was late last time. He may be spoiled but that probably didn’t make formal dinners any easier to stomach.
“Hey, sorry to bother you so late..” he trailed off, eyes running over Steve and likely taking in his pajamas, which consisted of boxers and a white t-shirt, “I just thought maybe you’d want to watch a movie or something.” After a few seconds of silence he added, “Or, it’s cool if you’re tired or whatever.”
“I’ve been trying to get Steve here to come out to the labs. I thought we could show him around and maybe set him up with an internship for the summer,” he said, smiling widely at Steve.
“Really, I can’t thank you enough for talking to Yuni. I don’t know what you must have said to him. He’s usually so stubborn when I need time off,” Steve said to fill the silence. He wasn’t sure about how he felt about her intervention, but it was nice to relax with his mom while it was still light out today.
“Shhh.. I know. I know,” they say in his ear. They rock him back and forth and keep whispering in his ear, “You’re okay. I’ve got you.”
Finally, the movie wrapped itself up in a bow. As the last few scenes of the resolution played out, Steve realized he didn’t want it to be over. The contact was really nice and would miss the warmth.
Steve turned back to Tony, an easy smile on his face. But then he glanced down and saw the corner of a sketchpad thrown in the trash. He reached in to grab it out while Tony protested.
Days later, on his way to the teacher’s lounge, Steve was still pondering the Tony conundrum. It was personal then? He just didn’t like Steve? Or, he just didn’t like art? He hadn’t been around to poke fun at Steve recently and Steve wondered what had changed. A couple voices tore him out of his thoughts.
“Jackie, Jack, honey, it’s gonna be okay. I swear, the worst-case scenario is some teacher you’ll barely remember when you’re 30 has a bad opinion of your high school self. And that’s the worst. It’s not likely at all. Just calm down for a second, Andy Sachs, no one’s getting fired.” That must have been Tony talking back to her.
He heard footsteps approaching and he snapped his book shut. He’s not really sure why he did that, except that maybe anything to do with his mother felt overly personal for anyone to see in passing. Tony entered the room and eyed the sketchbook with Steve’s hand still holding it shut.
Mr. Stark had just asked Steve what he wanted to do after he graduated high school. Steve stumbled through his prepared, “not sure yet, just want to support mom,” speech.
Scoffing, Tony said, “Take a chill pill Rogers, I’m not into plagiarism,” and continued into the kitchen.
“Oh, yeah, the team is excited for our first meet this year,” he said while looking around at the various posters. “Gives everyone a bit of a boost, ya know? But don’t worry, Rogers, I’m sure your kids are excited too. What do you guys have this time of year? That weird assignment with all the feet? Anyways, I’ll see you at lunch, I’ve got to go set up for class. We’re starting electrostatics this week and I want to demonstrate Millikan’s oil drop experiment to get the kids excited.” He patted Steve on the shoulder and left in a hurry.
Howard gave Tony a harsh look and said, “Tony. Be polite.” Then he turned back to Steve and continued, “Well sport, if you change your mind, you have your mother let me know. I’m sure I can find you something.”
But the same thing was happening to his phone. It was stuck to his hand, not coming off, and Peter started to freak out. What the hell was going on?!
“I’ll see you inside,” he said quickly, Peter reaching up to take his hand instead as they started to walk away from Obie.
They went inside, people muttering around them as they do so. Once they were in the conference hall, reporters went crazy, shouting questions. Obie went to stand behind the podium, but Tony went and as on the floor in front of it, Peter on his knee.
And then, there were feet on the stairs, two sets. One big with boots, one small with slippers. Tony managed to turn just as they saw him, Peter screaming and running to him without caution for the shards of glass still around the broken windows. God, he needed to fix that… Peter could get hurt.
Peter had taken it all, read it, imagined her, and had asked Tony if he could go to public school for high school. He wanted to experience things with way his mother had, as a normal kid without a parent instead of
While he hadn’t had time to think about it during the whole Hydra thing, he’d met a lot of people and learned a lot about himself and this new world. With the easy to use phone Tony had made sure he had, he’d started using social media, posting his photos and chatting with people from all around. He’d met people on the road, too.
“Yeah. Speaking of funny, we got a weapons depot that was just blown up just a few clicks from where you were being held captive.”
So he started with Jarvis. He wrote updates, rewrote protocols and got Jarvis ready for when he’d be gone. He spent so many hours in the lab, trying to keep his mind away from Steve to keep from aggravating the disease growing in his chest and lungs. It didn’t work very well, though, since Steve seemed to be the one to come and get him when they had team things, or when he didn’t eat.
. But he wasn’t. He could hear Rhodey, blessed Rhodey shouting out. But, man, stupid Rhodey! Didn’t he know Peter was sleeping.
Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes, the battle that raged around them forgotten. "Don't speak. Just… I'm gonna get you help. You'll be fine."
"They're all safe," Steve said, voice shaking a little as the pain in his arm flared more. "If it worked, they're all safe in their beds."
Eventually the rest of the team showed up, and the party was underway. There were more games, and they sang Happy Birthday and had cake. After cake was presents, which resulted in a mixed back of gifts. From Ned, he'd gotten the new Lego Death Star set, which they would eventually build together, while Liz and Gwen had apparently pooled together money to buy him a brand new camera. His old one was fine, but it was still old, and he'd accidentally scratched the lense a while back. Wade had apparently bought him a helmet and pads, which didn't make sense, until his dad said that Wade had permission to take him to the skatepark to learn to ride Wade's skateboard every Monday and Thursday.
He, Sam, and Bucky had all spent the majority of the day listening to Tony order and direct them on where to move Steve's stuff. They would move one thing in, put it where Tony said, and then have to move it because Tony had changed his mind on where it should be.
"I know, Boss," Friday said. "But I'm just the offline copy of the original, remember? Let me do this for you."
"Step back," he hissed. "I called Phil and Bruce. They're almost here. I'll get him to them, but you need to get back into the fight."
house AI to be head nanny and Peter's teacher. Her name is Friendly, Rather Interesting, Daily Advisor of Youngling, or Friday. She was in charge of creating Peter's schedules and routines, based on a collection of child rearing advising books off the internet that she routinely updated for milestones two months in advance.
"Wait!" A voice called, somewhat familiar, though one Steve hadn't heard in a long time. "Wait! Captain Rogers!"
“Hey,” he said as he answered, starting to look for the gloves of his suit. Where had he tossed them when he got home? “What’s up?”
And with a blink, it was all gone. He was back in the secret room, the Chitauri Leviathan was still dead, and he could hear the light ideal chatter over the comms. But he had an idea now… An idea that he need to try.
Instantly, everyone jumped to their feet, asking questions and trying to get him to answer. He ignored them all, in favor of scooping up his son, who was grinning from ear to ear. They left quickly after that, Rhodey ushering them out to keep himself from ‘killing Tony himself’. Then, when they were finally out, and in their car, Tony grinned at Peter in the back seat.
“It is currently six eighteen, Sir,” Jarvis said rather chipperly. “And the coffee machine has already started. It is currently 62 degrees outside, with a supposed high of 82 degrees. High tide has already passed, though there is a fair chance of higher waves this evening.”
Steve did his best to stay focused. He led his team, tried to keep them all together and calm. Wilson wasn’t helping, starting to talk to himself again. Steve thought about making him be quiet, but… The man was a good fighter. They could need him.
Two jets came up behind him, and Tony did his best not to groan. Great. Just, fucking great. Turning, he gave a quick “That’s my exit,” and hung up.
Tony couldn't have Jarvis be in charge of the nannies, since he needed him in the lab. So, on a whim, Tony built a
Nothing changed for them at school. They still sat together at lunch, and Wade walked him to all his classes and sometimes carried his books. The only thing that really changed was that on late days, when Peter had a decathlon meet up or was just staying late, Wade would stay back to walk Peter back to the Tower. They’d take their time, Wade bringing his old skateboard to show Peter how to ride it.
The phone was lightly pulled from his grip, and he was eased backwards onto the couch. If he wasn’t paralyzed, he’d probably be having quite the heart attack. Someone was in his house. Some one was
As Weasel went looking for all the guns, Wade hurried to pull on his suit, mind reeling. He would need backup, and Weasel was no match for this guy. It had to be someone he could trust, who wouldn’t questions about why he was asking for help for to long. Someone he could find fairly quickly.
Wade blinked, looking a bit surprised, and cocked his head to the side. "He's already got four of them? Well, you guys are behind, now!" He grinned, slapping a tune on his thighs. "If you don't hurry, he's gonna beat you to the last stone and then you won't be able to win at all."
“Oh, Uncle Bucky! Yeah, let him in, Friday.” Peter turned to look at his friends, only to find three of them shifting almost uncomfortably. He realized, belatedly, that this was probably a big shock for everyone. That, even if they were his friends, this was a lot to take in. Especially for Ned. He already knew Peter was Spiderman, but this on top of that? “Wait, no. I’ll meet him in the hall, okay?” he turned to his friends, trying to give his best smile. “You guys get comfortable. Wade can show you how to work the TV, and where the fridge is.”
She looked over her shoulder and gave a little nod. Steve was prepared to see another stranger step forward, someone that would have had enough experience to shut Friday down. Instead, a familiar man stepped out from around the corner. He was ragged, with dirt dusting his clothes and thinner then Steve had ever seen him, with a pouch hanging from a long cord around his neck. Still, Steve would recognize him anywhere.
With a deep breath, Wade stepped inside his house. Well, it wasn’t his, really, but he was living there. A month ago, he had nearly been caught when Peter had gone to Weasel’s bar to ask about something, and decided it would be a good idea to not be living there until this was all over. So, yeah, he had a roommate named Al, who was blind, and Wade was waiting patiently for the day his roomba came in the name so he could torment her.
So he swung home, entered through the window, and pulled off the suit to dump it in the wash. He then went to the kitchen to eat first, after washing his hands, and turned on the TV as he made a sandwich.
It took him a few minutes to connect the entire thing and connect it to the shoulder. A series of clicks, a soft hum that soof faded away into nothing, and then they were set. The arm was attached and nothing had gone wrong. Tony sat back to admire his work, watching as Barnes slowly streached the fingers, rotated the wrist, and and bent the elbow.
“Tony?” she said, only for his body to go ridged, a ringing in his ears. “Tony, are you there? Hello?”
With a deep sigh, Steve spares a glance at his comforter. Tony looks back at him with concern, his own eyes wet. Steve realizes he has never seen this much emotion on Tony. Emboldened, he grabs his hand and squeezes. “Thank you,” he forces out.
“Mr. Rogers!” Jackie’s voice startled him out of his inner monologue. “Thank goodness I have your class today. I can’t handle any more of the outside world today,” she giggled as she waltzed in and took her seat with a plop, dropping her bag to the ground. She was always one for an entrance. Despite the oftentimes disruptive behavior, she worked hard in his class and he enjoyed the energy she brought to the room.
Jarvis looked at Steve, shrugged with a half a smile on his lips and left the way Tony came, leaving Steve to stand in the hallway and wonder why he really liked wearing Tony’s shirt. Maybe it had to do with the fact that Tony had more than enough of anything he wanted and it felt like one step closer to the same playing field. Maybe he was just attracted to him physically and it was setting off a hormonal response inside of him.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut as a tear rolled down his face. “I don’t have a clue,” he croaked out. “I already feel so lost.”
“That’s what this is about? Steve, you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. You walk in here, criticizing me, and you don’t even know what you’re talking about!”
Not knowing what was possessing him, Steve handed the notebook to him. Only after he passed it off did he realize exactly
So he just nodded and said, “Okay.” His voice was weak. A lump was forming in his throat. When he looked back up, she’d closed her eyes again. He stayed with her all afternoon, until he needed to go to his after-school job. Maria was still sitting in the hallway when he walked out. She closed her book when she noticed Steve.
The implication of what’s coming next causes Steve to feel himself getting hard almost immediately. Tony grabs him so gently, as if he’s worried Steve might break. Steve kisses him. Tony smiles at that. “Thank you,” he says, but Steve isn’t sure what he’s thanking him for.
He went to see his mom as often as he could afford. Each time he was afraid the receptionist would look at him with a sympathetic look and tell him she had passed. At least she would finally get to rest.
Tony waltzed in and threw himself on the opposite side of the sofa, nose in a technical looking magazine. Before he could start reading though, he lowered it and did a double take of the room. “Wait a second, what’s happening?” he asked.
“What is it today Jack?” he asked with just a glance her way. He was helping another student with a technique they’d been struggling with.
Tony gives him a deep kiss, filled with a lot of emotion, before sliding down to where his hand was doing things to Steve he didn’t know were possible. Before Steve could think about what was about to happen, he felt Tony’s wet, hot mouth close over the head of his cock.
The day of the funeral is hard. Steve stumbles through his tear-filled speech but he’s able to get through it. He feels his heart sinking with the coffin as it is lowered into the ground.
She smiled and said, “Oh, it was really no trouble. I know you’d have never gone in there and advocated for time off, especially with movie night looming over you.”
Steve loved feeling close to Tony, and this came as a surprise to him. Of everyone on the planet, the guy who was rich and spoiled was the last person he thought he’d ever fall for. Not that he was falling, it’s just, he wasn’t as bad as Steve had convinced himself before.
He wasn’t, thank goodness. Jarvis went into his closet and came out with a simple white button up shirt.
“No. I haven’t wanted anyone else ever since I saw my portrait in your sketchbook and realized I had a chance.”
Steve laughed but did scoot closer to Tony. It didn’t take very long once the movie started before Steve was hiding his face from the screen.
“Is that my --?” he started to ask. Then he mumbled under his breath, “Oh, right, the dinner. Nevermind,” and brushed past them into his room.
“What’s up Mr. Rogers?” She greeted him more formally than usual, probably sensing his serious mood.
Tears stream down Steve’s face the entire time it takes him to make and eat his sandwich. He grabs his sketchbook and a pencil but all he can do is furiously sob and scribble on the page.
Tony’s demeanor shifted immediately. He sat up and squared his shoulders. “And just what the hell is that supposed to mean Steve?” he spat out. He looked closed off and confused.
Tony was looking at him with a weird expression. “You know, Rogers, what hurt the most is I thought we had a banter going. I didn’t realize the malice was real for you. Because, it’s not just the kids that I care so much about. I care about you, too.”
Tony opened his mouth and was clearly trying to think of something to say. Finally he said, “Well, actually yes, but we can change it if you want. I really like this one and I thought you might too but we can definitely change it.”
“You’re not gonna deny it? Be stubborn about it? Spend another week and a half moping before you decide to still not take my advice? What the hell, who are you?”
He sat down at his desk and sighed. He needed to be in a good mood for the students. This was supposed to be a happy classroom, after all.
To Steve’s surprise, Howard just chuckled and said, “Oh, nonsense. I’m sure it’d pay better than any other job you could find around here. Plus, with a recommendation from me, you’d probably have colleges throwing money at you afterwards. Really, you should think about it.”
Steve rolled his eyes and got back to work, angling his book so that only he and the wall behind him could see his work. Tired of being reminded of his mother’s failing health, he flipped to a new page and let his pencil decide what he would focus on next.
When they get back to the house, Steve goes straight to his room. He curls up in his bed knowing his mom would understand if he didn’t get up for the rest of the day. Just as he’s resolved to do just that, his door creaks open and Tony peaks his head in. His eyebrows are raised in a silent ask for permission. Steve gives it to him with a small half-smile and a subtle nod of his head.
“You know exactly what I mean. Jackie today? Making fun of her in front of the whole class? Teacher’s should be safe people for students. They should protect them from bullies, not be the bullies themselves.”
Tony bristled, “Damn right you do. What the hell was that the other day? I thought you knew me better than that.”
“Okay, first of all, that’s private. Second of all, I’m going to pretend you didn’t just ask me to help you cheat on an assignment. Does academic integrity mean nothing to anyone these days? Third, what the hell is so bad about letting down Mr. Rogers? The guy’s already got his mind made up about you so you’re in the clear, right? Geez, besides those biceps, what’s so great about him anyways? Okay, forget I said that. But really, you’re going to have a late assignment and the world isn’t going to end.”
Steve guessed the worst part about the new living situation, aside from his mother’s missing touch, would be Tony Stark. Dinner was one thing, but living under the same roof with the spoiled brat would be another scenario entirely.
He had to admit the food was good though. After the main course was served his spirits were lifted immensely. He was starting to suspect he had just been hangry…
“Well you ought to come tour at Stark industries sometime! If you like it, we could set you up with a summer internship. If things go well, that’s a great way to get into a good college,” Howard interrupted. He seemed really excited, so as awkward as Steve felt, he couldn’t blame the guy. He didn’t have the heart to tell him there was no way in hell he could afford to put himself through college.
Tony was late to dinner again. He nodded to the grumpy looking man at the other end of the table and took his seat which was, unfortunately, next to Steve.
“Well today Mr. Stark thought it would be funny to tell the whole class about my disastrous tryout for the hurdles! He even showed them the video of me hitting three in a row and then actually face-planting on the fourth. Guess I’ll be sticking to sprints again this year.” She rolled her eyes and started getting out her supplies for her current project.
Maria gets home and makes Steve’s favorite, although he has no idea how she even knows that. Howard gives him a firm nod and a reassuring hand on his shoulder. Tony sneaks into his room after they’ve all turned in for the night and just holds him. Steve is enormously thankful that he hadn’t had to knock on Tony’s door instead. He’d been about two minutes from swallowing his pride and telling Tony he couldn’t bear to be alone tonight.
Maybe Steve should feel guilty for how hot the words felt hitting his ears, when he should be mourning his mother, but he doesn’t. Instead he turns his head to Tony and holds eye contact with him for a long beat. Eventually he nods; it’s such a subtle movement he’s not sure if Tony will register it, but he must because while still looking in his eyes, Tony’s hand begins to move southward.
After hours pass and they’re still like that, Tony asks him not to move and disappears for a bit. He returns with food and water.
Steve was overcome with emotion as he looked down at the pages. They were Tony’s own work and many were of Steve. There were a few of him in his classroom, bright eyes while talking to students, one of Steve concentrating on one of his own pieces, and even a couple landscapes, including a track. “Tony, you, wow. How long have you been doing this? These are amazing,” he said when he finally drew his attention away from the pad.
“You’re going to have to stay with the Starks. I’ve already talked to Maria about it. They’re more than happy to have you with them.”
If it had been anyone else, anytime else, really, Steve would have argued. But it wasn’t. It was his mom and she was sick. She cared about him. She wanted to know he’d be okay if -- if the unthinkable happened.
Steve realized suddenly that everything was going to be okay. His wound would always remain but eventually it would fade.
“Tony, do you ever think about other people?” And wow, okay, he hadn’t meant to start out that harsh. He’s fed up with Tony and he’s hit a boiling point, alright?
Tony walked back into the room with a smoothie in his hand and now that Steve was actually paying attention he realized Tony must have been working out. He had a line of sweat down the middle of his t-shirt that made it half-way see through.
His ears are ringing and his vision is filled with tears. He’s still taking his anger out on his sketchbook when he feels someone wrapping their arms around him.
He crosses the room and gets under the covers behind Steve. He settles in with his arms around Steve’s waist, as if he was holding Steve together. Tony doesn’t talk much when they’re like this but today he says, “You’re handling this so much better than I would. How are you staying this strong?”
When they got to Steve’s classroom he found his own sketchbook. “I wouldn’t have had time to make these if you’d made your move before. How am I supposed to get the guy without a gesture of my own?” he asked, offering the book to Tony.
Smiling, Steve realized that was the longest he’d been awake and not worrying over his mom since she’d fallen ill.
“You know exactly who. I don’t know what happened with you guys but Mr. Stark hasn’t joked about you in two weeks and you’ve been moping since the foot due date. And I don’t think our projects were that bad,” she quipped immediately. She was actually a lot like Tony, Steve realized.
She was always just as he left her, either sleeping peacefully or awake, but always in bed. A smile always spread across her face if she was awake when he arrived. Tonight was one of the nights she was awake.
Tony looked embarrassed. “Well, I may have snuck a few photos of you teaching class. We can’t all do that from memory.”
Annoyed, Steve kept his cool, “Well, I’ve got a job. I might not have time for an internship on top of that,” he replied. Of course Tony wouldn’t understand what it was like to have to work if he wanted to keep food on the table. He really shouldn’t be surprised.
So that was that. He’d finish out the rest of March, pack his things, and move in with the Starks. They’d lose their home and he’d eventually lose his mom. This was his life now.
His mom had only been working at the Stark’s for a week, but Steve was already irritated with the family. She was working long hours with very little to show for it. Maybe he wouldn’t have minded as much if she was in better health. With his soft spot for his mother, though, they could give her the moon and he would still know she deserved better. After all these years of caring for Steve, she deserved a break more than anything else. She needed one, too. Try as she might to hide it, Sarah Rogers was not immune to her ever-increasing age. Steve saw how she rubbed her feet before she went to bed and how tired she seemed in general. How the Starks could see this and still work her as hard as they did was something he’d never understand.
But a couple minutes later Tony came back in with a large bowl of popcorn. He offered it to Steve without looking at him and went back to reading his magazine until Howard arrived. Still in his work clothes, he loosened his tie and sat in the recliner.
“Actually Steve, before you tore my head off I was planning to wrap it in a bow, plop it on your desk and make a pass at you,” Tony shot back, tilting his head like he knew he’d won.
Whatever Tony was about to say was cut off by Steve taking his hand. He held Tony’s hand in both of his own, tracing over his knuckles. “I’ve always thought you have beautiful hands Tony,” he said softly. “But that’s not what I came here to tell you.” He looked up at Tony. Tony’s eyes were wide and he was speechless. If Steve were thinking about it, he might realize how rare it was for Tony to have nothing to say. “I came here to tell you that I’ve never seen the amount of care that you put into everything you do from anyone else. I, that’s---. It’s everything I want to see in the world. I let my jealousy blind me and I am done. I’m done pretending I don’t love every ounce of your attention. I’m done pretending I don’t spend all weekend waiting to see you again. I can’t take back what I said to you, but I can ask for your forgiveness.”
Steve turned his head toward him, “Mr. Stark,” he said, leveling him with a cold, yet polite, look, he continued, “I’m just taking in all the excitement for the upcoming season.”
That afternoon, Steve found himself headed straight toward Tony’s classroom, confrontation on his mind. He walked right in and up to where Tony was sitting at his desk, grading papers. Tony looked up questioningly but the words “Hey Rogers” fell out of his mouth and the corners of his lips turned upwards a bit.
Steve was wrong, but living with Tony was still a close second. The worst part about living with the Starks was the dinner parties. Steve had moved in a little under a week ago but he’d been informed this morning that he needs to dress nice for dinner tonight. Wondering where on Earth he’d put his Nice Shirt™-- because he sure didn’t remember packing it last week, he wandered around the house looking for Jarvis.
“Could I see Steve in the office for a moment please?” the school secretary poked her head into Steve’s calculus class and startled Steve out of his thoughts a few weeks later. She seemed a bit uneasy, which worried Steve.
Steve felt himself tense up as one of the characters did something risky. Mentally biting his nails, he was waiting to see how the scene would play out. Then he felt something touch his thigh. He looked down and Tony was inching his feet into his lap. Fighting back a smile, Steve pretended not to notice.
Steve’s not sure what makes him say it. Something about the excitement on Tony’s face maybe. Regardless he responds, “No, that’s okay. You’ll just have to excuse me if I jump a million times.”
“They’re working you too hard ma,” he said, trying again, as she sat in her usual space on their sofa.
“Oh really, because this is the first time you’ve spoken before thinking about the party on the other end of the joke, huh? All you care about is a laugh.” Steve was absolutely fuming. Stark didn’t even care that he’d embarrassed the girl. Steve could handle when it was directed at him, but at the kids? There was no way he’d sit back and watch that happen.
“No, Tony, I was wrong. I was so caught up in my own world that I didn’t see all the wonderful things you do for your students. The Millikan oil drop experiment? Just to get them engaged in class? That’s no small feat Tony. I looked it up. And calming Jackie down? Hell, that isn’t easy. The fact that she went to you in the first place speaks volumes. I’m sorry that I didn’t look past what I thought I saw when I first met you. That’s on me and it was my loss. Now that I’m with the program I can see what everyone else clearly already does, that you care so much about all the kids. I’m sorry it took me so long.”
So Steve has a thing for Tony. He realized it when he was laying in bed after the scary flick. Okay, fine. Not the end of the world. Minor inconvenience? Sure. As long as it doesn’t develop into the sort of thing that has him literally drooling when Tony gets home from school, he’ll be alright.
“I’m so sorry Steve. I know this must be hard for you,” she said. “I’ll drop you off at Yuni’s. If you don’t feel comfortable staying at your place alone you can pack a bag after work and you can move in a little earlier than planned.”
He tried to convince her to find a new one but she insisted it really wasn’t so bad. He didn’t believe her.
Steve shucked off his t-shirt and tried it on. He looked in the mirror as he buttoned it up. Jarvis was right, his shoulders were certainly pushing the shirt’s limits, but it didn’t look too bad.
Or at least he thinks so. He’s less sure about his previous convictions after Tony comes into his room straight out of the shower to retrieve a shirt Steve had borrowed wearing nothing but a towel and his chest still glistening. Steve is doing his absolute darndest to commit the sight to memory so he could put it on paper later when Tony looks his way and catches him staring. Steve, in a panic, dives right into a coughing fit before Tony has a chance to comment.
She went on to explain that she hadn’t finished her foot assignment, even though the deadline was today. Steve was not sure why this had been cause for a panic, because he was generally pretty lenient and she had a high grade in his class already. But, he let her finish before reassuring her it would all be fine.
Tony relaxed a little. He sighed, “You know, Rogers, you ought to loosen up.” Then he slapped him on the shoulder and left.
Steve’s brain started to come back online. He stuttered, “Oh, um, yeah. Work out. Right. Gotcha.” That didn’t sound right. What were we talking about?
Maybe it was a good movie; maybe it wasn’t. Steve wouldn’t know. What Steve did know? That Tony smells
“Ah-ah-ah, I think I’ll hold onto this. But don’t worry, I’ll wait for you before I dive back in,” he said. Then he turned around and left the classroom, leaving Steve a bit flustered.
But now, looking for Jarvis, it was convenient that he only had to take a few paces to knock on his door. Jarvis opened the door after a few beats. He seemed a little confused, which was probably because Steve had done an excellent job at keeping to himself so far.
So they wound up on the sofa in their same seats as the family movie night. The mood was much different this time without Maria and a snoring Howard just a few feet away. Tony put in the movie and the previews started rolling. When the second preview was yet another scary movie Steve realized he should have asked Tony what movie they were watching. He
“So are you working on something that private or is it just me you don’t want to see what you’re working on?” he asked.
So Steve was starting to feel a little less out of place with the Starks. He enjoyed quality time with them to the point that he began looking forward to it. He liked to cook for them occasionally to show his appreciation for their generosity. But, that didn’t mean he didn’t still miss his mom. Sometimes, especially at night, it all felt like too much.
“Steve,” she was squeezing his hand and trying to regain his attention. His eyes were squeezed shut. He didn’t want the tears to fall out. If his mom was not planning on going back to work soon, then this was worse than he thought. He thought he’d have to fight to keep her in bed.
The next day after school Steve sat at the dining room table working in his sketchbook. His boss had sent him home early after seeing how exhausted he looked. Steve wasn’t sure if he was grateful or if he resented the pity. Either way, he was glad he didn’t have to pretend to be in a good mood for customers today. He’d been working on a piece featuring his mother for half an hour now. It was helping to relax him somewhat, he supposed.
She grabbed his hand and stroked it. “I’m always with you and I will always be with you. Remember that when you are afraid,” she said. “And when you are lost you will always find your way again.”
Tonight was definitely one of those nights. Steve was in his room working in his sketchbook when it all became too much. His vision blurred with tears and he let himself take some time to just cry it out. He thought he heard something outside his door so he silenced himself and waited. When he heard nothing he sighed and got ready for bed.
“Jesus Christ Steve! Do you even hear yourself? Jackie LOVES attention! She loves it! I’m sure the first thing she did when she got to her next class was brag about how it was all about her for a few minutes! You really heard about that and your first thought was that I was being a jackass? I thought we were friends!”
“I jumped to conclusions. I’m used to you teasing me and I just assumed the same thing was happening with Jackie when she mentioned the hurdle incident.”
Three episodes in Tony’s hands on Steve’s stomach started feeling a little warmer. In his ear, Tony said, “Steve. I want to make you feel good… and I understand that it might not seem appropriate right now, so feel free to tell me to cool it, but I promise that I just want to take your mind out of reality for a little while. You deserve to feel good Steve.”
The screen went black and Tony, as expected, pulled his feet out of Steve’s lap to slink back to his room.
“That gives me a lot to think about. I’ll be sure to consider it,” he said, still a little bit in a daze. He’d still have to find a place to live when the Stark’s eventually kicked him to the curb, but hopefully the pay at the internship was really as good as Howard made it out to be. Steve might just be okay.
His day turned around very quickly once classes started. One of Steve’s great joys in life was helping others create the art they could feel in their hearts. Plus, he only had one of the classes students were required to take today, so most of them actually wanted to be there today. Always a plus, he laughed to himself.
Steve coughed into his hand and straightened up, “Well like I said, I just don’t think I can afford to quit my job for a whole summer, especially with ‘ma in the hospital.”
Friends? NOT the first word Steve would have used. Steve cocked his head. “Well I can’t speak for Jackie but I sure as hell think you ought to put a little more thought in the next time you think you’re being funny,” Steve finished coldly.
When he’s alone the weight feels crushing. When he’s with Tony it lets up enough to let him see the light of tomorrow.
Steve opened the door and looked at his mom. She looked so peaceful with her eyes resting closed. Grabbing her hand, he sat down next to her bed. She stirred and opened her eyes.
Now, with the chance of actually dying, Tony thought only of Peter. He thought only of his… of his son that he'd had since he was four months old, but had never held. He'd never even picked up his own son! He had become the one thing he had never wanted to be. He'd become his own father.
I hope you enjoyed reading this chapter. Iron Man 2 is one of my... less liked in the MCU, it's just really bad, in my opinion, but I was trying to make it more clear on how codependent that are? Not sure if that came across, so tell me how you think I did in the comments! Also, tell me you love little Peter with the spider legs! Like, seriously, I kinda wish someone could just draw the donut scene, I would love them forever!
Current movie order for the rest of the chapters is as follows: Iron Man 3, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron, Spiderman, Deadpool, and Civil War.
"That's what you think," Wade sing-songed. "I know more then you think, el Capitan. There's only one way we win this, and this is it."
“Maybe,” Tony said, turning to look down at Peter as he scurried to his front as Obie went behind him.
“I’m gonna head home,” Ned said, eyeing Weasel from the side. “Just… text me when you’re done, okay? So you can tell me… whatever happened.”
“He was excited about some kind of date,” Barnes says, turning to look at Tony somewhat quizzically.
Peter nodded, ever so slightly, as Tony carried him to his room. Tony’s room, big and spacious, was more used then Tony remembered. He rarely slept there, except when he had, uh, company over. Now, it looked like someone had been sleeping in the bed daily for months.
Tony sighed, looking over the cards as Pepper thanked Coulson. Peter looked at the cards, then at Tony, and made a sour face as he got up. Tony stood, still looking at cards, and let Pepper help him put on his jacket.
When tomorrow finally came, Steve was ready for anything. He was ready first thing in the morning to take down any bad that came up, say no to anyone who asked him for help with training. He was ready to do whatever he needed to to make this date happen. It was happening and the world could fight him if they thought otherwise.
“My son is a bit of a photographer,” Tony explained. “So he’ll be taking all the official wedding photos. Or most of them. But if you talk to him, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind some help. And since Peter is starting public school, I have to have it on a day where you wouldn’t miss class anyway, so you’ll be fine there.”
Wade felt his heart jump to his throat, and he leaned back. “Wait, Peter, I’m not… I’m not the same man under this mask that I was…”
"Wade?" Tony asked. He was surprised to see the young man there. Steve had told him, when he was filling Tony in, that Wade had snapped, started talking crazy about things Steve didn't understand. And now, Wade had an Infinity Stone in his possession. If he really had gone crazy, then this was cause for concern.
Tony, on the other hand, blinked. “Oh. But… That's not until tomorrow. I mean, we just made plans this morning to get dinner together. I mean, it's… it's tomorrow isn't it?”
Deciding it was better not to argue, Peter quickly left the room, ducking behind a corner. He wasn't heading for the restroom, though. He was heading for the roof. Maybe, just maybe, he could get suited up in time to come in for a daring save. He did stop, however, to get a glimpse of whoever it was that was intruding, and was shocked to see Dr. Connors. Except this time, he looked… offle. His skin was covered in strange green scaly rashes.
When he got to the desk, where the case with his ‘Best Heart’ trophy was, he tried to grab it. He did. But he couldn’t reach, and laid on the floor. Then, a soft whirring sounded above him. The case appeared in his peripheral vision, and Tony nearly cried when he saw Dummy, looking down at him with his camera, claw turning ever so slightly.
He set it up in fabrication, deciding on a lightweight material, thinner then Steve’s suit. It was more flexible, to, and while it didn’t have any extra pouches, he didn’t feel like he needed any aside from one for his phone and one for his wallet. Just incase.
