He grunts in frustration. He can't make himself calm down or will his heart to stop attempting to escape his chest. He cannot believe his luck, Sherlock has agreed to go on a date with him, even if it's in return for something.
Quite unexpectedly, he wasn't the one to give in to his urges. John was the one to move closer and put his arms around him. Sherlock sighed as he buried his nose in John's soft hair. John's smell, voice, and body all filling his senses and comforting him in the most intimate way imaginable.
The familiarity of the quite smile and the intense gaze send shivers down John's spine, but they also poke at old wounds he thought were healed. He schools his expression into neutrality nonetheless, and tries to act natural.
"You ought to have more faith in me, little brother. I do care about your personal life as you very well know." Mycroft feigned a hurt expression, but took out a file from the inside pocket of his jacket all the same. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John felt heat rise in his face as he finally understood what she had been insinuating. For some reason, words betrayed him and all he could do was stammer as he crossed the threshold.
The curly head made an appearance at the end of the line. John watched intently as the man stepped out of the door and surveyed the yard with boredom as if he was looking at a new flat to rent. He looked even more posh in real life, and frankly quite gorgeous. John winced at the thought of how prone to harassment he could be here. Poor sod.
Sherlock pulled him down for a kiss, and John’s groan was muffled in his mouth as he pushed deep inside one last time and came
On the fifth day, Sherlock did not mention any weird and outdated names. He just kept looking at John, eyes repeatedly falling to his mouth. John suppressed a shudder and busied himself with changing the gauze and checking on the wound.
"I thought we'd go to Brighton, relax for a bit" She paused for a moment, but it was clear she had more questions "So, what did you and your friend...What did you say his name was?"
Sherlock's tired eyes remained fixed on John's face as he gently cleaned the cuts on his face. He stared at him, as if contemplating a treasure he was afraid of losing.
"You mean your friend Amy? The one who died?" Sherlock asked. It was clear something wrong was going on in this group of friends, a secret had been waiting for years to be revealed.
They were silent again for a couple of minutes. Sherlock seemed to be deep in thought until he spoke again.
Dimmock half exhaled half coughed with a choked noise, and John took the chance and aimed a punch at him, knocking him over. John kneeled next to him, he was very much alive, only knocked out. He looked up at Sherlock, who actually looked disappointed.
She sat on a stool next to him "Remember that position I applied for in Germany? Well, I got an offer" she paused smiling "a really good offer"
"Come on," he grasps Sherlock's right hand in what he hopes is a reassuring gesture. "Let's go home and I'll tell you all about it."
His heart sank and his brain froze. The bandaged stranger was looming over them, holding his axe above his head.
Sherlock sighed in relief, his heart twisting at the sight of the welted eyes and the pale face. John had lost so much blood. Sherlock shuddered at the memory of holding the limp body in his arms until the ambulance came, lost between attempting to stop the bleeding and keeping John conscious.
Then, they simply started sleeping together. The first time it happened, it was morning, and Sherlock came to borrow some milk. Of course in Sherlock's dictionary, the word 'borrow' means barge into people's homes, and steal milk, biscuits, and honey whenever you like.
He took out one strawberry "Are you sure you don't want any?" He put it between his teeth and crashed their mouths together, and they both bit into the sweetness as they kissed, slowly, gently, lovingly.
"Delicious," he whispered appreciatively and resumed his ministrations, but he moved one hand down to his own cock and started pulling slowly at himself.
He fell silent. John had had trouble sleeping since adolescence. His insomnia had helped him through med school, but definitely not in his work life.
Sherlock thrashed on the bed, shaking as he moved between the tongue that was fucking him, and the mouth that was jerking him off.
It's painful though, this odd burning sensation that won't relent, like a hot ember slowly burning its way into his insides. Maybe he's about to go down with the flu, because he feels feverish and nauseous. He must remember to ask John to get him an antibiotic.
“John, oh, John!” Sherlock babbled incoherently lifting his hips, partly to get more of his cock into John’s mouth and partly to allow his trousers to slide down and away. John was clearly desperate for any friction, so he moved back a bit and started pulling up his jumper.
He started peeling off his clothes. The heavy coat fell to the floor, followed by shirt and trousers, revealing flawless ivory in their wake. John sighed in relief as he did not see any serious injuries. He took a deep breath as he led the pliable body to the bathroom. He made Sherlock sit on the edge of the tub as he ran warm water and got his first aid kit.
He can't be jealous, isn't allowed to be jealous. He is married to his work and that's all that matters. Emotional entanglements make one stupid, even stupider than the average individual.
His curiosity and urge to discover the world did not stop there though. He also started conducting what he called "experiments" with the strangest most random objects, like cigarette ash. The mess he made was a small price to pay for the endearing joy that filled the gorgeous face. John could not deny him even if he wanted to.
John fought a valiant battle against the temptation to recapture the soft plush lips in his mouth again. He collected himself the best he could and said it again "No"
"So? They stole one of the guard's keys? Not unlike what you did" John retorted, a tone of anger in his voice.
He wanted him in his bed, under him or above him, to worship and devour his body, not necessarily in that order. The only thing standing between him and that was bloody Sherlock Holmes, who happened to be obsessively in love with the man, who, of course, reciprocated.
Sherlock opened his eyes in alarm, looked at him, and then looked at the other man. John could see the moment he realized what was happening, but there was no time to talk.
As John was considering how they could break in, Sherlock pushed him aside impatiently, holding what looked like a narrow pin in his hand. He casually picked the lock until it clicked open.
"You have to get over this ridiculous crush you've got on him, he is mine Greg, and I don't like sharing.”
"Yes" Sherlock nodded "He sent me someone to help" he stopped for a moment and closed his eyes again "It hurts, John"
"Lestrade!" John points at him unnecessarily, "Isn't he the coppa that gives you your cases? I've seen you around. You've never told me he's your brother in law, Sherlock!"
Bill stopped too, and he and Sherlock stood on either side of John, who kept staring at something down the hall. It quickly became clear what it was, because something glinted in the dark and Sherlock stopped breathing when he recognized the axe.
"John, I realize your observation skills are quite primitive, so I would like to call your attention to the fact that there is only one bed in here." Sherlock said as he dumped his bag on the floor
"No" he says with as much dignity as he can muster, but his quick breathing betrays him and John simply laughs and resumes his ministrations.
Sherlock pushed the buttons hesitantly, but he couldn't help a twinge of curiosity. Since when does Greg tell colleagues about what Sherlock did with the Yard? Odd.
Thanks to anyone who's reading, if you have a comment, feedback, or just want to say hi, I'd love to hear from you! Have a great day.
He stared at one of Sherlock's pink nipples before he licked it, Sherlock shivered and moaned more loudly, and John tasted him again, this time wrapping his lips around the small nub, making Sherlock jerk and arch his back.
"Shit, the generator is supposed to start working automatically. I'll have to go check on it." Bill said.
Sherlock shuts his eyes, bracing himself for one of John's admittedly brilliant fellatios, but John neglects his arrow-stiff cock and goes down to nuzzle the cleft of his behind.
"John…" he whispered between moans and sighs, "John, I'm going to…" but before he finished his sentence, his whole body was shivering as pure ecstasy took over it. He threw back his head as his cock twitching untouched and sending creamy ribbons of semen across John's chest and stomach.
"I don't know. Sometimes my head feels too empty." He paused for a minute, smiling at the fact that Sherlock was so talented at making him talk, he could get a murder confession out of him if he wanted to.
And yet, every evening after work, John would show up at 221B with a bag of takeaway and stay there until midnight. Sometimes they went out to have dinner at Angelo's, and sometimes John accompanied him on his clients' cases. It proved very useful to have John tag along, not just because he was a police officer with a gun always at the ready, but also because the way they worked and talked together made Sherlock think more clearly and get to the bottom of mysteries quicker for some reason.
All those years, John had tried to protect his baby sister. Every time their father had come home drunk and started breaking things, John had stood between him and the shaking terrified heap that was Harry. All he ever wanted was for her to be happy and safe, and someone had come and taken all that away in a moment, leaving a gun in her hand. As if John would for a second believe she had done this to the woman she loved, the woman she quit drinking for.
"We can't do this. It's inappropriate and illegal, and I'd be taking advantage of you" John answered as he gently pulled away, letting Sherlock's fingers trace a path on his neck before they were completely off. The touch made him shudder and sigh.
All he could do was lean against the door and wait for the inevitable. He wondered where Smith had gotten and how long it would take him to send help.
Sherlock could not will himself to leave John's side all day. Seeing him cheerful was even more brilliant, rendered Sherlock even more entranced.
Greg tried to stop him before he went inside, but he pushed him aside slowly and approached the bodies slumped on the sofa. Harry's face looked sad, as if she had fallen into an uncomfortable slumber, and Clara's face was buried in her arms.
If you have comments, feedback, or anything to say, please go ahead. I probably should have said this in the beginning but English is NOT my first language, so if it feels like something is wrong then I'm probably thinking in another language. Sorry!
It wasn't a knock as much as the sound of someone leaning on the door. The moment his hand slid on the handle, his arms were suddenly full of a wet thin shivering body.
The next day, John's first appointment was with Mr. Posh guy, whose name turned out to be a perfect suit for him: Sherlock Holmes. When John took a look at his full file, he was more convinced that the man did not belong here. He was rather young, 28 to be precise. He had a degree in chemistry, went to Harrow's, and then Cambridge. He even lived a few streets away from John's flat!
"It's too much for them. People don't believe in us anymore" He seemed to be lost in thought for a bit, then came back to himself, flipping the photo to reveal another one behind it. This one showed a curly-haired boy laughing madly.
But Sherlock's face was passive, and he stared back at John with the same sorrowful expression… now almost apologetic, and John suddenly felt cold all over.
"You want to watch anything?" he said, looking at a spot near the door opposite Sherlock, who sat in a chair by the window. "Me neither."
"John" Sherlock moaned loudly as he pushed John's head off his chest and tried to lead him downwards, where the outline of his cock was painted in the expensive fabric of his trousers.
Sherlock was looking intently at him, but when John met his gaze he noticed he hadn't been looking at his face, but rather at the silver bracelet around his wrist. John withdrew slowly and slipped his hands in the pockets of his jeans.
As he watched rain drops slipping lazily on the glass, Sherlock wondered what water tasted like. He had always wondered about taste, always marveled at people's fascinations with foods and drinks and... well, kisses. He stopped his mind immediately, he had a job to do and it was no time to let his strange fantasies take him to unfamiliar territories of his equally strange brain.
Just as they moved toward him, he ducked and slid his hand on the handle, went inside the office and bolted the door with a chair. It was only a matter of time before they broke in, as the prize now was not just a hostage. This was the room where the drugs were stored as well. John headed for the other door, having no clue where it led. Outside, he found himself in a hallway not unlike the one on the other side, and he could see another rusty old door in the far end, though it looked like it hadn't been opened in years.
"No… not that I know of. The surrounding land is property of my family, so anyone here is trespassing. I have no idea who that might have been."
"Mr. Lestrade, this operation is a big deal. If you continue to eat like this and smoke, then you might as well skip it."
He started revising the data at hand. First, he could rule out Susan and Bill, who was with him the moment John was attacked in the forest. Therefore it was one of the three men: Rupert, Max, or Jake. They all knew Lidiya for years and she could have easily given any of them a motive to kill her, but why John? He only met them when he arrived here…
Greg felt his body burning with need as he watched John's clever lips worship and tantalize Sherlock's body. His hand moved slowly to palm his raging erection and he tried not to moan at the contact.
But her face fell at that "Well, I was wondering" she squeezed his fingers "If you… would come with me. They have another open position. It's a very prestigious hospital, John. It's what we've always worked for!" the words tumbled out of her mouth quickly as if she suddenly found the courage to speak.
Only then did Mycroft spare John a glance, he had the same scientist-dissecting-a-specimen look as Sherlock, but that was as far as the siblings' similarity went. Mycroft was cold and condescending, whereas Sherlock was curious and endearingly invested in every small detail.
Suddenly, a loud, blood-chilling scream came from ahead. Sherlock's legs moved before his brain even began to analyze what was happening. It was undoubtedly Susan's voice, and something was wrong. He shivered as fat drops of rain started falling lazily on his face, his whole body working to get to John.
The conversation was quickly steered in another direction, and the rest of dinner was fairly quite and friendly.
"No, John. I just never want to lose you." Sherlock's tone was serious. He had to say it, had to tell John that the thought of being without him was so unbearable, it almost drove him to tears.
John was being led through a part of the facility he had never stepped foot in before, yet Sherlock was striding confidently down the hallways. The view around them transformed as they crossed different sections, and John thought they must be in a different wing by now, because the walls gradually started looking more polished and clean. It must have been the part where administrative offices resided.
John can't fault him really, Sherlock made himself clear the first night they met when John attempted to flirt. "Married to my work," he said, and John respected that, though he felt his foolish heart fall a bit deeper even as he was being rejected.
John kept glaring at Sherlock, and for just a fraction of a second, he caught a glimpse of what looked like regret in the grey eyes.
"Mind telling me what you're doing here. This isn't your jurisdiction as I trust everyone has been informing you repeatedly." He cast a look in Anderson's direction, who lifted his hand in surrender and left the room.
"There we go." John lifts his head with a proud smile, and Sherlock wants to hate him so bad in this moment.
Mike took a piece of gauze and started dabbing at Sherlock's brow. White, hot pain pierced through Sherlock, and he winced and instinctively recoiled
John's hands are moving between Sherlock's hair and chest, stroking and teasing. He is slotted between Sherlock's open legs and their erections are at perfect alignment, but John isn't moving, won't move no matter how much Sherlock tries to buck underneath him.
He changed into his pajamas too and slipped under the covers. John made a sound between a sigh and a scoff.
Sherlock smiled again and nodded. John turned around to leave and took a few steps, but he couldn't leave it at that, he wanted to take at least one more look at the impossible eyes, but when he turned back around, Sherlock had disappeared.
"Yes. You had planned to go for a pint with a friend. He texted you twice while you were dozing" he said nodding at John's phone on the desk by the door.
"Now that you mention it, something did strike as not right, but it was… more of a feeling. I can't really put my finger on it."
He walks slowly to the door and takes the key out, but before he can slip it in, the door opens abruptly and he is facing the very distracting, very disarming smile of John Watson.
"Hey, I'm right here, you know" Greg Lestrade said, though he sounded more amused than angry. John looked directly at his face then. He was a silver-haired man with a joyful face. His brown eyes were relaxed and clear as if he had no concern in the world, much unlike his own wife. John noticed something brown on the side of his lip.
"I didn't know. I saw" Sherlock's face lit up "Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. You favor your right side even though you are clearly left-handed. So, wounded in action, invalided and sent home. Afghanistan or Iraq."
Everything happened in what felt like seconds, John had turned his back on the room to get a syringe when he heard a thump and a muffled groan. All he could do in the precious moment he had was shove the needle in his pocket to hide it, he turned and as expected, saw smith on the floor grabbing his head and groaning. He felt is vision blur as someone hit him from behind and something sharp was pressed to his neck. The largest of the inmates was holding him in a death grip, and another one reached and took the handcuffs from Smith's belt and handed them to John.
"Very mature." Umbrella man turns to survey John and something glints in his eyes "Though, I must say I am happy you are engaging in less dangerous… recreational activities."
Sherlock gets home grumpy and bored after a day completely wasted. There hasn't been any cases in a few days, and he has just lost his best source of specimens.
"No" Sherlock shook his head "the doors are electronic and reinforced and the only way to get out is to use one of the officers' keys"
It wasn't long before John was breathing deeply. His right hand was lying on the bed so close to Sherlock's face, tantalizing him. It was warm and unbearably comfortable, and Sherlock couldn't stop staring at John's mouth as he took deep steady breaths.
Greg stared at the phone screen, unable to think of anything to say back to that until another text arrived.
A quick shower and a cab ride later, he is standing over two bodies in the back of a dingy old pub somewhere in Peckham.
John had what felt like the first of many arguments with Sherlock about him staying behind, leaving John to enter the photographer's flat. His brilliant conclusion was indeed correct, all couples had had the same wedding photographer: Jefferson Hope.
"No! Stop!" Sherlock cried desperately, he didn't know what to do, by the time he'd reach John, the attacker would have finished him off with one strike. ONE STRIKE… one wound caused by that thing would cause enough trauma for an immediate cardiac arrest. Sherlock felt sick as he heard Bill emerge from the bushes behind him.
"I'll be right there" John said and went to scrub in, but the nurse stopped him "The patient wants to meet you" John froze. He was never good at this, at soothing and reassuring, it was one of the reasons he became a surgeon rather than a GP, but this was part of any doctor's job nonetheless, and he had to do it. He didn't hate it, but he never knew what to say. He loathed false assurances, but this procedure was standard enough, the patient was going to be fine, no need to fret about it. When he entered the room and saw the patient, his heart skipped a beat. The patient was not fully conscious, already a bit groggy, but his eyes were open and looking directly into John's eyes.  "You're going to be fine" John said confidently, but something in the man's eyes made his throat tight and his hands shaky. He turned and left the room.
Well, it will be a bit itchy, but it's only a couple of flights of stairs, he can do without the pants until he gets to 221B. 221C, the basement flat where his relatively new neighbor lives, is much smaller and darker, but John keeps it spotless clean and meticulously neat that it feels spacious due to the lack of clutter. John is still an intern and cannot afford even this tiny flat, but he somehow charmed Mrs. Hudson to give it to him for a more affordable price. Sherlock tries hard to pretend he is not jealous that he isn't her only spoiled, adored tenant anymore.
Sherlock held Samantha's hand standing behind the operation room's glass as they watched her mother screaming over her small and now lifeless body laid on the operation table. Samantha looked up at him with interest. "What's your name?"
"Are you alright? Who the hell was that?" Bill yelled, making Sherlock snap out of his shock. He quickly released John, who looked flustered and confused.
Sherlock secretly thought he was unlike the 'others.' They never seemed to be as fascinated as he was by humans and their lives. None of the others spent what felt like eternity observing minute details, gestures, and expressions, let alone trying to guess what people did, thought, or wanted. Sure, if he wanted to, he could steal glimpses into people's minds, hear some of their strongest thoughts and emotions, but he rather liked to draw up the conclusion himself and enjoy little victories whenever he was right, which was almost always.
They move carefully and in utter silence. The flat looked almost normal. Its regular occupant was clearly missing however. Sherlock pointed in the direction of an easily missed door at the end of the hall, and John opened it quietly.
"Listen, Sherlock. I like this, I really do" he glances at their bodies, intimately tucked in together.
"I'll ask Bill, and we'll see if we can swap rooms with anyone." He said as he opened the window to look outside "looks like the storm they talked about is going to be worse than expected."
"No. Because something happened in my O.R. and I got this jolt. I got this feeling that there's something bigger out there. Something bigger than me, bigger than you, and…" He stopped suddenly and looked at Sherlock in defiance, as if he was expecting him to laugh "Does that sound crazy?"
Sherlock listened to John's shallow breath as he came even closer. Their lips were inches apart, and just when he thought he was going to kiss him again, he felt something. He looked down and saw Jon run the tip of a knife against his palm.
"And yet you've been spending all your time with him and now you’re solving crimes together. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?"
"Anyway, it was a long time ago." John holds his hand tenderly as they get out of the car, and he doesn't let go all the way to the building.
Sherlock's heart beats at an unreasonable rate as he gets in the car and gives the driver directions. His mind is racing. Is it possible that Greg has discovered the truth before him? That with one look at him and John, he was able to observe and assess the situation correctly? Is it obvious to everyone except him?
It turned out they didn't have to worry, because as soon as they got out to the yard outside, a posh voice was sounding a warning from the chopper.
"The head must have already been severed. After all, the only part of Lidiya we saw when she was being carried was her head. The rest of her body was covered in the cloak… or so we thought, but it wasn't really there. It was already in the woods, so you just had to move the head."
"What happened to you?" John asked as he hauled Sherlock into the living room and close to the fire. He was drenched in water. He had evidently been walking in the rain. His beautiful curls were stuck on his forehead and there were bits of dry blood on various places on his face and hands.
"Listen… this is insane. I wait all day… just hoping for one more minute with you...and I don't even know you" he stammered, feeling heat rising in his face.
John Watson was never the type to misplace his belongings. Army discipline combined with his own inclination for order and tidiness rendered him an excellent keeper of items, especially important ones, like his keys.
"Bollocks" Sherlock curses under his breath as he bumps his little toe on the corner of the bedside table while fishing for his clothes. He then reminds himself to keep quiet to avoid waking the man snoring softly near him.
"I know" he said while sitting up in bed "Christ, you look good. I forgot how good everybody looked" then he started laughing, which was even more puzzling.
He wants to wrap his arms around him and smell his hair and kiss his eyes, but he knows he isn't allowed. Sherlock Holmes does not cuddle. He does not date, and he sure as hell does not do relationships.
"I'm sure you know this but average glucose for a non-diabetic is about a hundred milligrams per deciliter, so if we see a number like that here, we know you've been misdiagnosed" John watched as Sherlock shifted in his seat.
Sherlock's face broke into a smile of… relief? That was odd. John fixed him with a questioning look, but Sherlock kept smiling placidly.
"Oh, no. not you too, Watson, is the freak hypnotizing every officer I know?" Donovan rolled her eyes at him.
As John watched Greg leave to greet other guests, his eyes fell on the Polaroid photo Molly had snapped moments earlier. He looked at it with a grimace. There was Archie, smiling to the camera, but next to him, right where Sherlock was supposed to be, was a blur of white light.
Sherlock took a seat in front of him and John tried to school his expression into neutrality as he prepared the glucose meter. He then glanced at Sherlock to find him glaring at the device.
"Yeah. I know, right." John giggled as his face turned a deep shade of red. He knocked on the fourth door, only to discover it was the empty room, the one that was left for them.
"Yeah, yeah. I'll wait for the full version of the tantrum when Lestrade shows up. Now lead the way."
"You're even more stupid than I thought you were." he said even as he squeezed John's hand possessively.
Mycroft didn't look back as he answered, but kept staring at the birds flying in circles around the gothic building.
I've posted half of this couple of days ago and deleted it, and now I'm posting it again with some changes and added parts. I'm sorry, I know this is annoying, but I was very hesitant about the plot.
Sherlock, though, kept his eyes on the way Susan was leaning forward while she talked to John, repeatedly touching his arm and laughing at his jokes. The urge to grab John's arm and drag him away from the room was overwhelming, but Sherlock managed to keep calm.
"It's alright, John." Bill said and looked at the group. They all stared anywhere but each other. Bill continued. "She was part of our group at film school. She was a brilliant writer. She was cheerful and kind, but one day… we found her dead in her dorm room. She had taken her own life, and we never found out why. I keep thinking if we did… we could have helped her somehow."
When they finally reached the other edge of the bridge of death, they were able to take a good look at the estate. It was a rather big house, one of those old Victorian houses, but it was obviously renovated and regularly maintained. Still, there was something haunting and morbid about it. This coupled with the fact that it was tucked away in the middle of the forest without internet or phone reception made Sherlock make a mental note to pull a full-fledged sulk later on.
"Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, genius and world's only consulting detective, this is a key, and people use it to unlock doors. Awfully useful, you should try it."
"It's alright" John said, smiling at this completely different Molly, who took a hold of his arm and led him to the back garden. The sun was shining and the weather was perfect.
"See that twat there?" John tries not to snort, Sherlock never swears, and it just doesn't suit him. His voice drips with contempt as he stares at an extremely posh looking man engrossed in a conversation with the chief physician at Bart's. He is holding an umbrella and wearing a three-piece suit that must be worth John's rent for five months.
With one glance at the man, he was able to read Mike's obsession with playing by the rules, so he didn't even bother to ask for anything, and now he is bored.
"You want proof? You can speak every language, you travel with the speed of thought, you gather at every sunrise and sunset" He stopped and looked Sherlock in the eye.
This time, Sherlock was the one who came closer. He took John's trembling hand in his. He rested his forehead against John's and whispered desperately.
"Hold this. Put pressure on it" John said and turned to remove his latex gloves and get rid of the used needle. He decided against answering after all. It was never a good idea to discuss personal matters with inmates, even if they were smart gorgeous inmates who had the eyes of a black panther and the lips of a Greek God.
"Yeah, we uh… played rugby together at uni." John says, though he looks suspicious, he must know what's coming.
It was raining so hard, it felt like the city was being washed inside out. John's windscreen wipers worked frantically to clear the glass enough for him to see ahead.
"If it's not the Yard's least favorite detective inspector for two years in a row" Greg said with a grin both exasperated and amused.
Here we go, John thought, one more person who won't believe it, won't see it. He sighed and pinched between his eyes as he felt the beginning of a headache approaching.
"Simple. The room next to ours was Lidiya's, and it was vacant. He used it to get out on the balcony and get to our room's window. He then simply went out the window and back to Lidiya's room and rejoined everyone with deep concern on his face. No one noticed he was late as I was unconscious and everyone was sleepy and confused."
"It's alright." Max smiled, revealing a set of perfect white teeth. "That happens more than you think in our industry, what with changing rooms and all."
"No round three then?" John says with his sexy morning voice, and Sherlock curses again as he remembers. They did it TWICE! Sherlock woke up in the middle of the night and decided he wanted to suck John off while he was asleep, but John did wake up and flipped him over on his back. As he remembers the obscene noises that ensued, Sherlock feels thankful that Mrs. Hudson is away in Bristol with her sister.
She was still smiling. She had a kind face and two delicate lines around her mouth, as if she had smiled so much it was itched there forever. John's heart was beating erratically, not deciding whether to race in horror, or thud slowly in agony. He had to get the words out, the smiling woman was still staring at him.
"If you mean I'm quite lucky then I agree. I didn't expect this dull trip to turn into an exciting case. This is at least an 8." Sherlock said seriously, but John burst out laughing.
"Turn around, face the other way" John instructed, and Sherlock did, suddenly understanding what John wanted, and feeling his heart beat even faster, and his veins aflame with desire.
"Watch out." Sherlock hands John his drink, rises on his left foot and does a full-circle pirouette. When he stops, he rests a hand on John's chest, leaning into him to regain balance, and time freezes as they both stare into each other's eyes, slowly moving into each other's orbits.
There wasn't any doubt about it, there was a bloody severed leg there, and Sherlock couldn't help taking a step back in horror.
He catches himself staring and has the urge to slap his own face. How many times is he going to make this mistake? He doesn't need this, cannot afford to waste his time on romantic entanglements. This will be the last time he sleeps with John, he tells himself for what feels like the 100th time.
"Why are you doing this?" Rupert finally lost his clam demeanor and snapped at Sherlock. "You don't even know me! And why would I attack John? I just met him! I can't possibly be the murderer!"
"I don't know. I think so" John suddenly wore the same expression of loss that Sherlock saw the first time he met him.
They both collapsed to the floor. Sherlock was vaguely aware of John screaming his name from somewhere behind him before his head hit the floor and reality dissolved into darkness.
"I'm not. Look at the grooves that the piano wires made on the railings outside. As a special effects artist, you'd have plenty of experience rigging up a thing like that, Rupert."
Bill grabbed a candlestick from the chest of drawers and lit it. It spilled a faint puddle of light, but at least Bill could see where he was going and John and Sherlock followed.
"Well, it is not about people as much as what makes them the way they are. Every cell, bone, muscle, blood vessel. Every single person is unique and different when it comes to their composition, and therefore every single person heals differently. It is my job to study the details and learn how to help them heal"
"Anderson" John nodded distractedly at the pathologist as he entered the house, bending to cross underneath the crime scene tape.
"Thank you" Greg cleared his throat uncomfortably "Really. John is a dear friend and this means a lot to him."
"We need to go to the crime scene" a deep voice said from behind them. John turned around to find Sherlock casually standing there, looking not just too alert for the hour, but also as polished and pristine as he could. Was he even human?
For a moment John just stared, then he took a step towards him, navy blue eyes carefully searching his face, and just then it occurred to Sherlock how horrible it must have been, not to be believed or listened to all that time, even by friends. He thought of Carl Powers and how furious and frustrated he had been when no one wanted to listen.
"50-year-old had a huge anterior wall MI this morning. Collapsed while jogging. Paramedics resuscitated him, but his EKG's pretty ugly."
"Amy called me that day, told me everything." Rupert whimpered as tears fell freely from his eyes. "She told me she'll never trust anyone ever again. Lidiya deserved to die. I avenged Amy's death, and justice has been served."
"There's no need for an investigation, there's no need for a detective. Particularly one who's outside his jurisdiction and is on the verge of being suspended."
"I am not!" Greg whispered in a bit of a panic. He looked at John, still kneeling by the body and assessing its state. He clearly hadn't heard anything. Greg sighed in relief.
John stood in the park in the spot where they kissed for the first time. He lifted his hands to rub at his eyes "God, help me through this" he muttered.
John opened his mouth to ask what he meant, but Sherlock lifted a finger to his lips, eyes going wide.
He stared at her. This was surprising to put it mildly, and deep down, he wondered if their already fragile relationship could stand a chance through all of that.
Sherlock knows John loves to tease him, but he just can't admit how much it turns him on, because it also makes him furious.
"Oh please, enough of this nonsense." Everyone turned to him in shock, but he went on "I don't feel sorry for you… You killed Lidiya to avenge Amy's death, but then you tried to kill John just to cover up your tracks. That's not justice, you're not a hero. You're just an axe murderer."
I hope you liked this. I'd like to thank everyone who left comments and kudos, you guys encourage me to write more and better and you're just lovely, seriously thank you!
"Obvious. Look at his shirt, it still looks clean and pressed, no sweat or wrinkles. In this heat? He didn't even leave this office before he was killed. Besides, his wedding band is still on his finger and he has cash in his wallet, I checked. Don't you think an inmate would have taken either?"
Also, everything related to medicine I write here is probably wrong, stupid, or stolen from the movie.
Sherlock manages to always look gorgeous, but right now he simply looks radiant in a fitted suit and a purple shirt tailored within an inch of its life. John sighs as he takes in the startling amount of beauty.
John was torn between the impulse to utter a variant of the word 'amazing' and punch him, but all that came out was a short laughter.
Also, I realize I keep shoving Mycroft in every story I write, but I really love him and love his relationship with Sherlock, and then I was like, why not some Mystrade too!
"Maybe? John, you have to do it. You know how I get when I'm bored. Do you want Mrs. Hudson to be upset?"
John moved before anyone got the chance to even react. He aimed a high kick at the attacker's hand, knocking axe to the floor with a loud clatter. He moved back to a defensive stance, clearly this time ready to put his military combat skills to use. However, the mysterious bandaged man seemed to feel helpless without his axe and disappeared into the darkness again. Bill moved to follow, but Sherlock and John stopped him.
He and Anderson searched the infirmary several times, but the little devils were nowhere to be found. He eventually gave up and had to ask Anderson to lock up, hoping he would find them the next day.
"I don't understand a God who would let us meet, if we could never be together" He heard all the bitterness and anger in his voice, but he couldn't hide it if he wanted to.
"Well, if it isn't John Watson!" a voice startles both of them and John sighs in frustration because he simply cannot catch a break with the man he is crazy about.
Sherlock apparently got the message and did not repeat the question, but he didn't stop talking either. John wondered how on earth he managed to be in a good mood, being trapped in this hell hole.
John starts to peel off his clothes without breaking the kiss. His hands work swiftly to unfasten and slide off items of clothing. They move slowly towards the small bedroom, and by the time they're there, Sherlock is only in his pants. A trail of clothes lies on the floor from the kitchen to the bed where he stands, shivering as John kisses and sucks at his neck and chest.
As soon as the house door opened, it was clear the bandaged stranger was not Bill, because Bill was standing there welcoming them into the house. Sherlock knew John had met him in Afghanistan, and they had been close friends for years. He didn't know anything about the other guests except that they were Bill's friends from film school.
"Obvious. Tattoos on the back of their necks clearly shows what gang they belonged to. Murder style too, one bullet between the eyes. Quick and clean. It was an execution. They were either snatching some of the goods behind their bosses' backs or owed someone money, but I can tell it's the former by their backpacks."
"But something unexpected happened and almost ruined your entire plan." Sherlock tried to keep his tone calm.
A million roses bloomed in John's heart. He covered Sherlock's full lips with his, feeling a surging tide of warmth that left him limp. His hand found Sherlock's face, and he cupped the graceful curve of his cheek. Everything was blurred and drowned to nothingness. The soft caress of tender lips flooded John's senses as the only solid thing in a dizzy swaying world.
Then, Sherlock likes to put his head where John's head was, lie exactly within the boundaries of the slight dip in the mattress, and wrap himself completely in John's sheets. It feels warm and safe and smells like fabric softener and John's shampoo.
John nods slowly "He never recovered. Never got over it. I tried to help, but he didn't want my help." John smiles sadly at him, and Sherlock feels like he wants to hold him.
"Don't be ridiculous" Sherlock says, not lifting his eyes from the heavy book he is reading "There's never food in my fridge."
John bit into his lower lip, and Sherlock lost all thought process. Deft hands roamed his back and descended slowly to his bottom. The hands cupped one of his cheeks and pushed him closer until he felt John's erection on his hip. He broke the kiss, gasping for air. John kissed his jaw and neck and let his hand wander again until it was on the tented front of Sherlock's trousers.
"Smile, Archie!" Molly said as she took a photo with one of those vintage Polaroid instant cameras. She was snapping pictures left and right and showing them to everyone, announcing that "No one takes real photos anymore!"
A knock on the door was followed by Sarah's delicate face peering into the room, now without her cap and mask. She looked worried but she knew better than to ask what was wrong by now.
"We are here to guide the dead, not the living. They have their own choices and paths to take, and we have no control over that." He paused, then looked away again and went on "All lives end. All hearts are broken. Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock."
John felt his stomach twisting, knowing what was to come. He moved along the small room until he saw it. A picture of Harry and Clara in white, holding hands and smiling at each other, and next to it, another picture of them holding hands as well, but with blood covering their faces.
"Because I did it" Greg met his eyes, and John smiled. Because in that moment, he knew exactly what to do.
"You were emotionally involved with him." Sherlock says with a neutral tone, still staring at where James' figure disappeared into the crowd.
The cab stops outside the hotel and they get off. John hesitates, but then makes up his mind and reaches to hold Sherlock's hand in his without a word. Sherlock stiffens for a moment, but John strokes the back of the soft hand with his thumb until he feels it relaxing under his touch. He turns and smiles at Sherlock, who's staring at their joint hands in what looks like fascination.
"No." Attend a party? With people? Nope, Sherlock's had quite enough of that when he used to live with his rich parents, hated it then and hates it now. The only case he'd go is if there is a serial killer lurking among the attendees.
Sherlock sat on a ledge on top of Saint Paul's Cathedral watching the city. He turned to Mycroft quiet abruptly
Heat, so much heat… John Watson is a small ball of fire, sending pleasant warmth into Sherlock's skin. They're a heap of naked bodies on the bed, kissing messily, moaning, and grinding against each other.
Slowly, he opened his eyes, not all the way, just a small crack. He was too scared to see everything just yet. Scared… Yes, fear of the unknown! He was feeling it in his chest and stomach, unlike curiosity, which was mostly located in his head and hands
A scream came from somewhere close. John and Sherlock were on the move again. Moments later, they found the other three men gathered around something. Jake had a torch and was pointing it at Lidiya's also severed head and torso.
"I am. I've actually just accepted a position here at Bart's. I understand you're doing your internship there as well?"
"Yes. Everything he said is true. I killed Lidiya, and yes, it has to do with Amy. That script that Lidiya won the national award for? She stole it from Amy. She stole everything from her and refused to give her any credit, this is why she committed suicide."
Aware of how idiotic this plan was, he was still determined to run into Sherlock again, and so he decided to go to the place where he met him last time.
John opened his eyes slowly, adjusting them to the morning light spilling through the window. For a moment he had no idea where he was, but then he felt the warm body lying in his arms. He buried his nose in the soft curls, inhaling the heady scent. It occurred to him that he did not have one bad dream that night, he had slept like a baby. He wondered if it was because of the thrill they had they day before, or because of being with Sherlock, though he doubted the two could be separated.
John had returned from Afghanistan with a shattered shoulder and a starved addiction to adrenaline. His struggle reached the verge of breakdown before he decided to do something about it. He tried to consider what adrenaline junkies usually did to satisfy their peculiar urges. Some of them played rough sports, but John's rugby days were over the moment a bullet pierced a hole right above his pectoral muscle. Others found jobs that provided a sense of danger similar to that of the war, like security guards, firefighters, and body guards. But one of the reasons that had made John feel balanced and functional in the military was the utilization of his medical skills as well as his combat skills.
The queen of plagiarism strikes again. This is a story is based on an episode of an old show called Medium which I used to love watching, but I will be changing a lot about the characters and plot so it's isn't really the same. As always, comments are welcomed and received with tiny hysterical fits of excitement. Love!
Molly was still dragging John by the hand and was now heading straight for Sherlock's table. John wondered if Greg had set her up for this.
"No." John interrupted in a tone just a bit higher than intended "No, I’m not asking… No." He cleared his throat, feeling Sherlock's suspicious gaze on him.
He claimed John's mouth again and plunged his tongue into it. His orgasm crashed through him like thunder, as he was completely and utterly engulfed by everything John… John… John.
"You understand that by law, I'm obligated to file a report if I feel there's been prisoner misconduct."
"Not very long" Greg said, sounding a bit flustered, which was curious. "But I feel like I've known him forever" he added, as if to make up for his clumsy answer.
"Refreshing, juicy, rich with sweetness, but with a tone of sourness. Tender on your tongue like velvet, but sharp as they dissolve, leaving an aromatic flavor in your mouth" He paused "How is that?"
"Obvious. You don't seem like a man who wears jewelry, and yet you have a silver bracelet. Looks expensive too, you wouldn't waste money on such an item. It's a keepsake, but it wasn't given to you. The expense of it says wife, not girlfriend, but you already said you have never been married when I mentioned it earlier at the crime scene.
"Detective Inspector Watson," the familiar voice of the operator came, sounding impatient, "the superintendent was looking for you. May I connect?"
He was finally able to make out the sentence and hear the question asked from somewhere above him, but all he could do is marvel at the crimson on the tips of his fingers
"I don't think it was a prank." Sherlock's voice was still shaken. He cleared his throat before speaking again. "Does anyone else have a property in the area?" he asked Bill.
Yet it soon become clear that watching John from afar wasn't enough. For some reason, Sherlock was aching to talk to him and see that brilliant smile directed at him. When he saw that pretty doctor kiss John, he felt something hot and unpleasant rise in his chest, and remembered what Mycroft had said "Caring is not an advantage." Maybe he had been right after all, but it couldn't hurt anyone if Sherlock just looked at John, could it? He could just sit back and marvel at the beautiful indigo irises juxtaposed with gold lashes.
Suddenly, she opened bloodshot eyes, dark blue irises that so resembled his own stared at him sadly.
Sherlock stared at the cigarette. He moved his hand to grab it to see how the tiny flame remained lit and what was inside the small tube that seemed to put Greg in such a good mood.
"He got away when he heard Bill and the others approaching. I didn't… I couldn't do anything before checking on you." John explained, still staring at Sherlock, as if fearing he'd disappear any second.
Later, John lied awake in bed, listening to the faint sounds of the street outside. Sarah had fallen asleep hours ago. He looked at her with resentment, because really, how can she sleep so quickly! How can people do that?
As soon as the haze of lust clears off, the waves of misery close in worse than before. He wraps his arms around himself and racks his brain for an explanation, but before he knows it, the comfort of John's bed lulls him into deep sleep.
For a moment, the woman kept smiling and looking at him as if not comprehending. Then, her face transformed horrifically.
"Dr. Watson!" a soft and a bit too enthusiastic voice shouted behind him. He turned around to find himself in yet another hug with a very excited Molly Lestrade.
"What kind of bloody house is located in the middle of this jungle anyway?" Sherlock complained again.
"The window." Bill said, pointing at the bottom of the glass, where a clean circle had been cut just near the lock switch. The window was wide open and was letting in cold wind and sporadic drops of rain.
“Fuck me hard” Sherlock rasped, and John grabbed a bottle of lube from the bedside table. He started preparing Sherlock slowly and gently, first rubbing at his hole as he kissed his neck and chest, then slipping one finger after the other inside, stretching and loosening the muscles, and angling his hand in a way that made Sherlock gasp and thrust up into the air.
"Stop acting like children!" Sherlock snapped at them. He couldn't hear himself thinking with them moaning around him.
Until this point John hadn't said anything, but they had been walking for 10 minutes now and he had no clue what the hell was going on.
"So, how do we play this? You hook me up with a few a few weeks' supply?" he asked rather playfully with a mischievous grin.
They were barely on their feet when Dimmock jumped, launching himself on Sherlock, who met him halfway with a knee aimed at his chest.
"Run" John shouted and Smith bolted through the door leading to the hallway just as the inmates surrounded John, standing between him and the way out. In his head, he pictured the possible scenarios. The only way was the door leading to the office behind him, and inside there was another door, but it was a dead end for all he knew, and they would soon catch up with him. Still, it was his only chance, and his quick reflexes had always got him out of tight corners, even if barely.
"Wrong." Sherlock said "His face was still bandaged, but I grabbed a hold of him, so I can tell you he is of a medium build. We also know he's a man. A woman would not have been physically able to carry Lidiya's body and lift an axe that size above her head so easily unless she was athletic, which I know isn't true because I felt his body."
The image triggered a flash of memories in John's mind. Blood, stained wedding bands, vacant eyes. He shuddered and shook his head, secretly thankful that Anderson wasn't looking in his direction.
"I am." John struggles to take in the new information. Of all places, and after everything that happened, James has come to work at Bart's!
"I just hope you won't be too famous to talk to us soon!" Bill joked and the group laughed and teased Lidiya some more.
All of a sudden, Sherlock leaned in and with a deep inhalation pressed his lips to John's. For a moment they breathed together and through each other, and then John closed his eyes and let Sherlock kiss him in earnest, lips turning and twisting heatedly but gently.
Sherlock noticed that the window's lock switch was off. Why would the intruder open it if he smashed the glass to get in, unless of course he opened it, got outside, and then smashed the glass towards the inside of the room to make it look like he came from outside. It was only further confirmation of his theory, but he needed more. He peered outside to take a look at the wooden railing, and he found two deep grooves in the wood.
"You know you could just walk next to me if you like" Sherlock could hear a smile in his voice, and it was all the invitation he needed.
The sight was too much for John, his body acted of its own accord. He reached his hand into his own sweatpants and started tugging at himself urgently just as he went down and swallowed Sherlock ravenously.
"I'm surprised you didn't kick that bastard's arse, John. That's more your style." Bill said as he fiddled with something in his pocket.
He had just finished with the last patient when he heard voices outside the door. He listened to the conversation intently.
Greg nodded silently, and John had to stop for a moment and marvel at what he was actually saying. He had made peace with it by now, but it was still strange, and more importantly infuriating.
"I want to say goodbye" John's voice broke a little but he continued "I don't want to see you again" he said, and left.
Sherlock felt a delicious tremor run through him as they moved faster, the water around them splashing gently, adding to the composition they were playing with their bodies.
Greg could not stop thinking about what Sherlock said all day. What the hell did he mean? Was this just a ploy to get him to back off and stay away from John? His heart leapt as his phone chime with a text.
and so, this is done, thanks to anyone who's reading. If you think this isn't too bad and I should write more fics please leave a comment or kudos or whatever, I do have ideas for more!
John opened the door to 221B after a long day at the hospital. He was looking forward to seeing Sherlock and basking in the beauty and unconditional love that he emanated.
"Why?" Sherlock noticed then that John had something his hand, but he was distracted as the handsome face came nearer.
"You're good, you know it. Come back on Monday and get back on the horse." Sarah said and kissed his lips
John stepped in front of Sherlock without thinking, he felt anger rise in his chest as he remembered the agony Sherlock was in when he came to the infirmary with a bloody foot.
A few minutes later, Rupert came down the stairs from where he had been fixing the leak on the roof. He too said that he did not see anyone leaving or entering the house other than those standing here.
But how could it be? Sherlock's mind raced frantically, they just saw Lidiya being carried by that man across the window! How did he manage to cut her up like this?
"I might let you have more of him next time. If you continue to behave" Sherlock said with a smirk and closed his eyes as he buried his nose in the blonde hair.
"Have you guys seen Lidiya? I turned away for a minute and she was gone. I'm really worried she might be lost."
Right then, John spotted her and quickly slipped into the lift on his right, Sherlock on his heel. When they got off, John walked straight into a room where a bespectacled chubby doctor stood in the center. The room had a huge glass partition separating it from the hallway outside, and was filled with cradles within which babies slept or stared at the sealing with their twinkling beady eyes, holding their chubby fists in the air.
John was crouching on the bedroom floor, taking photos of the room and bodies from various angles when he heard the front door down stairs. Lestrade's mysterious friend has arrived, it seemed.
Then the smile disappeared and was replaced by a look of such deep concern it made John's heart ache
"Alright. First of all, you all need to stay calm. Lidiya was killed outside, and we should be fine inside as long as we make sure all entrances are locked." John said and everyone started checking all the windows, verandas, and doors.
Sherlock could not feel the cold breeze on his face as he climbed onto the ledge, but he knew he would soon. He lifted his face to the heavens, and spread his arms for one final embrace of life as he knows it.
Amazing. How was this man real? John felt like he was in the presence of an otherworldly being. Sherlock moved with the grace of a ballet dancer, but there was something else about him, as if he was surrounded by a halo separating him from the world. He seemed far and forbidden, but it did not stop John's heart from hammering every time he was on the receiving end of the piercing gaze.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, John could not be more obvious, or more stubborn for that matter. They should have been there by now and they were clearly lost. All trees looked alike, yet John insisted they were on the right track. On top of everything else, there was no mobile phone signal in the whole area.
His phone was ringing, he looked at the clock. It was 5 am. He had left Sherlock's flat not two hours ago and barely got a couple of hours of restless sleep.
What the fuck was he blabbing about? Was he hitting on Greg's friend… whom he had met only today? God, but he hasn’t had a good shag in so long, it must have been getting to his head.
"So, you and John, how are things?" Bill asked as he blew air into his fists to warm them. Sherlock glanced at him suspiciously before turning back to search for a blonde head among the dense trees. He soon spotted Susan's red coat and changed direction, Bill at his heel.
"Oh. I see. Something must have happened to you to make you leave. Emotional trauma. Possibly related to wor…"
"I've known you even longer than I've known Myc, and I've never seen you talk and laugh with someone like you were with that guy."
John pulled Bill into a hug, ruffling his hair while they exchanged insults as an expression of endearment.
"I can see why Greg warned me about you. You're impossible" John shook his head, now genuinely smiling.
“Something you might like. Come by Baker Street at 8, I’ll text you the details.” he said and turned around to catch up with a clueless John
"What I do know is, in the 90-some years prior to that, in fact for as long as they kept records, there wasn't one other case thought to be murder-suicide among couples married more than one year but less than two. Not one." John finished.
"No, you arsehole. I was going to invite you over to dinner with me and Myc, and you could bring that friend of yours we met at the ball. John" Greg smiles and winks.
"Come in" John said as he turned his key in the lock and went inside. Sherlock followed. He had seen John's flat before, but never truly observed it, as he was too occupied with staring at the delightful creature that was John Watson.
John immediately recognized the gaunt face and the greasy long hair. Angelo Costello was one of the most notorious mob bosses in London. He had only been sent to prison after one of his own employees had testified against him in court.
"And don't get me started on those jumpers and cardigans too. You do realize you have the taste of a 90 year old, right?"
Greg paused but John didn't say anything, he was busy inspecting the couple's wedding photographs on the wall and a small collection of DvD's stored in a box on the shelf.
John rode his bike slowly under the blooming trees, breathing in the morning air, and listening to the rustle of leaves above. He cast subtle looks around, but there was no one in the park at that hour.
This seemed to turn into some sort of challenge for Sherlock though. Over the next few days, and every time he came for his shot, he had a new bunch of name choices to badger John about.
He sighs and his hand slides slowly downwards to palm the swell beneath in his pants. He inhales air from John's pillow as he strokes himself slowly, recalling how John pins him down and kisses every inch of his body. His breathing quickens and he bites his lips, imagining the taste of John's mouth on his tongue. His moan is muffled in soft cotton as he comes, John's name whispered between heated sighs.
"It all started with another case I was working on before I came here. We knew the Italian mob had been striking more drug deals lately, bigger even, but no one knew with whom. I traced their transactions to here. Just as I suspected, they've been smuggling the drugs into the prison."
The next day, John found himself waiting anxiously for Sherlock's visit. He tried to dismiss it as the natural excitement to meet a smart interesting person in a very unlikely place, but when he saw the curly head peering through the door again, his stomach flipped and twisted. He couldn't remember the last time he felt like this, like a teenager with a crush.
He then felt John slide sown his mouth Sherlock’s body, getting dangerously close. Greg almost lost his concentration when John’s head was right above his, his mouth inches from Greg’s, as he started sucking Sherlock’s cock. Greg's hand went back into his pants and resumed jerking his cock.
They were coming from Sherlock's bedroom. Greg's legs did not request permission to start walking, and with a few strides, he was standing by the door and turning the knob, feeling like he was in for a treat.
A high-pitched beep came from John's pocket. He retrieved his pager. "I have to go but I'll be right back" He looked at Sherlock "Just stay right there" He said, as if he was expecting Sherlock to vanish right this moment
This must seem strange to people, Sherlock thought, but he couldn't resist an urge to stay as close to John as possible, so he kept walking behind him.
Sherlock decided that his new favorite pastime was to memorize and catalogue every detail about John. He lied in bed next to him, propped on his elbows watching him sleep.
"Oh, not to worry doc., you and your boyfriend here will be just another two victims of this chaos. We even have the law on our side," he let out an ugly laugh, revealing yellow broken teeth.
"I didn't pick up a fight" Sherlock said indignantly "The other prisoner was being deliberately obtuse in answering my questions, so I started to deduce him. He didn't like it" he shrugged.
"I'm sure, John. If she had her choker on when she died then it should have fallen outside, not here where Bill found it. This only more proof the killer is someone here in this house."
He glances at the thin figure as he gets plates and forks from his small kitchen. Sherlock is lying on the small sofa, somehow fitting his gangly limbs in the tiny space. He looks like a big cuddly cat. The shiny raven curls and the piercing eyes both add to the effect. He grimaces as he reads something that must be intriguing, his eyes go a bit crossed, and John decides it's the most adorable thing he has ever seen.
Once again, I've got to apologize for the pretty lousy deductions, but if you have any suggestions or feedback it would be great to hear from you. Love.
"Okay" John looked bashful for a moment. Perhaps he thought Sherlock was offended by the question, but he got up all the same and they started walking.
"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I'm bound to be followed by trouble when I'm with you. Very Halloweeny indeed…"
"Sherlock, this is Dr. James Sholto, he taught me at uni. Dr. Sholto, this is Sherlock, my… um… neighbor." John winces at his own stuttering.
He lets himself follow the impulse and gives the driver different directions. His heart beats and his hands shiver with anticipation. He is going to talk to John.
John had barely taken a couple of steps outside of the operation room before the nurse called him back. The patient had flat lined! He couldn't let the shock freeze him just yet, he had to keep his mind clear. He put on a new apron and pair of gloves and started at the patient again, heart thudding and brain working frantically.
scientific research." Sherlock says petulantly "And now that new bloke won't let me anywhere near the morgue, I know it."
"They both would have died for each other. Nothing complicated about it. They didn't do it to each other. Someone did it to them. Same thing in every case." He gestured at the box.
Three plates laden with food were set in front of Greg, who dug in as if he hadn't eaten in days. He had dragged Sherlock to a restaurant close to the hospital.
"Oh, he's a genius." John shrugs as if this is the most normal thing to say, but he is used to explaining this quite often to people. This and apologize repeatedly to them on his neighbor's behalf.
John woke up with a start, his shoulder sending signals of dull ache to his brain. He looked around as he slowly regained awareness of his surroundings, and he was immediately and vividly reminded of the dream when his eyes fell on two irises glowing in the dark like a cat, staring at him.
Sherlock's world took a deep, sharp tumble into void. The loss of John was like a weight pulling him deeper every day.
"Okay I'd like to run some tests next time you're in. The last thing I want is to be administering insulin to a man who doesn't need it."
John started giggling uncontrollably, possibly due to the rush of adrenaline, and soon Sherlock joined him.
"I think he’s brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones. They’re always so desperate to get caught."
"You see. Rupert is not that stocky around the stomach. It's just a bodysuit. Another benefit of being around props on set. When you ran outside behind us, you hid Lidiya's head under the belly of the fat suit. It was the easiest thing in the world to just dump the head somewhere outside. The other body parts were already scattered there. Simple but brilliant. No one would have ever suspected it was you."
Just before he got in his car he quickly typed a text, hesitating before hitting send, but then thought Sherlock wasn't the kind to want to miss this.
"Mrs. Hudson, will you please stop badgering my guest!" Sherlock's voice came from upstairs just as the music came to a halt.
Greg walked quietly, sat in the chair and watched transfixed as John kissed and bit at Sherlock's exposed neck, his mouth moving in sensual sweeps across the pale skin.
When John became a police officer, his brain had somehow reprogrammed its trigger reactions accordingly. His senses responded sharply and immediately whenever he heard certin noises.
Everything happened so quickly, it felt like it was less than a second. John felt Sherlock's hand nudging his back, at first he didn’t understand, but then he looked at Costello again, and saw a bright red point right above his heart. Snipers outside could see them through the windows, and they must have thought John was being held hostage.
“You cannot and will not do anything unless I tell you. You’re allowed to watch until I tell you otherwise, and then I’ll decide what you’ll have of him. SH”
"May I know why Greg's surgery was delayed to Monday? Is something wrong? Are you not telling us something?" She said all of that extremely fast without breaking eye-contact with John.
The door to the flat upstairs was wide open, and John let himself in, surveying the room as he put everything on the coffee table. Sherlock was standing by the window, still dressed in his impeccable suit and holding a violin in his hand. He looked like a mythical creature in the weak light. His pale eyes seemed to be capable of reflecting every color to ever exist.
"Yes, John. Please, get closer to me" Sherlock said and opened his mouth to taste John's hand. He did not care if that was not a usual part of the love-making ritual to people, he wanted to indulge in the exquisite taste and compare the flavors on different parts of John's body.
"I'd go sleep in Lidiya's room, but I'd rather we stay together." John said, his hand left scratching at his nape.
"Sometimes, I wonder about my life. I lead a small life.  Well, not small, but circumscribed.  And sometimes I wonder, do I do it because I like it, or because I haven't been brave? I feel like there should have been more to it than this. Maybe I should have joined the military like I've always imagined I would after all, but the truth is, right now it feels like… nothing ever happens to me"
So, when his ear caught the soft click of a gun's safety catch being turned off, he opened his eyes, immediately trying to register his surroundings.
"It is hard to remove the smell of gun powder entirely from one's hands, especially if they're constantly '
"I'm okay, I tripped on something." John's voice came from somewhere ahead and Sherlock followed it. He took out his phone and turned on the flash light. Finally, he was able to see John kneeling on the grass. He ran to help him up.
"I cut… I cut you… I cut you with that knife! I felt it go in" He stammered hysterically "You felt it!"
Hugs and kisses to whoever's reading! I hope your coffee is delicious and your pillow is fluffy and your hair is on point, happy weekend <3
"Stop provoking inmates and officers, or you're going to get killed in here, you know" John did not know why he said this, but it felt necessary to say it anyway.
"Alright then." Jake crossed his arms defensively "If he is one of us, then how were we all able to see him pass by the window with Lidiya?"
"They're both in sitting positions, so they were both awake when they were killed. Assuming the husband did this, he would have had to stand by the bed to shoot the wife, why would he shoot her while sitting so close to her like that, twisting his arm to get the right angle. Makes no sense. More importantly, the blood pattern on the headboard and wall clearly suggests that the bullet came from a higher angle, not one that was at the same level as her head."
Everyone but John and Sherlock stared at him in shock. And Lidiya's fork fell on the floor with a loud clatter.
They sit and have dinner together and talk, Sherlock tells him about his latest cases, and John listens, unintentionally muttering "amazing" and "brilliant" between lines and bites of food.
When he asked Anderson if he had spotted them lying around, the nurse gave him the look… that look, the one saying he had fucked up. On the first day on the job John was lectured by the warden and almost everyone working at Pentonville about the importance of keeping keys safe and out of reach of prisoners.
"What?" Sherlock's tone was sharper than intended. The others, who were still engaged in conversation about the murderer turned to him.
John was quiet for a moment, but he couldn’t resist the urge to ask the question that was bothering him the most.
John was getting out of the shower, wearing nothing but a towel around his waist. In a matter of five seconds, they locked eyes, and then Sherlock was crowding him against the wall and pushing the towel down as he kissed him feverishly. Turned out Sherlock was wearing nothing but the sheet that was hugging his lean body, and so things escalated.
John eventually sent him off with antibiotics and a bad limp. In truth there was nothing more he could do, inmates showed up with much worse injuries on a regular basis, but never sought help or revealed their assailants. It was common conviction or a code of some sort that one ought to seek his own revenge, but never involve CO's in it. Therefore, John did not ask further question lest he gets Sherlock in even more trouble, but he could not ignore a strong instinct to try to help him.
"I'll just take a moment to catch my breath" he said panting "Breath!" he giggled, and the woman's eyes went wider
They joined the others at the table, Sherlock sat next to John. He had no intention of letting him out of his sight as long as they were in that damn place. He surveyed the group. Everyone looked tense, exhausted, and terrified. There was no way to tell for sure if any of them was the culprit, but all the clues led to that conclusion.
The speakers outside on the premises were repeatedly sounding a warning now: "New prisoners arrive in five minutes. All prisoners must remain at least 40 feet away from the gate." John watched the scene through the window. Soon, the long grey bus was making its way through the gate, past the checkpoints, until it stopped with a squeak inside the yard. The prisoners started filing out in a neat line, hands cuffed together in front of them. Even from that distance, John could sense their fear and trepidation. Those feelings were unfortunately quite justified for numerous reasons.
John was starting to lose control, but the man did not seem to hear him or want to respond to him in any way. He decided to leave the room before he'd lose his temper.
She leaned in and kissed him, and he kissed her back, still trying to wrap his head around all of this.
Right. He had to explain, He wished so badly he had an explanation that would give them solace and closure, but what could he say? He had not understood what happened there.
Sherlock and John followed him through the dark to where he stood by the bridge. However, there was no bridge anymore. It had fallen down and the frail ropes were being washed away by the rising stream below.
Sherlock peered into the microscope where John was looking moments ago. It was bright, and through it, he saw a galaxy of bright spheres dancing slowly. It was astonishing
Quickly and smoothly, John slipped into focus and precision as he worked on the patient. He breathed evenly as he made the first incision. This was the thing he did best, and he was simply in his element, his delicate yet competent hands worked the different scalpels, retractors, and clamps. Everything was going well. John sighed in relief behind his mask as he backed up, leaving the assistant surgeon to stitch the patient up.
"Just trying to fly low, avoid the radar. Do my time and get out." John recognized Sherlock's distinguished voice and posh accent.
Sherlock feasted his eyes on the beautiful features. It was dark and quiet, and John was lying in bed, staring into the space ahead and whispering desperately into the void.
"Reckon I should introduce myself" Greg said with a mouth full of sausage and extended his hand over the table to Sherlock, who took it reluctantly.
"You'd better be careful Holmes, with a mouth like that you won't last long in here" Officer Dimmock sneered.
"What?" Sherlock unintentionally snapped. His heart was thrumming madly and he felt his lips twitching involuntarily into a pout.
Sherlock's eyes opened slowly as he felt John's hand stir under his. Two days and too many arguments with nurses later, he still hadn't left his side.
"So, where are you from?" Molly asked while handing everyone drinks, and John waited eagerly to hear the answer.
So, it belonged to someone close, Not your father, this is a young man’s item, brother, then. The encryption says from Clara to Harry… definitely a married couple, but why are YOU wearing it? Since the bracelet was originally owned by Harry then he must be deceased, and considering your obsession with this string of deaths for the past two years, I can deduce Harry and Clara were the first victims… two years ago."
"Right. Then how come you're hanging around my room all the time? I'm the only one with his arse hanging out of a dress" he said petulantly.
John stopped for a moment, and looked at Sherlock with hooded eyes, gently swiping his thumb over his lower lip.
After some waiting, the coast seemed clear, Sherlock had peered through the door to see if anyone was outside before he told John he would get him out through the visitation room.
Sherlock nodded "I need to answer two questions first though. First, how he managed to pass by the window with Lidiya while we were all in the dining room watching, and second, why he's after you."
Sherlock felt it coming, all his muscles tightened. Heat, ten folded, ran through his veins. His hips bucked into the sensation. It was as if lightning struck him with pleasure, he could feel the electricity everywhere, his toes clenched with it, and he felt something hot spurt between them in the water.
"He was a brilliant surgeon though at the start of his career, he was the best. But one day he lost a patient on his table. It was a routine surgery… text book. No one knew what happened. They started an investigation, but nothing was certain."
Pressing his leg to Sherlock's stomach, John shoved him suddenly off the bed and onto the floor, pointed the gun and shot Jefferson right between his eyes, but not before he felt raging fire cutting a hole in his left shoulder.
He put his arms around John's torso and pulled him until their chests were flushed against each other, and Sherlock could feel the erect cock on his belly and his… oh! He was hard too, extremely hard in fact, which explained the curious sensation of ache, pleasure, and throbbing that was between his legs.
He was angry that his distress was so obvious, frustrated with how distracted he had been, and most of all just simply miserable.
Sherlock watched him as he made a tiny cut on his finger and squeezed two drops of crimson on a slide.
Greg was the first to regain his wits and tucked himself in hastily. He wanted to leave before it began to feel awkward and they had to 'talk about it' or something. But right as he crossed the bedroom door, he heard Sherlock's voice calling him. He turned around. John was lying in Sherlock's arms, his breath slow and deep and his eyes shut, clearly dozing.
Sherlock's face was pale, but it wasn't the gorgeous paleness that always made him glow. He looked ill and malnourished, with small cuts and bruises on his cheek, mouth, and brow.
So, things were worse than usual. The prisoners whooped and cheered around him. John exchanged a quick look with Smith, who continued talking over the radio
John smiled again “Well, you'd better get out of here, Sherlock, or security's going to think you're a psych patient”
Damn it! He should have tied him up or something. Anything to keep him from disappearing like a bloody ghost again!
"You're incredible you know that" John said, but his smile looked sad and strained, and he was unconsciously stroking the metal around his right wrist.
"Dull. And those are NOT road kills. I would think being a doctor, you'd appreciate some scientific curiosity." Sherlock counters as he gets up and starts stealing meatballs from John's plate.
"Maybe your friend Murray is already in the Halloween spirit and wanted to prank us." Sherlock suggested as they continued walking to the house.
John glanced along the path ahead, and there he was… there was Sherlock again. Whatever deity is out there, John secretly thanked it as he spotted the long graceful silhouette standing, as if waiting.
Molly, the girl who works at Bart's morgue has just been replaced by a very strict by-the-book pathologist by the name of Mike Stamford, and this just won't do.
John shifted to kiss his forehead, and Sherlock shivered, nuzzling into his neck and inhaling his scent. Soon, they both slipped into deep sleep.
Suddenly the woman gave him a strangely cunning smile and a wink that did not look the least appropriate on her kind, delicate face. John frowned.
He fell silent. He didn't want to reveal his suspicion that the murderer was in the room just yet. He didn't want to prompt whoever it was to do something before he could be sure about his identity.
John walked towards Sherlock. A strand of gold sleek hair hung across the lovely forehead, highlighting the contrast between all the gold and sapphire. It reminded Sherlock of the dawn ritual.
Theses pains were too spread across to pinpoint in one place. Other pains were different. They stung like a hot needle on the side of his lip, above his left eye, and on the tips of his fingers. These felt hot and piercing, calling for more attention.
"Come one. Let's get back. It's better if we all stay together until we figure this out." John led the way and they all followed.
"No?" Sherlock still had his hand cupped around John's head, and his eyes were soft and heavy-lidded.
"Um... I can't remember, some of them were changing and I looked away and shut the doors quickly." He fell silent, but he furrowed his brows as if he was remembering something.
"She was pregnant. Why would he take the time to paint a room for his unborn child if he had been planning to end their lives?"
Greg looked reluctant and lost for words for a bit, but he seemed to make up his mind as he began talking again.
Sherlock frowned at the question, but the people standing above him were now looking behind them at a medic who appeared out of nowhere
When they reached the basement, Bill quickly restarted the generator and the lights were back on, but on their way back, they heard loud noises from the dining room. They found the group gathered around the huge window. The same one the killer had passed by when he took Lidiya away. But this time, it was completely shattered and pieces of glass littered the floor.
"I could feel her blood, it was so warm and she fell in my arms. I killed her!" Henry said, tears now falling from his dead eyes.
"Is this okay?" He asked into the skin under Sherlock's ear. Sherlock hummed in response because that was all he was capable of with John practically worshipping him like that.
"I'm okay. Here, give me that, what did I trip on?" John grabbed the phone from Sherlock's hand and the puddle of light spilled on the ground.
"How is the diet, Mycroft?" It was a feeble blow, but it was all Sherlock had. He refused to blush or fidget nervously in front of Mycroft. Because yes, John has been spending a delightfully unreasonable amount of time at Baker Street with Sherlock over the past ten days, and Sherlock could not have been happier about it.
"I know" John's face went pink. "I just froze for some reason. Thankfully Sherlock was there to save my life."
"Mrs. Wilson?" He said to the red-headed woman sitting on the chair. Next to her sat a younger woman who had to be the daughter. Mrs. Wilson looked cheerful and unperturbed, oh god, she wasn't worried at all!
John blinked as he watched Sherlock smile fondly at him "I underestimated you," he said, still smiling "I shouldn’t have thought you wouldn't suspect anything. No, you're too smart"
It was minutes… or maybe hours later, when Sherlock opened his eyes with a jolt. He was lying almost on top of John, with his head on his doctor's warm chest. He knew he woke up for a reason, so he lifted his head to survey the room.
"What were you investigating in the infirmary?" he whispered in the dark as he slid down the wall and sat on the floor. He felt Sherlock moving to sit next to him.
"Mr. Henry Knight remains the only exception in my experiments. He was the only one to pull the trigger. Your sister and her wife were the first. Oh, it was most fascinating. How one person could actually die for another. Don't you think?"
"Yes well, Serial killers are always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake. That's why they're fun."
"What happened?" he asks and finally meets his eyes. His face is filled with curiosity, but also with something else… some savage emotion that John cannot name.
They went into the bedroom, where the young woman was lying in bed, the sheets around her were smudged in crimson.
"John," Sherlock leaned back to look at him properly "I… I care. I care so much. I don't know what I would have done…" He struggled to find the right words. He didn't know how to say this. The feeling was so immense that it couldn't possibly be put into a proper sentence
There is finality in his tone and John doesn't ask. For all he knows, anyone with intelligence equal to Sherlock's can run the world, let alone a country.
"Show me the file of your brother and his wife." Sherlock said, handing the file he already read back to John "They were the first couple weren't they?"
"Sherlock, wait just one moment." Greg grabs his arm to stop him. Sherlock doesn't meet his eye and just stares at the cab door handle.
"Oh, about 10 seconds. Slide this drip into the meter and we're ready to go." John answered, holding out the device so that Sherlock could see. The screen said "Processing."
He let his lips drag over the taut muscles of the gorgeous body until it hit something soft and hard, making Sherlock shudder and grab his shoulders harder.
"I came to take Mr. Wilson... and I saw you" Sherlock said miserably, feeling hurt and despair closing in. "I couldn't take my eyes off you. How you fought for him… And you looked right at me... like I was a man!"
The man turned around and earth halted. John froze as if suspended in a bubble as he gazed at the sight before him. He wondered if his sleep-deprived brain was hallucinating the man standing there.
John couldn't wait either even if he wanted to. He pulled Sherlock's underwear down and was finally able to drink in the whole view.
For a moment John was a bit startled. He hadn't really known what to expect when Greg told him about some friend who can help with the case, but he definitely did not expect a young man looking like a super model, sauntering into the crime scene as if it was his living room. They shook hands and John tried not to stare.
Dazed, he leans and tries to catch John's lips with his mouth, but John moves back abruptly. The bastard.
Sherlock closed his eyes too, imagining just for a second that he was really with John, a life of nothing but bliss and wonder, truly his…
He groaned with frustration as he flipped and tossed everything in his office and the infirmary looking for them. His chain had several critical keys, one of which was the key to the infirmary.
"I was looking for someone to get me to you." He answered weakly "and some men beat me up. They thought I had money, but I didn't"
He had turned around to leave at least five times before finally deciding to ring the bell. He told himself he had come this far anyway, might as well enjoy himself.
"Look, I don't know what it is exactly you do with Greg, I don't know what your specialty is, forensics? Linguistics? Criminology? Maybe you were with the SIS for all I know. Me? I'm just a cop, not a specialist. I can tell you that I could look at a suspect from 30 feet away and tell you if he's going to pull out a gun on me in the next 10 seconds, and I'd be always right. Instinct. It got me this far, so I listen to it."
He lined his cock up with the slippery soft ring, and started a maddeningly slow penetration, cursing under his breath as he slid his glorious cock inside Sherlock’s body.
"John!" Sherlock screamed at the top of his lungs, making the stranger turn his face to him, though he still continued to lift the axe back above his head in preparation for the strike.
He stood at the entrance for a moment, his nose registering a strong smell of ink and chemicals, and his eyes attempting to adjust themselves to the darkness. Behind him, Sherlock clicked the light on and they could finally get a full view of the horrible scene. The walls were covered in photos of couples, both on their wedding days and on the days they were murdered.
"Dimmock, are you insane? Do you really think you won't get caught?" John stared incredulously as the officer stood next to Costello.
Sherlock watched him pace, running his fingers through silver blonde hair, until he finally collapsed on the stairs with a shuddering breath. Sherlock kneeled in front of him. He wanted to see if John could look at him again… see him, so he waved a hand slowly between them, but John didn't seem to notice anything. He looked lost and tired and anguished as he gazed into nothingness. Sherlock had never seen so much emotion in one human face, it was amazing.
"Call the police. Now!" he instructed. He turned back just in time to see John running towards the thick wall of trees ahead.
Once the decision is made to abandon the pants, Sherlock quickly throws on his shirt and slips into his trousers. He is fastening his last button when a voice comes from the bed behind him.
All three men mumbled greetings to John and Sherlock. Max was dark, tall, and strikingly handsome. Rupert was almost the exact opposite. He was pale, short, and particularly stocky around the stomach area. His fingernails and eye bags told Sherlock he struggled with depression and often resorted to food for comfort. Jake was blonde and wore thick glasses. Sherlock noticed he kept fidgeting in his chair.
Sherlock reached a hand and threaded his fingers through John's hair, just as he bit delicately on his lower lip, but at that moment John suddenly became conscious of what he was doing and he pulled back abruptly.
"Tell me what happened. Why are you home, then?" he asks in a neutral tone as if he hasn't spent the last five minutes mercilessly tantalizing Sherlock.
"I… oh" he tipped his head back onto the edge of the tub as John continued licking and biting at his neck and chest "I can't"
Once he was fully inside, John started moving his massive cock in and out of the tight hole. Greg was in full view of the point where they were joint, watching open-mouthed as John's dick moved smoothly, sometimes in shallow thrusts that were clearly aimed to pound into Sherlock's prostate. It was obviously effective, as Sherlock grabbed John's arse cheeks and started pulling him harder, with desperate ah's and oh's.
"Oh, I'm glad you asked Mr. Holmes. You see, I have very meticulous standards. First, I photograph the couple's wedding, watch them exchanges vows and promise eternal love. I then watch them closely to see if they fit the profile. I wait one year, and pay them a visit." He paused and looked at John with a small smile.
John sat next to Sherlock, as if this was a normal thing to do and did not just fill Sherlock with waves of jubilation.
For some reason, or perhaps for reasons known by all but spoken by none, guards perceived the fresh wave with a predatory look equal to that of old inmates. This was John's first time witnessing the arrival of new men at the prison, as he had only been working there for two months.
"No. You were in your REM stage of sleep judging by the continuous movements of your eyes, plus rapid respiration, face expression, and restlessness. What were you dreaming about?"
"You're 10 minutes late. You've stopped by somewhere, but it wasn't far. You hold whatever you brought delicately so it must be tender or breakable. Obviously you wouldn't buy eggs now, and we still have some anyway. Fruit then, since it's in a paper bag, red, judging by the smudge on the tips of your fingers. Strawberries, because you like them most."
"Are you sure the killer is not just making you think he's an outsider? Just use your brains a little. You thought he went inside our room after he climbed a tree, used a glass cutter, and sneaked in through the window. And yet the floor was spotless afterwards. He did not drag a speck inside, did he?"
Sherlock’s hips pushed up one last time, and he came in John’s mouth with a scream. Greg didn’t let go, and neither did John, they persisted, until Sherlock's body started twitching in discomfort, cock completely milked by John's warm mouth.
Everyone retired to their bedroom for some rest after double checking that the house was secure. John and Sherlock headed to their room as well.
"John!" Sherlock took John's arm and dragged him to the far end of the room, out of everyone's earshot. "When we got here, you walked in on some of the guests in their bedrooms."
He began with small licks, afraid that this would be over too soon, and caught with the tip of his tongue the thin stream of cum that was running from Sherlock’s pink ring of muscles.
The fancy hall is already buzzing with guests in sparkling dresses and dark suits. John heads to get drinks but Sherlock grabs his arm to stop him
Lidiya was taller and lankier than Susan. She was wearing a black velvet choker that made her neck look even longer than it was. Her delicate thin fingers twitched unnoticeably (not to Sherlock though) as she smiled to them.
"Harder" He commanded, and John complied. He started pounding so hard into Sherlock, the thin pale body was being pushed slightly up the bed with every thrust. He was obscenely loud, moaning, and calling John’s name in unabashed pleasure
"So, you've been coming to the infirmary for your investigation. And I was what? A tool for you to use in the process?"
Sherlock looked around in panic, and John took the opportunity to grab his hand, which was still pale and perfectly unharmed. John stared.
"And by YOUR specimens, I suppose you mean cadavers people have generously donated for the sake of scientific research, not the entertainment of a bored detective without cases."
"You are just back from the war, and between an abysmal military pension and this job you must only be able to afford a small flat where you keep a gun around that you constantly handle and even consider using. There is no way someone is visiting you often or else they would notice and do something about it. That said, with your PTSD and trust issue, there is very little chance you'd have met someone and started a relationship with them so soon after getting back."
"It's okay sweetheart. I've got you" John said softly and increased the speed and pressure. His hand slid up a bit on their erections, and held both so the heads were touching. It made Sherlock scream as the sensation overwhelmed him.
Sherlock ignores him and rests his forehead on his right shoulder. He pushes his hand lower still until he is palming the bulge between John's legs.
He leaves one hand pressed next to John's head on the wall and trails the other down his lovely neck, and then further down to feel muscles moving softly over the heaving chest. He breaks the kiss and John almost whimpers and looks up at him, already drunk with lust.
It's not something personal, it's to do with work. You've stayed late without planning to beforehand, yet no one is calling or texting you in concern, or else you would be holding your phone or carrying it in your pocket at least. Instead you've discarded it in your backpack. So, no one waiting at home, not family or girlfriend-related.
"As I said, you don't really fit my criteria, you're not even married. But I was watching you. I saw you at my flat and I couldn't resist. You looked like you could be worshipping at his feet." He gestured at Sherlock again "It was an absolutely fascinating display. I had to include you in my experiment."
John felt something cold being pressed into his left hand. He turned his head to find Hope shoving a gun in it, but still pointing the other gun at them. Jefferson grabbed John's hand, pointing the gun in it at Sherlock's head.
"Exactly. They were supposed to be selling out here. All their clothes are wet from the rain except for their backs, where they had packs to carry the drugs. Someone tracked them down and took the bags."
"Well, yeah. Who could say no to this excellent location" John said, and they both giggled quietly and held each other closer.
Sherlock smiled to himself as he watched John avoid Molly Lestrade throughout the day. She had been nagging and bombarding him with questions about her husband all day.
But John kept on running. Soon, they could hear Jake, Max, and Rupert moving around them in the dark, but it was difficult to tell where each of them was standing.
"I don't know what you're talking about," Sherlock glared, knowing exactly what Mycroft was on about.
John gets home after a long day at the hospital. His shift has been even more exhausting than usual, and he just wants to lie down and not think of anything until next morning. Maybe he'll pop in on Sherlock, he thinks smiling to himself, and watch crap telly with him or look at his disgusting experiments.
Greg had somehow convinced Sherlock to take him to the top of a towering building. He took out a cigarette, and started pulling deep breaths and puffing out smoke with relish as they watched the glittering lights beneath.
Greg hadn't said anything, he had just told him to come to Harry's flat, no explanation. Nothing. He ascended the stairs slowly, trying to tell himself everything would be alright, but his instincts knew better.
Over the following days, John did his best to avoid Sherlock. He needed to think of his next step and therefore asked Anderson to give him his shots under various pretexts.
They got out of the office and barely managed to cross the hallway and hide behind an alcove before someone appeared on the other end. They couldn't get a good look at whoever it was from where they were hiding.
He tried to clear his head, but all he could do was think of when he would get to see Sherlock again.
"Don't you really? I seem to notice you have decided to expand your clientele, though I don't think it would be accurate to call D.I. Watson a client, really."
He lifted his face and brushed his mouth against the hollow of Sherlock's temple. He traced the line of Sherlock's cheekbone gently, gliding his lips on the soft skin. He then looked up into the strange mesmerizing eyes, and just like that, his lips were against Sherlock's perfect mouth.
"Okay." John nods and stares at the floor for a moment before he locks eyes with Sherlock again "Just so you know, I didn't want to break it off, I wanted…" he pauses and shakes his head again like he's trying to stop himself from saying something "But never mind. It's good to know this was just a game to you."
John grabbed his waist and pulled him down a bit. He started kissing and licking at his balls and perineum before he moved gently to the tight ring of muscle. Sherlock moaned embarrassingly loudly at the feel of John's tongue caressing his hole softly but hungrily. He could not help moving and swirling his hips on John's mouth, relishing the soft groans John was making. John stopped for a moment, hands going up and down Sherlock's flanks.
At any rate, there were other pressing matters at hand. A storm was coming, and everyone at Pentonville recognized the calm before storms. The atmosphere at the facility was charged with tension and anticipation. John found it rather fascinating, like watching animals crouching, getting ready to pounce at each other. Prisoners fought over things like money, drugs, race, or just sheer boredom. Sometimes they had demands when they pulled a full-fledged riot, but other times they were just too pent-up. Anyway, it was just a matter of when a lockdown was going to happen really.
"He can fall. He can give up his existence as he knows it… give up eternity and become... one of us."
"But that's ridiculous, how could they possibly do that with all the security measures around here?" John asked.
They ascended the stairs to the second floor, hauling their bags with them. Several doors were lined up along the aisle. John distractedly opened the first one and peered inside, only to back off immediately, ears pink and shooting apologies at whoever was in there. Sherlock watched in amusement as John turned to the second door and opened it as well. Again, he backed off, apologizing, but he was less embarrassed this time.
John walked toward the waiting room, trying his best to stop his hands from twitching. He ran a shaky hand through his hair.
"I suppose I've always known this was never going to be enough for you. You were always too thirsty to see more"
"Just to take a look at your blood sugar, make sure everything's alright" John said even as he planted the needle in Sherlock's arm. He then proceeded to place the lancing pen on his finger to take a blood sample.
"You'll simply have to talk to him for me then." Sherlock tries to inflict as much confidence as he can into the statement, but he can see John's lips twisting in an evil smile again.
He surveyed the place, stopping at a small bookcase filled with mystery novels, many of them by an author called Agatha Christie.
"Yeah" Greg sighed and John cringed at the look of sympathy verging on pity that he gave him. "But why are you the only one who sees it?"
"Lidiya had her choker on when the murderer carried her past the window." Sherlock whispered so that only John and Bill could hear him.
At this point John was hovering over his long body, but when their bodies brushed he felt Sherlock's very hard erection against his hip.
"We… were able to restore blood flow to the heart, but… he developed a lethal arrhythmia, and we couldn't resuscitate him."
He came closer, feeling his breath catch and his eyes sting. He wanted to comfort her one last time, to tell her he's sorry for not protecting her this time.
His mind was still not recovered from the storm of confusion and hurt, yet he was haunted by Sherlock's face everywhere he went. His imagination creating an illusion of the long slender figure in random places, but Sherlock had vanished as suddenly as he had appeared in John's life.
"First he kills Lidiya, then he attacks John and Sherlock. What is this maniac planning to do?" Max said as he rubbed his hands together nervously.
Greg dragged him through the house, introducing him to friends and relatives with words like "guardian angel" used very loosely if John could say so, but he was too distracted looking for emerald eyes amidst the rowdy party.
They get a cab home, and Sherlock stares outside the window distractedly. Misery washes over him in waves. If he could just understand why.
John looks in the mirror nervously. He never dresses up and it just feels odd to wear a suit and tie. He runs a hand through his hair to tamp down the stray strands, but they won't budge and they just stick up again.
One of his hands went down Sherlock's cheek, down his neck, onto his chest and lifted the loose him of his T-shirt. Moments later John had a feast of pale skin laid beneath him, he groaned as he dragged his mouth and nose all over the delicious torso.
Sherlock blinks his dark lashes multiple times quickly, staring at John like he's never seen him before. This goes on for longer than expected. Seconds pass and Sherlock still stares.
"No, come here, up here" he said grabbing Sherlock's biceps and gently guiding him up the bed so that he was kneeling directly above John's face.
Greg lost all control and in a second, was on his knees. He grabbed Sherlock’s thighs and dragged him down to the edge of the bed until he had the exposed groin close and at the same level as his mouth. Then he wasted no time, and buried his face in the warm dusky skin between his arse cheeks.
"Look at this place, they'd just renovated. Why would a man invest in a home if he wanted to kill his wife and himself, and…" He stopped and abruptly walked out of the room, there was something he needed to find. John was right behind him when he opened a door to a smaller room next to the master bedroom. It was empty, but clearly just recently repainted with a light shade of pink.
"Thank you officer, I'll take it from here" He said to Dimmock. John never liked the man. He was foul and cruel, and rumors of him assaulting prisoners always seemed to have real basis to them.
"My daddy is a detective. He solves murders and sees lots of dead people. Have you ever seen a dead person?"
Interesting as it might have been, Sherlock didn't have time for this conversation. John and Susan were leaving his sight, turning between trees and bushes.
So it wasn't a game to John. Maybe, just maybe, the great Sherlock Homes has misread this entire situation.
"You know, hanging around with you can teach a bloke a trick or two." John says, stretching his arm to shut the door behind Sherlock. He is practically crowding him against it, stepping unnervingly close. Sherlock can smell minty shampoo and danger, but he tries to keep his face straight and unreadable.
The receptionist was startled at the movement and looked like she was about to kick him out, but as he glanced behind her he saw a familiar face
"Nope. Send him in." John said without breaking eye contact. He relished a trace of trepidation passing through Sherlock's face, but disappearing just as quickly. Huh, it's on then, he thought to himself.
"I don't want to hurt you" Sherlock said, and his beautiful face was filled with sorrow. It made John want to touch him so badly it hurt.
"You can sit and watch as we agreed until I tell you otherwise." Sherlock said and didn't wait for an answer, but resumed snogging John with a deep sigh.
John stormed out of the operation room and headed for the break room, his anger getting the best of him.
John reached a hand and immediately felt the hot blood streaming from his chest, but just as he reached for his supplies, he felt a hot sharp pain cutting through him like a spear. His whole being shook and he was thrown back on the dirt next to Jefferson.
He was. Greg stood frozen, staring at John and Sherlock locked in an embrace on the bed. John was on top of Sherlock's body, moving minutely as he kissed him. They were kissing so warmly, so lovingly, and yet it was the sexiest thing he'd ever seen.
John glanced from where the needle was still planted in the pale arm to see a look of amusement on Sherlock's face.
Sherlock Holmes knows jealousy. It's fairly simple. He understands it the way he understands a chemical reaction, though certain variables may not be as predictable as chemistry when it comes to human emotion, but it's fairly simple in the end. What people usually miss, as they often see but do not observe, is that jealousy is a mere equation. Love minus satisfaction, love plus hate, love multiplied by anger. It is a main trigger to murder, and this is why it is both interesting and important.
And then Jon was kissing him again, stronger and more passionate this time. He ran a hot tongue on Sherlock's closed lips, making him shiver and open his mouth instinctively. Then, something strange happened. Sherlock felt a dire urge to taste the wet soft tongue, and he couldn't stop himself from chasing it into John's mouth. He sucked on it for a moment before opening his eyes and looking at John, searching his face for disapproval, but John looked as wrecked as he felt, and he plunged his tongue into Sherlock's mouth, tasting, licking, and biting urgently.
"What? What is it now? Am I thinking too loudly for your highness?" Greg answered, unable to hide what had slowly grown into resentment against the handsome, genius, bloody perfect Mr. Sherlock Holmes, with his shiny curls and his gorgeous alien eyes. God! Greg had to get a grip and stop acting like a bloody teenager
Suddenly, he was flat on his back looking at an unfamiliar ceiling. He felt someone drag him inside, and tried to resist and aim a kick at whoever it was until he recognized the pale eyes staring at him. It was Sherlock.
"I play the violin, and sometimes I don't speak for days on end" Sherlock suddenly said in a perfectly neutral voice.
"It's funny" he said, his back turned to Sherlock, looking at the frames hanging on the walls, "I always end up looking at their wedding photos, and they're always lovely. Harry had one similar to this." He pointed at a picture of the late Mrs. Knight where she had her back turned to the camera, her dress tails trailing behind her elegantly.
"Glasgow was nice, but I had to get back to London at some point, there were too many important things I left behind." He meets John's eyes as he says this.
John took a step forward, his whole being pulled into the orbit of the other body. He took a deep breath and spoke again.
He laughs and Sherlock's breath catches, because he can't take it anymore. How is he supposed to resist this? He cannot avoid John Watson any more than he can avoid a locked-room triple homicide.
"Inmates in cell block are compromised lockdown and breached A-wing through the guard's station. A-wing is shutting down"
The hours afterwards were the longest in John's life. They police stormed the building and ended the riot. Dimmock was arrested and taken away, and Sherlock was being scolded by the owner of the posh voice from the helicopter, who turned out to be his (true to Sherlock's words) obnoxious older brother.
"Hey" John opened his eyes halfway, his words lazy and sleep-addled. "Can't sleep?" he asked, and without waiting for an answer, he lifted the hand lying on the bed between them to stroke Sherlock's face tenderly. Sherlock sighed, leaning into the touch, and found himself moving closer until he was engulfed in John's arms and warmth.
"John" Sherlock's voice was harsh as he thrashed on the bed, moving to get John to touch more of him.
"Are you a visitor?" he said hoping his voice did not reveal the bewilderment that had yet to dissipate from his mind.
"You point a gun at someone's head and tell them to kill their spouse or else you'll kill them. Yes I can see, how very truly groundbreaking." Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Hello! So, I'm still not sure how to use archive warnings... I mean, this fic has some violence in it, but not half of what you could see in any movie on TV any time of the day, so I don't know, I didn't use any warnings, but right now I feel like I should warn you, this chapter has some angst, some violence, and some poorly written porn. Be prepared!
"Yeah, yeah" John huffs as he slumps back on the bed "You're happily married to your work. I highly doubt your work makes you orgasm three times in one night though." He lifts his arms to support the back of his head, and the sheets give up and slip completely off onto the floor.
Yes. It would be most inconvenient to disturb this arrangement. Yes. That's probably it. Sherlock sighs in relief. Theory accepted.
Rather than saying anything, Sherlock turned his head to Greg, who was in quite the state, staring between John's spent cock and Sherlock's still erect one. His breathing was heavy and erratic, and his eyes were roaming John’s body with hunger. He had his hand shoved inside his pants, wanking furiously, and he licked his lips repeatedly while doing so
The world is a mystery that will never be unraveled. The smell of dry tree leaves, the taste of a hot cup of coffee, the feeling of freshly washed linen. Puzzles everywhere, secrets in fluttering wings and slow kisses and the sound of wind.
He sees a pattern where others see only random tragedy. He can't find proof but he won't believe anyone who'd tell him otherwise either."
his broad shoulders twitched a couple of times with the aftershocks, then he regained himself slowly, and started kissing Sherlock’s eyes and cheeks and neck softly just as he slipped free out of him
"We'll go back to the house together. Stay close. We'll call the police, and then we'll simply leave."
"I'm a consulting detective, I work with the police. I'm under cover on a case I've been following for some time now"
Data: John met his ex when he was supposed to be spending time with Sherlock. Observation: Ex is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Obvious. A very skilled one too, probably renowned in his field. He is good-looking and fit. Played a sort of competitive sport at some point of his life, possibly football judging by his muscly strong-looking legs.  He taught John at university. Age gap and a somewhat frowned upon affair made them discreet about it. Problem: Sherlock feels miserable and angry and cannot stop imagining John with James Sholto. It makes him feel alone.
Greg latched on with his lips, sucking the pink ring as his tongue probed deeper chasing after whatever was left of John’s essence, and hoping against hope their mouths would meet somehow on Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock smiled weakly at this. After all this time, Mycroft was still trying to protect him. To spare him the pain that came with associating with the unpredictable and messy creatures that were humans. Sherlock had had Mycroft on his side for as long as he could remember. He never tried to question or explain it, but he believed he would always count on that unconditional affection and guidance. It was surprising, really, that Mycroft didn't understand Sherlock's love for John, when he himself had given Sherlock nothing but love and protection.
Back at his flat, John sat in a comfortable chair, head thrown back, and a cup of tea in his hand. Sherlock sat opposite him, wondering how a mortal could look so angelic. Once more, he tuned in to John's beautiful brain. He had grown addicted to the lovely swirl of thoughts, random but fascinating. However John's thoughts right then were serene murmurs, almost like a prayer:
John could not believe his eyes. Sherlock had lost the shimmering halo that always surrounded him, he was more defined, more real, and well… more alive, and had never looked more beautiful.
"True, but she was already dead. He attached her to a dummy wearing the same bandages and black cape. Then, using two guide wires that he tied to the balcony railings and the roof above, he made the dummy rush by the window. Then, when we were all in shock, he cut the wires quickly. It was very effective. He made us think the killer had run off into the woods and we went after him. You see, it was an easy task to accomplish. At least it was for someone who's used to doing this on the set. You were the only one who had a chance to get on the roof and prepare all this, Rupert."
Sherlock has to take a deep breath and sigh before he answers. It draws a satisfied smirk on John's face, which Sherlock simultaneously wants to kiss and punch.
"I know it's not my place to say this Sherlock, and even if you don't think of me like that, I do consider you family. You're my husband's brother and I care about you."
"Nothing." John sat straight shaking the sleep out of his head "So, are you going to tell me what happened?"
"Come on John, we'll be late for your tedious party." Sherlock says as he enters the bedroom, and John's face relaxes into a smile when he sees him.
"Right. I forgot you prefer London's smog over actually non-toxic air. Look! There is the bridge. I told you we weren't lost."
"Early enough. I got the chance to hear your conversation with Mr. Knight. There's no point trying to interrogate him at the moment, he is clearly in shock. We need to go to the crime scene, John"
Greg had been talking to Sherlock as if he were one of the many visitors who went in and out of the room all day. Never in front of anyone else though. Sherlock was dumbfounded, but rather intrigued. He had been watching Greg for some time, and the man was most certainly not insane. He was actually speaking to him, and Sherlock was ready to figure what on earth was going on right this moment.
"You shouldn't be too sure of yourself, Watson" Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but he took off his t-shirt and pushed down his pants all the same. John was just in a pair of boxer shorts, and Sherlock wasted no time in pushing them down too.
Sherlock kissed him again deeply, and pulled him up on his feet. Soon, they were both divested of all clothes and writhing on Sherlock's bed.
The increased cell inspections down at the general population never really yielded real results. All CO's could do was wait for the riot to start and enforce a lockdown until things calmed down.
Sarah looked puzzled and just a bit concerned, and well of course she had a reason to. John smiled "You were right. I'm not okay, I'm going bonkers"
John felt an irrational urge to hold him and take away all the pain. He slowly helped him into the tub, and started stroking the damp mess of curls.
Sherlock looked up suddenly in amazement, unable to believe what he had just heard. Warmth he had never experienced before engulfed him. He stared at John, feeling like the sky had been suddenly higher, the ocean bigger, and he could maybe… maybe have this
He slowly lifted his head, eyes gradually adjusting to the faint light slipping through the window. Jefferson Hope was standing by the bed, one gun in his right hand, pointed at John, and another sitting idly in his left hand.
Many years working with Sherlock and rushing to his place for all sorts of crime inquiries made it instinctive for Greg to barge into the flat without preamble, so he just walked in. the flat was semi-dark and dead silent. Neither Sherlock nor John were in sight. Greg stood by the fireplace wondering if Sherlock had been playing him for fool, but then his heart jumped as he heard a very distinctive noise… moans.
"Alright?" John asked, his face so close that Sherlock felt every warm huff of breath on his own cheek.
He then took notice of Sherlock, who had his flushed face turned to him. he gave him an intense strange look bearing so many meaning: gloating, possessiveness, condescension... but also, arousal… so much arousal at being watched, it startled Greg for a moment, and then Sherlock was not looking at him anymore, but rather at the gloriously naked man looming over his body.
"You were dreaming" Sherlock's voice was dulled by the painkillers, though his eyes were sharp as ever
"Yes" Sherlock suddenly yelled, startling the small group of people around him "Take me to Bart's, to John!"
"Fine. Come on." He said as he stepped outside, hearing Bill reaching quickly for his coat and following.
So, before the door to his flat opened, Sherlock yelled over at Mycroft to go away and never come back, but sadly, you could only do so much when you're not an exorcist.
He leaned over the table, extracted a nicotine patch and stuck it next to the one that was already on his arm. He tried to focus his attention on the experiment in his hands, though every cell in his body was urging him to think of one thing: Cocaine.
"Warm… uh… aching… sweet, but… maddening, like falling" Sherlock managed to say the words, though they were interjected with small moans and sighs.
"It's not my hospital, Sherlock, I just work there." John says as he moves behind the counter separating the kitchen from the living room and starts making tea.
"Wait." John gasps and his hand flies to clutch Sherlock's wrist. Sherlock lifts his head, startled and worried, and feels his mouth form a tense line, but John reaches to stroke his trembling lower lip with his thumb and kisses his cheek tenderly.
Too soon though, the chill of the night was creeping into the garden. People were gradually leaving, and the party was coming to an end. Sherlock saw John get up and thank Greg and Molly, and without thinking he followed him out to the street.
"Do you ever feel like there is something else in there with us… in the operation room I mean. A… force that doesn't care if we put up a fight or not."
"Don't…" she interrupted "Just think about it, John. I know you haven't been feeling like yourself lately, but we can do this. We belong together, we understand each other"
The sounds around him were a mixture of traffic, people talking, and the deafening mechanic wailing of an ambulance
And the words went through Sherlock like cold wind. He felt himself shrink. The world had never been smaller, and he had never been more alone.
He gradually took in the blinding lights and colors around him. The world was bathed in a dull grey glow. Sherlock found the courage to open his eyes properly now, and for a moment he tried to make sense of everything he was feeling
They both smiled at Sherlock, eliciting a massive eye roll on his part. "What else would I have done?" He caught a glimpse of what Bill had in his pocket and paused halfway through the sentence. "What do you have there, Bill?" he asked.
"Fine." He answered, trying to ignore the sirens going off in his head. John smiled, and Sherlock's breath hitched and his pulse soared to unreasonable levels. He pulled himself out of John's arms slowly, feeling inexplicably dazed.
Sherlock fell silent for a moment, getting to this part was making him angry now as he remembered he was so close to losing John.
"He doesn't… I mean… I don't care. I just needed to make sure they don't get lost in this damn maze." He ran a gloved hand through his hair nervously.
Bill turned distracted eyes at him. He took his hand out of his pocket as if he just realized what he was doing. "Oh, this. It's Lidiya's choker. I found it by the front door."
"No, not that." He turns serious "There's a charity ball that the hospital staff has to attend next Friday. I want you to come with me, as my date."
Sherlock rolled his sleeve and John swabbed the side of his arm with alcohol and administered the injection, feeling the piercing gaze on him.
"Young married couple found shot to death. Husband was 29, wife was 27. Coroner thinks the husband put a bullet in his wife's head, then turned the gun on himself."
“I’m ready, John, fuck me, now.” Sherlock demanded, and John did not argue, but simply gave him another adoring smile. "Whatever my sweetheart asks" He said as he pushed Sherlock's hair back with affection.
"Might be interesting" Sherlock eyed the phone screen suspiciously. There was no such thing as an interesting favor, but at this point he was desperate for any distraction. His brain was going to rot and he was willing to leave the flat even for a five. Before he could type in a reply a new text came.
A soft tremor took hold of Sherlock's body as he nodded desperately. He made to move and lie beneath John on the bed, but he stopped him.
"You see," Jefferson went on "You're not really the intended target group of my research, but well, one flawed specimen can't hurt anybody." He chuckled.
"So the shooter was indeed standing, but let's picture this situation. If the wife had been awake with her husband standing in front of her with a gun, wouldn’t she have tried to run or at least struggle before getting shot? But she clearly didn't, or else the bullet wound would be in the back of her head. Now, why would she just calmly receive a bullet, unless someone else was there, someone who had been threatening both of them before killing them."
"Come on Myc, let's get drinks." Lestrade says as he wraps an arm around Mycroft. "This was supposed to be a fun night for the two of us, remember?" John hears Lestrade's trailing voice as they walk away.
