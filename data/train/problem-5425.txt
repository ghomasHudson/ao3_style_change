Arriving  back at the tower as soon as Tony lands he begins taking off his Iron Man suit. He'll head to the kitchen first, grab another cup of coffee, then head straight to the lab to do work on some unfinished projects. When he's done with those he'll take them apart and work on them again, just to stay busy.
Clint and Bucky share a look, “we’ve only just meet her today not enough time to figure out where she’d hide during a panic attack. Not even with the help of super spies”.
"You tricked me!" exclaimed Tony suddenly feeling very foolish. He's supposed to be a genius, and yet he got bamboozled by Captain America.
"About an hour ago. Friday alerted me that you were on your way back so I decided to make ya some coffee," Steve explains coming to lean on the counter next to Tony. Reaching out a hand and gently placing it on Tony's cheek "You look tired, how about we head upstairs and I'll give you a massage".
Tony was stalling, yep definitely stalling he thinks as he changes suits for the ninth time. Can you really blame him? He keeps telling the team that he’s not good with children, but all they do is roll their eyes and tell him he’s being ridiculous. So, what if Harley, Peter, and the tiny agents visit on the weekends (occasionally)technically speaking those aren’t his kids; therefore, they don’t count. Now he’s expected to stand in front of a bunch of small parentless children and put on a smile. How can Tony do something like that knowing that they don’t have a home to return to, and yeah, he does support the orphanage thorough charities and other events, but he can’t help but wonder if it really helps anything. Tony knows what it feels like to lose your parents and when it happened to him at least he was an adult (sort of), but he can’t imagine what it feels like to be so young and all alone; which is why he usually gets Pepper to do all the fundraisers and stuff because she can handle herself but Tony on the other hand is a nervous wreck and he hasn’t even left his room yet.
When they enter the kitchen there are several calls and greetings as the head for the table. Steve even walks over and places a kiss on Tony’s forehead before handing him a cup of coffee.
“Don’t you want to play with the others?” asks a deep but quiet voice beside Jasmine causing her to startle and glance up. The first the she sees is a arm, but not just any arm but a metal on glistening in the light of the room. Slowly but surely Jasmine can feel her excitement rising as see meets the metallic blue of Bucky Barnes eyes.
Tony could practically see the red alerts going off in his brain. If he goes up stairs with Steve he'll never get to his lab, but how can he refuse when he's giving Tony that look. The 'I love you and I like doing this for you because it make you happy look' that Tony hates but secretly loves. At this point Tony knows he's just staring at Steve like a love sick puppy, but what else can he do? His brain was frying.
“Thank you Tony I honestly don’t understand what’s wrong with our team. We’re the Avengers for crying out loud having some children tour the tower should be a walk in the park. But every single one of you are acting like Pepper is sending you to your death or something,” rants Steve as Tony finally pours himself a cup of coffee.
Once Tony reaches the side of the lab from before when the girl first appeared, he can see her still wrapped in he purple jacket tucked into the corner under a workbench. She glanced up and freezes when her eyes meet his, they’re filled with tears and it makes Tony feel awful. She looks about ready to bolt or rip a hole in the fabric of the universe.
"Cut it out you two," calls Natasha stepping into the room and taking a seat next to Bruce to have breakfast.
Next chapter we'll finally have Jasmine meet the Avengers. After this point the chapters should get longer. Until next week!
The ride actually ended up being almost an hour long and Jasmine had almost fallen asleep many times she’d only managed to stay awake because Peter kept showing her funny videos and text messages from his best friend named Ned.
“You’re up early,” Steve points out leaning over to peck him on the lips causing his two companions to let out a stream of gags and curses. “Real mature,” Steve tells them kissing Tony one more time before wrapping an arm around him.
"Actually, tell him to take the rest of the day off. I can make it back on my own," Tony grins as he picks up his red and gold suitcase. Flying home is a lot better than driving, and if he gets home quick enough he can lock himself in his lab before Pepper makes him do more work.
“Well she’s already broken into the Tower once without being detected so I decided to be cautious,” says Friday shocking Tony.
“Fine, but I can’t promise you I’ll be good company,” Bucky said with a sigh leaving the room followed by Sam who was on his phone.
She notices Falcon (Sam) at the stove along with Vision cooking breakfast and Hawkeye (Clint) and Natasha leaning casually against the large counter top taking. Glancing over to the left Jasmine sees a separate but attached breakfast nook. Captain America and Bucky were setting the table along with Thor. Antman was sitting at the table swiping some of the finished food and Dr. Banner was having some tea and reading something on his tablet. Not everyone had arrived at breakfast yet, but the mood was very domestic, and Jasmine suddenly felt like she was intruding.
“First of all chew your food because that’s gross. Secondly you know exactly where we are going so don’t ask, you’ll ruin the surprise.” Tony tells him throwing a wink at Jasmine.
“Hey, we don’t only blow things up!” exclaims Tony “Right Brucie?” he asks looking back at the subdued scientist.
“Thank you very much, but you didn’t have to go through so much trouble,” Jasmine tells her talking the set of clothes.
"Well that was as boring as I expected it to be," complains Tony leaving yet another press conference. What's the point of going to these things if nothing ever gets done. Now he's bored, he hoped Pepper was happy with herself forcing him to come here. Why couldn't it have been another Avenger, like Nat, or Bruce (maybe not), his point being he shouldn't have to be the only member doing boring stuff. Steve, Natasha, and Clint go on super secret spy missions all the time while he's stuck doing busy work.
Back then she was always asking herself why it only happened to her, but then she realized it’s because Jasmine let it happen she never stood up for herself, and she was terrified of her own shadow. She hated herself and her powers; she used to sneak and tie her ankle to the bed back when she couldn’t control her abilities. After, Ms. Bean started working here however Jasmine decided enough was enough, and the next time Jordan tried to stick gum in her hair she bit him and broke his nose. Apparently, she has a mean right hook. The good news is that no one bothered her again now they pretend she doesn’t exist which Jasmine thinks is petty and immature, but she’s not supposed to know what those words mean. The best part about all that was she didn’t get in trouble Ms. Bean pulled her aside and said to tell her if I have anymore problems, so I guess she’s pretty cool.
“All those things are cool and all, but not everyone appreciates intelligence. It typically annoys people especially when you’re arrogant about it,” Peter tells her somberly.
“Yeah, but that’s okay,” he tells her quickly. “That probably just means I need to upgrade my security. Also, you can’t really control your powers yet, right. Besides no harm done.”
After a few minutes of standing back watching the others interact with everyone Jasmine had decided at this point to just stand back and observe because that’s what she was good at, even though she really wanted to talk with someone. She though she was over being shy, but nothing like meeting your heroes to remind you of your insecurities. Jasmine had her hands in her jacket pockets and her hood pulled low as she stood back she was so intent watching everyone interact she didn’t notice someone standing next to her until they spoke.
“None sense,” Tony mutters loudly “the star of an event should always strive to arrive fashionably late, and I’m noting if not the star”. Crouching down low to be eye level with the children Tony says, “now who wants pictures?” Causing the mass of children to go wild once more.
“Hey Jasmine,” calls a voice startling her. Looking back over her shoulder she sees the boy from the stairway, Peter. Along with Tony Stark both of them heading towards the kitchen.
Jasmine nods more to herself than anything before getting up and heading to the large bathroom. Who needs such a huge bathroom?
“I was worried about the kids not liking me or being scared I guess, but then I saw this cute girl standing all by herself and I couldn’t help but come talk to her,” Bucky tells her making Jasmine blush and shuffle her feet nervously. Before she had a chance to respond to the compliment a slender hand comes down and hits him in the back of the head.
Peter snickers for behind his hand at her serious face. “Nah, you don’t have to do that. Besides you shouldn’t just go around punching people,” he tells her trying to keep a straight face.
“In my defense it was a lot of information to take in, and I wasn’t expecting her to just vanish. Also, if we’re being technical I’m pretty sure it was Bucky’s fault she bolted,” says Steve defensively.
Tony closes his eyes already planning out a new design for his StarkPhone, and a few weapon ideas for Natasha; she could use an upgrade. Nothing like mind numbing work to distract him from like for just a little while. Tony slowly opens his eyes again- “Steve!” he shouts immediately sitting up and smacking their heads together. Ow!
Jasmine had grabbed her purple hoodie last minute even though it wasn’t cold outside so she could cover her face at least. Ms. Bean wanted them to dress at least a little nice so she’d worn her favorite gray and pink skirt with some gray leggings and her new shoes she got last Christmas with the lights and she also wore her Avengers shirt (not that anyone could see it with her hoodie on).
The moment he walks into the kitchen he can already smell the fresh coffee, "Fri, you truly are the best," he announces rushing over to the machine.
Ms. Bean had only been working here for about six months, before it was just mean old Mrs. Chariot, Jasmine used to think she was an actual witch, turns out she was just old and cranky. Back then Jasmine had feared everything and let everyone walk all over her. The kids here were awful to her, she couldn’t remember a day without being bullied and Mrs. Chariot let it happen, so Jasmine was glad when she finally retired.
It's a video that Jasmine loves to watch when its her turn to use the tablet. She can't really watch to many other videos after this one because she's already watched it twice, and she only gets to be on the table for a hour before its someone else's turn. Ms. Bean calls if fair, but Jasmine thinks its stupid. However, she's only going to think it because the last time she said it out loud she got grounded and couldn't use the table or watch TV for a whole week. Which was also stupid, because what's the point of always being told to speak your mind if you can't call stupid things stupid without getting in trouble.
“Wow, you must be super smart,” expresses Jasmine totally forgetting about the game she was playing on her tablet.
“Time is a game,” he just says, and then he’s crying, really crying, the sort that’s all moans and spit, “Time is a game, and I want to play.”
He had an inky mop of hair, dark and beautiful, that curled and coiled around his temples. His cheeks were pink, wind whipped, and when he looked up from his cell phone, his eyes were the softest kind of blue Steve had ever seen, bright and lovely, and they seemed to catch on him with a hold that felt like friction.
That thing in Steve's chest still aches, rattles and rolls in the empty space, but it seemed fit to fill most days, pouring in on itself, sinking and drowning in this love.
And it’s a little broken, halting at its edges, but they’re all smiling, laughing like friends and joking like fools, and Steve starts to smile too.
He tries folding them across the counter, but the boy looks at him funny, so he thinks he chose wrong. He lets them hang at his sides, odd and weirdly limp, and then the boy goes on talking.
He just keeps laughing, press of the brush to the scratch of the page, all thin wash of white that melts to the page, and then he stops.
It’s a month before the sun stops dripping down their back, and it’s another month before they finish the bucket list. Clean white walls and hospital brand Clorox are the recipe for homeliness, and St. Marshalls room 303 marks the end of a revolution.
Tony Stark is a man of self-preservation, but Steve Rogers loves like he could moves mountains. Steve Rogers is soft, and bright, pink in the morning and blue in the night. He's a sure bet. Tony Stark is a thing of nerves, but Steve Rogers loves like he isn't. Like he knows what he is, and just doesn’t care.
“At least the bus has air conditioning?” Steve says, and he swipes at his forehead, pawing at his shirt with two hands and rubbing at his cheeks with the hem of it.
'Make a wish,' Steve thinks, and his eyes are drifting closed, slow as honey, unfolding every moment he never knew existed, every piece of them that got tucked into paper corners and hidden away.
Tony is half asleep, all soft breath and dewy smiles, and when he looks at Steve it's so lovely he thinks he might kiss him.
There is no universe where Tony Stark ends up with Steve Rogers, but there's got to be one where this love doesn’t flicker and fade. Where knocking elbows and creaking vinyl doesn’t end in heartbreak.
“God no,” Steve says, and Tony chews on a smile, worrying at something lovely in the press of the night, “but what are you going to do when you get tired of the tattoo?”
His hands are still roaming, running down arms and smoothing at wrinkles, ironing out the kinks in his undersuit.
“You know what that means?” he smiles, and there’s no weight, no touch of a sigh that beats at its back, just lovely and bright and filled with promise.
When Mrs. Carter comes downstairs, not a dish has been washed, but she doesn’t seem to mind. There, in the kitchen, stands two boys, shaking and wet, and more in love than she's ever seen.
Steve's never been fond of the impossible. There are some things too big, too wide for Steve's hands to grasp. There are some oceans you can't cross by foot.
Shakes, cracks, rattles at his teeth till he can’t seem to hold it, churning and chipping and eating at his grin.
He sets the money to the side, pools it into a pile on the counter, and when he bends down, he finds a star.
His voice is small, tinny and soft, and so unlike Tony that he's desperate, suddenly, hopeless to do anything but step forward, one foot then the next. He reaches Tony, and his fingers clasp around his wrist.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Or that baseball cap you wore for six weeks straight when we were nine,” and he’s laughing again, a rush of something that trips off his tongue, “Or the-”
Steve Rogers was a rail of a boy, all skinny limbs and golden hair. Barely seventeen and desperate to climb, shake off a lifetime of 'too little, not enough, needs more.' There was a pull in his chest, a yearning, a need to scale and reach and complete. There was a fire in his heart, a flame that shook and rattled with the wind, and he couldn't seem to quit the way it burns in his chest. The way it aches.
Forty-two promises. Forty-two wishes. A Chinese thank you from the boy from Xu Yuan, a breathless joke from the woman on the bus, a napkin sketch from Ashley and
Tony Stark builds miracles in his sleep. He lights up cities and his own damn ribcage, casts shadows on reinvention with two fists, shapes cities like he knows he could break them. Builds walls like he's hoping you'll shake them.
Summer bends low on the lip of the Wayside, melt of the sky that curves towards the valley, shadow shake of august that blows with the breeze. The sky is set yellow, burning at the edges, creasing at the corners and catching on the pavement, all dry mouth humid and sticky cheeked swelter.
“What do you want?” Steve asks, two steps behind, and the door falls open with a hiss, sigh of the bell from somewhere above them.
“You dragged me out to southside to catch the bus so you could cross something off your bucket list?”
Steve laughs and laughs, and then he's grabbing more, chasing at Tony's mouth with the popcorn as he lets out a squeak, toppling off the couch with a thud.
He guesses he ought to change the list. '1000 Reasons I'm in Love with Tony Stark' has a much better ring to it.
Steve's throat is doing the thing again, brimming and closing, and he doesn't know what to do with his hands suddenly.
“Does it count?” Steve asks, melting in the middle like the stars and the evening, empty lungs and pink cheeks, but all Tony does is smile.
And then he’s giggling, easy huff of laughter that melts off his tongue, and Steve is smiling too, shaking shoulders as the sun sinks to evening, cool brush of light that paints things still, and Steve is more in love than he’s ever been.
“No,” he says, and then he’s chewing on a grin, doing his best to swallow it down, “They have to let the passengers off.”
And it’s so funny, months and months of push and pull, and here he goes, waters of the well of his heart that go spilling out onto the tile, and when he looks up, Tony's so small.
And Steve does, he really does, but it shakes that water in his lungs to hear Tony say it, so he tightens his hold on the mug in front of him and just says,
Wayside shrinks in the heat of the day, heavy wash of summer that scrapes at their shoes, sticking in their throats till they’re chewing through august. Summer hisses off the pavement, biting at their heels and clawing up the curb. The sun in low in the sky, and for some reason, Steve Rogers is at the bus station.
And then he was smiling at Steve, so pretty and lovely and, and, Steve can’t think up many other words for him, not when he's standing there and still smiling, so he nods.
“Cataclysm,” Steve says sagely, and then he scribbles it on the page, sharpie dark and bleeding through the paper,
"Fuck you," says Tony, but it's not quite working, causing he's laughing while he says it, and he doesn't know quite how to quit.
The radio is playing, something low and lovely, and Tony is humming, soft under his breath. Dust filters through the light, drifting and floating, sinking to the linoleum and settling along the tiles. Tony's hair is long, curling at the base of his neck, sticky from the sunshine. And Steve is taking it all in. Memorizing the lines of this beautiful moment, the curl of Tony's lip, the lilt of his voice. There is static in his heart, buzzing and blurring, and Steve can feel the possibility, the steady hum of excitement that lingers under the summer sun.
Tony, dripping and manic and desperate not to lose, steps back, slipping on the puddle at his feet, and catching hold of the sink. He turns on the tap, filling up his hands with fistfuls of water, and then he's flinging them at Steve's face.
And Tony smiles, soft and warm and melting in the day, the kind of thing that wobbles from the weight of it, shivers in the middle from the force of it all.
This one begins with a star. An ocean of time, and a cold cup of coffee. Two boys, a bill, and a smile.
And the sky is dragging along the concrete, scratching at the sidewalk with a heat that’s all teeth, and Steve is a puddle in his shoes for a piece of paper.
The light is coming through the windows, stretching across Tony's jacket and painting his face in cool blue. He looks phosphorescent, glowing dim in the low light of the coffee shop. Steve yearns, aches, feels that urge to touch and tangle, bury itself in layers and layers of Tony Stark and never let go.
Steve is not the wondering sort. He is first thoughts and quick motions, the stretch of a fist and the ache of his jaw, no pace and all thunder. The kind of hurried action that bites at your thumbs in comic book pages, but he doesn’t say a word. Just tilts his breath towards the brush of night and searches for a star.
Not at Tony. Not at God. Just hot brimmed fury, melting in scorn, dripping and pooling with the ache in his jaw, boiling and battered where his cheek meets his scowl.
"Allow me to turn on the AC," says Steve, fixing Tony with a dry look, and making to reach for the thermostat.
And then the man is smiling, really smiling, the kind that’s all teeth, laughing and laughing and begging over the dish boy.
Peggy's mom owned the shop, and it seemed to sing, bright and warm as she was, covered in sun colored tiles and honeydew vinyl. It was the kind of place where everything and nothing seemed to happen, people passing through in search of better places, spilling into Café au Lait like the sun through the windows.
Sometimes, there is a glimmer in the way Tony will look at him. A twitch in his jaw, a jump in his throat. There is a heart-thump of a moment where Steve begins to wonder, 'maybe, what if, if only.'
“It’s a two for one,” Tony says smiling, “I get to cross something off my list, and you get to see me sans pants.”
The sun pours over the glass of Xu Yuan with a hiss, bending at the edges and spilling to the tile, gold chase of heat that chips at the floor. It smells warm, bite to the air that’s all ginger and pepper, and Steve and Tony are knocking elbows over a plate of dim sum.
He was a spitfire thing, all shaking fingers and blinding smiles. He was brash, and bold, desperate and wanting, so full of this beautiful thing Steve couldn't seem to reach. He was all firecracker heart and nervous hands, and he seemed to shake, vibrate, rattle and roll to fill lonely silence.
Steve says nothing. Just holds his in his arms, warm and present and there and Tony just can't handle it. He's reaching, thumbs pressing into the holds of Steve's jaw before he can think about it, and then they’re kissing, and Tony's still crying, but it's different now. His mouth finds Steve and holds to him, searching for that good thing he always gives away. His fingers settle in his hair, cradling at the back of Steve's neck, till the angle is just right, and Tony is falling, sinking, drowning in this love. Steve's arms are wrapped around his waist, and Tony is so full, of him and here, this one beautiful moment.
And then the stars are spilling into the tip jar, hundreds of them, and Steve feels that too familiar bubble in his chest, the one that aches whenever Tony's near.
Steve swallows then, and suddenly the smile drops off his face, and Tony feels it again, that phantom ache, the urge to grab glue and tape and stick it back on there himself.
The sun is heavy in the sky, low hang of silence that pools at their feet, sticky hush of darkness that drips down their backs, and Steve can’t take his eyes off the way the stars melt the shadows on Tony’s face a cool sort of blue.
Pepper had that pinched look in her face, the kind that said, "you are so getting your ass handed to you", so Tony took a sip, hot on his tongue, and now his face was pinched, gathering wrinkles as the seconds flew by, and really this is-
They have oceans of time for yeses and nos. Spill a little sky in his belly, and Steve could turn rivers into mountains.
The break, when it comes, has a pulse. Beats in his chest. Steve knows this song. He is used to the way quiet lives in his cheeks. Tastes desperation, gritty on his tongue, kisses closed the 'I love you's' that threaten to pour through teeth and land at their feet. They urge, whisper, moan and sigh and beg to roll off his tongue and shake this foundation. This careful laid thing before them.
But Steve just stands, arms at his sides, and it's not about the dishes, but it's not quite about them yet either, so Tony just smiles and says,
And then he’s tugging at his sleeve, and Steve is moving on shaking knees, lungs full of wanting and desperate to drown it. They pick a seat somewhere in the middle, and Tony is scanning through the seats in search of something.
For every end, there is a beginning. You cannot open where you close. Every story starts with a wish, a hope, a prayer for the finish. Every moment has a heart that bleeds for the quit.
Steve is no fool. There is no universe where this thing works out okay. There are no shooting stars for boys like Steve. He is all bony arms and wobbly knees, hollow cheeks and orphan grit, but these moments fill him up for lifetimes. There are hundreds of stars left for wishing on, and Steve likes to think he could make just one of them count.
When he finishes, he hands the change back to the boy, sliding pennies into his palm and taking care not to touch. He smiles again, nods his head, and Steve has a moment to think what a lovely kind of perfect this all felt, and then he's off, gone, sliding down the que to meet his coffee.
Moments grow longer, and the days grow colder, but Steve and Tony stay the same. They are the echo of maybe, a hurtling sigh, the steady hum of a near collision. They share secrets and silence, whispers in the dark, trading breaths from each other's lungs. They are two steps too close, and three steps too far, a shadow in the song of quiet. They are the infinite lilt of the way Steve does not kiss him, will not kiss him, aches to kiss him.
There are moments, Steve thinks, breathing in the air from the other boy's lungs, where everything is soft, and nothing hurts. There are moments where the rap of his heart against his ribs is only a thump, a dizzy drumline, that tugs and pulls at the strings of his chest. There are days where there is nothing but them, Steve and Tony, warm in the silence, where everything is heard and nothing is said. There are moments when the days are long, and his heart is full, and he thinks there must be nothing better than being in love with Tony Stark.
“My point,” he says, a little breathless at the way the light stretches over Tony’s jaw, “Is that you liked these things for approximately a month, and then got tired of them.”
Steve and Tony are pressing toes into pavement twelve minutes before midnight, scrubbing at their eyes two feet from the front door of Everything but the Kitchen Ink, and Steve thinks he’d kill for a cheeseburger right about now.
“We’d like to book one butt corn cobb,” Steve says, and the elbow Tony throws lands stiff between his ribs.
Steve is grabbing, fisting hands in shirts and hair, checking for bruises, missing bits and bobs. Tony spreads his arms for him, lets his hands run over his sides, quick and frantic. Fingers grab, pull, tugging at his chest, heavy and hard and desperate.
There is a beat, a heart thump of a moment where something jumps in Tony's jaw, and then it's gone. Steve is suddenly very, very tired.
"Have you ever known me to keep an empty bed," he leers, eyeing her over the rim of the cup as his stomach churns.
Tony’s all profile, nose to the sky, and if Steve closes his eyes, he knows he’d hear the hum of his heart, knows the weight of the wishes he’d beg the sky to keep, knows Tony would smile and hum and talk about Orian.
It started, as most things do, with a cup of coffee. A tall Americano, lifted to eyeline by a pretty woman in a red dress.
The night is soft, dizzy with wonder, and it’s cold, chilly somehow, like the sky’s up and kissed away the sun, but he’s warm. The day blows cool at his cheeks, mouthing at his jaw till he’s pink all over, but he’s warm, washed in summer like love could feed him, and it’s sudden. Certain, the way he can’t seem to drown the want in the space between his ribs, the pull and tug and drag, the desperate kind of way he is aching to kiss away the stumble in the lines of Tony’s mouth, so he stares and stares and tries not to speak.
And it's the dumbest thing, but he doesn’t need living brain cells to laugh, so his head's tipping back, and then his breath's a stutter in his throat, sharp bursts of air that huff in his cheeks and slip through his teeth.
, fists full of fabric and the weight of Steve’s jaw, pressing and pooling until there’s no space between them left to be filled, till there’s a rib someone near that’s not quite his, like the lung and the heart and the stars in his chest are atoms he doesn’t know.
The cookie’s crumbled in his pocket, like it has been there the whole two months, but Tony just pulls out the strip of paper with careful fingers.
Tony tugs at his sleeve, feverish and hurried and yanking, puling at cotton with heavy fists, struggling at polyester with fingers that shake.
“I don’t want to save the world,” he says, clutching to fury, grasping at its shadow and begging for its heat, “I don’t want to save the world.”
And he's crying, thick wet tears that roll down his face, and when he reaches the end of the tub, there's a single star left at the bottom.
And then Steve’s just laughing, hunched over his knees as he chokes on a breath, snickering by the curb as Tony bitches through it.
Tony doesn’t glance at him, just rolls his eyes through the back on the bus and lands on a woman with a Kroger bag in her lap.
"I'll just tell her the truth. It was a dumb lie, really, it's not like we could have pulled it off or anything-"
The urge to breathe swept through him, urging then adamant, till Tony leaned back, a breath away and fell to whispering, ardent and hushed and reverent, "I love you. I love you, god, do I love you."
"What on earth did you do this time?" Says Steve, and he's already smiling, voice full of laughter, eyes soft as he waits for Tony to tell him all about it. Not for the first time, Tony regrets how infinitely he's fucked this whole thing up.
Tony doesn't pick up the phone. He calls, and calls, and there's Tony, laughing as he tells you he'll call you back, provided you're Steve, and not to bother leaving a message.
Tony frowns, rolling onto his back till there’s nothing but sky, soft sigh of blue to the tip of the earth.
They said as long as you can find Polaris, you can find your way home. Steve’s starting to wonder if he’ll ever be found again.
Reason #184: Sometimes, in the light of the morning, his eyes drift shut, lashes caught against tan skin, fingers tracing the rim of the coffee cup, and you'll think to yourself how tired he must be
"'Absolutely no jorts allowed," Tony christens the sign this week, 'no exceptions' scrawled across the bottom.
And it's silly, but these sound an awful lot like pick-up lines, and his heart is fluttering, cruel churn of anxiety rising in his stomach.
Tony sat back in his chair as he contemplated this. It was hard to believe that, but it made sense. Didn’t it hurt the trust the most when he found out about Barnes? Why? Because he had trusted Steve above most. Steve had never lied to protect him, so he didn’t get the need this time. He had always given as good as he had got, and that alone in Tony’s eyes had given him a position few others had earned.
7 hours, but what seemed like a lifetime later, the buzzing of a copter was heard, and the Avengers who were assembled in the living area of the house, stiffened. Bruce and Rhodey were finding it hard to hide their smiles, in spite of the circumstances of Tony’s return. Natasha was nervous, as was expected, but she hid it well. Clint was on edge, constantly fiddling with his phone, with his arrows, generally fidgeting, but no one was in the state Steve was in.
For a moment he thought he’d misread all the indicators; he pulled back, releasing Tony’s shirt, his lips about to pull away, when Tony responded, twisting his body to a better angle, his hand finding Steve’s shirt, other hand cupping the back of his neck. For several moments they kissed; there was nothing hurried about the kiss, just a slow, lazy kiss, in which they poured in all their emotions, something pure and heartbreakingly sweet.
“Hey, I came to fetch you for dinner,” he invented, his eyes belying his calm exterior. Steve tilted his head to survey Tony.
Three months later, he decided he had had enough. He walked to Tasha’s room, and waited for her to let him in. He entered when she did, stopping at the doorway.
“He… is a changed man, Tony. He breathes but he isn’t exactly the epitome of lively happiness. Bucky meant much more to him than I can begin to comprehend. Their relation was something beyond what we can fathom.”
“That I can believe. I can also understand his emotions, but I cannot understand his lack of them. He isn’t showing emotions. He has never had a problem with showing his emotions before, they’ve always been open for everyone to see.”
His eyes had filled with tears somewhere through the middle of his monologue. He brushed at them impatiently.
His mind was conflicted – one half of him wanted Tony to come, to talk to Tony, to hear him out and to explain to him. The other half didn’t have the courage. After everything, he felt it better to stay as far from Tony as was possible. He knew that he would have to meet him in professional settings, but he wanted that to remain the extent of it.
He sank down on it, before taking a deep breath. “What has been going on with Steve?” he asked, without beating around the bush.
Clint took the time to observe him. His eyes were empty of any emotion, his skin was pale, and his face had a perpetual frown. The smile he had ready was nowhere in sight. This was not the Steve they knew and loved. This was the shadow of a man they had all once known.
Whether it was getting into trouble at school, whether it was the beatings from the other boys down the street back at Brooklyn, it was always Bucky who grounded him, and so it was today. He was so caught up in talking that he didn’t hear the doorknob turn until the door was open, revealing a worried (and somewhat flabbergasted) Tony Stark.
The bile rose in his throat as his thoughts went to Tony. His most vivid of memories, his most frequent of nightmares – the image of him slamming his shield into his chest. He awoke with a start. He hadn’t realized when he fell asleep, but his arm was still wound around Bucky’s bag, and he was curled up on the floor.
Tony noticed the war-worn ways of Steve, how he flinched from sudden loud noises. How he looked around, as if looking for someone, but then, slightly slumped before squaring his shoulders, and going on with whatever he had begun. He noticed the more and more sunken look in his eyes, as the days passed and he drowned himself in work. This was borderline ridiculous, even he didn’t use work so much as an escape route.
Everyone turned to him. His face was paler, more drawn than usual, his eyes held a deep emotion, unidentifiable, something that had been missing in the last few months that they had been in Wakanda. Ignoring the shards of glass at his feet, he trudged up to his room, his movements almost robot like. At the door, Tasha grabbed his hand to stop him.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He traipsed into the room that carried a placard of his name – Nat and Shuri worked fast. His bag was in there, and so was Bucky’s. His hands trailed over the top of Bucky’s bag before he threw it at the wall in a fit of anger, and his knees buckled.
“You’ve no idea how long I have waited for you to do that,” confessed Tony, a smile creeping up his face. “No, really,” he added, watching a slight skepticism on Steve’s face. “Steve, is this some one off thing? Because if it is, please, please tell me now; I have waited too long to ask you out, and if you are only kissing me in a weak moment that we both were caught in, it would wreck m-!”
“Tell me,” said Tony. He was determined to bring Steve back, to bring back the man he knew and he respected. That was what he didn’t understand about himself – he hated Steve for hiding the truth, for siding with Bucky, for basically running away, but his respect for Steve remained. He respected the loyalty Steve had, and he saw the flaws that the others didn’t.
“I am sorry, as well. I didn’t think,” he admitted, softly. “I was angry, and I didn’t see things straight. My mother would be ashamed of what I became, in the quest to seek ‘revenge’. I didn’t see reason; I didn’t think of why you supported Barnes. The last couple of years, I spent thinking and wondering why you did what you did, and the more I think, the more stupid it all seems.”
His feet took him in the general direction of Steve’s room. He stopped about ten feet away from the door to the room. Taking a deep breath, he pushed open the door. What he saw was enough to break anyone’s heart.
Pleasantries were exchanged, and they settled in, both parties catching the other up on the events that had happened to them since the last time they had met, or heard from the other. Tony and Steve studied each other over the days – not precisely hiding, but definitely not an in-your-face sort of studying.
“It isn’t easy,” murmured Rhodey, staring at the spot where T’Challa had vanished. “I know loss, I know what it is to lose one’s best friend, and I know what it is to have to put yourself back together and carry on like nothing ever happened. I also know you can do it. But you don’t have to be alone in it. I know you tend to blame yourself for things, Tony has mentioned this to me many times.”
He stood up, leaving Tasha and Clint talking, and walked out without really seeing where he was going. His brain was swimming with the information he had just heard. He knew that Steve had PTSD (which of them didn’t, really?), but this? This was something else, and he found himself wanting to help Steve in any way he could. He needed to help him, before Steve destroyed himself on the inside, before he became the man that Tony was before Steve walked into his life.
“War changes everyone, Antoshka,” she said, gently. “He saw Bucky and Sam die, and I know you know what that means, you saw Parker die.”
“Says the man who has spent 76 hours in that bloody lab, till he had to be dragged forcibly outside so he would not faint and blow something up?”
Bruce rushed in, followed by Rhodey, Thor and Tasha. His face was flushed with the exertion of having run all the way down from his rooms, and judging by the expressions on the others’ faces, they had not been told what had made Bruce so excited.
“No, no, this is big,” said Bruce, his expression alight with excitement and anticipation. “The call was from Tony.”
“Tony! Don’t go. Please?” Steve eyes were pleading. His voice shook under that careful pretense, and Tony saw right through it. He sat back down, retaking his position next to Steve. They sat in a companionable silence for a while, much to both Steve and Tony’s surprise.
“Don’t talk to her like that,” snapped Clint, leaping to Natasha’s defense. She laid a hand on his arm, a silent message to back off of Steve. She knew he didn’t mean to talk to her in that tone, it was the same when he’d been on the run.
The team had established a routine – breakfast together, poring over blueprints, trying to decipher what was on Fury’s pager (who used pagers anyway!), lunch, more blueprints and plans, before finally retiring for the night. The same, always. Clint always hung out with Natasha, they talked, they held each other through the trauma – after all, what were best friends for?
Clutching Bucky’s bag to his chest, Steve was talking to it. It had become a daily ritual to him – to talk into thin air, addressing Bucky while holding his bag. Many might call him crazy, but it grounded him, as only Bucky could.
He was cut off by warm lips covering his own in a sweet, chaste kiss that was cut off when Steve murmured – “It’s as real for me as it is for you. I really want to give us a chance, Tony. It’s been so long, I’ve wanted to do that since forever.”
“Thank you, Legolas,” returned the scientist, the nickname slipping effortlessly past his lips. Clint’s eyes lit up at the sound of that name; he was forgiven. Tony’s eyes cast to the man who was standing in the corner, staring out of the window. He could have been a statue, save for the slight tremble in his shoulders, that he attempted to hide from the world.
“He is a fighter, and he will be fine,” she said, softly, the words meant only for him. He nodded jerkily, clasping her hand briefly, before freeing himself and making his way back up.
Tony swallowed. This was the hard part. Admitting he was in the wrong. But he had to do it, and he would do it.
“Tony!” Bruce moved faster than he had done in a long time, and reached to wrap Tony in a warm embrace. Tony hugged him back fiercely, incredibly happy to be back with his friends. One by one, they all greeted him, Rhodey hugging him tightly, cuffing him across the back of his head good-naturedly. Tasha hugged him as well, whispering an apology in his ear, which he waved off, planting a kiss to her temple.
“It was nobody,” said Tony, cutting through Steve’s tirade. “I came to check because in the last 13 weeks I have been here, the number of times I have seen you I can count off one hand. You’re cooping yourself up and you have the unhealthiest dealing mechanism.”
“Tony,” he said, his tone neutral as his eyes blinked the tears back with a practiced ease. This didn’t go unmissed by Tony, who was himself the master of that particular expression, a mask of indifference and of polite curiosity.
His eyes stung with the tears he refused to shed, his hands ached with how tight he had clenched them, but his attention was fixated on the spot where Bucky was, the spot where he had vanished when Thanos had delivered that ultimate, cruel, blow.
“Disappear, not die,” he said, his voice momentarily harsh. “I know war changes everyone, but this isn’t just that. He doesn’t do anything but work. I used work as a temporary respite from my issues and problems, but this is more than that, it is not healthy for him to live like this, super soldier or not.”
“Steve, hey,” Tony said, taking his hand tentatively. “We will do this, yeah? No matter what, we will avenge them. For everyone we lost. For Barnes, for Peter.” His voice shook at the last name, his entire body going rigid. Without thinking, without planning it, Steve pulled him close, pressing his lips to Tony’s.
The anger in him was too precious, to intimate to share. He trusted them, Nat, Bruce, Thor, Clint, hell, he even trusted Rhodey with it, but he couldn’t. He sat there on the floor, clutching the bag as if he hoped Bucky would suddenly spring from it, saying ‘Hey, punk’.
The others began moving to follow his orders, but Rhodey hung back. Steve opened his mouth to tell him something, to ask him, perhaps, but no words came out. He snapped his mouth shut, and exchanged his blank expression to one of polite questioning.
“Thanos has had his say,” he said, his voice sounding detached, even to himself. “We will have ours. The time for being passive is past, now is when we avenge. We aren’t called the Avengers for nothing. Natasha, get in touch with Clint, I want him here, no matter what. Bruce, see what you can do about a rescue mission, team up with Rhodey. Thor, I know that Asgardians will not help us, but I still need you to see what you can do about it.”
“He forgave you,” said Rhodey, as if reading Steve’s expression. “He forgave you, and he forgave Barnes. The only person he couldn’t forgive, was himself.”
Tony just huffs a breath, slight slip of air that sinks through his teeth, and shoves the paper at Steve.
"All your fault Pepper, honestly, look at me. I've got gray hairs. Now what did I do wrong this time?"
Steve feels like he's falling. Down, under, deep into something he can’t crawl out of. And then he's sighing, warm breaths in and out, and whose tongue is that, his or Tony's? There is a second heartbeat in his throat, firm beside his own, and suddenly he's smiling, wide and tongue and teeth, and he bumps Tony's nose, but he doesn't seem to care. Just smiles back, grips the back of Steve's neck till the angles just right, till the hum in his ears is steady and full and so is he.
"I think it's called a hand sprayer," Tony says, inches from his back still, and didn't Steve just make death threats about this?
Winter tumbles into spring, shaking the snow off the earth and spilling color into the sky. The ground softens, all wet earth, and Steve feels like he's blooming.
“Seriously,” Steve laughs, toes against the chill, cold chase of evening that bites at his cheeks, “skinny dipping?”
"I told a teeny little lie to Pepper that may or may not have spiraled," he groans, falling onto the couch and kicking his knees up to rest on Steve's legs, a thing of habit.
And he's there, standing in the doorway, all ink drop hair and watery smiles, and all Steve can think is that a year and a half is quite enough waiting for him.
And then the boy's laughing too, a lilting kind of thing, a chuckle that rings out like birdsong. And it's cold outside, a crisp autumn hum that seeps through the windows, but this thing between them is warm, filling up their bellies with coffee and sunshine.
The door hits him on the ass, and he is certain that cheeseburger has never sounded better, sputtering in the silence, empty rush of air as Tony laughs in the corner, heady kind of snicker that sticks to his teeth, and from somewhere up front a man says, “Hello?”
And he draws out a sheet of paper, all blank white parchment and clean lines, and he says, “What are you looking to have done?”
Summer had begun to dip into fall, right there in Café au Lait, a little brick and mortar building tucked between a flower shop, and old Mr. Jones' bicycle store. It was the kind of place where time stood still, sticky fingers begging dollar and dimes, sweaty hands passing change around in search of caffeine. The morning was bright, sticky sunshine dripping warm onto the pavement, spilling onto coffee and slick-warm bodies. The air was thick with heat, the kind of warmth that felt parched, all sweat soaked strangers crammed toe to toe in subway stations and busy terminals.
Winter's fallen onto the city with a thud, all snow covered building and icy doorsteps, and Tony shakes the snow from his boots as he steps inside. When he reaches the counter, his hand spills into his pocket, shaking out handfuls of tiny paper stars.
Steve, in the quiet of the night, will think of the way it feels to dream about falling. That jerk to consciousness, the moment between awake and down, down, down. He always thinks about Tony like that. Like he's falling right into him.
Tony Stark is a man of self-preservation. He built a heart out of steel so no one could break it, built it again just to do it better, wrapped iron round fists so no one could see his hands shake. He is no sleep, eight cups of coffee, always better, always more. Drinks whiskey like it's cheap and loves like it isn’t. But Steve Rogers is filling in the gaps, the wounds, doesn't let him reach for the bottle, kisses shaking fingers like it costs him nothing, and Tony lets him. He lets him.
And Tony’s laughing too, something giddy, rough in his jaw, shaking past his teeth with a hum that startles, low in his chest, bubble of something that melts off his tongue.
So he keeps a list. 101 things that make Tony Stark tick. It fills up the pages of his brain, endless, useless, miles and miles of pointless Tony Stark trivia.
“Anyway, the guide to a perfect cookie: Soft, but not too soft. Gooey, not doughy. Thin, but not brittle. And enough chocolate chips to drown that kid from Willy Wonka.”
The sheet bites at his knuckles, catches at his fingertips when he pushes it away, and the fury is suddenly drowning, biting and kicking at a current of grief, lonely and bitter and aching for breath.
There are moments where the world is a hush. Where the seconds between them fall quiet like pennies, drip to their toes and pool between ankles. There are moments where moments feel like mountains, where they pull and climb and reach, where the silence sounds like oceans to their heartbeats. There are moment where nothing is said, and everything is soft, and quiet palms reach through darkness to press kisses at pulse points.
And Steve knows it's dumb, but hope sat warm in his chest, and now it's cooling, the longer Tony just sits there, drawn and pale and shaken.
The woman shakes her head, a dizzy sort of thing, and she looks tired, older in a moment, like she’s had a lifetime of heavy moments.
And maybe it’s for a yes. Maybe it’s the silence, or the darkness, or a lifetime of empty bellies, but he leans over. Bends and bows and buries his fist in the folds of his jacket, and then he’s off, desperate, lungs full of air that’s all borrowed and bleeding, breaths that weren’t his but he shakes them down anyways, all carbon and excess, and maybe that’s why he’s dizzy, maybe he’s shaking and sighing and leaning into Tony like he can taste the rush of him, and then he is.
Steve kicked at him, gentle and laughing, so bright and full of love. God, Tony loves that word. He loves Steve. He should tell him again.
Tony Stark is all busy and bright and future, and Steve Rogers is still shaking, still tired. There is still water in his lungs, and they rattle when he yells, "big man in a suit of armor. Take that off and what are you."
The sky is spilling to the pavement, ruddy run of wishing that’s all Orion, and Tony won’t stop crying.
The sky melts to darkness at the lip of the world, cold hum of black that seeps to the water, brushing at their toes with a chill that startles. The stars play at dancing, laughing at the sun, shaking and sighing where the night kisses day. And Tony is smiling right with them.
They sit in silence, blinking at the sky as it blinks back, Tony’s finger still held at Polaris like the touch might ground him.
Steve leans against the doorframe, all pink cheeks and wide eyes. Tony lets out a muffled sound, struggling with his watch.
And then they eat their dim sum, and snicker at the chalkboard, and when they go to leave, Tony’s fortune says, ‘Time is a game.’
"You could have died," says Steve, and his cheeks are pink, but he's angry, words falling sharp from his tongue, spilling over and bubbling from his chest with the urge to hit something, anything.
And he’s still shaking, still sighing, but the rush of him is gentle, easy melt of mouths and teeth, and then Tony
"Not fucking well," and that's a weak argument to begin with, but Steve just shakes his head, and runs a little faster.
The shop is all low light and dry silence, and somewhere in the corner a fan sighs its last breaths. The desk is painted over, green as mold, and man at the middle has a name tag that reads, ‘Ashley.’
Clint shushes them, and a handful of popcorn lands in their laps, and whatever Tony was going to say is spoiled, expired, so Steve plops a kernel in his mouth and chews.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We use paper cups here," and he's trying to make a double shot iced vanilla latte, but Tony is insistent, following him down the cue.
Tony sneaks a glance at him, hands under the tap as the water washes over his thumbs, and settles in the divots of the glass he's holding.
"There's nothing to fix," he says, and then Tony's crying, shaking, fists curling around empty air before they find Steve.
“Everything but save the world,” he says, and he’s smiling, always smiling, but he wobbles with the weight of it.
“The brightest,” Tony says, crying with a stillness that nudges at his smile, “right next to the big dipper.”
It was a shuddering sound, a stilted exhale that shuttered and shook. Tiny felt the sigh to his toes, cool and sad and quiet.
There are moments, soft things, where the pit in his heart is quiet, but the ache in his chest is full force, living and breathing, a thing with fists that pull and tug. There are moments where they are nothing but boys, breathing in the silence of each others lungs, and Tony thinks, god, if only. There are moments that are words and heart, that sing songs to the broken in the space between his ribs, and Tony can't seem to figure out why that distance keeps pulling him closer when it hurts so bad to be far apart.
The black of the night is heavy where it lands, and it seems to stick in the hollow of his throat. The dark pools in the shadow of his rib, rubs at the silence in Tony’s own jaw, nips at his chest where Tony’s smile sits, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony and dim sum and Kroger bags and paper mâché miracles.
And Steve should speak, he should, but the words have claws, catching sharp in his throat, fingers like knives and torches that meld his teeth together with a click.
And Steve starts to laugh again, but Tony doesn’t smile. Just stares and stares and barely seems to breathe.
He's still crying, but it’s soft now, and his hands slide down to his wrists and still between his fingers, holding tight.
“I don’t want to save the world,” he says again, and it’s broken, shaking between his lips, a shiver of a thing that might have been an exhale.
When he closes that night, the tip jar is brimming, stuffed to the cusp with pennies and dimes and bills, big bills, and when Steve manages to catch all the change from spilling onto the tile, out falls a piece of paper.
Tony just smiles, lazy, spreading across his face like butter, till he opens his eyes. They catch on Steve's with a tug that feels like friction, and his hands come to rest on Tony's ankles.
And there's a smile on his face, but he must sound wrong, all wrong, because Tony stops, coming to a still, and just stares. Stares and stares, and then his cheeks go pink and he frowns.
"Clint's idea. Something about that smart house movie. I don’t even know if he knows what he's talking about, but it seemed like a good idea at 3am."
Tony is scratching at some equation, busy mind scattered neat across lined paper, and Steve is on break, tracing the lines of his body with a careful eye.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Tony fixes him with a glare, but he doesn't reach for the cup, so Steve considers that his good deed for the day.
"We run marathons, Tony," says Steve, and he's smiling like he's not quite sure how to stop, and Tony is hit by the sudden need to kiss him, so he keeps talking.
And then they're slipping, tripping over their own feet to grab hold of the sprayer. Steve reaches it first, tugging the spout free from the tile, coiled around the mop and still spewing water. The floor is slick, smooth, and is that soap?
“I don’t get tired of you,” is all he says, soft as the shadow of the sky, all cool darkness and quiet promises.
“Is there a point to this verbal assault,” Tony sighs, spitting it through his teeth like chalk, and Steve can’t stop laughing, easy in the light, the way the stars run muddy down the sky like they’re mouthing at the sidewalk, a lovely kind of kiss that pools silver at their ankles.
"Thanks, Pepper," he moaned, grabbing the coffee with steady hands, and breathing in the taste of it, sharp and warm and perfect.
The 'since we broke up' is quiet, fluttering behind her words, a whisper of all the things she'd never let them talk about. It sits in the silence between them, an ache, a cavern of something desperate to be filled, and maybe that's why he does it.
It's movie night, and Tony's got his feet in Steve's lap. Something Disney is playing on the screen, and Clint is singing along. The sky is a pinhole outside the windows, dark and small and empty, but there's nothing inside but laughter. The lamp sits in the corner, dim and soft, and Steve's got nothing but time.
Tony Stark walked into Steve Rogers' coffee shop at nine a.m. on a Saturday morning, and Steve, stubborn and fierce and whole, promptly forgot how to speak.
And Tony smiles. And Steve, beating back a grin, pulls out forty-two sheets of loose-leaf from his jacket pocket.
Tony pockets a fist full of fortune cookies on their way out, and all he says is, “What? You never know when we’ll need a bit of guidance.”
Tony just hums, heaving a breath as the sky melts through his shirt, sticking at his back as he tugs his collar in search of something cool.
Tony looks up from the pile of circuits on the table and grins, toothy and all too warm. Steve pries his collar from his neck.
And then he’s scooching in his seat, nudging at the aisle with the tips of his shoes, and saying, “Excuse me?”
The server comes around then, refilling their water glasses with a soft sort of smile, and Tony’s gone a bit wild behind the eyes.
They are sitting in the kitchen. There is a pot of coffee going, and Steve can smell it in the air. He is tired, fresh on nightmares and the heavy rap of his pulse in his throat. The kitchen is warm, sticky breaths in the heat of summer, seeping up from the floorboards to lodge in their ribcage. They are leaning heavy on their chairs, feet flat on the tiles and sticking with a plop.
Sometimes, in the quiet of the night, Steve will close his eyes, and imagine the sky. The kind of endless air that stretches between them.
"Make a wish," Tony says, soft in the coffee shop, Steve's heart tucked between careful fingers, "Make a wish. Any wish."
“Oh sure,” Steve says, smile all molasses as he swallows down a snicker, “almost as sexy as that bowl cut from fourth grade.”
Tony had his eyes closed, but from the way Steve's hand tightened a fraction in his hair, he could imagine the cool look Steve had settled on.
When he takes the tips out that night, there's forty dollars in bills, and two paper stars at the bottom of the jar. He tucks them into his pocket.
Pepper was not amused by his witty inner dialogue, clearly, and the pinched look turned something sour.
There are moments where the song of silence bubbles between them. Where the air is thick with a kind of heavy two men only know in the darkness. There are moments where the urge to bend, to shuffle, to ease right into something fragile, overwhelms him.
And Tony flips through the damn thing for what feels like an hour, careful eyes and steady hands, and then he stops.
"Tony-" Steve says, and Tony's not crying, he won't, not till this thing between them finally breaks.
Tony reaches back into the freezer, but before he can grab the ice, Steve is turning on the tap, water bubbling through the spout and pouring out through the tube, covering him in water.
"Make a wish," Tony says, hours or minutes later, when their breath has run ragged and their cheeks had gone pink.
They're in the kitchen. The radio is playing something Steve knows all the words to, and he sets down the whisk to wrap his arms around Tony. He sways, back in forth, and all Tony can hear is his heartbeat, firm and loud in his ears. Steve is a steady weight behind him, a warm presence, and he bends low, whispering the words to the song in his ear, and he just cant stand it. It's too warm, too soft, too good for him, and when he opens his eyes he's crying.
"Little risqué, I think, for a family business," Steve says, crooked grin as Tony marches into the shop.
"Really," she says, and she's smiling now, for the first time since they started talking, "who is it?"
The days melt on, dripping past each other, turning and sliding and sinking to the next, and nothing really seems to change.
And Steve has miles, ocean of time and a belly full of promise, and what’s a month to something like love.
Tony's head shifted in his lap, and he ran his hand through his hair again, long fingers slipping through the curls.
The days are heavy. Summer is faded and broken and beat its last breath. But Tony falls asleep with a smile on his face, and Steve’s got one last sheet of loose leaf in his pocket.
There's a shadow in the park, figures hunkered busy in the belly of summer, and Steve Rogers thinks love is the perfect thing for a Tuesday.
Days pass, shuffling into each other, turning like pages, sinking and drifting into the next. Summer steals into spring, burning up moments and dewy wet earth, and settles on a heat that scorches. Cotton presses tight to skin-soaked bodies, clinging to backs in the July heat.
Steve laughs, a heavy kind of thing, digging a bottle of whiteout from his pocket with a click, and Tony moans.
There is a hope in Steve's chest. There is a wish that rattles in his lungs. It catches and drags on Tony's hips, expands with each breath they share. Tony is an endless sky, big and dark and beautiful, a prayer for the stars.
Steve is pink cheeked just looking at him, and the chill that creeps up his spine as the breeze blows cold through the open door barely bothers him.
It's the kind of dizzy that only happens at the tip of the sky, a thousand feet above the grass, two boys with nothing between them but the stretch of darkness.
"Nu-uh, give it here," Steve says, tugging the mug out of Tony's hands. Warm coffee bubbles over the sides, dripping down the ceramic, and Steve grimaces.
They're jogging, two warm bodies in motion beside each other, and Tony's breath is drawn, coming out sharp. He huffs behind Steve, who laughs, sticky sheen of sweat just barely breaking out across his forehead, and fuck that guy.
"Shh. What do you want," he whispered, and his hand slipped back through Tony hair, fingernails running along his scalp.
Steve waits, eyeing Tony carefully as he waits for him to elaborate. Tony lifts an arm over his eyes, and sighs, and Steve lets out a snort.
The boy stared at him across the counter, fingers tightening their hold on the bill before he shook his head, blinking quick and saying,
Once she reaches the main hallway on the way to her room she glances both ways to make sure no one is watching before she ties something. Closing her eyes, she can feel her finger tips prickle like she's been zapped, and she can feel the energy inside her, so mentally she reaches out and grasps it. Making sure she's concentrating on her entire body before- there's a sudden gust of wind and a very quiet crackle before she opens her eyes and shes standing in the bedroom.
“Alright Jasmine, welcome to the Avengers Compound. It’s still a work in progress of course, but Peter and the rest of the internship gang usually show up and train together,” Tony tells her taking off his sunglasses.
“Friday keep an eye on the cameras for me and tell us when you spot her,” directs Tony before walking over the stand next to Peter. “Guess I’ll start at the beginning and keep it simple. A few days ago, there was a small breach in the lab and in my defense, I thought I was seeing things from lack of sleep, so I didn’t think too much of it. Until today when said breach shows up at our little charity event and turns out to be a nine-year-old child with teleportation abilities”.
“I get that, but what does Jasmine have to do with it?” questions Bucky still crouched next to the girl. Before Tony could respond he hears a small gasp and a sound like paper tearing before Jasmine disappears.
“You have a very interesting gift, but you can’t control it very well. We as a team came to the agreement to let you live here with us as a part of the Stark Internship. While you’re here we’ll help train you so you and others aren’t in any danger. You’ll still be going to school regularly, but you’ll also be working and training along side the avengers. While ‘blowing stuff up’ in the lab with Tony,” says Steve raising an perfectly arched eyebrow at Peter when he finished.
“I need to take a shower, but I’ll come by the lab later,” he pulls away and head for the door before turning around “one more thing both of use are off this Sunday as well so make sure you come to bed” Steve tells him sauntering out the kitchen. Tony was definitely blushing, and he was glad Steve had left already. Tony tended to forget that Steve had a bad side, but you can’t blame him the guy saves cats from trees at least twice a week.
Once we boarded the elevator to get to the sixth floor Ms. Potts turned to us , “you guys have done really well and now here’s the part you’ve waited for-“ the doors to the elevator open and Jasmine can barely hear the rest of the announcement over the cheers of the others as they all bolt out the elevator. To greet the Avengers who were waiting for them.
“Wait are you saying…” Tony takes a few seconds to process this information before stopping abruptly “She’s the girl from the recording the one that breached the security,” mumbles Tony to himself, but apparently, he wasn’t quiet enough.
Ms. Bean and the rest of the kids all walk in together with Jasmine trailing behind, the first floor was just a reception area where they were greeted again. The people there also took our picture and gave us badges to pin on our shirts that said we were ‘temporary Avengers’ on tour. Which marked the official start of the tour. It also helped to alleviate some of Jasmines fears.
“Anyway, what made you think I was the ‘coolest’ kid in school?” asked Peter smiling a little at the word.
Successfully distracted from his negative thought process Tony allows Steve to win this discussion… for now.
Tony couldn’t help but wonder when his life got so complicated. Even after coming out as Iron Man his life wasn’t nearly as crazy as it is now. No, he thinks to himself all this madness definitely started after becoming an Avenger.
“At the beginning of the week there was an undetected break-in located in boss’s lab at exactly 12:53 and lasted only about twelve seconds,” Friday informs them speaking from the comms each of them were wearing.
Tony clears his throat, “So, umm wanna get from under the table? Unless you don’t want to. I’ve gone though a few panic attacks myself and while I personally don’t like small spaces, if that works for you then you can stay there,” he informs her rambling. Him talking is something that usually calms Steve down when he’s having a panic attack, and a lot of the other Avengers also including himself.
“It’s no problem at all Jasmine, besides I actually like this part of the job. Bossing people around and making things perfect. Luckily for you I actually know a thing or two about interior decorating or everything would red and gold.” She giggles to herself. “Don’t worry about a thing. After you finish cleaning up Friday will lead you to the kitchen breakfast is almost ready. Bye.”
After that breakfast is relatively peaceful beside a few pieces of food flying across the table when Natasha and Steve weren't looking.
Tony took a small moment to wonder if Friday could read minds before speaking back to her, “Friday, baby do we need to have another conversation about privacy?” questions Tony only half joking.
Tony had just finished taking tons of pictures with the kids and was ready to bolt from the scene when Bucky approached.
The panic attack from earlier was noting compared to the one she was having now, the sound of a blow torch, maybe? Stopping is what causes Jasmine to finally look up and notice just how quiet it was. Meeting a pair of familiar brown eyes is all it takes for Jasmines panic to flare and with another pull she teleports again this time landing under her bed.
For the first time ever, Jasmine is surprised to not be awoken by the sounds of other children screaming, but instead she wakes up to the morning sun pouring in through large windows. It’s startling and for a moment Jasmine almost panics before she remembers the events from yesterday.
Crouching down one more time Tony holds out a hand to the little girl “Hey there, I’m Tony what’s your name kiddo?”
“Everyone here is your friend. You just have to talk to them,” she says kindly before walking back to the kitchen probably to fix lunch.
“Alrigh, you two eat quickly we have somewhere to be,” Tony tells both Jasmine and Peter as they sit down at the table.
“You can just call me Pepper alright sweetie,” when Jasmine nods she continues “So, I brought you some clothes for the day, and the rest of the things I had Friday order should be here later today along with some decorators. Which means by the time you get back to the Tower your new room should be complete!”
“It’s very nice to meet you Jasmine,” says Bucky crouching at little to be at eye level with the little girl. ”I take it you’re a little shy,” he says chuckling a little bit. “You shouldn’t worry about it too much between just the two of us even Captain America gets shy especially around new people”.
He sort of had a point Tony thinks to himself, but- “It’s different because she’s so much younger that the others and when I see how much she admires me it just freaks me out okay, like what kind of role model am I?” Tony questions sounding just a little panicky. Every time someone new comes into his life Tony can’t help but think of all the ways he can screw it up. Even with Steve after all the time that they’ve been together it’s just always a nagging thought.
"Hey Jasmine," calls Ms. Bean walking over towards where she was sitting at the blue kiddie table. Jasmine, didn't really like the color blue, and would prefer something pink or purple, but last time Jasmine voiced this opinion the older boys poured juice on her head. "Jasmine, remember you only have a little more time on the tablet before it's Lucy's turn," Ms. Bean reminds her causing Lucy to glance up and scowl at her before returning to watching something annoyingly colorful on TV. If she does that one more time, thinks Jasmine refraining from sticking her tongue out.
“Of course, I do because I’m just that smart. You make it seem like you’re no good with kids, but you’re actually great with them and they love you. Harley and Peter are just an example of a few. Think about all the student training at the compound who all look up and admire you. You’re great with them, so why should Jasmine be any different?” questions Steve honestly.
“Hey, hey calm down I’m not gonna hurt you alright,” Tony tells her crouching to eye level. Trying to appear less like a billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Even though technically he wasn’t a playboy anymore, he was happily in a relationship thank you very much.
"I know boss, however, I can't take credit for this," the moment she says that Tony's pulled back into a giant hug. Steve.
"I'll make sure I tell him that next time I see him," jokes Steve leaning down to place a kiss on Tony's cheek before walking out the kitchen.
Jasmine was surprised that none of the other kids noticed all the commotion going on over here, but a lot of the girls were gathered around Scarlet Witch watching her lift something off the ground with her magic and some of the boys had gathered around Captain America who was showing his shield around the rest of them were raiding the snack table with Thor.
Lunch went well for once, Dinner on the other hand was a disaster. Which caused them to end up going to bed later than usual because they had to clean up. Surprisingly Jasmines wasn’t tired she was too excited to even think about sleeping. They were going to the Avengers Tower, she couldn’t help repeating it to herself it was just so unbelievable. Jasmine was going to talk to the Avengers, the real Avengers. She wondered who would all be there, Thor? Black Widow? Scarlett Witch? Captain America? She really hoped Iron Man would be there he’s her favorite, he’s so cool and smart. Just thinking about it made her want to cry, and what about all the cool stuff they’d see. Do the Avengers have a pool? Or maybe Tony Starks lab filled with all his cool inventions, it would be an honor to see Mr. Stark working there. Jasmine barely had time to notice the pull of her powers before she was snatched from her bed and dropped unceremoniously onto a cold floor.
The moment Tony stepped in front of the door to his workshop he too a deep steadying breath. He could do this, she’s just one kid.
“My names Peter, I’m an intern at Stark Tower. Can you tell me your name?” Peter asks finally setting the girl back on the ground.
He blinks a little surprised before smiling slightly “yep that’s me you can just call me Bucky though”.
"Honestly I didn't think it would work. When Friday told Pepper you were on your way home early and talking the suit she called and asked me to keep you from getting to the lab. I thought you would've just plowed through me a headed straight for the lab. I mean i'm glad that you didn't," clarified Steve grinning his eyes sparkling.  Well at least someones happy, thinks Tony bitterly.
“Don’t you know better than to flirt with kids you creep?” questions none other than Black Widow standing with her arms crossed behind Bucky. Jasmine didn’t even hear her standing behind them.
Before he could open his mouth to respond, a voice interrupts them "Thanks for stalling him for me Steve, I'll take it from here," says Pepper standing in the doorway of the kitchen looking smug. Still very confused Tony looks back at Steve who's now wearing a similar smug look.
“Hold ya horses Tony, you got one more kid that really wants to meet ya,” announces Bucky his metal hand gently wrapped around the little girl’s he noticed when he first walked in. The one with the familiar bright green eyes. The girl sneaks a peek at Tony before looking back down again. “She’s a bit shy,” mutters Bucky.
“All right let’s make a deal Elsa, if you agree to attend the tour then I promise I won’t have Friday pull the fire alarm to cut it short,” Tony tells Bucky with a smirk.
Clint walks over to Thor and places a comforting hand on his shoulder “It’s alright big guy. You tried your best.”
Tony had only taken a few steps away before Friday starts taking to him from his ear piece, “Boss, I did a facial recognition scan on the girl you were talking to just now,” she informs him.
“YOU?!? Really? Wait- I don’t think that I’ve ever seen you at an Avengers meeting or anything before. Do you have powers, do you have a costume” Jasmine asked really confused.
“Nice work Boss,” Friday tells him through his earpiece. “Steve, Bucky, Peter, and Natasha are waiting for the both of you outside of the workshop.”
This was just a quick update because I haven't updated in a while, expect another one next week. You'll be introduced to more characters, and we'll have some more stony moments!!!
The room was decorated in a bunch of Avengers party supplies and almost everyone was there, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and even the Hulk…well Doctor Banner. Jasmine was a little disappointed that Iron man wasn’t there but everyone else was. The children from the orphanage all ran forward to talk to the Avengers, but now that they were all here standing in front of her Jasmine was a little nervous. Who should she talk to? What should she say? What if she said something stupid?
Honestly, he could always just wait here until they leave, but alas he made a deal with Bucky and there’s no backing out of that. Friday had already informed him about Bucky being at the party, so the only person left to arrive is Tony Stark.
Wearing her new clothes, a black and white quarter sleeved shirt and a pair of light blue jeans Jasmine grabs her purple hoodie wraps it around her waist and heads to the door leading out of her room. She takes a deep breath and just stands there.
Jasmine gets interrupted from the conversation when Bucky places a plate of food on the table in front of her. Bucky then in turn picks up and fork and throws it at Tony.
“Let’s finish this conversation inside the kitchen okay kid,” Tony tells Peter who nods enthusiastically “You too Jasmine,” he calls holding the door open for her. So much for going back to her room.
“Ignore Tony, and please take your time eating. You’re not in any rush and Tony make sure you actually eat something besides coffee,” Steve tells them walking over the kitchen to help Sam.
"I know Ms. Bean, also can I request back the time you used up to remind me of that?" question Jasmine politely. Ms. Bean simply raises a finely arched eyebrow in response before walking away. I'll take that as a no, mutters Jasmine to herself. Looking back at the table she couldn't help but sigh. Maybe she should check the news before she gets kicked off, hopefully they're talking about the Avengers.
For the life of him Tony couldn’t understand why all these kids kept showing up in his life. First it was Harley, then Peter, and now Jasmine. Maybe Pepper secretly started a daycare facility inside the Tower… which now that he thinks about it is a great Idea. He’s sure he has tons of employees with children who’d love to have a safe place to leave their children. He’ll have to make a note of that and save it for later.
To say Peter was shocked would be an understatement, but at least it explains the disappearing act she pulled on the stairs. However, one question was still nagging at him, “Why’d she run?”
When Bucky agreed to come to the meet and greet he wasn’t expecting to enjoy himself or talk to any of the other children. To be fair he wasn’t convinced any of them wanted to talk to him anyways. Being a master of stealth made it easy to blend in undetected, and just observe the chaos of what was once the living room. Sam was bringing in a steady stream of snacks that Thor was eating just as quickly, Vision was laying out some books for the children to take home along with their gift bags, and the rest of the team (besides Clint who was sitting up in the ceiling) were greeting children.
“You’re an amazing role model, and one day I hope you’ll be able to see yourself how those kids see you… how I see you,” Steve tells him leaning in and pressing their foreheads together. “You beautiful, strong, kind, and so very generous, and I love you Tony,” mutter Steve gently pressing a kiss to Tony’s lips.
Booored, thinks Jasmine as face plants into the couch in front of the television, cutting another glare at the children all gathered around the tablet. Jordan found some lame game and now everyone wants a turn on the tablet to play, which means Jasmine can’t use it and since there’s nothing about the Avengers on TV today she’s completely and utterly Bored, capital B. At a time like this she’s usually go and read a book, but the library won’t be donating any used books until next week and she’s tired of rereading the ones she already has.
Didn't I promise you Spiderman, also after the next chapter thing should have a better pacing and focus more on the Avengers as a whole and the missions they complete.
Jasmine allows herself a small victory grin before she starts thinking about what book to read. Maybe Harry Potter (again).
Which makes Jasmine both smile and blush “I-Um I’m Jasmine and it’s nice to-um meet you B-Bucky,” stutters Jasmine a little embarrassed at her own terrible speaking skills.
Peter couldn’t help but noticed the girl was shaking and crying; had something happened? Where had she come from?
“Alright, but what about all the stuff with Jasmine? You can’t expect me to ignore that until Monday, so got any advice smart guy,” questions Tony smugly.
So, Bucky walking over and talking to the girl was more of a heat of the moment situation, but after talking to her for a little while and hearing just how smart and charming she was he couldn’t help but wonder why she pulled away from her fellow students. Bucky also noted that the girl was insanely nervous and on edge. She kind of reminded him of Natasha in a weird way. Most people wouldn’t notice but Natasha was always looking around and checking her exits; its something ingrained into her after years of experience and always having something to hide. Bucky hopes this tiny girl doesn’t have any mind-blowing secrets to make her that nervous. At first Bucky considered it might be abuse, since it does happen commonly in orphanages, but he knows that Tony and Pepper are always looking into the places they fund and making sure that nothing illegal is happening; plus, the first thing he did before the children arrived was get a file on the teacher from Pepper.
However, the statement about Clint who Jasmine knows is Hawkeyes makes her glance up meeting the eyes of the archer crouched above them with a smirk on his face. Jasmine had noted when she first entered the room that he wasn’t there, but Jasmine just assumed he didn’t like parties. Apparently, she was wrong.
Bucky Barnes formerly known as the Winter Soldier became an official member of the avengers not very long ago, its safe to say he became a favorite overnight. Especially once everyone heard his backstory and all of the terrible things he went through, so after a few press conferences he officially became a member of the Avengers and one of Jasmines favorites at that. So it was taking everything in Jasmine not to squeal, but she was pretty sure she was grinning like an idiot.
“Alright let me go grab a photographer and then I’ll be right back,” he tells her standing up from his crouching position. His back was going to hate him tomorrow. Tony nods over to Steve and Bucky silently telling them to keep the girl busy while he finds a photographer that isn’t doing something now.
Which was true all she needed to do was breath, in and out, in and out, everything is fine she tells herself. Finally, after a few more deep breaths she the tightness in her chest went away and she was able to concentrate on the room again. However, the tips of her fingers still felt tingly.
The car stops (finally) and when Jasmine looks up at the building she’s genuinely surprised the building is huge and surrounded by an empty field and a forest towards the back. There was still construction going on mostly centered towards one side of the large building.
Hmm, Jasmine couldn’t help but think about her own situation. When she was being bulled she didn’t think she was better than anyone. Not to mention she lived in an orphanage, with strange powers she couldn’t control she was just really nervous to say the least, but later on Jasmine did become arrogant (after she punched Jordan in the face), but not to be mean she just decided she didn’t like any of the other kids in the orphanage because they were mean. She just couldn’t wait until they left, because Jasmine was pretty sure she’d never leave. At least that’s what Mrs. Chariot used to say.
After several more deep breaths Jasmine gently opens one of the large doors and peaks inside the kitchen.
“Alright, alright, I’m leaving,” mutters Tony knowing that if he doesn’t go see that children he’ll just feel bad about it later, and Steve will give him that kicked puppy look.
Apparently, Peter was a part of Mr. Starks internship program which Peter helpfully explained that it was basically a school thing where he worked on projects and other cool things with Tony Stark.
Peter couldn’t help the small glare he shoots in Thor’s direction while he looks on sheepishly, “Oops” he mutters.
“Hey,” calls the archer jumping down to land beside them “don’t drag me into this I was just watching to make sure nothing went wrong”.
"It's not all bad I save the best for last of course. Saturday I scheduled for an small orphanage in the area to come take a trip to meet the Avengers," announces Pepper sounding excited.
“What are you guys talking about?” interrupts Mr. Stark walking back in to the room with the rest of the team a small smile on his face.
“What break in security? And why wasn’t I immediately informed of this?” questions Steve standing at full height frowning at Tony. Tony also notices the girl beside him stiffen at his question.
From the corner of his shop he could hear small sniffles there she is. He walks slow and silently in that direction not wanting to frighten the small girl. He walks past DumE who turns towards him, but Tony places a finger to his lips keeping the bot silent. Luckily the other robots were on the other side of the lab or it would’ve been chaos in here, thinks Tony.
“Yeah, let’s go!” answers Peter enthusiastically. While Jasmine simply nods in response. Not feeling nearly as excited as Peter because she was just too nervous.
Peter laughs at that “definitely not,” he says. “Actually, I’ve always gotten bullied in school, but now I have awesome friends”.
“Wait- Peter you do hero training?” she questioned. Peter was just a really smart kid from school who had an internship why did he need training?
Should she just walk in, or would it be better to knock? Maybe she should just head back to her room.
Jasmine was definitely surprised to say the least, she was going to be apart of super hero training. Really, she thought she was just going to learn how to control her powers and then she’d get sent back to the orphanage and never see any of them again.
“Another all-nighter?” questions Bucky opening the fridge and grabbing a bottle of water. His long hair was wet with sweat (eww) and loose around is shoulders and he used his metal arm to pull some strands from his face. Of course, Barnes would know about his other all-nighters being a bit of a night owl himself. Tony didn’t think the guy slept at all really, there’ve been plenty of times where he’d come from a late night out of town or from the lab to find him standing in a corner (being creepy) or watching Disney movies. Not that Tony minded, they had their problems in the past especially once Tony learned about his parents but turns out Bucky is a pretty cool guy not that he’d ever tell him that, he already had one super soldier boyfriend and that was enough.
To say that Jasmine was nervous was an understatement, she’d nearly hyperventilated twice since she woke up. Ever since she’d accidentally teleported into what she could only assume was Mr. Starks private workshop she was terrified of getting in trouble. What if the Avengers were after her? She had broken in after all, it’s only logical that she’d get in trouble. Just thinking about it made her want to cry, and they were on their way to the Avengers Tower right now. Which before the incident she would’ve been super excited about, since a really cool bus was sent to pick them up and take everyone to the tower.
“Your lucky that I’m too tired to complain and that I enjoy seeing you sweaty or I’d have told all of you to get lost,” mumbles Tony staring at the coffee machine contemplating eating the coffee beans. Why was this thing so slow, maybe he should take it down to the lab and tinker with it, just a little?
Jasmine couldn’t help but be nervous as she climbed into the backseat of Mr. Starks fancy car. Especially since she didn’t exactly know where she was going. Peter climbed into the back with her because Mr. Happy was driving so Tony was in the front.
“Actually, I was pretty nervous about meeting all of you today and I wasn’t really planning on talking to anyone”, he answers truthfully.
Being nervous wasn’t Jasmines only reason for staying away she’s also scared of being recognized by Tony Stark and possibly getting in trouble.
Ms. Potts also talked about a new facility they were building other than the tower that would help to train other members of the Avengers. She said it would be finished by the end of the year and she also said if we were really good then we would get to have a tour there as well. Which sounded really awesome to Jasmine, now that’s how you bribe kids.
Pepper had told her that all of the other kids had already taken the bus back home, so she’d be staying the night. Which Jasmine thought was awesome, but she was sort of dreading going back to the orphanage especially since she sort of ruined the trip. Guess she can cross that off the list of things they get to do, right under museum trip.
Next chapter should be a little more fast paced, and it'll be in Tony's POV. It'll be about the surprise!
Once Peter gets close enough, he holds out a hand “Hi! I’m Peter. Remember me? We ran into each other on the stairs yesterday. Are you ready to eat breakfast because I’m starving!”
“Don’t even talk about this Saturday just thinking about it makes me ill,” mutters Tony placing his hand over his eyes. Overworking himself in his workshop, having to deal with the military and the government seemed like pretty simple things when compared to dealing with children.
“Umm ok Jasmine can you tell me how’d you get here, and what up set you maybe I can help,” says Peter softly trying very hard not to scare the girl. For once he’s actually glad he has such a kind face and voice.
Jasmine felt less nervous now that she knew where she was, but she still felt a little anxious considering she was going to meet more people. Jasmine was also starting to wonder if she’d ever stop feeling nervous because it was starting to get annoying.
“No way in hell Stevie, just because kids and old ladies fawn all over you doesn’t mean the same for me. I’ll be a Shield doing some training drills,” Bucky tells them causing Steve to sigh. Tony guesses this is a conversation they’ve had before. It was trivial things like this that used to make Tony jealous when Barnes first came to the tower. It seemed like Steve was always around the guy and they were always talking, yet even when they weren’t speaking things just seemed comfortable between them (which was weird because silence drove Tony crazy). It would’ve been enough to make any normal person doubt themselves and their boyfriend. Not that Tony believed that Steve would ever cheat on him, but back then Tony was convinced that Steve was too good for him and deserved better, and honestly you really can’t get any better than a super soldier. So, for the first couple of months while Bucky was getting settle in Tony barely ever left his lab content to just waste away down there. Tony didn’t realize how this was affecting Steve and the rest of the team until Bucky came barreling into his lab one night demanding that Tony checked his left arm because it seemed to be pulling. Which led to a situation where Tony had no choice but to listen to Bucky chew him out about breaking Steve’s heart and how we were both idiots and if I didn’t go see him he’d lock both of us in a room together. Safe to say everything worked out.
