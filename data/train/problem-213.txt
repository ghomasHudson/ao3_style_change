“You can, John. You absolutely can. The only thing stopping you at this point is yourself. But I’m not going to let you stop yourself. I’m going to show you how to open yourself up to the world and show them exactly what you’re made of. Because I’ll be damned if you aren’t the most talented pianist I’ve ever heard, or met, in my life.”
Sherlock shook his head. “Nonsense. You were born to be a musician, and nothing was going to keep you from that path forever. Not even that fancy doctor job you were so determined to have.”
He sighed and leaned back in his seat, praying that sleep would wash over him and he would be back in London sooner. Out of the corner of his eye he caught John lightly bobbing his head to a song playing through his headphones. His eyes were shut, and a soft smile rested on his face. Sherlock was delighted at the sight. He remembered how tense he’d been throughout the whole flight to the United States.
But he was…oddly kind. He did not make a fuss when John made mistakes, and it didn’t take long for them to bring the piece back up to speed. The few glances John got of Sherlock playing took his breath away. His hands glided effortlessly over the instrument. He didn’t know much about he violin, but he knew that left-handed pizzicato was not an easy accomplishment. It must have taken him months of practice. Yet, it looked like he was born playing this piece. Even in the carpeted recital room, his instrument sang like nothing he’d ever heard before.
He didn’t want to lose Sherlock. He couldn’t. He was one of the greatest people John had ever met, he was sure of it… he wasn’t ready to give all of that up.
I am,,, the worst at updating. I'm so sorry. But! It is finally fall break so I have some time to catch up. I won't promise anything, but I'm gonna try really hard to get another chapter up before Wednesday. I'm really excited about this story! It is so funny because I already have the ending written up, I just have to get there... stay tuned!
Without missing a beat, John took off. And it was as though the music was playing itself and jumping right off of the page. John moved with such passion and rigor that he’d never felt himself use before. What was happening now? What was so different?
“You really should stop getting so drunk, you know,” Sherlock teased. “Especially when you don’t have Mike or Molly to babysit you.”
Why was Sherlock… frustrated that John wasn’t studying music? Why was Sherlock frustrated that some day they may never play together again?
“They’re pulling for you, John. They’re playing indifference, but I can see it in the disappointment in their eyes. They all saw your recorded audition. They all
“Sorry,” Molly whispered, bouncing where she stood. She couldn’t hide her excitement. Her grin took up almost half of her face. And Mike just looked completely dumbfounded that he’d been left out of the loop with the whole Sherlock situation until what he assumed was last night when they couldn’t get a hold of John.
Two weeks had passed since Sherlock arrived home from his Julliard audition. And now, sitting in front of him was an envelope from Julliard. He had ripped it open as soon as he pulled it from his mailbox and he stood there, shaking. He immediately texted John, insisting that he come over to his flat as soon as humanly possible. John had texted back in what felt like a text panic that he was on his way.
“I’m good enough, I suppose,” John said as he sat down across the table from Sherlock. “How are you doing, Sherlock?”
John reluctantly walked up to join the group. They talked about lots of things, but they mostly talked about people; they talked about how one girl’s head was too big, or one guy’s hair was too long. He nervously tightened his grip on his map of the school. His game plan was to simply get through the day without any help; just stay invisible. If nobody noticed him then he wouldn’t get picked on by anybody.
The rehearsal ended. Sherlock gave a curt goodbye and thanked John again for his time before rushing out of the room. Without thinking, John pulled out his phone.
“Good. Great actually.” Sherlock fidgeted nervously in his seat. “I, um… I wanted to ask you something, John.”
“Nothing was stolen, and they were arrested. Sherlock let me sleep in his spare room and he even gave me breakfast when I woke up.”
Before Sherlock knew what had happened, he was jumped. He felt a needle slide into his neck before he went unconscious.
“The hell was that for, Sherl?” he snapped, whipping around to face the taller man. Sherlock knelt down so he was at eye level with John sitting at the piano stool, before pulling him into a bruising kiss. John’s grunt of surprise melted into a pleased groan as he kissed back. For a moment, just a moment, all he could think about was how soft Sherlock’s lips felt sealed against his own.
“I love you too, you stupid idiot,” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips. He felt him smile, and John’s heart swelled.
Sherlock smiled. It was almost too easy to get under John’s skin. Was he the worst boyfriend in the world for doing these things to him constantly? Probably. John still loved him, though. Despite all of his flaws, John still loved him.
John nodded and stood shakily from the piano. Sherlock gave him a once over. “Did it really wear you out that much, love?”
“Because I’ve never loved before…I don’t want to mess it up John. Knowing myself and knowing Mycroft if I don’t mess something up, then surely he will…”
"Oh, uh, sorry. In a bit of a rush," he said hurriedly, rushing to pick up the papers that were now flying out of his reach. Mycroft reached down and helped him.
It was Sherlock who found it first. An envelope from Juilliard. A… a large envelope. With John’s name on it.
“Shut up, Mycroft!” Was he stupid? Of course Sherlock was in love with John. As if Sherlock would actually say such a thing to his brother. Sherlock never told his brother anything. He was into politics, twisting words was his passion.
“Don’t be strangers, you two,” Mike said, crossing the room from where he sat to pull the both of them into a tight hug. “Keep Molly and I posted. We’re always rooting for you boys.”
that. I can hear the things that you’re trying to tell me when you play that damned violin, and I’ll be damned if I’m going to let you walk away from your life. I’m not going to let you do what I did. Walking away from the piano was one of the biggest mistakes I’d ever made, and if I’d never met you, it never would have been corrected. Don’t do what I did. Don’t be a complete idiot.”
“I do think that. I’ve thought it since the very first time I heard you play.” Sherlock said, his voice firm. John had no response but another blush as his hand moved to rub the back of his neck. “So, if you do ever decide that medicine isn’t your area—"
Sherlock took a sharp turn in an attempt to lose Mycroft. Eventually he outran his brother and caught a taxi. Breathless, he gave the driver John’s address. He turned his phone off. He didn’t need Mycroft trying to track him or anything.
"No, please... don't say it's alright, you and I both know that it isn't so let's not try to fool ourselves... I know I put you through a lot of pain. When Mycroft took my phone and sent the text that the line had been disconnected, I swear I could feel your heart shattering, John. For the first time in my life, I'm putting other's feelings before my own, and that's what scares Mycroft so much. We've always been the reclusive Holmes brothers, the geniuses that know everything and say nothing to anyone because nobody is as intelligent as we are. As much as I hate my brother's method of doing things, I understand why he did the things he did... he was afraid of losing me. While he hates to admit it, I'm the only one on this Earth who is even remotely similar to him. If he loses me, he has no one; and while he won't admit it, I think that's the thing that Mycroft fears most: being totally alone. Just like anyone else on this planet, he shares that same fear. Nobody wants to be alone..."
“Will you be joining me in the shower, love?” Sherlock asked, winking playfully. John just rolled his eyes in response.
John slowly stood up and pulled on his pants and socks. He threw his shirt on over his head. It was 6:10 when he was ready to leave.
John took several shaky breaths before giving Sherlock a curt nod. He left the bathroom and walked back towards the stage with a quivering purpose. He walked out towards the piano and made no regards towards the judges. No words were spoken, no eye contact was made. He hardly even peaked out of the corner of his eye towards the judges table. Instead he cleared his throat as he sat down at the piano bench again. He took a deep breath, and let his hands fall onto the keys that were so familiar to him.
John felt the anxiety twisting in his gut. That must be Sherlock’s way of saying ‘Hey, I’ve got a question…’ John hated it when texts started like that. 9 times out of 10 it led to some sort of disaster.
“Is that the John who plays the piano with you? The one you are always talking about after your rehearsals?” Mrs. Hudson asked with a grin, as if she knew exactly what she’d just said and said it that way on purpose. Sherlock nearly choked on the biscuit in his mouth.
have to set an alarm. Couldn’t we one day just take a nap and wake up when we aren’t tired any more?”
Sherlock pulled John around so they were facing each other, and John swore he’d never seen such an intense gaze in those beautiful blue eyes.
Sherlock accepted this as John’s forgiveness and they made their way to John’s front door. Before John could open it, it was swung open, revealing his mother.
John’s face flushed as he stared blankly at the home screen of his phone, wondering when this stranger’s number was going to appear. It wasn’t until an hour later that the new phone number popped up onto his screen.
Sherlock had one last performance at the Royal Academy before his graduation, and John was more than happy to oblige to be his accompanist one last time before he may or may not ever play the piano again professionally in his life.
John was more than a little nervous as he walked into the practice room the next evening, waiting for Sherlock to arrive. He wondered how obviously desperate he would look, having arrived 30 minutes early for this rehearsal. He’d nearly forgotten all the sorts of etiquette for rehearsals and performances. He was starting to wonder if this was something he was going to regret.
When John walked in with Sherlock, Angelo absolutely lost his mind. He went on and on about how he knew that Sherlock was going to find some man someday who had the guts to put up with all his pretentious air. He was going to meet his match and it was going to change his life forever.
“I’ll get him out here. Please, I promise you that you’ll be making a grave mistake by not considering him for your program.”
He had never had another person in his flat before; he didn’t exactly know how he felt about it. All he knew was that he didn’t hate it, and that was a strange feeling to have absent from him in this sort of situation. Why the hell was John so different?
He threw his hands up in the air before slamming them back down and almost lunging across the table, getting himself even closer to John. “The way you play once you’ve lost yourself in the piece is something the greats can only
In a matter of seconds, John found himself pinned down on the sofa, Sherlock hovering threateningly over him, that damned towel somehow
Without warning, John and Molly both broke away and ran to give each other one last hug. Mike joined in, wrapping them both up in his arms. A last pair of arms wrapped themselves around the group, and John felt Sherlock’s chin come to rest atop his head.
“Fine,” Sherlock whispered, bringing his hands gently to the hem of John’s t-shirt. “Maybe a logic puzzle then? Like… why haven’t you taken
“Oh Sherlock, that’s incredible!” John pulled Sherlock into a tight hug. When they pulled apart again, John was all smiles. But Sherlock could still see the sadness in his eyes. “When do you apply?”
“No thanks, I think I can manage,” John replied almost too quiet for him to hear. “Thank you for catching this for me by the way.”
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?!" Sherlock shouted into the phone. There was a laugh before the call was ended.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter!!! I am really so into this story and I really hope you all are enjoying reading as much as I am enjoying writing!
“Well, I must be off Mr. Holmes,” John blurted out before Sherlock could finish his sentence. John didn’t want to hear the end of it. It would just make this whole situation all the more confusing, and that was not something he needed to deal with right now. “Thanks again for the opportunity to play. Good evening.”
“I believe this is yours,” he said with a slight smile. His voice was very deep and husky. “Don’t worry, he shouldn’t mess with you too much. He only likes to rough up new students once. What is your first class, I could walk you, if you like?”
Sherlock waved his hands and stood up. “Absolutely not. That was phenomenal. Let’s call it a day, you should rest your hands after a run like that.”
“Oh, I do wish you would stop acting so foolish, Mycroft. You’re acting like a 15 year old girl. I’m actually surprised more people haven’t mistaken you for one.”
Sherlock nearly fell out of his chair. The voice on the line continued as though he’d heard nothing at all.
John scoffed. “I think you’re thinking of yourself, Mr. Prodigy. I’m not exactly a world-renowned pianist here.”
“Sherlock,” John started, voice shaking. “Why didn’t you tell me? Why did you… why did you let me get in the way? You should have just left me in that bathroom, if you’d known it was going to cost you… everything.”
“He just texted me,” John said, and Mike and Molly went quiet. “I’ll go talk to him now. I’ll get this all figured out, Molly.”
John cupped the bottom of the phone with his other hand. “Love, please breathe. Deep breaths. 7 seconds in through your nose, 11 seconds out through your mouth. What’s going on?”
We're almost there, folks. This is technically _the end_ but I have one more little surprise before I call this story officially over. ;)
Eventually the applause died down and the lights in the house came back up. Audience members trickled into the lobby and orchestra members filed backstage to pack up their instruments and get ready to go home. John waltzed into the nearest restroom and threw some cold water into his face, attempting to settle the fierce flush in his face.
“Preludium and Allegro! A classic… I haven’t played it in ages. But, the piano part doesn’t have anything too crazy. And since we are only a month out from the next performance, I figured it would be good to return to a piece I was more or less familiar with. It’s always good to do that sort of thing, you know.”
John muttered something Sherlock couldn’t understand as Sherlock pushed him towards the spare bedroom. He watched as John flopped unceremoniously onto the mattress. Sherlock took the comforter and laid it over him before shutting out the light and closing the door. He then grabbed an extra blanket from his own room and set up camp on the couch. He figured if he slept out here he would hear John trying to leave or do something stupid while he was drunk.
Mike gave a slight chuckle. “Don’t stay there too long, mate. See you back at the flat. We’re almost done here.”
As his first day of school was quickly approaching, John grew more and more nervous. He never really fit in with other kids. He suffered from severe social anxiety. Every time he was out walking on the streets with his neighborhood friends, he was always picked on. He grew depressed with each day, but he hoped that his friends would keep him distracted. Sooner or later, all of his friends left. He was left alone with his thoughts. He began to harm himself sometimes, when the thoughts became too much. On most occasions he would just lay in his bed, staring at the ceiling. He’d lie awake until 3 in the morning until his thoughts got the best of him and he was able to cry himself to sleep. Nobody could ever understand, not even his parents, how he was so depressed. Therefore, they shoved it off and acted like it was nothing, treated it like a phase. This of course caused John greater stress. The thoughts were able to overpower him more often until he was harming himself a least once a day.
At the end of the day when John made it home he took out his phone and put in Sherlock’s number. He wanted to text him right then, but he also didn’t want to seem desperate.
“The application is due in a few weeks. I’ll have to travel there for my audition. And then, if I get in—”
After a few more minutes, Mrs. Hudson came in with a tray holding two cups of steaming tea and a plate of freshly baked biscuits. She put it down gently on the coffee table, and Sherlock sat up.
Sherlock nodded shyly, but he wasn’t ensured. He knew Mycroft was going to tell John about his drug addiction if he didn’t. But he just couldn’t bring himself to do it. Sherlock sighed in defeat, and he forced the thought to the back of his mind.
John stood off stage, his palms sweating and his heart racing. His first performance as a professional musician. He was fresh from The Juilliard School of Music, and he was about to have his first performance as the
"You're mother was very worried about you, John. Perhaps we should have started walking you home sooner. I don't know exactly what time I went to your house, but it was quite a while ago..."
"You hadn't been at school for two weeks, John. I went to your house to see if you were there. I needed to apologize and make sure you hadn't... you know."
Mike gave him a firm pat on the back. “Well you’ve earned a night of relaxation, so let’s have some dinner and get some movies going, yeah?”
also??? I really like ending chapters with characters falling asleep apparently. just a nice way to wrap up segments I suppose. *shrug*
John hesitated. Sherlock noticed this and pulled away immediately. He looked at John with grave concern.
Sherlock nodded before he pulled Mike into a hug. John gaped and Molly threw a hand over her mouth in shock.
So what if he happened to be falling in love with— no. No, none of the L-word. John was not falling in L-word with Sherlock Holmes. He was a bloody prick, he was. Nothing more. Sure, he had gorgeous brown hair and beautiful eyes that John loved to stare into. Especially when he was excited about something—
He had a good feeling, and he hoped it would follow suit. Once they arrived at John’s flat, they resigned to spending the day lazing around the apartment, alternating between watching various television programs and playing games together. John seemed to be faring better than he had the previous night, but he kept a sharp ear out for the mail truck in the hopes that today was the day.
“Perhaps the diner located on Broadway wasn’t the best option for Mr. Hoity-Toity violinist,” he teased, elbowing Sherlock in the side. Sherlock grumbled something about how he’d have a serving of waffles and shoved his closed menu across the table, crossing his arms over his chest like an upset child.
“What exactly happened?” Mike asked as John observed her hand, noting intense bruising around the wrist.
John sat there blankly, hardly blinking. He stared at Sherlock for what felt like ages. A blush creeped up Sherlock’s face and he looked away, stammering around incomprehensible words trying to form an apology. He eventually composed himself enough to speak actual words. “Oh, I completely understand. It was a silly question; I should have known-”
John reached the end of the piece. He let his hands slowly retract from the keyboard and he sighed as though he’d been holding his breath throughout the entirety of the piece. He stood, bowed, and hastily made his way off of the stage. He immediately fell into Sherlock’s embrace with tears streaming from his eyes. Sherlock’s eyes flicked back to the judge’s table. They furiously scribbled down notes as they discussed. They were all wearing impressed smiles.
The two of them laid there staring up at the stars, absentmindedly pointing out various constellations.
Sherlock grabbed John and pulled him towards his room, opening the door. He pushed John inside, and turned to Mycroft.
“You’re playing too strictly with the tempo, John. Remember, they’ll have already seen that you have technical talent, so they’re going to want to see more personal flair than mastery with the piece.”
“Come on, Jim, it is his first day, just let him be,” he heard a voice behind him say. He turned around to face the looming figure behind him.
“You know, John… The Royal Academy of Music would take you in a heartbeat,” Sherlock said. A silence filled the room.
John stood up, shaking his head. “No, no. There is nothing to ‘handle.’ I’m just his accompanist! The stupid accompanist to this stupid bloody prick of a violinist…”
Sherlock’s eyes went wide as he regarded John for several moments. He… he wasn’t throwing away his happiness. He was going to go after music. He wasn’t going to let everything go. This… maybe this wasn’t the end. Maybe this was just the beginning.
“Well, it’s been one hell of a ride,” Mike said, clapping a hand on John’s back. “But mate… we graduate tomorrow.”
John blushed as he sat down at the table. “You’re giving me way too much credit, Sherl. I ran off the stage a crying mess, remember? No matter how well I did the second time, I’m sure they’re going to take that into consideration.”
“It is too late for me, Sherlock,” John sighed, his face falling. “I’m two years out from being done with medical school, I can’t just drop it. Not now.”
But at the same time, he knew exactly how. Somewhere out in the audience, the amazing Sherlock Holmes is sitting there, ready to cheer him on louder than anyone else in that audience. Well, maybe not as loud as Mike and Molly. Not in volume anyways. But in spirit, Sherlock’s cheers would always be the loudest. Because it was all thanks to him that he was sitting up on this stage in the first place.
“You better text us all the time!” Molly shouted. “If I don’t know what you’re doing every five minutes I might go crazy!”
John simply followed the other group of kids as they got off of the subway and walked. Once he arrived at the school, he was already able to point out at least 3 groups that would probably want to rough up the new kid. However, while he was busy scoping out the school, he didn’t notice the rather large student approach him from behind.
Sherlock pulled away from John and walked towards the window of the hotel room. “We’ll discuss this more later, John. Right now, let’s focus on you and your audition.”
to meet you. You were always this smarmy, uptight git that I heard horror stories about from Molly. I never expected you to be this ethereal being. Perfection incarnate. I never expected to be sucked back into this…
John blushed furiously, but he still hesitated. “Isn’t it too late to audition for this year? You’ve already auditioned and gotten your acceptance letter. So, the period is over?”
John tried to shove away the deep huskiness he thought he heard in Sherlock’s voice when he said that, and he tried to ignore the way Sherlock’s hand moved up his thigh ever so slightly before he pulled his hand away and leaned forward, reaching for his cup of tea. He grabbed the remote to the television with his other hand and turned it on, mindlessly flipping through the channels.
“New York is hard,” he muttered, letting the door slam behind him. He set the food down on the table and walked over to the bed, sitting down next to John. “Maybe Julliard was my worst idea yet.”
John almost hadn’t registered that they had made it to the end of the piece and Sherlock was standing there, a small gleam of sweat covering his face. He tried to make it look as though he hadn’t been staring at him in complete awe. He was sure that would look much creepier than he was intending.
At this point, Sherlock stood up and walked over to where John was laid down. He dropped himself down so he was hovering above him. He leaned down and stole a kiss before pushing himself back up. John was looking off to the side. He used one hand to pull John’s face towards him. “Love, look at me.”
John nodded and brought his hands to his face, attempting to rub away the anxiety and the fatigue that the anxiety was bringing upon him.
“Whatever… what will we be playing, your highness?” John asked, trying his best to not be embarrassed about how this complete stranger just walked in on him having an argument with himself.
“Bloody time zones!” he shouted, leaping from his chair and running to the bedroom to grab his computer. All the while John stood in the kitchen, concern marking his features.
John shuddered as Sherlock gently pulled John up before pulling his shirt off in one swift motion. John looked up at him with concerned eyes.
Several weeks passed of the same unaware flirting between John and Sherlock. They were both about at their wits end. Neither of them had any idea what was going on, and they weren’t sure of exactly how they were supposed to push the situation forward.
Sherlock had missed the past few days of school. John was growing increasingly worried about him. He hadn’t responded to any of his texts or calls. He didn’t want to act like the obsessed partner who called every five minutes, but after the show between Mycroft and Sherlock, he knew that those two weren’t afraid to rip each other apart if they had to. As soon as John got home, he pulled out his phone and texted him.
John rolled his eyes before situating himself on top of his boyfriend, straddling his thighs. “This is just your living room chair, you drama queen. Maybe you should have majored in theatrical performance instead of the violin.”
“Hey!” Jim shouted. John jumped in his seat and looked up at him. He attempted to keep the fear out of his eyes, but he knew he was failing desperately.
"Please…do whatever you want to me…don't cause John anymore pain. Please, he can't take anymore…please."
As though that was a cue, John fell into wrecked sobs and burrowed into Sherlock’s embrace. And that’s when he was certain that this was truly the beginning of something wonderful. John’s life was going to change, and he was going to realize what incredible talent he truly possessed.
John’s hand flew out against the side of the stall he was in. He took in shaky breaths. He tried to do the breathing exercises that Sherlock had taught him, but it was no use. He didn’t want to lash out at Sherlock, but he was the only one here. “It isn’t my destiny, Sherlock! It’s the one that you designed for me. I never asked for this!”
“Oh, John, you’re going to be lovely! I just know it. You’ve always had the air of a true musician about you!” Molly exclaimed, pulling him into one of the tightest hugs she’d ever given him.
He flopped down onto the couch, face buried in his hands. He groaned and muttered under his breath. All he wanted was sleep.
“Thank you for keeping your eye on him all these years,” Sherlock said. “I’ll do my best to keep him in line.”
“Oh, believe me,” Sherlock said, his voice elated. “I cannot begin to express my excitement. I cannot wait to join your school in the fall.”
John nodded. “You don’t think its possible they do it “express” or whatever the hell they do over there?”
In about 15 minutes they arrived at the academy. It took them a few minutes to find where Molly and her violinist had been practicing, but with the help of Molly’s directions through text, they eventually found the right room. They were immediately bombarded by a frantic Molly. John took her hand gently into his and examined her wrist. It definitely looked like it could be broken.
“Holmes, Sherlock?” The judge on the left called out, her voice sweet. It was as if they’d specifically chosen her so the people who were already nervous wrecks like himself wouldn’t up and run off the stage.
John waited about 5 minutes. He attempted to work on some homework to pass the time; he knew he would never get a response if he just stared at his phone. He finally got a response about a half hour later.
He wandered over to his suitcase and pulled out a pair of jeans and a casual jumper. He’d never been so ready to get out of a suit in his life. He just wanted the two of them to be able to relax again, at least for a little while. Now that they were both awaiting serious decisions from Julliard, he knew the peace wouldn’t last.
He didn’t want to lose Sherlock… What if Sherlock never talked to him again if John declined wanting to be his partner?
“No,” Sherlock started, thrusting himself out of his chair, causing Molly to recoil and take several steps back. John stepped forward, so he was between Sherlock and Molly.
“Your eyes only light up like that when it’s him. Though they shouldn’t. I told him to erase your number.”
Mycroft laughed. Oh how Sherlock knew how to argue, he would give him that. And he was right; he knew exactly who Jim was once he’d seen him. While his figure wasn’t the best, he carried himself more confidently than anyone he’d ever seen. Anyone other than himself, that is.
Despite the insult, there was little to no venom behind it. John finished brushing his teeth and rinsed his mouth before shutting the lights out and climbing into bed next to Sherlock. The brunet immediately curled up to him and let out a contented sigh.
John didn’t text back for a few moments. Sherlock figured he’d started crying about how romantic it was.
“Just try to stay calm, keep ice on that wrist, John and I are on our way,” Mike said, before he hit the end button on his phone and stuffed it into his pocket. He and John immediately went outside and hailed a cab.
“Please let me take you home to at least get some more of your things if you’ll be staying with me longer? I feel like I’ve completely and utterly ripped you out of your life. I don’t want you to cast everything you care about aside simply because I’m having a hard time right now.”
“He was quite drunk, so I put him to bed before he could do any more damage,” Sherlock said, picking up one of the biscuits and taking a bite.
Before they fell asleep, Sherlock planted a soft kiss on the back of John’s head, hugging him closer.
“Oh, enough with the nonsense,” Sherlock said, throwing John some clothes. “Change into these and go to bed. You’re so drunk I can smell it.”
"John?" Sherlock called out into the dark room as he slowly opened the door. In the dim light filtering in from behind him, he saw John tied up to a chair like he had been, his head hanging limply. John let out a groan; he must be awake.
John whipped around, a blush flooding his cheeks as he saw Sherlock standing in the door way, violin in hand. He could have sworn he saw a smirk on his damn face, but it was gone in a second.
Sherlock’s thumbs danced over the keyboard. He was going to reply to John’s texts. He had to. He just had no idea what to say. He knew if they talked in secret, well, it wouldn’t be a secret for long. He needed to tell John to leave him alone himself so he would. Sherlock had never felt like a bigger arse in his life, but he needed to… right? Yes, of course. Mycroft might be an unbelievable pain but he
John gave Sherlock his look to signal that he was ready to listen. Sherlock let out a shaky breath before continuing.
Sherlock met her gaze with equal intensity. “I’m not bribing anyone, I’m simply speaking the truth. And you’ll be eating those words once you hear him play.”
The same anxiety John felt the other night when he asked him to be his accompanist again was creeping back into John’s chest. He looked back at the application for the Academy. Sherlock had put it there on purpose.
He was falling back in love with music, but it was more than that. He was falling in love with Sherlock Holmes, and he wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of their days playing music together.
“What… my fault?” Sherlock asked. His common sense told him not to push John on the subject while he was intoxicated, but he had no idea what John was on about.
“Well,” Molly said, smirking at John. “Considering that I’ve never seen Sherlock act this way in all the years I’ve known him, I’m assuming this is how he reacts to feelings that he doesn’t understand.”
“I’m going to get a cab back to our flat,” John said, hesitant. He gave a sideways glance at the piano that sat across the room. “I want you to take her to the hospital.”
Once they’d left the room, John turned and walked towards the piano. He refused to acknowledge the violinist’s presence.
“Oh, plenty, plenty; though I have had to rule out quite a few possibilities. Apparently using toxic chemicals on other people is frowned upon.”
Then John started to realize that maybe it wasn’t all about how he didn’t want to let go of playing the piano. Sure, it had all been like a dream and John dreaded the day he’d have to leave behind that gorgeous piano he’d been playing for the past several months. But, John? A musician? Preposterous. He could hardly imagine it. It had been Sherlock that had made this whole experience so exhilarating. From their pre-rehearsal tea to the short breaks they took laying on the floor and talking about all sorts of things, John loved it all.
Sherlock gave him a playful wink before linking arms with the shorter man. “Well, my love, shall we get going?”
Within moments, at least what felt like moments but he couldn’t be sure, he was greeted by warm arms around him and Sherlock whispering quiet words to him in the darkness. John moved his hands from his face, and he could see the gleam of fresh tears on them from the lights trickling in from outside. He didn’t realize he’d been crying. Without speaking, he leaned further into Sherlock’s embrace, wrapping his arms around the other’s waist.
John wasn’t sure what he was supposed to make of that, but before he could think about it too long, Sherlock stood up.
Jim read the note aloud, trying his best to mimic Sherlock's voice. Of course, it hadn't been Sherlock who'd given him the note. But hey, whatever hurt John the most was fine with him.
“Oh, you’re that Holmes lad! You’re in the newspaper sometimes; for solving crimes and such. Do you think you could find John? He’s been missing, I’m so worried about him… he gets very upset sometimes and he’ll do crazy things…”
” he started. It was the first portion of the first coherent thought he’d had since he saw that letter waiting for him in his mail box.
“Don’t spiral, love. We’re going to get this all figured out. I promise. You fought so hard for me to reach my dreams, I’m going to do the same for you.”
“You are the one who brought me back into the music world. You… you revived me when I thought I was long gone.”
Eventually his stomach growled something fierce, indicating that he should probably do something about finding food for himself. He pulled out his phone and found the nearest restaurant that would deliver to the hotel. It was a Chinese restaurant. Within the hour Sherlock had eaten his dinner and wrapped himself up in the blankets on his bed, absolutely exhausted. He set his alarm for 7:30 the next morning and fell into an odd sleep.
Sherlock waited at the front of the school for John. They were going to go out to Speedy’s for some tea, then up to their infamous spot on the roof of Bart’s. Five minutes passed; then ten; then fifteen. Sherlock knew something was wrong. John was never this late.
how talented you are. They just need you to go out there and sit at that piano and play like you always do. They’re waiting for you to blow them away.”
“I didn’t do anything to you…” John said shyly. The next thing he knew, John was pinned against the lockers by his shirt collar. He tried desperately to squirm free from Jim’s grip, but it was no use. John knew what was coming and he braced himself for it.
“Thank you,” John said. “And…thank you for the opportunity to perform again. I forgot how incredible it felt walking off stage after a good performance.” John looked away, smiling slightly.
John’s phone buzzed in his hand as he was sending a fifth text. His heart fluttered as he read the words.
He didn’t know how to approach John and tell him that after he’d finally found the courage to confess his feelings, he’s decided that he is going to run away to America and never return. That would surely keep the relationship steady.
He immediately thought about Sherlock. He thought about his dark brown curls and his long trench coat and that blue scarf he always wore. He also thought about how smart he was, and how annoying he could be because he knew he was cleverer than almost anyone he’d ever meet. However, John mostly thought about how Sherlock acted when it was only he and John. Sure he liked to spin his tales of the multiple amounts of experiments he has done or how many times he had outsmarted his brother who was supposedly even smarter than the mighty Sherlock Holmes.
John nodded excitedly. “Oh, I got that too! Boy, it sure is going to look weird to have an M.D. entering an undergraduate program for music, isn’t it?”
John texted back his warmest thanks as Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, a towel draped lazily around his hips. John choked on his breath, willing himself to
John was barely able to suppress his chuckle as the blush creeped across Sherlock’s face. It was always so much easier for Sherlock to get John to blush, so he reveled in these small victories.
“He does seem different when I see him in theory… he seems completely out of focus, which is unusual for him.”
“I wanted to make sure you didn’t pull any drunken shenanigans, so I took you home with me.” Sherlock was impressed with how nonchalant he made himself sound with all of this.
They made it back to the hotel without much issue and Sherlock shook John awake. He leaned heavily on Sherlock again as they hobbled up to their hotel room. John immediately fell into the mattress and passed out. Sherlock couldn’t help the small chuckle that escaped him. He pulled the shoes off of John’s feet and cast them aside before removing his own shoes.
John pulled Sherlock closer to him. “I don’t ever want to have another day where I don’t wake up next to you. I... I don't think I could do that.”
Sherlock finally left John's house at about 8. His brother still hadn't made any attempt to contact him.
“Sherlock?” John asked softly, placing a gentle hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Love, what’s the matter?”
After a while, though, they fell silent and just laid there. A million thoughts began to run through Sherlock’s head. It was obvious what they were doing here, right? Laying in a park, star gazing? When did Sherlock become… a romantic? He wasn’t sure. But what he was sure of was that he had fallen so head-over-heels in love with the boy next to him that he couldn’t think straight. Sherlock sat up suddenly, trying to steady his spinning head. John stirred next to him; he must have been falling asleep.
Needless to say, their nightclothes had ended up strewn across the floor of the hotel, forgotten by the two men as they spent the night consumed by the embrace of the other.
John was met with incoherent crying on the other end. His heart sunk and he felt a lump in his throat.
Greg now looked very angry. "Well, maybe those "poor excuses for detectives" would be more willing to admit that if you and your brother weren't complete arseholes!" he shouted. Mycroft wanted to look taken aback; but if anything, he was
John chuckled. “I’m telling you, Sherl. Nobody needs cable anymore. All you need is your computer and Netflix, and you’re set for life.”
John eventually woke up. He rubbed his eyes as he slowly sat up. He scanned the dark room and was sure that he didn’t see Sherlock anywhere. He stood up and slowly made his way across the hotel room to the bathroom. He turned on the light to find it empty. His brow furrowed, and he turned back around and walked towards the bed. There was a note left on the table.
“That doesn’t mean she’s better. That just means she goes to the fancy music school. You could go there too, if you ever wanted to.”
Molly shrugged, feigning indifference, but her eyes were gentle. “I think I just felt that you were covering up a big soft sweetheart with that absolute arsehole act you’d been playing all those years.” She laughed as she looked over at John, who was lightly dozing where he sat on the sofa. “And I think John really helps bring out that side of you. Despite things that I may have done or said, I’ve always considered you my friend, Sherlock.”
Before he knew it, John’s audition was upon him. He waited nervously outside of the audition stage. He was pacing back and forth again, twiddling his thumbs.
Mycroft let out a sigh and he fell back against the wall. “You’ll thank me one day, brother mine. You will.”
“Love?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper, as though he’d startle John and send him running from the apartment.
As quickly as the kids gathered, some teachers had dispersed them and sent them on their way. Jim and his group walked away triumphantly, but once again the curly-haired did not do as they did. He helped John stand up, and handed him his crumpled up map that had been crushed in his hand.
But Sherlock was always full of surprises; he texted back almost immediately. As though he had been prepared for John to be so stubborn.
Damnit… what would his parents think if he dropped out of medical school? Especially now, when he was so close to being finished? No… he couldn’t. Not now. No matter how badly he wished he could. He couldn’t just give up becoming a doctor. It was too late. Molly was Sherlock’s rightful accompanist. But, that didn’t mean that they couldn’t spend time together otherwise. John couldn’t have everything he wanted, but he wasn’t going to let himself give up what little he could have. He could have Sherlock, and that would always be enough.
Sherlock relaxed into John’s embrace, closing his eyes and trying to even out his breathing again. In the calming silence, John’s attention was once again, unfortunately, drawn to the teasing sight of Sherlock’s hips, the towel just barely keeping everything of interest covered.
“This is our table, what are you doing here?” John picked up his food and the paper and quickly stood up.
Sherlock jolted awake. When he realized it was just John, he relaxed, throwing his arm over his eyes. “Good morning John.”
.” Sherlock emphasized. “Do you know why, John? Because you put everything you’ve got into that piano when you’re sat in front of it. I’ve never seen anything like it. And I know for damn sure those judges haven’t either, because they’re out there waiting for you to come back on stage and try again.”
sorry, and you have all the rights in the world to never forgive me what I did, but I at least want to tell you what happened."
Molly gritted her teeth as John examined the wrist. “I slipped on something backstage, perhaps a stray sheet of music. I fell forward and my right hand landed on the floor a little further back than where it needed to be to catch my fall. So…I more or less fell on it, and my wrist feels like it’s snapped right in two.”
“Well, we don’t all have tragic backstories and dead brothers to think about when we’re playing our instruments.”
“I cannot wait to see him crumble when he finds out that his precious Sherlock is addicted to drugs.”
John looked down at Sherlock, who’d closed his eyes as tears started trickling down his cheeks again. John gently combed his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
John fell back onto the bed and let out a frustrated groan. “I don’t know why I agreed to let you drag me into this, Sherlock. There’s no way I can do this… I’m just going to make a fool of myself.”
“It is for the best, Sherlock. You don’t need love getting in the way,” Mycroft said, handing Sherlock his phone. “You will thank me some day.”
John heard the deeper silence fall between them. It was a surprised silence, like when one discovers a plot twist in their favorite show on the telly.
Molly groaned and pinched the bridge of her nose. “Sherlock, these people make mistakes all the bloody time. That’s why you should contact the admissions office like it says to do on the damn letter.”
Sherlock pulled John towards him and gave him a soft kiss. “You will get there. We’re going to get you there. You’re so talented, John. You just have to let everything go, and dive into it with your whole heart. I’ve heard you play with your heart before, and it was absolutely breath taking. I know that you have it in you.”
want tonight to end, I need to get home or my parents will ground me for the rest of my life,” John said with a laugh. Sherlock entwined his fingers and joined John in his cab ride to his flat. When John got out Sherlock gently grabbed his hand and motioned for John to turn and face him.
Those immediately felt like the wrong words to say, but Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from blurting them out.
“Sherlock, Molly is on her way over and she’s on a mission, so you either get out of bed the easy way or the hard way.”
The end of the day didn’t come soon enough and eventually John was climbing into bed, his body wrecked from nerves and exhaustion. Unfortunately, this wasn’t enough to tempt sleep to overtake him. He fell in and out of consciousness and cursed the alarm that went off in the morning. He stood up and tried to rub the sleep out of his eyes the best he could.
moments to spend with the people they cared for most. But instead they walked on, neither of them daring to let the other see the silent tears trailing down their face.
“What’s wrong, Sherlock?” he asked, his voice full of sleep. John slowly sat up and Sherlock turned to face him. The moonlight sparkled in his eyes, and Sherlock thought he’d never seen someone so beautiful in his life. Sherlock gently brought up his hand to cup John’s face. He heard John make a small gasping sound, but he didn’t make a motion to pull away.
John rested his chin on his fist and he kept his eyes on Sherlock as his gaze trailed off into the sky and began to speak.
“I see it all the time, John. You form incredibly special connections to people through music. There’s nothing else like it.”
Certainly it wasn’t this Sherlock character. With his stupid curly hair, and his mysterious air. How he’d come off as a complete prick, and somehow pulled a complete reversal on his image when he and John practiced together the first time. How absolutely wonderful it was to watch him get lost in his instrument. How John had loved watching him bounce about excitedly afterwards.
London was 5 hours ahead this time of year, Sherlock believed. That was one thing he would have to get used to. Time changes. What a stupid idea. Bloody Americans.
Mike shrugged. “Who cares? If it’s your dream, there’s no time limit or degree requirements, right?”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s waist and melted into the embrace. He moved so his chin rested against John’s chest. “Will you let me take care of you too, John?”
“Oh, good heavens John…” Mike exclaimed, yanking him back towards him. “My apologies, Mr. Holmes. He’s had a few too many this evening.”
And John was easily one of the most talented pianists he’s ever met, so he was bound to have one of these spectacular runs any moment. Truthfully speaking, it seemed the only thing that was keeping John from Julliard at this point was himself. His nerves were getting the best of him, and it seemed to be getting worse with each passing practice.
John felt his cheeks flush again, looking away from him. “You’ve made your point. Shall we get started?”
that would get John back on that stage. “You know that isn’t true. You bleed and sweat natural talent, John. You’re holding yourself back from your own destiny.”
Sherlock beamed with pride as he turned away from the judges and looked into John’s eyes. They were full of fear, excitement, adrenaline, happiness, misbelief.
The next morning, Sherlock was up and dressed and headed for the subway in record time. He arrived at Julliard around 8:15 and made his way inside. It was a truly remarkable building, and he’d be lying if he said it didn’t immediately take his breath away. His nonchalant charade was up as soon as he walked in that door. He felt the child in him immediately start jumping with joy. He had been accepted to audition for the graduate program. The school of his dreams. He could hardly wait. It had been so long since he’d felt this longingness in him.
One, two, three blows to John’s head came. After that, he was thrown to the floor and kicked once in the stomach. John curled up into a ball trying not to show the pain. He opened his eyes slightly to make sure Jim was far enough away that he could stand up without being pushed down again. He opened them just in time to see Jim slip through a puddle on the hall floor. He fell down on his back and it was as if the whole building shook. Once again, an eruption of laughter rang through the halls. Jim’s face turned bright red as he stood up.
John nodded, and they were off, practicing for at least 2 more hours that day. Eventually it was Sherlock who insisted that if they practiced anymore they were going to hurt themselves, and John reluctantly stood from the piano and let Sherlock drag him home.
Sherlock turned away from John as he stood up and gathered his sheet music together. They walked out together, John allowing Sherlock to lead, seeing as he was the star of the show after all.
John blushed as he squeezed Sherlock just a little bit tighter. “None of this would even be happening if it wasn’t for you.”
Sherlock shook his head as he reached out and grabbed John’s hands. “I always doubted myself. My brother Mycroft was a violinist too, and he was leagues better than me. We had started playing around the same time, but he just picked everything up so quickly. I always felt like I was in the shadow of everyone who was better than me, and I was always afraid of their criticisms. So, when I played, that’s what I sounded like. Talented, but afraid of letting go.”
But he knew that he had to do this. He had to tell John what he was planning to do, no matter how badly it hurt. So, he sent a text.
Before John had grasped exactly what was going on, the night of the recital arrived. John stood backstage in his suit that somehow still fit, his hands sweating and his heart pounding. Sherlock approached him, his usual essence of superiority absent, replaced with sympathy. It was so strange to see him acting so kind towards him. I guess the git had a soft spot for people who were nervous about performing.
John punctuated his next remark with a whip of his clothes, attempting to get the wrinkles out. “Because it isn’t well enough to be left alone. Now stop complaining and get up and put some clothes on. If we can’t shower the sex off, the least we can do is make it look like we did.”
The rehearsal passed in the same uncomfortable silence. John knew there was something wrong, but he and Sherlock were certainly not on the level where he would tell him anything.
John put the phone down again and slumped into his chair, staring at the wall as he waited for Sherlock to text back. He suddenly wasn’t as tired as he had been before. He was getting more and more anxious. Of course the gorgeous stranger had to text him ‘hey, I have a question’ when it was nearly midnight! On a Sunday night, nonetheless. Damn… either Sherlock was writing him a novel, or he’d gotten preoccupied. Knowing what little John knew about the git, it was most likely the former.
John stared at the ground, silent. Sherlock held John's arms in his hands, his breathing a bit shallow.
“Not at all,” he said. "There are no visible marks where the shoes would most likely need repairs." Sherlock tossed the shoe back at Mycroft. "Even the most talented repairmen could fix a shoe leaving it perfect. This shoe hasn’t been repaired once."
“What’s wrong? I haven’t been to forward, have I? If so, I do apologize,” Sherlock said. He continued to ramble to himself for a few seconds until John hushed him.
John was silent as he listened to Sherlock explaining how auditions would work. He kept shaking his head in disbelief. “There’s no way, Sherlock. I… I can’t! I can’t.”
I get in, then… well, I’d have to move. To the United States. And, I’m not entirely sure how many years I would be gone.”
“I was going to tell you that I loved you as well, John… but Mycroft got a hold of my better judgment and manipulated it.”
“Not if we are going out, you can’t. Come on, up you get,” he said, pulling the covers off of Sherlock as he stood up. “Molly is gonna be here at 5.”
“Okay, John. You want to know why, so I am going to tell you. So get comfortable, this is going to take a minute. And please don’t interrupt at any point, it will make this go even slower.”
“I have been, but I figured since we have spent a healthy amount of time together, I can get myself focused the way I normally do. I guess it gets me super focused.”
Sherlock tiredly shook his head where he laid on John’s lap. “I’m not quite interested in hearing all the terrible things they have to say about me or my audition, John.”
Sherlock managed to type “I lov” before Mycroft ripped the phone back from him. He typed furiously and sent the message before throwing the phone back at Sherlock.
“I just can’t promise that Sherlock, because if I promise that it just makes it that much harder to not think about it.”
I'M SOBBING!!! So many fic authors I follow on twitter are printing out their fics and like, I wanna do that to??? Y'all have no idea how badly I'd love to hOLD THIS IN MY HANDS or put it on my bookshelf or something. It might not be much, but it is my baby and I'll love it forever.
“Oh, for God’s sake, John,” Sherlock mumbled, sitting up and burying his face in his hands. “Why can’t you just leave well enough alone?”
John was the first to wake up the next morning, stretching until his spine popped. Sherlock groaned next to him, stirring himself.
John nodded, still trying to catch his breath. Sherlock leaned down and kissed against his neck, alternating between kissing and biting and sucking. It had been a while since they’d gotten to be this intimate together, and Sherlock needed it now more than ever.
Without taking so much as a breath, Sherlock pulled John into his arms and locked him in a breath-taking kiss. John immediately melted into it, his whole being aglow with happiness. He looked up at his husband. His snobby, smart-arse of a husband.
Sherlock looked into John’s eyes, trying so hard to repress the tears that so desperately wanted to fall. Why was John so willing to let go of his happiness for everyone around him? It was going to eat Sherlock alive.
Those thoughts were becoming more and more intrusive as time continued to pass without any word from Juilliard about John’s admission status. John shook his head as he struck a sour chord, pulling Sherlock out of his own muse while they were practicing together. Sherlock turned on his heel, but John wasn’t met with pompous annoyance like the old Sherlock would have provided. Instead his face was filled with sincere concern as he immediately rushed to John’s aid.
“I’m telling you, Sherlock. One day you are going to meet a man that refuses to worship the ground you walk on. And you’re going to go absolutely mad for him.”
“God, you sure are thick for someone that was smart enough to get into medical school,” Molly said, giggling. “Love doesn’t have a time limit John. Plus… you two play music together. That’s only the most romantic language two people can speak! No words, just the music flowing through the both of them. It transfers endless thoughts and emotions through the two of you and before you know it, all you can think about is how you feel when you are playing together!”
“At this point I’ve just… I’ve accepted my fate. I just need to see it written down in front of me is all.”
The entire performance was nothing but adrenaline and sweat and flying fingers for its entirety. John stood up once again and bowed, the thunderous applause faint under the pounding of his heart. He walked off the stage and stood for a moment, the applause not dying down for a moment. He turned around and walked back on stage, bouncing in his step as he motioned for the orchestra to stand behind him as took several more bows.
Sherlock smiled and lightly kissed John’s forehead. He then quickly pulled John up and kissed his lips. “I bloody love you, John Watson.”
Sherlock was fidgeting nervously, still mulling over what exactly to say to John. By the time John had arrived, he had only spiraled deeper into the anxiety. He had no clue what to say. Not a single damn clue. Before now, everything was theoretical. But now he had to face John. He had to tell him that this was it. This was the end. Everything that they had built together was going to come crumbling down, and he hated himself for getting so bloody attached. But he couldn’t help it… he wanted to be attached. Why couldn’t things ever be easy?
Sherlock arrived at the school and ran straight for the men’s changing rooms. “Damn,” he mumbled, jiggling the door knob. “The bloody door is locked.”
“If your audition is good enough, they will offer you a full scholarship to attend their school, John.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, prepared to offer some more words of comfort, but they were both jolted out of their prior thoughts by the stage director.
“Sherlock Holmes, cut the garbage. You know for a fact you played as well as you always do, and I’m 110% certain that you were already accepted before they asked you to come play. The audition was just a formality,” Molly snapped.
It took them a few minutes to make their way to the hospital. For some reason that John was not really interested in, he knew people there, and they got inside without a problem. Once at the top, they found a place to sit, and they sat facing each other. John looked down at his hand and twiddled his thumbs as Sherlock continued to look at him.
John leaned down and met Sherlock’s lips in a deep kiss, whispering an affectionate “idiot” against his partner’s lips. “Have you already forgotten what I told you earlier?”
. How had he gotten here? It was all a blur. It was all thanks to that smarmy prick of his. His fiancé. Sherlock Holmes. The ethereal violinist that had set his heart ablaze.
John groaned, moving to stand up so he could take the call outside. He didn’t want to actually wake Sherlock up. The poor man needed as much sleep as he could get.
John thanked her with a nod and a smile before she turned to walk on stage. She was met with thunderous applause as she bowed before turning to tune the orchestra. The conductor soon followed, more applause filling the theatre to the brim.
John looked up to see the judges talking amongst themselves and giving him confused looks. The same judge who had spoken earlier spoke again. “Why don’t you take a deep breath and try again, Mr. Watson.”
Molly and Mike both scoffed at him, insisting that he was being way to hard on himself. John simply shrugged.
"That's my name," replied Greg, cheerfully. Mycroft looked down at the paper. He was more than certain that he had heard his name before.
John almost let the phone drop out of his hands. He looked at the message for a good five minutes before he took it into realization.
John arrived a bit earlier than usual for their next rehearsal. He had found some old sheet music in his flat and wanted to spend a few moments on his own with the piano. It was quite a beautiful instrument. It had a sleek finish, and a gorgeous white color. John had only ever played a piano such as this in his dreams. He double checked to make sure he didn’t hear any footsteps coming down the hall, and then he sat down and began to play.
Molly couldn’t help her laugh. “He’s usually pretty sweet during rehearsals; he tends to rub people the wrong way when he first meets them, but he isn’t the pompous fool you think he is. He is most certainly one of the most accommodating soloists I’ve ever worked with. I wouldn’t want to play with anyone else.”
“Well perhaps he just has a very talented shoe repairman who specializes in everything but the soles of shoes."
John walked on legs that felt like jelly. He wasn’t even sure how they were carrying him at this point. He followed the man who’d called his name to the stage entrance. He went from the bright fluorescence of the hall to the ultra-violet lit backstage. He could see the piano placed on the stage. At some point the man in front of him stopped and turned to him. John stopped as well until the man ushered him forwards.
“John, I love you.” Sherlock said urgently. John smiled and planted a gentle kiss on Sherlock’s lips.
“Oh, any time John! I know life with your parents can get to be a bit much. I’m always here for you.”
John didn’t look convinced. “Perhaps not. Or perhaps Molly is the only one there who isn’t an uptight arse.”
With a curt nod, John turned and left to join Mike and Molly in the lobby. They immediately bombarded him, leaving him no time to think about the exchange he and Sherlock had just had.
Sherlock closed the lid of the piano gently and placed his violin on top of it before running out of the room. Where on Earth was he going in such a hurry?
“No… no, you’re right,” Sherlock said, his voice quivering. “You aren’t going to be able to learn to let go the way I did. We are in completely different circumstances. I’m sorry.”
John stopped in his tracks for a moment… how had the muggers not ran before the police got there? Mrs. Hudson was the only one there. Maybe she was secretly one of those badass old ladies or something. Anyway…
John coughed and tried desperately to get himself up. Instead he just flopped back onto the ground, staring up at Jim.
“Nothing wrong with that,” Sherlock defended. “And please stop calling me Sherly, even someone as dull as you could deduce that I am not a female.”
Deciding that John could use a break from all of the arguments going on in his home, he invited John to spend the weekend with him at his house; it wasn’t as if his house was perfect, but his parents strongly enforced the idea of ‘hospitality.’ John could use some time in a more stress-free environment. John happily agreed and was able to talk his parents into letting him do so; he walked home with Sherlock after school that afternoon.
“He… he called me captivating again. And, oh God, the way he looked at me… Molly, what the hell is going on?”
It was a little after 11 and Sherlock had settled into bed already. John stood idly in the bathroom with the toothbrush dangling haphazardly out of his mouth. He was sending a lengthy text to his chat with Mike and Molly, explaining everything that happened.
One meal and four more hours of internet browsing later, Molly and John had finally found a handful of e-mail addresses to contact, including the general support e-mail for the admissions office that was included in the decision letter. With Sherlock’s reluctant assistance, they drafted a message with just enough snark to sound like Sherlock and not his two friends drafting a message for him, but lacking the pompous air that would likely get him nothing more than a scoff before the recipient would hit the discard button. With messages sent, Molly closed her laptop and took a deep breath.
They say that sometimes seconds can feel like hours. Minutes can feel like days. 2 hours will pass but the clock says it’s only been five minutes.
After pulling away from the embrace, even though he desperately wanted to stay, Sherlock made the two of them a small breakfast. He suggested that they spend the day at John’s flat instead of his own, for both the purpose of a change of scenery, and for the hopes that the letter was
As soon as Sherlock saw John he ran up to him and pulled him into a tight hug. John, surprised, tightened his arms around him.
, not the audience!” Sherlock exclaimed, spinning about the room. “That’s the key, John. You just need to get lost in your music. Let everything go. Just close your eyes and let the piano do the playing for you! If you play like that at your audition, I guarantee you’ll get the biggest scholarship they have to offer.”
After what felt like eons, he heard John take a shaky breath. “You… you said the Royal Academy would take me…”
He then found himself thinking that he didn’t want to say no… he had fallen hard for the piano, and even harder for the tall violinist with bright blue eyes and curly brown locks of hair. Damn… what the hell was happening to him? Where had his passion for medicine gone? All he ever wanted to do was help people.
But there was a small voice nagging at him. He was choosing Julliard over John, how could he do this?
"The only one ruining me is you, don't you understand?! Whenever when I am with John I'm happy. Whenever I'm with you, I'm not!"
Sherlock shook his head. “Molly, you’ve been here for almost 10 hours doing nothing but… this. Why are you trying so hard to help me? I’ve not always been that kind to you.”
The thought drove him deeper into his spiral. With a quick intake of breath, John threw off the covers and got out of bed. He drove a hand threw his hair as he left the room, closing the door gently behind him. He paced through the living room, trying to will his mind to stop.
“This is obvious,” Sherlock replied, with the smallest hint of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Gone out to celebrate a job well done, have we?”
John told Sherlock all about his youth and how all of his friends had left him. He also told Sherlock about how his parents argued almost every night and how they never really paid attention to him and how the majority of the past 2 or 3 years of his life he has been completely alone. By the time John was done Sherlock actually had faint tears forming in his eyes.
“I suppose I’ll have to keep this in mind for future endeavors?” he teased, causing the blush in Sherlock’s cheeks to refresh as they stepped out of the flat and climbed into Molly’s car.
Within minutes, he heard John playing the piece they’d just been filming… absolutely perfectly. Sherlock mentally patted himself on the back. He never mentioned to John that he left the camera recording at all times. His eyes flipped to the camera, and the blinking red dot assured him that it was in fact still recording. As quietly as he could, Sherlock moved to stand in the doorway, beaming with pride as he watched John play. Before he knew it, John reached the end of the piece, and from what he could tell, he hadn’t made a single mistake. Sherlock walked back into the room, empty handed with a giant smirk on his face. John immediately gave him a raised eye brow.
Mike and John were working on an assignment when Molly rang. Mike picked up his phone and answered it.
Molly gave John an annoyed stare. “You think an American college is going to spend any more money than they have to on something like admissions letters?”
. You never know when you are going to get snuffed out. So, you can’t live with regrets, and you can’t hesitate. So, I stopped hesitating. I play each performance as though it is going to be my last. Because if it is my last, I don’t want it to be a performance that I will regret giving. I don’t want any performance to be less than my absolute best that I am capable of doing at the time. I always let go and just fall into the music. Because music is my beginning and my end, and I always want to remember it as such. Not something that I could have been, but something that I
John blushed, but before he could respond his phone began to ring.  He picked it up and answered it. A brief “all right, we will be right down,” told Sherlock that Molly had arrived, and it was time for them to leave for dinner. John offered Sherlock his hand and he took it, still blushing from their encounter. John couldn’t help but laugh at Sherlock’s absolute inability to handle a man in a suit.
John shoved Sherlock up into a sitting position and pulled him around so that he was facing him, eyes directly level with his own.
Sherlock slowly got the suit on that John had picked out for him. When he decided that he looked presentable, he nodded at his reflection in the mirror and made his way into the sitting room. John had magically reappeared, and he was wearing one of the most handsome suits Sherlock had ever laid eyes on. It was a deep red suit, and as much as the color popped, it really did wonders for John’s appearance.
Without thinking, John hoisted himself out of his seat and found a new one in the seat of Sherlock’s lap. The brunet looked up at him, his face colored completely with a shocked blush.
John pulled Sherlock into his chest before he could mutter any more protests, curling his fingers through his wavy, brown locks. “Let me take care of you, Sherlock. Please?”
“John… I think, no… I know. You’re one of the greatest things to ever happen to me, and… you make me feel alive in so many ways I’m unfamiliar with. You bring out the best of me that I didn’t know I had, and, John… I-I’m in love with you.” Sherlock let out a shaking breath. “I’m so in love with you.”
SO HAPPY FOR JOHN, MY SWEET LAD! As much anxiety as I've experienced over auditions and results and stuff, it was literally so hard to put into words and i don't even know if I did a good job so LET ME KNOW WHAT U THINK and thank u for sticking with me and my really bad uploading schedule. <3 I appreciate all u guys.
Sherlock received no response. He was sure Molly would be upset. They had been playing together for years. It couldn’t feel great to be replaced by someone Sherlock barely knew, but… what if this was the last time he and John would ever be able to spend together?
“Oi, what the hell is that supposed to mean?” John demanded. “Last I heard, you were impressed with me.”
John gasped, his heart officially cracked into two or three pieces. “I’m getting a cab to Baker Street now. I’ll be there in a few minutes.”
John couldn’t tell how long it had been, but eventually his tears subsided, and he fell asleep in Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock let out a deep sigh that he’d been holding for who knows how long as he relaxed into the couch. Sleep eventually came over him as well, and they managed to sleep through the rest of the night.
The cab took off and within minutes the cab pulled up in front of Speedy’s where Sherlock was waiting. Sherlock paid the cab driver and then they walked into Speedy’s together.
“Who is texting you so much, Sherlock?” Mycroft asked. Sherlock quickly shoved the phone into his pocket.
“Oh, I don’t hang out with them, as you put it. I’m merely in the background; blending in, as some people like to call it. They do talk to me and act like I am a part of them but in reality they’re all too stupid to realize I’m just using them.”
John felt the uneasy silence on the other end of the line. He let out a sigh and walked over to the sofa and gently sat down.
John remained silent until his cab arrived. He was certain he was as red as a tomato the entire time, and every time he caught Sherlock’s gaze he was
“There’s no way that this is correct, Sherlock. You’re bloody phenomenal… I think you should call admissions.”
Sherlock relented and was now taking a warm bath upon John’s request while John made the two of them some tea and biscuits. He’d sent Mike a text telling him that he probably wouldn’t be returning home tonight, because he didn’t want to leave Sherlock on his own after everything that’d happened that day. Mike quickly responded asking about what was going on, as John had left him and Molly completely in the dark as he ran off to hail a cab to Baker Street. He told them that Sherlock had gotten bad news from Julliard, but he didn’t want to go too into detail because he wanted it to be Sherlock’s story to tell. Nonetheless, his friends knew what that meant, and they offered their well wishes for their friend.
Sherlock slowly blinked his eyes open to see John ruffling through the suits hanging up in Sherlock’s closet.
He’d… he had never had an audition go so well. Of course, within moments he was spiraling. What if he’d screeched here and there? What if his vibrato was too intense because he was shaking? He hadn’t even looked at the judges faces to tell what they were thinking. He was just ready to be done and off of that stage. He knew he played well, but… was it his best? Surely not.
Yay for Sherlock!!! :"D I feel so bad for putting him through all that but let's be honest,,, he wasn't not getting into Juilliard. that's just silly
“Such wonderful terms of endearment, my love,” Sherlock joked. John let out a chuckle before pulling Sherlock back into another kiss. Afterwards the two laid back down, John snuggling up to Sherlock’s side. They laid there for hours watching the stars, holding hands, and being so in love.
Sherlock pulled out from the hug a bit and cupped John’s face very lightly before pulling him in for another kiss.
“I love you,” he muttered softly. John carded his fingers through his soft hair, unable to hold back the smile that formed on his lips.
When Sherlock still refused to move from where he sat on the bed, John waltzed over to Sherlock’s closet and removed the first shirt he found and whipped it over to him, slapping him directly in the face. Sherlock’s muffled protests were thwarted by a pair of pants quickly following the shirt.
John leaned up and kissed Sherlock on his forehead. “We’ll always find a way back to each other Sherlock. You can’t give up Julliard if I don’t make it. Please, promise me. Promise me this.”
Sherlock gestured to the tripod and smiled bigger. “I just got you your ticket to the live audition, sweetheart.”
Sherlock smiled at John. “But if we’re being honest, I think they already had your acceptance confirmation in hand before you ever walked out on stage.”
The Doctor of Musical Arts program was almost as though it had been tailored to Sherlock’s very own interests. The more he read about the program the more he was convinced that it was what he needed. It would take him one step closer to being the very best musician he could be. Eventually he found himself browsing piano courses and performance opportunities.
“Oh Sherlock,” Mycroft said. “Do be careful. It would be a shame if someone were to tell little John about your…
“He is not dull. You are just an ignorant git. All you have is knowledge and at this rate that is all you will ever have, and even that isn’t much.”
The next morning John woke with a groan, stretching his neck. Sun was speckling the floors in the kitchen, so it wasn’t too awfully late in the morning.
John looked at Sherlock, that familiar spark slowly coming back to his eyes. He smiled at Sherlock. "I say we just pick up where we left off, huh?"
want to hear it, we all know you played perfectly. But if that wasn’t enough for the judges, then going through some sort of effort to contact an actual person instead of the admissions office support address is going to show them that you are incredibly passionate about what you want. Passionate persistence is such an underrated tactic.”
"God damnit, Sherlock, just go! Stop being so bloody stubborn, God knows why John puts up with you…"
The rest of that day passed in a blur, and the next thing Sherlock knew, he was walking on stage, palms sweating. He turned to face the four judges that sat in front of him, pencils and paper on the table in front of them. They were murmuring softly to each other as Sherlock mentally prepared himself.
“I won’t have that talk, Watson,” Sherlock growled into his lips. John shivered at the tone and pulled back, blushing furiously.
Sherlock shook his head ferociously as he began serving dinner. “Trust me, they make minimal judgements based on those kinds of criteria. Everyone gets nervous at auditions. But the fact that you were able to shake nerves of that intensity and play as phenomenally as you did is what they’re going to remember.”
In a few moments he returned with an electric tea kettle, two mugs, and a bag full of different kinds of tea.
Jim opened up the note and read it. Mycroft knew everything could be considered taken care of when a smirk spread across Jim’s face.
And now here they were in the United States. Sherlock let his head fall back against the seat and he closed his eyes. He hadn’t gotten much sleep within the past few days, and he was in desperate need. He was going to have to get used to flying, because he knew that Molly would be demanding he come visit at least once a week once he started his courses at Julliard.
“We’ll know soon enough. I auditioned so late in the season, decision letters are going to be sent out within the month. Sherlock will have his even sooner than mine.”
“Sobbing?” John asked, eyes flooded with disbelief. “I… I don’t remember. I don’t remember any of that.”
“He’s turning you into a bloody fool, Sherlock! People like us shouldn’t even be forced to breathe the same
“I have to get myself in the zone before I do a rehearsal, or I won’t be able to focus,” Sherlock said plainly, as though it was the most sensible thing in the world.
Sherlock let the knowledge that his lover was finally finding some peace amongst the inner turmoil of all the changes in his life allowed him to find some sleep after all.
“I’m so proud of you,” he whispered softly, voice tired. John hummed in content as the two drifted off into peaceful sleep.
“what does it look like?” Sherlock asked, gesturing towards the sky. John only gave him a confused look. Sherlock huffed in frustration and grabbed John’s shoulder, pulling him so he was laying down on the table next to him.
Sherlock Holmes was one of the biggest mysteries. Each day with him was full of so many unknowns, and John had fallen so deeply in love with that. Each day brought new adventures for them to share and couldn’t wait for the day that he could start introducing him to the world as his husband.
Eventually, Sherlock let the letter fall from his hands. He pulled out his phone and pressed the call button under John’s contact. He didn’t have the proper motor function at the moment to send a text.
“Gah, what the hell was I thinking?” he said, beginning to absentmindedly pace about the room. “The last
“John! John this is it!” Sherlock nearly shrieked. He practically threw the envelope in John’s direction. John held the envelope in his hand, staring at it with disbelief. The two of them remained silent as John took several deep breaths, praying that his heart beat would slow just a little bit. Just enough for his entire body to stop shaking where he stood. Just enough to give him some control over his hands so he could actually get the damn thing open.
“I’m implying that you aren’t what Sherlock was expecting, and he doesn’t know how to handle you. He’s
Sherlock pouted and looked away from John’s teasing eyes. John leaned forward and planted a gentle kiss on Sherlock’s temple, and the tension in Sherlock’s shoulders immediately relaxed.
“You feeling better this morning?” he asked, voice groggy from sleep. John sighed, shaking his head less in a response to the question and more in response to his boyfriend’s antics. “Yeah,” he muttered softly. “I’d feel even better if you didn’t ruin your neck just because I had a rough night.” John stood and walked around to the back of the sofa, offering Sherlock a massage in return for the one he was given at rehearsal yesterday. “Does it hurt too bad? I can run to the store and get some biofreeze or something.”
Sherlock and Greg Lestrade had kept in contact after their initial meeting on the plane. In fact, they became fast friends. Greg was a truly talented oboist, but he didn’t have much of a stage presence. But with a little help from Sherlock in those days before his audition, Greg was able to absolutely wow the judges and earn a hefty scholarship for himself. He also learned from Greg that the application period for undergraduate students is longer than it is for graduate, mostly because of the fact that they have students auditioning from all over the world and their schedules tend to be much less flexible. So, John still had about a month to submit his application and get some repertoire together.
Before John could play more than a few measures, he got a call from Mike. Bart’s was a lot closer than he’d thought; they were fast on their feet too this evening.
the same. There’s no way that that bloody uptight, full-of-himself violinist that I met all those years ago breathed and lived through his violin for
Before John could protest Sherlock pulled him in for another kiss. When they broke away, John looked at Sherlock with sad eyes. “Sherlock. You can’t be serious.”
Dinner passed on with lots of laughter, some tears, and several handfuls of ‘I’ll miss you’s. John and Mike’s graduation ceremony dragged on for what felt like hours, but eventually they walked out to hugs and congratulations from all their friends and family, diplomas in hand. Summer slipped away through their fingertips. Before they knew it, boxes were being shipped to their apartment in New York. Mike had taken up a job teaching at Bart’s. Molly was playing shows at the West End. Everyone’s dreams had come true, but it was still sad. Because dreams coming true meant that it was time to get pulled away from their closest friends.
“Molly was really upset about you wanting to ask me to be your permanent accompanist, Sherlock…” John started cautiously. He was certain Sherlock would know that he knew, seeing as Molly was one of his best friends. “As much as I would love to continue playing with you, it isn’t fair to Molly. I really think you should take her back. She really is quite a wonderful player.”
With that, John stood up. “Sorry love, I’ve got a paper due this week. I’ve got to head home. I’ll see you later?”
This time he pulled Sherlock and kissed him with an urgency Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d ever felt before.
Ah, they've lived through all the stress of auditioning again. Now maybe things can get back to normal?
But even a day’s worth of peace would be more than enough. Sherlock just wanted to see John’s eyes bright and happy beyond the piano keys.
