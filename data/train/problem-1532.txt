Obviously the other man had left, his hooks on the coat and hat rack vacant. The note had settled him somewhat, but he required a physical presence to make any logical conclusion and had been standing at the window, waiting, draped in nighshirt and dressing gown,  ever since reading it.
On that note the Holmes's rejoined conversation in English, none the wiser that John had understood every word they had spoken. It was late evening by the time they were going home, ending the day on a high note with Mrs Hudson barrelling into Mummy and demanding that this time round she stay in touch or she'd be after her, they had a lot of work to do in the coming months and she was not taking no for an answer. After careful assurance that she wouldn't dare lose contact again, Orabelle returned inside, watching the vibrant tail lights of the car disappear into the trees, taking the last of the day's light with it.
It was skilled and beautiful work if nothing else, the outward beauty of the coffin attempting to detract from the horror of a mangled excuse for a man inside. Sleek edges and smooth faces of dark wood, etched with a careful hand to read prayers and verses, it was the work of a master. A pity then, that the only coffin master in their town was inside the thing, and therefore couldn't have made this one.
It arrived almost five days later, a wooden crate that looked, as per request, deceptively like it contained a live animal. That was why, when he signed for the package, John didn't dare open it, fearing whatever venomous creature would lie inside. That was exactly what Sherlock had hoped would happen because if he had have opened it, well firstly a dead cobra would have met him, but beneath that was a box and contained within that box were two items that Sherlock was very very pleased with. They were tailored to his exact specifications and he appreciated for once the power his brother had to do such things. When John left to do whatever it was he was doing, Sherlock opened the box. The black velvet box was cast to one side, he would inspect that in a minute. It was the other thing that he was interested in.
Sherlock had begun looking forward to sleep rather than resenting the fact that he had to succumb to it. In his dreams John spoke to him, asking him questions and simply telling him all manner of things. It was so vivid that sometimes Sherlock was not sure if he was asleep or awake. In his dreams John would profess his love for him over and over, never once asking for the words in return.
, I'm so sorry I was silent, surely you must have known how I loved you from the moment I was introduced?" Sherlock shook his head.
Carefully stacked away were lists of "Things I know but will never say" and Not-Him had gone through them, probably all, which meant that aside from knowing that at one stage Mycroft had wondered what it would be like if they'd seen each other naked, and that Molly had once told him that his face was one she often thought of during sex while he'd drugged her (for science!), or that Lestrade had, back in his youth, been a male stripper. No, worse than all of that combined, Not-Sherlock knew that John harboured a deep affection for Sherlock, and was going to do something about that. Probably (statistically speaking) something horrifically unpleasant and potentially friendship destroying. Definitely he'd ruin any hopes that Sherlock had for John to show his cards and allow them to enter an intimate relationship, and finally be together properly. The eels slithered to make their displeasure known and Sherlock carried on past that, waiting to see what Not-Him had done.
"How on earth did you know that?!" John had puzzled over it for a while but nothing about Greg had seemed different. "He smelled like Mycroft, it was all over him, meaning not only did he stay the night last night but he was having a rather interesting shower before the case interrupted them"Sherlock was very serious, but when John caught his eye they both laughed. The taxi pulled up outside Angelo's.
A few issues arose in Sherlock's mind as he contemplated the actual reality of marriage. The first was his lack of religion, John believed in a God of some sort, after all he had asked them to save his life in Afghanistan. He supposed that it wouldn't matter to him where they got married, even if that meant going to a church or if they ended up in a registry office. John probably wouldn't mind either, he was easy going about most things so this should not be any different. Of course this would mean meeting John's family which he did not look forward to in the slightest. The prospect of having to try and impress them was not exactly tantalizing. People didn't like him, he didn't like people and that was all fine. John's family however would eventually become his extended family and being on bad terms with them would not make John very happy (even if his own relationship with his family was strained). Probably best not to meet his grandparents either if they were still alive if their reaction to Harry was anything to go by. Not that their opinions would sway his decision to ask at the very least. Then again John might not want his family to meet Sherlock, in fairness he wasn't exactly the type of person you bring home to your parents. It seemed lucky now in hindsight that Mummy had made them stay with her for a weekend, at least that was out of the way, she completely approved and even liked John. There was no way he could keep this a secret from Mycroft, but he could be trusted to keep a secret, he was made of secrets after all. It would be better to tell him than to wait for his lackeys to say something, they had only really repaired their tenuous relationship recently and jeopardizing that was not the best idea.
Sherlock winced, the knuckles of his hand protesting, but he barely had time to contemplate his next move before Ricoletti was snarling, and there was a blur of movement all around, and he could feel something wrench into his side before being withdrawn, but it's all just transport, and so in the ensuing struggle, Ricoletti’s skull made contact with the railing in a satisfying crunch. He staggered backwards, clutching his head and swaying. For a brief moment Sherlock wondered if he was actually going to keep attacking but all at once Ricoletti was tilting over the railing in a daze, but not before he grabbed hold of the nearest possible support, promptly dragging Sherlock Holmes into the Thames along with him.
Then Mycroft saw it, the headstrong he had been looking for, but surprisingly he wasn't the only person there. John was sitting with his back against it, a bottle of whiskey in one hand and two blue orchids in the other. He looked up as he heard Mycroft approach and even though Mycroft was prepared for some form of violence none came. John was done. All the fight had gone out of him because with Sherlock exonerated he had no purpose left.
Sometimes, even after all the years they'd lived together in Sussex, John would wake up ready to rip through the streets of London on the tail of a vicious killer, wondering if Mrs Hudson would like to join them for lunch though her death had been the a major catalyst in their moving plans years earlier, and Sherlock often felt the same way. Not that they had retired completely, after all that would have been impossible for both of them but these days it really was more of a consulting position than an active participant in the crime scene shenanigans. Inside they would be young forever, but when your lungs begin to give out after a few miles of walking it tends to indicate that maybe retirement was the best way to go.
!" Clara babbled, planting kisses anywhere she could reach. "Harry I... First off I can't believe you didn't say anything and I should be furious with you right now but honestly I'm just glad you're ok. Secondly... Thank you. Thank you so much for what you've given us. I don't think I can ever tell you how much it means to me and to Sherlock too." Harry smiled weakly at John and patted his hand "Well I was never going to use them and I always saw you as a dad anyway, what better way to do that than to use my dna so you could biologically be related to the baby?" She didn't say that she wished she could have a chance to see them, or that she was sure she'd have loved the wedding. "I hope you're happy with him anyway. Sherlock that is. Without meeting him I'd not have gotten checked out" She didn't say that it made no difference, that she'd left it too long. She simply smiled a little sadly and enveloped John in her arms. "I love you Johnny, you know that right?" she whispers into his hair. "Never doubted it for a moment Harry. I love you too." When John pulled back Sherlock was already in the doorway and he beckoned him in though there were only two seats available.
John strolled over, maintaining enough distance between them that Holmes could keep his expression for himself, but close enough to be heard even if he spoke at a whisper. “Well, I think all those things of you, and I’m told, by you, often enough, that I should speak my mind, so I endeavor to do so. That is
"I'm just the blogger to him clearly. He could never need me as much as I need him Greg, and he knows it. I don't matter. I'm ok with it, honestly, Just caught me by surprise tonight is all." Greg's heart went out to his friend, Sherlock had him in a right mess and the poor sod probably didn't even realise it because he was a mess himself.
The elder Holmes seemed to be having trouble, his face pinched in a moue of distaste for his words, but John was only confused by them. What was this conversation supposed to help? John's worries about Sherlock's blatant lack of self restraint were only growing with every word. With a sigh, and an almost weary “until next time, Doctor Watson”, he was gone, and John was abruptly aware that with him went the most difficult patient he'd ever come across (right behind himself of course), the most interesting and intelligent person he was ever likely to meet, and also the first person he'd felt anything beyond base physical desire for since James.
John decided to return to his apartment early the next morning and, while he was at it, retrieved a couple of clean shirts to keep in the hospital. During the short walk back to the hospital, John gathered his thoughts.
John checked on the stitches to ensure they didn't rip during the seizure and requested for broad spectrum antibiotics as soon as Sherlock's vitals had picked up. A collective sigh of relief echoed throughout the trauma room. The nurses then bustled about cleaning up and preparing to wheel the patient into the intensive care unit, during John took a moment to lay his hand on Sherlock's clammy one and whispered a few words out of earshot.
"Oi." John nudged his arm conspiratorially and Sherlock turned to find their faces only breaths apart.
It's been quite a while since I posted, but you remember that I had a run in with an old acquaintance that was... Not exactly pleasant and since then we've not had any proper cases to write home about. There is, however, a rather good reason for my writing this that most of you will find unsurprising or at least I don't think you will be shocked. Surprise! I've been dating Sherlock for almost a year now, right after that Moriarty business we got together and in truth it feels as if we've always been this way, even though we haven't. A part of me was shocked that he even had those feelings, but I have it on good authority that it's just me (quite flattering that).
While he had hoped to come clean that night, it seemed as if that was an impossibility at this point. He was exhausted, having taken a beating from the charming man responsible for a double homicide and run a good twelve miles on no nourishment what so ever. But then again, John was there with him in the back of the ambulance, fussing as he always did. Sherlock had run straight into the man, colliding with him after sprinting through an alleyway as a shortcut, which, he made sure to mention, it was. He had fallen back and the perp had laid into him for only a minute before John had knocked him away with a harsh blow to the head. If Sherlock remembered correctly he may have blabbered to John that he was his hero... in front of would make for some very humiliating conversation later on.
Sherlock’s cock is lovely, shorter, and less thick than John’s own, it curves invitingly into his hand and stroking it feels like the most natural act he could possibly perform. He suddenly cannot fathom a world in which he did not get to be the one to bring Sherlock his pleasure, angry that something as insignificant as the law could ever mean this would be wrong, impossible. In every world, in every time that they could have lived, this, the two of them naked and tender and utterly enraptured, was inevitable.
One of the officers raised her hand timidly. "Yes constable?" Lestrade asked, feeling even more like a teacher than before. "I'm a bit lost" Sherlock snorted "What's going on? They're making plans or something and there's a party but John's in Afghanistan so that wouldn't make sense. Also why are there fingers in the vents?" she asked and Lestrade shrugged turning to Sherlock. "My God what must it be like in your little heads... John was getting leave and had no one to see, I offered myself up, my mother insists on celebrating my birth every year and I would be subjected to that unless I had a valid excuse not to go, an excuse which John provided. As for the fingers you wouldn't understand. Obviously." A collective "Ah" went around the group and Sherlock rolled his eyes to the sky.
THE PARAGRAPHS JUST NEVER APPEAR DAMMIT! You can get a more or less properly paragraphs version of this under the same title on Fanfiction.net
head up in society all these years would be a mystery if it weren't for Mycroft's standing." the old crone cooed "Just like his father in that way, such focus, such drive."
Sherlock frowned up at John from his place, draped across John's arms as he weaved his way through stacks of produce. "A fridge. Why on earth would he put us in an industrial fridge?"
That's not to say you had to marry your soulmate, because some people didn't. They didn't have the time to be looking for someone they may never find, wanted happiness now, and even if it wasn't the perfect happiness they were supposed to experience they just didn't care. John Watson was one of those people. At this stage he had pretty much given up any hope he had of finding perfection, he had decided to settle after he was shot and sent home. At least he would have somebody.
"What did we just witness?" Mycroft asked his assistant from the passenger seat as she typed a brief message to the prime minister. She couldn't help but grin at the discomfort in his voice. "I believe it was your brother's first kiss sir. Should I beep the horn or would you like a minute to stem your gagging?" They were there for a few minutes more before she was allowed to alert Sherlock to their presence, and the entire drive back to his apartment was a test of her professional ability to hold back laughter at the blatant disgust on Mycroft's face and the pure shock on Sherlock's. Maybe later she'd tell the boss that the man who'd seduced his brother was the same man who'd wrote the book on his bedside locker. Maybe.
“An army doctor actually Mummy, he was invalided out in Afghanistan.” Mycroft's voice chimed in brightly and Sherlock locked eyes with him, daring another word to come out of his mouth. Mycroft simply slipped his fork into his mouth, the picture of innocence, as Mummy's enthusiasm grew.
Sherlock was going to kill him. Slowly. With something he cared about. Cake, or that infernal umbrella of his. Mummy's smile grew astronomical in proportion, swallowing most of her face while next to her understanding seemed to dawn in Father's eyes.
Sherlock had all but collapsed on the spot and was out cold before John had finished speaking. It was at that point that John had opened the fridge and found the assortment of decaying fingers on a plate. He had gone to throw a blanket over Sherlock's gangly limbs and was muttering, asking if Sherlock did his experiments just to annoy him. And Sherlock had responded. "Not to annoy you... Don't want to... Get so bored... Do something wrong... Make you leave" John had been astounded and waved a hand in front of Sherlock's face but the man was truly out cold.
That changed pretty quickly when he had seen the nursery Sherlock and John had created out of John's old bedroom in 221. There was love in every inch of it, the care taken to include soft edges on even the dark wood rocking chair that was nestled into the corner of the room next to a cot that lay beneath a mobile of the solar system. The room had been repainted a dove grey, with a gallery wall of empty picture frames, and one filled with an ultrasound scan adorning it. Already, there were soft toy bees and molecules, a blanket knitted in Mrs Hudson's signature style, and even a tiny deerstalker hat. Even the rugs on the floor were made from what felt like clouds, but what sealed the deal for Greg had to be the well thumbed books that lay strewn around the sitting room of 221B; Parenting books of every description, analysed to within an inch of breaking their spines.  This baby was already more loved than most of the people on Earth, and there would be nothing that Sherlock wouldn't d to make sure that he and John both knew exactly what they were signing up for.
"Sometimes I wonder why we did this to ourselves" Greg quipped as he and John followed their partners blindly onto a plane that may or may not be headed for Venice Italy as opposed to the Spanish coast.
"These are...breathtaking. How did they do this, I mean, I saw them scribbling away but... look at that!" John held the page open for him to see and he had to admit it was a stunning piece, a watercolour drawing of their kiss on the altar, flower petals drifting down around them as John dipped him low, the expressions full of life and joy. "I would say there's at least one sonnet in there about that moment, try the next page." He quipped, and sure enough there was poetry on the back side, sitting next to a few close ups of the detail work in the drawing before it; their hands with the rings, their boutonnieres, their eyes.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as Irene made the performers reset the stage at first positions yet again, her obvious displeasure at their attempt to perform a simple enough number beginning to grate. Of course they wouldn't hold a patch on the performance of Electro City from the first night but they were all trying, something he was growing to appreciate more and more. The fact that their choreography was good and they hit their marks every time didn't hurt either, as producer he was pleased with his work, Irene was the one who had the issues.
He wondered if John would want to get married right away, or if they would have a long engagement. He never thought that any of this would cross his mind but there it was, completely unexpected, just like John. He peered at John over his laptop and smirked at his sleep rumpled demeanor and grinning toothily when he tried to sit at the table absent mindedly only to realise it wasn't there any more. John simply shook his head at his own stupidity and went to make tea instead. He would find however that there were no teabags left, he hadn't been shopping since his stint in the hospital and the cabinets and by extension John were being harshly affected by this emptiness. He heard the sigh and clatter of the press being closed that always signified John's hasty visit to the shops.
"Oi, freak. What are you doing here?" Sherlock sighed and gritted his teeth. "I'm doing your job, as I so often do." he replied coolly and smiled into the splutters of indignation that ensued. "We don't kill people freak, we're not psychopaths like you. You're a waste of space and if it were up to us you'd have been put away a long time ago. Just keep that in your weird brain, freak. You don't belong here, or anywhere else for that matter. You're nothing." John had made it right to the door of the room where Sherlock was supposed to be, just cracking it open as Sally went on her tirade. He watched as Sherlock's face fell and he held his hands together before replacing the indifferent mask everyone was used to. Sherlock was hurt and John, well he was enraged. He threw the door open and glared at Donovan and Anderson. "Right. I am only going to say this once so pay very close attention. You two work for people who have asked for Sherlock's help time and again, because everyone they've hired has been too incompetent to solve cases that need solving. Sherlock is here to help put criminals behind bars for you and to solve the puzzle for himself. Now. I don't particularly care what he's said to you because it's more than likely true. But what you say to him on a daily basis is unacceptable and from now on I refuse to accept it. If I so much as hear the word freak coming out of either of your mouths you will have a very angry, very capable, me to answer to. And believe me I would have no qualms in showing you exactly how capable I am. Once more. That's all it will take and I won't hold back. Do you understand?" John barked out, standing taller, using the voice he had reserved for the army.
John stared as those cat-like eyes scanned the room through the small window before focusing on his. Both sets of eyebrows raised in recognition, and just as John stood up and was about to head towards the door, he was stopped by a gentle hand on his elbow and pulled to face Mary.
Sherlock opens his eyes, unsurprised to find himself more well rested now on the morning of the wedding than the past few weeks of constant anxiety had allowed. He'd barely begun to shift himself into an upright position when Mummy walked in. "Oh good you're up, I was worried for a moment that you'd still be asleep and I just wouldn't have had the heart to wake you, even still, I remember when you were a little boy, no higher than my knee and you'd be bouncing about the house for days but when you finally crashed you'd sleep anywhere, but so soundly that I would just have to get someone to carry you inside rather than wake you. You were so beautiful, all our friends were constantly jealous of your curls and your eyes and I always thought they should have seen you sleeping to see just how lovely you really looked... look at me getting all sentimental! We have a lot to do and not long to do it, so into the shower with you!" Sherlock groaned internally. They were already starting with the drivel about his childhood, and it would only worsen as the day progressed. It was only thanks to Mrs Hudson that he'd been saved from Mummy having a speech at the reception. Perhaps he'd buy her a new kettle. Or John would. John... "Sherlock! Clean yourself or I'll do it for you, don't think I won't." Muttering obscenities under his breath he did as asked and trundled to the bathroom.
The first and most obvious place to look was the workshop this stranger had infiltrated, which would perhaps have been an issue for another man as common folk were not just allowed in like the breeze, but Sherlock had a contact within, an unorthodox undertaker he had helped get the job in the first place. Not many women were interested in the art of autopsy, but when one had shown up he'd prodded a few people to make room for her. Miss Hooper was an irregularity, and that made her interesting.
Well. Of all the ways to go, Sherlock didn't think he'd be doing so by drowning. Quite dull, if you asked him. At least an overdose would have been his own decision, and distinctly less full of rat urine and communicable diseases. Then again, what difference did that make to him now? He was dying, after all.
In his defence the beating had served a very important purpose in the case, but he could see why it wasn't the best plan he'd ever had now that he was bruised to bits and aching. John's belligerent yelling wasn't exactly helping his headache either, although there was some small satisfaction to be gained from listening to Mycroft get a dressing down.
red." John grin cheekily "The only words the great Sherlock Holmes could think of to describe my red boxers are oh and very red?" Sherlock stalked across the room to him and stroked one finger across the leg of them "
"This may sound a bit insane but if you two would like to dance I would happily take care of little Timothy for a few songs, I'm a doctor and everything so there's no need to worry" Anastasia's eyes lit up at the opportunity and Edward grinned, holding out his hand. "You have a heart of gold John, thank you so much" And Edward whisked her off to twirling about on the dancefloor.
"Merci pour l'aide monsieur!" John called as a bored Sherlock dragged him away at speed, launching himself at the black Land Rover that awaited them across the car park and throwing himself giddily into the driver's seat. John shook his head with a smile and climbed in next to him, barely shutting the door before they were driving off out of the town and into the countryside. The drive was peaceful and warmly quiet, with Sherlock occasionally pointing out various places he had been to before or vinyards and the different methods they used to give their distinct flavours to the wines they made.
live a normal life, no matter how much it pained me I would do it, after Reichenbach I deserved to be alone and you deserved to be happy with your wife but I managed to destroy that too! I am so sorry John, for the moment we met and every moment after that because I have made your life a misery more often than not, two years of pretending to be dead and what I have learned is exactly how much it hurts to lose someone you love and I knew you were alive, I'm babbling I know but that's what the nightmares are about, all the possible ways I could lose you through my own failures and-"
Angelo's was surprisingly empty. Though the dinner rush had yet to begin it was still unusually deserted. John eyed Sherlock who looked away innocently; he must have planned it this way. John's stomach fluttered at the effort Sherlock had made to ensure his comfort. Underneath the cold exterior Sherlock was more thoughtful than the majority of the population. The majority of the population wouldn't have slipped their coat around my shoulders during a particularly cold crime scene even though it was snowing and they were cold too. They sat down at the table by the window, the same one they had sat at on that first case together. It had become their booth.
"JOHN AND SHERLOCK, THIS IS FOR YOU." No one paid them much mind, weird things happened in camp every day but when he tensed John's hand found it's way discreetly to Sherlock's back, a life line against anything the two might say. For someone as self assured as he was, Sherlock was incredibly sensitive to homophobia, and while being tossed into the firing line at dinner had not been part of their plans, hearing it from people that were meant to be their friends would be even worse. Mike and Greg strode across the room with a box and Sherlock's bags in hand, and John's heart clenched at the flash of fear in his eyes when they reached their table.
Two days. That was the extent of time in which Not-Sherlock had stewed in their bedroom, brooding constantly over plans that were without fail obscured from Sherlock's view in the palace. The dungeon he'd erected at the age of six at the behest of his father were at least above ground level. It had still been soul crushingly dull, very much the epitome of his biggest fear at the time - that being confinement in a mental institution- the soft white walls and otherwise barren room were a torture, but only knowing what Not-Him had done after the events were long over was even more so. Sherlock shook his head and refocused, stretching his limbs as he headed down to the bottom floor of his palace. Designed much like a drug den he'd once frequented, the room was empty but for a solitary pair of shoes. Once, a long time ago, they'd belonged to a boy, Carl Powers, but here they housed Not-Sherlock's memories. All he had to do was put them on and he would know the damage. So he did.
“Looks like an OD, doc. Patient is in his late-20s, found seizing up in an alleyway nearby. Pulse is there but not as strong as I’d like it to be. The low blood pressure and constricted pupils indicate opioid abuse.”
"I don't have friends." The scathing phrase circled endlessly through his head as he walked away, out of the inn and away into the night. It wasn't just that Sherlock had denounced their friendship, it was the subtext, the implied I don't need friends, I don't need you. If he was honest that last hurt more than anything else. If Sherlock didn't think they were friends than who the hell was he to the infuriating man? John spent every minute of his day with or worrying about Sherlock, trying to make sure he wasn't killed by some madman on the street or by his own experiments and most of his nights dreaming about him so if Sherlock felt he didn't need him at all... Well. It was exceedingly dark outside, and the moors were treacherous in themselves, ignoring whatever was going on in Dewers Hollow, and as of a storm out not ten minutes previous John had literally nowhere to go. Wonderful.
Sherlock was on his knees in front of John, tearing the coat away, frantically unhooking the vest and throwing it away from them. He grabbed John's wrists and frowned at the grimace the John could not hide. Gently he peeled back his sleeves to reveal the palette of blues and purples that covered John's wrists in the shape of two hands. Sherlock was furious, his eyes blazed with hatred and, something else. John staggered as Sherlock's hands found his hips and his lips were on his neck. "Sherlock! Wh-what are you do- oohh" John found his hands tangled in Sherlock's soft curls, his mouth begging him to continue the assault on his neck. Sherlock nipped and sucked at the smooth skin with a hunger he usually reserved for cases. His hands crushed John against him, but John liked it. The pure strength that Sherlock exuded was unbearable and had John writhing against the wall. "You. Are. Mine!" Sherlock whispered into his neck. Everyone should know John belonged to him, if marking him was the only way to show it, Sherlock would cover him in marks. When he finally broke away, satisfied with his efforts, John was in shock. The handprints on his hips were Sherlock's own, bruised evenly so the colour would be plain. A navy blue, similar to his scarf. "Mine." He whispered as their lips met. "Yours" John choked out before succumbing to the need of the man against him.
Quietly, so as not to disturb the little boy , he wrapped his arms around John's back, cradling the boy and John simultaneously. John smiled up at him and they rocked softly on the spot. Edward wiped a hand across his face and laughed, pulling Anastasia to him. It had been the best night they'd had in a long time. Anastasia cuddled close and pointed across the room to where John had been with Timothy. "Don't they look like a family?" she asked, smiling still. With Sherlock hugging John into him and John holding Timothy, both grinning madly at each other... "Yes. They truly do."
Instead, Mycroft Holmes let loose a curl of his lips before breaking into a smile that was not really there, but there nonetheless. “That was quite a speech, Doctor Watson. I can see now that my brother is in capable hands. I trust that you will keep me updated on his condition as and when needed. I best be off then, and thank you once again.”
Sherlock wrapped himself around John from behind and hugged him to his chest as they drove away. "When you asked me to help this afternoon I wasn't expecting a secret plan behind the placement of mistletoe" John shrugged and nestled into the warmth of Sherlock's body "Well it was more of a side plan, I just wanted to kiss you under it." Sherlock chuckled warmly. "Merry Christmas my dearest John" "Merry Christmas love"
"Gregory. If you ever entertain the notion of giving me more than I bargain for in an alcoholic beverage again, yes I did see what you put in those graduated cylinders, I will not be responsible for what becomes of you."
Rosie Mia Watson-Holmes is born weighing 7 pounds 6 ounces, at 6:17 pm on the clearest 5th of November for years. Her parents literally fall into the room a minute before she takes her first breath. They both cry when the hear her voice for the first time. She is the lightest thing Sherlock has ever held and he would destroy the world for her already.
He had been content on having his big brother be his one and only source of comfort, but to the contrary, Mycroft had much more pressing matters to handle besides his brother. There would come a day where he would not be around to look out for Sherlock, and it is at this point that it would be reassuring to have someone else to look to for companionship, one who would keep him grounded.
Sherlock thought about it for a second; technically yes but really no. "Not my area." He answered twitching softly in his seat as the statistical probability of the plane plunging to the ground came unbidden to his mind while watching the thirty year old single man demonstrate how to incorrectly use the life jackets provided.
"I will tell you I suppose, although I only know some of it. I cannot tell you how Sherlock felt, or how it began. All I know stems from a single night. It was Sherlock's first year in college and even at 16 he was more brilliant than all the professors combined. In later years he actually took on a lecturer, and proved him wrong in front of the entire student body. I'm told it was quite back then was... More open, he had little to fear and had not yet learned that others were to be feared. Especially if you have feelings for them. It was almost comical, watching Sherlock get banned from the single person room he had procured for setting it alight the fifth time. If you ever happen to be near Oxford, the Talula Hughes house? You can guess who payed for that. Anyhow, that is why Sherlock ended up meeting Sebastian in the first place. He was in his final year, and his roommate had recently killed himself so there was space. Sherlock refused adamantly but in the end he had little choice in the matter. He had to live with him for the final month. He was incredibly intelligent Sebastian, a psychopath. I was there that first day, the college had called me to convince him that education was more important than his single room. I had some people help move his things in. Sherlock was in a huff, but he had not yet met Sebastian. I could not stay so I simply told him to keep me updated. After I left I'm not sure what occurred up to a point. Sherlock never spoke of it. It was the last night of May..."
With that he was gone, racing out of the room and away at full pelt and John, in his utter shock, was too late to really follow him, losing the man down the twisting corridors  like a ghost that was never there to begin with.
Certain that everything was as it should be, John closed the door to the lounge and made his way over to Mrs Jameson’s room to check on her.
As the train pulled into the next station John hopped off and went in search of a ticket for the next one home.
“Yeah well.. I dunno if you knew, but he was brought in a few hours ago from a drowning and laceration to the abdomen. He’s out cold yet, but if you can recall, he wasn’t the friendliest patient around and for reasons beyond me, I was the only doctor he bothered to acknowledge. I know that I’m not scheduled for ICU rounds this week, but would you mind terribly if I switched roster with you, just until Sherlock is up and discharged, at least?”
The next day was spent pool side, with Sherlock and Mycroft stretched out on sun loungers under parasols, ogling their respective partners as they swam and raced in the sun, getting visibly browner as the day wore on.
"So." John addressed the room. "As you can see, that's not exactly an inaccurate representation of me, and it's just a coincidence that I picked these underpants tonight, but I'll just clarify that for you all." John inclined his head to the photo, not noticing the way Sherlock was shifting in his trousers, or Lestrade doing something similar. "The calendar was for charity so we could make sure the children who'd become orphans in Afghanistan could have a home after theirs were destroyed. I don't regret it, but I would appreciate it if you'd not keep it as your screensavers, because I was just doing my job - protecting those people who needed me in any way I could. I'm proud of how I look, but I don't want people to only see that, I want relationships that mean something. Which" he finally turned to Sherlock "was what I was here to talk about in the first place. So I'm going to get dressed now... thanks for uh... listening?" In the blink of an eye he was dressed (a seldom needed skill also left from his army days) and smiling softly at Sherlock who was still frozen on the spot.
Lying splayed out across the sheets, Sherlock was acres of pale skin broken only by a thicket of dark hair and the flush that was creeping down his neck, and his cock straining towards the sky, the same alluring shade of rose as his cheeks. “You beautiful creature. Just
Later when Sherlock was enjoying John's hands running through his hair he came to a realisation. "John?" "Mmmm?" "We forgot to turn on the camera"
“Did you forget the part about being stabbed as well?” John asked, dipping his head inside the door. Sherlock cursed himself. He hadn't even noticed the man move. “Because if you did, moving was probably the fastest but least enjoyable way to remember.” John smiled wryly down at him, slipping his phone into the pocket of his coat as he moved to get Sherlock's chart from the end of his bed.
Mrs Hudson was the first to arrive, mainly because she had food and needed extra hands to cart it from one apartment to the other. John swiped a gingerbread man when she wasn't looking and winked conspiratorially at Sherlock from behind her back, making him smirk as he continued to hang various decorations. 221b was filled with a cozy glow of warm light from the fire and the strings of twinkling lights around the room by the time everyone else arrived. "Alright John?" Greg smiled as he grabbed a glass of mulled wine. "Alright Greg. How's things?" John smiled warmly. "Good actually yeah, the new place is nice, good neighbourhood." Lestrade gave a half smile and swigged back the rest of the liquid in his glass, nodding at Sherlock who was clearly making a painful effort not to snap at Molly while she chatted at him and had resorted to throwing back drinks. "He's well... He's Sherlock. Pray he doesn't get the urge to cuddle because while the man is surprisingly closed when sober, drunken Sherlock is an indiscriminate hugger. He made me assist him in his experiment. Trust me. I know." The pair chuckled away in the corner of the room, chatting for a few hours about everything from football to cases. When John heard the faint sounds of footsteps on the stairs he made a beeline for Sherlock in the kitchen. Sherlock was lounging against the table on his elbows, a bright smile etched on his face that had even Mrs Hudson giggling as she and Molly spoke quietly to each other, sneaking glances at Angelo, who was talking to Lestrade, every few seconds. Mycroft knocked once before entering, eyes sweeping the apartment. "Apologies, I was delayed" he smirked and swung his umbrella, sidling into the kitchen to grab some of Mrs Hudson's truly phenomenal Christmas cake.
Orabelle arrived back with a garment bag slung across her arms and closed the bedroom door with a click before hanging the bag on the door of the wardrobe and placing a stack of boxes on the ground beneath it. "Well I believe that's everything you'll need in the morning." Sherlock looked the pile up and down, one bag, one shoe box, one set of cufflinks. "And John?" The two women laughed and Sherlock frowned, he didn't enjoy missing something and he clearly was. "Bad luck to see him before the wedding, traditionally you have to sleep apart and then only see each other when you reach the aisle." Well that was just ridiculous. He'd not slept apart from John by choice since they'd started sleeping together and this was not the time to separate them. Clearly Mummy saw the consternation on his face because she simply gave him a hard look that she'd perfected over years of trying to get him to shut up when father was around. No arguments allowed then. "Just wonderful." he sneered and hopped up from the couch. "Well I'm going to go find John seeing as we apparently don't have that much longer to talk" Sherlock looked at the orange light coming in through the windows and rushed to the door with a perfunctory acknowledgment of the others in the room "Mrs Hudson, Mummy." A voice - Mummy - called after him "No telling John what room you're in so he can sneak in! I'm next door and a very light sleeper!"
"I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but her tongue has been down more throats than water bottles have been. I wouldn't set my heart on her is all I'm trying to say Mike, It's probably not the best idea. Back me up here John, Abbey Bernstein isn't right for our Mikey is she?" Greg joked, elbowing John affectionately.
Should he explain what had happened between them and try to jog Sherlock's memory, or should he let nature take its course and hope that it either came back to Sherlock before he decided to leave the hospital or that the same chemistry sparked between them again?
“Paula, can you maybe tell me what… all this, is about?” he asked hesitantly. Paula gave him a tight smile as she rubbed the back of her colleagues.
“OK.” John barked at them both and silence, shocked and sudden, fell. He didn't feel the need to raise his voice again. “Ok. Mary, maybe you should go and take a break for a few minutes, I can handle it from here.” With a glare at Sherlock who wiggled his fingers in a taunting wave, Mary stormed out of the room. Which left himself, Sherlock, and about six other patients in various states of waking alone together. As soon as Mary had disappeared from view, John wheeled around on Sherlock.
The invitation lay opened on the kitchen table, forest green calligraphy curling about the small card like vines. Sherlock had been staring at it for hours now, hadn't even noticed when John had woken up and began pattering about the flat. Of course he'd been expecting it. He received one every year. This time, however, was different.
Greg and Mike watched with mouths agape as Irene led John into the woods by the arm, disappearing into the greenery with him in tow and heading, if they weren't mistaken, towards the lake.
Sherlock was grateful. His turn for interrogation would come, he knew that. For now he was being given a reprieve, however brief, to compose himself. Why he needed to compose himself, he wasn't quite sure, but he had a niggling suspicion that a certain blonde haired, family-less for the holidays, stubborn doctor had something to do with it.
There was a beat of silence as Greg registered the teeth marks on Sherlock's  hip and  John had the odd realisation that he'd never  even seen Mycroft's ankle before, let alone his chest hair, which just happened to be a sort of auburn red.
"But the suit. It was like 5am and BAM! He's in a suit! Who's awake enough to be able to suit up at five in the morning? I only gave you a few minutes notice and yet here you are... In the hospital. In a
“Lunch will be in an hour or so brother mine, I'll let them know where you've gone.” Mycroft's voice softened, laced with something akin to understanding which was frightening at the best of times but even more infuriating when Sherlock himself was confused, both by it and by his own acceptance of said understanding. Clearly he was in more trouble than he'd first thought.
He pushed through the crowd and grabbed John, dragging him away regardless of the loud hey that was yelled at him. Sherlock practically sprinted to the door and dragged John with him, pushing him back into the alley as soon as they reached the outside world. John's back connected with the wall of the club and he raised his hands to push Sherlock back when he looked into his eyes. Sherlock , it rolled off him in waves. He was still out of it, apparently dancing like that was like being drunk for John. "Dear lord! What's wrong Sherlock?" he yelled crankily as Sherlock began to stalk towards him, keeping their eyes locked. Faster than lightening Sherlock's pale hand was grabbing his cheeks and turning his head roughly to the side.
Greg was pacing their bedroom anxiously. They'd only just found their feet again and here he was, ignored again! The door creaked open and Mycroft walked in looking almost sheepish. Too right. "Damn it all Mycroft! What's going on?! First you're all over me, then you can't seem to be far enough away! I'm getting whiplash here, You know I love you but this game you're playing is messing me right up." He ran a hand through salt and pepper hair and sighed. "Just... explain. Please." Mycroft sat down on the couch and rubbed at his temples. "I love you too Gregory, obviously. It's nothing to do with you at all, it's my relatives. They would not accept our relationship, in fact they would first ridicule and then shun us both. I wished to save you from their scorn. I apologise for my lack of communication once again." He looked up at a strange sound to find Greg holding his hand over his mouth to stifle giggles. "Sorry My but, we just can't seem to do the whole communication thing can we? it's kinda funny don't you think? I would have totally understood if you just told me, you know? We should really work on that. Now" Greg smiled at an astounded Mycroft "If I can't lavish my affection on you out there I'll just have to save it all for in here. Let me help you with those clothes." Mycroft protested lamely as Greg unbuttoned his shirt slowly. "Gregory we will be heard!" Button. "Well" button. "You'll" button. "Just" button. "Have" button "To be" button. "Quiet." And he was, although the teeth marks on his hand and the bite mark on Greg's shoulder would require some covering up in the morning.
me?" Sherlock's eyes were wide and innocent, a vulnerability seeped from him. John did not hesitate in his answer, honesty was the only way forward. "Yes Sherlock, I do like you. Since the first time we met I liked you, surprisingly enough." Sherlock smiled brightly. "Good. I like you too. Now what do we do?" John shrugged. It was good to know that Sherlock liked him too but it was a huge step to go from friends to more than that. "We'll think about it in the morning ok? Let's just get some sleep." John closed his eyes and started to drift off when he felt Sherlock's skin against his own, shuffling back into his body. John moved his arms around Sherlock and pulled him closer. "Night Sh'lock" Sherlock nestled closer. "Goodnight John."
It was a few days after the Molly conversation and Sherlock had not yet slept, a new case was just about to finish and he needed to be awake. That would have been fine, but the downside to sixty eight hours awake was that his already flimsy filter seemed to become entirely useless. That's how, while perched in his chair and staring at John in the kitchen in a towel Sherlock had moaned loudly. John, concerned as ever for his friend, was up almost immediately. "I'm fine John. Just thinking about buggering you into the table." If Sherlock had been less focused on two other important topics he would have registered the intense embarrassment that coursed through his blood. He was busy however with a case and he hadn't been lying when he'd said that he was thinking about buggering John into the table. The towel was not helping matters at all, neither were the small translucent beads of water rolling down his chest.
Sherlock paid no heed to the ache in his arms as he ran to the exit with John. As he had planned the ambulance and police were waiting outside, clearly the texts had worked. He rushed John over to the gurney and softly laid him down. Doctors rushed about,hooking up an IV with blood and pain killers,swabbing his arm, stitching his abdomen, taking his vitals. "His breathing is faint, probably ribs. Better take him in." They were a matched set now, both killing someone for harming the other. Sherlock did not let go of his hand, even when they were driving to the hospital, and when they were taking the xray he held a leg. The doctors tried to get him to leave but Sherlock simply admitted the truth. "I love him." They left him be after that.
just for something to do! You don't understand what it's like! Without the cocaine, without proper stimulation I'm torn apart from the inside out, and these people that are
John glanced down at his watch, and Sherlock was, of course, right, but something felt wrong about leaving when he was acting so strangely.
His patient could only glare back at him, clearly unnerved at having not scared this particular person away with his deductions where others were quick to flee before he could cause any further emotional harm. The man’s mouth twitched a bit at the corner but he promptly cleared his face of all emotion and snorted haughtily.
So we'll be back to Baker street next chapter, it's been too long. A case, that's what I'm thinking... prepare for a wild ride... Keep the ideas coming! -S
Thinking back, John had seen the look in Sholto’s eyes the day he saw his supposed soulmate dead on the cold metal trolley. It was the cold dread of realisation and agony and despair of losing someone he had never known reflected in those wide steel-grey eyes that made John pray that the same never happened to him. Now here he was, slapped with the possibility of losing Sherlock to an uncertain future.
"Molly?"Molly opened her mouth and closed it again like a fish, the pieces slowly clicking together in her head. She could see it now, the way Sherlock looked at John. It was the same way she looked at him sometimes. And while personally she didn't want to say for hope that one day Sherlock would feel for her, she knew that it would be a crime to keep them apart. "You'd have nothing to worry about Sherlock. John feels the same way, trust me." Sherlock stared at her, reading her every minute movement. She wasn't lying. Interesting. Very interesting. Well now that he knew... Maybe he could see exactly how far he had to push to get John to admit it. Of course he could always just ruin it all by blurting out his thoughts. Which is exactly what he ended up doing.
All the speculation about us should probably have tipped me off, he never denied it when people said we were together, but I assumed it was a Sherlock thing. He's my best friend and as of a few months back, my fiancé. That's right folks, Sherlock proposed. Rather we both proposed simultaneously, long story. Yes, we're set to tie the knot as it were in the spring and I honestly couldn't be happier. We're a matching set he once said, yes Sherlock I know it's not the same context but it works. We are a set, in our own odd way, but at least it's never normal. Normal is boring. He's currently on his way back from an experiment that has left him 'bloodied' in his own words. At least the head in the fridge is gone.
"Bienvenue à la France monsieurs, venez, il y a une voiture pour vous au parking, si vous voulez il y a un chauffeur mais le Holmes aîne a pensé que vous preférè faire ça?"
Sherlock hadn't realised that John smelled so good, a mixture of tea, biscuits and aftershave. He liked it. With his ear to John's chest he heard the slight change in his breathing, he was waking up.
Sherlock couldn't believe it. John's fuse was unlimited it seemed, and the fondness in his smile... he was too good and Sherlock had been blind, he'd observed but not seen and now he looked, it was more obvious than a slice of cake on Mycroft's waist. He could never have done anything to deserve this man, but by some twist of fate they'd been thrust together and slowly, like a diamond forming, he'd fallen for him with every part of himself. Sure, he'd known objectively that John must be attractive, the constant stream of women on his tail seemed to suggest that, but staring up at him now from the floor of the tube, Sherlock could see him, and his strong thighs made for the chase, and his hands that had saved and taken lives, for himself and Sherlock too, and his ruggedly handsome face, and the blonde hair that he wanted to see rumpled by his hand, and he wanted him. He flicked his eyes to the side at the line of seats... no Sherlock he admonished himself. John doesn't even know. The arrival of the police was a damper to that train of thought anyway, but he couldn't stop his mind from wondering what John looked like, truly looked like, beneath all those layers of hideously baggy (wonderfully John) jumpers. As it happened, he would find out sooner than he thought.
“Today you exclaimed exceptional, last week it was amazing, wondrous, unbelievable… why do you do that? I have tried in vain to chart each instance, trying to find some rhyme or reason. You are the only person that consistently does this, Watson, and I… I need to know
“Oh Sherlock, surely you must know how I had longed for an opportunity to know whether my feelings were one sided, that last night was the culmination of years of yearning for you, that I would never, in any world there is where you and I dwell together, ever let you go once I had you?”
"Basically Sherlock the thing is that I think I like you, in a "Let's go home and see what's under your clothes" way but also in a "I might be in love with you and it's making me a bit reckless to be honest"way too. Sorry I get rambley when I'm nervous, and it's dawning on me how odd that statement sounds because I just stripped off in front of an office full of people we know without batting an eye and now you're still just kind of standing there, so I'm going to go home but if you can move in the next ten seconds we could go together because I really would like to see what your skin tastes like, and I could explain the whole 'tattoo of your name across a skull on my arm' thing away from all of them. There are some things they don't get to see. Besides" John moved in, breathing hotly onto Sherlock's neck "You're the only one I want to see under the camouflage." Sherlock took a ragged breath and the look in his eyes was fire hot as he grabbed John's hand and yelled for a cab.
The next five days passed with little incident, although John had to be calmed many times to avoid him murdering a gossiping relative in his defense of Sherlock (a fact that Sherlock found endlessly lovely), and Greg would have to abort many affectionate gestures (the realisation of just how many made Mycroft blush at how sappy they were), the final night of the relatives stay had arrived, as had about five hundred other people dressed in glamorous ball gowns and tuxes.
Holmes focused on the door across the street from theirs, noticing now the signs of freezing and refreezing that would have caused trouble for those trying to open them as Watson’s voice grew distant (Changing out of his wet clothes, his brain supplied readily) and then close again
John was beginning to feel woozy, the blood had slowed to a creep, thick droplets rolling sluggishly across his skin, chasing rivulets of sweat to pool around his back. Sebastian watched him, stared at him even, as if he were a piece of food. The cigarette was half done, and that meant that his break was half done too. Sebastian's eyes swept up his arm and settled at the top of it, where his captain's patch was sewn on. Two steps and he was looming over him, blowing smoke in his eyes before pulling the cylinder from his lips and placing the tip onto his patch. The fibres shriveled quickly, blackening into wisps of nothing and still the burning went on. His skin was bare before Sebastian moved off, pulling the bracelet from his wrist. That made John furious, more so than he had been throughout the affair. It confused him as well, right up until Sebastian pressed the engraved surface against his newly exposed skin. The lighter flickered to life and illuminated the room for a few moments before Sebastian pressed it against the metal. John could smell his skin sizzling, burning his name into his skin. As the tag began to heat up it burned red and black, certainly second degree John thought as he struggled against the bonds, tearing the holes in his stomach wider with his movement. At least one thing had been clarified. He was in an old psychiatric hospital.
Sherlock stood at his side quietly while Clara chatted away and they waited for the doctor to come and tell them when Harry could leave. "A week from today should do it, lacriscopic surgery takes much less recovery time. Until then Ms Watson needs as much rest as she can get so I'm going to have to ask you all to leave, come back tomorrow at eleven or two." The gang bid Harry farewell, hugging her in turn. When it reached Sherlock he too leaned in, but whispered softly to her "I won't tell him, but he should be told by the end of the week. I know what you're planning and he will want to say goodbye properly." He breathed it so quietly that had he been any further back she would have missed it. "They'll know by the time I leave here, I've got a flight booked for that afternoon. Switzerland." Sherlock nodded against her. "I am truly sorry Harriet, regardless of what you think of me I did not intend this to be the outcome of a jibe of mine. Can you accept my apology?" The last time he'd been this sincere in an apology was... Back when he'd been using. He'd thrown up on Lestrade's shoes. They were nice for once. "Of course. Be good to him won't you? He loves you a lot and after everything I, dad, mum even, after all we put him through, he deserves to be happy. Even if its with you" she joked, but he was Sherlock Holmes, and there was no one on this planet that could hide the sound of tears in their voice from him. He mightn't cry at the funeral, but a part of him would miss Harry Watson.
When Sherlock woke, he was both shocked and pleased to find John was still in bed with him. He could feel John's arm under his back, hand drooped lazily in the crook of his elbow while the other was covering his own which were lying on johns chest. He hadn't had a single nightmare. Sherlock had almost forgotten how restoring sleep could be, usually if he tried he ended up in a worse state than before, dreams of a past life he'd rather forget plagued him every time he closed his eyes, and his mind rebelled against the black thoughts sleep dropped there.
Sherlock held John against him,  chest to chest as they danced in the throng,  elated still at the novel sensation of  a wedding ring against his skin,  his husband against his chest, smiling wickedly as he moved against him in ways that called into question the level of public decency that was required. Then again, He could spot two couples who'd had sex under a bridge in the past three to six hours and another five that had seen them, and  that was just the ones that had lingered.  There were of course 'Policia' hanging about but they were incredibly lax, waiting, Sherlock suspected with some degree of respect, for a real crime to be committed.  Which left them in the blissful position of being able to do pretty much anything they liked. This, this was freedom.
"You won't enjoy yourself John, I'm warning you now while there's still time to administer a mild dose of anthrax" John shook his head and smiled. "No anthrax. We'll survive, plus a whole weekend away might be nice for a change, no fingers in the jam, no explosions,no potentially deadly fungi on the table" Sherlock smiled a bit at that. It would be a bit more bearable with John at his side. "There's a suitcase in the bottom of the wardrobe, that is if you plan on packing clothes." it sounded ridiculously suggestive, then again, most things that came out of Sherlock's mouth did. John thrust a piece of toast into Sherlock's hands and then opened the wardrobe.
Sherlock froze momentarily before plucking a picture of the crime scene from the pile. “This is obviously a crime of passion judging by the state of the victim’s clothing and-”
It was John in the end, who endeavoured to open the door to the drawing room. He stood back, allowing the other two men to enter before closing the door with a quiet click behind them. Mycroft was lounging in an armchair facing a large fire place while Mummy Holmes was in a chair by the window, her grey hair sitting in a sleek bun on her head. Mycroft addressed the party first.
They sat together in companionable silence as they ate and drank their fill, and John was perfectly content to bid his friend goodnight, as it was later than even he was used to, when Holmes began to speak.
Sherlock slumped against him, wrapping himself up in John in any way he could, pressing them together until there was next to no space between them  and even then it wasn't close enough. This man, he thought to himself, this is the man who I get to share my life with.
The green wrapping paper was unceremoniously ripped apart by Dan and before John could grasp what was happening, he was being enveloped in a bone-crushing hug by the burly hospital security guard.
. At least that brief stint in the Thames hadn't damaged his mental acuity or his ability to deduce too badly.
, he recalled, surprisingly - offered, her smile a bit too wide, her body almost fully pressed against the doctor's side and voice unashamedly presenting in a purr-like manner.
“but I of course stayed to stoke the fire, never mind a bit of cold and wet for me, a lady of Mrs Hudson’s years should not be subjected to the same, which is why, my treasure, I had to leave our bed in the first place, though you must know I did not wish to.“
“Be my guest,” Sherlock said, easing himself back onto the bed, his mind already far away. He watched with mild interest as the doctor exposed his upper torso, gently palpating the area around the bandage, prompting a few pained winces from the patient.
John pulled out a lighter and lit his cigarette, placing the stick between his lips. Sherlock had almost forgotten that he had one. His lungs burned with want, but there was no box in his pockets, just the single cylinder in his mouth. John caught Sherlock staring at the glowing cigarette and inhaled deeply. He pulled it from his lips and moved closer to Sherlock until there was almost no space between them. Gently he tilted Sherlock' down to his own and when their lips were less than a hairs breadth apart he breathed out long tendrils of smoke directly into Sherlock's mouth. It had been unexpected, but Sherlock was burning,the fire that had begun in his stomach had seared it's way to his heart and it was beating with the fervor of a steam train now that John was so close to him. He inhaled the smoke and puffed it back out into the night as John inhaled again, this time smiling and then pressing his lips to Sherlock's before allowing the smoke to trickle out and into Sherlock's mouth. The nicotine went straight to his veins and Sherlock felt more alert than he had for a while now. John did not pull their lips apart. If anything he moved closer, and Sherlock could not help but respond, placing a hand on his lower back and pressing him into his body as they kissed. His mouth was already open and the addition of John's tongue was a very pleasant experience.
"Couldn't say, I'm not working at full capacity, think he gave me a concussion before he stole our phones." Sherlock chimed brightly enough that John had to laugh while he groaned. Trust this to be the one time he couldn't rely on Sherlock's massive intellect to get them out of the trouble he'd gotten them into.
Sherlock frowned up at John from his place, draped across John's arms as he weaved his way through stacks of produce. "A fridge. Why on earth would he put us in an industrial fridge?"
Guess who? Firstly: THANK YOU, seriously, you've all been super patient and kind to me which I really appreciate. Secondly, I promise you guys that I will finish this series and I'm so close I can taste it, so bear with me for just a little while longer! As a small thank you for waiting, if you have anything specific you'd like the next chapter to be please let me know and I'll do my very best to make it happen - You can drop me a line here or on my tumblr @matchingbulletwounds , as always, I love you all and I hope you enjoy, ~S
The villa was fully stocked, as was the smaller guest house at the back. He did not need to hear what those Sherlock and John got up to ever again. It had been traumatic enough the first time, and he would happily go his entire life without ever repeating the experience.  To see the house, after almost twenty years, was like seeing it all anew. The sun gleamed brightly off white washed walls, streaming in lines across the slats of blue shuttered windows and baking the terracotta tiles of the roof, while massive pink rhododendrons cast rose shadows on the limestone driveway and lemons ripened on trees before your very eyes. The heat was a presence you could hear, washing thickly across the grounds as bees hummed lazy flight patterns and swallows glided through an azure sky, chirping their pleasure at such an idyllic scene.
"Here, ta ke my hand" John grabbed it, unthinking. After all the cuffs made doing anything else rather difficult. That said, it didn't stop the tingle John felt at his touch, not just because their hands were cold. "Of course I'd be thinking about that right now when we've just become fugitives" John muttered to himself, confident that Sherlock hadn't heard a word over the traffic and the constant noise of their footfalls as they ran. Even though his fist still throbbed from punching the director, and he was running from the police and his home, he was in pure bliss, Sherlock had never allowed this level of contact, and John couldn't seem to get enough.
But time had made taking that leap, had made even looking seem an insurmountable undertaking. Sometimes John wondered when he had become a coward. Somehow the fear of losing Sherlock again was more potent to him than losing his life in a warzone had ever been.
His phone rang, and for a moment he was tempted to let it ring out, but that would just add more issues to the pile he had accrued so he picked up. "Mycroft Holmes" he answered dully, hoping this would be over soon so he could wallow. "What did you do?!" Lucia's voice, tight and strained washed over him. What had he done? "I apologised, but Gregory thought I was breaking off our relationship and confessed that he loved me even still after leaving him and then he left." Lucia ground her teeth audibly "He tells you, as I knew that he would, that he's in love with you, and you just… Stand there in silence until he's gone?!" Mycroft made a small noise of assent. "Do you have any idea— My God sometimes— You don't even— Imagine my surprise when I get a text asking if surveillance on Greg should continue after his departure, I thought they were having me on, and imagine the shock I got when I said yes and asked for the feed only to find that they were being serious and that he was leaving, in a bloody taxi for Christ sake! At least half an houryou had to go downstairs and fix everything but no! I don't… I never wanted to see my friend like this Mycroft." She put herself on hold with that and his text alert pinged, and even though he didn't press anything the message opened to show him a high resolution photo of Greg's face as he was leaving. He was ashen, mouth held in a tight line, but the real kicker were his eyes, always full of sparkle and laughter, they were dead, glassy and vaguely unseeing, giving him a lost look. "You need to fix it Mycroft, go find him and tell him that you love him too and that you're an idiot because you are, and he might not take you back after this but you have to try do you hear me? I've sent the car around, I have a meeting to get to, but if, in the next hour, you haven't tried your damnedest to get that man back, I will kick you so hard you won't remember your own name." She hung up indignantly and Mycroft ran a hand through his hair. She was right to be mad at him of course, she had tried to tell him to swallow his fear but he'd reverted to cowardice and hurt not only himself, but Gregory in the process. The look on his face… There was a burning behind his eyes that he hadn't experienced since his youth and when David arrived he attempted to pull himself together, though the older man's eyes told him that he knew all anyway. Mycroft didn't even have to say the address.
"Well shit, I think John's beat us to it! Come on, let's go verify the deed is done before we abandon our efforts." Greg waggled his eyebrows at Mike and together they made their way discreetly into the forest after their friends, keeping a fair distance between them until they made it to the same spot they had been in that morning and hid behind the same tree. The sound of flute music drifted towards them and through the foliage Irene came into view, playing a pretty melody in the sunlight.
Greg opened his eyes and groaned blearily, his head banging and memory fuzzy, he blinked slowly as he sat up and saw Mycroft in a similar state at his side, but the cheeky git had managed to get his pants back on. Whatever they'd gotten up to last night, and Greg was gleefully awaiting those flashbacks, must have been great fun, if the pair of his suit trousers strung along a bush was anything to go by. Greg stood up and stretched, basking in the glow of a surprisingly warm for the time of year sun and opened his eyes again only to stare awkwardly as Sherlock looked at him and abruptly shoved his husband into a car and drove away. "That might be awkward in the future" Greg muttered to himself as he grabbed his trousers back from the plant life and strode back to grab Mycroft and put him to bed, daft man would have a terrible day if he slept on such an unforgiving surface. Also he kept paracetamol in his suit jacket, and Greg for one had no recollection of where that had gotten to.
Relaxing into his chair, John gave in to his lethargy, willing his muscles to relax, and closed his eyes, visions of a brilliant smile and fond charcoal-grey eyes flashing behind his eyelids.
The second time it had happened John heard the lisp. Sherlock had almost been killed, again, and John asked him, experimentally, if he was doing it all on purpose. "That wouldn't be very thenthible... Jutht want to keep my John thafe" he muttered softly into the pillow and there and then John had decided he would marry that man. After that it became an aprés case ritual of sorts. Sherlock would fall asleep and John would talk to him until he too fell asleep. It was like a warm blanket that John could pull out when Sherlock was ignoring him or when he'd gotten himself into trouble and John was trying to find him. He knew that if awake Sherlock would despise the sentiment filled bouts so he kept them for the night, with the room so dark that the only thing John could see was the pale outline that was Sherlock. Sometimes he simply indulged himself, telling Sherlock exactly how he felt about him without fearing that Sherlock wouldn't reciprocate the sentiment, after all he only replied to questions, not statements.
Three things stuck out like sore thumbs in the familiar plateau. In the grate, a low fire was burning, with just a few dying embers still bravely fighting to keep alight and despite several hours having passed, the tea and chocolate biscuits left by Mrs Hudson at some point earlier in the evening remained untouched.  John hadn’t spent so many years with Sherlock and learned nothing. Plus, he’d once watched Sherlock drink tea that had an
"Remind me to tell you again how fascinating you are John. Fathomless depths." Sherlock smiled as John strode onward toward the door, the door that sprung open to reveal Lestrade, who had pretty much never looked happier to see them.
Holmes held him in place as he whipped around, shock and desire written blatantly across his features. “John.” He breathed, and John couldn’t stop himself, crowding into him, running his hands across his jaw, staring up at those endless eyes, calling his name in return.
"Morning Mrs Hudson, I'll have photos ready to show you later, need to upload them to the old laptop first, maybe you could come up later?" She tapped the use of her nose knowingly and John stuttered out a denial but Sherlock simply beamed at her and pulled him away.  He was more than a little surprised when, as they stood on the landing outside 221b John dropped the bags, pushed his knees out from under him and carried him bridal style across the threshold. John's laughter and Sherlock's embarrassment lasted for only a few moments though as they took in the sight that was their flat.
Meanwhile he was in his hospital bed, and starting to feel the telltale signs of withdrawal. It had been almost 72 hours since he crashed and he was starting to feel more agitated by the minute. The few times he had succumbed to sleep were cut short by haunting dreams that left him soaked waist-up.
"You've been paying attention Watson! Just a simple leap that you missed this time, perhaps if you had, as you said, the whole picture, it would have come to you. The bruising is in the shape of hand prints, and female hands at that, the width, or rather the lack of it made that much clear." Watson gasped in shock.
Sherlock’s hands were a gentle pressure against his scalp, and once he felt them settle, John dipped his tongue into the salty fluid at the head before sucking the tip into the heat of his mouth. The sound that came out of Sherlock was as if he’d been punched, a shout unlike any John had heard him produce. He was inordinately grateful they had managed to make it upstairs.
He coughed, but did not turn around to face John. “Is it tomorrow already? Or am I still in my head…” Sherlock asked himself more than John, his voice muffled by the couch. In that moment, John couldn’t remember why he was scared to reach out, to tip them over that hairs breadth of a line that kept them from being more, from being happy. John crossed the room and, heart jumping in his throat, laid a delicate hand on Sherlock’s back. The feeling of keloid scarring and ribs and spine and beating heart under his dressing gown. Sherlock: Human, Utterly so.
The road was deserted when they arrived, and John's car was the only one in the lot. With more tenderness than anyone had shown him, John gently settled him into the passenger seat of the car and was in the driver seat moments later. "Did you enjoy your run, Mr Watson?" a disembodied voice chimed as John turned the keys in the ignition. Sherlock whipped round before hissing in pain and moving much more slowly back into the correct sitting position. "What is this voice that knows your name?" he asked curiously, examining the interior of the car for anything he didn't recognise. Chuckling, John soothed a hand across his battered ribs "That would be Jarvis. He's an AI Tony built ages back, the whole tower and all of our cars and phones are Jarvis wired. It was lovely thanks Jarvis, This is Sherlock Holmes by the way, I'm bringing him back to the tower so I can fix him up." This time when the voice sounded Sherlock strained his ears instead of his body."A pleasure to meet you Mr. Holmes. Traffic is minimal, ETA twenty minutes. Shall I inform the team of your impending arrival?" A small crease appeared on Sherlock's face and if John did that kind of thing without getting to know a person first he'd have kissed that line away. "The team?" he ventured,waiting for John's reply. "Yeah" he chuckled again "The Avengers they're called when they're working, really it's just Tony Stark aka owner and builder of Stark tower. Billionaire, Genius, Philanthropist… also known as Iron man. Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, Natasha Romanoff aka The Spider, Clint Barton aka Hawkeye and finally Steve Rogers aka Captain America. Oh! and Director Fury but the chances of him being there are pretty slim." Sherlock wrinkled his nose up. Just what he needed, an abundance of stupidity in one building that he would have to remain in for the time being, at least until he could find a better offer. "… but that's Happy for you, and then there's Mrs. H, she's the housekeeper but really she's more like a mum to everyone." John finished with a nostalgic smile as they sailed through the mid morning traffic. Sherlock remained silent, he could feel the low throb of pain all over his body and quite frankly it seemed better to grit his teeth than lash out at the one potential ally he had on this planet.
“Marie, you haven't seen the guy who came in with Mr Holmes have you?” John ventured at the nurses station, looking around for any sign of him. Marie smiled and looked up from her paperwork.
Slowly, the pace seemed so utterly glacial, their faces moved closer and closer together until both could taste the salty brine of tears in the air, and John's lips were on Sherlock's, warm and supple and inviting, as if they'd been waiting for this all this time. He tasted of tea and toast and all the comforts of home and Sherlock was so grateful that he had gotten to experience a first kiss, and a last kiss with John before he'd missed his chance. They broke apart and John's thumb, solid and steady, brushed across his cheek. "I think, love, it's time to go to sleep." Tears streamed steadily down Sherlock's cheeks. "I don't want to go." John's head fell to rest against Sherlock's chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart. "I know, I don't want you to go either, don't worry, I'll be with you the whole time. Sleep. I'm here." Slowly but surely, both men nodded off, the steady thud of two hearts falling into rhythm as their lullaby.
“I had thought perhaps last night was, for you, an aberration. We did not discuss so much as… Demonstrate, and I had hoped that upon waking we would speak on it further. However, you were gone by that time and I was… unsure.” Sherlock’s voice trembled into John’s hair , soft as the snow still falling outside.
The first thing Sherlock noticed, as he began to come to, was how cold he was despite the thick wool of his coat separating him from the... concrete? Groggily opening an eye, Sherlock tried to reconcile what he was seeing with what he understood of the known universe- either the suspect's home had been hidden somehow inside a cheese factory, or he had stumbled into an alternate universe, or, and the longer he stared up at the towering block of cheeses, the more he was swaying towards this one, he had been discovered during the small, technically undocumented search that he and John had been doing, and then been knocked out and stowed away in somewhere that was familiar to their suspect, Henry Long.
This time, for whatever reason, was different. Top record for duration of the highly strung periods had been four days, and then a case had taken over their lives and put it to bed. They were seven days in to this one and in John's eyes there was no reprieve in sight, if anything Sherlock was getting worse, constantly clenching his jaw, pacing, yelling and throwing himself on the couch all while glaring at John as if he'd done something terrible like hidden a body without Sherlock's help. It had gotten to the point where he felt uncomfortable leaving it to peter out on its own. To be fair he never in a million years would have guessed at what Sherlock would ask of him.
There was one small, easily ignored part of him that didn’t really want to know. For now, John was a wonderfully diverting enigma, a crackable puzzle that came in an unexpectedly aesthetically pleasing package. Although Sherlock didn’t quite buy into the idea of all that soulmates nonsense, he couldn’t help but admit to a startling level of… abdominal
Carefully, so as not to exacerbate the burn that marred his (left thankfully) arm, John stripped the remains of the shirt off, leaving it dangling from the right shoulder as he set to work. It was a marvel to watch as John fell into a state of complete control and confidence in his actions, for him, doctor or soldier were skins that fit like a glove. The quiet was overwhelming, yet neither man strove to break the tension that burned between them as John smoothed cream across his arm, every so often meeting his gaze with a half smile and then looking away again while Sherlock remained transfixed by him. His hand lingered for a moment when he was finished as he stared at the contrast between his skin, lightly golden from the sun, and the pale white of Sherlock's arm, and just as Sherlock had worked up the nerve to cover the hand with his own it was gone.
Greg had not slept at all, he replayed Sherlock's soft cries over and over in his head. If he hadn't before, he now fully understood John's hatred. It was apparently completely warranted. The bed was warm, stiflingly so, and as it had just turned six am, He figured it was an acceptable hour now to ask Mycroft."Mycroft?" Greg whispered, though they both knew he was awake. "Yes Gregory?" "I overhead Sherlock last night, crying out in his sleep..." Mycroft shifted towards him. "It's rather unnerving is it not? Now you are intrigued as to how on earth that could happen, how anyone could touch the untouchable correct?" Greg shook his head. "It's not that, although it was shock enough when he let John... No it's more the fact that he's so... Childlike in some ways and I don't know how someone could do something so horrible that he..." Mycroft sighed. Clearly it was time to tell Gregory the story. John would get it in his own time from Sherlock himself and that would be important for them both.
A short rap on the door that could only be one person made him look up. Lucia was standing before him with a frown on her face. "If it's the issue with Syria again tell them that we have to let it run the course of the year or else we'll have a full scale war on our hands -" Lucia held up her hand and Mycroft stared at her as she tucked her blackberry into her pocket. "Lucia?" he asked. In all of his time working with this woman, he'd not seen her without the phone firmly glued to her hand. "Mr. Holmes." She began with a severe look "I have worked for you for nearly twenty years now, and I feel like that entitles me as the single person that knows you best to give you a good dressing down when you need one. So. With all due respect sir, I'm about to do just that." Mycroft sat back, eyes wide and silent in his chair, feeling like he was a child being scolded even though Lucia was quite a few years his junior.
By the time they'd arrived, the grounds had been inundated with a gang of brightly coloured people with flowers in hair and feet without shoes, some slowly plucking guitar strings along with melodic singing, with a line of beautiful elfin girls dancing around them, the constant scratch of lead on paper coming from all corners as bodies hunched over sketchbook and note pad, others having impassioned debates about, if John was remembering his secondary school years correctly, the legitimacy of the theory that Antonio and Bassanio were lovers all along.* "Wow." Sherlock grunted in response and grabbed his arm, guiding him away from the grass that he'd somehow managed to reach without even noticing and towards the house.
"What, like get Katie to break up with Andy and get with John? Because I thought I saw Katie and Coop earlier getting all friendly so the chances of us pulling that off are pretty slim."
To be honest John hadn't even been all that surprised that she had picked up on the little (all consuming, John, admit that at least) spark that had been growing between them, even though he'd tried to avoid him, there are only so many times you can be caught lurking outside a door before people start to question your motives, doctor or not.
"Well, it looks to be the hip" he began warily, Holmes' slight nod all he required to continue " there is some bruising on the surface, although quite what
Over the course of the game everyone had snuggled into the bed and were lying down drowsily. "I disagree with all of you. Mols and Dimmock are the cutest" she yawned out from behind her hand. "We weren't an option Lil you can't just-" "Shhh. Yes I can. I'm Lily Hooper and I do what I want. Now go to sleep before I put my new karate skills into practice on you, we've a wedding to go to in twenty six hours."
From microscopic skulls to chemical formulae for adrenaline to anatomically correct labels of the bones in the foot, each pair had been chosen with Sherlock specifically in mind.
Sherlock observed everyone they passed on their way down the corridor (Three cat lovers, two polyamourus women, five IVF patients, one illegitimate child, two couples considering adoption) and wondered if there was any way they could avoid telling anyone about their child until they were born. Unlikely, but it'd make things easier for him and John. In fairness they wouldn't have to deal with old biddies stopping them on the street to ask when the baby was due, if they knew the sex and other such insipid questions, that was Mary's cross to bear. Along with that neither of the Baker street duo would have to stop working until they literally had a child in their arms which was good because there had been a case a couple of months back that even Sherlock couldn't solve, an invisible man with an invisible knife, and he needed to reaffirm his reputation.
John had tears in his eyes as he reached into his pocket and choked out a peal of laughter "I suppose now is a good time to give you these then" he handed the boxes across and Sherlock's eyebrows flew up, an earsplitting smile breaking out on his face as tears threatened to spill over. "John?" he asked and John understood what he meant. Sherlock needed to hear this, so unsure of it still. He stood up and took Sherlock's hand in his. "Sherlock Holmes. You have always been braver than I am, smarter than I am, a thousand times more beautiful than I could ever be, but no one would be more proud than I would be if you said yes. Somehow, out of all the people on earth I managed to find the one person I would happily spend my life with. If I could go back in time, to when I got shot, given the chance to change it, to save myself, I would do it a million times over, getting shot each time, just to be sure I would meet you again. I was so alone and I owe you so much, I owe you everything. And I love you Sherlock, more than anything else in the world I love you. Will you do me the honour of becoming my husband?" Sherlock's hands cupped his chin and he drew their faces together. "Well?" he asked, knowing the answer. "I do" John whispered. "I do" Sherlock answered and they slipped the rings onto each other's fingers before crushing their lips together with a fiery passion because his veins were singing, John was his fiancé.
John looked down at Sherlock for a split second, seeing joy and absolute terror, but mostly joy, mirrored on his face, and ran.
"Not quite the whole time no, besides, you have a gift for singing that's rather extraordinary, I should hope you wouldn't begrudge a man one of his great pleasures, would you Mr Watson?" Sherlock asked warmly as the now shy fellow pulled an undershirt over his head. A cheeky grin slid across his features as he mopped his brow.
Much to the mortification of Greg Lestrade, his number was on speed dial. He could now attest to the sexual prowess of both Sherlock and John, if the volume of their shouting was any indication. He hung up very quickly and went for a pint. It might have only been ten am, but this time he really needed one.
Last night. That was really the place to start seeing as he'd been thinking about it ever since. He'd actually considered stepping into Sherlock's space and kissing the arrogant sod speechless, and while he'd been pretty sure about his sexuality until now, his mind, contrary to what he'd have expected, was totally on board with that plan. Still was in truth. He didn't have a problem with being gay or anything, but he really wasn't sure if that was what this was. It could have been the culmination of a stressful situation, an explosion of tension between the only two people there? He looked back over the past three years he'd known Sherlock, and the two he'd spent mourning him (he'd grown a mourn-stache for Let's sake) and quickly came to the realisation that perhaps his feelings for Sherlock had been growing all the time, he'd just kind of ignored them, and then of course there was the whole dead thing, so really, it wasn't exactly his fault that he'd not discovered them before.
John had been more than happy to oust Sherlock from the flat that morning because he needed time to get his head together again and to be honest the detective's presence wasn't exactly conducive to rational thought at the moment. Aside from anything else, Sherlock would have seen through him instantly had he tried to sort through all of this with him around, so it seemed like a stroke of luck that Lestrade needed him to fill in a stack of reports. Before he did any soul searching he made himself a cup of tea, because tea, it's widely known, cures all ills.
"Wha-" John was mildly confused about why they were here exactly. "As the conventional couple we are, it's socially acceptable for us to go out for a meal together, a date?" It was more of a question than a statement. John smiled one of his crooked smiles that made Sherlock's brain meltdown. Even in that hideous jumper John was dashing. "It is, I'd love to go on a date with you Sherlock" They both blushed a small bit as Sherlock hopped out of the car and held out his hand. "Shall we?"
“Christ. Like what? Like, stroke level? What's the worst case scenario?” Greg babbled when his tongue finally found the ability to form shapes again. “Please. I just, I want to be prepared.”
"He was possessed I suppose, by some belief in humanity. He assumed that this was the right thing to do. After all it would mean little, they had already crossed the threshold, this was a non issue. He wanted Sebastian to be... more" Greg was almost positive now. He found himself feeling rage boiling up in his stomach. He tried to lay still but Mycroft knew. "Try not to be so evident around Sherlock, he'll see right through you. That day I just happened to be nearby..."
Shock. An untamed pulse of it that blew through each of their bodies as if a bomb had gone off. How had they not seen this, noticed this, felt this before? It seemed unignorable, a constant current raging beneath everything now that they were staring at it in the face, but so very impossible before.

There was a soft cough from behind them and Sherlock growled. "What do you want this time Mycroft?" Mycroft smirked "Nothing brother, just thought I would properly introduce myself yo your soulmate Dr. Watson. Although I'm sure he remembers our first meeting." John looked between them, and shook his head. He should have known Sherlock would consider his brother to be his arch enemy. "Is that it?" Sherlock asked and Mycroft nodded, slinking away towards the crime scene. "Let's go home" John smiled, and they got a cab, hand in hand. Mycroft headed over to Greg as they walked off, giving him a quick peck before looking back at the two figures as they disappeared. "Their eyes match very well don't you think? Both just a little out of the ordinary. Like you and I." he smirked and Greg laughed. "Sherlock will hate that, love at first sight, a perfect match, so cliché." The thought had crossed Sherlock's mind, but he brushed it aside. It was John. Of course it was perfect.
He was standing out on the balcony alone, wishing he could leave and he'd only been at the party for half an hour. There were so many people there with secrets and betrayal plastered across their very shirt sleeves that his brain was on auto drive, and he wanted to focus a bit more. His experiment was going rather well, it seemed his conclusion that social situations are conducive to excessive alcohol consumption had been correct as he himself had definitely consumed more than he should have. Right now though he really really wanted a cigarette. No sooner had he thought this did a slightly older blonde man stroll out with a cigarette clenched between his fingers. He was 26 to Sherlock's 23 , studied medicine in the same college as Sherlock was himself studying. He came from a poor enough family and had been studying to support them by joining the army. That was interesting. The room was spinning a bit too much for him to get any more information.
He'd called Lestrade that first day under the pretence of needing help to write a speech. What he really needed was a reason, any reason at all not to pick up a needle again, and a witness was as good as any. John would have been disappointed if he had relapsed, but the void he had left in his wake was vast and all consuming, and anything that could numb everything for just a second would be a mercy. Could his feelings really have been hidden so well from John, or did he truly just not care at all for Sherlock? The way he felt, that he had allowed himself to feel, had meant going back on decades of conditioning and while a big part of him regretted that decision, he was so grateful for how it had made him appreciate every nuance of John, and finally shown him that love, while a dark and twisted vicious motivator that was slowly killing him, could also be a quiet light in the window of the flat at 3am, or a cup of tea gently nudged into his hand with a smile, a shared blanket while watching a movie, the comfortable points of contact between their thighs on the taxi journey home. He hadn't known that love could be a warm thing, a smile on his face as he went to bed each night and still there when he woke. He loved with as much focus and diligence as he worked, and he would love John until his wasted heart shriveled away, unwanted and unused in his own hand, waiting for John to look back and see it being given to him. Yes John, anything for you.
If anyone out there is still uncertain on how the soulmate mark works in our version, here's the basic idea: Everyone has a set of random/jumbled numbers on the inside of their arm. However the person's soulmate won't see this same sequence, instead they see their own birth date. So in this case, if Sherlock were to see his own mark, it'd say (e.g) "457221" but John, if he were to see Sherlock's arm, sees "070781" (yes I know the last 2 numbers are weird like that bc we're in the 21st century and date format blahblah but let's just ignore it yeah lol) instead. Thus, being the physician who was there when Sherlock was admitted at the start of our fic, it would be of no use to know Sherlock's birthdate to see if they are soulmates, because, he can't see Sherlock's date on his arm, he'll only just see a random sequence. Sherlock alone can verify the fact.
“Sherlock? Why are you standing in here in the dark?” Not exactly what he had been hoping to say, but it was something, a start. Sherlock didn't reply, tearing himself away from the door and into the room itself, hiding between sets of shelves so all but his outline was hidden from John. John stepped inside and closed the door behind himself, leaving the lights off.
at the theatre. Your father has always had good taste in coats so he thought that it would suit you very well. I know you love running around and doing that detective thing you do so the coat definitely lends you that air of mystery,” Mummy spoke, eyes sparkling in delight. Father on the other hand just nodded along, face pulled in a wide smile.
"We were friends at first, basic training makes you grow into a unit, it's kind of the point. You're brothers and sisters by the time you ship out. There was something about him that made me wary, but I thought nothing of it, I mean, we're trained to kill people. Sebastian was something else. Not that we realised at first..." John peetered out into silence, staring blankly at the wall opposite. A small cough from Lestrade and he was back, shaking his head to clear away the images collected there.
“If you put your hands in my hair, you can control to pace a bit better. I shouldn’t want to overwhelm you.” He did, a bit.
He hadn't really anticipated that Sherlock would be providing his costume because in Sherlock's words "I doubt you can emulate or create for that matter anything appropriate." He was used to it by now, the ridiculous whims of Sherlock Holmes were something he was secretly quite fond of. Eventually he had come to terms with even that, mainly because this party was going to be risqué to put it lightly and he honestly looked forward to seeing what ridiculously terrible outfits Sherlock would produce. He went back to watching Sherlock in the mirror as he laid a bag on John's bed and went straight back to his own, with a similar bag in his hands. John finished his teeth and almost ran to his room. He had not seen either costume and they were to be leaving in thirty minutes.
There was no such thing as a flawless system. People changed eventually; one moment you could be on cloud nine, basking in newfound love, and the next, dark secrets surface, threatening to rip couples apart. He may be clueless when it came to relationships, but Sherlock understood enough that even the most strong-willed of people have their respective breaking points.
Pushing past people in his race to get home, back to Sherlock and whatever it was that was pulling him so furiously across the city, John couldn’t decide what he was hoping to find when he got there. If Sherlock was in danger, and needed his help, that would be a bit Not Good, but if it was nothing and he was being completely insane, that wouldn’t be great either. Still, he couldn’t deny the relief he felt as he turned onto Baker Street.
Mycroft had been the biggest surprise of the affair (after A.G.R.A), when John asked for his help the man had seemed... relieved. Thrilled even behind his mask of company manners. John was unsurprised when he'd received the final word this morning that he was no longer married. It sickened him a little bit to find that such a relief. He had always considered himself a loyal man, but John was first to admit he'd made a bad decision putting that loyalty, that trust in Mary. He felt more badly for the way he'd treated Sherlock. Ignored and pushed away, hardly the treatment one gives their best friend, the person they love the most in the world. Still, he was home now and he was damned if he was leaving Sherlock again.
The hours passed in the morning with barely a twitch from Sherlock. Any food left by the bedside went untouched and any attempt at conversation by the nurses, ignored. “
that they're in here Mycroft? Because this seems a bit strange even for them." Greg said, holding his phone to his ear as he closed to door of his squad car.
"Well I'll be off, Mrs. Turner and I are going for tea" The old lady closed the door softly behind her. Sherlock tossed restlessly on the couch, he wasn't bored persé, but the extent to which that state would last was as of yet untested. John was probably the best distraction he had, and there was a slight chill in the flat, the two days of disuse had left it feeling empty. As John marched past with his mug,Sherlock grabbed it from his hands and stood it next to his own before dragging a befuddled John down to lie on the couch with him. "I'm pretty sure that we've discussed it, but in case you decided to delete it, you can actually ask me to come and lie with you or whatever, The chances of me saying no are less than two percent, the exception being when I have work. Just so you know." John's lips ghosted a smile against his neck. Sherlock's breathing hitched just slightly, even now the shock of small physical displays of affection that didn't have any motive behind them was immense. John's nose was against his neck now, breathing in the warm scent that was a devastating mixture of lemon, violin resin, cinnamon and just a hint of something purely his own. Calloused hands flittered across his jaw, his cheekbones, his lips. So warm. It was overwhelming at times for John, the fact that he could do this, that he was trusted enough too. Another excellent point for his John room, the fact that John would forgo anything else, just to be near him. No sex, nothing but soft kisses and whispers of skin on skin. It was beginning to dawn on them both. They might actually be in love with each other. Not that either would admit it to themselves, let alone the other.
Sherlock had spent the afternoon at Bart’s, and despite his buoyant mood when he’d come in (rustle of his scarf being whipped off at speed, sound of rummaging in the kitchen for his safety goggles, distinctive tinkle of bubbling Erlenmeyer flasks and pen scratching nigh on illegible notes), one look at John coming down the stairs and his face seemed to shutter off behind the clear plastic of his glasses.
The slideshow began with photos of both men as children: John in a little rugby kit (his first), Sherlock wearing goggles and a lab coat that was entirely too big, John on his father's shoulders, Sherlock scowling into a scientific journal, John mushing icecream into Harry's face, Sherlock smiling as Mycroft tied his tie for him. It went on in that fashion and people awwwwww'ed and laughed along with it, and Greg's occasional commentary too. The slideshow moved on through their lives: A preteen Sherlock beaming with his arms around a massive redsetter, A teenage John with his arm around a pretty girl and a twinkle in his eye, Sherlock fast asleep on a pile of books, John with a trophy raised above his head and his rugby team all around him, Sherlock carefully dissecting some sort of eye, John grinning through the sleeve of a jumper his mum had knit for him. Sherlock at twenty with a scowl on his face as he sat around for a Christmas picture, John wearing his army fatigues and hugging his parents goodbye, Sherlock looking gaunt through the crack in his door, John with his platoon, Sherlock at a crime scene with Greg at his side, John being awarded his service medals. John and Sherlock walking away from the cabbie case side by side, Sherlock in the deerstalker, Mrs Hudson with her arms around both men on her birthday, John at the pub with Greg, John laughing on the side of the road with his arm around Sherlock as the fire brigade extinguished the apartment, Molly and John frowning at Sherlock as he stares into a microscope, Several of the men in various restaurants, The pictures the police had circulated of them when they'd believed Sherlock was a criminal, Sherlock on horseback, Sherlock asleep on John's chest in the hospital, Christmas with Mummy Holmes, John pressing a kiss to a sleeping Sherlock's forehead, Walking down the street hand in hand, Drinking from graduated cylinders at the stag do, Mycroft, Greg and Sherlock laughing as they sprinted away with a blue French horn in their arms, Sherlock and John scribbling on each other's faces in sharpie, Sherlock glowering that very morning as a competent looking man messed with his hair, John, Molly and Greg with their heads thrown back in laughter and three exasperated hair dressers behind them, John standing at the altar looking nervous, Sherlock comforting his mother in the gazeebo, John winking at the priest, Sherlock walking down the aisle, John leaning in to whisper something to Sherlock with a beaming smile, their rings being slipped on, and finally Sherlock clinging for dear life onto John as he dipped him when they kissed.
Their lips met and John kissed him with all he was, every second of love he’d held back, with every look of adoration he’d ever hidden, and all the worship he felt for the man that had made life something worth living. It was tender and passionate and the collision of planets, suns exploding, worlds being brought into existence, and then Sherlock was sobbing, a guttural sound wrenched from his depths, and John was with him, tears of relief running down both of their faces. John wrapped Sherlock in his arms, laying out on top of him as Sherlock clutched him close.
did? Apparently it did matter, the major had lost all interest in John when he’d stumbled in, arm searing in unbearable agony, to find his destiny was lying dead on John's operating table. Ironically, Jack had only been two days younger than him.
Sherlock squeezed his hand and looked back at the shop front fading into the horizon, eyes clouding with memories. "He just wants people to be happy regardless of whom they find that happiness with. As long as both parties are truly happy he has nothing but good wishes for them." Sherlock listened to John tell stories of his family, nostalgia piqued by interacting with Edgar. Sherlock could only smile, because Edgar had never been wrong about him before, and now that he was confident of the response, he began to plan when he would propose to his beloved John.
Holmes stared out at the silence, wondering if this was the first instance in which he had appreciated a form of precipitation so thoroughly.
John beamed and took Harry's hand in his while Clara caught her lips. Gosh he'd been so worried that she wouldn't make it back from this but she actually looked ok, although he couldn't be sure because her charts were missing for some reason. "You are dear when you get out of this bed Harriet Watson, I can't believe you put me in that position! I had to call them because of the whole eggs issue and you promised you'd tell him! You're an utter idiot and I was
"We were to head of a raid, enemy compound that contained a lot off explosives and hostiles. Heavy fire, low visibility." John could hear the patter of rounds firing, shouts of Arabic rising and seething out over the dull thunk of the trigger. He wondered if Sherlock would hear it too, just by looking at him. "It took time, and we lost a few men on the field, but almost all of the freedom fighters had been either killed or disarmed and charged. The smoke was clearing slowly, and I stumbled into a building off to the side. When my vision cleared I made out three shapes in the collapsed heap that it was and advanced slowly. I needn't have bothered. It was Sebastian and two of our own. I was about to call out when he raised his gun and murdered them. Murdered them both. Our men. I snook out as quietly as I could and rounded everyone else up so they wouldn't be alone with him. Especially the wounded. I carried two men home over my shoulders that day so he wouldn't touch them." A small laugh escaped his lips, the peal had an unearthly quality to it, the empty room had not been host to much laughter of late.
Mycroft knew about the hideout, of course he did, but he always left Sherlock alone and never sought him out. He knew better than to offer comfort when Sherlock had already made it clear that he detested appearing weak to anyone but himself. Instead, Mycroft would watch over Sherlock from afar, and if need be, promptly (and appropriately) warn off whomever it was who had humiliated or upset his younger brother.
“Please.” Sherlock breathed into the space between them. “Please don't make me stay and watch this all play out.” His voice cracked, wavered, tore John's heart from his chest and trampled all over it.
Coffee with Harry had crept up on John until it was upon him and before he had time to breathe he was sitting in Starbucks with Sherlock at his side waiting for Harry to finish her shift. Sherlock breathed deeply and hummed, eyes flicking from person to person in the café. "We aren't exactly inconspicuous here John. I think she will see us before we see her" he drawled with a familiar smirk lighting his features. John raised an eyebrow, a question, a challenge, one Sherlock readily accepted. "The patrons of this establishment range in age from fifteen to twenty eight on average. Seventy three percent of those present are females who are here with a companion. All but seven of the men in this room are accompanied by a woman, which makes them, and by extension us, stick out in the crowd. The staff that are currently operating the till have only just begun their shift, their aprons and shirts, while dull in the extreme, are free from splashes or other stains while the waitress who served us ten minutes ago was a veritable explosion of spills and crumbs, meaning Harry had just gone to change when we arrived. Given the amount of time we have been sitting here I can tell you with some certainty that she will emerge in the next two minutes. The table you chose to sit at has a terrible view of the counter and the door beside it, but a lovely view of the park outside because you have been led by previous experience to expect that you will be forced to stare out of it when your sister acts in the usual way,that is to humiliate you with lewd and vulgar conversation, and probably berate one or both of us at some stage during what you and I both hope will be a brief meeting. The door however has a perfect angle at which to spot us as this table is the first one would see upon exiting it." Sherlock finished, clearly enunciating the final t. John's shoulders fell back into a more relaxed position and he chuckled, running the pads of his fingers lightly across Sherlock's cheek. "Brilliant" he grinned and Sherlock tried not to show the swell of pride that simple affirmation gave him.
"Wonderful. Well. One of us is going to have to get up and figure out a plan, and I'm guessing from your frankly disconcerting level of regular human brain skill at the minute, that person is going to be me so off you hop." John could feel Sherlock pout as he let him go, and rolled around so they were face to face to give him a quick kiss. "I'm glad you're pretty much okay, you glorious madman. I'm going to get us out of here, all right?" Sherlock grinned at him.
pick up. Which was why, laying in her private maternity room, with her contractions beginning to amp up in frequency, and listening to John's tinny voice apologize for not responding, citing case work or sleep or a certain detective stealing is phone for the fifth time, Mary wondered why she had ever thought the birth of their child would go any differently.
Much to his Sherlock's disappointment, John did not once check up on him the next day, nor the day after.
"Boys? They're in their own little world, what did I tell you Belle, they're always doing that at home. Some days I wonder if they're home at all!" Mrs Hudson laughed affectionately and repeated the question. "Well do you want a church wedding? Only we were thinking" Sherlock cut her off with a wave of his hand. "Mrs Hudson we trust both of your judgements implicitly in all matters pertaining to our wedding, whatever you decide will be perfectly adequate." Orabelle smirked and thanked the chef before setting into the steak that had been set before them so smoothly that John barely had time to register that anything had changed. "Thank you Sebastian, that will be all." The silent man nodded curtly and disappeared back into the kitchen. "He's one hell of a butler" John commented between mouthfuls, his steak was perfectly cooked to his tastes, medium rare and looking at Sherlock's which was well done he spared a wandering thought to how the mysterious butler had that information but dismissed it soon after.
What was he meant to say now, 'I briefly suspected you were a murderer but its fine because you clearly aren't?' Not exactly conducive to getting to know this odd creature a bit better. "I make this town and anything interesting that happens in it my business. Something happens I must know about it, that's the nature of my work."
That being said, evidently this day had more surprises in store than he'd originally anticipated, because despite only having left a short while ago, Doctor Watson was visible just outside the room, the slit of glass in the door showing the distinctive posture of a military man in shadow across the corridor.
As he leaned against the window, John took a moment to check on Sherlock, seated as he was in the passenger side because "Its no fault of mine that the only place in a car that will accommodate my femurs is the front." He was restless and twitchy, shifting constantly although the car was spacious enough. John shook his head fondly and snaked a call I used hand into silken curls, feeling the momentary tense before Sherlock's body relaxed totally back against his seat, pressing into his hand as if there was nothing more he could want in the world than their skin to be together.
The relieved smile on Mary's face was audible "Thanks Greg. Give them a bollicking about their phones from me while you're at it."
"Alright then. I'm glad to get to spend some time with you both although I dare say I feel as if I know you both very well already." She smiled wryly at both of them as Mycroft and Sherlock returned. Perfectly timed. In his head John was beginning to think he had underestimated the mother of two brilliant men. In some shape or form she must be exceptional. Dessert passed in brief spats of conversation but it was clear that Sherlock and Mycroft were curious as to what Mummy had said to John and Greg. "It's getting late, about time we retired I think." Mummy rose and gave a gentle bow to the table and left, stalking up the stairs and into her room. Sherlock also rose, but he simply gestured to John to follow and as always, he did.
"What?" Sherlock's breath stuttered when John's hands held him, like he was something that was to be cherished above all else. John's smile at his question was one of anticipation, and as his hands brought them face to face, Sherlock could see why.
"If it's any consolation My, he's seen most of it before." He might have deserved the pillow to the head that earned him Greg mused as he dodged said projectile with a playful grin and a kiss blown from him to Mycroft.
For quite some time he had attempted to rein these feeling in, after all, they were completely unlawful. However, as the months morphed into years and nothing had changed, or rather, the depth of his feeling had only grown exponentially, he had realised that self-flagellation was not only ineffective, but worthless.
Sherlock was left wondering what John would have done if he had chosen to come in. Would he have offered comfort? If so, just why would he want to do so? It was really quite obvious that Sherlock was not the kind to person to seek out another’s presence in times of distress. What made John think Sherlock would appreciate the concern?
It was dark, the real , true dark of a place uninhabited by people, lit by stars only when they reached the intricate metal gates that lead the way to the largest of the Holmes mansions. A towering monument to pre-victorian architectural style, the whole party were gratified to see lights still on, they were eagerly awaited. Like clockwork Sherlock's eyes fluttered open as soon as the engine stopped purring and he pushed himself up from John's lap and into alert wakefulness in minutes, time John was definitely willing to spend as the others alighted the car and the door opened. "Hello." John murmured at his sleepy detective when he himself had clambered out and held a hand into the car to lead him out too, and was pleased when he responded only with a langorous smile and an almost dainty use of the offered limb as he swept out into the cold air with the unfathomable grace he just possessed. "Come inside Sherlock, John, before we have two new additions to the ice sculptures tomorrow!" Orabelle Holmes called from the doorway, her voice carried to them by the wind as it swirled with flakes of ivory, hitting the already blanketed ground and Sherlock stood, hand still in John's, marvelling in the warm butterscotch of his gaze and John was happy to let him, he wasn't feeling the cold anyway, not when he was watching Sherlock's halo of snow form. In fact, they could have stayed that way, frozen together all night. "You are beautiful" John barely breathed it, and Sherlock's slight selfdeprecating smile, he fell just a little more in love with him. "Let's get you inside love, before you catch your death." Sherlock nodded once and John spun them round to go inside and was promptly startled by the gang of people standing staring at them from the sitting room windows. "They are rather sweet aren't they" Lucia/Anthea/Holly quipped, and Greg elbowed her with a laugh "you've gone soft Hols really, just a carebear in disguise" as he breathed on the glass and drew a little heart with his finger, pointing at the couple walking up the drive. Simultaneous two fingered salutes were the response, and even Mycroft had to laugh at that.
Sherlock finally finished his obligation dances and was searching for John when Mummy turned his face to show him the scene at the edge of the room. Just off the dancefloor, John was pacing up and down with a little boy tucked safely in his arms. Sherlock could tell he was singing and wondered what song it was. "He's a keeper if ever I saw one" she muttered into his ear. "I know." With that Sherlock sidled over to them.
It only took the consulting detective an impressive five hours to analyse all the evidence and provide Lestrade with the means to track down the victim’s jilted ex-husband, on the run with what remained of their combined trust fund and the entirety of the victim’s collection of rare diamonds. Said ex-husband was currently leading Sherlock in a wild goose chase down a beaten path weaving in and out of a series of buildings alongside River Thames, having been spotted by the latter whilst making his way to Waterloo Station that night.
John looked just as shocked as Molly had, and a bit more embarrassed than she had been. "I'm sorry what? What did you say?" Sherlock sighed. "I said, and I know you heard me, but I'll just clarify, that I was thinking about buggering you into the kitchen table. And perhaps the floor after, maybe the counter, every surface in the flat really." He was up now and strutting over to John who was frozen at the table, tea long forgotten. Sherlock ran his finger along John's jaw line, watching as John's pupils blew wider still as he shivered into the caress. "I often think about that, us. How you would scream my name for everyone to hear, and I
John blinked once, twice, three times, and Mycroft was gone. Shaking his head in an attempt to ward off the beginnings of a headache, he pushed open the door to Sherlock's room. Inching it closed, John approached the hospital bed and pulled the nearby chair to its bedside before settling down.
Only when they were both fully dressed again, though not in the clothes they had been wearing when they came in, did they speak, John's smile eager and reassuring at the same time.
The presents were exchanged right after amidst the clinking of wine glasses and wrapping paper strewn
The solution, though it drifted along the edges of his consciousness, remained elusive. There was, therefore, only one option: He would have to ask John outright.
It was true. He was in love with a madman who was obnoxious and socially inept and down right rude to most people, but not to him. To him he was brilliant and trusting, vulnerable and guarded, caring about so many people but labelling himself a sociopath to avoid the emotions that he'd have to face otherwise. Only a person of questionable sanity would even think of Sherlock as less than a lunatic with a death wish... "But he said danger and here I am" John snorted to himself. His sanity was questionable at best. He groaned into his hands. The conversation (well was it really a conversation? More a lecture in how much of an idiot he was) with Sarah had been two weeks ago and now he couldn't look Sherlock in the eye without thinking about it, and seeing as Sherlock observed everything avoidance was the only viable option. He'd started taking extra shifts at the clinic, night shifts too, just to stay away. It was lonely enough and he hated to admit the pang of longing that went through him when he thought about Sherlock at home alone. He brushed that aside quickly enough, Sherlock would barely have noticed he was gone most of the time. In fact now that he thought about it he'd gone for four entire days without once seeing the detective at all. It both impressed and saddened him that he was able to achieve this so easily.
How did you - Sherlock of course. If he can see it how can his brother not?! Or maybe he does and is sparing me a very awkward conversation. Still don't get what that has to do with anything -G
"Sherlock what are doing? Is that my jumper?" John had just come home from the clinic to find a lump on the couch, wrapped in a sheet and his favourite jumper. John hung his coat up and went to sit down in the armchair but a hand caught his wrist as he walked by. "Sherlock? Are you alright?" Sherlock rolled over to face John. He was shivering and even paler now than usual, his lips were a lilac colour that gave him an alien quality. "I believe that I may have subjected myself to hypothermia" Sherlock managed to get out through chattering teeth. John took his pulse and swore at the freezing temperature of his skin.
