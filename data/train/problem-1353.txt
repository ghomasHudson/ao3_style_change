He did not think Holmes had caught him looking. To mask his discomfort, Watson turned to him. "I should probably just borrow something of yours, shouldn't I? That is, if you'll let me dig around in that great old chest of yours. Are you sure you don't want to come? I thought it might appeal to you because of how much you like to put on disguises. There's no one quite like you for it."
Holmes rested his head on Watson's torso. He was never preoccupied with the messiness afterwards. Watson could only manage to run his hand, barely, over Holmes's shoulder, taking a few mild stabs at it. More and more since Holmes's declaration in the clearing that June afternoon, touch had taken the place of words between them.
"I say, Holmes. May I fetch something for you to look at?" Watson struggled to stand. When Holmes made to raise himself from his own chair, he was rewarded with a distinct glare from his fellow-lodger. At length Watson returned with a worn cloth satchel, which he dropped on the desk.
"Some trunks of mine have come from Portsmouth. I had given them up completely for lost," Watson replied. As he spoke, two deliverymen muscled the trunks into the room and set them down.
The rain pattered harder against the windows, and the flames of the hearth spit and flared. Watson watched, drawn as if by an invisible filament of his own, to where Holmes tied the first violin string and turned the peg to tighten it.
"The one with the dark hair and beautiful eyes." Watson stared at him. "The young lady you used to think about during the long marches in Afghanistan."
"Yes, of course I am...Let's see. Hand me your collar and where is the pin?" Watson dared not stir, feeling the brush of the back of Holmes's fingers against his neck as they performed their duties.
Holmes held utterly still. His hand was extended like a cardinal's accepting his vassalage. Moving as if in a dream, Watson unfastened the cuff of Holmes's shirt, tossing it aside, then drove the purple dressing gown and shirt sleeves upwards. He sighed at the pale expanse of forearm before him, the blue veins tangled there, the untouched flesh. Then he saw the bruise-coloured landscape lying further above.
Too many signs pointed to Emmeline St Martin as the murderer. The widow's evasiveness concerning her houseguest. Ronnie St Martin taking so much trouble to explain his sister to Watson. Miss St Martin's presence at the scene of the crime itself. Sherlock Holmes did not especially care for evidence spelled out in emphatic bold type.
Well, Holmes would survive without him. Watson was secretly glad of the respite, knowing that his friend would be gone for only a day, two at most. And Holmes had assured him he would send word of any unforeseen developments.
"John!" he cried, stopping as he took in Watson at the mantel, the ghost scent of smoke from the charred paper in the air. "You've been writing poetry, I see." He glanced at the fresh ashes in the hearth, and made a nod to himself as if to store these data away for future study.
“He had to work to keep both hands from trembling as I applied the sutures, and it occurred to me that he might be recovering from a bout of drinking. ‘Dr Watson, you fought in Afghanistan.'
There was no reply and Watson thought that perhaps Holmes had not been paying attention, so he dropped the subject.
Watson could feel his blood rise. Holmes went on the attack whenever an especially sensitive vein of feeling had been exposed, he knew. Well, he wasn't going to take it tonight. He was drained by the evening's events and had no reserves of patience left.
"Oh, it's nothing but rubbish, all of it. Why would I want these dusty things sitting about? I've a mind to have them taken away this very evening." With that, Watson stalked, if a convalescent man with a leg injury could be said to stalk, out of the room, down the stairs, and into Baker Street, grasping his cane as he went.
"Do? Why, my dear boy, use your powers to discover if this Raffles fellow is back in town, or whether we're dealing with an inspired imitator. Scotland Yard have been tripping over themselves to apprehend the perpetrator, but with an embarrassing lack of success. So the Queen's advisers resorted to the measure of asking me if I could enlist your services. I would have suggested that you begin by interrogating Raffles's erstwhile co-conspirator, Harry Manders, but he's dropped out of sight since his release from prison."
He exchanged one set of letters with Trevor after his friend settled in Nepal. The morphia allowed him to envisage every tea field, every mountain peak with a rush of silly gratitude. He might write to Trevor now. To learn what he could. About this fellow, Thompson, and the other one, St Martin.
Of late Sherlock Holmes had taken to categorising the sounds from the room upstairs. The barked orders. The one-sided conversations. The haunted moans. One evening they did not subside and Holmes was finally obliged to drop several pieces of scientific equipment on the floor to interrupt the terrible noise. Mrs Hudson had grumbled throughout the course of the next day as she dislodged the resulting shards of glass from the corners of Holmes's workroom, which adjoined the sitting room at Baker Street.
"Nothing at all. I tell you, Mr Holmes, these are seasoned criminals we're dealing with. I'm convinced that it was Raffles who stole Lady Melrose's diamond and sapphire necklace back in '91. Almost lost my life in that little adventure. Took a stab to the gut that well nigh finished me off."
Holmes paced the room, his hands clasped together under his nose. Watson set to loosening his necktie.
"Dammit, but the man's nerve is something to behold!" And Watson joined in with Holmes's contagious laughter, the sounds of it filling the room.
"An odd thing happened this morning. While you were out, I received a note from Ronnie St Martin, asking me to come to Hampstead." Watson entered the sitting room balancing a cup of tea in one hand and a tiny plate of cakes in another. Mrs Hudson was always acceding to the Doctor's entreaties.
"Miss St Martin? I'm Dr Watson and this is my colleague, Mr Sherlock Holmes. We have an appointment to see your father. Is he in?"
Watson saw the gleam in Holmes's eye that meant he would almost surely accept the case, even if it did come at the request of Mycroft Holmes.
How had that last line found its way in there? Holmes was right that the mind's brain-attic was filled with all kinds of articles jostling next to one another for space, including stray lines of Gilbert and Sullivan.
A distinctly unamused look was cast towards Holmes's armchair. "I come, although you might not believe it, on the errand of the Queen herself. I suppose you have heard of the affair of the Royal Gold Cup?"
Keats was supposed to have always bathed and dressed in his best clothes before sitting down to write a poem, and Watson made it a practice of his own when writing a first draft. It gave him courage for the endeavour and set all to rights.
Holmes mumbled something, but Watson could not be sure what it was. "What was that you said?" Never mind, Holmes was drifting at this point, so Watson tugged at the blanket that was bunched at his feet and arranged it around Holmes's shoulders as best he could, that his friend should not feel the damp that had crept into the room.
"How can you mock it so? It's a poem about the power of music, of devotion to music. Do you not revere your violin, and does it not render up its charms to you, whenever you have felt the music move within you? I know it to be the case, for I have witnessed it."
No, but if he didn't settle the two words now, he might throw the whole poem off and end up with a paltry facsimile of what he meant to communicate. Watson, keep going. If you're so caught up on the very first line, however are you going to make your way through all fourteen?
Holmes laughed to himself and rolled on to his back at Watson's side, his eyes closed, seeming to absorb the last of the delightful sensations that had passed between them.
Watson settled into his chair and wrapped himself in one of the shawls that Mrs Hudson had been kind enough to bring up for them. He let his eyes close while his friend paced back and forth. Although he no longer maintained a practice, he still had a few patients who refused to admit the fact and begged that he might attend on them. It was difficult to refuse Mrs Liddell, whose mother was ailing, and besides, they lived such a very short distance away, and he had ended up spending the entire afternoon in the humble house off the Paddington Street Gardens.
"Please sit down. I won't detain you for long. Could I trouble you to shut the door?" Watson did so.
His blood burned for this man. God forgive him, he wanted to seduce him. But not because his blood burned. Because of the sweetness in the notes, the sweetness within Sherlock. He felt the jolt of saying that name to himself. How many people in this world had ever called him by that name alone? He wanted that privilege. He suddenly wanted it more than anything.
Downstairs Watson took his writing box from its place next to the settee and sat down with it at Holmes's desk. He opened the box and folded down the writing panel, arranging his cigarette case and matches at his upper right. He had bought the desk with the proceeds from the first story he had sold to the
"I'd always been able to discard people when the convenient time came. Or send them packing. Or bar them from entering into my affairs in the first place. Before you came along. And you can't know the number of times that I've struggled with whether to take the morphia since you came back to Baker Street. I simply haven't learned again how to live with you so close by since I've returned to London. There's been the danger that you might decide you'd had enough of this quaint lark, after your years of living a more conventional life."
He proceeded to thread the second string–the E string, was it?–and again Watson saw how he drew it along the body of the violin until he arrived at the second peg, winding the string and pulling it tighter with each turn. Holmes pulling his hair by the roots, turning it tight with his fist, the flesh of lips grazing against each other, hips dragging, seeking purchase. He gave a little shake to dispel the betraying image, alarmed, and looked to Holmes. Had he seen anything? But he only continued to apply the strings, head bowed, engrossed in his task.
Could such a slip of a girl have killed a person? Physically wielded the heavy kitchen knife that Holmes had inspected that morning? Maxwell Thompson had not been a large man, but he would certainly have been more powerful than the sheltered Miss St Martin, who looked as if she could be carried off like a dandelion clock on a summer breeze. Had Miss St Martin feigned her distress that day at Gainsborough Gardens? What to make of the marks on her face? Holmes recalled how readily she had opened her thoughts to Watson. A doctor's bedside manner and all that. Had Watson uncovered a deeper vein of truth, or was the young woman's candour part of some elaborate ruse?
Better to content himself with an unanswered desire than risk a friendship so hard-won, even if that desire sent fevers through him far into the rain-soaked night.
Watson was sheepish. "Yes. These are just my initial jottings. Would you help me to think them through?"
"You've been avoiding eye contact with me over the past month," Holmes pronounced out of nowhere. "As at this very minute. Why is that? Shall I deduce it for you? Yes, I think I see it now. There's something that you're afraid you'll reveal if you engage in conversation with me, isn't there? Something you've been thinking about for rather a great while. Am I not right?"
Watson asked Holmes if he should like him to reciprocate, but Holmes shook his head. Instead he lowered himself again, resting his head on Watson's torso and nudging into his hand so that his hair might be stroked. Watson began to caress his scalp. From this angle Holmes was all bones, curled there, his eyes heavy-lidded.
"Oh, Inspector. What are you doing here? Is it about a case? Why didn't you mention it as soon as you arrived?"
"To the kitchen! Didn't Mrs Hudson say she was leaving food for us while she was away?" Ah, yes. The day before their venerable landlady had launched into a condemnation of the fact that there was currently no housemaid to look after things while she went on a visit to her sister, and was it any wonder that they couldn't keep staff at 221B, what with the comings and goings that occurred at every hour, worse than it had ever been before Mr Holmes went away. Suits caked with Thames mud, and boots that had stepped in God knows what unsavoury substances. And that inspector who drank far too much of Mr Holmes's brandy for her liking.
Concentration had almost deserted him now. The words on the paper seemed far below him, cuneiform scratches of black on white, their meaning fading.
Holmes stepped out of the shadows and moved towards the sitting room, but paused when he caught a glimpse of St Martin's face. It was that of a man who was shattered beyond repair.
John St Martin looked up in mock surprise. "Have I visitors?" Ronnie ducked his head and introduced the men, discreetly retrieving the signed papers from his father's desk.
Watson cast his eyes over the bookshelves, then to the desk and the far window beyond it, but Holmes's work drew him back. Again the strings were threaded, again the pegs were turned and tightened, again the images of hair and lips and legs came over him.
"Ah, how lovely, Dr Watson! Ever the gentleman, you are. Now, if you won't be needing anything else, I'll be retiring for the evening. Mr Holmes, I'll just ask Lucy to attend to the fire in your chamber. A terrible chill has set in, hasn't it? Dr Watson, will you be wanting one as well? A fire, I mean. No? Well, then I'll leave you here to your tea. You'll have to raid the larder yourselves if you should want anything else. Don't leave it in complete disarray!" And with that their landlady departed down the stairs.
"But her persisted in his theme, set on clearing his sister's name. 'My sister is well-meaning, but she often gets carried away by her own fancies. She's been that way ever since she was a child,' he told me, eager for me to believe him.
"Listen to this, Watson! 'Till joy denies itself again, And, too intense, is turn'd to pain.' What is that supposed to mean? Or this: 'When you die, the silent Moon, In her interlunar swoon, Is not sadder in her cell, Than deserted Ariel.' Pah." And he tossed the volume into the corner behind his chair.
"A scrapbook. In it I gather all the material I've accumulated about a case in the course of solving it. I store the most essential information in my brain-attic, but these volumes are a complement to that. Occasionally I'll pull one down from its shelf and study it, reconstructing the case step by step. The process can be rather useful when I've reached an impasse on another problem. It calms the mind and gives perspective."
Watson was directing words to him, but the wind shredded them and flung them into the salt air. Holmes bent into the cold, striding to catch up with the man who paced ahead of him.
Watson groaned. The day had begun cold and rainy. A whistling draught slipped in through the gap between the window and the sill and sent him burrowing deeper beneath the covers.
"'I attempted to turn his mind from the morbid topic of our conversation. 'Fantastical ideas can accost you out there, when you're far away and missing the familiar customs of home, or tired from a long day's march. You must never think too much on any of it. —And how does that feel, now? It's best if it's bound tight like so. If it gives you any more trouble, you can always stop by Baker Street.'
"But Thompson—he let himself get caught up with some rather debauched characters. You wouldn't have believed it, to look at him."
Until he had felt Trevor's body next to him, closer than expected. Closer than he had felt any man's body. His breath stopped. He could hear the effort it cost Trevor to contain his own respiration, and wondered at it. Trevor closed the gap between them. It was a suffocating sensation, linen jacket rucked up awkwardly under Trevor's back, linen trouser legs crushing blades of grass heavy with dew, secret and concealed in the darkness. Frogs sang in the river below. Startled, Holmes turned to face his friend and his cheek brushed inadvertently against the other's lips. He scrambled, ungainly, propelling himself upwards, as if pulled by a string, striding, running towards the house in the distance, its banks of windows ablaze. Trevor made no attempt to follow Holmes. The next morning he did not come down for breakfast and Holmes left on the noon train to London, the wind ruffling his dark curls.
"The Terai is a remote region, Mr Holmes. And letters and telegrams arrive inconsistently, if at all."
"Yes, by the police at Poole directly after the body was located." Lestrade shook his head. "They didn't make much headway. She was quite distressed, as you can imagine. The inspector with jurisdiction over the investigation asks if you might be able to pay her a visit. Mrs Thompson has returned to London. Would you be willing to speak with her? I know your time is valuable."
"We've attached a police detail to the Hampstead house until we can locate the father. And I understand that their mother's family has stepped forward to assist."
Holmes cocked his head, eying Watson. "Share memories of the homeland with him while I whisk myself away to pursue a promising clue? Wax nostalgic about 'Ye banks and braes o' bonnie Doon'? Fight the Rebellion of '45 over again?" Holmes looked back and forth between his brother and his friend, measuring them. "Well. I'm powerless when the two of you join in league with each other. I suppose I'll accept the case for now."
Restless, Holmes picked up one of Watson's rhyming dictionaries that lay nearby and glanced through it, his attention suddenly diverted. He rattled off one of the first entries as if it were a patter song.
Suddenly he sprang up. "No, but really, John. We must be getting a move on. Come on, I'll help you gather your things."
Watson felt rather self-conscious but he acquiesced, examining the interior of the costumer's beyond the gold lettering on the window that proclaimed the proprietor's name. He could see tall shelves that mounted up one side, while on the other the proprietor himself was waiting on a young man and woman.
"You were too eager for the evidence to fall into certain patterns rather than considering it dispassionately, and letting the facts guide you."
"Not a night to be out in at all, and bless those souls who are," Watson said and threw more coal on the fire that he had laid a short while since.
Holmes rose to his feet, turning this way and that as he played snatches and passages of works he had performed before, but he did not appear to be immediately pleased with the sound the violin produced. He waited a bit, then played the instrument again, and did this several times more until he was satisfied that the tone held true.
"Too bashful to eat in front of the lovely Bacon the Butcher and the corpse purveyors?" Watson cast a nod at the portraits that watched over them.
"He never was able to take care of himself properly, was he? When you lived here before, he came to depend on you such a great deal. Even though he never did like to show it. Imagine those two months, then, Dr Watson," she rattled on, "while you were deciding if you would return to Baker Street. They were an agony for him. I've never seen him so full of nerves. He thought you would say no to the idea."
"Mr Holmes," St Martin cocked his head. "Are you trying to cast doubt on my whereabouts at the time of Mr Thompson's death? Ronnie, after we've finished here, will you show the detective the letters I sent Mr Thompson during this last journey of mine?"
"You had better get on with it, then. Your story about the St Martins. I look forward to reading it. With the names changed to protect the innocent, of course." He flushed unaccountably as he settled himself in his armchair, while Watson went in search of tea. Mrs Hudson knew how to lay the best fires. This one crackled low and sure. He stretched out his long legs like a self-satisfied cat. Then he sobered. Here in this chair had sat Ronnie St Martin, slowly breaking apart as he confessed the darkest secrets that a family could hold. There in that chair had sat Watson, revealing the harrowing burden of his nightmares. It was a curious conflation. Holmes was standing and watching St Martin, and at the same time sitting and seeing the room from St Martin's vantage. He was sitting and listening to Watson, and at the same time seeing the dusty battlefield of Maiwand as his friend must have encountered it. It was as if a slight shift of angle allowed him to step back and forth between these states. As if he could feel the courageous hearts of the two men beating within his own frame.
"Why are you taking your black one? You said it was a case of embezzlement, merely one step up from a bank audit, and that there was no possibility of physical harm."
Watson took another bite from a leg of duck. "Did you never plunder the larder as a child? With your brother? And steal back up to your room with the food?"
Holmes considered. "No. Only to the ones who provide me with regular physical aid." He patted the ground between where their bodies lay stretched. "No, but come, John. It's time to go or we shall never catch our train back to town."
Then there were the nights in which there were no moans, but only a restless pacing across the floorboards. Holmes would count the steps in these midnight ghost marches. It helped to pass the interminable hours after an experiment failed or when his mood collapsed without warning.
"'Betray, decay, defray, delay, disarray.' The continual state of Lestrade and his men. 'Display, dismay, essay, forelay, gainsay, inlay, relay, repay, roundelay, virelay.' Do you know that last?"
"If you must know, Emmeline St Martin is a troubled girl. Her health has been delicate, so I urged her to join me in Dorset. There was no one else to care for her properly. There never has been. Now will you go?"
Watson reflected. "Perhaps you're right. Perhaps I did make one. In Afghanistan. But as to its exact nature— There were too many hours to think on such things while I was in hospital."
"'Bray, clay, day, dray, tray, flay, fray, gay, hay, jay, lay, may, nay, pay.' What you're always asking our clients to do. 'Play, ray, say, way, pray, spray, slay, stay, stray, sway, tway. Fay, affray.' We've been in one or two of those, haven't we, Watson? 'Allay, array, astray, away, belay, bewray.' Bewray?"
"I'm not suggesting anything. I'm still mourning the passing of a dear colleague and friend. Now, if you don't mind, I must depart for another engagement. Do you have any other questions for me, Mr Holmes?"
He and Holmes had taken refuge against a nearby shop-front. The shop's window contained various wigs, hats, an assortment of swords and daggers, a plum-coloured doublet that had seen better days, and what appeared to be a bandolier draped over an American-style saddle, all artfully arranged.
Mrs Thompson's face took on a mulish aspect. "Emmeline was in a fragile state and I believed she would benefit from the sea air."
"Here you are, Mr Holmes, your milk as you like it. Dr Watson?" Mrs Hudson handed him his cup of tea. "Where were you this time? I know how you run around, through those awful docks and dark streets and it's a wonder you've never taken a bad beating, if I may say so." They were far past the point at which Mrs Hudson restrained her opinions before the two men when clients were not present.
"Ah, Thompson. It flattened me, when I stepped off the train in London and learned the news. I was shocked, too, to learn of the ill-conceived transactions that he had been conducting independently. Unbeknownst to me, that is."
Before Watson knew what he was about, Holmes was making his way down the lane towards the village. He stood dumbfounded. Then Holmes tossed Watson's hat high into the air and Watson scrambled after him to catch it before it fell in the dust.
It seemed as if Holmes could hardly bear to remain in his chair, as if he were shrinking from being exposed while humiliated by a need to be seen. He made to serve himself some more tea, rattling the cups and other things in the process.
"And so what would you like us to do about it?" Holmes asked his brother while glancing at Watson, the makings of a smile forming on his lips.
Holmes lit a cigarette and sat back in his chair, pretending that he had not relented a little. "I suppose so. What do you have?"
"I'm John St Martin," he announced, without standing to shake hands. He was in his early fifties, possessed of fair hair and good looks, a faint smile of amusement on his lips. He had an air of great vitality about him, as if he could have hunted a lion before breakfast. He turned his particular attention now on Holmes.
He travelled with steady kisses up the skin. A sharp male flavour waited in the crook of the elbow, hiding among the scars. He spent his time there, sucking, inhaling the darkness, as if extracting a venom. The heavy folds of the gown spilled around the crown of his head.
Inspector MacKenzie pursed his lips. "There's an uncle that we questioned. But he's washed his hands of his nephew and hasn't seen him since May."
"The same kind of biscuit tin in which he sent the Royal Gold Cup to the Queen,” Holmes purred. A deep laugh began to roll forth from him, the kind he rarely indulged in but that was joyous to hear.
Holmes looked up. "Oh, are you there?" He took in Watson's dressing gown, his bare ankles and leather slippers. He could not help noticing how the bones in Watson's feet stood out in relief against the sunken, too-pale skin.
He realised that he had not felt the desire to write a poem since before Mary's passing. Before Holmes went away. Perhaps this newly-returned impulse had something to do with how happy he was these days. It was palpable, like a pulse, a beat within his veins, a surging feeling that might be tenderness or gratitude.
Sherlock Holmes stood at his worktable, arranging beakers and flasks. Watson sat in his armchair reading before the fire.
Holmes set the two cups of tea on the desk and sat down, hearing the door open above. Candlelight wavered on the landing. Tap thump, tap thump once again, this time down the stairs. He composed his face into a bland expression, immersing himself in his task.
Watson narrowed his eyes, shaking his head. "You're incorrigible, you know." Holmes responded with the makings of a  wry grin. The day beckoned them forward. To puzzles and fires and perhaps, if the weather granted it, a walk later in the brisk air of a London afternoon.
The afternoon had turned lazy at some point, and they had indulged in kisses that became increasingly languorous. Holmes had initiated them and Watson tried to make sense of this change. Holmes had been a willing enough participant in their new arrangement, which had begun during last November's abbreviated days and lengthening nights. But until now, he had deferred to Watson in all things amatory. What was he witnessing here?
"Pshaw," replied Holmes. "A little light diversion is all." But he had already pulled out his box of files labelled "R" and was flicking his way through the documents stored there.
The sky huddled close over the horizon, heavy with more rain. All was grey, above and below. The biting cold of winter muffled the sound of the sound of the surf where Holmes stood. He settled his cap lower on his head.
"And what of Harry 'Bunny' Manders? Have you any sense of where he went after his release from Wormwood Scrubs?"
MacKenzie wore a sour expression. He was a man of sharp temperament, prone to sudden flares of anger. "They asked for the way to the Prehistoric Saloon, but that's the last that was seen of them. They must have blended into the crowd afterwards and from there taken a cab."
"I don't know," she said in resignation. "I've kept my distance from him in recent years except where his children were concerned."
"Look at you, in your state of abandon. Do I need to make you presentable for polite society?" he said, throwing the clothing in a pile on the ground next to them and carelessly beginning to put himself to rights. He sat down on his heels before Watson. "Hmm," he clucked. "This shirt is all askew. We shall have to remedy that."
The only problem with such a lofty ambition was the instrument to hand. Watson knew he was a poet manqué and had accepted the fact years ago. He would never possess that quality that the true poet was endowed with, the ability to weave everyday words like sun or bird or plane tree into something that pierced the heart. But the urge to compose a poem would come upon him occasionally and he would honour it, ever hopeful that this time the Muse would bless him with her inspiration.
"John, I very much appreciate your solicitude for my brain, but it's safely ensconced within my skull and needs no protection from the elements."
Holmes's candle sputtered. He had stumbled into strange territory. "While in hospital. Yes. I mean. Well— " He furrowed his brow, fixing his eyes on the pages of the scrapbook. "This fellow stacked his cadavers very inefficiently. He would have done better to have stood them on end instead of laying them down flat, as he did. He had only a tiny kitchen in which to store them, after all."
"Friends. And luck ..." St Martin murmured to himself. "She told me. Do you know what she told me the morning after she threw herself from her bedroom window?" He stared into the middle distance, trying to pin down the memory. "She was tucked into her bed so that I couldn't see her damaged limbs. I was afraid to look at her because I could sense that her face, that beautiful dear face, was bandaged across one cheek. Her eyes were filled with tears, they brimmed with them but did not fall.
"Inspector Belton said that he was not allowed to interview Miss St Martin the morning when he spoke with you in Dorset. Why was that?"
"It came with the eight o'clock post, sir." She presented a parcel wrapped in brown paper and tied with string, addressed to Mister Sherlock Holmes.
The price one paid for experiencing desire was to have uncertainties–small contorted beasts that delighted in inflicting their pangs of doubt–crowd into one's heart. Rather like Pandora's box, but in reverse, Watson thought. Why, my friend, why did you leave and never let me know you were alive?
"We've gone over every one of our procedures, interviewed all of our men, and can't find any loophole through which John St Martin might have escaped. The Commissioner is meeting with the Foreign Office about it later today, since we have reason to suspect that he may have fled abroad. Rest assured we shall find him," Lestrade said glumly, without much hope that this valiant assertion would in fact manifest as fact.
Watson thought it best to forgo words. Instead he reached an arm from beneath the covers and brushed away the hair that had fallen across Holmes's forehead. The grey eyes that looked up at the ceiling had indeed traveled far back in time.
He drew a fresh sheet of paper and chose his oldest pen. A sonnet then. He had heard it likened to a little box, the sonnet. With its strict form that the poet sought to transcend. It suited Holmes, he thought. It's what he did, after all, in solving his cases–worked within the rigid structure of the facts to arrive at the truth that surpassed them.
Holmes desired nothing more than to scrabble his way out of the room. How was he to respond to such a disclosure? Despite his panic, he resolved to let the moment hover and come to rest, without rushing to draw it to a conclusion. The next step was somehow inevitable. He thrust out his hand. "We spoke of bargains not long ago. You remember. What do you say to a bargain of our own? You'll accompany me on my—our—future cases, providing any assistance required, and in exchange you're free to write them up however you like. Would that suit you?"
Watson smiled with an effort. He did not see how he could bear this situation for much longer. But he must do it, because it was clear that Holmes–. Sherlock–. Sherlock Holmes–. Was not prepared–. Did not–. Was not, nor ever would be, inclined to meet him where he longed to go. He chastised himself most bitterly for his self-deception. He had let himself believe that Holmes's time away would have wrought a change in his heart. Not as much as it had altered Watson, because, well–. But a little.
"A collection of tics and tricks? Of cleverly elaborated prestidigitations? You surely must have tired of those long ago. I blow hot and cold, you know. When I'm pinned down is when I most want to be away. I take more than I give. And I can't promise that I'll change any of these things. Really, Watson, who wants to bother themselves with such an inconvenient sort of person?"
Watson paused. Mycroft Holmes putting in an appearance at Baker Street? Something extraordinary must have occurred. They heard the front door open, Mycroft's voice in the hall, Mrs Hudson's in response. Holmes turned from the window, his expression perfectly bland, as his brother entered the sitting room.
"Emmeline!" A man, almost certainly Miss St Martin's brother by the looks of him, stood at the door. How long had he been there? "Mr Holmes. I'm Ronnie St Martin."
Holmes gave Watson a quizzical smile. It was perhaps his fellow-lodger's most winning quality—his self-deprecation without a trace of false modesty.
"You were the one who found me, I should say. Up, up." Watson had risen and he threw Holmes his dressing gown. Holmes's eyes were still bleak, but they sought out the warmth in Watson's own.
Watson cast him a doubtful glance but accepted the proffered cup, and they fell into a polite silence.
"Inspector MacKenzie, tell me about the post office from which the parcel was sent to Buckingham Palace."
Holmes read poetry himself. Sometimes. He admired the ancients, but had a very eclectic knowledge of them, having been tutored at home, Watson later discovered, rather than sent away to school. And he tolerated the Elizabethans and Pope, but had no patience at all for the heartfelt yearnings of the Romantic poets. Shelley had been the recipient of Holmes's special scorn.
The line of his colleague's shoulders in his mackintosh against the grey sky. He was beginning to fill out his garments and he no longer carried his cane. As if following the arc of Holmes's thoughts, Watson turned to him. Yes, with the Hope case and now this one, the doctor was doing more than merely tagging along. He would never be Holmes's equal, certainly, but Holmes had to admit that Watson noticed things that exceeded his own powers of observation.
"How do you do, Doctor? Sherlock?" Mycroft Holmes inspected the settee before taking a seat on it. "May I?"
"I suppose you'll want tea. Mrs Hudson?" Holmes glanced at the landlady who hovered at the door, bidding her to prepare it for their visitor.
"I suppose it's a facile thing to say," Watson began. "Yes, a facile thing. But life. Your life. It's valuable. I hope you recognise that."
"Because I don't play rugby any longer. And the days are long past when I could eat whatever I liked!"
"The greatest slow bowler of his generation. But wasn't he supposed to have drowned or flung himself into the sea off the coast of Italy a few years ago?" inquired Watson, hurrying over Holmes's pause.
"No, I don't imagine so," Lestrade agreed. "Well, I must be on my way to Scotland Yard. I'll be sure to alert you to any new information we find regarding St Martin's whereabouts. My thanks for your help with this case. To both of you." Lestrade nodded pointedly at Watson as he bid farewell.
He smiled at Watson. No, there was no archness there. He hadn't guessed. "I'll play one of your favourites. The Gypsy Airs."
"The currant jelly was my favourite. My grandmother wouldn't let anyone else make it. She was very proprietary about it. As for tea, I had a particular weakness for lemon pudding."
The lamp on Holmes's desk sputtered out with a hiss, and Watson did not rise to relight it, content to let the flames of the fire, now grown strong, illuminate the room on their own.
Miss St Martin picked up a kind of straw circlet that sat on the side table next to her. She began to finger its adornments, which were woven in the shapes of small acorns and leaves. "I threw myself from a second-storey window. I've returned home now."
," Holmes intoned, closing his eyes for greater effect as he pronounced the words. He opened them to see Watson regarding him with a wary expression. "No, no," Holmes laughed. "Did you think I was referring to you? I meant my own wretched self, of course. Didn't you know that? Here. I shall I show you what I'm working on. I don't think you've seen one of these yet."
After the Inspector left, Holmes crossed the room to where Watson sat on the sofa amid his newfound belongings. "Quite a haul you acquired out East," he said, wondering what had become of the letter. "Where do you intend to put everything?" But Watson looked up with what could almost be described as a tormented expression, more diminished than Holmes had seen him since the first days of their acquaintance.
"The cricket player and so-called 'amateur cracksman'?" Holmes asked. "Yes, I do seem to recall his name. Although I'm not as familiar with his exploits as I might otherwise be due to the fact that they happened while I was–away."
The man and woman were obviously teasing each other. He could hear their laughter rise as they tried on hats adorned with extravagant plumes and buckles, each more outlandish than the other. The shop owner handed the man a cape lined with pink satin and he twirled it around himself, playing the villain, as he pretended to bear down on the wide-eyed lady in distress. Watson thought that the two must be a couple in love, there flowed such an easy affection between them. A faint smile formed on his lips.
Watson peered again into the shop. The evening had descended several registers towards dusk, and the inside glowed warm and inviting. There were hardly any people on the street now, and the evening grew close around him and Holmes, who stood at his side, fidgeting with his gloves.
"Beginning when I was twelve—Emmeline was ten—he used to order me to his room, where he would—receive his lady companions." St Martin's face burned. "He made me sing for them, clad only in my undergarments. I protested, but he threatened to harm my sister if I didn't carry out his schemes to the letter. It was a bargain I had to make."
“He agreed and I was soon out of the house, and glad of it, too. A storm was coming on, the trees were thrashing about, and I walked down the hill towards the high street, never wanting to look back.”
"There was certainly no love lost between them. The relationship between them had been deteriorating for some time. It was a simmering sort of resentment that John held towards Max." Mrs Thompson remained resolute, but her mouth faltered. "Anyway, John was in Nepal when it happened."
The last, or most, of autumn had fallen away and the trees stood in their stark outlines, the rain coating the trunks and branches black.
Baker Street settled a little more snugly on its foundations with Holmes there. The long summer evening cast its light across Holmes's face and he broke into his most comfortable smile. Then he turned, shrugging off his coat as he headed for his room, and the suspended instant vanished, like words into fire and air.
"Please allow me to dispense with the niceties. You worked with the late Mr Thompson for many years. Can you tell me about the business you conducted together?"
"You keep me in the dark about quite a lot of things and I've learnt to accept it. Do I have to share with you every thought that passes through my own mind? And, besides. I don't think I've changed my behaviour in any particularly noticeable way."
"Good afternoon, Dr Watson. This just came for you." Lestrade, entering the room, handed a crumpled waybill to Watson, who went to see what was afoot. The inspector then turned to the source of the odour of shag tobacco that pervaded the room. Holmes was observing with rapt attention the smoke that issued from his pipe as it made its way towards the ceiling.
"Anything, really. Tell me a story. About where you used to explore as a boy. What games you played at." A thought brightened Holmes's face. "Did your mother ever make you tea?" he asked.
"The Royal Gold Cup is a rather striking object," Watson pointed out. "You're saying that no one noticed either of the two men, one of whom would have had to carry it under his arm? After all, it wasn't wintertime, with visitors walking around in overcoats."
"Well, yes, that's true," Mrs Hudson replied. "Who else is supposed to look after you and keep up with your whereabouts? You without kith or kin. Except for the elder Mr Holmes." But Holmes had gone back to his thoughts. Watson could tell that he was retracing their steps, assessing what they could have done differently to prevent the murder of the poor chandler's girl.
The string and paper fell away to reveal a biscuit box with the words "Huntley & Palmers" printed on it.
Watson rose and stood before St Martin, who sat hopelessly hunched in the chair. He put an arm around him, wrapping him in tweed and normality. "You were a company of one man. Against a foe who held the securest of positions. There was nothing else you could have done. We always ask ourselves afterwards if we lacked courage. If we could have done things differently. But that way lies madness." Holmes heard the snuffling of St Martin's tears and wondered how Watson could allow himself to be soiled with them. Holmes turned away, but could not block out the humiliating sound. Watson continued to comfort the man, and Holmes was struck by how broken Watson himself must be to say the words he had uttered. He could not stand there hiding in the dark. He must rouse himself and confront the matter. Send for Lestrade. Cross-examine John St Martin. Document and record. Place it all neatly in a new scrapbook.
Someone was asking him a question, standing above him where he lay in the depths of the old sofa. The voice pulled him up, confusing, confused. Curtains were pulled back. Confound the hand that opened them and the unbearable light that they admitted. The voice, disillusionment in it. Well, one mustn't expect anything of Sherlock Holmes, he said defiantly (to himself?). Night skies, night skies, galaxies and constellations to be charted, he thought before he drifted off again.
"Holmes. Listen to me. What did you think I was in this for? The fun of the deductions? The demand for the stories? You know I write them up because–well, they bring in a steady supply of clients for you and the world needs to know about your work and I rather enjoy the scribbling thing. But what you are–? Who you are–? I would burn every one of the tales, every last page of my notes, to ashes if I could make you see that the man behind them is so much more than any of that.
"Come in." Watson stole a glance at Holmes in his work area. Holmes nodded to him, motioning him to receive the visitor while he slipped into the shadows against the wall. "Dark and chilly on this December afternoon. I'm afraid Mr Holmes is out. Shall I take a look at your hand?"
Ah, Sunday morning. Watson lay in his bed, nestled in the comfort of the newly laundered sheets, listening to the birdsong outside his window and the rustle of the leaves of the plane tree in the garden behind the house. The summer air entered the room, fresh and sweet. He felt an enormous contentment at being alive.
"I visited quickly, stayed not even a day. Just to ... carry out Father's command. But I had to tell someone afterwards. God, how I had to tell someone. I didn't know if I could confide in Emmie. She was so fragile, and could she keep a secret? Little did I know how well she could. I told her what I had done, and why. She hugged me close and began to shake all over, powerless to stop. And it was then ... God, oh God forgive me! I always knew but I never wanted to know. It was written upon her face, her figure. I see that now. Should I have demanded an answer of Father? Should I have demanded an answer of him?" St Martin pleaded.
in consecutive lines. He shook his head and rang the bell to request of Mrs Hudson a pot of coffee. He took up the Palgrave's and began to leaf through it to find inspiration in his old favourites, the ones his mother used to read him. He saw her fair hair bent over the pages and his heart twisted fondly at the memory. There were all the Burns poems, but especially
Watson puffed on a cigar. "No need to worry, Mrs Hudson, I assure you," he offered, since Holmes sat in a brown study. "We spent most of the evening filing the necessary papers at Scotland Yard. Although: How did you know that we were at the docks?"
Then he leapt up, offering his hand. He gave a shy smile, and Watson wondered if he could be any more besotted than he already was.
"'Did you ever visit the Buddhas of Bamiyan?' he asked, his face momentarily alight. 'I remember as a child imagining the great figures come to life and stepping out of their giant alcoves.'
"Well?" asked Watson, after the door downstairs had closed. "This sounds like it'll be rather good fun."
"Victor Trevor. A classmate of mine at university. Have you never met him? He left for the region shortly after taking his degree at Oxford several years ago. I would have thought the tea planters of the Terai would be a close-knit family."
"I should have already learned that there's no use in arguing a point with you when your mind's made up."
"Bedrooms aren't for thinking. Besides, anyone would be cold with their tenderest bits exposed like that. Go close the window and come back under here."
"I'm not implying anything at all. I'm stating that you're attempting to change the subject in an altogether obvious way."
Lestrade gave a long-suffering sigh and began to recite the details. "Mr Maxwell Thompson, a tea importer by trade, was found dead last week on the coast of Dorset near Poole."
Now fortified with the pot of coffee that Mrs Hudson had brought him, Watson returned to his labours. His thoughts slipped into the rhythm of the clock pendulum that ticked back and forth in the arc of the late-morning sun.
Back in Holmes's room, the plates and dishes balanced precariously on little mounds of the mattress, the blankets pushed to the edge. Watson sat tailor fashion, not bothering to cover himself with the folds of the dressing gown he had commandeered. Holmes propped himself up on an elbow. They had thrown more coal on the fire and it sputtered and snapped with a will of its own.
"If you'll be so good as to answer the questions, Mrs Thompson, we'll depart at the earliest instant. Now, for how long had your husband and John St Martin been partners?" Holmes asked. Beside him, Watson smoothed the open page of his notebook, attempting to conceal his aching leg with its pages.
"A kitchen knife that was encountered partially buried in the sand. It seems that it was tossed into the sea and later washed onto the shore."
"Well, Inspector, we shall see what can be done with the evidence we have before us. You'll wire me if anything comes to light."
"Are you going to get up to close the window or will I need to?" Watson asked, his face buried in his pillow.
Ronnie St Martin hurried down a hall that overlooked the orderly green expanse of Gainsborough Gardens. Tall, slight, he seemed like a person who was permanently askew despite his best efforts to impose order. He was rattling on to Watson about something to do with the weather.
Watson found his slippers, stepping into them. In these past months, he had lost all self-consciousness before the faded portraits of criminals that wavered in and out of the shadows on the walls. He opened the wardrobe, and turned to Holmes with raised eyebrows. Holmes nodded and Watson plucked out the crimson dressing gown, mischief creasing the corners of his eyes.
After finishing with the morning's toilet, freshly shaven and in his navy suit, Watson paused before the small bookshelf he kept in his room, the one reserved for the volumes of poetry to which he turned most often. He thumbed through their well-worn pages with an eye to what he would take with him to the sitting room: Palgrave's, of course. The Hood rhyming dictionary. The Trench anthology, not as good as Palgrave's, but still a substantial volume. The Brewer book on writing poetry. Shakespeare, certainly.
"I shall have to speak with Lestrade about Hopkins' methods tonight. Very shabby of him to not allow the other men–" Suddenly he veered, "She's right, you know." Holmes studies the nails of his hands with acute concentration. "It was difficult. More than difficult–" he conceded. "That time, waiting. Not knowing what your response would be–."
How eagerly had Holmes read Watson's tales while he was away, seeking to hide his trembling hand even from himself as he opened the latest packet sent to him by his brother Mycroft and found a new edition of the
"I feared that he would beat her. At least, that's what I fooled myself into believing." St Martin snorted with contempt. "Father must have been contemplating Maxwell Thompson's death for a long time. And when Emmeline—when she tried to take her own life, he saw his opportunity. She was sent to the Thompsons to be out of the way of gossip. Mrs Thompson always felt a great sense of responsibility for Emmie.
"You're right! I do notice a thing or two, and I've learned to do so from the very best. Good God, man, I've observed you more closely than ever you did a trail of clues! I know who you really are."
"Tsk, tsk. It's much too late an hour to be dashing about. Neither of you is as young as you used to be.
"Your cup could have been hidden away within either of the gentlemen's hats. Look up its dimensions, if you doubt it."
After they had recovered, Watson remarked, "Well, you know, Holmes, we might as well try the cigarettes."
Watson, his face drawn, regarded Holmes for what was surely an eternity. Embarrassment was in his gaze but also relief and something else, which Holmes could not identify. "Yes," he agreed at last, shaking Holmes's hand. "That would suit me very well."
Murmurs in the entryway, heralding a client. Footsteps stumbling on the stairs. A halt at the first landing. Reluctance. Deciding how to frame his appeal for help. Whether he should present an appeal at all.
Another breeze drifted over them, ruffling Watson's moustache. Holmes playfully tried to tamp it down with the flat of his hand, but it defied his efforts.
"Your necktie," Holmes pronounced and he glanced up at Watson as he pulled the tie through the channel of his collar. Watson cleared his throat, but did not remove his gaze from his friend's face.
A cunning grin crept across Holmes's face. "To the contrary. My mind is a very flexible instrument. And you haven't drunk your tea." Watson sipped from his cup, making a mock grimace. Holmes laughed appreciatively, then caught himself. What was this man doing here, speaking in such an easy interchange with him? No one sought out Sherlock Holmes for conversation. For that matter, how had Holmes ended up sharing living quarters with him for this long? There was always a larger purpose. What was Watson's? Deep hollows under the eyes. Hollows at the clavicle, too. Dressing gown of simple navy blue wool, without braid or other trim. The gun wound hiding out of sight beyond the opening of the nightshirt's placket. There had been safety in observation until now. He felt an irrational need to chide his companion.
He was nonplussed. "I'm by no means an expert in the matter. I don't believe there is one definitive cure, but several treatments that one should employ. Fresh air is important. Gentle exercise. Having an agreeable mental occupation." His voice ran like a straight line through the queer conversation.
"Can you?" There came to Holmes the echoing corridors of his family's home, the black cliffs of Cornwall and the sea. His father absent on one of his frequent journeys. His mother, her long hands at her sides, as he bobbed a bow to her before dinner. The banishment to the nursery after the perfunctory conversation at table, Mycroft ramrod straight in his chair. Holmes's childhood had been an exile of its own, although he hadn't known it then.
"As I already told you. They delivered a vicious blow to the constable, knocking him unsconscious, and made off with the cup."
The arrival of dawn found the two men still in the sitting room at Baker Street, Watson with his elbows on the desk, his hair wild and disarranged, his eyes bleary, but with a dogged attention to Holmes's remarks while Holmes himself gleamed with entirely too much satisfaction, like a devil who had forgotten to flee the first light of day.
Watson lit two cigarettes, handing one to his friend, and they smoked in silence for a while in the still summer morning.
. Reading the first of those tales–of the old conversations, Watson before him in the armchair with the heat of the fire lapping at his feet–had pierced Holmes like a dagger thrust that catches a man by surprise. He recognised the rush of feeling that ran through him but could not, or refused to, name it, as he let the journal drop onto the desk in front of him. But from that moment, he began to rue his exile and think of it with bitterness in his heart, and knew that he must return to London no matter the outcome.
The sea-coal burned bright. Holmes lay in his bed, too heavy to pull away when Watson knelt beside him. Watson began to wipe Holmes on his belly and his hips, with the cloth he had dipped in water from the pitcher and heated before the hearth-flames. He did so with concentration on his brow and with a gentleness of touch that made Holmes want to pull away. And yet he could not. He was buried too deep in the bed, the languour of their congress still upon him. The warmth of the cloth melted into his groin, into clammy skin and curled hair.
Some days later, Holmes and Watson sat over ham and eggs at the breakfast table, reading through the morning papers, which featured a seemingly unending flow of articles describing the events that had marked the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.
"What? Oh, well. It was poor St Martin who was brave enough to lay the whole thing out. I really did nothing but attend to what he said."
"I'm Emmeline," said the woman. She gave her hand to Watson, offering the tips of her fingers. Then she turned to Holmes, her head lowered, and extended her hand—reluctantly, Holmes thought.
Holmes got out of the bed, inserting his arms into the gown and securing its belt tightly around him. "Dudeney sent over new puzzles, did he? Well, let's hope they're a bit more challenging than the last ones. I sent him a note with my recommendations for making them more idiot-proof, but then I remembered that his readers are
Watson seemed to travel as far away as Ronnie St Martin had done the day he had confessed to the killing of Maxwell Thompson. He began to speak in a halting manner. "There was a volunteer at the hospital in Peshawar. Mrs Ellison was her name. Her husband was the commanding officer of the cantonment. She would sit with me for hours, reading to me or knitting while I did nothing but lie there, recovering from the enteric fever. At last I began to talk to her and— She listened to me," Watson said. "One day I told her my tale of the Battle of Maiwand and everything that happened there. I couldn't bear to relate the full story to her face, so I wrote the rest of it out in a letter. She returned it to me when it came time for me to leave for England. She said it more properly belonged to me. I found that very letter in one of the trunks that arrived the morning that Lestrade brought us the Thompson case. It gave me a shock to come across it again like that. You don't know, Holmes. How flawed I was as a soldier and a doctor."
Although, from what Watson had gathered, Mycroft Holmes was one of the most retiring persons in London, he nevertheless moved with the self-possession of a man accustomed to having his commands obeyed. His bulk communicated a certain imposing quality. And his eyes swept the room like those of an implacable tortoise that had projected its head from inside its carapace long enough to see if mankind still indulged in its curious activities.
No one was given to extravagant eating in Baker Street, and indeed its inhabitants asked for nothing more than simple, stalwart British food. But it transpired that Mrs Hudson, despite her grumbling, had prepared them a splended veal and ham pie. There was a roast duck, too, covered with a tea towel, and another dish of cold new potatoes, flecks of parsley clinging to their shapes. And boiled eggs, enough to keep Holmes and Watson fed the entire weekend. Someone had even left them a lemon pudding, a particular favourite of Watson's.
"You had no way of receiving communications there, whether from the authorities or your employees in your London office?"
Holmes finished at the end of the Lento section, as Watson liked, and the spell of it hung in the air.
"A rather dull question, to be sure. I was expecting to be queried about murder weapons and timetables and fingerprints."
"I know that part of the world. Been there many times. Not Afghanistan. India. I was there during the Mutiny, in fact, but I wasn't allowed to enlist in the Army. They said I was too valuable in Nepal."
"Mycroft and I were taught independence from a very tender age. One of my earlier memories is of the nurse swaddling me tight in my cot. Don't ask me how I should recall this. I believe I must have been no more than three years old at the time. Are you listening?"
and in the thirteen years since, it had acquired a smooth patina, the oils from his hand having darkened the woodgrain around the clasp.
Watson went on, as if he could not hold back the words now. "Preston, the chief medical officer, perished early in the battle. It was left to me and the orderlies to care for the wounded who were delivered to the field hospital. They came in waves. Waves that never stopped. I was wounded late that afternoon, and became enraged that I should have so foolishly let myself stumble into the path of a Jezail bullet. I looked around me and saw two stretcher bearers. I screamed orders at them to carry a man who was already half dead to the operating tent. Screamed at them as a way in which to relieve my own pain. When I looked over at them again, a shell had landed in their midst and there were only pieces of flesh lying about where men had been before." Watson hung his head, bitterness in his voice. "We all have our confessions to make, it seems."
A distinct reserve settled on the room, broken only by the crackling of the fire. Watson thought on Mrs Hudson's words. It was the first time since Holmes's visit to his Kensington surgery that day last April that he had had any glimpse into his sentiments. They had seemed to arrive at some kind of an accord that day, but Holmes had never alluded to it again nor given any other sign of his thoughts at having Watson back in his old home.
"No, come here," and Watson hauled him up beside him. They were close now and more than a little odorous, breathing into each other, Watson grazing Holmes with his moustache, trying to make him look up so that he could catch what was in his eyes. They murmured to one another, barely making sense, exchanging half-formed sounds of comfort.
"It was an outdated tradition even then. To wrap children up like that. But you mustn't think that I minded it. In fact it was an immense protection, having one's body so neatly contained. It induced a spiritual exaltation the likes of which I've only experienced on a few occasions since, and which left me almost weeping for the bonds of long ago. When I was allowed to graduate to short trousers, I used to remember that time more than a little wistfully. It's a difficult thing to explain."
Dammit, he had forgot during the past four years what an infernal thing it was to write poems. Why in Heaven's name did anyone bother with them in the first place?
But his words must have been half-hearted, for he leaned down to catch Watson's lips in another kiss. Shivers bloomed in the cavity of Watson's chest as he looked up at him. Holmes seemed in no hurry and the embrace deepened as he bore down upon him, insistent.
"She told me. She told me. He had inflicted the most unspeakable suffering on her, used her in the basest way, for years." St Martin broke down. "All my labours, all my appeasements, were for nothing. I clung to Emmie, but I can't recall what I said to her or how I left that house. Only the whisky got me through that day. And many days thereafter."
Watson threw down his pen, his face warm at the memory and at what had followed. He leant back in the chair, grinning. Then he cast his eye over the dutiful, leaden lines before him. How could words capture the smallest part of what he felt for Holmes and the ways in which he had changed as a man because of him?
"Come on, get dressed," Watson said as he brought the gown to the bed and put on Holmes's mouse-coloured dressing gown. "What? All done in, are you?" The garment was comically long on him, and it drew a smile of appreciation from Holmes.
Watson veered out of view while he fetched his medical bag, and then returned. "The sutures aren't ready to be removed yet. Not for a week at least. But they shouldn't give you any more trouble."
"Ah, a war hero! How intriguing. Can I offer you a brandy? You look like a man who knows his brandy."
"Yours? You hold a fire to be the source of all things holy. God, how do you stand the heat in such close quarters?"
"'No need to apologise. It's natural that one would be curious. They don't show it, by the way. The fear.'  With some difficulty I gathered my thoughts. 'But after a while, you learn to know which of the men carry it inside them and which don't. It's difficult to explain, really. But it cleaves the person in half, whether officer or man. Like a bright red slicing in two. You can almost smell it.'
"Thompson, very unfortunately, had a predilection for—. Well, it's entirely too shocking to name. For the company of certain young men, if you must know." Watson shifted in his seat. "As I said, appearances can be deceiving, Mr Holmes. But I'm sure you know about that. In your line of work."
"Hmm? No, I can't say that I have." He had approached his chair and was about to sit down, when he turned suddenly to face Watson. "My congratulations," he said.
Holmes sat himself down in his chair, laying his violin across his lap with one hand and tucking a clutch of strings beside him in the crevice formed by the cushion. He began to remove the old strings from the instrument, tossing them into the darkness, and took up one of the new strings, threading it along its path towards the neck of the violin.
They fell silent. The rain slid in heavy sheets down the windowpanes, and Watson nestled closer into Holmes's shoulder. "What did your mother make you for tea?" he asked.
"Well," Watson offered with a gallant air. "I am slow at going about things, and a great creature of habit. I'm not as quick as you and our friend here are at coming to decisions. Keeping up with the both of you is a life's work in itself."
"The large one?!" Watson threw back his head in laughter, his Adam's apple stretching. "But of course you would notice it!" For some reason Holmes could not understand, he felt a corresponding delight bubble up within him. He looked in wonder at the man before him. At his throat with its remembered scent, dark and musky, and the arc of it. There were no more words. Only this moment. Plates and utensils plunging, peeled eggs tumbling, Holmes leaned in to kiss that beautiful line.
"But how could a person disappear like that? Please explain it to me, Lestrade, for I have the greatest difficulty in understanding!" Holmes whirled about, turning on the Inspector, his dressing gown flaring around him.
"You'll probably think it foolish. But I was rather hoping to lay out the case of Jefferson Hope just as you're doing with your scrapbook there, although with words rather than clippings. As a story, if you will."
"Dr Watson." Ah, Ronnie St Martin. "I ... I didn't know if I should find you here this late in the afternoon. Forgive me ..." Voice slurred from an (entire?) afternoon spent drinking at his club. "I ... I thought I might stop by. It's about Mr Thompson ..."
The last of the pink sky had vanished. Holmes's remark stayed with him for longer than he had anticipated. But, although he considered it from several angles, he was unable finally to make out its meaning.
Holmes pressed on. "Aren't you? Dancing about, hovering, afraid to come near me. It makes me positively jumpy. I can't even think with you around now!"
"Yes, a second-storey window," she repeated. "They say it is so peaceful and beautiful in Hampstead, but it's awful. Desolate. No one talks to you here."
"Well, of course. 'Neigh, weigh, inveigh, shay, prey, they, convey, yea, obey, purvey, survey, disobey, gray, aye' and–'denay,'" he had finished with a flourish.
"The way the thing wasn't bolted down, it's no surprise that the thieves managed to bolt with it," Watson chuckled. "And you do have to admit that it's rather humorous. Stealing a priceless object from the British Museum. Then sending it to the Queen wrapped in a Huntley and Palmers biscuit tin, of all things." He looked up to find two sets of grey eyes directed at him–one pair stern, the other admonishing–then gave an awkward cough and fell silent.
Watson regarded him, amusement in his eyes. "I can just about make out the child you must have been."
Several drops of honey had fallen and merged on Holmes's hand. They glistened there in the firelight, rounded and inviolate. Watson could fix his eyes on nothing else. With the slowest of movements, gently, perched on the edge of the armchair, he leaned over, a little off balance, and took Holmes's hand in his own. He felt its calluses in his grasp. He lowered his head, clumsy but intent, his whole frame now trembling, and brought his mouth to the drops, sucking them where they sat on the mound between Holmes's thumb and forefinger. Watson tasted the summer and the bees in the drops, and the muscle underneath.
"The devil–! I just had this cleaned and at no small expense, either. Cab drivers–the most oblivious race in all the British Isles!"
Why hadn't he seen this coming? But Holmes always was one to reveal the most important clues as if they were so much diversion.
"At first, it was small objects from the shops. Once a hat. I remember how I hastened home that afternoon, terrified lest anyone should see the shape of it beneath my coat. He laughed and asked why it had taken me so long to return with the prize."
Perhaps as a last resort, Watson took up his volume of Shakespeare's sonnets. He cast his eyes desultorily over the pages of the introduction. A commentator of the period had remarked: "so the sweete wittie soule of Ovid lives in mellifluous and honey-tongued Shakespeare, witnes his
She led them into a parlour, her flowing gown trailing behind her. Then she turned to Holmes and Watson, lifting her chin. "I don't suffer from melancholy," she said. Holmes paused, unsure how to respond to such a pronouncement.
How far the morphia had dragged him below the surface. He should measure the bars of his beating heart to ensure it had not stopped altogether. Was it his latest dosage that had left him thus or his old desire to slip away? Slip, slip the confines of this mortal form and vanish into air, into thin air. Anywhere but here in Baker Street. Only here in Baker Street. Why only here? The pair of dark blue eyes that followed him. Followed him? He scoffed at himself. No, they most certainly didn't follow him, but when they turned their attention to him, Holmes remembered a lithograph that had absorbed him at university, the stars of the Southern Hemisphere falling across a night-blue ground.
Watson ran from the room, tossing a "Come on, Sherlock!" over his shoulders.
