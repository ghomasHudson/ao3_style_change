to trust me.”  His smile twisted into something sad and painful.  “And that trust was assuredly broken by these two men.”
Castiel’s hand was still warm on his forearm.  “Do you?”  He rubbed Dean’s arm, pursing his lips.  “Before you answer that, let me ask this:  where are you most comfortable subbing?”
, happened to be the brown-haired, green-eyed dream who worked at the small appraiser’s office down the street.  He’d learned the man’s name quickly – Dean – and memorized his order almost as fast.  Straight black coffee and a cinnamon donut every morning.  Every lunch, a turkey club with a pickle and tomato soup.  Which happened to be Castiel’s favorite, too.
Dean nodded.  “I can’t go to Sam.  I don’t want him involved.”  He reddened.  “He thinks I’m an airline pilot and that’s why he never sees me.”  He toed the carpet under his feet.  “So.  There you have it.  I was stupid and now I’m paying for it.”
Horrified, Castiel froze, the umbrella open and out, water continuing to sluice down his face and shoulder.
me!” Dean whined.  He writhed, bucking his hips.  “C’mon; make me feel it!” he taunted, face flush and sweat shining on his forehead.  He grinned, nearly manic.  “Or are you all talk?”
Castiel held out a small, white card.  ”My private number.  If you ever wish to talk.”  When Dean didn’t take it, he slipped it into Dean’s shirtfront pocket.  ”Whoever harmed you in the past was wrong.  He was a terrible Dom.”  He took his hands away, stepping back.  ”Please understand that.  You’ve done nothing wrong.”
Dean grinned.  “Smells great, Cas.”  His eyes widened a bit as Castiel pulled the pie he’d purchased from the fridge.  “And pie?  I feel spoiled.  I just brought shitty wine.”
Content that the kitchen was usable again, Castiel found Dean’s coffee machine and filled the pot with water, letting it bubble up as he returned to the living room.  Dean had something in his hands, his head bowed over it.  A small leather book, from what he could see.
“I’ve learned,” he began, voice soft, “what it is to crave.  I’ve felt that need.  I’ve seen what it can do.  How damaging it can be.”  He raised a hand through the space between them, nearly touching Dean’s cheek as he did.  “I’ve also seen how beautiful it can be.  How strong and clear.  How it can be the purest impulse.  The most honored.”  His hand fell away, landing on the seat, a hair’s-breadth from Dean’s.  “So, yes; I do understand how that can happen.  And knowing that, I will not allow it to be obliterated.  I would see it instead granted a proper rest.”
let the matter go.  Then his tongue caught up to the rest of the events.  “Fuck you, Cas.”  He matched Castiel’s glare with one of his own.  “Yeah, maybe your family isn’t any of my business but how you treated me in there
He squinted, eyes unfocused.  “Hmmm.  Loaded question.”  He snorted, turning away and almost falling over the chair as he picked up a nearly empty bottle of whiskey.  He eyed it, sputtering his lips.  “Dammit.  Just bought this today.  I think.”  He took another hard swallow, hissing.  He held it out toward Castiel.  “Need a hit?”
Castiel lifted a brow but obliged him, sitting in the chair across Dean’s desk.  “You’re still angry,” he stated.  He looked toward his lap.  “I’d hoped you could forget all this.  Just . . . let it go.”
A bit of his unease faded, a small smile tugging at his lips.  He thought for sure the constant formality would be boring or irritating.  But Castiel’s technical way of speaking had grown on Dean.  Settling back into his chair, he answered, “Uh, no.  Not right as yet.”
He twitched when he heard someone clear their throat.  He turned, blinking at the man standing before him.  Tall, dark hair, blue eyes.
Dean grumbled the entire way to the store, but he did as Castiel had so humbly asked.  To his surprise, the “
“Maybe I should be mad at you, Cas, but I’m not.”  He still held Castiel’s hand, fingers warm and soft as they toyed with Castiel’s.  “I don’t care why we met, or how; I’m just glad we did.”
came into my life at a time when I was lying to myself and confused as fuck.”  He dropped his hand, reaching out to take one of Castiel’s.  “That book made me realize that the time wasted on lies or appearances was just that.  It’s not worth it.”
Taking a deep breath and realizing his excuses were as weak as a wet paper bag, he started the car and headed off, hoping to
Dean’s head snapped up and he frowned.  “What?”  But Castiel wasn’t paying attention, instead signaling the waiter for a check and to-go boxes.  “Wait, Cas.  What?”
Curious, Castiel filtered through the information he had on Sam and Dean.  Sam currently practiced law in New York City.  High ranking prosecuting attorney.  Well on his way to becoming assistant DA.  Had put away more than one high profile murderer in his brief tenure.  If anything, Dean’s constant theft should be hurting Sam.  Dean, however, had been unknown until ten years ago.  Burst on the thieving circuit — if it could be called that — with the highest thefts and least amount of damage.
THE WORLD IS OVER.  I UPDATED A SUPERNATURAL FIC.  Technically, this is an older snippet I had on my blog but I neatened it up and cleaned up the tense.  I'm still not a huge fan of present tense writing but it should be consistent; unlike the first version.  :p
love making’s all about.”  He tightened his grip on Castiel’s ass, smirking at the squawk that fell.  “You’ll see,” he whispered, sucking on Castiel’s ear lobe.  “You’re gonna know the real thing, real soon.”
He climbed into the bed behind Dean and spread the man’s cheeks, his dick jumping at the sight.  “Oh, in time.  Don’t worry.”  Saying nothing more, he leaned in, letting his tongue drag along the hole and cleft, grinning when Dean bucked and shuddered.  “I could do this all night,” he growled.
deserve Castiel.  Fairies were libidinous, it was true, but genuine affection wasn’t so freely traded.  And Castiel
Castiel followed his direction and chuckled.  “I haven’t seen one of those in years,” he admitted.  He focused on Dean.  “It is a tradition, you know,” he added in a soft voice.  He tugged on his black, leather gloves and sighed.  “I admit, one of my favorites.”
He bowed his head and leaned against it, well away from Dean in the process.  “I apologize,” he murmured.  “I’d been unaware my father was even in the state.  I hadn’t time to prepare.”
you are such a desirable companion.”  He carded fingers through Dean’s hair, sighing.  “So much fire and life.  You fight me and I want nothing more than to feel that.  I
He drove to Dean’s shop, trying to shuck his dark mood but unable to get very far.  By the time he’d parked, he was
As Dean withdrew his hand from Castiel’s, it felt naked and cold.  He started the car and drove with one hand on the steering wheel, his right hand on the seat between them, Castiel’s pinky finger twined with his own.
“Learn to turn your nightlight off,” he groused, cracking open one eye.  Before Castiel could retort, Dean rolled over, pinning him to the bed.  He kissed Castiel sleepily and muttered.  “Need sleep.  Gotta find your off switch,” he added, pawing at Castiel.
cougar?!  Dean had gone mad.  Or Castiel had.  Hard to tell.  The little blue-eyed monster on the counter blinked at Dean before turning back to its bowl of slop.
On Friday morning, after yet another round of internalized questions with no answers, Dean received a call from Castiel, bright and early.
"Perhaps Tesco," Balthazar muttered, grinning at Castiel's scowl.  "Lovely work, as usual, darling."  He blew a kiss.  "You shame us all with your luck."
Unsure of what else to do, Dean did exactly that.  He walked in a bit of a haze out of the restaurant, digging through his pockets for the keys.  He fumbled them a few times, nearly dropping them before they got to the car.
Whimpering, Sydney lapped at the drops of silver-streaked red, his breathing slowing and his eyes losing their wild glow.  He wiped his mouth, glancing at Castiel.  “’m sorry,” he mumbled.  He looked like a wayward child then.  All gangly limbs and shaggy hair.  “I . . . I’m sorry,” he repeated, his voice a hiss of breath.
Maybe a bit depressing if he bothered to dig into it but Dean had a pretty damn good life.  He didn’t try to over-reach.  Didn’t try to envy others.  Tried to enjoy what he had and what he could get.  Didn’t mean he didn’t
Unsettled by the plea in the man’s voice, Dean played with his pencil, staring at Castiel.  What could he do?  Dammit, Dean had no idea at this point.  Truth be told, he wanted to be with Castiel
Castiel blinked in the gloom, rubbing his eyes.  He felt worn but happily so.  Dean had apparently cleaned them both up for he didn’t feel the normal tackiness to his skin that came from falling asleep so soon after coming.  Peering into the dark, he called out tentatively, “Dean?”  He heard the man freeze and leaned over, clicking on the bedside lamp.  Not yet four.  He frowned, yawning.  “It’s a little early, isn’t it?”
Instead of responding to the overtures, Dean froze, beer halfway to his mouth.  He swallowed and moved, setting the bottle aside.  With careful hands, he pulled Castiel into his lap, gaze steady and serious.  “You . . .” he stopped, licking his lips.  “You sure?” he rasped finally.  His hands rested light and almost cautious on Castiel’s hips, not pulling or pushing.
Castiel snorted, letting go of Dean’s face and lifting a hand, palm out.  “You are drunk and rude,” he snapped.  He pressed his palm to Dean’s forehead, singing out a simple, harsh song.  Dean’s eyes rolled up into his head and he crumpled to the ground.
as he pressed his cheek to the cool tiles.  He was going to have that tattooed on his forehead before this case was over.
Dean acted as though he’d seen a fairy before.  Intrigued, he fluttered closer, wings beating slow.  He made certain to stay out of arm’s length but found Dean’s green eyes watching him.  Bored almost.  Not for the first time did he wish his voice worked in this form.  His questions came out has yelping squeaks and he frowned, spinning in a lazy circle.
Hands clenched in the couch, he rocked against Dean, gasping when that sinful cock hit him again.  “Please!” he begged.  “I . . . I can’t take it!”
He stared blearily straight ahead before finally barking out a tired, strained laugh.  Seriously?  So far-fetched but also highly believable when it came to this man.  ”Dean, are you
He grunted when Dean pulled him into a hug, arms warm and tight around his back.  He wanted to squirm away but he sank into it, eyes shut tight.  Oh, God; he
Not to be ignored, Castiel returned to the window, beating at it with his tiny hands, even as the glass seemed eager to singe his skin.  Like touching too-hot pavement.  Eventually, Dean returned, throwing the window open again.  Before he could get a question out, Castiel darted past his elbow, fluttering into the cabin.
With the window of communication opened again, Dean wasn’t that surprised to receive a text from Castiel around noon the next day.  He was, however, surprised by the brief nature of it.
through his food before swallowing his mouthful.  He coughed slightly and turned to James, his hand clenched atop his own napkin.  “A-are you all right with that agreement, James?” he asked, his voice thready.
to be with him.  It managed to be all the things he’d found with Castiel, frightening and amazing as they were.
book of my career on your looks alone, Dean.”  Again that eye drag.  “Mind if I do so?”  He leaned in and whispered, “I promise to make it worth your while.”
Castiel stood up and began to pace.  “No one knows what I look like.  You can do it for me!  All you’d have to do is say a few things and then sign some books.”  He held out his hands, grinning.  “Very easy.  No one will know any different and Gabriel will stop pestering me about this.”
Castiel smiled.  “Not so crudely; but yes.”  He lifted his hand, hesitant.  Taking Dean’s silence as acceptance, he brushed his fingers through the man’s soft hair.  “I’ve missed you,” he breathed.
now nearly midnight; the wheel itself wouldn’t be operating but the banks of the river wouldn’t necessarily be empty.
Dean crushed Castiel to him, drowning in the kiss.  He would likely never shed hunting.  He’d done it for too long.  Daddy’s blunt little instrument, and all.  But maybe, here with Castiel, he could begin to unwind it from what remained of his tarnished spirit.  Balthazar had to have saved
love him in return.  Lust was one thing; fairies often incited it in mates.  Love, however, became a commodity most didn’t trade in.  So perhaps he’d read Dean wrong.  Perhaps this was simply lust and its startling color.
Pamela seemed unwilling to let the subject drop.  She half-turned to him in her seat, giving him her best co-host smile.  “You sure?  I thought for
He took a seat, dismayed to find James inching his chair over closer.  The man ordered white wine and leaned back in his chair, once more surveying Dean.  “You know, had I known
to subdue it; I have to make certain it can’t continue as it has.”  He shifted his shoulders, rolling his neck.  “Left alone, they become demons.”  He eyed Dean then.
Special people got that prize.  He rubs his face, yawning.  What was he saying?  He’s feeling awfully heavy now and just wants to crash.
“Dean, if I wanted, I could fuck you.  Right now.  In this car.”  Castiel was canted a bit, his back wedged against the door and the car seat.  “I would make you sob and scream.”  He waved a hand.  “In public.  Fully nude.  Anyone would see you.”
Castiel's a harried doctoral student who slips out of his house one day due to a broken coffee maker and happens to meet a gorgeous, green-eyed police officer.  Thank God for broken coffee makers.
He might die from the onslaught.  Dean’s presence alone threatened to unravel him.  Coupled with the man’s damn near sinful touches and Castiel’s cock was already half-hard, straining against his slacks.
“Well, lads; I believe I am no longer needed.”  He grabbed his jacket and shrugged into it, smirking at Castiel.  “Seems someone could have told me to sleep in this morning, had he bothered.”
He was still toying with the box in his hands, his mind running over old memories when Castiel returned.  He handed over a soda and hot dog to Dean and sat with a grunt, his own dinner held awkwardly in his hands.
As promised, the hospital released Castiel the next morning, directly into a taxi headed for the airport.  Singer said he’d have the rest of Castiel’s belongings in France shipped to wherever he ended up living.  So, with little more than an overnight bag, an ache in his side, and an airline ticket, Castiel prepared to head back to the homeland.  He looked again at the destination.  Kansas, of all things.  It did seem a bit in the middle of everything so maybe it made sense.  But, remembering how Singer had wanted him to reach Dean, he had to wonder if there was an ulterior motive to it.
Dean yelped and side-stepped, eyes wide.  “Jesus.  You need a bell, C-Gabe.”  He cleared his throat, looking away.  “Anyway.  Uh, that’s . . . that’s a good idea.  I can, uh, set up a full display by the register but leave a few of each by James.”  His dark eyes flicked to Castiel.  “You . . . okay with that?”
“Hey, you were the one with the overexcited dick, Winchester.”  His tone mellowed quickly.  “Look, you might be able to get him to talk
He frowned.  “What’s that supposed to mean?”  He knew he was being combative but he couldn’t figure out how it was that Castiel seemed to know
Acting hurt, Sam pouted and muttered, “You know, you keep encouraging her like that I’ll call off the wedding.”
“Hey, Fireball,” he mused, stepping away from the window to let Castiel in.  “Wondered if you’d show up again.”  He gestured toward his chair, facing the murmuring tv in the corner.  “Got you something.”
Dean rubbed his forehead.  “Okay, that’s confusing.  The Gabriel I met was like . . . six foot.  Exactly how tall are you that that’s short?”
Dean winked.  “Seems I still have a few tricks, professor.  Just think how useful I’ll be for you now.”
They ate quietly, Castiel wriggling close to Dean as he did, sighing happily when he managed to get Dean to shift his arm, looping it around his waist.  Dean found he liked the contact.  Like the heat of Castiel’s body under his arm, though it made eating awkward.  Even that, he kind of enjoyed.  Castiel didn’t seem to want much more than his touch at the moment.
?  Why let it all out when I can . . . delight in the unknown?”  He winked at Dean and took a healthy swallow of his wine.
was gorgeous.  He probably heard it a million times.  Castiel couldn’t even be creative in the acknowledgment.  Just a weak
“Marzipan,” Castiel murmured.  He cleared his throat and set the cake down.  “I stayed up all night making them.  They’re quite a pain.”  He chuckled weak, not looking at Dean.  “As soon as it was ready, I called you and hurried here.”  He looked over then.  “I wanted to make certain I wouldn’t miss you.”
The man in question chuckled and patted Castiel’s shoulder.  “Gave us a bit of a scare there, Novak.”  He sat down in the plastic chair near Castiel’s bed.
He should probably be ashamed of the begging whimpers.  The way his voice breathlessly repeated Castiel’s name, over and over.  But it felt too good.  His hand on his cock felt
Castiel picked up his drink and took a hefty swallow.  “Something like that,” he admitted.  He took another gulp before adding, “Or . . . maybe it’s the only thing he’s good at.”
He yawned and changed into another set of pajama clothes and slipped into bed with Dean, arms wrapped around the other man.  Dean’s heart was slow and strong, his breathing even.  Nuzzling the man’s neck, Castiel sang softly until he drifted off, worn but happy.
?  Pushing at Castiel would be the right path to take.  Wasn’t that what the guy always protested with Dean?  Honesty?  Well, right now, Dean didn’t trust the man across from him much.  And he wanted to.  Maybe.  Hard to tell any longer given how ill he felt.  Fuck, he just wanted this all to
Startled, Castiel glanced at the open window and back to the now empty hallway.  Did Dean think he would believe him capable of harm?  Hardly.  Whatever he’d done in the past, Castiel only knew
Dean gave him a quick glance as he picked up his shirt, slipping it on.  “Uh, well.  I was gone those two days, remember?  Some things I need to get to.”  He finally looked at Castiel then but it didn’t last, his eyes darting away quickly.  “I’ll, uh, call you later, all right?”
“Okay.  All right.”  He stood up, fumbling with his shirt.  “Sure.  I mean, if you want.  I’m good though,” he babbled.
Well, that pretty much tore it.  Dean had to see him as a Grade A idiot by this point.  If he didn’t, the man was damn blind.  He’d been so absurd.  And then . . . he’d
This has the mildest amount of angst but is really just Cas being awkward and Dean being a goof and Balthazar making Dean uncomfortable.
He tucked the idea away, however, when he picked up the man at his home, a pleasant two bedroom in the suburbs.  Castiel sat with a sigh, leaning back in the passenger seat.  “Ah.  I’m grateful it’s a Friday.  I’ve decided to cease working weekends if I can help it.”  He rolled his neck, smiling warmly at Dean.  “How was your day?”
Feeling lightheaded, Castiel nodded.  “Six is perfect.”  He turned pointing down the street.  “My house is number 8732.  Just off Main.  It’s, uh, blue.  Erm, bright blue.”  He reddened.  “Hard to miss,” he added weakly.
“Or, we could get coffee and possibly take a sick day?”  He squatted down, picking up the briefcase that had fallen to the ground in all the scuffle.  He lifted an eyebrow, head tilted in question.
Dean pursed his lips and set his phone aside.  “Suppose that’s usual.  I, um, was one.  Once.  For too long.”  He stood, making his easy chair rock a bit, Castiel gripping the rough fabric in response.  Dean paced to the window and in unhinged it, opening it wide.  “I’m not trapping you, Fireball.  I’m not here to . . . anyway.  You probably don’t believe me – which, I can’t blame you for – but I’m not going to pin you in here and do . . . whatever horror story you’re thinking of.”  He waved to the window and walked down the hall of his cabin.  “Just . . . figured you should know.”
Dean’s chuckle reverberated wet and warm against his neck.  “Oh?  I’m making you lose control, am I?”
Quiet still, he looked over and found Benny, his retrieved pistol in hand, Crowley on his knees.  Swallowing, he turned back to Dean and patted the man down.  He found the shotgun wound from before reopened, torn by the bloody knife on the floor.  His jeans were damp with blood.  A jagged knife wound that looked messy but not deep.  He looked up, meeting Dean’s eyes again.
"Yeah, most of humanity doesn’t make sense," Dean admitted.  He held out his hand, resting the back of his fingers to Castiel’s skin.  "Well, no fever.  So probably just a cold-cold."  He pulled his hand away with a quick jerk at Castiel’s curious look.  "Uh, you kind of just have to let it run its course.  Lots of liquids, rest; that kind of thing."
Moving gently, Dean pulled out and lowered Castiel’s legs to the bed, dropping a warm, sweet kiss to the inside of each calf as he did.  He grinned almost shyly as he wiped Castiel off with the edge of the quilt.  Falling to his side on the bed, he reached out hesitantly to stroke Castiel’s chest.  Chirping, Castiel rolled over quickly, wrapping his arms around Dean and nuzzling into him.
”  He glared at Dean, thankful the man listened for once.  “You don’t need to protect me, Dean.  If anything, I can protect
He shivered at the name, licking his lips.  “I, uh, well.  Maybe, that is, tie me up?  Maybe stroke me off?”  His face burned at the words and he refused to look at Castiel.  God, he sounded stupid.  Like a child begging for a toy at Christmas.  And he couldn’t dispel how strange it felt to put a voice to his wants.  Before it’d just be happenstance if his needs coincided with either Azazel or Michael.  That he’d be lucky to hit on a kink he liked when the other men were getting off on him.
“Yeah, I’m thinking, set up a display for his most recent book and then he can talk for . . . maybe a half hour?  Maybe even read from it?”  Dean shifted leaning back.  He’d headed home over his lunch and changed into his tightest pair of jeans, a dark gray button-down and a slightly too-tight vest.  He even made certain to keep his sleeves rolled up so that his tattoo remained in full view.  He didn’t need his glasses at the moment but they were folded and waited patiently in his vest pocket.  According to that article, Castiel was most undone by
would continue as planned?  Great.  Dean frowned at that.  “He still wants you to pretend to be him?”
He mentally slapped himself as Dean handed him a filled mug.  Thankful for the distraction from his damn horny mind, he took a sip, unable to stop the low moan.  “Oh, my; heavenly.”  He lifted the mug for another sip and found Dean staring at him, lips parted.  Confused, he tilted his head.  “Dean?”
Taking his hand away, he let his gaze drag over Dean.  Chest flush.  Sweat beading against his forehead.  Muscle tight.  He glanced at the wound on his shoulder, pleased it was still wrapped.  At least the idiot could take care of himself.  Maybe.
If that was the case, though, why did Castiel keep arranging dates?  Was it nothing more than Dean as eye candy?  He’d mentioned early on he thought Dean attractive.  Could be he just wanted the companionship.  Or the appearance of it.  Dean had caught more than one person looking their way when they went out.  Castiel could very well be getting his jollies from something as simple as that.
Castiel squinted, mouthing the words before the meaning hit him.  He beamed.  ”Oh.  Yes.  I would like to try cooking soon.  You’ll be a good way to test my skills.”  He turned back to his soup, spooning golden broth happily.
To his relief, though, the man let go of Dean relatively quickly.  Not that the situation seemed better.  Dean looked more shaken than before.  The man patted Dean’s cheek, sharply, considering the way Dean’s head snapped back.  But he left, strolling away in the same direction he’d arrived.
He breathed out a bit, tensing as the cars’ engines drew closer.  That wasn’t entirely true.  While he and Dean didn’t interact face-to-face often, he knew a great deal about the man.  Had to, in order to try and locate him all these years.  Dean wasn’t a violent criminal.  He usually only stole from those so well off they didn’t miss the article in question.  When he’d spoke to Sam a few years ago, the younger Winchester had been full of glowing praise and … well, sadness.  This lie Dean told of being an airline pilot clearly didn’t sit well with the other man.
Gabriel had finally finished attacking his salad and he wiped his mouth, shaking his head.  “Of course not, Dean.  This was my treat, as I’d stated.”  He smiled, the first truly warm look of the evening.  “I appreciate you meeting with us on such a short notice, of course.”
The man next to him snorted.  “Right.  Bartlett writes hot sex but he also writes great stories.  He should be proud.”  He sighed.  “Personally, I’d love to hear how he comes up with so many different plots; sex is still just sex in the end.  He manages to tweak things enough that nothing sounds repetitive.
Castiel’s dark eyes darted up to him, warm and kind.  “Dean.  I have no intention of sleeping with you until you desire it.  I’m not about to force myself on you.”  He sighed, not annoyed.  “I admit, that will test me at times; you’re an exceptionally gorgeous man.  But, if you are to trust me, I need to wait until you are ready.  That’s it.  There’s no negotiation there.”
He twisted in his seat, wide-eyed.  A man sat in the back of his car.  A man wearing jeans and a leather jacket.  A
Dean flinched and rose, wiping his hand on a rag.  He turned around, face blank.  “Actually, I’m a pretty damn good one,” he retorted.  He pointed toward the door.  “I’ve got customers so you should probably head out.”
Dean took a large forkful of his pasta, tasting nothing as he chewed at it.  Admittedly, he didn’t enjoy being harmed or to be humiliated.  He liked to have someone take him over, though.  Leave him helpless with pleasure.  He used to love being tied up.  Exposed while Michael worked him over with his mouth, bringing him to orgasm.  But Michael had stopped that fairly quickly, forcing Dean to his knees to bring himself off most nights.
The desire to scratch his wrists burned and Dean rubbed his thumbs harshly into the steering wheel.  “It’s . . . weird, okay?”  He squirmed in his seat, well aware that Castiel was watching him closely.  “I don’t know why you even care,” he admitted.
His tremors eased and he found his breathing had steadied.  But he felt lightheaded still.  Barely grounded.  As though a slight wind would snap his nerves.  “I’m not . . . I have nothing to offer you,” he said, startling himself.
Sitting at the terminal, awaiting the boarding signal, he dug through the file again, finding the same stuff as before:  location hunting, setting up leases, hiring, etc.  Boring stuff compared to his usual work.  He felt like he’d retired or something.  As he slid the papers back into the folder, a small piece of paper fluttered out, hitting the floor.
“And then,” Dean continued, his body a searing hot line against Castiel’s hip, “I say we should find out just
He sighed, taking Castiel’s hand again, fingers gentle and warm.  “Yes.  No.  I don’t know.”  He kissed the palm of Castiel’s hand, covering it with his other hand.  “I don’t like the idea of you hurt.”
Rolling his eyes, Castiel muttered, “Yes, you are.  In fact, he’ll probably come looking for me soon if you don’t get off my phone.”
Emboldened, Castiel leaned in, whispering in Dean’s ear, “And stop whining like a damn infant,” he added, before pulling away and bouncing off the bed.
He glanced up at the clock and stood.  “I should get going, Sammy.  Give Kevin my number and have him call me.  I have some questions for him.”
The man in question straightened a bit more, sucking in a breath as he did.  Giving his head a harsh shake, water flying, he blinked as the rain continued before waving waved toward Castiel, snapping his fingers.  “You good?”  He took his other hand away from his groin and smirked.  “Pretty sure I’m the one who got nailed in the junk.”
-- would I be out of line asking you to have lunch today?  I know I said tomorrow and all but . . .” he reddened and shrugged, not looking at Castiel.
thing.  Well, once.  Long time ago.”  He still wouldn’t meet Castiel’s gaze, turning instead to watch the few morning cars drive by.  “So.  Just so you know.  I don’t cheat or anything but . . . I kind of have a bad track record.”
The blush suffused his body and his glow heightened as he did, echoed in the amusement crossing Dean’s face.
Dean's a detective and he celebrates Sam's new baby with style.  Thankfully, Cas is also a detective and a more functioning adult.
"Hold it," Castiel remarked, smirking.  Something sparked in his head and he grinned, moving quickly to crawl across the bed, crouching over Dean.  The man’s eyes widened, sharpening into a lovely shade of green.  "Dean," he murmured, "it’s in your best interests to be good right now, all right?"
Benny reached behind his back and pulled out a smaller pistol, handing it over.  “I’m better with knives, brother,” he grinned.  He flicked his wrist and a wicked blade slid out of its sheath into his palm.  He inclined his head toward the darkened end of the tunnel.  “I ain’t waitin’ for Bobby’s shindig; you ready?”
He opened his eyes slowly, staring at nothing.  He wondered how the hell anyone could want something so completely, that they couldn’t move on.  Couldn’t let go.  Would instead turn into something so horrendously violent, whatever life they’d lost would be forever tarnished.  Broken and forgotten.  By turning into a dybbuk, whatever they had craved was now truly out of reach.  A soul damned and fit for little more than a flash of salt and a match.
Castiel couldn’t stop the blast of golden light that trailed along his wings.  Their date!  Of course Dean didn’t know the fairy he entertained was the same man he’d had dinner with last night.  Guilt suddenly swam with his whiskey and he crooned, the light dying a bit in his wings.  Maybe this had been a poor idea.  He probably should go.  Appearing in this manner was little more than spying, as he’d worried.  Dean didn’t know who he was.  Couldn’t know.  Yet, Castiel couldn’t make himself move.
, Dean had been expected to kill.  It didn’t matter that it was a supernatural creature.  His father expected him to take the life of another.  He swallowed, wondering how it was possible that a man exposed to such horror so soon in his life could still smile so broadly.  Could still touch him so gently.
Why did he just want Castiel to use him?  To be honest, he hadn’t liked it when Azazel and Michael just
that the supernatural existed in those woods.  That he knew something was there.  Yet, it was clear he didn’t care.  That it didn’t even
to drop by unannounced.  He’d done that once with Michael.  And the man had forced him to wear a gag for two hours as punishment, alone in the dark.  His fingers twitched and his heart raced as he wondered what Castiel would do to him.
“Uh, right,” Dean muttered.  Somehow, he managed to keep James on track before their meal arrived and they were able to hash out the signing itself.  The following Monday, James would arrive at the store and do a Q&A for his latest book as well as the signing.  Relatively low fanfare though Gabriel had agreed to let Dean handle the publicity in town.  He’d be the one to contact the home office to let them know it was proceeding.
Castiel squatted down and leaned into the open window.  “And a good morning to you, Dean,” he responded.  “You know, it’s not that far to walk to get to your shop from that cabin,” he teased.
For three weeks, Dean watched the man in the scruffy jogging shorts and AC/DC shirt trot past his house.  Every day.  Clockwork.  He ran past Dean’s front door at six in the evening, every damn day.  When it began to rain finally, he figured he wouldn't see the guy for a while.  But, no.  He still ran by.  Dean couldn’t complain; a soaked t-shirt made for some good ogling time.
Castiel chuckled.  “Well, I’d hate for it to go to waste.”  He waited patiently in Dean’s entryway, watching him.
He smiled weakly and nodded.  With temptation gone, he felt his body relaxing, the last vestiges of desire and lust cooling into an itch he’d have to scratch later.  Feeling presentable finally, he rose from the table, bringing their empty wine glasses to the sink.  “I’m glad you could join me for dinner, Dean,” he said, leaning against the counter.
to this.  In his dreams, Dean usually pinned him but in naughtier ways.  Certainly not in ways that led to drool drying on his stomach.  He scrunched his nose and pushed at Dean again, finding him about as movable as a rock at the moment.
Frustrated, he shifted down to the window again, trying a bit of his own magic.  There were plants inside and if he was lucky, he could coax one to grow fast enough it might push at the window.  But again, the wards were better than he’d expected.  His magic sputtered easily as it tried to cross the barrier.  Had he been inside the house, the action likely would have worked.  Instead, he was stuck outside, miserable, as the rain fell harder.
Unsure of what to say, Dean followed the demand.  His fingers twitched to pull at his dick but he stayed in position, digging them into his thighs instead.
Not thinking, Dean nodded, watching Castiel’s pale fingers slide the thick cuff onto his wrist.  At the quiet jingle of the buckle, Dean realized what a dumb mistake he’d made.  This was supposed to have been a gag to annoy his soon-to-be-married brother with.  Something to make him pout and mutter and swear fratricide.  What it
come sliding through the dirt toward them.  He lifted the weapon only to have the window roll down, a bearded man gesture wildly from the window.  “Now!  Goddammit, that canister’s gonna go any second; I ain’t stickin’ around for it.”
Dean grabbed the blanket, setting it across both their shoulders before opening up his to-go box.  The food was lukewarm, but somehow tasted better than it had in the restaurant.  Like Castiel had said, it was lovely out here.  The cars were a distant shush in the background, very few using the road behind them.  The wind hummed in the air, followed by the faint lowing of cows.  Much better than overhearing a bunch of strangers babble about their day.
“You sound like you didn’t sleep well, Gabe.”  Dean picked up a stack of books and came around the counter, tight jeans showing off his ass as he did.  “Me?  I slept like a damn
Dean knew he was a good looking guy.  And he hadn’t imagined Castiel’s lingering looks or the stunned expression on his face the first day they’d met.  The more he thought on it, the more he was certain
was fully naked.  He licked his lips, staring at the thick, ruddy dick that had sprung free as soon as he’d forced down the man’s briefs.  Castiel moved to kneel and grunted when Dean grabbed him by the shoulders.
Dean repeated the kiss from before, this time with more enthusiasm.  He pulled away and smirked.  “Good deal.  Now I don’t have to pay for my food any longer.”
Swearing, he headed back into his store, letting the door slam behind him.  He’d fucked it up.  He hadn’t meant to kiss Castiel.  Not until he’d gotten the guy to admit who he really was.  But . . . he’d been weak.  Like the bar the night before, Castiel was dressed in jeans and a hoodie, looking completely comfortable and unassuming.  It had kind of clinched Dean right then and there.
But did he really?  Dean could still recall how Castiel would limit their physical interactions.  A part of him was beginning to understand the ‘no sex’ rule but even then, it didn’t explain the rare kisses or just the brush of a hand.  As though Castiel himself didn’t want to cross any boundaries.  The claims of his desire for Dean felt superlative, given that.
Castiel debated on telling Balthazar about Dean’s break-in but opted not to.  He shrugged.  ”I have a difficult time with zone changes.  Though, Dean’s … attitudes never help either.”
"Oh.  Okay.  Thank you."  He didn’t wait for a response, just darted out the door to his bike and pedaled furiously home.
Bad idea?  Maybe.  Difficult?  Certainly.  Castiel rubbed his forehead, feeling sweat begin to bead.  ”Enough, Dean.”  He sat back and glanced at the younger man.  ”Balthazar’s right; we need Crowley to think you out of the game.”
So.  A new boyfriend and trying to be all you can be to impress the guy?  It made some sense.  God knows Dean had done that before.  With women, he’d try to hide his interest in men.  Appear macho and, frankly, douchey.  And when he’d begun dating men, he’d use every cliché in the book thinking it the only way to relate.  Honestly, it took him getting his heart broken a few times to figure out what
It slipped away easily as he began searching the cabin.  One of the drawbacks of fairy life was certainly the innate curiosity.  He buzzed from room to room, picking up things and peeking into small containers.  He found nothing of real interest.  A few strange occult items.  Nothing he hadn’t seen on the younger students who sometimes came in with their parents on the weekends.  Though, the doorways made him shudder.  The main door felt cold and angry.  Same with the back door.  Some of the walls had a strange feeling to them and he didn’t like to be around them long.  Eventually, he came back to the main room and lit down on the arm of Dean’s chair, poking his head into the glass.
Somewhat startled by the chill in Castiel’s voice, Dean trembled as he pulled into the drive-in’s parking lot, paying for their ticket, offering up a sour, false smile to the cashier.  Still quiet in the car, Dean pulled to the last row, tucking the Impala in at the very end.  He let his hands drop off the wheel into his lap, his eyes fixed on the blank screen up ahead.  “I’m sorry,” he breathed.
The entries were far sparser going forward.  Hints of Sam’s new role.  Related to Hell, somehow.  The coming of angels.  Dean’s destiny as Michael’s vessel.  Horrified and fascinated, Castiel read on.  Read about the apocalypse.  The world ending because of a feud between brothers.  How the death of one ended it all.
He pushed open the door, jumping at the trill of piano keys as he did.  He flinched again at the warm chuckle.
Castiel spent nearly ten minutes with his face planted in starchy fabric before he finally managed to gain enough energy to sit upright.  Still irritated that Dean had gotten into his hotel room, he dialed his assistant director in France, wondering how he was going to frame this additional cost without looking like an alcoholic.
He sat atop his toilet seat, elbow on one knee, chin in his hand.  He rethought his earlier idea about admitting the truth.  He could just tell Dean he’d been so startled that he’d blurted the first thing that came to mind.  They were both adults; Dean was bound to understand.  Maybe.  Probably.  He winced.  Probably not.  If Dean wouldn’t be angry, he’d laugh himself sick at Castiel.  Mock him, maybe.  Toss him out for sure.
At the pronouncement, Dean looked up with a sharp grunt, half out of his seat, nearly tossing his mug of coffee aside until he actually
”  He pushed at Dean, making the man lift up.  He ran a thumb along those plush lips, heart bursting that he could be with this man again.  “This town protects its own; regardless of their past.  They know you, Dean.  They will allow no harm to come to you.”
He swallowed another mouthful of wine.  “Oh, I don’t know,” he lied.  “People talk.  Ghosts, werewolves,” he swallowed nervously, “fairies.  Just . . . urban legends, like you said.”  God, he wanted the subject changed now.  This had been a bad topic to choose.
unless we have some long-ass drag-out fight over stupid shit.”  He snorted.  “And I don’t fight over stupid shit.”
Weirder and weirder.  “He wasn’t . . . abusive or anything, right?”  He tried to put the dark-haired, blue-eyed man that he met in that light and it was nearly impossible.  Gabriel had been shy and twitchy.  Certainly not so expressive.  More and more, it sounded like the poor bastard had had a stroke.
Benny poked his head in for a few minutes following Bobby’s departure, letting him know he was back on Interpol’s payroll as an actual agent instead of a spy.  He’d reported much the same as Bobby; Dean had stuck around just long enough to make sure Castiel would be in the clear and then vanished.  Heading back to France, Benny waved goodbye and for a moment, Castiel though he’d be alone only to have Balthazar show up, all grins and cheeky attitude.
The guy is sweet, funny, stubborn . . . and so stuck in Dean's head that he's probably going to end up a priest anyway.
But, it still rankled that Dean had bolted.  He’d left nothing new in Castiel’s hotel room.  Nothing in his hospital room.  Just . . . nothing.  He’d almost have thought something else had happened to the man if it weren’t for Singer’s assurances.  So, Dean hadn’t even bothered to say goodbye.  Or taunt him.  Or acknowledge their kisses.
Sighing, he returned to Dean’s question.  ”Not … entirely,” he admitted, unwilling to say more.  He was saved by the tube coming to a stop and the doors binging open.  He leaned in and whispered, “Go opposite me and don’t look back,” before darting away, whistling.
Castiel sighed, fingers overly warm from the styrofoam cup of coffee in his hands.  He’d only just arrived in London and had barely set his head on his hotel room pillow before his phone had exploded into a frenzy of messages and calls.
It was too much.  Far too much information to absorb.  Castiel covered his face, shaking.  “All this time,” he breathed.  “You lied to me . . . all this time?”
Castiel shook his head.  “I don't mind.”  He shuffled the cards, tapping them against the counter to line them up.  Ignoring the
Two cops had walked in; one a tall, bearded fellow with a rolling, slouching gait, the other, just as tall with short brown hair, brilliant green eyes and an easy grin.  Due to impending winter weather, both men were wearing thick, police department jackets but Castiel doubted it hid much.  He was
Trilling, Castiel scrambled to his knees and crawled to Dean, kissing his cheek with gentle brushes of skin.  “You do, though.  All my light and all my love; you deserve all of that.  Please, let me show you.”  He half expected Dean to stop then, to push him away.  But to his delight, Dean pulled him into his naked lap, kissing him soundly.  He purred happily, his legs falling naturally around Dean’s hips and he thrust gently, feeling Dean’s cock wet and warm between them.
Pamela smiled into the camera after yet another puff piece on yet another hipster wedding in a cornfield.  “Speaking of weddings, I hear your brother walked down the aisle, Dean.”
Dean snorted.  “I’d hate to think you’d make crap desserts, Cas.  Helluva piece offering, otherwise.”
Castiel sighed.  As if he couldn’t look more ridiculous in front of his crush.  ”It seems,” he began, “someone’s absconded with my bicycle.”
With his heart wedged in his throat, Dean met those bright eyes and swallowed.  “You do, huh?” he husked.  “You’ve seen civilizations rise and fall in seconds,” he pointed out, barely holding back the sneer.  “Hell, you’ve told me that shit yourself in the beginning, trying to get me to kowtow to the douches upstairs.  How the hell can you get attached to
, was a small town in Western Oregon, bordered by trees and a bit off the main interstate.  About three hours east from the ocean.  Quiet.  Nothing of interest beyond the typical summer events.  A pleasant sort of place to retire to.  He had to assume that had been the man’s intention, though he seemed too young for such a decision.
He leaned against the aged wood of the hallway, arms folded as he listened to Castiel sing.  If there were words, they weren’t any that Dean could understand.  But
Dean dropped his hand, shaking his head.  “Cas, just go; all right?”  He wasn’t smiling any longer, the green of his eyes almost dull.  “It was just sex.  Besides . . . you’ve got better options than a shifty asshole like me.”
He sighed, the air rattling in his chest.  All right.  Meant he needed to clean up how he did things.  Be less obvious.  If he had to act happy around his brother, then fine.  He’d do that.  Dean could lie with the best of them, after all.  And when the time came, he could act happy that Castiel had left.
Dean retrieved the tray and set it up over Castiel’s lap, handing him a spoon.  ”Got your crackers?”
Shuddering, his eyes drifting shut, Castiel clung to Dean, lips parting.  “B-but . . . I’m not very good . . . at . . .
Heaving for breath, the man waved a hand in weak submission.  “D-dude, seriously.  It’s okay.  I’m fine.  You’re fine.”  He snickered.  “Well, we’re fine except we’re both soaked now.”  He patted Castiel’s shoulder in reassurance.  “I mean it; I’m fine.  Ain’t nothing worse than wearing a pair of too-tight briefs.”
“Call me, Dean,” the man purred.  He gestured toward the dig site with a jerk of his head.  “You’ll find that thing ain’t remotely ancient.  I found it at a flea market this morning.”
Dean frowned, confused.  This was just . . . weird.  If anything, he’d have thought the roles completely reversed.  Given his seclusion, he’d been fully prepared to find an eccentric, quite, nervous fellow in the place of James.  And shit; Gabriel had come off
“Please,” Dean rasped, “say something.”  He rubbed his forehead again, fingers dragging through his hair.  “Just say it.  Say that you hate me.  That . . . that I deserve to die.”  He looked at Castiel then.  “I’ve killed fairies, you know?  You can’t trust me.”
“Don’t I know it,” Dean retorted.  He snickered at Sam’s yelp of complaint.  “What?  You can barely make toast.”
that but bringing it up seemed too much too soon.  Or his own fears surging ahead again.  He had a pretty good guess which one.
want to know.  It had to be terrible, whatever it was.  Or said at Castiel’s expense.  Which really meant the same thing at his point.
He didn’t look at his cousin; nor at Dean.  If he looked at either man, he was fairly certain he’d collapse and never get this exposure over.  Heart thundering in his throat, he made his way to the table Dean had set up and stood before it.
The lightbulb in his head went off so fast he chuckled.  Why else do people lie if not for money or fame?  Usually had to do with more . . . entertaining situations relegated to the bedroom.  And while he didn’t like being lied to, he could admit Castiel’s lies had been harmless if pointless.
recently.  Could be Dean’s land.  Maybe.  He chewed his bottom lip.  Probably couldn’t hurt to drive by, right?  If anything, it’d let him get a look at the neighborhood.  Seemed there was a new housing complex just down the sidewalk from the building.  So . . . expanding.  Could be good homes.
He gave the cabin one last, warm look, before fluttering for home, singing under the moonlight as the rain began to fall.
It wasn’t until Dean was halfway to home he realized Castiel had given him a name.  The smile stayed with him until he managed to fall asleep, a few hours later.
“You’re very bad at this game,” a new voice chided.  Alastair.  “I send you in and you get caught?”  He clucked his tongue like one would to a child.  “I was hoping it was a fluke.  That you were still a good, obedient little boy.  You have to understand, this was for
Dean grinned.  “Why’re you apologizing?  It’s kind of . . . cute, actually.  Grown men aren’t usually so gobsmacked over porn, you know?”  He squinted as he released Castiel’s hand.  “You’re not like . . . one of those closeted religious people, are you?”
Castiel’s song broke and Dean’s eyelids fluttered, his eyes almost normal, even under the haze of alcohol.  He sat back heavily, holding his forehead.  “Wha?”  He blinked and squinted, going pale.  “Cas?”
The detective inspector rolled his eyes.  ”Oh, bloody hell.  Must I spell it out for you?”  He held up one hand, folding a finger down.  ”One.  We will arrive in town as scheduled.”  Two fingers.  ”Two.  As we arrange the transfer on some loose idea of a theft you’ve committed last year, my stalwart inside man will arrive with gang in tow, attacking the station.”  He sighed.  ”It’s a small one and frankly, one day, it will happen; I’m just thankful it’ll be under
“Y-you, too,” he managed.  His erection flagged a bit as the reality of what he said cut through the arousal in his head.  He covered his face with both hands and moaned.  “Dammit,” he whispered.  Again with the idiocy.  Of course
Dean only grinned before opening his mouth and taking Castiel in.  Gasping, Castiel’s fingers dug through Dean’s hair as the man sucked and licked, his mouth vibrating around Castiel’s dick.  He squeezed his eyes shut, legs trembling as he struggled not to thrust.  God, how long had he wanted this?  How fucking long had he wanted to do this with Dean?  All the taunts and flirts.  All the stupid little notes.  Through it all, he’d just wanted
It took a second for Dean’s brain to kick back in and he all but fell inside the Impala, the car shuddering as he slammed the door.  He winced and mumbled an apology, jamming the key in the ignition.  Music blared and he flinched, slapping the stereo volume knob.  His cheeks were flaming hot, his fingers trembling.  Dean jumped when Castiel touched his hand.
benefit.”  Tearing cloth.  “You weren’t coming through any longer.  Your hauls were so pitiful.”  Dean yowled, panting harshly.  “And you were such a pretty toy, Dean.”
As he hefted his sandwich board from behind the counter, he found himself already wishing for Wednesday.  A second date surely called for sex; or had in Castiel’s past.  And Dean’s virility rang in the air like a hawk’s cry; nearly palpable to him at this stage.  So, if he was a bit
He pulled into his driveway and shut his eyes, swallowing hard.  Just nerves.  Or adrenaline from their argument.  Maybe.  Steeling himself, he shoved open the Impala’s door, just as Castiel pulled in behind him.
”  Castiel dropped his hands, furrowing his brow.  “I did terrible things as a fairy.  But I am not he any longer.  I am merely
"Dean?"  He spoke softly, all tease gone from his voice.  He didn’t pinch Dean’s hand but held it gently, moving it away to undo the silver latch on his wrist.  "Dean.  You’ve been triggered.  Are you all right?"
Head buzzing with lust, Dean nodded, unable to find the words.  Fuck, he wanted that, too.  He wanted to submit.  To go to his knees.  Do
As he slipped under the covers, he realized the anxiety he’d been dreading all day was nowhere to be found.  He felt sated and satisfied, his body loose and warm as though he’d just been fucked.  He didn’t dwell on the idea long before he drifted off, sinking into darkness.
to tell him who I was.  But . . . he’s really pretty.  A little unreal, to be honest.  So . . . so I . . . I might have . . .
The warm chuckle made his cock leap and his hips jerked, a blush burning into his cheeks at the same time.  “
He led Dean through the halls to Balthazar’s office, finding the blond busy at work, head bowed over his desk.  Castiel shut and locked the door, stiffening when he heard the man drawl, “A threesome so early in the morning?  My, you are full of surprises, Novak.”

order to call.  However, he hadn’t bothered to check when an appropriate time might be.  Or if he was to use the private number.  Or maybe the work number.  So, he paced and rearranged tools, went over appointments, then repeated everything.  Twice.
Despondent, he finished waking up and padded back to his bedroom, pulling on a pair of old jeans and a worn t-shirt, slipping on his hoodie from the night before at the last minute.  No point in trying to make an impression on the man.  At this point he just had to get through the entire unfortunate event and then he could go back to being single and alone.
He shoved out of his chair, pacing, his movements tight and stiff.  He just wanted Castiel to use him.  So that Dean didn’t feel like he’d failed.  He wondered if it would be bad of him as a sub to just go down on Castiel at the drive in.  Maybe he just needed to cross the line?  So far, his attempts at just that hadn’t earned him any punishment.  He’d pushed, like their first date, and other than a correcting word or two, Castiel never reacted.  Never put him in his place.  Maybe Dean just hadn’t found his hot button yet?  Hadn’t found a way to break the man’s concrete patience?
However, the echoing silence fast became something that could only last for a few minutes longer before Castiel lost his damn mind.  He let his flashlight play over the old concrete walls of the tunnel and murmured, “What do you plan on doing when we get there, Dean?”
He hadn’t realized he’d been staring upwards for a while until he collided with something.  Or rather,
Though inwardly still kicking himself, Castiel breathed a sigh of relief.  “Excellent.  Why not meet us at
“No!”  He spun, hands out, face flush.  He winced.  “I mean, no.  I didn’t . . . I didn’t ask him for anything.  He said . . . he said he was . . . um . . . never mind,” he finished, dropping his arms.
before the signing, right?  Why not have Balthazar meet the two of them for dinner?  It wouldn’t be odd, right?  Dean knew he was going to
Not long ago, Castiel had been a studious member of the corporate rat race.  A good little capitalist soldier.  Clocked in at eight, every morning.  Home at five, every evening.  Saturdays when necessary.  Smile politely.  Mind his tongue.  Head down.  Work, work, work.
ended about a year in.  During a night of stupid home movies – most from when Dean was in his rebellious high school years and
They ate quietly, Castiel filling Dean in on his day.  How he’d had to turn a bachelorette party away for being rude and raucous.  How, matter-of-factly, he remarked on losing a shipment of dolphin-shaped dildos.  Through it all, Dean felt his stress melting, his unease and hair-trigger mental state finally fading into something manageable.
That was strange.  Castiel quirked an eyebrow but kept walking, ignoring the comment.  That is, until:
when he spoke about restoring her.  Building her from the ground up twice.  The pride he carried.  And not a dirty, vile pride.  The knowledge of a job well done.  Of craft.
Castiel’s anxiety began to fade again at Dean’s comment.  He relaxed into the man’s embrace and nipped Dean’s lips.  “I admit I have a way with the
Castiel wrinkled his nose at Dean’s response.  Something about the way he answered it seemed to point out that Dean
Castiel considered that.  He knew about hunters.  About their cruelty.  The sadism that often matched that of their prey.  In fact, he’d even heard of a pair of brothers.  Two men who’d started and ended the apocalypse.  Who’d left an ocean of blood in their wake.  Never knew their names, though.  Other than the last;
Probably the closest to an agreement that he’d get out of the younger man.  Taking another swallow of coffee, Castiel leaned back in his chair.  “So.  Friday.  You have to sneak into where, exactly?”
, he mused, feeling tears sting his eyes.   They were more alike than either of them could have guessed.
Reddening, Dean scrambled to his feet, grabbing the blanket that had fallen from their shoulders.  The returned to the car, heading back to the restaurant, most of Dean’s tension long gone by that point.  He pulled back into the lot, pulling in beside Castiel’s car.
On wobbly legs, Castiel pushed up from Dean’s lap, dizzy with lust and love.  He grinned at Dean, somewhat confused to find the man unwilling to meet his eyes.  Shy?  Maybe.  He didn’t think Dean would be shy.  He’d admitted to sleeping with other women.  Had been in a serious relationship a few years ago though he’d hardly elaborated on it.
Dean sat at an old armchair, a fire burning behind the grate.  At his elbow was a cut glass filled with brown liquid and he read from an old paperback, pages folded back in his hands.  So very . . . normal.  Castiel pressed closer, yelping when the glass burned his nose.  Fluttering away in confusion, he rubbed it.
to be a spirit like this,” Castiel began, that familiar burr low and comforting.  “To return in such a way, one would have to feel . . . they’ve lost something.  That some part of them was left behind.  That they themselves are no longer whole.”  He took a breath, frowning at Dean.  “I believe I understand how that can happen.  Why a soul would cling desperately to memories.”
He carried it with reverence to Gabriel’s tent, handing it off.  For a split second, he considered stashing it in his personal bag but the idea soured in his stomach.  No, something this beautiful needed to be shared, not hoarded.  What a ridiculous idea.  No one in their right mind would want to keep others from seeing a genuine piece of history.
Castiel’s jaw tightened noticeably, his blue eyes hot.  He took a heavy breath, letting it out through his nose before he responded.  “My God.  I would sever the
His cousin pursed his lips and muttered, “I need a drink,” before turning and heading into the house.  After a moment, Castiel followed, shutting the door behind him.
Dean’s mouth dropped open.  He had no idea what they were made of but tiny purple dicks dotted the fancy cake.  Including one rather absurdly detailed one that perched atop the otherwise immaculate cake.
Another kiss, soft and sweet, though darkened with a filthy flick of a tongue against his lips.  “It is
as charming as I’ve always been.”  With his free hand, he made a finger gun and shut one eye.  “You’re just
He yelped suddenly when he found himself in the passenger seat, Dean now behind the wheel.  He glared.  “Don’t do that!”
It was just after ten in the morning.  Just opened and probably not that busy at Castiel’s shop but then again, Dean wasn’t all that clear on the rush times at a sex toy shop.
to.  Dean had to bring Sam back because he’d failed.  His one job and he’d failed it.  He couldn’t let his brother die.  So he’d done it.  Sold his soul.
Swallowing his own nervousness, Castiel gave Balthazar the rundown on Dean’s issue.  More than once, he’d had to snarl at the man to shut up and eventually, Dean hunched down in his chair, stewing.  Castiel knew that telling Balthazar this entire scenario would likely piss the younger man off or make him run; frankly, he had little choice.  Balthazar knew London and he knew its threats.  He’d be an asset.
Dean's shoulder blades itched as he stepped inside the store.  It wasn’t skeevy like he’d expected.  Clean and quiet.  Everything set up in a pleasing manner, not dicks hanging everywhere like that one place Michael had sent him to in Las Vegas.  Toys were behind glass cases and there was a bookshelf of DVDs and books related to straight-up porn or just instructional videos.  He glanced over them for a minute, trying to decide if a porn video would be a good way to humiliate his little brother for a night.
In an effort to break himself of the habit, Dean stayed at work late one night, purposefully making it home right at six.  Maybe if he did something different for once, he’d stop looking around for this guy and get on with shit.  His life was rapidly turning into a bad young adult novel.  Pining over someone whose name he didn't even know.  Who was probably straight as a board with nine kids and a wife.  Dean was just being pervy at this point.  Time to move on and find a new fascination to lock onto.
Though Balthazar had agreed on perpetuating this subterfuge, Castiel could tell his cousin wasn’t wholly invested.  He only hoped the interactions with Balthazar-cum-James-Bartlett would be few and far between.  Other than the signing itself, Dean wouldn’t really need to spend much time with Balthazar.  Not unless the two managed to hit it off; God forbid.
Numb with surprise, Castiel grabbed up the second dish and followed Dean quietly toward the picnic table.  Had that actually happened?  Had Dean actually . . . had he hinted that . . . was there –
On Sunday, Castiel entertained the idea of visiting Dean a second time but squashed it quickly.  Dean had been perturbed at his abrupt appearance but it would really be best for him to wait a few more days before he attempted it again.  Though, he was fascinated by the man’s home.  Inside, it was warm and inviting.  At its edges, though, threatening and cold, like a cornered bobcat.
His phone chimed and he snatched it up.  His eyes widened and he swallowed.  Castiel’s answering text was little more than a brief
Dean manages to get his head to move so he can zero in on Pretty Voice.  Blue.  Goddamn gorgeous blue eyes.  Dark hair.  He reaches out and tweaks the guy's nose.  Oh good; he's real.  Even better!
Shortly after leaving Michael behind, what few dates Dean had gone on had been little more than anonymous sex.  Straight up fuck-and-run.  No subbing involved.  Just physical pleasure.  Not that he enjoyed it overmuch.  Perfunctory, really.  Even now, he wasn’t all that certain what it was he was chasing after with Castiel.
The little bastard had slipped free of him after all.  Probably thinking he needed to be some self-sacrificing hero or other nonsense in regards to this theft.  If he ever caught up with Dean again, he’d definitely have to shoot him in the knee to keep him from running.
“I like France,” Castiel muttered, rubbing his eyes.  His head hurt.  And the more awake he became, the more pissed off he ended up.
better than anything, he worried how the man would take it.  Or if Castiel would brush it off as the abuse he’d suffered under Michael and Alistair.
He tried to think if he’d seen the store.  Granted, he didn’t venture out much but for a movie now and again as well as groceries so it was anyone’s guess how old it was.  It might be fairly new.
– I just want to know that you’re here.  With me.”  Another kiss, this one filthy enough to draw out a pleading moan from Castiel’s throat.  “Say you’re here.
” his hands resting loose on Castiel’s hips.  Grinning, Castiel stroked him slow and steady, pleased at the way Dean shuddered under his fingers.  He leaned forward on his knees, careful to keep the pace and with his other hand, began working his body open.  His abdomen quivered violently as he struggled to keep upright but he wasn’t about to stop his motions.
Another slow blink.  And when the taunt had finally worked its way through the alcoholic stupor overtaking them both, he got
stepped outside his shop, the keys dangling from his fingers before the sky opened up.  Swearing, he locked the door with haste and fumbled with his umbrella.  It was one of those newer models where the button on the handle was
Castiel rummaged through the drawer behind the counter, finding a slender blade.  He slit the tip of his finger, pulling Sydney’s head up with his other hand and forcing the dribbling blood against the younger man’s slack lips.

over a Dom using him?  Which only shifted his mind back to how little Azazel and Michael had touched him like this.  Comfort wasn’t something they had ever given him.  After Michael had punished him with the cuffs, he’d said nothing.  No apology.  No explanation.  He’d merely uncuffed Dean and then fucked him until he was too sore to move.
“Up the —?”  Squinting, Castiel looked and frowned.  The guardpost?  “Why’d he do that?”  He couldn’t hear anything above.  It was still suffocatingly quiet around him.  He was going to shoot the asshole, though.
The man scowled at his drink.  “You stuck your face in that, didn’t you?”  He sighed and picked up the glass, peering at it.  “Twit.”
“Great dinner, Jess.  I’ll catch ya later,” he tossed off, not looking back at his brother as he left the house.  He knew he overreacted.  He had that issue.  Especially with family.  In a way, he thought he knew why.
Shutting off his car, he dug out his phone and searched the web, looking for the bookstore’s number.  He found it and dialed, feeling his heart pound as he did.
Castiel halted, craning his neck to meet Dean’s eyes.  “I told you,” he murmured, “not up for negotiation at the moment.”  He reached out, stroking Dean’s cheek.  “Eventually, yes.  But . . . not now.”
“Hell, the Impala practically drives herself home,” he retorted with a wink.  The slyness faded and the sad smile from before returned.  “Thanks again, Cas.  This was . . . real nice.”
"Be quiet," he muttered.  He spread a thick paste of antibiotic cream on the wound and pressed a sterile bandage down, before wrapping gauze snuggly against his arm.  All the while, Dean wriggled and grunted, the chain of the cuffs clattering.
Castiel regretted leaving Dean in handcuffs seconds after the food arrived.  He set his own aside, leaving to be reheated later, and held out the other toward Dean.
Castiel surged into his lap, swallowing Dean’s surprised grunt as he kissed him desperately.  “Yes!  Of course, it is!”  Dean’s skin was warm and wet underneath him and he squirmed happily.  He moaned into Dean’s mouth, trying to speak all the things that he regretted and needed and wanted, yelping when Dean rolled him over again.
“Darling, you’re writing sex.  There isn’t much to change,” he pointed out, raising an eyebrow.  “Or are you wishing to branch elsewhere?”
– more a parent to his brother Sam than John was.  Watching him, careful, guarded.  He remembered Dean muttering about how he’d gotten Sam killed.  Which was impossible.  From what he knew, Sam was still alive.  Maybe a memory he’d muddled in a drunken haze?  But now, he understood why that had been so terrible.  How much it must have hurt him to leave his brother in the first place.  To be this
to understand.  But here, in the tiny room, he felt like he could say nearly anything to this strange man.
we have sex, I want you pliant.  I want you enjoying it.  To do so now would be unpleasant for you.”
Bobby picked up on the second ring, his gruff hello music to Castiel’s ears.  “We have a situation,” Castiel began.  He peered at Benny.  Now would be the time to blow Benny’s supposed cover.  Castiel found he didn’t quite care at the moment.  He had more pressing matters to attend to.
“You think others haven’t come here?” Castiel snapped.  He sat up straighter, startling Dean.  “All of us, at one time or another, have been threatened.
“Ropes, hm?”  Castiel’s hand was still sure and slow on his neck, massaging gently.  “I think, I’d be delighted to grant you that.”  He dropped a warm, sweet kiss to Dean’s temple.  “When you are ready, we’ll test ropes.  I know how cuffs trigger you.”
Dean wasn’t happy about this.  At all.  It wasn’t fear he carried but a sense of despair.  The dark that ate at him as Sydney had hinted.  The bravado he unleased was nothing more than a cover; Castiel was certain of it.  He wanted this past of his gone!  That had to be it!
Oh, that.  Castiel smiled.  “My spells are that of protection and defense.  Part of that is . . . holistic, I suppose.”  He tapped Dean’s forehead.  “I sped up your metabolism and boosted your electrolytes to ease the absorption.”
why I called you over this morning.”  He placed the book in his hand on the shelf and grinned again.  “Good thing you have a
Dean stared at the offered item, his face way too hot at the moment.  “Oh.  Um, thanks,” he mumbled.  He slipped the sweatshirt on and nearly moaned at the soft warmth and the goddamn scent of the guy.
He went on, his hands still holding Dean’s.  “I suggest, if you’re willing, that we start slow.  A date once a week, just to get used to each other.”  He grinned.  “You may come to find I’m far too annoying for you.”
Castiel purred and snickered in his ear as Dean all but dragged them to the door.  “I couldn’t agree more.”

spilling in its wake.  He stiffened and dug deeper, eyes wide as he watched a man pound his way up the road, chest heaving and teeth bared.
Dean’s grin faded a bit.  “Look, little guy.  You can’t be here, all right?  You . . . it’s better for you to go home.”  He straightened, pointing at the window a second time.  “Glad you enjoyed the whiskey.  But don’t come back.”
Dean swallowed.  He tried not to meet the man’s eyes but it was difficult.  They were bright and narrow and entirely too focused on him.  ”A-actually,” he husked, “it … they’re supposed to be a … gag gift.  For my brother.  Bachelor party tonight,” he added, finally breaking the spell this man, Castiel, seemed to have on him.
Dean’s eyes widened, startled out of their passion-fueled haze before softening again.  He kissed Castiel then, mouthing his thanks silently, his hands sliding under Castiel’s back.  Pulling out as slow as he’d pushed in, Dean surged forward with a grunt, rocking them both atop the bed.  Castiel howled in pleasure, his thighs tightening against Dean’s sides as the man began thrusting fast and hard.
” he snapped, face flaming red.  They were at a garage, it looked like.  A poorly used one, from the look of things.  One busted light that buzzed and snapped.  The door on the garage hung crazily.
He turned, sipping at his coffee as he did.  Balthazar, his contact in London, pointed at the black and white bank of screens in front of him.  ”I have a feeling you know this man?”
Castiel smiled weakly, trying to ignore how pleasant it felt to have Dean’s hands on him.  He swallowed, blushing a second time.  “I … should uncuff you,” he rasped.  He couldn’t move though.  Dean
Dean didn’t answer immediately.  When he did, his voice dripped with lusty humor.  ”Damn, I should’ve introduced myself sooner.”
He halted, finding Castiel barefoot on the pavement next to him, concern in the dark eyes.  “Er, yeah?”
“Time to take stock, boys,” Benny crowed.  He opened the back door of the car and chuckled.  “Well, well.  Didn’t know ya’ll knew each other
He nearly smiled at that.  Sam might not demand he switch over but he would do his best to remind Dean not to drive himself – literally – to exhaustion.  He shrugged, even as his stomach gnawed at his spine.  “Yeah, I could eat.”
He opened his eyes then, fully awake.  Faint and sonorous, he made out Castiel’s familiar morning singing.  Never words, just sound, low and soft but easily discerned.  He usually liked pretending to be asleep for a while, listening.  Castiel was a surprise in more than one way.  First, he’d never know a fairy could appear human-size.  Eventually, Castiel had shown him the bracelet he wore, a charm worked by a hedge witch to keep him human.  Second, he didn’t know he could fall for one.
If they knew I was a hunter, ya’ll would gut me in seconds.”  The sneer filled Dean’s voice again.  The look on his face ugly and dark.  “I know what you all are.  I know about the vampire twins and that kid.  The shapeshifter.  The fucking werewolf.”  Glaring, he added, “What makes you think I’m not here to finish the job for those other hunters?”
manage the unmanageable and brought someone home to his bedroom, the basics of sex would suddenly slip out of his mind and he was nothing but fumbling fingers and stupid comments.  Carrying on conversations with total strangers was the last thing he wanted.
“I don’t want to lead you on,” Dean admitted, finally meeting his gaze.  “I know we’ve only had one date and all . . . but, I, uh, like you.  A lot.”  Dean almost seemed amazed at the idea.  He glanced once toward Castiel before clearing his throat again, shifting nervously in his seat.  “I’m just being honest; I’m kind of crap at this.”
He trudged up the steps and knocked lightly, the door swinging open.  Castiel’s warm smile barely made a dent in his depression, though he forced an answering grin all the same.  “Good evening, Dean,” he murmured.  He stepped back, gesturing for Dean to walk inside.  “I don’t believe you’ve been in my house yet, have you?” he asked, eyebrow quirked.
men, he began to look at James’ stories in a different light.  Hot, for sure, but the characters were so real and engaging, he often found himself skipping over the dirtier scenes just to get to the plot.
true.  Tiny things altered.  Dean still hadn’t slept with Castiel.  That, clearly, wouldn’t happen any time soon though Dean’s anxiety flared more often at the continued celibacy.  Thankfully, on the dates themselves, Dean ended up far calmer than he’d been in a long while.  Which only left him flustered when he thought back on his personal history with men and women.
One Friday, without any real work needing to be done, Castiel realized he was journeying to the coffee so late at night for nothing more than a brief glimpse of the brunet officer.  Having that pop into his head only made him feel ridiculous.  Still, he peddled his way to the shop with nothing but a paperback novel this time.  Might as well cease pretending he was doing work.
“It’s nice,” he murmured, intimidated by the look of it all.  Was Castiel secretly wealthy?  He clearly did well with his shop but did it pay that much?  Maybe sex toys were a hobby.
No, what ate at him was how great the sex seemed to be in his books when he himself was hopeless in bed.  Clumsy and awkward and saying the wrong things at the wrong time.  No wonder he was single.  His last fling hadn’t lasted more than a handful of weeks.  Maybe he just needed a break.  He said as much to Balthazar.
Whether from tears or the rain itself, Castiel had trouble seeing as he drove back down Dean’s road.  He rubbed at his eyes, the wipers hissing rapidly under the sudden deluge.  Halfway down the road, he slammed on the brakes, his car sliding sideways.  Hands on the steering wheel, he sucked in air, shaking and horrified.
tattoos.  He rolled his eyes as he walked to his car.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  He’d forget.  Knowing him, he’d start stalking Dean after all this, further worsening his pathetic life.  He wouldn’t be able to go back to being the phantom
Dean managed a weak smile, nodding.  Well, now was the time.  Castiel would probably give him directions to his house . . . or maybe he’d just take Dean in his car?  It wasn’t working the way he’d expected and he was a bit turned around, trying to guess the next step.  He blinked in surprise when the Impala’s door opened and Castiel swung around to slide out.
Dean considered it.  It would be a grand enough gesture to give anyone pause.  But, Dean didn’t like the idea of being the one to force such an event.  He shrugged.  “Cas, it ain’t necessary.  I forgave you, okay?”
“I’m sorry,” he stated.  He saw Dean’s eyes widen in astonishment.  He pointed to his car.  “I read the journal.  What was there.”  Frankly, what
The logging road?  That had been closed for years due to suspicious disappearances and the like.  Not to mention Castiel’s folk taking active steps to keep humans away.  A nexus of the supernatural.  He’d run into a more than one spectral form while in his adolescence.  He had to wonder how Dean was able to withstand the nuisance that was the fairy realm.  Or maybe they hadn’t bothered to attack him as yet.  “Oh,” he breathed.  “That place is –“
For the first time, Dean saw true anger on Castiel’s face.  He slammed the book in his hand down on the counter and snapped, “Enough!  I don’t owe you
Dean reared back in his chair, hands clenched.  “Uh.  No.  It … I … I got it under control.  He’s just …” he looked at Castiel.  “He’s just … got the wrong idea.”
He considered the idea as he followed the other two men to their table.  Things did change in people’s lives as they grew older but if Kevin had worked at Gabriel’s company while in college, it was really only about five years ago.  That . . . shit, unless the guy had a stroke or something and completely flipped personality-wise.  Weird, but possible.
Everyone expected sex in a relationship.  Fact of life, and all that.  So why did Castiel keep avoiding it?  That part Dean couldn’t get his head around.  His assurances that it was for Dean’s benefit only confused him more.  Granted, they weren’t a
He shook his head.  “A week or so ago.  Just after, um . . .” he waved vaguely.  Castiel had told Sydney on one of his recent visits of the breakup, though he was surprised Dean had hired the vampire so quickly after spitting vitriol about being a hunter.  All the more reason to fight against Dean’s supposed desire for solitude.
Dean winked.  “Sure.”  The door chimes rang and both men turned to see a young woman walk in.  “Uh, sorry.  I should get to work, Gabe.  I’ll call you later tonight or tomorrow, all right?”  He waved, turning away to address the new customer.
Castiel was freaky smart, too.  Almost every damn story Dean presented, Castiel had some interesting factoid to add to it.  To the point that Dean typically ran his copy by Castiel before submitting it for review.  It helped that the little nerd was a walking encyclopedia.  Though, it often led to unintentionally humorous incidences where crass jokes soared about a mile over the man’s head.
"You think that will get him to let his guard down?" Dean sneered.  He fidgeted, bracelets jangling.  "You keep me like this for too long, Alastair might do something."
“You found me, huh?”  He grinned, callous and feral.  “Think that makes you tough?  You’re gonna regret that.”
do something so callous again.”  He clutched at Dean’s shirt.  “To watch you walk out, I realized what I’d done but fear of my father . . . I wanted to run after you.  I did.  Please believe me.”
He scrubbed at his eyes, groaning slightly.  God, what a mess.  He’d just wanted to do his job but then Dean had poked his damn head into his life.  And somewhere along the way, Castiel had started looking forward to the constant taunting.  But, with Dean now a free man, did they even have a real connection any longer?  Probably not given how quickly Dean had fled.  Probably happy to be rid of all things criminal.
Right.  Sierra.  He lifted his head to glare at the animal in question.  The cub appeared unconcerned, a pink tongue stuck out from her mouth in a perpetual raspberry.  He pointed at the animal, eyebrows raised.  “She’s an overgrown housecat.”  However, he let Castiel lace their fingers together and lead him toward said monster.
Silent now, Dean switched seats with Sam, pausing at the passenger door.  He stared behind him, the inky night a blanket of silence under the buzzing pop of tired neon.  He dropped his gaze and slid back into the Impala, cradling his coffee.
Well, maybe halfway to nowhere.  He understood Castiel’s motivations a bit better.  And given his background, he believed the Castiel posing as Gabriel still really
before.”  The arm still looped around Castiel’s back shifted and Dean’s warm palm slid past the waistband of his slacks, untucking his shirt before moving to cup his ass.  “This?” he husked, squeezing once.  “I’m going to
Castiel was into him.  Dean might not be a genius when it came to human behavior but he’d seen the looks.  The cute, dazed expressions.  This whole fiasco as a result of it, wasn’t it?  But now, seeing Castiel’s fear, he had to wonder.
Dean shook his head so violently he thought his neck would snap.  He grabbed Castiel around the waist and hauled him close, kissing him.  Well,
Not thinking, Castiel immediately dropped his face into the amber liquid, sputtering when it burned down his throat and nose.  He fluttered and dashed about just as Dean approached.
what I wanted from you?”  He worked at Dean quickly, panting, adding a third finger.  He couldn’t take much more.  He needed to be inside this man.
Against his better judgment, Castiel snickered at the last.  He didn’t fight when Dean untangled them.  The other man swiped a thumb along Castiel’s cheek, smiling warmly.  “I know your name is Castiel Novak.  I know that mine’s Dean Winchester.”  He grinned.  “I think that’s a damn good start; don’t you?”
He was there for their pleasure.  That was it.  If he didn’t know any better, he’d think Castiel actually
Dean blinked.  Why would Castiel have anything to be sorry for?  It was Dean who always managed to miss what his Dom needed.
In the bedroom, he found a pair of sleeping pants and a t-shirt.  He eyed both items in confusion.  Dean would have left all this behind?  Was that what he did?  Just abandon everything and try again?  He shook his head.  “Not this time,” he murmured, returning to Dean’s slumbering form and shoving him into the clean clothes.
He smiled a bit.  Not only that, but he had to admit he was a bit more interested in Gabriel.  Over email, the guy had come off as a bit of a letch.  That kind of creepy flirty where one always felt a need to shower after.  But face-to-face, the guy was awkward and . . . well, cute.  Definitely cute.  Hot?  Yeah, hot.  Gabriel was hot with the bright blue eyes and messy dark hair.  He’d looked like a deer caught in headlights when in Dean’s store, all stuttering and twitching like a druggie on withdrawal.
Dean grinned, pausing for a moment to check his ass in the mirror.  Probably a bad sign.  Maybe.  He didn’t actually know if James preferred men but flirting never hurt anyone, right?  Satisfied, he clicked off the bedroom light and headed for the living room, saying, “You’d miss it if I didn’t.”
Castiel breathed out, the sound shaky.  “I’m relieved.”  He leaned in, resting his forehead on Dean’s shoulder.  “I promise you, Dean, I will
“No!” Dean blurted.  He reddened, glancing at Castiel repeatedly as he headed for the drive-in.  Jesus Christ.  The things coming out of Dean’s mouth.  Fuck, it just twisted and twisted until it was too sharp to rein in.  He swallowed rapidly, trying to calm his racing heart.  “Michael . . . didn’t care.  Neither did Azazel,” he added.  The steering wheel squeaked under his hands as he gripped it.  “You’re . . . you’re just supposed to want to fuck me, Cas.  Not talk to me.”
Charlie slipped into the room and shut the door, still grinning.  “So.  I have this friend.  He waits tables at this cute little bistro downtown.”
Charlie laughs. “We have three hours, we’ll be fine.” She tosses a ball up in the air; Dean catches it with his mouth.
”Castiel, my friend. It’s been a while since we’ve seen you around.” Castiel only stares at his feet.
"Yes. I do not remember my father, he left when I was very young. My mother told me about him, but I always felt as if..." Castiel furrows his brow, as if he can't quite find the right words. Luckily, Sam can.
, just barely. In just a moment, he becomes aware that someone is standing very close to him. His entire body feels too heavy to act on the sudden pull of fear in his stomach.
Castiel pauses, moving a bishop out onto the playing field. Somewhere across the room, Gabriel is purring loudly.
Parking is a non-issue: no one comes ever comes on a Monday. The wind stings their bare skin when they step out of the car. Sam pulls his jacket tighter around himself. Dean grabs the flowers from the front seat, cursing when the thorns stab at his fingertips.
Dean now?  He squints.  "Why ya laughin'?"  Dean's telling the truth.  He doesn't really want Pretty Voice.  Pretty Voice would just be
Dean shook his head.  “You touched my vessel and connected yourself to me in that instant.  When you did possess it, you did the same to me.  You gave up the vase and gave me up at the same time.  You broke my contract.  You severed my servitude to Hell.”
Pushing away from the door, Castiel stalked across the room toward Dean.  “Did you kiss me because you wanted me?  Or to distract me?”  He scowled, his confusion from the last week surging out in an exasperated sigh.  “Is this a game to you?”
He walked the three blocks to the train station, new shoes pinching his heels, waistcoat about an inch shy of too tight.  He tugged on his tie again, blowing out a harsh breath.  He could do this.  Shit, he was a
“Honesty’s a good look on you, Cas.”  He leaned in, sucking long and slow on the side of Castiel’s neck.  His voice thrummed against wet, hot skin.  “You don’t need to prove a fucking
Castiel fidgeted.  “No,” he repeated, drawing the word out.  “I don’t really need to.  I mean, wouldn’t you be embarrassed to have a book of . . .
Setting his phone back down, he squirmed, jostling them both on the bed.  He bit his lip at the sudden jolt of pleasure as he groin made contact with Dean’s chin.  Dean sat up abruptly and Castiel squawked as he fell off the bed with a thud.
Dean clucked his tongue as he trotted to the small desk, digging into the top drawer.  A few seconds of searching and he made a noise of triumph.  A condom and a bottle of lube; Castiel immediately ignored what that meant in the day-to-day.  “See, it pays to be prepared.  But, before you freak out, I don’t bring people back here as a rule.”
, he admitted.  But he’d seen truth in Dean’s warm eyes.  And if what had happened was reality, it was his duty to help Dean.  He’d found the vase after all.  Abandoning Dean after that would make him no better than the damned souls he’d collected over the years.
His eyes shut, the room dark and warm, filled with the scent of sex and sweat.  Lips on his forehead.  And more words he couldn’t hear.  Before he slipped into slumber, he thought he heard the sadness in them.  Felt their ache.
He still had Castiel’s card.  His supposed private number.  A charity case, maybe?  Or maybe he wanted to remind Dean of how a sub was supposed to act.  He fidgeted in front of his laptop, toying with the card, the numbers so stark against the clean white surface.  Maybe that’s why he was so uncomfortable.  Maybe he was just postponing the inevitable punishment.  The
Making a decision, he pushed off the chair, slipping down the hall to find Dean puttering in his bedroom, now dressed in boxers and an old t-shirt.  He flew to the man’s bowed head and tugged on his earlobe, startling him.
was James and just give Dean the out.  Let the whole thing end before this all got worse.  Even if Dean was sweet.  And charming.  And handsome.  And . . . shit.
Naked and inside him.  That’s all he wanted in that moment.  He kicked out of his shoes and slacks, still working at Dean’s pants as he did.  He didn’t even react to Dean’s amused snort, shoving the tight denim of Dean’s hips as soon as he remember how a damn zipper worked.
It didn’t exactly surprise Castiel that he slept like shit following his meeting with Dean.  Hard to get any rest when one’s brain moved in circles like a busted lawnmower.
Dean shrugged, focusing on his burger.  “He’s just a friend, remember?  I’m not . . . anything to him.”  Even as he said it, he felt a jab of pain in his gut, like he’d suddenly betrayed Castiel.  But it was true.  Castiel might have given him the name ‘pet’ but that’s all Dean was.  They’d kissed and touched but . . . well, once Castiel fucked him, that would be it.  He’d be patted on the back and sent on his way, ready for the next man to take control.  His burger turned to ash in his mouth but he kept chewing, if only to keep his mouth occupied.
Castiel scowled and sank into his seat as Balthazar drove them to the restaurant.  ”I wouldn’t put it that way,” he muttered.  ”He’s … he’s a bit of an asshole and likes to annoy me,” he stated finally.
Didn’t change much when it came to his personal life, either.  His house had been an old fixer-upper.  Nothing spectacular.  Just three bedrooms and a postage stamp of a lawn.  But it was all his, now.  Paid off and redone
Balthazar leaned back, clucking his tongue.  “And that’s that, hm?”  He slapped Castiel’s leg through the blankets, startling him.  “If I don’t hear that you’ve tracked the lad down, I’ll think you an utter failure, Cassie.”
Dean’s heart buzzed and burned in his ears and he thought he might pass out from the sudden flood of desire.  “S-sir?”  His imagination bubbled and if anything, his erection only worsened.  Going home and stroking himself off and sending the proof to Castiel?  He’d never done anything like that with either Azazel or Michael and that alone left him eager.  To know that perhaps, a week or a month from now, Castiel could open his phone and see Dean naked and spent made him swallow hard to stop the whimper of delight.
And while Dean had tried to drop hints about his interest, Castiel seemed utterly oblivious or was doing that loyal thing dudes did to other dudes when they weren’t interested in dick.  Which sucked.  Dean really hoped it was simply Castiel being oblivious but six years of crushing on tall, dark, and dorky was wearing him down.
Dean stared at him and blurted, “Dean Winchester.  I’m a cop.  Thought you were high.  I’m running on like six hours of sleep from the last week and I’m pretty sure I’m going to start seeing little green men in the walls.”  He clapped his mouth shut as well as his eyes.
"Nah, I told Sam I was going to do this, though.  So he wouldn’t be surprised."  Dean cupped Castiel’s face with one hand, thumb stroking his bottom lip.  "But, I do love you, Cas.  Have for years."
“Oh, shit.  Wait.  You’re not into guys, are you?”  He slapped a hand to his forehead.  “Dude, I’m so sorry!”  He sighed.  “I guess that was pretty boneheaded of me,” he muttered, reaching up to take his lunch.
man.  But it did finally confirm his suspicions regarding the strangeness of Dean’s home, as well as Sydney’s fears.  If he’d been a hunter, he understood protection against the supernatural.  Charms and wards and God knew what else.
He took a step from the door, halting when Dean’s eyes narrowed.  “My father is a renowned psychologist.  And for as rational as his career is, he himself tends to border on the opposite.”  He began to pace, arms still folded at his middle.  “He willingly speaks at religious conferences on the idea of
’  He told me to grow up and if I dared to bring it into the house, I was on my ass.”  He trembled.  “I was
They agreed on dinner together at a local restaurant the following Tuesday.  To say that Dean was nervous as hell for the next three days would have been an understatement.  He grew snappish at work, often dropping tools in his clumsiness.  Bobby had reprimanded him more than once for it and Dean only flinched, thinking it a terrible sign of what was to come.  It was with great relief he left the auto shop that afternoon, hurrying home to change into something pleasant for Castiel.
Dean breathed fast and low, eyes shut again.  ”Th-thanks, Cas,” he managed.  Lifting his head, he opened his eyes.  ”And the cuffs?”
Just as his lips brushed Dean, he yelped a second time, thrown sideways, falling to the floor or the car, one leg still on Dean.  He blinked rapidly, looking up into startled green.  They were stopped, apparently.  Though, it would have been kind of Benny to warn them.
now and Castiel only cared for that.  The rest belonged in the past that had injured the man so terribly.
Taking a breath, Dean nodded.  “Yeah, I did.  I mean, there are other sound guys so people probably won’t think it’s you if you’re not interested and I don’t mean to make things awkward for you so – mmph!”
“We live here because . . . we’re unable to be around those we once trusted.  Our own kind would kills us.”  He swallowed again.  “Dean, you could have a home here with us.”
The man peeked at him through his fingers and nodded cautiously.  ”I … altered my route one day because of construction.  And … noticed you.”  Even under the dark sky and with only Dean’s garage light to illuminate things, he could see the man’s flushed face.  Those bright blue eyes.  Damn, he'd thought them bright in passing but now they glowed like gas lamps.  ”I, um, might have been … um, continued with this longer route on purpose.”
is not a man you wish to cross.”  He leaned away from the hostess and whispered, “Crowley Morgan does not often forget slights to his character or property.”
Fingers slipped away and Castiel shivered, feeling air on his wet skin.  And then that hard, blunt head, resting against his opening.  Dean’s hands on his hips, digging in hard, holding him steady.  And then . . .
Rest of the precinct?  He squints again and the flash of headlights going by illuminates a far too familiar face.
“Shit,” Dean muttered, all flirtation gone as his gaze dropped down.  He crossed the room, kneeling down beside Castiel, startling him.  His fingers were gentle and quick against his stitched side.  “I’m sorry,” he murmured.  “This was my fault.”
The familiar head-tilt.  The lift of the eyebrow.  Man, if Dean hadn’t been so damn blitzed, he’d probably still get to see that on a daily basis.  But now he’s likely to get the send-off; since it’s Castiel, it’s going to be a
Castiel’s fingers and palms found every one of Dean’s knots and worked them out, leaving them buttery and hot.  Castiel asked a question now and again, something inane, and Dean could barely remember to make a noise of assent.  He drifted, focused on Castiel’s touch and the pleasant buzz it left in his flesh.
Hoo boy.  Totally didn't mean to go two months without an update.  Things are still somewhat tumultuous for me in my personal life but I'm trying to get back into the swing of things.  I do hope this was worth the wait.
the angel said to him.  He’d known the bugger for over a decade and hadn’t managed to parse half of what came out of Castiel’s mouth.  He cleared his throat, hiding the smile.  Could be worse things, he supposed.  At least he could count on Castiel’s cryptic nature.
shit.  “O-oh, I don’t know,” he began, tugging at a loose thread in his jeans.  “It’s . . . um . . . James’ favorite?”  Well, not
Shifting from foot to foot and wringing his hands, Castiel blurted, “He’s really pretty and I said something stupid and now you need to be me.”
”  Castiel’s dream-voice surged through him and he whimpered, envisioning the eagerness in which he’d swallow the man’s cock.  Feel it slide hard and rough across his tongue.  That wonderful sour-sweet taste forced into his throat.  Choking his air, tears in his eyes and spit trickling past his lips.
A few people knew that Dean was bi.  Sam, Bobby, and of course, Charlie.  But Dean never had been explicit about it.  He’d thankfully flown under the radar of the more close-minded folk in their town but didn’t mean he wanted his relationship – whatever it was – with Castiel pumped all over the place.  He rubbed his forehead and started pacing again.  “Charlie, he’s . . . just a guy,” he lied.
about Dean.  What he hated.  What he loved.  Songs that got stuck in his head.  What side of the bed he slept on.  Just all that stupid nonsense couples could rattle off.  He wanted that and he’d ruined any chance of it the minute he’d stated he was Gabriel.
With a dramatic sigh, Dean lifted a hand, tangling it in Castiel’s sweat-dampened hair.  He grinned and pulled him down for another kiss.  “Guess you’ll just have to teach me what is,” he murmured, licking his way back into Castiel’s mouth.
“Sierra came to me this morning.  Her mother died.  Just last night.  A . . . thing found her.  Sierra was frightened but knew a fairy lived here.”  He leaned over her, crooning and trilling, placing a quick kiss on her head.  "So, she lives here now.“
A hiss of wind and he jumped, striking his head against the window.  “Fuck!  Cas, goddammit!”  He rubbed at his head, squinting at the angel.  “Shit, warn a guy.”
Not that he could say that.  How foolish would it be for him to admit to a wanted criminal that, ideally, he wanted nothing more than to let him run rampant if only to keep chasing him.  The tease.  It was all in that damn tease and those green eyes and that charming grin.
He sighed and flipped through his cookbook, deciding on a lasagna for dinner.  He hadn’t made it in a while and it always made plenty for leftovers.  Content, he left the house, locking the door and heading out for the short walk to the market.  The air was still wet with threatening rain and the sky gray and overcast; though he loved these days.  Loved the freshness that waited just out of reach.  The renewal that fell from the sky in loving drops of liquid.
Castiel whimpered and shut his eyes, overcome.  “What are you doing to me?” he whispered, gripping one of Dean’s hands where it landed on his hip.  His breath shivered and shook through his chest, competing with the speed of his heart in violence.  He’d written about men growing dizzy with lust.  He’d
“Uh, yup,” Dean replied awkwardly, shrugging James’ hand off.  He turned again to Gabriel, trying to hide the shudder he felt.  As the waiter left with Gabriel’s credit card, Dean asked, “You want me to pay for any of this?”
Dean shook his head frantically.  No, this was a mistake.  His sign to go.  He should have stayed away.  Not come back to this place and its tempting owner.  He began to turn, halting immediately when he heard a familiar voice call out, “Dean?”
It took a moment for the words to sink in.  At first, Dean thought he’d misheard.  Or read what he’d wanted into the brush off.  But they sped through his head again, all quiet sincerity.  Dean stared at the wall opposite, stunned.  He opened his mouth twice, trying to form some question or comment but words failed him.  Castiel . . . wanted him?
The nerve.  Drunk or not, Dean can fuck like a damn champion.  And Pretty Voice has that pretty face to go with it.  Probably a pretty ass.  He tries to see but it's too dark and Pretty Voice is wearing dark clothing.  Guy's tall; always a plus.  Maybe a little thinner than Dean?  Goddammit though; why does he look familiar?
to be whiskey.  He took a huge swallow of the liquor, sputtering with light and sound at the sudden burn.  He shimmered brighter when he caught Dean’s amused chuckle.
sat here.  Almost every lunch.  And my day’s been so … just … why …”  With a groan, he gave up, letting his head hit the tree.
said signing.  Which really only put him right back to square one with Gabriel, doomed to start the whole damn thing over again with another bookstore owner.
Castiel swallowed, mesmerized by slick skin.  His gaze flicked up to Dean’s and he was surprised to see the same want and need echoed in the dark green.  “You are a pain in my side,” he rasped.
Relieved that he could be rid of this subject, Dean waved away the comment and steered their conversation to the wedding itself.  Once Sam was on that subject, he seemed to have forgotten his heart-felt plea to Dean.
Sweat trickled down his neck as he breathed, watching Dean grunt beneath him.  Beautiful.  Dean was beautiful.  Gorgeous strength so desperately, tightly controlled.  His neck exposed, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed.  His chest rising and falling rapidly, no doubt covered with a beautiful flush of red skin.  But his touch remained gentle on Castiel’s hips, fingers shaking as though fearful of harming him.
“I think you’re overthinking things,” Balthazar chided.  “You’re awkward, yes, but it’s rather adorable at times.”  He grinned at Castiel’s irritated scowl.  “Castiel, you should want to meet your fans.  It’s the decent thing to do.”
The officer smirked.  ”I ain’t standing in this rain for my health, you know?”  He gestured to a car nearby, a sleek black thing shining with water.
Dean exploded over his fingers with a pained gasp, half rising out of his chair as he did.  He shivered and shook, fingers trembling, come spattering his hand and the edge of his desk.  What little ecstasy he took from the fantasy soured immediately and he swallowed, feeling hollow.
On Sunday, while finishing up the setup for the signing the next day, he did the unthinkable:  he called Balthazar.
And he doubted he’d find out why anytime soon.  But maybe, with repeated visits, he could get Dean to talk?  Even a little?  Whatever he held onto, ate at him.
You aren’t this stubborn, are you?”  He lifted his foot and nudged Castiel’s leg this time.  “By this time next week, I had better receive a postcard stating you’ve fucked that sexy scamp.”  He popped out of his chair with a wink and grin.  “Or I might have to beat you to it.”
He held his face in his hands, sighing.  He wasn’t really all that angry any longer.  Simply . . . sad.  He dropped one hand, resting his head on the other and stared at his phone, wondering what it would hurt to just say ‘hi’ or something.  Nothing that would let Castiel know he was off the hook but just enough to show Dean hadn’t written him off just yet.  He tapped the pencil in his hand, the staccato soon too much for him to bear in his office.
was a man who wouldn’t fuck him.  A man who would walk away sooner rather than later.  And even knowing that, he couldn’t stop the desire and want that coursed through him whenever he laid eyes on Castiel.
He stared at the ceiling for a bit longer before he heard someone clear their throat.  He looked over, finding a man not much older than him in a suit, holding a manila folder.
Like the other dudes he's banged recently.  If Dean's going to be nice enough to offer, Pretty Voice should be more impressed.  But now he's being a jerk and Dean's not feeling so charitable.  Even though the guy smells like tasty things and has those gorgeous eyes.
Well, that was sure as shit helpful.  Dean smirked, leaning forward on his elbows.  “Well, hey; give Kevin my number.  Maybe, if this dinner goes kind of shit, I can use the leverage later.”  Hopefully, it wouldn’t.  His smirk softened again as he thought of those bright, wide eyes and the disheveled look of the publisher.  If he was lucky, this whole thing would go smooth as silk and he’d end up getting to know Gabriel a bit better.  He hadn’t bothered to find out if the guy owned a house in the area or anything.  Long-distance was always tricky.
Now that some of the angst had left the building, Dean resumed his earlier tact.  He let go of Castiel and folded his arms over his chest, leering somewhat in the shadows.  “You will be there, won’t you?  At the signing?”
He . . . didn’t deny it.  Shifting from foot to foot, Castiel gripped his mug.  “O-oh.  Okay.”  So, now what?  He’d expected Dean to take it all back but the man seemed pleased instead.  That couldn’t be right.  It all had to be so wrong.
Still resting his head on one folded arm, he stretched out and clumsily tapped the store’s name into Google.  Huh.  Two years old.  Down on Main Street.  Alt-bookstore.  Well, it explained why he’d want Castiel there.  It would have been strange to find out some little grandmother’s store wanted a well-known erotica writer to show up.  He tried to see if there was anything mentioned about the owner but no such luck.
