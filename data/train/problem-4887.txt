In response, in recompense, Mr. Stark beams at him. It's not the smile he wears for the press. This one is more real. This is the truth.
He still doesn't know what he's going to say to Mr. Stark, if Mr. Stark is there too -- and why wouldn't he be? It's his workshop. Maybe Mr. Stark has to upgrade the armor. Maybe that's why Iron Man keeps disappearing, every night, in such a hurry. He did it last night, too, excusing himself fast; there hadn't been a lot of time for kissing, although Steve's honestly not sure that any amount of time could be enough. Iron Man's an incredibly good kisser.
"Me too." Steve's voice was hoarse. "There's also the part where until last week I thought you were straight, so I definitely wasn't going to tell you how I felt. And then I found out you weren't straight, but it really wasn't a good time to tell you that I wasn't either."
Tony's mouth was now pulled to one side. "Way to bury the lede, Winghead," he muttered, and God, Tony hadn't called him that in days, had he? Tony looked down at himself, abashed, and back up. He glanced around the room. "You wouldn't happen to know where my clothes are, would you?"
So he couldn't say anything to Carol. It would have been nice to be able to confide in her. He would probably have felt better for it. But he absolutely couldn't.
It's answers like these that make Steve think he has some kind of chance with Iron Man, even though he knows nothing about him.
Steve, bless him, stops instantly, which makes Tony feel a whole lot better about doing this. He tilts his head to the side, confused; his eyes narrow and his face starts to close off, his smile fading as he reaches entirely the wrong conclusion.
Watching him in silence, Tony took a few wobbling steps backward and sat down hard in the middle of Steve's couch. At least Steve didn't have to worry about him falling over anymore.
Tony's eyes went wide and impossibly dark at the same time, his pupils dilating, edged with the thinnest ring of blue. He was gorgeous. Steve had never seen him like this, and he could look at him forever. His face was flushed, reddening across his cheekbones. His lips were ever so slightly. Steve couldn't stop staring at his mouth. Tony's indrawn gasp was the loudest sound in the room.
That sure wasn't anything Tiberius had been known for. He'd clawed his way to the top on a pile of bodies -- more literally than most people knew. He'd been charming, but he'd also been cutthroat. Ruthless. That was the impression he'd given Steve, in the media and in person.
"All I could think," Tony says, "was that you were going to die because of me. It was up to me. Your life was in my hands. You know I had a clear shot on him, right? Headshot. At that distance I could have made it, if it had been any other day. I could have made it if my hands hadn't been shaking. If I hadn't been terrified."
The elevator started to slow. Steve could feel his muscles coiling into readiness, tensing for battle, as he brought the shield up. He'd spent half his life doing this. He was going to get Tony back, and everything was going to be okay. He knew how to run a standard search pattern. He'd go in, shield first, and clear every room until he found Tony. He had this.
"Hi," Tony said. His voice was hoarse. Steve wasn't sure which of them he was talking to; he wasn't looking at either of them. "I'm sorry, I know you're both probably busy. I just had a quick question. Team-leader kind of question. But if now's not a good time, I can go." He wobbled a little and leaned more of his weight on the doorframe. He looked like he was about thirty seconds from hitting the floor face-first.
Steve waited until Thor was out of sight to let go of Tony's waist, at which point he unslung his shield and balanced it on his arm. "You ready, Shellhead?"
None of this is what Steve wants to hear, but that's not the important part. The important part is keeping Tony on as much of an even keel as he can. Tony has to survive this. That's Steve's primary objective.
Steve reached up and ran his knuckles over Tony's cheekbone. He was here. Maybe that would help. "I know," Steve said again. "Like I said, I know it's not personal. I know it's not me you're afraid of. And if you don't want anything right now, I get that. But if you do, I'd really like to make you feel good. No obligations attached. Doesn't have to be my mouth, if you don't want. As far as I'm concerned, I'd be happy to just keep kissing you and you can keep, uh, doing exactly what you were doing."
But Iron Man shakes his head. "It's not that," he says. "Steve, I-- I love you too. I've loved you for so, so long. There aren't even words for how happy you make me." He pauses. "But it's not going to last. I'm not an easy man to love. Everyone leaves me. Everyone always leaves me. And I know you think you're going to be different, but you won't be." He brings a hand up, taps the gauntlet on the middle of his chest, with a discordant clang of metal on metal. "And I have a heart condition. It's incurable." His speech now is flat, devoid of emotion. Robotic. "I don't know how long I've got left. So there's no point, really, in you loving me. All it's going to do is hurt you when I'm gone. And that's the best-case scenario."
. It's some kind of extended and restored version with new scenes -- one of the things Steve does love about the future is that so many little things like that are better now -- but it's still the same movie that came out when he was a kid.
When Steve drew breath, he found that the only thing he could say was Tony's name. "Tony, Tony, Tony, that's so good. Please.
Steve can't focus on anything except Iron Man's heavy tread next to him, the sound of floorboards creaking under the weight of the suit as they walk together. Iron Man is so close. Steve could touch him. Except, of course, he can't.
They don't get the chance to play like this often, so Steve's determined to spoil the hell out of Tony. And Tony loves rope. Steve's got him trussed up with several long lengths of cotton rope -- crimson, because they both know how good Tony looks in red. The chest harness had to be modified a little to avoid putting pressure on the charging port for Tony's heart; the loops of rope branch around his breastbone, wrapping around his sides, doubling back on each other to sketch out intricate geometric shapes. Tony's skin is dewy, golden in the lamplight. His muscles ripple. He's bound. Restrained. He's lying on his side, which is necessary because the leg harness forces him to bend his knees all the way back; Steve's tied his ankles to his thighs, more or less. Tony's flexible. And he likes it. Steve watches his thighs quiver. God, he's beautiful.
Iron Man had said that, too. But surely it's understandable if Steve's worried about his--- about his
He couldn't, of course, make out Tony's expression as he glanced around Steve's living room. The place wasn't fancy, Steve knew, but it was comfortable. Steve tried not to wonder if Tony was comparing it to his own homes, to Tiberius'. Steve didn't have that kind of money.
Tony's harsh exhalation fuzzed out the phone speaker. "I don't even know how to say this. I guess I should just say it." He sighed again. "Steve, you were right. You were right about Ty. One hundred percent. Everything you said was right. I was wrong. I am so, so sorry. I understand if you don't want to forgive me. I wouldn't forgive me either. But you were right. You were absolutely right."
Steve still can't lift his head -- what the hell did Ghost hit him with? -- but he can see that Tony's still trembling. His hand is half-raised, and he'd have a clear shot at Ghost, but Steve knows there's no way in hell Tony can take it. Not like this.
Then Tony's phone rings. Specifically, it's starting to play a tinny version of The Doors' "People Are Strange."
"Then are the Avengers accused of closing ranks around him, or are we not?" Steve demanded. He couldn't keep the asperity out of his voice. "You can't have it both ways. If you don't think he's affiliated with the Avengers, Ms. Walders, then you can't imply that I'm shielding him because of it."
Steve swallowed hard and licked his lips. His cheeks were even more flushed than they had been before, just under the edges of his cowl, and it looked like it was taking everything in him to get a sentence out. "I-- I know people joke about it. Everyone jokes about it.
?" he breathed, sotto voce. "I'm sorry, Cap, can you put the volume up a second on that TV? I just-- I have no idea what's going on here." There was a mix of confusion and something that might have been anger in his narrowed eyes.
Interface. An interface. A lens just like this. But it hadn't been on Tony, had it? He frowned. It had been on a woman. That was right. It had been-- it had been--
He has to know that Steve would like that. He's a genius. He's the smartest man Steve ever met. But he wants Steve to reassure him. He needs to know that he's safe. That this is okay.
Steve dared, finally, to touch Tony the way he'd been wanting to for so many years. He reached out, closing the space between them, cupping Tony's face with his hand. His fingers slid over Tony's stubbled jawline, like he'd always longed to do, caressing him, learning the shape of him by feel, an intimacy he'd never before been permitted. Tony's skin was hot, still damp with the traces of tears. He trembled when Steve touched him. He pressed hungrily against Steve's hand, pushing into Steve's touch, a motion so instinctive that Steve wondered if he was even aware he was doing it.
"Gonna mess you up even more," Tony panted. "Gonna shoot all over you," he added, and Steve moaned and rocked up, then whimpered again in renewed pain. "And you're going to come with that plug up your ass, that plug I put there, that plug that's all mine, hurting because I made you hurt, because you're
Tony opens the bathroom door, leaves it open, and turns on the shower. It had taken them a few tries to get the temperature and humidity right so the glass door wouldn't fog up, but now Steve has an even more perfect view of Tony stepping into the shower, tipping his head back to let the water run over him. He soaps up, shampoos his hair, rinses. His hands run all over his body. One of his hands dips to his half-hard cock, and Steve's mouth goes dry as Tony gives himself a few leisurely strokes, like this just happens to be his everyday morning routine. He's not asking Steve to touch him. He's not even opening his eyes. Steve might as well not exist; he gets to see what Tony lets him see by Tony's grace alone, and he's already achingly hard.
So he hadn't been worried, per se, when, after the end of a presentation he'd been asked to give about Resilient in some nameless corporate boardroom, the door had opened again while he'd been standing there putting his briefcase away. He hadn't even turned around.
Jaw clenched, Steve was sitting ramrod-straight in his chair. He looked like he was preparing himself to withstand torture. He still wasn't quite looking at Tony. God. Maybe it was something bad after all.
Chen Lu raised an unimpressed eyebrow at him. Steve supposed it hadn't been one of his better remarks, but he'd been caught by surprise.
The monitor Steve is attached to beats once, feebly, in the silence. He doesn't actually have much of a heartbeat right now. If he's getting it back, it means the serum's clearing the vampirism. Again. He's glad it's not permanent.
Steve steps inside and closes the door behind himself. The workshop is spacious and crowded at the same time; it's a large room, but it seems like every square inch is occupied by something, whether it be a hanging half-assembled suit of armor or a haphazard collection of coffee mugs on the edge of a workbench. Iron Man is all the way across the room, behind a few cumbersome machines that Steve can't identify. Steve can just barely see the shining top of his helmet over the tallest of the machines.
that Steve can hardly stand it. Tony's lying there, exposed, bare in his armor, surrounded by metal, and no one's touching him. No one ever touches him. That was what he said.
Tony snapped his head to the left, and the world spun. Something new started beeping angrily. But Steve was right there, sitting at his side.
Tony can't stop staring at Steve's uniform, white and red and dazzling gold, almost like Steve's dressed himself in Tony's colors, in Tony's armor, and Jesus,
"You don't owe me an apology," Steve said, interrupting him. His throat was tight. "I'm not angry with you. I'm not. That's what I was trying to say. This isn't Captain America, your team leader, chewing you out because your report was incomplete. This is Steve, your friend, who cares about you and is hoping you're okay. Okay?"
He doesn't think it was, and he knows Tony's deflecting. But at the same time, it's not like they don't both enjoy when Tony gets some good pain. "Oh, then definitely tell me," he says, with a grin. "I'd like to know the sadism's being properly appreciated. It'll give me something nice to think about next time I've got six hours to kill on monitor duty."
"I'm here at the Stone building," the reporter said, "where the villain Radioactive Man has taken Tiberius Stone hostage. His demands are unknown. And I've just been informed that Iron Man is on the scene."
Steve definitely hadn't expected Tony's father to figure into this. Tony hated talking about his father. Steve had never pressed him. From what little he'd pieced together, Howard Stark hadn't sounded like a good father. Or, possibly, a good man.
He knew it wasn't all going to be this easy. He knew Tiberius would still be haunting them for a while to come, even if he did go to prison. He knew Tony would want to read about it, and think about it, and talk about it later. But for now, for this moment, Steve could give him just a little more happiness, and he was going to stay for the rest of it.
That had been half an hour ago, and the intervening time had been both the best and worst half-hour of Steve's life.
"You don't like yourself much, do you?" Steve asks, finally, and that's not what he wants to say either.
Raising a lazy hand, Mordo pointed, and Tony knew enough about magicians to know that now would be a great time to get out of the way, and, shit, he wouldn't have full flight capability for ten more seconds--
." He sniffled. "I haven't had a drink in years. And I'd really like to say it was bad, but it wasn't. For a few minutes, even in there, even with Ty laughing at me, nothing
. Steve had felt his face growing hot. It wasn't like he didn't know what Mr. Stark had meant. They'd had dirty pictures during the war, after all, and people were still people.
It didn't sound like it could get much worse than that. But seeing as how the story ended with whatever had happened to Tony's heart, Steve knew it was going to get a lot worse.
Oh, hell. That-- that sounded like a pretty classic trauma response. Steve had seen it in a hell of a lot of people, in his line of work. But not usually in Avengers. This was probably above his pay grade. But Tony wanted him here, Tony didn't seem to want anyone else here, and he sure as hell wasn't going to abandon him now.
Tony's fingers moved to Steve's face, stroking the side that didn't feel quite so sticky with blood. "Okay. I can at least do something about a couple of those, while we wait for rescue."
"Um," she says. She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. "Employees clear the area as fast as possible in the event of a supervillain incident. The standard buffer is five floors up and down, and we've got that clear. We're working on clearing the rest of the building now. Then we call the Avengers, obviously." She gestures at the two of them. "We also call SHIELD. They're en route." She glances over at Tony again. Tony still has nothing to say. Over the comms, Tony's breath rattles.
Iron Man had said his father was dead. So Tony's father is dead. If Steve had been the kind of fella who gave a damn about celebrity gossip, he'd probably have known that already. He didn't.
"I didn't." Iron Man's laugh now is softer static. "I guessed. When I thought of it, I figured I had about a fifty-fifty shot at making you either really happy or really sad, but then I realized that you never actually seemed to enjoy team trips to the movies and adjusted the odds."
There was a whole bookcase of science fiction and fantasy, from pulp classics to last year's award winners. Most people wouldn't have been surprised to learn that about a third of the collection was Carol's, and another third was Tony's. They were, as Carol had put it once, the space nerds of the team. But the other third was Steve's. He'd always loved stories about other worlds, ever since he was a kid. Stories about the future. And now he'd found himself in the future. It was even more amazing than he could have dreamed.
"Hey," Steve murmurs, his voice pitched for Tony's ears only. "Nice slow breaths, okay?" He taps his own chest, two fingers against the star. "With me. In. Out. In. Out."
"Uh," he said, with another laugh. "Tony, I'm-- I'm not straight. Not at all. It, um. It definitely isn't pity. That's definitely not what I feel for you."
Steve signs his name next to Tony's. He lets out the breath he was holding. This isn't the ceremony itself, sure, but this... it feels important. This is real. Official. This is where their life begins.
"Yep," Steve said, cheerfully. "A rogue. A thief. Going to steal everything. Already stole your heart, didn't I?"
He looks around, trying to get his bearings. There's a rope dangling a few feet away -- just out of reach -- affixed somewhere higher up. Steve traces the line of it with his eyes. Looks like someone took a grappling hook to the windows a few stories above them.
But Tony had seen the hesitation on his face, even if he hadn't known why. "I know it's a lot to ask," he said, almost too softly to be heard. "And I know it's even more selfish of me. But Ty was right about one thing: I'm newsworthy. For right now, the cops are keeping" -- he waved a hand -- "
And then he and Tony got together, and the topic just... never came up. Sure, it's been an entire year, but it's also been a
There's no way Tony's doing this without getting to watch Steve pound him. He has to see Steve like this. He
Tony couldn't seem to figure out what he wanted to do with his hands; he was brimming with renewed energy, gesturing wildly. Steve could touch him now, he realized; surely now that was permitted. He took one of Tony's hands between both of his own, a gentle suggestion, and Tony's grin was full of delighted surprise, like he hadn't even known that was an option. Steve traced idle patterns over Tony's palm, over the inside of his wrist, and Tony shivered, sighing happily. It must have been a sensitive spot. Steve was looking forward to learning Tony's body in an entirely new way. He'd known Tony before. But everything was different now.
"Oh," Tony said. He blinked a few times, like that hadn't even occurred to him. Steve supposed Tony wasn't at his best right now. "Okay. Makes sense." He sighed, pushed himself to his feet, and paced to Tiberius' half of the DreamVision setup. His movements were tight and jerky. Nervous. "Just say when, Cap. He'll probably come around as soon as I cut the visual feed."
Tony pressed even tighter, trying to close every single fraction of an inch that could possibly separate their bodies. His head dipped and he kissed Steve's ear. A ripple of unexpected pleasure ran through Steve; he shuddered, overextended his balance, and when Tony ground his hips against him again he tipped over, flat on his back, pulling Tony over on top of him.
They traded more kisses, then, for a few glorious minutes. Tony's mouth was lush and sweet. The only noise in the room was the soft, wet sounds of their lips, broken by the occasional sigh or pleasant hum. The other kisses had been desperate, passionate, intended to fan the flames of desire. For all that they were both quite obviously unfulfilled -- Tony's still-hard cock was pressed against Steve's hip -- the way Tony was kissing him now was slow, easy, unhurried, as if he were trying to calm Steve down.
"I thought so," Tony said, and he squeezed his hand. "But you owe me a date, Winghead. A real date, now, where I can actually eat an entire meal."
Even Steve had heard the rumors. Everyone had. It wasn't as if the tabloids had ever left Tony alone. It was just that, before last week, Steve had had absolutely no reason to think the rumors could be true.
. This was the worst possible outcome. Not only did Tony not love him, not only was Tony with a man who was abusing him, Tony knew about Steve's crush, his unrequited love. Maybe Tiberius had told him. That sure sounded like something Tiberius might have done. Maybe they'd laughed about it together. Maybe Tony was going to curl up in Tiberius' embrace, saying
Tony snorted. "Well, I can't imagine anyone else I'd want to find in your bed." His smile went softer. "Or anyone else I'd want, really."
Tony's hand finally, finally closed around Steve's cock, lightly, not even moving, and Steve moaned, struggling to not give into the urge to just thrust into Tony's hand.
Somehow Tony's armor was still functional. Repulsor rays lashed out from both Tony's hands and hit Radioactive Man in the chest, a perfect center-of-mass shot. It only staggered him, but that was enough; he dropped Tiberius, who promptly ducked and ran.
what he'll be," Tony snaps, because Tony knows he himself will probably be beaten and broken and he will deserve it. "I can handle him."
The way Mr. Stark says it, it's not a question. And that means he knows. He knows what happened in the field because Iron Man told him. Because Iron Man must tell him everything.
The scales of Justice moved slowly, but two hours later, Steve was confident that they were finally beginning to tip in the right direction.
. "Years. But every time I got up enough courage to ask, you'd mention something about seeing someone and it just seemed like we were never single at the same time, and now we are and now you're here and I can hardly believe--"
This was where Steve had given up, fighting Tiberius on television. But he wasn't going to give up now, not when it was Tony.
Backing up, he makes it across the room with some difficulty. He's so hard that he's not quite sure how he's still walking. But at least he manages it. Tony's still just staring, blinking at him, and he doesn't say a word as Steve mutes one card and grabs the other.
going to do what he did. I promise that. And I know the only way I can prove it to you is if you see me keeping my promise, if you trust me even a little bit, if you trust me to be here with you and not harm you, and I know that's hard right now. I know. I know that when you're feeling vulnerable, everything looks like a weapon. Even the things you know aren't weapons. But you're here, and that's the first step."
"Well," Tony said, pleased. He turned his head, kissed Steve's shoulder. "I have to say, if it were up to me, I'd take my time. Draw it out. Make you wait for it. Just a bit. Let the anticipation build, as it were."
It was kind of poetic, when he considered it. Iron Man had come into the world when a fistful of shrapnel had landed in his chest a decade ago, and he was going to go out of it when some two-bit villain decided to rip the RT node out of his chest and destroy all his higher brain function.
But it was too late. Tony had noticed him. He set his paper down, straightened up, and grinned wider. He was still so damn handsome and it wasn't fair.
He crouches down next to Ghost and Steve doesn't quite understand what he's doing, but then Tony picks up Ghost's gun, switches the safety on and sets it back down. He pulls back the sleeve of Ghost's outfit at his wrist, revealing bare skin, then efficiently shucks his gauntlet, checks Ghost's pulse, then slides the gauntlet back on. He plucks the device off Ghost's belt that Ghost had paralyzed Steve with. He's holding it like it's something he doesn't want to touch barehanded.
Tony, got it instantly. He paused to lick the palm of his hand, and then he wrapped his hand around the shaft of Steve's cock, with just the same pressure as before -- he'd remembered, of course he'd remembered -- and after a few false starts, found a rhythm with his tongue and his hand that was definitely going to bring Steve over the edge.
"Are you sure that's a no, about the shield?" Steve asked. "I've been known to hug it, myself." He hoped that would make Tony feel better about taking him up on the offer, if Tony knew that Steve wasn't offering because he thought Tony was weak, was offering his own coping method. They were both only human, after all.
Anger and jealousy tangled and slid through him, and the fight was gone, and all he could see in front of him was Tony's smile, Tony's red wet mouth, Tony who
He saw what Steve meant in an instant, the words unfolding like the map of a battlefield. "No, actually, that makes perfect sense," Tony said, and Steve blinked at him, surprised. "You're peak human. Everyone else's senses of what's normal and appropriate haven't been calibrated for you. And I'm guessing nobody hits you as hard as you really want to be hit, and if you ask them to try, it freaks them out, because what you're asking for would harm a baseline human, because you can't possibly want what you say you want. Especially if you can't tell them you're Captain America. Am I right?"
actually do it," Steve pointed out. "He just knocked you out first so you couldn't stop him. I don't think that's better. I think that's a whole lot worse."
That would be an immensely cruel thing to do, and Steve can't see why Mr. Stark would be that cruel to anyone, much less his trusted bodyguard.
"Ty knew me well enough that he could take me on a guided tour of my phobias," he said, his voice gone dull. "I suppose it was my fault for telling him I thought DreamVision had great applications for exposure therapy. This wasn't the therapeutic kind of exposure," he added. "Cockroaches, mostly."
Steve's eyes went hot, prickling with unshed tears. Even in this, Tony was trying to be kind. "It's nice of you to offer that." He could barely get the words out. "But I think it's best if I go. You've made your stance perfectly clear. And I-- I care about you, Tony." He drew himself up, tried to find Captain America within himself, the part of him that knew how to stand tall. "I care about you a lot. And I don't think I can handle watching what happens next."
Carol's lips parted. "Steve?" she asked, a little more sharply, and there was real distress in her voice now. "Steve, what's wrong? You look like hell."
Dear God. Steve just stared at Tony, incredulous. How had it been this bad? How had so many people Tony had loved hurt him so much? Why did this keep happening to him?
, Tony had said, instantly, confidently, like he hadn't even had to think about it, and Steve's heart had melted then and there.
"Maybe I'll come down your throat," Steve muses, and the thought of it makes him snap his hips a little more firmly. Tony moans enthusiastically in response and that-- wow, that really does a lot for Steve, knowing Tony wants to swallow. Steve's always liked that, and Tony wants to give him what he wants, doesn't he? Fire rushes through him, burns hotter. "Make you swallow it all. You'd like that, wouldn't you?" Tony moans again in wordless agreement. And then -- oh, oh,
He scrolled down, recognizing some familiar names in the first paragraph. It looked like Chen and Donahue had
Steve pictured himself showing up on one of Tiberius Stone's innumerable channels, explaining it all to one of the sneering TV hosts. He'd do the right thing. He'd tell the truth. They'd all have to listen. They'd see what Tiberius had done to Tony.
There was a horrible noise, metal screeching on metal, and then the deckplates below Steve  heaved, threw him into the air, and slammed him into the far bulkhead.
"It didn't happen a lot." He knew that was starting to sound like an excuse. He didn't know how to say this. He'd never tried to say this before. "To me, anyway. Not more than a handful of times. Mostly when he was drunk he hit my ma. Sometimes I got in the way. But I don't think there'll ever be an acceptable number of times to hit your child. Or your spouse. So." His voice was rough. He shrugged. "Yeah. It counts."
"Absolutely!" Tony nodded, fervent. "I can't believe Ty never thought of that application! I should go tell him about it. Excuse me."
So Steve tilted his head to the side, a suggestion of a nod. "I suppose I'd have to agree with that, yes."
The flattened, circular base of the plug wasn't featureless, as Tony had been expecting. In fact, it bore the last thing he had ever expected to see: Iron Man's face. It was a little relief in miniature, the faceplate painted gold, the rest of the red helmet a hint of striated metal at its edges, done up with a little bit of a shimmer to stand out from the red background. It was clearly meant to be a depiction of the old Model IV, and -- Tony thought with a near-hysterical edge -- it was actually pretty damn accurate. Much like everything else in this box, it had been made with exacting care.
"I know," Tony said, and hope flared in Steve's chest, but then Tony kept talking. "But the thing is, Ty's never lied to me either." He half-smiled. "I know you believe what you're saying. So one of you has to be wrong." His throat worked. "And I don't think it's him."
Tony clears his throat. "I don't think there are really words for how I felt watching Ghost put a gun to your head." His lips thin; he swallows. His words are slow, carefully chosen. His voice is hoarse. "I could see it coming, you know. The armor sensors worked just fine, and Ghost's tech has fairly distinctive energy signatures. And I--" Tony looks away, and his voice catches. "I would have recognized what he was carrying anyway. I knew he had a neutralizer in his hand even before you did. I just-- I couldn't make myself do anything about it."
Steve can't say anything to comfort him. Not here, not like this. Not in public. Tony's suffering and there's nothing he can do about it.
Tony's got one of his spare armors, one of the briefcase ones, all boxed up on his side of the bed, because sometimes the Avengers need to assemble in that much of a hurry. Right now Steve's glad to see it, because he winces at the thought of how much work it would be to get Tony downstairs to his armory. It's not Tony's newest, fanciest armor, but surely it ought to be plenty strong enough for Ghost, because Tony started fighting the guy at least ten armor redesigns ago.
"Hey," Tony said. "Hey, it's all right." He leaned over and patted Steve's hand, and Steve hated how much he craved that touch. He wasn't the one suffering here. "I know you've been worried since you saw it. Of course you were worried. I'm sorry I didn't tell you." He sighed again. "I really should have."
Tony chuckled, and he looked brighter than he had in an entire week, as the helmet settled into his hands. It was worth it, Steve told himself. Tony's happiness was worth anything. Everything. "You know," Tony mused, "if I tried to tell the world about Captain America's
Tony's face colored and he looked away, like he hated to hear it. Even though they both knew damn well that it was exactly what he needed to hear. He was shaking his head in disbelief. "How do you just...?" he began to ask, and then stopped, and then started over. "It sounds so true when you say it."
"He was the only man who ever loved me, and he never really loved me at all." Tony's mouth curved, his expression once again graven with pain and sorrow. "I loved Ty. I trusted him. He'd known me almost my entire life, and I thought, here, finally, this was the right one, you know? Here was someone who knew me, knew me better than almost anyone else, knew nearly everything about me, and-- and wouldn't ever turn away. And then he did. It turned out it had never been real." There were tears in Tony's eyes. "I know I've made so many mistakes. I know I've loved all the wrong people. I know that a good half-dozen of my exes have tried to murder me. The bar is set so low that it's
Steve's face went hot, but he lifted his head anyway. He'd done the right thing. He wasn't ashamed of it. And Tony wasn't going to make him feel sorry for it. He had no idea what he was going to say, but this was happening right now anyway.
He realized that he knew now what he'd done wrong then. He'd seen how Tony had treated Carol. He knew how Carol had talked about it to him. He'd judged Tony. He'd thought it was a failing, a moral failing. He'd thought that because Tony was smart, he should have known it was destroying him. He thought now that Tony had already known. Tony couldn't control whether he wanted it. That wasn't possible. But he could control whether he did something about it. It seemed like it had taken a while for even Tony to figure that part out. And if-- if Tony slipped again, it would be because he was hurting, and he didn't know how else to make the pain stop. Steve couldn't judge him for wanting that, either. It wasn't as if he knew how to make Tony stop hurting.
"But you were so brave," Iron Man tells him. "You did just what I asked you to do, even though it was scary, and you helped me so I could fly both of us out the window. That was a really important thing you did, and you did it exactly right. And you're going to be just fine. Everyone's going to be fine. Look, here come the fire trucks. Do you like fire trucks?"
"The problem, as I understand it," Tony said, "is that you spent so long thinking this wasn't okay. Not the gay thing. Which is probably why you weren't expecting this. You thought you were okay with that. But the problem is me, specifically. Wanting me." He licked his lips. Steve didn't know how to tell him he was exactly right. "Intimately. Physically. Carnally." He pronounced the words slowly, deliberately, and Steve realized he was staring at Tony's mouth. He was hot all over. "Loving me, that was fine. Love's a good feeling. Noble. Generous. Makes people feel better. But wanting me? That wasn't okay. You told yourself you were some kind of pervert, lusting after your straight friend. And then you found out I wasn't straight, but you thought I didn't want you, so it was still wrong to want me. And now you know none of that's true, but all the thoughts you had still feel wrong, so when you think about everything you've wanted, you remember that it felt wrong. It feels like too much. Like you want it all too much. More than anyone should ever want anything." That was exactly it. But how did Tony know? "You feel like you're just this... predatory mess. A swamp of coarse, base emotions and forbidden desires, greedy and needy." Tony spat out the words. "Objectifying someone you care about. The opposite of kindness and generosity. If I could see inside your head, see what you thought about, what really got you off, everything you thought about me, I'd be appalled." Tony's mouth was twisted. "Am I on the right track?"
It was one more problem to add to the pile. Now he was upset, sad, jealous, he had a broken hand, and he knew Tony's boyfriend was trying to frame him for murder and he couldn't prove it.
Getting to put the cuffs on Steve was, in and of itself, better than some actual sex that Tony had had. The leather was buttery-soft, and Steve sighed in pleasure as Tony slid straps through buckles and got the cuffs around Steve's wrists and then his ankles. Steve was still staring up at him, dreamy-eyed, letting Tony just manhandle him, and, oh, this was going to be good.
"That's a myth, you know," Tony said. "As long as you're getting better, which you are, you're allowed to sleep."
Steve flattens his hand against Iron Man's biceps appreciatively and grins. "All that muscle under the armor is real, huh? Nice."
They stop before sliding out completely. There's nothing but air beneath Steve's head, beneath his upper back, and that's when he realizes that the winds he expects to sting his skin this high up are actually blowing right through him. God.
"Come on," Carol said, grinning once more, slinging an arm over his shoulder, turning him around, taking a step back down the stairs, nudging him in the direction of the basement gym. "Try to beat the stuffing out of me, I dare you. It'll make you feel better."
The third bolt hit low and lateral, under his guard, striping sideways just under his waist, and it passed through his armor as if it wasn't even there. Literally. The beam of light just phased right through solid metal, like it was nothing. Like magic, because it
"You're the only person I've ever told, you know?" he says, softly. "You're not the only person who knows, though. Happy figured it out on his own, bless him. He nearly gave it away the last time you saw him, but I don't think you noticed. That's it. Just you two." He pauses. "The only other person who knew-- he passed away."
He raised his fists and punched out, a one-two punch that was the only thing he could manage before she hit him. His reach was greater. That was all he had.
He shouldn't have said it like that. He hadn't known. He hadn't thought about it. That wasn't an excuse, though. There couldn't really be an excuse.
Tony raises an artificially-steady hand and tilts his faceplate back. He looks-- well, honestly, he still looks like hell, but he looks better than he did before. A lesser circle of hell, maybe. Tony's eyes are still bloodshot from crying, and his face is puffy and blotchy, but he doesn't look like he's on the verge of tears again. He looks like he's trying to hold it back, and maybe even succeeding. His lips are parted, just a sliver, like he wants to say yes to Steve's question, to say he's okay, to give Steve the answer he clearly wants, but he knows he's not there yet. Tony doesn't speak. His throat works.
Tony had somehow figured out exactly how Steve liked it, and when he swiped his thumb over the head of his cock, Steve groaned and came as Tony kissed him more fiercely. When Tony's mouth left his, he couldn't help it; he glanced down, and saw that he'd come over the trembling muscles of Tony's abs, smeared messy and white, marking him, and he watched as his cock jerked again and spurted once more in Tony's hand. He was going to keep that image in this thoughts all right.
"Mmm," Steve said. "I know you will never, ever believe this because it's coming from me specifically" -- Tony raised an eyebrow -- "but you have
Tony turned Steve's statement over in his head like code he was trying to reverse-engineer. Picked at it. Took a leap.
If Steve weren't actually living through this, he might have called Iron Man's reaction comedic. Iron Man takes a stunned step backwards, boots ringing heavily on the floor as he nearly trips. His eyes are wide and shocked, and he glances to either side of him as if there might be someone else here that Steve is talking to, before motioning incredulously to himself. His eyes are even wider; he brings one gauntleted hand up to half-cover the unibeam housing of his suit.
Tiberius was abusing Tony. And Steve would bet his shield that Tony was nowhere near the first man he'd ever hurt. No one was born lying like that. He'd had practice. And somewhere, there was a trail of bodies. Steve could only hope they weren't literal bodies. Tiberius had probably threatened and bribed people to keep quiet. There had probably been non-disclosure agreements. But there must have been other men. And if Steve said the word, they'd start coming out, so to speak, of the woodwork.
Everyone in the room knew who Steve was, of course; there were a few people trying not to look like they were staring at him, because even in this crowd Steve still turned heads. It was hard not to notice a guy in red, white, and blue. Steve Rogers, former commercial artist and ex-soldier, had no reason to be attending any kind of party with Tony Stark. But Captain America was one of Tony's friends. Captain America had every reason to be Tony's guest. So he was here in uniform and everyone else was here in black-tie. He didn't mind it all that much; he'd done this countless times before. He was used to standing out in a crowd.
He could sleep now, he told himself. Tony was all right. Tony was asleep now. Everything was fine. Everything was better than he could have hoped. Everything was perfect.
He expects it to take a matter of seconds, as it had in the Necropolis. Minutes tick by. He supposes this is what Stephen meant about finesse.
Why hadn't he performed a basic scan of the warehouse on the way in? The thought entered his mind as he fell, as he realized he was probably going to hit the floor before he was flight-capable.
," Steve said, numbly. His head was ringing like a bomb had gone off inside his skull. Sound wavered in and out.
He wanted Tony to touch him everywhere. He'd been watching Tony's hands for years, watching and wondering
"I don't know if you'd be interested," Mr. Stark begins, "but I've got two tickets to the Yankees game tomorrow. And I know that you're-- I mean, Iron Man told me that you're a baseball fan, even if you're probably not a Yankees fan. But the VIP area is really something else, and I thought-- I thought maybe you might want to come with me."
Steve couldn't be here. He was intruding, invading Tony's space, finding out things Tony hadn't wanted him to know. And, sure, he was upset, but his feelings didn't matter, did they? He was the one in the wrong. So Tiberius wasn't who Steve would have picked for Tony. He was who Tony had picked. It didn't matter how Steve felt about him. It wasn't his choice.
Tony leaned and kissed Steve's awed, slackened lips very, very gently. "I love you," Tony said, softly. "You still get to keep me, okay? No matter what. You're not going to lose me. You asked for what you wanted, and you got me, didn't you?" Another smile played across Tony's lips. "Maybe if you ask, you'll get something else you want."
The gun slides to the side of Steve's head, still pressed firmly against his skull. Ghost bends over and tugs the keyboard toward himself with his other hand. It's a nice keyboard, Steve notes, inanely. Solid metal, right down to the keys themselves. Looks heavy. Expensive, probably. Tony always believes in buying the best.
is the way the phrase goes, but the issue here is that they've had so many more options than just hands. And why would he offer Tony a massage when he could offer him a blowjob instead?
"Okay, well," Steve said, looking Tony up and down again. "I can think of one thing that might make it a little easier. Come over here."
Steve nodded jerkily. He felt like he was moving in slow-motion, like the rest of the world wasn't real. "Yeah. That was him too."
There's a body in the iceberg lying on the table, practically all the space they have on this submarine. Red, white, and blue are starting to become visible through the clouded ice, and Tony can feel the familiar claustrophobic press of flowers in his chest, trying to rise up into his throat. God, he doesn't want to be sick in the suit.
"No," Tony admitted. "I didn't want you to, exactly. But then I'd have known you were really into it, you know?"
"Well, I haven't exactly been celibate," Steve admitted, a little awkwardly. He hadn't really thought of himself as waiting. "But in terms of what I wanted to do with men, yeah. It's you for me. I've wanted it to be you since I met you. Sometimes I thought about going out and finding a guy, just to know what it would be like. But none of them were you. So I didn't."
"Haven't seen Ty since Monday night," Tony said. "We were both busy yesterday, unfortunately. But we've got some plans for tonight. I might not, um." Tony paused delicately. And that smile, that was really something. "I might not make it back to the mansion."
Steve reached out and ran his hand through Tony's hair. Tony was doing it again, wasn't he? Comparing himself to some mythical ideal man that he thought Steve deserved to be with.
Maybe the shield would actually help. He didn't know what else to offer him. He didn't know what else Tony wanted.
Tony's gaze followed Steve's gesture, and then, after a few seconds, he was grinning, wide and amused. He started to laugh. "Oh my God. That was why you handed me a gay book, wasn't it? I thought you were doing it for me, but
As if he feels as awkward as Steve does, Iron Man clears his throat in a burst of static. "I, uh," he says. "I didn't have to ask. He offered." He pauses, delicately. "He-- he wished us well." There's another fuzzy sound, maybe a laugh. "Wished me better luck than he had with you, actually."
Steve pumped him a few more times, experimentally, getting a sense of the rhythm Tony liked, but then he slowed it all down. He didn't want Tony to come like this, after all. Not that he'd
"You don't know that," Tony said, but the look in his eyes was one Steve had coaxed out of him hundreds of times: the desperate need to believe in Steve. In the briefing room, on the battlefield, and now in his bed.
It occurs to Steve then that maybe Iron Man doesn't feel the same way. He'd like to think that Iron Man does, of course, but it's not like he's ever said it, either.
Great. Steve stares helplessly. He's never been very good with kids. He clears his throat. "Are you hurt?" he asks. The boy doesn't look injured, but it's hard to tell. Maybe he's just frightened. Why is he crying so much?
It's okay. He just has to get through this conversation. Maybe it will even be nice, to get to meet Captain America once, finally, after all these years of loving him. Tony has double-checked the Avengers' funding paperwork with the Maria Stark Foundation. The team will go on without him. Everyone will be all right.
Mordo sneered at them. It looked even more ridiculous with the facial hair situation, although Tony was willing to concede that he was incredibly well-preserved for someone who was probably at least as old as Steve. "You're nowhere near good enough to best me, Avengers." There was a faint smile on his face.
He doesn't know exactly what to do to commemorate this anniversary, but surely the internet will know. The internet will have ideas. The internet will tell him what people do now. The internet may have let him down about dating Iron Man, but it can't possibly fail him again.
Steve imagined this mystery woman pouring Tony a drink. Was that how it had worked? "So you told her you were sober and she-- what, she handed you a drink?"
Metal clicks beneath Steve's hands, and then splits beneath his fingers into two halves, chestplate and backplate. Steve eases the heavy panels away, half-aware of the shine of unpainted metal underneath, but he concentrates first on getting the bigger pieces out of the way. Then he looks up.
"Avengers business." Steve's voice rang out of him, pitched to carry across a battlefield. He unslung his shield, testing its weight on his newly-healed hand. "It's a matter of life and death."
"Okay," Steve says. "Okay. But if you change your mind, the offer's always open, all right? I love you and I want to help you."
There's fear flickering across Tony's face now, his feelings deep and plainly evident. He can't hide anything like this. His entire being is focused on what Steve thinks of him. On pleasing Steve. And right now, he just had to say no to Steve -- no about being able to stand up, that is -- and he's flat-out terrified that it's not what Steve wants to hear.
"I know." Tony's smile in return is small, almost shy. It's intimate. True. Steve thinks that maybe now, after all this time, Tony believes him when he says he thinks the world of him. "But surely even you can admit I could stand to wipe my face off."
"No," Tony says, softly. "No, my parents were already dead by then. Car accident." He sighs. "About three years ago now, when I'd had SI for about a year, I went to Afghanistan as a consultant for the military. I tripped over a landmine and was captured and imprisoned." His gaze is very far away. "My cellmate was a professor by the name of Ho Yinsen. He helped me design and build the first version of the chestplate, to keep my heart beating, as well as the first version of Iron Man. He died to buy me time. I-- I took the suit and ran. And that's how I became Iron Man. That's the truth."
Naturally, Mordo was unfazed. He just kept smiling. "Regret? Oh, Captain, I don't think I will. In fact, I'm planning to
"It loved me," Tony repeated. "It was pretty clear about that. And it, uh. It had some ideas about keeping me safe. It killed Whiplash the next time he tried to fight me. It followed me to a conversation I was having with Ru and forced me away from her. Then, eventually, it beat me up." He snorted. "Talk about an abusive boyfriend."
In the midst of his panic Tony has to repress the urge to laugh, because, God, he's never forgotten the first words Steve said to him when they met, and it seems like even an amnesiac Steve has exactly the same damn questions.
sounded like an excellent idea, actually. But not what Steve wanted to try right now. "I'd rather swallow," he whispered, and he put his mouth on Tony's cock again, his lips barely closing around the tip, and he stroked Tony hard and fast.
Steve could only imagine how exhausted Tony was. "If you want to sleep like that, I'm happy to stay right here. Wherever you'll be the most comfortable."
Steve took one slow breath, then another. It was over. Steve had said it, had laid it out over the course of the conversation,
Steve stroked Tony's shoulder. "You didn't know. You couldn't know. There was no way you could have known. He knew you. He knew you very well. And he didn't want to get caught. There's nothing for you to be ashamed of."
As the drug takes effect, as the pain starts to recede, Tony shuts his eyes and ends up telling Yinsen the whole story. His secret. If he's going to die, he wants someone to know. He imagines the shrapnel piercing his heart and somehow working its way to his lungs, wrapped up in the flowers that will kill him. He wants to laugh. All his life it's been the flowers. Now it's going to be his heart. It'll be a race to see which one kills him first.
"If Ty will go to prison for it," Tony said, fervently, "I will absolutely unmask and testify." He paused again. "You're not telling me this just to make me feel better, right? You actually think he'll go down for it?"
Tony glanced up; he looked a little surprised. Either because he'd gotten it right or because Steve was so vocal about liking it, Steve wasn't sure. "Like this?" he echoed, giving Steve's cock another slow stroke, from base to tip.
"I love you," Steve told him again. "I love you and I'm not going anywhere." He kissed Tony's forehead, the only part of him he could easily reach. "Sweet dreams."
Steve sat up, moving slowly, to let Tony know he hadn't interpreted the question as urgent, the way a call to assemble would have been. "Yep. Still awake."
isn't... exactly something I can promise. Not right now. Maybe not ever. I don't know. I definitely can't promise
"I'm sorry," Tony said, helplessly. He could fix a lot of things. He couldn't fix that. He couldn't make Steve happy. But he was an engineer, and he was always looking for solutions. "Could you draw her?" Tony asked, in the pause between Steve's gasping breaths.
Carol was still watching him, her face drawn and tight. She needed an answer. He couldn't give her the real one. It was still a secret. It was all a goddamn secret, because Tony was too ashamed to tell anyone he loved a man but not so ashamed that he wouldn't fuck him. Tony was going to let Tiberius take him to pieces, and he wasn't going to tell anyone why.
He waited for the concern on Carol's face to turn to sadness, or even anger, at how obviously he was keeping something from her. But instead Carol just nodded once, briskly, like he'd given her an order.
God, he wanted to, but he couldn't. He couldn't tell her that he'd caught Tony kissing Tiberius Stone. He couldn't tell her that it was eating him up inside because Tony was with Tiberius, because Tony wasn't with him, because that would have required explaining that they all three of them were queer, and that wasn't his secret to tell.
Steve takes a deep breath. It's a reflex, because right now he doesn't actually need the air for anything. He's starting to feel, distantly, like he might be able to need to breathe again soon.
"Your mouth," Steve said, far enough beyond shame to beg for it. "Please-- you said-- and if you still want to--"
He pictured, quite vividly, jerking off, kneeling over Tony, his release spattering over Tony's trembling, taut muscles. He'd make a pretty picture. Tony would look like him, Tony would smell like him, and Steve would know, he'd know exactly who Tony had been with now and it would be him--
It wasn't like Tony's other option was any better. Some people were happy on their own, but Tony most certainly wasn't one of them. He looked like a fella who'd been thinking a whole lot about loneliness lately, though.
"You didn't tell me about your heart," Steve said. It wasn't an accusation. It was a statement of fact.
This won't even be his first orgasm of the night. When they'd been dressing for dinner, it had become apparent that Steve wasn't going to be able to make it out of the house without embarrassing himself, and Tony had grinned at Steve, adjusted Steve's tie for him, grabbed a handkerchief, and then unceremoniously stuck his hand down the front of Steve's pants. Steve hadn't lasted more than a minute. But, Steve being Steve, he has a few more rounds in him. After he comes one or two more times, he'll be able to last longer, long enough to satisfy Tony. By the time he rearranges the harness and gets Tony properly tied down to the bed, spreadeagled, him atop Tony, Tony inside him, he's going to be able to ride him for long enough to make it good for both of them.
Sure, Tony could die any day. They all could. It was the nature of the job. Hell, Tony had almost died tonight. But he had thought he'd never have to worry about Tony's heart again. He had thought that, in that respect, Tony had been safe. But the truth was that Tony very much hadn't been safe, and Steve hadn't even known.
Shame coursed through Steve, hot and tight and unbearable, coiling around his limbs and pulling him down, rooting him to where he stood. Shame was a bright spotlight that beat down on him, scorching him, flaying him open and leaving him there. His gut twisted with something else, some other emotion, something ugly and dark, a sickening stew of anger and jealousy and betrayal, something hollow and rotten.
Tony pokes a finger against Steve's bare forehead. "Not right now, there isn't. But fine. I love you so much that I'll let you be Party A. I am so nice to you."
Steve can't help but bring one hand to his own mouth to touch his kiss-bruised lips, and he's gratified to watch Iron Man track the movement.
"I'm not going to lie to you," he says. "Do I wish that events had transpired differently? Yes, of course. But I'm not going to hold it against you because you've found happiness with someone you love. I'm not going to hold it against Iron Man, either," he adds. "And I just-- I hope it works out for both of you. I wish you all the best."
"I asked the internet," Steve continues, and God, God, he's babbling, he doesn't even know what he's saying anymore. "They say the internet knows everything, so I asked it, I typed it right in, I asked it,
The shield passes straight through Ghost's head. Ghost's whole body ripples as the shield slides harmlessly through him. He's intangible. Steve stares in dismay. Spinning, the shield sails over the back of the chair, hits the wall and bounces off. A few seconds later, Steve catches it on the rebound, fingers closing around the rim of the shield as frustration wells up in his chest.
He was sweet. That wasn't a surprise; Steve did know him. He'd often wondered why the sweetest and kindest man he knew had had such terrible luck in love because surely anyone would have wanted someone like Tony. Maybe it was just that Steve loved him so much that he felt everyone else must as well. And now, finally, Steve had a chance to show him.
"I'm happy," Tony said, his voice low and intense. "I'm happy now. I can't-- I can't promise that I'll always be." His voice was tinged with regret. "I wish I could. But I'm going to try as hard as I can to hold onto it. To hold onto you."
." His voice was thick. "Need-- need you to touch me." He couldn't think with how much he wanted it. There wasn't room for anything else in him except this.
, Mr. Stark had assured him, the day he'd moved into the mansion. The phrase had been meaningless to him then, of course, but he understands it now.
He remembers how Tony had looked just a few hours ago, all wrapped up in Steve's rope, his cock hard, the knots of the harness showing him off so beautifully, rubbing against him in all the best ways, at the mercy of pressure and friction. He'd looked so
Eventually, the elevator slowed, then stopped. It made a quiet dinging noise, and then the doors slid open, revealing the familiar sweep of Tony's expansive living area. This room was the largest, of course, dotted here and there with couches and chairs, with bright sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows. One of those million-dollar views.
Tony swallowed thickly and stared at Steve like he thought it was a trick. Like no one had ever offered him even this modicum of decency. But he answered anyway. "Not-- not the scars or the charging port, then," he said, almost too quietly to hear. "Everything below that is fine to look at and touch. Not that I can imagine you getting much out the sight of my stomach."
But another man called out, "Is Captain America up here? Captain, we were responding to a call from ViaStone security when we got another call from... Wasp? She was at Avengers Mansion. She said she'd been monitoring the police bands, and she wanted to let us know you were on an active mission here, responding to a supervillain threat. Do you need any help?"
The East Coast team had been kind enough to keep him looped into their comms once Tony had said he'd like to stay a little longer after that mess with Sise-Neg, and Jan had let the rest of the team know that they were planning another clean-up session today. Monica had said she was going to make the rounds of the hospital again instead, but Thor and Steve had said they were in.
"You mean Bernie?" Steve grimaced. "I was. And she was very nice, but I just... I don't think it was ever going to work out. She doesn't know who I am. And I'm too old-fashioned for her. I took her to see
Steve held up his hands. "I know it sounds crazy," he said. "I know that. And Tiberius knows that, too. That's what he's counting on. When he broke the Whiplash story, Tiberius had the exact footage to incriminate you. And that's what he was trying to do again. If Radioactive Man was such a big surprise to him, how did he have a news crew ready to follow you when you ended up continuing the fight in Central Park? How did he know where you were? And how did he get cameras there that fast? I'm betting he was tracking one of the two of you. Maybe both."
After that, things were chaotic and Tony, still drugged, was content to let them happen. Steve kicked the nearest door down without losing his grip on Tony, and then barreled down a corridor and up two flights of stairs. Lights flashed red, a klaxon began to sound, and from his upside-down vantage point Tony saw more yellow-suited scientists running toward them.
Steve was already half-hoarse now, when he screamed again, and his ass was dark red, fading into purple; his body was already trying to heal the bruises. When Steve lifted his head there were tears streaking across his cheeks, dripping down onto the chains on his arms. Steve was
--didn't even know where he was. Shit. Without the armor response, he couldn't put out a tracking beacon.
He had a point. But Steve knew he wasn't the healthiest example. "I probably should," Steve admitted. "I think I'd probably feel a lot better if I did."
. Briskly, Tony tapped the metal port again. "What you can see from the outside is the charging port; the battery in it needs a regular charge. It's a little more... involved... than the old chestplate, which was all external. This isn't. The battery lasts a lot longer, thankfully, but charging it--" Tony glanced away and then back again. "It's painful. The chestplate wasn't the height of comfort for several reasons, but charging it never actually hurt. This does. A lot."
After several seconds, Tony's settled on an answer. "Better than I was, in a sense." He bites his lip. "But-- no. Not okay. Not really. I'd call it more of a... differently bad."
Steve must have looked doubtful, because Tony kept talking. "I know it's you," he said, soft but insistent. "I always know it's you. I know it's you
The entire English language had exited Tony's head sometime in the last five seconds. "Um," Tony said.
In fact, it was pretty much a straight shot of bare, cracked laminate flooring from the escalator to the far end of the floor where Mordo was. He'd left a makeshift barricade of light-up animals in a heap about three-quarters of the way down the floor, though, blocking their line of sight. It looked like even supervillains wanted to preserve an air of mystery.
He wasn't quite at his full strength, but Steve yelled when the flogger cracked across his ass and his knees slid apart, almost dropping him to the bed. God, that was good.
Steve should have known what to say. He should have had some Captain America speech ready for this moment, something eloquent, with well-chosen words, the sort of speech that would reassure Tony that he had every confidence in him. Instead, his mind was empty of all thought. His hands were trembling.
He untangles his fingers from Tony's hair and pulls out of Tony's mouth, lifting Tony's head away from his cock, since Tony can't move well enough on his own. Steve's panting, achingly hard, trembling with pent-up desire and frustration, but even with his hands shaking he manages to gently settle Tony back down on the bed. On his side, with a pillow under his head so he won't hurt himself. Even with the alert going, that has to be his first priority. He has to make sure Tony won't be harmed, because Tony's entrusted himself into his care tonight to such an extent that only Steve can help him now. Tony can't really do much for himself. So first and foremost, Steve has to ensure Tony is safe.
Steve waited, but Tony didn't say anything more. Tony just blew out a breath, tipped his head gingerly against the back of the couch, and stared up at the ceiling.
"Of course I'll give him back," Ghost says, cheerful once again. He's clearly lying. "Come on, then, Iron Man. The password."
"He said I was lucky he loved me, because no one else would." Tony's voice was distant. "I believed him. I thought he was being kind to me. He--" Tony winced and clearly edited what he was about to say. "I don't think you really want to know the exact complaints he had. But it was my fault. That was what he told me. He told me I was terrible at gay sex, and it was obvious I didn't know what I was doing, but that he was willing to forgive me because he loved me." Tony looked even more wretched. "I'm willing to concede that me being incredibly, unbelievably wasted for most of the first phase of our relationship may not have done me any favors, but I was sober last week. And, well, you heard his opinion of my skills."
the reason I started drinking again." The correction sounded like something Tony had picked up in a meeting. "But she was definitely willing to hasten the process along."
"Why, thank you," Steve says, his mouth quivering in delight. "Glad you think so. You're not so bad yourself, either."
Tony cleared his throat. He'd always had a good voice for telling a story, Steve had thought, rich and expressive. "
Oh. Iron Man thinks Steve is getting ahead of himself. He thinks Steve is much more forward than he actually intends to be.
Suspiciously, Tony tapped a D-ring with one fingernail and it rang out, the sound almost unearthly and very, very familiar.
"Of course," Mr. Stark says, but there's a longing in his eyes that belies his words. The papers haven't said he's with anyone new. Steve hopes that someday he can find someone who makes him happy. "I know we've never really gotten the chance to talk, but if you ever want to, the workshop door's always open for you."
He hears Jan, down the corridor: "--and then there's Iron Man. He's been feeling a little under the weather since you woke up, but I'm sure you'll get a chance to meet him soon."
When Steve had thought about the program airing, he'd thought only about Tony seeing it. He had, in a vague way, been aware that the rest of the world would see it too, but after they'd filmed it he hadn't really cared about that. He'd focused on what Tony would think. And then it had turned out that Tony had seen it early. The damage had already been done, as far as he'd been concerned. It couldn't get worse.
"Probably," Tony says. "I can't see your hands at this angle, but there's a catch on each side, and-- hey, there you go, you're a natural."
Tony had always liked giving him things, hadn't he? Tony had always liked knowing he was getting what he wanted. And now he was getting Tony, and it made both of them happy.
God, Tony had-- he'd cared so much, hadn't he? That was just how he'd always been. Unfailingly kind and generous. Unstinting with his affection.
Tony choked out another wordless noise. His hand in Steve's hair tightened, and his other hand curved up Steve's neck and flattened against the base of his skull, a caress both reward and affection. Tony didn't seem to like to talk much, but Steve liked the thought of that, liked the idea that he was giving Tony so much that he, ever eloquent, had no words left for it. When Steve glanced up, Tony's eyes had fallen shut, his chest heaving as he breathed raggedly. He was sure Tony knew it was him, though.
"I'm good," Steve said. "I'm good." He took a breath. "I just-- can you-- I want you to--" He took another breath. "I-- I keep thinking about your hands. A lot." He felt like a string strung too tight, vibrating with tension. He wanted everything too much.
"What was I supposed to do?" Steve asked, his heart racing. His palms were sweating. "Let you die alone? Would you have preferred that?"
He knows why Tony's asking. He knows a lot of people wouldn't believe that, merely because of who Tony is -- because he's rich, famous, handsome, brilliant. A man like that must lack nothing. But Steve knows Tony -- or rather, he knows Iron Man, so he knows Tony.
He wipes his mouth off on the back of his hand and answers the question Steve didn't ask. "It's called Hanahaki disease," he rasps. "Ever heard of it?"
"I'll just go," Steve said, still miserable, turning back toward the door. "You can forget about the box. Burn it. Crush it. Melt it down. Whatever makes you happy. I don't need it."
, after all -- as Iron Man stands on the sidewalk outside the mansion and opens the back door of what looks an awful lot like one of Mr. Stark's chauffeured cars, dark and professional and elegant. Iron Man hasn't even told him where they're going or what film they're seeing, but they're clearly getting there in style. Iron Man's grip on the door is dextrous, delicate, even with the gauntlets on; Steve wonders if, like him, Iron Man can dent ordinary metal if he isn't careful.
"I'm here and I want this and I love you," Steve repeated. "You're not dreaming." He tipped his head in the direction of the nightstand where Tony had left the copy of
If Tony got any more confused, his face was probably going to freeze that way. "You know I do," he said. His brow was furrowed. "Weren't we talking about it, not that long ago?"
Steve realizes he's smiling. "I'll have to pay extra attention to you to make up for having shorted you all these years, huh?"
Steve wondered exactly when and how Tony had learned that other people got to touch him however they liked. He probably didn't really want to know the answer to that.
"I'm really glad you're still here." Steve's voice was shaking, choked up. He didn't think he'd ever felt this small. "I'd have missed you a lot if you-- if you were gone."
Steve let his gaze travel down Tony's body, obvious and blatant, letting himself linger on the tempting outline of Tony's erection, still hidden under fabric. He licked his lips and Tony shuddered hard. Oh, Tony
A look that Steve couldn't quite read passed through Tony's eyes, surprise and a hint of something that might have been shame. "I told you," Tony said. "You've seen it all already. Might as well just take the shirt off."
He buried his face against Steve's neck, a gesture that was presumably supposed to demonstrate this. He was practically nuzzling him. It felt nice --
Steve freezes. His heart races, his hand jerks on the mouse, and he accidentally closes the browser window, which is probably for the best, as no one else needs to know right now what he's doing. He can tell other people later, after Iron Man says yes. But this is private. This is secret. And Mr. Stark is presumably well-mannered enough not to go around telling other people Steve's secrets. So it's going to be okay.
He wasn't going to thrust into Tony's mouth, so he trembled, trying to keep himself in check, but at the same time that meant he couldn't quite let go, either. He needed something else. Just a little more.
Jan looked up, past Steve's shoulder to the doorway behind him, and she breathed in, a sharp surprised breath. Her eyes went wide. "Tony?"
"Wow," Steve said, amazed. Sure, he'd told Tony he'd thought it was going to happen, but he hadn't thought it was going to be this soon. It hadn't even been a whole day. "Looks like his luck just ran out."
Well, Steve can't say he didn't suspect that. His heart aches for Tony. Sometimes he wonders who Tony would be if he'd learned he was allowed to feel whatever he wanted to feel. Happier, probably. But Steve's with him, no matter what.
"Steve." He dropped Steve's hand, reached up, tried to touch Steve's shoulder, and missed entirely. "There's-- there's something else I want you to know."
"No!" Steve says, hastily, because he'd never make fun of Iron Man, and he doesn't know why Iron Man thinks he ever would. "It's not stupid at all. I just-- I don't know what it is. Or why you're wearing it." Is this another one of those future things that everyone is supposed to know? He bites his lip. "So maybe I'm the stupid one."
Instead he feels Steve's hand, big and warm, settle on his shoulder, the way he always does. He's a little tentative about it, like he doesn't know if this is presuming too much. Tony wants to tell him he doesn't deserve this.
"It does," Steve said. "I'm getting there. So Clive invites Maurice to come visit him at his country estate and meet his wife, and Maurice agrees, and Clive is just so happy because this means Maurice has now seen the light, so to speak, and accepted everything. That Maurice has gotten over him and maybe he'll see how great being straight is."
at him. He heard himself whimper. Tony smiled, and Steve's cock was leaking even more pre-come, because apparently he was just that easy for Tony, and, God, that was another thought, and he was harder still.
Okay, so it definitely wasn't the taste he objected to. Steve could hardly think. God, that was so good, so much better than with the condom on -- though he hated to admit it -- but, oh, it was perfect. He could feel himself getting hard again. The way Tony's mouth felt, it was easy.
"Oh," Tony said, softly. There was pain in his eyes now, real pain. "Oh, I see. No, no, you're right. I understand. That makes sense. I'm so sorry."
And he needed to get some sleep. That would definitely help. He reached up and turned off the light, awkwardly, with his left hand; the light was on the wrong side of the bed. Darkness fell, and Steve shut his eyes. He told himself he wasn't thinking about Tony.
year -- for one thing, Kang tried to take over the world again -- and they haven't actually had a whole lot of free time to themselves. There was a reason they'd been looking forward to the night off so much, after all. And in the time they have had alone together, honestly, they've spent most of it exactly the way you'd think that two fellas who've just started dating might want to spend it.
"I wanted to be precise," Tony says, his voice still careful. "These things matter. It's important to say the right words."
He glanced up and realized Tony had been watching him look; Tony was smiling, watching him intently. Steve went hot, and somehow he was even harder.
Tony just kept staring. He didn't know what to say, which turned out to be extremely bad because Steve kept talking.
Tony was at Steve's side. He was as handsome as always, immaculately dressed. He was smiling, because he always smiled for an audience, but this time it was a real smile. He was bright-eyed, animated. He was happy to be here, and Steve was glad to see it. He loved when Tony was happy. Maybe this evening wouldn't be that bad. After all, nothing could be all that bad if it made Tony this happy, could it?
They'd already established Steve still had feeling in his fingers -- in his whole arm, even -- and he tried and failed not to wince when Tony pressed his hand against the aluminum splint, letting it mold to the shape of Steve's arm.
"Look," Steve said. He was out of patience. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Either you can let me up there, or I can call nine more Avengers and we can all find out exactly how ugly this can get. I don't think you want me to do that." He raised his shield in Chen Lu's direction, a wave of his arm. "By the way, since you're alive now, you're on the hook for four murders that you were shown committing on national television yesterday. Do you really want to end up in the Raft tonight? I can call SHIELD too. They can make that happen for you right now." He smiled. It wasn't a nice smile.
He was Iron Man, after all. He wore his suit in his bones now. There was no way anyone could hold him back.
"I could come back in a bit?" Steve offers. He has to admit he does like this part, where he pretends that he's going to go, just so Tony can ask for him back. A little thrill runs through him with the anticipation of it; he likes hearing that Tony wants him.
But Iron Man, on the contrary, doesn't seem impatient with him at all; he laughs another quiet hissing-static laugh. Steve can see his eyes crinkle at the corners. Steve thinks Iron Man must be smiling.
, I can... touch you, if that's what you want, and I'd like to, but you-- you can't. You can't touch me. I'm sorry."
Steve thought about the ride here, about Tony's hands wrapped around his waist, his thumb dipping ever so slightly inside Steve's belt. He thought about what he'd wanted. Maybe it hadn't been all right to want it then, but it had to be all right now, didn't it? And it was selfish, maybe, to ask for this -- but Tony had said, he only got one first time. And Tony had asked for something he'd wanted, and Steve had given him it, so surely it was all right to ask for this.
And Tony's thoughts are clearly traveling along the same path, because his eyes fall shut and he frowns. "Rehab when I was learning to walk again, actually." But he opens his eyes again and his mouth tips up; he's pulling himself out of the spiral those thoughts often take him in, and it's actually working. "Didn't feel half as nice as this."
"And I asked you what I was, back then," Steve said, "and you said Wisdom." He was smiling wide enough that his cheeks actually hurt.
So he waited. He definitely did not think about Tony naked. Tony wearing his clothes. Tony in his bed. It was like a decade of his dreams coming true, except, in the most important way, it wasn't.
Tony swallowed hard and glanced away. "Strictly speaking, no," he said, which did not fill Steve with confidence. "But even after the upload, something of Jocasta's core programming remained in the armor. The part of the programming that wanted her to bring Ultron to life. And then it got... glitchy." Tony's face flushed. "Would you believe it if I told you there was an unforeseen interaction with a Y2K bug I hadn't patched? There was. So the part that was specific to Ultron was gone, but there was still the... drive, I guess. The impulse. The desire to be alive. And then one night, maybe a month and a half ago, I was fighting Whiplash, and you know how he is. God,
And, even better, Steve is obviously well on his way to joining him. Steve usually wears a cup under his uniform to avoid embarrassing accidents, but the Phoenix Force's fashion makeover seems to have had no such polite niceties. Steve is... yeah, Steve is definitely packing some serious heat.
"Yeah," Steve said, his voice gone rough. "Yeah, I am." He coughed. "I'm still an Avenger, though. As far as I know."
The Avenger on comms was Carol, though, and as far as he knew, Carol was still backstage. "Cap," she said, her voice taut with something that might have been fear. "Cap, you're really not going to like this."
Steve told him that it wasn't like that at all. Because it isn't. Tony is one of the strongest people Steve's ever met. But he's not really sure Tony's ever believed that.
Steve blinked. How could the worst woman Tony had ever dated have been someone he'd never, ever mentioned? She must have been someone Tony had been with before he'd known Tony. What could she have done to him?
Steve's been there. And, hell, it's not like Captain America can have a breakdown in public either. He's gotten good at not thinking about things like that, things that he doesn't want to deal with. If it's going to hurt him, he just... pushes the thought away. Locks it up with the rest of the horrors, back down with the frozen tableaus of men who died in 1945. A shrink might say that's not a good idea, but the first psychiatrist whose name comes to Steve's mind is also a vampire pterodactyl, so on balance Steve thinks professional therapy has a few too many hazards for someone like him to make it worthwhile.
He clipped the remaining chain to Steve's ankle, ran it up through the O-ring on Steve's chest, and back down to his other ankle. Assuming the harness held, the chain was too short to allow him to stretch his legs; he had to bring his knees up almost to his chest. It was the poor man's version of predicament bondage.
All Tony needs to do is survive, Steve tells himself. It would be nice if there were no property damage. It would be nice if Ghost didn't steal whatever he's here to steal. It would be really nice if they could take him down so he doesn't harass the rest of the world for as long as the Raft manages to keep him in a cell. But none of that is
"You have no idea what it's like," he hissed. "It's been you and me, Tony, you and me, first and second, from the day we met. But you were first. You were always first, Tony, and I was always second. But you're not first anymore." His eyes had a bright, wild gleam, as if he were in the grip of a fever. He was sweating. "Not anymore, Tony. Because I've finally won. I'm better than you and I'm richer than you. And I'm smarter than you, now. I've fucked you, because you were stupid enough to let me, and I've fucked you over, because you were stupid enough to let me do that too. Your reputation is in tatters. You've lost."
Defensive, Stephen's face twists in that archly-superior manner he likes to pretend he doesn't have. "Amnesia spells are very complicated and require a great deal of finesse to execute perfectly, Tony. Under the circumstances, we didn't really have a lot of time."
But honestly, he was just here because he... liked Steve. Maybe Steve wasn't ever going to know exactly how much Tony liked him, but that was fine. He didn't need to know. It wasn't like he could ever like Tony back. But that was all right. That was just how it was. And, anyway, Steve was his friend, and that was fulfilling enough. And that was really why he was here. It had been a shitty week -- a shitty few weeks, really, if you counted Bethany leaving him three weeks ago, which Tony certainly did -- and, well, he just wanted to be around Steve. It was as simple as that. Being near Steve just... made him feel better. It was like magic, except actually good.
"I shall heed thy command," Thor said, and he turned on the landing and started to head up one more escalator. "I wish you both good fortune in battle."
"I don't even know how this works," he concludes, helpless, embarrassed, frustrated. "Do I get him a ring that goes outside the armor? Do I get him a ring that goes on his actual finger? Do I get him a ring at all? I-- I don't know how a man proposes to another man. I don't know how to do any of this. I just know that I want to."
"I thought Ty was safe," Tony said, pain and betrayal in his eyes. "I'd known him for years. We were best friends when we were kids. I thought I knew who he was. I thought if anyone was going to hurt me, it wasn't going to be him. He couldn't be another Sunset. He couldn't be another Indries." His laugh was harsh. "God, I'm such an idiot. How am I this stupid? How am I
It was opulent. That was the best word he could come up with, but that wasn't quite right. He knew that Tony believed in paying for quality; the chairs Tony bought for the mansion, for example, didn't look like anything fancy, but they were incredibly sturdy. They had to be. They could hold Tony in full armor. They could hold Thor. All the furniture here looked, first and foremost, like it had been bought to look expensive. There were plush, rich fabrics; there was ornate gold filigree; the shining hardwood floors were accented with mahogany.
Steve might not have liked the guy much -- and that was an understatement -- but that didn't mean he wanted to see Tiberius
"God, yes," Steve rasped. He sounded-- well, he sounded like he'd been sucking Tony's cock. He was still trembling, his body tingling with pleasure. "I'd do this every day if you'd let me. Going to think about this all the time.  I'd do this any time you wanted, just get on my knees for you."
Well, yeah, of course there was. Tiberius had killed four people yesterday, and he'd tried to kill Tony twice. But in their line of work, that was ordinary. And Tony had definitely dated people who'd tried to kill him. But he'd never looked like this about any of the rest of them, like his faith in humanity had been ripped away.
"Yeah," Steve slurs into Iron Man's thigh. His eyes are falling shut again. This is really nice. "You are."
He reached down, and Tony nudged his hand away. "No, I've got it," Tony said, his voice a little raspy. Because -- God -- because he'd had Steve in his
Or maybe he does know why he didn't offer, after all. Sometimes Steve surprises himself. But then, he's often worried he's not good enough for Tony, so why not this too?
"I have absolutely no complaints about the size of your stick," Steve assured him, and Tony smiled and, presumably, went off to find a bigger stick.
Tony's mouth twitched. He'd run out of energy even to smile. "'Kay. 'M just gonna," he mumbled, and he waved his hand in a direction that could equally have meant
Steve breathed in, a quiet gasp, and oh, yeah, he wanted one of those. That was good information to have. "I considered it. But they had more vibranium in them than I could really afford, even the alloys." His mouth quirked. "And I know from experience I'll wreck anything that isn't at least adamantium, if I really get to struggling."
And he was Steve's now, wasn't he? As much as one person could be another's, Steve was Tony's and Tony was his. To keep.
He was going to get Tony back. Tony was going to be alive, and he was going to get Tony back. And he wasn't about to let Tiberius Stone stand in his way.
." The words came out of him with a little too much force, raw and angry. Maybe this was what pride felt like, if you were queer.
Steve bites back the reply before it snaps out of his mouth. He takes a breath. He counts to three. "That's where you're wrong, Mr. Stark," he says, as calmly as possible. "Iron Man is exactly what I want."
At least some of the gear was probably intended for use on a man, to judge from the size of the gag, the shape of the chest harness, and the sheer existence of the cock ring. And the restraints were definitely meant to be used on a bottom with enhanced strength. But there was nothing saying that the intersection of those two sets contained only one individual -- after all, maybe the box's owner liked to switch it up with their play partners -- and, even if it did, there was also nothing saying that that was the owner of the box. They might be a submissive man with super-strength, true... but they might also be dating one. That didn't exactly close off any options.
"Definitely." Tony's lazy smile is gorgeous. "Make yourself at home. Get comfortable. Hell, get naked if you want."
"The good news," Tony added, with a flash of a smile, "is that the rescue beacon still works, so with any luck the rest of the team ought to be showing up in the other Quinjet in a couple of hours. Now, stay still and I'll go hunt for the first-aid kit."
Steve's shifting his weight and still trying to find somewhere else to look when he meets Tony's eyes. And of course Tony knows what the problem is.
"Trust me," Tony said. "I know what I'm doing. It would be my absolute pleasure to tie you up and hit you exactly as much as you want."
Mr. Hogan presses a button, and a glass partition slides up to separate the front of the car from the back. He must have done this a hundred times before for Mr. Stark. Probably never for Iron Man. Definitely never for Steve. It's all just-- just so
Raising a hand, Steve plucks his shield out of the air. As it thuds hard against his palm, he's already slinging the shield on his back, freeing both hands as he dives for the falling drive.
He hadn't quite figured out yet how Tony liked to be kissed. Tony had made some inroads into their lifetime drought of kisses, all right, but they'd all been different. And none of them had been precisely this, the way you wanted to kiss someone to really get them going. And he didn't know exactly what Tony liked, in that regard.
Iron Man laughs, a quiet sad little sound. There are still tears in his eyes. "In about ten seconds," Iron Man says, "you're going to see why that's entirely the wrong question."
Tony smiled a tired smile. "I do know that. But the awful thing is, she still wasn't the worst girlfriend I've ever had."
In another second, Steve had caught the stand as Tony sank back onto the bed. These were the nanites, Steve realized, the nanites for DreamVision -- but that didn't explain why Tony had them in an IV and Tiberius didn't. Clumsily, Tony fumbled the headset off his face -- thankfully with the hand that didn't have the IV in -- and then he seemed to figure out where he was and what he was -- or wasn't -- wearing. He looked down at himself and his gaze caught on his own chest, and then darted back up to Steve, clearly wary of his reaction.
And Tony loves sucking cock, Steve knows, and when he's already down in subspace like this it brings him even further down, lets him lose himself in the rhythm. He's all feeling now, no thoughts -- that genius brain of his is going to stay quiet for the rest of the night. Steve likes it when Tony's like this, this side of him that he so rarely gets to see. No barriers. No masks. No shame. Nothing but happiness. He can give Tony that.
"There you are," Iron Man murmurs. "It's all right. I'm not offended. I'm... flattered, actually. It means a lot to me that you'd still want me, not knowing a thing about what I look like, and-- and knowing the rest of it. It'd be more than a lot of people could take, trust me."
was a hell of a question, though. Honestly, Steve couldn't put a date on it. It wasn't as if there'd been a day he didn't love Tony and then a day he did. It didn't work like that. His life had had a rather astonishing number of definite beginnings in it, but that hadn't been one of them.
"There," Tony said, smiling. "How are you doing? Feeling a little better now with some food in you, maybe?"
"Of course," Tony said, smiling. "God, look at you. You can have my mouth. Just give me a second, okay?"
"I know," Tony said. "I've got this." He stepped back, tested his swing again. "Okay. This is going to hurt."
Relief flashes through Mr. Stark's eyes -- but then he frowns, clearly confused. "Then what's the problem?"
"Then I'm also sorry," Steve says. "I didn't mean to surprise you that badly. If I'd known, I'd have gone about this differently."
Steve reaches out and catches Tony's hand in his. Tony's fingers have stilled now, but he squeezes Steve's hand with an unexpectedly fierce grip.
"I'm happy to share some of my body heat," Steve offers, after an excruciating minute of watching Tony shake and suffer in silence. "I've got lots to go around."
Tony had that armor-summoning watch these days, after all; if something went really wrong, he could call the armor.
Monica, though. Monica had some potential. Or at least, unlike the previous four people, she didn't have
It was probably all just his imagination, anyway. After all, Tony seemed to really like the guy. Tiberius couldn't be as terrible as Steve feared. And Tony usually had good taste in friends. He had to be good, then, didn't he? Maybe Steve just wasn't giving him enough of a chance.
"I met her while Obadiah Stane was, as you say, plotting corporate takeover," he began. "Not that I knew it was him or what was even going on, at the time. But I was... stressed. And Indries was there. And she was--" Tony cut himself off. "It doesn't really matter why I fell for her, does it? I loved her. And I thought she loved me. I figured, hey, no obvious attempts at corporate espionage this time, I was safe, right?" He laughed. "Not so much. But I told her everything about myself, because, well, I thought I could trust her. Not a lot of people knew I was sober, back then. I mean, you did. The team did. Not a lot of other people did. And she did."
"So good, Steve," Iron Man breathes, and even though Steve can't help but be flattered -- wow, he wasn't kidding about being starved for human contact. He leans a little closer on the couch, not quite close enough to press against him.
He has to keep Tony safe. The way he's going to keep Tony safe is by taking point. He's going to take Ghost down. And if Tony's trailing behind him, that's okay. That just means Tony's safer.
Steve recaptured his hand, and when Tony tugged his fingers out of Steve's grasp, he instantly regretted the flash of confusion and hurt in Steve's eyes. But he had to get to his faceplate. He didn't make it. His hand sagged away. He'd just have to try again.
. Steve's in favor of that, because maybe that means Iron Man will get to have some of the leftovers when they're done. Iron Man had ordered for both of them, and he'd signed the receipt at the door, so Steve supposes he paid too, somehow, but Steve hadn't even seen him tip the guy. Maybe it's one of the things the future does differently, but Steve thinks you should pay someone who brings you something.
That's when Steve realizes he knows what Tony's asking. He's not at his best right now either, wrapped up in himself and his mistakes, too slow on the uptake, and that's the last thing Tony needs when he can already barely give voice to his actual needs.
"Flatterer," Steve says, and he kisses him, passion gone to banked embers, enough warmth to make it through the night.
He wants the truth. And he wants Mr. Stark to see that, no matter what the truth is, it's not going to make him love Iron Man any less. It can't. Because nothing can.
hurt Tony; the lightest of marks from the rope still remain from earlier this evening, just where his lower back curves and fills out, disappearing under the towel. It was intentional. Tony likes a few rough spots in interesting places, and Steve was very happy to do that for him. But now isn't the time.
And yet, here Tony is, with flowers blossoming in his chest for a man whom everyone now knows has been dead since 1945. The never-ending parade of psychologists confirm that Tony knows this too. Tony's grasp on reality is perfect. He just has an unrequited crush on Captain America. Who happens to be dead.
And that, that was actually concerning. That was something that Tony could manage to be concerned about even while, well, on morphine. Not a lot of people knew that Tony was sober now, after the whole incident with the Carnelian ambassador. It wasn't exactly public knowledge. But Steve knew. And Steve should have known -- Steve
Tony nodded. His eyes were sliding shut. He turned halfway over, burrowing against Steve's shoulder, throwing an arm over him like he needed to hold Steve as close as humanly possible in order to experience true contentment. Steve was more than fine with this.
"Nothing anywhere close to what you were planning to do to me," Tony said, calmly. "When you were trying to ruin my mind there, at the end, I hit you back. The cerebellum's such a finicky little part of the brain, isn't it? Don't worry, the muscle weakness should only last a little while. Hours. Maybe a few days, tops, on your legs. DreamVision really shouldn't permit that. I know you assured me last week that the hardware version in production was perfectly safe and wouldn't allow the user to come to harm. It's a shame that someone disabled the safeguards on this prototype unit, isn't it?"
Steve was well out of the way, now running right, putting up a great distraction, as Tony fired. The shot was perfectly aimed, center of mass, enough repulsor power to take down a baseline human without much in the way of additional damage. His hands were steady. He'd made this shot a thousand times before. He could probably have made it in his sleep.
What was Steve supposed to do, tell Tony he was easily manipulated? Oh, Tony was going to love hearing that one.
The water turns off. Tony steps out of the shower, towels off, brushes his teeth, neatens up his beard -- everything he'd do if Steve weren't watching. He discards the towel from around his waist and wanders naked across the room to the walk-in closet, and Steve is hot all over. He knows Tony's not going to touch him. He knows he's not going to touch Tony. He knows he gets what Tony gives him, and no more. He doesn't get to decide. All he can do is watch.
ViaStone's headquarters loomed over him, dark steel and smooth glass in an even darker night -- and, damn, that was one of Tony's cars, a sporty roadster in a violent shade of purple that Clint probably would have adored, still parked outside. At least he was in the right place, he told himself, as he pulled into the empty place behind Tony's car. He took a few heavy breaths that echoed inside the helmet, then yanked the helmet off and reflexively reached back to check his shield. Still there. He patted the edge of it. He needed some reassurance right now.
Walders' smile curved, dangerous and sharp, and Steve hadn't the faintest idea what he'd said that she thought he'd caught him out on, until she spoke. "First-name basis, hmm?"
Pulling back the covers, Steve slides out of bed and stands up, making his way across the bedroom, out to the hallway, to the linen closet. He pulls out a few towels and then, after a moment's thought, a washcloth. He heads back in, and Tony -- who is sitting up now, legs dangling over the edge of the bed -- regards him with curiosity as Steve pivots and heads into the master bathroom.
And Steve can't even really talk to him right now, to try to calm him down. Anything he says will be lost in the wind, even with the comms on.
Tony was significantly paler now, skin gone sallow, and his hand on Steve's shoulder was trembling. His eyes were wide, his mouth set into a thin, tense line. His hair was, incongruously, still a mess.
And then Tony stops wanting to laugh, because Steve's pushing himself out of bed and his fists are clenched. "How did I get out of the water? And where's Bucky? How did you find us, Nazi? What have you done with him?"
Steve's heart is pounding. "If you're saying what I think you're saying, I, uh. I don't have a ring."
Tony's lips were parted in amazement. "Wow," Tony said, softly. "I-- wow. No one's ever-- I-- I think I'm going to need a minute."
By the time Steve came back with Tony's clothes, Tony's coordination had improved to the point where he could dress himself. This was good for several reasons, one of them being that Steve really shouldn't be going out of his way to touch him. But he watched him dress anyway, because he had to make sure Tony was all right. That was a reason, a valid reason. He didn't know how much he could trust the part of his mind that insisted it wasn't just an excuse.
Three more. Only three more. He was certain of the people he'd already eliminated. That meant that it absolutely had to belong to Monica, Dane, or Steve. Neither Monica nor Dane had been there today. That would be the easiest explanation for why no one had stepped forward to claim the box. And either of them made a hell of a lot more sense than... Steve.
Steve slid his first two fingers over the inside of Tony's wrist until he found the spot. Tony's pulse was a little fast -- understandably so -- but it was strong and regular. Steve supposed that the artificial heart pumped blood just like any other. The uneasiness that had been within Steve slowly settled. Tony was all right. He'd made it.
"These days," Mr. Stark says, gently, "if you get engaged in under a year or so, people tend to assume one of you is pregnant. Though, unless either you or Iron Man have some information about yourself that you've never told me -- which would be fine, to be clear, I'm not judging here -- I don't think that possibility is very likely."
Tony inhaled hard. "Probably not," he admitted. "I'm sorry. But I do believe you now. This is... this is all too much to fake. I know it's real."
Honestly, it hadn't occurred to Steve before, and he's not sure how it didn't, because now that he's said it it seems patently obvious as an explanation for his behavior.
Iron Man is silent for a few seconds more than he should have been, and Steve starts to think he's made a mistake.
Steve awoke much, much later than he usually did, and then only because something had beeped. Oh. His phone. His phone was still in his belt pouch, and his belt was still on his pants, and his pants were somewhere on the floor because he hadn't really been concerned with putting anything away last night, because--
"I'm just saying," Steve said. "There are probably a hell of a lot of people who could talk. I can name at least one of them. And you said Donahue knew where the bodies were buried. I'm guessing that's literal. He might not have known the truth about Tiberius' parents, but I'm betting he knows more than a few interesting facts."
Iron Man just watches him, silently. Steve doesn't understand what the problem is. Is he too proud to take Steve's money? Does he not want to tell Steve the reason he needs it so badly? He doesn't have to tell him that. It's not Steve's business.
In Steve's fantasies, of course, Tony turned to him. In Steve's fantasies, Tony realized that Steve had been there for him all along, that Steve would never hurt him, that Steve had loved him all along.
He was dimly aware of Steve's shield sailing across the room somewhere above him, as Steve neatly took out the last of their assailants. Steve raised a hand for the shield on the rebound, caught it, and then kept running toward Tony.
Oh, good, an answer he'd actually practiced. "They'd be exactly the same thoughts." His voice was crisp. "Since I was only made aware of Whiplash's death after the fact, I'm unable to provide that level of real-time evidence, but Iron Man has assured me that he was not responsible for Whiplash's murder. As has Tony. I believe both of them. Wholeheartedly."
It's their anniversary. They've been dating for a year. They deserve this, don't they? God knows Steve has a terrible time admitting when he needs something, but even if he can't quite bring himself to say that
Mr. Stark winces; clearly he finally understands Steve's concern. He pauses. He licks his lips. "He wouldn't have died, you know," he says.
Steve's chest rose and fell under Tony's hand as Steve took another breath. "I don't want to lead you on," Steve said, his tone laced with apology, "but the things I think about, the things I like to do, the things I want you to do to me, Tony... they're not-- they're not vanilla."
The Avengers always rescued him in the end, didn't they? The Avengers were going to find him. The Avengers--
This got an even better reaction. Tony's hand came up and slid through Tony's hair. Tony wasn't holding his head down. Tony wasn't pushing him. Tony wasn't even guiding him. He was just there, as if he'd decided that the way to show his appreciation was to touch Steve even more, as much of Steve as he could reach. And suddenly it all felt even better, like this; Steve hadn't known he was missing it until he had it. He felt even closer to Tony, somehow, when Tony was touching him.
"It'd be fine by me," Steve says, and he can see the tension in Iron Man disappear, like a magic trick; metal creaks as he finally lets himself move. "I'm just happy you're here, Shellhead." He smiles again. "You want to come sit with me, see if you feel any better? We don't have to talk about it. I promise."
Tony smiled back, even if Steve couldn't see him, and turned to clomp his way up the broken escalator.
He knew the guilt was written across his face, because Steve's skin went bone-white. "Oh, God," Steve said, low and miserable.
Steve's cock was a definite fan of the view, and he couldn't help but rock a little against Tony's leg, in a vain attempt to relieve some of the pressure that was building there again.
Tony looked like he wanted to go right back to Manhattan and punch Tiberius in the face. "Excuse me. He said
The next thing he registers is Tony's hands gently pulling him away from his cock. Tony rolls back in his chair to make room for Steve to stand, as he does up his fly. The light outside is brighter; the sun must be higher in the sky. Steve doesn't move.
Steve can't say as he's too thrilled about seeing Mr. Stark again, given how their last conversation went, but Iron Man wouldn't have made the offer if it weren't all right. He hopes it's going to be all right. Maybe Iron Man talked to Mr. Stark and convinced him to change his mind about them.
They land. Steve can tell when the autopilot cuts out, because the armor shudders and wobbles as Tony holds his hands out, too slowly. They jolt when they hit the ground. Steve steps off Tony's feet but keeps one hand against Tony's back, out of habit. Tony did say the suit would keep him upright, but if Steve has to he can catch him one-handed. He's done it before. In the armor, Tony weighs several hundred pounds. It dislocated Steve's shoulder. But he'll do it again if he has to. He just hopes he doesn't have to.
This right here, this is the part that doesn't make any sense. "Of course I like you," Steve says. "Why would you think I don't like you?" Steve told him he wanted to
And telling Tony that he should have known Steve would be okay with it because he should have remembered Steve had a hell of a lot of gay friends was just going to be
He tapped Steve lightly on his other thigh, and then a little harder; he peppered the backs of his thighs with taps of the crop, as many as he could, going for speed rather than finesse. Steve was starting to look nicely pink, his skin heating up, although with the way Steve handled actual injuries, Tony was sure he was going to get maybe thirty seconds of that at most.
Thanks to a bit of inspired tactical thinking, Steve had managed to take out most of the rest of the vampires as they were attacking SHIELD earlier tonight; he'd taken Perun's hammer and teleported the whole damn Triskelion, vampires and all, into the middle of Iran. Where it was daytime.
A curl of hair falls across Tony's forehead as he tips his face into Steve's shoulder. Steve doesn't have a hand free to push it back for him.
"I know." Tony glanced away. He was drumming his fingers on his thighs in obvious discomfort. "But that-- that was all it was, okay? That's-- no one ever-- it wasn't more than that. With anyone."
"So you say." Tony's face was still flushed. "So, no," he concluded, on a sigh. "You don't smell like him all." Tony didn't seem to want to say his name. Steve didn't blame him. "These days he's wearing Clive Christian No. 1," he added, which meant nothing to Steve but clearly meant something to Tony. "The bottle's got eighteen-karat gold and an actual five-carat diamond on it. Costs a fortune. He spends a whole lot of money on that kind of stuff. He'd probably bathe in the blood of virgins if he could get away with it." Tony's nose was wrinkled in distaste. "He's... showy. Conspicuous. Wants everyone to know he has more money than God. He's always been like that. You probably noticed. That's not-- I'm not like that. You know I'm not like that. And I don't like that. I've never liked that. I'd never, ever confuse you with him. And I'd much, much rather be with you. I've-- I've always wanted you. Always."
Thankfully, Iron Man doesn't seem to have picked up on it; his voice, even through the filters, is thin and nervous. "So this is the part where I was hoping you wouldn't laugh at me."
"Well," Steve says, and he can hear the stubbornness in his own voice as he digs his heels in and carves out his territory, as he holds out optimism in both hands, free for the taking. "What if this is the time it finally goes right, huh?"
Tony stared at Steve like he was crazy. "Don't be silly, Cap!" he scoffed. "Of course he couldn't promise that!"
Tony's smile is gentle, even though he's still a tear-stained mess. "Seriously, though. I think you're the only person I've ever met who I can be absolutely certain never liked me for my money. It was nice." He sighs. The smile fades. "It was all true, you know. Everything I told you. Obviously I didn't tell you... who I was, but I've never lied to you. For what it's worth. And I've told you a hell of a lot of things I never thought I would tell anyone else."
Huh. Tony definitely knew that Steve was human underneath the cowl, so that couldn't have been the thing surprising him.
Steve eats his cereal in slightly fraught silence and gets up to wash his dishes. When he heads to the door, Mr. Stark turns around.
Tony draped his arms over Steve, bonelessly, and let Steve rest there in his lazy, sated embrace. His kiss was slow and tender. He traced one hand down Steve's side, and he smiled even wider as he found Steve still hard.
Even when Iron Man's available, he's never available continuously. Steve always figured he'd be the one with the annoyingly early bedtime, but every night he sees Iron Man, Iron Man always has to excuse himself, and he never actually gives excuses. Steve's wondered if it's some kind of medical problem, but surely anyone who spends his day in a suit of armor, fighting supervillains, would be in perfect health. He knows it's not his place to ask about that, either. Iron Man's good enough to fight with the Avengers, and that's all that should concern Steve. If Iron Man wants to tell him, he'll tell him. Steve understands. Iron Man values his privacy.
"Hey," Tony said, gently, pulling back, smiling, stroking his face again. "None of that. You smell great. Really nice. A lot like your uniform. Leather. Actual leather, not a fragrance. There's still some of that in your uniform, you know, the leather. You almost always smell like leather and Ivory soap. Clean and kind of gingery. I like it a lot."
Carol hugged him even harder, and all the air jolted out of his lungs. It was all right. He didn't need to breathe, did he? His eyes were hot again. He needed to not cry on Carol's shoulder.
Tony's lips parted in surprise, and he looked possibly even more distressed now than he had at the actual injury. "Carol? But she--" He sounded deeply confused. "I talked to her Friday night, and she seemed fine. She wasn't having any, uh, problems." They both knew what
He tried to find some kind of silver lining to this. So maybe Tony hadn't trusted him with this in the beginning, or five years ago. Maybe Tony hadn't even trusted him with this six weeks ago. But Tony trusted him now. That was worth something.
"Mmm," Walders said. The noise sounded oddly like a dismissal. "And what would you say about the possibility that Iron Man himself -- perhaps acting on Mr. Stark's orders -- was responsible for the explosion?"
He drops the identicard on the dresser as Tony, his gaze not quite tracking right, tries to raise his bound hands in Steve's direction. It's not easy, since his arms are still behind his back, but his intentions are clear.
"One of you call Damage Control, please," Steve said, hoarsely. The police were probably on the scene, but Damage Control was better equipped for supervillain disaster areas. "Cleanup in Central Park. Tell them to bring hazmat suits. There's radiation."
"Jan, honey," Hank said, sounding a little desperate, "I'm sure St-- I'm sure Cap has better things to talk about in his free time--"
Steve couldn't very well say he didn't want to. "Of course, Tiberius." He didn't offer his own name. "I'm sorry, but you'll still have to call me Captain America. Secret identity. You understand."
"Nah, Steve's the sweetest," Tony said, faceplate pushed up now, in the privacy of their own home, smiling fondly at Steve. "I'm just along for the ride, really."
Tony's mouth tipped up, a sad smile. "I didn't tell you I was queer. I know." His throat worked, and the worst part was that Steve couldn't tell him he was wrong. He couldn't tell him he wasn't upset. He couldn't tell him he didn't feel betrayed. And then Tony met his eyes, and Steve realized Tony was well aware of that.
The voices from next door are louder, angrier, a babble of irked speech, and Steve fervently hopes that doesn't mean something is really, really wrong.
Once, the paparazzi had caught them out to lunch at a cafe, and there were more pictures of Steve grinning like a sentimental idiot at Tony, sandwich already forgotten, while Tony sipped his milkshake through the straw wedged in the mouth-slit of his mask.
Tony reached out, his fingers catching and dragging along the scales of Steve's uniform as he tried and failed to grab his shoulder. "No," Tony finally managed to blurt out, which was all he could say and yet wasn't enough because Steve was still moving.
Tony hadn't really known how to approach the matter of their relationship in his explanation. He hadn't said anything. "Sure," he says, only a little wary. "We're good friends."
Steve's eyes open immediately. He props himself up, squinting into the light of the corridor beyond Tony.
Tony nodded, and he looked like he was listening with his full attention. He looked like he understood. "I know."
And then, on the other side of the room, Tony raises his head, as much as he can in his bonds. He coughs. His gaze is a little clearer; he must have figured out what's going on. "I'll take care of it, Wasp," Tony rasps, a little too throatily, and Steve sincerely hopes Jan will refrain from trying to guess why Tony's voice is so hoarse right now and-- wait.
It's a factual explanation, and Steve's positive Tony doesn't mean anything else by it, and furthermore that he definitely doesn't mean for Steve's brain to hop, skip, and jump down a chain of inferences to come up with a solution.
He turned and headed back the way he'd come, practically running. He needed to get out of here. Fast. His face was hot, everything in him tense and twisted, and he didn't think he could hold himself together much longer.
This is the line. The bombs should have been the line. He should have stood up with Steve and walked out of the Necropolis then. He can't do this.
. One day you'll find them. I know you will. And it'll be real. They'll see you, and they'll love you for who you are. They'll love you just as much as you'll love them."
Hearing Iron Man say his name like that, low and somehow tender even with the way the armor distorts his voice, makes Steve shiver.
He turned around, making sure he was at an angle where he couldn't see Tony in the mirror. There. Tony would appreciate that, wouldn't he?
can be the one to explain to the ambassador from Transia that we can't come save them from Annihilus right now because he's busy blackmailing us." Steve could feel his mouth twist. "I'm sure the resulting geopolitical disaster will go over very well with his superiors."
"Is that okay?" Tony panted out, and he started to lift his hand away, like he was worrying Steve didn't like it.
Yeah, no, okay, he was moving on. Thor, despite having super-strength, was also out of the running, for the simple reason that he'd found the box and said he hadn't known whose it was. If it had been his box, he would have just taken it and not said a word to the rest of them, end of story. Thor had always at least liked him, ever since the early days, so maybe Tony could understand him having a crush -- but, logically speaking, Thor had already excluded himself.
"I really didn't," Tony said, quietly. "You got the edited version. Because what actually happened, in most of the dreams you were in, was that he gave me a whole lot of nightmares where you informed me that you were never, ever going to love me. For a variety of reasons that he was very happy to have you enumerate." He exhaled raggedly. "Then he figured out it was even more fun if he had you tell me you loved me first before telling me that it was all a lie and that you would never feel that way about me."
Tony's voice was quiet, but decisive. Determined. He wasn't afraid to cross Steve. He'd never been, and he still wasn't. Part of Steve was actually happy that Tony was willing to disagree with him, that Tony was still Tony, that Steve wasn't going to be able to push him under and expect him to give way because he loved him. He knew Tiberius had done that to Tony. God, he knew he used to try to do that to Sharon; not, he hoped, to the same extent, but he still remembered the times he'd tried to get her to quit SHIELD for him. So it was comforting, in a way, to know that this was going to be different from their past relationships. They were still going to be themselves. They were going to be the way they'd always been with each other. That was good.
Tony opened his eyes, which were already a little watery -- God, he'd been starting to tear up -- and blinked at him twice before lifting his head. Steve could feel him breathe and relax, and then Tony pulled off entirely, grinning an uncertain grin and licking the tip of Steve's cock, then a little lower, his tongue swiping just under the head of Steve's cock, where he was the most sensitive -- and Steve knew he was almost undone. Even with the condom, this wasn't going to take long.
"I love it," Steve says, fervently. "You feel so nice. And you're plenty interesting, as far as I'm concerned."
Steve shook his head. "It was illegal," he murmured. "I wasn't going to report them and lose two of my best men because the world thought it was wrong for them to love each other. So I kept their secret for them. I know they hated that it had to be a secret, but that was how it was, back then."
Steve pushed up, wiped his mouth on the back of his hand, decided that hadn't done much, and then gave a little more care to wiping up the mess he'd made of Tony's leg. It was mostly on the sheets. He was probably going to end up sleeping on that. He didn't mind, as long as it meant that Tony stayed.
Tony wanted to tell Steve he didn't want that. Tony was vain enough to know that he'd been good-looking once. He'd been unscarred. But then there'd been the shrapnel, and the heart surgery, and even after that he'd just spent months on the streets. He was scrawny, out of shape, and he looked it.
When Tony lifted his head, he was starting to smile again, ever so slightly. A good sign, Steve thought. There was hope in his eyes. "You think so?"
in school. I thought it was okay. Never read anything else by him. And I'd bet Ty hasn't read it either, for what it's worth. I don't think he even bothered reading that one for school; he probably bullshitted his way through the essay. His taste in pleasure reading is... fairly narrow. If it's not by or about an Ancient Roman emperor, he's not interested. And he's definitely still like that." Tony was looking interested, though. Intrigued. "Not a genre I'd have expected from
Right. That was definitely enough of that. Tony stepped forward to the edge of the railing and held up his hands, letting the repulsors charge. Flag Smasher's head snapped up at the whining noise, and Tony savored the muttered obscenity.
"I wasn't lying about anything," Tony says, softly. "It was all true." He pauses. "Even my ring size."
He ran out of words. He was breathing hard, like this was the middle of a battle. His heart was pounding. But he'd done it, hadn't he? He'd said the right thing. He'd told them the truth.
Tony had said an hour. There might have been traffic on the way back, true, but even so, he really ought to have shown up by now.
The ordinary assumption is that it's difficult to tell what Iron Man's feeling. Steve doesn't know if that's an image Iron Man has deliberately tried to cultivate, or if it's one he thinks he's successfully presenting -- but the thing is, Steve's never really had a hard time with that. He wonders sometimes if the gifts the serum gave him, the enhanced senses, let him read Iron Man's voice and body language in ways even Steve himself isn't consciously aware of. Maybe it's something like how Steve always knows what Iron Man is going to do on the battlefield.
Tony's mouth thinned, and he pulled his phone out of his pocket. "Good idea," he said, and he flipped the phone open and started dialing a number from memory. "Honestly, I love him so much, but some days I just want to give him a piece of my mind, you know? I won't let him do this to me."
Stephen nods and pushes himself to his feet. "Absolutely. He's all back together. He'll be coming around in about five minutes. Are you
He couldn't ever lie to Tony, could he? "Yeah," he said, on a sigh. "Yeah, I am, a little." Something flashed through Tony's eyes. It might have been fear. "But that's not on you. That's on me. You didn't do anything wrong. I know it's not that you didn't trust me. At least, not any less than anyone else. I know it's not personal. And I can only imagine how it feels to-- to have a part of yourself that you feel you have to hide, even from people who care about you."
Three down, four to go. Tony rose to his feet, leaving the box behind him on the bed, and started to pace across the room. He always thought better when he was on the move. Maybe he should go flying. He looked out at the twilit sky. This was a really stupid reason to go flying.
Instead, he just grinned back and tried not to think about how his own heart was just going to keep breaking and breaking. "I'd say less than fifty. I think the shield's worth at least a few percentage points by itself. Wouldn't you say?"
"It's not silly," Steve said, automatically, the familiar reassurance springing instantly to his lips. Tony sometimes got into these moods, where he seemed to think that his feelings weren't worth paying attention to.
The sensation of phasing through solid glass is indescribable. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but his stomach lurches with vertigo and he goes lightheaded, as if somehow his entire body knows this isn't somewhere he's supposed to be.
into him. There's a heavy weight, dropping suddenly onto his back, and as the drive skids just out of reach Steve twists his head back to try to take stock of the situation -- and there's nothing. There's no one there.
Iron Man shuffles forward and brandishes the bowl, his hand thrust out like it's the most aggressive present in the entire world. Steve takes it, has a piece, just to be polite, and then sets the bowl on the little table next to the couch.
Jan's face scrunched up in frustration and annoyance. Annoyance that Steve definitely deserved. And then she leaned in a little closer, scrutinizing him. "Steve, are you all right?" She sounded concerned. "What's the matter?"
Maybe they should have planned the scene out more, because Tony was rapidly running out of the physical capacity to land heavy blows. In fact, he was pretty much done with that. But Steve needed more. They both did. They needed something else. Tony was flying on instinct here, but, hell, he hadn't gone wrong yet. "Well, you're nicely bruised-up," he said. "So maybe I'm done hurting you." But before Steve's face could fall, he added. "This is the really fun part. The part where
." Tiberius laughed, exulting, delighted. He clicked his tongue. "That wasn't the secret I was talking about."
There were more tears welling up in Tony's eyes, coursing down his face. He couldn't see again. "I'm sorry," he rasped. "I'm so sorry. I was afraid. I was a coward. I waited too long. It shouldn't be like this. I should have-- I should have told you before--"
He'd wanted Tiberius to be good for Tony. He'd believed he was good for Tony. After all, Tiberius was making Tony so happy. And he was Tony's oldest friend, and Tony's taste in friends was impeccable. Tony wouldn't be friends with someone who would have done this to him. Tony wouldn't fall in love with someone who would have done this to him... would he?
"Both," Steve said, with a grin. "He was a lot less classic when I read him the first time, while I was stationed in London. I borrowed a couple of his novels from somebody. Traded them a few of those Armed Services Editions. We all swapped books when we were done with them. I read everything I could get my hands on, in the downtime. Wasn't too picky. But I didn't read this one then. I couldn't have. It wasn't published until the seventies, after he died, because this is, uh." He swallowed hard. "His gay novel. He was gay."
Tony's hand slid back up into Steve's hair, and he could see Steve try to repress a pleasant shudder as Tony raked his fingernails lightly over Steve's scalp. Oh, he was going to be
Tony has one hour of blessed privacy once his roommate leaves, and, like any teenage boy, he doesn't have to think about what he's going to do. If he had thought about it, he'd have done something safe, something normal, gone to find a stashed Playboy or Penthouse. But no, Tony reaches for his favorite fantasy, for the pictures of Captain America, and unzips his pants.
Steve sat down next to Tony, keeping his fingers over the book cover so Tony couldn't read the title. "Sort of." He turned over his empty hand, palm up. "Here's the plan. I can't give you specific information that you can verify. I can't prove to you that you're awake based on any particular fact. But I
No. That's wrong. He wouldn't be a terrible father, not in the slightest. Isn't that obvious? It's obvious to Steve. He opens his mouth to tell Iron Man so, but Iron Man is still talking.
"Pancakes," Steve said, decisively, and Tony chuckled. "There's a diner down the street. I want to go out for pancakes."
Strange was, in fact, not in the present, or so Wong had said. He and Clea and someone named Morgana Blessing were currently trapped in 1943, apparently due to Mordo himself. The guy sure got around.
Startled, Steve's head shot up, and then he laughed. He was relaxing now. "Of course you figured out it was vibranium. You know what's in everything. I don't know why I'm even surprised anymore."
, because loving men wasn't-- it wasn't a flaw, it wasn't a sin, it wasn't a mistake. For God's sake, it wasn't an
For the first time, the past feels like another life, when he calls it to mind. "Depends how much you were wearing," he says. This conversation is surreal. He never thought he'd be telling anyone about this. "They used to say you had to wear three items of clothing of the appropriate sex, or they arrested you. Don't know if it was a real law, but that was the excuse. It was usually what they hauled the queens and the butches in for, when the bars got raided."
Tony lowers his hand. "Steve, I'm so sorry," he says, low and miserable. Even through the vocal filters, he's obviously crying.
Steve punches Ghost again. The air moves in front of him, and there's the sound of something heavy hitting the floor. It rings in one particular spot, almost metallic. That's probably the drive.
"That's a good name," Iron Man says, cheerfully. "That's my-- I mean, I have a friend whose middle name is Edward. That was pretty scary, huh, Eddie?"
"Really," Steve said, firmly, and then he had an even better idea. "Wait. Here you go." He reached back without looking, got the nightstand drawer open, found a condom packet by feel, and proffered it.
And if he looked, he would destroy every ounce of trust Iron Man has placed in him. Of course he wants to know. He's only human. But he isn't going to do it. It's like the myth of Cupid and Psyche, and he won't be the one spying on his beloved in the darkness.
"Mmm." Tony couldn't help but smile back, behind the faceplate, as he crouched down by the outlet, probes in hand. Two could play at that game. "I'm hoping to fit in a few more firsts before the day is over. If you're interested."
"Like I said," Steve said, and thank God, his voice wasn't shaking, "it's a very nice book. You're more than welcome to borrow it if you want. I think you'd like it. I-- I really liked it, myself."
. Steve could be confident of that, at least. Tiberius wouldn't have arranged the situation like this if he had been. But trying to kill a man he thought was Tony's longtime bodyguard and close friend definitely didn't make Tiberius look good.
"I thought you were going to be easy to defeat," Tiberius said, his words smarting with resentment. "But you were a genius. You were a shy, sensitive, over-emotional, effeminate wreck of a human being, but you were still a genius. And I knew, if I didn't do something, you were going to win. You were going to win everything. And you did win. You won all the time, and you were still so
"Nothing to apologize for," Tony said reflexively, because he was always glad to see Steve even when Steve was being
It was probably silly of him, but, well, he was upset and he was lonely and he could get by on very little sleep if need be. So he'd decided he wasn't going to sleep until Tony was asleep. Once Tony had finally relaxed enough to sleep, Steve could content himself with the thought that Tony now felt safe and secure, and Steve wouldn't need to keep watch. And then he could sleep. He'd already turned off the light, in readiness. The only illumination was from the streetlights outside.
"That's me," Tony says. Somehow he makes himself smile. "Tony Stark, at your service. I'm very happy to--"
Brian had died in a car crash in '53, while Steve had been in the ice; Roger was still alive, and he was very much out now, and anyway it was legal now, in the military, in the UK. Since last year. Steve had checked. Roger was still the Destroyer, even. He was still the Destroyer and he was still very, very gay. The Invaders had been Anglo-American, mostly -- plus Atlantean -- and Brian and Roger had been two of the Brits. And they'd been a couple. It had been a secret back then. But it was okay to talk about it now. It had to be.
At first it didn't make any sense to Steve, because what the hell could a man do with another man that
He could still fight. He brought his left hand up again. Something about his right hand felt wrong, but he found he wasn't really interested in thinking about that as he punched out again and--
This was what Tony needed, and Steve and his hopeless passion were just going to have to deal with it.
The clerk glances between the two of them. It's hard to faze New Yorkers, especially these days, but Steve can hazard a guess that she wasn't expecting Tony Stark on the other side of the counter. With a man.
Tearing his gaze away from Steve's body, he lets himself look at Steve's face. He expects Steve's expression to complement his actions; he expects to find Steve chasing his own pleasure, heedless of anything else. The tawdriness of pornography. But Steve is staring down at him, enraptured,
"I was hoping for it," said a voice that must have belonged to Flag Smasher -- the downside of the guy being one of Steve's villains was that Tony didn't know him all that well. But he recognized that universal constant: sadistic supervillain glee. "And, I see, you were foolish enough to come alone. Do you really think you can escape the trap I've laid for you?"
The falls hissed through the air as Tony drew the flogger back and swung; Steve gasped and rocked into the first blow. He swung again, harder, and then again, even harder -- and on that one, Steve finally cried out, full-throated. The scream ran through Tony's bones, lifted him up, carried him along the current of desire, filled him with a crackling power like lightning in a bottle.
Tony pulled his head back to stare at him. "Steve, it was over a decade ago, everyone thinks it was an accident, and--" He stopped and squinted, and then horrified realization spread over his face. "Shit. How many people do
He feels selfish even thinking the complaint. It's not like he's the guy in the room who has brain cancer. He's just temporarily dead. Undead. Whatever.
