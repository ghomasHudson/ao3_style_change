All direct plot content from the post ends in this chapter (though content from it continues, ie. the flask and the lack of name). The majority of the plot from here on out was concocted in a frenzied late-night text conversation with my friend, 70% of the plot was formulated in about an hour or so which is the fastest I've ever come up with a nearly complete story outline.
“Just for hi—” Dean starts.
When he leaves, Dean still looks a bit dazed, and if he’s smug about that in ways he shouldn't be, no one has to know.
First ficlet!
He thinks it's ridiculous for his body to be so affected by something so insignificant. He’s been no saint in his life, and something as minor as a hand on his skin shouldn’t elicit such a response, yet here he is, his body ricocheting from tense and unnerved to willing, pliant, wanting, from a simple touch.
He walks past Cas on his way to one of the cabs, it’s the largest the family owned and has enough seating for eight, with tie-ups for six horses, in short, there’s a lot to ensure was working properly in case the family has cause to use it.
He fishes them from his pocket, only four this time. Cas motions for them so he drops them into the outstretched palm.
“No marks where they’ll see,” he manages to get out between the increasing waves of pleasure that hit his form.
It’s a passing thought, as sleep once again drags him into its calming depths, that if he doesn't blame Cas, maybe Cas is being honest and doesn’t blame him either.
Every day they find out about another person that Chuck did away with. Unanswered phone calls, silence online, more often than not their deaths are never confirmed but what other conclusions can they draw. Their friends are dead and now the people they saved are dead and every day it buries him more in grief. But he makes it push him forwards, they still have to beat him, they still need to win.
He hears the shifting moments before he flinches when a warm hand cups the side of his neck, the roughness of the worked and calloused fingers exacerbated by the small bits of dust and dirt that have pressed themselves into Cas’ skin. Even still the touch is gentle and soft and it settles something deep within his chest. His head is pulled up and the only thing he can see is the depth of Cas’ eyes, so dark in the low light they might as well be black. Still, they’re gorgeous, unbelievably so, bright with joy that Dean can’t fathom he’s created.
“I suppose I could buy one of them, yes, my pa used to talk quite a lot about selling Ibby or Ringer even if we couldn't get them broken in. I’m not sure who would have bought them though.”
It all seems to go in slow motion, his mind reaching the ending long before his body does. Ringer huffs again, but not like he had been before, Dean’s hand has rested itself along his shoulder and it's clear that he’s not happy about it.
Sam, bless his heart, knows when to push and when to leave well enough alone, grabs onto one part of what Dean says and runs with it. He can also see straight through Dean’s brave face but he leaves it alone for now.
“Ah well, I won’t keep you, I hope you have a pleasant day,” Victor says as he begins to walk away, he stops and turns though. “I almost forgot; I’ll see you up at Jody’s later today.”
He turns back and walks up to Cas, standing so close he can feel the heat from his body reach out and play along his skin. He catches Castiel’s eye with some difficulty, but before he can ask Cas possibly one of the most important questions of his life, he reaches forward and drags Dean in by the shoulder.
“Afternoon gentlemen,” the man says. His eyes shine in a sickening way. A trick of the light makes them gleam yellow in the afternoon sun.
As Castiel hollows his cheeks and swallows around the thick intrusion he abandons his cock to reach below his bobbing head and palm at Dean’s balls. Dean’s hips jerk forward at the touch and his cock hits the back of Castiel’s throat but he doesn't stop. Dean’s muscles start to tense around him and he knows the man must be close. Keeping Dean’s sack in his palm, Castiel reaches back and brushes a finger lightly against his perineum. Dean jerks forward again as his hips begin to stutter in their rhythm and Castiel presses a knuckle firmly against the same spot.
When Dean lifts the pen after the final letter, equal parts of Castiel breathe a short sigh of relief and crumble at the fact that now it’s done, there is nothing he can say—not that he was going to—that can keep Dean here, keep Dean with him.
What’s he going to do with Sam and Jack right there beside him? What’s gonna happen when they get back to the bunker? Will Cas move into his room? Does he want Cas to move into his room or should they take it slow? He’s never taken something slow in his life, not relationships at least and they’ve had twelve years of slow but this still all seems so incredibly
He submits when Cas gently pushes him to sit on the bed, he kicks off his shoes as Cas’ fingers run through his hair, tomorrow he’ll wash, tomorrow he’ll take care of himself, tonight there's no time for that.
“Valley.”
He feels like he needs to offer a piece of himself, so that he is flayed open for all to see along with Cas, to let him know he’s not alone in his exposure. But before he can, Cas begins again.
Sam nods, looking less than pleased before switching topics.
“If you want, I could get my daughter to sew up the tear, I can’t do much for the stains but a solid pant leg is better than nothing.”
“And why do I?” Cas asks barely above a whisper, scared of asking the question, scared of hearing the answer, scared equally of not.
Dean is set to leave no later than four days from now and it's a countdown clock for him as well. Each day Castiel wakes thinking that it might be his last with him.
Cas growls as he watches, his hands flexing and releasing like he can't decide between wanting to take over and wanting to watch as Dean fingers himself open to prepare to take his cock.
“I moved us into the valley again far from where they grabbed us.” He smiles, as horrible as his life has been, as much as he has to regret regarding his time in the valley and in general, his fondest memories all come from his life there. Sam and his unwavering happiness, the crisp air in the mornings of the colder months, how his breath looked as it swooped from his mouth, dancing just as the mist had that morning. His chest lurches painfully against the knowledge that no matter what he’s left all that behind. “I got Sam in school, found a job, and we started living again. It was far from perfect but it was the best we were able to have.”
Dean’s life was so full of negative memories, beating out the happy ones for top spot and it’s all because of people like his father.
That answer doesn't sit right with Castiel. But he doesn't know what else to ask, how else to press to get what he came here for.
He had appreciated the fact that Gabriel hadn’t ever brought up the event again, though he still sometimes looked at Castiel as though he was trying to convey some type of understanding of the situation. Now though, the look of understanding is simply grating.
“Can you get up?”
“We don’t have to if it’s going to get you in trouble Cas, you don—” Dean begins.
He’s still looking at the windows—the debate continuing in his mind though he knows he won’t open them regardless—when Cas comes up behind him. His middle is gathered up in Cas’ arms and something cool touches his forearm as he drops his head back to make room for Cas, who is currently kissing and mouthing his way along the cords of Dean’s neck.
The farm was calm, though energetic, and Dean had found himself settling. Each time he felt such a way, it would jolt him and he’d remind himself that settling wasn’t safe. He warred with himself daily about the ordeal. On one hand, he thought that if anyone was after him, they would have shown up by now, but at the same time, the worry remained in his mind that he was unnecessarily endangering Cas and his family merely with his presence.
“That’s what all this is about? You think I pity you?” he asks as serious as he is incredulous, then he pauses, remembering the argument with his father, how Dean just recited back to him what he had told his father and it clicks. Dean had only been cold and distant because he had heard what Castiel said to his father that night at the house. “Dean, it isn't pity, damned if I know what it is for sure, but it isn't, hasn't ever been pity.”
“What about you? You never wanted that?”
Dean fumbles with the keys, Cas steps in with a questioning glance at him and goes about unlocking the door. His hands are shaking too damn much to handle a simple key. He flashes back to Cas prone on the ground, his hands shaking the same way then, and like a bull it slams into him. Cas is safe, they made it and Cas is safe.
get you back. I don’t care what it takes. You need to hear it, you deserve to hear it. You deserve to know.”
Looking down Dean sees his shoulder doesn't quite look the same and now that he’s noticed the problem with his arm, he can feel how the blade of his shoulder digs into the ground at an angle he’s not familiar with.
“How’d you learn to do all this stuff?”
And this, having Cas like this—as he’d imagined for so long—to have him in the flesh pressed on top of him, taking the control Dean didn't know he needed him to take, out of instinct, is beyond comprehension.
Cas pauses and looks at him, his gaze intent as he studies Dean before replying, “Of course.”
He debates his next words carefully, this man doesn’t seem to know about the power of information, he’s clean of the scum that is a life like his. He seems like he wants to know about him, wants the story about the newcomer. He’s kept in it so long he isn't sure he can even voice anything but he wants to in a perverse way.
“It wasn’t your fault. You saved me Dean.”
. The last thing he wants to do is mess it all up by jumping the gun.
His heart breaks for Cas, in all his years of moving around and never looking back, he’s never had to leave Sam behind. He’s not sure he has it in him to do what Cas is about to do. It nearly kills him to think about what it would be like to say goodbye to Sam. He just hopes Cas thought this all through properly.
The last one makes Cas choke up a bit, Dean knows how hard it’s been to be away for all of these milestones his siblings are still having even with the letters and the visits, it’s not the same as being there as Anna begins to read novels on her own or when Hannah begins embroidery to better her skills in anticipation of becoming a seamstress.
sleep. Lord knows we could use it, you more so than anyone right now.”
“Hey buddy,” Castiel says crouching down. “It's okay I know he’s dreadful to look at but he’s a good guy,” he smiles in return to the small one that Alfie cracks at the joke. A “watch it there” sounds from behind him and he turns to smile and wink at Kali from where she’s stood back, Anael beside her, a similar jovial smile on her face as Castiel’s. “Do you want me to go with you when you say hi?”
“The other me, he said something and it made me realize that as much as I can't wait to kill the son of a bitch, or whatever Billie’s plan is, Chuck saved you, he brought you back time and time again and that meant that I didn't have to live in a world without you for very long, and I can't help but be thankful for that,” he cleared his throat steadfastly looking at the floor of the kitchen instead of the man who was no doubt staring at him if the prickles along his skin were anything to go by. “Not having you, you being dead, it nearly killed me Cas, every time. Each damn time I thought that I’d lost my chance, that that was it and you’d never know the truth, but I chickened out when you’d come back because the thought that I could lose you again by saying it was too fucking much for me to handle.”
When he does make it outside, Dean is setting Remy up with the equipment he’ll need to fix the remainder of the fence line as well as tackle the far gate which had long been in need of some repairs.
Cas fucks him through his release and the pressure of overstimulation creeps into his body but there's nothing that would make him ask Cas to stop; not when his thrusts land perfectly on his fucked out prostate and cause spurts of come to dribble from his tip and milking him for all that he’s worth.
“I’m sorry Cas, I’m so fucking sorry,” Dean chokes out as he trembles. His fists clench tighter into Cas’ shirt.
,” Cas says immediately, chastising his sister for her lack of tact.
“I don’t know really, I never thought of it,” Cas says. He looks a bit unsteady though not from fear. Dean can see his mind whirling, creating scenario after scenario in which Dean would have had to have used the pistol.
“He also said that because he and Kali are leaving tomorrow, he’s going to spend time with my parents before they go to bed,” Cas says almost shyly. “They’ll be occupied with doting and pouring love onto my brother and his wife so they likely won’t notice if I uh—if I come back a little later than I usually would,” he finishes, his fingers nervously picking at the nails of his opposite hand.
Dean ignores the vice in his chest and the burn in his throat as he responds, “Oh that reminds me, Jack mentioned that when he blew up in the empty it said he made it loud. He wants to see if we can make it quiet again. He thinks that if we can do that it might be more willing to let Cas out.”
Like I said in the notes of part one this is a bit of an AU in which Chuck doesn't kill everyone at the same time but instead hits TFW 2.0 close to home and starts with their friends and family and works his way up. This means that the events of 15x19 are pushed back and stretched out significantly but they do all still happen.
The crickets chirp accompanied by the drone of cicadas. Confused birds sing at the moon instead of the sun, though they have the right spirit. The air is free of human noise, everyone tucked away in their boarding.
“I didn’t do half bad,” Cas says with an appraising look at the tree trunk, splintered and broken apart, Holes have burrowed themselves into its flesh, proof of those gentle hands causing destruction. Beautiful destruction.
Closer and closer and closer, Cas grinds into him, he winds tighter, a bow taught and yet pulled still, driven to breaking.
A second later he’s glad the clip is empty as the gun falls to the ground, his fingers releasing it in favour of threading his fingers into Cas’ hair as the other man licks his way into Dean’s mouth.
They stay like that for so long Dean’s arms start to go numb from how tight he’s holding Cas, but he makes no move to separate them. Cas doesn’t try to make him talk and he doesn’t make him pull away. He stands there wrapped in the embrace as Dean actually breathes for the first time in days.
He noses at the hard line of Dean’s cock, breathing in the scent of his arousal bleeding through the trappings of his pants.
Dean isn’t sure if he should do anything more than wave so he doesn’t. He leads Ringer back to the stables but before he makes it inside Inias calls out to him again.
“Much.” Is all he gets as a response and even the singular word sounds a bit strained. Cas clears his throat and holds the gun up, pointing it in the general direction of his target. He shifts some more, hands tensing on the handle, and holds his position to stabilize his shot.
“Okay you need more proof, I did some digging while you all were off doing whatever it was that you were doing, plus I called a couple of your contacts in one of the many phones you guys have here - side note I may have said that a witch cursed you with an amnesia spell so you should probably call them back - and I asked around, now, while I didn't get a ton of info I got enough. We both know about the panty kink we've had for most of our lives, we both wanted our father's approval more than anything, we both feel like we are somehow responsible for our mother's death because if our 4 year old self had only gone to bed without fuss then our father wouldn't have crashed on the couch accidentally, and maybe he would have been the one to get up to check on Sam instead of our mother. Those I just know, there are a few things that are inherent to the makings of Dean Winchester and those are them.
“Just go home, your family is here, spend time with them before you cozy up to your mother's wishes and you only see them all once or twice a year.”
His moan is cut off when, right after Cas gets a hand around him, he squeezes the smallest bit at his base.
His musings carry him up the few steps and into the house, Cas still tucked in against him, now with his arm lifted around Dean’s shoulders. Cas heads into the kitchen as Dean lights a few of the sconces and lanterns to see by.
God, Cas could be thick sometimes. Leaving was the furthest thing from what he wanted to do. But how was he supposed to let Cas know that when he knew how selfish it would be to say so?
His eyelids slip closed again as Cas leans in to press a kiss to his parted lips. Without thinking, Dean wraps an arm around his shoulder pulling him closer, deepening the kiss. He chases Cas’ mouth when he breaks away but Cas holds him back.
“I’ll worry about that, you just focus on getting everything together. And hey, when you get Jack's blood let him know that it’s because of their love that this will work okay? He needs to know how much he’s cared for. Shit and make sure he’s ready for this please, this isn't a small ask, he needs to be sure.”
“What's your plan for it?” he asks once they’re sitting again.
It’s not something he thinks he
When he looks up again, after spending some time getting used to his name, the way it looks, the way it feels to write it out, Cas is looking at him, his face is lit up like what he thinks deliverance must look like and he begs to one day be worthy of such a look. He thinks that with his name, he may be able to reach it one day.
There’s a part of him that doesn't want to leave when Cas remains such an infuriating mystery. How can a man think he is at fault for the death of his brother or the sickness that his sister is plagued with, that the education of his siblings, or the state of his mother is all on him to deal with?
I hated the finale and I hated what they did to our beloved characters so I decided to take the piss with the finale and have them rag on it because honestly what was that bullshit.
“Dean, my brothers weren't wrong, they have never been wrong, you have always been my priority, losing you as often as I had, I fell in more ways than one since my time on earth started. I know that you technically know this now but I've been waiting too damn long to leave it at being said by the other you,” Cas nudged his shoulder and when he turned he saw that Cas had matching wetness in his eyes. “Dean, I love you, there's not a soul in any of the dimensions we've been in that could change that, there's nothing that could keep me from fighting my way back to you as hard as I could except for you sending me away, if this isn-” Dean couldn't even let him finish that thought, that terrible but so heartbreakingly common thought. He crashed his lips against Cas’ hot, persistent and hungry. Cas made a small noise of surprise that Dean knows he’ll replay until the day he dies.
He slides past Raphael in the hall as his brother heads up to his room where his young daughter is napping. He thinks that if he’s to miss anything about not following the same path as his older siblings, it's that he won't get to have the experience of rousing his sleeping child, warm and pliant from their rest. He’s done it often enough with his siblings to know how uniquely special it is to feel their heavy little head thump down against his shoulder and their arms wrap around his neck as they slowly wake up more.
much older than they are, you’re still younger than your parents, that would help remind them that you are their brother.”
The youngest of the bunch run around playing tag and jacks, Cas lifts one of the young boys up to hang off a low tree branch with a wide smile on his face.
Dean would quip back but he’s too in shock at how much their non-kiss affected him. Though he does manage to get an eye roll out in response to Cas’ wink before he’s gone, scoffing to himself at the notion that they still need the flask as cover for their intentions.
“Sorry about earlier, she’s a hugger,” Jody says after she turns back and seems to realize they are both still standing beside her.
“I make supper almost every night, could you not have minorly suffered through a meal so that you didn’t end up hungry before sundown?”
“All that matters to her is keeping up appearances, it’s been a constant thought of hers since Gadreel. Once Lucifer took off, she heightened her ‘participation’ in our lives. It’s been exhausting, truly, I know it’s because she cares but it’s the same thing day after day,” Cas pauses and looks at Dean. “Sorry, I can’t imagine this must be much fun for you.”
“You’re not the first to ask me that son,” she pauses and sends him a warm smile. “My husband owned the farm, he passed more than a decade ago, and with no siblings, both his parents long dead and sadly no children for us to speak of, I was left the farm, now I run it myself with help from staff such as you would be.” Jody stops, turns back to face him and though her face is open there's an intensity in her eyes that is explained with her next words.
“I’m not blind Dean, I saw the way you were looking at Castiel. I looked at my own share of women that same way, landed myself one too. You’ll meet her if you end up picking us.” Dean’s about to deny it—though he knows it to be useless—when Jody says, “I’m the one you’ll be signing a contract with, you don’t need to worry about that getting in the way of your options here.”
He should have known really, that Castiel wouldn’t care for him like that, a friend sure, a lay when he so desired of course, but someone to treat as a lover, to hold gently in the waning light of the small slowly dying sun held within the glass of the lantern, it was laughable to think Cas would want him like that.
A cursory glance at the calendar his father keeps shows that Gabriel is set to arrive in just two short days. They still haven't heard if Gabriel’s wife will be joining him on the trip as she’s getting closer to the end of her first pregnancy and neither knows for sure what effects travelling could have on her. He hopes she’ll join him though; Kali always brings such light with her.
? Ya, that sounds about right. The word vomit speech dies on the tip of his tongue as fast as it had been made in his head as Lucifer starts to be all buddy-buddy with them and the unsaid words scorch his lungs till they are ash.
Their hips roll together without thought, the fire sparks up and down his spine as he’s driven blind with pleasure. It’s equally too much and nowhere near enough for him, but there is nothing in the world that would get him to stop.
A part of Dean, the minuscule bit that isn’t balancing on a razor's edge of tension, warms at the honorific the man uses to address him.
He blindly feels around for the tin not having the strength in him to extract himself from the cocoon that he’s made himself against Cas’ neck. The cold metal is a shock to his heated skin, but the jelly warms quickly once it's on his fingers.
He can't remember the last time he was hugged, though it was most likely when Sam left Dean to go off and make something of himself. Even still, he’s never been embraced this fiercely. Cas’ fingers ball against his shirt and he squeezes his arms in response, it's like they are using each other in order to tether them to this earth. In that moment all that matters is the two of them, grasping so tightly at what brings them comfort, and Dean never wants to let go.
That same night he had walked to the barn with Dean’s dinner and the flask tucked into the pocket of his pants. He had told his parents that he would check on Dean’s healing, granting him more time before suspicion could form in their minds. They sat closer than Castiel could remember them sitting any time before, even during their lessons. And though they spent much of the night talking, Castiel was pleased to find that when silence did settle, it wasn’t heavy, rather it was soft and calm like he’d never experienced with someone other than Gabriel.
“Sorry, and sorry uh, I got a little carried away earlier,” Cas replies sheepishly.
But watching as Winchester makes his way through the words he has been able to make sense of throughout his life, watching as the crease in his brow smooths in recognition and the peek of tongue disappear temptingly back into his mouth when he makes his way around a letter he struggles with is better than anything that he ever experienced before.
and in ask format as all the others have been
His hand wraps around both of them as best it can and adds to the quickly overwhelming stimulation as they thrust against each other.
It’s embarrassing how hot he gets when Cas offers to take him in, the bolt of desire travels down his body so fast he can’t stop the growl he lets out. He cock jerks at the thought of being deep inside his lover as the flush that may permanently stain his skin reaches further down his chest.
“I would have expected you to,” Dean says before cracking a mischievous smile, “and bring the flask while you're at it, Cas.”
“Ma’am I would just like to apologize again for you having to do this and to thank you for helping me as you just have. You didn't need to, it was my own fault for hurting myself and I just wanted to say that this was all mighty kind of you,” Dean says quickly.
He gets a wide smile in return before the feature is marred with uncertainty.
In a sudden and terrifying moment of clarity, Dean realizes that he would do anything to see that smile on Cas’ face again and again. He’s so far beyond screwed.
Dean wants to shake Cas for being so stupid, for not seeing how little he wants to leave but he can’t, can he?
Jack walks past some of the bushes lining the sidewalk in front of the church and Dean watches as they shrivel, almost like their very life is being sucked out of them. As concerning as that is, it's equally concerning when Jack shudders slightly as more and more of the plants die.
He makes his way to the stables, barely able to discern them from the landscape in the pitch dark of night but he stops as he passes the house.
His head is ducked into the cab but Dean swears that he feels Cas’ eyes on him, a shiver pulls itself from his chest at both the feeling and at the implications of what Cas has just said. But before he can turn his head to look, the feeling suddenly disappears and he catches only the side of Cas’ head when he does manage to sneak a glance.
Each letter that flows from the pen strikes a part of him down, when Dean pauses after his first name Castiel worries that he's somehow forgotten to spell his decided upon last name. He silently walks forward, careful not to distract or scare Dean. Dean starts up again and, even more so, each time the pen hits down on the paper below it, something carves itself against his ribs, robbing Castiel of his breath with no hope of it returning while the assault continues.
“Cas you stupid son of a bitch, you stupid, reckless, suicida -, how, fuck
Moonlight plays with the hair Dean can just barely see at the back of Cas’ head, making his dark hair shine blue, shine silver.
“I don't need help,” he says bitingly.
The hand on his cheek lifts his neck up until he’s facing Castiel full on. He panics instantly, realizing just how much he’d admitted, how many secrets and weaknesses he just let Cas know, Cas who had not ten minutes ago made it clear through action—or rather inaction—that he wasn’t in this for what might someday become love. And here’s Dean telling him things no one else knows. He’s desperately trying to find a way to play it all off, his mind whirling, when Cas leans in and presses a gentle but grounding kiss to his parted lips. His head tilts of its own volition and their lips slot together perfectly. Neither of them deepen the kiss; Dean because he’s still reeling from his confessions, and Cas, so as to not overwhelm Dean.

They don’t stay much longer, the daylight wanes as the sun descends west and neither wants to get stuck making camp when it's already dark. They make it a few more miles and set up, Dean builds a small fire, Cas manages to cook halfway edible food and they wear matching playfully fond smiles when Cas roots through his stuff and retrieves his flask.
He grabs the starter and lights a few of the sconces around the room. He wants to crack a window simply for the pleasure of watching the curtains blow about in the breeze but he holds off. He doesn't want the entire ranch’s worth of bugs to fly towards the lights.
So this was my first time writing for real in universe, I hope I didn't do a crap job 😬😬
He wakes far too late, and to the sound of children shrieking no less. He loves his sibling’s laughs at all times except first thing in the morning.
Dean doesn't even have to ask, Jack minorly shudders after Sam lands a particularly rough punch to his side. And that answers that question. Now the only thing left is to figure out how to make use of it.
“Castiel, he needs to take the shirt off, I can’t tell for sure with the fabric in the way if it's a break or a dislocation.” Panic swells in Dean's chest at the forthcoming pain and the map of scars across his torso that will surely raise questions, especially with Cas’ ma, about where he’s come from and what he's done to end up with the marks littering his skin.
He wakes to a sheen of sweat clinging to his body as the sun climbs into the pale sky. Branches of a tree dissect the gentle blue of it, creating lines that don’t waver except by the wind.
“That'd give him a hell of a shock, Cas.”
He grinds his teeth despite the pain in his jaw. The pain almost helps, when his body protests its treatment, the pain reminds him that letting his guard down is what almost got Cas killed in the first place.
He never thought himself stupid enough to land himself in such a scenario. And he was far from foolish enough to think that Dean would stay, especially when he had a chance at seeing his brother, at making a place for himself, and a way to build up a better reputation for himself. It’s all Dean had said (or implied) he wanted. Who was Castiel to ask him to stay? Who was he to keep Dean from what he’d always wanted because he’s selfish enough to want him for himself?
“Will we stop talking about it if I accept the compliment?”
“Ms. Mills’ farm Ma’am, we thought it best to arrive fresh tomorrow instead of showing up at such a late hour, and still weary from travelling.”
“I suppose it does, it must depend on if you want to break it too, harder to accidentally or purposefully unlearn a habit you enjoy.” He knows that at times he had tried to unlearn those particular habits, but always failed immeasurably. Could the subverted hints about Cas’ forays into immoral acts mean he’s tried to do the same?
The very very end of 15x19 and a plot point inclusive yet completely different 15x20
His eyes bore into Dean’s imploringly.
“Castiel could you do me a favour and check the page? I don't doubt your understanding, Dean. But as witness, Castiel needs to be part of each step to sign in good faith.” Jody speaks up, still looking at him.
Hours later, as the day winds down, Castiel finds himself on the porch again, alone this time. Anna had said that she left a toy out here while they sat with Hannah earlier and Castiel had offered to grab it. The chaos of the house had increased as supper approached and even if the break was only a few seconds long, he relished the calm.
He tries to not let it bother him; of course, he fails almost immediately but he does his best to not let his disappointment show.
“Cas. Cas! Hey angel you gotta stay with me okay?” he pats Cas’ face a couple times before running his hand through his hair, pushing the dampened strands off his forehead. His skin is turning pale as the blood pumps through the opening that’s made its home in his shoulder. “Cas
“You’re too good to me Cas,” he says with a wide smile.
He doesn't know how his parents will react to letters addressed from him showing up on the farm for his siblings once he has left. The last thing he wants is for his siblings to think he stopped caring for them. This is the only way he can think of to ensure that they get his messages. He just has to hope that Gabriel accepts.
Cas had evidently done exactly what he had planned to do, he’d become Dean’s friend, an honest to god friend. And Dean had to go and confuse it all for something more.
Snow begins to fall as he stands at the tree, the beehive long since gone dormant, its occupants still burrowing in for their months-long sleep. And God how Dean envies their ability to escape reality for longer than it takes to sleep off a hangover.
“I keep thinking, y’know, back to that night you walked into that barn in Illinois, you told me that good things do happen, and I mean it’s not like I expected you to, but you didn’t believe me when I told you that nothing good happens to me. I don’t know if in the time from then to no—I don’t know if you ever figured out that I was right or not but I think that the one good thing that happened to me was the worst thing to happen to me too.” Dean stares at his name, willing it to actually be him. The cold bites at his fingers and his nose. His toes grow cold in his boots but he doesn’t move to leave; he barely even feels it anyways.
“What better way to let your brother know that you’ve been learning than to show him directly,” he asks sincerely.
Sitting in the chair Cas’ mother appraises him, she rounds his back and tsks soundly, and as odd as it seems Dean feels like he's failed a test he hadn't known he’d been taking.
“My my, isn’t there just a pretty penny or two in here?”
“No, I swear! He told me never to tell you that but I just had to let you know.” Castiel leans in conspiratorially, “Don’t let him know that I told you though, the last time I spilled one of his secrets he stole all my favourite books.”
(See the end of the chapter for
for ‘screwing up royally’ and putting them in that position.
you to stay, I needed you to hear it too. I won’t ever be able to stay mad at you because I never have been, not for any of the shit you pulled in the past. But that? That was a new low.” He sniffles from the cold or from his tears he doesn't know, but he does it all the same.
. He’s nothing to these people.
He tells them all how important they are to him, how loved and needed they are. How no matter what, he’ll never stop loving them.
He picks up his chalk with shaky hands and writes the word out, it's messy, his hands are shaking too much to make sure they come out as clearly as his other words have been. He stops after writing ‘Dean’, and just looks at it for a moment before adding the last name. He looks up again and writes out Cas’ name first and last, light grey letters, unassuming and plain on the dark grey backing of the slate. But to him they mean everything.
Even through his nerves, his smile shows, “He did, he’s starting in just about a month in the younger room, he keeps saying that he wants to move up to the older room but that he needs to get comfortable before he tries it.” Cas had been in intense discussions with an administrator at the school in town, and after proving himself far more competent than their other prospective teachers he was offered the job, which he—with just the right amount of wait so as to not seem overzealous—accepted.
“Dean, I believe I mentioned Donna the first time we met?”
They could all die tomorrow, they could fail to beat Chuck and be forced to live the rest of their lives on an empty lifeless planet. They could lose Jack all over again. They could fail at bringing Cas back.
He watches the small faces for a short time before taking in more of the house. He moves his gaze up to the second storey where he sees a flash of movement as a person leaves from the sill of a window.
Cas is right by the way, Dean does in fact mean Valley and try as I might I could not figure out why.
It hurts more than ever when, even after going after their loved ones, Chuck kills all the people they saved over the years in another blitzkrieg. It almost seems like retaliation for daring to demand that the universe be put back to rights. It hurts, even more, when he realizes how close he could be to the truth.
“Hannah said that she wanted to see you and I knew you were here so I got you for her.”
Chapter five will be out in a few days and like the chapter count says it will be the last chapter of part two. Part three is all but done now and will be out about a week after this chapter goes live.
A part of him wishes he could share this with Dean, he deserves to experience the love and annoyance that comes with being surrounded by family. He knows that having his family around him is making him quite sentimental, but Dean does deserve this type of love, this type of life, especially after everything he’s been through. Castiel would put money on Dean not having told him even half of the hell he’s gone through in his life, being happy is what he should be able to have.
His mind is thrown as he hears the small shaky gasps that Cas is releasing.
He’s gotten dangerously close to something; he can see it in his father's face. The way his eyes skirt around the room more than they had, right before they stop altogether and his face hardens. He’s never had much experience with dealing with that face, as a child he tried his best to stay out of trouble, not wishing to open himself up to the repercussions of ‘further wrongdoing’, and if something had gone wrong, Gabriel made sure that he was the one that had the stare trained on him instead.
It's odd that the nights he’d spent in a bed, wrapped in sheets and warmer than he’d ever been, were the ones that he slept the worst. The ground was a cold comfort, it would suck the warmth from his bones, but it’s where he found himself most secure, most at peace.
Dean’s walking back around the house when he hears who he assumes to be Charles exit through the front door. He decides to walk to the stables instead of greeting the buyer at the house, partially to allow Charles to say his greetings and discuss some details about the proceeds and partially to delay the inevitable.
Dean blushes as he says, “I didn't have the benefit of other kids around all the time while Sam was growing up, so I had to be the one that held his attention, you get good at storytelling when it’s all you do.”
“It was the only place we could really call home. Even with all the moving around we did.”
Charles leaves with the girl in a cab Remy pulls. As the dust settles to the ground, he feels a tension settle around the two of them but Cas doesn’t seem to feel it.
He’s ignored his own cock, too caught up in Cas, in making this moment last, but Cas’ knee shifts and their chests press completely against each other. With every movement his cock slides against their stomachs.
Balthazar and Duma sprint up the stairs and right past him as he rounds the banister and he almost manages to tell them to stop before Ma shouts the same from downstairs. He gives them a look that says, ‘I tried to stop you’ as much as it says, ‘told you so’ and his siblings respond with a roll of their eyes before they walk quickly to their rooms to change. Laughing to himself, because he really did become what Gabriel had always referred to as the long-suffering older brother, he walks down the stairs and makes a direct path to the kitchen.
It doesn't take long for the kitchen to fill with children. Anael is first with Alfie in tow and she nearly cries when she goes about saying hello to Gabriel and Kali. The younger children who have some more solid memories of Gabriel swarm him and Kali, the look on his brothers face when the children circle him is priceless and completely worth whatever nonsense Gabriel is bound to get up to while he’s home.
He thinks himself foolish for projecting his fears and feelings onto Dean, though it doesn't lessen them in any way. A very quiet part of his mind realizes that Dean didn't say his name when referring to him, only referring to him as ‘your son’, but it's so far back that he doesn't even spare it a proper thought.
A smile breaks out on his face that is so evenly divided between joy and disbelief he can’t choose between the two when he sees the curtains strung up in the sill. White and sewn together with careful hands, they soak the kitchen in a soft glow. It’s such a small thing it’s so silly, that in the entirety of the house, the farm, the job, it’s the kitchen curtains that seem to punch him through the chest. The simple fact of living in a house with curtains, when for all his life he never could have had something so unnecessary or something that was such a luxury, has tears burning in the back of his eyes.
He lets out a short peel of laughter and lays a hand in Cas’ hair, threading the strands through his spread fingers and allows himself a moment to relish in the softness of this little bit of the world they carved for themselves in the midst of a couple hundred trees and a bored horse.
Dean lays back closing his eyes at the weight Cas’ words carry. He’s never heard those words spoken to him, and until now he doesn’t think he’s had cause to believe them. But with Cas’ hand cupping his cheek and the air around them soft and quiet maybe he starts to believe it.
He’s so lost in his own head that he carries through the rest of the conversation on reflex, he thinks his father mentions his brothers after moving from the topic of Dean, but he can't be sure.
“Dean, we need to talk,” Cas said from his reclined position on his bed.
The way his name sounds as it rolls from Cas’ tongue could, to others, sound like nothing out of the ordinary, but to him, it sounds like a prayer, a promise of absolution and he thinks maybe, with a name of his own, he could live a life others would be proud of. The way he makes it sound, sounds like he could be worth something.
Dean had also noticed an odd shift in Cas’ behaviour once his father returned. He’d become more reserved around Dean if Charles was present, less likely to joke or engage with him, and in turn, Dean had followed his example, though, not as much as he maybe should.
for a fucking second. Let himself relax, shake the weight off his shoulders, just
“Do you think that Jack managed to absorb some of that power from earlier?”
Could Dean even assume that Sam would ever find out about the fact that he had gotten himself a name. Without solid records, his death would be filed as an unknown and his family would never be notified. As it is Sam has no way of contacting him and while he knows where Sam is now, he’s never had a hope of ever writing him a letter. Even the few coins he’s able to send Sam are never delivered with any writing, there’s never even been a return address on them.
Both his hands come to grab the sides of Cas’ face and neck, the pressure behind the kiss almost becomes too much but Dean doesn't care. If tomorrow he wakes up with stubble burned chin and lips bruised from the force of Cas against him, he’ll wear them like a badge of honour, proof that they made it here even with everything working against them.
He nods, catching Cas’ eye before they both turn and walk towards the barn, the work is mostly separate, Cas at one end tending to the pigs him at the other cleaning stalls. The day’s cloudy, a slight rarity in the area but the heat of the day is as strong as the last week; sweat clings to his back and hairline causing his mind to focus on the feeling while he’s unable to do anything about it.
“Why would you be leaving?”
Dean pulls him back from his thoughts with another kiss, this time to the soft skin of Cas’ inner wrist.
Of course it didn’t help that Cas himself seemed hellbent on pretending still, even after Dean called him Sir
“Ungh Castiel, please,” Dean whines.
“If you’d like we can go down into town and file a report about them, I don’t stand for my people getting hurt on or off my land.”
The rest of the day is a whirlwind, after they unpack what little belongings they brought with them—Cas spends some time setting his books and a small collection of trinkets along a few of the shelves in the parlour, his expression a swirling mix that changes with each breath—Dean takes some time to check the cellar and the food available in the kitchen, he walks through the house, out along the front and back porches as they wait for Jody to come back.
Castiel pauses, looming over him, left arm inches from hitting the bed beside Dean’s head. Dean can see the gears turning in his head as he works through the logistics.
He can’t blame them, really; if he’d had the option to prioritize safety back in the day whenever a debt had been collected or a deal settled, no matter the likelihood of it going south he would have made Sam stay as far away from the whole ordeal as possible. His father taught him young to protect his family. ‘One job, boy,’ he’d always say. ‘Keep him safe.’ His stomach churns remembering how often he failed.
“Cas, angel stop.” Dean would laugh at how off base Cas is, but he’s starting to panic and there’s no way he’s going to let that continue. “Jody doesn't mind us being together, hell she called me out of my feelings for you the first day she met me. Caught me staring at you so often there was no explanation but the one she landed on. She assured me that I didn't have to worry, and while I don't know how far this information is spread, Jody seems to have grabbed herself a woman to call her own. We won't have to pretend Cas. We won't have to hide, though we may have to get in the habit of being quieter,” he finishes with a cocky grin. He’s sure that no one wants to hear anyone have sex regardless of who it’s with. And he’s not sure what his boarding accommodation will be like so it’s probably best to plan for the worst. Lord knows he’s been doing that all his life; he should be damn good at it by now.
He notices for the first time the letter bundle that Cas has with him, the writing is too fancy for him to be able to read from this distance as he asks about it, “Are those letters from Gabriel?”
God, how much Cas must have pitied him when he was first given his name, this poor sad orphan without one, so desperate for one so he could begin to fit in and how excited he got when one was presented to him. He didn't even know if Dean actually meant valley, or if Cas was only saying it did to make him think that he could ever have something as important as a name of his own. One that actually means something to him.
Cas’ hand brands him where it lays on his shoulder, a passing hold on its trek to the nape of his neck, but enough to center Dean’s focus on that one spot of his burning skin. Cas’ fingers fist into the short strands of hair at the back of his head, craning it as he wishes. He licks and sucks along the length of his throat, by no means hard enough to leave a mark, but Dean still feels like he’s been claimed as the flat expanse of Cas’ tongue runs along his vein and flicks behind his ear. He gasps as Cas takes the lobe of his ear between his teeth, shudders as he gently tugs on it and worries it between his lips.
He feels sick, his skin crawls, he’s disgusted at his father, at himself, at the conversation that made him lie, that made him speak so poorly of Dean. His father seems to approve of his answer though, laughing at Dean’s misfortune, and it only makes him feel worse.
Sam nods and passes by him heading back through the maze of hallways to Jack’s room.
“I doubt you’re alone in the sentiment if it helps to know.”
“I can’t trust that logic, Chuck messed around with everything here, brought people back just to kill them again, trying to get his perfect ending, I can't trust that just because we are the same that he will be too.” Dean was close to choking up but clenched his jaw against the feeling, his dream was being dangled in front of him like a carrot on a stick but with Chuck's involvement, it seemed to be just another trick. A ploy to give him the ending he wanted.
With freshly cleared eyes, he sees Dean press the tip of the pen against the paper, nervous though only Castiel can tell.
He stumbles back and blood floods his mouth. He hears Cas gasp behind him and twin chuckles from the thieves. Blood trails down his face in warm streams, he pays it no mind, what’s another scar really at this point.
He sets down the bail of hay he’s moving into the livestock barn and sends a wave across the distance. Cas’ answering smile is soft but it lights up his face all the same.
him but still him.
The young girl is sleeping as she always had, like a log, unbothered by light or noise and she’ll stay as such until the sun has climbed its way well into the sky. It means more than Castiel can put into words to see her so much like her old self, while she was ill her sleep was fitful, and really, it was the first thing that had alerted them to there being a problem.
He continues canting his hips as Cas shuffles both of their pants down to free their cocks. The first thrust of their cocks against each other has him seeing stars, and if the ragged groan that is pulled from Cas’ chest is any indication it feels just as good for him. He winds a leg over Cas’ back shifting him even closer. The opposite hand reaches down to run red lines along his back.
“Okay Cas,” he says and his chest does something funny at the sight of the smile Cas makes when he uses his name.
“I’ll be back in four days to sign the contract and deliver a gig that you’ll want to get Ringer familiar with before the trip,” Jody says as they walk back into the stable. Dean nods but his mind is still elsewhere.
“And they wouldn’t simply give you one? You’d have to buy them from your parents?”
,” slips through his lips as wave after wave of disorienting pleasure hits him. Cas pulls back and taps Dean’s side to get him to shift out of the way.
It shouldn't surprise him really, and maybe it doesn’t, he certainly doesn’t feel shocked. It hurts and he knows it shouldn’t — because what is he to Cas honestly? Dean didn't want to do Cas the dishonour of believing that he was simply the closest warm willing body, but now he couldn’t be sure of anything else.
“I'm going to go find Michael, you just finish everything up. But Sam? Make sure that we have enough stuff to make it look like we’ve actually done a spell otherwise one or both of them might catch on too quickly.”
He lets Cas lead him to one of the beds, lets him strip off Dean’s shirt helping on the right side because Cas can’t lift his shoulder high enough for that—they both chuckle a bit when his head gets stuck in his shirt thanks to the odd angle. He lets Cas kiss the bandaged wound on his arm, lets him kiss the bruises and cuts that litter his face.
He turns on his side, the same position he used to hold when he woke up with a nightmare as a child and closes his eyes, begging for sleep to come spare him from what he knows to be a spiral that won’t end if he keeps awake.
“Nor can I,” Cas laughs, he’s moving slowly, drawn in by the calm haze they’ve made for themselves or maybe because he doesn't want to leave.
There's a force about him that Dean hasn’t seen before. He doesn't think he can weasel his way out of this without giving Castiel what he’s demanding. It’d be so easy to lie, even if Cas didn’t believe it. An answer of no from him would be all Cas would need to go and live the life that Dean wants him to. But the lie tastes like poison before it’s even been said aloud.
It’s endearing to see Cas a bit nervous. The flush that stains his cheekbones runs down his neck. The quick flitting of his eyes as he looks from one of Dean’s to the other. It betrays the steadiness of his voice, the sure movement as he flicks the tin onto the bed.
It’s early morning, a couple hours before they need to leave to make Sam’s bogus claims fit and he's at the tree again. Instead of snow, leaves fall around him, the beginnings of fall snap fragile stalks from their study branches and they all make the softest sounds as they land on the soil.
“Let me take care of you now, you’ve not slept in three days. You’ve done such a good job making sure I’m okay, please let me do the same for you,” Cas pleads as Dean pulls back, searching his eyes for the sincerity he hears in his words.
As it turns out Cas doesn't leave for town when the day breaks, he does however spend most of the day in the house, delivering Dean’s breakfast and relaying the tasks for the day before disappearing back inside, the telltale sound of little children running across the flooring spreads out from the open door in the early light.
“My family’s been the only ones to work the land since I don't know when, I think my great-grandfather was the one who started the farm but it might have been his father before him. We almost lost the farm during the war, when some folks in town had heard that my grandfather was siding with the north they tried to burn it all down, when the south lost, as it should have—” Cas says it almost as a challenge, as though he’s daring him to argue, having no reason to he stays quiet, “—the town ran those folks out and since then there hasn't been much issue, people tend to find out quickly that the town doesn't stand for that bigotry.” Cas picks at the sleeve of his shirt absently.
He’s dressed in clothes he’s only seen on well-off folks before, his shirt and trousers, much above the label of work clothes that he exclusively wears. What’s more, the fabric is free of dirt, blood, or liquor. He stands with an air of authority but the uncertainty of his gait tells him that’s a show.
Instead, he makes sure that both he and the horse are looking as best as they can so as to not embarrass Charles in front of whoever will be inquiring about the training Ringer’s undergone at Dean’s hand, wanting to know where he is in his progress and such. He’s not inexperienced in this regard, having worked for stock shows before. Look your best, smile, answer any and all questions, but do not speak outside of that. He was the horse’s handler and more than anything, wants to solidify this sale for Charles in order to further prove himself and his competency to the man.
Looking down at his own hands he sees the white starred scars that litter the breadth of his knuckles, he almost can't feel them anymore, any range of motion he lost thanks to the tightness of them has become normal for him, “That's part of it for sure.”
Dean Winchester... if he wanted, if he was willing, he could have a name. A proper name.
A part of his mind laughs at its own reasoning. His mild outrage at the course Cas’ life had taken and how he was forced into, and then allowed to continue, helping his siblings. Dean never got that choice, and yet when it came to him, he never stopped to be upset about the fact that from younger than he can remember he was face to face with some of the mild horrors of the world. A busted brow, or a knife cut on the back of a shoulder, an infection or a bone needing to be reset, instead of scraped knees and bruises that most childhoods are filled with, his never got to be.
"Raising Sam was the hardest thing we’ve ever done, although for different reasons, Hunter Corp. wasn’t a thing when we were growing up so our father still went off on hunts leaving me in charge of him, oh and our gay awakening or rather our bi awakening happened when we were 16 thanks to Sonny although I’m not sure if for the same reason, but we buried it when we had to go back to our life, only for the door to literally be thrown open by Ca--”
It's not lost on him that he and Cas will be sleeping next to each other in the upcoming nights. The towns they’d stayed in offered varying accommodations for the two of them, but only one had had a room with two beds in it so they slept apart. Even when they had been in the double, Dean hadn’t been able to gather the courage to slip from his into Cas’. Though they slept that night closer than they ever had, they were still so far apart.
He sees Cas steal a glance at him from the corner of his eye before he responds, “Yes, I suppose you do.” in a wistful voice.
“Evening fellas! Just passing through or staying a while?”
It's amazing as much as it’s terrifying but he’s stopped fighting it. He knows what he wants, and he knows he can have it.
Cas opens his mouth and closes it again; he looks at Cas and notices the bleeding light falling along the shell of his ear as he scratches behind it. When he speaks again his voice is sun warm, but he might be imagining it.
“Okay but you still have to spend time with me, Ma still doesn’t want me getting up and I’m slowly going batty,” she huffs and slumps back against her piled-up pillows.
“I will be, I’ll know tomorrow when it is that I have to leave, though.”
“Inias no, he’s not going to talk about that,” Cas steps in before Dean can think of the best lie about how it happened.
His stomach twists again as he thinks about leaving Cas, and then immediately his heart beats faster at the panic that follows when he realizes just how much he wants to stay by Cas’ side.
and he takes off like a shot, running up the stairs two at a time because he’s back. He's on the other side of the door and he’s alive, by some miracle. Cas came
“Yes, yes Cas god I need you,” he says, rocking his ass back enthusiastically, trying to get Cas to go faster.
“Ma’am I would just like to say I’m real sorry for any curses you may be forced to hear when you fix it up. I'll try my best to bite my tongue but I felt it necessary to apologize regardless.”
He ignores the protest of pain in his knees as he lifts himself up until just the head kisses his rim and slams down robbing them both of breath.
A stone settles into Dean’s chest as his mind painfully provides that he will never be the one to give Cas that life.
Tears threatened to ruin his work by blocking his field of view but each time he tilted his head to the sky and tried to breathe through it.
“I don’t Cas, I just had this singular focus to get you here. I had to get you safe, I—I couldn’t stop until you were safe.” He sounds so scared even to his own ears. He pulls back just enough to see Cas’ face.
, ” he croaks out as he begins to move Dean’s head as he wishes, still with half a mind not to choke the man.
Honestly, that moment should have been the worst of his life, the one that bothered him more than any other even to this day, but he’s so numb now to whatever he felt in that moment that he’s not sure he’ll ever be able to think of it as anything more than a bump in a long history of crumbled roads. So much else haunts him, is it so bad that he doesn’t also have to live with that creeping unbidden into his mind whenever his brain so chooses?
Cas gives his ma a quick look of apprehension before slowly pivoting and walking into the house.
His parents sit stunned for a moment, clearly not having expected any of this.
Dean lets out a noise he thinks the man would be ashamed of in different circumstances and surges forward. The hard press of soft lips has his body taking over and shoving Dean hard against the wall behind him. A moan rises unbidden from his throat when Dean runs his tongue along their slotted lips.
Their tongues meld together, stroking as they stoke the fire that builds between them, an insistence that has Castiel wanting to drop to his knees. Each pass, hot and wet as they lick into each other's mouths, each pull of his hair as Dean’s fist tightens against the strands, each solid brush of their cocks together through the layers of their clothes orchestrated by his hand, has Castiel edging closer to rapture. But if he’s going to sin, he figures he might as well go for glory.
“First of all, it’s
Like always, Ellen shouts a greeting to him the second he gets a foot in the door. He saddles up to the bar and leans against it as he waits. Ellen's husband Bobby—a gruff man who hides a heart of gold under several layers of intimidating exterior (though the instant you see him with Ellen it’s clear as day that he’s far kinder than anyone would think)—pops out at the sound of his voice with a warm smile on his face and a story on his tongue.
It's not often he gets to feel like he’s flying, but he’s not particularly fond of this experience currently.
His throat becomes thick suddenly and he looks away as Dean poises to sign. The patch of sun has moved, it creeps up the stable door’s frame, reaching and stretching its way along the wood, it reminds him of the etchings on the back wall of the stables made by his fingernails.
He grips Cas’ thigh comfortingly under the table, just a sign that he is there, that Cas has his support, and he’s given a watery smile in return.
Castiel sits in the house and prepares to leave.
He’s happy now, safe now. He’s
“You certainly are not,” Cas replies, the heat in his gaze resounding in its intensity, and Dean wishes that just once he could read the man better.
He can feel the rage circling within him. Dean is far more than anything anyone has said against him, far more a man than Castiel’s father appears to be in this moment. And yet he’s sworn into silence for his own safety, for Dean’s safety as well, because he knows not how his father would react to such truths and does not know if he would assume that the unknown boy is the cause of his son’s seemingly sudden change.
If he didn't know better, he would assume Cas was flirting in his own way, gaging his interest and storing it for the future. He's not sure what to make of it, every time he thinks he's understanding a bit more of Cas and whatever it is that is going on between them—if it’s anything at all—he does something to throw him off. For Christ's sake, the man is talking explicitly about being his friend but the look in his eyes tells a very different and very compelling story.
“And Dean you’re fine with this?” Jody asks.
He checks and cleans Ringer’s shoes and brushes his coat and mane. He also cleans himself up best he can, gets the dirt from under his nails, the mud from his calves, gives Cas his non-blood stained clothes for washing, and takes extra care in his shaving though he’s rarely let his scruff grow out while on the farm. Finally, he spends some time cleaning and straightening the stables and barns. The last thing he wants is for a lack of effort on his part to tank the sale.
Dean has no clue what to expect from tomorrow. If Cas is truly leaving for town is he supposed to carry on as normal and work through the chores anyways, or should he focus on Ibby instead? And who’s to bring him dinner if Charles and Cas are both unable to.
The next few minutes are quiet, Cas settles himself into the gig’s seat moving in a way to avoid seeing the house one last time. He stops at his side and places a soft kiss to the back of his hand and then another to the skin of his inner wrist, a third onto the scar that decorates his forearm, before going back and triple checking everything.
“Oh.”
He tries not to seem overly eager when the man sets the basket and lantern down, thanking him before he sits down and begins. As he digs into some bread and the potatoes from the meal, he pauses, looking up because the son is still standing there, the show of propriety all but gone, his shoulders slump forward slightly and his face is marred with a look of uncertainty, though his brow is set with a quizzical stance.
“Why did you set up the deal?”
“I saw your light on,” Castiel says as he walks in past the doorway. He sits on one of the other chairs in the room. “I just wanted to ask about how the farm would change now that Ms. Mills signed the contract today.” It still tastes bitter in his mouth to avoid referencing Dean directly or using his name when it’s so important to him, but Castiel knows his father may still have negative inclinations towards Dean and he doesn’t want to chance anything.
Walking in with Pa is a man, which would have been cause for confusion and keen interest as it has been some months now since his father welcomed a stranger onto their farm. But his presence isn’t what causes Castiel’s breath to stop short. Even from the distance he can tell the man is a force to be reckoned with, every part of him screams unfettered power, strength, and resolve that he doesn't think he’s ever seen let alone experienced.
