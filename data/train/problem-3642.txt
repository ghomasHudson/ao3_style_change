They finished their sandwiches before the next customer entered. They were hit by a new wave of customers, keeping up with them without being overwhelmed. It was certainly easier working on a Saturday than it was during the week. Dean could see how Kali could manage the store on her own, although he had to wonder why she chose to do it when it was definitely easier with more than one person.
“Partly,” Dean admitted, rubbing his arm. “I just need to hunt something. Killing it would be a bonus.”
Castiel probed their bond but felt nothing like what Dean was claiming. He could feel the anger simmering through it, and the deep darkness that surrounded Dean’s soul. He could also feel hints of self-doubt. He latched onto them.
“Just thinking that you’re right,” Dean said. “That I probably show my face around too much topside.”
The guards straightened as he moved passed them into the throne room. He narrowed his eyes as he spotted Dean sprawled out in the throne. Dean was lying across it with his feet hanging over one arm, his phone in his hands as he seemed to be either playing a game or scrolling through something on the screen.
“But why so many?” Dean asked, running the numbers in his head and realising that there were 16 in total. That was a lot of kids.
“No.” Crowley said. “In my time alphas were more desired and had more influence. Betas were just the plebs.”
“Maybe you should get those that do and let them go at Metatron,” Dean said. “Because I think that’s the only way you’re going to get anything out of him.”
Dean picked up his beer and downed the remains of it before pushing himself to his feet. He swung himself out of his chair and stalked across the room, grabbing Castiel by the hand as he passed him and dragging him out of the room. He could feel Castiel’s amusement over their bond, Castiel dutifully following him through the bunker to Dean’s room. Dean pushed open the door and dragged Castiel inside, then closed the door and slammed Castiel back against it.
He blinked as his phone began to ring, Sam looking down at it and not recognising the number. It was his main phone so he could be a hunter with news. He took the call. “Hello?”
“Then I would still be chained up in Hell,” Castiel said. “And Dean would still be trying to escape his room.”
She handed him the broom, Dean going about sweeping the floors before switching to the mop. Kali cleaned the machines and wiped down the counters. They finished closing up the shop together, the streetlights well and truly on by the time they finished. Kali gave him a wave to go ahead and let himself out, Dean leaving her with the books as she finished the evening paperwork.
Deciding he’d sat long enough Dean got up and did his chores, making sure everything was ready to go for the next rush. He kept himself busy until the next customer walked in the door, and before Dean knew it he was elbows deep in the last rush of the day. He and Kali settled into it, serving the customers and trying to keep up with the demand.
“I bet Crowley had something to do with that,” Sam said. He shook his head. “But why would Dean want to mate? You’d be a liability.”
Dean stretched out in his seat, resting the popcorn on his lap. He lost himself in the film, absently chewing on the snacks and sipping from his drink. He noted out the corner of his eye that Castiel occasionally reached over for the food and took some. Dean smiled as he took in Castiel’s wide eyes as he stared at the screen.
He looked up toward the door and whistled loudly, the doors to the throne room opening. Two large demons stepped in.
“I’m exhausted,” Sam admitted. “I’ve spent the whole time looking for you at first, and then trying to locate Castiel’s grace.”
Dean nodded, eager to get his hands dirty. He knew the basics of working on a car. His dad had taught him more than enough to keep his Impala running over the years. Bobby popped the hood of the wreck and let Dean have an inspection, quizzing Dean on different car parts and what they do. Bobby seemed to be happy with the answers he was getting when he pulled out the tool kit.
“We will see.” Hannah stepped back into the sand pit with the two other angels. She raised her hand in farewell.
Crowley stepped into the library, nose crinkling at the smell of the old books. He had never been a fan of libraries. He had spent far too long in them over the years. Mind you, his kind of library was mostly made up of spell books and tomes. He noted that this library was a lot less dusty than the type he frequented so he was thankful for that.
Perhaps he didn’t know. Castiel knew he would need to explain it to Dean the next time he came down here. Castiel shuddered, remember what Dean had done to him. Castiel’s body had completely betrayed him, responding positively to Dean’s advances. His body had wanted to knot and breed Dean, and Dean knew it. He had said so much during their third knotting.
“Good!” Crowley felt his anger simmering through him. He wanted so badly to punch Dean. “You’re a fool, you know that?”
When Dean finally clocked off for the day he made his way back toward his car, stopping by the Impala and putting the keys in the lock.
“Trust me, she isn’t looking for a white knight,” Bobby said. “She’s looking for someone to leach off. She probably figures you’re young and dumb.”
“Well we’re going to get it first,” Dean said. “No punk ass demon is going to take it away from us.”
“You mind your manners, boy,” Bobby said, a small smile on his lips. “I’ve got plenty of other things in the shop that could do with a polish.”
“Got that impression too, did you?” Crowley rubbed his jaw. He needed to come up with a new plan, and he needed it now. “What we need now is some sort of saving grace.”
who owns that thing,” Bobby said. “I’ve seen it around. Didn’t know who owned it though. Ugly bastard of a car.”
“Yeah, I can tell.” Nevertheless there was something almost endearing about him. Dean couldn’t help but like the guy. “So you think Anna’s next move is going to be to proposition me with sex.”
“Cause that’s what I would do,” Dean said. “Maybe even give him some sort of flesh wound so he thinks he’s going to die.”
How was it that he even had a truemate? Angels weren’t supposed to mate. Angels were servants of Heaven and nothing more. They weren’t supposed to love, feel emotion, and definitely weren’t supposed to mate. Mating was supposed to be for procreation and angels were forbidden from doing that. That was why Nephilims killed their host.
“He always brings me something after a test or exam,” Castiel said, pulling out the food from the bag and setting it on the counter. “He’s been doing it since I was young.”
“I don’t doubt that,” Bobby chuckled. “You’re on washing up duty too. I need to clean up and have an early night. Gonna be an early start in the morning.”
Soon enough he came face-to-face with Castiel’s now fully erect cock, Dean blowing over the tip and earning a moan. Licking his lips Dean glanced up toward Castiel’s face and saw him watching him. Locking eyes Dean wrapped his lips around the head of Castiel’s cock, dragging his tongue over the slit. He saw Castiel’s pupils expand and his breathing quicken, but the angel didn’t make a sound.
“He’s perfectly rational,” Crowley countered. “Believe me, he knows what he’s doing. I hope he castrates anyone who dares to force themselves on him. Do you understand me?”
Sam really didn’t want to be having this conversation, especially with Castiel’s sister. “It was a while ago. When he was human.”
Instead Dean’s hand loosened its grip as he blinked, eyes turning back to familiar green. Dean frowned, seemingly surprised to find what position he was in. He let go of Castiel’s throat and sat back. He stared at his hands as if they had betrayed him, quickly placing the First Blade back on his belt. He abruptly stood from the bed, backing away. Castiel watched as Dean practically fled the room, swinging the door closed behind him and locking it securely.
“I only have one truemate,” Dean said. He caressed Castiel’s face. “Why are you keeping our bond closed?”
Castiel’s eyes snapped open as he heard the Impala pulling out of the parking lot. He waited until the sound of the engine disappeared before he finally allowed himself to sit up, the blankets pooling around his waist. He had been awake for some time now, listening to Dean moving quietly around the room. He had feigned sleep however.
Pulling his laptop toward him Sam narrowed down his search parameters. The idea of looking into a library was a good idea and he kicked himself for not having through of it himself. He glanced at his phone and wondered if it was worth calling the angels. Probably not. They had made it clear what their mission was right now and Castiel wasn’t even on their list.
“What about Gadreel?” Dean asked, his mind turning to the other exiled Shurley. “Did he deserve what he got?”
Gabriel stood and gave them a wave before he headed out the door. Kali sent Dean to check and top up the cups and things before the next rush while she gave the machines and counter a wipe down. Dean felt like he was starting to get the hang of things but knew he wasn’t ready to handle the speciality orders yet. He had seen Kali working on them and they looked complicated.
“I don’t think she knew how much I had,” Dean said. “She was just looking for what she could get. She’s desperate.”
“Apparently,” Dean said. “If we’d been the other way around I would have been swimming in coffee, I tell you.”
“Let’s leave the trench coat on tonight,” Dean said. “You look so beautiful wearing it and nothing else.”
“He got away with possession of weed, yeah,” Bobby said. “It was just a small stash. Personal use. His family made sure he was lawyered up.”
“Good,” Crowley said. “I’ll get back to you when I have more information cause I’m guessing right now we’re all on the same page. Bupkiss.”
“That and the fact he didn’t want Dean as a demon anymore,” Sam said. “What happened, anyway? What changed?”
They had also had a visit from Crowley two days ago. The King of Hell had invited himself in, just appearing at the door and entering without even announcing himself. They had almost hit the roof when he had spoken up. He seemed happy to find Dean human again, and even more relieved to learn that the Nephilim was no more. He had left Dean a “get well” basket full of fruit and prissy cocktail drinks, bath bombs and a flower shaped loofah. Dean had almost shoved the whole thing up Crowley’s arse.
Kali was still in a sour mood on Monday, Dean again wondering if something had gotten back to her about him spending time with Anna. He wondered if he should bring it up but decided against it, not wanting to sour their relationship any further. He tried to make small talk with her during the lulls but she was very short with him, Dean feeling himself being put in his place.
“Common folk,” Crowley explained. “Being an alpha gave you status. If you wanted to get anywhere it required it.”
“It would be best if we get him to a hospital,” Castiel said as he sank to one knee beside Dean, a hand on his back.
“Michael has an accounting firm,” Bobby said. “A couple of them work for him. One of them is his father’s editor. One is a lawyer. I’m not sure about the rest.”
“So we’re back to that,” Crowley said. “Is it the blood lust? Because if so I have a few new targets you can take out.”
Gabriel gave her a pointed look and left. Dean bit his lip, wishing he could find out more to the story and knowing he probably wasn’t going to get it. Instead he moved back out to finish mopping the floor, making sure that the floor wasn’t too wet so that someone might slip. Kali went back to checking the coffee machines, Dean noting that there was a tenseness to her shoulders that hadn’t been there before.
He settled in and enjoyed the music, eating his food. The burger was definitely worth coming back for. He savoured the taste, letting it sit on his tongue a moment before he swallowed. It wasn’t too greasy and had just the right amount of seasoning. They certainly did magic with the food at Benny’s. And they weren’t badly priced either.
Kali showed him which syrups to use, then had him make one of each drink while she watched him. She talked him through how to make them and the correct use of the syrup, and how to stir the drink so that it was distributed evenly. When he was done she had him try each of the drinks. Dean found one of them to be altogether too sweet for his taste, but the other was the perfect balance of sweet, creamy and bitter. He could see why it was popular.
Dean quickly killed the engine as he pulled back into their parking spot. He climbed out of the car, again grimacing at the loud creak of the door. He hoped that Castiel was still asleep. Going to the rear of the car he grabbed his spoils and closed the door, heading for the motel room door. He unlocked it, pushing the door open and noting that Castiel was still in bed. He breathed a sigh of relief and gently closed the door behind him.
“I might take a couple of days down time,” Dean said. He rubbed his arm where the Mark was. “It’s pretty sated right now.”
“Yeah, she is,” Gabriel said. “I kind of am too. But I get why you did it. You’re going to have to earn back your respect.”
“I’m not broken, Cas,” Dean said. “In fact, this is the best I’ve felt in a long time.” He moaned, shifting his hips and feeling Castiel’s knot pulling at him. “Damn you feel good.”
Dean nodded and grabbed his apron and put it on. They finished setting up before Dean unlocked the front door and switched on the ‘open’ sign. Before long they had entered the first rush of the day, Dean losing himself in the work. He was finding that he was able to remember most of the drink combinations now, only having to check the note a couple of times with the less popular orders.
“Sir,” one of them said, stepping forward. “With all due respect we’re questioning your allegiance with Dean Winchester.”
“Ran away at 13,” Bobby said. “Moved in with this couple on the other side of town and started calling them ‘mom’ and dad’. Told everyone that Chuck was an abusive father and that her older siblings would beat her. Ended up with CPS involved not that anything came of it.”
Dean lay sprawled out on the floor, his limbs feeling like jelly. He was completely and utterly fucked out even though his heat wasn’t quite sated yet. He had lost count how many days he had been down with Castiel now. The angel was an animal, barely letting Dean out of his reach and thrusting into him every chance that he got.
His new grace had healed his body, Castiel feeling stronger than he had in a long time. He could still feel it burning through him though but he didn’t dare try to burn it out. The last thing he wanted was for more of his brethren to die because of him. He had tried to break his bonds though and discovered that he still wasn’t strong enough. He suspected that there was some kind of angel warding built into them.
He pulled his legs in as the footsteps stopped by the door, the locks grinding as they were opened. He raised his head and gazed toward the doorway. Spotting Crowley he set his jaw. What did he want?
Dean set the cloth down and approached Castiel as he saw the glint again. He squinted, and as he got close enough he realized what it was. “What the fuck is that?”
The sound of a clearing throat broke them apart, and looking up they spotted Sam leaning in the door. He could barely contain his smile as he looked at them.
Finding himself staring again at how attractive Castiel was Dean tore his eyes away and inched his way around the crowd to the door. It was time for him to head over to Bobby’s.
Dean finished his drink, glancing at the clock and noting how late it was getting. “Anyway I should probably shower and hit the hay. Early start tomorrow.”
“Valentine’s Day,” Castiel repeated. “I know it is a busy time of the year for the cupids, but I’ve never really understood it.”
Castiel was blushing slightly under Dean’s gaze. Dean could tell that he still didn’t know what to do with himself, lying awkwardly on the bed. No matter how many times they did it Castiel still seemed like a blushing virgin every time. Dean loved that about him. He knew Castiel was anything but that, especially given all the things they had experienced together over the years.
Crowley stared him down without flinching. He set his jaw. “There’s a pack of werewolves that have been attacking my people and screwing with my business on purpose because I refused to cut a deal with them. Teach them a lesson.”
“Castiel, the guy I was working with, he handled her like a pro,” Dean said. “Grabbed the cup out of her hand before she could even wind up to throw it at him.”
Dean stared at him a moment before glancing at Castiel, then looking around the room. There were a myriad of emotions washing over his face. Sam couldn’t help but wonder if he was remembering everything that he had done as a demon, and coming to terms with the fact that he was human again.
“I am,” Castiel said. “I’ve also begun saving to have my car repaired although I do not know how much I will need.”
Dean hung up before Sam could answer. He set the phone down, noticing for the first time that his hands were shaking. Sam swallowed the lump in his throat and angrily wiped away the tears in his eyes. That definitely wasn’t Dean. Not the Dean that Sam knew and loved. His brother had been completely corrupted by the Mark.
“Explains the sign,” Dean said, looking up at the sign on the window that read ‘Hot Chocolate from Monday’.
“Did you do weed a lot?” Dean asked. He couldn’t picture Castiel as a stoner. He seemed too straight laced to do that.
Castiel relaxed back against the wall. His body had reached the point where it didn’t ache anymore but was rather just comfortably numb. Dean had manhandled him back into chains before he had last left Castiel, and he had no idea how long it had been. He tried to move around as much as he could to prevent sores from forming on his body but it was hard.
Dean frowned. “Wait, this isn’t a prank of something is it? You’re not filming my reaction or something are you?”
Sure enough they hustled him out the door once they were done, Gabriel catching Dean by the arm. “You may need to knock loudly. He might be asleep.”
helping me out,” Sam said. “I want you to have a life outside of looking after me. I’m fine. Really I am.”
“Anyway, the next rush is going to start any minute now,” Kali said. “Castiel will be in about half way through. You’ll just hand things off to him.”
“No,” Dean said with a shake of his head. He wasn’t that lucky. “We work together and want to get to know each other better, that’s all.”
“That omega is Dean fucking Winchester,” Crowley reminded him. “Knight of Hell, welder of the First Blade. He’s what gives monsters nightmares. Better to have him as an ally than as an enemy. He’d slaughter you all without batting an eyelid. He took down an entire vampire alpha nest without so much as breaking a sweat. Now tell me, do you really want to mess with him?”
“I always skipped the meat aisle when I was shopping for Sam and me,” Dean said. “I knew I couldn’t afford it so I never went near it.”
Dean’s scowl deepened. He sat up, sliding his phone into his pocket and looking across at Crowley. “You got anyone that needs killing, because I really need to kill something right now.”
“Very much so.” She checked the machines again. “Anyway you better put your apron on. It’s almost time to open.”
“If you’ve met Chuck you’d understand it,” Kali said. “After all, this is a man who adopted 16 children and barely had much to do with them growing up aside from occasionally checking in on them to make sure they were still alive.”
Dean paused for a moment as he thought back over his previous conversations with Kali and Gabriel. “I thought you were always late.”
“They told me you’d been in the dungeon,” Crowley said. He narrowed his eyes. “I’m guessing with Feathers.”
“If I’d know I’d get this reaction from you I would have done it sooner,” Castiel said with amusement.
“Good,” Dean said, feeling Castiel trying to calm himself. “Now just lay there until your knot goes down.”
“Gonna text Sam first to make sure he isn’t around,” Dean said. “Sam said last week that Dad tended to go out in the morning so it should be fine.”
Castiel tried to put the pieces together in his mind. Some sort of drug that would induce a mating could only mean one thing. “You’re trying to trigger a rut.”
“This isn’t over, Winchester,” Crowley said. “Stop killing my people or I’ll have to do something about it.”
“Cause the guy’s broke and his car sounds bad,” Dean said. “I gave him a rough estimate on how much it would cost to fix the loose belt but my money’s on the fact that’s barely scratching the surface with what’s wrong with it.”
On the plus side Castiel knew that he and Dean had not conceived a child, and he was thankful for that. He would have sensed it if a Nephilim had come into being. He felt sick at the thought – such a creature destroyed its host when it was born. Even as a demon Dean would be killed if he gave birth to it.
After dinner he left Bobby to watch some tv while Dean had his own shower and prepared for bed. He got some reading in before he settled down, wondering just what Saturday was going to bring and how he was going to phrase things to break everything off with Anna. He couldn’t help but feel a little bad and guilty about it all but he knew it was going to be the right thing to do.
Crowley sipped from his drink and considered his options. All he could really do is keep Dean focussed on finding Castiel’s grace. As much as Crowley hated the idea it would keep Dean distracted. That and sending him on more hunting missions. There was only a finite supply of targets, however, and it would only be a matter of time before Crowley ran out.
The other demons stared at him a moment before they started to move. Dean made to get up from his chair but Crowley halted him with a gesture.
“Gabriel uses milk chocolate,” Kali said. “We did try a darker chocolate one year as well but people preferred the milk. Same the year we tried white chocolate.”
“I understand your hesitancy,” Castiel said. “Crowley is not the most trustworthy of demons. He does, however, keep a deal once it is made.”
It took several more days before the cracks started to show. It seemed that persistence was going to pay off. Dean had done everything but outright kill the demon by now, including disendowment and tying his intestines up in a pretty bow before pumping them full of holy water. Seeing his guts hanging out of him seemed to have done the trick, as the next time Crowley came to visit Anton had broken his silence.
Sam stepped forward and began to undo the bonds on Dean’s arms and legs. Once he was done he held out a hand. Dean took it and allowed Sam to pull him up into a tight hug. Sam squeezed his eyes closed as he breathed in Dean’s familiar scent. He could still smell the omega in his brother that was usually deeply suppressed, but Sam had always been able to slightly smell that scent. It was part of knowing what Dean was.
“Most of them,” Bobby said. “They don’t want anything to do with her. Scared she’ll start rumours about them being abusive to her if they do.”
He wasn’t quite as tired come Saturday, Dean deciding it was time for him to actually go get some proper clothing and shoes for the coffee shop. He had admired Castiel’s choice of clothing and noted that Kali herself wore neat casual, and Dean felt underdressed right now. Not to mention his shoes weren’t exactly the best for being on your feet all day.
Castiel looked down at the remains of Dean’s pie, then at his watch. “Speaking of college it is getting rather late. I really must get back to my study.”
“Yeah, I saw what the weather did on Monday,” Dean said. “A little rain keeps a lot of people away.”
“There’s some debate about that,” Dean said. “The firefighters think it was an accident, but Dad was always convinced it was arson.”
Dean nodded, knowing she was right. He finished his lunch and wandered back behind the counter to wait for the next customer. The customers came in at an uneven rate, some stopping to chat to Kali. Dean took notice of how she was no-nonsense and straight to business. There was a fire in her eyes that told Dean that he really didn’t want to mess with her. Not to mention she didn’t seem to miss a thing that was going on.
He wondered what Dean had planned for him. He swallowed hard, knowing that Dean was a master at torture. Did he intend to torture him? That would explain why Castiel needed to be naked. The room itself looked like it would be the perfect place for torture to take place. It even had the faint smell of old blood to it, but then most of Hell had that smell. It lay just beneath the smell of sulphur and pain.
When he got home Bobby was still in the workshop so Dean put the food in the oven and left a note on the table. Dean took his pie and went to his room, eating it slowly while reading more of his book. Eventually he felt tiredness catching up with him. He put the empty plate aside and the book on the bedside table before switching off the light and going to sleep.
It wasn’t long after the anniversary that one of the big holidays began to approach. Kali had pulled Dean aside and asked him to work on a couple of Saturdays so she could help at Sugar Heaven. Dean had run things by Bobby and reminded him that his contract mentioned the occasional Saturday shift.
Dean and Castiel listed off their orders, Benny leaving them so that he could take them to the kitchen. Dean sighed as he felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He didn’t like it when people offered things for free. He always felt like that it meant that he owed the person, and if there was one thing Dean didn’t like it was being in debt.
The rest of the week passed by without incident, Dean soon finding that Saturday had rolled around quicker than he had expected. He was up early and out the door before Bobby was out of bed, Dean making sure to be quiet so not to wake him. He drove over to his usual parking spot and saw Castiel’s car not far away. He climbed out of his car and wandered down the street to the store, finding that Castiel had already unlocked the door and gone inside.
Before the lunch rush Kali taught him where the new cups and containers were stored in the back room in case he ever ran out. They topped off the supplies at the front of the store then settled in for the lunchtime madness. Dean found himself being run off his feet again, the line threading its way out the door. He started to feel self-conscious about how slow he was going, scared that the business would lose customers because of his inexperience.
Castiel thought for a moment. “I have kissed a girl, but I must admit I am mostly attracted to men.”
His whole body had ached for a few days after the miscarriage, going about cleansing his body of all traces of his pregnancy. Sam had given him a hot water bottle and routinely checked to make sure it was still warm while Dean dealt with the cramps. He had kept a bucket in his room for the nausea, Sam even taking care of that. Dean was going to have to thank his brother somehow.
Feeling eyes on him Dean looked up and saw a couple across the way staring at him. He frowned, wondering if he knew them but unable to place them. They looked away when he looked toward him, the two leaning in close together and whispering. Dean narrowed his eyes. The look on their faces told him that whatever they were saying wasn’t good. He wondered what he could have do to them to get that sort of reaction.
“No,” Castiel said. “It was during the Christmas rush so the till was full. He made off with a couple of grand.”
“It’ll be empty anyway,” Castiel said. “The manager takes the money to the bank on Friday night. What you have is all there is in the store.”
Castiel grabbed Dean from behind, wrapping him with his arms. Dean instantly fought back as his arms were pinned to his sides. Castiel summoned his grace and cloaked Dean in it, pushing down the demon. He could feel the Mark burning on Dean’s arm, Dean roaring as he struggled to fight Castiel off.
“I was hoping they would change their mind,” Sam said. “For the record I don’t think this was Hannah’s decision. I think it was a group decision.”
Going off his suppressants was why he was in this mess right now. He rubbed his abdomen and absently wondered what Castiel could sense. When Dean looked himself all he could see was the darkness of his soul. He wondered if maybe there was a spark of Castiel’s grace deep inside him. Then again it wasn’t exactly Castiel’s own grace, but that of another angel. He frowned. Did that make this Castiel’s child or another angel’s? He didn’t know how it worked.
“Proposition?” Dean stared at him, realising what he was implying. “Wait? You think she’s going to ask for sex?”
“Seems to be staying fairly steady,” Dean said. “I kill, it’s happy for a few days, and then I want to kill again.”
Dean hung up the phone and stared at it for a moment. He sighed, wishing he could have had longer to talk to his brother but knowing they couldn’t risk John finding out about their conversations. He slid his phone into his pocket and wandered back out into the main living area, spotting Bobby still over on the computer.
“I was being sarcastic,” Dean said. “I always used headphones when I wanted my music loud. That way I wouldn’t disturb my brother when he was studying.”
“Mercifully no,” Castiel said. “They are usually busy in the city. You’re likely to see them around Christmas when they come home.”
“As a matter of fact yes I can,” Dean said. “Because we’re both eternal beings now. We don’t die. So our mating really
“When he’s studying, yeah,” Gabriel said. “I’ve known him to go days locked in his room without eating so he can ace a test.”
He jumped as his phone rang, Sam pulling it toward him and noting the unfamiliar number. He answered it.
Dean left him in the kitchen, heading for his room. He peeled off his work shoes and clothes and got ready for bed. He climbed between the blankets, contemplating reading for a while but deciding against it. He switched off the light and settled into bed. It didn’t take him long to fall asleep.
“Because I worked out a deal with Bobby about fixing Cas’ car,” Dean said. “I want to make him the offer and see what he says.”
“Well I doubt I’ll ever get anything out of Gabriel,” Dean said. “I’ve never seen him so pissed off.”
After a while Castiel returned with two coffees in take-out cups, setting one down in front of Dean. Dean picked it up and sipped it. Straight black. In fact it might even be a double-shot, just the way he liked it. No cream, no sugar. As black as the Impala.
“Kali typically works weekends alone,” Castiel explained. “However when she cannot she will make sure that two people are watching the store.”
Anna shook her head. “My parents lost their jobs after everything happened. There are rumours about them too. My dad has to travel three hours a day just to work. No school will take my mother on anymore, and I can’t find a job.”
Dean couldn’t help but feel lonely. Even at the coffee shop he hadn’t really had much of a chance to talk to Kali. She hadn’t been her usual chatty self for the last week, something seeming to be going on behind the scenes that Dean wasn’t privy to. It made Dean realise just how few friends he had in the town, Dean longing for his brother to be there. With Sam there was always someone to talk to, even when they butted heads at times. Heck, Dean even missed his dad a little.
“It’s surprising how many people want one last coffee before heading home,” Gabriel said. “Me? I just head straight home after work so I can kick off my shoes and relax.”
“That’s more from him being anti-social,” Gabriel said. “I bet if you asked him he couldn’t tell you the last time he went out for dinner.”
“Nah,” Dean said. He didn’t even have to think about it. “I’d probably still apprentice under Uncle Bobby. You’ve got to learn somehow.”
Dean hated fetch missions. At least he found it relatively easy to travel now that Crowley had taught him how to move around. It had taken Dean a week to get used to teleporting. His first few attempts had resulted in him bouncing into walls and landing on his arse. Now he could just pick the place and he was there. He still had issues crashing into walls though, and had once teleported by accident into the ladies toilets. He was getting better though.
“Come on,” Bobby said, pulling away. “Let’s get back to looking at those cars. Found one I want your opinion on.”
Castiel watched him go, listening to the heavy door swing closed and the locks slide back into place. He slumped back against the wall, feeling sick. He knew his brethren were going to die and there was nothing he could do about it. He squeezed his eyes closed as his eyes burned faintly with tears. He just wanted to die. Why couldn’t Dean just let him die?
Castiel’s eyes blinked open, Dean feeling his heart sink as with each blink more blue began to appear. Castiel was coming out of his rut. Castiel looked around, eyes wide. Dean watched as he began to panic, taking in their situation.
Dean groaned, burying himself further into the blankets of his bed. It felt good to be home in the bunker again. It had been a tough hunt, and Dean had the cuts and bruises to show for it. He hated vampires, and he hated ones that knew magic even more. But he and Sam had put them down, limping their way back home once they had cleaned the place out.
A truck passing the motel jerked Dean out of his slumber. He blinked the sleep from his eyes, taking in the light of the room and knowing it was morning. He paused for a moment as he realised he was wrapped around something warm, the memories of the night before coming back to him. He smiled, snuggling deeper against Castiel’s chest and feeling a hand come up to stroke his hair.
“No,” Dean agreed. He traced the lines with his fingers, feeling Castiel’s muscles twitch beneath his touch. “I’m sorry.”
The first rush came and went, Dean keeping up with the orders without too much hassle. He was definitely getting faster at serving now although he still had to concentrate to make sure he was doing the right thing. He was looking at the cheat sheet a lot less now as he picked up on the terminology of the different sizes and strengths.
They ripped the bag off of the other’s head, Castiel raising his eyes to look up. His blue eyes widened as he spotted Dean. He tried to say something but was muffled by the tape over his lips, and he tugged at the chains that bound him but to no avail. Dean grinned, leaning forward and gazing down at him.
“Wait,” Dean said, reaching for his bedside table and opening the drawer. He pulled out a bottle of lube and a condom. “No slick anymore so we’re going to need this.”
She shrugged, grabbing the cloth and wiping down the counter. Dean could see a sadness to her and knew that she was definitely not looking forward to Castiel leaving. Maybe it was just the idea of change that was getting to her. Maybe she just didn’t want to train another replacement. Surely he hadn’t been that bad to train that she was dreading training someone new.
“He’s being taken up to a room now,” the doctor said. “I’ll let you know where he ends up. Then you can see him.”
“He should have still done it for you kids,” Bobby said. “I offered him a job here, you know. Full time, no questions asked.”
“I see.” Crowley sipped from his drink. “Given how badly you were wanting to be mated I thought you would be happier.”
“Yeah, I know.” Dean shrugged it off. “My dad served too. He never spoke about it though. Bad memories I think.”
Dean actually missed not being able to train with Bobby. He had helped out in the shop where he could doing simple tasks that Bobby had already shown him. The other couple of workers had given Dean a hand when he got stuck and were happy to answer any questions. Dean had gotten a look at the 1954 Cadillac and had to admit it was beautiful, but one glance at the engine had been painful. Bobby hadn’t been kidding about it being a mess. Dean didn’t even want to think what had happened to the poor car to cause the engine to go to pieces like that.
“She always needs help, Dean,” Castiel said. “There is always something that she requires. She is never satisfied.”
Dean shook his head, beginning to roll his hips as he moved in Castiel’s lap. The slick made the slide easy. Dean licked his lips again, running his fingers through Castiel’s hair. This wasn’t the way he had imagined their first time going but he wasn’t complaining. He began to ride Castiel in earnest, shifting until Castiel began brushing against the sweet spot inside him.
Looking toward the door Castiel realised that what he had feared was coming to pass. The Mark was still corrupting Dean. What little human he had left was being eaten away and turning Dean not only into a demon but a monster. Castiel actually pitied Crowley. He wondered if the King of Hell actually knew what he was dealing with.
“For the record I’ve done it too,” Dean said. “Done a few drugs over the years. Never got busted though.”
They made it through the initial morning rush without any issues, Dean starting to really get the hang of things. Kali still handled the food, money and speciality drinks though. Again a few of the customers tried to strike up conversation, Dean answering them as best he could without being too distracted. He smiled politely as he worked.
Dean made himself breakfast, dropping into his seat at the table to eat and drink his coffee. He actually considered asking Bobby about them getting a proper coffee machine so he didn’t have to use instant, but he knew that Bobby wouldn’t go for it. He’d probably argue the fact instant was invented for a reason and saved time and money. He wasn’t wrong, but Dean did wish they had better coffee. Maybe he was being spoiled by the coffee shop.
“Why are you so intent on mating with him?” Crowley asked, going back to his hex bags. “He’s a liability.”
Eventually the subordinates left one-by-one, having given their reports and been dismissed. When the last one left Crowley slid out of his chair, his eyes on Dean.
Rolling out of bed Dean glanced at himself in the mirror. It was a new mirror as he had smashed his old one two days ago out of frustration. He blinked, his eyes flicking to black. He couldn’t get Sam’s words out of his mind. He knew that in many ways both Castiel and Sam were right – Dean would never have allowed himself to become this. But at the same time Dean was the one who had chosen to take the Mark of Cain. This was all on him.
Dean stopped and looked at him, then over at the diner and saw that it was rather full of couples. “Apparently so.”
Bobby had him change a driving belt on Friday afternoon. Dean was scared about doing it on the customer’s car, but Bobby was with him every step of the way. When Dean was finished Bobby had given him a slap on the back.
“Look, I don’t know if what you’re saying is true or not,” Dean said. “But I know what it would mean if I did help you and I can’t do that.”
The door to the cell opened, Castiel glancing up and seeing Sam stepping into the room. Castiel noticed that Sam had shaved and looked a lot more alert than he had before. Clearly he had managed to get some sleep while he was away. He was also wearing a fresh outfit, and his hair was still slightly damp from a shower.
Castiel was fading faster than he had thought he would. He could feel his grace dwindling the longer he was in Hell. The darkness of the place was eating away at his light. He was tired, leaning heavily back against the wall with only his arms being pinned holding him upright. He had started to doze, something that was altogether too human for an angel. He kept trying to shift around to keep the blood moving through his legs, but it was hard with the way he was pinned against the wall.
Dean was really starting to miss Bobby after the next week passed. He barely saw the man, with Bobby spending all of his time in the shop working on the Cadillac. Bobby came back up to the flat late, often after Dean had gone to bed. Bobby had rejected Dean’s offer to help, although he had given him a list of parts to find in the yard at one point. That was the extent that he’d let Dean help him.
Gabriel and Kali had celebrated their tenth anniversary, Gabriel showing up with a chocolate rose and a red velvet cupcake for his girl. Kali had pulled out a lemon meringue pie she’d had made at Benny’s, Dean’s mouth watering when he saw it. Dean was starting to wonder why Kali and Gabriel weren’t married yet given how perfect for each other and in love they seemed to be. It just seemed strange to him that they weren’t.
“Guess you two are compatible,” Gabriel said. “Anyway, I better open up and let Mr Usually Late in. He looks almost frozen.”
They kissed for a long while, hands slipping over naked skin. Dean explored every inch of Castiel, mapping out the new territory of his mate. There was no rush, Castiel slowly grinding his hips against Dean’s and dragging their growing erections together. Dean groaned into his mouth, rolling his hips to increase the friction.
“That’s mighty honourable of you, boy,” Bobby said. “But I think your brother would rather you look after yourself first.”
“So I hear you’re running on borrowed angel juice,” Dean said, stalking around to Castiel’s front. He knelt down beside him, catching Castiel by the hair and pulling him up. “How’s that working out for you?”
“The diner on the corner of Main and Tenth?” Bobby asked. “Been there a few of times. Good for a casual night out.”
“We could clean up Heaven and Hell,” Dean said. “Find a way of opening the gates of Heaven again so all the angels can go home. Slam shut the gates of Hell and keep all the demons under wraps. We could be amazing.”
“You have learned so many of the speciality drinks quickly,” Castiel said. “I imagine you have learned your skills at the workshop equally as fast.”
“He would have massacred thousands,” Castiel said. “The Mark wanted him to kill. He had begun to kill indiscriminately although his main target appeared to be alphas.”
Kali nodded. “He’s been in business about as long as Gabriel. He and his wife Andrea own the place together although she’s more hands off than he is.”
He reached Castiel’s cell without being stopped, most demons seeming to give him a wide berth. No doubt they could sense his mood and didn’t want to interrupt him. Crowley unlocked the door and stepped inside, casting his gaze around the room. He spotted Castiel leaning against the wall, a curious look on his face as he looked toward Crowley.
“Yeah?” Dean said. That surprised him. He’d half expected this Chuck to keep that sort of thing from his kids.
“I think Cas here has the highest body count out of all of us,” Dean said. “And exactly how are you going to repent for that. The angels should want you dead.”
Bobby sighed heavily, rubbing a hand over his face. “Is this what you’re going to do every time I’m away for a while?”
“But he didn’t ask to be robbed,” Dean said. “And he was pretty chill about it. He didn’t look like he was freaking out.”
“They did,” Dean said. “They were only looking for someone part time. Apparently one of their servers has gone to College part time and had to cut back on their hours so it opened up a position.”
“I keep forgetting,” Castiel said. He pulled out his wallet and slid his portion of the meal onto the table with a tip. “I’ll see you on Wednesday.”
“If the ends justify the means,” Crowley said. “We’ve reached a dead end in getting the grace. We need Metatron.”
At the coffee shop Dean didn’t need to be told what to do most of the time, Kali leaving him to his own devices. She had started to teach him how to take inventory so that he knew what to do if he ever spotted they were getting low on anything. She had also let him oversee the delivery of food on one occasion although she had still signed the paperwork.
Crowley let out a long breath, Castiel almost able to see the cogs turning in his mind. Abruptly Crowley stood, smoothing down his shirt and dusting off his pants. “You realise I’m going to inform Dean of the situation.”
“I wasn’t going to comment on it,” Castiel added. “But you do look exhausted. I insist that you try and sleep.”
Sam chased the memories of Dean’s body lying in state in his room from his mind. He didn’t need to think about that now. He got what Castiel was saying about being in pain. There was no pain stronger than that that Sam had felt when he had thought he’d lost his brother forever. When he had carried his lifeless body back to the bunker and into his room. He could get why Dean wouldn’t want to experience that.
“But now he’s had a taste of the power he doesn’t want to give it up,” Crowley said. “You know what they say about power.”
“When it rains we usually have at least one person slip,” Kali said. “Usually after they’ve picked up their drink too.”
It had been two weeks now since Sam had talked to Castiel last and Sam was more than a little worried. Castiel had told him that he had a lead on Dean and was going to check it out, and to not follow him should anything happen. It had taken a while for Sam to track down Castiel’s last location, as someone had seemed to be leading him in circles.
“Will do,” Dean said as he took the envelope from Crowley’s fingers. “I’ll see you when I get back.”
“I don’t think he does,” Dean said, sliding into his seat at the table and watching as Bobby sat across from him. “I get the impression there’s a bit of tension between him and his dad.”
“None,” she said. “It’s a very profitable coffee shop. We actually put a Starbucks out of business.”
“You were always walking down a dangerous road with him, Crowley,” Castiel said. “He wishes you dead.”
“Although something tells me you keep most of yours bottled up,” Kali said as she switched on the machines.
“If we simply destroy the Nephilim the angel and host may attempt to create another,” Hannah said. “They must be dealt with.”
He paused outside the door to Dean’s room and knocked. There was no response even though Crowley could sense that Dean was on the other side of the door. Given that he was the King and this was his domain Crowley threw caution to the wind and pushed the door open. When nothing charged at him he took a step inside.
“I’ve been expecting the angels to contact you,” Crowley said. “I take it from your silence that they have not.”
They ordered their coffee, Dean skipping the cake this time and making sure his coffee was a takeaway. Anna didn’t seem to notice though, ordering the same as she had last week. Dean dropped heavily into his seat and watched her as she settled in. She looked relaxed and comfortable around him.
“Nearly all of our angels are accounted for,” Hannah said. “We have had trouble contacting a few who refuse to return to Heaven. It is most likely one of them.”
“Only on Thursdays,” Gabriel corrected her. “And only because Cassie has a heart attack when I get them near his shirts.”
Dean did just that, moving behind the counter and waiting for the first straggle of customers. It always amused him how blurry eyed the first group always were. Dean could understand it – he was never much of a morning person himself. That was probably the one downside to the job – how early he had to be out of bed. Bobby said it was character building.
“Don’t be a brat,” she told him. “They have it just as bad next door, and they have to make the candy.”
“I intend to graduate with honours,” Castiel said. “And then complete my Masters and then a Doctorate.”
He looked up as he heard footsteps, spotting Kali and Gabriel walking down the sidewalk. They were huddled close, their arms linked as they talked. Dean was relieved to see them smiling. He had seen a frown on their face so often recently he had almost forgotten what they looked like when they were smiling. They looked up at him as they approached, Gabriel looking past him to the sweet shop worker and narrowing his eyes.
They returned to eating, finishing their meal. As they washed up Bobby began talking about what work he’d done during the day, Dean asking questions. It was an impromptu lesson and Bobby was more than happy to give it. Dean wanted to learn and was going to take every opportunity he could get. By the time they were done he had a little more knowledge that he knew he would have to put into practice.
“I am,” Dean said. “Not exactly by choice though. My dad barely has a cent to his name and wouldn’t have offered to help anyway.”
“I told you I was,” Dean said, easing his jacket off his shoulders and hanging it on the hook by the door. “They didn’t touch me.”
Bobby was all over Dean when he walked in the door. He grabbed him by the shoulders, looking him over before Dean could even take off his shoes and jacket. Dean sighed, trying to ease Bobby to back off.
“I have an assignment to do tomorrow,” Castiel said. “It’s not a major assignment but I would like to complete it as soon as possible.”
“Mm-hm,” Dean gave him a grin as he stood, picking up his dirty dishes and carrying them to the sink to begin washing up. “I’m sure you do.”
He absently pressed a hand against his abdomen. Crowley had warned him. The King was going to be pissed when he found out. Dean knew that Castiel was already mad. He could still sense it through their bond. The most common emotion he could feel though was worry.
“Gabriel is useless when it comes to cars,” Kali said. “I’m surprised he knows how to fill one with gas.”
Castiel frowned and did as he was told. Dean bit his lip as Castiel got closer to the spot but was still just missing it.
Pulling his other hand free Dean picked up the bottle again, slicking up his own so far neglected cock. Castiel widened his legs but Dean ignored them, instead crawling up the bed to lay beside Castiel. He could see the confusion on Castiel’s face, Dean holding out a hand to him.
“Huh,” Dean frowned. He hadn’t expected someone from such a well of family to serve in the military. They usually found excuses to get out of it. “Did he volunteer?”
He stepped back, Sam frowning as he saw tears shimmering in Dean’s eyes as he looked over at Castiel.
“So maybe everything is fine,” Dean said. “They don’t need you to watch them. Maybe start looking out for yourself instead.”
“No one knows,” Benny said. “But you don’t want to be seen with her. That’s the fastest way to make yourself an outsider around here.”
When he was free Castiel didn’t let him move far away, hovering around him on guard for any other alphas. His eyes would be fixated on the door as if he expected someone to come in and challenge him. Dean knew that no one was coming so he would drape himself over Castiel, pressing soft kisses over him. He had managed to convince Castiel to kiss him back a few times, the angel practically devouring him.
The last one caught his eye, Dean picking it up and looking at it in the dull light. It was a love heart, but he was more interested in the initials carved into it. His and Castiel’s. He bit back his grin, then glanced at the bed and realised that Castiel was watching him through half lidded eyes.
“Morning,” Dean answered. He turned his head to look up at Castiel, finding the angel looking down at him with soft eyes. “Did you sleep?”
“Yeah,” Bobby said. “Problem is the money and space would have been too tight. Maybe once you get settled in a bit you might be able to afford a place of your own. Then you can try and convince your dad to let your brother stay.”
He lingered around outside people watching. There weren’t that many people up and around this early in the morning, Dean taking in the few that were. Most of them seemed to be workers for the neighbouring stores, including a couple that worked in the bakery a few doors down. Dean could already smell the bread so knew that had been up really early to start baking the day’s stock.
“The doctor just swung by,” Sam said. “He says you should be right to go home in the morning. He also said something about you wanting to go back on suppressants?”
“Okay,” Dean said, pulling a chair over from the table and settling in beside Bobby. “Show me what you’ve got.”
She let go of his hand and walked back to the sandpit. She raised her hand to wave to him, a smile on her face as the runes in the sand began to glow. Castiel shielded his eyes as she disappeared and re-entered Heaven. He sighed, turning and making his way back toward his car. It was time to make his way back to the bunker.
“I told you – he wanted to go independent,” Gabriel said. “He pays for everything out of his own pocket.”
“Yeah, he is,” Dean said. “From what I gather he lives on ramen and forgets to eat when he’s studying.”
“Yeah,” Dean said. “They’d get into screaming matches over everything. Dad would leave and Mom would be sad. Longest he was away was two weeks. Then they’d forgive each other and go back to playing happy family until the next big fight.”
“Exactomundo.” Dean grinned. “You’re not going anywhere. You haven’t got the grace to escape anyway.”
Bobby kept Dean in the shop for the next two days, having him do simple tasks like checking the oil and brake fluid. He made a complete oil change on a car with Bobby’s supervision, without spilling too much of it. Bobby had him run a full check of an engine for wear and tear and take notes while he did it, with Bobby going over the engine to see if Dean missed anything. He managed to find most of the issues with only a couple of missed points.
There was a moment’s pause, Sam hearing what sounded like a conversation in the background. He frowned and wondered who Crowley was talking to. There was a fumbling of the phone, Sam ready to ask what was going on.
“You’re an alpha, I’m an omega, and we’re truemates,” Dean reminded him. “Mating is perfectly natural.”
“Of course I mean torture,” Dean said. “Why would it matter to you anyway? After what he did to you?”
“Pleased to hear it.” Crowley walked over to the side, picking up a bottle and pouring out two tumblers of whiskey. “There’s nothing that needs your attention immediately. Unless, of course, you want to pick a few more names off your list.”
“I get to decide that,” Dean said. He caught Castiel by the jaw, leaning in to press a soft kiss on the side of his face. “You have your uses.”
“Well done.” Crowley pushed himself up out of his seat, coming to stand before Dean. “So now we know you can handle a vampire nest. What challenge do you feel like next?”
“Maybe next time run your choices by me first,” Bobby said. “Hell, even ask Benny. Or maybe Kali since she sounds like she has a good head on her shoulders.”
“Correct,” Castiel said. “It has quite a large yard so we had plenty of space. There were still issues, however. For example Lucifer was rather fond of playing loud music at all hours of the day and night.”
Next to that was one shaped like a moose and he knew that was Sam. He smiled at that. Next was an angel, carved out of a white stone and kneeling with its wings spread out behind it. Castiel. That had to be Castiel. Dean set it down, looking over the various different shapes and designs. There was even one shaped like a car and he knew that had to be the Impala.
