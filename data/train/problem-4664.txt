The man Dean had watched, yearned for before this all went to hell, here to claim him, now that it was all done, ruined.It felt less like a mercy and more a sort of cruel joke meant to torment him further.
Gabe lifted the rest of the harness and slipped it over his head. It was a fairly straight forward process to do up the straps, Dean’s arms quickly crossed and immobilized against his own chest.
Dean dressed quickly and they made their way out into the kitchen. Cas grabbed one of the feeding bags for Dean from the fridge, he’d brought a dozen or so from the hospital yesterday but would need to remember to get more. His feeding schedule for Dean was six bags a day and it really was just easier to use the prepackaged ones.
Dean didn't want to fight the machine, he knew it was helping him. Hell, he'd sat with Cas as he’d programmed the damn thing. They'd talked through the different functions, fittings, speeds, depths and durations, and Cas had explained why he needed to vary the angle, the speed, the way his different muscle groups would be impacted by different positions. Cas had patiently explained each and every cycle that his body would be enduring. He'd agreed to this, helped Cas plan it all out, and yet, even knowing what, how and why; actually experiencing it was a very different thing.
Cas heads into his clinical rooms to collect the scentless oil he uses in clinical massage and a couple of instant ice packs.
He felt his muscles relaxing down comfortable and secure on the knot. The pain of it fading back into a lazy sort of ease. He feels himself relax, finally, and can't help moaning a little around the fullness in his mouth. It feels so good, so right to be full again.
“Benny picked up on it first. He’s got his own traumatic background and he wasn’t raised in The Society either, so he saw through the deflective humour and false confidence a bit quicker than the rest of us. Benny’s been Dean’s carer right from the start, so he got to spend a lot of time getting to know him.
He reached for the pills and hastily swallowed them down, choking a bit on the water but managing to get them to stay down.
“Said he didn’t need babysitting. That he was fine without it. But it worked you know. Dean got so much better, they made sure he was taking his meds, ate right, looked after himself, even got him started on the sculpture and art track. There was a woman there who took him to galleries and art shows, worked with him on developing his own style. And when he was ready they got him into classes at the local college, just a couple at first then more as he grew more confident. He did so well with it all, with people who actually knew how to look after him.”
The rest of the weekend had gone so wonderfully smoothly that Dean felt like he should have expected it all to come crashing down come Monday. He just didn’t expect it to crush him quite so completely.
It’s the first time they have asked him to be the Assist with a Heat and he couldn’t help but feel the heavy weight of that trust. Heats are so hard for Dean and it’s the first time that Sam hasn’t been able to make it, he’s stuck in the middle of a significant trial and couldn’t abandon his client, but he felt terrible. In his typical foolhardy style Dean had assured him that the progress he’d made with Gabe recently would be sufficient to get him through it without him, promised Sam that he would be fine.
And for that alone Dean would have loved him, forget the gentleness buried deep in his eyes, forget the way he checked over and over that Dean was ok, forget that literally every breath Dean took, every beat of his heart was watched over by him, forget the small and immediate kindnesses he showered over him every single day. It was enough that he knew, with absolute certainty that Dean was special and he made sure Dean knew it too.
It took a while, almost long enough to have Gabe reaching back for the sedative, but eventually, Dean’s breathing evened out again. His body relaxing back into a feverish sleep.
But already he can feel his limbs loosening, his breath coming in slower and more relaxed, even as his mind desperately battles to stay lucid.
“Yes, mostly," Castiel looked down at his phone, his hands trembling slightly, "Dean rang a few minutes ago, he’s having a bath and trying to keep calm. He thinks he’s about six hours in so we have a while yet before we need to get started.”
The job of a Dynamic Therapist isn’t just to work with the patient, often it’s even more important to work with the family members. Intensive Dynamic Therapy intervention of the type Castiel specialises in requires family members to both participate in the treatment directly, but also to engage with the therapist for themselves. Usually, they have their own issues and concerns that need addressing, as well as help learning the skills and techniques necessary to support their loved one. DDS is a terrible illness, but with the family on board, it can be cured.
Gabe climbed onto the bed and straddled Castiel’s legs, sliping gently behind Dean, shifting in close as possible to encircle him. He quickly slipped the mask over Dean's face, pulling the straps tight and activating the Aphroxil gas in one smooth motion.
It feels amazing, his muscles begin to relax, the tension falling away as Cas lays another and another, the weight an added relief. He didn’t realize just how much he was fighting the restraints till he stops, lets go, soaks in the luxurious warmth.
“I know, mate,” Benny chuckled sympathetically, “since we own the company, the House gets the newest model before they're commercially available. Just push it here and then press the green button for the list of names.”
Before long Castiel had settled his hands in the dip of Deans lower back and begun working the muscles there with expert precision. Dean couldn't hold back a moan of absolute pleasure, the burning ache he’d developed throughout the day slipping away under Castiel’s more than capable hands.
Mostly, it was hard for Castiel not to feel outraged on Dean’s behalf. He was disturbed by the sheer inadequacy of his upbringing and the trauma he must have experienced. A pure submissive child, abandoned time and time again, building a desperate sense of self amid constant rejection and likely abuse. That the very people who should have cared for him, failed to notice that he wasn’t behaving like everyone else, failed to care that he couldn’t interact with the world like everyone else did, failed to protect a child from an illness that he had no capacity to manage on his own, it was heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable.
And Dean is putting all of Cas’s training to work, clenching and releasing his muscles just right, able to focus he realises on Cas’s need instead of his own. The tide is in but just enough to let him wade through it and back to shore before the waves crash, back to where he can make Cas his every thought, Can give himself completely to this.
It took a bit more effort not to comment further, but it was important to get a full picture of the situation before passing judgement. There may be factors of which Benny was unaware, he’d need to speak to Dr Harris when she returned tomorrow morning.
“I’ll certainly try my best,” Castiel was always careful not to make any promises, especially regarding patients as sick as Dean, but he too hoped to be successful. This exact scenario is what he’d spent his whole life training for, he’d be damned if he was going to fail.
“Dean.” Cas tried to keep the frustration out of his voice, Dean’s blindness when it came to his father was an old pain he had so far been unable to shift, “He abused you,”
“God, it’s such a mess! I don’t even know where to start. How do you break down someone whole life into episodes of trauma? It’s just...” he falls quiet for a moment thinking, clearly not ready to talk about this, Cas doubts he’ll ever truly be ready, but Sam loves his brother enough to try.
He works thoroughly through the initial exam. Having Dean breath in and out for him a couple of times before allowing Sam a listen to his heartbeat, knowing well the reassurance that comes from hearing it himself. His heart and blood pressure is checked. And then all the small things significant and necessary in Cas’s estimation at least, blood drawn, reflexes checked.
they said, but he still said no. He hadn’t chosen to become a Dynamic Therapist for the money. He’d emailed them a contact list of other Dynamic Therapists that he trusted, people who were the best in the industry.
“It’s okay, take it easy. I’m going to get you off, don’t worry,”  He turns his head to whisper in Dean's ear as he slowly works the plastic in his hand, “I’ve got you.”
Dean bucked up again, but got no traction at all, just managed to impale himself further as his bare feet slid against the soft silk sheets.
“Benny!” she called enthusiastically, “This is Dr Novak, but he goes by Cas. He’s the Dynamic Therapist that’s going to cure Dean!” Cas bit his tongue, not wanting to stifle her enthusiasm, he was having to do that a lot here.
“You did the right thing by him,” Cas can at least offer this this little bit of consolation, “The minute you could you got him out and you got him the help he needed. No brother could ask for more than that.” He doubts it’ll make much of a difference, but he truly did believe it. Sam did the best he could in a shitty situation.
“That’s yours,” She gestured through a door that she had opened. It was indeed an office, much like any other, with a desk, a computer monitor, a couple of chairs, a table and some filing cabinets. This he opened and placed Dean’s file inside before locking it and pocketing the key.
"Just a moment," Cas reached across and took Dean's hand in his and kissed it. "I know it won't be me inside of you, but I'm right here with you. I promise, I'll be right here until it's over."
“Too young. You know he didn’t have a choice right? Illegal, toxic suppressants Dad got off some shady dealers that he’d force Dean to take, even though it made him sick. He started Dean on them before he’d even had his first heat. Dad had to know was hurting him! What did he think it would do? Fix him?” Sam practically screams down the line, seething with old anger, old resentment for things he can’t change.
Catching Cas’ eyes, Gabe held up the harness and received an exhausted nod in return. He also pulled out the blindfold, pheromone mask, earplugs and a knotting dildo.
Gabe could help but ache for him, unable to help when Dean needed him most, and thankful for himself, saved this fate by a mere chance of genetics.
Once done, Cas was just as quick to act, pulling his thumbs back out and locking his hands around Dean's chin and jaw. Gabe pressed his palm over Dean's lips, holding his mouth firmly shut.
“Look at me.” Cas commands, “We’re doing this together. It wasn’t fair what happened, what he did to you. But you are strong enough. Stronger than you know. And the only thing I want you to ask yourself is this; Do you want to do this? Do you want me to know? If you do then we will get through this, that’s all that matters. ” He has both their hands clasped now, their knees touching.
He was so relieved when he arrived and saw that it was only a panic attack which hadn't triggered any of the OSS syndrome warning signs. Dean was extremely high-risk and back when he was in the care of the OSP he had previously endured several treatment rounds on the medication Senstinax to prevent him from developing the devastating disorder. Cas knew that eventually, additional preventative treatments would need to be administered, but Dean had responded so negatively to them in the past that Cas knew he just wasn't ready.
“Shh..” he soothes as his fingers find the lock, slipping the key in place and turning it immediately. Then he eases apart the plastic, careful not to catch or pinch the skin before dumping the whole thing on the floor by the bath.
Dean barred his teeth at him, clearly signalling his displeasure at that progression but didn't fight it, knowing it was futile. It hurt, the knot pushed against all the sore, overworked places inside him. He sobbed, wet tears leaking down already sweat soaked skin. And yet he felt such relief too, his body desperately wanted this, craved it.
“It’s ok I knew him before.” he raises his hands and backs away slightly, “Shit! No...I probably shouldn’t be talking to him. I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry!” He tries to address Dean again, but Charlie is in front of him, basically blocking Dean from being seen. Her presence the only thing preventing him from breaking down entirely.
The whispered ‘thank you’ was almost inaudible but enough to reassure Castiel that Dean would be ok. He became non-verbal when he was genuinely not coping, Castiel had stopped in time.
He starts at the bottom, levering up the base section of the examination table and locking it into place before unstrapping Dean's legs and laying them flat on the table. He carefully pulls the blanket over them, knowing how Dean appreciates it before continuing up the undo thigh, hips, chest and forehead. He ends with the arm and wrist restraints, pulling Dean’s hand up for a light kiss on the knuckles before tucking it back under the blankets.
Benny nodded, accepting Castiel's words at face value, "Unfortunately, after today, it's even more necessary."
“Thanks,” he sounded genuinely touched, if a little shy at the compliment, “Can I help you with this?” He said gesturing to the bags Sam had brought in.
“Ok breathe out gently. Pause. Now in, feel it to your stomach. Relax.” He’s pressing there slightly, “Good. You’re doing so good. Out again. Pause. Slow yourself down. Feel your body. That’s really good. Slowly, gently, relax. That’s it. Now again…” On and on he spoke, repeating until Dean was following him properly. His world narrowing back on Cas’s voice.
“I can’t, I’m so sorry.” Cas’s voice was rough, hurting, “You’re too far gone. If I touch you now, I’ll go into rut too soon.”
Sometimes, he knows, it’s only been Cas and Sam, his therapist, the centre and all the other people invested in him surviving that have kept him sane, kept him alive. He knows, he’s broken. But hopes. In some distant, fantasy way that maybe one day he might catch a glimpse of what they tell him they see clearly. For now, he imagines it in his art, from once depicting the tormented things he saw when he looked inside, he now creates what he dreams they see in him, what beauty he wishes he too saw deep inside.
He doesn’t mind his brother sitting in, actually, it was the only way he’d managed to get through the OSP physicals in the beginning. But right now, he just wants it over and done with, not sitting around and waiting for Sam to be ready.
Against the advice of his therapists and the doctors, Castiel eventually attempted to take Nick down anyway, he knew that he just had to try. Of course, they had brought in other Pure Dominants, attempted that route many times already. Half a dozen different Pure Dominants had flown in from all over the country and attempted to get him to go down. But not even they were able to help him. The medications had stopped working entirely and the nurses had begun to avoid meeting Castiel’s eyes when they spoke about him.
“Nah, you know him. He doesn’t get angry. Just gets all disappointed and starts plotting ways to 'fix it'.”
Gabe drifted in and out of sleep, never quite settling, but managing a couple of hours at least. He had no idea of the time when he heard rather than saw Cas climb out of bed and make his way to the bathroom, the room was still completely dark save for the low glow of the medical monitors mounted about the room.
Dean tucks himself tighter, not away, just inward, letting the sensation flow over him and out. It’s not like it was leading anywhere anyway so he releases it. Enjoying it for what it is and not what it isn’t.
“Just a few more minutes,” Cas said as he meticulously toweled Dean dry, avoiding putting too much pressure on his stomach.
“Hello?” Sam’s voice sounds tired and a little tense. Cas supposed that he’d probably just come home from work, was ready to crack up open a beer and de-stress from the day.
The rest of the space is taken up with the heat or medical equipment of various shapes and dimensions. He understood why Dean never came in here outside of his Heats, it’s really quite daunting looking at all this stuff, needed or not.
But Dean wasn’t listening, throwing his bodyweight against Gabe in an effort to dislodge him and get the mask off. This was terrifying for him, the scent of what he mistook as a rival alpha overwhelming his mind, his will. A body tucked behind him, an alpha he didn't recognise. But Gabe held on tight, one hand around Dean’s torso and the other holding the mask tight against his face, upping the flow of gas even more.
His mind drifts back to the day he called Cas, knowing full well just what he'd been asking him to take on.
“How old was he when he started taking them?” his doctor voice calming, directing Sam back to rationality. Cas has a pen out and is correcting the notes in the file, the old habit long ingrained from his job, it’s easier if he rationalizes it as just another patient, just another messed up body to fix. His eyes flicking every few seconds to the screen on his tablet showing Dean’s steady, reassuring heartbeat.
“Can you stomach a proper meal?” Gabe asked Dean, hoping to turn the conversation away to more comfortable topics.
Dean just wants to sink through the table and curl up on the floor in his pile of blankets, make a nest in the warmth, pull Cas down with him and together hide out for the rest of the afternoon.
“Yeah,” he murmurs, meaning it, the drugs thick in his blood but he'd answered truthfully. It was time he realized to tell Cas everything, all the shameful and painful truths he wanted to hide forever. He owed Cas that much.
Instead, he pulled out a notepad and flipped to a blank page, “I’ll be happy to discuss the medical aspects with Benny and Dean’s doctors, but I like to build a basic understanding of a patient’s background from their family and other people close to them. I’d like to interview all the key people in Dean’s life, everyone he is closest to.”
“Fuck!” he wants to move away but as always the straps hold tight. “Uhhh!” he had been so hard that the ice felt like a knife, slicing away the skin, or a burn, cold as dry ice.
Dean led him to his office in the back and shut the door behind them. He pulled the blinds as well, unable to not be self conscious. There was an ensuite bathroom off to one side and Gabe followed him in there.
Gabe first leveraged his own legs against Dean’s, pressing them together before pulling the weighted blanket over both of them and tucking it tight around their legs. Then he reached around and moved Dean’s arms more securely under his own armpits and eased his head back to rest against his shoulder before he pulled him close, both arms around Dean’s chest, holding him steady and firmly against him.
The minute he is released Dean lunges towards Cas, but Gabe is quicker, manhandling his wrists up and fastening the cuffs to the ceiling-mounted cables fitted for just this purpose.
“Yeah, they were... god they saved us both. They’d been trying to find Dean for a long time, apparently he had been flagged multiple times on their system as a possible abuse case, guess his teachers were more observant than we thought.”
It was huge, with several sofas, a giant TV, beanbags, even a dining table over in one corner, but also an entire wall of locked cabinets which he presumed were filled with medical and dynamic equipment. One entire corner of the room was taken up with an examination table with an IV stand resting next to it.
“This should help with the pressure and the need a bit. I’m going to give you a prostate massage. We’ve done this once before, when you first came to me. Do you remember?”
Dean nods, comprehension finally reaching his eyes. He remembers picking it out together from that website and when it arrived opening it together. He also remembers Cas pulling it apart and showing him how it locked together. He remembers the slight exhilaration he felt thinking about Cas owning him in that way, taking over control in that fundamental way. Even now he has to bite back a moan of arousal, his heart beating a little faster at the thought.
Cas doesn’t comment as he encircles Dean in his arms, his chest pressing comfortingly against his back. The warmth from the shower he obviously just took still radiating from his skin.
"First vaginal orgasm since," Cas looks over at the clock, "2pm. He'll need more, I'm going to keep going for another three at least before we give him a break."
Dean wants to scream, but all that slips out are panting moans, he wants so badly to touch himself, can’t, wants to anyway. I’ve been good, he wants to beg, please just let me come. But Cas is merciless, drawing it out, further and further, deepening the pleasure till it’s building down, deeper inside him. Like during the heat. Familiar yet so foreign still.
He’s been in to check on them multiple times, making sure they’re hydrated and healthy. It’s been 12 hours since Cas took Dean into the Heat room and 20 since his Heat first began. They both need to sleep, at least for a little while.
He nodded his approval, pleased. If possible Dean knew he was to wait for Castiel before he went at night, it wasn’t always possible but mostly they succeeded.
Dean was special to them, they explained plainly, he had a natural generosity but was hopeless at self care, headstrong needlessly at times and struggled to find himself amongst the other Omegas. He’d won them all over with his natural charm and kind nature but frustrated them in their attempts to help him. Traditional discipline rarely worked with him and had actually backfired at times, sometimes severely with him reacting to physical discipline as traumatic instead of steadying as a normal Omega would. They needed someone with a different tactic, someone who could work Dean down, let him feel the control and guidance needed without using traditional methods.
“Seventeen? We think so anyway. The foster records are a total mess,” Sam looked furious. He reached down into a drawer under his desk and dragged out a huge chaotic binder, hundreds of documents, some of them obviously decades old. “It’s completely unacceptable! This lists six different birth dates! Not one record of a visit to a doctor or a dentist in all that time.” He looks despairingly down at the pages, “How could they not even bother to get him vaccinated? We had to do them all here, on the first day he arrived.”
Dean can’t nod, even though he tries unconsciously before realizing and uttering a broken “Yeah, I’ll try”
Castiel was quite familiar with the CRP Technique, he’d often used it himself with dysregulated or overstimulated submissives. The Compression-Restraint-Pressure Technique was designed to calm a submissive’s overactive amygdala and hypothalamus by reengaging their parasympathetic nervous system. It used a combination of deep pressure massage, joint compressions, targeted pressure restraints and whole-body pressure stimulation using equipment such as weighted blankets, compression vests or like they’d used, a CRP frame.
Dean visibly stiffened and bit back a growl but he did comply, crawling down the length of the bed from the base, forcing Cas to skirt backwards lest they collide.
“He got down to his last bottle. I came home to him sitting at the kitchen table with it, pulling long draws from the bottle and snarling at me. He told me that it should have been me, not her that died.” Dean’s voice is monotone, the only way he’s able to speak is to distance himself, Cas stays silent, letting him continue.
Cas eased himself down beside him, gently running a soothing hand up his spine, pushing him back down to the mattress when he attempted to raise himself.
“Yes, I read the report in the file.” Cas flips through and pulls it out, turning to the social worker’s statement.
“I’ll always give you what I promise, I’d give you anything.” he says, looking directly into Dean’s eyes like a challenge, before he shifts, pushing Dean backwards and easing him onto the soft bed. Then he crawls between Dean’s legs, leveraging his back up against the pillows and parting his legs gently, kissing his way down from the knee till he reaches the cage, blessedly stopping before touching the plastic. Dean knows that even with the release earlier that would still be too much.
For me it meant nothing, whether I kept my job or not, nothing, I didn’t care. I just wanted to disappear. Figured that getting handed over like a broken toy to some strange alpha had been inevitable from the start, might as well accept it. Dad was right again.”
"Gabriel will have to do the 11am feed again since I’ll be in surgery all morning, but, I’ll come by and check on you though in the afternoon. Say two?”
“Dr Harris was called away earlier today for an emergency medical consultation at our New York City Branch House, but she hopes to be back early tomorrow morning. She said to pass on her greetings and welcome to the House. In the meantime, she encouraged you to speak to Benny, Dean’s primary care-nurse. She said that she will schedule a time to meet with you as soon as she is back and that she looks forward to working together in the future” Charlie’s voice had turned bored and bland, he got the impression that Charlie was less than impressed with the good doctor.
Dean has his eyes shut, leaning against the window, a grave weariness overcoming him. He’s exhausted, but can’t actually fall asleep. He can hear their quiet exchange though, spoken with the assumption that he was unconscious.
“Cas? It’s Charlie. Dean’s having a panic attack. What do I do?” Dean can’t hear the reply but Cas must be talking her through it.
Dean huffs out a pleased laugh, he hadn't done anything! But can't help smiling around the tube in his mouth into the crook of Castiel's neck, the compliment sending electric signals singing through his mind and body.
He can’t understand how when Castiel looks at him, he sees beauty. When Dean looks inside all he sees is the damage. A broken twisted thing. Sharp and cutting. When he dares, it’s like picking up shards of glass or razor wire. It’s agonising to remember, to pick through the past without it cutting him. It’s all knotted up, the good and the bad and every time he thinks he’s untangled something warm from back then, the edges end up being razor-sharp and bloody him further.
They end up chatting about plans for the wedding over the rest of breakfast and well into the morning until finally they really do need to get on with the day. There are things that need to be done, no matter the occasion.
"Okay, I hear you. We'll try the Valium first," Cas sounds relieved, pleased that Dean can talk, even if it's a struggle
After the election at the end of the year, Gabriel intended to take those three seats. Recently, Gabriel had started openly discussing Dean’s illness, praising the devoted care Dean was given by the House and the admirable way everyone was coping. It had served to further increase the sympathy and garner support for Caladh House (and it’s leadership) and Gabriel intended to use their sympathy wisely.
He’d spent almost a year in that centre, recovering his health and learning how to make sure he never got that sick again. He was given intensive Dynamic Therapy, hormone stabilisation medications and taught how to monitor and control his Dominant needs.
Cas has obviously already had a shower (one of his concessions to the weekend was letting Dean sleep in while he got himself ready) and he’d dressed casually as he always did on a Saturday, in soft pants and simple comfortable shirts. He usually had Dean shower himself on Saturdays, his hands will be all over him for the rest of the day anyway, and it’s good practice to have Dean do these basic self care tasks himself once in awhile.
“Yes, and we’ve had some success with that as well. He has a restriction-pressure vest but doesn’t like to wear it much. He whines and complains for the first few minutes, but eventually he does settle down and then falls into a more relaxed state. It's really good for him, but it's hard to get him to agree to wear it.”
“I don’t want you to start today in bad mood, this is meant to be good, for both of us.” he says as he slips his hands gently around Dean’s penis. Just holding it for a moment, letting his fingers wrap around the head and his other hand reaching down to cup Dean's balls. It could almost be described as possessive if not for the gentle way he’s holding him, like something too fragile to be carried, delicate and understated. Dean know’s why he’s being so careful, any more and Dean would be so hard he couldn’t pee if he wanted too.
He lays it carefully over Dean, making sure the weight is evenly distributed before pulling the covers back over both of them.
“It was really short and angry. She only wrote it to tell him not to look for them and to leave them alone. She never wrote again.”
The Interlude (Dean goes through a difficult heat) has been moved to make this story make better sense... you can find the link below ;)
“I’m sorry,” Sam said, pulling himself together before Castiel had the chance to figure out how exactly to explain that he, and possibly everyone else here, was a God. Damn. Idiot.
“So 10, maybe 11 years on them? Consistently?” Cas asks jotting down the answer. He knew it had been a long time, but Dean hadn’t said just how long, the reality horrifying him.
Then the ice pack is gone and the device is back. Cas works as quickly as he can, his hands shaking slightly in urgency to get this done. It fits snuggly around his dick, snow soft and tender to touch, not enough cold to numb it, just to sear the arousal away. Cas is gentle as he eases Dean’s penis down the plastic shaft, a perfect fit. Then the feel of Cas’s fingers pulling his testicles away from his body tentatively while he fits the metal ring around the back of them. The lock snaps shut with an almost inaudible click. Dean shudders, the cold still seeping into his bones.
“Let’s get these out of you,” Gabe slips the dilators out gently and puts them away, giving Dean a moment to adjust to the feeling.
“Um… he doesn’t like his harness and leash. I remember the first day he came here, they’d just driven over from the airport, so John still had him in his harness, leash clipped to his waist. I could tell that Dean was really put off by it, he kept tugging at the chest straps and rubbing his neck, but he had a smile on his face, and he was joking about feeling like a ‘show pony’ the entire time so no one else noticed how uncomfortable he was. I don’t think I saw him draw a complete breath until he got inside, and John took it off.
Gabe ignored it for now, choosing instead to focus on the bed, pulling off the covers and back the sheets. By the time they needed it, Dean would be much too far gone to bother with the covers.
Sam nodded confidently, “You’ll definitely have that. We are committed to him. Not just Dad or me either. In our community children are cherished, we raise them collectively. So, in losing Dean, the whole community lost a child. And everyone saw what Dad went through all those years, saw the toll it took on him. Then when Dean was found, we were all so happy, so hopeful. Did you know that in our culture, someone receiving a Pure designation is considered a blessing on the entire House?”
“I pretended for a while that nothing had happened. I was totally numb to it. Like it had happened to someone else. I went to work, ate a little but never enough, drunk myself to sleep every night. I tried to forget. But it rotted inside me, the knowledge. It was like I could hear his whispering to me all the time. Telling me how worthless I was, how I was only a hole to be filled by alpha cock. The thoughts got into me so bad, sometimes I couldn't breathe.
“Ok, before we do this, I want you to know you can tell me to stop anytime you want. Even if you’re just not feeling it alright?”
“So far so good.” Cas answered with a brittle grin, “Rut hasn’t kicked in yet, thankfully. Mine was never very strong anyway.”
The ice pack was finally removed and Dean had to stifle the urge to peer down at himself, shriveled up and pathetic between his legs. Instead he looked up at Castiel, who meet his eyes lovingly, the pride and what could almost be amazement shimmering in his eyes.
Dean has a nightmare, Castiel deals with it in a typical Dom!cas style. A short piece that didn't quite fit in with the next chapter.
Dean gags, his tongue pressed down by the thick plastic tube fitted between his teeth. Then the rest of the mask is fitted over it, locking into the plastic with an audible clicking sound. Then the straps that fit round and over his head are fastened, claustrophobic and secure.
Cas was there, shushing and wiping away the sweat and tears that ran down his face with a warm, slightly wet cloth. "Hush, it's ok darling. Just relax, breathe along with my breath, let your muscles accept the knot. That's it, good," Cas slid his fingers through Dean's sweat damp hair and gently massaged his scalp.
Dean snorts, sure of the conversation they’ll be having later about proper record keeping and the need for thorough explanations.
Cas lets him sleep. As long as possible. Long past the dawn and into the late morning, unwilling to end what his body must desperately need.
“No,” His voice firm, the strict tone he knew would work on Dean, “You’ve been trying. I know you have but now it’s my turn to take over, like we agreed. I’ll get to look after this till we get back to where you need to be. With you forgetting to eat and pushing yourself too hard, it’s to be expected." He cups his jaw and places a gentle kiss on Dean’s forehead. "I’m not upset, you did so much better this time, you managed almost six months. You just need a little additional help is all.”
Castiel being his usual self, could see right through Dean’s false unwillingness and in response was completely uncompromising. In typical fashion (not that Dean knew him well enough at the time to know) he’d done the inverse. Every time Dean had tried to reject him, he’d turned off the shower and run a bath, turning what could have been just a couple of minutes long task into an hour or more of intimate physical contact. He’d eased himself into the water as well, seating Dean between his legs and wait him out, giving him time to process, to work through his own reluctance. He’d wait, letting the warm water and stillness sooth them both till Dean was ready to continue the cleaning process. He never relented, carefully assertive, but was infinitely patient.
Enough for Cas to slip his hands down to curl them about Dean’s waist and pull him in, it’s enough to let him lean in and kiss him. Gently opening up and guiding his tongue inside Dean’s welcoming mouth possessively. It’s enough to give him the strength to ask.
Cas sighs, “Bathroom, then we’ll have to exhaust him again before he’ll settle. I won’t use more Aphraxil yet. He needs a break"
“Yeah, that would do it.” Sam sighs, “Look Cas. I’m happy to fly up early, I can be on the morning flight out...”
“Go shower,” Gabe gestures to the second showerhead mounted at the other side of the shower stall, “I got this.”
“I don’t think… can you???....” He huffs out, frustrated at once again losing his ability to communicate. The feeling of his alpha around him throwing him quickly back into the heat.
“He’d found a knife in the kitchen, was waving it around crazily slicing anything he could reach. But Mom, she got between them screaming at him but he ran at her, cutting her open. Then Dad got home and he…” Cas knew the telling of this story was painful for Sam, the way he kept it as short as possible, giving over only the most significant of details. “But Dad, apparently he got out his hunting rifle and shot the guy ... square in the chest. It was too late though. For her.” Sam’s voice broke a little then, up until that moment his voice had been flat, like he was recounting something that happened to someone else, but now it was broken, open and raw.
“We’re just going to crash, if that's alright. It’s been a really long day,” Sam brushed a hand over his eyes, the exhaustion obviously getting the better of him.
Cas knows he will be anyway, it’s only two days ago that he was struggling through panic and fear, the effects won’t have worn off so quickly. But, he doesn’t protest, he doubts Dean would get much sleep either way.
Although Dean had been expecting it, the heady rush of emotion hit him hard, he’d thought Sam would wait for tomorrow at least, he hadn’t been expecting it right away. To have it confirmed to unexpectedly, was like a direct hit to the sternum.
He pumped one more time and disconnected the tube. Dean was panting against Cas’ chest but at the same time, his muscles were unlocking nicely, tension flowing away as he settled onto the knot.
The groan he was met with was anguished and low, Dean didn't even try to respond, instead practically throwing himself at Cas. Gabe's firm hold the only thing stalling the desperate movement, pulling him back down.
Dean was strapped in his frame exactly as Castiel had imagined. It was typically configured, with just enough room to allow him to breathe, but not enough room to move. He lay prone on his back within the cage, while straps crossed over from one side to the other across his body, holding him down into the metal frame. It was exquisitely crafted to fit his body exactly, allowing for almost movement, but permitting easy access for medical monitoring devices and the other necessary equipment which Castiel could see attached to Dean at various different points.
“Come on, a shower should help.” he said encouragingly, knowing Dean well enough by now that he didn’t bother argue, Dean will convince himself soon enough and nine o’clock really is late enough. He walked purposefully into the bathroom and started to pull out equipment, letting Dean work himself awake.
“I’m sure you will.” she held his gaze for a moment as if assessing him but didn’t follow up with anything more. Instead, she pushed through another set of doors and into a corridor filled with closely spaced doors, offices, Castiel realised.
Dean's knows that those first days with him he wasn't right, disassociated and emptied of anything but pain and anger.  But somehow it being Cas they chose, the man he felt so entirely drawn to but able to approach began a flicker, a whisper of something, a spark.
As both his parents were neutrals, everyone assumed by that he would be Neutral too. So unfortunately, it was only in his late teens, after months of increasingly debilitating nausea, fevers, migraines, cramps and so many other horrific symptoms. His doctor finally, after having ruled out everything else, ran the DSPD blood test.
“Friday night, after work. We’ll pick up something for dinner on the way so don’t worry about feeding us.”
“That looks painful.” Dean remarks dryly, but feeling a little sheepish, the intimate moment broken by the reminder of the coming cold pack currently defrosting on the instrument tray.
“I…” Dean doesn’t know how to respond, he was used to hiding, to putting on a brave face. Telling people that he was hurting wasn’t something he knew how to do, had ever been allowed to do before. But he knew it was something he wanted now, he wanted to be honest, he wanted to trust that when he needed it people would listen, Cas and Gabe would listen.
“And from me too,” Cas added, “We’re both so grateful. We really didn’t want to have to do this at the centre.”
“I’ve had a chance to read through his medical records. They were extremely helpful and detailed, but I do have a few areas I’d still like to get your perspective on”
But, there was one small benefit of the damn NG tube Dean mused, Cas had to find the time to visit him here. They got to spend at least an hour at lunch together every single day. Dean was nervous but thrilled at the chance to show Castiel his new work. It was to be the centre sculpture in a new fountain being built to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the university and was the first commission Dean had ever done involving water.
Dean had refused to submit to anyone, and he hadn’t even tried to go down into his headspace. He also refused to participate in any training. We figured that with everything that had happened, and his designation so new, he just needed a little more time to adjust, we didn’t want to pressure him. We were, of course, deluding ourselves. By allowing him to avoid submitting, we’d ignored all of our own rules and practices, we allowed him to get so sick. But at that point, we thought that the DDS hormone replacement meds were still working. We thought we had time.”
Of course, the words meant something else entirely now. Now they meant safety and home. Because Castiel had refused to let him shut down, refused to let him hide inside his own mind and let the numbing agony quiet him. Cas had in his unfailing dedication drawn him back out and convinced him to live. Even if he hadn’t always gone quietly, or calmly for that matter.
They'd asked him twice already if he needed the medication again or would accept something to help him drop into subspace, but he'd refused. Though he knew it would turn this needy agony into mindless lust and pleasure. It would make all this so much easier, but it also sent him away from reality, it would turn his Cas in his mind into some faceless Alpha and he didn't want that.
“We’ll keep this simple. 10 sets of 5 second just like normal. I won’t count seconds or anything, just do your best. If you want me out you say so ok? Or lift your hand, like this” he lifts his left hand up and shows Dean his palm.
He dreams of terrifying hands crawling all over him, bodies pressed against him, pressed inside him. He hears his own voice, begging. He dreams of the man, his voice whispering to him of how good he was being. He remembers being pleased, wanting it. Sick with it.
“As I explained when we spoke on the phone, part of my role here will be working with all the people closest to Dean, which will primarily be you and John. To help him recover, you will both need to participate in his treatment directly, but also to engage with me in therapy yourselves.”
The fingers inside him are dipping deeper with every thrust and the hand working his cock again finally moving, finally letting the pressure….the pleasure….
He opened the cupboard labelled restraints and pulled out the first of the many harnesses they would use, this one designed for sleeping. It was quite different from the setup in their bedroom, instead of securing Dean down to the mattress it locked around him tightly, legs and arms held together, tight and safely immobile.
The speculum was cold as Cas eased it in, he’d purposely not warmed it, hoping the slight discomfort might be enough to distract him but instead it just seems to have drawn his focus further inward. He’ll have to change the plan, Cas realizes, give him some form of relief even if psychologically Dean wasn’t ready for the denial to end quite yet, he wasn’t yet where they both wanted to go.
Of course, Castiel would have all the necessary supplies but his own need to be thorough won out every time. He’d visited the hospital supplies room earlier and stocked up on all the extra little things they might need, including a few he hoped they won’t ever have to use.
He set out a small glass and filled it with ice cubes and handed them to Dean to suck on. the ice helped his body accept the fullness in his stomach and soothes the irritation in his throat.
His hand is greeted with equal pleasure from Cas. So often he’d wished they’d had more opportunities to develop their friendship further. He knew that if Sam lived closer or was able to visit more frequently then there was every chance they could become good friends. They already shared a deep respect for eachother built slowly over the years. Sadly though, most of the times Sam had been with them was by necessity, when Dean needed him most, either during heats or when he wasn’t doing so well physically or emotionally.
“Seriously Cas why can’t we do this on a weeknight? Like Wednesday night, Wednesdays are boring, I would love to do this on Wednesdays. It would make my day seriously! Wednesday!” he pulls the cover tighter over his eyes, daylight sucks.
“No problem. Charlie’s so quick with this stuff that she sometimes forgets that the rest of us aren’t.” he shrugs, “we all just do our best to keep up. Dean’s always teasing her about it, but he doesn’t complain when she hooks him up with the latest games and movies that aren’t even out yet.”
“He’d been with us for about three months when he had the first seizure. He’d hidden his other symptoms because he was terrified of submitting. He just didn’t trust us and knew that if he started to show symptoms again, we would force the issue. When he woke up in the clinic, he played it off by agreeing to start training the next day. That night was the first time he broke out.”
She pulled a swipe card out of his back pocket and handed it to Castiel, “This will get you into Deans rooms and any room in the clinic, as well as your apartment, the public parts of the Mainhouse and onto The Estate.”
“From what I’ve heard, Dad and Dean’s mother Mary, had him when they were both teenagers. Dad won’t talk about it, and no one else will tell me what happened, but I know that when she ran away, she took Dean with her. Dad got a letter from her when Dean was about a year old.”
At one of his gallery showings, before it all went to hell, he’d watched a man in a tan coat fight rough and drenching weather to see his art. It was one of the only times the gallery had been nearly empty and Dean had been so thankful for the quiet reprieve from the normally hectic nights. He watched as the man stood long minutes in front of each piece and with such a complex expression on his face that Dean had lost the courage to speak to him, as much as he had yearned to.
Cas leant over and caught his mouth in a bruising kiss, not letting up till Dean was gasping for air.
Once Dean was finished, Gabe gave him a moment to gather himself, spending just a little too long washing his hands and readying the equipment.
Gabriel knew that the absolute last thing John Winchester wanted to do was trust an outsider with the care of his vulnerable son, let alone a Progressive one. But John was a practical man, who understood that while part of his role was to uphold Tradition, dealing with the complexities of life sometimes required  he take a slightly more flexible and pragmatic approach. As Head of the House, John was empowered to make many decisions regarding the lives of his people, the rules and set expectations, he had to simultaneously enforce the rigid cultural expectations of the Harbour Society, while also adapting them to best suit the needs of his House.
At first, he’d thought he was just another lawyer representing the House. He’d just politely refused again and was moving to hang up, when he heard Sam yell down the line, words he’d hoped to never hear again.
Dean resists for a moment, limbs hard and tense again his, his body arching up, eyes shooting open in panic. He’s lost still but coming around, gaze unfocused, searching, frantic.
“I’ll take you down to the clinic and introduce you to him. Benny also asked me to pass on an update about Dean. He used a lot of technical terms, so I wrote them down”. Charlie said as she pulled out a notepad and read it to them both, shrugging apologetically, “He said tell you, and I quote –
About two months into his stay, Nick started losing weight, getting night terrors where he’d wake up screaming and sobbing, scratching his arms and shoulders so deeply that the therapists had to put him in mitts. They swapped out Nick’s hourly hormone tests for a Continuous Hormone Monitoring device (CHM). He stopped eating about a month later, slowly growing weaker and sicker. He started talking to his dead wife, begging her to allow him to drop, screaming at her when he couldn’t. He was losing touch with reality.
Then the pressure starts, and Cas wasn’t kidding, he did feel the need to go but it’s peripheral, instead he wants push into it, the half burn half caress is maddening. But Cas seems to know this and rests his other hand high up on his back, anchoring him in place.
But Cas is smiling too, eager to reach for his stethoscope and begin the practical part of the exam.
He helped him up then and led him over to the couch where he had already set up a gravity bag on an IV stand. Settling him against the cushions, he attached the bag, cleared the tube and toggled it to slowly flow down inside him.
They had three spare rooms in their house but kept one especially for Sam and Jess, Cas hoped it might encourage them to visit a little more often.
They chose to live according to a strict set of Dynamic based rules and structures, known as Protocols. The higher your Dynamic Designation, the stricter and more demanding the protocols became. It was argued that the higher level Designations, used these structures to more successfully fulfil their deeper needs for Dominance and Submission, and that by engaging with their Dynamic throughout their everyday lives, they experienced lower stress levels, diet and lifestyle illnesses, low rates of mental illness, cancer and autoimmune disease.
After Nick’s body had been taken away and the therapists, terrified he’d relapse also, brought in the only Pure Submissive within an hour’s drive of the facility to scene with him. Under their supervision, he’d brought her down carefully. Using every skill, he had learned, every technique he could remember to send her down into the deepest, most complete submissive headspace he could achieve. He worshipped her body and sent her mind flying. By giving her everything he had, he got a small gift of serenity in return. Afterwards, when she kissed him gently on the cheek, she’d thanked him for the best scene of her life.
“I just hope that with your help, that someone might be able to get through to him. I just hate that he’s still so incredibly isolated.”
He was vaguely familiar with Society Houses, but just like everyone else, most of what he knew came from movies and popular culture. Castiel wasn’t sure how much of what he had heard reflected reality and what was a myth as they were notoriously restrictive and rarely allowed non-members access to their private spaces.
“I did,” the smile that greets him, brighter and more alive than Cas had ever hoped to see. He can remember the desperation he’d felt in those earliest days, of trying to break through Dean’s emptiness to find the man he knew existed underneath, the one he saw through his art. He remembers the first time Dean cared enough to resist his help with fondness, the first time Dean argued back had delighted him, and he remembers one morning the light streaming through their window and watching Dean lay himself down in the warm patch of sunlight on the rug, finally giving himself over to the simple pleasure of feeling.
He knew that The Harbour Society was one of the Fifteen ‘Traditional’ Societies that operated globally. And that people who joined or were raised within one of these ‘Societies’ were expected to live according to what they called ‘Traditional Culture’. During his training as a Dynamic Therapist, Castiel had read about ‘Traditional Culture’ and it had fascinated him.  It was based on the belief that a person’s Dynamic Designation, should be fully integrated into every aspect of their life rather than isolated into individual ‘scenes’ as was typical in mainstream culture.
“That’s ok,” Castiel reassures him, “I’m used to people not knowing what information is relevant and what isn’t. How about I ask some questions?”
“A sensible decision,” Castiel was pleased to hear that they were apparently taking the medical risk very seriously.
The pelvic floor exercises Castiel included twice daily in Dean’s physical training also helped stretch, work and relax his internal muscles. Plus, the lack of pain and increased pleasure Dean felt being entered made it absolutely worthwhile.
He would need to have a long conversation with Dean about each of the treatments that had been tried, which he felt were helpful and which he considered punitive. Castiel was starting to suspect that he may have a significant number of treatments to cross off his list.
Castiel had seen the changes himself, not just in Dean physically and emotionally but also in his work. He’d heard of Dean before he met him for the first time, been to more than one of his openings and been viscerally challenged and struck by his art. The work he completed in the years prior to their relationship was stunning, that much was obvious, but it was also heartbreaking. The sculptures he created were a combination of metal spires welded together with pottery fired with shards of glass, graceful yet brutal, and painful to comprehend. He understood why the university had stepped in to practically force Sam and Dean to sign the guardianship contract offered by the Omega Support Program. They didn’t want to lose one of their most talented and beloved staff members. He'd almost died, and his destructive spiral down into harmful behaviours needed to end.
Dean snorts, but it's a sad lonely sound, “If that was all it was, I'd….God Cas! You don't know the shit I've done.”
Cas, as usual responded calmly, barely reacting to the outburst, unsurprised. Instead he gently reached down to secure the straps more firmly, holding him even tighter to the bench and the machine. Then he reached between Dean's legs and felt the swollen, aching passages there, a relieved expression flickering across his eyes.
Gabe guides Dean over to the giant shower stalls in the corner and helps him inside. Cas follows them in, carrying a set of waterproof cuffs which he clips around Dean’s wrists before releasing the rest of the harness.
“I have absolutely no idea!” Sam laughed bitterly, “He went missing before I was born. I mean, I always knew I had an older brother, because Dad talked about him sometimes. But throughout my childhood, Dad employed a bunch of private investigators and detectives to search for him. He never stopped looking.”
The both sleep naked so it was an easy thing to turn the water on and scrub them both down. Dean was even pliant enough that he allowed Castiel to use the inbuilt enema hose in the shower stall instead of his preferred gravity bag to give him his morning enema. Castiel kissed him encouragingly and had him hold it for a few minutes while he washed both their hair.
“And what? Stayed with Dean the whole time? Turned down the job of a lifetime to babysit a brother who was by all accounts excelling?”
“He uh….he just turned up one night, boot full of whiskey and told me he was crashing for a while. Told me not to tell Sam, said Sam was dead to him.”
“They’re fine. They’ve been here often enough to know where everything is. We can go to bed now too.”
Then the waist. It’s a heavy belt, almost eight inches wide and fastened in two places to guard against tampering. He likes this model, had bought it especially for Dean because it can be combined with the shoulder straps to provide a much more secure system. He pulls them down from the strap under his shoulders and across Dean’s torso, effectively immobilizing him against the mattress. It also has the option of two additional side straps that prevent Dean from turning within the belt. He fastens those too.
Dean finally lets go of Jess and lets himself be guided in under Cas’s arm. Castiel knows how Dean struggles with emotion this powerful, with happiness especially.
PLEASE NOTE CHAPTER 5 HAS BEEN REWRITTEN AND REPOSTED. You don't need to read that chapter to get this one since it's basically pwp, but you might like to since it is very different now and depicts their relationship in a completely different and more positive way than originally posted.
I can see it now, looking back, how messed up he was, how cruel. He never actually said it and he’d have denied it if asked (even to himself I reckon) but I knew he blamed Dean. Didn’t want to, Dean was only a kid, a baby and it was totally illogical. But that’s pain for you, can make you think crazy things.
“John. That’s just…. I’m so sorry,” the man on the other end of the line was clearly lost for words, he knew how difficult it was for John, how he desperately wanted to connect with his child, “But now that the council has approved the employment of that Dynamic Therapist, he might finally respond to treatment.”
Dean disappeard from the line for a moment and could be heard chatting quietly in the background before reappearing a moment later.
“Might as well try and get a couple of hours sleep. I doubt we’ll manage much but it might be helpful to at least lay down. You should nap too. Sam always tried to fit in as many hours as he could early on,”
“I’m going to feed you now. But you can sleep if you like.” Dean is already dropping off before Cas has even finished speaking, his vision blurring before blackness sweeps across everything.
Cas can feel Dean shivering with the need he’s been denied, his body betraying exactly how hard this past week has been. Not once has Dean attempted to ease his discomfort, attempted to gain the self-pleasure that was once habitual for him but it’s been hard won and Cas wants to ease this for him as much as he can.
Cas doesn’t even need to considers it, he kisses him then, passionately, possessive tongue working against Dean’s greedy mouth.
Not today though, today Cas had started in almost immediately, sensing his desire to get on with it.Taking him first through the general part of the examination carefully but quickly, listening to his lungs and heart, taking his blood pressure and glucose levels etc. He’d only slowed down when he went to draw blood, sitting Dean down and taking his hand tenderly. Cas didn’t like to see him bleed, even if it was just for testing, it disgusted him, but he did it anyway, always the obsessive collecting of data and testing for everything. Dean would tease him about it except he understood how much it meant to Castiel.
Dean took a steadying breath and started. He clenched, held, counted and released, eight times. Not strenuous but it took long enough for him to grow seriously uncomfortable with Gabe’s hand.
He breathes, controls the in and out in carefully counted pace. It's enough for Cas to notice, he pauses, smiles at Dean reassuringly
“No!” You did what he asked you to do, that’s not your fault. He was a manipulative, abusive asshole who knew exactly the hold he had on you.” Cas doesn’t sugar coat it, knowing that’s not what Dean needs.
“There you are.”  He adjusts the water just a little colder and aims the spray over the back of Dean’s head and neck. A little shock to the system to help his mind along.
“Good because Dr Novak’s not going to know anything about how things work here, any of our laws, protocols, beliefs, nothing. We’re going to have to help him fit in or it’s going to be a disaster.”
“Well anyway, they got us into supported housing and Dean on a program. He had to step down off the suppressants, painfully slowly too, over about eight months. They had him come into the OSP Centre every day while I was in class. They taught him stuff he’d missed out on and put him into therapy sessions with other omegas. They helped me too, sending over a support person to teach me how to help him and just to talk with about it all.”
“Lets try something else,” he suggested, his mind running a mile a minute coming up with possibilities.
“I’m going to take such good care of you,” he’d explained as he slipped into bed with him that night, careful not to disturb any of the attachments, “you’ll see.”
“You're doing great sweetheart,” he said resting his hand gently on the base of his spine, feeling the tension there.
It’s only accessible through the garage as it’s an addition to the house, and usually remained locked between heats. Cas’s had it added last year after spending their Heats at the OSP centre had grown increasingly problematic for Dean. Gabe sympathised with them, having to go through such an intimate and vulnerable process under the supervision of the centre staff must have been an ordeal.
“You’ll have that. I promise,” he smiles and kisses the inside of Dean's thigh, thanking him for everything, for this gift he’s giving him.
The rest of the day had been spent easily enough. Cas had woken him after an hour or so and gotten him up and into the training room for some basic obedience exercises. He hadn’t worked Dean too hard, just some basic crawling techniques and stress positions, knowing that Dean was already feeling pretty vulnerable. Then they’d had dinner and Dean had watched a movie while Cas read through some research papers on Omega fertility. Dean knew that Cas was still looking for something to help him but he no longer commented, not wanting to build any unfounded hope. If Cas found anything, he’d tell him.
“Nil by mouth,” Castiel reminded gently as Dean continued to stare at the mug. He kissed his grumpy lover on the forehead, knowing he just needed time to adjust.
He flops down on the familiar seat and grunts in annoyance at himself for needing it, “All of it, just buckle me in. Tight. This is really going to suck.”
Gabe can see his tension,“Just relax man, let it happen.” he says, flopping down beside him on the sofa and pulling out his tablet.
Cas made the call. He didn’t want to, but he desperately needed to know, they had to face this and Sam was really the only one who would be able to tell him the whole truth, what he knew of it anyway. Thought he knew Dean wanted desperately to tell him everything, had even tried to in the past, he just wasn't capable of seeing it for what is was, not yet at least. For him it was too distorted by suffering, too clouded by his innate desire to please and obey his father.
The problem was that but itself a CRP frame could only provide a temporary, insufficient treatment. Subs needed Dominants, they needed human contact and connection during times of distress. Submissives needed to be guided down into their headspaces. Consequently, Castiel used close contact restraints and bodyweight positioning as a soothing and calming method rather than CRP frames.
“Do you think..is it ok if…” he looks across at the door as if Sam might walk through it at any moment when he knows full well that Sam won’t be there till much later.
Castiel considers for a moment whether it’s too early to start making changes to the care-plan, but figures there’s no harm in offering general advice, “Deep Pressure Stimulation is more effective at engaging the parasympathetic nervous system if used on a routine or continuous basis. I’d like to observe the effects it has on him directly, but he may benefit from a more routine use of restrictive-pressure garments. If it proves effective, I’d recommend we have a custom garment made to alleviate the sensory concerns. We should also consider trailing the use of Joint Compressions and The Carisi Protocol.”
Dean doesn’t grace him with an answer. Sure, he thought, it was nice to spend a whole day with Cas, and he secretly loved having Cas’s hands all over him but Saturdays were for sleep, for eating junk food while playing video games, for lounging round and ordering pizza. Or at least they were before, before everything changed...But before, most days had ended badly, most days he didn’t want to remember before, wanted to curl up in Castiel’s world and never leave, let him guide the way and forget what had been.
He was also grieving. He had recently lost his wife, his dominant, in a car accident. His family had decided to admit him as a precaution due to his high-risk designation.
He wanted to touch himself, touch something, reach between his own legs and feel the long cylinder of plastic as it slid deeper and deeper, reach down into the machine and measure with his fingers how much more there was to go, how many inches still waiting patiently to work it's way inside. He wanted to ask but couldn't, unable to speak. And he wanted to touch his belly, to see if he could actually feel the thing each time it pushed up and up. He clenched his teeth and fought the straps again, knowing it was futile.
“Not tonight. You’ve worked your body hard enough today. Go to the bedroom and lay down. I’ll be there in a minute.”
Cas walks around the other side of the bed and clips the straps to their counterparts. He tests them, convinced.
Castiel for his part wasn’t hiding his own lunch but he didn’t make a big deal out of it either. Eating his fill and throwing away the packaging within the first few minutes of their time together. He knew this was hard for Dean and while part of the process was about building more enthusiasm towards eating, he’s not going to make Dean suffer needlessly.
“He’s talked to me about what you had together, the better memories. He knows you loved him even then and he remembers when it was good.” what small solaces Cas can offer feel cold, meaningless coming from him.
“I’m going to try put it off for a several more hours at least,” Dean groaned in frustration and his breathing picked up speed, obviously listening in to the conversation, even if he didn’t feel able to take part.
It doesn’t register when Cas first arrives. He can feel hands on his shoulders and tries to get away from them, tries to escape but they don’t let him. He struggles, unable to speak but he groans, forming inhuman sounds from between locked teeth.
Cas takes pity and releases him, but only to slide his hand down to massage his balls. Casually he slips his other hand down further, seeking the first passage, sure to be slick with need. He eases a couple of fingers inside in search of that other spot, that place that soon has Dean begging again and forcing his back to arch up and out, causing his feet to momentarily lose traction on the bottom of the tub so he jolts down slightly before he catches himself, serving only to plant himself even more firmly on the now three fingers working themselves steadily in and out of him.
Cas pulls up the heart rate app and show Sam a readout. “We recently did a 48 hour holter monitor heart test, the results were pleasing but further monitoring will be necessary to rule out….” Dean start to zone out, disinterested in the boring conversation, comfortable enough to let him mind wander. He should feel thankful, he reminds himself, that the only feeling he’s dealing with now is boredom, too many times before he’d sat in similar examination rooms and listened to himself being talked about, talked to, and all he could feel was misery at his own weakness and shame at needing this.
He eased Dean’s legs straight, locking the many straps tight down each of his legs till they were completely immobile.
Though it still feels weird to Dean, standing under the spray and feeling his own hands working the soap and the shampoo up into his hair, it’s disconcerting. He’d actually refused to have Castiel wash him when he first came here. He had railed against the gentle way Castiel had soothed the washcloth over skin, the expensive goat’s milk soap Cas prefered, the care taken. It scared him, the intimacy of it all. He wanted it so badly but at the same time was so unused to gentle touch that it felt dangerous, it terrified him how much he wanted it, what it did to him when he could have it. The chance it might all be taken away.
“I’m so happy to be joining your family. I’d mean so much to us if you could both be there.” she whispers to him as her arms pull him in tight.
Eventually the words filtered back in, Cas’s voice soothing and calm, sounding like he’d been speaking for quite a while.
So now when Dean hears them, he breathes deeply. Knowing the hardest part is to come. “I know. I’m ready.”
“Oh darling, you took that so well. You have no idea how proud I am of you!” he looked so absolutely convinced of this that Dean couldn’t help but smile back at him, his heart warming if not his dick.
Luckily no emergencies occurred that afternoon and after a satisfying consultation with the young Omega in which several strategies were discussed, Castiel was able to leave right on time.
Then he’d had him up on the table, efficiently working him open both passages at once, obviously trying to help Dean but getting through it quickly and efficiently. So much for that Dean thought wrily as he clenched his muscles again slightly, working himself as best he could against the metal instrument inside him.
And though he knows differently now, it's still a knife edge, sharp and dangerous and he has to try desperately to force himself away from that place that offers him nothing.
Dean finished his shower and turned off the tap, turning to face the wall hands braced against the cold tile. Cas reached around him for the enema hose and filled him, letting the water do its work. Saturdays required a larger volume so by the time Cas shut it off Dean was panting slightly, gritting his teeth against the cramping. Cas rested his hands against Dean’s swollen belly, soothing slightly the ache.
“Not like I’d get to join in anyway even if we did,” Dean grouses, but laughs at himself after a moment, “maybe I can convince Cas to let me off easy this time. Sounds like it’s going to be a special occasion.”
"Also affection, especially public displays of affection," Benny offers, "All the books say that Pure Subs need lots of physical contact and affection to remain stable, especially doing stressful events like when they are required to go out in public. Sam and John were always careful to follow the medical advice of keeping almost constant physical contact with Dean whenever they were out in public with him. They'd take his hand, sit him in their lap, pull him into their arms, swing an arm around his waist, the usual stuff you do with any submissive, but Dean really seemed to dislike it."
“Cas?” Dean’s voice has a strange nervousness to it, enough to make Cas look up from the research paper he was reading and peer at him curiously.
It happens so quickly that Dean is left breathless and gasping. Both of them pushed to the edge and finally coming back down. And though it’s a different high than an orgasm, something about it makes it just as sweet. Cas is curling into to him protectively, engulfing him as much has he can, their bodies still tied together with the knot.
Dean wished that if he ever was in real trouble that a dedicated doctor like Castiel was on hand to treat him.
“We really just want you guys there and Jess’s immediate family.” Sam adds, “and we’re going to do it soon. Maybe in July.”
“Look at you, being all open minded,” Gabe teased, falling back into his joking persona with practiced ease, relieved to hear that John, who was usually so strict on protocol, finally understood the need for compromise on this, at least somewhat, “You’re getting soft old man!”
Even with the prior warning, Cas had known that this would hit him roughly. Dean expects so little happiness from life that every small piece of joy feels sharp and cruel, adding more weight to the things he might lose, the unfair but completely understandable expectation of it all being ripped away yet again. The possibility of losing it all just that much more painful to bare.
Dad, he wasn’t so lucky. Got what he wanted I guess. Partially anyway.” The last word is almost regretful sounding, agonising.
Castiel slid in his first custom dilator. It wasn’t enlarged yet, it started as a moderately sized metallic object, fitted with a slightly flared base and slid easily into Dean’s welcoming passage. It wasn’t until Castiel pulled up the app on his phone that controlled the device that it’s real size was felt. It expanded, sensing automatically the edge of true discomfort and skirted it, frustratingly expanding gradually, hour after hour until come morning it would need to be to be disabled and reduced before removal. Due to Dean's years of suppressant abuse, he needed the dilation treatment, as much as he hated it, he also knew it was necessary.The dilators were designed to never become actually painful, but initially they unsettled Dean enough that the first few night of their use Castiel had needed to fit Dean with medical mitts to prevent him trying to remove them and cause himself harm.
It was a line they both drew. Dean knew Castiel had his body and his love but he would never touch his art. He swore to himself that if he ever even tried, that would be the end of it, he would call the OSP and terminate the contract then and there, his lovelife be damned, his job be damned, his health and sanity be damned, the whole world could go to hell as far as he was concerned. He knew he was better off with Cas, more stable, but that didn’t mean there weren’t lines that couldn’t be crossed, luckily Cas seemed to instinctively understand this, one of the many reasons Dean loved him.
Dean couldn’t help a slight moan as Castiel slipped his lightly lubricated fingers inside him. Castiel hadn’t entered Dean nor allowed him any release for several days and Dean was obviously missing it. Rarely did Castiel deny him this long but he firmly believed that it was in Dean's best interests to be denied at times, for him to understand his needs and be pushed to accept Castiels control over this aspect of his life now. It was hard for him, Castiel knew that, he was such a sexual being, but thankfully in this at least Dean understood that Cas was helping his body and mind find a more healthy path to submission, through acceptance. He wouldn’t beg, not yet at least.
Cas pulls out the familiar file and contemplates his options. He knows Dean’s going to need reassurance and grounding, some way to stay connected to the present moment when the past threatens. Something physical he thinks, something to tether his control to, something steady. The blindfold is therefore out and he needs to speak, so a gag can’t be used. He looks around the room considering before laying his eyes on the heavy wooden chair settled in the corner.
Dean sighs, “I know you meant well. I just struggle with it. I know you do your best but it’s going to take time.”
But, before he starts he recites his promise to Dean and the very first thing he ever said to him, reminding him of it once again, “I want you to remember this promise. You are safe. You are mine and I will take care of you. You can stop fighting now.” It’s like a mantra, one Dean has heard Cas say thousands of times. He’d first said it in the OSP clinic on that first day, as Dean lay on the gurney, strapped down and ready for transport to Cas’s home. He’d leant over and checked the IV, before placing his warm palms on either side of Dean’s face and forcing him to look up at him and hear those words. Dean had been woozy, drugged and sore at the time but heard them clearly enough. Heard the promise in them. The finality of them.
“It’s me. That’s it, slow your breathing down. You aren’t there anymore. You’re here with me. Here in our home. That’s it.”
They had already gone over the plan for the next few days in minute detail, had it all figured out. Cas had provided copious notes documenting Dean’s previous heats and a copy of his medical file. They had a strict contingency plans for every possibility.
The next morning Dean's attitude was even worse. Castiel had to hold back his frustration and disappointment. He knew that it always took Dean time to accept this particular treatment, every time they have to do it he took a few days to come around to the idea and that it was nothing personal. But seeing the love of his life scowling at him from the minute he opened his eyes, was not the most pleasant experience to wake up to.
“What happened after that? Castiel asked instead, “They can’t have sent him back to the prison. It’s not a suitable environment for a pure submissive.”
Cas pins him down, holds him tight, past experience has taught him to hold on, hold him and don’t let him go. Otherwise Dean just breaks faster, breaks further, curls in on himself and lets the pain take him over. Loses himself. The suffering all consuming.
“He also had Dean placed on the Vulnerable Submissives Register,” Castiel grimaced, but that followed, Dean definitely was vulnerable enough to justify listing him.
The problem, his professors had explained, was that no one actually wants to believe it. We want submission and domination to be easy to understand, give and take, black and white, but it’s not. And unless we keep that in mind, people are going to die.
“More than anything. I want to get this shit out there. Over with. I hate you not knowing...and what...what I did after...I feel so fucking guilty, and so fucking…..weak.”
He knows that's when they realized, saw him slowly coming undone under a doctor's gentle examination and thought to themselves, this will do.
“Yes, I can assure you that we took that requirement into consideration when allocating your apartment. It’s one of three directly above the clinic. Normally, it’s made available to on-call doctors and staff members, but they were more than happy to use the other two for the instead. It has direct access to the clinical rooms via the staircase directly across the hall. Dean’s rooms are just off to the left of the clinic. It was decided early on that it would be best if he was accommodated close to medical supervision and treatment.”
“Oh yeah, definitely. He’s always liked movies and TV shows. He wasn’t much of a gamer before he got sick though, but since he’s been confined to his rooms, he’s gotten into a bunch of them. Him and Charlie spend hours together going on adventures and battling monsters,” Benny’s voice sounds fond, affectionate even.
“We need to talk about Dean.” Castiel didn’t want to have this conversation over the phone, hell he didn’t want to have this conversation at all, but it was for Dean so he persisted.
“Yeah, and it was fucking agony. Every cell was burning and there was nothing I could do for it but let them take me. I begged them to, over and over. I’m not even sure how many. I stopped thinking, stopped remembering, stopped being. I know that’s fucked up alright. But it was the only thing that worked. It felt right that they used me. I’m sorry!” He looks shattered and guilty as if his actions were somehow damaging to Castiel instead of himself.
Plus, it wasn't like he could masturbate or anything, Castiel would be ringing him immediately to ask about his elevated heart rate and why the sensors in his daytime dilators were registering unusual readings.
“I can certainly make it a high priority.” Castiel shuddered to think what decades of dental neglect might have done to his teeth. That would definitely be extremely high on the list.
That came out way sadder and angsty than planned :( Weird chapter I know, but some people have been asking for flashbacks to Dean at the OSP for ages now and while I didn't want to deal with Cas and Dean's early days (thinking a sequel for that, what do you think?) I did want to go into the immobilization thing and how they figured out that Dean might respond to medical intervention in an atypical way. He's still pretty messed up in the head at that point so it reads as pretty dark and sad, sorry about the feels!
“I’ll be off then. Here catch,” Charlie said as she tossed him a weirdly sleek looking phone “Just give me a call when you’re finished and I’ll show you around the rest of the grounds.”
“Dean? Are you ok?” It’s Charlie, Dean can hear her steps quickly approaching, she’s practically running, reading from his body language that he’s really not ok.
Before approaching them, he clicked the pheromone canister into the slot on the side of the mask, activating it momentarily to check the speed of release. The mask covered the lower half of Dean’s face, fitting snugly over his nose, mouth and under his chin.  It forced him to breathe in an artificial alpha control pheromone called Aphroxil, used to make him pliable and obedient. It was also completely illegal outside of clinical settings.
The alarm startled Gabe just as he was dozing off, the sharp tone jolting him awake with the harsh kick of adrenaline.
Gabe lets Cas finish washing Dean, choosing instead to retrieve the next harness setup. Laying it out on the table by the door.
Gabriel leant over to check the contents of his bag yet again, trying to calm the nervous energy that coursed through him.
“But you know what’s worse?” Sam all bitter resentment, “They’d get him fed, hydrated and up on his feet again for a couple of weeks and then the next one would hit and the next and the next, for months. He was in and out of hospital and basically living at the OSP centre between heats. Even though they said it would get better, I eventually stopped believing them, not that I let Dean know that, but it was just… just so scary and I was so angry. I wanted to track Dad down, make him go through what Dean was going through. I wanted to hurt him for it.”
Benny looked down a moment, studying his hands, "We think it's mainly an issue with sensory processing, since the first things to go were strong flavours and rough textures. But he's also started to develop food intolerances. "
“Feels ok for now. Cas will be by in a couple of hours and will probably check again then. Let’s leave it for now.”
“That’s it. You can relax now,” He sat next to him on the sofa and he eased Dean’s body down so he was relaxing with his back resting against Castiel’s chest “I’ve set it to a slow feed.” Dean groaned, of course he’d set it slow. He loved to see Dean unable to move, tied physically to the stand, reliant on Castiel even down to this basic level.
He nods, resting his head against Cas’s solid shoulder. They sit there for a moment longer, listening to the sounds of the world slowly drift back, the traffic noise from the street behind them, the clatter of feet passing, calming in its unimportance.
As they strode through the swinging double doors to the ‘clinic’ Castiel realises that this was much more like a hospital than any general practice he had visited. It had a series of corridors leading off in several directions and he could see ward rooms with several beds in each, nurses stations, examination rooms, signs for X-ray, MRI and dental facilities and if he wasn’t mistaken, even a surgical suite.
Cas slid the lights up to half brightness, his face a little less wrecked now that he’d managed a few hours sleep, but still very tired. And completely lucid. Not a trace of his earlier Rut induced need in his eyes. He was well and truly finished and he knew it.
“I’m doing good too. Honestly. It’s hard with the extra classes they’ve asked me to I teach and the commission work, but I’m happy, feel like I’m really achieving something here.” but then his voice drops and he guiltily adds, because he knows Cas would want him to keep Sam informed, “but, I lost some weight again, been pretty irresponsible with my meals outside the house. Cas put me back on that damn liquid diet.”
“Breathe Dean,” he reminds, calm as ever while Dean goes to pieces on his examination table. The want is just too much, seven days and Cas hasn’t entered him once, hasn’t let him come once. The desires is like a drug coursing through his body, searing his skin with hot tendrils of want. God, he thinks to himself, if it’s this bad now, what is it going to be like in a few days.
“It’s ok. You held it as long as you could," he rubbed as his abdomen comfortingly as the last of the liquid made it’s way into the bowl.
“Yes, I have several different designs in mind. Once I’ve met with Dean and talked it through with him, I’ll email you the details.”
“After the last time I mean, I was so worried. That last time man, it was rough, no one figured you’d be able to take that much but you did! You were a champ!” but the jovial tone faded and then man’s eyes clouded over with regret,  “I worried... didn’t think you’d make it a year putting yourself through shit like that let alone show up here looking so great. It’s a relief you know.”
“No, just take me through to his room.  I can build trust more successfully if I initially work alone.”
The whole setup reminded him of a locked dementia ward he’d once visited, he wondered if Dean’s safety plan was based on similarly resuscitative protocols.
The vaginal dilator in Dean’s other passage was shaped slightly differently but acted much the same and though he didn’t introduce it until Dean accustomed himself to the first device, both were now familiar enough that Dean no longer hesitated in laying himself over the bench.
He can’t help it though and unconsciously shifts again against the speculum, even the small movement sending sparks up his spine and forcing him to bite back a moan, not wanting Cas to stop what he’s doing. He doesn’t mind being up on the table, actually loves being the centre of Cas’s entire focus for the several hours every Saturday morning, but that doesn’t meant he doesn’t struggle with the position.
Dean had inevitably spent many hours early-on in that chair looking out the window or listening to whatever music Cas put on the stereo. And while sometimes the chair was used for disciplinary purposes, it wasn’t meant to be a punishment, more a place to reflect on himself and sort out his mind. Cas always tried to make Dean’s time there as comfortable and pleasant as possible. There were even times when Dean had simply lowered himself down onto it tensely and hoped Cas could figure out the rest, which he invariably did.
“Do you want to go on?” Fearing the answer, but believing in Dean enough to trust him with the choice.
He gets why Castiel wants him to wait, the intrinsic and frankly base desire to submit, to offer himself up in this way would be enough but the build up is delicious too. The way his skin tingles every time Cas touches him, the way he can’t help following the line of Cas’s ass with renewed want everytime he sees it. It’s going to feel amazing having him inside him again.
A week ago, recruiters from Caladh House (of The Harbour Society) had approached him with an incredible employment offer; sign a one-year confidential employment contract and they would pay him a salary three times his normal rate, he would be crazy to refuse.   He’d turned them down immediately.
Reminder that tapping out is totally okay! If it's just too much skip this chapter or just tap out completely, I don't want people uncomfortable or triggered!!
Gabe flicked his screen over to the app recording the various vital signs from the sensors placed about Dean’s body, they were elevated but not worryingly so, fairly normal for a pre-heat Omega.
“...that’s it. Good. Just a little longer. You’re doing so well…” Dean could feel the wetness on his cheeks and dampening on the pillow where the tears had pooled.
The suggestion sets Dean of again, viciously scratching (though they'd cut his fingernails yesterday for just this reason) and tearing at the arms around him.
The next day, for the first time the feeding tube and catheter had gone in, as well as the application of glucose monitors, pulse oximeters, blood pressure, and other monitoring devices. He’d spent the day interviewing him, digging down as far as he could into Dean’s medical history, family history, everything, interrogating him about past. He would spend the next few weeks documenting every part of him, collecting data, learning and building a plan.
“Oh,” Dean’s not sure whether to feel disappointed or relieved. He was exhausted, down to the bones tired and wrung out. All he wanted now was empty unconsciousness, with hour upon hours of dreamless sleep.
Castiel had hoped to at least start their conversation on a lighter topic, but he supposes, with how bad things have apparently gotten, there were few easy topics left. He steers the conversation back to slightly happier ground, for now at least.
He moans and shakes his head a little as the plastic mouthpiece eases out between his teeth. Cas strokes his hair gently, "I know, sweetheart," he pressed his mouth against Dean's lips, pushing his tongue in to deepen the kiss, helping him chase away the bitter taste of the artificial pheromones and replace them with his own.
There were many gaps still, months and even years, where Dean seemed to fall off the public record, either going by an alias or more likely homeless and living off the grid somewhere. There was a wealth of information and yet somehow it all provided very little insight into who Dean actually was, it wasn’t enough. Castiel couldn’t help the feeling that there were pieces still missing from the puzzle, that the image he was creating just didn’t yet make sense.
“You. You inside me tonight, I don’t want to come but I want you, us together. Please!” his voice breaks a little, showing his weakness. He misses Cas inside him, the connection. He doesn’t want to go back to bed tonight and just have them fall asleep in eachothers arms. He wants more, needs more.
The doctor had checked the test results twice, not quite believing what it said, before phoning his parents and telling them to immediately take him to the hospital. The doctor had met them there, face grey with shock and despair, “This never happens,” he’d explained, “it’s so rare as to be almost impossible, no one could have known!”.  But by then Castiel was already too far gone, and they couldn’t get him stabilised quickly enough. That night he started seizing while trying to walk to the bathroom.
“God, I hope so! Actually, shouldn’t he be here by now?” John leant out of the doorway to his office and bellowed, “Kevin?!”
Then Cas is climbing into the car and they’re driving away. Unconsciousness does taken him then finally, once he can hear Cas’s breath, beside him, easing him off to sleep.
Cas gave him a thoughtful look before he spoke,"That's not uncommon," he informed him gently, "There could be any number of reasons why he's had difficulties eating, most of them completely treatable."
Please do tell me what you think! I genuinely like to know which parts people like and which parts they're not fussed on. Helps me become a better writer and judge the direction a fic should go in (I have the basic plot mapped out, I'm looking more at the tone of the writing and the kinks!), especially when I'm writing out of my comfort zone as I am with this fic. So please comment, comment, comment!
“That’s real good Dean. Because Jess and I were hoping to come up and visit, maybe next weekend? We’ve got something to tell you guys.”
“Dean. Wake up! Right now. Wake up!” he orders harshly, knowing it was one of the only ways to break this, break through to him.
“Can you tell me a bit more about his main areas of concern?” Cas asks gently, “What bothers him most? It’s helpful to know and account for any main trigger areas before I meet him.” Cas pulled out his notepad and wrote:
“Lean over for me. You’re a bit dry.” he instructed. Dean settled his arms easily against the pack of the chair, finally relaxed now that the physical discomfort was over. Cas slicked him up gently, not wanting to stimulate him too much as he didn’t plan to take this any further. He slipped two fingers into each passage and asked him to clench and release, checking his pelvic floor.
In those three words, the judge had rendered Dean entirely powerless and reliant on the goodwill of the House. By declaring Dean ‘legally incompetent and irrational’ the judge had stripped him of almost all his of civil liberties including; the right to liberty, freedom of speech, right to own property, right to body autonomy and integrity, right to privacy, right to equal treatment under the law and due process. Castiel felt sick at the thought. That Judge had really done everything in his power to bind Dean to Caladh House.
Dean nods, before testing the restraints, working his muscles against the soft leather, feeling the resistance, the security.
Gabe was a beta, so the instinct didn’t come naturally to him but he understood the mechanics. He climbed in beside them on the mattress as Castiel turned them both sideways so Dean’s back was to him. Gabriel slipped his arms around Dean’s middle, as tightly as he could while locking his left leg over Deans.
He climbed up on the bed and rested his back against the headboard, legs open and his body language non threatening.
Gabriel laughed, “It was either her or Ash. You know how inflexible the rest of your people can be! They would waste his time teaching him High Protocol cutlery etiquette or some other bullshit. He needs to focus on Dean, everything else can go to hell.”
Castiel frowned. To go from utter neglect to being placed under this level of civil control was beyond self-correcting, this was the system doing a complete 180-degree turn. He didn’t understand it. He’d heard of permanent guardianship contracts including some caretaking requirements, but nothing like this. To also have so many focussed on preventing Dean from escaping…. He wondered whether the judge had been influenced by John or someone else? Maybe someone fearful of Dean disappearing again? Or maybe the judge genuinely believed that ‘Pure Submissives’ really needed this level of rigid guardianship, some people did still maintain extremely outdated notions.
It’s the longest seven minutes he has ever known, the world fades out of focus and all he can feel is the shooting agony and fear of the days, years before, they come crashing back and there is nothing he can do to escape it. His chest feels like someone has taken a knife to his ribs, slicing away at his flesh and bone. He knows he’s curled into himself, can feel all his muscles protesting as he gasps out his pain, knows it all in some distant, unreal way. If only the pain would stop.
“Hey, don’t get me wrong. I definitely want it out. I even asked Cas if he could take it out early, for lunch tomorrow.”
Dean nods, laying back and thinking of as little as possible. He doesn’t close his eyes, instead focussing on Gabriel’s face, familiarising himself with every inch of skin. Watching his brow furrow with concentration.
He was back the next week and the one after that. For months, almost a year he'd had to return week after week as she and other doctors patiently and with the utmost care remade him.
“One last thing,” Cas remembers and returns to the chest, reaching right into the bottom and pulls out the specially designed weighted blanket folded inside.
“I know sweetheart,” Cas was saying, gently brushing the hair back from his forehead, “I feel like such as asshole doing this to you. But you’ve got to believe me, it’ll be worth it. I promise.” The earnestness in his voice winning Dean over all over again.
Castiel gestures to the spare chair beside his examination table. Dean groans, of course they want to do this now, with him sitting there half naked, stuck listening to them discuss him in the most intimate detail.
They would just have to find someone else. It didn’t matter what they offered, he reasoned, he wasn’t interested.
“I hope,” Cas offers, carefully not making any promises, “That I might be able to offer a new perspective and approach to the situation.” Castiel purposefully emphasized that he would be looking to make changes to their approach, it was best to start on the right foot.
“Okay. I’m going to tell you what I know and you can fill in the gaps. I’ll also ask you some questions and I want you to answer them as best you can, even if you need a moment to consider. If you need a break just say so and we’ll stop.”
“You ready to head home?” Gabe asked, the tension obvious around Cas’s eyes. It was clear this was as hard on him as it was on Dean.
Luckily, Sam and Cas knew him well enough to wait, Cas giving him time to process by pulling Sam into a hug, “Congratulations Sam. We’re both thrilled for you.”
“I think the drug lasted too long or something. It’s meant to wear off after a day or so but it didn’t. I remember them forcing me to eat and drink, arguing amongst themselves about what to do. I remember the room growing light and then dark and light again three times. I remember getting weaker and weaker till I couldn’t even lift my head up off the pillow, I think I kept begging for it.
A knock sounds out across the room, hollow against the metal and plastic. Sam enters and smiles at them. He's changed into a comfortable shirt and pants, his hair still a little damp.
