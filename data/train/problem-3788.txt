“Cas?” The question seemed light at first but Dean felt an underlying darkness.
Mrs. Novak glared at her son. It almost seemed as if she was throwing daggers at him with her eyes.  “Make us more tea,” she commanded, thrusting her cup forward as she waited for him to come take it away.
A small hands started pushing at his arm, “Honey, get up.” His mother’s voice might have sounded pleasant to the untrained ear but the Winchester men knew that under the honey sweet tone laid a hint of murder to anyone who didn’t comply with her wishes. Dean opened his eyes, automatically being assaulted with sunlight but forcing his eyes to stay wide.
A large hand gripped the back of his head pulling him forward and forcing a hard cock down his throat. Castiel’s eyes welled up, having not been ready for the sudden intrusion. He felt his scalp move away from his skull, hair nearly being pulled out. For once he had felt the pain. Castiel’s eyes shut tightly, tears streaming down his hot cheeks. He just kept his head as relaxed as possible as it was pushed and pulled off of the moving man. The bees weren’t working…he could still feel the pain and embarrassment. The reason the bees had started had been one extremely unfavorable time when he was younger. It was the first time Metatron had made him go all the way, it was raining and there had been a bee taking shelter from the storm on his windowsill. It amazed Castiel how the little bee was so bright in the darkest of storms and that at the end of it all, that small bee would go straight back to work. Ever since Castiel had wished to be a bee.
Mary Winchester had not expected that. She knew what it was, and she knew what caused it. Of course she did, she was a nurse. And now the way Dean was letting her hold him made sense. He also obviously knew as well. All she could do was pull him in closer. She wanted to protect her son and the person who had, most likely unbeknownst to him, broke through to her baby. Mary wanted to hold them both and set up play dates. If only it was that simple. “You should invite him over.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck, as he often did when thinking, before placing his back against the arm of the chair with his arm resting on the back of the couch and his leg pulled up. Jimmy saw his opening, letting his body relax into Dean. He didn’t care, he just wanted to movie back on.
Dean ordered a piece of pie for himself after he finished everything sitting on his plate, Jimmy slightly envious of the seemingly bottomless pit of a stomach Dean possessed. But when the sweet young lady named Jo came back with a warm piece of apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top Jimmy couldn’t help how his mouth watered.
Now fully dressed, Castiel settled into his bed pulling his laptop into his lap before answering. “What’s his major? Yes, I am a student, are you?” He could imagine the man he met earlier today as an agriculture major, maybe a mechanic. Something that would allow him to get plenty of sun, he did have a lot of freckles after all.  Castiel blushed a little once he realized he had apparently stared harder than he realized. Sure, he had been slightly mesmerized by how the other man moved with such confidence but…who was he kidding? He could make no excuse for his prior action.
[CHAPTER 3]
“You’re so weird.”
“Are you serious?” The disbelief that was in Dean’s voice early was now tripled. It seem like he might go into some kind of heart failure if Jimmy confirmed, so he just nodded his head then let it fall in shame.
Lunch ended and they went their separate ways, until Dean found out that he also shared English with Castiel. He sat through the whole class staring at the back of Cas’ head, which bobbed up and down as he wrote. Every once in a while Cas would bring his pencil up to his lips, tapping them rapidly in an attempt to put his thoughts into words.
“I hate boats even more than I hate planes. At least now I’m on solid ground.”
“Sorry no,” Castiel tilted his head while itching at his arm in a nervous matter.
The day continued, and he served the next wave of students before the sudden vibration of his phone surprised him so much that he knocked over a stack of cups. Castiel quickly apologized to the young lady who was waiting for a cappuccino. She didn’t even notice, being far too wrapped up in her phone to pay attention to Castiel’s mistake.
Before convincing the sleeping Castiel to latch onto his back with his backpack on. Dean put his head through the strap of his messanger bag and started to make his way out into the parking lot. He felt like a zombie, but he wouldn’t allow himself to break down now, this was for Cas.
Dean apparently got sick of this, and jumped on Jimmy from the front, tackling him before he could get the ball. Butterflies assaulted his stomach, the horrid feeling of falling, and Jimmy waited for the pain to come. It didn’t hit him full force as he realized Dean had one hand cradling the back of his head and the other arm wrapped around his back.
He had already completely missed the ride to the diner they were now pulling up to while in thought. It looked small and quaint, warm and homey. Mary and John were laughing again, clutching onto each other as they entered the restaurant. Really, Jimmy envied their relationship. He wanted someone, anyone, to laugh with like that. To completely lose yourself with someone else.
“So you got the job,” once again it was rhetorical but he knew Sam was just happy for him, wide smile and all. And once again Dean compared him to a puppy wagging his tail.
-.X.-
“Mr. Crowley, Dean Winchester is here for his interview,” Sam gave him a small reassuring pat on his back before backing out into the kitchen.
Castiel suddenly realized this was the most he had ever texted anyone (at any one point in time). He wished the conversation wasn’t so stiff and informal, even if he didn’t know Dean it felt wrong. Well, not wrong, just not right. Looking down suddenly, Castiel realized he had yet to type more than two sentences in thirty minutes. ‘How did that happen?’ He continued to try and power through his essay, ignoring the buzzing of his phone in his lap. Having intended to focus solely on the computer in front of him, his eyes keep wandering back to his phone, begging him to read the text. Finally, Castiel gave in. “So, what do you want to talk about?”
“Sinner,” Castiel spit out. That had hurt like a throbbing wound with a knife stabbed into it. Or something equally as painful, probably more so. And worst of all Dean didn’t know why.
[Chapter 3]
“No,” the voice quivered, and to Dean’s surprise it wasn’t the same husky voice he had hear yesterday. This was far higher in pitch as well as far less carefree. “I’m sorry, who are you?”
Mary had been quietly moving around the kitchen until she heard the profanity leave her son’s mouth. She walked up behind Dean, leaning over the couch to say, “Watch your language,” before hitting the back of his head and leaving. Dean chuckled against Jimmy’s neck, having been knocked forward with his lips now on sensitive skin. Jimmy could easily debate that was no way Dean had gotten that close because of the light push alone but he wasn’t about to do anything with Sam blissfully ignorant to the current situation. He was too fixated on the screen.
-.X.-
Dean and Benny were walking towards the mess hall to have dinner when Dean caught site of what would be on the menu for tonight. They walked to the table where Garth, Ash, Jo, and Charlie were already picking at their food if you could even call it that.
“Castiel,” Michael presence loomed over him, making his wings quiver slightly at the raw power.
“I am not gay.” Castiel’s voice came out as a growl, hating how easily the other man could control his emotions. Sure, he considered Balthazar a friend but more often than not he seemed like a manipulator.
When the waitress brought the food they all start digging in, conversation dropped, all too busy with consuming the delicious food in front of them. It was almost the best thing he had ever put in his mouth. Definitely beat some things. It was still dull when compared to Mrs. Winchester food but he understood that she needed a break every once in a while. Jimmy didn’t get how Sammy could choose salad over the perfectly cooked fries.
Dean held him all the way through it, not saying a word just letting Jimmy cry and mumble out everything that was wrong. And when it was finally over and Cas was tucked under his chin, fast asleep, with puffy eyes Dean pulled out his phone to see 6 texts from Sam and 4 calls.
“Mrs. Winchester,--“ Jimmy started after the first bite of food hit his tongue. Perfectly cooked steak sat in front of him alongside mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was heavenly.
This was the third time Dean had enlisted to go to Afghanistan. The only difference to this departure was that this time Sam wasn’t here.
“The name’s Benny,” a Louisiana accent and outstretched hand greeted him as he walked into his room. It was small, with two bunk beds, two wardrobes and a desk squished into the tiny space.  He had been promoted to Corporal and he now had his own fireteam, he had yet to meet the new private but he assumed this was the same person.
Dean’s body automatically rose, his mind still steeped in sleep. His bunkmates were doing the same. His hands tucked in the sheets in practiced movements. He grabbed his shower tote and clothes for the day and made his way to the communal showers, many other people making the same walk.
The sound of the teakettle whistling derailed his train of thought. Jimmy didn’t remember going into the kitchen or filling the pot. He then poured the boiling liquid directly into his mother’s cup, the steam hitting his hand and burning it slightly. He barely felt it anyways.
That wasn’t the reaction Jimmy had expected at all.
-.X.-
He only eased up on the ride over to Jimmy’s house, “I’m sorry about what happened back there…I didn’t mean to make it-“
Jimmy was shocked. Dean wasn’t going to force him to talk about it? What kind of wonderful world was this? “Okay,” He paused, knowing there was something else he needed to say. Jimmy laid his hand on Dean’s before gently saying, “Thank you.”
“Don’t worry about it, get whatever.” Dean was excited to be the one to feed the hungry man. To get some food into him. Castiel looked up towards him as if to ask if it was really alright and Dean just nodded as a reassurance.
“Yes, I like it.” The darkness was gone from his tone this time; the words were light, airy, and completely carefree. Dean like this much better then the off-kilter tone from earlier, it fit Castiel much better.
“Are you okay?”
“Yes,” Winchester answered, face grim.
“Hello,” the boy’s voice was deep and it shocked Dean. He wasn’t normally one to judge but he hadn’t expected such a voice to come out of a body so small. The boy was probably around five foot six but he could tell by the skin showing at the top on his pants that he was rather skinny. His hips were protruding with his jeans resting on them and if Dean wanted to he could look in the gap between the clothes and his stomach. Truthfully, Dean was a little worried about how thin the other seemed to be…surely it couldn’t be healthy
Balthazar just chuckled and went back to his post, ignoring the death glare Castiel was shooting his way.  He decided to clear up the miscommunication with Dean by sending the man a quick message. “I’m sorry we have had a misunderstanding; my insufferable coworker sent you that first text while I was in the bathroom. And the sign from earlier was also him. I’m sorry but I’m not gay. Also, I am sorry that my way of texting is ‘odd.’”
“Dean…This is amazing.”
“How close are we to your house?” The neighborhood they were driving through now had rows and rows of regal looking houses, but they all were so similar that they seemed cold and uninviting. Dean couldn’t imagine the person he met who cover his face in flowers living in such a place. But then again it wasn’t really up to Castiel was it?
His uncle was now thrusting into him finally at full force, holding nothing back. No preparation, no warning. And bees…the way they keep flowers and plants alive, assuring the next generation or foliage while helping themselves.
Jimmy turned to look at Dean but the space between them was so small that there noses were almost touching. Dean blushed but Jimmy put his hand over his eyes when he saw the naked women posing behind Dean.
“It’s wonderful to meet you as well,” Mary was still holding on to his hand, looking back and forth between her oldest son and him.
For all of John Winchester’s faults, nobody could ever say he didn’t love his sons. After all his complaining and glaring he was now standing before Dean, sending his son off. Sure, he had been a little heartbroken when Dean had come to him saying he had enlisted and that it hadn’t been with the Marines, but he knew his son well enough to know he wasn’t a fish out of water.
Dean looked back at Cas realizing he was still holding his hand, he helped him out of bed and down the stairs, help meaning Dean made sure Cas didn’t get lost by holding his hand the whole way.
Castiel sat up and stared at him, head tilted, as he tried to figure out what to say. “Dean, my name is Castiel, and I have only meet you twice. Today and when we met on the hill. I am afraid he will not be pleased with me if I say more. Actually don’t tell him I have said anything; it’s for the better. But trust me when I say, I know he will come around.”
“Here’s my number.” Green eyes stared down at him, capturing his full attention, as he handed over a cup of black coffee.
John and Dean were tossing around the ball and Sam ran out to join them. Jimmy sat on the back porch and watched them all run around, John was the first to notice his absence. “Come on,” he waved Jimmy over. The only problem was he didn’t know how to play, so he shook his head so that they may continue. Mr. Winchester tossed the ball to his sons and jogged over to where Jimmy was sitting.
Sam grabbed both his own plate and Dean’s, rinsing them off in the sink and then placing them in the dishwasher before running upstairs after his big brother.
“Okay, so my mom is really nice but do as she says or else. Dad is…Sam what is dad like?” Dean looked at Sammy through the rear view mirror. Jimmy sat in the passenger’s seat, currently being informed about how to act around the Winchester parents.
“Umf good,” He mumbled out, food blocking proper pronunciation.
“Well, yeah. Kinda. I mean…I love you and they made you uncomfortable. And your reaction also made me realize how degrading it was to have them hanging around so yeah.” Dean was back to scratching at his neck again.
“You’re not hungry?” Dean asked as he placed his hand on a boney shoulder, but quickly removed it so as not to make Castiel uncomfortable.
Dean didn’t notice the divide at first, well not for what it was. When Monday rolled around Castiel had been tense, (of course he could tell the difference between Jimmy and Castiel but since the other had yet to protest he kept on with the nickname) he had assumed it had to do with the bruises. Dean had to seek out Cas so they could hang around during school and when the end of school rolled around he explained he was too busy. Dean was worried but he also noticed the way everyone acted once he got home, they were already used to him being around. And the coat hangers seem wrong without a trench coat there.
Dean stood once again saluting his father, which was returned but this time followed by, “at ease, corporal.” And for some reason he broke down just a little, posture wavering into a small slump of his shoulders.
The device in his hand went off again, pausing with one foot in his pajama bottoms he opened the message. “Oh. Ummm I’m picking up my brother.”
“Whatever you would like to talk about.”
This happened too often. Always broke Dean a little inside.  He had tried to hard to harden his heart. But he couldn’t. Couldn’t help but imagine every person he saw die as Sam.
Of course Jimmy had denied that like any good Christian would have done but then Sam said something that struck a chord in him. “Some of the best lies have just enough true mixed in with them to make them seem real. Like, Dean likes wearing women’s panties. I found a pair his size in his sock drawer.” Mary had of coursed shushed her son and then giggled, finding what Sam had said too funny to properly scold him. Jimmy found it hard to look Dean in the face when they walked out the back door.
They had cheesy little things on them that Jimmy had heard said around the hallways, most making fun of them.
“Shit…I see today we are having SOS,” Dean couldn’t even stop the groan that left his lips.
Just as his eyes started to close from the heaviness his cell started jumping on the wooden side table. He reached over trying to figure out what Dean wanted. “And Cas, just so you know. I know you’re not gay but if you are ever curious…consider me.” This stupid blush just wouldn’t leave him alone. Placing the phone back on his table he tried to go to sleep but now the thought was stuck in his mind.
“He skipped first through fourth period, how ungrateful can he be? I just don’t know what to do with him at this point. I mean, I have already started a prayer group for him at the church but he continues to lie. His brothers were never this bad. I am at my wits end.”
“When?” Had she missed the symbolic giving of the jacket? From the way Dean had ranted about the Impala when that was passed down she doubted she had missed it. Dean talked about that car nonstop for months after his sixteenth birthday. It had been adorable, and Dean had hated it when his mom said that out loud. The sound of the Impala pulling out of the drive-way signaled they were now speeding off to school.
“At a friend’s,” Jimmy’s gaze shifted down to his hands that rested limply in his lap. That tone…he was going to like this.
After finishing off her drink, he pulled out his phone and once again it was the same unknown number. This time the message read, “Haha you’re funny Cas, but seriously what are you up to?”
“Ah, Castiel, the names John,” Mr. Winchester stood up, hand out ready and waiting. Dean passed off Jimmy’s hand to his father. John’s shake was firm but far less aggressive then Mrs. Winchester’s, Jimmy was pretty sure if he thought about it for longer that would mean something.
And then once he felt like he had done enough research he watched all the documentaries he could find…or tried. Dean couldn’t watch it. It was too much for him to deal with. So he lay in his bed, staring up at the celling, making sure he wasn’t jumping to conclusion as he reanalyzed all his interactions with Castiel (Jimmy?) for the signs.
“Yeah, his name is Sammy. He goes to Rice. Ah, that reminds me are you a student?”
He served another three people while waiting for a reply, smiling lightly at the patrons. Balthazar stepped out of the back room signaling he was finished with his break, now here to ease up the work load. His friend stood at the register next to him, being cheeky with the young man on the other side of the counter. Castiel frowned at his partner’s flamboyancy; Balthazar too easily flirted with everyone.
Castiel looked at him with confusion as he said goodbye and got of the car.
“Yes, he is…easily frightened.” Apparently he had missed something extremely obvious. Like when you are looking for your keys and they are in your hand.
Sam and Dean came back to join them. But before anyone could do anything John declared, “Castiel is on my team.” Placing a hand on his claim. John did that a lot…place a comforting hand on people’s shoulders. It was almost a hug.
The results for that had made him slightly worried.
He gently placed the cup down on the table, but their conversation didn’t stop now that he was in their presence. In fact, it got louder. “I need a day off from this Met…”
He jumped out of bed, running to the restroom, hips aching with every single hurried step. Jimmy thrust the door open and throw open the lid of the toilet, bending down to hurl up everything in his stomach. Tears were streaming down his face and he could barely catch his breath between heaves, each one hurting more with the lack of volume to it. He found dry heaving was the worst. Jimmy wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, finally to regain some of his composer. He hated this.
“I am not gay, Balthazar. Why do you insist on doing such things?” Cas’ hand was now rested on his hip while waiting for an answer. He found himself hoping for Balthazar to give him some half-assed excuse so that he could blow up in the other’s face to let off some steam.
And for some unknown reason, this made Castiel smile his first ever smile. It was small, but still, it was a smile. Castiel watch Dean for the rest of the night. The man continued to do his job, keeping his head down the whole time. Dean would sometimes glance over to where Castiel was standing
Still slightly out of breath, while placing away his penis, Metatron laughed out, “I really like this one: are you religious? Cause you are the answer to all my prayers.” He left then, dropping the rest of what was in his hands, some of the papers landing in Castiel’s hair.
“If you call me that one more time I will shoot you.” There was no anger in her voice, Jo stated it like it was a fact.
“I don’t want to risk crashing my baby,” Cas’ eyebrows knitted together in confusion at the words ‘my baby’ but Dean continued on, it was now or never. “I wanted to ask you out.”
John paid for their meal and Sam rode back with his parents while Dean took him home.
Which reminded Jimmy, he was playing a video game. Dean had called it a button mashing game and now he knew why. There was a giant black figure on the screen; the island he had been on was now covered in sand. Jimmy wasn’t quite sure what was going on but he knew he had to defeat the dark mass.
Castiel laughed softly but the next words came out slightly softer then expected, “I’m trying to make friends with the bees.”
And that was when he felt like he had come across a life changing secret.
But he couldn’t help but regard his replacement with the utmost curiosity. Dean had only mentioned meeting someone new in passing, at the time it hadn’t seemed like his brother would be offering him a ride home. Though he had found it odd that Dean was giving up his second lunch for this guy but upon further interrogation Sam came to see the way Dean’s eyes would soft any time he tried to bring up the subject. And Dean told him to stop the mushy-girly stuff. He also knew Dean was completely unaware of the action. Very peculiar.
Sam started to speak when Dean finally got to the impala but Dean stopped him by asking him to just please open the car door. He gently placed Castiel into the front seat and buckled him up before getting in the car.
Utter befuddlement was the only way to describe what he felt right now. And the only word he could get to come out of his mouth was a strangled, “What?”
The waiter who had taken the bowls to the table came rushing in, grabbing the head chef by his shoulders, turning him around so that they were standing face to face. “Mrs. Mills is here,” he sounded breathless.
Dean was quiet, staring hard at him, and once again he thought back at the personality differences…there was something he needed to look up.
-.X.-
Jimmy moved to stand in front of the bookcase in the living room that was full of DVDs and VHS’ as well as the Winchester’s family game night collection. Just the massive amount of money they must have spent on entertainment things alone left Jimmy in awe. He barely recognized any of them, recognizing some of them from what he had heard in passing conversations.  But there was one set of movies that stood out to him, Harry Potter. Jimmy had heard raving reviews his whole life about both the movies and books. His curiosity in the series had always been that of a cat.
“Winchester. Blue and black, but hey I will talk to you later I have chores to do. Goodnight Cas.”
She pulled the covers off of him and he couldn’t suppress a shiver that almost caused him to fall out of bed. At least the sun had yet to rise which would leave his eyes burning. Fuck the sun had yet to rise. Who the hell would be here this early? Dean jumped out of bed, determined to yell at whoever had forced him to get up at this hour on a Saturday. He knew he was handsome but even he needed his beauty sleep.
Sam leaned to rest his arm on the back of Jimmy’s seat before saying, “Don’t worry, just be yourself.”
To bad he was already out of the Impala storming up porch with an older man holding the door open for him. The man stood by the door and watched as Dean pulled out of the driveway with a strange smirk in place the whole time.
“Mom, can we talk?”
Finally, Castiel opened one of the notes, seemingly pissed off by the abundance of little piece of papers now stuffing his pocket. Of course it had to be most embarrassing note he had sent so far. Dean dropped his head into his arms, trying to hide the oncoming humiliation.
Sadly, he lost. The main character was then warped into a whole new dimension, he could only assume, and then there was an odd character and its presents confused Jimmy to no end. “Dean, why is there a talking duck?”
Jimmy silently followed her orders.
“Cas?” Though to Dean non-high Castiel was much different then loopy Cas they had both asked the question in the same way. It was nice to know Dean hadn’t just made some crazy mistake...like in some bad high school movie with twins.
Castiel could remember the color of red hair blending into the green grass at their family home. His mother lying in the grass with him, holding his hand tightly, and the sound of his brothers playing in the background…it was his favorite memory. A sigh made its way passed his lips and he pulled a hand up to his eyes to try to rub away the scene.
“I’m sorry if it’s a little messy,” was all Dean said before Jimmy was exposed to the craziness that was Dean’s room. Jimmy momentarily wished he had had more of a warning. Posters covered the walls from floor to ceiling, papers littered the room, and there were cups on every available surface. The only part of the room that was neat was Dean’s bed, the pillows were organized and the blankets were free of wrinkles.
Not knowing how this person had got his number he replied quickly with a “Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.” Placing his phone away, assuming that was the end of that, he went back to work serving the next college student in front of him. But Castiel’s phone went off again; he ignored it assuming he would also get a “Sorry” in reply.
Though none of his brethren saw it that way. Angels don’t eat; don’t engage in the tangible excitement that came with experimenting with new and electrifying culinary combinations. Simplicity and complexity both having the ability to bring deliciousness, different but still the same. To angels eating was for lower beings, weak bodies having to constantly keep themselves from dying from starvation.
Jimmy folded up his own clothes before heading down the stairs to join the brothers just as the pizza arrived. The boxes were placed on the coffee table with care and Sam popped the movie into the DVD player. Dean automatically complained that he had already seen this one like a hundred times, and he looked at Cas as if expecting the same reaction.
Castiel found himself sitting in Jimmy’s bedroom again. He was only called here when the man was around. He stood up and pulled off all his clothes before getting on the bed with his knees tucked under his chest. Castiel pulled the pillow under his head, his arms at his sides…waiting. After many times he had found it was easier to just lay like a ragdoll and wait. It always went faster this way.
-. X. -
“Your father never taught you?” People where always confused when he told them he didn’t know how to do something his father should have taught him. Like shaving. When he started he cut himself constantly, now he just trimmed it keeping a constant five-o-clock shadow.
“Too late,” Dean yelled back as he grabbed the keys and rushed out the door, Sammy tailing him.
“Really, Balthazar? ‘Hey sexy, semicolon right parentheses. This is the cutie from the coffee shop, Castiel. Wanna bang?’ How many times do I have to change my phone password before you understand you are not allowed to use it? And how many times do I have to tell you I’m not gay before it sticks?” Castiel was so irritated he couldn’t even yell, his voice only coming out in harsh tones, not to mention the people sitting only feet away.
Dean apparently knew what was off, “I am not going to make you tell me, nor will I ever try...but, just know if you ever-
He already knew that he liked Cas; after all he was the first person he had properly asked out (because according to Sammy taking your booty calls out to new places to have sex wasn’t considered a date). And every time he had tried to relieve some tension at the end/beginning of a long day those impossibly blue eyes haunted him. Even if only to be implanted into busty Asian beauties. Soon after Dean started exploring porn with threesomes with two guys and then gradually evolving to just straight up (pun not intended) gay sex. He could see the appeal but it wasn’t really for him. Those blue eyes were defiantly his type. Though it was stupid to think of certain eyeballs as an absolute type.  Dean had gotten lost in the memory of how it all changed for him, the memories of how this person was what he wanted. And sweet deity did he want Castiel in anyway he could get him.
Castiel normally hated nicknames, but for some reason he didn’t mind ‘Cas’. Truly, anything other than Cassie would do just fine. But still, how had this person gotten his number?
“Hey Cas, what’s up?” Castiel ruffled his wet hair with a white towel, inhaling the smell of body wash that lingered on his skin. After a short pause, he pulled the towel across his skin and replied to Dean.
He waved his hand in a dismissive manner but none of the others saw, the room was already pitch black. “Nah, my old man was a jarhead. I think I broke his heart when I said I was enlisting in the military.”
John was the next to get up, kissing the top of her head before going to wash his own dish. She had them trained so well. Mary remembered when she first met John how dirty his apartment had been. Their house now was the most immaculately clean a house with three men could be.
“I’m going to miss you too, Sammy,” Dean clung to him just as strong. He was never one for hugs but he was about to leave home for fifteen months. Screw this being a chick flick moment.
[CHAPTER 2]
Castiel scrabbled around to find the small remote that connected to his speakers. Once he’d found it he pressed the play button, the rich sound of a viola filling the room. ‘Tchaikovsky really was a master.’  Finally, opening up his essay so that he could try to get a bit of it finished.
“Okay, baby…” Her first ounce of worry coming when Dean didn’t protest the pet name but that would not be the end of it.
She kissed the top of his head before saying, “What is her name?” Dean went tense, she had made a misstep somewhere… Oh. “What is his name?”
“No, don’t worry about it, it’s okay.” John soothed and then went back to eating, everyone following suit. He really was a big softie.
“Dean, I am going to have to warn you, if you really want to be with him you can’t just change your mind, and it’s going to be hard work. It may take years for you to ever be with him. Truly he might never be ready for that. The best thing you can do is to be his friend. I don’t want you to get hurt but in this case…I really need you to be a man. Please Dean if you care about this person, think about this carefully before you do anything.” Dean looked at her, with hurt in his eyes and she couldn’t help but feel horrible about what she said. But Mary Winchester knew it was necessary. She kissed Dean’s forehead and he sighed.
Jimmy’s Uncle chuckled, rubbing the back of his head before fondly patting Jimmy’s back. “He might be a troublemaker but he is still my nephew. And I owe you, you allowed me to stay in your lovely home when I was starting my business.”
“Sam, get up. Breakfast is ready.” Dean walked over to the window pulling back the curtain to let in the early morning light. Sam groaned from under the mess of blankets on his bed, throwing an arm over his squinting eyes. “Be down in five minutes or else you don’t get pancakes.”
Castiel’s Background:
“Soup of the day, Mr. Crowley.” Crowley slowly turned around to glare at Winchester. “She said she wishes to speak with the chef…” The waiter continued.
Suddenly Mrs. Novak had moved from her seat, rushing over to grab his chin tightly in her hand. There would be little dots of bruises around his face. She really did have a tight hold. Jimmy winced slightly, pulling back on reflex just to be held tighter. “They’re sinners Jimmy…Maybe you do belong with them.” His mother pushed his face away harshly, as if almost a slap. “Go to your room.”
They sat and watched the sun go up, pink, orange, and red dusting the sky. They were silent and everything was nice, the smell of freshly cut grass wafting from somewhere down the street. Dean didn’t want to say anything, he already had too much on his mind and he didn’t want to add to the pile of questions he now had.  And when Castiel didn’t refuse his offer to drive him home. Dean did. And on his way back he couldn’t help the flood of worry that assaulted him as he drove away.
“Don’t talk with food in your mouth.” Dean scolded while shaking a spatula at the other.
Dean was slightly nervous about the nickname he had chosen for this complete stranger. Had he over stepped his bounds? Was there something wrong with giving someone a nickname? Dean had never thought so. “Yeah, a nickname, is that okay?”
Jimmy’s neck started to go stiff because of the angle the couch was at in relation to the television. He turned to Dean, asking him to pause the movie. He did so with a raised eyebrow. “Dean, my neck hurts…” Jimmy hated to seem whiny but it hurt so badly it felt as if his neck would snap in two.
The game started with interesting music as well as opening screen. Jimmy was immediately enamored with the game, from the look of the character design to the unfolding backstory. When he finally got a hold of his character Dean reached around him and placed his hands on top of Jimmy’s. He then guided his fingers on the controls, teaching him what each ones did and telling him the ones he would never use. It was exceedingly hard for him to concentrate on anything Dean was saying but somehow he pulled it off. The game started off with trivial tasks, only asked of the player so they can get comfortable with the game, which Jimmy did with the ease and precision of a seasoned veteran. At least that what’s what Dean had said, Sam was too busy trying to backseat game by telling him where to go, who to talk to, and what to grab. Dean finally got fed up with his brother, “Shut the fuck up, he is playing.”
“You’re not going to join us?” Jimmy admired how gruff but kind the voice was. He hated to disappoint the older man but…he didn’t want to embarrass himself.
Jimmy sat and then slowly dropped down into the covers, staring at the ceiling covered in posters. He hadn’t really paid any attention to the wall coverings before…many of them had cars, and some with bands that he didn’t know but quite a few of them where of scantily clad, or naked women.  His face went beet red and Jimmy closed his eyes tightly, he felt really uneasy with the posters.
“I made soup, Sammy,” his reply was quiet, still looking over to where Castiel was standing. Sam went to the soup to try it, smiling at the taste.
The man leaned in, grabbing the utensil and letting the spoon pass his lips, tongue poking out to meet it. A moan erupted from the man; shoulders going slack, and his head lolling to one side. Another man came rushing over, soul sour, grabbing the beautiful soul and started screaming at him. “How dare you? What do you think this is? We are a fine restaurant and we aren’t here to serve our customers your germs!” Which didn’t make much sense since the beautiful soul had the same amount of germs as any of the others in the kitchen. They were also, for the most part, unavoidable.
His brother perked up, body shooting up from the mountain of covers. “Pancakes?” Dean loved that wide-eyed look Sam got whenever real food was offered to him this early. It wasn’t often Dean found the time to make a hot breakfast. Normally a piece of toast and a bowl of cereal was all they had to eat ‘til lunch.
Mrs. Winchester taught him how to fully cook spaghetti with meat sauce. She let him do everything, just instructing him and asking him what else he wanted to put in it. She didn’t even argue when he wished to put wine and shredded carrots into it. Though the carrots had been more of a test to see how far he could push it, Mary had just smiled and said it was an amazing idea since her boys could always use more veggies. Dean watched the whole thing from the table silently. And when dinner was done Jimmy brought the food to the table, excited to see what everyone thought of his cooking.
“That’s the point.”
So he stayed, signed up again. He loved everyone he had met, and what they do for the most part. But the heartbreaking part was being on the front lines, never knowing who was going to die.
Mary pulled the lids off the pots, there was rice, green beans and some kind of stew. She served herself and then motioned for Jimmy to go. He hadn’t realized how hungry he was ‘til the intoxicating smell hit him. He shyly heaped rice onto his plate, making a large dip in the middle like Mrs. Winchester had. Jimmy then scooped the stew up and placed it in the rice, he then moved on to the green beans taking a nice serving.
As his parents were out the door and down the street, Sam grabbed the phone and dialed a pizza place, ordering pepperoni for all of them. Jimmy remembered a few times where Gabriel had snuck pizza into the house when mother was out…those were some good memories. His mother’s eating schedule was set in stone. It was the same thing every week, salad, plain pasta and salad, sandwiches and fruit salad, fish, rice and meat, casserole, and then more salad. All those things by the age of ten tasted like ash in his mouth.  Pizza was a welcome change, though he’d much rather have Mrs. Winchester’s cooking.
A week had passed by and Dean had thought and thought and thought about everything Castiel did. He analyzed every little thing. Probably too much for his own good. Dean was pretty sure he was driving himself mad. So he had decided that today was the day to act.
Before Jimmy could say anything Mrs. Winchester cut in and said, “Onions.” Dean made a little hum of recognition and went to sit down.
“So, what’s his name?” Sam asked with an audible smirk, Dean didn’t even bother looking to confirm his assumption.
Dean turned off the car, officially shutting off the music. Jimmy wasn’t sure how he felt about it at this time. It had been loud and caused his heart to race but he felt like it could grow on him with time. Maybe he only thought that because Dean had so fondly sang along and Jimmy wanted to be able to join in the merriment.
Dean let out an exasperated sigh and said, “Fine, I’ll take Sammy.” Mr. Winchester chuckled while Sam did his ‘bitch face’ as Dean would call it. Jimmy loved how the three bantered, but he loved it more when he was part of it.
It was miserable to sit and watch the food being made but never knowing the taste of it. Having to judge it by how the people consuming it reacted and unfortunately for him, sometimes humans were hard to read.
“It’s okay,” Jimmy cut of Dean, really he had nothing to be sorry, he was so honest and Jimmy kept many things from him.
Dean put on music and they sat quietly listening to it, sometimes joining in. Dean even let Jimmy show him some classical music, and he seemed to like it as far as Jimmy could tell. And then he noticed something that he hadn’t realized ‘til now. All the pictures of women were gone from Dean’s room, replaced with more cars and bands. There was no way he could not inquire about it, “So what happened to…” Jimmy waved his hand around at the walls.
Finally Dean spoke up, “Mom, I found someone who I want to be with…”
He had already taken a flight a few weeks ago to head to Stanford. This time Dean had to watch his brother leave, had to feel that aching need to just reach out and say don’t go. But Dean wanted him to be able to go out and follow his dream so he just waved him off saying, “don’t let me catch you around these parts anytime soon.”
Before Dean could finish Jimmy cut him off, shocked by what the other had said, “You removed them for me?”
, played a video game?” Dean looked at him with complete and utter disbelief. Jimmy hadn’t meant to offend Dean when he said he had never played C.O.D. and then when Dean asked what games he did play Jimmy had made the mistake of saying ‘monopoly?’ It had caused Dean to start gaping like a goldfish. It had also made his right eye squint in the oddest of ways but Jimmy thought it best not to bring it up.
Sam frowned a little, “I already knew about that. That was our deal for the interview. You can put your clothes in my locker, okay?”
“No, I’m actually 25. My family are all devout Christians but I’m a Theist.” Well, he wasn’t sure if Gabriel was religious, actually he was pretty sure he wasn’t and he was pretty sure Lucifer wasn’t as well.  Neither seemed the type. Though Lucifer might only do it as a play on his name. Really, what had his parents been thinking.
“Come on, boys. Let’s go out to eat,” Mary chimed as John helped her put on her jacket, while trying to force his feet into his boots.
“How’s school Sammy?” Sam was always so busy with school-work, he was really worried about his brother at times. Dean wanted to make sure he didn’t push himself too hard. Dean’s only job in life at this point was to make sure Sam stayed healthy and happy, everything else took the back seat.
“What’s with the twenty questions? My favorite kind of coffee is Café au lait.”
“Dean, dishes.”
When he finally got the throw down, John taught him how to catch the ball, which was far easier. Dean was smiling at him and Jimmy felt so proud of his accomplishment it was almost sinful. Dean did that often…smile at all the new things Jimmy learned. It was stressful but nice.
‘Do you have a map? I just keep on getting lost in your eyes.’
“Come on, let me drive you home.” Dean pleaded, finally resorting to begging after the tenth rejection. “Please, Cas.”
“The boy from earlier?” She wished she‘d gotten a better look at him when she had followed John to the door this morning. All Mary could remember was dark hair and a trench coat.
Sam offered to let Cas borrow his copies but he begrudgingly declined. He explained that if his family was to find the innocent book he couldn’t even imagine the trouble to come. This worried Dean…why would a book; even if had magic, get him in trouble? Really, weren’t Moses’ miracles basically magic? It was silly.
-.X.-
“Look at how well I have taught you. Jerk me off.” He unfolded another piece of paper, bringing it up to his face before looking back down at Cas, waiting for him to continue. Castiel reached up, pulling out a semi limp cock. “Can you touch me so I can tell my friends I’ve been touched by an angel? Ha, how charming.”
Dean led them up the stairs, having said in the car that he had wanted to talk alone. Sammy was quiet the whole ride. Jimmy was pretty sure this was going to be about the incident yesterday. But Jimmy was just thankful that Dean had gotten peeved when he didn’t automatically start following him to the Impala. Truly Dean had looked outraged and slightly hurt, he had felt bad about it.
“And?” Dean watched as Sam’s eyebrow lifted in a nonchalant kind of way. Sam sighed; reading the weariness his brother was feeling to a tee. “Dean, I don’t care as long as you’re happy and not hurting yourself and others. Don’t you know that by now?”
Ending:
“Religion. I hope you don’t mind me asking but how old are you?” He was a little unsure about asking but he craved the answer. Castiel ran a hand down his face trying to get his mind to stop wanting insane things, trying to focus on anything other than his curiosities. But the feeling of excitement that came when his phone buzzed was too much to ignore.
“Cool, so Cas, what’s with the flowers?” He thought it was adorable how he had covered almost every inch of his face with bright yellow flowers. The only part of his face that Dean could see was a sharp jaw covered in light stubble, and the tip of a perfect nose.
She had cornered him as soon as he walked into the house on Friday night, calling him into the living room in a way that Jimmy knew could only mean his immediate doom.  Mrs. Novak was sitting, as ridged as a board, on the couch while motioning for him to sit down across from him. Jimmy took the seat, unable to let his posture relax, the leer directed at him made a shiver run down his spin. Whatever she had to say he knew was going to be unpleasant.
Dean sighed, “Yeah, I know...”
Dean just slid the Tabasco sauce over to Benny before digging in. But Private Laffite just fixed him with an unwavering stare. “All it’s going to taste like is Tabasco sauce with that much on it Dean.”
A grey cloud seemed to reside over his once happy childhood home, it just seemed dark from the outside. Something seemed off about the residence. As if all the horrid deeds done in the seemingly perfect house had soaked into the very wood that kept it together. What had started out as a bright pine over time had been soaked with all the screaming, blood, and tears, turning it to dark rosewood.
Dean led him into the living room, Sam following closely after his own bout of shock. Really, they could be so odd. Dean went and turned on one of the black boxes sitting in front of the T.V. and then popped a disk in. He came back with a controller. Dean sat down on the couch and patted the space between his legs. Jimmy gave him a questioning look. “I’m going to teach you how to play.” Obviously Dean didn’t see anything wrong with the situation. So Jimmy sat down on the edge of the couch, nested in between Dean’s legs.
Castiel stopped glaring and just looked up at Metatron, mouth still hanging open.
“I want to get to know you. Mine is strong black coffee after waking up with a hangover.” Castiel had forgotten to ask the question in return but leave it to Dean to do it for him.  But he wondered why Dean had been so completely honest with him. It wasn’t like he had to inform him about the alcohol to tell him his favorite drink, it seemed a bit odd…but at the same time it was rather sweet. ‘Sweet?’
Jimmy stepped through the entryway and slowly walked up the stairs, wishing for nothing more than to run up the stairs but also not wanting to cause any sort of commotion to upset his mother. She had developed the tendency to yell. Jimmy could remember a time when both his brother and father were still around…mother had smiled then. It had been a long time since he had thought about them. Jimmy had been close at one point with Gabriel but he had pulled back once the abuse started.  It wasn’t until his brother left home to attend college did Cas tell his mother. Somewhere in his mind he was afraid if he told his mother Gabriel would end up hurt.
Mary and John walked through the front door, laughing themselves into nearly falling to the floor. Something about oranges. Dean looked at the clock on the DVR, seeing it was far later than the normal time he would have taken Castiel home by. Cas also seemed to notice, quickly thanking Sam for the offer before following Dean up the stairs to change. He quickly started to pull off his clothes, not bothered with Dean standing in the room.
He started his research then, looking up what was wrong with himself and consulting Dr. Web MD. It wasn’t long until he found the section on MPD/DID and suddenly it all made sense. The lost time and the aching of his body in odd places as well as all the bruises. Luckily, even if his mother now hated him, he knew who was hurting him. Not that he could do anything about it…but at least he knew and now could treat his uncle as he deserved to be treated. Well, that had been his plan. The next time he was alone with Metatron a voice whispered to him, demanding for him to let go, and Jimmy couldn’t stop himself from giving in. Maybe it was because he was not ready to truly face the complete extent of what was happening and Castiel was so much stronger than him...far more broken, but most defiantly stronger.  The next time Jimmy ‘woke up’ he was in a sweat soaked bed, all alone, and covered in a sticky liquid that was not his own- which Jimmy had always thought it to be ‘til then. That was when Castiel started changing the sheets and cleaning off the body before releasing his hold.
Castiel smiled back at him and then dug into his food, eating with better manners than Dean had ever expected from anyone of his age. He chewed with his mouth closed and he waited to swallow his food before he answered any questions that were thrown his way. Castiel didn’t put his elbows on the table and he even didn’t cuss. It was all very grown up, and it seemed odd around his normal group of friends. Ash was in a heated discussion with Benny about anarchism, a normal topic between the two, and Jo and Charlie were chitchatting about Charlie’s new crush. But as soon as Castiel figured out Charlie was a lesbian he tensed up next to Dean. He glared down at his food, knuckles turning white around his plastic fork. Dean wasn’t to keen on the fact that it seemed like Castiel was a homophobe, but he was immensely glad the man had yet to voice his opinion.
Bees were such a beautifully simple creatures. The way they buzz about never having to worry about anything. Just pollinating flowers and then going back to the hive to make honey. Taking care of the larva and protecting their queen.
-.X.-
[CHAPTER 2]
Castiel began to rub whatever was in his hand, his mind already far away…only coming to the present when his uncle read another note. Those nice words that Dean said from such a distasteful mouth…completely disgusting.
“So you’re a military brat?” They were lying in their beds talking about their lives again. Benny leaned over the top railing of his bunk to look down at Dean.
“What did you serve her?” The question was pushed out between clenched teeth.
Sam rubbed the side of his face, eyebrows knitted together in thought. “Um, he might seem serious but he is really just a big softie. Really, if he looks angry he isn’t, well at least for the most part.” Jimmy could deal with angry.
“Where have you been?” Mother’s tone hadn’t been this sharp in months…when he had been too sick to go to church. That hadn’t been pleasant. She had slapped him for telling her no. Jimmy learned that lesson the hard way.
“I would like that.” He didn’t know why he said that. Castiel didn’t know this person; all he knew was that his name was Dean and that he liked men.
Castiel let out a huff, he quickly looked in his outbox, scrolling down to the first message to the number. He was shocked to see such a message, but once again he knows immediately who was responsible to this. He turned his head to glare at Balthazar but found the man was far too close to him for comfort, currently grinning like a beast.
“It’s your fault! You are a sinner and you are bringing me down! Mother was right for telling me to get away from you. You make me do bad things. It’s your fault.”
“He’s a friend, nothing more.” Jimmy glared, trying to stand his ground but as soon as his uncle started to pull down the zipper of his pants, as he reached for more notes, Castiel begged him to leave. It was weird but he could hear a whole other voice in his head demanding he leave. And of course like the scared little kid he was he ran and hid in deepest recess of his mind.
“Don’t you remember? You texted me, this is Dean from this morning. By the way you text oddly.”
“Goodnight, Dean.”  Castiel put his phone on his nightstand, thinking over all the things they had discussed. He considered the man he had just only met. Then he pulled his covers up over his cheeks. His face felt slightly warm, and Castiel thought about getting up and checking his temperature but he doubted he had a fever.
Mary scoffed, drinking the last few drops of her coffee before cleaning up the mess left in the kitchen.
“I have two jobs, one as a financial adviser and on weekends I work at a car garage. What’s your favorite color?”
Castiel eased out of bed, going over to his door to close it, ejaculation dripping down his thighs with every step. Then he slowly swayed over to his en suite bathroom, the pain in his back only slowing him down slightly. He knew well enough to lock the door so that there would be no round two. He automatically turned the water on scalding hot, stepping in so that he could feel the cold before heat. Castiel squatted down, having found that it was the best position to get rid of any left over reminisce of what his uncle had done.
Dean made his way back to his bunk, everyone else was eating lunch but Dean wasn’t feeling it after the patrol they went on today. There had been a mother crying for their help and Dean had tried his best to save her son but it was too late. He was gone by the time they arrived at her home, he had been stabbed and had lost too much blood.
Her eyebrows knitted together momentarily think over the name but no recognition came with the name, soon she was squinting angrily.  “There are no Winchesters in the church…”
The longer he was in the army the longer he wanted out. He wanted to stop seeing all the pain and suffering. Wanted to be able to close his eyes to it like most of the people back home did. They thought they knew how bad it was but they never did. Dean honestly hadn’t known what he was getting into until he arrived in Afghanistan; he had had idealistic, childish, thoughts of serving his country.
‘Go to sleep, let me take the wheel,’ that voice talking to him two times in one day was always a bad sign. But like always it was easier for him to just give into it. That way at least he didn’t have to deal with what came next. What always came when that sweet enticing voice came, much huskier than his own. He let himself slip down, into the dark secluded corner of his mind that nothing was allowed to touch but himself. Where he kept his most private of thoughts along with his true feelings. He closed to his eyes and floated off.
Walking over to the dresser with the damp towel around his neck and phone in hand, Castiel pulled on a pair of fresh boxers, loving the feel of silk against skin. Once they were settled on his hips he let out a content sigh.
Mary smiled and John rolled his eyes but, not to his surprise, Sam had to ruin it by opening his big fat mouth and saying, “But somebody has to go…” Stupid Sammy.
There was no proven cause of it but the theory had made him sick to his stomach. The only reason he did hurl right then and there was because his curiosity wouldn’t allow him to move away from the computer screen.
“I have no clue what you are talking about,” Dean hated to admit it. Really to have missed something he should have seen but he didn’t, he felt like a blind man.
Kevin pulled a small bag from under the counter motioning for Dean to pull a letter out. He pulled out a plain envelope with neat handwriting and a P.O. Box address. This would do.
[CHAPTER 4]
“It can’t be that bad.” Poor, naïve, Benny.
“Boys let’s play some football,” John called to them on his way out of the back door. Jimmy found it weird that he didn’t feel uncomfortable around Mr. Winchester. Normally he was skittish around men especially when they were older. Not that John was old. But the way he looked at his wife and the way he treated sons, himself included, eased his worries. Dean and Sam had obviously been taught how to be so polite and caring by their parents. It helped that John never leered or glared at him, he would just smile fondly. Mary had told Jimmy it had to do with not being the shortest man in the home anymore. Jimmy took it in stride.
Handing over the last pan, then wiping his hands on a dishrag, not wanting to get his suit pants wet, Dean finally figured out his own answer. “I don’t know, he said he’s not gay.” As he rolled down his sleeves he let out a long sigh, thinking back to what Castiel had said. When Dean had first seen the sign in the coffee shop he had frowned at it, thinking the person who wrote it had been rather foolish. Since they lived in Texas being gay was a rather touchy subject. However, he was hit with the realization that the moment when he saw that sign was the moment he’d become interested in the barista inside, and so he couldn’t help but silently thank the idiot that scrawled that tasteless sign.
“Corporal Dean Winchester,” Dean grasped the hand putting just enough bite into the shake. He was still riding a high of being promoted and no longer being the bottom of the totem pole. But he had chosen to still sleep with his team, so here he was.
“Cas: a shortening of the name Castiel, a nickname. Are you mad at me or something?”
Balthazar’s smirk was sickening, stretching fully across his face. “Cassie baby, ease up. It wasn’t for you; it was for me. Not that I’m saying that you don’t need to get laid, because you do…big time. And I am guessing by your blush a hot piece of ass just gave you his number. So tell me about him,” he continued to smirk and pulled a hand under his chin, looking intrigued by his new conclusion.
Jimmy quickly regretted this decision. The last thing he had wanted was to fail to get home before curfew but now that was the farthest thing from his mind. Dean was staring down at his legs, eyebrows knitted together tightly in the most worried sort of way. He couldn’t even blame Dean. Jimmy knew what the other saw there. All the bruises that covered the lower half of his body…all different colors and sizes. And the red rawness that stained his milky knees that could only ever truly mean one thing, unless one was to spend hours scrubbing the floor. But really who ever did that? It was too late to go back, he pulled off Dean’s shirt, more bruises coming into view with every inch. The large bite mark around his nipple and the hand shaped bruise that wrapped around the top of his arm was probably the worst of it. One from his mother, and the other from his uncle. He wouldn’t have been surprised at Dean if he were to throw up any second.
He walked down the stairs, still in his boxers and an undershirt. Dean pulled his jacket on before walking out the front door.  To Dean’s surprise Castiel was laying in the grass, in his usual wear, hands folded behind his head. Dean couldn’t help the way his anger suddenly drained from his body, being replaced by a small smile.
He continued to watch the older lady in front of her stove, “Michael.”
“I just got out of the shower. And what about you?”
“It’s Castiel to you. He’s interesting…he’s a religion major and he works at ‘Permanent Addiction’ but honestly, I don’t know anything else about him.” Dean pulled out his phone, texting Cas a quick “Good morning” before going back to watching his brother.
“Dean, I have to tell you something…” his hands were nervously rubbing up and down his pant-clad legs.
Castiel looked down at the food, blushing slightly with one hand on his stomach. “I forgot my lunch money…”
Dean could feel the nervousness rolling in waves off of Cas, he had tried to keep it light with Sam around but now that his brother was gone he felt the need to clear the air. “Which way is your house?”
“I don’t want to either,” Jimmy sighed and started to turn away but Dean grabbed his wrist automatically easing up on his hold.
“You’re an amazing cook.” Jimmy praised as he cut another piece of steak before humming while he chewed. He could feel Dean watching him, they were sitting so close and Jimmy knew all of the Winchesters had realized this closeness but none of them commented. It made Jimmy feel better to not see them judge his growing dependency on being close to Dean. He wasn’t sure how it had started, probably from the first time they were at lunch together, but now Jimmy found himself completely relaxed with almost all of his guards down around him. They sat with their legs joining at their inside knees all the way down to their feet. And every once in a while Dean would put part of his foot on top of Jimmy’s. Jimmy was thankful for the thin socks that they both wore, it just seemed like touching bare feet was extremely intimate.  He blushed for even thinking about it to this extent.
This hadn’t happened since last year right before school let out. Some of the idiotic jocks on the football team had taken upon themselves, like god himself had given the order, to decimate the inside of his locker. And it wasn’t because they hated him. No, they couldn’t. He had never spoken to them let alone done anything to piss of them off. It wasn’t like Jimmy was poking them with a stick through the bars of their cage.
John shooed his boys, making them go sit down on the porch to watch. He took Jimmy out into the middle of the yard, holding the football in his hand showing Jimmy how to do it. John handed it over and then corrected Jimmy’s fingers to make sure he was doing it right. He then took the ball back and explained how to throw it. It seemed easy enough. So he tried and failed. John reassuring him the whole time while telling him about how bad Sam had been at first, apparently they had to fix two of the neighbor’s windows.
Castiel yearned for nothing more than to taste what humans tasted, and more often than not took it for granted.
“Castiel,” the name rolled right off the tip of his tongue. He wanted to moan it for the barista; Dean’s face turned a bright red. ‘Where the fuck did that come from?’ Sam chose to completely ignore the change in his brother’s demeanor.
brother, is Castiel,” Dean knew the little smirk he had in place forgave calling Sammy ‘dear.’ Sam’s eye twitched in the most pleasing way. Dean worked hard to get that look directed at him.  “And Cas this is my little baby brother Sammy.”
“So does this make me Forrest Gump?”
The man currently standing in front of Castiel placed both the money to pay for his coffee and a small folded piece of paper into his palm, fingers lingering longer than appropriate. His head tilted in confusion, not understanding why the other had just said this.
Jimmy blushed. Mary thought the name he chose for himself was ‘gorgeous.’ For once he liked the name he had subconsciously chosen. The only reason that he went by Castiel all the time was because of times like when he and Dean first met. Castiel was stubborn when it came to being called that. He would get extremely upset when anyone called him Jimmy. And Jimmy felt as if he owed Castiel at least that much, after all the things his other did for him, he owed him at least a name. But to now hear that someone really liked the name, and that it wasn’t odd or weird, he liked being called it. It wasn’t annoying.
Jimmy was handed an apron and a knife and pointed in the direction of a cutting board with two onions sitting on it. He steadied his hand and chopped the first one in half. Apparently he had done something wrong, and he couldn’t help the arm that came up to protect his face when Mrs. Winchester came rushing up to his side from refrigerator.
He quickly replied back,
Dean wasn’t about to take this laying down. He sent another note and it was met with the same reaction. It pissed him off that Castiel refused to open the notes. But he continued on with his quest.
“Of course, honey.”
The man freaked, starting cursing under his breath, hurrying to try and figure out what to do. Castiel had to help him.
“About?” Jimmy knew there was something off with his own voice but he couldn’t do anything about it.
“Dean’s taking a shower, he suggested I come help you with dinner.”
He immediately regretted when he saw Cas’ smile fall, a look of utter confusion on his face. Dean wanted to hug him and say that he was only joking and that he was so sorry for being so horrible. Then in the most pitiful voice Dean had ever heard Castiel questioned, “Did I do something wrong?”
Dean’s fingers started to card through his hair, but when Mr. Winchester mumbled out, “If it’s what makes you happy,” Dean jumped up like lightening then pulled Jimmy up next to him.
Honestly, Dean was mad for a few seconds but then he couldn’t help laughing at how guilty Cas looked. So innocent. “Don’t ever change, Castiel.”
“I’m sorry…” If Cas need to let out his anger Dean would take it.
Jimmy skipped out on breakfast, the thought of eating food at the moment being completely unthinkable. He wanted to hurl at the smell of toast coming from the kitchen as he snuck by and out the back door. But most of all he didn’t want to see the hate and disappointment in his mother’s eyes. It was always there. He gently closed the door then schooled his face so the pain wouldn’t show, not that anyone would ask if they ever saw it.
“I came here to watch the sunrise with you. I should go.”
“Are you texting him?”
Castiel could watch this process all day, all year, for all of eternity. The combinations were endless, ever-changing but the principle tastes always staying the same. Savory, sweet, salty, sour, spicy. The most exciting thing Castiel every experienced was the beginning of the world’s communities co-mingling. To see how the new fusion cuisines began to pop up. Watching people experience exotic food from far away lands for the first time, the wonderful surprise or extreme disdain of the unknown locking onto their face.
“It’s Sam and I’m almost taller then you.” Sam jumped from the hood of the car, standing up board straight. But unfortunately for him still had a few inches between himself and his older brother.
Jimmy finished off his pieces in time for the beginning logo, he hand stilled on the way to pull out another piece but the intro had him enchanted. Every second that went by, revealing the story little by little, left him wanting more. How had he missed this not been part of his childhood? Why had his parents kept him from his? Only one answer came to his mind: Pure evil.
Story:
The sensory art that was cooking completely depended on a delicate balance. Every part of it was important, the smell, the taste, the texture, the presentation, even down to the background noises…crackling bread, sizzling food, the crunch of fresh vegetables. All were parts of a grand design
“For whom the bell tolls! Time marches on! For whom the bell tolls!”  They had apparently formed some kind of singing trio. All of them singing shamelessly loud, playing air instruments and waving their arms around at weird intervals. Jimmy had learned to enjoy the musical stylings of Metallica, AC/DC, Queen and Kansas, as well as many others he had yet to learn the names for. As soon as the song was over they jumped out of the car, laughing and still playing “sick” air riffs. At first Jimmy had thought they needed a doctor, he had never really understood that term.
If there was one thing he was sure of it was the he wasn’t ready to forget about the Winchesters.
They hugged, as awkward as ever. So much had changed, but two things remained constant, his father’s inability to give relaxed hugs and his disdain for flying.
“I think they are far better than the movies. There’s just so much more to them, though the movies are a great representation.” Sam chewed at his thumb.
“You married me.” He smiled at his wife fondly, nothing but happiness on his face.  He was so lucky. John had met the women of his dreams and quickly married her. And then they had two beautiful sons. It was what he had always wanted.
John was next to make his way down the stairs, wearing only boxers as well, then plopping down at the breakfast table just as she placed his omelet in front of him. They really did all have impeccable timing. John joined in with Sam’s hums of delight with the taste of the food. “Amazing as always, dear,” John praised as Dean finally appeared in the doorway, also in his boxers. Really, she didn’t understand how they ever had company over. Dean moved over to the fridge, pulling out orange juice and pouring himself and Sam a glass before fixing two cups of coffee and placing them in front of their respective places. John quickly thanked Dean for the cup of straight black coffee and continued eating. Mary always loved spending her mornings like this, all her boys quiet and content. No fighting…just the sound of chewing. But of course Dean had to reach over to Sammy’s plate to steal a bite, too impatient to wait the ten seconds it would take for him to get his plate. She closed her eyes tightly and waited for the inevitable screaming to ensue.
‘If I was ever curious would I consider Dean? He seemed like a nice enough guy.’ Castiel knew he wasn’t straight but he didn’t think he was gay either. Honestly, he had never met anyone who he could be with, physically or mentally. Even though Castiel saw the beauty in others, he had never felt a pull to another human being. Because of this he would always deny being gay; he wasn’t, but he wouldn’t say he was straight either. Castiel simply allowed people to come to their own conclusion, though most of them were wrong. He closed his eyes, hoping for sleep but green eyes haunted his sweet dreams for the rest of the night. Always silently smiling at him.
‘I must be lost. I thought paradise was further south.’
“How’s your table tennis?” They both broke out into laughter, before settling and waiting for their other two roommates.
He pulled into the correct driveway, leaving the engine on, before answering the question. “I wanted to have the car in park when I talked to you.”
His mother was out shopping when he got back, he had done a pretty good job avoiding her as of late.  Unfortunately, she didn’t like leaving the house unattended so she often left Metatron in charge. And his uncle was extremely harsh that evening, if what he woke up to was any indication.
[Chapter 1]
“Okay Sam, let’s get going,” Dean yelled as he finished wolfing down his breakfast, then running upstairs to take a quick shower.
Jimmy wanted to scream at the asshole who was sending him all these notes. He didn’t even bother opening them since he already knew what they were. It had been a long time since anyone decided he was the person to pick on.
He had finally lost himself in the thoughts and when the train of thought ran out of fuel there was already ejaculation flying towards his face. Castiel held his breath and closed his eyes, already knowing how much that would hurt.
Dean turned to leave, smirking slightly at the childishness of the reaction. “Yeah, blueberry.” Dean smiled softly then, chuckling at the sound of feet heavily hitting the wooden floor. Closing the door on the way out to give the other some privacy, Dean moved into the kitchenette. The whole apartment smelled of delicious pancakes, he placed the stack he had already made at the seat Sam was currently sitting down in, then going back to cooking his own stack. Sam hummed in the background with every bite. Dean had learned at an early age how to make pleasing food since Sammy had been a ‘little bitch’ and complained after weeks of living off of ramen and cereal.
“No, no…Cas, I’m sorry. Don’t worry about it.” Dean placed a large hand on Castiel’s shoulder, squeezing lightly, to try and show that in some form he had regretted his words.
“Yes, sir,” Dean was lucky his father had ingrained that response. Never before had he been glad for his rigorous marine upbringing but he was pretty sure it just saved him a shit ton of problems.
During war:
Jimmy was the first inside, quickly pulling of his coat and shoes before yelling out through the house, “Mom, we’re home!” The words left his mouth before he could realize what they were.
God is gone now though, Michael was in charge and he began trying to rein things in, run everything like a battleship. Order. He had recently decided to pick up the slack, starting with Castiel.
Benny shrugged and covered his plate with red.
“Sorry, okay,” it was physically hard to slow down his consumption but the last thing he wanted to do was ‘give back’ this amazing food. So, he went slowly, chewing each bite completely and when he was done with all the food on his plate he got seconds. And then thirds. He thought momentarily of fourths but Mrs. Winchester brought a pie to the table. Which he found to be completely amazing.
Dean had such a nice mouth…plump pink lips. And freckles that covered his nose and cheeks. Cas liked that. Jimmy would too if he wasn’t so scared of people, Castiel just knew it. He wished he could have more time with Dean instead of just blurred memories of the man through Jimmy. Castiel could talk about the bees with Dean, though he did seem more like a dog man. Dogs were nice, loyal, and excitable. Yeah, Dean was a dog man.
Dean’s father patted Castiel’s back and his mom gave him a big, suffocating squeeze on their way out, but not before providing him with more leftovers. He started up his baby, watching Cas out of the corner of his eyes. He was growing more comfortable with being in Dean’s car, he was now relaxed, resting his cheek against the window. He had even started tapping the beat to tunes he recognized, which of course made Dean pleased with himself. Their rides were always silent but Cas broke this tradition as Dean pulled into his neighborhood.
“It’s always nice to have an extra hand around the kitchen.”
Dean was then calling him from the top of the stairs; Jimmy pulled out the first movie and rested it on the coffee table before jogging up the steps. He was waiting for him in his bedroom doorway, waving Jimmy in. “Here,” Dean grunted as he thrust a pile of clothes into Jimmy’s waiting arms. “I thought you might be more comfortable, these were the smallest size I could find.”
“I met this guy,” Dean stated as he took a bite, not looking into his brother’s eyes, slightly afraid of what the other might think. Sam’s opinion of him meant everything to Dean.
Based off of:
“You…are acting strange.” Castiel relaxed slightly but it seem extremely forced…it was hard to watch, to see the relaxed position but the tense muscles. “You’re not fooling me, I know you are still not okay.”
“Don’t you think that is taking it a little too far?” The snide tone of his uncle’s voice made Jimmy clench his fists so tightly his knuckles turned white. He hated how his uncle played his side, always making himself seem like the good guy in the whole situation.
“It’s really nice to meet you.”
“Castiel,” the name came from under flowers, huskily muttered in the most pleasing way. Dean tested it around in his head a few times, it was lovely but it felt really formal.
It was so endearing the Dean felt his ears heat up, “Bees, huh?”
“Dean Winchester,” the name came out so smoothly and he knew there was something telling in it. Mother obviously noticed, she’d have to be a fool not to.
One side of Jimmy’s mouth pulled down, briefly debating whether or not to tell Dean the truth, “I’ve never seen it.” Dean had apparently gotten used to the feeling of shock when it came to Jimmy, he just nodded his head while pinching the bridge of his nose. He then quickly tried to explain in the least amount of words that his parents were religious nuts who had a problem with anything that could be considered “pop-culture.”
“The head chef an asshole, so you’re better off just keeping it zipped.” Sam was pulling his hair back into a tight ponytail, and Dean would have fun of him for it if it weren’t for the fact that his little brother was about to land him a full-time job. Which was just plain awesome, asshole boss or not.
Dean’s Background:
Jimmy had missed all of the Winchesters over the weekend so when Monday rolled around he found himself walking with a little more pep in his step.
The words shot out of his mouth like a bullet, “Oh god yes.”
By the time Dean finally got his food nice and soaked Benny had managed to cut a bite of his food. Dean watched as he brought it to his mouth before chewing, and chewing, and chewing finally choking down the bit and reaching out of his water.
Castiel didn’t respond right away, thinking over the other person’s request. He honestly didn’t have that many friends, at least not ones he talked to about non-class project related things. ‘It would be nice to have another friend.’
-.X.-
Sam was spread out on the larger couch, a plate of pizza resting on his chest, leaving Jimmy with no choice in where to sit other than the spot next to Dean on the loveseat. What a stupid thing to call a couch. He was handed a plate with three pieces on it, Jimmy was surprised that Sam had ordered two large pizzas but the Winchester boys alone had already devoured half of one. Like always the first bite of food was the most appetizing, except for when it came to Mrs. Winchester’s, by the second piece it was rather blasé. Not to mention the burn now on the roof of his mouth that ruined every bite. Dean had almost died when Jimmy had tried to dab away the grease, he had said it added flavor.
“Slow down dear, you can have as much as you want but you don’t need to make yourself sick. Okay?” Mary looked worried and it was only because of this worry that he even listened to her in the first place. He could see all the food still in the pots and it eased his want to finish his first plate as fast as possible.
How Cas had never been allowed to read the iconic book still boggled Dean’s mind. He wanted nothing more now than to watch blue eyes scan the pages of the magical story (in more than one sense) with utter awe and obsession. To see the emotions Castiel would go through reading those books, all the ups and downs…triumphs and downfalls. To live the magic and escape life for a while. Yes, it would look amazing, Dean decided.
“About? Take this right.” Still suspicious.
Dean rubbed at his chin as he turned on Magnolia, “Tell me when I need to turn.” Cas nodded and then Dean proceeded to answer the question, “Well now that I know you live so far from school I am glad I decided to drive you. And as for why, well, I wanted to talk to you.” At first Dean had momentarily wondered if it was the right time to talk about this. Probably not but he did want to lie. Dean felt it would be wrong on his part.
Dean would call it beginner’s luck, in fact he did. He kept landing on Castiel’s properties and though he took it with an honest light-heartedness he couldn’t help his competitive side kicking in. He was almost bankrupt so when Cas finally got his due justice, in the form of landing on ‘go to jail,’ Dean couldn’t help just to say it as seriously as possible. “Cas, you’re going to jail.”
Castiel removed the flower that was covering one of his eyes so that he could take a look at the person next to him out of his peripheral vision. He was surprised at how handsome he was. Castiel normally didn’t notice the beauty in people but he could see that Dean was a work of art. But the reason he looked over to begin with was the lack of judgment from the other. He had expected Dean to scoff at him, as most people did. “I wonder if your blue is the same as mine.”
Today they had powdered scrambled eggs, rock hard biscuits covered in white gravy with bacon. It was one of Dean’s favorites.  Everyone was already at the table and they eat quickly through their fifteen allotted minutes before they had to go and prepare to head into the closest village.  They were all too tired to talk, everyone still sleep hazed.
He flew into the kitchen, landing silently by the soup station. There was a man mopping the floor where something had just fallen, his body bent down as he reached the spots under the stove. Castiel watched him intently; the man’s soul was beautiful. Truly the most beautiful things he had ever seen. And then when he straightened back up, staring into Castiel’s eyes, not seeing him but somehow knowing there was someone else there.  Overwhelming beauty, soul and physical appearance, his father really had favored his man to give him so much. Castiel couldn’t help himself, his wings flickering into the human plane, reaching out for the human. In doing this one of the wings knocked a tub of heavy whipping cream into the French onion soup that was currently stewing away (is that the correct term for it).
Dean looked up towards the sky, clouds breaking up the expanse of bright blue, “So, what’s your name?” He leaned back on his elbows, grass tickling the skin now that his leather jacket had been taken off so that he could feel the wind on his body. It was such a nice day.
“You have a brother? Is he your only sibling?” Normally he wouldn’t care to ask a stranger such things but since it was the current topic it seemed rude to ignore. Though, Castiel would admit he was slightly curious about his new ‘friends’ life…but only mildly so.
“So was that him?”
Dean proudly announced that this was his new favorite food and made his mother promise to only let Castiel cook it. Broken promises would be the death of Jimmy.
“I’m not mad; I’m just slightly confused. Who are you and how did you get my number? Also, as for your earlier question: ‘What are you doing?’ I am at work currently.”  Castiel hated his inability to text like a normal person, he just could never bring himself to shorten words or use incorrect grammar.
“Black coffee is too harsh for my taste. Where do you work?”
And when Castiel, not Jimmy, had told his mother what was going on right under her own nose she had blown a fuse. That was how Jimmy found out about Castiel. Jimmy had woken up the next morning sore from head to toe and his mother yelled at him when he showed up downstairs. He had no clue what she had been talking about; Jimmy didn’t remember anything from the time he got home ‘til the time he woke up, which was a common occurrence. So when she started yelling about how he was a liar and a sinner, accusing his own uncle of the unthinkable, Jimmy took the abuse as he did many times after. It took a few choice words before his tears stopped falling altogether.
“Mary,” she corrected as she casually smirked at him.
Castiel’s head was pulled back to the point that it popped harshly which made him stop wondering about what it would be like to be a feline. Castiel felt the thrusting become uneven and hurried. His uncle was then moaning and releasing inside of him, still thrusting until he finally collapsed on his nephew, breath coming out ragged and hurried. He only took a few minutes to compose himself before getting up and leaving his room, but not before slapping Castiel’s ass leaving an angry red handprint. With a satisfied, “That was fun angel, we will have to do it again sometime,” and he is gone for the night. Metatron couldn’t even deal with what he had just done and scurried off like a rat, Castiel chuckled softly at the conclusion. He had always thought of himself as lucky in that respect, that his uncle always couldn’t deal with what he had done afterwards and ran off, or so it seemed. He needed to get up.
