"You have less frontal development of the brain than I expected,” he said slowly, and smiled. The smile was much worse than the stare. He added, “It is a dangerous habit to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing-gown.”
I spent three months in France, working on behalf of the governmental heads of that indulgent nation, as well as several Scandinavian neighbors. Their trust in me was flattering, but the great benefit was the money involved. I wired it to Mycroft in steady increments, to be used in purchasing the confidence of Moriarty’s associates, or engaging in false transactions with them, or in supplying the needs of the men who were working round the organisation, trying to find a weak spot. There was no man more fitted than Mycroft to manage it all.
It was only when he said, “Are these for me?” that I realized he was deeply pleased. His voice had gone gruff, and his ears were slowly turning pink. I got up then, quickly, because I needed to touch him.
“He’s planned a wedding,” he murmured. “He’s kept up a club membership, and a home, and a long-term liaison. I don’t understand.”
“I’ll go,” he said. His voice was barely changed. “I—Forgive me, Holmes, I hadn’t realised—Of course. It looks bad. I ought to have been more careful—in the timing—more circumspect in how I wrote of—you. I am sorry.”
That is all good news. I am especially glad to hear it satisfies you. I had wondered whether you were still as sorry as you were that you had lost her.
So we went off on what amounted to a day-tour of the city. He took me to walk along the Avenue, and bought hot chocolate for us to drink, in a little place I’d never seen, full of Greeks, who laughed at my attempts to speak the language. He ushered me into St. James, and, underdressed as we were, bought tickets for whatever was playing on stage that very minute--it turned out to be a rather stunning recital by Paderewski, the new sensation. He took me to the Baths, and he was unspeakably beautiful there. The relaxation he’d intended was buried in a rush of pure unmitigated joy at his existence. He caught my eye as we settled down in the cooling room. Whatever he saw in my look brought an answering expression of embarrassed delight to his unfairly lovely face. I buried my face in the towels, instead of saying what I wished, while he did the same, with a deep, quiet laugh.
“I—thank you. Forgive me, but suppose we didn’t do this—now?” His eyes were on my throat, newly uncovered; the contrast between the absorbed look and the brusque words stymied me.
“That some men sought other men? Of course I had. But it was always suggested there was a licentious excess there, not a difference in their essential nature.”
We had bought my ticket at the station, five minutes before departure, using one of my false names. I’d taken only the Strad and my carpetbag, so that I would not have to get a porter anywhere along the route. It seemed wisest to leave as few traces of my passage as possible. I boarded ship with a forged passport and a new false mustache wreaking havoc on my sensitive upper lip. John would have laughed to watch me twitch, and warned me to try out my disguises before I used them. But of course John was safe home, well away from me. He was perfectly capable of taking care of himself—I knew that.
For a little while I had thought my greatest, probably my only chance at happiness was ruined. But after a very little while I began to be astounded at myself for wanting him so, to the wreck of everything else I cared for, studies, dignity and home, and despised myself for my weakness. I had wasted my mother’s confidence in me for the sake of a tryst. Had Victor asked me to go away with him till the trouble blew over, or had he made any attempt at all to defend me to them, I might have sustained my feeling for him; but at my mother’s orders he’d left me there and gone off without leaving me any token of his care, any sign that he might wait for me—without hesitation, it had seemed to me. He’d made no effort to speak to me again. Left alone, it seemed obvious that I’d surrendered my good sense without provocation to the worst kind of base emotionality, and paid the cost. I had promised myself never again to let sentiment so cloud my judgment.
A few women were studying for their medical licenses by the turn of the century; Doctor Liddell is a rarity, but not a singular one. See http://blog.sciencewomen.com/2007/07/victorian-woman-doctors.html.
“Holmes.” A warning in his tone. I’d thought we were past being mannerly together, but it appeared I’d thought wrong.
“I mean—I am not able to love her. Not—I don’t mean I don’t care for her, but—in our own bed, I can’t love her as I should. I can perform the act, but only just.” He gave me a quick little look and went back to staring at his knees. I was speechless. He went on, “I suppose you’ll say that’s my own private business.”
I didn't realise he knew what was between us, but he went and thanked me for it—for making you happy. I was thunderstruck, which amused him. You are terribly lucky in him. I do wish Harry could have met you, though I can't imagine what he'd make of you, of us.
"What was that?" he demanded. My laugh made him more suspicious: he stared at me, and then suddenly looked down at the little gold ring on his own smallest finger (placed there by me privately some years before). When he looked up again his expression had changed entirely; his eyes shone bright and very blue.
It was not. It is not. I ought to be there with you. You ought to be able to see for yourself that I am as incorrigibly alive as before, and very much with you in spirit at all times, if not in truth. Tell me you have help of some kind—that you aren't alone. It isn’t good for you.
“It’s just socialization.” She talks to me entirely differently now that she’s Greg’s. I had known she was intelligent, but am still startled by how quick she is when she and I are all right–now I don’t fluster her with my careful indifference. Now that she knows it’s not her fault. “We grow up on rom-coms and love stories. You all don’t.”
Any possibility reasoned out to the same conclusion: I could do nothing but warn my colleagues, and continue with what I had to do, keeping a sharp eye out. And no more boarding-house meals for me: I’d make my own tea in the mornings. Accordingly, I stopped to buy a kettle on the way back to my rooms, and three packets of good black tea; stopped off again at the telegraph office, to send a message to John.
“Thank you,” I said, not knowing what else to say, and stepped into the warmth of the front hall as she drew back.
He stopped, taken aback by my laughter. But to see him stammer over me! He is master of all things, except what is between us. It is satisfying.
“I am sober,” I said, and he stepped back with a sigh. I nearly swayed forward after him, so strong was the sense that he’d appeared suddenly on the road to rescue me after an endless, perilous journey. “I’m fine,” repeated, and he gave me a long look, but said no more, only took his chair with a small sound of relief. His hip must have been hurting him badly.
Leave off pursuit of him, or I should face the consequences. "Then possibly my answer has crossed yours.”
“High time for that,” I found the breath to say, in the light of his happiness. If ever I knew what it was to be fortunate, I knew it then. If I meet with no other luck in the world than I have in John Watson, I will have had enough.
“It is absolutely out of the question,” he said, suddenly, after some minutes of silence. I startled; I had been quite lost in my own thoughts.
“Sherlock,” I said, into the darkness, “did you mean all those things about moral decay, and self-debasement? Do you think less of us for this?”
He stood still. Clearly he hadn’t thought of that, which was proof enough of his disarranged mind.  “I don’t know,” he said at last, haltingly. “I don’t--he may. I’ll go see him.”
All that is true, but one letter I did not destroy. It had lain open atop the rest, undoubtedly received that very day; perhaps the last thing he had looked at, and it had my name on it. My eye had been arrested by the familiarity. I had secreted it in my waistcoat, and finished my task, and fled, with John just behind.
Tell me you are well and home—that you have had no trouble since you arrived. If you are safe, then one thing at least has gone right.
“You have enough time. Write him now--tell him you’ve changed your mind. Get yourself made up. You can change at the club if you want. Did you keep the invitation?” He nodded. “Bring it: the doorman won’t care what you look like if you have it.”
“Once or twice.” She shook her head. “He’d give me his greetings on the way in, and say he didn’t need tea, he was just stopping in for a moment. I’d come up an hour later and find him standing in the middle of the room, staring at nothing. I think he borrowed a book, once, and another time he said he was looking for a missing letter. But I will say he looked sad when he went up, and better when he came down again, which makes one think, doesn’t it—him living all alone as he is, now. You’ll be going straight over to see him?”
Paris at the turn of the century had a significant gay and trans population. The police still picked people up, but (if I've understood right) the culture allowed a little more breathing space for gay men. London had its own gay quarters and clubs, but the atmosphere was growing increasingly tense as people took sides on the question of LGBT inclusion, diatribes were written, and trials were publicized. Increased awareness meant increased polarization.
“I was out playing the tables,” he said, finally. “I didn’t think you’d like it. I didn’t mean to stay at it so long.”
“You never tell me anything. Is this why—? Holmes, loneliness isn’t madness. You’re all right. You’re quite sane.”
“In Islington, I think, but this was sent from the club’s address.” Standing, he reached for his pipe and dug a pile of shag out of the Persian slipper with slightly unsteady fingers; packed it in with slow imprecision. “I suppose I ought to be glad he hasn’t chosen a hotel for the great day.”
“I don’t know that I should.” He looked at me wistfully; then, to my dismay, shame shadowed his features; his eyes dropped. “I don’t want to upset you.”
“No. Yes. No, I—am rather poor company just now. Defeated, and angry. Hardly the right frame of mind for this.” He blushed as he said it, but he looked me in the eye.
I sighed. No talking, then, not about anything that mattered. But I could see how he needed the air; he was shadow-eyed, and grim around the lips. “All right.”
The situation explained, Mrs. Hudson looked a little alarmed, but said, “Well, I sha’n’t answer the bell, then, but I don’t mean to go anywhere. My sister’s coming at ten and I have a new novel for her.”
”Come upstairs,” I said, and started away without waiting for an answer. He followed me silently up the stairs, through the dark. He no longer hesitated even a little at the threshold of my chamber; only stepped inside and stopped, and watched without shame as I removed my cravat, and began slowly to undo my shirt-front. No one who has not known a love inadmissable, maligned and dangerous, can understand the remarkable sensation of being watched openly by someone you have wanted.
“If this was my last coin, it would be yours,” I said, holding out the sovereign for him to see. “All I have, and all I am is yours, and none other’s, from now until the day you die.” I hooked the little coin to his watch chain, with a feeling of triumph: I had said it; exposed my heart entirely, without a falter.
“He’s been here,” I said, “the man I am after. He threatened me, and I don’t doubt he would harm you if he thought it would dissuade me from him. Mrs. Hudson, please take the day off. Go out. Go home with your sister when she comes. Sleep somewhere else until this is over.”
“Yes.” There was no expression in his voice; but the lines of his face showed bewildered exhaustion. Years, I thought, years without hope for his brother.
“You must drop it, Mr. Holmes.” His head swayed a little on his thin neck. I suspect the unsteadiness heralded early palsy, but the motion put me in mind of a poisonous snake, gaze fixed on its prey.
“You crossed my patch on the fourth of January.” He was reading from the book. “On the twenty-third you incommoded me; by the middle of February I was seriously inconvenienced; at the end of March I was actually hampered in my plans; and now, at the close of April, I find myself in danger of losing my liberty, thanks to you.” He put the book away, and raised his brows. “The situation is becoming impossible.”
The first bullet hit him in the shoulder, the second in his arm. He gave a cry, dropped his sidearm and stumbled, and I rushed him, meaning to fling him back upon the ground and secure him. He struggled my grasp a long moment. Desperation made him strong. Then, bleeding and gasping, he wrenched himself from my grasp, unbalanced and went over.
Wordless, I bent again to draw kisses across his wet lashes, his tight-drawn brows, his lovely open mouth, until he trembled. I had never seen him so overcome. I pulled him near, and he laid his head down on my heart and wept. Astounded, I held him, feeling his breath against my neck, his life under my hands. He had waited a long time for me: I suppose the tears had been waiting too. I felt very strange, but very glad, that he would let me see.
“I mean that you need to move out. Not—not forever. I hope.” It was quite terribly obvious that he might never come back, once I had him out. This could take months, or worse; and he was not a man who ought to live alone. If I sent him off lonely, someone else would soon love him—
I had stopped wiring John about events by the third near miss. He would be already well up on his guard, with the endless patient suspicion of a soldier. Any further warnings would only alarm him painfully for my sake, and make it far harder for him to stay away from me. I knew that, because each instance had precisely that effect on me. To be able to see for myself that he was that minute quietly at work, whole, unharassed by murderers, was all I wanted. It was only my conviction that he was safer with me gone that held me steady at my task.
Sherlock Holmes is a contradiction, an enigma, a force; at once the most generous spirit and the most self-contained man I have ever known. I've heard heaven and hell in his instrument as he played for me; I have watched him grieve, and struggle, and triumph; I have known him better, I think, than anyone on earth. Yet for years I'd learned nothing about his boyhood, nor his fears, nor his future hopes, nor his father’s name. He seemed to want nothing but the present moment. I had felt his odd immanence as a mystery; a sense almost of faerie magic about him, as though he were a man outside time. I never felt it as a lack until I knew he loved me.
“You have paid me several compliments, Mr. Moriarty,” said I. “Let me pay you one in return when I say that I would, in the interests of the public, die cheerfully if I could take you with me.”
“But you want to go. To see them. You could get a grasp on all this if you see them.” It was clear, now. “Go without me.”
“Flowers,” was all he answered, into my shoulder; “It’s absurd, me getting like this over flowers,” but then he turned his face into my neck and kissed it, and I knew I’d done something good. So I’ve been getting him flowers. Periodically. Which is still a surprise of sorts, but not such a surprise, after the first time. And the other things we like to do together are quite ordinary–movie nights and Angelo’s and walking around the city and raiding the morgue for useful bits. Ordinary for us, at least. Not really surprising.
He nodded once; his breath shortened, and a flush stained his cheeks, setting my heart to racing; he sat up straighter in his chair. “All right, then. I’ll hope for you to hear me out, anyway.”
He shoved his hand into his pocket, and as I registered the motion I had my pistol in hand, and raised it. But he merely drew out a memorandum-book, very like the one John kept.
I had tucked away the Général’s letters in a carpetbag, with some francs, a set of false whiskers, and three forged passports, and was looking about me vaguely for something else to pack, when John came in with the scent of the rain about him. “There’s tea,” I said, and picked up a folio by Béchamp, considering it. I would have supposed myself quite calm by then, had I been asked; but he (bleary-eyed, and damp through the trouser-legs) stopped midway across the room to stare.
“I should hope so,” she said, “the Doctor’s been missing you that badly. I can’t imagine why the French had to keep you so very long.”
He started, and stared. “Holmes!” was all the response I got at first, in a disbelieving tone, followed by a shake of the head, and then (most improbably) a small smile. “How on earth did you know what I was thinking of? No—” And for the first time since I had known him, he amended the question. “Never mind. I don’t need to hear how transparent I am."
“No, you’re right,” and then he took my face in his warm hands and kissed me again. I swayed a little; I was that far gone. Only he can make me forget myself in the middle of the street. Then he said, “I have slush in my shoe, and I'm cold. Can we take this inside?” And then, in a sudden whisper that told me he was still near tears, “Or just go home? I’d like to go home.”
It was nearly midnight before we came into the station at Strasburg for Geneva. The stars poured a blaze of light across the Continental sky; we boarded the train under their silent glory. I took his bag, and placed it beside mine in the rack; laid our hats side by side on the empty seat opposite ours. There was no one else in the carriage. He sat down beside me—close beside me. As soon as the train began to move, he took my hand in his, and, after a little while, dropped his head onto my shoulder, while the moon rose over the far horizon.
"Hurry, then," I said, and he laughed. I watched him out of sight, and then turned again into the wind, to begin the last long ascent toward the Falls.
I, however, found my own mind returning to the thought, after the first fever of joy had subsided to a steady warmth, amidst unrepeatable nonsense of the sentimental kind and more kisses. I at last gathered rationality enough to ask, “You’ve gone hungry before?”
My wits returning to me, I looked about me sharply for any witness, or accomplice, and saw (my heart began to beat faster) a man standing farther up the mountain, peering down into the mist.
He had already picked over his unappreciated dinner hours ago. I knew better than to make more attempts in that direction. I poked up the fire, and turned the lamps a little lower; spread a shawl over his chair in silent invitation, and settled into mine, to regard his bowed head, his lovely hands grasping the table-edge, nerveless. He was painfully, visibly at an impasse. If the violin would have helped him, or a drink, or a smoke, he’d have gotten it already. At this point ten years ago I’d have gone to bed. Five years ago I’d have picked up a book and pretended to read it while he paced the room. But now—I knew what I’d have wanted, weary, lonely and thwarted in my work. Ten years, five years, six months ago I’d never have dreamt he’d want the same, but now I knew I had something to give him yet.
“As ever, a pleasure,” he said, and shook it. He is never demonstrative, but since I came to truly know him I have never doubted his affection. I returned the handshake warmly. Setting aside all other good things I have gained since I took rooms at Baker Street, I am exceedingly glad to have found a brother in Mycroft Holmes.
He had won. I knew it. I pleaded with him anyway for twenty minutes more, making every appeal I could conceive of; but there was no hesitation in his steady gaze. I never could dim the light of his certainty.
“My brother,” Holmes repeated slowly, with that same strange hard brightness in his tone, “is marrying a solicitor called Alfred Cox, within the week, under the blessing of a remarkable priest, and in the collective presence of his club, instead of the Holmes-Vernet family party that would have witnessed his union should he have been born quite another man. But he set the precedent in his character which I have followed, and has proven incapable of taking a wife. I had not expected him to bend to tradition, after all these years; but I had not anticipated
His face showed no emotion, but his voice had dropped lower, and his fingers were picking and tugging at the hem of his coat. He was entrusting me with something significant. I dared one more question. “Mycroft handled the arrangements, and not Sherrinford? Even though he is the elder to you both?”
I went to visit her. As it happens, she is teaching now in the same set of tenements where I do my Saturday calls. She has taken up with a group dedicated to spreading literacy among the working poor. She divides her time between a makeshift classroom and a series of society functions, seeking patrons. She has even written pamphlets for distribution amongst the over-rich, to direct their troubled consciences toward her cause. I think she may do more good in the slums than I ever have been capable of; my practice can only patch up the damage done in abysmal conditions, while her work offers a way out of danger.
"Yes, of course." His voice—oh, his voice; warm and dry and beautiful. I blinked hard against the impact of it; turned from him to look round at the dangers still inherent in the setting. We were not yet safe.
“All right,” I said, and slid nearer, to tuck myself beneath his arm, and rest my head under his chin, and feel him breathe. For some minutes we lay silently. I could smell the smoke of someone’s cigar on him, and a little of his own sweet cologne. I buried my nose in the soft hollow of his neck, to chase the scent, and he laughed, and kissed the shell of my ear. His lips were cold; he had not been in long.
The days wore on; and we went on together, as close as we could be when he slept six miles distant from my door. Some days he appeared cheerful and steady, and seemed to have forgotten we had ever spoken of his troubles. But sometimes I saw him grieving silently, and a little bitterness crept into the corners of his mouth that had only held gentleness and good-humour in its generous shape for years. I watched him sinking into himself with no little horror: I had forgotten the look of John regretting himself. I despised it. Of all men alive he was the one least fit to wear that look; and it was the sight of him slumped in the corner of a hansom, staring sightlessly down at his clasped hands, with almost a sneer on his lip, that finally broke my reverence for his privacy. We had been talking of the case just concluded, but had fallen into silence as I ruminated with still-uncomprehending interest (my Lord, the arrogance of me) over the fact the the Professor’s name had come up once again, this time in connection with the financier of a dealer of weaponry among the shabbier and more desperate gangs. I had been rambling on, but I glanced up at last, and saw that look on his face, and found myself saying, apropos of nothing, “Nothing has cured you?”
My heart gave a sudden, hard leap in my chest, but I followed him, schooling my breath. Where did all this leave us? What did he mean to do?
“At any rate, I explained about Mary, and then I found myself telling Maxwell about my current troubles. I stammered a good deal, and found it far harder to put the case to a friend than I had to strangers; but he seemed interested. He asked me a dozen questions no one else had thought of, about my diet, my history, mental and physical, and about Mary. About my experience, too, or the absence of it. Then—” and for the first time John hesitated, and searched my face. “Holmes, if I go on, promise me you won’t allow me to say more than I should. If I make you uncomfortable—”
“It was quite unexpected, actually. I had gone a month ago to meet with an old friend from King’s—Dr. Maxwell, who’s written a recent analysis of the rapid transmission of influenza amongst the lower classes. Do you know it?” I shook my head. We were on his grounds now. “At any rate, I wanted to consult with him about his methods of treatment, but as we were in his home and at our leisure, after that we fell to talking about old times.” He smiled at me. “Things are much better with me now than I’d have dared hope, then. I said so, and he asked me how you were. He thought I was still with you. He hadn’t heard I’d been married. He looked quite startled when I said so.”
When I reached our sitting room he stood over the mantle, staring into the hearth. The note lay open on the table.
Billy entered, equipped with a sealed envelope and an expression of purpose. Holmes waved a delicate, desultory hand, and the envelope and expression were brought to stand behind his chair.
“They’re so human,” she said, and sat back against the bar. “They’re such ordinary stories, but that’s the good of them–they make it feel all right to be human. Uncertain of yourself. It makes you think you could find a way to be happy as you are.” She smiled at me.
His sleep was still broken then by pains and terrors, and he often came down still exhausted, well on in the morning. I never ate more than an egg, and so breakfast depended upon him: we generally took it at an hour more befitting a gentleman’s lunch.
A minute’s silence. Then, “His death? I don’t know. Yes, I suppose it was. To be orphaned, even at twenty-five--but I didn’t think of that then. Mycroft handled the particulars; all that was required of me was to attend the funeral, and keep my temper with aunts and neighbors who meant to be sympathetic.”
We had scarcely blinked awake into the morning light when a knock sent us scrambling for our clothes: we had a client. We lock the door to the front stairs before we retire, so I was not afraid of discovery; still, we do like to appear marginally decent before visitors. My mustache looks ridiculous when uncombed, so I hung back to tidy myself while Holmes went down to greet them. When I joined them he was already elbows-deep in mystery. It was one of those he could manage from the sitting-room; in twenty minutes he had it all sorted, and was escorting his relieved client to the door with a glimmering glance of triumph over his shoulder, for my benefit. Two more clients followed in quick succession; then there was a summons from Lestrade, and a ride in a shilling hansom, and a series of forged documents at Scotland Yard which took us half an hour to survey. That was finished off with an animated lecture from my love on the science of handwriting, which none of us grasped whatsoever. He was pleased with himself, though, which was enough for me; especially as he fell quiet again in the cab going home; took dinner wordlessly, abstracted, and afterward smoked a pipe in silence, with a lowering storm in his grey eyes. When he sat down at his desk, and took out paper and pen, but did not write, only stared rigidly down at it, “I’ll just take a nap,” I said into the stillness, and left him to it. I would not bring him back to me quicker by fussing about.
“Then do it.” I stroked his hair, his face, and felt myself alive, with all my wounds--my heart running fast, my lungs taking in air. I felt myself quite sure of one good thing, and said, with my hand on his pulse, to feel it racing, “Marry me.”
“I’m at your service.” I didn’t move; I didn’t want to disturb whatever delicate sense of safety had formed around us. His voice, when he spoke, was steady and low.
Mycroft met us at the door to his office. He is generally impassive to my eyes, though kind; but now his face showed concern. “Come in,” he said. “Sherlock, John--I’ll have tea sent down at once.” Mycroft and I have been on intimate speaking terms since an extraordinary conversation which began, “I hope you realize that I have long considered you family, in the truest sense,” and concluded with him asking me to tell him if I needed anything at all.
I had to agree, though I knew our solutions would be irreconcilable. “Have you any suggestion to make?” I asked.
“Quite. It grew pleasanter as we went on, and I supposed when we came together the joy would follow, but—” A deep sigh. A slight shake of his golden head. “I don’t much enjoy it. I find I have to distract myself from what I'm doing. I think—” A peep at me, at last, to see how I was taking it. “I believe I’m deficient somehow.”
I can scarcely find words. I owe you a thousand apologies. I’d thought you might break my heart, but never I yours. I had no idea of leaving you mourning for me.
When he had gone, I sank into my chair, and tried to collect myself, but it was no use; my blood was up. After a few minutes of deep breaths and blank silence, in imitation of the sages of the East who seek enlightenment, which attempt merely made me intimately acquainted with the anxiety possessing me, I sprang up. There was another way to free myself from myself. I went into my room, and collected my boxing gloves from under the bed; stripped to the waist, and removed my slippers and stockings, and began a methodical pummeling of the old-fashioned punching ball which stood beside my bed. After a few minutes of this the rhythm got into my blood and bones and all the whirlpool of my mind drained into that single point of focus, the drum-drum-drum of fists against leather. The cool of the room soothed the heat in me; the sweat ran down my face; and the fear subsided.
It took me an unforgivably long moment to collect my wits enough to think of it, but then, “Mrs. Hudson,” I shouted, and went down, taking the steps three at a time. “Mrs. Hudson!”
"You said, 'We,'" he said, returning to take my hand into his own warm one again, and dab off the blood with a sure touch. "If you and I go together, I can have no possible objection."
I had wrapped myself close about him. I said into his shoulder, "Yes," and then, finding it easier to speak in the dark, "I missed you the more because you were so near me here. Nearer even than you had been at Baker Street. I wanted to make the memory true."
We sat silent together in the morning light from the east window. It was a little as though the end of days had passed over us, and left us just coming to our senses, lost and amazed, on the charred new earth.
"Very well," I said, in the end, "you stay. But we leave here tonight. Perhaps my brother's men can find him before he finds us."
He scoffed at that, and stood, looking down at me, with a discomfiting expression. “Money can be lost any number of ways, too, or haven’t you ever come to the end of yours? Have you always been so sure of it?”
“He asked me if I had read anything on the subject of constitutional inversion. I said I didn’t know what he meant, and he looked at me for a moment without making me any reply. Then he changed tack entirely, I thought, and said, ‘What about literature? Did you study the Iliad at school? Or have you read the old play, Damon and Pythias?’ I said I had, of course. He went on, ‘I have a suspicion which may startle you. I don’t mean any harm by it: it’s all quite blameless, but you may not think so.’
His politeness made it worse. He needed me, and I could not help him. I could have groaned aloud, but constrained by his silent presence I sat still, watching our breaths cloud the chilly air between us. After a minute he tipped his head back against the seat, and rested there, looking out into the night. With that reprieve I was able to compose myself a little, so that by the time we reached Baker Street I had re-formed a semblance of calm. I stepped with him into the light of our front hall, and hung up our hats side-by-side, and set his cane against the wall, while he started slowly up the stairs. He moves with more difficulty in bitter weather, and any other day I might have caught up to him and offered him my arm, but instead I stood unwinding my muffler, meeting my own gaze in the little mirror that hung there.
He started toward me first. We reached each other, and he was pulling me into himself and burying his face in my hair. My head found his shoulder: I hid my relief in it, and breathed in the safety there, slowly. When at last we broke apart he was smiling such a smile as I had not seen in a very long time. But as he stepped back, and took my shoulders in his hands, and looked me over, a sudden visible worry swept him. Well, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson had looked at me much the same. I tried a smile. “Yes, I’ve worked too hard, and used myself up a bit too much, but—John, it’s almost done.” Then, as I came further to my senses, “Might we close up the window?”
Cocoa was actually considered a health drink then, and masturbating ("frigging") a serious health risk.
When I had followed him into our rooms, and closed the door behind us, he rounded on me; studied me soberly. Coming near, he lifted my hat from my head, proprietary, and slid my coat from my shoulders; lay them over a chair. He caught up my hand; ran his thumb lightly along mine, and smiled a little when I shivered.
Sherrinford, as the eldest son, would have inherited the bulk of the family estate on their father's death (which is why some Holmesians have postulated his existence; neither Mycroft nor Sherlock seem to live like heirs). In my headcanon, he was already sober at their father's death, but that reinforced his resolve. He was emotionally steady enough by then to receive the influx of resources with grace.
She has found a friend, too, among her new group—the sort of friend you and I are, now, I mean. I am glad. It is a relief to hear she is loved as she ought to be.
I saw satisfaction settle over him at my surrender. He nodded, and stood. "Come on, then," he said, "let's go upstairs. I have some things to say to you."
“You would remember that. No, I hadn’t. Nor wanted to. It should have made me think. At school, my studies occupied me, and then there was the excitement of enlistment, and my duties on the field of war; and I supposed then that I had a little more capacity for concentration than my fellows, and a little cooler blood. I could have taken my pleasure cheaply, I do realize that—but paying for a woman’s time held no appeal for me. I never met a girl I really liked, till Mary. There’s something in her—a familiarity, a sense of confidence—” He faltered, searching visibly for verbal expression. “It’s like we’re two children who’ve found each other in the dark, and held on for safety. Something in my soul trusts hers.” He had said as much in his account of their meeting. I had been struck then by the strange innocence of his feelings; but I had not lingered over it, as I was then doing my utmost to avoid dwelling on the fact of her existence. He was looking now as he had then, when he spoke of her—a little anxious, a little dreamy. “She’s a comfort to me, and I think I am to her. I feel as if I may rely on her, but—dear God.” His voice broke a little. “She feels more. She looks at me like the answer to a question she’s asked all her life.”
“It’s all right,” I said, worrying as that statement was. “I’ll meet him now. Or do you mean to send our regrets?”
Mycroft stuck his tongue out at his partner as he settled Sherlock against the mound of pillows at the head of the bed.
"Italy. Or I would consider Greece, if you're that attached to the idea of sun and beaches," Mycroft added with a curl of disdain on his lips.
He started to ease himself up, ready to slither out from under Gavin's arm, and groaned again and the soul-withering twinge in his ribs, making his arm buckle.
Sherlock skidded into the kitchen, the bulky first aid box in tow. “We also have Avengers and Peppa Pig plasters, Jawn!” Sherlock set the box on the kitchen table and opened it, before turning wide eyes on Mycroft.
"Bis'sit?" Sherlock held out his hand for another before Greg had even gotten his shirt pulled down over his belly.
Molly bunched up handfuls of her dress at her sides and did a teetering cursty. "F'ank you, f'ank you!" she said, and skipped the rest of the way down the hall.
Sherlock rubbed at his stingy scalp and pouted as Jawn sprawled on Mycroft. Without the immediate attention available on Mycroft’s lap, he quickly became bored of Jawn’s dumb book and wondered to the toy box. He’d use his action figures to play out his own story. No crayons allowed.
Sherlock pouted, but he chewed and chewed and chewed, just like Greg told him to, then swallowed before holding both his hands out. "Bis'sit now? P'ease?"
"Well, now I feel even worse." Greg put his head on Mycroft's knee and sighed when long fingers carded through his hair.
"We'll see how we feel when we get upstairs," Mycroft said while leading Sherlock to the staircase, where Greg caught up with them.
"Of course they're yours. Gregory was talking about the mountain of other stuffed animals we have." Mycroft set Sherlock's cup on his tray, only for it to be immediately snatched up again. "Slow down, darling...you're going to make your belly ache."
He heard Greg speak up behind him (much closer than he had been while sitting at the counter--of course, he'd followed Mycroft); "Sherlock--"
Greg stared at her, blank-faced, and blinked. "Oh, my God. She said there were no pictures of that."
“Yea. But he was tricked and is sad. So it’s kinda not his fault,” Jawn said, eyes glued to the screen as he fiddled with the sippy cup Mycroft had put in his hands
“P'nochio?” Sherlock asked, and then lifted his arms, the rest of him going boneless against the sofa. “Up, up!”
"No. I hel'bed." Sherlock took off the lid to show off an array of 'borrowed' treasures. "Here can'les!"
Sherlock grew quiet again, and even Mycroft was leaning his head back with his eyes closed, thinking that the baby had finally gone down for the night, when...
"Alright, sweetheart." Greg took his place at the end of the procession, and put his hand on Mycroft's bum.
"Awwww, baby..." Christ, that was the saddest thing he'd ever heard. Greg popped the dummy he'd brought downstairs into the baby's mouth, hoping that would help settle him...and it did, a bit. It stopped the sobbing, but tears were still dribbling out of the corners of Sherlock's eyes as he blinked up at them, looking miserable.
"Did you find some jewelry to go with my gown?" Mycroft caught her chin with his finger redirected her focus.
"I know I didn't put them away in the playroom!" Mycroft called after him, then stood staring at Greg for a moment before they both hurried after the baby.
“That’s a very lovely cup,” Mycroft said, taking it from him and going to retrieve the milk from the refrigerator, with Sherlock holding onto the back of his shirt and stumbling after him lazily.
Sherlock rolled his eyes but tied the bib on him. “I put on Jawn’s bib," Sherlock announced, hopping up to stand next to Mycroft.
"Any excuse to get dirtier," Greg smirked. "Just wait until he gets the---yep, he just got the glitter," he added, watching Sherlock pick up the plastic bottle of glitter and upend it, shake it, and then look terribly confused when nothing came out. He held it above his head and peered up at the cap.
The young detective, desperate for touch, reaches out for John, but the doctor simply smacks his hands away. Throwing his hands above his head in frustration and huffing a pout, Sherlock fails to notice John lean into him.
Sherlock seemed to respond well to the praise, something that genuinely surprised John. Rules were rules, and while John would expect them to be followed, he was more excited to talk to Sherlock about rewards rather then the punishments. He pulled his detective closer to his body. Cuddles were not a reward, cuddles were just cuddles and John enjoyed them just as much Sherlock.
Greg rubbed the dob of lotion between his hands, warming it up. "Not cold. But it might feel cooler than it is."
“I’ve long suspected...something. Though admittedly this wasn’t it.” Mycroft looked down and started to inspect his nails, partially to see if there was any leftover spaghetti sauce that he would have to dig out from under them.
"Why don't you get into bed while Daddy goes and fetches you some warm milk?" John ran his fingers over the top of Sherlock’s head as he moved out the door. "Daddy wants you in bed by the time he comes back, little love." John said as he turned into the kitchen. Sherlock stared down the hallway John had just disappeared down for a moment before glaring at the crib. It was an abomination. Daddy and My were just doing this to be mean to him, but he couldn't figure out why. His fingers twitched longingly for Daddy's jumper; he'd be able to think better if he could touch it but getting any closer to the crib seemed impossible. And Daddy expected him to get in it on his own; he could hear John puttering in the kitchen, giving Sherlock the chance to get into the crib. Daddy should have known better.
Sherlock was sat next to him on the bed in nothing but a nappy, all teary-eyed and mouth covered in crumbs, shoulders coated in thick white cream, with half a soggy, chewed biscuit clutched in his fist.
Sherlock opened his mouth to answer when suddenly Mycroft half-snorted, half-choked in his sleep and both boys froze, eyes wide, and stared at each other in trepidation.
“I didn’t really have to go then.” He says chewing on his bottom lip and making a show of shuffling his feet. “But I really have to go now.”
“I’sh Ca’btin Mean Jawn G’een,” Jawn informed him, already hunched over Sherlock. “Sher’yock? Wan’ Bunny kisses?”
But Sherlock continued up the stairs and back into the master bedroom, with Greg following behind him.
"I y'ove ba'ffs!" Sherlock hopped up, and a scattering of grass fell from his bits and landed on the floor.
Daddy and his disapproval seemingly took up the whole entry way and Sherlock had to stop a step below the landing, making him shorter than Daddy. He felt terribly little and couldn’t stop himself from fidgeting with the stool in his hands and looking anywhere but Daddy’s stormy expression.
Greg looked down, and was pleased to see that the baby's pretty blue/green/turquoise eyes had finally drifted closed.
"Go on, Sherlock--" he began, but stopped when he noticed the odd look on Sherlock's face. "Sherlock."
“You’re both babies.” Mycroft stepped in before his little brother could respond and took the silverware from him. “You, go wash your hands,” he said as he placed them, then stopped short at the brightly-coloured confectionery plate that had been set aside for him. Mycroft gave Sherlock a dry look; “Hardy-har-har.”
"Once you're in bed, Anthea is going to pull your medical records. Again." Mycroft told the sleeping baby. "We probably should have taped your ribs. We'll need to consult YouTube since our favorite physician is currently on my shit list."
Greg walked over and waited for Sherlock to crawl out from under the table before helping him up. "Right, noodles for everyone," he said, lifting the baby up and plopping him in his seat. "Keep your bum in your chair, muffin."
Sherlock reached for his phone first. It was off. He turned it on. "Already installed the tracking device?" he asked, not looking either of them in the eye.
Mycroft huffed a sigh and let one more swat fall as he felt the damp from Sherlock’s onesie seep through his own trousers. “I would much prefer if you listened BEFORE you were spanked,” he said, and  dropped a kiss on Sherlock’s temple as the little detective snuffled his agreement into Mycroft’s shirt collar.
Sherlock trotted along behind him, sand flaking off his naked thighs and feet. "We're no'd a'ppose'a go in'na s'ed wi'fou'd you, G'eg!!!"
“The box said it’s a ‘pocket pussy’, whatever in hell that means.” Sherlock mumbles into the duvet with a shrug.
Mycroft gave the front of his nappy a squish, earning himself a disgruntled squeak. "You most certainly do need a change.”
"Almost. Here..." Mycroft took the cup from Greg and put it in Sherlock's soapy, outstretched hands. "Play for a moment while Gregory and I go order dinner. Don't try to get up by yourself, understand?"
Mycroft took a slow, deep breath…this had been his idea in the first place, after all. “Because I said so, and yes, Sherlock, you can have it in a cup instead. Actually, that’s a better idea…you’re both getting cups.”
Sherlock pulled his onesie up to cover his nose. "I do y'ub 'im. Bu'd he shou' say so'wwy. He try to tri'g me!"
Mycroft came down the last few steps to stand next to Sherlock and, without a word, lifted him up into his arms and held him.
Sherlock put a finger to his mouth while he looked over all of their craft bins, and finally chose a selection of various shells, plastic rhinestones, a bottle of gold glitter, foil stickers, and brightly colored feathers.
"We'll see what we can do." Greg led him out of the nursery and back down the stairs. "Did you have fun with your brother today?"
“Then being outside doesn’t help us right now, does it?” Mycroft tried to reach the doorknob, but having both hands full of a clingy little detective made that quite impossible. And he didn’t really want to find out what would happen if he tried putting him down first. "Can the highly decorated Captain Jawn help us by opening the door, please?”
John closes the door most of the way and moves down the hall into the kitchen. It’s not like John plans to stay up and have fun without Sherlock. After little boys go to bed is when Daddy's do extremely unpleasant things, like tidy up the flat after a messy little boy leaves his mark on it or reads his paper with the familiar drone of the daily news on the telly as background.
“Don’t be absurd.” He glared at me, through the slight haze of fragrant smoke that was forming round about him. “I always want you. But it isn’t safe.”
The City of London exists for the sake and to the praise of money. The populace come to it looking for luck, for love, for a change, for acclaim, and find a chance at them all. But the chance costs money, and the city has flourished around the exchange—money, for life. So many fail to make the first and lose the latter, and the city goes on with its eternal trade in souls, careless of them all.
“A society?” That startled me. I would have expected the brothels and back alleys would serve well enough for buggers’ connexions. I supposed high-class liaisons might be arranged at the wilder society parties, but I’d never imagined a convivial group of chatterers having drinks in a gentlemen’s club. But then—“You’re not going to go behind Mary’s back?”
“At his club,“ he murmured, “in Piccadilly, in three days. To be followed by dancing.” He appeared as speechless as I; that was a kind of comfort.
I have been back to our rooms, at Mrs. Hudson's urging—she's fed me more than one Sunday dinner. And I have been with your brother, too. Supposedly we are plotting, but I think he's mostly only humouring me; there's so little of substance I can contribute. He makes me stay to tea anyway, and indulges me in conversation about you.
Our breakfast came and was after cleared away without disturbing his reverie, though he shifted at last from his wandering songs into a fiercer, wilder melody, something like a battle in the offing. I leaned back in my chair, and closed my eyes, and dreamed the fight with him, until at last he finished up with a sudden, decisive sound and an audible “Ha!” I sat up, to see him lay down the instrument, and turn about for his hat.
This was quite true, but entirely beside the point, and, “Why didn’t you tell me?” was all I could find to say.
He looked up, startled; I am rarely profane, but nothing else would express my feelings at that moment. I held out my arms to him, and he came to me; knelt around my legs, and took my face in his hands, and kissed me, hard and deep.
“Oh, I’d suspected.” He pulled back and looked up at me then, all rosy and golden in the firelight, and all unconscious of himself. “Yes, I worked for my later schooling. There was little left over for food, but I paid my way honestly. My father had debts, and after they were settled we hadn’t much left. I’ve never had a place I haven’t worked for.”
“What was it like?” I asked, finally, pulling away to see his expression. The complicated look passed over his face again.
When at last he turned to me, Mrs. Hudson had come and left with our dinner long ago; I had lit the lamps, and settled myself before the fire with a cigarette; thinking of how little I knew of the history of him. His eyes, when they found mine, were dazed; he looked as though he were waking from a trance. “John,” he said, sounding half-stunned, and then louder, “John. Are you all right?”
“Oh.” Surprise lit his face. He set aside the notebook. “In that case, yes. I’ve found some help at last.”
Watson hadn’t had any such certainty, which became apparent by degrees. At first I found myself baffled by him. True, he had confided that he’d been almost out of resources when I met him, and I knew his pension was a pittance. But I hadn’t considered that his poverty might be less a moment’s exigence and more a dogged fact. I hadn’t considered much at all, in fact, except that he was lovely, thin and tired and worn as he was, and seemed drawn to me, as I was captivated by him—his bright smile, his ready interest. I liked him very much. I wanted to know more of him.
I had not anticipated how the loss would unravel me. I am not a narcissist: I had no idea of claiming a right to him. But neither am I the self-sufficient sage I have invented for my most often lived-in self. I do not think he knows it, but I need him. So at last I found a way to gather myself up and come asking for him, offering whatever I had, my stories and my work and my company. It seemed to be enough for him. He was happy when I came.
"Mycroft's right, muffin." Greg took the empty plate next, leaving Sherlock's cup in front of him. "We'll get your bee wellies."
Mycroft sat back on his haunches; “Quickly then. Your aim will be even worse if there is soap in your eyes.”
"Here ya go, Nugget-I mean, Sherlock," Greg said, puffing into the kitchen. "Happy Birthday an' all that. Ta' many more."
Greg watched him walk away, as a sly, wicked little grin crossed his face...a beat later, he darted after Mycroft and smacked him full on the arse when he dashed past him into the room.
He didn't want to admit how much that broke his heart. "Good boy. Hold my hand when we're on the stairs, okay?"
“I always wanted one, but Mummy said no rodents. I tried to explain that they aren’t rodents, they are insectivores.”
Jawn puffed his chest like an indignant hen. “NO, My’coff!” he insisted. “See?!” He tried to spear one of the noodles with his little fork, and managed to get it halfway to his mouth before it fell off and landed back on his plate with a soft ‘splat’.
Mycroft hung back, watching as Greg eased Sherlock up the steps. He waited until they made it to the top landing, then turned, and went back downstairs.
"I think we can manage that." Greg threw open the lid of the trunk and watched Molly dive nearly head first into the thing, scaring himself and startling the bejesus out of Sherlock.
"F'ank you for sharing wi'f me! I won' tell nobody I seen 'em at your house!" Molly carefully pulled out bits and bobs, adding each bracelet she found to her skinny arms.
“G'eg a’ My'coff gar’en is nice.” Sherlock hunkered down in front of Jawn and showed him the bibs he’d picked out. “Pick, Jawn.”
The excitement wilted from the little detective’s face and he sat back down, pouting over his plate…it wasn’t the same when Mycroft didn’t do it.
John feels himself grin like a mad man at the sight and gets into bed beside his little one.  As Sherlock snuggles into him, resting a curly head on his shoulder, John can’t remember why it was so important for Sherlock to go to sleep in his own bed.  “I’m completely bewitched, aren’t I?” He mumbles into Sherlock’s forehead, dropping a kiss there. Sherlock hums around the thumb in his mouth, but a quick glance down confirms that the boy is already out like a light. “G’nite, Pet.” John whispers to the sleeping figure as he flips off the bedside lamp.
If Daddy missed him, why did he leave him behind? Sherlock frowned. It was too big a thing to think about right now.
Jawn’s demeanor changed as he turned his attention to the pitiful sniffling coming from his lap. “Sherlock,” he gasped. “...You caught two new freckles this morning!”
With a beautiful pout he began to collect his favorite toys from the toy basket, putting them in a shopping bag Grammy had found. Mrs. Hudson added his cup, some nappies, and a dummy to the bag before handing it to Sherlock to carry. “You are such a good helper.” Despite his sads, Sherlock preened under the praise. He was a good helper.
"Pffffft," Greg snorted. "You're just like your brother," he said, and kissed the top of Sherlocks' head. "Is it my turn again?"
The little detective sighed and rested his ear against his brother's chest. A few moments later, the humming became a duet as Jawn joined in.
Mycroft smirked triumphantly, and turned back to the changing table. Enough of this mess for one night.
Mycroft stopped in mid-sentence and looked back down at Jawn, who was making sure the rest of his plastic dinosaurs were safely sitting on top of the other toys, off to one side of the toy box. “…What movie?”
Mycroft wiped the set of saucy fingerprints from his wrist. “ ‘Took’ one, and no, you did not. Sitting in a tub of water and cups does not count as a full bath.”
"They's b’ery dumb, 'cept Humphrey. He's ok." Jawn nodded. Humphrey was Jawn's favorite bee. Even though Sher'yock had been reluctant to share this with him, Jawn had staked a claim on the best of the bees.
Greg sat the bottle on top of the dresser near the door, and set the pills next to it. "I'm leaving these here," he told Mycroft. "C'mon, Molly, I'll see you out."
"Yea. I p'omise," Molly hooked her pinky on Sherlocks', and they shook on it. "You know I y'ub p'yayin' wi'f you."
Surprised by the kiss, Sherlock jerked his head back, startled, and blinked at his brother owlishly before he started giggling. “Noooo, My! I see tee’fs!” He gently butted his forehead against Mycroft’s shoulder and rubbed his face from side to side, chanting “Tee’f tee’f tee’f, I see tee’f!”
"Then I chose well." John chuckled as he took the box from Sherlock, placing it on the table. Sherlock took a bite of the cupcake, not concerned with the mess he was making. The icing spread across his lips messily and crumbs fell into their lap. John laughed harder. "Next time I'll remember to bring towels too."
Greg stood up and a glittery golden shower fell from his clothes. Christ, this was going to take forever to clean up. "Just let him rub, Myc," he grumbled, brushing himself off.
He stretched and blinked to clear his vision. That's right, he remembered...they'd been taking a nap.
"I know you did, too. I was there." Greg dried Sherlock's hands and gave the baby a kiss on his cheek, then lifted him onto his hip.
Jawn chewed his lip, but couldn’t stop himself from snorting out a giggle, and once he’d started he couldn’t stop. “You stink so much!” He said, pressing his own face against Sherlock’s. “How do you do this every time?!”
"You can't afford me." Mycroft took another bite of his pizza. Greg chuckled and rubbed Jawn's back, rousing the little doctor.
Sherlock's eyes widened, but he kept his gaze squarely on the steps. That was one of the rules when walking on the stairs...always watch your feet. "I ca'n?"
Molly dropped her hands and offered the pen light to Sherlock. The baby hesitantly took it from her and fiddled with it. "It's just a light. I want to shine it in your eye to make sure your eye is healthy. It won't be comfortable, but it shouldn't hurt."
"I di'nah sass," Sherlock grinned, picking up the spyglass and pretending to watch what Greg's hands were doing.
"You know exactly what I'm talking about!" Mycroft wagged a finger at him, but most of his focus was still half buried in the junk drawer, so Sherlock didn't worry.
"Give me that!" Mycroft snatched the phone and quickly closed the YouTube video that his little brother had pulled up of dogs startling themselves awake by farting.
Sherlock took Greg's hand and stomped after him, listening to the thunk of his boots on the ground and the little showers of glitter that fell off of him. "I'm b'ery spar'gly, G'eg."
Mycroft showed him the box of decorated bandages. "Look," he said, keeping his voice low and soft. "Do you want to pick out your new one?"
Jawn stared at his feet and nudged at the carpet with his toes, before look up at Mycroft through a wave of dirty-blond hair. “…Can I still pick?” he asked hopefully.
Both boys were bent over the edge of the tub, chasing after pieces of floating detritus with their little nets and giggling to themselves, with a few minor disagreements about who was going to catch what piece, and even Mycroft had to admit…it was strangely cute.
John releases his hold on Sherlock’s hair and pats his cheek in praise. “You’re such a good boy.” John mumbles as he pulls himself from Sherlock’s mouth with a small pop, and they both collapse on the bed.
"Now, see...I didn't know that," Mycroft said, using the fork tines to gently scrape caramel from Jawn's bottom lip. "Because you always have a jar of black currant jam in the refrigerator every time I visit, so I thought that was your favorite."
"Grown ups don't have potty mouths cause grown ups are allowed to cuss." Greg put the cup down near Sherlock's bowl, snatching a piece to tofu out of his noodles.
Greg bunched it up as much as possible and carefully lowered it over Sherlock's head; "We maybe didn't think through this game..."
The car pulled up at the rear of the house, and the driver was opening the door for Greg in an instant. "Never will be used to that," he muttered, turning and opening his arms for Sherlock. "Come here, muffin. Let's go in the house and find you a cup."
"Ah-ah, that's not yours." Mycroft moved the glass plate away and set a plastic plate in front of Sherlock, the chicken already cut into bite sized pieces; "...this one is yours."
"Jawn gosta hab a cas'." Sherlock looked after Jawn and Greg as they mounted the three shallow steps to the porch, inching away from Mycroft to follow.
“...Or another time.” Mycroft linked his fingers with Sherlock’s, giving them a gentle squeeze. “What kind of sprinkles do you prefer?” He guided them down the stairs and out the front door.
Mycroft switched from patting Sherlocks' backside, to combing his fingers through his hair. "What about the chicken? Do they not show him very much either?"
Jawn was dumping all of his stuffies onto the bed and climbing in on Mycroft's left side. "Turn i'd o'bb for hims," he whispered back, wiggling under the covers.
John blushed brightly and shook his head. “Right. Well. Let’s find a place to keep your hedgie then, shall we?” Sherlock’s lopsided grin almost made up for being compared to a roly little hedgehog. Almost.
"Sure! Can you get Greg a regular spoon please?" The little lad deserved a little spoiling this weekend (and probably the next few weeks after), so unless he was doing something that would directly cause him harm, Greg was going to make sure the tyke got whatever he wanted.
Sherlock disappeared into the nursery and was back moments later, shoes on the correct feet. He bounced on his heels; “Can I have two orders of chips?”
Sherlock was suddenly on his feet in front of him. "I help. Gi'b me Jawn," he whispered and, before Greg could protest, was already lifting Jawn out of Greg's arms.
"Nah, won't be the same," Greg crawled into their bed and stretched out mostly on Mycroft's side of the bed. "Ain't any good unless you're tellin' it."
“Shall we tidy up the kitchen while we wait for takeaway?” John noticed Sherlock trying to sneak another cupcake and he quickly put an end to it.
"I know, sweetheart." Greg filled the cup and put a hand over Sherlock's eyes. "Did you feel better today?"
"I know! They are very tasty, but try this..." Greg popped a bite of buttered roll into Sherlock's mouth, and got the pants charmed off of him when the baby touched his mouth as he chewed. "Look at you, big boy," he cooed, and offered Sherlock another bite.
"Baths are lovely, especially after a long day of playing hard." Perfect. Someone was going to go down for bedtime without much of a fuss. Mycroft stood and picked up two of the cups; "Would you like to help me carry them inside and put them in the window?"
Sherlock looked over at the little doctor with the bed-mussed hair that was slogging over to them, and the warmth that emanated from his gaze made even Mycrofts' 'stiff upper lip' waver a touch.
"Jus' two," Sherlock repeated, leaning down until he was almost nose-to nose with the cup, and squeezed. "One...two."
"And it's come in quite handy more than once, so hush." Mycroft sat Sherlock up in his lap and held him close. "Here, hold on to me, that's it," he murmured, and put Sherlock's arms around his neck before attempting to stand up. "There you go, good boy."
Greg held up his hands for cover; "I didn't hear you tell me to stop," he said, giggling like a school boy.
“…and we are going to go through the flat and find all of the hidden dummies and if you refuse to share your dummies with Jawn, then I’ll have to get him some of his own. And he’s not going to share with you since you haven’t shared with him." Mycroft finished cleaning the dummies and held them down for Sherlock. “Which one?” The little detective made to grab both, but Mycroft pulled them out of reach. “One."
“No, no, no! We’ll be good!” Sherlock said as Jawn nodded emphatically. They both loved Nana, the sweet old dear, but she didn’t put up with fuss and was quick to deliver a smack.
"Bu'd I din'nah ge'dda pu'd g'yitter on i'd," Sherlock sniffled and rubbed the drips of water from his hair away from his face.
"You little..." Greg muttered as he stooped to his knees and sat on the floor in front of Sherlock, then grabbed the baby's ankles and pulled him on over anyway.
“Fu'g?” Sherlock garbled around his dummy, grinning like the cat who’d swallowed the canary when Jawn hid his face in a blankie to giggle. “Fu'g!”
"So'wwy!" Sherlock squeezed the handle on the sifter, raining powdery flour into the bowl. "We sif' choco'yate too?"
"Let Myc help," Mycroft sputtered, wrapping a hand around Sherlock's as he pulled another scoop out dirt out of the bag
Mycroft squawked when someone pinched his bum. Whipping around he found Sherlock looking oblivious and Greg looking smug.
“Yea, drool is gross,” Jawn said, eyeing the thumb while still rubbing lazy circles on Sherlock's chest.
"I'll bet. It's been a long day and we're all starved." Greg swung the door open and got out of the car. Mycroft unbuckled Jawn's seatbelt and then used his weight to slide himself and Jawn across the seat.
“Ni’ni, Shhh’lo’g,” Jawn slurred around the dummy he’d secreted in the pocket of his jams. He wiggled a bit, until he was pressed flush against Mycrofts' side from chest to toe.
Mycroft watched as Jawn snuggled into Sherlock’s lap, while Sherlock took one of the blankets that had been tossed onto the couch and wrapped it around the little doctor’s bare legs. “Do both of you sleep in half hour intervals now?”
Mycroft sent off several emails, arranging to work from home for the next week except for a single pressing engagement. "I should browse Amazon for books for the baby in bed," he said out loud, just to hear his own voice, and stretched as he closed out of his computer.
Sherlock, however, was beginning to get tired of wasting time. "He's no'd in there, My'coff!" he protested, sounding just as frustrated as they both felt.
"Alright you," John pushed him off his lap gently. "Takeaway for dinner. You were good today, you pick."
"Hello, sweet boy. How many biscuits did Greg sneak you?" Mycroft leaned in and kissed his baby brother's cheek.
“Jawn didn’t do the buttons right.” Sherlock moved around his brother to help him re-button the coat. “Buttons are tricky, Jawn.”
Mycroft sighed...fine. Whatever it takes to get Sherlock to shut up. “What do you get out of this? I know enough from John’s file to know what he gets out of it-“
Sherlock took the other piece of toast and crunched down on it in a big bite. "C'an we pu'd signs on'em?" he mumbled through a mouthful of berries and bread.
"Hims can'nah ha'bs any ca'ge," Jawn said, his cheeks puffing out as he stuffed the last two bites of his own sandwich into his mouth.
"Hardly. But we can watch the panda movie, if that's what you really want." Greg kissed his forehead. "Just no bouncing around after. Proper couch potatoes don't bounce."
"And then we saw the tigers and one of the tigers was swimming! They were Bengal tigers, My!" John smiled at his laptop as he listened to Sherlock chatter into the mobile while he paced about the sitting room.
"A'course." Greg took the baby's hand and led him into the kitchen. "If you're gunna have ten chocolate cereals you're going to need the proper bowl."
"Which ever one you choose will make our faeries very happy. Though I'm partial to the ones where all the flowers aren't purple," Mycroft pointed at a Hyacinth with a smattering of white flowers.
Sherlock stopped tearing his bread into chunks and leaned forward; "Y'ah, p'eathe," he said, sucking melted butter and parmesan off his fingers.
Letting Sherlock rest, he reaches down to take the silicone cup off of his boy's cock. His flaccid cock slips out, wet with lube and cum. Another moan from the boy and he tries to curl up into John’s lap.
"Easy! Gentle touches for your very old big brother." Mycroft rearranged him until his head was reclined on Mycroft's shoulder.
Greg smirked. "You and me both, love," he said, putting his arm around Sherlock and curling his fingers in his hair.
"It has anti-inflammatory properties, so that makes sense. Though, talk about mess..." Mycroft sat back with his glass in hand, thinking.
Mycroft had to get him appeased somehow; little things like hand-holding and spoon-feeding could be easily missed among a crowd who wasn’t paying attention…a six foot man bawling and blubbering at the top of his lungs couldn’t. “Is it because I told you to do it yourself? Sherlock, I promise, I swear, that if you can just wait until we get home, I’ll hold you all afternoon if you wish it!”
The little detective’s eyes widened comically; “I will?” he whispered with a muted reverence…almost as if he weren’t horrified at the idea, but excited about experimenting to see if it were possible.
"Damn k'ik!" Jawn shouted. He'd listed to the side...and then backward until he was laying on his back, feet waggling in the air.
“No…you’re going to talk to me, little lad.” Mycroft wasn’t angry. Just very, very fed up. But he wouldn’t shout at an actual two year old, and he was not about to shout at someone who felt like one. “Why are you in trouble, Sherlock?”
"I wan' do dir'd, My'cobb. I do i'd!" Sherlock wiggled between his brother and the bag of potting soil he'd been about to shovel into the pot.
"Oh, you gonna help us find them, little detective?" Greg chuckled and gave him a bounce. How adorable! "They were blue with...what was it, Myc? White spots?"
"Sit down and buckle your seatbelt." Mycroft barked as he bodily forced Sherlock back and into his seat. Mycroft sat down and extended his arms, helping guide Jawn into the seat beside him.
Sherlock grinned at all the praising, letting thin twin lines of soup dribble from the corners of his mouth.
Molly took off a set of copper bangles and handed them to Sherlock, but getting them on over all his rings proved to be rather tough. "G'eg, hel'b?" the tiny little battered detective asked, holding his hands up.
"Jawn's going to sit up front with me, so--wait, wait wait wait!" Sherlock stopped, one foot off the curb as he was going to open the passenger side door...Greg had forgotten that he'd parked with that side in the street. "No, you get in on this side, lad; stay out of the street."
Jawn squeezed his hand and glared; “If I miss out on chips and ice cream because of YOU, I’m not playing with you anymore!”
Jawn aimed his duck, glancing between it and the sink repeatedly; the tip of his tongue between his teeth. Jawn’s duck splashed out of the tub, bouncing off the faucet and flying most of the way back to the tub.
Sherlock pouted and shook he head. “Nnnnnn!” he whinged, patting his own nose, demanding his bunny kisses.
"Shhhhh..." Greg caught his wrist before he could make for the stairs. "You are not going to wake everyone else up on a whim!" At the sound of his own words, Greg winced; the lack of sleep was making him harsher than he'd like. "You don't want to snuggle with me?" Greg made a pouty face at Sherlock.
“As you can see, Sherlock is cranky and needs to be fed and then put down for a nap, so hurry along.”
"I should. Don't tell your brother," Greg said, and handed the baby another biscuit. "How about we watch Dory again? You like that one, don't you?"
When Sherlock made no further objections, John moved on. "The next rule about your health,” John scribbled the word 'Eating' across the paper. "Sherlock will eat three reasonable meals a day."
Mycroft nodded and checked over his shoulder to make sure the little doctor was close. “Jawn, you are not Gene Kelly; keep up.”
there is going to stick and be very uncomfortable."Mycroft turned to look over his shoulder. "That's disgusting, Gregory," he said, and Greg rolled his eyes.
Sadie: A smart tug on an unruly lock of hair put a stop to that as Mycroft continued to explain why Sherlock would now be sitting on the floor and not his lap with Jawn this time, who brought back another book in The Grey Crayon series: Grey Crayon Goes To The Zoo. He wouldn’t insist on Mycroft making the animal noises, but he informed him that it would only add to the experience.
"Go find the matching glove then, muffin. It should still be in the trunk." Greg swatted playfully at Sherlock's bottom as he crawled over to the trunk, the dress making a loud *WHUFF* sound underneath his hand.
“He always gets like that after a spanking,” Jawn said, climbing onto the bed with a book clutched in one hand. He pushed it towards Mycroft and flopped down next to Sherlock, then pulled the little detective into his arms. “Like he’s got no bones left!”
"Communicate?" He nods emphatically, grateful Daddy understands. "This wasn't the proper way to discuss this Sherlock. I'm going to let it slide this once, but consider this your only warning on the issue. Understood?" He nods again.
"Aww, you said I could lick the beaters." Greg reached a sneaky finger into the mixing bowl and popped a large smudge of frosting into his mouth.
"A perfect color for you. Maybe you can barter some of your bracelets for Sherlock's rings," he said, nodding to the baby as Sherlock stacked every ring he could find on each of his fingers.
“You’re missing a spot, little man,” John’s fingernail picked at the dried glue, but it did not come off. Sherlock followed John’s direction and washed away the glue.
"I..I.I'm not actually touching it Daddy." Sherlock mumbles, trying and failing to snark about it. Daddy is growling, how in hell does he do that, and the noise is going straight to Sherlock's cock. He glances at Daddy and gives a small thrust just to be cheeky.
"There once was a little boy," Mycroft began in hushed tones; "that had a pet bunny. And he loved his bunny very, very much, and his bunny loved him just the same. But, the bunny...what do you imagine the bunny's name was? That's a part of the story that I can't seem to remember."
"But I'm your brother first, and foremost. And what did Brother tell you both before you came downstairs?"
“No, Daddy. My bed is upstairs.” John stared at him with that damned unreadable expression for a few moments before his mouth turned up in a soothing smile.
"How?!" Mycroft asked again and the pain in his voice evident, and hurt Greg so very, very much to hear. And to see. "How am I supposed to take care of him when he. won't. stay?! When he won't
"That's a good start." Molly put gentle hands on either side of Sherlock's head and tipped it this way and that. "His concussion has cleared. But keep an eye on his vision." She made a face at her accidental pun.
Having spent most of last night planning, there’s no way that he won’t be able prompt John into giving him what he wants.
"Look at me Sherlock," John commands and Sherlock snaps up to look at his lover. His eyes dart down to where John is working his hand over the bulge in his pants. Sherlock, lacking self-discipline, lets his hand move down to mimic John's movements.
Mycroft actively ignored his little brother and turned to Jawn. “Here, give me that,” he said, reaching for the dirty flannel; “and go wash your hands.”
Mycroft wiped it away with his thumb, then wiped his thumb on Sherlock’s blanket. “Well…you’re not wrong. But I thought you liked Iron Man?”
"Purple bubbles it is," Greg replied, pouring a generous amount in the water. In an instant there were suds and bubbles starting to pile up underneath the faucet, filling he room with a tangy, artificial grape scent.
"I will be absolutely careful not to pinch your toes. Here, put your foot in and push as hard as you can...without kicking ol' Greg over."
Even sniffling hur'd. Sherlock took the pills and swallowed them with a sip of milk and a grimace. "I ha'd i'd."
"How I ma'ge music, G'eg?" Sherlock asked, kneeling next to the bed and turning over one of his little bug friends over in his hand, looking for a button.
“I’m sure it’s very sweet.” Mycroft got a small spoonful of his ice cream and held it up to Jawn’s lips. “But I’ve seen you tuck away a whole jar of that marshmallow gunk without batting an eyelid. What’s put you off, hmm?”
"Of course. Use the trowel and dig in here," Mycroft put his hand over Sherlock's again and helped him 'care'bully' dig out the flower.
“Alright, Sherlock, that’s enough.” Mycroft gently pulled the baby away from Jawn, tucking him against his side. “Are you done with the grumps now, Jawn?”
Now that he didn’t have his baby to play with anymore, the switch flipped and Jawn glared at Mycroft. “I’m not very happy with you.”
Sherlock turned to him with a snippy comment right on the tip of his tongue, but it quickly turned into a smirk, followed with giggles. “Jawn Jawn Jawn, lookit!” he said, nudging Jawn with his elbow. “My’coffs got pink!”
But, back to the task at hand, so to speak. “You’ve been testing my limits all day, little boy…you would think seeing it happen to Sherlock twice would have been enough of a deterrent, but nooooo!…” he scolded, swatting all over the little gremlin’s bouncing bottom.
"Hm, 'kind of'," Mycroft hummed, and rubbed his hand up and down Sherlocks' back. "Would you like the rest of your noodles?"
When it was obvious that he was not going to pry the glass from John's hands he backed off. Collecting the rest of his experiments, he slid them close to him so he could wrap his arms protectively around his precious 'chemicals.' "Touching unmarked chemicals is dangerous; it’s the first rule of experimentation Daddy."
“Don’t be scared." Jawn scooted his bum off the bed and stood awkwardly shuffling his feet. It was clear he wanted to hold the little detective, but didn’t want to force it. “My'coff was being mean. I didn’t mean to be scary. I just wanted him to be gentler with you.”
after the day they’d had), Mycroft could have threatened his little brother again. He could have swatted him again. He could have raised his voice again.
It was there that he stopped, and looked around. He knew Mycroft had left them down here; he just couldn't remember
Greg took his chance and scooped up the phone as Sherlock dropped it to cover his bum. "Not in front of the child, Myc."
Greg frowned at him but held his tongue. Anything would be better than pulling the bandage off as it was.
Mycroft made it the rest of the way up stairs and down the hall to their bedroom, keeping up a mantra of soothing talk; "We made it. We're going to lay down and be so comfortable. And we're going to make Uncle Gregory fetch your bunny and the soft blanket we left on the sofa, yes."
Greg swiftly took the bottle from Mycroft and popped it into his mouth."Mycroft is going to go keep our spot in bed warm for us."
"Right, nap time it is then." Greg closed his nappy with a firm pat to his bottom, then pulled his onesie down to snap it closed.
Greg rolled his eyes, unsure how he'd ended up in the company of the two most dramatic members of their family. "Of course. Sweet milk for the sweet boy."
Mycroft leaned in close to his little brothers' ear. "Would you like to give Molly a hug before she leaves?" he asked, and Sherlock nodded before trying to sit up.
"Nooo, G'eg...gi'b i'd back!" Sherlock whinged as soon as he realized his mistake, and reached for it again. "Mine phone!"
"I knoooow how'a do i'd," Jawn huffed, sending mint-smelling foam dripping from his mouth down the front of his pajamas while Mycroft sighed--no. No, he didn't sigh...he was far too tired to sigh anymore. "Just spit and rinse, Jawn."
“Did you rinse the soap off the ducks?” Mycroft regretted the words even as they came out of his mouth. Jawn hooted and plopped his bottom back into the tub and turned on the water, squealing and back pedaling when cold water poured out of the tap and splashed him.
', startling everyone for a moment. "We were gonna wake you up after a quick bite," Greg said, retrieving the butter from the fridge as he put the blueberries back.
If Mycroft had thought Sherlock was a little drama queen, then Jawn really took the cake! He kicked and howled and blubbered like a man on fire, and not for the first time, the older man found himself thanking several different deities that he had nearly a foot of leverage over the compact little piston in his lap. He proceeded to turn Jawn’s bum a uniform shade of scarlet.
Sherlock let out a shaky laugh as he felt his heart rate return to normal; "Jawn!" he said, reaching for him. "Wake up, monkey!"
"Ah-ah, don't twist in your seat like that, sweetheart." Greg gently pushed his shoulder back. "You're going to hurt yourself."
"Never you mind. It's time to eat." Mycroft held Sherlock's hand while he climbed down, then turned his attention back to their little 'patient'. He took Jawn under the arms and tried to lift him to his feet. Jawn stayed limp.
Sherlock's mouth falls open, each thrust forcing the air out of his lungs as his head lulls back in pleasure.
“Come along, boys. It’s dinner time.” Mycroft sat himself at the middle place setting, scooping a bite of pasta into his mouth. He’d like to eat at least part of his meal while it was still warm, thank you very much.
"Yeah..." Molly took the bib from him, noticed the ducky on it, smiled, and pulled it on over her head.
"I'm not sure." Greg helped guide Sherlock up the steps, a careful eye on their feet; "but it's not a very nice thing to do."
"Yeah, hugely proud." Greg leaned forward and kissed his cheek. "But now we've got to get Jawn to the hospital. Your brother's meeting us there."
“Aye-aye, captain." Greg took Sherlock's hand. "Let's go, squirt...we'll have a quick bath, and then make cupcakes."
“Shush, both of you.” Mycroft held open the door to the chippy, grateful for the mercifully short walk. He snagged Sherlock’s arm before he could drag Jawn to the back of the eating area to an array of video games and claw machines.
Mycroft sighed and looked down at his little brother, who was nearly done with his popsicle and covered in a new coat of 'sticky'. "He at least needs a change, and desperately. That thing's going to burst."
Mycroft rolled his eyes and, yet again, pried the little nappy-wearing barnacle off of him. “Counter first, then cuddles.”
" 'Cause couch potatoes don't have to wear pants, do they?" Greg shoveled a spoonful of corn into Sherlock's mouth.
Sherlock followed him docilely into the bathroom, holding his hand tightly. Mycroft wet a flannel and wiped his face, chuckling as Sherlock grumbled and tried to move his face out of reach. Mycroft untangled their hands so he could clean those as well.
’ He fished around in his suit pocket; they were still two blocks away from home, but things had become just a tad more complicated now.
"No! I already was on punishment for that, My! Daddy says I can't get in trouble twice for the same thing!" Sherlock huffed, thrusting the phone at John. "Tell My I can't be in trouble for that anymore, Daddy!"
“I won’t, as long as he doesn’t give me reason to.” Mycroft whapped Jawn’s bottom; “Close your eyes, please.”
Greg watched the procession with a half grin. "The fucking wheelbarrow," he repeated, shaking his head, and then followed the others inside.
"Oh, that's nice....what colors did you make?" Greg asked, trying to keep the little one talking while he gently dabbed a washcloth around his sunburned shoulders.
Jawn propped his elbows on the table and rested his chin in his hands. “It’s not fair…you were the one being a baby!”
Sherlock didn't bother replying. He sighed shakily and sank down in his brother's lap, and lay his head against his chest.
“Yes, just this once.” This was a mistake, Mycroft could tell by the leer that flashed across the little doctor’s face. Sherlock daintily picked up a single noodle and ate it...in the same instant both of Jawn’s tiny fists where buried in pasta as he squawked in delight.
Greg snorted; "A nap after polishing off a whole box of popsicles between the two'a you, right...and I'm the Queen."
Sherlock threw his head back and sighed. “The best behavior. We know! They are gunna run out of chips!”
"Mmmmm, no. I f'ink I 'member tha'd." Sherlock made small whimpering noises as Mycroft carefully cleaned his face.
"A'w dun', o'gay? S'op i'd now!" Sherlock slithered out of his booster and away from Mycroft's flannel.
Sherlock scampered off, pleased enough to be helping, and Mycroft popped the plastic cap on the pills. “Jawn,” he said, shaking out two pills and tossing them back into his mouth. “Did you get the salad?”
Sherlock, frustrated with his Grammy's lack of attention, stomped over to the toaster and flung the toast onto a plate.
Mycroft poked the baby's tummy; "One of your cakes is going to be missing it's frosting because you just ate it."
The little detective bounced on his heels, howling and desperately trying to rub the sting out of his bottom.
Sherlock frowned as he pulled his thumb out of his mouth, “I did...do; want it. It's just a huge...thing." He finished with a grimace.
, at midnight," Mycroft said, and shared a pointed look with Greg before casting a glance back at Sherlock, who was licking his fingers clean. "Throwing up will be incredibly painful right now," he whispered. "He's likely just eaten more in the last half hour than he has in the last several days combined."
"You're changing the next nappy where all that's turned to paste," Greg said teasingly as Mycroft taped up Sherlock's nappy and zipped his sleeper closed. "Should we leave'im there for now?" he added, lowering his voice to a whisper.
"That was the loveliest rain I've ever seen." Sherlock smiled brightly at him before shoving the paper valentine into his hands.
Sherlock blinked a few times, but seemed subdued by that answer. 'Because Daddy said so' was not a suitable answer for Sherlock's over active mind. He needed explanations and logical reasoning. Without those things, his brain would pick apart every ruddy thing that John said. He did not like that part. He just wanted to be little.
Greg nodded as he sat across from Sherlock, trying not to grin like an idiot as the baby licked crumbs off his fingers.
"I wasn't referring to you either, but thank you for giving yourself away. I know more than three people in the entire city."
"I di' y'it!" Jawn cheered as he let go of Sherlock's hand...and then started to clap. Neither man could get to him in time to stop him, but it only took him clapping once before Jawn stopped, looked down at his arm, then back up at Greg...and started to cry.
Sherlock picked up the two pill bottles sitting on the nightstand and turned to leave the room, while Greg could only watch. From across the room, he heard his lover sigh; "...What is going on."
"That can't be true...can it?" Greg stared at Mycroft as he licked his spoon and put it back in the macaroni.
"Where?!" He snarled, jerking open a drawer roughly and nearly doubling over when the sudden movement pulled at his healing ribs.
"And you know how he gets when he's t-i-r-e-d," Greg said, looking down at the floor where Sherlock had decided to settle, and watched him take a big bite out of his popsicle. Greg cringed; "God, how does that not hurt your teeth?!"
"Jawn, wait-!" Mycroft quickly took the fork and shoved the dripping bite of cake in his mouth before he could add black currant to the list of stains and smells on his bespoke suit.
Sherlock ducked his head and looked up at Mycroft through his lashes before accepting another bite of salad.
Sherlock stopped sinking to his knees and went still; “Dummy?” he repeated, blinking up at Mycroft with eyes full of unshed tears.
"That would be a thoughtful touch for Sally and all of her friends." Mycroft then helped himself to some of Sherlock's berries.
Sadie: That’s a very good point. 'John' would fight tooth and nail to keep that ‘tough guy’ exterior up around Mycroft…his is not a baby, should anyone need to be reminded. But, Sherlock
"Jawn. S'eps." Sherlock squeezed Jawn's hand. "One s'ep." Jawn wobbled but made it down the step. "Two s'ep." "F'ree s'ep." They proceeded down the steps at a glacial pace, Mycroft behind them and ready to grab the collar of Jawn's shirt, Greg in front ready to scramble and catch him. Neither little boy seemed aware. Counting all 'se'benteem' steps.
“We’ll find it after the movie ends,” Mycroft said, rolling Sherlock at an angle onto his side so he could still see the screen and popping his bottle back into his mouth before there were any more complaints. The little detective grunted and tried to spit it back out, but Mycroft was adamant; “Finish it.”
"It's quite clear what you want, little boy." John's voice is cool as he moves toward the bed. Sherlock tries to lean up and pull out of the toy but John's hand between his shoulder blades holds him in place as John tsks at him. "Might as well finish up little boy. And enjoy it, because this is the last time you get to cum for quite some time."
Mycroft raised his eyebrow and considered telling him 'no'...but then thought better. At least he was eating, and if Mycroft knew his brother (which he did), then this was probably the first time he'd eaten all day. "Is that a good biscuit, Jawn?"
Sherlock nodded and quickly made his way down the stairs to the second landing. The twice damned stool was still in one piece; crap old world construction, Sherlock thought to himself. He also made a quick inventory of the wall it had bounced off of before coming full stop on the landing. There were no marks to be seen. Hopefully that would help his case. His bottom involuntarily clenched at the thought.
Stepping out of the shower, he barely dries off. The glisten of his skin and his curls sticking to his brow are part of the plan. He wraps a towel low on his hips, making sure it hangs at the perfect angle. A final look in the mirror and Sherlock shakes his hair, beads of water flying everywhere. Yes, this plan is perfect. Not even John Watson can resist his careful calculations of sex appeal.
Sherlock had gone back to concentrating on the movie; "P'inger?" Sherlock tapped a finger against Mycroft's chest.
Sherlock took the cup in both hands and crawled over to Greg on his knees, then plopped down on his bottom next to him and watched as Greg took one of the bugs, placed it on the base of the toy, and started pushing buttons.
Sherlock grunted and pushed back against the man’s arms with little result, then fell back with an impatient huff and started tapping his fingers on the buttons to Mycroft’s waistcoat.
"They wou' be a'licious!" Sherlock hopped off the counter and let Greg guide his hands under the running tap.
Sherlock was fine with having his hands washed...in fact, he loved having his hands and fingers gently rubbed--but when it came time to wash his face, his nose wrinkled at the wet touch.
"Hmmm, is it this freckle right here?" G'eg poked one of the freckles on Sherlocks' neck, making him scrunch up like a turtle and squeak.
Greg sighed. "Yeah...yeah, you can. C'mere, sweetheart...let's give your hands and face a quick wash."
"You heard me," Sherlock raises his chin in a pitiful attempt of defiance. "This bedtime bit has got to go."
Jawn nodded, and Mycroft patted his back. "Thank you...you help me take such good care of the baby," he said, and carried the snuggling little tot back into the nursery.
“But you got it wrong!” Jawn held the umbrella out and thrust it at them in what Mycroft would have noted as a brilliant fencing move under any other circumstances.
“Because you…you both…” Sherlock gave up and pressed his lips together tightly. He hunched closer, burying his face in Mycroft’s shoulder.
we're done. All clean. Such a good job!" Greg praised, hoping to bring a smile back onto Sherlock's pouty little face.
“These p'ish are from the bottom of the ocean. Gotsa go ‘splorin the bottom of the sea.” Jawn took the red duck from Sherlock and pushed it beneath the water until it touched the bottom of the tub, then hooted with laughter as he released the duck and it splashed out of the water and out of the tub.
A firm hand between his shoulder blades pushes him forward until his face is level with the back of the sofa. “Stay.” Sherlock shivers when he hears the gentle swish of John taking off his belt.
"Presents before cake?" Greg bounced the baby and then put him in his booster, scooting it close to the table as the tray was in the dishwasher.
He watched to be sure Jawn went into time out as instructed before sitting at the table next to Sherlock, then added some vinegar to his own chips before popping one into his mouth. They were barely warm. Rotten kids messing up his lunch.
“I did. But do you remember the conversation we had this morning about teasing?” Mycroft pulled two lightweight sleepers out of their dresser. “You can always sit on the step as a reminder.”
Mycroft made his tea and went and settled into Sherlock’s chair, sinking into the faded leather. He sat with his tea to his lips, simply breathing in the steam for a quiet moment; the first moment of quiet since, oh God…since naptime???
The front door creaked open and Mycroft stepped delicately into the flat, the bag of take away from the all night diner down the street crinkling like mad. “Why are you two imps still on the sofa?!” he whispered.
“I wanted ice cream. I guess neither of us get what we want ‘cause you are naughty,” Jawn stuck his tongue out at Sherlock before turning his attention back to Mycroft.
Sherlock ignored her as he skidded into his room, snatching last night’s jumper off of his pillow. It was a hideous affair with a great white deer on it. He pressed the fabric to his face for a moment before slowly turning and heading back to Mrs. Hudson, who’d collected the bag of his belongings from the floor.
He moved down the line of cabinets, finding nothing, before growling at himself and starting over at the beginning, letting things fall out of the cabinets and onto the counter as he became more and more irate at his own uselessness.
Once dressed, Sherlock peeled the plaster off his eyebrow without looking at himself in the mirror. He tossed the plaster into the rubbish and turned out of the nursery with a determined air.
Greg made a face and undid Sherlock's nappy, thrilled as ever that there was no blood in it. "What kind of tricks do rats do?"
“Only because I know it’s already there.” Mycroft was quick to assure him. “No one else would think to look twice.”
Jawn bounced back onto his bottom, causing the springs in the sofa to groan. “It used to be bouncier,” he pouted.
Sherlock took up his big spoon with glee and got a heaping load of cereal on it. "Y'ook! Boo'tiful!"
“That’s my boy.” It passes over John’s lips as a mere whisper, and Sherlock looks up to see his Daddy coming undone, and he has not even pulled out the big guns. John wants a dirty mouth? Sherlock would give him a dirty mouth.
Sherlock covered the toy in bubbles and smiled up at Mycroft as the bubbles lit up from the inside. "My fa'brite."
Mycroft picked up his suitcoat from where it had been draped over the back of a chair and went to put it on, then paused, frowned, and sniffed a sleeve; “…How does this smell of baby powder??!” he whispered fervently, his nose wrinkling.
While Mycroft went right on with making Sherlock's sippy-cup, Greg busied himself with plating food for the three of them. He was giving each one a good, heaping portion of mac-and-cheese, when he felt someone grab the bottom of his shirt and lay their head on his shoulder. "You're supposed to be at the table," he said, smiling.
Greg rolled his eyes and put two more pieces of bread in the toaster, then got the blueberries back out. "Should we make a whole fairy village?"
Mycroft rolled his eyes and opened the door to reveal Molly Hooper standing on his stoop, with her big, black medical bag held in one hand. "Hello, Mr. Holm--Mycroft."
"Sweet boy," She cooed gently as she sat beside him on the sofa. "Your Daddy did not abandon you. You know better. I fancy that the good doctor is missing you just as much as you miss him right about now."
"Big'uns," Sherlock scurried away, having left his clovers on the bench next to Mycroft. "On'y four?" he hollered once he reached the flower beds.
After he made sure that G'eg had put ALL his rings back (and in the right order), Sherlock held up his arm and jiggled the bracelets together, grinning at the noise they made. He held his wrist up and shook them at his brother to show him. "Y'oud, My'cobb!"
Jawn glowed under such high praise. “He’s already in the biggest box in the flat. And he’s not allowed to touch the microscope when he’s little. He made that rule himself.”
Mycroft shook his head. “No, sorry lad…Jawn is getting one because he listened the first time, and cleaned up most of the mess on his own.”
“It’s especially distressing as we discussed why staying put was a safety precaution on the walk home…”
Mycroft took out his phone and snapped another picture…one more for the scrapbook. "Hurry up, boys, before the water gets cold.”
“Chew properly, with your mouth closed…no one wants to see that.” Mycroft speared a large bite of his own food…after all, this might just be his last chance for the day to eat a full meal while it was still warm.
"Ah-ah, it's my turn." Mycroft took Jawn next, sitting him on his hip. "Jawn Hamish," he scolded, though not-at-all seriously. "You know better than to vanish like that! Without telling anyone!" He brushed Jawn's hair back from his forehead, looking him over this way and that before kissing his cheek.
Sherlock sat on the side of the tub, giggling. "Nooooooooooo, he wouldn'!" he said, making grabby hands at the bottle of bubbles that Greg held.
"That's plenty, little man...eat your bread." Greg leaned over and poured some on Sherlock's plate. "D'you want your pizza now, baby?"
The baby paused with a handful of noodles halfway to his sauce-covered mouth and grinned at Greg. "Arrrrrrrrrrrr'shhhhhhhhhhhh."
"Wait for us, muffin!" Greg picked up two of the pots and Mycroft carried the third, and followed him
"Yes dear." Greg kissed Mycroft's cheek and then kissed Sherlock's hair before getting up. "You want anything for you?"
Greg picked up Jawn's sunglasses and put them on him. "In a bit, I promise," he said as he kissed Jawn's forehead, and then laid back on his chair.
Sherlock frowns, and had John been looking, he would have seen the detective stomp his foot a little. Sherlock huffs to himself and decides to move onto Plan B. The taller man flops back into his chair, being careful about the angle, making sure that John's laptop doesn’t block his view of the show to come. Looking up at the blonde haired doctor, Sherlock sucks in a breath at the thought of John catching him doing what he is about to do. The thought excites him and his pulse quickens and his breath hitches as he slides his long fingers down the damp skin of his stomach and under the towel.
The words and the firm hand on his prick are already starting to make Sherlock hard again, for which John is thankful. He isn’t done with his little boy yet. Far from it in fact.
John sighs loudly, his knee popping as he rises from the couch. "Let's fill your beaker, eh?" He gets down a plastic tumbler cup from the cupboard and fills it under the faucet. Once Sherlock takes a satisfied sip from the cup, John steers him back towards the bedroom. They repeat the process of being put to bed, including Sherlock listing ever reason why going to bed so early was irrational, and to John's surprise, unhealthy.
"The whole point of the gallery...the student program. There are several classes taught there, and each month they feature three students' work in an exhibition. The money goes to the program, and I get to keep my gallery profit-free."
John hummed softly. “You've told me how many times when you’re big, that you wanted a crib. And now it's here you're fighting me about it.” There was no heat behind his words.
"I don't want to put him to bed just yet, he's going to need more medication." Mycroft gave Greg's hand a squeeze and then let go.
Sherlock giggled; "Do no'd ki'g G'eg o'ber," he repeated, and pushed his foot into his wellie. "I y'ike a'bee."
Sherlock stopped wriggling just as he was halfway out of Greg's arms. He looked up at him and sniffled; "...Ar'ell?"
“What did I tell you when you first picked your prize?” Mycroft ignored the heat in the little doctor’s gaze and offered a hand to help Sherlock to his feet.
“‘Ron Man!” Sherlock bolted up, standing on the sofa. “My look! P'wetty ‘Ron Man!” Sherlock shook his bottle at the telly, spilling droplets of juice everywhere.
"Aww, sweet boy, what happened?" Greg plopped himself on the floor and carefully pulled Jawn into his lap. Jawn squealed when Greg touched his elbow. "We're going to have to go to the A&E." Greg kissed the top of Jawn's head. Sherlock stood in the doorway of the nursery, arms wrapped around himself, bawling.
Greg went and sat at the table,and then pulled the baby into his lap. "Poor, poor muffin. Such a tough night."
There was a beat pause on the line, and then John's voice came through...he sounded shocked that Sherlock had answered, and then cautious for the very same reason. “Sh-Sherlock? I--You, uh, what are you doing up at 4:30 in the morning?”
The continuous patting was starting to get on the baby's nerves when all he wanted was to lie back and listen to the story about Billy and Baxter, and he started to fuss. "Don' y'ike i'd, Myyyy," he whinged.
Sherlock chewed his fingers and watched as Greg squeezed out a small dollop of ointment on to the plaster. "Ou'ssy?"
"Be that as it may, we're still going to take a wash cloth to them." Mycroft urged Sherlock up and out of his seat. The baby dragged his feet over to Greg who was struggling not to laugh. "What a tough life, huh..."
Jawn walked over and flopped down onto the couch next to Mycroft. “You’ll see!” he grinned, looking rather cheeky as he spun the wheels on his car.
Sherlock struggled to answer. He knew that anything he said in this moment would appear childish. How could he tell John he didn't like the word because it made him feel little when that was the whole idea? He continued to wiggle around; frustrated with how the ability to access his extensive vocabulary seemed to disappear when he was on John's lap. "I just don’t like it."
“Sherlock…Sherlock…SHERLOCK.” The detective froze half way off of John’s lap and turned to stare wide eyed him. Daddy had never shouted at him before. “Have I ever done anything that would interfere with a case?” John’s voice softened as he watched Sherlock’s face crumple.  He rubbed a hand down the boy’s long spine. “Well? Have I?”
“If that’s the way you want to go about it, fine with me. You go stand in that corner,” Mycroft pointed to the opposite wall with his elbow. “And Jawn will go stand in the other-”
"D'yah want some help with that, muffin?" Greg asked as he and Mycroft approached with their flowers.
“Biscuit!” Sherlock demanded imperiously, but a cocked eyebrow from Mycroft had him shuffling in place. “Wasn’t hiding.”
Sherlock was on his belly in the guest-slash-sometimes-playroom, reaching under the bed. Then he scrambled back out, pulling a Tupperware container covered in stickers with him.
Sherlock popped up as if he were spring loaded. “Jawn! Jawn, Jawn, Jawn! Up, Jawn, up!” He wiggled to try and get out of Mycroft’s arms and into Jawn's. “My'coff! Jawn!”
“Ice cream?” Jawn peered up at him hopefully…hopeful about getting his ice cream, and hopeful that he could pull off ‘cute’ in the same way that Sherlock could to help him out.
“Yesss'sir.” Sherlock slurred, leaning heavily into Mycroft as the older man half walked, half carried him into the nursery.
"Ta'. I've worked very hard to make it that way." Greg stroked the uninjured side of the baby's face.
"Because if I hear one more thing about anyone tricking you, I'm bringing you right back up here. Do you understand?"
Greg carefully placed the padding of the plaster on Sherlock's stitches and then used strips he'd made to adhere it the plaster to his face. "Looks a bit like a Snoopy spider...it's very cute," he added, just in case the baby balked.
"You only wanna go by yourself so you can collect pamphlets for the next time I relapse. Mycroft has a whole drawer of them." Sherlock is too busy pouting to see the horror on John's face.
Sherlock nearly toppled out of the box in his haste to get to the proffered biscuits in Mycroft’s hands.
Mycroft taped up the front of Jawn’s nappy and got his sleeper back to rights. “...A bite probably wouldn’t hurt.”
"Where you having sweet dreams? Hmm," Greg sat half on the sofa, playing with Sherlock's hand. "Did you dream about pandas eating kung-fu ice cream cones?"
"A'licious," Sherlock tried to pop a piece of cereal into his mouth, missing his mouth entirely and losing it on the floor; "Oo'bs."
“Duck f'wy to da’ sink!” Sherlock half crawled out of the bathtub to capture the wayward captain and put him back under the water. “I try!”
Mycroft dumped the next cup of water over the indignant little detective without ceremony, his gaze now directly focused on the bath’s only other occupant. “Well, now there’s a surprise,” he said flatly, over Sherlock’s choking and spitting noises.
Mycroft took a corner of the flannel and gently pressed it to the Snoopy plaster above Sherlock's eyebrow.
"I know. But you won't help him by knocking him down by rushing. Deep breath," Mycroft took a deep breath, Sherlock followed a bit shakily. "Good boy. We must be gentle with Jawn for now. Alright?"
Greg made a huge show of sniffing the clover flower before putting it behind Sherlock's ear. "I'm sure there is? But I can go get if you want more."
Mycroft snuggled and fussed over his little brother while Greg ran and fetched his bunny from the nursery. "I know, I know you're terribly sad," he whispered in his ear. "But it's going to be all right...we'll fix it somehow."
Jawn gave him a beatific grin, the sauce on his eyelashes smudging against his cheeks. “I can have more, My'coff?” Jawn held his empty plate for Mycroft to see.
Mycroft sat Sherlock in the chair next to Jawn and swatted the other boy's hand, making him whine and release his hold. "You didn't think to get the booster?"
Sherlock laid the worm on the edge of his cup, then stared at his spoon. “…You do it?” he asked innocently, and Mycroft had a difficult time saying ‘no’.
Greg came back in and tossed the stuffed animal onto the bed within Mycroft's reach, then continued to the bathroom on the other side of the room.
Once in the bedroom John directs him to the bed, "Up you get." Sherlock crawls onto the mattress on his hands and knees, glancing back over his shoulder at John through his curls.
“No, they don’t…every crew needs a captain." Mycroft kept his eye glued to the signal across the street, silently calling it every name in the book while willing it to change. He kept his arm around Sherlock’s waist, underneath his coat, and alternated between patting and rubbing the small of his back.
"Well I would be a bit agitated too, so you must forgive your poor Daddy," she said as she tucked the bread into the toaster. She pressed the lever and turned back to Sherlock.
"Carefu'," Sherlock nodded as he half-dragged, half-carried Jawn out into the hallway and toward the stairs.
Greg filled the watering can and brought it back. Sherlock had gone limp and weepy in Mycroft's lap.
Greg carefully tried to pull the yellow opera glove back off Sherlock's hand, mindful of the many prongs on the rings. "Yea', course not. That would have been easy."
"That's a nice ending." Greg quietly stole into the nursery and came to crouch beside them, with a hand on the chair for balance. "...I'm sorry I reacted that way," he said, speaking lowly.
"I think everyone has learned their lesson," Greg scooped the stuffies off the step, "Let's go finish our film."
"I bet he'll like that." Greg started to pat his back, hoping to get Sherlock to sleep so he could turn off this creepy excuse for a children's movie.
"Ye-" Mycroft stopped mid-word, head whipping around to see the cheekiest grin. "You monstrous little brat."
“I know; I heard you the first time, lad.” Mycroft felt Sherlock’s legs start to buckle and grasped his elbow to keep him from having a full-blown meltdown right on the sidewalk.
Greg sighed. "I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart. I was teasing." He cut the heat down under the pasta and opened the oven. "Dinner's ready."
"My'coff had'da ba' d'eam?" Sherlock reached over with one hand and patted his brother's hip. "My'coff okay?"
“A'cause, a'cause Jawn would do whatever it takes to get the bad guys. An’ he was small before, an’ he was still the bravest.”
"That would make them 'blobs-of-airy-dough'-cakes instead of cupcakes." Mycroft tweaked Sherlock's nose.
"I y'ooooove po'scicles, G'eg. We can have mo'?" Sherlock stood up and let Greg use the detachable shower head to rinse off the last of the bubbles and grass.
“But what does that mean?!” Sherlock whinged, hopping along behind Mycroft and putting his hands on his big brother’s shoulders like a game of leap-frog.
"I see. You can keep your treasures sweetheart, but next time ask before you add to your collection, hm?"
Mycroft rested his chin on top of a mop of curls. “We never say these things,” he said, then paused; “...the most important ones.” He ran a steadying hand down Sherlock’s back, feeling him tremble. “There is no one on this Earth more important to me than you. And, I know for a fact, John feels the same.”
He gathered four plastic cups and ran a little water into each one, then searched out and found the box of food colouring from the high shelf in the pantry.
A stinging slap to his thigh causes him to gasp and he’s finally able to focus on Daddy's face, which, belatedly, Sherlock realizes is a mistake. The look on John's face, equal parts love, possessiveness, and ferocity is Sherlock's undoing.
“No, these have to be washed first, or they’re going to taste of metal. You need a safer hiding spot, little boy.” Mycroft started towards the kitchen to do just that.
He did not answer. His face was turned to the window, his features falling into shadow and rising again into light as we passed beneath the streetlamps, through the silent streets, hushed beneath the cold. I could not catch his expression. His soft-gloved hand rested on his knee, inches from my own. I could have placed my hand atop his, stroked it, pressed my knee to his in comfort. I did not move at all. Something was just then occurring to me. “You found you didn’t care for kissing her, and that surprised you. Hadn’t you ever before…?” I faltered. I didn’t know how to find my way through the thought without embarrassment, but he compressed his lips and looked at me, finally.
“Within reason,” I said, realizing the potential dangers. “We need to be alert. In case of anything.” What I meant was in case of the box, which is in my pocket, finding its way into my hand, and the words I needed to say to him finding their way into my mouth. Which felt impossible. But I make a habit of doing impossible things, periodically. It keeps me on my toes. If I could just convince myself this was worthwhile-disrupting things.
So things continued. We lived together, and worked together more and more: I found it brightened him up, and that brightened me up. The black moods I’d always been prone to lost half their force under the influence of his attention; my hardest cases came clear twice as quickly with him near. And then he went on writing about us, which was flattering to my feelings as well as to his pocketbook, for the stories kept on selling. He began to be able to go out with me for a little music and a drink, now and again. He began to look at me longer, and to sit nearer to me in the evenings; and I thought we were making headway. I thought we could be happy.
“My dear fellow,” I said, and stood to look him in the eye. He blinked before my gaze. His outrage wavered, his eyes fell. I reached out a careful hand, to rest upon his thin shoulder; held him firmly through the soft, worn silk of his rainy-day dressing gown. Sometimes he needed mooring. “Why didn’t you tell me you had another brother? I should have liked to know him sooner.”
Helpless, I watched it hit him. He jolted, and blanched; stood a moment, with parted lips; took two steps backwards, and lowered himself into his chair. I watched his gentle hands curl tightly round the arms of it, the little callouses on his fingers standing out white. Then he let go, deliberately, and stretched out his hands slowly, and placed them on his knees.
“Now you have,” I said. He was facing me without pretense, angry and grieving, so I looked back and let him see me loving him, and said, “What do you want to do?”
At last the fall of stones stopped. I lay scarcely daring to breathe, till I heard his footsteps going away slowly, and then all was still.
On the third evening, the telegram came: the whole of Moriarty’s company, of any significance, was in custody. But Moriarty had escaped.
I glanced beside me, but his expression was wholly absent. “Did you hear that your brother had taken up with Cox?” I asked, when he remained silent.
Over lunch he behaved like his ordinary self, but consciously; as though he were determined to amuse us both. I allowed myself to be amused, half in relief that he was finally with me, half in homage to the effort he was making: I had known the day would be difficult. But he kept me out with him for hours, between food, and banter, and drinks, and a stop over at a book shop, and a side excursion for a fresh pig’s liver, on the way home--I thought it better not to inquire into that. When we arrived in Baker Street again the sun had sunk halfway toward the horizon. The city was bathed in light.
