thought about this,” Tony remarked, his gaze flickering between Steve’s face and the container in his hand.
is going to happen in the future doesn't matter!  All that matters to me is what happens right here, right now.”
Steve obeyed, crashing their lips together in a kiss that had none of the finesse their first kiss had.
So out of the dozens and dozens of first dates, there are maybe a handful of second and third dates, and of
Steve left with Sam whenever they got a lead on the Winter Soldier’s whereabouts, sometimes taking Natasha with them, but they never came back with any luck.  Tony helped when he had time, despite Steve’s protests: they never spoke about the assassin’s likely involvement in his parents’ deaths, but if Tony could find a way to help, there was no stopping him.
After mating with Steve, and a well deserved beat up from Bucky, that ended with The Hulk holding Bucky away from me, I discovered that Steve was aware that I was unsure about us being mates.
“Are you hiding from the crowd too?” He didn’t answered, so the guy continued.  “Don’t’ worry, I don’t like crowds either… isn’t it nice they left the art studio unlocked?”  More silence.  “Sorry, you probably don’t want to hear me talking. I’ll just be over there.”
"Hello, gorgeous, I’m Tony." I said with my best smile, waiting for a handshake, or, better yet, a chance to feel his skin on mine.
All I ever wanted was to be loved by a strong and confident Alpha that would treasure me, but would, still, challenge me and understand that I want to be seen as an equal and not as some weak Omega… even if that is what I am.
When I was eighteen I had accomplished everything… except presenting as an Alpha… or as anything, for that matter.
So Steve just didn’t know how a cellular phone worked. The last one he had used had a little cap, for fuck’s sake.
It’s on Tony’s file that he’s a playboy with no desire to find a mate… and he wants to mate with me.
His face was even more glorious now than before. He tried to cover his mouth, to stop the noise from coming out, but I was having none of that. I wanted to hear him. I pinned up his hands above his head, knowing that if he felt unconfortable he had the strenght to break lose… but he didn’t.
“You went to my room and read me your wedding vows.” He answered me, with tears forming in his eyes.
Tony looked outside and there was a small blue bird outside the window. The brunette couldn’t help but think that the bird’s blue feathers were no match for that blonde’s beautiful blue eyes.
There was silence, while Steve took off the phone from the box and looked at t as if trying to pierce holes through it. Minutes went by with Steve turning the phone around, shaking it and piercing more invisible holes thorough it, until he finally said:
"Steve, I know you’re scared. Tomorrow you might die. You still have time to back out if you want to. But before doing so, I want you to remember how weak and sick you are. You’re ugly, and a poor excuse of an Omega. This procedure might kill you, but it’s your last chance to find that Alpha you’ve always dreamed of. So, before making your choice, remember: no one will love you if you’re unattractive."
“You’re not just a CEO, Pepper. You’re my best friend.” He said pulling the best puppy eyes a man in his 30’s could.
I’m a mutant, and it’s very rare for mutants to get adopted. Plus I’m already 10 years old, what makes it even harder to get adopted, ‘cause everyone wants a normal baby, not a 10 year old mutant.
But when the invasion came, a biggest fear arose: the fear of losing Steve without letting him know he was mine.
“Yeah, it’s definitely going to art program I just received a message from Mr. Stark’s CEO saying that their making the donation to the art program. Also Mr. Stark won’t be present at the ceremony… He’s a busy man.”
Mr. Stark was the most arrogant and handsome Alpha I’ve met so far. He was a genius and he knew it. Despise his arrogance; he was everything I wanted on an Alpha. The only problem was the way he looked at me: like a lab rat he can’t wait to experiment on.
I knew Stark’s father: Howard, and Howard was a horrible Alpha. And Tony? He’s might be worse… No. I’m being unfair. He’s not like Howard. Even though he made clear he doesn’t like me, he still gave me shelter, arranged me therapy and tries to befriend me… but still…
And then, one day, while running through my father’s office, I found, at the bottom of a drawer, an old photograph.
“Remember at our wedding, when you got nervous because you were afraid I would leave you, because you thought you weren’t going to pull off the whole mate thing? Remeber what I did, right before we got married.”
I was so focused on being happy with Tony; I guess I forgot to think what I would do when he found his real Omega.
“Call me Tony.”  He said extending his hand for a handshake, which was gladly taken by the blond. “So, what’s your opinion on this event?”
I feel Bucky’s arms around me, but I don’t want Bucky to hug me! I don’t want Bucky at all. I just want Tony…
No, Tony was not okay. He was about to get dumped by an 18 year old beautiful man! Of course he was not okay!
“Why do you even have a photo of me before the serum in your wallet?” There’s a pause, in which my brain is still trying to reboot. “Were you waiting for a chance to mock me?”
I hate him! Therefore, I’m not letting him near any Omega, if I can help it. Especially knowing how obsessed with Captain America this guy really is.
And with that, the student (Tony assumed it was a student, since it was wearing S.H.I.E.L.D.’s school uniform) sat on the other far end of the room, took out a notebook from his bag and started drawing.
And Tony though he had made progress in lighting the mood… but, as usual, he kept talking because this student was really the cutest man alive; and who need a filter anyway?
When I was a teenager, right after presenting, I knew right away that the man on my father’s picture was my mate.
And moments after, there he was: Steve Rogers, in all his glory; or in all the glory you can have when you are where sweat pants and carrying two shopping bags.
I can hear the sound of Tony’s voice, even thought I can’t make up what he’s saying, but his voice sounds so loud and seems so desperate, that I can’t help but to feel guilt rush over me. I didn’t give him time to say nothing. I assumed everything wrong and didn’t give him a chance to explain himself.
According to Bucky, they were talking when, all of the sudden Steve started crying and calling for me. I can tell by the way he’s looking at me that he’s not telling me everything. Guilt is written all over his face!
I thought I had posted Chapter 6 already, but, today, when I was going to post Chapter 7 I noticed that I didn't put the previous chapter here.
"Is that your motto? ‘Cause, if it is, I gotta say, I don’t quite like it. You should choose a new one. " I get up, with anything but grace, as I heard Tony’s voice. "Here, I brought you roses. They’re red, like the American flag… well, part of the American flag. Do you like roses? Of course you like roses. Everyone I know likes roses. Except Romanoff, but I not even sure if she like anything… well anything but my company’s CEO, you know… ‘cause they’re married… And why am I still talking? Why didn’t you interrupt me yet?" He says.
I’m feeling very confused with his words… I mean, I know the man in the picture is beautiful, and I know that Steve has a low self esteem, but how could he think I would be able to love this man more than him?
“I bet you all had quite a laugh out of my expenses. I always though your father was the worst Alpha I’ve ever met… but it seems like the worst was actually you all along.”
“Well… Mrs. Gonzalves says he looks just as handsome as her husband, so every time I think of Mr. Stark I picture Mrs. Gonzalves husband.”
“No! I just work for Stark Industries.”  He answered quickly… Why was he lying? Well, he wasn’t really lying; he did work for Stark Industries. But still… it felt like lying.
“Just have it delivered with this card to the address that I’m texting you as we speak.” He said pushing the card onto the CEO’s hands.
I haven’t seen Steve in two months and when he finally came back from his mission, he comes back with an Alpha.
“Hm… maybe.”  Tony takes a bite out of another cookie and holds the plate out towards Steve. “Want one?"
Steve shrugs and takes one for himself: so what if he already ate over a dozen while baking them only a few hours prior?  They were still delicious.
Tony just couldn’t resist walking into a store and buying a dozen red velvet cupcakes from Sprinkles, or a box of vanilla buttercreams from Magnolia Bakery. Hell, he had even sent Happy on the equivalent of late-night Tampax runs for some of the sugary, baked goods.
And given how nosy their teammates were, Steve was surprised they had been able to keep it a secret for so long.
Steve gradually sped up his thrusts until the room was filled with the sounds of their breathing and the skin-on-skin slap of sex.  All Tony could do was try his best to hold on as Steve continued to take him apart.  His hands roamed over Steve’s arms, his shoulders, sliding across Steve’s chest and down his backside urging his movements.
"Yeah, that’d be nice,” Tony answers. “Is this the part where we kiss and make up or something?” he jokes.
“All right, kids,” Steve said, dragging Tony out of the room, “your parents are going to bed, so don’t stay up too long.”
“You’re just wasting those good looks of yours, Rogers.  You could literally get anyone to date you.”
Steve pours himself a cup, and then reaches over and tips Tony’s up so it’s level before filling it up, too.  Then he sets aside the carafe and takes a step forward that catapults Tony’s heart into his throat.  Steve’s eyelashes are dark blond and longer than any Tony’s ever seen.  They drift up, revealing the bright blue of his eyes.
Steve didn’t even get the chance to respond before Tony shut the door, the click of the lock resounding in the quiet room.
Pepper’s words echoed in his head, and he had to admit that she was right.  Tony knew that if anything transpired between him and Steve—or any other members of the team, for that matter— they would never let it affect how they worked together on the field.
Steve shrugged.  “Occasionally… I mostly just sketched, or worked with charcoal.  Paints were expensive—still are—but moreso back then.”
Tony responds by leaning in and capturing Steve’s lips with his own. The kiss is soft and unhurried: so undeniably perfect.  Tony will never forgive himself for denying them this for months.
Thor waves him off. “Asgardian mead is a fine drink,” he says jovially, “Its intoxicating effect is merely an additional draw.” His smile widens as he pushes a stein into Steve’s hands. “Drink! You will see.”
“More than you’ve told me apparently,” Rhodey said, leaning against the desk. The expression on his face softened. “What’s up?”
He works his hips faster, letting Steve’s cock slip out of his hole almost entirely before slamming back down again.  He knows he’ll be sore in the morning, but it’s worth it to see Steve begging for release.
“I had fun,” Tony said sincerely. “I honestly can’t remember the last time I enjoyed myself that much.”
of the spoon against the mug as Steve stirs in the milk and sugar.  It probably should’ve been awkward, but Tony’s glad to find that it isn’t in the slightest.
,” Steve says again, a smile on his face. “s’not the medicine.”  He makes a motion for Tony to move closer, and after some hesitation, Tony complies. “Tony.”
"And when I came by the other day, you took in four cars: all of which, aren’t in this shop anymore,” Steve continues, gesturing to the empty side of the garage.
Steve blindly reached up and awkwardly patted Tony on the head. “Talk in th’mornin,’” he muttered before his breathing evened out again.
“It got you, didn’t it?” Steve countered, rolling his hips again and pleased to find his lover just as aroused as he was.  His fingers slipped under the material of Tony’s shirt, sending a shiver down the man’s spine.
about this?  Bulldozer just headbutted you into the Lyceum Theater.  Do you know how thick that skull of his is?”
Tony starts, obviously surprised that Rhodey is awake, which is actually ridiculous because it’s well past noon, and Rhodey’s been known to go to his 8am classes after being out all night with his fraternity brothers.
Sam ignored him and took a seat on the other end of the couch. “I heard you blew off the date that Natasha set up for you.”
More than anything, Tony wants to believe him, but he knows that it can’t happen.  He’s hurt everyone that has ever cared about him, and he’ll be damned if he hurts Steve in the same way.
“I’ve learned that things rarely go the way you want it to, but we can still make the best of what we’ve got.  I want this, and I know we’re going to have to work on it, but it’ll be worth it—and if we make mistakes along the way, there’s not much else we can do but learn from them.  I already made the mistake of waiting too long once, Tony, and I… I
“What?  It’s better than 'Jim,’” Tony defended.  He scratched behind the cat’s ear again. “What do you think?  Do you approve?” Tony asked, getting another purr in response.
, Mr. Stark,” Rumiko said playfully. “I saw the way you were looking at him.  My father used to look at my mother the same way.”
Steve stirs from his fitful slumber when he hears someone knocking on his door.  He rubs the sleep from his eyes and climbs out of bed, surprised to find Tony standing outside his room.
By the time Steve emerged from the bathroom, dressed only in a pair of threadbare pajama pants, Tony had already compiled a list of potential date locations in the city.
Sure, Tony Stark may not show affection in the same flashy, brazen manner he does everything else, but Steve wouldn’t have it any other way.
Tony glances towards the back of the jet, and Steve must understand his silent plea if the way he stands up and retreats to the secluded corner is any indication.  Tony gets to his feet and follows wordlessly, ignoring the stares from the other occupants of the jet.
Okay, so that was kind of a low blow, but Tony understood where he was coming from.  It wasn’t often that Rhodey could take leave and visit, and Tony had only seen him for a grand total of twenty minutes since he arrived. “I have a lot of work to do,” he said lamely.
Steve couldn’t help it—he leaned forward and pressed their lips together. His arms instinctively wrapped around Tony’s waist, pulling the man closer until Steve could feel the hard edge of Tony’s R.T. node against his own chest.  Tony had always been self-conscious of it, but Steve didn’t mind—it was a reminder of Tony’s brilliance, that Tony was alive, his heart beating beneath the glass surface.
Steve just smiled, not bothering to dignify Tony with a response and instead fixing his attention out the window, and the two fell into companionable silence.
of Tony’s affection.  It’s silly because it’s been almost five years, but Tony still hasn’t completely wrapped his head around the fact that Steve’s chosen
Tony pulls back to look him in the eye. “I love you," he declares.  "I love you so much.  I love you, and I'm sorry it took so long for me to finally say it, but—”
"No, but go ahead if you feel compelled to do so, because I guarantee you that for every reason you tell me we shouldn’t be together, I can give you five for why we
“Well, it seems that you walked away all right.”  The words left his mouth before he could even register them.
“Incredible,” Natasha says. “Something new I didn’t learn about you undercover.  Will wonders never cease?”
Steve’s breathing was labored now.  “Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time.”  With a grunt, he picked up his axe and brought it down on another log with much more force than necessary.
Prompt: Tony is a highly sought-after mechanic who can fix anything fairly quickly... except whatever Steve drags in to him (but that might be on purpose).
Tony made a mental note to send a couple dozen more vanilla buttercreme cupcakes to Rumiko for being such wonderful company (and another dozen to Pepper for the ten voicemails she had left on his phone).
Between breakfasts consisting of waffles or pancakes slathered in copious amounts of syrup, and doughnuts for lunch, and dinners always followed by some sort of dessert (and usually post-dessert
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose. “Something always happens when the two of you conspire against me.”
“Sure you don’t need any help?” Tony calls after him, and Steve’s just sober enough to bite back a reply of:
“Says the man that didn’t even pay for them,” Tony retorts, taking Steve’s hand and letting him be escorted towards the water. “They’re my favorite pair.  You’re lucky I’m a billionaire or else you’d be getting an earful.”
He may have hated magic, but he still couldn’t help the tiny pang of disappointment when all he felt was a light breeze.
The next few hours of Steve’s life is a blur: he remembers Reed counting down the seconds before sending Steve back.  He remembers finding himself in the middle of Times Square, about half a block from where the accident had happened, and then he remembers running.  He remembers diverting Tony away from the villain, remembers the confusion in Tony’s face when he looks back where he was standing in time to see the bomb detonate.
“Honestly, you two probably have a good chance of working, but if he can’t see that, then he’s an idiot for walking away. One day, you’ll find someone out there who willappreciate
However, when he raises his hand to input his access code into the panel, he catches a glimpse of blond hair toward the back of the workshop.  There are at least a dozen dimmed holograms littered around the room, so it’s kind of hard to see, but Bruce is 100% positive that the man standing next to the work bench is their team leader.
“We hang out all the time, and we have fun together.  We already have sex, it really wouldn’t be all that different.”
“I still don’t understand why you ever thought that was a good idea,” Natasha muttered under her breath.
He asks because he gets a feeling that Tony’s reactions to his public displays of affection may have had more to do with uneasiness than a mere quirk, and the last thing he wants to do is make Tony feel uncomfortable.  But when Steve brings it up in conversation, Tony brushes it off like it’s nothing, and assures Steve that he
“Are you really that close?” Tony asks even though he knows the answer.  There have been multiple instances in which Steve’s orgasmed just from watching
It makes Steve fall in love with Tony just a little bit more, and he kisses the man in lieu of a response.
usually the ones th—” Steve stopped himself. “Is this really an appropriate conversation to be having over breakfast?” he asked exasperatedly.
“What’s wrong with the—Oh.” Natasha blinks and reads the top of the paper again. “Oh, wow. Oooookay,” she drawls, “I guess you’re allowed to freak out a bit.
“Can you go with me to the restaurant just in case?  I could give you a signal that things are going well, blah blah blah."
Steve doesn’t think much of the incident until he kisses Tony over dinner at one of their favorite restaurants.  While Tony doesn’t make an undignified noise this time, his face still turns cherry red.  Then, when Steve takes his hand as they walk around the city, the man looks almost
“Yes,” Bruce replies as he and Thor enter the room as well. “You two are more than welcome to join so long as the PDA stays at a PG rating.”
And when Tony gets back from work, Steve pushes him up against the wall of their bedroom and tells him about this thing he read about on the internet, and Tony never thinks twice about going along with it.
Tony wishes his repulsors weren’t damaged in the fight, because the last thing he wants to do is have this conversation.  He takes a step back. “Steve… I can’t—”
“The drink itself is not what inebriates the drinker.   The drink merely adjusts itself to the drinker’s desires: it will not do anything that you do not want it to,” Thor explains.
“Steve isn’t a saint,” Rhodey said. “Neither is Pepper.  They’re just people, and sometimes people just don’t mesh well together.  Did your repulsors work the first time you tried building them?” “No.”
“You’re probably right.” Steve sat up and muted the television. “I want to thank you again for inviting me out here.  I don’t think I’ve ever travelled anywhere that wasn’t under the pretense of work… and the presidential suite is very nice,” he added.
But then he hears Tony zooming over his head before touching down next to him on the pavement.  Tony takes off his helmet, and when their eyes meet, Steve’s breath catches: he can’t believe it.  He did it.
“I dunno,” Tony says noncommittally. “You’re always singing these types of songs, even when you don’t realize it… and whenever I hear them, I think of you.”
Steve rolls them back over, capturing Tony’s lips in a sweet kiss.  He tries to reciprocate the feelings that Steve pours into the kiss, but it’s so overwhelming that Tony can’t do anything but ground himself by holding onto Steve’s shoulders.  Tony falls asleep with Steve’s arms wrapped around him protectively, both of them boneless and utterly spent.
Tony gripped the sheets as Steve set a punishing pace, riding him good and hard.  Tony could feel something deep in him stir, and he muttered a curse when he realized that his cock was hardening again.
Steve digs into his pocket, takes out the handful of hundreds that Tony had given him earlier, and slips them into Tony’s hand.  He leaves a lingering kiss on the corner of the man’s mouth and tells him to call if he’s ever in need of Steve’s services again.
There was a small crowd of reporters outside the tower, but Tony ignored them, seamlessly pulling into the garage and parking the car next to Steve’s bike.  They sat in the car for a few moments, Tony’s hands still gripping the steering wheel.
under his breath, and then hissing in pain when Natasha and Bruce elbow his side.  Thor brings his own drink to his lips, quietly observing as he lounges on the couch.
“Great,” Steve said in turn.  He went over to the cart and poured a cup of coffee for himself before taking a seat on the edge of the bed.
“I… I’m sorry, Ty.”  He really is, because Ty is charming and very handsome, and Tony is very much attracted to him, but: “I just… I don’t think I’m up for anything more tonight.”
One morning, Tony walks into the kitchen and finds a giant bouquet of flowers at his seat at the table.  To the delight of Steve, as well as the other Avengers, Tony actually
He learned about Clint‘s adamant refusal to eat soggy cereal, and his preference for 2% milk.  He learned that Natasha liked to cut her spaghetti because of the mess that sometimes resulted in twirling it.  He learned that Thor has had an obsession with Motown ever since Erik Selvig introduced him to it (he likes to sing to The Supremes in the shower).  He learned that Tony drank a double-shot of espresso in the morning, a cappuccino in the afternoon, and a cup of decaf with cream and one sugar before bed.
He desperately wanted to sleep, and he was grateful that Steve understood his need for contact. After the team had moved into the tower, and after he and Pepper had broken things off, Tony had confessed to Steve that it was almost impossible for him to sleep when he was ridden with anxiety.  It had only gotten worse ever since the team was first assembled—their line of work wasn’t exactly a walk in the park, especially since they had to bear the burden of the earth’s security on their shoulders every day.
"A few things,” Steve says, “if the complaints from my neighbors are anything to go by.  I’m just glad they have the decency to confront me about it directly instead of telling my mom."
Steve made his way to the opposite wall, examining the single photo that had now taken the mural’s place: it was taken Christmas morning, with all of the Avengers piled on a large arm chair.  They were still in their pajamas and wearing ridiculous themed hats, wrapping paper strewn at their feet.  Jane, who had been visiting, insisted that the team take a photo of their first Christmas together.  Clint, who was perched on the back of the chair, and Thor, who was standing behind it, were giving each other bunny ears.  Natasha was seated on one of the arms; her feet dangling off the edge.  Bruce was sitting on the floor trying to clean up the mess of paper.  Steve sat in the middle with Tony on his lap.
Sam can’t resist the open opportunity, so he snaps a quick picture on his phone and attaches it to a mass e-mail.
He was just surprised the two of them haven’t tried their hand at world domination yet—not that they ever would because they weren’t
“If you had to choose between me or cupcakes, what would you choose?” Steve asks, watching Tony remove the paper liner of one of the baked goods.
that no matter what happens, Steve will have his back, and Steve’s never done anything to make him doubt that.  Tony relishes every single touch, every hand on his shoulder, and every embrace.  Eventually he starts seeking out the warmth he feels when their knees touch while sitting on the couch and watching television.
On their third date, Tony had brought Steve a bouquet of red and yellow roses.  Their colors stand for romance and friendship respectively, but Steve’s pretty sure Tony had mainly picked them because they match his armor.
It’s obvious that Steve’s exhausted from the way he’s dragging his own feet: his suit is rumpled from sitting on the plane, there are circles under his eyes, and Tony thinks he may even look a little thinner (Steve can have the appetite of twenty men, but he often forgets to eat on very busy work days).
“You’re not fine,” Steve said lowly, but loud enough for Tony to hear. He braced a hand on the side of the shed, bending over slightly to block some of the rain. “We’re both tired and hurt and not thinking clearly, and we probably shouldn’t be having this conversation now, but I know that I shouldn’t have said that.  I know you’re not like them, Tony.”  He used his other hand to tip Tony’s chin up, and Tony just glared balefully at him. “I’m sorry I didn’t think to stay in touch with you. I should have,” Steve said regretfully. “I’m not going to make any more excuses for myself, because I know there are a lot of things I have to work on.  But I need to know that we’re both on the same page.”
Steve bypasses them all and heads for the exit, taking the long way around by walking along the perimeter of the room.  He takes one last glance around the ballroom before slipping out into the lobby of the hotel.
He looks over at Steve, who’s sitting just a few feet away from him, his face illuminated by the rays of the early morning sun.
Tony groaned and shoved his fingers into Steve’s hair, messing up the sodden blond locks with clumps of mud that went unnoticed. “Steve,” he whined, keening as his fingers tugged at Steve’s head. “Steve, baby, please.”
To say he's surprised is an understatement, but then Natasha and Clint head straight to the kitchen, not even batting an eyelash at the sleeping couple.
It isn’t until after his kidnapping and subsequent return to the states that Tony actually believes it’s a lost cause.  If Tony couldn’t trust the man who was his father-figure for over half of his life, what was he supposed to make of anyone else that tried to get close to him?  Stane had tried to kill him.  His own parents never paid a speck of attention to him.  His exes only stayed with him long enough to get what they wanted out of him.
Tony over the moon that Steve wants him—maybe Steve doesn’t want him in the same way that Tony does, but Tony’s perfectly okay with just spending time with him.
It was hard to believe that the other day, Steve had looked like every bit of the ninety-eight years he was supposed to be, but now…
they didn’t know about it.  (Then again, he couldn’t really hope for much when he lived with two spies, especially with one who never knew when to shut his mouth, and another who was an incurable gossip.)
Tony knew from the beginning that getting romantically involved with a celebrity was going to have its drawbacks.  He long-ago accepted that he probably wouldn’t be able to live the normal life he always dreamed of as a child, but after going on that first date with Steve, he realized that
“You continuously tried setting Steve up with people for the first month we were dating,” Tony says dryly. He would’ve been more annoyed, but he knows how he and Steve look–they aren’t exactly a conventional couple, not when Steve’s the head of a multi-billion dollar technology company and Tony’s a broke college student.
“Your track record says otherwise.” Tony started up the car. “Of the two of us, who flew a plane into the ocean?”
Tony must have felt Steve’s gaze because he looked up from his tablet.  “What?  Do I have something on my face?” he asked, frowning.
Tony straddles the other man’s lap and licks a stripe of frosting off of his cheek. “And you are absolutely delicious.”
Of course, he was still tied to a chair, and he wasn’t a particularly huge fan of the gun being pointed at his head, but luckily, the entire situation was over within another few hours.
Steve felt himself blush as the memories of last night came flooding back.  Nothing could have prepared Steve for that night: kissing Tony, touching him, holding him, being inside him… It was unlike any other night Steve had ever had, and he was sure the image of Tony coming apart underneath him would be forever ingrained in his memory.
Tony kept his eyes on Steve’s face, anxiously watching each shift in expression and burning the images into his mind, as if he’d never get to see it again. Steve managed to haul a hand up to Tony’s shirt. He twisted his fingers in the fabric and pulled Tony back into something that wasn’t quite a kiss, but more a co-mingling of their breaths.
“He’s talking about the fact that you two have been doing an awful job at hiding your little secret,” Natasha supplied.
“As utterly adorable as you two look,” Sarah says from the doorway, “I’m afraid we are going to be late for our reservations if we don’t head over there now.”
“I’d be more than happy to go on a quest for water—” “That really won’t be necessary,” Natasha assured.
“The man you love,” she corrected. “I’m glad to have seen a bit of the real Tony Stark, and not just the Tony Stark that the media portrays you as.”
It isn’t something that Tony is proud, nor ashamed, of.   It was merely a fact: just a statement of truth.
“Right,” Tony said as the band finished the song. “No one should be disappointed, especially tonight.  Tonight is a happy occasion.”
“Well, it can’t be Steve,” Clint said, as if pointing it out as the most obvious thing in the world.
“You want to date me,” Tony said incredulously, getting a nod in return. “That is a terrible idea.” “
“That’s funny,” Steve says, running his hand over the blue paint, “because my roommate brought her bike in here the other day for the same problem, and you had it fixed in under an hour.”  He looks at Tony expectantly.
Having run out of options, Tony sidled up to Bruce.  He knew Bruce wasn’t fond of these types of outings, but Tony really didn’t want to drive out to the Hamptons by himself to look at
In fact, he loves it when Steve looms over him, and loves that Steve could easily overpower him because he feels protected.  And Steve’s made it very clear that he would never let anything happen to Tony.  Ever.
He was clothed in a pair of fleece pajama pants, wool socks, and a long-sleeve t-shirt, but he couldn’t suppress the shiver that wracked through his body.  It didn’t help that his side of the bed gave him a bird’s eye view of the city which, while breathtaking, was covered in a thick blanket of fresh, white snow.
So Pepper personally escorts Tony to the restaurant situated just two blocks away from the tower.  And Pepper is the one that inquiries about the reservation to the maitre d.  Pepper is the one that guides him through the large dining area to the smaller, more intimate private space towards the back of the room.
Steve smiled triumphantly. “That’s what I thought.  Oh, here’s the cat!” he said excitedly as it approached. “Hey, fella.  Wanna say ‘hi’ to Tony?”
Clint’s face looked like a mix between frustration and disappointment. “So you two really aren’t an item?” he asked.
He knows that he’s lucky to have Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy in his life.  But they had their own lives, and his relationships with them were established so long ago that anything more would never be a possibility.  Regardless, Tony has learned to be okay with it, and begins to resign himself to a life of solitude.
“Yeah, I… Sorry, Steve.  I’ve been trying to fix it,” Tony says. “Really, I have.  It’s just—These guys are absolute
He spit into the sink and rinsed out of his mouth before stepping into the shower.  He washed himself quickly and efficiently, drying off with a towel before hastily wrapping it around his waist and leaving the en suite.
Tony wasted no time in stripping down and stepping into the shower that JARVIS had prepared for him.  He didn’t realize how much he had been working lately until he felt his muscles start to relax under the hot water.
Feeling slightly dizzy from the lack of oxygen, Steve broke apart from the kiss.  “Tony,” he started, pressing their foreheads together.
"You don’t have to keep doing that, Tony. I want whatever you’re willing to give me,” Steve says with a chuckle. “I’m all yours."
,” Tony points out, but he gets out of the car anyway, following Steve around the side of the country club towards the sandy beach.
Tony took it upon himself to deepen the kiss, tilting his head only to slot their mouths together again, and Steve was helpless to do anything but melt into it. Steve could hear the blood pounding in his ears as a fire sparked in the very center of his chest and chased away the fragments of the ice left in his body.
learned how to clean up pretty well.  What is this, Ralph Lauren?” he asked, tugging at the collar of Steve’s t-shirt. “Are you wearing a Ralph
Tony tries his best to hide it, but Steve can tell that the man is elated with all of the attention.
“Now, that’s just hurtful.”  The doors slid open and he stepped out of the elevator and out under the fluorescents of the garage. “What about—”
Tony was lighting him up inside, making his nerves stand on end, and Steve wanted that feeling ingrained in his memory forever.
Tony doesn’t even think twice before accepting because the last thing he needs is another Christmas spent alone in his house.
“It’s all right,” Steve said, even though he felt anything but.  He ignored the unsettled look Tony was sending his way and plastered on a smile. “I’m sorry, I’m not feeling all that well of a sudden.  Why don’t you two go on ahead and I’ll catch up later?”
Tony closes the distance between them and pulls him into his arms, while still mindful of Steve’s injuries.  He thinks he makes a mistake when Steve’s entire body stiffens upon contact, but just as Tony starts to pull away, Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s back.  The magnitude of his feelings for Steve are so overwhelming that it takes all of his effort not to start sobbing then and there.
Rhodey mutes the television again and looks at Tony pointedly.  “Do you have any idea how it feels to find out that my best friend has been dating someone through a gossip talk show?”
Tony’s eyes flick from the note to Steve’s face, which has taken on a rosy hue as well, and back down to the little slip of paper again.  He’s extremely grateful that he no longer has a heart condition because he can feel his heart practically hammering out of his chest.
“I’m sure that’s not true,” Steve assured with a smile. “The property is beautiful.  People must be clambering to get their names on the waiting list.”
His favorite sound, however, is Tony’s running dialogue as he works: the way he mutters numbers and equations under his breath, the excited tone in his voice when he figures out a solution, the occasional curse when something doesn’t go quite the way he planned.  Steve especially loves listening to Tony’s conversations with JARVIS and Dummy—he loves how little the man has to say to get his point across to his companions.
worry about you, especially since you seem to have an affinity for jumping out of planes and facing off against armies of drones by yourself.”
Luckily, Tony flirted like he breathed, so it was easy to dismiss his crush in front of the others.  He had ignored his feelings for Pepper for over ten years before they got together, and despite the rocky romantic aspect of their relationship, they were okay now.
The kiss never deepens, but Tony finds himself clutching at Steve’s shoulders, his arms, any part he can touch.  If this is all they’re going to have left, then Tony wants to remember the feeling of having Steve near him.
“Great,” Tony answered. “Pepper’s going to love it.  I already signed the contract.” “That’s great.”
He doesn’t realize he says it out loud until Steve shifts in his sleep.  Steve reaches out and frowns when his hand touches nothing but air, and Tony abruptly climbs back into bed—back into Steve’s awaiting arms.  Steve makes a sound of contentment and buries his face into the crook of Tony’s neck.  It only takes a few moments for Steve’s breathing to even out again, and Tony just tightens his grip around Steve’s shoulders and kisses the top of his head.
It didn’t take long for Steve to feel that familiar wave of pleasure curling in his gut, intensifying with every slide of Tony’s cock, every touch from his fingers, and every kiss from his lips.  It built slowly, steadily, until Tony leaned forward and whispered a litany of praises in his ear, and Steve came.
“Liar,” Tony said, but there was no heat in it.  He shut off his tablet, and the room immediately darkened—the only remaining light emitting from Tony’s chest.  Tony placed the device on the nightstand and motioned for Steve to come closer. “Jesus, you’re shivering.”
They’re perfectly civil in class the next day, but Steve doesn’t text him at all for the next two weeks.
“You got hit in the head pretty hard though,” Natasha said, carefully brushing the hair away from Steve’s forehead. “We couldn’t get to you on the comm.  Tony practically tore apart every drone with his bare hands to get to you.”
“I…I think… No, I do.  Want to,” Tony said, a faint blush on his cheeks again.  “Marry you, that is.”
Once again, Tony isn’t sure what it is that comes over him, but he pulls Steve down by the collar of his shirt and kisses him.
This guy smells like expensive cigars and cologne, and the coffee they’ve been drinking hasn’t done much to mask the taste of alcohol on his tongue.
“I’d never go back on my word,” Amora promised. “Especially regarding a request such as yours.  It’s…” She thought for a moment. “You don’t see that kind of dedication and resoluteness anymore.  It’s admirable.”
Steve stood there silently for a few moments, appearing to mull over an appropriate response.  Instead, he sighed dejectedly and mumbled a pathetic “you didn’t leave a message” as an excuse.  He shrugged and stooped down to gather some of the logs off the pile.  “I figured it wasn’t important.”
“Before me, you had Pepper and Rhodey,” Steve countered. “And when none of us are around, you have JARVIS.”
Tony had first met Bucky after his and Steve’s third date had been interrupted by some manufacturing emergency, and Bucky had shown up on the roof of the restaurant in a
, Steve,” Tony reminds him.  “The President’s safe, Killian’s dead, everyone infected with the virus blew up—well, except for Pepper, but that’s no biggie.  I’ve already figured out how to fix it.  And I just got a call from the hospital saying that Happy woke up about an hour ago, so he’s going to be fine—”
“I’m glad.”  Tony continues massaging him in silence for a few minutes before asking: “What do you think of going away?”
“You challenge him,” Bucky answers instead. “You aren’t afraid to speak your mind in front of him, and have never been afraid to knock him down a peg or two.  Most people would fawn over him from his money and gifts alone, but you’ve never accepted a penny from him without an argument.  I… There were a couple in the past who had done the same thing, but it didn’t take long for me to realize it was all just a game to get Stevie wrapped around their finger.”
“Vacation,” he clarifies. “When was the last time we had any time to ourselves that wasn’t rudely interrupted by a supervillain trying their hand at world domination again?”
There was more to Tony Stark than just his standoffish exterior: beneath the mask was a man who always went above and beyond what was ever needed or expected of him.  He was a man who didn’t have very many friends, but revered the ones that he
Steve was happy.  He was the happiest he had ever been in his life.  He couldn’t recall anything that brought as much happiness into his life as spending time with Tony did.  Steve knew that what he and Tony had was special, and he would be happy with whatever Tony decided to give him… but if Steve were being completely honest, there was still a small part of him that wanted to share it with the world.
“Funny.  I was about to say the same about you,” Steve says.  He leans in for a kiss, but is interrupted when a grape hits him square on the nose.  Steve and Tony look towards the kitchen and find Clint, Natasha and Sam sitting at the table.
“Do you really want to do this now?” Steve asked tiredly, stepping around Tony to dump the logs inside the shed. Thunder cracked, and Tony watched Steve’s profile as the blonde tipped his face up towards the sky. They were both silent for a moment before Steve’s voice cut through the air again. “It was because of Bucky.”
“Well, that went about as well as I thought it would,” Tony says when they’re in Steve’s hotel room—they had wanted to go back to school, but realized it was a lost cause when they saw the dozens ofreporters waiting outside their dormitory.
“You seem to be doing just fine,” Tony said, echoing his statement two months ago, when this whole mess had started.
“He doesn’t want anything from me,” Steve snapped. “Now, give me a tablet or something so I can try fixing this mess.”
Steve shook his head.  He could see the strain in Tony’s shoulders from trying to control himself and keeping his movements slow and careful, and Steve was struggling just as much, thoroughly surprised that the fabric in his hands hadn’t ripped into shreds yet.  “I need
“If you can honestly tell me that you don’t want to pursue this, I’ll understand.  It’ll hurt like hell, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to have you back in my life again because I miss you so damn much, Tony.”
“Why are you making such a big deal out of this?” Steve counters.  He stands up, towering over Tony, and Tony gets even
Tony reached forward, taking Steve’s hand in his and lacing their fingers together. “I’d rather without it, if that’s okay with you,” he said.
What he isn’t expecting is for Steve to gently cup his cheek before pressing their lips together in an achingly tender kiss.
Steve regarded him carefully. “I know you are, and I’m sure she appreciates the thought, but you have to remember that it’s
Peggy schedules an interview with Vanity Fair at Steve’s six-bedroom-eight-bathroom “cabin” in Colorado.  Tony tags along because he hasn’t seen Steve in almost a week and he figures at least being in the same house with Steve is better than not seeing him at all.
Tony had only had a few minutes to freak out before Steve appeared, freshly showered after his morning run.  Steve took out his cell phone and slid it across the counter so it was in Tony’s line of view, and there, on the screen, was a very eloquent tweet on Steve’s page that calmly and effectively dismissed all of the dating rumors.
“Very well, I shall keep them here for now,” Thor said, placing them on the table, “just in case you decide to keep one after all.”
Tony eyed the offending four-legged creature warily, taking a cautious step back when it tried to jump out of Steve’s arms.
And just like that, he’s done it.  He’s been told it would feel like having a huge weight lifted off his shoulders, but he just feels like he’s going to go into cardiac arrest at any moment.
Steve grabbed a couple plates from the cupboard and some silverware from the drawer before setting them on the counter. “I try not to ask any questions.”
Tony looked at Steve curiously. “Maybe what?” “Never mind,” Steve insisted. “Forget I said anything.” “Out with it, Rogers,” Tony ordered.
Tony reached out and wrapped his fingers around Steve’s wrist, but Steve recoiled, ripping his arm out of Tony’s hold.  “You made a decision that affected our lives and you didn’t consult me.  You bargained your life with one of our enemies without telling me.
At the end of Steve’s parents’ visit—and their parents’ disastrous meeting—Joe and Sarah invite Tony to spend the holiday back in their country.
They usually consist of dinner or a movie, and end with the girl (or guy) asking to go back to Tony’s place.
“Okay, I won’t,” Pepper said teasingly. “Anyway, we were wondering if you know who’s behind it since you aren’t narcissistic enough to do it yourself, regardless of what the media says.”
crack: he was just surprised that the man still wasn’t schmoozing the crowd he was with not two minutes ago.
As a philanthropist, I’m an Omega’s rights’ defender. I truly believe every Omega deserves respect and shouldn’t be looked down based on their looks…
"Captain Rogers is in the gym. I’ll send for him." Fury said. "Coulson, go get Captain Rogers. And tell him Mr. Stark is here to meet him."
“That must be your man.” Bucky said, not want to mock Steve on his first crush, but not being able to hold back.
“Are you okay? What did Tony do, Steve? Tell me.” Pepper says, dragging me to the couch on the living room two floors up from my room. Gosh, I don’t even remember how I got to the living room. I don’t even know why I was going up instead of down…
He decided he was going to make this kid his lover, and without him finding out who Tony really was.
I know I shouldn’t be judging him by his father’s actions, but… but, what if he actually felt disgusted by my crying?
I can’t let my best friend live in a lie… even if it makes him happier than I ever seen him be in his life.
He stops and looks at me and… God! What happened to his eye? His left eye was so swollen. When did that happened? Had it been swollen before?
She says it will be just as good as when everyone at the orphanage got invited to that Stark charity event, where they had bouncers and cake, and everyone got a chance to talk to Mr. Stark and hi mate, Mr. Steve.
"Mr. Rogers, is something wrong?" Professor Erskine asks me, but I don’t have the time to reply, because Mr. Stark starts talking.
I saw Steve’s eye’s going instantly to my manhood. The way he was looking, with so much thirst, made me feel flattered, and a lot hornier. He started moving his legs, uncertain of what to do with them as more slick leaked out of his hole.
Then I had to wait a week for the S.H.I.E.L.D.’s doctors to allow me to visit Steve. They said he had been exposed to extreme stress. Agent even tried to make me feel guilty… it may seem wrong, but I felt pride in knowing that my absence had caused such an impact in my mate, even without having him know that he’s destined for me.
“Steve. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Just give me a chance to explain, okay? I promise it wasn’t what you’re thinking. I’m just so sorry, Steve.” He’s crying. “I’m sorry…”
“I can give you the recipe if you want. Do you have a place to write it down?” Said Steve smiling, hoping his friends would drop the issue.
“I looked so bad.” He says chuckling, with tears stuck on his eyes. “It’s weird, because I don’t even remember taking this photo anymore.”
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Stark." He tells me. But he says it as if it was not “nice” at all to meet me.
“Cake?”  Tony asked confused. The guy had an aura of innocence around him, but he was all perfect muscles. He was having a hard time picturing him baking.
"Hello, gorgeous, I’m Tony. " He said, finally opening his eyes and looking up at me, as I held his head on my lap… while I was crying.
I had to be in therapy too for a while when I was kidnapped all those years ago, so I can’t be a hypocrite towards Steve’s friend. I know what going feral feels like. I know what’s he going trough. But… I just wish it was just me and Steve again.
“To stop me from keeping you happy.” He finishes, cleaning the remaining tears on his suit’s sleeve.
“ He didn’t even knew you. He may have been doubtful, but I don’t think that’s because he doesn’t love, or because you aren’t his mate… that photo was the closest thing he had to a mate for over 20 years. I know it shouldn’t have any influence. He shouldn’t have had doubts and…”
Steve looked complitly drugged in bliss. He had his eyes half closed, his mouth was slightly opened with a little strain of drowl going down his chin. He was breathing was uneven and his blonde locks were messy. He was sweeting heavly. He was a truly a vision.
All I could think of was that the man on my father’s picture was, either, around my father’s age, or worse, dead.
Inside the army facilities, there were only two people I can truly trust: Miss Peggy Carter and my childhood best friend Bucky Barnes. Although they were both Alphas, neither saw me as a weak omega, instead, they looked at me as a friend. I’ll always appreciate that. But I still want to feel loved by an Alpha. I still would have liked to have the support of a loving Alpha, because tomorrow everything will change. I either die or I’ll be reborn as a new, strong Omega.
Captain America… No! Steve Rogers is the most amazing Omega I’ve ever met… and I’m not talking history books here.
“A new Stark Phone model. Exclusive, tiny, and with a little cap. This is – pause for dramatic effect – Mark 50 Stark Phone!”
I'M SO SORRY!...but FINALLY here it is; Chapter 8... and here's the sex scene I've been waiting for!!! YEAH!!!
“Two sugars, right?” Steve finishes for him, and Tony can only nod as he seats himself at the table.
“You ruin all the fun.”  Okay, so maybe he still needed a lesson on extravagance, but this was Pepper’s wedding, and he just wanted her to have the absolute best.
He spread his hands out over Steve’s legs, pushing them up towards the ‘v’ of his pelvis and curling his fingers into Steve’s pockets.  It had been so long since he’d been able to really touch Steve and now that he was finally in reach after such a long separation, it was all he wanted to do. Steve’s pupils dilated when Tony’s fingers moved to his fly, but he roughly pulled Tony up instead, pressing him back against the side of the shed with enough force to cause the building to creak slightly.
“Positions,” Steve clarifies, his face ridiculously red for someone who just had Tony’s cock in his mouth a few minutes ago.
One morning, Tony walks into the kitchen and finds a giant bouquet of flowers at his seat at the table.  To the delight of Steve, as well as the other Avengers, Tony actually
“Right.  I forgot about that little detail.”  Steve surveyed their surroundings. “I know most New Yorkers tend to avoid Times Square like the plague—hell, Tony would probably face off against the Mandarin again before coming here—but I’ve never minded it that much.”
“You two have been stepping out together for quite some time now, and Natasha mentioned something about—”
“You thought…” Steve trailed off.  He didn’t know what to say.  Just five minutes ago, Tony was saying sweet nothings into his ear and calling him ‘beloved,’ and now he was saying that he had seen their break-up as inevitable?
“Never.”  Tony knew Steve hated hearing it, but he would put Steve’s well-being before his own without hesitation.
, and Steve isn’t certain as to just how much either of them apply, but he figures it isn’t something he should bother dwelling on.   He eagerly accepts a refill when Thor offers, though the others are still working toward the halfway point.
“Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers?” the woman called out as she approached.  She shook both of their hands. “My name is Vanessa Marianna.  It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Next time,” Tony replies, “because we all know someone out there is just waiting to go crazy and cause another disaster, I want you to call me.  I don’t care what he says; if you guys need help, call me.”
But every time I tried enlisting for the army, I got turned down… that was, until Professor Abraham Erskine said that he wanted me for his “Project Rebirth”.
I wanted to say something like: “Are you stupid?”, or “I hate you!” or “Hi, I’m Steve.”, but nothing more than sobs came out.
I had been in Steve’s room for 10 minutes and after a heavy make out session, I decided it was about time I took out his clothes.
As we get closer to the gym I can feel myself felling antsy. There’s some sort of… I don’t know… some something I can’t quite put my finger on that got me feeling stressed out.
So, it took me a while, 'cause I dind't feel like M-Preg, and my brother wanted me to do it, but it feels right this way, so: NO M-PREG.
“Steve didn’t know how that phone worked and it was too expensive. So I made him a new one, like the one he had as a kid, and now I’ll give it to him, without him knowing it’s a latest model. I’ll just say it’s the cheapest model Stark Industries have. A model so cheap no one cares for it. I know: I’m a genius.”
"Because, even if he’s not sure I’m his Omega, he still wants me to be he’s mate. He loves me. That’s more than I ever hoped for… Bucky, I was the worst Omega to ever be born. I always dreamed that someone would like me the way Tony does, but I never thought it would actually happen. I don’t care if he’s not sure we’re meant to be. I care about what he wants us to be."
He seemed, now, a little in pain. Without moving, I started spreading little kisses around his face and lips, trying to soothe him. Then he opened his mouth, as I placed kiss on his lips. I envolved his tongue in mine, and kissed him in a, almost, aggressive pace. My dick was pulsing with the need to move, and then, finally, I felt Steve push himself back against me.
"Steve, I don’t think you understand what’s going on. That man is not sure if you are his mate." He practically yells at me.
We are constantly fighting, but, still, I can’t help but to adore him and challenge him and want to treat him as if he belonged to me.
I wanted to yell that man’s name, between my moans, but I didn’t know his name and ended up coming with an empty groan.
The kid seems pretty talented, and his wings were being cut off because of the pricey education system.
God, Steve looks miserable, and that's saying something having in consideration how swollen my left eye is.
"Courting you, of course. I thought I made it clear that I wanted to court you…" He suddenly got very pale.  "Oh my God! I‘m so sorry. Of course you don’t want me to court you. I‘m so stupid. I’m so sorry… let’s just pretend I never said or did anything. Oh, God, I’m so sorry."
Once I got him naked, I sat against the headboard of the bed, still fully dressed in suit and tie, and told him to put himself in all four on top of me with his ass against my face. He semmed confused to why I was asking him that. Once again the lack of common sex knowledge turned me on, making the pants from my suit horribly tight.
Stupid and selfish ideas came to Tony easily, and looking at those birds, he had the most stupid and selfish of ideas ever.
“So that’s why you made extra.” Said Bucky, no longer feeling like finishing his fourth piece of cake.
“That’s a shame. Peggy was hoping to take a picture with him today.” The blond said turning his attention towards the bird on the window, who now was accompanied with another bird. “Oh, little bird has a friend.”
“Pepper, get me my best Stark Phone, with everything paid, from phone calls to internet and games, and wrap it in american pattern wrapping paper!” Yelled Tony, as he entered Pepper’s office.
Anthony Stark hated ceremonies, but much more, ceremonies in his honor. That’s why, after Pepper pushed him into making a donation to S.H.I.E.L.D. (a military school); and after she organized the event; and after she made sure to make it happened on the 4th of July (because military school, really?); and after he came all the way from his penthouse… he decided to hide in the only unlooked room he could find.
“I don’t really like goodbyes, so… Look, would you mind if I… I don’t know, drop by your house, or something. It’s totally fine if you don’t, ‘cause you don’t know me… but I thought I could bring you a gift… or something.”
“Why wouldn’t he want to be a Stark?” I asked, and procced on talking before Tony was actually able to come up with na answer. “You’re the mate I always dreamed of, why wouldn’t you be the parent Peter dreams of as well? Tony, you’re amazing! You’ve proven that many times, not to me alone, but to the world as well.”
Professor Erskine looks at me, waiting for my approval. I nod to him, as to tell him it’s okay. He leaves the room.
And there it was, in his eyes; that look – like he wants to dissect me… and that look was replaced with disgust as I started crying.
“Maybe he’s just shy about calling.” He thought, already dialing the number on his own Stark Phone. “It’s turned off…” Tony said sadly, a few seconds after his phoning attempt.
What if I am leading Steve to believe he’s my mate, but there’s actually someone out there who’s supposed to be with?
There had been the pressure of my family’s name, hence: the pressure to be the best at everything related to education, pressure to have the proper charisma, the pressure to, always, be the center of attentions and the pressure to present as an Alpha.
“I don’t need to waste money on a newspaper. I talk to Mrs. Gonzalves everyday about the news. She’s a really nice lady. Why do you ask?... Are you famous, sir?”
Of course she would. It was a summer day and he was using a hoodie. She probably was assuming he was there either to rob her, or sell drugs to her grandson, or some other shit.
He suddenly hears a knock on a door, and awakes up to the reality that he was already knocking on Steve’s door.
I knew Bucky was right, but I couldn’t let Steve suffering in a Heat. I was going to do everything to make sure he felt nothing but pleasure and joy in this state. Just had to be careful not to bite him, and everything would be fine.
“You don’t have to explain. I’m the one who’s sorry.” I am crying again. “I didn’t let you talk. I just jump to conclusions. I already know, and I’m so sorry I didn’t listen to what you had to say… I’m the one who’s sorry. I’m in the living room of the penthouse with Pepper… I’m ready to hear you now. I’m sorry, I… Tony?” I ask the moment I hear a small noise and stop hearing Tony breath on the other side of the line.
