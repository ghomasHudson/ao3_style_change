“I sleep on the right side. I hog all the blankets. Sometimes I talk in my sleep for hours on end. Would that bother you?”
“I’m not. Technically. I’m a consulting detective, only one in the world, I invented the job. Which means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me.”
“Mm, Sherlock?” he asked sleepily.
“I can when I got his card earlier today from our lovely cabbie friend and called him up,” Sherlock said.
“If you say so.”
John’s heart sunk in his chest at the sight. Sherlock must have left while John was still sleeping. Perhaps Sherlock could read minds, after all.
“Perfectly understandable.” John laughed, making himself more comfortable in his seat and noticing how quickly he felt at ease in Sherlock’s presence.
As he finished drying off Sherlock’s face, John was able to get a bit of a better look at him. He had definitely seen him around before, but he looked to be at least a year or two younger than him.
“My jacket?” John turned around to face it, finding nothing in particular that would’ve given away his relationship with his sibling.
“You really would let me stay with you?” Sherlock asked, sounding genuinely surprised.
As Sherlock was reading through John’s overly-romantic retelling of their adventure, however, he noticed that there were even more spelling and grammatical errors than usual. John was, of his own admission, not very fond of typing, but the number of mistakes was quickly making it clear that John had been struggling for an entirely different reason. Sherlock knew he shouldn’t have let him simply pop back a few pain killers and make a cup of tea. John’s shoulder had likely been bothering him the entire time he’d been writing.
He shrugged off his greatcoat and carelessly flung it onto an armchair along with his trusted scarf. He flicked the kettle on, filled a glass with water and brought it with him into his bedroom.
"Oh, right, 'cause that's just what our readers need, you plowing on about all the things my inferior mind missed."
“Don’t push it.”
“Five. Halfway there.”
“Is this okay?” John asked, their lips a hair’s width apart.
“Oh, shut up.” John shot him a small smile.
“It’s a new case; I got a client today.” Sherlock said without facing him.
“John? Talk to me.” Sherlock’s hand cupped the back of John’s head in support while he checked him for a fever.
John just nodded sullenly.
John sat in bed, hand still clutching his chest and grinning like an idiot. Perhaps it was the combination of still being half asleep, the enchantingly beautiful music, and the tail end of an adrenaline rush that made John get out of bed and head downstairs.
“No, I’m sorry; you were reading.”
“Seven.”
Sherlock worried his bottom lip for a moment before slowly moving to sit down in the chair next to John. “In this case, I feared that if I got too close, I would be forced to…confront certain things.”
“I believe he had a bit of a fall,” Sherlock answered.
He slowly but surely made his way down, and was by John’s side in a flurry. He carefully turned him over, noting the cut near his temple and the way he was holding his midsection.
John could tell that there were words forming at the tip of Sherlock’s tongue that he wanted to say, but he was holding himself back. John was glad for it, though, because the last thing he wanted to do at that moment was talk. Not only because talking proved a painful experience, but because he wasn’t even sure what to say.
Sherlock appeared lost in thought for a moment before furrowing his brow and frowning slightly.
John beamed at him. “God, yes.”
“Right, good. That’s good.” John said. He brushed his fingers quickly through his hair and tugged at his jumper, readjusting the shirt underneath a few times as well before finally settling.
Sherlock chuckled and started rubbing John’s ankle absently, hoping it would help soothe him.
“Sherlock, leave me alone!”
hold me back.”
“Oh, just about every overdone, sickly sweet tradition you can imagine. Hanging small, breakable things on tree branches, covering every available surface in tinsel, decorating anthropomorphic biscuits made of gingerbread, the whole bit.”
“Sherlock!” John shouted, immediately scrambling to get the mess off of his cheeks and nose.
He nodded again.
John felt as if all of the blood had suddenly drained from his face. He swallowed nervously and clenched his fists at his sides, his words caught tight in his throat.
“Good, you’re awake,” Sherlock said, tucking away his phone for the moment. “How are you feeling?”
John sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Sherlock, you don’t have to pretend like it doesn’t bother you. Just because you know why he acts that way doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to be upset by it.”
“I don’t follow.”
He was squinting at what he thought was a bin, until that ‘bin’ became bigger and began to take on the shape of a person, who he bumped right into, making that at least the third time he’d stumbled into someone that night.
John smiled warmly at Sherlock before bidding him goodbye. Now he was going to have to go back into the bar, find Mike, and tell him that he’d had just about enough for the evening.
“And the name’s Sherlock Holmes.” He gave a small wink and shut the door.
been looking forward to their night together, and he knew that their schedules likely wouldn’t free up again anytime soon, but it wasn’t John’s fault.
“You’re what?”
“You can keep it; I don’t mind. Let’s get you home, yeah?”
John could see the worry in his eyes and the way he was fidgeting with his hands behind his back.
“You’re missing the point, Sherlock. I’m human, okay? Just remember that whenever you think I’m acting strange.”
For a moment, John considered obeying, and kept his eyes closed, not wanting to open them to the new occasionally-blurred world he lived in. He was well aware that over the past week, the bouts of blurriness and occasional spots in his vision had been coming in at shorter intervals. They could have been caused by a number of things, but given his family history, he had a hunch as to what it was. Going to see a doctor would mean setting it in stone, and he wasn’t sure if he was ready to do that yet.
The flat got quiet for a moment after that.
“Well what?”
Once he felt that he could gather his thoughts for more than a few seconds, he realized that most of his face had landed on a cluster of rocks, and it was likely the cause of the pain radiating through his jaw and head.
John has been spending too much time focusing on rugby practice and not enough time on his health.
“Oh, I love this, they always make a mistake!”
“If you need to vomit, just do it. You don’t have to be embarrassed.”
It was a few more minutes before Sherlock returned, book in hand. He set it down victoriously atop his notes and returned to his seat.
“I’m here, John.” The detective reassured. “And I think you
“It’s isn’t, though. I said that I wouldn’t leave you out anymore. And I could tell you that it’s difficult for me to slow my brain down once I get started, or that I tend to tune most things out if I’m focused on a task, but I know that doesn’t undo the fact that I hurt you.
“I’ll get you your usual, then.” John put down his newspaper and picked up his mobile. He knew by now that if he simply put food next to Sherlock, eventually he would eat it, whether he noticed he was doing it or not.
Sherlock just chuckled and continued to stare out the window.
John frowned. He was silent as he sat down next to Sherlock on the sofa.
The small sitting room was dimly lit with the television on low volume, and what Sherlock saw when he looked to his left was not at all what he’d been expecting.
“You certainly can with the right amount of coffee and motivation.” Sherlock smirked.
“So, are you going to tell me what happened or shall I do the honours?” Sherlock asked.
“Oh,” the doctor looked a bit embarrassed. “well I wasn’t much for sleep last night after, well you know. I got up early, figuring you would. I was just waiting to see if you still needed me. I didn’t want to just leave. Must’ve dozed off.”
John just grinned and took hold of Sherlock’s hand, giving his fingers a light squeeze. He led them to Sherlock’s bedroom where the two got comfortable under the duvet, quickly finding their preferred spots with Sherlock spooned up against John’s back.
“How did you know what to do?” the words tumbled from Lestrade’s mouth as if he’d been holding them back. He shrugged and looked down at the floor. “When he fell on me, I didn’t even know what happened, let alone what to do about it. Then you came in and just got to work like it was some routine.”
“Yes, your ’mind castle’…thing.”
Sherlock grimaced in irritation. “Just don’t kip out on the sofa again; I don’t want to hear your whining about the state of your neck for the next two days.” He was out the door before John could even retort.
“No, but she does a damn good job of making me feel like it was. I mean, maybe she’s right. Maybe I should’ve—“
“Yeah, should be there by the time we get back.”
“Sherlock, I don’t…look, just drop it, alright? I’m knackered and Harry’s gonna be here soon and I’ll need all the energy I’ve got left just to deal with her, so can we please not have this conversation right now?” John sounded like he’d used all his energy just to get his words out, so Sherlock figured he may as well let the topic slide for now and let John get his rest.
“There were fresh lipstick and foundation stains on the mirror. Open your eyes, inspector.”
“She’s not your housekeeper," he said, and was out the door not a second later.
“Thank you,” Sherlock answered as he grabbed it, observed it a bit and sent off a quick text.
"Yeah uhm, I'll do that." John murmured quietly as he shuffled out of the kitchen. He kept his gaze on the floor and tried to keep his balance as he walked out. For the first time since he'd moved in, John had to use the railing on the stairs to get up to his room.
Sherlock slowly lowered his violin and turned to face John.
“Sherlock, I said to leave off. Is picking a lock the only thing you know how to do tonight?” John snapped, his voice still wavering.
“You tried what?”
“You forgot your wallet.” Sherlock said, before anything else. John spit out more blood.
As always, thanks so much for reading! Hope you're all having a good day!
John made a noncommittal noise of agreement and stared into the fire for a bit longer. Sherlock looked to his left and could see John smirking to himself.
John figured Sherlock must have gotten Mycroft his absolute favourite type of cake, because he was swiftly set up with everything he needed to learn braille, along with a collapsible walking stick, and even a very expensive braille display system that could be hooked up to his computer, enabling him to navigate it on his own. The fact that he’d still be able to update his blog and read books online lifted some of the weight off his shoulders.
“I’ll just take this, then, shall I?” He grabbed the cup and tossed it in the bin. He was silent for a moment as he thought of something to say.
John swallowed back his embarrassment and picked up Sherlock’s book that had tumbled to the floor.
John closed his eyes and rested his head back, waiting to hear Sherlock’s familiar footfalls on the steps.
“Oh, come off it, you like them. And I’m pretty sure they like you, too.”
John gave Sherlock’s duffle a final pat and went to go put his shoes and jacket on. Just a few hours of driving and then he’d be able to relax.
“There was an actual wound, then, to cause your limp? Must have been traumatic.”
“Can we watch the one about bees again?”
“So, you think he’s gonna stop round here? You can’t know that.”
“Always,” Sherlock said. He finished up his text before turning to John and quickly eyeing him up and down. “But I’m sure you know what that’s like,” he said, his voice a little quieter.
“I said leave off, Seb,” John warned.
When John opened the door to his flat, Sherlock pushed past him and rushed up the stairs without so much as looking at him. John could feel the anger steadily coursing through his veins as he ran up the stairs after Sherlock.
“You should. It’s really beautiful.”
“You know all of these things about me just by my hand,” Sherlock said, squeezing John’s reassuringly, “Now, can you see me, John?”
“You’re functioning perfectly fine.”
“Got him arrested,” Sherlock said.
It took the better part of an hour of Sherlock digging through skips in the nearby area before he found a metal cane half buried atop a mountain of trash. He grinned wide, his breath coming out like smoke in front of him. He examined the cool metal with gloved hands, and smiled even more when he saw what he needed; fingerprints.
“Because you take care of your things, John. Look at your bag, your shoes, even that cardigan you lent me at the bar that night. All perfectly neat. Older items, yes, but well cared-for. So, you take care of your things, your brother doesn’t. He’s irresponsible, careless, perhaps a little reckless, whereas you are almost the complete opposite. And I can’t imagine that two people with such vastly different ways of going about life would have an easy time in each other’s company.”
The side of Sherlock’s mouth quirked up in small smile as he set his phone aside and reached out to take a piece for himself as well.
“Certainly not,” Sherlock said. “It’s the reindeer that deserve a treat, lugging that sleigh around all night.”
“No, you go ahead. I’d rather you say it.”
“Do you see what I mean?”
“You’ve nothing to apologize for; I just want to make sure you’re all right.”
“Hm? Yeah,” John answered. “Erm, thank you,” he added.
Sherlock chuckled deeply, clasping his hands behind his back and looking at his worn out flatmate. He was about to leave when he stopped short.
John looked up at Sherlock, ready to retort, but stopped when he saw the genuine look of concern on his face. He took a deep breath and relaxed his muscles.
Now John stood on the sidelines and watched as the crowd slowly dismantled and trickled down the stands, keeping an eye on Sherlock as he attempted to make his way out of the throng of people. Once he had successfully caught Sherlock’s eye, John quickly put his arm up to get his attention and waved him over.
“Well, these aren’t gonna finish decorating themselves.” John motioned to the slightly misshapen biscuits scattered across the table.
“That’s good, yeah. Glad you’re enjoying yourself.” John steeled himself, gripping the back of one of the kitchen chairs. Sherlock looked up from his notes.
"Yeah, m'alright. Just knackered, Sherlock, properly knackered."
“So, what am I doing here?” he asked.
“Christ, sorry. I just wanted to make sure you were all right,” John said.
“Alright.”
what you took out of that conversation? I wasn’t trying to imply- I didn’t mean…it wasn’t my intention to upset you.” Sherlock sighed. In truth, his words had come from a place of concern, but somehow his well-meant thoughts always managed to have the complete opposite effect that he intended once they came out of his mouth.
This was not good.
Sherlock had even started helping out on cases once more, after almost imploding from bouts of boredom. Things were slowly becoming routine again, until one night in particular when Sherlock came in to find John staring hopelessly in the direction of his laptop.
Sherlock could practically hear John rolling his eyes as he sauntered off unsteadily to Sherlock’s bedroom.
Sherlock took a closer look at the man’s shoes as well as the bottom of his jeans.
Sherlock moved closer and peered over his shoulder at the text. “Not all of it, no.”
“That it makes an arse out of you and—“
to swallow it.”
“You should wrap yourself up a bit more. There’s word of snow.” The detective muttered.
details, like the type of soil that was on the suspect’s shoes, not the name of the cat that was following you around in the victim’s home.”
“It was like my veins were on fire or something. There was so much pain, I couldn’t see straight. Staying still hurt just as much as moving and I didn’t know what to do. Eventually I just couldn’t move at all. That’s when I knew I was dead as a doornail. And then I woke up to a condescending man with crazy hair and green eyes looming over me.” He smiled weakly.
John stopped. He squinted at his screen. The words seemed to blur in and out of focus for about the fifth time that day. He looked back at the keys, which were out of focus too, and rubbed irritably at his eyes.
“You love me.” Sherlock said, as if getting accustomed with the concept. “But you’re not- What about Mary? Or Sarah? Or...”
He settled down onto the sofa, figuring that Sherlock was most likely gallivanting off to who knows where, doing who knows what type of research. John was beginning to feel more impatient than relaxed, and almost wished he were back in London, sprinting across rooftops and running down dark alleyways. At least there he had something to do, and someone who needed him.
Sherlock shook his head vigorously, his curls tickling John’s neck.
“Seven.”
John twitched a little in his sleep, his face scrunching up minutely. Maybe talking to him really would work.
“Did you want any?” John asked, motioning to the plate. “Or I do have things with slightly more nutritional value, if you prefer.”
To John's surprise, Sherlock ended up coming home about ten minutes after their call. He practically scared the daylights out of John who had begun to doze off in his chair, when he came pounding up the stairs and bursting through the door.
“You’re not a freak,” John stated.
The next morning, John was startled out of reading the paper when Sherlock’s deep baritone sliced through the silence.
“Right,” he said. “Goodnight, then.”
“Like you’ll never ever calm down?”
"You're home early." the doctor mumbled, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
“Ah yes, how inconvenient that you’ll need the help of the
“Even though you thought I was only being your friend so I could…fix you?”
washed, right? And oh, Sherlock was there too, leaning on the door with his arms folded, watching John race back and forth.
“And then what?”
“It’s something that’s out of your control, John.”
“Yes, but you didn’t.”
John tsked and plopped the newspaper down on the side table, pushing himself up angrily from his armchair. “Y’know what? I don’t have to sit here and take this. I’m not a suspect under investigation and I don’t need to sit here while you interrogate me. I’m going out.” He stated, almost missing his jacket as he grabbed for it. Luckily he didn’t think Sherlock saw his little fumble, and he shoved his arms through the sleeves and began to pull his shoes on.
When he crept open the door, he was greeted with one of the strangest sights he’d ever seen. The sitting room was dimly lit, now that the sun had long gone down. The yellowish glow gave the place an air of content and comfort. And there, just a few meters away, fast asleep on the sofa, was John Watson, tucked snugly under a blanket.
“So, mince pies, you said?” John picked up his mug and carefully took it into the sitting room before settling down on the other end of the sofa. “Tell me, what other sorts of things does your family usually do for Christmas?”
“Ooh, a bit touchy today, are we? What’s the matter, did daddy cut you off?”
“You could plop a star on his head and then he’d
John coughed a bit, and sat up straighter. “Two,” he repeated.
“Alright, I get the picture now, but I don’t understand why it’s there.”
“What’s the matter, John? Bit insecure, are we?” Tom teased.
“I’ll be right back,” Sherlock said as he hurried off toward their bedroom.
Sherlock shot him a look. “Humour me.”
“I…I don’t know.”
Sherlock’s eyes fell gently closed as he played, and the lines on his face softened, giving him an air of contentment that John had never seen in him before.
“Yeah, I do.” John patted the seat next to him. “Come on, before I change my mind.”
John just rubbed tiredly at his eyes and looked up to his friend.
John shrugged. “Dunno, you don’t seem the type.”
“So were my ex-wife’s, all the time,” Greg rebutted.
“Hm? Oh, yeah, if Wilkes can actually stick to the plan this time,” John said.
“Christ, Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?”
John awoke to the incessant sound of typing infiltrating his ear canals. He groaned groggily and craned his head up a bit, wincing at the crick in his neck that had no doubt formed from falling asleep on the sofa. He sniffed and looked over to his right where he saw Sherlock settled at the table in the sitting room, typing away like a mad man, on John’s laptop, no less.
The remainder of John's day at the surgery had continued in much the same fashion as it had started; unpleasant, but largely uneventful. The steady stream of screams and scoffs, however, had led to the formation of a headache by the time John clocked out. And it was just as he walked outside and his face hit the fresh air that he remembered what Sherlock had texted him earlier.
“I’ve brought some takeaway. Figured you would be hungry. Lestrade was useless as usual. A lead that led nowhere, what a surprise. Don’t be shy, help yourself," he said, pointing the pen towards the kitchen.
“I don’t normally play for people,” Sherlock murmured, lowering his violin and staring out the window.
John awoke the next morning with a quiet unease sitting in his chest. He stared blankly at the fabric of his pillowcase and thought back to last night, wondering if he’d somehow crossed a line somewhere, if he’d made Sherlock uncomfortable at all. He knew that it likely wasn’t rational, though; Sherlock couldn’t actually read his mind, not to mention the fact that he was barely conscious for the latter half of the night.
“Still snowing, then?” John asked.
They spent a few hours browsing various shops in search of the perfect gift for Mrs. Hudson, with Sherlock claiming that he wasn’t about to just get her a scented candle and call it a day.
“So, what did you think?” John asked, bouncing eagerly on his heels.
Christ, John missed him. Even when Sherlock was with him he seemed miles away. And John had tried at least a dozen times over the last few weeks to tell the man how he was feeling, but with Sherlock’s unusually busy schedule and John’s admittedly poor communication skills, it was virtually impossible.
“Oh, clever,” Sherlock breathed with an inappropriate smile on his face.
Mrs. Hudson turned to John and beamed at him.
“I’m aware.” Sherlock interrupted.
John nodded sullenly. “It was an interesting case. You were excited. I didn’t want to shove my ridiculous anxieties at you.”
Sherlock pounded his palms heavily on the lab table and gritted his teeth.
“Now breathe, deeply, in and out.”
“Brilliant deduction, John.”
“You’re having a mild panic attack. Drink some water.”
“A bit better, yeah.”
John was walking through campus with Sherlock, the both of them having just left their final lectures before the start of the winter holidays. They were on their way to John’s flat to warm themselves up with some tea, order a generous amount of takeaway, and watch some mindless television.
He glanced at Sherlock for what must’ve been the fiftieth time, eyeing his long, pale neck exposed right in front of him. And then he just couldn’t help himself anymore; he leaned up and pressed a soft kiss to his smooth skin.
It wasn’t fair, Sherlock thought, crossing his little arms on John’s mattress and plopping his head down with a huff. It’d been almost a week since he and John played together, because every time he’d walked over and knocked on John’s door, he was told that John was still sick. And even worse, John had been in hospital the day before because of his fever, so now that he was home, Sherlock knew he wouldn’t be able to play for even longer.
“Why’re we on the floor?” Sherlock suddenly questioned, looking around as if noticing his surroundings for the first time.
John was startled out of his thoughts when Sherlock decided to plop himself back down next to him. John wasn’t looking at him, but he could just feel his all-knowing gaze boring into the back of his head.
“Come in,” Sherlock called.
“I’m not sure. Oh, Molly’s here, I have to—“
John cleared his throat awkwardly and attempted to shoot Sherlock a silent apology through his eyes.
“Hey, um, sorry about Seb, by the way,” John said, his voice low. “I really didn’t think he’d say any of that stuff.”
“I suppose that would be…tolerable,” Sherlock settled on.
John slowly started to make his way to Sherlock’s room, hearing Sherlock follow him into the kitchen as he went.
When Sherlock returned about two hours later, he stopped in the foyer and listened closely. The flat was absolutely quiet. Normally there was the muffled, but incessant chatter of Mrs. Hudson’s television, or perhaps her radio as she hummed along. There were no kettles boiling or pans clinking. This struck Sherlock as strange, so he climbed the steps as slowly and carefully as he could.
John shifted slightly in an effort to get more comfortable but seemed pained to move.
John stopped. He closed his eyes and sighed, letting the tremor run its course through his hand. The shaking would always start around his thumb, causing it to almost vibrate back and forth, and the wave of movement would travel through the rest of his fingers and seize control of his hand.
“No need to apologize,” Sherlock said. He gently took John’s hand and placed it back on the towel, picking up where he left off.
“You’re learning,” he mumbled sleepily.
“Yes, and I would’ve been entirely capable of defending myself on my own. For god’s sake, John, I don’t need you to protect me!”
“Can you…?”
“You’re overthinking again,” Sherlock stated.
“Well, that’s very kind of you to say, but let’s try to avoid the broken leg, yeah? And the broken ribs and the concussion and the whole being locked in a cellar thing, while we’re at it.”
John looked at Sherlock for a moment, confused. He’d thought for sure that Sherlock would have been going home for the holiday.
“Yes, but I’m not a bed,” he countered.
Sherlock closed the curtains on the long paned windows in the sitting room. The sky outside was turning a muddy shade of blue, getting darker by the minute it seemed. He sniffled, rolling up his sleeves and looking around the flat for anything else that was out of place.
“Good. That’s settled, then,” Sherlock said before turning on his heel and rushing back the way he came.
John clenched his teeth and bit back a smart remark. “And it’s been taking a bit of a toll on me, yeah? I’m not you, remember? I can’t just go flying about on three hours sleep like a damned wind-up toy.”
“Hm,” Sherlock mumbled noncommittally, his face buried in a book.
“Chemistry. I’m good at…good at esperiments.”
“Three.”
“Pasta. You like pasta. I’ll make that,” he continued.
“Yes, I know.”
John laughed. “Christ, you must’ve been a right bundle of joy as a kid around this time of year.”
“Well, you know Lestrade. Filthy tease, that man.”
“Do you understand what I’m saying, Sherlock?”
The detective snarled, whipping his dressing gown angrily around him. "I was simply putting in those details about the dissected rabbit that you chose to leave out for some odd reason."
“What are you…?”
“Hm. Getting better,” she mumbled to herself, sounding relieved. She made sure Sherlock was okay and told him to let John keep resting before leaving the room.
“Hamish is fine. Tell me what you need, please.”
“What? No, no, I’m not giving you—let go of me, seriously,” John pleaded, still trying to wear his mask of stubborn politeness.
“Shut up. Now go lie down. I won’t be a moment.”
“And this, too.” Sherlock said as explanation as he tossed the blanket over John’s legs. “To keep you warm, I mean.”
“Sherlock, the heat is helping, okay?" His voice still sounded a little rough, but definitely a lot less strained. "I can try and get an appointment tomorrow to make sure there’s no serious damage, but for now I just need to rest for a bit.”
He groaned again when he heard Sherlock continue to massacre the keys on his laptop, and his eyes shot open in realization.
Sherlock slid off his shoes and padded over to the sofa. He knelt down next to John so he could see him better.
“Yes, you do. You fall into a tired heap on your bed after every game and don’t get up for practically an entire day. You’re
After a few more feeble attempts to keep his eyes open, John gave in and closed them, resting his head back on his chair. He was asleep within minutes. And when he awoke the next morning, he found that he had slept soundly through the night, and couldn’t recall having a single nightmare.
“So you
Sherlock looked at him, nonplussed. “I don’t know who that is.”
“Mm, er, alleyway down by that shop with the seedy store clerk y’get your cigarettes from.” John closed his eyes and took deep, measured breaths, trying not to focus too much on the pain in his chest.
“That’s a first.”
“I dunno, solve crimes for people?”
“John,” Sherlock said, looking at him suspiciously. “You’re rather flustered for half-eight in the morning.”
“I love you, John. I got so lost in my own head, I lost track of time. I lost track of everything. I’m sorry.” He kissed him again, sweeter and slower that time, and John honestly felt like he could cry.
“Look, it’s late, Sherlock and I just wanna get home, and—“
“I remember, Sherlock. Shit, I remember.”
For a split second, Sherlock could have sworn that John made eye contact with him, and a wave of false relief flooded over him when he remembered that John didn’t actually know where he was looking. It was such a cruel thing, really, that John’s eyes remained the same aesthetically; because they often fooled Sherlock into thinking everything was still perfectly normal.
“What, making deductions?”
John nodded sullenly. He looked down at the floor, then back up at Sherlock who was staring unfocused at the side of John’s bed. “But you found me.”
a med student.”
“John Watson, I think I may very well love you. Now,” Sherlock shot up from his seat, “get your coat back on. We’re going to dinner.”
“Phone an ambulance," he said, panic laced in his voice.
In the end, Sherlock had picked up a lovely set of teacups and saucers for Mrs. Hudson, while John had gotten her a simple knitted tea cozy. John didn’t know her very well, but Sherlock had assured him that she would appreciate it.
John waved a hand dismissively. “The deduction thing. Keep ‘em to yourself right now eh? S’been a long day.”
“Then what’s the matter?”
“As satisfying as your reaction was, that one was not intentional. Also, I don’t understand why you couldn’t go to the shop. I thought you and the chip and PIN machine were on speaking terms again.”
“Anything for my blogger.”
“Chemistry?” John asked.
be more careful,” Sherlock corrected. “Though I fail to see why it matters whether we get a few bumps and bruises along the way, so long as we solve the case. That’s how this works.”
“Yes, her perfume, Lestrade. John can’t even see the victim and he’s miles ahead of you lot. As always I greatly fear where Scotland Yard would be without us.”
John watched as the end credits rolled lazily up the television screen, but all he could focus on was the warm weight of Sherlock’s head resting on his shoulder. He almost wanted to keep letting the credits roll so that Sherlock would stay where he was for just a little bit longer, but he knew that sleeping in that position would only lead to a very sore neck in the morning, so he would have to wake him to up eventually.
“Tell me when you’ve been discharged. I prefer to text.”
John looked half asleep again when Sherlock came back to the sitting room, and let out a small noise of surprised when the blanket was settled over him.
“He’s been giving Terry medication that is causing him to experience vivid hallucinations. Terry then comes to him, tells him of his visions, and, for his own sick amusement, if one of the ‘visions’ strikes his fancy, he goes out and makes it happen. This frightens Terry, obviously, and so he keeps coming to his therapist when no one else will listen. It’s a vicious circle and a cruel trick played by a bored psychiatrist with psychopathic tendencies.”
Sherlock nodded.
“Just...a hot water bottle for now.”
“I know, that’s why I hate it.”
“Mmph..” he mumbled, burying his face into the pillow.
“Mmh,” John murmured, nuzzling into Greg’s neck.
John shifted under the duvet, gripping the sheet tightly. He looked as if he were getting lost in thought as he stared at a nondescript spot on the floor. Sherlock began to worry he’d set off another panic attack.
“Already took some.”
John smiled bitterly, sighing and folding up the newspaper in defeat. “Look, Sherlock, it’s fine. However you feel about my…it doesn’t matter. I’m fine.”
John ran his hand along the brick wall as he walked, the rugby field just around the corner. As he grew closer, however, he could hear muffled voices, one of which was clearly Sherlock’s. John slowed his step and leaned in closer to the wall, but it didn’t take long for him to realize that the other voice belonged to Sebastian.
Lestrade just shrugged with his mouth open as Anderson and a few others shuffled in. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he stormed up to them.
“Sorry, are you
Smirking to himself, John brought the plates over to the fire, setting Sherlock’s down right by his knee before tucking into his dinner.
“Care to elaborate?” John pushed.
“Ha bloody ha,” John said. “Well? What d’you think? I know it’s not cashmere or anything.”
“So I can kiss you, then?”
“Tell me again why we needed to do this as soon as possible,” John said as he followed Sherlock on their way to the first shop he wanted to check.
“Come here,” John said.
“Don’t want to,” Sherlock mumbled sleepily.
“He forced me in with a gun to my back. I don’t really remember the stairs. There was a lot of flailing, I think. He might’ve dragged me. We got to that tiny room. It was…dark. There was some light from a window. Then he—“
“What?
Okay, I'm really not super happy with this but I haven’t updated this story in a while so I figured I’d post this real quick. This is just what happened after I started thinking about how Sherlock usually has a positive reaction to seeing John’s scar for the first time and what would happen if he didn’t.
Sherlock rolled his eyes fondly and continued walking.
“How could you be bored?” John asked, crossing the room to stand next to Sherlock. “You said someone asked you to solve a case for them yesterday.”
John looked to Sherlock and scowled at him as he got up. “I’ll have you know, that cat’s little infatuation with me was incredibly distracting,” he said, snapping the laptop shut in front of his friend, “and her name was Evelyn.”
The acrid smell of blood filled Sherlock’s nose as he turned John’s head as gently as possible, making John let out a low groan. It was clear that John had hit his head when he’d fallen, and Sherlock sincerely hoped that the tacky blood sticking to John’s hair made the injury look much worse than it actually was.
“Yeah, like how you figured out I was a med student. It’s really incredible.”
John leaned up and kissed him on the jaw. He wrapped the blanket around Greg’s shoulders as well and snuggled in closer, thankful for the time to get his breath back.
John raised his eyebrows.
Wanting to leave it at that, John exited the text conversation and put his phone in his pocket. He still had the rest of the work day to get through before he could even think about yet another problem.
“You mentioned that you’d be meeting me after your psychology class, and now here you are with bags under your eyes that are clearly more pronounced and a slight rasp to your voice that one typically acquires upon just waking up.”
He lay very still for a short while, closing his eyes and breathing in shuddering breaths through his nose. If Sherlock had barely registered John’s presence when he was in the cabin, how was he ever going to notice that he was no longer there?
“Ah, yes. I’d forgotten that he partook in this barbaric sport, as well.”
Other than the vaguely disturbing substances lying around, Sherlock’s flat was an eclectic mixture of knick knacks, books, and papers scattered over just about every surface. The walls were a dark forest green and the small fireplace that was currently crackling made the place feel cozy despite its unkempt nature. John wondered how Greg felt about Sherlock’s choice of decor, but figured he was probably used to it at this point.
“Hey, there’s been another one. Brixton, Lauriston Gardens. We haven’t been there yet, on our way right now. Will you meet us there?” Lestrade didn’t wait long for the reply, and smiled bitterly as he hung up the phone and started the car.
“It’s nothing, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said.
John quickly found purchase on Sherlock’s palm and held onto it. “Now what?” he asked.
“John?” Sherlock’s muffled voice snapped John out of his thoughts and sent a rush of hopeful excitement through his veins. He didn’t expect him to be home until two in the morning at the earliest.
If John didn’t know any better, he’d say that Sherlock was blushing.
“For once in your lifetime John, you have me perplexed and I suggest you take this rare opportunity and use it to your advantage because I doubt it will happen again. Now explain. Please.”
“Huh? Yeah. Fine," he answered quickly.
alright. I don’t need your bloody help,” he snapped, ripping his arm free of the inspector’s hand as if it were poison. He didn’t glance back once at Sherlock or Donovan, who he knew were most likely gaping at him, and made his way out the door.
As usual, thank you so much for reading, and feedback is always welcome! ^^
“I know I need glasses,” he admitted quietly, as if hoping that the words wouldn’t reach across the room. “I just…” He looked to Sherlock expectantly.
After a few moments of trying and failing to take deep breaths, John began to hear an all too familiar sound coming from the sitting room.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was Sherlock playing his violin.
“Thank you,” he said, sighing happily.
“To bed.”
“I meant I could help with your hand, not your romantic drivel,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock refused to slow down the entire walk back to John’s flat. No matter how many times John called out to him, no matter how much John tugged on his sleeve or tried to talk to him, he simply would not let up.
“So you understand then?” John asked hopefully, looking to his friend who had thankfully long since come back into focus. His vision seemed to blur at random intervals, and he breathed a quiet sigh of relief that this recent bout of blurriness was over.
John shrugged, feeling heat steadily rising in his cheeks. “I dunno, just to spend time together. Maybe get a coffee or something. Or whatever you’d want to do.”
John pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head. “Look, you’re taking this the wrong way. I’m not saying I don’t want to do what we do anymore, all I’m saying is that in case you haven’t noticed, I’m not like you. I’m not all young and spry, leaping across rooftops with long limbs and perfect hair blowing in the wind.”
“Well, I’ve got some bio work to do,” John said. “Mind if I sit here?”
A tray of barely eaten takeaway sat on the table next to his chair. The telly was on behind him, but all of the sounds were muffled to his ears.
“It was the only logical explanation.”
“Let go of him,” Sherlock ordered, stomping across the room.
“How could you tell there was a scar?”
It was now the night of Christmas Eve, and Sherlock was flopped on the sofa having just finished playing a round of Christmas songs on his violin, per John’s request, while John was stood at the kitchen counter fixing himself a cup of tea.
Sherlock grunted in protest but let John pick him up off the sofa nonetheless. John half-carried the half-asleep Sherlock all the way down the hall to Mike’s room and deposited him down onto the bed.
But Sherlock had continued to sit by John’s side despite the fact that John was clearly angry with him. He wasn’t going to leave him, not again.
“Well, this is important,” John declared. “Culturally,” he added pointedly before getting up to rummage through his DVD collection.
“Helping me solve the case,” Sherlock said simply as he sat down in the opposite chair with a manila folder in hand.
“Well, when you saw the car you weren’t afraid, you looked more annoyed. So it wasn’t anyone threatening. Then you called whoever owned it nosy, and no offense but you sounded a bit childish. The fact that you didn’t want me to meet them, so, something personal. I could hear your muffled voices and then I knew it was a man, and to be quite frank it sounded like immature bickering. Also he’s got a fancy car, and by the way you dress you seem like you come from a pretty well off family, so yeah.”
“Oh,” Sherlock breathed. “I’m sorry. “
“He is, Sherlock, just let it go,” John called back. “Yes, love, you could be as tall as Uncle Mycroft one day, if you keep eating your vegetables like papa says you should.“
, oh god.” Suddenly John looked as if he were going to be ill.
“Unbelievable. And here I thought we’d just be going out for a nice meal.”
“Yeah, good. Much better,” John said weakly. He had been in the hospital for a few hours but had only been awake for about one. “This bloody thing hurts like hell, though.” He motioned to the IV stuck in the crook of his arm.
“What?”
“Here, this chapter, this is where you’ll wanna look.” He told Sherlock.
John texted.
And so Sherlock got his music in order and began to play. John watched him for a time through slightly hooded eyes, Sherlock’s body swaying swiftly with the music. The song sounded familiar, he must have heard Sherlock play it before at one point or another.
The decrepit house towered above Sherlock as he strode in just a bit ahead of Lestrade. The rest of the team followed, beginning to unpack their equipment.
“I figured we’d start with Bond; he seems to be a favourite of yours at the moment. “
John grimaced but continued to run, the trees whizzing past his vision as he moved.
John laughed and joined in, noticing Sherlock stifling a laugh out of the corner of his eye.
“You're not coming?” Sherlock sounded surprised.
“Sorry,” he started, his voice hushed as if he were telling Sherlock a secret, “I know I need to eat better, and sleep more. I just…I always think I can handle everything, y’know?”
“I’m sorry?” John furrowed his brow in confusion as the cab took off.
Mrs. Hudson wasn’t in the kitchen, and before Sherlock could call for her, she was walking out of Sherlock’s bedroom. The detective said nothing, feeling a strange urge to keep quiet so that John could sleep.
. And don’t think ‘cause I’m indisposed that I can’t nag you to eat dinner. I can order Chinese right from my chair, y’know.”
tw: panic attacks
“John?” He tried, feeling more comfortable on a first name basis. To his joy, the doctor opened his eyes, and stared with a confused expression at the tall man hovering over him.
Sherlock looked at his watch, panting heavily. “Eight twenty –six, that’s not bad. What did you want to talk about?”
John couldn't help his grin as Sherlock wrapped an arm around him and pulled him in close. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and nuzzled into his chest, feeling more relaxed than he had in weeks.
“Sherlock, what is all this?” John asked, gesturing to the setup next to him.
“Feelings about what?”
“Is it…past eight, then?”
“You’re staring at me. You’ve
"Careful on that," he said.
Then, John began to stir even more; maybe he was finally waking up. Sherlock smiled, but John began to cough, short little hiccups that made him groan quietly in his sleep.
“Mm…”
“Sounds a bit silly though, eh?” Greg said with a smile. Was he trying to make him laugh?
knife wounds, but the malice and the damage was still there. We got them out, but two of them, two of them were—“
“Of course it is, I’m the kindest person you know, Lestrade. My heart’s obviously just
“Not a doctor yet,” John corrected, trying to hide his blush as they exited the stall.
Sherlock looked down at the desk next to him and fixed a few piles of papers, shuffling them up together just to make them look neater. He organized a couple files, just to distract himself from wanting to check on John again. He almost jumped in his skin when he heard the door downstairs slam shut. He hadn’t even heard Mrs. Hudson let anyone in, and yet there were Lestrade’s unmistakable grumpy footsteps coming up the stairs.
“I said never mind, John.”
“Sorry, mate, sorry,” John mumbled in apology, making his way past him. He was stopped, however, by the man’s hand grasping onto his sleeve.
“Why’re you helping me?” Sherlock asked.
“Mike,
Sherlock took in a deep breath of the bitter, chemical-laden air of the hospital room and wished that he knew what to do. Muffled, tinny voices were coming from the small television hung in the corner of the room, and Sherlock looked up at it for the first time since he’d been there, hoping it would serve as some sort of distraction.
“I can’t, don’t you get it? My dad’ll kill me if I don’t do well in these games.”
“Right.”
“And?”
“Stop,” John ordered abruptly. He plopped his jacket down on where he thought the chair was but missed it by a hair, though he didn’t bother to pick the coat up where it landed sadly on the floor. “Just stop, Sherlock. Not tonight, please.” He asked in the most polite voice he could muster. Instead of his usual routine of making tea and updating his blog, John sat down on his armchair and flipped on the telly.
“They’re bloody socks, Sherlock!” The doctor yelled from the kitchen counter, though he stepped back into the sitting room soon after. “Am I not allowed to make a mistake?
“Comfortable?” Sherlock asked, staring at him with a hint of smugness.
Sherlock huffed and let go of John. “I ran out of things to pour hydrochloric acid on, Gavin isn’t around to entertain me, and I’m
Back at Baker Street, John stoically refused help when going up the steps, but Sherlock stood behind him with a hand out just in case.
“And you wanna know the real kicker about that story?”
“Eight. Almost there,” Sherlock reassured, noticing that John’s stomach was no longer trembling with such force.
Seeing that Sherlock had no intention of slowing down at any point, John let out an exasperated huff and sped up to close the remaining distance between them.
He settled himself in the middle of the bed and opened up a novel, and read until he fell asleep.
John set his phone down on the bedside table, flicked off the lamp, and turned on his side to go to sleep.
“Sherlock, you don’t have to say anything; it’s fine.”
“No, no,” John assured, despite the fact that he looked like he just might spill his guts all over Sherlock’s jeans.
“I’m guessing you didn’t mean to get this drunk.”
“And it was a bloody good thing you did, too. That man was doing a lot more than petty theft, I’ll tell you.”
John turned away and shook his head, laughing bitterly.
“Yes, of course.” John agreed knowingly.
“I’m sorry, what? I thought I was supposed to be helping you with this case, not hiding in an old woman’s flat!” the doctor said in a terse whisper.
“John, could you hand me that beaker?” he asked, holding out his hand expectantly.
“And I’m sure you know your name and your address and the year and the Prime Minister?”
Sherlock practically stormed into the sitting room after leaving his bedroom, finding John to be hunched over in his armchair, looking very much like he hadn’t moved from that spot for hours. He didn’t look up at Sherlock when he came in, only continued to clutch his shoulder.
The cabin was small, with a cozy sitting room, a tiny kitchen area, two bedrooms, and a bathroom. John sighed, unzipped his jacket and hung it up on the hook behind the door, then plopped himself down onto the sofa in front of the fire.
“He tracked down the man that was stealing from my register; turns out it was my ex-husband.”
“I have no access to the lab now,” Sherlock complained. “I tried breaking in once, but they caught me and Dr. Stapleton threatened to drop me from the course.”
This particular day, every year, was not his day. It seemed that no matter what he did, his birthday was always somewhere on the scale of complete wash to just plain rotten. He had tried over the years to stop caring about it altogether, but still there sat a childish hope in him that he couldn't seem to extinguish, that perhaps this year would be better.
“Oh, god yes.”
John opened and closed his mouth uselessly as he tried to think of what to say. He hadn’t planned on talking about this sort of thing with Sherlock, in fact he hadn’t planned on talking about it with anyone, really, but he found himself suddenly wanting to.
Just when it seemed that Sherlock was finished properly tucking John in, his fingers stopped on the scarf, shaking ever so slightly in quiet uncertainty. Sherlock looked up at John, a question in his eyes that John could tell he didn’t quite know how to ask, but John answered it for him by wrapping his fingers around Sherlock’s lapels and slowly pulling him in close.
“Sister! There’s always something,” Sherlock complained.
It was a little while later that John noticed Sherlock get up off his chair out of the corner of his eye. He was vaguely aware of Sherlock moving about the room, shuffling papers, opening and closing a case of some kind.
shoe? His uniform
“Long day, I take it,” came Sherlock’s voice from where he sat in his chair.
“Jesus, John, you said you were alright,” he argued, keeping the grip on the doctor’s elbow.
“Damn it,” Sherlock cursed as he rushed into the kitchen. He dug out the hot water bottle and turned on the tap, thumping his foot impatiently as he waited for the water to get warm. Not even seconds later, he heard the tell-tale soft tapping of Hamish’s footsteps coming into the kitchen.
“How do you mean?”
John shook his head. “Nice try. It’s a little late for that, though.” He got up and walked past Sherlock, heading for the stairs up to his old bedroom.
“John?” he spoke carefully, stepping closer to his friend.
“I’m good, thanks,” Lestrade assured, stepping a little closer to the door.
On his way back to Baker Street, John received a number of texts from Sherlock, urging him to go to the store to pick up a few obscure items. On any given day, John wouldn’t hesitate to rummage through the shelves of Tesco just to keep his seven year old of a flatmate happy. Unfortunately, the haze around the edge of his vision was making it difficult to see out of his peripheral, and he wasn’t too keen on spending his time in the store bumping into shelves and customers.
John grinned and shook his head in disbelief. “Yes, all right, I fell asleep in psych. But Christ, my professor is boring. He just drones on and on; I don’t know how people stand it.”
"Hm?" He grunted.
“Right. Um, thank you, Mrs. H.”
“She didn’t tell you that was my brother?”
“I hope you enjoyed that, because I am not playing another one of those ridiculous songs for at least the next century,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock’s face appeared to be a mixture of surprise, confusion and, at least in John’s eyes, disgust. He also appeared to be suddenly incapable of speech, his jaw opening and closing minutely as he stared.
“Tea?” Sherlock asked, snapping John out of his fuzzy thoughts.
“Well I can’t sit on your feet.”
“Oh, and, uh, Sherlock, this is Molly. Molly Hooper,” John said as he chucked off his heavy coat.
“I have to share my findings somehow, John. There
“You like marmalade, right?” John asked, turning away towards the kitchen.
“Oh, er, it’s not bad. Guess I should’ve told you they tend to start roughhousing when they’re drunk. I just thought they would’ve been a bit more mature by now, y’know?”
"Alright there John?"
Once in the bathroom, John steered him in front of the sink so that any blood that dripped would at least be able to be washed down the drain. He ripped a handful of paper towels and held them up to the man’s face.
“So, um, anyone have any holiday plans?” Molly asked the group. “I’m just going home to see my parents.”
“Definitely,” He stated, staring at the floor.
“I will, but only if you call Mycroft.”
“Right, and what were you doing in my—“
The next time John emerged from the room, Sherlock was nowhere to be found. All of his books and plants were still sprawled across the table, but the man himself appeared to be missing. John checked his phone for a signal, but frowned when he didn’t find one.
“I want to finish this.”
“What?” John looked up blearily.
“All right, all right,” John said. He took Sherlock by the elbows and gently steered him towards the sink. “Just hold still, you big baby.”
He sat down in an adjacent chair by his flatmate. “You haven’t finished your blog.” He said. “I believe the next thing that happened was that dog following you around, remember? Just like that cat. Evelyn, was it? Bit of an odd name for a cat.”
“Yeah, okay.” John chuckled bitterly. “G’night, Sherlock.”
“Yes, I’m sure.”
“Now, what do you think we should watch on telly?”
“Yeah…painkillers wore off.”
John giggled and nuzzled his face into the soft cotton of Sherlock’s shirt.
The doctor nodded and licked his lips. “Look,” he said tiredly, “I’ve just been, out of sorts, lately, okay? I had that spot of a cold that night with Lestrade, and I haven’t been sleeping—“
Furrowing his brow in confusion, Sherlock scooted his chair closer to John’s bed, and before he could ask what John’s intentions were, John reached out and took his hand in his.
“Joining us?”
The detective practically lit up with joy at the prospect of making his deductions.
“Takeaway?” he asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you like him in…that way?” Mike asked slowly.
“He said he lived with someone called Gavin.”
"I'll take that as a no." Sherlock quipped.
“You haven’t known me long enough."
“Anytime, John.” Sherlock smiled. “And I could finish typing up your blog for you, as well; your readers don’t know nearly enough about mud identification.”
"You didn't finish typing up the taxidermist case." Sherlock complained.
“You don’t have to.”
“We’re going to split up, I’ll chase him to a certain point and you cut him off there, got it?”
The case had taken them to a stakeout at a billiards room, a chase through an abandoned warehouse, and a pile of paperwork in Lestrade’s office.
Sherlock had already flagged a taxi down by the time John looked up from his musings. He grimaced, pushed himself off of the wall and joined his friend in the cab.
“It was worth a try,” Sherlock mumbled as he turned his attention back to his laptop.
do?” Hamish pleaded. Sherlock’s answer was once again interrupted when he noticed the steam billowing up from the now scalding running water.
“How are you feeling?” Sherlock asked, looking to John who was tucked under a stiff hospital blanket. Sherlock thought he looked like he was ready to fall asleep any second.
“You also said that some people had sort of…pressured you into drinking, right? That they said it was an experiment.”
“Alright, alright.
“Black. Two sugars,” Sherlock said.
“Daddy, why's papa crying?” he asked, his voice small and shaking. Sherlock was fairly sure that he knew exactly why, but didn’t want to startle Hamish or upset him further.
Sherlock grinned and steepled his fingers together. He knew John wasn’t able to remember much, but all he needed to know was that he remembered anything at all.
John swallowed hard and tried to clear his throat, knowing his voice would likely come out shaky and uneven.
“And I didn’t have to speak a single word to my family, so the same goes for me, as well.”
John followed him into the sitting room and stopped short, seeming hesitant to go any further. He cleared his throat and looked up at Sherlock.
“Hm?” he said lamely, staring up at his flatmate.
“You brought me here…to get you a book,” John said.
“Yes, I would…I would like that.”
Sherlock pouted minutely and tucked the blanket around John better.
John felt his whole face flush red. “You really think so?”
“Goodnight.”
“Lestrade!” he shouted, waiting a moment. “I know you’re standing right in the hall!”
“Sherlock, you didn’t have to tell me. It’s none of my business, really.”
It was the middle of the night, sometime around three in the morning, and Sherlock had just finished one of his favorite pieces on his violin. He had needed to think, and the instrument was doing a wonderful job of clearing his head, of course until he heard what sounded like pained screaming from upstairs.
John narrowed his eyes in frustration as he tried to make his way down the more dimly lit streets surrounding the flat. The areas with the shops and restaurants were obviously easier to navigate, but once the lights faded, so did his ability to make out shapes and figures.
“I love you as well, John.” He moved in closer until their legs were touching and this time placed his whole hand on top of John’s heart, the heat from his palm spreading fire through his chest. “But I never thought you felt the same. How did I not see it?”
“I’m John, by the way. John Watson. What about you?” he asked.
, John thought. “Right, well. This therapist, you going to turn him in somehow?”
“I’ve just come to remind you, Sherlock, that
“No.”
“John?” Sherlock asked quietly, closing the door behind him.
He listened for a while as the soothing sounds traveled through the air. It was oddly apt, John realized, that Sherlock should start playing such a calming melody so soon after John woke from a night terror. John furrowed his brow, thinking back to the hazy memories he had over the past few months of Sherlock’s violin playing coinciding with his insomnia.
bisexual, is what I meant to say,” he rambled.
“John?” Sherlock asked carefully. He put a hand on his arm, trying to keep him still. “It’s alright, wake up,” he tried.
, Greg. I can’t breathe.”
Mike chuckled and grabbed a beer from the fridge before returning to his post on the sofa. John laughed quietly to himself and stared blankly at the scuffed up wood of the table in front of him. He certainly had a lot more to think about tonight than finishing an essay.
John shrugged.
“Ah. Expecting the dog to be running an underground crime syndicate, were you?”
Sherlock looked up from his work.
Sherlock smiled at the thought as he hopped up the steps to John’s front porch and tapped on the door. He was biting his lip trying to contain his excitement.
“For…for me? I loathe to admit this, but I don’t understand.”
“That’s the real reason you came to see me, isn’t it? Got a little jealous of the army doctor?” Sherlock smirked and opened his arms as if to give a hug.
“Blimey, I hate to sound surprised, but that’s actually really good of you.”
“What was all that about?” John asked.
“No, Sherlock. It's my day off; I just want to have a lie-in.”
Silence stretched out between them as John drifted back to sleep.
“You’re being irrational.”
,” Lestrade scolded like a father.
John cleared his throat.
“Obviously,” Sherlock said.
“Lovely. I’ll be right back,” Mrs. Hudson said as she turned and headed toward the back of the restaurant.
“Let’s see…an anatomical heart; that’s easily to show your love of anatomy and dream to be a doctor. The night sky with various stars and constellations; simple, that’s to do with you and your strange fascination with astronomy.”
John gasped for breath as his eyes snapped open. He sat straight up and put a hand to his chest, attempting to get his breath back.
“Well, what’ve you got?” Lestrade asked as he stepped in, taking out a small Moleskine and pen.
“Oh, and John?”
“Mm.” John nodded. “Mrs. Hudson does do incredible scones.”
“Yeah, because god forbid I care about your wellbeing, right?”
“I’m aware.”
“It’s fine,” John said. He took a deep breath and relaxed his stance. “It’s all…fine.”
“Your jacket,” Sherlock said, pointing the garment draped carelessly behind John.
“You’ll be a good one, though,” Sherlock said quietly.
“Well, yes, but I’m not seven anymore; I don’t have a bedtime, you know. Or a…or a job,” John said sadly.
“—glasses.”
“Worse than it was this afternoon?” he asked.
Right in the middle of the dusty wooden floors lay a shorter man, dressed in a casual jacket and jeans, sprawled out helplessly.  Sherlock knelt down by him immediately.
John stuck his hands in his jacket pockets to ward off the cold as he and Sherlock left the café and made their way down the pavement.
“To keep you warm. You know, so you don’t have to keep borrowing my cardigan,” John teased.
“What do you normally do over the holiday?”
“Why? Oh, nightmares, never mind. Go on.”
John frowned. He was tempted to disagree, but he supposed it wasn’t really up to him who Sherlock considered a friend.
John laughed, wholly and fully that time, looking at him lovingly.

“Deal.”
“Sorry, mate, we gotta get you out of here,” Lestrade tried to reassure.
tw: scars, negative self-image, mention of injury
John hadn’t felt Sherlock’s lips on his in what felt like ages, and he couldn’t stop himself from eagerly kissing back, taking in the taste of him as if for the first time all over again.
“You’re afraid.” He stated.
“Get off me!” John croaked, coughing amidst the heavy scent of booze on their breath.
“Oi, I’m plenty familiar. I know all about…Bach.”
mad, and I missed it." the doctor grinned to himself. "What’m trying to say is, I hate that I can’t see you. I never realized how much I relied on your facial expressions to tell what you were thinking. Sometimes it’s like you’re not even there.”
“There we go,” he said.
“Mm.” John shut his eyes tightly and turned to face the wall.
“I mean, hell, I’m—“ John stopped himself, but the words were already out of his mouth before he could even think.
It was almost midnight, and Sherlock was sitting on his sofa with his knees curled up to his chest and his face buried in a book. He couldn’t sleep, not that he kept much of a normal sleeping schedule anyway, but he couldn’t even focus on any experiments, either.
John brought a hand up to rub nervously at the back of his neck and let out a long, shaky breath.
“I didn’t stay to stop practicing, I said practice
Setting the laptop aside, John got up and headed to the kitchen sink, where he lightly splashed some water over his face. He dried himself off and padded hopefully back to the sitting room, but was disheartened to find the screen still a bit of a blur.
other people out there besides you and I who care about this sort of thing.”
John was halfway through his shift at the surgery when he realized that the blurry haze that had been clouding his peripheral vision was not going away, and his heart sank deep in his chest. He felt a slew of emotions pelted on him at once; worry, apprehension, and a tiny bit of fear that was not at all welcome. He continued to move the cold stethoscope across his patient’s chest, feeling a similar icy sting in the same spot.
“Oh, I’m sorry.”
“So you’ll be a doctor, and I’ll be a detective, and Mycroft will still be annoying,” he chuckled.
“A sound observation indeed, but I want to get this information when it’s fresh in your mind. Now, tell me.”
“I put an eye patch on Redbeard yesterday,” Sherlock said. “He didn’t like it.”
“Watson!” Sebastian repeated. “We’re all going down to the pub. You coming?” he asked.
“How do you know that?” he asked. He knew that Sherlock had likely just deduced it somehow, but something in his blood still ran cold at Sherlock’s words.
John made a noise that sounded like he was in pain before going into a louder coughing fit, grimacing even more.
“Alright, alright,” John sighed, resting his head back tiredly. He closed his eyes for a moment, still trying to adjust to the light. “Are you with the police, then?” he asked.
“What does that even
Sherlock weaved the tips of his fingers in between John’s knuckles, along the tops of his fingers, and over the sides of his hand. John focused on the physical weight of Sherlock’s hands on his own, letting it distract him from the thoughts buzzing frantically around in his head.
“You, coming to my rescue.”
“I’m really sorry. I normally don’t do this,” John tried to reassure, with his voice shaking a little.
Seeing as how Sherlock was practically asleep again already and likely wasn’t planning on getting under the covers, John went back out to the sitting room to grab the blanket that was hung over the sofa and brought it back to the bedroom. He draped it over Sherlock, making sure that he was properly tucked in to hopefully keep the slight chill of the flat at bay.
He wrapped his arms around him tighter and stroked his hair like John had done for him in the past, hoping he was helping in some way.
From the kitchen table, John could hear Sherlock sprouting up from his chair and stomping in to join him.
“No, stop it.”
Sherlock’s phone suddenly buzzed on the table and he let out a long, exasperated sigh upon looking at the screen.
When they finally made their way back to the cabin, Sherlock set John down on the sofa slowly and covered him with a quilt to keep him warm. He spent the next few minutes sprinting all around the house trying to get a signal, when finally he was able to call for help.
“No, I’m Sherlock.”
Sherlock seemed as if he were trying to contain his excitement. “I’ll make tea,” he announced, rushing over to the kitchen.
“Not hungry.”
but it didn’t come out. Were Sherlock’s hands so cold that he didn’t want to at least hold him? Put an arm around him? He used to do that at the beginning, didn’t he?
“He was a friend, then.”
“Do you need anything, John? Anything at all?”
Finally, after the terrible day he’d had, Sherlock smiled.
Upon entering, he found John to be sprawled dramatically across his ruffled sheets, still donning his jacket and shoes.
“Good, and again,” he said, watching as John inhaled deeply through his noise and exhaled through his mouth.
“Wow, that’s amazing,” John said.
“Er, yeah, if you’d like.” John didn’t question him; Sherlock always had his own unique way of observing and taking information in, and if he needed some tactile input to study John’s ink then well, that was more than fine.
“John,” he said hesitantly, “you should know that while I’m flattered, I’m not exactly looking for—“
John’s phone call with his sister had gone over surprisingly well. It hadn’t been great, and they still had a lot to work through, but Harry had managed to talk to him without nearly as many expletives as usual, which was, frankly, more than John could have hoped for.
“You want to know what it was, don’t you?” John asked.
“Human, I know. As am I,” he paused, “which is why I find myself feeling fearful as well.”
“John, I said could you turn off that program?”
“I’m not—“ Sherlock coughed, “a child.”
“Should I make tea?” Sherlock asked.
“Oh, I’ve heard it all before. Good evening, Mycroft.”
“What?”
“You know him?” John asked.
When it was time for him to help himself up, he swayed a bit on his feet, finding it hard to find purchase on the dusty wooden floors. Lestrade was at his side before he could blink, holding him steady while he righted himself.
“I don't know, he won't answer me.”
Sighing heavily, John opened the door to he and Sherlock’s flat, wanting nothing more than to melt into his bed and sleep for an entire year, but he knew that he still had work to do.
“So, um, what do you—”
“Paler than me, hm?” Sherlock joked.
“Why not?” John asked.
“Why? What’s in my—“
what I thought,” Sherlock laughed, clicking the door shut with a triumphant smirk.
John knew he’d have to do a dare before they let him leave, but it definitely would not be that one.
“Mhm..” Sherlock mumbled, looking already half asleep.
“No, it’s not all right, Sherlock.”
“Right. Then I suppose I should tell you that I…” Sherlock looked suddenly nervous, his bottom lip quivering with the unspoken words.
John let out a relieved breath and sat forward a bit. He put his face in his hands and wiped at his tired eyes.
There was also one tattoo in particular that he
“John, you and I both know you’re triggered by more specific things. It wasn’t just the photos; there was probably a panic building in your chest all week that you’d been stifling. This afternoon was just the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
John laughed good-naturedly and scooted back in his chair, giving Sherlock’s shoulder a quick pat as he got up.
Sherlock eyed John for a moment before slowly handing it over to him. It took John only a few seconds to press a button or two before he handed it back to Sherlock.
“Sherlock!” John bellowed. His voice was rough with exhaustion but he couldn’t let Sherlock be without backup to try to take down a man who was known to be far too good with a knife.
“We’re not talking about me, and you know perfectly well that you should be eating more with how active you are. Exactly what kind of doctor do you want to be?”
. It’s about what you do, and the things you see and I can’t see the things you do. I don’t know what your face looked like when that dog bit a chunk out of your ankle, and I couldn’t for the life of me understand why I wanted to see your expression so bad.”
“When, then?” Sherlock snapped back. “When you trip over a stack of books in the sitting room and injure yourself?”
“Stop that,” Sherlock said.
“Oh?” John asked, turning to look at him.
He immediately regretted the decision.
John had been silent the entire cab ride home, so naturally Sherlock expected him to start talking almost as soon as they’d walked through the door, but instead, John simply looked at him and motioned for them to sit down.
“Hamish, listen to me. Papa isn't feeling very well right now, and he needs my help to feel better, which he
it?” Sherlock snarled, turning back to face him.
“Hey,” John greeted.
John pointed to the computer in question. “That’s my laptop.”
“How would you know?” Seb sneered, a smug grin plastered on his face. “What, have you gone gay as well? You’re on his team now, are you?” he goaded.
Finally, they backed off, but only because Tom had somehow managed to pry John’s shirt off and was dragging it back with him victoriously.
Sherlock heard the signature squelch of trainers on soggy ground as John jogged towards him. He grinned at the thought of the two of them going back to his house where John would have a shower and nag Sherlock to watch crap telly with him afterwards.
“No, I think I would have deduced it eventually.”
John smirked to himself. “No, I’m not.”
By the time John joined Sherlock in the sitting room, the taller man was already back on the laptop. Sherlock sat at the cluttered desk, tapping his foot anxiously as he typed. John stared at Sherlock for a moment, narrowing his eyes at him.
“I’ve got a case.”
“Had I not told you that?”
Sherlock made a noncommittal grunt. “I suppose so.”
“Oatmeal really isn’t my colour.”
A few minutes went by and John had already begun to fall into an exhausted, drowsy haze when Sherlock came storming upstairs, startling him out of his sleepy state.
“I understand, Dr. Watson, that it must have been difficult for you to accept the prognosis when you realized what it was—“
“Afghanistan, but how did you—“
John chuckled softly. “Right, yeah.”
“You’ve tripped a total of three times today, two of them being in the last fifteen minutes. I do hate to repeat myself but I will ask again, is there something the matter, John?” Sherlock sounded more irritated than concerned.
human bones in that drawer. Sometimes I don't talk for days on end, other times I don't shut up. You'll be seeing a lot of blood, violent crimes; you'll be exposed to an incredible amount of violence and action. So, what do you say?”
“Well that’s where he broke the rules,” John said.
Sherlock took the phone back and examined it suspiciously, but it didn’t take him long to figure out what John had done.
“That you’re not going to be able to focus if you’re running on three hours of sleep,” John answered.
John chuckled and gingerly swept the blood off of the taller man’s face. The restroom was a pocket of silence compared to the bar outside the door, making John’s ministrations feel strangely intimate.
“They’re my favourite,” he said.
“No, wait!” John quickly covered up the tattoo with one hand and gently pushed Sherlock away with the other.
John stilled.
“Hm?” John grunted, looking at the duvet over him like he’d never seen it before.
“This isn’t the first time John’s had a panic attack. At first he tried to hide them from me, and we all know that was a pipe dream. Then I showed him a trick my mother used to use when she needed to calm down. Worked like a charm, and I’ve been helping him ever since.”
“Sorry,” he said. “Didn’t mean to have a kip on your sofa. I didn’t get much sleep last night, or the night before,”
The next morning, John found Sherlock sitting at the table in the breakfast nook, engrossed in a botany encyclopedia and completely oblivious to the world around him. He wore his red and green tartan dressing gown and his hair was slightly tousled. John resisted the strange urge to brush the stray hair away from his face and instead set a granola bar down in front of Sherlock.
