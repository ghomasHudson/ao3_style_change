"I... would definitely consider us to be a couple Sherlock, but I honestly thought, wrongly clearly, that you'd be the one who wanted us to be only as
It took John a full minute to think this through before he spoke. “I saw his soulmate mark. In his elbow. And..and it had my birthday on it.”
"I think anything we do will scar most of them..." Sherlock smirked "Brilliant" and shoved John backwards onto the couch before straddling his hips and capturing his lips in a lavish kiss, parting his lips and teasing his tongue out into his own mouth until they were wrapped in a slow dance of perfectly timed movement, if Sherlock leaned back John moved with him, a perfect team. The door swung open and officers piled in, not yet seeing the display on the couch that was not merely for their benefit anymore, because Sherlock somehow had his hands twisted into John's jumper and John definitely had a hand on his ass. The team tramped through the hall and into the sitting room and there was a chorus of gasps as various items clattered to the floor and officers shuffled awkwardly, Lestrade coughing at the pair who were tangled in each other, all of them various shades of red. "Eh... Sherlock? Any chance you could em..." Lestrade bumbled and Sherlock pulled his lips from John's before latching himself onto his neck. "You will so pay for this later Sherlock I swear-gah! Yes Greg?" John tried to focus on everything but the Sherlock attacking his neck.
"Economy. My people weren't given the accurate information, a situation that will never occur again thanks to a few tweaks here and there. Nasty business." John and Greg just looked on in confusion as the conversation continued.
"So how have you been mate? It's been far too long." John half smiled at the dark look that passed over his face, that next to last meeting had been rather unpleasant... "I've been worse, far worse. I never had the chance to thank you for that by the way. So thank you and sorry for er... how you found out about" he held up his hand, ring glinting in the low light. Greg nodded his acknowledgment of John's thanks, and smirked at the ring. "You know part of me can't believe that
"It's only creepy because you're whispering, talk normally and it's a fantasy coming to life." John shook his head and waved goodbye, very much aware of their eyes following him as he made for the trails back to camp.
They stuck to that for the next five days, collecting fresh honey, exploring the forest, admiring the various species of butterfly that fed on the field of wild flowers in the end field, tasting local wines, lighting bonfires and watching the sunset and the stars come out, kissing, caressing and undressing the days away until the morning of their flight arrived and they were once again sitting in the airport departure lounge.
Tonight however, he is alone on his hospital bed, with nothing on hand to alleviate the searing pain in his head. Just when Sherlock thought he would be trapped in this bottomless pit between wakefulness and sleep, he could feel a whisper of foreign fingertips on his left arm and a warm, gentle hand sweeping across the curls spilling onto his forehead.
It was John in the end, who endeavoured to open the door to the drawing room. He stood back, allowing the other two men to enter before closing the door with a quiet click behind them. Mycroft was lounging in an armchair facing a large fire place while Mummy Holmes was in a chair by the window, her grey hair sitting in a sleek bun on her head. Mycroft addressed the party first.
"You two! Come on, no time to explain - Mary's having the baby! Let's go let's go let's go! There's a car waiting for you."
“Watson, I have been puzzling over it all evening and yet, the answer eludes me still.” John leaned forward in his chair, furrowing his brow in confusion.
"Not dreaming" Sherlock murmured into his mouth, a quiet admonition that he felt it to, had checked and made sure that this was real, they were bonded forever, two words that would come to pass between them again and again in times of great joy, two words that meant more, almost, to them than I love you's, everyone had that. This was theirs and theirs alone.
When their lips met,  it was with hope, like the world itself was righted, and the journey from living room back to bed was made hand in hand because tonight as the world slept, these two were free to love and be loved in return.
"Hey guys, Not that it's not great to see you outside of the kitchen Mike, but shouldn't you be, I don't know, helping Gene?" Mike scoffed and rolled his eyes as they walked slowly through the trails.
When John finally got a chance to look at his phone he was leaving the surgery for the day. As expected Sherlock hadbeen texting him all day with varying degrees of coherency. The only one he played attention to was the last one Scotland Yard -SH. Smiling to himself John hopped in a taxi to the yard.
“Right um, yes that, that would be… good. If you could get me my phone too that would be… there's an urgent text that I need to send and I can't seem to get anyone to bring mine to me so…” Sherlock's eyes tracked his hand as it reached into the pocket of his trousers and lifted out his phone.
He liked to have at least some semblance of control when entering foreign territory. There was rarely a day where John Watson was left scrambling for footing and unsure of himself. It simply did not work that way.
John grinned and showed the conversation to Sherlock who snorted as he read it "Breathlessly John? Really?" John gave a predatory smile. "Breathlessly Sherlock." Sherlock gulped.
Sherlock studied John carefully as he grasped his hand, waiting to see how he'd react to sudden contact. He'd had his suspicions that John felt something for him, more than just friends or flatmates. It intrigued him. Mostly because he had realised quite suddenly (after spending some time watching himself in a mirror) that he reacted the same way. The slight pupil enlargement and raised heart rate all pointed to one increasingly obvious conclusion: he was in love with John. Kind,caring, loyal, unwaveringly straight John. He'd heard John say it enough. These... Feelings were one sided. Only one way to know for sure. It was getting darker by the minute anyway and he could feel the tiredness oozing off of John. "Let's get a room for tonight, the search will start again in the morning."
"Green suits you" he whispered as John stood in front of the mirror. Mycroft certainly knew his stuff about suits. Of course he did, he bought Sherlock's suits and those were pure perfection in an incredibly figure hugging shirt. "You think so?" John met Sherlock's eyes in the reflection, genuinely surprised. Sherlock often told him how much he disliked John's clothes, especially recently (mainly because he was still in them) but it was definitely the first time he had admired an item if John's wardrobe. Sherlock stared at him. The black jacket enhanced John's wide shoulders and the trousers left little to the imagination in the back but were decidedly more reserved in the front. "Take the jacket off, just to be 100% positive" John shrugged the jacket off and waited for the verdict. Yes, the shirt tightened around John's biceps and again at his chest and abdomen, the most muscled areas of his body. The green set off the specks of emerald in his eyes and accentuated his tanned complexion. Sherlock caught himself wondering if John had looked this good in army camouflage. Probably was the conclusion. "Brilliant. Fantastic. Perfect"
Really he should have seen the hug coming. John was a tactile man, many of his emotions were physically expressed and happiness apparently was one of those that involved hugging. Sherlock. In a restaurant full of his peers and friends.
Mycroft sat with his head held in his hands at his desk. He couldn't say how long he'd been sat like that, after the initial burst of activity, identifying the body ("Who else could it possibly be?" he spat acidly at the bumbling pathologist Molly Hooper) and making arrangements for the funeral he had just collapsed into the chair and not gotten up. It was his fault of course, he'd fed Jim all of that information, hadn't managed to keep tabs on the man when he was released, not protected Sherlock at all. In fact if anything he was an accomplice in his death. That was a bitter pill to swallow. He'd spent his entire life looking out for Sherlock, from the time the younger boy could crawl he'd watched out for him, and yes, sometimes he failed, but never as grievously as he had this time. God he could still see a pudgy little three year old, sprinting in the endearing manner only children can, into his room from the garden with a stuffed parrot clasped in his little hands and a grin that would melt even the coldest of hearts on his face as he threw himself into Mycroft's arms squealing his gratitude for the treasure hunt he'd devised to keep the boy occupied. And he'd betrayed him, so flippantly, into the hands of a known psychopath and criminal mastermind. Way to go Mycroft, splendid job you did too he thought bitterly. Mummy was distraught, she had been since the whole debacle had started with the trial going south at the Old Bailey, yet another oversight on his part. Now the entire world believed that Sherlock had been a fraud, a manipulative liar who tried to lord his fake genius over everyone else and had gotten the comeupance he deserved. Well, all but a few. John, Mrs Hudson and the Hooper girl. He had... Hoped for better from Gregory Lestrade but he could not fault the man for being between two minds about it. In the mans own words "I know he was a genius, but why didn't he disprove all the damned evidence against himself then?"
"Come on in, what's today's name of choice?" Lucia grinned and strode in, holding her hand out to him. "Lucia. All the family knows, and now you're about to be part of it, so do you. I'm thinking of going by Esme for the day." John shook her hand and laughed happily. "Esme it is then. You look gorgeous by the way, Greg doesn't she look great?" Greg nodded and gave Lucia a cheeky wink, he knew about her and Molly too, in fact the only one who didn't know that everyone in the room was aware of their relationship was Molly herself. "Seriously, Molly, isn't she stunning?" Molly looked her up and down, from the artfully messy bun of chestnut hair, perfectly applied make up, midnight blue one sleeve gown that looked like it was made of falling leaves, down to painted toenails in silver strapped heels. She said nothing, just stared. Lucia herself was beginning to blush under the gaze and Greg coughed to ease some tension which seemed to snap Molly back to her senses. "Quite! She looks... quite beautiful." Molly squeaked in that voice that she used when Sherlock really had her flustered. Lucia really did blush then, and brushed a strand of loose hair behind her ear as she muttered a quick thank you.
Trusting his instincts to guide him had always worked well in the past, so John kept to that philosophy on the horse. It worked pretty well, he didn't look anywhere near as graceful as Sherlock, but then again he never did. Eventually he managed to catch up and keep pace. "How is it that you manage to look graceful on horseback? Is there something you don't look graceful doing?" Sherlock smirked "No, I was subjected to the pastimes of gentry from an early age, equestrian, polo, croquet, ballroom dance, that sort. It was painfully boring but I picked them up with ease to avoid spending any time on them and then deleted the majority of the information, apart from equestrian. Horses are rather useful to me at times, I'm not particularly graceful at all." John raised his eyebrows and shook his head. "We both know you are, so denying it's pointless. Where are we off to?"
"Probably the best idea" Sherlock agreed, pushing two packages in front of John and keeping two for himself.  Sherlock was left with Mary and the Yard while John got the other two and they opened them quickly, eager to be finished as much as eager to see the contents of the boxes.
Mycroft looked at all of them, his eyes sweeping over the different suits at the table. "Sherlock and I will provide suitable attire. We shall reconvene in 20 minutes by the stables." With that, The four of them took off up the stairs. Mummy smiled after they had gone. She knew they wouldn't be able to resist this perfect opportunity to show off. It was their nature after all.
To say he was disappointed in his current situation was an understatement. “I'm meant for greater things yet here I am rotting away with not even a partner to keep me grounded, ” John thought sadly. Most of his acquaintances already found their other halves, but apparently no one wanted a broken, limping ex-soldier. Age was also fast catching up with him. What luck.
Greg watched the display from his side of the backseat and smiled. It was almost cloyingly sweet but he wouldn't have wanted anything else for them. The wedding had flayed Mycroft raw emotionally, the fervour in his voice when he had assured Greg that he loved him had cut him to the core and after all the festivities and the drunken sex on the lawn, he'd decided to finally sit the man down and talk everything through once and for all.
Sherlock couldn't speak, couldn't force his raw throat to say anything just yet if he wanted to keep some dignity and avoid tears. He'd woken abruptly and forgotten that John was here, that he wouldn't have to go through this alone again, as he had done for a good three months now. He hadn't gotten any better at dealing with it, the nightmares bested him every time. Many nights had turned into days with Sherlock sat hugging his own knees and praying that John was still alive, attempting to send Mycroft a casual text asking for anything about John's current engagements. In the beginning he got a snide comment and a barrage of questions. Later on he didn't have to ask, every morning the cctv photos were there in his inbox, waiting.
"What is up with him? This is literally a dream I've had." Greg shrugged, tearing his eyes away from the game of catch that the girls had started.
John sighed with relief, he may have been in the army but he hadn't run that much in years. Sherlock never ceased to amaze him. The man had barely eaten a thing all day and yet he hadn't stopped running. Nor had he let go of the tight grip he had on Johns hand. It felt nice, safe evento have the detective so near to him. "Alright, I take it you already have a place in mind?" Sherlock smirked and continued at the same pace as before but now visibly leading. They ran for another kilometre or so until they reached a small hotel. It was perfect, secluded enough to be a hide out but near enough to society to give the safety of witnesses.
"You cannot say such things and expect me to remain unaffected! The very idea is enough to make a man weak, let alone hearing the words come from your mouth." John chuckled, steering Sherlock towards his arm chair and sitting in it himself, all the while removing articles of clothing until Sherlock was silent and he was down to vest and trousers, belt being the last thing he dropped.
Just over fifteen minutes left to get him out. There was a noise, so soft that John would have dismissed it immediately if it hadn't been so very familiar. It was the sound of a belstaff coat brushing against suit pants. He'd heard it almost every day for over a year now and it was unmistakable. Sherlock was here. Sebastian hadn't noticed, or if he had he was blatantly ignoring it. For someone who had known Moriarty, Moran was not that bright. He'd chosen a room where his back would be to the door if he wanted to watch John or do pretty much anything else. Then again Moriarty had said that he wanted a pet, he had enough genius to occupy his time with Sherlock. Sebastian growled and ran his knife softly across John's neck, tracing lightly over the veins and pausing for a heartstopping moment on the jugular. His eyes rose, cold and empty, rolled meet John's as they had before in 221b and he pursed his lips before exerting more pressure, just enough for the blade to nick the skin beneath. "I would be very careful of my next move if I were you" a husky baritone voice rang out and before he knew it Sebastian was on his back, being beaten senseless by a furious Sherlock Holmes.
"Well Holmes, now that you have my full attention, what do you make of it?" He asked, gesturing to the scattered bits of flesh around them. Holmes had been rushing about all day to find what they had now before them and there were still a few key... parts... unaccounted for. Few of Lestrade's men had been able to stomach it, a fact that brought Holmes no small amount of pleasure as it meant they were left to their own devices, a rare occurrence in their work for Scotland Yard.
"Right well um yesterday I called you both in and you just, eh, ignored me even though it's a pretty interesting case..." Sherlock scoffed, removing his mouth and loosening his grip long enough for John to flip them and take up his actions with a selfsatisfied "Ha!" Sherlock was pleased to see that most of the team had vacated the premises and were standing outside the door. Only Anderson and Donovan remained, although even Lestrade was desperately staring at the wall. "Lestrade. If you haven't noticed" his breathing hitched for just a moment as John grazed his teeth along his Adams apple "we are very busy, I told you last night and I'm telling you now, your baboons should be able to handle one case by themselves" Donovan scoffed "You're essentially getting ridden right in front of us and we're the animals?" Anderson sneered in agreement and Sherlock attempted to subtly lean his head back farther, giving John more access. "A few issues with that one Sally, but I'll start with the obvious being that it is you who stormed into our home and didn't leave even when you realised something was going on, are we a bit of a voyeur Anderson? I am perfectly within my rights to do what ever I wish with my fiancé in our home and as for being animals we all are, our bodies are composed of animal cells. Some of us are just more evolved than others" Lestrade stared open mouthed "Fiancé?" Sherlock smirked harder than ever as he held up his hand for inspection. A quick look at his hand, and an even fast glance at John's which was comfortably on his ass and Lestrade ushered his agents to the door, both of themutterly shocked. "Oh, and Sally? I prefer to top" he grinned and then gasped as John trailed his hands into his shirt.
"No. That's not all. You have me." He leaned up and touched their foreheads together with a soft smile.
It was obvious Fawnlock had a strained relationship with his brother, but there was also obvious love there. John had seen it with his own eyes. It was like each brother had forgotten how to act with the other, and therefore served to deepen the chasm that was waning between them.
Sherlock's eyes scan the plant, head tilting, "You're right, John... Maybe a daffodil..." He shrugs slightly, "I'm not very good with nonpoisonous plants."  He gives his friend a small smile, squeezing John's hand.
Pulling the fawn against him, John leant down and kissed the top of his head, avoiding the antlers. Fawnlock bleated fondly when he realized John was also taking his scent. He pressed a kiss to John's cheek after his mate pressed one to his curls, tail swishing with contentment.
"Your hair's soft, and I like its colour, it's like the grass my Maman used to make my nest when I was young." He explained softly, casting his eyes down to watch the water ripple around the mates. The fawn's ears flicked as he lifted dark palms to the water's surface, watching the warm water slip through his fingers, the Fae wriggling slightly.
Mousey had visited his wood often when his brother had first sent him to the wood, though she'd stopped when he'd snapped at her rather rudely when she'd distracted him from an experiment and had thus ruined it. Mrs. Hudson had made him visit her in his brother's realm and apologize, though she hadn't visited since.
A small smile turned up the corners of Fawnlock's mouth as his eyes lighted on his mate, "Morning, John." He mumbled in a sleep roughed voice, the fawn scooted close to rub his nose against John's affectionately.
"I'm almost done with them, if it's safe enough I throw them away, if not I ask for Mycroft's help getting rid of them," Sherlock shuts his journal and puts it down, "Do you want to go outside?" He asks softly, slipping from the bench.
"JOHN YOU FUCKING BRAT OPEN THIS DOOR AND GIVE ME MY BOOZE!" Harry pounds on the door, yelling and screaming.
"Yea.. at least it's something to look at nothing else to do around here. Seeing as I haven't got any friends.... I... um..." John clears his throat and trails off, twisting the stick in his hands again.
Closing the den back up, John made his way back home, eager to get back to his mate. It was still early afternoon when he made it back, the sun overhead melting the frost that had settled over night. John pushed open the back door to the cottage and trekked in, pulling off the pack and setting it down on a kitchen chair.
"Wh-what!?" The bully exclaims. "You watch your mouth you little shit!" The bully draws his arm back, releasing John who stumbles back, in turn, to punch Sherlock in the face. His arm, however, is grabbed tightly before he can throw his punch, he looks back to see a tall, well built high school boy in a rugby letterman jacket over his high school uniform.
John leaned into the faewn, nuzzling at the fae's soft cheek. It may have been odd interaction for two humans, but Fawnlock seemed to take to nuzzling when he was happy, so John decided to reciprocate. They were part of the same herd now, weren't they? They had each other, and while he was with the fawn he never  thought of explosions or gunshots once.  Fawnlock gave another softer bleat, he nuzzled the human back, slightly damp nose sliding against John's cheek. It was how normal members of a herd would comfort each other, yet to the fawn it felt significantly different with John. His ears twitched under the human's fingers and his tail thumbed at the oak floor as the fawn leaned closer, the sound rumbling through the fawn's chest deepened.
"You're welcome, Love. All that's mine is yours. I want you to always be comfortable while you're here, even if I'm not." He turned his head just enough so he could kiss the side of his mate's face, the purring and nuzzling making him smile. Always making him smile.
After a bit more wriggling he'd managed to roll over on his back and properly hold to John's knees, firmly but also gently. He poked his tongue out at John before smirking softly.
Mrs. Watson also observes Mycroft, there is something off about him. He is very mature, but.............. far too mature for his age.
John stared down at the mess of curls nestled against his shoulder and smiled happily, bringing his other hand around to pet the side of an antler.
"Tell me more about being your mate. Is there a ceremony to go through? Does this make me your royal consort?" John chuckled and snuggled up to Fawnlock, wasting a bit more time before he went to go make the soup.
The Fawn's gaze flashed to the human momentarily as it spoke, but soon his attention was recaptured as  the warg growled once more. Fawnlock's ears twitched and his tail flicked before he sprang across the river, landing on the soppy bank and stepping closer to the warg, charge intended, the warg yelped in surprise and turned tail into the brush, the Fawn stormed after. The warg was easily caught, not before it bit him, but that could wait, and disposed of the beastly warg. Fawnlock made his way back to the human, easily crossing the river and padding up the bank. He stopped a few feet before the human, a hand clamped over the bite, eyes scrutinizing over him with keen pale eyes. His work was done, the human saved, yet for some reason he couldn't bare to leave it yet.
John seems to completely miss the point that they are being insinuated to be in a homosexual relationship, even though they are children. Sherlock the local freak genius and John the tiny, smart boy who follows the freak around. It does not even cross his mind that people are frightened of them.
The fawn stumbled back through the forest, a little later than usual. He bleated softly in pain, blood was smudged down the side of his face, there was blood splattered on his fur, and there was blood running down his torso from three gashes in across his chest. He finally made it back to John's cottage, as if on instinct he checked if the protection spells were intact before he padded clumsily into the clearing, lacking his usual grace.
The Fae’s speckled digits massaged his mate's scalp, fingertips skimming the shell of John's ear. The fawn considered John's question for a few moments, fingers working through his mate's hair.
Mycroft had noticed the change in the atmosphere as Sherlock and mummy had been reading, but Sherlock stopped and snapped his book shut.  Their aunt hadn't told him anything and he wouldn't force it out of her. It just hurts to see Sherlock so confused and upset.
"You're welcome Captain." John leans his head against Sherlock, staring at the sky with him. Until Winston calls the three of them in for dinner.
John reached out and threaded their fingers together over the blank pages, squeezing his hand gently and then turning his head to properly kiss Fawnlock, catching his lips rather than his cheek. When he broke away, he smiled at his mate, staring into his silvery eyes.
Even though the meeting with Fawnlock's git of a brother was looming close, John no longer felt worry about it. Happiness had pushed all those uncomfortable thoughts out of his head, replacing them with the thoughts of his growing family instead.
Harry's gaze narrows slightly, but takes in the sight of Sherlock and her brother, he'd made a friend, "Well," she sighs, "It's alright, I guess. You didn't get hurt, just tell me where you're going next time." She moves to ruffle John's hair teasingly, "Aren't you going to introduce me, Johnny?"
John does as he is told, carefully scooping up the mouse in his hands and brings him over to the table where the cage is.
The fawn slumped slightly as he ate the soup, after a bit he settled his bowl back on the tray to take up a slice of bread and sniff at it carefully. It didn't look like Mrs. Hudson's homemade bread, it didn't quite smell the same either, but after a few seconds scrutinizing the bread slice, Fawnlock shrugged slightly and took a bite, bleating at the different but pleasant taste.
John turned off the lights in the kitchen and made sure the door was locked, then returned to the nest to sit beside his mate. He smiled when he saw the modified jumper in Fawnlock's hands and moved around in front of him, taking it from the fae and smoothing it out.
Once at the Holmes residence. John and Sherlock sprint, giggling toward Sherlock's room wanting to get their home work done so they can spend the rest of the weekend in each other's company, uninterrupted.
Molly and Lucia reappeared, Molly now wearing an adorable yellow short sleeved dress that matched her bow exactly and John couldn't help but think that they made a perfectly mismatch pair. Lucia gave a wolf whistle to which Molly put two thumbs up enthusiastically. "You look damn fine John, arm candy much? Greg you don't look awful either." Greg blew her a kiss which she caught with a wink and all four had a good laugh. Mrs Hudson abruptly ran in with a little bouttonnière for Greg, a beautiful blue orchid that she hurriedly pinned to his chest and then spun round, grabbed John and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. "You look wonderful dear, all of you do, but I have to rush you because it's time for everyone to be in their places and I'm all in a tizzy. John I'll take you to the altar, Inspector you escort these two lovely ladies to their seats and then get to the gazeebo there's a good boy. John?" John straightened his jacket one last time and Greg pulled him into a tight hug "This is the worst part, just drown out everyone's voices and go to your happy place until the music starts." he whispered and John nodded, glad to have that last bit of advice. He wished his parents could have been there, or Harry, but looking around at his new makeshift family, he knew there was as much support waiting for him here as there ever could have been. "Right you are Mrs Hudson" he smiled and held out his arm for her to grasp his elbow, after all she did have a bad hip and they made their way out to the garden.
“...Yes, she's quite well regarded in her field apparently, but of course that's the thing about being a doctor - your field is so full of people ready to pat your back one minute and strangle you with your stethoscope the next!” Mummy laughed and Mycroft's eyes lit up.
“..and as I said earlier, I didn't and still don't, deserve the kindness he showed me when..when we first met. I don't deserve him. I'm a sociopath, Mummy, and sociopaths aren't exactly meant to lead happy lives alongside their better halves.”
being having an irate woman yelling at him while he smirked and occasionally interjected with incredibly intimate details about her life.
Making a turn at the end of the still-familiar corridor, Sherlock stopped just outside the cupboard and took a deep breath. Sneaking a quick glance to his left and right, Sherlock stuck out his hand, grasped the door handle and attempted to maneuver his long limbs into the narrow space. It was a very tight fit, but he'd made it, however he had to resort to sitting cross-legged on the floor, his shoulders almost as wide as the cupboard itself.
“What? God, no! She's lovely, she is, but-” John cut off, eyes darting to Sherlock's and back, cheeks reddening. “I.. There’s someone else, erm-”
"Ms. Adler? Coach Lestrade." He offered his hand for her to shake and she accepted with a slight smile. "And this must be your team. Welcome to Lobelia boys." She surveyed them like they were cattle at market for only milliseconds before turning and opening the doors. "We agreed that each of you would dance but not what style you would be partaking in. Sit." John sat quickly in a semi circle with the lads, helplessly admiring the dance studio she had brought them into. Four walls of mirrors and a sleek wooden floor, the barre running across one wall brought back memories of a life he'd left for footie.
John chuckled at his expression and leaned into his ear "Strawberry daquiri" he yelled. Sherlock committed the name to memory for future cases. If he had to get drunk for the work he might as well have a more pleasing taste in his 's foot was tapping lightly of it's own accord and Sherlock was anxious to get started so they could leave. He whipped out his phone and began to type furiously. John's phone came to life moments later. I'm going to go find the owner, you stay here, keep an eye out. Ten minutes and I should have all I need -SH John looked up and the man had disappeared already. The song changed, a remix of pussy cat dolls Buttons and John was done for. His legs were moving of their own accord to the dancefloor, standing almost directly in the intercept of the lasers and spotlight, and he began to move.
Sherlock frowns deeply, hugging John. He winces slightly at Harry's yelling, grip tightening on John. He doesn't know where to go, so he just sits on the tiled floor, dragging John with him.
He peers up at Mycroft and Mrs. Watson, "Are we going now?" He asks excitedly, practically vibrating in his spot.
"You too! Goodbye!"  Mycroft watches the rugby player as he leaves, face breaking out into a brilliant smile and a blush on his cheeks.
With a chuckle, John set one hand in the fae's hair and ruffled his curls up, the damp locks already starting to kink up. His other arm wrapped around the fawn's shoulders, tracing over his spine and shoulder blades. The fawn gave a soft bleat at the gentle fingertips skimming over his furred back, and the hand ruffling his wild damp curls.
Sherlock caught himself before he could let slip that the doctor could not possibly love a drug addict like him. His parents did not deserve to know about that shameful part of him; he could not bear the thought of destroying the small bubble of normality the family still had. There were rifts here and there but the Holmeses were still going strong, and Sherlock was not about to be the one to cause it all to come crumbling down. He had to think of a response, and a convincing one at that, if he were to get past Christmas (
Lily beamed and made a gesture like a judge banging a gavel "The floor is now open for your reasoning. Sally?" The curly haired woman shrugged a little. Molly frowned "Actually Sally, come to think of it, you don't really know Mrs Hudson or Angelo that well at all. Why them?" Struggling to find the words to explain adequately Sally sighed "They're hopeful, I mean, Mrs Hudson had a husband once who treated her really badly and Angelo was so distraught after his wife died... They're old. They just kind of prove that you can find love again, and that there's no limit as to when you do. Neither of them has to be alone and I think that is sweet. I've only seen them together once but they might as well be an old married couple, they have each other sussed and it's really cute to watch the familiarity that they share you know, they just know the other even though they'very not been together long at all." Lily gave a solemn nod to Sally as she finished. That was a good reason.
In John's room he sat next to the bed, watching him. His torso was covered in a white bandage, one for the cracked ribs and the other for the nine holes in his stomach. The doctors had been very clear that the burns would scar, indeed branding John with his military identity for life. The swelling in his face had gone down and John looked like himself again, if battered slightly more than he was used to. It was five am and Sherlock was exhausted. He lay his face next to John's hand on the bed and fell asleep almost instantly. John woke first, wincing slightly at the pain in his chest. Sherlock raised his head to look at John and he smiled weakly. John coughed and grinned back, grasping Sherlock's hand in his own.
"We should come back and collect some for Mrs. Hudson then. She'll surely appreciate it. And maybe give us some biscuits to take home." Which he knew would make the fawn happy. Leaning forwards, he kissed Fawnlock, tasting the berries there and licking his lips a bit before sitting back.
John adjusted his pace to match the thrusts of the fae's narrow hips, speeding up his strokes to match the urgency of every sharp buck. It was nearly too much for John to bear, the trembling of his mate pushed up against him, and the soft stutter that he could barely speak.
"Today? It'd be best to not let you fall behind, yes?" His blush deepens slightly, heart racing, he is certain Greg can hear it.  "I'll," he clears his throat. "I'll see you after then, hm?"
He gave up on being passive and let his hands roam as well, curving over the fawn's backside and grasping his bum, kneading into the muscle. As Fawnlock's mouth slid over his collar bone, John shuddered and pulled the fawn closer against him. Humming low in his throat, he rubbed his cheek against the velvety ear flicking beside his face, reveling in every touch of lips to his bare skin. He had no problem letting the fawn learn his body, and he wanted to do the same himself, to touch every inch of skin and catalog what made Fawnlock blush the most, what made him desperate for more and kick into that rumbling purr that drove John crazy with need.
The more the fawn turned to him, dragging hands and nose across his skin, John drew a blank of exactly what it was he was going to do. All he could focus on was Fawnlock moving closer and that low rumble stirring. John hummed and reached for the fae's waist, dragging him closer still, until he was sitting in John's lap. The nest could wait a bit, couldn't it? Winding an arm around Fawnlock's lower back, he steadied the fawn and leaned up to kiss under his chin, just above where the thicker ruff began to grow.
John passes the plant to Sherlock so he can unlock his apartment door and is greeted by the site of his older sister drinking from a bottle her cheeks rosy and her posture unsteady as she stumbles through the foyer to the kitchen.  John frowns, why does she keep doing this?
John looks up at Sherlock in awe, simply impressed by the boy two years younger than him and yet 100 times smarter than him. At that thought, John looks down sheepishly. "You must think I'm really simple minded if that's what you like to do...." He feels stupid for saying that, but if they are being honest, he doesn't want to lie now.
John tries to smile at Sherlock. He didn't want to lose Sherlock as a friend if he knew about Harry. He just wanted one friend who liked him for him. At least it will be a new school year and Harry will be in secondary school. So any new people won't even know of the relation. Maybe he can befriend one of those kids.
"I- I'd love to, Shakespeare is a personal favorite of mine." He looks down, closing his locker. "I don't have any study halls, so after school?"
A little blush crept over the fawn's cheeks under his fur, "John, do you have something to put water in? I can wade to where the water's cleaner for you." He offered softly. John shook the water droplets from his hair and smoothed it back with a smile.
Sherlock stares up at the spot in the dusky sky, following John's point, smiling softly. He moves to John's side, almost vibrating with excitement.
Sherlock's brows furrow as he picks up another piece and examines it closely by turning it over in his hands as he thinks.
The older teen leads Mycroft down the hall, past the kitchen, his mum's room, until he's at his bedroom door. He pushes open the door and peeks inside, frowning at the slight mess. He gestures Mycroft inside, skirting around the younger teen, tidying up nervously.
John felt absolutely drowned out in bliss, between the mouth and hands roaming over his chest, to the narrow hips rubbing against each other and sending beautiful jolts of pleasure rolling slowly up along his body. The lazy intimacy was appealing to him and he wouldn't have traded it for anything. He loved being touching as well as touching, their fingers unable to stop roaming over each other's bodies. That rumbling purr started up and John was in heaven
"At least he tries to, I spend most of my time making certain Sherlock is cared for and has as fulfilling of a childhood as possible."
A corner of the fawn's lips twitched up in a little pleasant smile, his eyes fluttering closed as he as well reached through the bond, opening up to his mate. The fawn trusted John and his own instincts to keep him balanced and on the path, he took a deep pleasant breath then released it through his dark nose in a soft huff. Fawnlock's eyes fluttered open a few moments later and his smile grew, he moved to wrap an arm around John and pull him closer, the rumbling of the fae's chest vibrating them both as walked. The pair was close to his den, the fawn could feel it deep inside, and because of their bond, he was sure John could feel it too.
John considered for a moment, flushing himself before clearing his throat. "You huffed when I cleaned you up afterwards. Does that...does that carry scent with it too?"
When the fawn nosed under John's ear, the man closed his eyes and sighed, tilting his head to give Fawnlock more of his neck to nuzzle at. After a while, he became too hot as his skin flushed, desiring more contact as well. Shifting back just a bit, he drew his hands down to the hem of his jumper and tugged it up over head, mussing up his short blond hair in the process. Dropping the clothing to the floor behind them, he moved forwards and drew the fawn against him once more.
The Fae chuckled softly, squeezing John's finger reassuringly, "Don't worry John, after a while moving around the woods quietly will come to you easily. When you learn the forest well enough, allot will come to you naturally." He resumed his quiet humming.
"I'll see you again soon." He murmured before turning and padding off into the wood. He stopped at the edge of the clearing and set a small protective spell over the cottage, it wasn't that he didn't trust Mrs. Hudson's spells but he wanted to be very sure.
John ran his fingers over his mate's name, then took back the graphite and wrote it in his own hand, putting a bit more effort into making it look neat. Not that it ever would be elegant, John was left handed and the words would always come out a little wobbly.
The fawn stayed silent for a few moments, tucked up against John, breathing softly, calming himself. After a while he raised a hand to John's shoulder, accidentally smearing their releases into the human's skin. His other hand tightened in John's hair, the fawn pressing closer as his ears twitched faintly. Fawnlock's eyes flickered open to meet his mate's, and he raised his head to pepper kisses and nuzzles across the human's face.
John tilted his head up to watch the two obnoxiously taller brothers, a bit taken back. Another fae had shown an interest in the fawn, yet he'd not want a relationship with her. Was it because she was a female. John remembered the first day they'd met; the Fawn had been nothing but sweet to him, and they'd practically been married days afterwards.
"We'll be best friends forever Captain, don't you forget it." John beams at his friend and the strokes Sirius gently.
Baking, of course was not something he'd done often, and his recipes were few and far between. Some quick bake sweet breads, cinnamon buns, and maybe a few other biscuits. It was a start though, enough to keep Fawnlock delighted until he learned more. And surely Mrs. Hudson could help with recipes. He probably had a few books in the cottage from his aunt as well they could sort through.
The fawn’s ears dropped slightly as he raised his head. He pressed his lips to each of John's cheeks, then his nose, and finally his lips. The Fae's dark palms slid up the human's back once more, his speckled fingers tapping John's vertebrae gently as they went. He bleated softly, nuzzling the human's neck once more, damp nose rubbing against the human's skin. He snuffled softly, taking in John's intoxicating scent with a soft smile.
"/If you do not believe me, if you want to judge him for who he is, come to my wood and meet him. A formal invitation into my realm for once./"
As Fawnlock reached up and tipped his chin up, John felt such a wave of warmth slip through him. He knew he was shorter than most, had dealt with it most of his life. Still, he had more than made up for his height by showing his worth in other ways, rising through the ranks in the army. But now, now he was happy to be this height, able to tuck himself under the fawn's chin, to be tilted up like this, to be able to fit. He fit right here with Fawnlock. John smiled and lifted his hands to curl around the fae's, raising his dusky fingers up so John could kiss his fingertips.
"/I'm not a child, and I'm not that bad,/" he muttered in his native tongue with a huff, pouting slightly.
The fawn swiped his thumb over the head of John's cock, gathering beads of pre-ejaculate to smear around his love's prick. Fawnlock sped up his hand, other dark hand snaking down to stroke over the warm skin of John's inner thighs, the purr-like rumble vibrating through his chest to John's body. The fawn bowed his head slightly to pepper the golden columned his mate's throat, nipping lightly.
He hummed happily as he set the kettle on to boil, then sat in a chair at the kitchen table and pulled off his boots and socks. Curling his toes in the soft woven rug, he watched Fawnlock with a dreamy expression on his face till the kettle whistled, rousing him back up onto his feet to pour them both cups. Adding sugar and honey like the fawn liked, he then bought the cups back to him, sitting down beside him next to the crackle fire and setting the mug into the speckled fingers to warm them up.
"I'd like that," he gave a slight nod, smiling softly. "This project isn't actually that dull." He stated after a mischievous twinkle in his eye.
At the woman's invitation, John smiled brilliantly. He would very much appreciate a distraction while he waited. "I'd like that very much." He called after her, then turned back to accept the weight of his mate burrowing back against him, sitting more on John than the sofa.
After John had put Sirius into the cage the chocolate brown mouse immediately began exploring his new home, sniffing about.
Mycroft smiles sadly at his brother. It is so sad to see him, just like himself... lacking the innocence that he so deserved. With that on his consciousness, he brings out his text and studies as well until they are called for supper by their aunt.
Mycroft tries to reach out and touch his brother's curls again, but the seven-year-old flinches a bit. "Just think about it, Sherlock. I'm hoping that next year will be better."
The man flashed a wider smile up at Moosecroft, though he was hardly on John's favorite people list for what he'd put Fawnlock through. But he was family, and having him approve of their bond was important to his mate, no matter how strongly he had insisted he didn't need it.
John let go and pulled away from his mate, planting a kiss on a dappled cheek before climbing out of the nest to go turn off the soup and ladle them out two bowls. It did smell lovely, and truly nothing was a better remedy than home cooked soup. He found a tray and set up the bowls of soup on it, and some glasses of water from the tap and a few slices of bread before carrying the whole thing back to the nest. Normally he would have insisted on eating at the kitchen table, but he was prone to spoiling the fawn since he wasn't feeling well.
John took his own blanket and unfolded it to set in the nest as well, mimicking Fawnlock's actions. Running his hand over the thick duvet, he turned and looked at his mate, listening as his voice became soft. He could tell that this wasn't just them making a bed to sleep in. This was something very special to Fawnlock, something that connected him to his mother. A nest was warmth, was love, was family. It was bittersweet that the fae had been building them so long just to lay in them alone. To John, it wasn't a feminine thing. He didn't see the fawn like that, no matter how gorgeous he was. It was sad he didn't get along well with his brother, because it was evident that family was important to him. John wished he could have given his mate the big, loving family he deserved. But he'd have to settle for John. And in return, John would give him that amount of love he deserved and more.
John rose an eyebrow, he wasn't going to go off running like some unruly child. But these were magical woods, so who was he to assume it was anything so petty. So he nodded, clutching at Fawnlock's hand as they made their way into the forest.
Trusting his mate, his slid his hand off Fawnlock's hip completely, moving it instead down between his own legs and stroking the turgid, thick length pressing against his inner thigh, releasing some of the pressure that was building into almost unbearable pain with how much this was arousing him. John groaned around the cock in his mouth, lips stretched in a wide circle where they met the heated flesh.
Mycroft waves his brother off, instead of going with him this morning, he decided to read a book for pleasure and drink some tea.
"/You can understand me!/" Fawnlock snuffled at his mate, pressing a kiss to his neck, enjoying the rough of John's stubble. "/Oh, this is brilliant,/" The fawn easily switched between the two languages, "our bond had strengthened this much already!" The Fae exclaimed excitedly, "Oh there's so many thing we can do, test your boundaries with this, oh, amazing, fantastic!"  The Fea was practically vibrating with excitement.
The Fae bleated excitedly in agreement, his tail swishing from side to side as he searched for his rosin, dark hands dipping into the various baskets throughout the den before he finally found the lump of resin with a triumphant bleat. Soon the fawn was rosining his bow gently, ears twitching as he mentally prepared to play for his mate.
The older teen gives a cheeky grin, though he'd be lying if he said he wasn't overly relieved at Mycroft's words. "Of course I will."
Once he pulled on pants and denims, and found a soft, comfy jumper and vest, John turned to face the fawn, who instantly reached out for John and buried his face in the woolen bit of clothing.
John bit his lip as Fawnlock kissed his scar, but the words that followed were what really touched him. The fae never ceased to amaze John, so sweet and kind. And the way he so utterly adored John, the man had no doubt this was his soul mate, everything he'd been looking for his entire life. He'd never have thought he's find someone so beautiful and smart however, whose very touch made John feel like a fire had been stoked throughout his insides.
"Okay." Winston clasps his hands, scooting close to the fire so that his face is shadowed. "Ghost stories... I'll begin. A long long time ago..." John listens intently, leaning into Sherlock just in case story got scary. Even Mycroft listens with a small smile on his face.
Sherlock laughs as the tiny octopus clings to his friend's hand, and moves off his fingers. "We should probably put it back, it looks like a baby." He smiles as he kneels by the pool once more. He reaches into the water to pick out a piece of coral.
John hugs him a moment longer, pulling back to look him in the face. "I didn't know you were coming here. You're a few years younger than me." He cocks his head to the side. Happy, but confused.
John was very gentle, not wanting to do anything that might scare off his mate. Fawnlock was endlessly precious to him, and his trust even more so. When he was sure that Fawnlock was enjoying himself, he moved to take more of him down into his mouth, coaxing the sensitive flesh deeper inside with guiding swirls of his tongue.
Mycroft looks over Sherlock's work and nods, then smiles down at Sherlock, "Perfect, yet again Sherlock." He smiles and hugs the small boy, pressing a kiss to the top of his head. "You will certainly be moved up at least two levels. For your sake, I hope its two or three. You will excel at the more difficult courses if you are already doing calculus!" Mycroft cuddles Sherlock and ruffles his curls to bother him slightly, "You're going to do so well in the world Sherly!"
John looks up at the older boy who had helped them and clings to Sherlock, pulling him to his feet. He stares at the kind, comforting look on his face and reaches his free hand to take the teenagers.
When the fawn finally agreed to meet his brother and leaned forwards to pepper John's face in kisses, the blond couldn't help but laugh, grinning under every touch of lips that covered his face. He squeezed the fawn tight, hoping to convey confidence and assurance into the embrace.
Sherlock nods and picks up the universal plot piece and lays it on the floor. "Okay, so this piece goes." He picks up a piece and looks at the booklet which he had smoothed out on the floor between the two boys, "Here," he slides it into place.
Licking the jam from his fingertips, John then scooted back towards the fire and took off his coat, using the material as a barrier and he picked up the heated thermos and unscrewed the top, pouring the amber colored liquid into the cup. Waiting for it to cool, he lifted it up and drained a longer swallow, warming him from the inside out. It was a little sweeter than he liked it, but he had made it for Fawnlock after all. The rest of the tea was saved for the fae's return to warm him up from the cold outside, and John toed off his boots and returned to the nest, smoothing out the quilts into a lovely makeshift bed for the both of them.
John felt the fawn nuzzle at the side of his head and closed his eyes, sighing into the press of cheek and nose skimming over his hair. It'd been a long while since anyone had been this close with him, since he'd allowed anyone to get this close to him. Not even his sister Harry , who wasn't much of the hugging or caring type. The fawn's hands on his shoulders surprisingly didn't even hurt. All too soon, Fawnlock was pulling back though, starring off through the window. John looked at him curiously, but when he explained himself, he nodded with a faint smile. "I understand. I'll see you tomorrow?" He released Fawnlock and stood, then held out his hand to help his new friend up off the floor. "I'll look forwards to spending more time with you."
"Mmm...you may be somewhat biased." He murmured with a smile, watching the fawn lift up his soup and inhale the steam wafting off the bowl.
"Daffodils are lovely.  I really like yellow - and blue."  John looks the plant over and then his gaze settles back on Sherlock.
When the fae returned, and stretched the parchment out, John concentrated, watching him write out the letters and searching for that switch that seemed to have manifested in his mind. He could see the glyphs properly now, spelling out his name in the fae language. He could still read them smoothly though, and smiled broadly, accepting the bit of graphite and wrote out his name, less elegantly, but that seemed to be the usual fate of doctors to have hardly legible handwriting.
The fawn muffled a loud moan in John's shoulder, fingers tightening in his hair. He cried out softly as John's thumb swiped over the tip of his prick, bucking up sharply. Small tears gathered at the corners of Fawnlock's eyes, the pleasure was wonderful, the fawn couldn't help but rut into his mate's hand.
He hummed softly as he tail swished, gaze roaming over John, "But thank you anyway, John, our nest will be lovely no matter what." He smirked softly.
Sherlock chuckles softly at his friend's antics and the nice feeling of John's fingers on his hair. "What do you mean, John?" He asks, eyes on John's.
John gets up and clings to Sherlock's arm, still shaking a bit, "Let's just order our take away and then ... hide in my room."
"I am too. Making you happy is very important to me. I think it's wonderful that you have this connection with your mum. It's like she's here, helping us build our home together." John raised his other hand to place it over his mate's heart, feeling that sweet rumble beneath his fingers. "She's already in here, as well as me."
The Fae nodded, sipping her tea, "Ah, yes, the woods are very magical here, ancient too, the other Fae are mostly kind too, they say this is one of most magical woods. Fawnlock's a great guardian.. Mostly." She tilted her head, "Though when he goes into a good sulk, oh the whole wood suffers..." She sighed softly. There's the sound of the door opening and closing, a bleat and then the padding of feet up the hall. "That'll be him, the dear." She smiles and stands as the fawn enters, going to hug him, "Hello, dear, there's tea and biscuits, I'll take this." She chuckled as the fawn handed her the basket of fruits, berries, nuts and fish. "Oh, you did good, Fawnlock thank you, you take such good care of me." She pecked his cheek and scurried off into the kitchen. The fawn's ears dropped as a light blush tinted his cheeks. He bowed his head slightly, moved to the floor by John, "Hello, John."
The fawn’s rutting quickened, soft moans escaping his lips along with his huffed, broken breathing and whispers of John's name. His body felt as if it would combust, his damp fur brushing and pressing against John's damp skin, it feeling as if sparks flew with every movement the mates made, the Fae whimpered softly once more. Rounds of broken speech in English and his native tongue, along with sharp gasps, soft bleats, whimpers and breathless moans passed Fawnlock's lips before he captured his bottom lip between his teeth, worrying the already abused flesh.
John grinned at the similarity between the two, and moved further into the cottage to pull off his apron and hang it up beside the pantry. He moved to stand beside his mate, watching him huff and fuss, but knowing underneath it, he was happy to have the approval of his sibling. As Fawnlock nibbled at his biscuit, John leaned in and kissed his cheek as it puffed out, full of sugar and jam.
Fawnlock's fingers tightened in John's hair as his mate began to bob his head, sufficiently blinding the fawn with white hot pleasure. A broken stream of moans and mumblings of his native tongue escape his patted lips, his ears falling limp as pleasure surges through his velvet furred body. When John loosened his hold on the Fae's hip, he groaned softly, gently and shallowly thrusting his hips up into John's deliciously wonderful mouth, not wanting to gag or hurt his brilliant mate.
He pulls away from John with a smile, slipping his bag from his lap to the floor but not before opening it slightly so John could see Bilbo. He presses his finger to his lips briefly before he gives a giggle and zips his bag closed.
After the fae finished his care, he ran a speckled fingertip over the bow lightly to check, then he plopped gracefully onto the nest. John shifted to give his mate plenty of room to play.
John gets his balance and grins, taking Sherlock's hand, feeling safer in the tree by doing so, "Oh wow!" John exclaims, looking out over the tree branches and getting a fantastic view of the Holmes mansion and parts of London.
It seemed they had pretty much been doing things correctly more or less, even though John had fairly fumbled through the beginning of their courtship. Smoothing the blanket flat, John looked back up to his mate as he grew restless, fidgeting.
Greg offers a warm smile as he looks out over the road, no more than a few minutes till they were at his house. He tilts his head at Mycroft's question.
Mycroft rests his cheek on top of Sherlock's head as he checks his brother's work. Perfect as usual. So brilliant.
John settled in to hear Fawnlock's story, which was punctuated with nuzzles and kisses, that almost nearly distracted the blond. But he hung on every word spoken in that rich, deep baritone, flexing his arms to hold his mate tighter as he revealed bits of his past.
Fawnlock's fingers curled into the fabric of John's shirt, the rumble quieting slightly as he sensed his mate falling into sleep. He cuddled up and laid his head comfortably on John's good shoulder, eyelids fluttering, he wouldn't usually be tired, but the fawn was exhausted after facing his brother after so long, along with his almost turmoil about his true self and mate.
John recognised that tone a mile off. “Hey hey hey. Not your fault. He might be one of yours, but you didn't force him onto that case and you sure as hell didn't stab him and push him into a river. I've been where you're headed right now and trust me, it's not a path you want to walk down.”
An idea seemed to come to John suddenly as he surged forward in a split second of movement. "What are you here for actually Mycroft? I know why I'm here, feel a bit entitled to pine a little for him but why are you here in the middle of the bloody night?" Mycroft chuckled at the pining bit and then he sighed. "I came to apologise to him, to you too." John nodded briefly and stood up, holding out a hand for Mycroft to grasp as he pulled him up too, rain melting them both. "Come on, I'll make us some tea back at baker street. I think you could use someone to talk to about him, someone who cared as much as you do. I'm not saying that I'll forget, but I forgive you Mycroft. For both of us." Mycroft felt a weight lift from his chest when John said that and allowed his grief to flood him properly for the first time when John embraces him. "I'm so sorry Mycroft." he muttered into the shoulder of his suit. "I'm sorry too John." They left together, and Mycroft, in a fit of sentimentality that he had not prepared for, left his umbrella sheltering Sherlock's grave, protecting him one last time.
"You're not wrong there mate, you're not wrong there." And as they finally made it onto the plane where Sherlock and Mycroft were awaiting them, John knew this week was going to be unforgettable.
Snow was falling in small flakes, covering the streets of London in a veil of pristine white, frosting each building like icing sugar. The sense of community that suddenly appeared with this strange weather was fitting for the festive season. Suddenly the people of London were sticking together, offering help to those in need of it, calmly waiting for traffic to ease up, smiling at each other in the streets. They were, at least for now, a community united by cold fronts and Christmas spirit. It was hard to deny this feeling of camaraderie that had sprung up from nothing. It was simply there, as constant as air. Too long had passed since the people of London thought about the well being of their fellow Londoners and it was refreshing. Didn't stop the criminal world, but everyone else was more aware of those who suffered at their hands at least. Sherlock was pretty pleased with the setup, any witness that was interrogated was more forthcoming in their response than ever, allowing for cases to be solved more efficiently. The faster a case was over the faster he could take John home and snuggle up in front of the fire together.
in the morning Lestrade? It's hardly a difficult deduction. Obviously he was a heavy gambler who bit off more than he could chew when he tried to swindle a group of dealers and accrued a small fortune that only garnered more attention, when he was sought out he defended himself but ultimately managed to kill himself and the man sent to rob him at the same time. Class it how you will, you're looking for the neighbour, 6'2", glasses, works in the local deli restaurant, will recommend the pot pie, don't eat it unless you've got a hankering for salmonella." Sherlock hung up on the detective, it wasn't even an interesting case but he'd been so edgy that he'd had to do something. At least now he'd be able to act normally, well, what they passed as normal, around John. No sooner had the thought popped into his mind and John appeared, upset, obviously, but not to a degree where it would affect their every waking moment. Acceptance of the situation was the predominant emotion. No five stages of grief for John, but the man had been a soldier, death, violent and bloody and agonizing had Ben his life. This,a quiet slipping away would be almost like a gift. He needn't have nightmares of wasting away and writhing in agony."Sherlock? Hello?" John was waving a hand in front of his face. "Mm? What did she say?" Sherlock asked nonchalantly, smiling encouragingly and strolling away with John at his side. "Asked us to use her gift and not to even think of using the name Harry." John half smiled "She always did hate that name."
Sherlock all but screamed his frustration into the now empty room. It had been too dark to really get the nuances of John's ever changing expressions , but the fact was that Sherlock knew the standoffish, abrupt pattern of speech the doctor had adopted was not normal. Something - outside of Sherlock being his usual stubborn self - had upset him. Something to do with Sherlock certainly, but not to do with his request to see him. In fact, Sherlock smirked, the almost imperceptible sigh of relief that John had emitted when he closed the door on the way into the room suggested the opposite. The tension that had remained in his muscles, standing and poised to fight or flee added a conflicting layer to the thing, but nothing that couldn't be worked out by a few minutes of logical thought.
Ever alert, John strode into the common corridor of the A&E at St Bart’s and nudged his way past the bustling nurses into room two. The nurse at the head of the bed was already in the process of intubating the collapsed patient when she promptly informed the doctor of the patient’s condition.
"He's always been like that, whenever anything sexual comes up in conversation he just kind of goes away, he's a pretty shy guy about that sort of stuff here, but I've heard stories about him back home that you wouldn't believe.They call him Three Continents Watson at school according to my cousin's friend's sister's aunt's new neighbour. Maybe he's having summer dry spells and he can't break the curse! You know what I'm thinking?" Mike shook his head and Greg wondered how exactly it was unclear but explained himself anyway.
When Greg arrived in the morning with paperwork and coffee he whipped out his phone and took a picture of the two of them wrapped up in each other, with John smiling into Sherlock's chest and Sherlock's head drooped onto John's own. Only when he was satisfied with the shot did he wake Sherlock up. Sherlock was a true genius most of the time but the morning, first thing after waking, was his only exception. Sherlock rubbed his eye and yawned, snuggling into John even more before speaking to Lestrade with his eyes closed "What's goin on?" He asked blurrily and Greg had a disturbing vision of Sherlock in airplane covered pyjamas carrying a blankie around with him. "I brought paperwork and coffee. I think coffee should go first." Sherlock rubbed his eyes and sat up by degrees, careful to stay very still lest he dislodge John from his position. Greg thrust the cup into his hands and waited until he was actually awake before handing him the papers and a pen. Lestrade had his own work to do, and they sat there together, the only noises were the light scratch of pen on paper, the whirring and beeping of machines and John's breathing. It was almost exactly the same situation they had been in when John had been taken in the first place. Sherlock couldn't help but wonder that if the outcome of their mission had been different, would he even be here at all? Maybe he would. He'd have been in the ER or the morgue by now surely, because there was no way he would have stayed after losing John. He wouldn't have had any reason to live anymore. How John had changed him.
Had he looked, Sherlock would have seen the shaking hand Molly held over her mouth as tears ran down her face, and the pitying look Mrs Hudson was shooting his way, but he had eyes for only one, and that one had heard nothing, for every note was an I love you, and every rest a call to come home.
"Well then, Sherlock, I should make my intentions clear. You are much too handsome to adorn my walls, but I would quite like you between my sheets, that is, if you're not too busy?" John's breath warmed his neck, lips just barely brushing the skin exposed by his collar. The case could wait a few hours, he already had a second suspect in mind, and the manner in which John Watson had ensnared him was worth further study. Between his sheets indeed.
Somehow the stress he'd been feeling about the situation, didn't go away when the reason for it did. Instead, a new feeling joined it, one John had seldom felt since coming home.
"And your people are certain that they're in here Mycroft? Because this seems a bit strange even for them." Greg said, holding his phone to his ear as he closed to door of his squad car.
The light began to turn rose, and John smiled out at the view of beams of sunlight through the trees and bushes. A glimmer of blue twinkled in the gaps between trees and John knew what he wanted to do tonight. "I
Sherlock scowled back at him from the back seat and pulled out his phone, already finished listening to what his brother had to say. Mycroft sighed and began to close the door before pausing. “Oh, and Sherlock? Do try to avoid showing up high, it really does lower the tone of the afternoon.” With that parting jab he shut the door and Sherlock rolled away from the hospital, back into his life. If he looked back a little bit more frequently than he could justify, well, there was no one there to see it.
John was very pleased at the moment that Sherlock didn't pay attention to his comings and jewelers appointment had gone very well, Sherlock had actually planned to go to the morgue anyway and John has been there and back before Sherlock had even thought about going home. It had been pretty quick, mainly because he knew precisely what he wanted. Well mostly, the ring had been a difficult enough decision but the other thing, that had been easy. The women who ran the shop had been very accommodating, flirting heavily with him though he was obviously not available and they even knew that Sherlock was a man, still didn't stop them from trying. He was going back to pick up his special order. The younger of the two seemed to understand him a whole lot better than most people, especially the not gay thing. He'd expected that people would just assume that he was gay, and he didn't have any issue with that, but she seemed to just know that men, aside from one tall, dark, handsome genius did nothing for him. It was a nice change to have someone see it the way it was. She was who he was going to meet with that afternoon. "Molly?... Melissa?... Margaret?... Mary? Mary. That's it, Mary Morstan." he muttered to himself as he walked briskly to the shop. It would have been very embarrassing not to know her name, but in truth he was having trouble remembering the names of ordinary people these days, they all just seemed to blur together. "Aaand now I'm becoming Sherlock because that's all we need. Two Sherlock's." he chuckled at the thought. One was quite enough. He caught Mary's eye as he walked past the window and she waved him in, grinning. "Hello again John" she smiled as he entered. "Hello Mary" John laughed as she lead him to her consultation desk at the back of the shop. She sat him down and disappeared behind the counter, returning with two boxes. "Here we go then, which one do you want to see first?"
The detective jerked his head towards his friend. “Look. I caught you the perpetrators in the end, did I not? Did I not solve the case your
Later on, when they finally arrived home John immediately made his way to the shower. "John?" Sherlock was confused by that, usually tea came first. He had been watching John intently the whole way home and his expressive face showed something not unlike discomfort for the majority of the journey home. He heard John stifle a laugh. "I have to wash away my sins" and John exploded with laughter. Sherlock waited paitently for him to finish, holding back a smile. "Is that why you looked so uncomfortable? You've been waiting to make that joke all evening?" John could only nod as he wiped tears out of his eyes. "Sorry! Oh God that was just... It was too ironic!" John had sobered significantly when he spoke next. "Going to hell, if there is one, wouldn't be too bad would it?"Sherlock pressed him back against the wall "At least there's criminals, genii and an abundance of sex available in hell. After all we'd be there forever!" He whispered, his voice low, directly into John's ear. That tone alone was almost too much, but putting it with Sherlock talking about sex? John was dragging him to the bedroom in seconds. Sinfully good.
John held his breath as the fawn turned to nuzzle his hand. The slightly wet nose pressed to his palm, and that purr resonated right to his fingertips. It was surely just an innocent gesture, but it pierced right through John, stirring something deep within him. Before he had time to properly address it or even understand just what that feeling was, Fawnlock was jerking away and looking almost timid as Mrs. Hudson reappeared. John blinked and stared for a fraction of a second before smiling and turning back to the grandmotherly Fae, drawing her attention from the fawn so he wouldn't feel so embarrassed. Which, if he was, was a good indication that it hadn't been all that innocent on his end. "Oh, no problem at all Mrs. Hudson. Thank you so much for the hospitality. It's nice to know I have such a lovely neighbor. If there is anything I can help you with, don't be afraid to ask. I am more than happy to help."
With minty fresh breath, John goes to Sherlock's room and sees him on the bed. He smiles at Sherlock, playing with the hem of his shirt, his sonic screwdriver torch in the other hand. He has never had a sleep over before. Especially at someone else's house.
Mycroft packs his things, the meeting over. He runs a hand through his ginger hair and sighs, loosening his tie. As class president, there is a lot of pressure on the fourteen-year-old.
A few hours later they arrive, and Sherlock pretty much jumps out of the limo to the boot to grab his bags.
John listened to the fawn with a solemn, serious face, his heart thudding in his chest. He was fearful more so than he'd ever been in his life, more than any night in Afghanistan, even when he laid bleeding in the sand.
Sighing happily as the fae stroked his belly, John flexed the muscles of his abdomen beneath the dark fingers. The kiss was more than welcome, his mouth opening to accommodate the dip of the fawn's tongue. John had never been kissed like Fawnlock kissed him, like every inch of him was fascinating, every taste and touch was something to worship. John hope it would always be like this between them, unable to keep hands and mouths off each other and spend the rest of their lives entangled around each other. He wanted to give everything he had to his mate, to show him the staggering amount of love that filled John's heart to bursting every waking second.
Sherlock had put on a documentary on bees. It isn't long before John dozes off. Soon Sherlock dozed off as well, head leaning on John's
Once Fawnlock finished his last biscuits and drained his tea cup, John took the dishes away and set them in the sink, then returned to the table to gently gather his love into his arms and carry him back to their nest. The fawn bleated softly as John picked him up, cuddling into his mate. The rumble in the Fae's chest strengthening slightly as he rubbed his damp nose against John's shoulder. John settled the Fae down among the mounds of blankets, John knelt beside him, smoothing and bunching the duvets and pillows where it was needed.
Sherlock had slipped into his Mind Palace, the rug wasn't really of interest, and the older boy's voice snaps him out of it.
He strode in, rushing his way across the room to sit on the edge of the bed just as Sherlock roared his name and sat bolt upright, his entire body trembling. Wide eyes met John's for only a second before Sherlock was pressed against him, hands fisted in his shirt and face buried in his shoulder as he breathed raggedly against John's neck. Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. The breath blowing across his neck was warm but the rest of Sherlock was cold, and John could feel his heart racing even through his shirt. He said nothing, but he wrapped his arms carefully around Sherlock's back, turning and pulling him gently into his lap, encircling the man with himself because if he was right that's what Sherlock was trying to do anyway. Gently John began to rock back and forth, his hand rubbing big circles across Sherlock's back, ignoring entirely the fact that it was sticky with sweat. Sherlock shuddered and burrowed deeper into him, probably stretching his pyjama top with white knuckle grip he had on it. "It's ok Sherlock, you're ok." John soothed, and wondered what had broken this impossible man.
John slicked the now wet curls back, smoothing them back off the fawn's forehead before he handed over the bottle of shampoo and slouched down against the back of the tub so if Fawnlock turned around he'd be able to wash John's hair.
"There's fresh baked biscuits." Moosecroft's eyes widened for a moment, and then he fell into step behind the pair, following them into the home.
The fawn then tugged John towards their nest, the rumbling still vibrating deep in his chest as he curled up in the best and tugged John down to him, wrapping his lanky arms around his mate. The Fae, careful of his antlers, snuggled close to John and snuffled softly at his neck.
Fawnlock huffed in acknowledgement, "Not just my tree John..." He starts to pad off into the wood, following paths and deer trails so familiar to the him. "My den." He murmured, holding back some branches for John. "It's a large hollowed oak... At least part of it is... It's rather small, but I'm rather fond of it." The fawn peered up at the sky, watching leaves fluttering the icy breeze, pulling his scarf tighter, he muttered something about winter ruffs before giving a slight huff, scenting the air, he could sense them, the birds.... Mycroft's sudden extra surveillance couldn't be a coincidence. John blinked and followed after Fawnlock, paying attention to his feet so he didn't stumble over half buried boulders and tree roots. Of course, that almost earned him a face full of branches, were it not for the fae holding them back. He flashed an appreciative smile up at the fawn and hurried past, bringing his gaze back up to pay better attention.
John hummed softly and rolled back onto his back, pulling the fawn on top of him as they pressed together, nuzzling and basking in the blissful afterglow.
Fawnlock snuffled softly as he watched John put the cloak on, the soft fur and hide settle over his mate’s shoulders. The cloak was adorably large on John, the fawn grinned and stepped forward to envelope his mate on an embrace, nuzzling and snuffling at John's jaw.
The fawn's ears flicked as he watched his mate examine what he'd written and then try to copy it. Fawnlock smiled softly at the attempt John made.
Sherlock scowls at Mycroft's words, "Fine, but I'm going to gather specimens and samples the whole time." He leans into his brother as they continue to go in silence.
John's head snaps up, seeing his curly haired friend weeping to an open desk on the other side of the class room, he stares, barely containing himself. He must keep it to himself, not make a scene. Smiling, John looks at his notebook and bits his lip. He could not wait until morning break when he could surprise Sherlock.
The fawn gave a slight nod at his mate's words, his curls bouncing lightly, the rumbling continuing loud as ever.
"A package came a few days ago, air holes poked in the sides, said fragile ... I'm hoping it's blind," he pauses, "Not to be cruel or anything, a blind mouse would be more interesting and most likely easier to train and get through mazes, better because of their sense of smell... And also those mice are always the ones no one wants, most are used to feed the snakes in pet shops."
The fingers in John’s hair stroked through the sandy strands as the fawn felt as if he was dancing on the edge of the abyss of release, "J-John!" He moaned the name low, his accent of his native language thick on his tongue. He was so close to that edge, the fawn panted, ears flicking as he teetered for a moment.
"And that means lots of cuddles, and kisses, anything you want." he mumbled softly, bright eager eyes on his mate, "Because I love you infinitely, John. Just you."
Mycroft mirrors his younger brother and sits on the other side of their mother, kissing her other cheek, "Hello mummy."
Mycroft observes this as John and Sherlock approach the limousine; he considers approaching the issue that it could be unsafe for the boys to continue to be so affectionate in their friendship, but he really doesn't want to ruin it for them.  They are just so happy together.
"We brought you some as a thank you. You'll have to give me some more recipes you think will help feed him up." He bit his lip to smother a giggle, looking back to his lean bodied mate and drawing him in closer.
John felt his mouth twitch into a soft frown every time the fawn made a noise of pain. That pain was because of John, this ruined skin was because of John. He'd never forgive himself if this beautiful creature was permanently scarred because of him. He controlled his ministrations, making sure to pay the utmost care so he wouldn't cause any more pain than necessary. John found himself staring again, watching as the Fawn's teeth worried at his bottom lip. John swallowed and looked back to his work. Fawnlock as a fae, was much older than John. Yet he somehow looked so young and vulnerable, sitting on his living room rug. John used his free hand and dug through his kit to find an antibiotic cream that had a topical analgesic in it, to numb the pain. He gently rubbed it into the teeth marks, cradling the soft arm in his lap. "I hope this doesn't scare you away from me, Fawnlock." He murmured, inspecting every mark in case they required stitches. None of them seemed that bad however, and he smiled weakly before wrapping it up with fresh bandages. "I promise our time together won't always be that dangerous." And how he wanted there to be so much more time shared between them. Even in this fantastical situation, John had felt more like his old self than ever before. Felt more alive, more human. He had no doubt that was because of the fawn.
"Did you know that most homophobic people are statistically the most likely to actually be gay?" Sherlock interrupted once more, a slight smirk on his little Cupid's bow lips.
Fawnlock turned and then tilted his head so their lips brushed slightly as he spoke, "Once I get back into my routine; experiments, patrols, and going away into my mind to think properly, I may seem... Insensitive, arrogant, impatient, cynical. Even after I realized this wood needed me and things needed to change. I can't change who I am like that, though, it's still there. That's who Mousey was scared of, the cold, icy, soul I'd still act like at times, because in a moment, I didn't care about her, I only cared about myself and the experiment she would ruin."
There had been so much love when he was a child, and John was endlessly happy for that, his sadness melting away completely.
So, I'm going to start editing this adorable fic for you all - continuity, grammar and spelling. We wrote this soooo long ago.
John reveled in the press of both nose and lips, wriggling closer to the fawn till not an inch space was between them, and had it not been for the fur and fabric, it would have been difficult to tell where one began and the other ended. John had never felt as close to another living being as he did Fawnlock, not even family. Though the fawn was his family now, wasn't he? John slid his arms down to encircle around Fawnlock's back and rolled them in the nest of leaves till they were covered in the brittle foliage, clinging to both John and Fawnlock's hair. "You and this wood are my heart. As long as I am here, I will protect both, just like you protected me."
Sherlock scowls slightly at his brother's coddling and affections, though a smile breaks through after a minute or two, "Thank you, My." He leans over to grab one of his texts and flips it open, "I do love a good challenge. The last of my tests are tomorrow," he settles the text so he can read it, "So I'll read while you finish your calculus." He slides off his brother's lap and goes to settles into one of the reading chairs in around the study. Soon his nose is buried in the book, and he's gone off to his little mind palace.
Mycroft smiles brilliantly at his baby brother and kisses the top of his head, ruffling his curls affectionately.
Moosecroft didn't see the point in asking any more questions now that he was satisfied, but he wasn't going to be impolite and fore go the tea. He poured a bit of honey into his, nothing else, and stirred it before taking a slow sip.
The young Fae leant forward to take a sniff of the soup's aroma, reveling in the light steam and pleasant smell of their lunch. The fawn took a small sip, and bleated softly, the soup still as delicious as ever. He then took one of the chunks of bread as well, taking a small bite and offering a grin to John. Fawnlock's fluffy tail swished side to side as he scooted over to give his mate more room. As John sat back down with his own food, the Fae snuggled up once more to his side and quietly took small sips of soup, ears flicking back and forth.
Harry feels her lips tighten and she tries to not sneer at Sherlock. She didn't like that kid. Annoying. She turns to John again, trying to reign in her temper and failing.
John laughed as Fawnlock embraced him, turning his head to kiss the side of the fae's face before he pulled away.
The fawn huffed softly in irritation as he nuzzled against his mate, ever mindful of his antlers. He snuffled softly as his fingers curled into the fabric of John's jumper, the Fae sighed softly, tail swishing side to side.
John chuckled with the fawn's comments. Only he could find some great magical wood boring, yet be enthralled with plain, ordinary John. As Fawnlock leaned into nuzzle, the blond tilted his chin up a bit, trying not to flinch as the extra cold nose slid over his skin. He leaned back after a moment and reached up to rub the fae's nose with his other hand, warming it up. Fawnlock chuckled softly, a soft rumbling started in the Fae's chest as John rubbed his nose. He nuzzled into the human's palm. With a soft bleat he moved his head slightly and pressed a kiss to John's palm. John guided the fawn down to sit closer to the fire  to get toasty, never stopping the soothing rub between his shoulder blades. "Well I'm glad it was boring, that means nothing held you up and you come home to me quicker." After a few moments Fawnlock deemed himself warm enough, he finished his tea and stood, pulling John with him. He padded over to his nest and sat, pulling John with him. He slipped his scarf from his neck and hung it on a hook in the wall. Fawnlock pulled John to him and nuzzled his neck, the rumbling growing louder. The pair stayed snuggled close for a few moments before the fawn gave a soft huff and pulled john down to snuggle with his human, "You need to rest John, let's sleep.." he spoke softly as he tucked his face against John's neck. John huffed a soft chuckle but nevertheless settled down with the adorable fawn, keeping him close. Soon the human was dozing off and surprisingly, so was the fawn cuddled close beside him, with sleepy smiles quirking their lips as they slept peacefully.
"So..your home?" John wondered out loud, slightly awestruck. Of course, Fawnlock had been to his home, so was it really that surprising? Still, just the thought that John was allowed to see the fawn's den made the blond excited. Learning anything more about the fae thrilled him to the core.
As the kettle began to whistle, John pushed up out of his chair, pressed a kiss to the crown of curls a top the fawn's head and went to take care of the tea.
The Fae buried his face into John's neck, "Even if I live a life of solitude, away from my kind, save the Fae that venture to and live in my wood, I am still under my brother's rule. He is King, though I have some authority as Prince, I can only ignore his orders and rule to an extent." Fawnlock nosed against John’s neck, letting his love's scent calm him slightly.
So when the strange new creature, a human, they came and went but rarely was it that one took residence in the wood, appeared one day in the small cottage at the heart of his wood, Fawnlock was intrigued yet wary. He kept watch over the human and was surprised when it left and yet still came back with what appeared to be food. He watched it explore, plant and fish, and become slightly-familiar with his wood. It wasn't long before Fawnlock accepted it as one of his charges, and kept a more careful watch over it than the other creatures of the wood, as it seemed to be more clumsy and in need of protection.
The younger Fae gave a soft huff, "We agree on other things!" The young Fae met his brother's gaze, and the elder Fae chuckled softly, "Like what?"
Once the canteen was full, Fawnlock stood and screwed the lid on, figuring it out quickly. He waded back and knelt beside John holding out the canteen.
Sherlock tried very hard to rein in the fear that was welling up in his gut, spreading and flowing through his body like a river. "Is there anyone that would have a vendetta against your company, or you personally?" John was about to say no, Sherlock was praying he'd say no. He didn't know why, he knew there was no God, no higher power. In those moments of uncertainty, and the feeling that the floor was about to collapse beneath him, he prayed that John would say no. But he didn't. In his head he saw the scarred face of the man who'd had to shake his hand, the malice that had lingered in his eyes as he strode out into the blistering heat and never returned. John's eyes, an electric blue rose and met Sherlock's, and all he could read was skewed by the uncertainty and guilt he saw, prevalent even through the plethora emotions that presented themselves in John's eyes. John cleared his throat."There's only one man. Sebastian Moran."
Snow swirled, pure white and glistening through the cobbled streets of London, blustering around carriages and cloaks to fall silently on the ground and just as quickly turn grey and squelchy under feet. November had been bitterly cold and while most were attempting to remain indoors in so far as one can, the criminal world was not so deterred by adverse weather conditions. Rather a pity, that. For Holmes this was a gift of stellar proportions, chases were made twice as exciting in the navigating of ice on the roads and the general lack of visibility while evidence (or dismembered parts) was preserved beautifully by London itself.
Mycroft woke up with the rather disgusting sensation of having a furry rodent lodged between his teeth. Not to mention the odd feeling that he'd fallen asleep somewhere other than where he'd woken up, tucked snugly away in his room in Mummy's. "Gregory?"
"I feel like we're going to regret giving them the reins in the near future" John muttered under his breath to Sherlock as they sat down at the table and listened to Mrs Hudson and Mummy Holmes discuss a hundred things at once. They were already squealing shrilly, John could just barely make out words like "flower arrangement" and "venue specialist". He sighed resignedly and Sherlock patted his arm "As long as they're happy we don't have to deal with them." John smirked and fiddled with the silverware that was probably genuine silver and took a deep breath to just calm himself a bit. Their future seemed to be revealing itself at a devastating pace and while it was all wonderful from this side of the timeline the chances of successfully maneuvering themselves to live that way were slim to say the least. They barely knew what would happen from one week to the next, who knew where they'd be five months down the line, and while they both agreed that a child was most certainly on the agenda, it wasn't like they could just go about it the conventional way and that would mean patience and hard work to find a surrogate or adopt. He had a feeling that once again nothing in their lives would go to plan, but it didn't really matter to him when Sherlock caught his eye. How could anything else matter when he had two moons pulling him in like the tide? As long as he had Sherlock no plan mattered. Sherlock focused all his attention on John and his expression softened into a shy smile.
"Yes actually, if you could send a bouquet of roses to the hospital, and perhaps the baby bag from my brother's flat, I doubt they brought that with them in the van."
) had broken him, forced him to feel again, all because of one man. One man that evidently did not wish to see him.
Sherlock felt Mycroft’s presence just behind him, to his left. “As much as I detest sentimentality, I won't deny that it feels nice to be back home. Merry Christmas, little brother, ” Mycroft voiced softly before heading towards the front door of their home, his expensive shoes crunching in the snow and Sherlock hot on his heels.
The second John's lips parted around him he was done for, certain he would not last for more than another minute at best. Looking down at him, the picture of contentment with Sherlock's prick sliding in and out of his mouth was torture.
"Sherlock Holmes?" A shocked voice called to him from the left and he turned to find a circle had already formed on that side, most of those present being colleagues of his mother or various relations that he'd met many times before. Three cheaters, two gold diggers, a secret foot fetish and an acrobat in training. Wonderful.
that name!" Harry laughed, the noise so alien in the somber mood that John couldn't help but laugh too, deep full body chuckles that left him short of breath. This, he thought, this is how I'll remember my sister.
John rubbed a hand over his eyes when he thought Sherlock wasn't looking, he hadn't had sleep in a good five days, not that he would even dream of complaining, not when Sherlock was so vibrant. It was the case of a life time and the number of people they had saved from criminals and... Slaves they'd freed had personally thanked them both. John had gotten to know some of them, mainly because he was a doctor first before a blogger and it was in those sewers that he had forced Sherlock to stop, just for an hour. Just so he could help these people. Sherlock had taken one look at him and nodded, dashing home and returning in minutes with a medical kit and help on the way. Sherlock had even broken his strict no unecessary physical contact during cases rule to give John a hug and a quick peck.
"I'm sorry a what?!" John yelled, nearly choking on his tea. Sherlock sighed, he did so hate repeating himself. "A sex tape John. If we want to infiltrate this company and prove that they're trafficking these women we have to have a portfolio, therefore a sex tape." John swallowed his remaining tea and rubbed his eyes in exasperation. "I understand that bit. Why, though, do we have to make one together?"
"You are something else entirely you beautiful creature, Christ, look at you!" John breathed as Sherlock rose to stand before him, brushing sodden curls from his face with an air of nonchalance  that only added to his statuesque appearance.  If they didn't know better, people could almost believe he was marble, if not for the very gratifying flush of red on his cheek bones at the compliment. With one hand under his chin, John brought Sherlock's mouth down to his and kissed him, tasting the natural salt Mycroft had mentioned they used to clean the pool, wine and that spicy, electric undertone that was simply Sherlock himself.
The sun rose again the next morning though John's world had stopped spinning and he got up to find Sarah dressed in overalls and a shirt. "I figured we might as well do it all today, we both have the day off so I can get here put together and you can get your stuff" John smiled and made a remark about how it was a great idea and how he couldn't wait. He wasn't even sure if he was still speaking English at this point, but he left anyway and made his way home one last time. 221 was quiet, Mrs Hudson was away with her sister again. John was pleased, he couldn't handle saying goodbye twice, especially not when he'd have to say it to Sherlock either before and then talk to Mrs Hudson in tears, or after and not be able to say anything because he was choked with guilt at leaving her to fend for herself with a madman. It was better this way.
Sure enough, underneath the forest of suits lay a black suitcase. John had just pulled it out and Sherlock was behind him. "Mycroft's doing. He says it's mostly for you as the next shipment of my suits are at the estate anyway, quote 'No refusals or gratitude. It's really a gift for the rest of us.'" The case was contained two suits, what felt like a cashmere jumper and an assortment of hygiene products. Even John had to admit the suits were stunning, one a jet black with an emerald shirt,the other a dark navy with a white shirt. "Care to try them on?" Sherlock asked him, a hint of curiosity in his voice. John sighed and began to pull on the black suit. Sherlock watched him in silence, cataloging data and storing information.
It was the other stuff that was strange, like the distinctive smell of cologne from Mr Hartley who'd had a triple bypass and hadn't even been his patient, or the fact that Mrs Davis during her stay had worn exclusively navy socks, and now apparently, the contrast of dark curls and pale skin had made the collection. He didn't even know the poor bugger's name, John mused as he leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes.
"Thank God, empty!" Greg cheered before shoving Mycroft against the wall of the corridor and claiming him, hopefully for many years to come.
"Alors, le clés. C'est le petit voiture noir la bas, et je dois dire que le clés pour ouvrir la maison serai dans la même arbe que tu as le donné. Je ne sais pas, ça c'est l'instruction de Monsieur Holmes." Sherlock plucked the keys out of his hand with a little smirk and shrugged at John's questioning look.
Greg woke with the distinctive feeling that he wasn't where he was supposed to be. It was probably one of three things that had woken him up: the sun rising in his eyes, the birdsong, or the uncanny feeling of three rocks and a lot of grass under him. He was outside. In the front garden of Mummy Holmes' house. Wearing half a shirt and his socks.
