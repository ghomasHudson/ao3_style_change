"Well ya, now I know that's a stupid idea. I suggest we go back." Sherlock insisted.
"Professor, tell me you hear it too." Sherlock whined, clutching at his head as the screaming gave a shrill increase, as if it knew they were conspiring together. John groaned, yet nodded.
"Well, if it really is five o'clock then it seems as though we have slept through our troubles." Sherlock decided with a groan. John shook his head, jumping to pull his jacket on and running about in a small circle to find his bag. "Why do you rush, professor? We haven't anywhere to be anymore."
"John this is your
"That letter doesn't define either of us. I know that...well I know it's ancient history. It wasn't you, wasn't me.
"Well when we're asleep it can feed us dreams, and never so vividly as when we're inside its walls." Sherlock pointed out.
"You were in love once?" I clarified again, setting the papers down upon his chair and approaching the fireplace to stand at his side. It was very uncomfortable to have a conversation with the back of his bent head, especially when I felt I would be missing the most influential and life changing emotions of our time together. Surely this was monumental?
"They're not my words." John insisted.
"You know she can't help it." Mary offered in the baby's defense.
"It um...well I do admit that I don't remember you ever using such romantic language. Yet I cannot deny that it appears to be your handwriting, if not in some sort of quill or calligraphy pen." Sherlock muttered in a very small voice.
all the same. It might be the death of them both, and so what? He had been with John Watson, something not many people could boast. At least he would die with some sort of satisfaction. Sherlock got out of the car rather slowly; very apprehensive to press the doorbell for he didn't know how he would be greeted. John was home, he saw the familiar car in the driveway, sparkling innocently in the sunlight, not knowing what had been created in its depths. Sherlock nervously approached the front door, fixing his hair on instinct before ringing the bell and waiting for a response. He didn't hear much for a moment, and yet the sound of approaching footsteps announced the coming of a greeter before the door even had the chance to open. It was a woman that Sherlock didn't recognize, one who had the characteristics of a Watson that were only too easily recognized. The blonde hair, the soft eyes, she stood proudly and tall, looking down upon the stranger at her doorstep with some suspicion. Sherlock smiled up at her, noticing that she never opened the screen door to properly let him enter, keeping a layer of glass between the two of them as if she was suspicious as to why he was here. Surely Sherlock didn't look too intimidating, a scrawny kid, what harm could he possibly do?
"I'm sorry, but it's better to be safe, John I got diagnosed today, I've had it ever since I've been with Victor, that was three months ago, John there's all the chance in the world that you have it as well." Sherlock whispered, to which John just shook his head and muttered his denials once more.
"Ya, I'm sorry Greg, but I really can't put it in words. I don't think you'd understand." John admitted with a shrug, getting to his feet and walking around towards the door. The bell was going to ring any moment, already he could hear the footsteps of the approaching stampede ascending the stairwells. Already he could hear the long stride of Sherlock Holmes, somewhere now, inside of the building. As John was perched at the doorway Greg took that moment to let his curiosity get the better of him, and when John had his back turned he made a lunge for the picture that John had tried so hard to hide. John was too late in stopping him, for the only real cue he had that Greg had acted out was the great exclamation he gave; only after seeing the picture which was tucked safely behind the dusty glass.
"I rephrase. Leave, Greg." John corrected, forcing his lips into a smile all the while Sherlock looked between the two as if he was wondering what on earth was going on. As if he couldn't really tell what these two men knew and he didn't. Greg sighed heavily, but obviously he was in no position to argue. And so he raised his hands in surrender, shrugging his shoulders passively and getting to his feet. He paused on the way out to crane his neck up at Sherlock, studying his face as if he really couldn't understand how he could look exactly the same as the photograph.
"You own an old house then?" Sherlock presumed, his voice now taking a turn from excited to curious. He sounded interested in John's life, for some reason, as if John's manic episode was thought provoking for him.
"That house is nothing to fear, Sherlock." John insisted, yet all the same he felt that same sort of press upon his chest, the one which took over when he was lying. That house was something to fear, that house was a force in itself, a vengeful being. Yet Sherlock just hummed, making no move to agree or disagree. He merely nodded, and went to looking out the window in that same sort of mood, that distant mood, in which John could tell he was lost in thought.
"Alright then, keep your secrets." Greg decided with a sigh. John just laughed, spinning minutely in his chair and shaking his head.
Sherlock corrected. "Even as a graduate student, I'm not entirely used to going an entire weekend without sleep."
"I suppose you're right, on both fronts." John agreed. "I've just been so distracted, by that house I...I don't know why it's got me so obsessed."
eloping." Sherlock corrected.
"I didn't say it made sense, Professor." Sherlock muttered, staring at the picture once more as his gaze softened. "I'm just saying that it's me."
"How big did you say it was?" John wondered hopefully, looking for something to expect. Mrs. Hudson just gave a mysterious little chuckle, turning down an old road which was hardly paved, not seeming to mind the tires as she drove right through all of the potholes and cracks that had dug themselves into the dirt over years of neglect. The car jolted dangerously, causing John to reach up and grab the roof for some added support.
"Oh yes, well I was a boy scout back in America." John admitted.
"But why
"Greg didn't mention anything about research." Mary scolded.
"I feel as if it was from this Mr. Trevor. It was who you were afraid of, so I can only imagine I was in something of a dedicated relationship with him." Sherlock guessed.
"I don't think it's happy with us." John agreed with a sigh, unlocking his office door and stepping inside.
"No, not cookies. That's the girl's job." John scoffed.
"That's why I find it difficult...I find it difficult to speculate that my life means nothing. Because this life that I've made for myself, anyone would want it! Anyone would want such a transformation, to go from nothing to something spectacular. It's hard to tell myself there's something missing, but I suppose I always knew there was." John admitted quietly.
"I'm not flirting." John corrected hastily, shaking his head in regret. "I'm saying that like it or not, we've got a past. And like it or not, you've got a past with Victor Trevor. We've all gotten tangled up in this big web, and it's hard for me to imagine there's much space for anyone else."
"What's so suspicious about research? My goodness Mary, I don't know if you have properly grasped the idea of students and professors working together. This isn't elementary school; we're allowed to interact with our students without needing to get a background check." John growled.
"Victor? Oh I don't know, who knows if he got reincarnated as well?" John said with a little shrug. Sherlock simply chuckled, though John couldn't see what was so funny about that. In fact, if this boy had such an obsession with this Victor character, he couldn't see why his loss would be considered a joke.
"I suppose." Sherlock agreed, as he could not force himself to muster up any emotion. He was just as afraid of crying as John was, perhaps more so. He hadn't much of a connection to Mary, other than being stuck on the same ship with her for the entire span of his life. The woman was a mere object in his world, as complex of a character as any person could be when they weren't exposed to anything more than a metal container and a view full of stars. She wasn't interesting, she wasn't lovable, she was nothing more than...than just
"Yes well, you seemed insistent." Sherlock grumbled.
"Are we going to love this baby?" John wondered at last, looking up towards Sherlock a bit hopefully.
"No, no the opposite. It's in mint condition, Greg. Abandoned for a century, and looking like they had just walked out the door yesterday. It's ancient, and it's beautiful..." John gave a great groan of annoyance, letting his head thunk down onto his desk right next to his uneaten sandwich.
"And so that's why you're all entangled with this guy, isn't it? You're on the hunt, solving your little mystery?" Greg presumed with a little grin. John sighed heavily, leaning forward on his desk and shaking his head sadly. He wasn't entirely sure what he was doing with Sherlock, at least not anymore. What a straight forward answer he would've had prepared for Greg in any other circumstances. Yet now if he was to say yes he might be overstepping his boundaries, and if he said no he may just sound painfully pessimistic. He didn't know what he was doing with Sherlock anymore, if anything at all! and so in the end it was just easier to shrug his shoulders.
"It shall be more interesting once we finally get out of the woods and into the lab. Biology is your husband's profession, yet I very much prefer substances to creatures. Counting little salamanders...well it's a cross I have to bear all the same." Sherlock admitted with a grin.
"Oh my
"Why must you label this so directly? He wasn't on a table with
"Well I suppose you're right." Sherlock agreed apprehensively. "All the same, I can't help but worry that there's some truth in it all. I feel like we can take nothing too lightly, especially when it pertains to that house."
It was probably one of the fanciest evenings John had ever spent, even if the food presented on such fancy plates was the world's greasiest takeout pizza. The chandelier was lit (or rather the light bulbs were turned on, they couldn't reach all the way up to get the candles) and the china was passed around. Their bubbly soda was served in crystalline glasses, as tall as John's eye level, and there was a candelabra burning right next to the pizza box and breadsticks. It really was a luxurious evening, made even more pleasant by John's equally luxurious company. The only downside of Sherlock's presence was of course his preferred topic of conversation, for as wonderful as this moment was, he didn't seem to want to stay in it long. Sherlock preferred leaning over the table on his elbows, staring at the flickering candles and getting lost in the thought.
"Yes, me as well." John agreed in some urgency, for he was trying to lock the door with that great big key all the while he was holding his cell phone to his ear, listening to the damning chorus of beeping. Either Mary wasn't picking up because she was angry with him, or rather she was so preoccupied with Rosie and with dinner that she couldn't hear or manage to pick up the phone.
"John you need to get yourself tested, I know you don't want to think about it, but we didn't use..."
"Have you looked through the boxes enough?" Sherlock asked. John sighed heavily, giving the last one something of a kick before nodding his head.
"Maybe I don't entirely like the facts." John admitted finally.
"Sherlock I do hope my husband hasn't been upsetting you!" Mary exclaimed in some shock.
"Yes...yes I do wonder." Was his only response, and with that he sunk into his faithful chair and went straight for his pipe. I sighed heavily, for with such an attitude I knew it best not to bother my friend, yet still I was much too excited to allow myself any attempt at sleep. Surely I could sit up another hour or two, until finally I grew weary enough to retire. The fire was lit and burning brightly, and the never ending sounds of London life were only too obvious throughout our small rooms. It did not matter the hour, there always seemed to be at least one carriage passing by within all minutes, and always someone who felt the need to shout over what little crowd might be gathered in the streets below. Quietly I sat and appreciated the warmth, unable to concentrate on anything but the growing heaviness of my eyes, and the constant begging question of what we had witnessed there in Milverton's office. Such a curious night it had been! Suddenly my friend and I had turned to a single episode of crime, and been witness to such an occurrence that could march us on to the same fate that some of the villains in London suffered under the wrath and dedication of Holmes. Yet Milverton had gotten what he had deserved, and if his death should allow us to rest assured that his life of blackmail was over...well then it was a death that was quite well deserved. I could not well think of another solution which would spare those unfortunate lives and secrets which were stored away in that safe, most of my alternatives would undoubtedly have landed us in prison! And so I am indebted to a murderer, which is very shallow yet of course true all the same. It was close to one o'clock in the morning when I finally decided I might go off to bed, however it was with some surprise that I looked up to find Holmes sitting with the most peculiar expression I had ever caught him with. It was something that might be mistaken as emotion, which of course I did not believe when taken into consideration the usual mannerism of my friend and companion. His usual cold eyes were instead replaced with life, and they slowly scanned the documents clenched in his hands, those that could only be the very same he saved from a fiery fate in that horrible place. So human did he look now that it was almost cause for concern, for never in my time spent with Holmes had I seen him look close to shedding a tear. Tonight he looked remorseful, as if he was mourning the loss of something that meant to him a great deal.
"Or on the both of us." John offered immediately, turning in enthusiasm for a moment, his heart skipping a beat as he realized what this meant. Yes! Yes, it was the both of them, was it not? The house had been waiting for Sherlock to get involved; it had been waiting for the right moment to present John with his face, and with his image. The house wanted John to see that he was not alone, and however crazy he felt, well he was not alone in that insanity! The house had brought them together for a reason, because...well maybe because they had been together before. Maybe this house was not John's alone to bear; maybe this house was not purely his burden.
"You don't understand." John started in a small voice.
"Well I appreciate your enthusiasm. But it's only a distinguished profession in school, I'm afraid. Come my professional years I'm sure I'll be stuck in some run down old lab testing cleaning products." Sherlock admitted with a little huff.
"Ya, sorry about that. I got in and my head was killing me, I had to do something about it." John grumbled.
"Oh don't ask now, she might say no!" Mary whined, tugging on her husband's arm as if to pull him closer to the house.
"Why ever would we..." Mary was cut off when Sherlock picked up his glass, gave a quick toast to the hostess, and proceeded without any hesitation to splash whatever was left in the glass directly into John's face. Mary gasped; all the while John could do nothing but spit and seethe in his anger.
"Would you like me to come with you?" Sherlock wondered carefully, letting his hands fall away from John's only to brush his fingers gently against the boy's cheek, for he was crying once more. Sherlock took the liberty of wiping away the tears he himself had created.
"Deed to a house?" Greg presumed.
"Well for how long? You know I don't like to be here alone!" whined another unfamiliar voice. Sherlock slammed the screen door shut, only to have it opened once more by a tall, bland looking boy who John had never seen before. He seemed to be about Sherlock's age, with greying hair and a long intellectual looking face. He was wearing nothing but pajama pants, with his hair disrupted and a pair of glasses perched on his nose.
"First of all, there's no
"Never." John assured quietly. "But perhaps just a little bit self-interested."
"Oh no, you're the adventurous one." Sherlock insisted, stepping aside as if he was doing John a favor by being a coward.
to go into my house, hm? How could you have mistakenly crept around in my halls and position yourself just so that..." John's voice faded just as he was beginning to hear his own argument. "Just so that I would see you long enough for me to yell." The boy's face was contorting into something even more of confusion, as if he really didn't know what he was supposed to do now. Certainly he could see that he hadn't really done anything wrong, he was merely caught in the hands of a professor who was raving mad. Perhaps he thought he was the end of a joke, yet then again that had been John's assumption of himself up until now. Finally he was beginning to see that it was impossible for this boy to be the same one in his house, for he was so genuinely confused that he simply could not be lying.
"It's beautiful." Sherlock murmured, looking back at John just so that he could make sure this wasn't all some sort of big joke. Just to make sure this actually was the house, and they weren't just making a detour on their way to a shack down on the edge of the city.
"Well thank you Sherlock. I'm proud to say that I had some input." John said with a little smirk. Sherlock nodded, forcing a little laugh because he wasn't sure what else to say. John cleared his throat a bit shamefully, for he realized now that was something of an obscene joke to make with such a man. John couldn't help but think this whole night was just a very rude way to shove his family into Sherlock's face, Sherlock who might have loved him at one point in their past lives. It was almost rude, really, to force him to come to grips with the fact that he was too late to properly recreate the past. And the way he was acting, around John's wife and child, well it made him wonder constantly what might have been the context of Sherlock's dream this afternoon. He had to wonder if it had anything to do with this failed opportunity. The dinner went just as John might have expected, that is perfectly acceptable yet awkward all the same. He wasn't sure if that feeling of uncomfortableness was present in the whole of the table, yet for him specifically he found it rather difficult to concentrate. He knew that with every word out of Mary's mouth John was afraid she might say something that would embarrass him, whether it be something about his history in America and his fall out with his parents, or instead something more recent, like mishaps with Rosie or the neighbors. And when Sherlock responded back he was afraid that he might mention the house, that a slip of the tongue would lead them down that road, the road with would undoubtedly begin with Mary questioning how Sherlock even knew about the house in the first place. There was a double blind here, presumably. Mary didn't know about Sherlock's involvement with the house, for of course she didn't know there was anything peculiar about the structure at all, and in turn Sherlock didn't know that Mary didn't know. Perhaps he was under the false impression that husbands and wives tell each other everything, but considering that was not the case in this household John could only hope that Sherlock didn't betray him and this great big conspiracy. Mary's knowledge of the house wouldn't corrupt anything of course, but it might just make things more difficult. It might blend these two worlds more than John would have liked, and force his wife to linger a bit too much into his past. He had a feeling the house wouldn't appreciate meddlers, especially if that meddler was the very person who was keeping Sherlock and John apart. If they had a past romance, or even a past life at all, well certainly the house wouldn't like Mary's interference in what might be considered destiny. When finally the dishes were cleared and Sherlock made his compliments to Mary's cooking, John found himself alone in the sitting room with his acquaintance. Well, they weren't entirely alone, for Rosie was crawling about the carpet after having finished her minuscule little bites of chicken. Yet considering she was not a proper witness, John considered himself safe to talk freely. Mary was washing the dishes in the other room (Sherlock offered his assistance, yet Mary insisted that the boys go and talk their professional business), and so it was just the two of them sitting here with their half drained wine glasses. Sherlock was on what was presumably his third glass, for he really didn't want to say no, and Mary didn't like seeing an empty glass at her table. While his cheeks were getting a little bit flustered he didn't appear to be feeling the consequences of such overconsumption, in fact he seemed perfectly calm. They sat here in the calm quiet of the crackling fire, one which was actually a fake fireplace which spewed out heat and the occasional crackling sound effect. Yet it did the trick, enough so that it could set the mood of relaxation.
"Not at all." she muttered, obviously trying to keep their quarreling to a minimum in front of guests.
"Yes, well then I suppose that's a plus." Sherlock nodded a bit quietly. He was thoughtful for a moment, staring out the window to watch as the house faded out of their vision while John started up the driveway.
"A BOY!" she yelled. It was an accurate description, of course, and yet it was terribly broad. Thankfully she didn't ask for his name, for as much as Sherlock would like to be announced he would rather his name didn't shake across the walls that may just hold his partner to Hell.
"Ah, there we go! Well no wonder I didn't notice it before, it's only just a little string." John said with a little frown, finally noticing an interruption in the ceiling. There was nothing more than a line carved through, making a big enough trapdoor to fit a person or a small piece of furniture. It wasn't the most impressive thing, yet all the same its secretive nature made it all the more exciting. Attics had plenty of uses, some for criminal activity and some for mere hoarding. John may very well be excited for both. Yet he hadn't exactly thought this through, for while the string was short the ceiling was tall, and he realized immediately that even if he jumped he wouldn't be able to reach. Oh how humiliating it was, to have to ask for help.
"What did you sell then, pellet guns?" Sherlock presumed with a chuckle.
"Victor Trevor." Sherlock breathed, now taking to twisting that ring along his finger once more, as if the name was ever too familiar for him.
"I was in that house again, the one I inherited." John began, pausing for a moment and wondering why he was even telling this to Sherlock. Maybe it was just in an attempt to push some of these peculiarities onto someone else as well, so that he didn't have the bear the burden of the unknown alone.
"Oh I think it was just about ten." John debated, shaking out his legs a bit obnoxiously so as to make it look like he was stretching them. In reality, he almost certainly looked like a fool.
"What have you been up to these past couple days? I hardly see you anymore." Greg muttered in something of a protest, crossing his arms and leaning back casually in his chair. John sighed, shaking his head as if he couldn't even begin to explain the mess he had been wallowing through for the past week.
"You need to tell your parents, John. You need to tell them to get you tested. Maybe they won't make the connection, maybe they won't even ask." Sherlock recommended.
"Well, it's kind of what I need to talk to you about." Sherlock admitted in a small voice. John sighed heavily, shaking his head and marching past Sherlock in something of a fit. He was in denial, most obviously, in a state where his brain told him one thing and his heart told him another. John was telling himself he hated the night they had shared, and yet Sherlock knew quite well that he wouldn't protest if he took him down onto the bed right now. No, he would be quite fine with it, undoubtedly.
"Wonderful, an engagement ring." John muttered. "Left there, that's rather telling."
"I think I'll just stand." He decided finally, to which Mrs. Hudson gave a little chuckle of approval before getting to her feet and disappearing.
"Coins." John said instinctively, throwing the bag onto the desk and listening to the clatter the metal made against the wood. Sherlock nodded, looking a bit nervous as he reached for the bag and investigated the contents.
"You need to get tested John, they have medications that can slow it down, but if you let it go..."
"Yes, I know." Sherlock agreed. "You're a good husband."
"Sherlock what on
"For whom, the old owners?" Mrs. Hudson wondered, spinning slightly in her swivel chair behind all of the snow globes that had been laden on the desk before her.
"Perhaps the women in your life just know what's best for you, then." Mary suggested with her all-knowing little grin.
"Why is it a downside?" John wondered.
"I'm not stalking anyone. I was just inferring, as to who he was. I mean ever since you showed me that picture from your creepy new house I've been wondering how he could possibly be so perfectly duplicated. It's like his ancient ancestor..."
"I am." John agreed. "That letter...well you can burn it if you like. I do not want to give anymore thought to my past."
"Sorry if I'm intruding on things." Sherlock muttered. "But I'm sure you know that it's hard for a polite man to say no."
"Perhaps we knew all along." Sherlock suggested finally.
"Not really." John admitted finally.
"Don't you dare use those kinds of words with me!" Sherlock exclaimed. John laughed again, laughing with his own madness. He knew that he had to stop; he knew that he had to stop talking now. Yet just as anxious as he was to burst into tears and apologize, there was another part of him that was rising up in anger, trying to ensure that he wasn't the only one in this room who felt disgraced. So he got to his feet as well, knowing full well that he didn't have it within his power to stare Sherlock into the eyes, yet knowing just the same that it was worth a shot to try.
"You don't think you just happened to um...to stay over then?" John mumbled apprehensively. "Perhaps this picture...well perhaps this was a woman's room." he suggested, although the words caught painfully in his throat. Thankfully Sherlock chuckled, glancing over at John with something of a sideways, knowing smile.
"I um..." John faltered for a moment, rubbing his face in some exasperation as he realized now just how stupid he had just made himself look. The irrationality of his actions began to set down on him with a crushing weight, and he was suddenly very embarrassed about the force he had used, the fear. A simple conversation might have sufficed, to clear this matter up once and for all. "I believe you. I'm sorry I think...I think I must have mistaken you for someone else."
could they possibly be one in the same?
"You're going to leave me like this? You're going to leave us both suffering all day; I've got an exam after lunch! How am I supposed to
"At twelve o'clock, yes. It's not even ten yet." Sherlock pointed out defensively.
"Oh um..."
"And one for me, dear. If you wouldn't mind." John added quickly, for while his day hadn't been in the least bit stressful, he still felt rather drained.
"Says you, with no family to look after. I'm usually back by four, they'll be worried sick!" John exclaimed.
"You've been having nightmares, haven't you honey?" Mary asked quietly, leaning up against the counter with that everlasting look of concern on her face. The microwave hummed as it spun around that little bottle of milk, for Rosie when she finally woke up.
"My only concern is that this house isn't supposed to be mine. Just look at the name! That ink seems to be older than I am! It certainly couldn't be left to me." John insisted with a small shake of his head.
"You're not the only one with dreams, Sherlock. Not the only one." John pointed out. Sherlock opened his mouth to respond, taking a defensive step forward, his face now so flushed in anger that he looked as though he might burst. Yet just as he opened his mouth, just as he poised that accusing finger...
"I really couldn't make you do that. Mary will be worried." Sherlock pointed out.
"Sherlock, make yourself comfortable, please." John said with a little grin, trying now to act like a proper host. Sherlock nodded, yet his coat was already missing and his bag was sitting by the door. Obviously John was a little late for the preliminary mannerisms.
"But they're our memories, aren't they John? We lived here, this is
"Oh nothing, it's just that usually when there's conferences abroad, people take their spouses. Make a vacation out of it. And Paris, the city of love...I thought you might have considered that." Mary murmured.
"John." Sherlock muttered, having peered inside of the wardrobe and been caught in something of a dead standstill. John hesitated, yet all the same he considered such a word to be a summoning, and he allowed himself to walk carefully inside of the room towards where Sherlock was standing. He had his hand on the door, holding it open so as to stare inside, at the wardrobe's contents. And yet the wardrobe was empty, save for one single garment hanging by a hangar inside. One single piece of fabric, left there with a purpose, left there with the intent of Sherlock finding it.
"Oh no, no don't be so rude! The poor thing is probably starving! Have him over for dinner, as an apology for making him run around in all of this horrible rain." Mary insisted. John sighed heavily, tapping his fingers against the steering wheel and hesitating to turn the car on just yet. The rain was coming down hard, thankfully providing just enough background noise so that Sherlock couldn't hear Mary's voice on the other end of the line.
"Don't even try it, Sherlock. Don't." John insisted. Sherlock ran at him again, to which John ducked away, and this continued for quite some time until finally Sherlock used his only formidable weapon. Sure he had long limbs, yet John was quicker, stronger, and running purely on fear. However, whether Sherlock had planned it or not, he played now to his only advantage, and John's only weakness. He used his beauty so as to disadvantage John for just a quick moment, and he did so only when he tripped over the foot of some sort of desk chair. Maybe that chair had been planted there by some sort of higher power, for it was ever so convenient that Sherlock might fall in the very direction that John had been standing, and John then standing directly in front of the old bed. And so together they fell, Sherlock giving a terrified little cry as he wrapped his long arms around John, as if to make sure he would break any fall they both took. Yet it ended so that they didn't hit the floor, they hit the mattress, and for a just a quick moment John felt paralyzed from head to toe, for he had not been tangled with anyone in such a state of breathlessness before, he had not held another body close for as long as he could remember...for as long as he had this wedding ring. There was a moment when they were both impaired, obsessed now only with the weight and proximity of the other, and the heart beats that were flaring up so agressivley in their chests. John wondered for a split second if that was it, if they had been both fighting something for so long, and this fall may just be the tipping point. He wondered for a moment, as he stared with eyes wide into Sherlock's beautiful, swirling irises, if this was not the moment that they both abandoned any shred of decency they might have had and given way to their century old desires. God, if there was a chance that they might be destined for each other, well then what better chance to prove it than now? Yet just as John had thought of the idea, and as all of his limbs went numb in anticipation, Sherlock finally found the power within himself to sit up, snatch the envelope from John's pocket, and jump to his feet in victory.
"That's what they all say, Professor. People in horror movies. They always just jump to psychological issues, but in the end it really is a ghost." Sherlock said eagerly.
"It's NOT!" Holmes exclaimed in a sudden fit of anger, slamming his palm so violently upon the stone mantle that I was afraid it might shatter. In my surprise I jumped, and yet as soon as he noticed my fear he softened, shaking his head regretfully and taking quick, short strides away from the fire and away from me. As if I was in some way alighting his anger even more, or possibly making him uncomfortable by my proximity.
"This is it." John said rather obviously, pulling the car to a stop right outside the front porch. Just as soon as the car stopped moving Sherlock unstrapped himself from his seatbelt, stumbling outside in an almost maddened sort of way, as if he was staring upon one of the most beautiful things he had ever seen in his life. He stood gawking all the while John joined him in the gravel, smiling a bit proudly. He was happy to see that Sherlock was impressed, yet all the while he was even more pleased to see that there was something a lot deeper than just amazement. There was that same look of purpose alight in Sherlock's eyes, that same look that John wore the day he first looked upon this structure.
"Nothing here links this to me." he said again, in some sort of denial. John nodded, going through desk some more and unearthing some sort of old envelope, something with an undeniable scribble on the front. He hummed in excitement, looking up towards Sherlock and flashing the envelope proudly.
"You're what?" he whispered, although he knew full well what that meant. He knew what that meant not only for Sherlock but for him as well. He knew what kind of fate came along with such a declaration.
"That you were a
"So are you going to move in there, then? If it's all fancy and stuff?" Greg presumed quietly.
"Well of course. I know it's a busy time of the year, and we haven't been sleeping much because of Rosie, and with all that running around you do for your job...well you've just been run down. And that exhaustion is catching up to you, that's all." Mary said with a sweet little look of concern. John nodded his head apprehensively, not sure whether he should be thankful or upset that Mary hadn't been able to diagnose his true issue.  That issue which was standing right on the edge of his peripheral vision, in the form of a shadowy figure, a figure which bore every physical resemblance to Sherlock Holmes that it could manage. John looked away, yet it followed anyway. As if it wasn't just a vision, as if it was seared onto his eyeball, as a reminder for him to pay attention to it.
"Do you really think I should?" Sherlock asked apprehensively. "I mean, maybe you could just check the boxes, see if there's anything..."
"Oh God." John whispered, his legs going just about as weak as Sherlock's as he read the contents all the way through. Yet he didn't sit on the desk, not where this letter might be in full view of Sherlock. No, it was good that he had found this before Sherlock did. It was good that he found it before he incriminated them both.
he was with the past you. And no,
"Ya but I'm not out! I never will be out, I am straight Sherlock, I am straight and if I tell people what happened they won't believe me! It was one time Sherlock, one time, how could I get punished for just one
"Not that I see." John shrugged, staring towards the boxes and noticing that Sherlock mimicked every one of his footsteps, so as not to lose any of that protective distance. For whatever reason that was terribly flattering, and John rather liked it. He wondered now why he didn't bring Sherlock to scary places before, just to ensure his sudden dependency. John prodded at some of the boxes, to be sure that there wasn't anything alive inside, before finally trying one of the lids. They were made of cardboard, miraculously untouched by any mold or water damage. The box's lid flung open to reveal plates of the finest china, all unscathed and wrapped in paper for protection.
"Sherlock." John said in the smallest of voices, having materialized next to his mother, looking just as apprehensive to open the door and let him in. For a moment Sherlock didn't know what to say, for a moment he felt as though he should just turn his back and run, and yet he knew that now wasn't the time. This was indeed a matter of life or death; there was no turning around now.
"I've seen this house before." Sherlock admitted quietly, below his breath all the while he kept walking. He kept moving forward, farther into this house where he was supposed to be. He kept stepping deeper and deeper into its walls, abandoning his life on the outside world. All the while he had never been in this house before; he was still retracting his ancient footsteps.
"Well that's very nice of you." John scoffed, checking his watch and giving a defeated little groan.
"And where is it that you're going then?" Reggie wondered, shutting the door behind him and leaning a bit heavily on the door frame.
"But that...that doesn't make sense. Sherlock that's, that just
"It only gets worse." John promised, zipping up his jacket and grabbing the picture from his desk. He shoved it into his bag and shouldered it, grabbing finally his empty coffee mug before starting towards the door with Sherlock at his heels. Together they walked down into the parking lot, an awkwardly public place to be seen with a student getting into his car. All the same, Sherlock was a graduate student, and so there were different social norms involved. For all these spectators could know, they were simply off to do some research together. Well they were researching, just not researching anything within the range of biology, or any sort of natural science. Instead they were looking into themselves, they were studying the walls of the house, they were studying the very essence which made them whole...the things which connected them. And so no, it was not anything akin to kidnapping, or close to a social visit. They were here to investigate, they were here to discover. Sherlock sat rather awkwardly in John's car, for it was a small little thing not made for giants like him. The passenger seat was always Mary's throne, and so it was adjusted as such. Sherlock was much too polite to move it back, and so as he sat he was hunched over, with his knees coming up almost to his chest.
"And yet it did, John it did!" Sherlock insisted, starting to get a little bit annoyed at John's game of denial. Why couldn't he realize the severity of Sherlock's diagnosis?
"I'm not trying to abandon you! God, I'm not trying to do anything. They want me for a bloody conference, some sort of science conference in Paris, where I have to meet with all sorts of people I don't want to meet with, and talk about things that I already know." John lied quickly. Well of course the story was fabricated but the anger was not. Oh if only he was going to a conference, how much easier would his life be! But no, he was going to collect the very man that would weigh down his entire life, and fill his eager heart with lead. Mary hesitated, yet all the while she followed John up to their bedroom, for obviously she had more questions to ask.
"No, certainly not that. Doesn't explain the house, the screaming, the dreams." John pointed out.
"Was it ever as monumental for us as it should've been? Was it ever as life changing as it would have been for an average person?" Sherlock questioned quietly.
"You can let that all go, John. Let it all go. You're happy now, are you not?" Sherlock asked in that calm voice, a soft voice that might have deceived John into believing it meant something more.
"I don't believe in any of that." John said quietly, feeling the need to look down at his wrists, feeling the need to clarify just to be sure. No, there was no such thing as reincarnation, or any sort of Black Magic. There was just...there was just coincidences. The mere coincidence that this was all falling into place, that they were bearing such recognizable traits as their ancestors, their faces, names, and freckles. It was mere coincidences that John had peculiar birth marks, stretched all the way down his forearms in a steady, solid line.
"Well I know that we can't go on living like that, we're not heathens. But I wonder what the house has in store for us. If Victor's out there somewhere then we can be certain that there's a purpose to it all. There's an unanswered question, or an unfulfilled destiny. But if he's not, well I can't think of a reason we're back together again. Unless, well unless we're some sort of soulmates." John muttered with a nervous little croak, his throat forcing out words as his brain produced them, spitting out romantic garbage just for the sake of continuing his sentences. Sherlock's eyes widened before he finally let his gaze drop back to his plate, now littered with the unwanted crusts of pizza long gone.
"Oh well, thank you. I think?" John muttered, feeling his face get a little bit hot in embarrassment. Well, there was a certain irony there, wasn't there? All the same, such an assumption must only be spawned from the wedding ring on his fingers, nothing more. Then again, it might be good that Sherlock knew nothing. For nothing was going to come out of it, no matter how passionate John might think he is. The rest of the ride was silent, probably for the best. John didn't want to say anything stupid, nor did he want to suffer anymore casualties from Sherlock's speaking of things he didn't know. Thankfully it wasn't an awkward silence; Sherlock seemed to be quite lost in his thoughts as he stared out the window, watching as the familiar woods began to thicken around them. When finally they pulled into the gravel driveway that house stood looming before them, yet there was a feeling of welcome all the same. John realized that it had been a while since he was last here, yet all the same there hadn't been any consequences for such time away. Maybe the house understood that there had been a misunderstanding, that or it knew John was intending to come back. John couldn't help but wonder if that argument had been the house's creation entirely. Surely if Sherlock really was promised to another man, then it saw some competition in his getting so close to John? Maybe it had decided that their relationship was building up too quickly, perhaps unfairly to his true soulmate. Oh how infuriating that was, to suspect that the very house was working against John as well!
"It's quite a shock." John warned again.
"When I called it always said the number was out of service." Mary admitted quietly, her voice sounding broken, as if she had been crying for some time.
"I've got to hang around my office until three o'clock. Can you meet me here?" John suggested.
"It's the house." John said simply. "It's this place, it's the memories that are trapped here."
"That or they just like me." John offered.
"It cannot be." John murmured. "No, we're alive now, Sherlock. Not a century ago."
The deed to the house came by post to John's work address, though he had never gotten any personal mail through that mailbox before. It arrived in a mysterious parcel, appearing in his mailbox even though he hadn't been expecting anything. John took the envelope back to his office during his lunch break, when all of the kids were off in their respective cafes or restaurants, taking time away from their studies to enjoy a sandwich with their friends. Well, he didn't have anything too fantastic for lunch and so was not missing anything as he took a pair of scissors and cut through the top of the thick paper envelope. It was addressed to him in a very sloppy hand, written in pen as if in a hurry, and there was a stamp printed along the top corner bearing the Town Hall's return address. At first, John thought it might be calling him for jury duty, or perhaps it was a parking ticket he had neglected throughout the years. However, when he opened the package out fell an envelope, and inside was the most peculiar document he had ever seen. It was handwritten on an ancient piece of yellowing paper, so frail it looked almost as if it would fall apart the moment he set his fingers on it. Yet with further examination, he saw it had a strange address printed upon it, of a house most likely, and his name scrawled in very neat calligraphy at the bottom. John studied it for a moment, deciding that if he was reading this correctly, then this was a deed, an inheritance of sorts. This address must now belong to him, through some accidental chain of family heritage. John examined the deed once more; just to be sure that he wasn't misreading anything and tried to determine the age of the document. It looked ancient, truly ancient. Yet there was his name, in the same old ink as the rest of the writing, possibly a grandfather of his then, someone with the same name? John didn't remember any family history behind his name, and so of course this deed couldn't mean him. And so it must have been someone way back in the history of his lineage, someone who had owned a house...John didn't let himself get too excited, of course. Just because there was an address didn't mean it was anything glamorous. Knowing his ancestors it was probably a rundown old tool shed, which they had given a mailbox and an address just for a laugh. John really wasn't proud of his heritage, as he had left his family behind in America to start a new and more distinguished life for himself in England. If his ancient ancestors proved to be anything like his immediate family, well he knew not to expect much from this strange inheritance. Besides, any structure with a deed this old ought to be the same age, if not older. And if this deed was just falling into his hands now, who knows how long the building had been sitting in the elements, unowned, and rotting back into its framework? Nevertheless, John decided he ought to show it off to the only person he knew would tolerate his rantings.His coworker and fellow professor Greg Lestrade had an office just down the hall, as John's office in the biology wing was placed in such juxtaposition with the criminal science wing that it was impossible for the two of them not to befriend each other over the years. Then again, when you walk past someone in the hallway enough times, eventually you have to say hello, followed eventually by a complement of a tie, or a new pair of glasses. And then came the conversation, presumably...Oh, who knows how they got to be acquainted? One day John was the new professor on the block, and the next he had a best friend, right down the hall within yelling distance. Yet today John decided not to yell, as those older professors who have more wrinkles than PHD's usually don't like noise during their lunch hours, especially when it was coming out of John's office. Despite his being here for a year and a half, he was still the newest professor in this hallway, and therefore was automatically the one who got blamed for disturbing the peace. It wasn't usually a fair accusation, considering Greg was almost always the most vocal of the two of them, while John kept his own voice to a reasonable and professional volume. And so, John minded his footsteps as he walked down the old wooden halls of the university, his feet scuffing against the old red carpet that still clung attractively to the wooden floors. And yet, along with the age of the building there also came almost no discretion at all. Whenever someone decided to move about through the hallways there was always that telltale squeak of the ancient floorboards, and that very squeak must have been why Greg knew to swivel his chair around to face the door before John was able to announce himself.
"Who is it?" John's voice shouted back down, sending something of a chill down Sherlock's spine. He hadn't heard that voice since he said goodbye. Mrs. Watson turned to look at Sherlock in some confusion, realizing that she actually didn't know his name, and instead of asking she looked up at the staircase once more.
"That's rather romantic for you, Professor." Sherlock commented. John blinked, yet he told himself that Sherlock must mean a different connation than he had at first assumed, and decided just to move on.
"Nevertheless, Watson, I was wrong in my youth." Holmes began quietly. "I had assumed that a man such as Victor occurred once in a lifetime, and that so complicated a man as I am would not be blessed with another understanding and compassionate companion. I know now that I was incorrect in that theory. Such a man happens at least twice in a life time. That I know now for sure." And with that he marched off towards his bedroom, snapping the door shut tight and refusing another word the whole evening. It was not until a few moments after his departure that I was able to fully understand the complexity of his final words. It was not after I was much too late to say anything back that I understood he was admitting to finding another desirable companion, and alluding to someone which he might be able to love. Of course it was long after I was sitting in my chair, alone for the rest of the night, that I knew he was talking about me.
"Whenever Mary suggests anything, it is rather an insistence." John agreed with a great sigh.
"Holmes, are you going to go off to bed?" I asked carefully, knowing it best not to disturb him, yet wanting to make aware my presence all the same. Surely it would not be too much to make sure he still did remember my being here, for it might be embarrassing to him to realize that his emotional spectacle was being observed. And, just as predicted, the man perked up with the sound of my voice. He blinked quickly, flattening the papers against his chest and forcing one of those sarcastic smiles which he so often wore insincerely.
"Yes, I hear her. How could I not?" John groaned.
"Ya, that doesn't change the story at all. I did have a headache." John said truthfully.
"I had the strangest dream." Sherlock was saying as they marched out the front door and onto the porch, finding now that the cloudy skies had changed to rain.
"Your name's not the only one on here, mate. See that?" Greg pointed to what appeared to be a bit of paint, peeling from underneath the ink that printed John's name. It was almost like some ancient form of white out. "It looks like you were added afterwards. So, maybe someone changed the names on the deed, from your father's name to yours, or whoever originally owned the house."
"My God, it's the robe." John whispered. Sherlock took a great breath, and with something of a deep blush he slammed the wardrobe door shut, so violently that it shook the entire floor. John jumped back in surprise, not having expected such a violent reaction out of the man. Yet it was as though that robe scared him, it was if none of this had been real until he had found that garment, hanging in wait for him to find it once more.
"I don't like this." He said obviously, however all the same he started down the steps with something of determination.
"It can't actually be you." John protested with a nervous little croak, shaking his head in denial. "Can't actually be you. This picture is ancient, it's old, and withered, it was taken back when...when the house was still occupied."
"Quite the homemaker you are." Sherlock commented quietly, his eyelids drooping peacefully.
"Ah, try being a father then." John warned with a little chuckle.
"Oh no, not an issue at all. It's just that it seems that you're spending a lot of time with this Sherlock fellow, a suspicious amount of time." Mary growled.
"In this life?" John clarified quietly.
"You're taking Sherlock?" Mary exclaimed, storming over to John yet stopping short. She looked as if she had the potential to get violent, for her face had glowed bright red and her lips pursed into an unmistakably thin line. Yet she halted, seeming unwilling to strike her husband or to at least smack his bowl away.
"Don't make this weird, John." Sherlock begged.
"How could it not have been your
"Wednesday? John that's three days away, what am I supposed to do with Rosie?" Mary insisted.
"Hm, thought not. Then you'd have taken all of your things, and that giant poster is still hanging in your bedroom. You know, the one with all the soldiers on it?" Reggie said with a little snicker. John hesitated, looking over to Sherlock with something of a surprised glance. Reggie chuckled, and Sherlock ducked away just to give him a good slap on the arm.
"Not if I'm not there to explain it to her." John said sharply. Sherlock nodded, yet he could obviously see when it was past his time to leave. Surely he couldn't expect to lay about on that couch any longer, now that John had shouldered his bag and headed out the door.
"Besides, what are you doing getting wrapped up in some chemistry major's issues?" Greg asked curiously.
"That's what a lot of people say about me." Sherlock mumbled a bit proudly. John looked over at him with a little side smile, however Sherlock looked a bit ashamed at his own words. Almost as if he was surprised he had actually said such a thing out loud. Then again, John decided to just ignore that comment, considering they had both been witness to his ancestor's (or past self's, who knows?) way of putting such good looks to work. And so he just got the key from his pocket, locking his car doors and starting his way up to the front door. Sherlock followed along eagerly, bounding up the stairs and breathing very deep breaths, taking in the house and all of its surroundings in the same sort of way someone might do when they have returned home after a long while. Taking in every little thing, everything they might have taken for granted before...and just savoring it all. John smiled at him, in his own way to call Sherlock to attention, and with that he stuck the key in the lock and turned. And just like that, the door swung open before them both. John stood back, lingering so that he could allow Sherlock to be the first one in. He was curious what the boy might do. John had felt drawn to certain parts of the house when he had first entered, so it might be some sort of character study to see how Sherlock might react, and where he might wander to. This might help him piece together this puzzle, once and for all. Sherlock might have been his missing link all along. Sherlock wandered inside like a man in a trance, his feet walking without full consent of his mind. He merely wandered, here and there about the foyer as if he knew just where to step, and just what to look at. For a moment he stared at the painting which was on the ceiling, and for another moment he observed the chandelier, and then again he stared for a long while at the various statues which were hidden away in the shadowed alcoves. And John merely watched, he felt as though none of the art which was hiding about this house would even come close to the amount of beauty depicted before him in human form, and so John merely closed the door behind him, pocketed the key, and leaned up against the wood. He watched as Sherlock's eyes sparkled, like a child's on Christmas day, and he watched as his long limbs swayed this way and that, swaying from side to side in his own majestic way. John felt more complete now than he ever had, there was a feeling of pleasure that wasn't just coming from himself and Sherlock, but from the house itself. It was considerably warmer, John could feel that warmth and that pride within his very bones, this house was congratulating him on following the clues it had left for him. It was congratulating him for finding the missing link, and bringing this household back together again. Something made John speculate that they had been here before, both of them in this house in other ages...long ago. The house was merely welcoming Sherlock back, it was accepting him once more as part of the family. Finally Sherlock began to walk, without a word he mounted the staircase and ascended like a man on a mission. His fingertips trailed the wooden banister, in a pattern which may already be so familiar to him, and he stepped up the stairway in quite the dreamlike stance.
"You say that as if you want that to be the case." Sherlock pointed out, admiring the ring on his finger as he held it up to the sunlight.
"Not excited, per say. Just hopeful maybe, that I've been right to wait all this time to find the right person. Perhaps I knew there was someone, written into my destiny." Sherlock admitted with something of a quiet smile. John sighed heavily, yet forced himself to look a little bit appreciative as well.
"I'm not saying your close minded at all, I'm just suggesting theories!" Sherlock defended.
"What is going on?" John groaned, clutching the picture to his heart with one hand and messaging his aching temples with the other. He sunk deeper and deeper into the cushions, sighing with every breath and shaking his head in denial. Maybe this was all just a dream, and when he woke up he would find that everything actually made sense. That everything in his life wasn't just collecting around him to give him more of a headache, and confuse his version of reality, and jumble up his idea of time as a linear concept. What did this house want with him, what was the Town Hall trying to do, was this some sort of joke? Had they given John this key, painted his name on that will, and hired Sherlock Holmes to pose for an old picture and then meander about the college? Was this some sort of candid camera thing, were their cameras hidden in the walls, in the eyes of the statues? Was that why John never felt as though he was alone? It was easier to think that was the truth, it was easier to diagnose this entire ordeal on a carefully planned plot, and the cruelty of others, than to actually admit there might be something supernatural going on. Than to actually admit that this was...well that this simply didn't make sense. John was a man of science, he didn't like it when things didn't add up, or when pieces didn't fit into the puzzle he was trying to create. Logic had never failed him up to this point, and it was just giving him the most splitting headache. But that's what it wanted, didn't it? Whether the culprit for this scheme be some corrupt anchorman, or just simply the house itself. This was the goal, wasn't it? Somewhere, someone was laughing at him.
"No, I think it'll be a trapdoor." John admitted, searching the ceilings instead of the walls for the telltale outline.
"Hello?" Mrs. Watson asked apprehensively, looking at Sherlock through the screen door with every sign of shoving the door shut in his face.
"You know as well as I that it's not as simple as that." Sherlock scoffed. John sighed heavily, shaking his head and folding his hands a bit apprehensively on his desk. He stared at the picture some more, a beautifully photographed image, with that man looking long, lean, and handsome. That man that might be so tempting.
"I mean no offense, Mr. Watson. Only that you're married now, to a woman, and I could only imagine that sexualities rather come along with the soul. If we really are the same people then..."
"I think I...I think I need to go to the hospital." John muttered. Sherlock heard Mrs. Watson gasp, for she could probably connect the dots from there.
"What makes you think he's your soulmate?" John asked with a nervous little laugh. Oh that word cut deep, and the connotations behind it even worse! Sherlock's little comment made it clear that he had already disregarded John as his option. He seemed to think that out of the two of them that had followed him through the ages, it was this mystery man that was supposed to be his partner. And not John, for whatever reason.
"We're going to try." John agreed. "We can look him up later, I'm sure if he now lives half as extravagantly as he did before it'll be simply to find him."
"All missions aside, John, you were staring at this thing when I came in." Greg pointed out.
"Well the dreams we've been having, that's all. They all seem to involve someone, another character in this great play of past and present." Sherlock admitted.
"It doesn't have to make sense, really. We're the last three humans alive...who's there to judge us?" John offered with a rather pitiful smile. He meant that to be a joke, and in some ways it did have an air of humor to it. For the most part it was rather depressing.
"You're a father?" Sherlock clarified in some surprise, his gaze softening into something that looked half like pride, and the other half of something along the lines of disappointment.
"In all honesty, I've only been told to act my age when I'm immature. Never has anyone complained that I'm being too mature." Greg pointed out with a wagging finger, all the while he was still completing his second turn in his swivel chair and therefore had his back facing John. "Not until now." John corrected, kicking the door shut and wincing when it made a loud bang. "Well, there you go. Now you'll get to witness the real mature folks, as they come in here with their daily noise complaints." Greg groaned, finally ceasing his spinning by planting his feet solidly on the floor and pulling himself up to the table, as if to further investigate the paper John had just laid down on top of the piles of assignments that littered the man's desk.
"Are you feeling any better honey?" Mary asked sweetly, hovering by the counter as John leaned over his breakfast, still unable to eat. The eggs and bacon which usually made his stomach growl in urgency were instead making him feel as though he was going to be sick.
"You haven't thought yourself anymore special, since this all began?" Sherlock wondered quietly.
"Does this mean we're technically ex's then?" Sherlock muttered quietly.
"Watson, it was merely child's play, merely a small infatuation which I in my youth could not hope to understand." Holmes corrected coolly, shaking his head in an almost shameful way. "What a fool I was in my past, Watson. And what a fool I had still grown to be."
"Yes, I think it is." Mrs. Hudson agreed, nodding as she finally turned down an old dirt path, just a mere patch in the grass that must have been a driveway when this house had visitors. It was odd...in fact, it was more than odd when John first saw the house. He was amazed, of course he was amazed! It was a fantastic structure, looming in the distance like one of those ancient Victorian houses, that sort which was very obviously just an excuse to show off how much money the original owners possessed. Back in the old times they couldn't waste their money on electronics or music, and so all of their wasted inheritance was put into infrastructure and architecture, and thus producing such a house which stood before him today. The house was breathtaking, or at least John felt as though he should've been breathless. He figured that he should've been taken aback, amazed even, at what sort of house he had inherited. And yet, for whatever reason, he wasn't surprised. For whatever reason a small part of him knew this was coming, a part of his brain that hadn't come to life until now. John looked upon the house and immediately recognized it, from some place or another, and he knew exactly what to expect as they drew nearer. The tall, looming windows coupled with the cement stairway leading up to the ancient oak door, he felt as though he had seen this all once before! There was a porch stretching all around the house, with a greenhouse off to the left, overcome now with weeds and vines, all sorts of plants which grew in once it had been left unkempt for so long. And there was a pond, something small yet impressive all the same, with a little dock rotting down into the mud. The place was indeed a little rundown, as the white paint was peeling down in long steady strips, and some windows had been replaced with boards, presumably from when it had been officially condemned. Yet all together the wood seemed to be intact, the structure didn't look flimsy. In fact, it looked as tall and proud as it must have when it had first been built. And yet that had to have been hundreds of years ago, a hundred years of living, a hundred years of rotting- and still here the house stood, tall and proud. As if it had been waiting for someone to come and salvage it before long.
"Well, you could always just abandon me I suppose. I've got no power against that." he shrugged. John sighed heavily, leaning against the wall and tapping his fingers a little bit angrily against his leg.
"Well ya! I was a graduate student not too long ago, and in my experience every single one of them had a posture that was only completed when their nose was stuck in the air. They're rotten and selfish, if not battling for GPA then merely battling about their family's money." Greg grumbled.
"Cold?" John presumed, backing out and heading down the ever familiar route to the house. Sherlock sighed heavily, finally leaning back in his chair and pouting a little bit tiredly.
"And pounds. Old ones." He commented.
"That's not it, Greg. I just feel like the house is playing tricks on me, it's getting into my head. I feel mad, Greg. I feel positively mad." John sighed.
"Not your picture? No, just holding on to it for someone else? All the while staring at it, and keeping it on your desk? My God, aren't you married to a
"Look at his picture then, scroll down." Sherlock insisted. John sighed, pounding a bit on the down arrow (to which Sherlock winced) and just now seeing a large portrait of a man standing up near what looked to be a large, French style building. Only half of his face was visible, the other half was cloaked in shadow, yet it was undeniably him. A modern day Victor Trevor, half of his face matching almost perfectly with the drawing that Sherlock had done. John nodded his head, pushing the laptop away before he had to look at anything more. He really did hate to have to see this, Victor's arrival into his life cut like a dagger and he wasn't even here yet! Certainly when Victor made his grand entrance everything that John had with Sherlock would be lost, ruined with this horrible man! This man who Sherlock would undoubtedly prefer.
For a moment they were quiet, for John turned to pat Rosie on the head in greeting. The baby didn't seem to care much that he had reappeared, and so he turned back to Sherlock and gave him something of a little smile of encouragement. Sherlock nodded, shuffling his feet a bit uncomfortably and turning his gaze back onto Mary, who was just now uncorking a new bottle from the rack.
"Here he is." Sherlock said finally, handing John the paper so that he could take a look. He sighed heavily, turning it towards himself and looking rather grimly down at the face. It was undeniably beautiful, someone John would certainly have no fighting chance against. Perhaps this drawing wasn't entirely accurate, maybe Sherlock was playing up his beauty in his own hopes of getting matched up with someone as attractive. It was a perfectly sculpted face, something quite like Sherlock's except a bit more mischievous looking, with dark eyes that were obviously thinking many different things at once. There were no colors visible, yet his hair was swooped across his forehead in such a way that made it obvious he used a fair amount of product, and his thin lips were poised into something of a devious smile. John saw the face and knew at once that it belonged to the stranger he had seen in that feverish vision, that face that had been with Sherlock up atop that green table, most likely the billiards table from Sherlock's own dream. And so here it was, John's undoing. The crashing and burning of his hopes of perhaps being the only man in Sherlock's life, the only one from both of his lives.
"I hate to argue, Professor, but if I may ask, would you have accepted it was real if I had admitted to being in your house? Because you seemed pretty set on my involvement." Sherlock pointed out with a gleam in his eyes.
"If I was a prostitute I wouldn't be filing for taxes, now would I? Come on then, don't make me take it from you." Sherlock warned.
"That's a stupid lie." Greg decided.
"I mean, well are we going to treat him like our own? Are we going to be his fathers?" John wondered at last.
John sat miserably in his office, checking his watch to make sure he was still within his time frame. The picture sat on his desk, amongst all his other old photographs so that no one would notice anything was particularly out of place. Even though he detested that photograph, or rather just its existence in general, he still felt as though it had to be displayed. It was, well above all other things it was very beautiful. It was seductive of course, for the look in Sherlock's eyes, directed at the camera, was a look that only had one purpose. That look was the thing that drew someone in, it was the look that made the audience know for sure that they were allowed closer. His body was the prize, but that look was an utter magnet. John didn't know in what context this picture was taken, he couldn't guess as to what the motivation was behind it. Had Sherlock decided to wear such a flimsy outfit for the sake of the picture, was he posing so that all the generations after him would be entranced by his gaze? Or rather was this his natural state, and the observer wanted to capture it? What had been going on before this picture, oh but more accurately, what would go on after it? The moment that camera flashed, the moment Sherlock came back to life out of this still frame. John could imagine it now; well simply because he had seen it before. He had seen this picture before, in live action...all displayed in his head. In that dream he had, before he had ever seen Sherlock's face, before he had ever seen this picture. He knew all too well that after that camera flashed, that Sherlock would draw back his head against the bedpost, still clinging to his robe with one fist, but grabbing onto the post with his other, pulling himself against it in a helpless position. He would sigh heavily, with his chest heaving up and down so visibly, the white skin stretching across his neck, across his collarbones... He was made to be admired, that man. He was made to be worshipped, and this stance was merely his call for followers. For men to bow down before him, gasping and kissing and loving
"It wanted us to sleep there? Whatever for?" John asked apprehensively, for he knew at once what Sherlock was getting at. He meant the dreams...surely he had one too.
"I love ghost stories." The boy said instinctively, yet John waved him off indifferently. "My name's Sherlock, by the way. I'm studying chemistry."
"Well, a bag of money isn't that suggestive. Besides, if I really did...well if I really did have such an occupation I wouldn't have gotten my own desk." Sherlock pointed out. "I wasn't a permanent resident."
"Holmes." I hissed in my rush, hearing now the sound of approaching footsteps.
"What question?" Sherlock asked, his eyes narrowing now in some sort of offense, as if he found John's new wild mannerisms to be rather insulting.
"Our past." Sherlock reminded him. John nodded, his stomach twisting anxiously telling him again and again that he should just vomit so as to avoid the conclusion his brain was forming.
"You know it could never go back to the way it was." Sherlock whispered, looking just a little bit uncomfortable. Of course the same idea popped into their heads, that accursed letter! That was a rejection, the first of many undoubtedly, a rejection to something that wasn't even an offer!
"Well no, not really." Sherlock murmured, shuffling his feet against the floor in a guilty sort of way.
"John I need to tell you something, something that's..."
"A boy." Sherlock agreed, looking towards Mary's lifeless body and feeling a horrible pang of regret. Well surely that was the end of it. He stepped closer to the woman, where she lay with her eyes still open and her mouth stretched in an expression of pain. She was cold to the touch, though Sherlock was just able to set her eyes shut, to make her look a bit more restful. John was too occupied with the child to at first grieve for the woman's passing, though before long Sherlock was sure he would be in tears. There had hardly been love aboard this ship, mere acceptance. The loss of one of their own was not a personal pain, but a species wide defeat. Their last capable female had just died, surely dooming the population. The fourth generation, that little child wriggling in John Watson's arms...that was the last of them, wasn't it? That was the species doomed to die alone.
"I think it might be. Making us feel special, as if we mean something in this world. Or at least meant enough to be brought back. Introduced us to the idea of destiny, only to rip it away again, and curse us to the mortality of the common man." Sherlock muttered. John blinked, not having expected a small philosophical lesson from Sherlock so abruptly. He didn't really know how to respond to such a thing, and so he looked a bit anxiously towards the door where Mrs. Hudson had disappeared through, hoping her reappearance might interrupt his answer. Unfortunately she stayed missing, and the room as just as quiet as ever.
"Aw John, can't reach?" Sherlock teased, patting his head as you would with a dog. John growled, pushing him away and folding his arms a bit moodily.
"Why would you want to do that?" John asked with a laugh.
"I don't want any love confessions, God if you make me remember that night again I'll throw you from the window." John warned furiously. Sherlock just stared at him, feeling almost insulted as he watched the almost terrified boy lingering at the door.
"Holmes this is...this is unbelievable." I managed instead, thinking of course why such documents might be held as blackmail. What I had taken as a cold, unusable heart was instead something much more confusing, something which had puzzled not only the psychological world but the social aspects as well. Holmes was not an emotionless creature, he was a homosexual. I took another breath, this time more amazed than afraid, as I realized of course how much sense that made. In fact it was an almost comforting trait, knowing now that his humanity presented itself in a different form rather than being completely inexistent.
"Weren't we the previous owners?" Sherlock pointed out, tearing the sheet off of the desk and nodding proudly. "Beautiful." He muttered, though John wasn't entirely sure if he was commenting on the desk itself, or the reflection Sherlock saw in the mirror. In John's opinion, both was the correct answer anyway. The desk had plenty of drawers, none of which Sherlock seemed to interested in. his attention had instead been caught, as usual, by the shining thing that was sitting on the desk. It was a simple band of gold, something rather unexciting in John's mind. Yet just as soon as Sherlock saw it he gave a little cry of recognition, as if that little ring had meant so much to him at one point. The very idea made John a bit sick, for he of all people could identify an engagement ring. He had to look at them so dreadfully long, so long ago when he thought he had picked the right partner.
"You don't think you had a family?" John wondered.
"But this can't be happening to me." John whispered, shaking his head ever so gently before holding his hand up to wipe away the first tear that fell down his cheek. Sherlock gave a great sigh of regret, rushing up to him to no protest. John flinched when he took his hands and yet he didn't pull away, no he wasn't stupid enough to deny this any longer. His fingers were smooth and yet they were trembling, suddenly he was overcoming his denial and was beginning to realize what was happening now. He was beginning to fear death as he should.
"Sherlock, do you mind stepping inside for a moment? I've got to show you something." John muttered just as soon as Sherlock was within earshot. He nodded eagerly, as if he was just happy to be included once more in this little adventure, their shared ghost story as he was so anxious to call it.
I first took note of my friend's particular carefulness as we stumbled over the cold body of Charles Augustus Milverton, a man who once held several particularly important lives in his own hands, and now was without his own. The safe which held such important documents, those which would be responsible for the downfalls of many important ladies and gentleman, should of course they ever see the light of the public eye, was open and filled to the brim with such condemning papers and notes. It was Mr. Sherlock Holmes's mission now to destroy the documents, for the house was already stirring with the sound of a gunshot, and we hadn't much time to spare the lives and reputations of our client, as well as the other unfortunate souls who had let their secrets spill much too easily. Talkative housemaids, butlers, and grooms were responsible for the letters and papers which contained their masters' or mistresses' most dear secrets, and it was all I could do now but stand back and watch as Holmes threw great handfuls into the blazing fire. I didn't bother checking to see if Mr. Milverton was still alive, for such a villain was not worthy of my care, yet it was with some anxiousness that I stood and watched my friend at work. The house had been alerted, the police would surely be called, and here we were, dressed in black with masks around our eyes, standing at the scene of the crime. Of course we would be the suspected murderers, should our presence be discovered, and it was the fear of the gallows which made me hurry him along with quick cues of eagerness. Yet something seemed to have caught his eye, a particular note or letter that was tied up in a great bundle near the back of the safe, with the older, less useful items of the container. Surely it had some great value, for his stern face paled as he examined the thing with long, trembling fingers.
"Professor Watson?" Reggie clarified, squinting into the darkness, to which John managed a nervous little wave. "Sherlock, you're leaving with
"Why don't you stay home from school today? We can all go for a walk in the fresh air; it'll be good for us." Mary suggested with a little smile, pulling John's plate out from under him with the understanding that it would go uneaten. John groaned, rubbing his dark, hallowed eyes and forcing a grin onto his face.
"No, no. Trust me Sherlock; you don't want to read this." John insisted.
"Hurry up!" Sherlock growled, nearly kicking open his car door in his urgency and spilling out onto the driveway. He looked completely agonized, almost as if the screaming was just getting louder in his head, while it was dulling down in John's. John nodded, fumbling for the large key in his pocket while he dashed up onto the old wooden porch. Just as soon as he stuck the key inside he pushed the door open, and for a moment all he could hear was the swinging of the door on its rusty hinges. And then, finally...silence. John sighed heavily, happy to hear his own breath once again. He looked back at where Sherlock was, now laying his limbs strewn about on the gravel, breathing heavily yet with drooping eyes, as if he could finally allow himself to relax. He was muttering something, his lips forming words that John couldn't quite make out. Most probably it was something along the lines of "thank God."
"Yes, are you?" Sherlock asked. John took a shuttering little breath, taking a sip of wine with an uncomfortable little jump.
"John this is something more than pain." Sherlock whispered quietly. "This is something more than just...ugh! What is it; I can't even put it into words! It's just a feeling, a feeling of devouring, like something is eating me up from the inside."
"Documents, boys!" she exclaimed excitedly. "And it seems as though there was indeed a Mr. John Watson, died at the house."
"I um...yes I should have one somewhere." John agreed, tossing Sherlock a loose piece of parchment all the while he dug around in the mess of papers for one of his pens. After a moment Sherlock got to drawing, looking quite focused in the task and therefore distracted enough to not notice John's staring at him. It was like a weight upon his shoulders, really, to sit here waiting for his competition to be drawn out on this paper. There was another man, then, someone that will arrive just to steal Sherlock away from him. Well of course John hadn't been treating Sherlock anything like a proper suitor should! And in the end, John was a married man and Sherlock had a shred of decency, nothing would have ever worked out. Yet there was something to be said about opportunity, and that little ounce of hope that stirs in your heart when there still was that off chance. There wasn't love in John's heart, at least none that he could properly recognize as of now. There was admiration, and appreciation, and of course just a sort of possession that could not go disregarded. He liked that it was just the two of them, he liked that Sherlock and he were alone against the rest of the world, and inside such a bond there must be at least some sort of unspoken romance. Yet now there was a change, now there might be something tearing them apart in the end. Sherlock's dedication to another man, Sherlock's partnership from the past. If John got lucky then the man would prove to not have survived the transition from past to present, this face that would be drawn now might have disappeared a century ago, when the house had been shut down. Yet what John already knew of his luck, well that was certainly not going to happen. He knew well enough not to count on his own fortunes, for in the end everything he wanted so dearly had a way of turning its back on him, and leaving him wondering what he did wrong to have disrespected Fate in such a way.
"Well I don't, really. I just sort of had a piece of paper, and drew it on a whim. It's rubbish anyway, I'm a bad artist." John managed with a little chuckle.
"No, no one's stalking me." John grumbled, shaking his head and sighing in exasperation. Oh what a fool he was! "You just, you look like someone I thought I saw. But it's nothing, it's...I'm just letting ghost stories go to my head!"
"And I'm sure everyone here is grateful that we have been drinking white wine tonight." Sherlock agreed.
"Oh you know me, just catching up on grading." John lied with a sigh.
"Yes honey, what is it? Is that boy gone?" Mrs. Watson asked, presumably looking away from whatever dinner she was making for the family.
"Why do you say it's hellish? I thought this was some nice mansion, and if it's really pretty, and nicely kept, well then what's the issue?" Greg wondered in some protest, in his own mission to prove that he knew everything. Well of course he wouldn't understand, John felt as though there was only one other person who had even the capability of understanding his struggles. And that was, of course, Sherlock Holmes. The boy who should be making his way through the halls any moment now.
"Watch yourself, Professor." Sherlock warned after a moment's pause, although he sounded more regretful than hostile. "You're a married man, and you're drawing dangerously close to flirtation."
"Why?" Mary wondered, bouncing Rosie up and down in her arms. That baby had just finally quieted, and John was appreciating the silence that he could hear once more.
"Our pasts shouldn't define us. We're our own people, we're free to live these lives and we're free to change them to our desires. There's no obligation for any of our past to repeat itself, there's no reason not to get married, or to get a master's degree, or to go and live a life away from this place. I'm all for being special, but I'll be damned if I'm not free." Sherlock growled, and with that he got to his feet and started his way from the dining room, leaving John to sit at the table in some confusion, trying to decide if he had said something wrong, or if Sherlock was even angry at all. Of course John was still yet to figure out what to do when Sherlock got mad, and so he finished one more slice of pizza before getting to his feet as well and wandering about the house to try to find his companion.
"It's fine!" John announced, looking now to the ceiling so as to make sure there weren't any bats hanging around. Thankfully he seemed to be the only living thing, up until Sherlock ascended to join him.
"No I'm fine. I'm fine here all the same." Sherlock assured with a large yawn. John sighed, knowing of course that Sherlock probably hadn't slept in days. Miraculously John had been able to get a little bit of sleep, for while the screaming in his head had been loud, it had been monotonous enough to be lost into the back of his mind. It was much like the screaming baby, eventually the same noise gets ignored, and you find yourself able to sleep in any situation.
"Sorry, no I'm just...no what were you saying?" John asked again.
"Oh surely it's owner must've put it down and died, or something." Sherlock suggested with a shrug.
"I'll have you know, Professor, that in this life I am a virgin." Sherlock offered quietly. John hesitated, not entirely sure if he wanted to know that or not. Then again, it was a very good defense against the accusations John had been throwing around in their last encounter. John nodded, not entirely sure how to respond to that, feeling his throat suddenly beginning to get very tight. He knew his face was glowing, yet he did not want to bring very much light to that.
"Not if you do it right. But you won't know that until you're at least a year in, would you? Just you wait, John, soon all those pretty girls will look very tempting." Greg teased. John groaned, shaking his head and wondering to himself why he even thought telling Greg would be worth his time. He ought to have known that Greg would use the house to make fun of his new wedding ring. It had only been a couple of months since he had gotten married to Mary Morstan, and yet those months had still managed to be filled with love and commitment. The couple just had their first child together, a little newborn named Rosie, a beautiful baby with little wisps of blonde hair and the most adorable toothless smile. Now of course, this was the most delightful thing to ever happen to John, at least in his conscious recollection, all the while Greg constantly reminded him that a child was a weight, and a wife was the shackle. That man always did like to make fun of John for settling down, probably in his own denial of the miserable state of bachelor he had found himself in. Then again, Greg was too much of a playboy to settle down. He never got very far with his girlfriends, usually because he got bored of them within a couple of weeks. And because of that, it simply wasn't Greg's place to call John's love life a failure.
"Yes well, sometimes it's nice just to hang out with a man who isn't so keen. It makes friendship only too complicated." Sherlock growled. "That's why it's nice to have you."
"That's a strangely obsessive view point for you, John. You didn't even care about the house yesterday." Mary pointed out with a frown.
"I can still beat you to a pulp, I guarantee it." he defended quickly.
"If I'm not a burden, well...does she insist?" Sherlock asked a bit nervously, his eyes narrowing in some suspicion.
"Yes of course. My dream of the billiard room, well I was with a man who certainly was not someone I recognized." Sherlock muttered. John felt his heart drop just the slightest, nodding his head slowly. Well of course he might have known this was coming...if Sherlock had seen himself with John then he might have mentioned it before. Certainly John had been preparing himself for this confession?
"Sherlock!" John exclaimed horrifically, blinking his eyes so as to make sure he was reading this correctly. "Sherlock get up!" he yelled, jumping from his chair and going to rouse the man who was still sleeping soundly. John shook Sherlock's shoulder, finally forcing some reaction out of the man. He yelled sharply, lunging away from John and retreating into the deeper folds of the old couch.
"As if you don't ignore me here." Mary muttered, pulling her hand away and storming out of the bedroom in one of her little fits. John sighed heavily, shaking his head and deciding that if Mary wanted to be difficult then it was her own fault. Besides, there was no possible way she could be allowed to come get Victor. First of all, that would expose their operation, and John would have no choice but to confess everything! Secondly, Mary's presence would just spoil what time John had left with Sherlock before he felt that he had to hand him over. Oh John really did have a way of digging himself into a hole, didn't he? One that he would never be able to escape, no matter how hard he tried. For if he was trying to lie to Mary then she got mad at him for the little parts of the lie that he didn't account for! And if he was trying to be truthful to Sherlock, then Sherlock got mad at him for the things he couldn't control! And if he fell in love with Sherlock...then he couldn't say a word, lest he be crucified for it. John sighed heavily, deciding that he really best not argue with his wife right now. He had enough trouble with her as it was, and to add some more fuel to the fire would be unnecessary. She didn't deserve to hurt, especially for things that were completely out of John's control. It wasn't his fault that she couldn't tag along to the conference that didn't even exist. And so he went back to packing his things, throwing in a couple of shirts, some shoes, pants, and a dinner jacket just in case Victor decided to take them somewhere fancy. Truth be told, John wasn't expecting this to be a very large affair. He wasn't expecting this to take very long, just long enough for the two of them to drag Victor back to England with them, and introduce him to the house. Who knows, maybe he'll have already packed in anticipation. Maybe he was just waiting for the okay. John felt as though he would have a stroke of luck if Victor was hesitant, and considering his luck thus far, he decided that it was thoroughly impossible. If he wished for something to happen then certainly the opposite would occur, especially when his relationship with Sherlock was involved. John then moved to his work bag, knowing of course that even in Paris he would have to keep up with grading. He was dumping out some important files when out came that picture frame, tumbling out on top of his clothes so as to display Sherlock once more. This ancient photograph, taken undoubtedly to torture everyone who saw it in the future, anyone who might be allowed to imagine Sherlock as they knew him in that same state. John sighed heavily, staring deep into those eyes, those eyes which depicted emotion he may never see in life. Only on this tattered picture would John be able to receive such a gaze from Sherlock Holmes, only on this tattered picture would he see any amount of Sherlock that was not supposed to be made public. John sighed heavily, deciding that he had no choice but to throw that picture among his clothes in his bag. Besides, if Victor needed any proof then that picture would surely serve as enough. There was no denying that ancient photograph depicted Sherlock Holmes, the man that lived now.
"Well I've been preoccupied." John protested. "Besides, that's all she wanted. Attention."
"I've found him, Victor Trevor." Sherlock announced proudly, standing up to his highest height and beaming. John sighed, noticing now that the artist's name was undoubtedly the name they had seen on that death certificate. He tried to fight off his disappointment, for he had known all along that it would only be a matter of time until this man walked into their lives.
"Now what is all this yelling about in here? Really one would think you were having an argument..." Mary's voice trailed away when she finally saw the state the men had been left in, standing now about ready to get in a fist fight. Mary gasped, putting her hands over her heart so as to make obvious her drastic surprise.
"Crazy." Sherlock admitted carefully. John moved then to another box, this one filled with candelabras of some sort. The next was filled with books, which was interesting since there was a perfectly big library upstairs.
"Well perhaps he's just around in town somewhere. I mean, it's a miracle the two of us met how we did, and if he's positioned just as close then we might have a chance of just bumping into him." Sherlock suggested.
Thankfully Sherlock arrived right on time, just soon enough so that John would not lose his mind any longer. With every passing minute he had become more anxious, yet it was a lot better to watch the clock count towards three o'clock than away from it. The question of what to say was a lot easier to answer than whether or not Sherlock was coming at all, and so thankfully as the clock struck three there was a knock at the door. His perfect timing definitely betrayed his own urgency, for John could only assume that the boy had been struggling with his own questions, he may have been sitting out in the hallway, agonizing for a while over what to say, and who owed who an apology. As soon as the door opened John straightened up in his chair, staring up at Sherlock and feeling as though his breath had been lost from his body. He felt entranced, in a way, as he stared up to the man who walked in. That beautiful man, who took each stride as elegantly as possible, and who was now closing the door softly behind him.
"No, no I don't. I think it was mad at us for something." John admitted.
"I don't know!" he exclaimed. "I don't know! God Sherlock, you expect me to know every crevice of my own soul, every little whim of this overactive heart of mine? Who knows what I liked then, who knows what I like now! It's just rather offensive that you don't seem to imagine me having the capabilities to be open minded!"
"Well I'm sure you're perfectly sane, John. I mean really, you're one of the smartest guys I know." Greg said with a little grin.
"You had an odd dream then?" John asked nervously.
"No it's...well I don't want to mess anything up. How far is the house?" Sherlock wondered.
"I don't know." John admitted quietly. "I don't know."
"Do you think that..." John sighed heavily, shaking his head and turning away from Sherlock for a moment. What was he even supposed to ask, how could he even think of any more ways to phrase this so that it made sense, so that it seemed
"Oh stop that, it's not what I mean! I knew that I was just living a life, and you know how people talk about life as if it's an abrupt thing, precious and meaningful...well I always just felt that deep down that was all just talk. It didn't apply to me; somehow I was able to determine that everything happening was merely, well just transport. It was just another life, just another go at it. In some ways that made me feel special, not too scared of messing up. Then again, it also made me sad, because I knew that whatever I did wouldn't be permanent, it wasn't the purpose of my life. I knew I'd find the purpose when it came to me." Sherlock admitted.
"Yes." Sherlock admitted quietly. "But I simply mean to defend my original point; I'm not quite sure what purpose that house served. But I know it was no host for anyone with the capabilities of producing a family. I could hardly imagine there was a single woman who ever stepped foot inside, save for the maids."
of your company?" John growled.
"How very distinguished." Mary said with a proud little smile.
"You're right here, aren't you? Not a big secret after all." John muttered, to which Sherlock gave a weak sort of slap and ventured deeper into the attic.
"Indeed." John agreed, smiling now that a flame had begun to spread through the ancient wood, burning through quite nicely and finally offering up a comfortable heat. With such a simple flame this cold, barren sitting room became something much more like a home. The fire was shimmering, bouncing flickering beams of light off of the walls and creating friendly shadows. There was warmth, there was crackling, and furthermore there was the calm, peaceful sigh of Sherlock Holmes as he drew his knees back to his chest, snuggling now in the warmth that was being offered.
"I can't help but think, Professor, that there may be another one of us somewhere in this world." Sherlock suggested quietly, thankfully bringing it upon himself to change the topic of conversation before John had to say anything more on the topic of virginity.
"Yes, that's sort of the only downside." Sherlock agreed with a shrug.
"The house?" Greg clarified, rolling his hand over his wrist a couple of times in quiet pondering. "Ya, the house, the deed...I mean where do I go from here?" John agreed with a tried glance, wondering just how much maintenance this house was going to need, if it even was his own house at all! There was still some doubt in his mind about the truthfulness behind the deed, as if it was just some practical joke two hundred years in the making.
"It's beautiful, my God it's absolutely breathtaking!" Mary exclaimed excitedly, jumping once more with enthusiasm and sliding around dangerously in the mud as she fell back down upon her feet.
"Popcorn." John corrected. Sherlock burst out into a fit of giggles, as if he really couldn't imagine John going about and selling large bags of popcorn. "And it was good popcorn too, don't get me wrong. Cheddar popcorn, it always sold the fastest."
"I suppose I could love you, John." Sherlock decided at last. He thought about it for a while, and with his very narrow definition of love it seemed as though perhaps they could manage it. He was attractive, and in a way he was gentle enough to admire. He would make a good father, and perhaps a good husband as well. What did they have to lose, really, by committing to each other?
"Yes well, let's hope you're wrong." Sherlock muttered, following John down the trapdoor as they both wished that their preoccupation with the new search might distract them from their latest discoveries. Oh but it was no use, even if they didn't discuss it. John could tell himself that the Town Hall was more exhilarating than his past affair with Sherlock, yet as much as he wanted to think about all the questions he was going to ask Mrs. Hudson he could only imagine just more and more detail of the night they shared. All the more infuriating was the question of whether such images had simply been conjured from his mind or if they were being offered from the House now that the truth had gotten out. Perhaps that could only be answered by asking Sherlock how he saw the whole thing in his head, and if their pictures matched. Yet that would only be asking too much, for if John had to sit here in the car and listen to Sherlock list off the things he saw them doing in his head...well let's just say it wasn't very likely that those same things wouldn't play out in the moments following. All the same, Sherlock hadn't had any experiences like that yet. He didn't know what to expect, perhaps he had no images at all. Perhaps he shuttered a bit uncomfortably, yet could not imagine any farther than just kissing. Oh wouldn't it be ghastly if John was the one who had to explain it all to him? Well no, these days it was hard to avoid any movies without some explicit context. And even if Sherlock did know just how to be intimate, well surely it was driving him mad? Surely it was making him all the more curious, all the more anxious? If he was so set on the idea of soulmates, well perhaps he was beginning to wonder if he had found his after all. Supposedly that answer would come with the existence of Victor Trevor. If the man was not alive today then it would be only too obvious that John was meant to be with Sherlock. If he was alive, well then that would make things all the more complicated? It would put this apparent pattern back into play, a live triangle that had stood the tests of time. Perhaps that's why the house brought them back in the first place! Perhaps it didn't approve of the ending they had given themselves, perhaps it thought Sherlock was destined for the other. They sat in what might have been the most uncomfortable silence John had ever experienced, for he knew that just as soon as Sherlock's eyes turned to the window and glassed over that he was lost now in the very same thoughts. He was considering it, pondering it, and wondering now what it might all mean. What the significance was, behind his previous affair with John, and his current state of companion. The drive to the Town Hall only took about ten minutes, yet it felt more like ten days when finally John pulled into the parking lot. His heart had been beating so loudly, yet he had insisted on keeping his breathing under control and so he had been basically suffocating himself as he drove. He felt as though the only way to supply himself oxygen was through large gasps, and of course Sherlock might suspect something was up if he just began gasping behind the wheel. And so as soon as John jumped out of the car (which was only a couple of seconds after he put it in park) he took a great big gulp of air, stretching out his legs and waiting now for Sherlock to get situated. The boy emerged from the car looking quite nervous, looking up at John before nodding and walking inside as properly as he could manage. Thankfully Mrs. Hudson was sitting at the desk, for she had just addressed Sherlock before she saw John come in behind him. Her business face melted away as a genuine smile appeared on her face, and she looked straight past Sherlock as if he no longer concerned her.
"Yes, something about a billiards room. In fact I do rather remember seeing one when..."
"Is that it?" Mary interrupted eagerly, suddenly ignoring the potholes as she craned her neck as close to the windshield as she could get, pointing excitedly at the looming shape of a house through the trees and shadows.
"You don't think my dream saw into the past, did it? You don't think there's any truth to it?" Sherlock asked nervously.
master, the original owner. The name which had been painted over on the deed, in an attempt to pass off this house and all of its mysteries onto someone else, someone they considered more worthy of the burden.
Mary demanded. John stopped, realizing of course that he hadn't yet mentioned that he would not be traveling alone. Oh well, there would be no denying it now.
"I'm happy." John agreed quietly, nodding his head and leaning it back against the cushion, back enough so that he could feel the indentation of where Sherlock's weight was distributed. He could feel that boy getting closer with every ounce of pressure he applied.
"Oh wonderful! Wonderful, I'll set another plate out." Mary said excitedly, for she always did love to meet new people.
"Why do you hope so, Professor?" Sherlock asked carefully. John sighed, shrugging his shoulders and feeling a little bit uncomfortable under Sherlock's glare. The boy seemed to be reading his mind, or at least attempting to. Those eyes seemed capable of such acts; Sherlock Holmes seemed like the kind of boy who had the ability.
"Well that's a relief. My parents have got rats in their attic." Sherlock admitted.
"Alright, then maybe I will just move it back a bit." Sherlock decided finally, pulling the level and sliding the chair almost all the way back, just so that he could sit like a normal person.
"What have we here?" Greg asked, pawing at the paper before John winced, moving to pull it away before Greg faltered and lifted his hands in surrender.
"I feel as though I have been left with no other choice." Sherlock admitted quietly. John nodded quickly, yet he really did have a hard time containing his smile. Finally, finally he was not alone in this madness.
John sat at his desk in something of a state of urgency. It was still somewhere inside of two o'clock, yet at what end of the hour he did not know. It took a lot of effort to strain his eyes up to the clock on the wall, and follow the hands of the clock. Besides, he found himself in a sort of dream world. Occasionally a student would stop in and ask him a question or two, whether that be on their homework, or returned tests, or just to pop in to say hello. John looked normal, he knew that he came across as such. He knew that he smiled, and chatted, and lived up to his academic expectations. He talked of bacteria with one student, and mammals with another. He told them about his weekend, and he corrected their mistakes with a blue pen. Yet he wasn't...he wasn't there. If that made any sense, no, he wasn't present. His shell of a body smiled and talked and corrected, yet his soul was still wandering. His soul was still creeping along the halls of the house, puffing out cigarette smoke and watching as Sherlock Holmes ascended the stairs in his black robe. His soul was still standing and staring, and knowing that he should follow.
"Yes, me as well." Sherlock agreed quietly.
"Oh I'm not sure; I can't speak for the inside. But the outside...well with a little bit of paint I suppose it can become as good as new! I'm surprised, actually, that the roof hasn't caved yet. You'd think a house like that, abandoned for so many years, would show more signs of weathering. Then again, it's always been said to be an old, powerful thing. I told you about the ghost stories, yes?" Mrs. Hudson clarified excitedly, as if she really wanted to share her local knowledge. However, despite her enthusiasm, her audience had suddenly become distracted.
"What on earth are you getting your suitcase for?" Mary exclaimed, ducking out of the way as John reemerged from the basement, lugging up his great big suitcase they had bought for air travel. Ever since Rosie had been born they had been unable to go on vacations for more than a weekend, and so this suitcase still had the tags on it.
"Where is it you said you were going again?" Mary asked anxiously.
"Depends how we left it off last time. I mean, you never know who gave you that ring." John pointed out. Sherlock nodded, examining the thing on his finger with something of a frown.
"Ya...ya alright." John agreed rather nervously, pushing his mother out of the way so that he could open the screen door and admit Sherlock into the house. Sherlock smiled rather nervously at Mrs. Watson as he followed John up the carpeted stairs, smelling something like lasagna in the air as he dashed up out of the gaze of John's mother. They headed down a short hallway and arrived at John's room, or at least he could only imagine it was his bedroom, as it sported a bed and a closet and all the other telltale signs of being a bedroom. John lingered at the door and shuffled Sherlock through, closing it tightly and clicking the lock into place, seeming almost paranoid.
"Aren't there rats?" he whispered.
"And there were two other death certificates, written for the same day. I thought maybe you'd like to see them as well. It looks as though they were found in the same spots, though it doesn't say what was the cause of death." Mrs. Hudson said a bit quietly.
"Well yes, because if you had been in there it would've made sense. But no, now I'm sure my eyes are just playing tricks on me." John grumbled, shaking his head and leaning slightly against the door, as if he was afraid that along with his crumbling mental state his legs would also give way soon enough. The boy, however, seemed to be growing more and more excited.
"We were tallying the salamander populations in the woods. Sherlock's project is on their effects of the salamanders in the soil's chemistry." John explained quickly, happy to have been able to tie such a project back to chemistry after all. That way Sherlock would be a better equipped liar.
"I'd like to think that's my ancestor's name, and nothing more." John said finally. Sherlock nodded, staying quiet and looking over the letter once more, so as if to decide whether it was true or not. He didn't seem terribly enthused about the whole thing, intrigued perhaps, yet most certainly uncomfortable. John remembered back to when he praised their friendship being built so far from romance, and here was the final proof that John housed deep desires, having been carried along now throughout the centuries.
"Are you calling me a prostitute?" Sherlock growled.
"Well, Sherlock, this isn't a ghost story, no there's nothing. It's not real, none of it." John sighed.
"I don't know." Sherlock mumbled quietly. "But it would seem as though this house is playing tricks on you."
"Well yes, we get two carry ons, don't we? I need my laptop, and my um, my bag of personal possessions." Sherlock muttered a bit hesitantly. John squinted a bit suspiciously, wondering what could possibly be counted as personal possessions, however he decided to just leave it be. Sherlock could have his secrets.
"Hm, something that seemed to be from your other life?" John asked, looking over to where Sherlock was now blushing rather heavily.
"It's five o'clock!" John exclaimed. Suddenly Sherlock's sleepy eyes narrowed into the expected look of fear, sitting up so rapidly that he almost smacked his head upon John's.
"Well these boxes look promising." John announced, looking back up the staircase to see Sherlock still lingering in the light. "What, aren't you coming?"
"Yes, it would make sense." John agreed with a shutter, holding the door open even wider and allowing Sherlock to move past him, moving slowly and purposefully over the carpet. He was in no hurry, yet he was on his way nevertheless.
John sat over his desk in something of a fit, checking his clock every so often in hopes that the time had magically jumped four hours, and he could get in his car and answer that call that had been plaguing him for so long now. He knew of course that the house wasn't actually calling to him, yet all the same he felt an inescapable tugging in his chest. He felt as though he was being yanked from his desk, from his office, from his college...he felt as if he just gave into that slight tug he would be dragged halfway across the town until he arrived at that house's front step. There was something more to it; he knew that to be true. John knew that there was a reason that key sat in his pocket, there was a reason he was given such a burden. It wasn't just that he owned this house, he felt as though it was quite the other way around. The house owned him. He hadn't been given the deed because the Town Hall had been waiting for a John Watson to arrive; the house was instead waiting for him to return to it. The house knew when he would be back; it knew the exact time to organize the search, to put the idea in that Mrs. Hudson's head...John abandoned the papers he was grading and found his hand stuck in his pocket, fondling the key before clasping it between his fingers and bringing it out to sit on the desk. It was an old key, a gigantic metal thing for a gigantic metal lock. The sort you might find on ancient doors, and in old Victorian movies. Oh but it was beautiful, wasn't it? It was as old as the house, and yet still it shined. The sharp ringing of a bell brought him back to reality, the twelve o'clock bell...John panicked momentarily, getting to his feet and realizing now that the parade of students would be passing by any moment. He had to beat the rush; he had to get to his twelve fifteen class before those kids beat him there! His classroom wasn't far, and yet just as soon as John grabbed his coat the doors opened, and the mob started through. These classrooms were primarily for graduate students, for they were closer to the professor's offices, for easy mobility for projects and reports and even for quick chats. And yet just because these students were more educated, it didn't mean that they were any less barbaric in getting from one place to another. John hesitated in his doorway, for he didn't want to be trampled, and looked over the wave of students, looking for a gap where he might be able to slip through. Yet he didn't find a gap, he didn't find an opening...yet something much more interesting caught his eye. He saw in the mix of them all a face that he recognized, a face that he hadn't seen on this college before, yet a face that was so familiar all the same. A face that he had seen recurring in his dreams, ever since it originated in that house...the face of a ghost, coming to haunt him once more. John couldn't help but gasp, following that beautiful head of curly hair as it followed the crowd, half expecting it to disappear like it had before. When John had seen that ghost before it had vanished before he could ever get a good look, why would it not disappear now? Was it trying to agitate him more or...or rather was this man not a ghost after all? Was he actually human? John took a deep breath, dropping his coat on the floor and, before he could really process what he was doing, jumping into the mix of the students with a cry of urgency.
"While completely ignoring what you just said, what do you think I should do with it?" John asked with a little frown.
"I didn't." she sang a bit tauntingly. John sighed heavily, leaning up against the window and trying to see any defining landmarks. A mailbox may have been welcomed, or perhaps an aging iron gate to announce the mansion that could be looming behind the trees. These woods gave the impression that they were in the middle of nowhere, yet still the commute had not been nearly as long as his morning drive. And so, it was presumably closer to the university than was his current home. This little realization gave him yet another spark of hope, for he dared imagine a future where this was his new home. Perhaps he could flip it into something livable, and then stay himself? Make a home out of it, rather than stay cooped up in their little old house in the middle of the sprawl.
